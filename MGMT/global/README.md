## Philosophy: Polycentric Governance

**Inspired by Elinor Ostrom's work on commons management.**

MGMT uses a **polycentric structure**—not hierarchical "levels" but **overlapping jurisdictions** where global and project concerns coexist.

### What is Polycentric Governance?

Traditional hierarchical systems assume clear separation: federal → state → local, with each level having distinct authority. **Polycentric systems reject this model.**

Instead, polycentric governance recognizes:

- **Multiple simultaneous centers of authority** operating at different scales
- **Overlapping jurisdictions** rather than cleanly separated domains
- **No single hierarchy** - conflicts and negotiations are normal, not bugs
- **Self-organized innovation** at all scales, not just top-down mandates

**Key insight from Ostrom:** "There is no hierarchy of governments" in effective federal systems. Different arenas (local, regional, national) are **available simultaneously** to citizens, who choose which level to engage based on their needs.

### How MGMT Implements Polycentricity

**Two centers of authority:**

1. **Global MGMT** (universal framework) - Defines workflow patterns, epic syntax, validation rules
2. **Your project** (local implementation) - Chooses which rules to adopt, when to deviate, how to extend

**Overlapping concerns:**

- Epic format lives in `global/POLICY.md` (universal)
- Your epic _content_ lives in `ROADMAP.md` (project-specific)
- Project `POLICY.md` can **extend** global rules (e.g., "requires reindexing?" for database projects)

**Self-organized correction:**

- When MGMT updates, YOU decide whether/when to adopt changes
- No forced upgrades - you evaluate if new patterns fit your context
- Can stay on older MGMT version if it works better for your project

**Bottom-up participation:**

- Global MGMT improves based on lessons from real projects
- Your discoveries in `gaps/` inform future MGMT updates
- Community learns from each other's implementations

### Precedence Rules (When Global and Project Conflict)

**Project ALWAYS wins over global.**

When the same rule exists in both:

- `MGMT/global/POLICY.md` (default workflow)
- `MGMT/POLICY.md` (project-specific)

**→ Use the project version.**

Think of global as **defaults**, project as **overrides**:

- Global: "All epics require tests"
- Project: "Epics marked [skip-tests] exempt"
- **Result:** Project rule applies

**For AI assistants:**

1. Read global files first (understand defaults)
2. Read project files second (learn overrides)
3. Follow project rules when executing
4. Cite which level when explaining ("per project POLICY" vs "per global POLICY")

### Why This Matters for AI-Assisted Development

Traditional project management assumes **one source of truth** controlled top-down. AI collaboration requires **distributed authority**:

- **AI agent** suggests changes following global MGMT patterns
- **Human developer** evaluates fit for project context
- **Both** can be right simultaneously - AI follows framework, human adapts to reality

Ostrom showed that commons (shared resources) thrive under polycentric governance because:

1. **Local knowledge matters** - Your project's constraints aren't in any global rulebook
2. **Flexibility beats rigidity** - Adapt patterns instead of forcing compliance
3. **Innovation happens everywhere** - Best practices emerge from experiments, not mandates

**MGMT as commons:** The workflow patterns are shared infrastructure. You benefit from others' discoveries (via MGMT updates) while contributing your own (via gaps documentation). Polycentric structure keeps this sustainable.

### Key Principles

1. **Multiple centers of power:** Global MGMT defines framework, projects adapt to context
2. **Overlapping not separate:** Project POLICY.md **extends** (not replaces) global/POLICY.md
3. **Self-organized correction:** When MGMT updates, projects decide whether/when to adopt
4. **No top-down mandates:** Global provides patterns, projects choose implementations

**Example:** Epic format syntax lives in global/POLICY.md, but Librarian's "requires reindexing?" column lives in project POLICY.md. Both valid simultaneously.

## What is MGMT?

A meta-documentation system that provides:

1. **Workflow prompts** (MGMT-start, MGMT-end, MGMT-update)
2. **Universal policies** (epic dance, semantic versioning, branch strategy)
3. **Validation checks** (documentation sync, navigation blocks, formatting)
4. **Update mechanism** (fetch latest MGMT system from repo)

---

## How It Works

**Global files** (in this folder) define **HOW** to manage projects.
**Project files** (in parent MGMT/) are created **BY FOLLOWING** global prompts.

```
MGMT/
  # Project files (you create by following prompts)
  CHANGELOG.md       # Your version history
  ROADMAP.md         # Your planned features
  POLICY.md          # Extends global/POLICY.md
  CHECKS.md          # Includes global/CHECKS.md
  gaps/              # Your discoveries
  schemas/           # Your data structures
  epic-notes/        # Your session logs

  # Global files (imported from MGMT repo)
  global/
    README.md        # This file
    POLICY.md        # Universal workflow rules
    CHECKS.md        # Universal validation tests
    update-MGMT.py   # Update script
```

## Files in This Folder

### POLICY.md

Universal workflow rules that apply to ALL projects:

- Epic format syntax
- Branch strategy (epic dance)
- Semantic versioning
- Commit message format
- Rebase vs merge policies

### CHECKS.md

Universal validation tests:

- Navigation block validation
- Documentation sync checks
- Formatting standards
- Status file completeness

### update-MGMT.py

Script to update global MGMT files from repo:

```bash
python3.11 MGMT/global/update-MGMT.py
```

---

## Updating MGMT

When new MGMT versions are released:

1. Run `/MGMT-update` prompt (or `python3.11 MGMT/global/update-MGMT.py`)
2. Script fetches MGMT repo CHANGELOG
3. Shows what changed per version
4. If you confirm, overwrites files in `MGMT/global/`
5. Your project files stay untouched

**Files that update:**

- `MGMT/global/*` (all global files)
- `.github/prompts/MGMT-*.prompt.md` (workflow prompts)

**Files that stay:**

- `MGMT/CHANGELOG.md` (your version history)
- `MGMT/ROADMAP.md` (your features)
- `MGMT/POLICY.md` (your extensions)
- `MGMT/CHECKS.md` (your tests)
- `MGMT/gaps/`, `schemas/`, `epic-notes/` (your content)

---

## Philosophy

**MGMT provides structure, you provide content.**

Global files are like a framework - they define patterns and workflows.
Project files implement those patterns for your specific project.

Example:

- `global/POLICY.md` says "Use epic format: `[🚧](link) Title`"
- Your `ROADMAP.md` follows that format for YOUR epics
