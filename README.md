## Installation

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **[Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**: 3.11 or higher
3. **Run setup script**: `bash ./scripts/setup.sh`
   - Installs Python dependencies
   - Downloads local embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~90MB)
   - Model saved in `models/` directory (not tracked by git)
4. **BYOB**: Bring Your Own Books
   - Create folders in `books/` (one per topic)
   - Add `.epub` and `.pdf` files to each topic folder
   - Each folder becomes a searchable topic
   - **Optional:** Organize with subfolders for better grouping
     - Example: `books/cybersecurity/strategy/` → topic ID `cybersecurity_strategy`
     - Subfolders create separate topics with underscore naming
5. **Generate metadata**: `python3.11 scripts/generate_metadata.py`
   - Scans `books/` folders and creates `books/metadata.json`
6. **Build indices**: Choose one approach:
   - **Full index** (all topics): `python3.11 scripts/indexer.py`
   - **Per-topic** (recommended): `python3.11 scripts/reindex_topic.py <topic-id>`
   - Indices saved per-topic in `books/<topic>/faiss.index`
7. **Test (CLI)**: `bash
python3.11 scripts/research.py "what books discuss AI ethics?" --topic ai`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[books/] --> B[topic1/]
    A --> C[topic2/]
    A --> H[topic3/]

    B --> D[book1.epub]
    B --> E[book2.pdf]

    C --> F[book3.epub]
    C --> G[book4.pdf]

    H[topic3/<br/>root books] --> I[book5.epub]
    H --> J[subfolder1/<br/>topic3_subfolder1]
    H --> K[subfolder2/<br/>topic3_subfolder2]

    J --> L[book6.epub]
    K --> M[book7.epub]
```

## Usage

**Use `/research` prompt** to consult Personal Library MCP on your AI conversations (see [.github/prompts/research.prompt.md](.github/prompts/research.prompt.md))

Make sure to **specify topic or book** in your question. MCP will try to disambiguate based on metadata tags but the more focused the search, the better the results

**Example 1**: "`/research` what does Bogdanov say about Mars in Molecular Red?"

**Example 2**: "`/research` in my anthropocene books, what are the main critiques of geoengineering?"

**Example 3**: "`/research` what tarot spreads work best for decision-making under uncertainty?"

**Troubleshooting:** Books that failed to index (corrupted files, unsupported formats) go silently to `engine/docs/FAILED.md`

> 👉 Without `/research` your AI uses general knowledge. With it you get precise citations from your library

## How it works

```mermaid
graph TD
    QUERY([research prompt+<br>specific book query]) --> MAP[Read metadata.json]
    MAP --> SIM[Semantic Similarity]

    SIM --> T1[Topic: philosophy<br/>Score: 0.89]
    SIM --> T2[Topic: AI<br/>Score: 0.32]

    T1 --> B1[Book: Psychopolitics<br/>Tags: power, discipline<br/>Score: 0.91]

    B1 --> DECISION1{Confident match?}
    T2 --> DECISION2{Confident match?}

    DECISION1 -->|Yes| VEC[Query Vector Store<br/>Scope: philosophy/Psychopolitics]
    DECISION2 -->|No| ASK[System asks for clarification]

    ASK --> CLARIFY[Clarification query]
    CLARIFY --> MAP

    VEC --> ANSWER([Precise answer from<br>relevant book chunks])
```
