# Personal Library MCP

> A BYOB (Bring Your Own Books) local MCP so you can consult your library as you build your projects.

> All local (books, embedding models, database). [Connect with your favorite AI provider](#5-ai-provider-integration) and [ask away](#4-usage)

## Possible topics

- ⚖️ **Compliance**: collect all compliance and regulation manuals to test a new idea the proper way
- 🔧 **Troubleshooting**: move all your home devices and appliances' instruction manuals + warranties, ask troubleshooting questions
- 🌱 **Garden**: permaculture, indigenous plant guides, water management books to redesign your garden with less trial-and-error
- 🎸 **Music/Hobby**: wanna try a new hobby but have no idea of scope? collect authoritative books in the field you wanna learn, and reduce your confusion by asking freely questions
- 🎮 **Game Dev**: design patterns, procedural generation, narrative theory—query mid-project to find exactly which book explained that algorithm
- 🌍 **Field Research**: anthropology, ethnography, linguistics—entire library indexed locally, works offline for weeks in remote locations
- 💼 **Professional**: legal texts, industry whitepapers, case studies—cite exact sources during audits or client presentations
- 💪 **Health & Fitness**: training programs, nutrition guides, sports science—get grounded advice without influence rabbit holes

## How it works

```mermaid
graph TD
    QUERY([research prompt+<br>specific book query]) --> MAP[Read metadata.json]
    MAP --> SIM[Semantic Similarity]

    SIM --> T1[Topic: philosophy<br/>Score: 0.89]
    SIM --> T2[Topic: AI<br/>Score: 0.32]

    T1 --> B1[Book: Psychopolitics<br/>Tags: power, discipline<br/>Score: 0.91]

    B1 --> DECISION1{Confident match?}
    T2 --> DECISION2{Confident match?}

    DECISION1 -->|Yes| VEC[Query Vector Store<br/>Scope: philosophy/Psychopolitics]
    DECISION2 -->|No| ASK[System asks for clarification]

    ASK --> CLARIFY[Clarification query]
    CLARIFY --> MAP

    VEC --> ANSWER([Precise answer from<br>relevant book chunks])
```

## Installation

### Clone this repo

### 1. Install Python 3.11 or higher

- macOS`brew install python@3.11`
- Ubuntu/Debian `sudo apt install python3.11`
- Windows [Download from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Verify: `python3.11 --version`

### 2. Setup

1. Run setup script: `bash ./scripts/setup.sh`
   - Installs Python dependencies
   - Downloads local embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~90MB)
   - Model saved in `models/` directory (not tracked by git)

### 3. BYOB (Bring Your Own Books)

1. Add your books to `books/TOPICNAME/*.epub`
   - Exactly 1 folder level below `books/`
   - `.epub` and `.pdf`
   - Each folder is a topic
2. Generate metadata: `bash python3.11 scripts/generate_metadata.py`
3. Build index (includes auto-partitioning): `bash python3.11 scripts/indexer.py`
   - Creates vector store in `storage/`
   - Auto-partitions by topic for MCP lazy-loading
   - ~90MB for 34 books (local embeddings)
4. Test: `bash python3.11 scripts/query_partitioned.py "what books discuss AI ethics?" --topic ai`

**Folder structure:**

```
books/
├── topic_a/
│   ├── book1.epub
│   └── book2.pdf
├── topic_b/
│   └── book3.epub
```

### 4. Usage

- Use [/research prompt](https://github.com/nonlinear/personal-library/blob/main/.github/prompts/research.prompt.md) to consult Personal Library MCP on your AI conversations
- Make sure to specify topic or book name in your question. MCP will try to disambiguate based on metadata tags but the more focused the search, the better the results
- Without `/research`, your AI uses general knowledge. With it, you get precise citations from your library
- example 1: "`/research` what does Bogdanov say about Mars in Molecular Red?"
- example 2: "`/research` in my anthropocene books, what are the main critiques of geoengineering?"
- example 3: "`/research` what tarot spreads work best for decision-making under uncertainty?"

### 5. AI Provider Integration

The Personal Library MCP is **provider-agnostic**. Pick your favorite AI environment:

| Provider           | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
