# Literature Research

**Purpose:** Search indexed books using RAG to answer questions based on book contents.

## Instructions for AI

When this prompt is activated:

1. **Check if user specified a folder:**

   - Look for patterns like: "use oracles:", "from AI folder:", "search in urbanism:"
   - If folder specified, search ONLY in that folder
   - Check `~/Documents/literature/books/` for available folders

2. **If NO folder specified, analyze the question** to identify relevant topics:

   - Read all `.rag-topics` files in `~/Documents/literature/books/*/`
   - Match question keywords against topics in each folder
   - Identify which folders contain relevant books

3. **Consult the RAG system:**

   - Use as ferramentas MCP para consultar os livros relevantes
   - Foque na pasta especificada OU nas pastas cujos tópicos correspondem à pergunta
   - Recupere trechos e citações relevantes

4. **Provide answer with sources:**

   - When mentioning an answer that has a source, add a reference in parentheses at the end of the sentence or term, like (1), (2), (3).

   - At the end, list sources as a numbered list, each with the file:// link and a 5-word string to search, like this:

📚 Sources:

1. file:///Users/nfrota/Documents/literature/books/folder/book.epub "five sequential words here"
2. file:///Users/nfrota/Documents/literature/books/folder/another_book.epub "another five word example"

3. **If no relevant books found:**

- Explain which topics you searched
- List available folders and their topics
- Suggest how to rephrase the question

## Advanced MCP Arguments

You can use these arguments in your MCP JSON requests for more control:

- `question`: The main query string.
- `book_context`: (optional) Specify a book or folder for focused search.
- `auto_detect`: (optional, default true) Set to false to disable topic auto-detection.
- `max_sources`: (optional) Limit the number of sources returned (e.g., 5).
- `return_snippets`: (optional) If true, include text snippets from sources.
- `return_metadata`: (optional) If true, include extra metadata (author, year, etc.).

**Example MCP JSON request:**

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
    "arguments": {
      "return_snippets": true,
      "return_metadata": true

## Tips

**To ensure RAG activates:**

- Mention topics explicitly (e.g., "according to I Ching")
- Ask conceptual questions rather than generic ones
- "What is legibility?" → urbanism/
  **Examples that might NOT trigger:**
- "How are you today?" (social, not knowledge-based)
