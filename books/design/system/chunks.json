The four of us had just begun work on a new website\nfor TechCrunch, and we were sketching wireframes in Jennifer’s apartment,\nwrestling with the new demands of responsive design. Brad pulled out his\nlaptop: “I’ve been playing with a new idea.”\n\nBrad’s screen looked like a webpage had exploded. Bits and pieces of UI\nfloated free of each other, untethered by a unified design or hierarchy. It\nlooked like a pile of spare parts from a web garage.\n\nBrad flashed his crazy grin and nodded, “Great, right?” The three of us stared\nback blankly. Somebody coughed.\n\nAnd then Brad Frost the front-end developer started talking like Brad Frost\nthe chemist. He talked about atoms and molecules and organisms—about how large\npieces of design can be broken down into smaller ones and even recombined into\ndifferent large pieces. Instead of visualizing the finished recipe for the\ndesign, in other words, he was showing us the ingredients. And we lit up: this\nwas a shift in perspective, a way to move away from conceiving a website\ndesign as a collection of static page templates, and instead as a dynamic\nsystem of adaptable components. It was an inspired way to approach this\nresponsive website—and all responsive projects for that matter.\n\nBrad’s new idea was atomic design, and it changed the way we work in this\nastonishingly multi-device world. By thinking about interfaces simultaneously\nat both the large (page) level as well as the small (atomic) level, we\nstreamlined our process: we introduced more rigorous thought into the role of\nevery element; we fell into habits that improved the consistency of our UX;\nand crucially, we started working much faster and more collaboratively. Atomic\ndesign was our superpower.\n\nIn the early stages of the TechCrunch redesign, there was this moment where we\ntalked about what we wanted the article page to be. Within an hour, Brad had a\nfully responsive version wired up from his kit of parts. That was the moment\nwe realized just how quickly we were going to be able to move, a powerful case\nfor investing in this clever, modular approach.\n\nAlmost four years later, we haven’t looked back. Brad continued to refine his\ntechniques and tools over the projects that followed, including blockbuster\nsites for Entertainment Weekly and Time, Inc. We’ve used these lessons to help\nin-house product teams make sites faster and with higher quality, build\nmassive design systems for organizations looking to centralize their design\nand development work across international offices, and much more.\n\nAtomic design gave us speed, creative freedom, and flexibility. It changed\neverything. We think it will do the same for you, too.\n\nThis wonderful book explains the philosophy, practice, and maintenance of\natomic design systems. And it does so with the cheerful, helpful generosity\nthat so describes Brad himself.\n\nBrad’s energy and big-hearted enthusiasm for the web and its makers are\nboundless. For years, Brad has worked at the forefront of responsive design\ntechnique—and he’s shared everything along the way. His This Is Responsive\nsite is the go-to resource for finding responsive solutions to any UX problem.\nHis blog and Twitter feeds share his roadblocks and his solutions. When\ndesigners and developers follow Brad Frost, they get a fast and dense stream\nof practical, passionate insight for building beautiful and resilient\nwebsites. This book doubles down on all of that.\n\nGiven the chance, Brad would knock on the door of every designer and developer\nto personally deliver his message. We’ve watched with astonishment (and mild\nenvy) as this whirling dervish has barnstormed around the globe to share his\nadvice with hundreds of teams and organizations across six continents.\n(_Atomic design, coming soon to Antarctica!_) But even Brad Frost can’t be\neverywhere at once, and we’re delighted that he’s detailed his ideas with such\ndepth and good humor in this book.\n\nAtomic design is blowing up around the world; it transformed our design\npractice; and we’re excited for it to bring the same creative combustion to\nyour process, too.\n\n— _[Josh Clark](https://bigmedium.com/) and [Dan\nMall](http://danielmall.com/), Brad’s frequent collaborators and his biggest\nfans_\n\n\nArtboard 1Designing SystemsChapter 1Create design systems, not pages\n\nA long, long time ago, there were these things called _books_. Remember them?\nThese contraptions were heavy and bulky and made from the pulp of dead trees.\nInside these books were things called _pages_. You turned them, and they cut\nyour fingers.\n\nAwful things. I’m so glad these book things with their razor-sharp pages\naren’t around anymore.\n\nOh, wait…\n\n## Our paginated past\n\nThe page has been with us for a long time now. A few millennia, actually. The\nfirst books were thick slabs of clay created about 4,000 years ago, soon\nreplaced by scrolls as the preferred way to consume the written word. And\nwhile reading technology has come a long way – from papyrus to parchment to\npaperback to pixels – the concept of the page holds strong to this day.\n\nThe page metaphor has been baked into the lexicon of the web since the very\nbeginning. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web so that he, his\ncolleagues at CERN, and other academics could easily share and link together\ntheir world of _documents_. This document-based, academic genesis of the web\nis why the concept of the page is so deeply ingrained in the vocabulary of the\ninternet.\n\nSo what?\n\nAs we’ll discuss throughout this book, the way things are named very much\nimpacts how they’re perceived and utilized. Thinking of the web as pages has\nreal ramifications on how people interact with web experiences, and influences\nhow we go about creating web interfaces.\n\nFrom the beginning, the page metaphor provided users with a familiar language\nwith which to navigate this brave new World Wide Web. Concepts like\nbookmarking and pagination helped new web users explore and eventually master\nan entirely new medium using conventions they were already comfortable with.\n\n![Chrome browser displaying ‘This webpage is not\navailable](../Images/file1.png)\n\nChrome browser displaying ‘This webpage is not available\n\nThe page was – and continues to be – a very visible and helpful metaphor for\nthe users of the web. It also has a profound influence on how web experiences\nare created.\n\nIn the early days of the web, companies looking to get online simply\ntranslated their printed materials onto their websites. But even though these\nbrochure websites offered a very one-dimensional perspective of what the web\ncould offer, viewing websites as digital representations of the printed page\nwas easy for creators to wrap their heads around.\n\nBut we’re now 25 years into this new medium, and this once necessary figure of\nspeech has overstayed its welcome. Unfortunately, the **page metaphor\ncontinues to run deep with respect to how we scope and execute our web\nprojects**. Here are just a few examples I hear on a regular basis:\n\n“We’re a startup looking to launch a five-_page_ website this October…”\n\n“Brad, how long will the home _page_ take to build?”\n\n“How are we ever going to redesign this university website that contains over\n30,000 _pages_?!”\n\nAll of the statements above make the fundamental mistake of assuming a page is\na uniform, isolated, quantifiable thing. The reality is that the web is a\nfluid, interactive, interdependent medium. As soon as we come to terms with\nthis fact, the notion of the page quickly erodes as a useful means to scope\nand create web experiences.\n\nHow long will a homepage take to build? Well, that sort of depends on what’s\non it, right? Maybe the homepage simply consists of a tagline and a background\nimage, which means it could be done by lunch. Or maybe it’s chock-full of\ncarousels, dynamic forms, and third-party integrations. In that case, maybe\nthe homepage will take several months to complete.\n\nAs for the 30,000-page university website, it might be tempting to declare,\n“Thousands of pages?! Wow, that sounds challenging!” But in reality, those\n30,000 pages may consist of three content types and two overarching layouts.\n\nUltimately, a project’s level of effort is much better determined by the\nfunctionality and [components](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/scope-\ncomponents-not-pages/) contained within those pages, rather than on the\nquantity of pages themselves.\n\nThe page metaphor has served its purpose helping users familiarize themselves\nwith the web, and provided creators with the necessary transitional language\nwith which to create for a brand new medium. But to build thoughtful\ninterfaces meant to be served to a multitude of connected devices, the time\nhas come for us to evolve beyond the page.\n\n## Tearing up the page\n\nThankfully, the web community is hard at work establishing principles and\npractices to help us effectively talk about and create for the web. And\nthere’s one concept that keeps popping up in every conversation about how to\nmake successful web experiences: **modularity**.\n\nModularity predates the web by a long shot. The Industrial Revolution brought\nabout interchangeable parts and Henry Ford’s assembly line forever transformed\nthe automobile manufacturing process. The earliest cars and components were\nindividually crafted, which led to many safety and maintainability nightmares.\nFord broke the automobile down into its component parts and modularized the\nassembly process. The results spoke for themselves: more uniform, more\nreliable, safer cars rolled out of the factory, and in record time to boot.\n\nAs the machine age became the computer age, computer scientists began\npracticing object-oriented programming and establishing important modular\nconcepts like _separation of concerns_ and the _single responsibility\nprinciple_. It is from this world that the World Wide Web was born, so it’s no\nsurprise that [modular\ndesign](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#Modular) quickly became\na design principle for the architecture of the web.\n\nSlowly, but surely, these concepts found their way into web designers’\nworkflows. In the early 2000s we saw the introduction of libraries like\n[YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/) and [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) that\nprovided developers with a toolkit of widgets and patterns to create more\nconsistent user interfaces.\n\nIf modularity has been around for such a long time, why are we talking about\nit now?\n\nThe short answer is that modularity matters more than ever. Right now, our\nentire industry is drowning in a sea of devices, viewport sizes, and online\nenvironments. And things aren’t slowing down anytime soon.\n\n> Disruption will only accelerate. The quantity and diversity of connected\n> devices — many of which we haven’t imagined yet — will explode, as will the\n> quantity and diversity of the people around the world who use them. Our\n> existing standards, workflows, and infrastructure won’t hold up. Today’s\n> onslaught of devices is already pushing them to the breaking point. They\n> can’t withstand what’s ahead. [The Future-Friendly\n> manifesto](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/)\n\n![These are just some of the connected devices we need to worry\nabout.](../Images/file2.jpg)\n\nThese are just some of the connected devices we need to worry about.\n\nLike it or not, this multi-device universe is our reality. It was hard enough\nto get our web pages to display consistently in a handful of desktop browsers,\nbut we’re now tasked with ensuring our web experiences look and function\nbeautifully on a dizzying array of smartphones, tablets, phablets, netbooks,\nnotebooks, desktops, TVs, game consoles, and more.\n\nTo address this reality while maintaining our sanity, it’s absolutely\nnecessary for us to take a step back and break these giant responsibilities\ninto smaller, more manageable chunks.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what folks are doing. The spirit of modularity is weaving\nits way into every aspect of the web creation process and having profound\neffects on organizations’ strategy, process, content, design, and development.\n\n### A manageable strategy\n\nEvery organization is finally realizing that bulldozing their entire website\nand replacing it with a New-And-Shiny™ website every three to eight years\nisn’t (and never was) an optimal solution.\n\nOut with the old! In with the new! It’s certainly an attractive prospect. But\neven before the launch party confetti is swept up, the calls start coming in.\n“You moved my cheese!” cry the users, who spent years learning the previous\ninterface and functionality.\n\nWhen massive redesigns launch with significant changes to the experience,\nusers get knocked down what Jared Spool calls the [“Magic Escalator of\nAcquired Knowledge”](http://www.uie.com/articles/magic_escalator/). Huge\nredesigns are a jolt to the system, and newly frustrated users have to spend a\ngreat deal of time and energy relearning the experience in order to slowly\nclimb back up that escalator of acquired knowledge.\n\nIn addition to disorienting users, these monolithic redesigns don’t get to the\norganizational root of the problem. Without a fundamental change in process,\nhistory is bound to repeat itself, and what’s New-And-Shiny™ today becomes\nOld-And-Crusty™ tomorrow. The cycle repeats itself as companies push off minor\nupdates until the next big redesign, ultimately paralyzing themselves and\nfrustrating users in the process.\n\nThankfully, even massive organizations are taking cues from the smaller,\nleaner startup world and striving to get things out the door quicker. By\ncreating _minimum viable products_ and shipping often to iteratively improve\nthe experience, organizations are able to better address user feedback and\nkeep up with the ever-shifting web landscape.\n\nMoving away from Ron Popeil-esque, set-it-and-forget-it redesigns requires\ndeliberate changes in organizational structure and workflow. Which is a heck\nof a lot easier said than done.\n\n### An iterative process\n\nIf I had a quarter for every time I heard some stakeholder declare “We’re\ntrying to be more agile,” I’d be orbiting the earth in my private spacecraft\ninstead of writing this book.\n\nWanting to be more agile is commendable. But _agile_ is a loaded term, with\nbig differences between capital-A Agile and lowercase-a agile. Capital-A Agile\nis a specific methodology for software development, equipped with a\n[manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) and accompanying frameworks like\n[Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) and\n[Lean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development).\n\nLowercase-a agile is more of an informal desire to create an efficient\nprocess. This desire may certainly involve adopting general\n[principles](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) from capital-A\nAgile, but it may not involve adopting the Agile process in its entirety.\nProject manager Brett Harned explains:\n\n> We want to be more agile; we’re embracing change, continuing improvement,\n> being as flexible as possible, and adapting as we see fit. The thing is, we\n> won’t ever truly be Agile, as the Manifesto states. That’s okay, as long as\n> we say what we will be. [Brett\n> Harned](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/diy-process)\n\nOrganizational structure, client relations, personalities, and so on all play\nmajor roles in determining a project’s process. The trick is to find the\nprocess that works best for you, your organizational constraints and\nopportunities.\n\nEven though it may be impossible to adopt a truly Agile process, it’s still a\nsound idea to work in cross-disciplinary teams, get into the final environment\nfaster, ship early and often, and break bigger tasks into smaller components.\nIn chapter 4, we’ll detail how to establish an effective pattern-based\nworkflow.\n\n### Modularizing content: I’m on Team Chunk\n\n> Get your content ready to go anywhere, because it’s going to go everywhere.\n> [For A Future-Friendly Web](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/for-a-future-\n> friendly-web/)\n\nPublishing content for the Web used to be a fairly straightforward endeavor,\nas the desktop web was the only game in town. Oh, how things have changed.\nToday, our content is consumed by a whole slew of smartphones, dumb phones,\nnetbooks, notebooks, tablets, e-readers, smartwatches, TVs, game consoles,\ndigital signage, car dashboards, and more.\n\nTo properly address this increasingly diverse and eclectic digital landscape,\nwe need to dramatically overhaul our perception of content and the tools we\nuse to manage it.\n\n> In the future, what I believe is that we are going to have better content\n> management and content publishing tools. We are going to have ways to take\n> well-structured content, well-designed chunks of content that we can then\n> figure out how we want to restructure and publish and display in a way\n> that’s going to be right for the appropriate platform. [Karen\n> McGrane](http://karenmcgrane.com/2012/09/04/adapting-ourselves-to-adaptive-\n> content-video-slides-and-transcript-oh-my/)\n\nThankfully, this future is starting to take shape. Organizations are\nrecognizing the need to create modularized content to better reach their\naudience wherever they may be. And content management systems are evolving\nbeyond their web publishing platform roots into tools that can elegantly\ncreate and maintain modular content. While sophisticated content management\nsystems have existed for years in the form of custom solutions like [NPR’s\nCOPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere)\nplatform](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/cope-create-once-publish-\neverywhere/2009/10/13), smart modular thinking is making its way into\nmainstream content management systems.\n\n### Classy code\n\nModularity has long been a staple principle in the world of computer science,\nas we discussed earlier. While this principle existed long before the web was\ninvented, it has taken some time for modularity to become engrained in the\nminds and hearts of web developers.\n\nDespite being around since 1995, JavaScript, the programming language of the\nweb, first had to endure some growing pains to mature into the capable,\nrespected language it is today. Now that JavaScript has grown up, developers\ncan apply those tried-and-true computer science principles to their web\ndevelopment workflows. As a result, we’re seeing folks develop sophisticated\n[JavaScript\npatterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) and\narchitectures.\n\nApplying modular programming principles to JavaScript is a bit of a no-\nbrainer, since JavaScript is itself a programming language. But object-\noriented thinking is weaving its way into other aspects of the web as well,\nincluding CSS, the styling language of the web. Methodologies like\n[OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), and\n[BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-\nsyntax) have cropped up to help web designers create and maintain modular CSS\narchitectures.\n\n### Visually repaired\n\nNot only is modularity infiltrating the code side of style on the web, it’s\nrevolutionizing how visual designers approach modern web design.\n\nAs the number of viewports and environments proliferate, it’s become untenable\nto produce static mockups of every page of a web experience. As Stephen Hay\nquipped, presenting fully baked Photoshop comps “is the most effective way to\nshow your clients what their website will never look like.”\n\nThat’s not to say static design tools like Photoshop and Sketch aren’t\nimportant. Far from it. But it’s the way we use these tools that has changed\ndramatically. While creating hundreds of full-on comps isn’t realistic, these\nstatic tools excel at providing a playground to establish what Andy Clarke\ncalls “design atmosphere”:\n\n> Atmosphere describes the feelings we get that are evoked by colour, texture\n> and typography. You might already think of atmosphere in different terms.\n> You might call it “feel”, “mood” or even “visual identity.” Whatever words\n> you choose, the atmosphere of a design doesn’t depend on layout. It’s\n> independent of arrangement and visual placement. It will be seen, or felt,\n> at every screen size and on every device. [Andy\n> Clarke](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/an-extract-from-designing-\n> atoms-and-elements)\n\nEstablishing design atmosphere early is critical to a project’s success, which\nis why designers have found ways to facilitate these important conversations\nwithout having to generate full mockups. Designer Samantha Warren developed\ndesign artifacts called [style tiles](http://styletil.es/), which demonstrate\ncolor, type, and texture explorations in a nice encapsulated one-pager.\nDesigner Dan Mall built on Samantha’s idea with a concept called [element\ncollages](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/), which\ndemonstrate design atmosphere explorations in an exploded collage of interface\nelements.\n\n![Style tiles, a concept created by designer Samantha Warren, allow designers\nto explore color, typography, and texture without having to develop fully\nrealized comps.](../Images/file3.jpg)\n\nStyle tiles, a concept created by designer Samantha Warren, allow designers to\nexplore color, typography, and texture without having to develop fully\nrealized comps.\n\nBy breaking visual explorations into smaller chunks, designers save time and\neffort while avoiding presenting unrealistic, premature layouts to clients.\nMore importantly, these approaches shift stakeholders away from simply\nreacting to a pretty picture, and instead facilitate crucial conversations\nabout overall design direction and how they relate to the project’s goals.\nWe’ll discuss these concepts in more detail in chapter 4, but suffice it to\nsay the visual design workflow is changing in a big way!\n\n### Systematic UI design\n\n> We’re not designing pages, we’re designing systems of components. [Stephen\n> Hay](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/bdconf-stephen-hay-presents-\n> responsive-design-workflow/)\n\nWhat is an interface made of? What are our Lego bricks? What are our Subway\nsandwich pieces that we combine into millions of delicious combinations? It’s\nthese questions that we’ve been asking ourselves more and more now that we’re\nsending our interfaces to more and more places.\n\nA few years ago Ethan Marcotte introduced us to the idea of [responsive web\ndesign](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) and its three\ncore tenets: fluid grids, flexible media, and CSS media queries. These three\ningredients provided a much needed foundation for designers to create flexible\nlayouts that smartly adapt to any screen size. Perhaps more importantly,\nresponsive design helped get designers excited about creating thoughtful,\nadaptable, multi-device web experiences.\n\nAs designers quickly discovered, creating multi-device web experiences\ninvolves a lot more than creating squishy pages. Each individual piece of an\ninterface contains its own unique challenges and opportunities in order for it\nto look and function beautifully across many screen sizes and environments.\n\nHow can we present primary navigation – typically displayed as a horizontal\nlist on large screens – in a thoughtful way on smaller screens? How do\nlightboxes, breadcrumbs, and carousels translate to smaller viewports and\nalternate input types? It’s these questions that led me to create [This Is\nResponsive](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/index.html), a\nshowcase of responsive patterns that demonstrate the various ways a particular\ncomponent could be executed in a responsive environment.\n\nWhile This Is Responsive is successful at articulating how these interface\npatterns can scale across screen sizes and environments, it’s still up to\ndesigners and developers to put these patterns into action. And as it turns\nout, that’s a lot of work.\n\n## UI frameworks, in theory and in practice\n\nDesigners and developers are already strapped for time and resources, and\nthey’re now being tasked with making interfaces that look and function\nbeautifully in any environment. That’s a very tall order.\n\nThis need to address growing device diversity while still sanely getting\nprojects out the door has given rise to front-end frameworks like [Foundation\nby Zurb](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and\n[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). These user interface frameworks provide\ndesigners with a collection of preassembled HTML patterns, CSS styles, and\nJavaScript to add functionality to interactive components like dropdowns and\ncarousels. In essence, these frameworks are handy tool kits for quickly\nassembling interfaces.\n\n![Bootstrap provides a collection of UI components to speed up\ndevelopment.](../Images/file4.jpg)\n\nBootstrap provides a collection of UI components to speed up development.\n\nAnd boy are these things popular. As I’m writing this, Bootstrap is the most\npopular repository on the code-sharing site [GitHub](https://github.com/),\nwith over 77,000 stars and 30,000 forks. These frameworks’ popularity is a\ntestament to the fact that designers and developers are seeking solid ground\nto stand on in this ever-complex web landscape.\n\nOne of the most attractive aspects of these frameworks is _speed_. Frameworks\nlike Bootstrap allow designers to get ideas off the ground quickly, rapidly\ncreate prototypes, and launch sites sooner. Because the patterns provided by a\ntool kit are already cross-browser tested, developers can spend their time on\nmore important tasks rather than beating their heads against a table testing\nsome archaic version of Internet Explorer. And in case designers do get stuck,\nthese frameworks’ communities can provide helpful support and advice.\n\nFor freelancers, this increase in speed might mean they can take on an extra\nproject or three, yielding more financial stability for the year. And in the\nstartup world – a place where Bootstrap is omnipresent – minimum viable\nproducts can launch sooner, leading to faster answers regarding the products’\nviability.\n\nSo frameworks like Bootstrap are insanely popular design systems that provide\nwell-tested components, resulting in consistent designs and faster launches.\nWhat’s not to love? Well, like most everything in life, there are cons right\nthere alongside the pros.\n\n### Trouble in framework paradise\n\nWhen I was a kid, I’d watch sci-fi movies and TV shows with a strange\nfascination. There was one question I could never quite shake: _why are they\nall dressed the same_?\n\n![In the future, everyone dresses the same. Illustration by Melissa\nFrost](../Images/sci-fi.jpg)\n\nIn the future, everyone dresses the same. Illustration by Melissa Frost\n\nI could only guess that given enough time, we _solve fashion_. “Say, these\njumpsuits are pretty snazzy, and comfortable too! Let’s just all wear these\nfrom now on.” “Sounds good to me!”\n\nOf course, that’s not how human beings work. We all have different tastes,\ngoals, and desires. Variety, as they say, is the spice of life, and fashion,\nmusic, and design reflect our diverse nature. Yet on the web we tend to fall\ninto the trap of wanting everyone to do things the same way. “Why don’t all\nbrowsers just standardize on WebKit?” “Why can’t device manufacturers just use\nthe same screen sizes?” “Always use jQuery!” “Never use jQuery!” “Just use\nframeworks!” “Never use frameworks!”\n\nJust like the real world, the diverse needs, goals, and desires of web\nprojects lead to a myriad of different solutions. Of course, there’s a time\nand place for everything, and designers and developers need the discernment to\nknow which tools to use and when.\n\nFront-end frameworks are tools that provide a specific solution and a\nparticular look and feel. While those solutions help speed up development, the\nresulting experiences end up resembling those sci-fi jumpsuits. When everyone\nuses the same buttons, grids, dropdowns, and components, things naturally\nstart to look the same. If Nike, Adidas, Puma, and Reebok were to redesign\ntheir respective sites using Bootstrap, they would look substantially similar.\nThat’s certainly not what these brands are going for. Sure, each brand can\nmodify and extend the default look and feel, but after a while customization\nmeans fighting the framework’s given structure, style, and functionality.\n\nIn addition to look-alike issues, these frameworks can add unnecessary bloat\nto an experience. It’s fantastic that frameworks provide plenty of prebuilt\ncomponents and functionality, but a large percentage of designers and\ndevelopers won’t adopt every aspect of the framework. Unfortunately, users\nstill have to download the framework’s unused CSS and JavaScript, resulting in\nslower page loads and frustration.\n\nOn the flip side of that coin, frameworks might not go far enough, leading to\ndevelopers needing to create a substantial amount of custom code to achieve\ntheir projects’ goals. At some point, a threshold is crossed where the initial\nbenefits of using a framework–namely development _speed_ –are outweighed by\nthe time spent modifying, extending, and fixing the framework.\n\nAnd then there’s the issue with naming. Using a framework means subscribing to\nsomeone else’s structure, naming, and style conventions. Of course, it’s\nimportant to establish a useful front-end lexicon, but what makes sense for an\norganization might not be what comes out of a framework’s box. I, for one,\nwould balk at the idea of using Bootstrap’s default component for a featured\ncontent area they call a “jumbotron”. How a framework’s naming conventions\njive with an existing codebase and workflow should be properly discussed\nbefore jumping on board the framework train.\n\nNow that we’ve put frameworks through the wringer, it’s important to take a\nstep back and recognize that conceptually these frameworks are very much on\npoint. It’s an excellent idea to work with a design tool kit that promotes\nconsistency and speeds up development time. While discussing the redesign of\nMicrosoft’s homepage by Austin-based web shop Paravel, developer Dave Rupert\nstressed the importance of creating and delivering a design system to their\nclient. Dave wonderfully articulated that it’s not necessarily about using\nBootstrap for every client, but rather creating “tiny Bootstraps for every\nclient.”\n\n> Responsive deliverables should look a lot like fully-functioning Twitter\n> Bootstrap-style systems custom tailored for your clients’ needs. These\n> living code samples are self-documenting style guides that extend to\n> accommodate a client’s needs as well as the needs of the ever-evolving\n> multi-device web. [Dave Rupert](http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-\n> deliverables/)\n\nIt’s not just about using a design system, it’s about creating _your_ system.\n\n## Design systems save the day\n\nSo what do robust design systems look like? What form do they take? How do you\ncreate, maintain, and enforce them?\n\nThe cornerstones of good design systems are _style guides_ , which document\nand organize design materials while providing guidelines, usage, and\nguardrails.\n\nAs it happens, there are [many flavors of style\nguides](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guides/), including documentation\nfor brand identity, writing, voice and tone, code, design language, and user\ninterface patterns. This book won’t detail every category of style guide, but\nit’s important to take a look at each to better understand how each style\nguide influences the others, and how style guides for the web fit into a\nlarger ecosystem.\n\n### Brand identity\n\nBrand identity guidelines define the assets and materials that make a company\nunique. Logos, typography, color palettes, messaging (such as mission\nstatements and taglines), collateral (such as business card and PowerPoint\ntemplates), and more are aggregated and described in brand identity\nguidelines.\n\n![West Virginia University’s brand style guide.](../Images/file6.jpg)\n\nWest Virginia University’s brand style guide.\n\nIt’s essential for a brand to present itself in a cohesive manner across an\nincreasing number of media, channels, and touchpoints. How can everyone within\nan organization speak in one voice and feel part of a singular entity? How do\nthird parties know which Pantone colors to use and how to correctly use the\nbrand’s logo? Brand identity guidelines provide answers to these fundamental\nquestions in one centralized hub.\n\nHistorically, brand identity guidelines were contained in hard-cover books\n(remember, those things with the pages?), but as with everything else, brand\nstyle guides are making their way online.\n\n### Design language\n\nWhile brand identity guidelines are fairly tactile, design language guidelines\nare a bit harder to pin down. Design language style guides articulate a\ngeneral design direction, philosophy, and approach to specific projects or\nproducts.\n\nTo present itself in a cohesive way across a growing range of products and\nmedia, Google developed a design language called _material design_. The\n[material design style guide](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-\ndesign/introduction.html) defines its overarching design philosophy, goals,\nand general principles, while also providing specific applications of the\nmaterial design language.\n\n![Google’s material design language.](../Images/file7.png)\n\nGoogle’s material design language.\n\nDesign language style guides can (and usually do) incorporate aspects of other\nstyle guide categories in order to make high-level concepts a bit more\ntangible.\n\nDesign language guidelines aren’t set in stone the way brand guidelines are.\nFor example, one day Google will likely develop a new design language to\nreplace material design, so while Google’s overall brand will remain intact,\nthe design vocabulary around its products will change.\n\n### Voice and tone\n\nPeople interact with brands across a huge array of channels and media. In\naddition to the digital media we’ve discussed so far, brands also operate in\nprint, retail, outdoor, radio, TV, and other channels. When a brand must\ncommunicate across so many varied touchpoints, speaking in a unified,\nconsistent manner becomes critical to a brand’s success.\n\n> A brand’s voice stays the same from day to day, but its tone has to change\n> all the time, depending on both the situation and the reader’s feelings.\n> [Kate Kiefer Lee](http://www.slideshare.net/katekiefer/kkl-c-sforum)\n\nVoice is an elemental aspect of a brand’s identity, so typically brand\nidentity guidelines include some reference to the brand’s voice. However,\nthese guidelines usually aren’t very nuanced, which is why voice and tone\nguidelines are so important.\n\nVoice and tone guidelines get into the weeds by articulating how the company’s\nvoice and tone should shift across a variety of scenarios. [MailChimp’s\nbrilliant voice and tone guidelines](http://voiceandtone.com/) define how the\nbrand’s tone changes across content types, so that when a user’s credit card\nis declined, writers know to shift away from their generally cheeky and\nplayful tone of voice and adopt a more serious tone instead.\n\n![Mailchimp’s Voice and Tone guidelines](../Images/file8.png)\n\nMailchimp’s Voice and Tone guidelines\n\n### Writing\n\nThe rise of the web and content-managed websites makes it easier than ever for\nmany people within an organization to publish content. This, of course, can be\na double-edged sword, as maintaining a consistent writing style for an\norganization with many voices can be challenging. Writing style guides provide\nevery author some guidelines and guardrails for contributing content.\n\n![The Economist’s writing style guide.](../Images/file9.jpg)\n\nMailchimp’s Voice and Tone guidelines\n\nWriting style guides can be extremely granular, defining particulars around\npunctuation and grammar, but they don’t always have to be so detailed.\n[Dalhousie University’s writing style\nguide](http://www.dal.ca/webteam/web_style_guide/writing_for_the_web.html)\nprovides a concise list of principles and best practices for content\ncontributors to follow.\n\n### Code style guides\n\nIt’s essential for teams to write legible, scalable, maintainable code. But\nwithout a way to promote and enforce code consistency, it’s easy for things to\nfall apart and leave every developer to fend for themselves.\n\n![GitHub’s code style guide provides best practices for writing HTML, CSS,\nJavaScript, and Ruby within their organization.](../Images/file10.png)\n\nGitHub’s code style guide provides best practices for writing HTML, CSS,\nJavaScript, and Ruby within their organization.\n\nCode style guides provide conventions, patterns, and examples for how teams\nshould approach their code. These guidelines and guardrails help rein in the\nmadness so that teams can focus on producing great work together rather than\nrefactoring a bunch of sloppy, inconsistent code.\n\n## Pattern Libraries\n\nAnd now for the main event. Pattern libraries, also known as front-end style\nguides, UI libraries, or component libraries, are quickly becoming a\ncornerstone of modern interface design.\n\n![Code for America’s pattern library](../Images/file11.png)\n\nCode for America’s pattern library\n\nThe rest of this book will concentrate on how to approach interface design in\na systematic manner, and detail how to establish and maintain pattern\nlibraries.\n\n## Style guide benefits\n\nGetting UIs to work across a myriad of screen sizes, devices, browsers, and\nenvironments is a tall order in and of itself. But once you factor in other\nteam members, clients, stakeholders, and organizational quirks, things start\nlooking downright _intimidating_.\n\nStyle guides are important tools that help prevent chaos, both from a design\nand development standpoint and also from an organizational perspective. Here’s\nwhy style guides are now essential tools for modern web design and\ndevelopment.\n\n### Consistently awesome\n\n**Web style guides promote consistency and cohesion** across a user interface.\nThis consistency benefits both the people who create these interfaces and also\ntheir users.\n\nI recently visited my health insurance provider’s website to pay my bill. In\nthe course of five clicks, I was hit with four distinct interface designs,\nsome of which looked like they were last touched in 1999. This inconsistent\nexperience put the burden on me, the user, to figure out what went where and\nhow to interpret disparate interface elements. By the time I got to the\npayment form, I felt like I couldn’t trust the company to successfully and\nsecurely process my payment.\n\nStyle guides help iron out these inconsistencies by encouraging reuse of\ninterface elements. Designers and developers can refer back to existing\npatterns to ensure the work they’re producing is consistent with what’s\nalready been established.\n\nEven third parties responsible for matching their UIs with the look and feel\nof a company’s internal UIs can make great use of a style guide. Externally\nhosted experiences like payment portals or localized sites can better match\nthe look and feel of the primary experience by applying the styles defined in\nthe guide.\n\nMaking style guides central to your process results in user interfaces that\nfeel more united and trustworthy, which helps users accomplish their tasks\nfaster and empowers them to master the interface.\n\n### A shared vocabulary\n\nWhat does “utility toolbar” mean? Does everyone understand what a “touch\nslider hero” is?\n\nAs the number of people working on a project increases, it becomes all too\neasy for communication breakdowns to occur. It’s not uncommon for different\ndisciplines to have different names for the same module, and for individuals\nto go rogue and invent their own naming conventions. For true collaboration to\noccur, it’s essential for teams to speak a common language. Style guides are\nthere to help establish that shared vocabulary.\n\n![Giving names to patterns like 'Blocks Three-Up' in Starbucks' style guide\nhelps team members speak the same language.](../Images/file12.png)\n\nGiving names to patterns like 'Blocks Three-Up' in Starbucks' style guide\nhelps team members speak the same language.\n\n**Style guides establish a consistent, shared vocabulary between everyone\ninvolved in a project** , encouraging collaboration between disciplines and\nreducing communication breakdowns.\n\n### Education\n\nIn her book [Front-End Style Guides](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-\nstyle-guides/), Anna Debenham deftly explains the many advantages of creating\nstyle guides, including one of the most crucial benefits: education.\n\n> Education is as important as documentation. A style guide can show clients\n> that websites are systems rather than collections of pages. [Anna\n> Debenham](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/)\n\nStyle guides demonstrate to clients, stakeholders, and other disciplines that\nthere’s a lot of really thoughtful work going into a website’s design and\ndevelopment beyond just “Hey, let’s make a new website.” **A pattern library\ncommunicates the design language in a very tangible way** , which helps\nstakeholders understand that an underlying system is determining the final\ninterface.\n\nStyle guides can help alleviate what I call _special snowflake syndrome_ ,\nwhere certain departments in an organization think that they have unique\nproblems and therefore demand unique solutions. By exposing the design system\nin the form of a style guide, these special snowflakes can better appreciate\nconsistency and understand why their requests for custom designs receive\npushback.\n\n### An empathetic workflow\n\nEducation isn’t just important for clients and stakeholders. A good style\nguide helps inform designers and developers of the tools they have in their\ntoolbox, and provides rules and best practices for how to use them properly.\n\nBy making a style guide a cornerstone of your workflow (which we’ll detail in\nchapter 4), **designers and developers are forced to think about how their\ndecisions affect the broader design system**. It becomes harder to go rogue\nand easier to think of the greater good. And this is exactly where you want\nteam members to be.\n\nA style guide provides a home for each discipline to contribute their\nrespective considerations and concerns for patterns. By collecting all these\nconsiderations under one roof, the style guide becomes a hub for everyone\ninvolved in the project, which helps each discipline better understand the\ndesign system from many perspectives.\n\n### Testing, testing, 1-2-3\n\nThe homepage is broken, you say? Well, what exactly is breaking it?\n\nThe ability to pull an interface apart into its component pieces makes testing\na lot easier. A style guide allows you to view interface patterns in\nisolation, allowing developers to zero in on what’s causing errors, browser\ninconsistencies, or performance issues.\n\n### Speed\n\nEarlier in the chapter we discussed how _faster design and development_ is one\nof the main reasons why UI frameworks like Bootstrap are so popular. We’re\nunder pressure to get projects out the door as soon as humanly possible. By\ndeveloping your own design system, you can reap those same speed rewards as\nthe out-of-the-box UI tool kits.\n\nIt’s true that devising an interface design system and creating a custom\npattern library initially takes a lot of time, thought, and effort. But once\nthe pattern library is established, subsequent design and development becomes\nmuch faster, which tends to make everybody happy.\n\nFederico Holgado, lead UX developer at MailChimp,\n[explained](http://styleguides.io/podcast/federico-holgado/) how MailChimp’s\npattern library initially consisted of patterns created from the four primary\nscreens of their app. But once they moved on to other areas of the site, they\nrealized they were able to use existing patterns rather than having to\ngenerate brand new patterns from scratch every time.\n\n> …Once we did that, as we were implementing things in other pages we started\n> to realize: man, this system will actually work here and this system will\n> actually work here and here. [Federico\n> Holgado](http://styleguides.io/podcast/federico-holgado/)\n\n### In it for the long haul\n\nThere’s no doubt style guides help teams effectively get things done in the\nhere and now. But much like a fine wine, style guides increase in value over\ntime. The beautiful thing about interface design systems is that they can and\nshould be modified, extended, and refined for years to come.\n\nAs previously mentioned, creating a custom pattern library requires a lot of\nhard work up front, but that hard work should provide a structural foundation\nfor future iteration and refinement. Lessons learned from analytics, user\ntesting, A/B testing, and experience should be incorporated into the style\nguide, making it a powerful hub for truth, knowledge, and best practices.\n\nBetter yet, even if you were to undertake a major redesign you’ll find that\nmany of the structural interface building blocks will remain the same. You’ll\nstill have forms, buttons, headings, other common interface patterns, so\nthere’s no need to throw the baby out with the bath water. A style guide\nprovides a rock-solid foundation for all future work, even if that future work\nmay look totally different.\n\n## Style guide challenges\n\nBy now the benefits of creating design systems should be abundantly clear, and\nhopefully visions of sugar plums and beautiful style guides are dancing\nthrough your head. But to reach style guide nirvana, you must first overcome\nthe many treacherous challenges that come with the territory.\n\n### The hard sell\n\nTo benefit from style guides, organizations must first appropriate the\nnecessary time and budget to make them happen. **That requires organizations\nto overcome the short-term mentality that all too often creeps its way into\ncompany culture.**\n\nThe long-term benefits that style guides provide are obvious to those who are\nalready thinking about the long game. The challenge, therefore, becomes\nconvincing those stuck in a short-term, quarter-by-quarter mindset that\nestablishing a thoughtful design system is a smart investment in the future.\n\n### A matter of time\n\n> The hard part is building the machine that builds the product.” [Dennis\n> Crowley](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/03/founder-stories-foursquare-\n> crowley-machine/)\n\nPerhaps the biggest, most unavoidable challenge is that **style guides are\ntime-consuming to create**. I don’t know about you, but I don’t go into work\nevery day twiddling my thumbs wondering what to do with my time. I’ve never\nmet a person who isn’t feeling pressure to get work out the door, and this\npressure naturally leads to focusing on the primary web project.\nUnfortunately, aggressive timelines and finite budgets detract from the effort\nrequired to make style guides happen, even when teams are committed to the\ncause.\n\n### Auxiliary Projects\n\n**Pattern libraries are often treated as auxiliary projects** , rather than as\nthe component parts of the final product. By treating pattern libraries as\nsomething separate from the core project, they tend to fall into the _nice to\nhave_ category and become first on the chopping block when the going gets\ntough.\n\nThis auxiliary project conundrum reminds me of sentiments I often hear around\nfactoring accessibility into projects. They say, “Oh, we wish we had the time\nand budget for accessibility, but…” The notion that accessibility (and other\nprinciples like performance and responsiveness) is a costly extra line item is\na fallacy. Pattern libraries, like accessibility, are good ideas to bake into\nyour workflow whether or not the project plan explicitly calls for them.\n\n### Maintenance and governance\n\nEven if time and money are allocated to establish style guides, these valuable\ntools often die on the vine if they’re not given the focus they need to reach\ntheir true potential.\n\n**A maintenance and governance strategy is critical to style guides’\nsuccess.** Style guides will be thrown in the trash (right beside all those\nPSDs and wireframes) and abandoned without a proper strategy in place for who\nwill manage, maintain, and enforce them.\n\nStyle guide maintenance is a hugely important topic and deserves to be covered\nin detail, so we’ll dive into how to create maintainable style guides in\nchapter 5.\n\n### Audience confusion\n\n**Style guides can be misunderstood as tools useful only to designers or\ndevelopers** , which leads to a lack of visibility that immediately limits\ntheir effectiveness. Instead of serving as a watering hole for everyone in the\norganization, a style guide can become a best-kept secret guarded by one\ndiscipline. Color me naive, but I don’t think this helps foster a culture of\ncollaboration.\n\nWithout thinking of broader audiences, style guides may come across as too\nvague or too technical, which can intimidate other disciplines and lead them\nto believe these resources aren’t for them.\n\n### Style guide structure\n\nFor style guides to be useful resources for everyone in an organization, they\nshould clearly convey what they are and why they matter. Style guides should\nbe attractive, inviting, visible, clear, and easy to use. As mentioned above,\nthey should be aware that a whole host of audiences will be viewing them, so\nshould therefore aim to be welcoming and useful for as many people as\npossible.\n\n![Yelp's style guide homepage sports a handsome design and important intro\ntext explaining the purpose and audience for the guide.](../Images/file13.jpg)\n\nYelp's style guide homepage sports a handsome design and important intro text\nexplaining the purpose and audience for the guide.\n\n### Lack of context\n\nContext is key to understanding a design system. Unfortunately, most pattern\nlibraries out in the wild don’t provide any hints as to when, how, and where\ntheir components get used. Without providing context, designers and developers\ndon’t know how global a particular pattern is, and as a result wouldn’t know\nwhich pages of their app would need to be revisited, QA’d, and tested if\nchanges were made.\n\n!['Highlight Block' looks useful, but where is this pattern being\nused?](../Images/file14.png)\n\n'Highlight Block' looks useful, but where is this pattern being used?\n\n### Lacking a clear methodology\n\nAs much as I adore the pattern libraries [out\nthere](http://styleguides.io/examples.html), I can’t help but notice a lack of\nstructure in many of them. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s absolutely\nfantastic that teams are thinking systematically and are documenting their UI\npatterns. But I often feel like many pattern libraries are little more than\nloosely arranged sprays of modules. I think there’s room for improvement.\n\n## In search of an interface design methodology\n\nFor us to create experiences for this eclectic web landscape, we must evolve\nbeyond the page metaphor that’s been with us since the birth of the web.\nThankfully, organizations are embracing modularity across every aspect of the\nweb creation process, which is leading to smarter work and more sustainable\nsystems.\n\nAs the number of devices, browsers, and environments continues to increase at\na staggering rate, the need to create thoughtful, deliberate interface design\nsystems is becoming more apparent than ever.\n\nEnter atomic design.\n\n\nArtboard 1Atomic Design MethodologyChapter 2Atoms, Molecules, Organisms,\nTemplates, and Pages\n\nMy search for a methodology to craft interface design systems led me to look\nfor inspiration in other fields and industries. Given this amazingly complex\nworld we’ve created, it seemed only natural that other fields would have\ntackled similar problems we could learn from and appropriate. As it turns out,\nloads of other fields [such as industrial design and\narchitecture](http://us5.campaign-\narchive1.com/?u=7e093c5cf4&id=ead8a72012&e=ecb25a3f93) have developed smart\nmodular systems for manufacturing immensely complex objects like airplanes,\nships, and skyscrapers.\n\nBut my original explorations kept creeping back to the natural world, which\ntriggered memories of sitting at a rickety desk in my high school’s chemistry\nlab.\n\n## Taking cues from chemistry\n\nMy high school chemistry class was taught by a no-nonsense Vietnam vet with an\nextraordinarily impressive mustache. Mr. Rae’s class had a reputation for\nbeing one of the hardest classes in school, largely because of an assignment\nthat required students to balance hundreds upon hundreds of chemical equations\ncontained in a massive worksheet.\n\nIf you’re like me, you may need a bit of a refresher to recall what a chemical\nequation looks like, so here you go:\n\n![An example of a chemical equation showing hydrogen and oxygen atoms\ncombining together to form a water molecule.](../Images/file15.jpg)\n\nAn example of a chemical equation showing hydrogen and oxygen atoms combining\ntogether to form a water molecule.\n\nChemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, which often show how\natomic elements combine together to form molecules. In the example above, we\nsee how hydrogen and oxygen combine together to form water molecules.\n\nIn the natural world, **atomic elements combine together to form molecules.\nThese molecules can combine further to form relatively complex organisms.** To\nexpound a bit further:\n\n  * **Atoms** are the basic building blocks of all matter. Each chemical element has distinct properties, and they can’t be broken down further without losing their meaning. (Yes, it’s true atoms are composed of even smaller bits like protons, electrons, and neutrons, but atoms are the smallest _functional_ unit.)\n  * **Molecules** are groups of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds. These combinations of atoms take on their own unique properties, and become more tangible and operational than atoms.\n  * **Organisms** are assemblies of molecules functioning together as a unit. These relatively complex structures can range from single-celled organisms all the way up to incredibly sophisticated organisms like human beings.\n\nOf course, I’m simplifying the incredibly rich composition of the universe,\nbut the basic gist remains: atoms combine together to form molecules, which\nfurther combine to form organisms. This atomic theory means that all matter in\nthe known universe can be broken down into a finite set of atomic elements:\n\n![The periodic table of chemical elements.](../Images/file16.png)\n\nThe periodic table of chemical elements.\n\nApparently Mr. Rae’s strategy of having students mind-numbingly balance tons\nof chemical equations worked, because I’m coming back to it all these years\nlater for inspiration on how to approach interface design.\n\n## The atomic design methodology\n\nBy now you may be wondering why we’re talking about atomic theory, and maybe\nyou’re even a bit angry at me for forcing you to relive memories of high\nschool chemistry class. But this is going somewhere, I promise.\n\nWe discussed earlier how all matter in the universe can be broken down into a\nfinite set of atomic elements. As it happens, our interfaces can be broken\ndown into a similar finite set of elements. [Josh Duck’s Periodic Table of\nHTML Elements](http://smm.zoomquiet.io/data/20110511083224/index.html)\nbeautifully articulates how all of our websites, apps, intranets,\nhoobadyboops, and whatevers are all composed of the same HTML elements.\n\n![The periodic table of HTML elements by Josh Duck.](../Images/file17.jpg)\n\nThe periodic table of HTML elements by Josh Duck.\n\nBecause we’re starting with a similar finite set of building blocks, we can\napply that same process that happens in the natural world to design and\ndevelop our user interfaces.\n\nEnter atomic design.\n\n**Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working\ntogether to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and\nhierarchical manner.** The five stages of atomic design are:\n\n  1. Atoms\n  2. Molecules\n  3. Organisms\n  4. Templates\n  5. Pages\n\n![Atomic design is atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages\nconcurrently working together to create effective interface design\nsystems.](../Images/file18.jpg)\n\nAtomic design is atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages\nconcurrently working together to create effective interface design systems.\n\n**Atomic design is not a linear process** , but rather a mental model to help\nus think of our user interfaces as both a cohesive whole and a collection of\nparts _at the same time_. Each of the five stages plays a key role in the\nhierarchy of our interface design systems. Let’s dive into each stage in a bit\nmore detail.\n\n## Atoms\n\n![Atomic Design Atoms](../Images/file19.jpg)\n\nIf atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, then the **atoms of our\ninterfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our\nuser interfaces**. These atoms include [basic HTML\nelements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) like form\nlabels, inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken down any further\nwithout ceasing to be functional.\n\n![Atoms include basic HTML tags like inputs, labels, and\nbuttons.](../Images/file20.jpg)\n\nAtoms include basic HTML tags like inputs, labels, and buttons.\n\nEach atom in the natural world has its own unique properties. A hydrogen atom\ncontains one electron, while a helium atom contains two. These intrinsic\nchemical properties have profound effects on their application (for example,\nthe Hindenburg explosion was so catastrophic because the airship was filled\nwith extremely flammable hydrogen gas versus inert helium gas). In the same\nmanner, each interface atom has its own unique properties, such as the\ndimensions of a hero image, or the font size of a primary heading. These\ninnate properties influence how each atom should be applied to the broader\nuser interface system.\n\nIn the context of a pattern library, atoms demonstrate all your base styles at\na glance, which can be a helpful reference to keep coming back to as you\ndevelop and maintain your design system. But like atoms in the natural world,\ninterface atoms don’t exist in a vacuum and only really come to life with\napplication.\n\n## Molecules\n\n![Atomic Design molecules](../Images/file21.jpg)\n\nIn chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together that take on\ndistinct new properties. For instance, water molecules and hydrogen peroxide\nmolecules have their own unique properties and behave quite differently, even\nthough they’re made up of the same atomic elements (hydrogen and oxygen).\n\nIn interfaces, **molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements\nfunctioning together as a unit**. For example, a form label, search input, and\nbutton can join together to create a search form molecule.\n\n![A search form molecule is composed of a label atom, input atom, and button\natom.](../Images/file22.jpg)\n\nA search form molecule is composed of a label atom, input atom, and button\natom.\n\nWhen combined, these abstract atoms suddenly have purpose. The label atom now\ndefines the input atom. Clicking the button atom now submits the form. The\nresult is a simple, portable, reusable component that can be dropped in\nanywhere search functionality is needed.\n\nNow, assembling elements into simple functioning groups is something we’ve\nalways done to construct user interfaces. But dedicating a stage in the atomic\ndesign methodology to these relatively simple components affords us a few key\ninsights.\n\nCreating simple components helps UI designers and developers adhere to the\n[single responsibility\nprinciple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), an\nage-old computer science precept that encourages a “do one thing and do it\nwell” mentality. Burdening a single pattern with too much complexity makes\nsoftware unwieldy. Therefore, creating simple UI molecules makes testing\neasier, encourages reusability, and promotes consistency throughout the\ninterface.\n\nNow we have simple, functional, reusable components that we can put into a\nbroader context. Enter organisms!\n\n## Organisms\n\n![Atomic Design organisms](../Images/file23.jpg)\n\n**Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of\nmolecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms**. These organisms form distinct\nsections of an interface.\n\nLet’s revisit our search form molecule. A search form can often be found in\nthe header of many web experiences, so let’s put that search form molecule\ninto the context of a header organism.\n\n![This header organism is composed of a search form molecule, logo atom, and\nprimary navigation molecule.](../Images/file24.jpg)\n\nThis header organism is composed of a search form molecule, logo atom, and\nprimary navigation molecule.\n\nThe header forms a standalone section of an interface, even though it contains\nseveral smaller pieces of interface with their own unique properties and\nfunctionality.\n\nOrganisms can consist of similar or different molecule types. A header\norganism might consist of dissimilar elements such as a logo image, primary\nnavigation list, and search form. We see these types of organisms on almost\nevery website we visit.\n\n![Organisms like website headers consist of smaller molecules like primary\nnavigation, search forms, utility navigation, and\nlogos.](../Images/file25.jpg)\n\nOrganisms like website headers consist of smaller molecules like primary\nnavigation, search forms, utility navigation, and logos.\n\nWhile some organisms might consist of different types of molecules, other\norganisms might consist of the same molecule repeated over and over again. For\ninstance, visit a category page of almost any e-commerce website and you’ll\nsee a listing of products displayed in some form of grid.\n\n![A product grid organism on Gap's e-commerce website consists of the same\nproduct item molecule repeated again and again.](../Images/file26.jpg)\n\nA product grid organism on Gap's e-commerce website consists of the same\nproduct item molecule repeated again and again.\n\nBuilding up from molecules to more elaborate organisms provides designers and\ndevelopers with an important sense of context. Organisms demonstrate those\nsmaller, simpler components in action and serve as distinct patterns that can\nbe used again and again. The product grid organism can be employed anywhere a\ngroup of products needs to be displayed, from category listings to search\nresults to related products.\n\nNow that we have organisms defined in our design system, we can break our\nchemistry analogy and apply all these components to something that resembles a\nweb page!\n\n## Templates\n\n![Atomic Design templates](../Images/file27.jpg)\n\nNow, friends, it’s time to say goodbye to our chemistry analogy. The language\nof atoms, molecules, and organisms carries with it a helpful hierarchy for us\nto deliberately construct the components of our design systems. But ultimately\nwe must step into language that is more appropriate for our final output and\nmakes more sense to our clients, bosses, and colleagues. Trying to carry the\nchemistry analogy too far might confuse your stakeholders and cause them to\nthink you’re a bit crazy. Trust me.\n\n**Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and\narticulate the design’s underlying content structure.** To build on our\nprevious example, we can take the header organism and apply it to a homepage\ntemplate.\n\n![The homepage template consists of organisms and molecules applied to a\nlayout.](../Images/file28.jpg)\n\nThe homepage template consists of organisms and molecules applied to a layout.\n\nThis homepage template displays all the necessary page components functioning\ntogether, which **provides context for these relatively abstract molecules and\norganisms**. When crafting an effective design system, it’s critical to\ndemonstrate how components look and function together in the context of a\nlayout to prove the parts add up to a well-functioning whole. We’ll discuss\nthis more in a bit.\n\nAnother important characteristic of templates is that they **focus on the\npage’s underlying content structure** rather than the page’s final content.\nDesign systems must account for the dynamic nature of content, so it’s very\nhelpful to articulate important properties of components like image sizes and\ncharacter lengths for headings and text passages.\n\nMark Boulton discusses the importance of defining the underlying content\nstructure of a page:\n\n> You can create good experiences without knowing the content. What you can’t\n> do is create good experiences without knowing your content structure. What\n> is your content _made_ from, not what your content _is_. [Mark\n> Boulton](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/structure-first-content-\n> always)\n\nBy defining a page’s skeleton we’re able to create a system that can account\nfor a variety of dynamic content, all while providing needed guardrails for\nthe types of content that populate certain design patterns. For example, the\nhomepage template for Time Inc. shows a few key components in action while\nalso demonstrating content structure regarding image sizes and character\nlengths:\n\n![Time Inc.'s homepage template demonstrates the content's underlying\nstructure.](../Images/file29.png)\n\nTime Inc.'s homepage template demonstrates the content's underlying structure.\n\nNow that we’ve established our pages’ skeletal system, let’s put some meat on\nthem bones!\n\n## Pages\n\n![Atomic design pages](../Images/file30.jpg)\n\n**Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like\nwith real representative content in place**. Building on our previous example,\nwe can take the homepage template and pour representative text, images, and\nmedia into the template to show real content in action.\n\n![The page stage replaces placeholder content with real representative content\nto bring the design system to life.](../Images/file31.jpg)\n\nThe page stage replaces placeholder content with real representative content\nto bring the design system to life.\n\nThe page stage is the most concrete stage of atomic design, and it’s important\nfor some rather obvious reasons. After all, this is what users will see and\ninteract with when they visit your experience. This is what your stakeholders\nwill sign off. And this is where you see all those components coming together\nto form a beautiful and functional user interface. Exciting!\n\nIn addition to demonstrating the final interface as your users will see it,\n**pages are essential for testing the effectiveness of the underlying design\nsystem**. It is at the page stage that we’re able to take a look at how all\nthose patterns hold up when real content is applied to the design system. Does\neverything look great and function as it should? If the answer is no, then we\ncan loop back and modify our molecules, organisms, and templates to better\naddress our content’s needs.\n\nWhen we pour real representative content into Time Inc.’s homepage template,\nwe’re able to see how all those underlying design patterns hold up.\n\n![At the page stage, we're able to see what Time Inc.'s homepage looks like\nwith real representative content in place. With actual content in place, we're\nable to see if the UI components making up the page properly serve the content\nbeing poured into them.](../Images/file32.jpg)\n\nAt the page stage, we're able to see what Time Inc.'s homepage looks like with\nreal representative content in place. With actual content in place, we're able\nto see if the UI components making up the page properly serve the content\nbeing poured into them.\n\nWe must create systems that establish reusable design patterns and also\naccurately reflect the reality of the content we’re putting inside of those\npatterns.\n\n**Pages also provide a place to articulate variations in templates** , which\nis crucial for establishing robust and reliant design systems. Here are just a\nfew examples of template variations:\n\n  * A user has one item in their shopping cart and another user has ten items in their cart.\n  * A web app’s dashboard typically shows recent activity, but that section is suppressed for first-time users.\n  * One article headline might be 40 characters long, while another article headline might be 340 characters long.\n  * Users with administrative privileges might see additional buttons and options on their dashboard compared to users who aren’t admins.\n\nIn all of these examples, the underlying templates are the same, but the user\ninterfaces change to reflect the dynamic nature of the content. These\nvariations directly influence how the underlying molecules, organisms, and\ntemplates are constructed. Therefore, creating pages that account for these\nvariations helps us create more resilient design systems.\n\nSo that’s atomic design! These five distinct stages concurrently work together\nto produce effective user interface design systems. To sum up atomic design in\na nutshell:\n\n  * **Atoms** are UI elements that can’t be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.\n  * **Molecules** are collections of atoms that form relatively simple UI components.\n  * **Organisms** are relatively complex components that form discrete sections of an interface.\n  * **Templates** place components within a layout and demonstrate the design’s underlying content structure.\n  * **Pages** apply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the final UI and test the resilience of the design system.\n\n## Advantages of atomic design\n\nSo why go through all this rigamarole? What’s atomic design good for? These\nare valid questions, considering we’ve been building user interfaces for a\nlong time now without having an explicit five-stage methodology in place. But\natomic design provides us with a few key insights that help us create more\neffective, deliberate UI design systems.\n\n### The part and the whole\n\n**One of the biggest advantages atomic design provides is the ability to\nquickly shift between abstract and concrete.** We can simultaneously see our\ninterfaces broken down to their atomic elements and also see how those\nelements combine together to form our final experiences.\n\n![Atomic design allows designers to traverse between abstract and\nconcrete.](../Images/file33.jpg)\n\nAtomic design allows designers to traverse between abstract and concrete.\n\nIn his book  _The Shape of Design_ , Frank Chimero beautifully articulates the\npower this traversal provides:\n\n> The painter, when at a distance from the easel, can assess and analyze the\n> whole of the work from this vantage. He scrutinizes and listens, chooses the\n> next stroke to make, then approaches the canvas to do it. Then, he steps\n> back again to see what he’s done in relation to the whole. It is a dance of\n> switching contexts, a pitter-patter pacing across the studio floor that\n> produces a tight feedback loop between mark-making and mark-assessing.\n> [Frank Chimero](http://read.shapeofdesignbook.com/chapter01.html)\n\nAtomic design lets us dance between contexts like the painter Frank so\neloquently describes. The atoms, molecules, and organisms that comprise our\ninterfaces do not live in a vacuum. And our interfaces’ templates and pages\nare indeed composed of smaller parts. The parts of our designs influence the\nwhole, and the whole influences the parts. The two are intertwined, and atomic\ndesign embraces this fact.\n\nWhen designers and developers are crafting a particular component, we are like\nthe painter at the canvas creating detailed strokes. When we are viewing those\ncomponents in the context of a layout with real representative content in\nplace, we are like the painter several feet back from the canvas assessing how\ntheir detailed strokes affect the whole composition. It’s necessary to zero in\non one particular component to ensure it is functional, usable, and beautiful.\nBut it’s also necessary to ensure that component is functional, usable, and\nbeautiful _in the context of the final UI_.\n\nAtomic design provides us a structure to navigate between the parts and the\nwhole of our UIs, which is why it’s crucial to reiterate that **atomic design\nis not a linear process**. It would be foolish to design buttons and other\nelements in isolation, then cross our fingers and hope everything comes\ntogether to form a cohesive whole. So don’t interpret the five stages of\natomic design as “Step 1: atoms; Step 2: molecules; Step 3: organisms; Step 4:\ntemplates; Step 5: pages.” Instead, **think of the stages of atomic design as\na mental model that allows us to concurrently create final UIs and their\nunderlying design systems**.\n\n### Clean separation between structure and content\n\nDiscussing _design_ and _content_ is a bit like discussing the _chicken_ and\nthe _egg_. Mark Boulton explains:\n\n> Content needs to be structured and structuring alters your content,\n> designing alters content. It’s not ‘content then design’, or ‘content or\n> design’. It’s ‘content and design’. [Mark\n> Boulton](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/structure-first-content-\n> always)\n\nA well-crafted design system caters to the content that lives inside it, and\nwell-crafted content is aware of how it’s presented in the context of a UI.\nThe interface patterns we establish must accurately reflect the nature of the\ntext, images, and other content that live inside them. Similarly, our content\nshould be aware of the manner in which it will be presented. The close\nrelationship between content and design requires us to consider both as we\nconstruct our UIs.\n\nAtomic design gives us a language for discussing the structure of our UI\npatterns and also the content that goes inside those patterns. While there is\na clean separation between the content structure skeleton (templates) and the\nfinal content (pages), atomic design recognizes the two very much influence\neach other. For instance, take the following example:\n\n![Content skeleton and final content](../Images/file34.jpg)\n\nOn the left we see the UI’s content skeleton, which consists of the same\n_person block molecule_ repeated again and again. On the right we see what\nhappens when we populate each instance of the person block molecule with\nrepresentative content. Visualizing the content skeleton and the\nrepresentative final content allows us to create patterns that accurately\nreflect the content that lives inside them. If a person’s name were to wrap\nonto five lines within the pattern, we would need to address that broken\nbehavior at a more atomic level.\n\nThe content we pour into our UIs at the page stage will influence the\ncharacteristics and parameters of the underlying design patterns.\n\n### What’s in a name?\n\nThroughout this book I’ve mentioned that modular design and development is\nnothing new. So why are we introducing terms like _atoms_ , _molecules_ , and\n_organisms_ when we can just stick with established terms like _modules_ ,\n_components_ , _elements_ , _sections_ , and _regions_?\n\nFor as long as I’ve been talking about atomic design, I’ve had people proffer\nalternate names for the stages of the methodology. Person One would suggest,\n“Why not just name them elements, modules, and components?” while Person Two\nwould suggest, “Why not just name them base, components, and modules?” The\nissue with terms like components and modules is that a sense of hierarchy\ncan’t be deduced from the names alone. **Atoms, molecules, and organisms imply\na hierarchy** that anyone with a basic knowledge of chemistry can hopefully\nwrap their head around.\n\nThat being said, naming things is hard and imperfect. The names I’ve chosen\nfor the stages of atomic design have worked really well for me and the teams\nI’ve worked with as we create UI design systems. But maybe they don’t work for\nyou and your organization. That’s more than OK. Here’s one perspective from\nthe design team at GE:\n\n> As we showed our initial design system concepts that used the Atomic Design\n> taxonomy to our colleagues, we were met with the some confused looks. […]\n> The evidence was clear, for this to be successful within our organization we\n> had to make the taxonomy more approachable. [Jeff Crossman, GE\n> Design](https://medium.com/ge-design/ges-predix-design-\n> system-8236d47b0891#.uo68yjo9g)\n\nThe taxonomy the team landed on were “Principles”, “Basics”, “Components”,\n“Templates”, “Features”, and “Applications”. Do these labels make sense to\nyou? It doesn’t matter. By establishing a taxonomy that made sense for their\norganization, everyone was able to get on board with atomic design principles\nand do effective work together.\n\n“Atomic design” as a buzzword encapsulates the concepts of modular design and\ndevelopment, which becomes a useful shorthand for convincing stakeholders and\ntalking with colleagues. But **atomic design is not rigid dogma**. Ultimately,\nwhatever taxonomy you choose to work with should help you and your\norganization communicate more effectively in order to craft an amazing UI\ndesign system.\n\n## Atomic design is for user interfaces\n\nAtomic design is a concept born of the web. After all, your lowly author is a\nweb designer, which is mainly the reason this book primarily focuses on web-\nbased interfaces. But it’s important to understand that **atomic design\napplies to all user interfaces, not just web-based ones.**\n\nYou can apply the atomic design methodology to the user interface of any\nsoftware: Microsoft Word, Keynote, Photoshop, your bank’s ATM, whatever. To\ndemonstrate, let’s apply atomic design to the native mobile app Instagram.\n\n![Atomic design applied to the native mobile app\nInstagram.](../Images/file35.jpg)\n\nAtomic design applied to the native mobile app Instagram.\n\nLet’s walk through this atomized Instagram interface:\n\n  * **Atoms** : This screen of Instagram’s UI consists of a handful of icons, some text-level elements, and two image types: the primary image and the user’s avatar image.\n  * **Molecules** : Several icons form simple utilitarian components like the bottom navigation bar and the photo actions bar where users can like or comment on a photo. Also, simple combinations of text and/or images form relatively simple components.\n  * **Organisms** : Here we can see the photo organism take shape, which consists of the user’s information, time stamp, the photo itself, actions around that photo, and information about the photo including like count and caption. This organism becomes the cornerstone of the entire Instagram experience as it is stacked repeatedly in a never-ending stream of user-generated photos.\n  * **Templates** : We get to see our components come together in the context of a layout. Also, it’s here where we see the exposed content skeleton of the Instagram experience, highlighting dynamic content such as the user’s handle, avatar, photo, like count, and caption.\n  * **Pages** : And finally we see the final product, complete with real content poured into it, which helps ensure the underlying design system comes together to form a beautiful and functional UI.\n\nI show this non-web example because atomic design tends to get misinterpreted\nas an approach to web-specific technologies like CSS and JavaScript. Let me be\nclear about this: **atomic design has nothing to do with web-specific subjects\nlike CSS or JavaScript architecture**. In chapter 1 we discussed the trend\ntoward modularity in all aspects of design and development, which includes CSS\nand JavaScript. These are fantastic trends in CSS and JavaScript, but atomic\ndesign deals with crafting user interface design systems irrespective of the\ntechnology used to create them.\n\n## Atomic design in theory and in practice\n\nThis chapter introduced the atomic design methodology and demonstrated how\natoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages all work together to craft\nthoughtful, deliberate interface design systems. Atomic design allows us to\nsee our UIs broken down to their atomic elements, and also allows us to\nsimultaneously step through how those elements join together to form our final\nUIs. We learned about the tight bond between content and design, and how\natomic design allows us to craft design systems that are tailored to the\ncontent that lives inside them. And finally we learned how the language of\natomic design gives us a helpful shorthand for discussing modularity with our\ncolleagues, and provides a much needed sense of hierarchy in our design\nsystems.\n\nAtomic design is a helpful design and development methodology, but essentially\nit’s merely a mental model for constructing a UI. By now you may be wondering\n_how_ you make atomic design happen. Well, fear not, dear reader, because the\nrest of the book focuses on tools and processes to make your atomic design\ndreams come true.\n\n\nArtboard 1Tools of the TradeChapter 3Pattern Lab and the qualities of\neffective style guides\n\nIn the previous chapter, I introduced the atomic design methodology for\nconstructing user interfaces. I hope you’ll find atomic design to be a helpful\nmental model for constructing UI design systems, but now it’s time to climb\ndown from the ivory tower and actually put atomic design into practice _in the\nreal world_.\n\nThe cornerstone of pattern-based design and development is the pattern\nlibrary, which serves as a centralized hub of all the UI components that\ncomprise your user interface. As we discussed in chapter 1, the benefits of\npattern libraries are many:\n\n  * They **promote consistency and cohesion** across the entire experience.\n  * They **speed up your team’s workflow** , saving time and money.\n  * They **establish a more collaborative workflow** between all disciplines involved in a project.\n  * They **establish a shared vocabulary** between everyone in an organization, including outside vendors.\n  * They **provide helpful documentation** to help educate stakeholders, colleagues, and even third parties.\n  * They **make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier**.\n  * They **serve as a future-friendly foundation** for teams to modify, extend, and improve on over time.\n\nThat all sounds wonderful, right? I can almost hear you saying, “I need this\nwhole pattern library thing in my life.” But how do we make pattern libraries\nhappen? Well, you’ve come to the right place, friend, because the rest of this\nbook is dedicated to exactly that. This chapter will introduce helpful tools\nfor creating pattern libraries, the next chapter will discuss how to make\npatterns a cornerstone of your design and development workflow, and the fifth\nchapter will cover how to make your design system stand the test of time.\n\nThis chapter will talk about the qualities of effective pattern libraries\nthrough the lens of a tool called [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io), an open\nsource project maintained by web developers [Dave Olsen](http://dmolsen.com),\n[Brian Muenzenmeyer](http://www.brianmuenzenmeyer.com/), and me to execute\natomic design systems. While I’ll excitedly discuss Pattern Lab and its\nvarious features, I want to stress that the point of this chapter is to cover\nthe characteristics of well-constructed pattern libraries, not sell any one\nspecific tool to you. Hell, Pattern Lab isn’t even for sale! No single tool\nwill be a perfect fit for every setup and scenario, but be sure to keep the\nfollowing principles in mind when deciding what tools to use to create your\npattern libraries.\n\n## Just what exactly is Pattern Lab?\n\nBefore we dive into the nuts and bolts of how Pattern Lab works, it’s\nimportant to take time to explain what the tool is and isn’t.\n\n### Pattern Lab is…\n\n  * a static site generator tool for building atomic design systems.\n  * a pattern documentation and annotation tool.\n  * a pattern starter kit.\n\n### Pattern Lab isn’t…\n\n  * a UI framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.\n  * language-, library-, or style-dependent.\n  * a replacement for a content management system.\n\nLet’s walk through these points, starting with the term _static site\ngenerator_. Static site generator tools take in some source code and assets,\ncompile them, and spit out plain ol’ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at the other\nend. **Pattern Lab takes source code – namely patterns — and compiles those\npatterns into a functional front-end UI inside a pattern library shell**.\n\nSo what does Pattern Lab look like out of the box? Drumroll, please.\n\n![One default Pattern Lab dashboard. What it lacks in good looks, it makes up\nfor in utility.](../Images/file36.png)\n\nOne default Pattern Lab dashboard. What it lacks in good looks, it makes up\nfor in utility.\n\nNot a terribly inspiring design, eh? Believe it or not, this minimal (one\nmight even say _lack of_) design is deliberate. To avoid incorrect\nclassification as a UI framework like Bootstrap, the design is deliberately\nstripped down so no one would mistakenly take Pattern Lab’s demo UI for\nsuggested styles. Pattern Lab doesn’t give you any answers as to how to design\nor architect your front-end code— _you have to do all that work yourself_. The\nlook and feel, naming conventions, syntax, structure, libraries, and scripts\nyou choose to use to create your UI are entirely up to you and your team.\nHeck, you can even use UI frameworks like Bootstrap _within_ Pattern Lab.\nPattern Lab is just there to help stitch everything together.\n\nAs a technical aside, Pattern Lab uses either PHP or Node.js as the engine\nthat stitches patterns together and generates the pattern library. However,\nyou don’t need to be a PHP wizard or Node guru to use Pattern Lab any more\nthan you have to know how to build an internal combustion engine to drive a\ncar. Moreover, your final website doesn’t have to be built with PHP or Node to\nuse the tool, as Pattern Lab’s output is backend-agnostic HTML, CSS, and\nJavaScript. So like any technology decision, choose a pattern library tool\nthat fits with your organization’s infrastructure and jives with how your team\nworks together.\n\nIf that all sounded like gibberish to you, don’t worry. This chapter focuses\non the overarching features of Pattern Lab and principles of effective pattern\nlibraries rather than going too far down the technical rabbit hole. If\ninterested, you can check out [Pattern Lab’s\ndocumentation](http://patternlab.io/docs/) to dive into the nitty-gritty.\n\n## Building atomic design systems with Pattern Lab\n\nTo understand the core concept behind Pattern Lab, you need to understand\nRussian nesting dolls.\n\n![Russian nesting dolls](../Images/file37.jpg)\n\nRussian nesting dolls. Image credit: [Tromal on\nFlickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tromal/6901848291/)\n\nMatryoshka dolls (also known as Russian nesting dolls) are beautifully carved\nhollow wooden dolls of increasing size that are placed inside one another.\nPatterns in Pattern Lab operate in a similar manner: the smallest patterns\n(atoms) are included inside bigger patterns (molecules), which are included in\neven bigger patterns (organisms), which are in turn included in even bigger\npatterns (templates).\n\nConstructing UIs in this manner keeps things\n[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), which is a long-\nstanding computer science principle that stands for “don’t repeat yourself.”\nWhat this means is that you can make a change to a pattern, and anywhere that\npattern is employed will magically update with those changes. This Russian\nnesting doll approach considerably speeds up your workflow, and certainly\nbeats the pants off sifting through hundreds of Photoshop documents for every\ninstance of a pattern in order to make a simple change.\n\nTo make this happen, Pattern Lab uses the _include_ feature of\n[Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/), a logicless templating language.\nHere’s what a Mustache include looks like:\n\n    \n    \n    {{> atom-thumbnail }}\n    \n\nThis is Mustache code, in case the double curly braces (`{{}}`) that look like\nlittle mustaches didn’t give it away. The greater-than symbol (`>`) is\nMustache’s way of telling Pattern Lab to include an atom pattern called\n“thumbnail”. Pattern Lab will go searching through its folders of patterns to\nfind an atom named “thumbnail”.\n\n![This is what Pattern Lab's patterns folder structure can look like. You can\nname and categorize these folders however you'd like, including changing the\nlabels “atoms”, “molecules”, and “organisms”, “templates”, and ”pages”. The\nmost important consideration is to establish naming and categorization that is\nmost effective for your team.](../Images/file38.png)\n\nThis is what Pattern Lab's patterns folder structure can look like. You can\nname and categorize these folders however you'd like, including changing the\nlabels “atoms”, “molecules”, and “organisms”, “templates”, and ”pages”. The\nmost important consideration is to establish naming and categorization that is\nmost effective for your team.\n\nNow that we know what an include looks like, let’s put it into practice and\ntake a look at a few patterns from a website I helped make for Time Inc.\nHere’s one reusable pattern we designed:\n\n![For Time Inc.'s website, we created a basic block molecule consisting of a\nthumbnail image, headline, and excerpt.](../Images/file39.png)\n\nFor Time Inc.'s website, we created a basic block molecule consisting of a\nthumbnail image, headline, and excerpt.\n\nThis pattern should look fairly familiar. A thumbnail image, headline, and\nexcerpt working together as a single unit is a common pattern found on\ncountless websites. Let’s take a peek behind the curtain to see how this\npattern is constructed.\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"block-post\">\n        <a href=\"{{ url }}\">\n            {{> atoms-thumb }}\n            <h3>{{ headline }}</h3>\n           <p>{{ excerpt }}</p>\n        </a>\n    </div>\n    \n\nYou can see we have: HTML markup consisting of a wrapper `div` with a class\nname of `block-post`; a link; a Mustache include for the thumbnail image; an\n`<h3>` element for the headline; and a `<p>` tag for the excerpt. You’ll\nnotice there’s more Mustache code for `url`, `headline`, and `excerpt`, which\nwe’ll use later to dynamically swap in actual content. More on that in a bit.\n\nNow that our pattern markup is established, we can include that chunk of code\nin bigger patterns using the same include method:\n\n    \n    \n    {{> molecules-block-post }}\n\nNow let’s move up to more complex organisms like the website’s header, which\nlooks a little something like this:\n\n![The website header consists of fairly common conventions like a logo atom,\nprimary navigation molecule, and a search form\nmolecule.](../Images/file40.jpg)\n\nThe website header consists of fairly common conventions like a logo atom,\nprimary navigation molecule, and a search form molecule.\n\nWhen we crack open the hood to look at the header’s markup in Pattern Lab, we\nsee the following:\n\n    \n    \n    <header role=\"banner\">\n        {{> atoms-logo }}\n        {{> molecules-primary-nav }}\n        {{> molecules-search }}\n    </header>\n    \n\nWhat’s going on here? Well, we have a basic `<header>` element, and inside\nthat element we’re including the logo image atom, the primary navigation\nmolecule, and the search form molecule.\n\nAnd now we can include that relatively complex pattern anywhere we need it.\n\n    \n    \n    {{> organisms-header }}\n\nI hope by now you can see the Russian nesting dolls in action. The smallest\natoms are included in bigger molecules, and those molecules get included in\neven bigger organisms. Now let’s take these components and plug them into a\nlayout. Take the homepage template, for instance:\n\n![The Time Inc. homepage template consists of a few repeatable patterns: a\nglobal header, a hero area, a few sections \\(containing an image, headline,\nexcerpt, and call to action\\), an area featuring four items, a factoid area,\nand a global footer.](../Images/file41.png)\n\nThe Time Inc. homepage template consists of a few repeatable patterns: a\nglobal header, a hero area, a few sections (containing an image, headline,\nexcerpt, and call to action), an area featuring four items, a factoid area,\nand a global footer.\n\nTake a quick stroll through the homepage template and you’ll see some pretty\nstandard patterns: a site header at the top, a site footer at the bottom, and\na full-screen hero area. You’ll also see a few other patterns repeating\nthemselves throughout the template.\n\nSo how does this look in code? As you might expect, it involves more includes!\n\n    \n    \n    {{> organisms-header }}\n    <main role=\"main\">\n        {{# hero }}\n        {{> molecules-hero }}\n        {{/ hero }}\n        <section>\n            {{# experience-block }}\n            {{> molecules-block-main }}\n            {{/ experience-block }}\n            {{# experience-feature }}\n            {{> organisms-story-feature }}\n            {{/ experience-feature }}\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            {{# factoid-advertising }}\n            {{> organisms-factoid }}\n            {{/ factoid-advertising }}\n        </section>\n        <section>\n            {{# advertising }}\n            {{> molecules-block-main }}\n            {{/ advertising }}\n        </section>\n        …\n    </main>\n    {{> organisms-footer }}\n    \n\nAt this stage in the game the smaller patterns are already constructed, so all\nthe template needs to do is pull them into the context of a page layout and\ngive them unique names.\n\nTaking a closer look at the code, notice that certain patterns like `{{>\norganisms-header }}` and `{{> organisms-footer }}` are included the same way\nas the earlier examples. But there are also a few other includes patterns that\nare supplemented by some additional information, like the following:\n\n    \n    \n    {{# factoid-advertising }}\n    {{> organisms-factoid }}\n    {{/ factoid-advertising }}\n\nWe’re including `organisms-factoid` in the same way as all the other patterns,\nbut we’re also naming it `factoid-advertising` by wrapping the include in a\nMustache _section_ , indicated by the Mustache code containing the `#` and `/`\nsymbols. By giving the pattern instance a unique name, we can latch on to it\nand dynamically replace the content of the pattern. More on that in the next\nsection!\n\nThis Russian nesting doll approach to building UIs is simple but tremendously\npowerful. The structure allows designers and developers to keep patterns DRY,\nsaving time, effort, and money. The approach allows teams to build a final UI\nwhile simultaneously creating the underlying UI design system. After all, the\nfinal interface is one instantiation of its underlying design system. Teams\ncan also move between abstract and concrete, zeroing in on a particular\npattern to fix bugs (“The header’s broken!”), while also seeing how changes to\nsmall patterns affect the overall page layout.\n\n## Working with dynamic data\n\nIt’s important to articulate the underlying content structure of UI patterns\nwithin the context of a pattern library. That’s why we’ve been looking at\ndimension-displaying grayscale images and placeholder text containing\ncharacter limits. But while this information is helpful for creative teams,\ngrayscale images and _Lorem ipsum_ text are not what users interact with on\nyour actual site. We need a way to replace our dummy content with real\nrepresentative content to ensure our UI patterns match the reality of the\ncontent that lives inside them.\n\nTo demonstrate how Pattern Lab dynamically swaps in real content into\ntemplates, let’s take a look at a side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.’s\nhomepage template and page levels:\n\n![A side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.'s homepage template and page levels.\nThe template articulates the content structure of the design system, while the\npage shows what the system looks like with real content displayed by\nit.](../Images/file42.jpg)\n\nA side-by-side comparison of Time Inc.'s homepage template and page levels.\nThe template articulates the content structure of the design system, while the\npage shows what the system looks like with real content displayed by it.\n\nOn the left we have the template level, which articulates the content\nstructure of the patterns making up the web page. And on the right we have the\npage level, where we’re pouring in real representative content to demonstrate\nwhat the final UI might look like and test the effectiveness of the design\nsystem.\n\nHow do we swap dummy content for real content in Pattern Lab? Pattern Lab uses\nJSON (as well as YAML, Markdown, and other data formats) to define and swap\nout the dynamic bits of content in our designs.\n\nThe default placeholder data is defined in a file called _data.json_ that\nlives in Pattern Lab’s _/source_ directory. Inside this file we define all the\ntext, image paths, and other dynamic data that will make up our UI. Here’s a\nsmall sample from Time Inc.’s _data.json_ file:\n\n    \n    \n    \"hero\" : {\n      \"headline\": \"Lorem Ipsum\",\n      \"img\": {\n        \"src\": \"/images/sample/fpo_hero.png\",\n        \"alt\": \"Hero Image\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nFor developers, this type of format most likely looks familiar. If you’re not\na developer, don’t freak out! Once you look beyond the curly braces and\nquotes, you’ll see that we’re defining a `hero` object (for the full-bleed\nhero area directly below the header) that has a `headline` value of “Lorem\nIpsum”, and an `img` with a `src` value of “/images/sample/fpo_hero.png”.\nWe’re simply defining this object’s attributes and providing values for those\nattributes.\n\nOnce those objects are defined, we can then override their attributes at\nPattern Lab’s page level. This is accomplished by creating a new JSON file\nthat matches the page pattern name (for Time Inc.’s homepage, we’ll call it\n_00-homepage.json_) inside the _/pages_ directory.\n\n![Inside the ‘pages’ directory we have the homepage pattern as well as a JSON\nfile that matches the name of the pattern. This is where we'll override the\ndefault content with page-specific content.](../Images/file43.png)\n\nInside the ‘pages’ directory we have the homepage pattern as well as a JSON\nfile that matches the name of the pattern. This is where we'll override the\ndefault content with page-specific content.\n\nWhen we open up _00-homepage.json_ we can override the placeholder data we\nestablished earlier. Here’s what that might look like:\n\n    \n    \n    \"hero\" : {\n      \"headline\": \"Moving People\",\n      \"img\": {\n        \"src\": \"/images/hero_beyonce.jpg\",\n        \"alt\": \"Beyonce\"\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nBy overriding the default data, the `hero` headline now reads “Moving People”\ninstead of “Lorem Ipsum.” And instead of pointing to a grayscale for-\nplacement-only (FPO) hero image, we’re now pointing to a picture of Beyoncé\nlocated at “/images/hero_beyonce.jpg”.\n\nThis process of establishing defaults for dynamic data then replacing them\nwith page-specific content continues for each section of the website. In\naddition to replacing simple strings like headings, we can also dynamically\nset variables to `true` or `false`, loop through an array of items, and more.\nWe can even dramatically alter the UI with just a few changes to a JSON file,\nwhich we’ll talk about next.\n\n## Articulating pattern variations with pseudo-patterns\n\nHistorically, designers working with static tools have had a tendency to only\ndesign best-case scenarios. You know what I’m talking about: the user’s name\nis Sara Smith and always fits neatly on one line; her profile picture looks\nlike it was clipped out of a magazine; her profile is completely filled out;\nthe two columns of her profile content are exactly the same height.\n\nOf course, these best-case scenarios rarely, if ever, occur in the real world.\n\n**To create more robust and resilient designs, we need to concurrently account\nfor the best situations and the worst – and everything in between.**\n\nWhat if the user doesn’t upload a profile picture? What if the user has 87\nitems in their shopping cart? What if the product has 14 options? What if the\nblog post title contains 400 characters? What about a returning user? A first-\ntime user? What if the article doesn’t have any comments? What if it has seven\nlayers of nested comments? What if we need to display an urgent message on the\ndashboard?\n\nArticulating these UI variations in a static design tool is an exercise in\ntediousness and redundancy, which may explain why they’re rarely designed. But\nif we want to create systems that address all the variables and realities of\nour content, we must take those ‘what if’ questions into account.\n\nHow do we address all manner of UI variation without exhausting ourselves in\nthe process? Pattern Lab’s _[pseudo-\npattern](http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-pseudo-patterns.html)_ feature\nallows us to articulate sometimes wildly different scenarios with just a few\nchanges to our data.\n\nLet’s say we’re making an app whose dashboard displays a list of project\ncollaborators. The UI might look something like this:\n\n![A list of project collaborators in our hypothetical\napp.](../Images/file44.jpg)\n\nA list of project collaborators in our hypothetical app.\n\nTo create the dynamic content inside each of these blocks, we’ll define our\nlist of collaborators as an array inside _dashboard.json_ :\n\n    \n    \n    \"collaborators\" : [\n      {\n        \"img\": \"/images/sample/avatar1.jpg\",\n        \"name\" : \"Steve Boomshakalaka\",\n        \"title\" : \"CIA\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"img\": \"/images/sample/avatar2.jpg\",\n        \"name\" : \"Gingersnap Jujubees-Daniels\",\n        \"title\" : \"President of the Longest Company Name in the World Corporation, Global Division\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"img\": \"/images/sample/avatar3.jpg\",\n        \"name\" : \"Sarunus Marciulionis\",\n        \"title\" : \"Golden State Warriors\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"img\": \"/images/sample/avatar4.jpg\",\n        \"name\" : \"Sara Smith\",\n        \"title\" : \"Short Title\"\n      }\n    ]\n    \n\nBy default, our design assumes the user is a regular user and not an\nadministrator, but what if we wanted to give administrators the ability to\nmanage project collaborators from the dashboard? That UI might look something\nlike this:\n\n![The administrator's dashboard UI introduces extra edit and delete\nactions.](../Images/file45.jpg)\n\nThe administrator's dashboard UI introduces extra edit and delete actions.\n\nTo show additional admin edit and delete actions on the dashboard in Pattern\nLab, we can create a pseudo-pattern, a new file in the _pages_ folder that\nlooks like this:\n\n    \n    \n    dashboard~admin.json\n\nThe tilde (`~`) symbol indicates a pseudo-pattern. _dashboard~admin.json_ will\ninherit all the data contained in _dashboard.json_ , but also gives us the\nopportunity to append or override additional data. That means the list of\ncollaborators we defined earlier in _dashboard.json_ is still available, but\nwe can add additional data inside _dashboard~admin.json_ like so:\n\n    \n    \n    \"isAdmin\" : true\n    \n\nWe’re defining a variable called `isAdmin` and setting it to `true`. We can\nnow use that to conditionally include the additional actions inside the block\npattern.\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"block\">\n      <img src=\"{{ img }}\" alt=\"{{ name }}\" />\n      <h3>{{ name }}</h3>\n      <h4>{{ title }}</h4>\n      {{# isAdmin }}\n      {{> molecules-block-actions }}\n      {{/ isAdmin }}\n    </div>\n    \n\nThe first few lines are pulling in the `img`, `name`, and `title` we defined\nin _dashboard.json_. But pay close attention to what’s wrapped in the\n`isAdmin` Mustache section. What we’re saying here is: if `isAdmin` is set to\n`true`, include a molecule pattern called `block-actions`. The `block-actions`\npattern contains the edit and delete buttons, and will only display if\n`isAdmin` is set to `true` (or anything besides `false`). In our default\n_dashboard.json_ , `isAdmin` isn’t set, so the extra actions won’t display. In\n_dashboard~admin.json_ , we’re setting `isAdmin` to `true` so the extra\nactions will display. You can extend this technique to dramatically alter the\nentire UI (like altering the primary navigation, showing additional panels on\nthe dashboard, adding extra controls, and so on) just by changing a single\nvariable. Powerful stuff, indeed.\n\nWhew. If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You now know how to add and\nmanipulate dynamic data in Pattern Lab. Pattern Lab’s ability to design with\ndynamic data provides some crucial benefits:\n\n  * **Creates a clear separation between structure and content.** A pattern’s structure and its content very much influence each other. However, resilient design systems strive to establish agnostic, flexible patterns that can contain a variety of content. Decoupling pattern structure and data allows us to keep things DRY (which, again, stands for don’t repeat yourself) and make changes to content without affecting the pattern structure. Likewise, we’re able to make changes to a pattern without having to update every instance of that pattern simply because each instance contains different data. This separation results in huge savings in both time and effort.\n  * **Establishes an ad hoc CMS.** Establishing default and page-specific data serves as an ad hoc content management system. As mentioned earlier, static design tools aren’t well equipped to handle dynamic data, but it’s also overkill to install WordPress, Drupal, or some other CMS just to demonstrate UI variations. Pattern Lab strikes a balance as it allows teams to work with dynamic data but doesn’t require setting up any crazy MySQL databases.\n  * **Serves as a blueprint for back-end developers** responsible for integrating the front-end UI into a real content management system. Back-end developers can look at the UI created in Pattern Lab, understand which bits are static and dynamic, then translate that into the back-end system.\n  * **Allows writers, content people, designers, and other non-developers to contribute to the living, breathing design system.** As a front-end developer, I can’t count the number of times I’ve had to fix typos, swap in new images, translate copy decks, and make other content-related edits to front-end code. It’s death by a million paper cuts, and I’m sure most developers would agree that making minor copy changes isn’t an effective use of their time. By separating structure and data, Pattern Lab enables non-developer team members to safely manage the content-related aspects of the design, freeing up developers to focus on building the design system’s structure.\n\nWe’ve now covered Pattern Lab’s core functionality, but we’re not done yet!\nNext we’ll cover a few additional features that should be considered,\nirrespective of the tool you use to create your pattern library.\n\n## Viewport tools for flexible patterns\n\nThe multitude of devices now accessing the web has forced designers to re-\nembrace the intrinsic fluidity of the medium. Thankfully, techniques like\n[responsive web design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)\nallow us to create layouts that look and function beautifully on any screen.\n\nIt’s a no-brainer that we need to establish flexible UI patterns if we want to\ncreate responsive designs, but creating fluid patterns has additional\nadvantages. **The more fluid a UI component is, the more resilient and\nversatile it becomes.** Imagine being able to take a component — let’s say a\nphoto gallery slider — and plunk it anywhere we need it. Sometimes we may need\nit to be a full-bleed element occupying the entire viewport. Other times we\nmay need to include it in the context of an article. And still other times we\nmay want to include it in the sidebar. The dream is to build our components\nfluidly and they’ll adapt their styles and functionality to fit whatever\ncontainers we put them into.\n\nIndeed, this is the promise of [container\nqueries](http://alistapart.com/article/container-queries-once-more-unto-the-\nbreach). Container queries let elements adapt based on their parent containers\nrather than the entire viewport, which is how we manipulate elements using\nmedia queries at the moment. While still being developed as a native browser\ncapability, container queries will allow us pattern-crazed designers and\ndevelopers to easily create and deploy fluid UI systems.\n\nBetween responsive design, container queries, and good ol’-fashioned common\nsense, we now understand why it’s imperative to create flexible UI patterns.\nBut how do we do that? And how can our pattern library tools help us think and\nact flexibly?\n\nMany early responsive design testing tools focused on viewing designs on\npopular mobile device widths, such as 320px (an iPhone 4 in portrait mode),\n480px (an iPhone 4 in landscape mode), 768px (an iPad in portrait mode), and\nso on. But, of course, the web is _much_ more diverse than a mobile view, a\ntablet view, and a desktop view. To help designers better consider the entire\nresolution spectrum when testing their responsive designs, I created a tool\ncalled [ish.](http://bradfrost.com/demo/ish/)\n\nThe tool is called _ish._ because selecting the small button results in a\nsmall-ish viewport. Selecting it again provides a different small-ish\nviewport. Selecting the medium button gives you a medium-ish viewport. And the\nlarge button results in a—wait for it—large-ish viewport. These randomized\nvalues help designers and developers better consider the entire resolution\nspectrum rather than a handful of popular device dimensions.\n\nIsh. is baked into Pattern Lab, which means we can view our UIs and their\nunderlying patterns across the entire resolution spectrum.\n\n![Pattern Lab displaying a design in a small-ish\nviewport.](../Images/file46.jpg)\n\nPattern Lab displaying a design in a small-ish viewport.\n\n![Pattern Lab displaying a design in a medium-ish\nviewport.](../Images/file47.jpg)\n\nPattern Lab displaying a design in a medium-ish viewport.\n\n![Pattern Lab displaying a design in a large-ish\nviewport.](../Images/file48.jpg)\n\nPattern Lab displaying a design in a large-ish viewport.\n\nWhile ish. helps designers and developers uncover bugs along the viewport\ncontinuum, I’ve found it to be more helpful as a client and colleague\neducation tool. By building a device-agnostic viewport resizing tool directly\ninto the pattern library, clients and colleagues can come to appreciate the\nfact that their design system should look and function well no matter the\nviewport size.\n\n## A look under the hood with code view\n\nA common pattern library feature is the ability to peek under the hood and\nview the underlying code that makes up a particular component. Exposing a UI\npattern’s code speeds up development time (I love copying and pasting as much\nas the next coder) and helps team leaders enforce code syntax and style\nconventions. This becomes especially rewarding when a ton of developers are\nworking on an organization’s codebase.\n\nThe types of code to be highlighted in a pattern library naturally vary from\norganization to organization, in order to meet the requirements of the vast\narray of environments, technologies, and conventions used. Most [pattern\nlibraries out there in the wild](http://styleguides.io/examples.html)\ndemonstrate a pattern’s underlying HTML, while others also include pattern-\nspecific CSS and JavaScript. Salesforce’s Lightning design system, for\nexample, shows a pattern’s HTML as well as all the (S)CSS pertaining to that\npattern.\n\n![Salesforce's Lightning design system showcases the UI components' HTML and\nSCSS code.](../Images/file49.png)\n\nSalesforce's Lightning design system showcases the UI components' HTML and\nSCSS code.\n\nIncluding front-end code leads to authors writing it more consistently, but\nthat doesn’t guarantee perfection. There’s still room for developers to go\nrogue and write sloppy, incongruent code—which is why some organizations have\ngone above and beyond to establish incredibly sophisticated design systems.\nCompanies like Lonely Planet have achieved the holy grail of pattern\nlibraries, which is to say **their pattern library and production environment\nare perfectly in sync**. We’ll discuss the holy grail in more detail in\nchapter 5, but it’s worth bringing up in this section to demonstrate how that\naffects the code exposed in the context of a pattern library. Rather than\noffering HTML and CSS, Lonely Planet’s [Rizzo style\nguide](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/) surfaces the include code for teams to\npull in the appropriate UI component.\n\n![Lonely Planet's Rizzo design system pattern library showcases the template\nusage.](../Images/file50.png)\n\nLonely Planet's Rizzo design system pattern library showcases the template\nusage.\n\nThis setup allows the core development team to maintain a single source of\ntruth for all patterns’ front-end code. For developers to get up and running,\nthe pattern library needs only provide the code to include a particular\npattern.\n\nPattern Lab provides the ability to view both a pattern’s underlying HTML and\nthe template code used to generate the HTML. It can also be extended to\nshowcase accompanying CSS and JavaScript code.\n\n![Pattern Lab's code view demonstrates both a pattern's template code and the\ncompiled HTML.](../Images/file51.png)\n\nPattern Lab's code view demonstrates both a pattern's template code and the\ncompiled HTML.\n\nUltimately, whichever pattern library tool you decide to use should have some\nform of code view. Perhaps more importantly, the pattern libraries you create\nshould showcase the types of code that enable you and your development team to\nbe as effective as possible.\n\n## Living documentation and annotations\n\nIn a traditional siloed design process, it’s typical to see lengthy wireframe\nand spec documents created, debated, and approved. These documents usually\ntake the form of gigantic PDFs, which is unfortunate considering they often\ncontain all sorts of valuable insights, instructions, and documentation about\nthe design system. Sadly, these bulky artifacts are often thrown into a\n(virtual) trash can by the time the project makes its way into production.\n\nThis shouldn’t be the case. A UI’s documentation should contain insights from\nevery discipline involved in creating it, and—this is key—should be baked into\nthe living, breathing design system. Effective pattern libraries carve out a\nspace to define and describe UI components, articulating considerations\nranging from accessibility to performance to aesthetics and beyond.\n\nPattern Lab provides several ways to add pattern descriptions and annotations\nto a design system. Pattern descriptions can be added by creating a Markdown\nfile that corresponds to the name of a pattern (e.g. _pattern-name.md_), which\nwill show the pattern description in the library list view.\n\n![Pattern Lab displays important pattern documentation right alongside the\nliving pattern examples, which helps teams communicate definitions, usage,\nexamples, outside resources, and more.](../Images/file52.png)\n\nPattern Lab displays important pattern documentation right alongside the\nliving pattern examples, which helps teams communicate definitions, usage,\nexamples, outside resources, and more.\n\nPattern Lab also provides a (dare I say) cool feature that enables you to\nattach annotations to any UI element and view those annotations in the context\nof the living, breathing design. When annotations are switched on, each\nannotated element receives a number which, when clicked, jumps you to the\ncorresponding annotation. This allows teams to view pattern considerations\nwithin the context of the full UI. Pretty neat!\n\n![Pattern Lab's annotation feature is interactive and baked into the living\nUI.](../Images/file53.jpg)\n\nPattern Lab's annotation feature is interactive and baked into the living UI.\n\n## Providing context with pattern lineage\n\nWhen looking at various patterns in a library, I’ve found myself wondering,\n“Great, but where is this component actually used?” Defining and describing\npattern characteristics is one thing, but there’s an opportunity to provide\nadditional contextual information about your UI patterns.\n\nThanks to the Russian nesting doll include approach described earlier, Pattern\nLab can display what patterns make up any given component, and also show where\nthose patterns are employed in the design system.\n\n![Pattern Lab's lineage feature displays what patterns make up any component,\nand also shows all the places that component is\nemployed.](../Images/file54.png)\n\nPattern Lab's lineage feature displays what patterns make up any component,\nand also shows all the places that component is employed.\n\nIn the example above, we have a molecule pattern called `media-block`, which\ncontains an image, headline, text, and a group of buttons. Looking at the\npattern’s lineage, we can see it contains a pattern called `atoms-square`,\nwhich is the thumbnail-sized image, as well as `molecules-button-bar`, which\nis the group of buttons. We can also see where exactly this pattern gets used:\nthe `media-block-list` organism.\n\nThis contextual information is amazingly helpful for designers and developers;\nI know I use the lineage feature _all the time_ in my own workflow. Let’s say\nwe wanted to make changes to a particular pattern, like doubling the size of\nan image or adding an additional element: **we’d immediately know which\npatterns and templates would need to be retested and QA’d to ensure nothing\nbreaks with the changes**. The lineage feature also helps point out redundant\nand underused patterns so teams can weed them out of the pattern library as\nthe launch date gets closer.\n\n## To each their own\n\nSo there you have it. Pattern Lab provides several helpful features for teams\nto create deliberate, thoughtful design systems. But as I mentioned before, no\nsingle tool is going to be perfect for everyone and every situation. There are\n[a ton of great tools](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) out there to help you\ncreate effective pattern libraries, and the tools you decide on will\nundoubtedly be influenced by your organization’s environment, technologies,\nworkflow, and culture.\n\nWhen choosing tools to create your pattern library, you should keep your eyes\nopen for these qualities and features of effective pattern libraries:\n\n  * Providing pattern descriptions and annotations.\n  * Showcasing the relevant pattern HTML, templating, CSS, and/or JavaScript code.\n  * Viewing patterns across the entire resolution spectrum.\n  * The ability to showcase pattern variations, such as active or disabled tabs.\n  * The ability to dynamically add real representative content into the patterns’ structures.\n  * Providing contextual information, like which patterns make up a particular component, as well as where that component is used.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s not about the tools we use to create pattern\nlibraries, but rather how we use them. Creating and maintaining an effective\ndesign system means dramatically changing your organization’s culture,\nprocesses, and workflows. If that sounds hard to you, it’s because it is. But\nfear not! The rest of the book will detail the entire process of creating and\nmaintaining a successful design system to set your organization up for long-\nterm success.\n\n\nArtboard 1The Atomic WorkflowChapter 4People, process, and making design\nsystems happen\n\nTalk is cheap. And up until now, we’ve been doing a whole lotta talkin’.\nThat’s not to say it hasn’t been productive talk! After all, we’ve discussed\nthe importance of modular thinking, we’ve learned a methodology for crafting\ndeliberate UI design systems, and we’ve showcased tools for creating effective\npattern libraries.\n\nBut here’s where the rubber meets the road. Where we roll up our sleeves and\nput all of this theory into practice. Where we _get stuff done_. This chapter\nwill tackle all that goes into selling, creating, and maintaining effective\ndesign systems. You ready? Let’s go.\n\n## It’s people!\n\nThe not-so-secret secret about creating effective design systems (or doing any\ngreat work, really): **it all comes down to people truly collaborating and\ncommunicating with one another**.\n\nIf this is such common knowledge, why aren’t we constantly hearing thousands\nof success stories from around the world? I’ll let Mark Boulton explain:\n\n> The design process is weird and complicated, because _people_ are weird and\n> complicated. Mark Boulton\n\nYou can have all the right technologies in place, use the latest and greatest\ntools, and even have extraordinarily talented individuals on board, but if\neveryone involved isn’t actually cooperating and communicating with one\nanother then you’re not going to create great work. It’s as simple as that.\nThat’s not to say you can’t create _good_ work, but more often than not you’re\ngoing to create _one of the many disappointing shades of bad_ work.\n\nEstablishing and maintaining successful interface design systems requires an\norganization-wide effort, and this chapter will discuss how to overcome human\nbeings’ many quirks to make them happen.\n\n## When to establish a design system\n\nSo when’s the best time to establish an interface design system? Short answer:\n_now_.\n\nDesign systems and their accompanying pattern libraries are often created in\nconjunction with a new design or redesign project, replatforming effort, or\nother initiative. Piggybacking off another project is a great way to sneak a\npattern library into your organization.\n\nThat being said, creating a design system and pattern library doesn’t\nnecessarily need to coincide with another project. If you can convince your\nclients and stakeholders to pony up the cash and resources for a dedicated\ndesign system project, then good on you!\n\nHow exactly do you sell a design system to your clients, bosses, colleagues,\nand stakeholders? Put on your business hat, because we’re going to tackle that\nin the next section!\n\n## Pitching patterns\n\nIntroducing a new way of doing things is no easy task, as it requires changing\npeople’s existing mentalities and behaviors. Getting stakeholders and clients\non board with establishing a design system involves constant education, in\naddition to a bit of marketing savvy.\n\nFirst things first. It’s necessary to introduce the concept of interface\ndesign systems to your clients, colleagues, and stakeholders. Explain what\nthese design systems are and the many ways they can help the organization.\nWe’ve discussed these benefits throughout the book, so you can explain how\ndesign systems **promote consistency and cohesion** , **speed up your team’s\nproductivity** , **establish a more collaborative workflow** , **establish a\nshared vocabulary** , **provide helpful documentation** , **make testing\neasier** , and **serve as a future-friendly foundation**. Who can say no to\nall that!?\n\nAlas, I’ve found that I can hype design systems until I’m blue in the face,\nbut the suits don’t always see things through the same lens as the people on\nthe ground. A simple reframing of the question helps immensely. It’s much more\neffective to simply ask, “**Do you like saving time and money? Yes or no?** ”\nIf the answer to that question is _no_ , I’m afraid you have way bigger\nproblems than selling a design system. If the answer is _yes_ , then you can\npitch the benefits through the lens of time and money. Let’s try this out,\nshall we?\n\n  * Design systems **lead to cohesive, consistent experiences**. That means users master your UI faster, leading to more conversions and **more money** based on the metrics your stakeholders care about.\n  * Design systems **speed up your team’s workflow**. Rather than reinventing the wheel every time a new request comes through, teams can reuse already established UI puzzle pieces to roll out new pages and features faster than ever before.\n  * Centralizing UI components in a pattern library **establishes a shared vocabulary** for everyone in the organization, and **creates a more collaborative workflow** across all disciplines. With everyone speaking the same language, more time is spent getting work done and less time is spent dealing with superfluous back-and-forth communications and meetings.\n  * Design systems **make cross-browser/device, performance, and accessibility testing easier** , vastly speeding up production time and allowing teams to launch higher-quality work faster. Also, baking things like accessibility into a living design system scales those best practices, allowing your interfaces to reach more users while reducing the risk of you getting sued!\n\n  * Once a design system (with accompanying pattern library) is established, it **serves as a future-friendly foundation** for the organization to modify, tweak, extend, and improve on over time. Doing some A/B testing? Roll the lessons from those tests into the living design system. Made some big performance optimizations? Roll them into the living design system! The _living_ part of living design systems means they can always adapt to meet the future needs of the organization, saving time and money all the while.\n\nFraming things in terms of time and money helps the people controlling the\npurse strings understand why a design system is a worthwhile pursuit. With any\nluck, these conversations will translate to a concrete commitment from the\norganization (read: allocating real time and money) to make a design system\nhappen.\n\n## Show, don’t tell: the power of interface inventories\n\nIf only getting buy-in were as easy as having a few well-timed conversations\nwith the right people. Maybe you’re savvy enough to seal the deal with talking\npoints alone, but for us mere mortals words aren’t enough. Sometimes you need\nmore. Sometimes you need to make them _feel the pain_.\n\nEnter the interface inventory.\n\nMany are familiar with the concept of a [content\ninventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_inventory). Content audits\nare usually performed in the early stages of a website redesign process to\ntake stock of all a site’s content. It’s a tedious process involving\nspreadsheets and caffeine, but all that hard work pays off. By the end of the\nexercise the organization’s content is laid out on the table, giving teams\nvaluable insights into how to handle their content as they tackle the project.\n\nAn interface inventory is similar to a content inventory, only instead of\nsifting through and categorizing content, you’re taking stock of and\ncategorizing all the components that make up your user interface. **An\ninterface inventory is a comprehensive collection of the bits and pieces that\nmake up your user interface.**\n\n![Here's a collection of all the unique button styles found on the homepage of\nUnited.com. An interface inventory rounds up and categorizes all the unique\npatterns that make up an interface.](../Images/file55.jpg)\n\nHere's a collection of all the unique button styles found on the homepage of\nUnited.com. An interface inventory rounds up and categorizes all the unique\npatterns that make up an interface.\n\n### Conducting an interface audit\n\nHow do you go about conducting an interface audit? How do you round up all the\ncomponents that make up your UI? The simple answer is _screenshots_. Lots of\nthem! Creating an interface inventory requires screenshotting and loosely\ncategorizing all the unique components that make up your user interfaces.\nWhile that’s a relatively straightforward endeavor, there are some important\nconsiderations to keep in mind to make the inventory as useful as possible.\nLet’s go through the process for creating a successful interface inventory.\n\n#### Step 1: Round up the troops\n\nI’ve encountered many ambitious designers and developers who have taken it\nupon themselves to start documenting their organization’s UI patterns. While I\ncertainly applaud this individual ambition, **it’s absolutely essential to get\nall members of the team to experience the pain of an inconsistent UI for them\nto start thinking systematically**.\n\nFor the interface inventory to be as effective as possible, **representatives\nfrom all disciplines responsible for the success of the site should be in a\nroom together** for the exercise. Round up the troops: UX designers, visual\ndesigners, front-end developers, back-end developers, copywriters, content\nstrategists, project managers, business owners, QA, and any other\nstakeholders. The more the merrier! After all, one of the most crucial results\nof this exercise is to establish a shared vocabulary for everyone in the\norganization, and that requires input from the entire team.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare for screenshotting\n\nThe interface inventory exercise generates a ton of screenshots, so naturally\nyou’ll need software to capture and display those screenshots. Some possible\ntools include:\n\n  * PowerPoint or Keynote\n  * Photoshop or Sketch\n  * Evernote Web Clipper\n  * Google Docs or Microsoft Word\n  * Google Slides (If you’re interested, I’ve created a [Google Slides interface inventory template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GqFmiDV_NqKi36fXAwD3WTJL5-JV-gHL7XVD2fVeL0M/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n![It's important for all participants to capture screenshots using the same\nsoftware so they can be combined later. I've created a Google Slides interface\ninventory template for teams to use as a starting\npoint.](../Images/file56.png)\n\nIt's important for all participants to capture screenshots using the same\nsoftware so they can be combined later. I've created a Google Slides interface\ninventory template for teams to use as a starting point.\n\nUltimately, it doesn’t really matter what tool you use, but everyone should\nagree on a single tool to make it easier to combine at the end of the\nexercise. I’ve found online slide-building software like Google Slides to be\nvery effective as it provides a canvas for free-form image positioning,\nthey’re chunked out into slides for easier categorization, and they’re web-\nbased so can be shared with ease.\n\n#### Step 3: Screenshot exercise\n\nGet your screenshotting fingers ready because it’s time for the main event!\n**The interface audit exercise involves screenshotting and categorizing all\nthe unique UI patterns that make up your experience.** Bear in mind this\nexercise doesn’t mean capturing _every instance_ of a particular UI pattern,\nbut rather capturing _one instance of each_ unique UI pattern.\n\nAssign each participant a UI category. You may need to pair people or have\nparticipants document multiple categories, depending on how many people are\ntaking part in the exercise. Once again, it’s helpful to have as many\nparticipants as possible since more people screenshotting will result in more\nthorough documentation.\n\n##### What patterns to capture\n\nWhat interface element categories should be captured? Obviously, the\ncategories are going to vary from interface to interface, but here are a few\ncategories to start with:\n\n  * **Global elements** : components like headers, footers, and other global elements that are shared across the entire experience.\n  * **Navigation** : primary navigation, footer navigation, pagination, breadcrumbs, interactive component controls, and essentially anything that’s used to navigate around a user interface.\n  * **Image types** : logos, hero images, avatars, thumbnails, backgrounds, and any other type of image pattern that shows up in the UI.\n  * **Icons** : icons are a special type of image worthy of their own category. Capture magnifying glasses, social icons, arrows, hamburgers, spinners, favicons, and every other interface icon.\n  * **Forms** : inputs, text areas, select menus, checkboxes, switches, radio buttons, sliders, and other forms of user input.\n  * **Buttons** : buttons are the quintessential UI element. Capture all the unique button patterns found throughout the experience: primary, secondary, big, small, disabled, active, loading, and even buttons that look like text links.\n  * **Headings** : `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6` and variations of typographic headings.\n  * **Blocks** : also known as touts, callouts, summaries, ads, or hero units, _blocks_ are collections of typographic headings and/or images and/or summary text (see Nicole Sullivan’s write-up about the _[media object](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)_ as an example of a block).\n  * **Lists** : unordered, ordered, definition, bulleted, numbered, lined, striped, or any group of elements presented in a list-type format.\n  * **Interactive components** : accordions, tabs, carousels, and other functional modules with moving parts.\n  * **Media** : video players, audio players and other rich media elements.\n  * **Third-party components** : widgets, iframes, stock tickers, social buttons, [invisible tracking scripts](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/surfacing-invisible-elements/), and anything else that isn’t hosted on your domain.\n  * **Advertising** : all ad formats and dimensions.\n  * **Messaging** : alerts, success, errors, warnings, validation, loaders, popups, tooltips, and so on. This can be a challenging category to capture as messaging often requires user action to expose.\n  * **Colors** : capture all unique colors presented in the interface. This category can be aided by fantastic style guide bootstrapping tools like [CSS Stats](http://cssstats.com/) and [Stylify Me](http://stylifyme.com/).\n  * **Animation** : animation is an elemental aspect of user interfaces, and should therefore be documented. This requires using screen recording software such as QuickTime to capture any UI element that moves, fades, shakes, transitions, or shimmies across the screen.\n\n![An example of various form elements captured in an interface inventory for a\nmajor bank's website.](../Images/file57.png)\n\nAn example of various form elements captured in an interface inventory for a\nmajor bank's website.\n\n![An example of unique button patterns captured in an interface inventory for\na major bank's website.](../Images/file58.png)\n\nAn example of unique button patterns captured in an interface inventory for a\nmajor bank's website.\n\nAgain, these categories aren’t set in stone and will vary based on the nature\nof the user interface you’re dealing with. Of course, it’s important to add,\nsubtract, or modify these categories to best fit your organizational needs.\n\n##### Timing is everything\n\nIt’s important to set time limits on the screenshotting exercise to avoid\ngoing down a rabbit hole that ends up lasting all day. The amount of time you\nallocate will vary depending on how many people are participating, but I find\nbetween **30 and 90 minutes** to be sufficient for a first pass of an\ninterface inventory. Set a timer, throw on some Jeopardy! music (well, maybe\nnot Jeopardy! music, but some other music that sets an upbeat mood for the\nexercise), and have the participants concentrate on screenshotting the unique\nUI patterns they encounter.\n\n##### Dig deep\n\nWhich parts of the site should participants capture in the interface\ninventory? Short answer: _everything_. Any piece of UI that is or could be\nmanaged by your organization should be documented.\n\nThis is difficult as organizations tend to favor certain parts of the\nexperience (_cough_ homepage _cough_) over others. For example, people working\non an e-commerce website tend to focus on the core shopping experience, even\nthough areas like customer support, FAQs, sizing charts, 404 pages, and legal\nterms are also extremely important to the user experience. Remember, users\nperceive your brand as a singular entity and don’t care about your\norganizational structure, tech stack, or anything else that might cause\ndisparities in the UI. Encourage interface audit participants to be as\nthorough as possible during the exercise.\n\n#### Step 4: Present findings\n\nThe screenshotting exercise can be a bit overwhelming, so be sure the team\ntakes a break after the exercise is complete. Get some food, grab some coffee,\nand stretch your legs for a bit. Once everyone’s feeling refreshed, it’s time\nto discuss what you captured.\n\nHave each participant spend five or ten minutes presenting each UI category to\nthe group. Here’s where the fun begins. Presenting to the group allows the\nteam to discuss the rationale behind existing UI patterns, kick-starts a\nconversation about naming conventions, and gets the team excited to establish\na more consistent interface.\n\n**Naming things is hard.** It’s fascinating to hear the inconsistent names\ndesigners, developers, product owners, and other stakeholders all have for the\nsame UI pattern. “Oh, we call that the utility bar.” “Oh, we call it the admin\nnav.” “Oh, we call it the floating action area!” This exercise is an\nopportunity to unearth and iron out disparities between pattern labels, and\nalso establish names for previously unlabeled patterns. Don’t feel like you\nneed to come to a consensus on patterns’ final names in the course of ten\nminutes; this exercise is simply meant to open up a broader discussion.\n\nOnce every category has been presented and discussed, all the participants\nshould send their slides to the exercise leader. The leader will then combine\neverything into one giant über-document, which will soon become a wrecking\nball of truth and justice.\n\n#### Step 5: Regroup and establish next steps\n\nWith the über-document in hand, it’s time to get the entire organization on\nboard with crafting an interface design system.\n\nHave you ever wanted to see a CEO cry? Laying bare all your UI’s\ninconsistencies is a great way to make that happen! **One of the most powerful\nbenefits of interface inventories is that you can show them to anyone,\nincluding non-designers and developers, and they’ll understand why\ninconsistent UIs are problematic.** You don’t need to be a designer to\nrecognize that having 37 unique button styles probably isn’t a good idea.\nHere’s your opportunity to make it crystal clear to stakeholders that\napproaching your UI in a more systematic way makes great sense for both your\nusers and your organization.\n\nIn addition to selling the idea to key stakeholders, **all the hard work and\ndiscussion that went into the initial interface inventory exercise should be\ntranslated into the seeds of your future design system and pattern library**.\n\nIt’s very likely the initial exercise didn’t capture every unique UI pattern,\nso you may need to conduct another interface audit exercise to capture a more\ncomplete picture of your UI patterns. This may involve a large group again,\nbut in reality a smaller, cross-disciplinary team will be going through the\nüber-document and establishing next steps for the design system.\n\nOnce the gaps in the interface inventory have been filled, the working group\ncan have some important conversations about next steps for the design system\nproject. Some key questions for this group to cover include:\n\n  * Which patterns should stay, which should go, and which can be merged together?\n  * What pattern names should we settle on?\n  * What are the next steps to translate the interface inventory into a living pattern library?\n\n### Benefits of an interface inventory\n\nCreating an interface inventory can be quite an undertaking, but the benefits\nof making one are many:\n\n  * **Captures all patterns and their inconsistencies** : an interface inventory rounds up all the unique patterns that make up your UI. Seeing all those similar, but still different, patterns next to each other exposes redundancy and underscores the need to create a consistent, cohesive experience.\n  * **Gets organizational buy-in** : having a large, diverse group of disciplines participate in the exercise helps everyone understand the value of creating and maintaining a consistent user interface. Also, the interface inventory über-document can be a tremendously powerful tool for convincing stakeholders, bosses, and clients to invest in an interface design system.\n  * **Establishes a scope of work** : an interface inventory helps design teams determine the level of effort required to design and build each UI pattern as part of a design or redesign project. Which components will be relatively easy or difficult to convert into a responsive environment? What are the content, design, and development considerations around each component? An interface inventory enables teams to have important conversations that help establish a project’s realistic scope and timeline.\n  * **Lays the groundwork to a sound interface design system** : the interface inventory is an important first step for setting up a comprehensive pattern library. It’s essential to capture all existing UI patterns to determine which patterns will make the final cut in the living design system. The interface audit exercise also helps teams establish a shared vocabulary, which will be crucial for the success of the eventual design system.\n\n### Ask forgiveness, not permission\n\nSo you’ve discussed the benefits of establishing a living design system with\nyour stakeholders, and you’ve even created an interface inventory to show them\nthe inconsistent train wreck that is the current UI. And yet, despite all your\nefforts, they still shoot down the sound idea of establishing an interface\ndesign system and pattern library. What’s a responsible web team to do?\n\n**Do it anyways.**\n\nJust how we build things like performance, accessibility, and responsiveness\ninto our products and process by default, we should also create design systems\nby default. You don’t need to get the client’s blessing to follow your craft’s\nbest practices. When you give stakeholders the option to say no to something,\nthey will. So simply don’t give them that opportunity. **Our job is to create\ngreat work for our clients and organizations, and interface design systems are\na means to that end.**\n\nIn fact, **to create the whole, you need to create the parts of that whole**.\nOur interfaces consist of smaller pieces, whether you pay those smaller pieces\nany mind or not.\n\nYou have a decision to make: focus solely on creating the whole while ignoring\nthe parts, or spend some time organizing the parts to help you more\nefficiently create the whole. In his book _[Multiscreen UX\nDesign](http://store.elsevier.com/Multiscreen-UX-Design/Wolfram-\nNagel/isbn-9780128027295/)_ , Wolfram Nagel wonderfully articulates these\napproaches using Lego bricks as an analogy.\n\nOne way to approach a Lego project is to simply dump the pieces out of the box\nonto a table, roll up your sleeves, then start building your creation.\n\n![One way to approach a Lego project is to simply dump the pieces out onto a\ntable, and rummage through the pile to find the pieces you need. Image adapted\nfrom *Multiscreen UX Design* by Wolfram Nagel.](../Images/file59.jpg)\n\nOne way to approach a Lego project is to simply dump the pieces out onto a\ntable, and rummage through the pile to find the pieces you need. Image adapted\nfrom *Multiscreen UX Design* by Wolfram Nagel.\n\nThis approach to a Lego project is certainly a viable strategy, even if it is\nunapologetically haphazard. The only time you’d pay attention to the pile of\nbricks is when you’re sifting through it to find the specific piece you need.\n\nThis is not dissimilar to how many digital projects are approached. The client\nneeds a website, so we jump in to designing and building it. The client needs\na mobile app, so we immediately start building the screens of the app. Our\ngaze remains transfixed on the final product, and we rarely, if ever, glance\nat the underlying patterns that comprise our final UIs.\n\nOf course, there is another way to approach your Lego and digital projects.\nRather than diving headfirst into constructing the final work, you can take\nthe time to take stock of the available pieces and organize them in such a way\nthat they become more useful.\n\n![Taking the time to organize the pieces that make up your final creations\nallows you to approach the work in a more deliberate and efficient manner.\nImage adapted from *Multiscreen UX Design* by Wolfram\nNagel.](../Images/file60.jpg)\n\nTaking the time to organize the pieces that make up your final creations\nallows you to approach the work in a more deliberate and efficient manner.\nImage adapted from *Multiscreen UX Design* by Wolfram Nagel.\n\nNo doubt organizing takes time, planning, and effort. It doesn’t come for\nfree. The fact that this configuring isn’t visibly represented in the final\nproduct may tempt us to say it serves as a distraction to the real work that\nneeds to be done. Why bother?\n\n**By taking the time to organize the parts, you can now create the whole in a\nmore realistic, deliberate, and efficient manner.** Creating a library of your\navailable materials allows you to approach the project in a more methodical\nway, and saves immense amounts of time in the process. Rather than rummaging\nthrough a haphazard pile of bricks and burning time reinventing patterns, you\ncan create an organized system of components that will help produce better\nwork in a shorter amount of time.\n\n![Taking the time to organize the pieces that make up your final creations\nallows you to work in a more deliberate and efficient manner. Rather than\nsifting through a haphazard pile of bricks, an organized inventory of\ncomponents can produce better, faster work.

Rather than\nsifting through a haphazard pile of bricks, an organized inventory of\ncomponents can produce better, faster work. Image adapted from *Multiscreen UX\nDesign* by Wolfram Nagel.\n\nAs far as your clients and stakeholders are concerned, the final product is\nstill being produced. So long as you’re showing progress on the final work,\nyou can decide how much of your internal process you’re willing to expose. The\nfact that you’re creating a design system to produce the final product is\nreally of no concern to them; it’s simply a decision your team is making to\ncreate better work.\n\nIf you’re dealing with change-averse stakeholders, I say do what you need to\ndo and tell them to pay no attention to what’s happening behind the scenes.\nOnce you’ve successfully launched the project and the champagne has been\npoured, you can pull back the curtain and say, “Oh, by the way, we established\na design system and pattern library so the team could collaborate and work\nmore efficiently together.” It would be extremely difficult for them to argue\nagainst you now, especially if the project came in on time and on budget. If\nyou’re really lucky, you can parlay the initial project’s success into a more\nofficial initiative within the organization to evolve your design system.\n\nOf course, it’s preferable to get your clients, colleagues, and stakeholders\nexcited about creating an interface design system, or at the very least get\ntheir blessing to pursue the project in a modular fashion. But I think it’s\nimportant to find ways to follow your craft’s best practices even when you’re\nfaced with extreme organizational resistance.\n\n## (Re)setting expectations\n\nYou’ve put in a lot of hard work to sell the concept of a design system, but\nyou still need to set stakeholder and team expectations before you roll up\nyour sleeves and get to work.\n\nWhen I say “set expectations” I’m really saying “ _re_ set expectations.” You\nsee, we all bring our own experiences, opinions, and biases to a project. Our\nindustry is still incredibly young, so many people working on web projects are\ncoming from other industries with their own established Ways Of Doing Things™.\nEven people who have worked exclusively in the digital world have felt the\nbaggage of industries past. Moreover, the guiding principles, best practices,\nand tactics of digital design are still very much being codified.\n\n**It’s ludicrous for anyone to utter the phrase, “This is how we’ve always\ndone things” in an industry that’s only 25 years old.** Unfortunately, we\nhumans are creatures of habit, and stepping outside familiarity’s warm embrace\nis uncomfortable. We don’t like being uncomfortable. We must overcome our\nexisting predispositions if we’re going to embrace our ever shifting\nindustry’s best practices and create successful digital work.\n\n### Redefining design\n\nWe’ve come a long way from simply transplanting print PDFs to the World Wide\nWeb, but **print design still casts a long shadow and continues to influence\nhow things get done online**.\n\nDesign in the print world focuses heavily on visual aesthetics. After all, you\ncan’t do much more with a poster than look at it. To be clear, I’m certainly\nnot implying print design is easy or one-dimensional; the world of print is\nsteeped in nuance and craft. What I am saying is that **the bidirectional and\ninteractive nature of the web adds many more dimensions to what constitutes\ngood design**. Speed, screen size, environment, technological capabilities,\nform-factor, ergonomics, usability, accessibility, context, and user\npreferences must be considered if we want to create great work for this brave\nnew digital world.\n\nThese additional design considerations are vital for creating great digital\nwork, yet they are too often absent from our processes and workflows. Designer\nDan Mall explains:\n\n> As an industry, we sell websites like paintings. Instead, we should be\n> selling beautiful and easy access to content, agnostic of device, screen\n> size, or context. [Dan Mall](http://danielmall.com/articles/the-post-psd-\n> era/)\n\nHow did we get to the point where we sell and design websites like they’re\nstatic images? During the formative years of the web we created experiences\nmeant to be consumed solely by desktop computers, which is understandable\nsince desktops were really the only game in town. The real estate provided by\ndesktop screens made the idea of simply translating a PDF onto the web\nfeasible and enticing. So that’s what we did—and for a while it actually\nworked!\n\n![Once upon a time, the web was primarily consumed on desktop screens, hence\nthis crusty-looking, old machine.](../Images/file62.jpg)\n\nOnce upon a time, the web was primarily consumed on desktop screens, hence\nthis crusty-looking, old machine.\n\nHowever, this didn’t come without consequences. This print-like perspective of\nthe web reinforced the notion that web designs, like their offline\ncounterparts, could and should look the same in every environment. It also\nkept the focus on how a web design _looked_ rather than how it _worked_ ,\nignoring all the unique characteristics of this rich new medium. Moreover, it\nstrengthened the belief that we could apply the same linear processes used to\ncreate print work to our digital work.\n\nTime went by, of course, and mobile exploded, technology improved, and the web\nbecome the incredibly large and diverse landscape we know today. Gone are the\ndesktop-only days of yore, and in their place is a time of smartphones, dumb\nphones, tablets, phablets, netbooks, notebooks, e-readers, wearables, TVs,\ngame consoles, car dashboards, and so much more.\n\n![This is the web: a potpourri of devices, screen sizes, capabilities, form\nfactors, network speeds, input types, and more.](../Images/file63.jpg)\n\nThis is the web: a potpourri of devices, screen sizes, capabilities, form\nfactors, network speeds, input types, and more.\n\nThe diversity of today’s web landscape has shattered the [consensual\nhallucination](https://adactio.com/journal/4443) of the desktop web, where we\ncould simply bolt on the mentalities and processes of print to this new\nmedium. Simply looking at a smartphone, tablet, and desktop machine next to\none another quickly erodes the assumption that a web design should look the\nsame in every environment.\n\nWe’re still at the very beginning of the Big Bang of connected devices. The\ndevice and web landscape of tomorrow will undoubtedly be even bigger and\ndiverse than today’s. In addition to current devices and the nascent\ntechnologies already on the horizon, the future web will involve technologies\nand ideas that haven’t yet been conceived.\n\n![In addition to all the web-capable devices we concern ourselves with today,\nwe must understand that the device and web landscape is becoming bigger and\nmore diverse all the time.](../Images/file64.jpg)\n\nIn addition to all the web-capable devices we concern ourselves with today, we\nmust understand that the device and web landscape is becoming bigger and more\ndiverse all the time.\n\n**I’ve found the three previous images to be a tremendously helpful shorthand\nfor helping clients, colleagues, and stakeholders understand the reality of\nthe web landscape.** With this newfound understanding, everyone becomes a\nwhole lot more receptive to updating their processes and workflows to create\ngreat work for this unique medium.\n\nIt’s our job to create great experiences for people using a diversity of\ndevices, screen sizes, network speeds, device capabilities, browser features,\ninput types, form factors, contexts, and preferences. That’s undoubtedly a\nHerculean task, but all these variables really underscore the need to extend\nfar beyond visual aesthetics when creating interface design systems.\n\nIn addition to making visually beautiful and consistent experiences, we\nshould:\n\n  * **Embrace the ubiquity of the web** by creating accessible, resilient design systems. Recognize that a whole slew of people with a vast spectrum of capabilities will be accessing our experiences, so construct design systems to be as inclusive as possible.\n  * **Create flexible layouts and components** so our interfaces look and function beautifully irrespective of any particular device dimension or screen size.\n  * **Treat performance as an essential design principle** and create fast-loading experiences that respect users and their time.\n  * **Progressively enhance our interfaces** by establishing core experiences then layering on enhancements to take advantage of the unique capabilities of modern devices and browsers.\n  * **Create future-friendly design systems** meant to stand the test of time and anticipate inevitable changes to the device and web landscape.\n\nOf course, there are many other design considerations that should be included\nin our interface design systems (ergonomics, input type, Section 508\ncompliance, legibility, and so on), but the key takeaway here is to expand the\ndefinition of what constitutes good digital design beyond visual aesthetics.\n\nAs you might expect, substantial changes to our processes need to happen so we\ncan properly address all these uniquely digital design considerations. It\ntherefore becomes our responsibility to set client, colleague, and stakeholder\nexpectations so that everyone knows the process for creating will be different\nthis time around.\n\n### Death to the waterfall\n\nTell me if you’ve heard this one before. A team is tasked with making a\nwebsite. Once the kick-off meeting dust has settled, a UX designer goes away,\nputs their head down, and eventually emerges with a giant PDF document\ndetailing the entire experience. This monolithic wireframe document gets\npassed around to the project stakeholders, who sign it off after some feedback\nand suggestions.\n\nThe UX designer then passes the wireframes to the visual designer, who hops\ninto Photoshop or Sketch to apply color, typography, and texture to the\nstructured-but-sterile wireframes. In the design review meeting, stakeholders\nsit eagerly while the projector fires up and the project manager runs off to\nprint copies of the design deck for everyone. The art director takes their\nposition at the front of the room and unveils the design. Behold, a website\ndesign! Once the presentation is finished, the room quickly buzzes with\nfeedback and conversation. After the initial reactions and compliments die\ndown, a key stakeholder speaks up.\n\n“This looks fantastic, and I think really hits the mark for what we’re trying\nto accomplish with this project. _But…_ ”\n\nThey express their desire to see something perhaps with an alternate layout,\nsomething that captures a certain vibe, maybe something that uses different\nphotography, something that just… _pops_.\n\nWith the floodgates opened, the other stakeholders suddenly realize they too\nhave opinions and constructive criticism they’d like to share. By the time the\nmeeting draws to a close, everyone has rambled off their wish list of what\nthey’d like the design to accomplish.\n\nSlightly deflated but determined to nail it, the visual designer retreats back\nto their tools to work in the stakeholders’ suggestions. At the next design\nreview meeting, the same scene repeats itself, with stakeholders expressing\nequal parts encouragement and longing for more. “I feel like we’re almost\nthere. Could we just…”\n\nWeeks pass and seasons change. Nerves wear thin, and the deadline date looms\nover everyone’s heads. It’s with a sense of urgency that\n_homepage_v9_final_for-review_FINAL_bradEdits_for-handoff.psd_ finally gets\napproval by the stakeholders.\n\nThe visual designer, relieved they’ve finally completed their job, tiptoes oh-\nso-quietly up to the entrance of the Code Cave. They slip the approved design\nunder the door, and as they scamper away they yell, “Can you get this done in\nthree weeks? We’re already behind schedule and we’re out of budget!”\n\nThe visual designer has already disappeared into the night by the time the\nfront-end developer picks the design off the floor. With one glance at the\ncomposition, a strange feeling—some combination of bewilderment, rage, and\ndread—washes over them. What’s wrong with the design, exactly? Maybe it’s the\nseven typefaces and nine unique button styles peppered throughout the comps.\nMaybe it’s the desktop-centric, impossible-to-actually-execute layout. Maybe\nit’s the perfect-yet-improbable user-generated content.\n\nThe front-end developer tries in vain to raise their concerns to the broader\ngroup, but is quickly dismissed as being either inept or curmudgeonly. Alas,\nit’s too late in the game to make significant changes to the design,\nespecially since it’s already been approved by the stakeholders.\n\nSo the developer tries their best to make lemonade out of the lemony static\ncomps. They bend over backwards to create responsive layouts that still retain\nthe integrity of the static comps, normalize some of the more blatant\ncomponent inconsistencies, establish pattern states (like button hover,\nactive, and disabled states) that weren’t articulated in the designs, and make\nsome on-the-fly decisions regarding the interactive aspects of the experience.\nDiscussions with designers are strained, but everyone realizes that they need\nto work through these issues to get the project done.\n\nAfter plugging the front-end code into a CMS, frantically finalizing the\nsite’s content, and doing some last-minute QA testing, the team finally\nlaunches the site. While no one says it out loud, there’s a tinge of\ndisappointment in the air alongside the joy and relief of getting the project\nout the door. After all, the live site lacks the glossy polish that the comps\npromised to the stakeholders, and friction between disciplines has bruised\nsome relationships.\n\nI hope this story reads as a work of fiction to you, but based on my own\nexperiences and conversations with countless others, I’m guessing you’ve\nexperienced this tale of woe at one point or another. It may even hit home\nlike a punch in the gut. Whether you’ve endured this process firsthand or not,\nit’s important to recognize that the Henry Ford-esque [waterfall\nprocess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) increasingly isn’t\nlikely to result in great digital work.\n\n![The waterfall process, where disciplines pass off work to each other in\nsequential order, isn't likely to result in great digital\nwork.](../Images/file65.png)\n\nThe waterfall process, where disciplines pass off work to each other in\nsequential order, isn't likely to result in great digital work.\n\nThe waterfall process may make sense for print, architecture, manufacturing,\nand other physical media since mistakes and changes are extraordinarily\ncostly. If a team overlooks an error made early in the process, they’ll pay\ndearly for it later. However, **the digital world isn’t constrained by the\nsame limitations as the physical one. Pixels are cheap.** Changes can happen\nin an instant, hypotheses can be quickly tested out, and designs and code can\nbe iterated on again and again.\n\nThe waterfall process hinges on the premise that work must flow in a\nsequential order: the UX designer’s work must be completed before visual\ndesign can start; the visual designer must finish their job before front-end\ndevelopment can begin. This simply isn’t true. There is much work that can and\nshould happen in parallel. To create sound UI design systems, we must reset\nour stakeholders’ expectations and get them comfortable with a blurrier, more\ncollaborative process.\n\nThat work will happen in parallel doesn’t imply that everyone will be guns\nblazing throughout the entire process. Of course, the bulk of research,\ninformation architecture, and other elemental aspects of UX design will tend\nto happen earlier in the process, but that work shouldn’t delay the other\ndisciplines from starting their jobs. And even when the bulk of a person’s\n_active_ work is done, they should never simply fade away from the project.\nIt’s crucial for every discipline to continue to consult with the others to\nensure their vision makes it into the final product. So rather than a rigid,\nsequential waterfall process, a more collaborative process over time looks\nsomething like this:\n\n![A more collaborative workflow involves a cross-disciplinary team working\ntogether throughout the entire process. While active work will wax and wane,\neach discipline continues to consult with the other team members to ensure\ntheir insights are present in the final work.](../Images/file66.png)\n\nA more collaborative workflow involves a cross-disciplinary team working\ntogether throughout the entire process. While active work will wax and wane,\neach discipline continues to consult with the other team members to ensure\ntheir insights are present in the final work.\n\n#### Development is design\n\nWhen a previous employer discovered I wrote HTML, CSS, and presentational\nJavaScript, they moved me to sit with the engineers and back-end developers.\nBefore too long I was being asked, “Hey, Brad. How long is that middleware\ngoing to take to build?” and “Can you normalize this database real quick?”\n\nHere’s the thing: I’ve never had a computer science class in my life, and I\nspent my high school career hanging out in the art room. Suffice it to say\nthose requests made me extremely uncomfortable.\n\nThere’s a fundamental misunderstanding that all coding is ultra-geeky\nprogramming, which simply isn’t the case. HTML is not a programming language.\nCSS is not a programming language. **But because HTML and CSS are still code,\nfront-end development is often put in the same bucket as Python, Java, PHP,\nRuby, C++, and other programming languages.** This misunderstanding tends to\ngive many front-end developers, myself included, a severe identity crisis.\n\nOrganizationally, there is often a massive divide between designers and\ndevelopers (or marketing and IT, or creative and engineering, or some other\ndivisive labels). Designers and developers often sit on different floors, in\ndifferent buildings altogether, in different cities, and sometimes even in\ndifferent countries on different continents. While some of this organizational\nseparation may be justified, **creating a division between designers and\nfront-end developers is an absolutely terrible idea**.\n\nThe fact remains that HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript build user\ninterfaces—yes, the same user interfaces that those designers are meticulously\ncrafting in tools like Photoshop and Sketch. For teams to build successful\nuser interface design systems together, **it’s crucial to treat[front-end\ndevelopment as a core part of the design\nprocess](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/development-is-design)**.\n\nWhen you show stakeholders only static pictures of websites, they can\nnaturally only comment and sign off on pictures of websites. This [sets the\nwrong\nexpectations](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/time_to_stop_showing_clients_static_design_visuals).\nBut by **getting the design into the browser as fast as possible** , you\nconfront stakeholders with the realities of the final medium much sooner in\nthe process. Working in HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript allows teams\nto not only create aesthetically beautiful designs, but demonstrates those\nuniquely digital design considerations like:\n\n  * flexibility\n  * impact of the network\n  * interaction\n  * motion\n  * ergonomics\n  * color and text rendering\n  * pixel density\n  * scrolling performance\n  * device and browser quirks\n  * user preferences\n\nCrucially, jumping into the browser faster also kick-starts the creation of\nthe patterns that will make up the living, breathing design system. More on\nthis in a bit.\n\nThis is not to say teams must design _entirely_ in the browser. As with\nanything, it’s about using the right tools at the right time to articulate the\nright things. Having the design represented in the browser _in addition to_\nother design artifacts gives teams the ability to paint a richer, more\nrealistic picture of the UI they’re crafting. Teams may demonstrate an\naesthetically focused design idea as a static image, and simultaneously\ndemonstrate a working prototype of that same idea in the browser.\n\n#### An iterative iterative iterative iterative process\n\nI believe a successful digital design process is quite similar to subtractive\nstone sculpture. At the beginning of the sculpting process, the artist and\ntheir patron have a general idea of what’s being created, but that vision\nwon’t be fully realized until the sculpture is complete.\n\nThe sculptor starts with a giant slab of rock and starts chipping away. A\ncrude shape begins to form after the first pass, and the shape becomes more\npronounced with every subsequent pass. After a few rounds of whacking away at\nthe rock, it becomes clear that the sculptor’s subject is a human form.\n\nWith the general shape of the sculpture roughed out, the artist then begins\nhoming in on specific sections of the piece. For instance, they may begin with\nthe face, moving up close to carve the shape of the eyes, nose, and mouth.\nAfter several passes, they then move on to the arms, and then begin detailing\nthe legs. At regular intervals the artist steps back to see how their detailed\nwork affects the overall sculpture. This process continues until the sculpture\nis complete and everyone is pleased with the results.\n\n![An iterative digital process is similar to subtractive stone sculpture,\nwhere fidelity is built up over many iterations.](../Images/file67.jpg)\n\nAn iterative digital process is similar to subtractive stone sculpture, where\nfidelity is built up over many iterations. Image credit: [Mike Beauregard on\nFlickr](https://flic.kr/p/dLrf6w)\n\nAgain, I think subtractive stone sculpture is a great analogy for a successful\ndigital process, although unlike sculpture we have the power of _undo_!\n\nIt’s essential to get stakeholders comfortable with reviewing works in\nprogress rather than fully baked designs and code. As I mentioned in chapter\n1, every organization these days wants to become more agile, and iteration is\na key part of being agile. **It’s more important to make steps in the right\ndirection** than exhaust a ton of effort painting unrealistic pictures of what\nyou want the final piece to be. **A sound design system doesn’t roll off an\nassembly line, but is rather sculpted in iterative loops, building up fidelity\nas the project progresses.**\n\nIf this all sounds a bit messy, that’s because it is! To the dismay of some\nproject managers, the design process doesn’t fit neatly into the rigid borders\nof Excel spreadsheets and Gantt charts. True collaboration between disciplines\nis fuzzy and chaotic, and that’s not a bad thing. **Constant communication,\ntight feedback loops, and true collaboration therefore become the glue that\nholds the process together**. Get your entire team to commit to honest\nconversation and genuine collaboration, and the details of your process will\nfall into place.\n\nAre everyone’s expectations properly set? Good! Now let’s roll up our sleeves\nand get to work establishing our design system.\n\n## Establishing direction\n\nTeams are often eager to jump right into fun high-fidelity design and\ndevelopment work, and clients are eager to see and react to that detailed\nwork. However, this leads to distractions, assumptions, and all the\naforementioned misguided expectations. **It’s essential to agree on an overall\ndesign direction and paint the broad strokes first** before moving into high-\nfidelity design and development. This requires restraint and expectation\nmanagement, but results in more focused decision-making and more realistic\nwork.\n\nWhat does this lo-fi work look like? Let’s take a look at some techniques UX\ndesigners, visual designers, and front-end developers can use to begin\ncrafting a strong overall direction for a UI design system.\n\n### Establishing content and display patterns\n\nThere’s a ton of up-front strategic and research work that can and should\nhappen toward the beginning of a project. _UX designers_ (known by other\nmonikers such as _information designers_ , _information architects_ ,\n_interaction designers_ , and so on) are responsible for synthesizing all that\nvital information and translating it into a user interface that meets the\nproject’s business and user goals.\n\nIn a traditional waterfall process, many UX designers have gone about this\ntask by generating high-fidelity wireframes that document every screen of the\nentire user experience. These wireframe documents, stuffed to the gills with\nblack rectangles and annotations, spec out the details of what the interface\nwill accomplish, and are used to get stakeholder buy-in. As thorough as these\ndocuments tend to be, they don’t paint the full picture and often make\ndangerous assumptions about visual layout and technical functionality.\n\nRather than jumping straight into such high-fidelity documents, it’s better to\n**start with lo-fi sketches that establish what appears on a particular screen\nand in what general order**. Establishing the experience’s basic information\narchitecture can be accomplished with a simple bulleted list and a\nconversation. For a project I did for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food\nBank, I started by stubbing out the basic information architecture for a page\non a site.\n\n![Basic HTML wireframes for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank\nhomepage.](../Images/file68.png)\n\nBasic HTML wireframes for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank homepage.\n\nNo one in their right mind would mistake this blocked out grayscale page as\ncomplete, but it provides more than enough information to have important\nconversations about the page structure and hierarchy.\n\nMaking lo-fi wireframes _[mobile-\nfirst](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933)_ means using the constraints of\nsmall screens to force the team to focus on the core content and hierarchy.\nYou can now ask, “Do we have the right things on this screen?” “Are they in\nthe right general order?”\n\nThese blocky grayscale wireframes help establish the necessary [content\npatterns](http://danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/) for the\nscreen, but UX designers can also articulate some site-wide UI patterns they\nanticipate using to ultimately display those content patterns. For the\nredesign of TechCrunch, designer [Jennifer\nBrook](http://jenniferbrook.co/about) defined a few site-wide UI patterns that\ncould be used anywhere:\n\n![For the TechCrunch website redesign, Jennifer Brook defined site-wide,\ngestural display patterns, which don't make assumptions about aesthetics or\nfunctionality.](../Images/file69.png)\n\nFor the TechCrunch website redesign, Jennifer Brook defined site-wide,\ngestural display patterns, which don't make assumptions about aesthetics or\nfunctionality.\n\nFrom the image above, you can gather that the “featured island” component will\nshow content in some fashion. Note the gestural nature of this sketch and how\nit doesn’t make any specific assumptions about layout or functionality. The\ndetails of how this pattern will look and function will come later, but at the\nbeginning of the project it’s useful simply to define it and articulate where\nit might get used.\n\nAs I’ve discovered from subsequent projects, content and display patterns can\nbe effectively communicated in an even simpler format: the lowly spreadsheet.\n\n![A simple spreadsheet can articulate what content and display patterns go on\na given page while describing their order and purpose.](../Images/file70.png)\n\nA simple spreadsheet can articulate what content and display patterns go on a\ngiven page while describing their order and purpose.\n\nWith a few simple spreadsheet columns, we can articulate which display\npatterns should be included in a given template, and what content patterns\nthey’ll contain. More importantly, we’re able to articulate each pattern’s\nrelative hierarchy and the role it plays on the screen. If you read the\nleftmost column vertically, you’re effectively looking at the mobile-first\nview of what the UI could be.\n\n“What content and display patterns go on this page? And in what general\norder?” are crucial questions to ask, and the techniques we just described can\nhelp designers discuss them effectively without making any layout or technical\nassumptions.\n\n### Establishing visual direction\n\nA visual designer’s job is to create an aesthetic language and apply it to the\nuser interface in a way that aligns with the project’s goals. To do this, it’s\nessential for a visual designer to unearth the stakeholders’ aesthetic values.\n\nHistorically, visual designers have gone about this by creating full\ncomps—often _many_ comps—to feel out the aesthetic values of the organization.\nThrow some comps against the wall and see what sticks. As you might imagine,\ngenerating a slew of comps from scratch takes an immense amount of time and\neffort, and unfortunately much of that work finds itself on the cutting room\nfloor. There must be a more efficient way.\n\nAs it turns out, there’s a better path to take to arrive at aesthetic values\nwithout having to do a hell of a lot of up-front design work. Let’s talk about\nsome of the tactics for making this happen.\n\n#### The 20-second gut test\n\nA fantastic exercise for quickly establishing aesthetic values is the\n[20-second gut test](http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/2010/04/the-20-second-gut-\ntest/). Typically done as part of the project kick-off meeting, the exercise\ninvolves showing the stakeholders a handful of pertinent websites (about\ntwenty to thirty of them) for twenty seconds each. The sites you choose should\nbe a healthy blend of industry-specific sites and other visually interesting\nsites from other industries. For added believability, you can photoshop in\nyour client’s logo in place of the site’s actual logo.\n\nFor each site presented, each person votes on a scale from 1 to 10, where a\nscore of 1 means “If this were our site I would quit my job and cry myself to\nsleep,” while a score of 10 means “If this were our site I would be absolutely\necstatic!” Instruct participants to consider visual properties they find\ninteresting, such as typography, color, density, layout, illustration style,\nand general vibe.\n\n![For the Pittsburgh Food Bank website redesign kick-off, we showed\nstakeholders a variety of relevant websites for twenty seconds each. The\nparticipants voted on how happy they would be if the particular site was\ntheirs. Then we discussed the results.](../Images/file71.jpg)\n\nFor the Pittsburgh Food Bank website redesign kick-off, we showed stakeholders\na variety of relevant websites for twenty seconds each. The participants voted\non how happy they would be if the particular site was theirs. Then we\ndiscussed the results.\n\nWhen the exercise is complete, quickly tally up the scores and come back to\nthe group to discuss the results. Have a conversation about the sites that\nreceived the five lowest scores, the five highest scores, and the most\ncontentious scores (sites which some people ranked very high and others ranked\nvery low). The participants should explain why they were attracted or repulsed\nby a particular site, and work through differences in opinions with the group.\n\nThis exercise exposes stakeholders to a variety of aesthetic directions early\nin the process, allows them to work through differences in taste, and (with\nany luck) helps arrive at some shared aesthetic values. The visual designer\ncan then latch on to these insights and begin to translate those aesthetic\nvalues into a visual direction for the project.\n\n#### Style tiles\n\nOnce again, visual designers’ first instinct is often to jump right into\ncreating full comps to articulate an aesthetic direction for the project. This\nhigh-fidelity work is certainly tangible, but also wastes a ton of time and\neffort if the comps don’t resonate with the stakeholders. Also, creating high-\nfidelity comps often makes big assumptions about technical feasibility, which\nleads to unrealistic expectations and antagonistic relationships with front-\nend developers.\n\nIt’s essential to establish a solid visual direction for the project, so how\ndoes a visual designer do that without burning a ton of time on up-front high-\nfidelity comps? That’s the question that designer Samantha Warren answered\nwhen she created [style tiles](http://styletil.es/), a deliverable that’s more\ntangible than a mood board but not as high-fidelity as a fully baked comp.\n\n![For the Entertainment Weekly website redesign project, visual designers used\nstyle tiles to explore color, type, texture, and more.](../Images/file72.png)\n\nFor the Entertainment Weekly website redesign project, visual designers used\nstyle tiles to explore color, type, texture, and more.\n\nStyle tiles (along with their in-browser counterparts, [style\nprototypes](http://sparkbox.github.io/style-prototype/)) allow designers to\nexplore color, typography, texture, icons, and other aspects of design\natmosphere without making assumptions about layout or worrying about polish.\nThey can be designed much faster because they’re not encumbered by the\nexpectations of high-fidelity comps, which means feedback and discussion can\nhappen sooner.\n\nStyle tiles facilitate conversation to uncover what stakeholders value and\nwhat they don’t. “Does this style tile resonate better with you rather than\nthis one? Why?” “Why does this color palette not sit well with you?” “What is\nit about this typeface you like?” You can have important conversations about\naesthetic design without having to create full comps.\n\nCrucially, style tiles also reinforce pattern-based thinking by educating\nstakeholders about design _systems_ rather than _pages_. Presenting color\nswatches, type examples, and textures exposes stakeholders to the ingredients\nthat will underpin any implementation of the design system.\n\n#### Element collages\n\nWhile style tiles are great for exploring design atmosphere, they’re still a\nbit abstract. To get a sense of how those design ingredients will be applied\nto an interface, it’s important to quickly move into something a bit more\ntangible than a style tile. But does that mean visual designers need to jump\nfrom style tiles straight into full comps? Not necessarily.\n\nSomewhere in between style tiles and full comps live [_element\ncollages_](http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/), which are\ncollections of UI component design explorations. Element collages provide a\nplayground for designers to apply design atmosphere to actual interface\nelements, yet still be free from layout and highly polished presentation.\n\n![An element collage for the Entertainment Weekly\nredesign.](../Images/file73.jpg)\n\nAn element collage for the Entertainment Weekly redesign applied color,\ntypography, and texture to actual interface elements. These collages enabled\nimportant conversations about the aesthetic direction of the project.\n\nLike style tiles, element collages are meant to facilitate discussion about\nthe aesthetic direction of the project. It’s very clear these collages aren’t\nan actual website, but stakeholders can still get a sense of what the site\n_could_ look like. Conversation about these element collages can give visual\ndesigners more ideas and direction about where to take the design next, and\nbecause of their lo-fi nature, designers can quickly iterate and evolve ideas.\n\nNo doubt other tactics exist to establish aesthetic direction for your\nprojects, and which techniques you decide to employ will vary from project to\nproject. But the key is to paint some broader strokes before spending a lot of\ntime and effort on highly detailed design work. Engaging in conversation with\nstakeholders at this exploratory stage creates a more inclusive process, which\nis far preferable to a process in which stakeholders simply grunt approval or\ndisapproval of design deliverables.\n\n### Front-end prep chef\n\nAs we discussed earlier, front-end developers are often relegated to crude\nproduction machines that are brought into the project only after all the\ndesign decisions are made. This archaic process keeps disciplines out of sync\nwith one another and prevents teams from working together in a meaningful way.\nThis is a huge mistake. Including front-end development as a critical part of\nthe design process requires changes to both project structure and team\nmembers’ mentalities.\n\nIn the restaurant business, an important yet unsung role is that of the prep\nchef. A prep chef chops vegetables, marinades meat, and makes salads in\npreparation for the following day’s work. By having ingredients prepared ahead\nof time, the kitchen staff can focus on collaboration and cooking rather than\nmenial tasks. Without the up-front work of the prep chef, the flow of the main\nchefs would be interrupted and the fast pace of the kitchen would grind to a\nhalt.\n\n![A prep chef chops vegetables, marinades meat, makes salads, and prepares\nother ingredients so that the main kitchen staff can focus on cooking meals\nand collaboration.](../Images/file74.jpg)\n\nA prep chef chops vegetables, marinades meat, makes salads, and prepares other\ningredients so that the main kitchen staff can focus on cooking meals and\ncollaboration.\n\nFront-end developers need to be the prep chefs of the web design process. **If\ndevelopers aren’t coding from day one of the project, there’s something wrong\nwith the process.** “But Brad,” I can hear you saying, “how can I start coding\nif I don’t know what I’m supposed to code?”\n\nBelieve me, there is plenty of front-end work to do without knowing a thing\nabout the project’s information design or aesthetic direction. In addition to\nsetting up the development environment (such as preparing Git repositories,\ndev servers, CMSes, and development tools), developers can dive into code and\nbegin marking up patterns. But what should you be marking up if you don’t know\nanything about the design? That depends on the type of project you’re working\non.\n\nAre you making an e-commerce site? You can set up site search, a shopping cart\ntable, a placeholder product detail page, the homepage, and checkout pages.\nMaking an online service? Start marking up the sign-up and login forms, the\nforgot password flow, and dashboard. And, of course, most websites will have a\nheader, footer, and main content area. Set up shell templates and write basic\nmarkup for patterns you anticipate using. This markup will initially be crude,\nbut it provides a crucial starting point for collaboration and iteration.\n\n**This front-end prep chef work frees up developers’ time to collaborate\n_with_ designers**, rather than working _after_ design is complete. With basic\nmarkup in place, developers can work with designers to help validate UX design\ndecisions through conversations and working prototypes. They can help visual\ndesigners better understand source order and web layout, and can quickly\nproduce a fledgling codebase that will eventually evolve into the final\nproduct.\n\n### Stop, collaborate, and listen\n\nLet’s quickly review what establishing design direction looks like across\ndisciplines:\n\n  * **UX designers** can create lo-fi sketches to establish basic information architecture and some anticipated UI patterns.\n  * **Visual designers** can gather the teams’ aesthetic values by conducting a 20-second gut test exercise, then create style tiles and element collages to explore initial design directions.\n  * **Frontend developers** can set up project dependencies, stub out basic templates, and write structural markup for patterns the team anticipates using in the project.\n\nThis work can happen concurrently but shouldn’t happen in isolation. Sure,\nthere will need to be some initial head-down time for each discipline to get\nset up, but all team members should be fully aware of each discipline’s\nexplorations in anticipation of working together to evolve these ideas.\n\n> Ideas are meant to be ugly. [Jason Santa\n> Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/piles-of-ideas)\n\nAt this early stage, it’s important to stress the importance of exploration,\nplay, and idea generation. The lo-fi nature of the techniques we just\ndiscussed help encourage this exploration, allowing team members to pursue\nideas that excite them. Sometimes those ideas might be best articulated as a\nnapkin sketch, a prototype in [CodePen](http://codepen.io/), a visual\nexploration in Sketch, a quick wire in Balsamiq, a motion concept in After\nEffects, or some combination of media and tools. **The point is for the team\nto generate ideas and solve problems, not to enforce a rigid order of\noperations.** By approaching this design exploration in a cross-disciplinary\nway, teams can find balance between aesthetics, technical feasibility,\nusability, and functionality.\n\n## Rolling up our sleeves\n\nWith a general design direction established, the team can roll up their\nsleeves to build the interface and its underlying design system. But how do\nteams turn a vague sense of direction into a beautiful, functional, usable,\nand complete design system?\n\n### From concept to complete\n\nTurning explorations into finished patterns is a blurry, imperfect process.\nThis should come as absolutely no surprise to you by this point in the book.\n\nFor the TechCrunch project, Dan Mall riffed on the team’s initial design\nconversations to create a visual exploration for the site’s header. This piece\nof interface was a logical place to start since the header is one of the most\nprominent and branded elements on the page. After a little bit of work, we\nhopped on a call to discuss the exploration with the client.\n\n![Dan Mall created an element collage to explore an aesthetic direction for\nthe global header.](../Images/file75.png)\n\nDan Mall created an element collage to explore an aesthetic direction for the\nglobal header.\n\nEven though this design artifact was a simple in-progress exploration, we were\nable to have important conversations about the header’s aesthetics, hierarchy,\nand suggested functionality. Because the header was presented sans context, we\nwere able to discuss the issues pertaining to the header without stakeholders’\nfocus wandering to other page elements.\n\nThough the client didn’t know it, I had been building out a working HTML\nversion of the header behind the scenes in Pattern Lab.\n\n![Using Dan's exploration as a reference, I created an HTML version of the\nglobal header in Pattern Lab. This grayscale prototype helped us demonstrate\ninteractivity and how the header would adapt across the resolution\nspectrum.](../Images/file76.png)\n\nUsing Dan's exploration as a reference, I created an HTML version of the\nglobal header in Pattern Lab. This grayscale prototype helped us demonstrate\ninteractivity and how the header would adapt across the resolution spectrum.\n\nThis grayscale prototype allowed us to demonstrate interactivity and\nresponsiveness, which led to even more discussion. Collectively we proposed\nchanges to the header’s layout and functionality, and I was able to make\nchanges using the browser’s development tools during the call. Suddenly, the\nentire team and stakeholders were actively participating in the design\nprocess!\n\nWith input from the stakeholders and team, we iterated over the header pattern\nto massage the layout, IA, aesthetic details, and functionality to arrive at\nthe solution we ultimately launched with.\n\n![The header we launched with was the culmination of plenty of conversations\nand decisions around the pattern's content, design, and\nfunctionality.](../Images/file77.png)\n\nThe header we launched with was the culmination of plenty of conversations and\ndecisions around the pattern's content, design, and functionality.\n\nObviously the header pattern doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Within Pattern Lab,\nthe header was included in every template using Mustache’s include pattern\nthat we discussed in chapter 3.\n\n    \n    \n    {{> organisms-header }}\n\nThis allowed us to view the header within the context of the rest of the\npages, sketchy as they initially were. So while we were focusing on designing\none specific pattern, we were simultaneously taking into account the context\nof where that pattern would be employed.\n\n![In a more iterative process, there will be instances where some patterns are\nfurther developed than others. Seeing a partially done page might look unusual\nout of context, but communication between the team and stakeholders should\nalleviate confusion.](../Images/file78.png)\n\nIn a more iterative process, there will be instances where some patterns are\nfurther developed than others. Seeing a partially done page might look unusual\nout of context, but communication between the team and stakeholders should\nalleviate confusion.\n\nInitially, in-browser designs tend to look crude at best, which is A-OK. The\nintention is to stub out the template’s basic information architecture in the\nbrowser, define patterns, wire up those patterns using includes, and begin the\npatterns’ general markup. With that work in place, the team can collectively\nbegin styling specific patterns and refining the overall structure.\n\nSeeing these partially designed prototypes might look unusual to those used to\nmore traditional, pixel-perfect design deliverables. But it’s far more\nimportant to communicate progress than a false sense of perfection, which is\nwhy rolling updates are preferable to big reveals.\n\n### The role of comps in a post-PSD era\n\nUp until this point we’ve been talking about establishing a general aesthetic\ndirection and then designing some patterns to experiment with the application\nof that aesthetic direction. These relatively lo-fi tactics allow teams to\nexplore freely, iterate quickly, and get feedback sooner.\n\nBut I’ll never forget this client feedback we received on the first pattern-\ndriven project I worked on: “These element collages look great, but it’s like\nyou’re asking me to comment on how beautiful a face is by showing me the\nnose.”\n\nIf you’ve gotten to this point in your process, congratulations! Feedback like\nthis means they’re salivating for more, so now that you’ve captured a general\naesthetic direction you can safely put those explorations into context. That\nlikely involves creating full static comps.\n\nListen to the chatter around “designing in the browser” and you’ll undoubtedly\nhear that _Photoshop comps are the devil incarnate_. Which, of course, isn’t\ntrue. Throughout this book we’ve discussed the importance of breaking things\ndown into their atomic elements while simultaneously building up a cohesive\nwhole. **Static comps are effective at painting a full picture of what the UI\ncould look like.** The trick is knowing _when_ to paint those full pictures,\nand knowing how long to dwell in static design documents\n\n![Dan Mall created a full comp to demonstrate what a featured article template\nfor TechCrunch might look like. This artifact was used to show the design\nsystem in context and get approval for the overarching design. Subsequent\ndesign revisions would be handled in the browser.](../Images/file79.png)\n\nDan Mall created a full comp to demonstrate what a featured article template\nfor TechCrunch might look like. This artifact was used to show the design\nsystem in context and get approval for the overarching design. Subsequent\ndesign revisions would be handled in the browser.\n\nFor the TechCrunch project, we created a comp for the article template only\n_after_ the client was feeling good about our element collage explorations.\nCreating full comps requires a lot of effort, which is why we established the\ndesign direction first to mitigate the risk of all that full-comp effort going\nstraight into the trash if we got it totally wrong.\n\nComps, like any other design artifact, are used to facilitate a conversation\nwith the project stakeholders. If their feedback is, “This feels all wrong,”\nthen it’s back to the drawing board to create a new comp. But if their\nfeedback suggests, “Can we move this from here to here? Can we add a gray\nborder around the article text? Can we increase the size of this image?”\nthat’s a sign the overall direction is in good shape and those relatively\nminor issues can be addressed in the browser.\n\n### In-browser iteration\n\nStatic comps can be great for shaping the overall aesthetic direction of a\ntemplate, but users will ultimately view and interact with the experience in a\nbrowser. That’s why designs should be quickly translated into the final\nenvironment and iterated on there.\n\n**Working in the browser allows teams to address layout issues across the\nentire resolution spectrum, design around dynamic data (such as variable\ncharacter lengths, image sizes, and other dynamic content), demonstrate\ninteraction and animation, gauge performance, factor in ergonomics, and\nconfront technical considerations (such as pixel density, text rendering,\nscrolling performance, and browser quirks).** Static design comps cannot deal\nwith all these considerations, so they should be treated merely as hypotheses\nrather than set-in-stone specifications. Only when transferred to the browser\ncan any design hypothesis truly be confirmed or rejected.\n\n> Let’s change the phrase “designing in the browser” to “deciding in the\n> browser.” [Dan Mall](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/dan-\n> mall/2012-september-12)\n\n**Once the designs are in the browser, they should stay in the browser.** At\nthis stage in the process, the point of production shifts to team members\nadept at crafting HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript. Patterns should be\ncreated, styled, and plugged in wherever they’re needed. Designers can react\nto these in-browser implementations and can create spot comps in static tools\nto help iron out responsive wrinkles at the organism level. This back-and-\nforth between static and in-browser tools establishes a healthy loop between\ndesign and development, where the front-end code becomes more solid and stable\nwith each iterative loop.\n\n![This illustration by Trent Walton of Paravel perfectly articulates a more\niterative design and development process. By getting designs into the browser\nsooner, teams can iterate over the design and address the many considerations\nthat can only be dealt with once the design is in the\nbrowser.](../Images/file80.jpg)\n\nThis illustration by Trent Walton of Paravel perfectly articulates a more\niterative design and development process. By getting designs into the browser\nsooner, teams can iterate over the design and address the many considerations\nthat can only be dealt with once the design is in the browser.\n\n**The beautiful thing about a pattern-based workflow is that as each pattern\nbecomes more fully baked, any template that includes the pattern will become\nmore fully baked as well.** That means the level of effort to create new\ntemplates decreases dramatically over the course of the project, until\neventually creating a new template mostly involves stitching together existing\npatterns.\n\n## Bring it on home\n\nThe design system is taking shape and the team is cooking with gas to bring\nthe project home. At this stage, UI patterns are well established, the team is\ntaking some final steps to tighten everything up and prepare for launch.\n\nUX designers are hitting the prototype hard to make sure the flows and\ninteractions are all logical and intuitive. Visual designers are combing over\nthe interface and proposing design tweaks to the UI to polish up the design.\nFront-end developers are testing the experience in a slew of browsers and\ndevices while also addressing design feedback. Back-end developers are hard at\nwork integrating the front-end UI into the CMS (we’ll talk more about the\nrelationship between front-end and back-end in chapter 5). And, of course, the\nclients and stakeholders are making last-minute demands—I mean\nsuggestions—about the design and content. The whole team is contributing\ndocumentation for the style guide, cleaning up the patterns in the pattern\nlibrary, and working hard to get the website off the ground.\n\nThen—seemingly in the blink of an eye—the website and accompanying design\nsystem launch. Champagne is poured, high-fives are exchanged and, of course,\npost-launch bugs are squashed. Users visit the new site to find a beautiful,\nfunctional, consistent, and cohesive experience that undoubtedly makes them\nweep tears of joy. Mission accomplished.\n\nWhat began as a giant slab of rock is now a finely polished sculpture, thanks\nto a ton of hard work, genuine collaboration, constant communication, and\nplenty of iteration. Moreover, in addition to a brand-spanking-new website,\nthe team leaves behind a flexible, deliberate UI system bundled up in a\nbeautiful style guide.\n\nThis chapter explored everything that goes into making an effective UI design\nsystem. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss how to make sure that design system\ncontinues to be successful in the long run.\n\n\nArtboard 1MaintainingDesign SystemsChapter 5Making design systems stand the\ntest of time\n\nAnd they made a design system, delivered a style guide, and lived happily ever\nafter. Right?\n\nNot quite.\n\n![A pattern library in the trash can alongside a PSD and PDF\nfile](../Images/file81.jpg)\n\nThere’s a very real risk that a style guide will end up in the trash can right\nalongside all the PSDs, PDFs and those other static artifacts of the design\nprocess. Despite everyone’s best intentions, all the time and effort that went\ninto making a thoughtful design system and style guide can go straight down\nthe drain.\n\nHow can that be?\n\n> A style guide is an artifact of design process. A design system is a living,\n> funded product with a roadmap & backlog, serving an ecosystem. [Nathan\n> Curtis](https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis/status/656829204235972608)\n\n**An artifact is something you’d find on an archaeological dig or in a museum,\nwhereas a system is a living, breathing entity.** A style guide can provide\ndocumentation and serve as a helpful resource, but the simple existence of a\nstyle guide doesn’t guarantee long-term success for the underlying design\nsystem. A design system needs ongoing maintenance, support, and tender loving\ncare for it to truly thrive.\n\n## Changing minds, once again\n\nWe’ve already discussed the importance of resetting everyone’s expectations to\nestablish a more collaborative, pattern-driven workflow. To save our style\nguides from the bowels of a trash can, we must once again fundamentally rewire\npeople’s brains.\n\n### What is it we’re making again?\n\nWe _think_ we merely design and build websites and apps. And that’s true for\nthe most part. After all, that’s what our clients pay us to do, and the\nproducts we create are the vehicles that generate money and success for our\norganizations. It seems natural to focus on the final implementations rather\nthan the underlying system. The live products remain the primary focus of\neveryone’s attention, while any pattern library exists as an offshoot that\nsimply provides helpful documentation.\n\n![](../Images/file82.png)\n\nThe problem with this mindset is that you can almost see that pattern library\nsnapping off and sliding into the abyss. **Once the pattern library ceases to\nreflect the current state of the products it serves, it becomes obsolete.**\nAnd when the pattern library managing the design system is no longer accurate,\nthe website maintenance process devolves into a smattering of hotfixes and ad\nhoc changes, ruining all the thoughtfulness that went into creating the\noriginal design system.\n\nTo set ourselves up for long-term success, we must fundamentally shift our\noutlook around what we’re actually creating. Rather than thinking of final\napplications as our sole responsibility, we must recognize that the design\nsystem is what underpins our final products _and_ pattern libraries.\n\n![](../Images/file83.png)\n\nThis “design system first” mentality inserts a bit of friction into the\nmaintenance process, and that **friction can be friendly**. It forces us to\nstep back and consider how any improvements, client requests, feature\nadditions, and iterations affect the overall system rather than only a sliver\nof the whole ecosystem.\n\nSay you’re working on an e-commerce site, and you run a test that finds a\ncustom-styled dropdown menu on the product detail page isn’t performing as\nwell as the browser’s default dropdown menu. One course of action is to simply\nremove the custom-styled dropdown from that particular page and call it a day.\nHowever, considering the entire design system rather than just the product\ndetail page might cause you to take a step back and wonder, “If this custom\ndropdown menu isn’t performing well here, perhaps it’s not performing well\nelsewhere.” After digging into the issue further, you find the best course of\naction is to globally modify the dropdown pattern in the design system to\nremove the custom styling. Now, anywhere the dropdown pattern appears will\nreflect those changes and will likely see similar performance improvements.\n\nThat is just one example of how design-system thinking can lead to broader,\nmore considered changes. **Broken behavior and opportunities to enhance the UI\nwill often be realized at the _application_ level, but those changes should\noften be acted on at the _system_ level.** Adding this bit of friendly\nfriction into your workflow ensures improvements are shared across the entire\necosystem, and prevents the system from being eroded by a series of one-off\nchanges.\n\n### Done and done\n\nAnother expectation we must revisit is our definition of _done_. Creating\nthings for print and other physical media involves making permanent, tangible\nobjects. That sense of finality simply doesn’t exist in the digital world,\nwhich means change can happen with much less effort and friction than other\nmedia. **Clients, colleagues, and stakeholders should embrace the pliable\nnature of the digital world to create living design systems that adapt to the\never-shifting nature of the medium, user needs, and the needs of the\nbusiness**.\n\nThis shift in thinking fundamentally affects the scope of our work. Folks\nworking in the client services business are often used to delivering a project\nin a tidy package then riding off into the sunset. Internal teams don’t fair\nmuch better, since they tend to float from one initiative to the next. Whether\nyou’re part of an internal team or you’re an external gun for hire, I’m\nguessing you’ve experienced the shortcomings of project-based work. We tend to\ntalk about a future that never comes, and instead we set it, forget it, then\nmove on to the next shiny project.\n\nIf we’re committed to creating genuinely useful work that truly meets the\nneeds of our clients and organizations, we must fundamentally redefine the\nscope of our work. As Nathan Curtis says, a design system shouldn’t be a\n_project_ with a finite scope, but rather a _product_ meant to grow and evolve\nover time:\n\n> Focusing on style guide delivery as the climax is the wrong story to tell. A\n> system isn’t a project with an end, it’s the origin story of a living and\n> evolving product that’ll serve other products. [Nathan\n> Curtis](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/a-design-system-isn-t-a-project-\n> it-s-a-product-serving-products-74dcfffef935#.4umtnfxsx)\n\nThe web is never done, and the creation of a design system is merely the first\nstep in a long (and hopefully fruitful!) journey. A design system should be a\nlong-term commitment with the ambitious goal of revolutionizing how your\norganization creates digital work. Exciting, eh?! So how do we make sure that\nhappens?\n\n## Creating maintainable design systems\n\nAs you embark on this pattern-paved journey, let’s talk about things you can\ndo to craft a design system that sets up your organization for long-term\nsuccess. How do you create a design system that takes root and becomes an\nessential part of your organization’s workflow? What pitfalls do you need to\nbe on the lookout for? How do you ensure the design system yields big results?\nTo set up your design system for long-term success, you need to:\n\n  * Make it official.\n  * Make it adaptable.\n  * Make it maintainable.\n  * Make it cross-disciplinary.\n  * Make it approachable.\n  * Make it visible.\n  * Make it bigger.\n  * Make it context-agnostic.\n  * Make it contextual.\n  * Make it last.\n\nLet’s dive into each one of these points in a bit more detail.\n\n## Make it official\n\nYour initial style guide may begin its life as a side project, the result of a\nweekend hackathon, or as the brainchild of one or two ambitious team members.\nAs we discussed in the previous chapter, your client or boss doesn’t even have\nto know that you’re creating a thoughtful design system and accompanying\npattern library. Remember: ask forgiveness, not permission!\n\nOrganic beginnings are all well and good, but in order to establish a truly\nimpactful design system that creates long-term success for your organization,\n**the design system needs to evolve into an officially sanctioned endeavor**.\nThat means thinking of it as a true product rather than a simple side project,\nand consequently allocating real time, budget, and people to it.\n\nConvincing stakeholders to commit large chunks of money, time, and resources\nup front for a design system can be extremely challenging. So what are we to\ndo? Here’s my advice:\n\n  1. Make a thing.\n  2. Show that it’s useful.\n  3. Make it official.\n\nLet’s break down these steps a bit further.\n\n### 1: Make a thing\n\nYou have to start somewhere, and having something started is better than\nnothing at all. Pick a project that would be a great pilot for establishing\nyour design system; follow a process similar to the one discussed in chapter\n4; think about the atomic design mental model detailed in chapter 2; and\nyou’ll end up with a solid foundation for a thoughtful design system and\npattern library that helps your team work more effectively.\n\nTake the time to package your UI patterns in a pattern library and get it\nready to be shopped around. I’ve talked to several ambitious team members who\nhave established the basic gist of their pattern library over the course of a\nweekend. This effort makes all the difference in the world since it provides\nsomething tangible for stakeholders to react to. Again: _show, don’t tell_.\n\n### 2: Show that it’s useful\n\nWith a nascent-yet-tangible design system in place, you can have more\nmeaningful conversations with the people who control money, scheduling, and\nresources. You can discuss exactly how the design system helped save time and\nmoney (see “Pitching Patterns” in chapter 4), then paint a picture of how\nthose benefits would scale even further if the organization invested in an\nofficial, full-fledged design system.\n\nGet team members from different disciplines to back you up and discuss the\ninitial success of the system, and also pull in others who are sympathetic to\nthe cause who would stand to benefit from an expanded design system.\n\n### 3: Make it official\n\nYou’ve proved the value of your initial design system and presented a roadmap\nfor how to make it even better. With any luck your organization will commit to\nmaking the design system an Official Thing.\n\nWith approval from the highest levels, you’re now able to put a plan into\naction that involves: allocating or hiring people to work on the design\nsystem; developing a plan to make it more robust; establishing a clear\ngovernance strategy; and laying out a product roadmap.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out that things may not shake out the way you hoped.\nDespite demonstrating real value and presenting a concrete plan of action,\nhigher-ups still might shoot your initiative down. **Don’t be discouraged.**\nYou may have lost the battle, but you can certainly win the war. Your team\nshould continue to grow and extend the design system in whatever capacity you\ncan until its value becomes undeniable. As more people benefit from the\nsystem, you’ll end up with a grassroots-supported system that can help push\nthe endeavor through.\n\n### Establishing a design system team\n\nWith the design system initiative approved, it’s now time to put the right\npeople and processes in place to ensure the system flourishes for your\norganization.\n\n#### Design system makers and users\n\nFirst things first. It’s important to recognize that **there will inevitably\nbe people at the organization who help _make and maintain_ the design system,\nand there will be people who will be _users_ of the design system**. There may\nbe overlap between these two groups, but establishing the roles of makers and\nusers is important nonetheless.\n\nWhen I talk about establishing a more collaborative process like the one I\ndetailed in the previous chapter, I inevitably hear people who work at large\norganizations say, “But Brad, we have hundreds (or even thousands) of\ndevelopers working on our products. Getting all those people to collaborate\nand contribute like that would be far too difficult.”\n\nThey’re likely right. It would be ideal if the entire organization adopted\nnimbler, more collaborative processes, but the daunting logistics around such\nan effort makes it improbable. But here’s the thing: not _everyone_ in the\norganization needs to contribute directly to the design system, but someone\n(or more likely, some people) must take ownership of it.\n\n**The design system _makers_ are the ones who create, maintain, and govern the\nsystem**, and they need to work closely together to ensure that the system is\nsmart, flexible, scalable, and addresses the needs of the users and business.\n**The design system _users_ are the teams across the organization who will\ntake the system and employ its interface patterns to specific applications.**\n\n![Design system makers and users.](../Images/file84.png)\n\nDesign system makers and users.\n\n**The design system _makers_ and design system _users_ need to maintain a\nclose working relationship** to ensure the patterns defined within the system\nserve the needs of the applications, and that all documentation is clear.\n**Makers provide a birds-eye perspective of the entire ecosystem the design\nsystem serves, while users provide an on-the-ground perspective focused on\nspecific applications of the system.** Jina Bolton of Salesforce sums up the\nrelationship between makers and users quite nicely:\n\n> The Design System informs our Product Design. Our Product Design informs the\n> Design System. [Jina Bolton, Salesforce](https://medium.com/salesforce-\n> ux/the-salesforce-team-model-for-scaling-a-design-system-d89c2a2d404b)\n\nBoth outlooks are critical to the success of the design system, which is why\nit’s so important for makers and users to have a healthy relationship that\ninvolves frequent communication and collaboration.\n\n#### Design system makers\n\nWho updates the design system? Who approves changes? Who communicates with the\nusers of the design system to make sure it’s addressing their needs? Who gets\nto decide which patterns stay, go, or need tweaking?\n\nThe answers to these questions will very much depend on the size and setup of\nyour organization.\n\n**Large organizations** are able to dedicate serious resources to managing\ndesign systems. Salesforce, for example, maintains an official _design systems\nteam_ , which currently includes about a dozen full-time employees, last I\nheard. That dedicated team is responsible for governing the design system and\nmaking sure it’s meeting the needs of the internal product teams, as well as\nexternal developers who build things on the company’s platform. When a design\nsystem is serving literally thousands of users, it’s a smart idea to dedicate\nat least a few full-time employees to manage and expand the system.\n\n**Smaller organizations** most likely don’t have the luxury of building an\nentire team to service a design system. Team members in smaller organizations\nhave to wear many (hopefully stylish!) hats out of necessity, so governing the\ndesign system will likely become another responsibility. This may sound like\nan added burden (“Oh great, yet another thing I’m responsible for that doesn’t\ninvolve a pay raise!”), but this particular hat should be a joy to wear as it\nimproves the efficiency and quality of all other work. Hooray for design\nsystems!\n\nTypically, design system makers at smaller organizations will be senior-level\nstaff who have the experience to make thoughtful decisions, and the authority\nto enforce the design system.\n\nAnd then there are **external agencies, contractors, and consultants**. What\nis the role of a third party when it comes to long-term maintenance of a\nclient’s design system? On one hand, external partners are at a bit of a\ndisadvantage since they don’t actually work for their client’s organization. A\nsuccessful design system needs to become part of an organization’s DNA, and\nsince third parties exist outside the company’s walls, their influence is\nintrinsically limited.\n\nBut on the other hand, **external parties can often provide a sense of\nperspective** that’s hard to see while working inside a company. This is where\noutsiders can really shine. In my work as a consultant, I work with\norganizations to establish long-term design system maintenance strategies, and\nhelp get the right people and processes in place. While the long-term success\nof the system will ultimately be up to the organization, third parties can\nteach them to fish and provide important strategic guidance, feedback, and\nperspective.\n\n#### Design system users\n\nWho are the people responsible for using the design system to build new\nfeatures and applications? Who are the people who talk with the system makers\nto report issues and request features?\n\nOnce again, the answers to these questions will largely depend on your\norganization’s size and structure.\n\nDesign system users may be the same team creating the design system, separate\ndevelopment teams within your organization, junior-level designers and\ndevelopers, partner agencies, external development shops, or other third-party\nteams.\n\nUsers’ proximity to and involvement in the creation of the design system will\nundoubtedly vary. You may work on a singular product at a scrappy startup, so\nyour small team could be simultaneously creating and using the design system.\nOr you may work at a large multinational corporation with development teams\nand third-party partners scattered all across the globe. If this is the case,\ndesign system makers and users may seldom (or ever) meet, which means that\nhelpful documentation and a sharp birds-eye perspective become that much more\nimportant.\n\n![There is a spectrum of potential relationships between design system users\nand makers, and the size and makeup of your company will undoubtedly shape\nthose relationships.](../Images/file85.png)\n\nThere is a spectrum of potential relationships between design system users and\nmakers, and the size and makeup of your company will undoubtedly shape those\nrelationships.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of establishing a thoughtful design system is\nthat it allows organizations to scale best practices. If all those best\npractices – responsiveness, accessibility, performance, UX, ergonomics, and so\non – are baked into the system, users can simply plug in the patterns and reap\nthe rewards. This means design system users don’t have to be senior-level\ndesigners or developers to produce good work; the design system serves as a\nquality control vehicle that helps users apply best practices regardless of\neach individual’s skill level.\n\n### Design system team makeup\n\n**A cross-disciplinary team should be established to properly manage,\nmaintain, and extend the system.** All disciplines at an organization – UX\ndesigners, visual designers, content strategists, front-end developers, back-\nend developers, product managers, project managers, executives, and other\nstakeholders – have unique perspectives that can undoubtedly inform and shape\nthe work. Incorporating these perspectives into the design system is\nimportant, but doesn’t necessarily require every discipline to be constantly\ninvolved in developing it.\n\nThere will inevitably be disciplines that actively do the work, while others\nmay take on more of an advisory role. **Those responsible for designing and\nbuilding the user interface – UX designers, visual designers, front-end\ndevelopers — will likely serve as the hands that do the work and make updates\nto the design system.** They should work collaboratively (as detailed in\nchapter 4) and coordinate with other disciplines to ensure that the system\nreflects the values and considerations of the entire business.\n\n**Other people may not be the ones actively doing the work, but must be\nconsulted to make sure their perspectives are properly reflected in the\nsystem.** Back-end engineers need to make the team aware of any architectural\ndecisions that would affect the front-end UI; executives need to make the team\naware of important initiatives that will affect the role and utility of the\nsystem; and, of course, design system users need to coordinate with the makers\nto ensure the system serves the needs of individual applications.\n\n## Make it adaptable\n\nChange is the only constant, as they say. **The _living_ part of a living\ndesign system means that it needs to roll with the punches, adapt to feedback,\nbe iterated on, and evolve alongside the products it serves.**\n\nA misconception about design systems is that once they’re established, they\nbecome an omnipotent and unchangeable source of truth. Thinking in such a\nrigid way is a surefire way to have your design system effort backfire. If\nusers feel handcuffed and pigeonholed into using patterns that don’t solve\ntheir problems, they’ll perceive the design system as a unhelpful tool and\nstart searching elsewhere for something that will better address their needs.\n\nCreating a clear governance plan is essential for making sure your design\nsystem can adapt and thrive as time goes on. A solid governance strategy\nstarts by answering some important questions about handling change. Consider\nthe following:\n\n  * What happens when an existing pattern doesn’t quite work for a specific application? Does the pattern get modified? Do you recommend using a different pattern? Does a new pattern need creating?\n  * How are new pattern requests handled?\n  * How are old patterns retired?\n  * What happens when bugs are found?\n  * Who approves changes to the design system?\n  * Who is responsible for keeping documentation up to date?\n  * Who actually makes changes to the system’s UI patterns?\n  * How are design system changes deployed to live applications?\n  * How will people find out about changes?\n\nThere are likely many more specific questions to answer, but the point is your\nteam should have answers and processes in place to address inevitable changes\nto the system.\n\nAs mentioned a few times already, frequent communication and collaboration\nbetween makers and users is key for successfully governing your design system.\n**Make it as easy as possible for users and makers to communicate.** Set up a\ndesign system Slack or Yammer channel, establish regular office hours, make\nsure your bug ticket software helps facilitate conversation, and keep the\ndoors open for ad hoc chats and calls. If users are stuck on something, they\nshould know exactly where and who to turn to for help.\n\nIn addition to informal day-to-day conversation between makers and users,\n**schedule regular “state of the union” meetings to review the design system**\nwith makers, users, and other key stakeholders. Discuss what’s working, be\nhonest with what needs to be improved, and review priorities and the roadmap\nto make sure the system is serving the needs of the business. These regular\ncheckups are especially helpful for keeping stakeholders up to speed, since\nthey often aren’t involved in the day-to-day of the design system’s\noperations.\n\n### Making changes to patterns\n\nA critical part of design system maintenance is ensuring that UI patterns stay\nup to date, embrace evolving design and development best practices, and\ncontinue to address the real needs of the organization.\n\nDeveloping a strategy for handling pattern changes is crucial, which is why\nInayaili de León Persson and the Canonical web team spent time to map out\ntheir strategy as they created the [Vanilla front-end\nframework](http://ubuntudesign.github.io/vanilla-framework/).\n\n> We thought that it would be good to document the process that a pattern\n> should follow in order to become a Vanilla pattern, so after a little bit of\n> brainstorming, we created a diagram that shows the different steps that\n> should be taken from before submitting a pattern proposal to its full\n> acceptance as a Vanilla pattern. [Inayaili de León Persson,\n> Canonical](http://design.canonical.com/2016/07/getting-vanilla-ready-\n> for-v1-the-roadmap/)\n\nThe result is a gorgeous decision tree that maps out exactly what processes\nneed to happen to add a new pattern to the design system.\n\n![The Canonical web team mapped out the decision process used to manage\nupdates and additions to patterns in the Vanilla front-end\nframework.](../Images/file86.png)\n\nThe Canonical web team mapped out the decision process used to manage updates\nand additions to patterns in the Vanilla front-end framework.\n\nThe three types of change that can happen to patterns in a design system are\nmodification, addition, and removal.\n\n#### Modifying patterns\n\nUI patterns can and should be modified for a number of reasons: feature\nadditions, bug fixes, subtle or major visual design tweaks, performance\nimprovements, accessibility enhancements, code refactoring, UX best practice\nupdates, and so on.\n\nThe design system maintainers need to understand why and when to tweak\npatterns, how to go about making those changes, and how to roll out those\nimprovements into individual applications.\n\nKeeping patterns fresh is essential for the long-term health of the design\nsystem. Nobody wants to use and maintain a Web 2.0-looking design system full\nof bevels and crusty code!\n\n#### Adding patterns\n\nAs smart as your team surely is, it’s quite possible you won’t think of every\nconceivable pattern to include in your design system right out of the gate. As\nthe system is applied to more products, gaps will inevitably emerge where the\nneeds of the application aren’t solved by existing patterns. In such cases, it\nwill become clear that new patterns will need created to address these needs.\n\nCare should be taken when adding patterns to the library. **If every whim\nresults in a brand new pattern, the design system will become a bloated and\nunwieldy Wild West.** It’s worth asking if this is a one-off situation or\nsomething that can be leveraged in other applications.\n\nPerhaps you may want to assume a one-off until a different team encounters a\nsimilar use case. If the team working on Application 2 looks at Application 1\nand says, “I want that!” perhaps that’s a good indicator that a one-off\npattern should be added to the pattern library.\n\n#### Removing patterns\n\nPatterns can be deprecated for a number of reasons. Perhaps you discover\nthrough use that a particular pattern is a terrible idea. Hindsight is 20/20,\nmy friend. Maybe the industry has moved away from a pattern for UX or\ntechnical reasons. Perhaps a pattern sat there unused by any application for\nages. Maybe users reported back with a lot of negative feedback about working\nwith a particular pattern.\n\nHaving a plan for deprecating patterns is a great idea. But how do you remove\npatterns from the design system without pulling the rug out from under people\nrelying on those patterns in their applications? To address this issue,\nSalesforce created a neat utility called [Sass\nDeprecate](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/sass-deprecate) that flags\npatterns that are heading to the chopping block in the near future. Through\nsome clever use of Sass variable flags and styling, the maker team can give a\nheads-up to users that a particular pattern is being deprecated, and recommend\nan alternative pattern instead.\n\n## Make it maintainable\n\nWith all this talk about modifying, adding, and removing patterns, you may be\nwondering, “How the hell are our applications supposed to actually keep up\nwith all these changes?!” And in asking that question, you will have stumbled\non to one of the biggest challenges organizations face in successfully\nmaintaining a design system.\n\n> The biggest existential threat to any system is neglect. [Alex Schleifer,\n> Airbnb](http://airbnb.design/the-way-we-build/)\n\nMany systems fall into a state of disrepair because the effort required to\nmake updates is far too high. If it’s difficult and time-consuming to update\npatterns, documentation, and applications, people will eventually get so\nfrustrated that they stop making the effort and the design system will begin\nits drift into oblivion. **Making updates to UI patterns, documentation, and\napplications should be as frictionless as possible** , so reducing this\nfriction should become a high priority for the design system team. This\ninvolves careful consideration from both technological and workflow\nstandpoints.\n\n### In search of the holy grail\n\n**The design system holy grail involves creating an environment where the\npattern library and live applications are perfectly in sync.** The idea is\nthat you should be able to make a change to a UI pattern and see that change\nautomatically reflected in both the pattern library _and_ anywhere the pattern\nis included in production.\n\n![The holy grail of design systems is an environment where making changes to a\nUI pattern updates both the pattern library and production applications\nsimultaneously.](../Images/file87.png)\n\nThe holy grail of design systems is an environment where making changes to a\nUI pattern updates both the pattern library and production applications\nsimultaneously.\n\nThis technique removes any duplication of effort and ensures the pattern\nlibrary and the applications using the patterns remain synchronized. Sounds\nlike a dream, right?\n\nAs it turns out, this dream can be a reality. Lonely Planet, the travel guide\ncompany, was one of the first to establish a holy grail design system called\n[Rizzo](http://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/). Through some smart architecture, they\ncreated an API for their UI patterns that feeds into their production\nenvironment as well as their pattern library. The result is a centralized\ndesign system that ensures their live application and documentation remain\nperfectly in sync.\n\n![Lonely Planet created an API for its UI patterns that is consumed by both\ntheir pattern library and production environment. By constructing their design\nsystem in this manner, changes to UI patterns are automatically reflected in\nboth the pattern library and production environment.](../Images/file88.png)\n\nLonely Planet created an API for its UI patterns that is consumed by both\ntheir pattern library and production environment. By constructing their design\nsystem in this manner, changes to UI patterns are automatically reflected in\nboth the pattern library and production environment.\n\nThis approach is no easy task, as it requires sophisticated technical\narchitecture, smart people to set it all up, and a relatively centralized\norganizational culture. How you go about chasing the holy grail – or even if\nyou can achieve it – is dependent on a whole load of factors, including your\ntechnical architecture and organizational makeup.\n\n### Clearing technical hurdles\n\nKeeping a pattern library in sync with production environments requires\nsharing code in a smart, scalable, and maintainable way. Detailing all the\ndifferent technical strategies and considerations around the holy grail would\nnecessitate its own book, but let’s cover a few important areas around keeping\nfront-end code in sync.\n\n#### The front-end of things\n\nA UI design system manifests itself as the front-end of a web experience,\nwhich is comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. How we get that front-end\ncode into a production environment, with complex application logic and back-\nend code, is the task at hand.\n\nIn his article “[Chasing the Holy\nGrail*](https://medium.com/@marcelosomers/chasing-the-holy-grail-\nbbc0b7cce365#.ay1xeej7d),” web developer Marcelo Somers details various\ntechnical approaches to achieving the holy grail. He highlights the pros and\ncons of each strategy for feeding a design system into applications to keep\nboth codebases in lockstep. While I won’t detail each of Marcelo’s strategies,\nit’s worth noting there is a spectrum of approaches to choose from: crude,\nmanual front-end code copying-and-pasting on one end, to baking the pattern\nlibrary directly into the production environment on the other.\n\nIn my experience, I’ve found that sharing CSS and presentational JavaScript\nwith production environments is relatively easy, while sharing markup is\ntough. Because CSS and JavaScript tend to get compiled into a single file (or\nperhaps a handful of files), it becomes possible to throw them onto a CDN and\nthen simply link to those files in each application. Marcelo explains how to\ndo this while keeping versioning in mind:\n\n> You’d provide development teams with a versioned URL (e.g.,\n> http://mycdn.com/1.3.5/styles.css) and upgrading is as simple as bumping the\n> version number in the URL. [Marcelo\n> Somers](https://medium.com/@marcelosomers/chasing-the-holy-grail-\n> bbc0b7cce365#.ay1xeej7d)\n\nSharing CSS and JavaScript is all well and good, but where things get tricky\nis when you want to share markup between environments. Why? you ask. Well,\nmarkup and back-end logic are often intertwined in an application’s codebase,\nwhich tends to make it difficult to simply copy and paste markup between your\npattern library and production environments. Thankfully, there are ways around\nthis problem.\n\n#### Bridging the markup gap with templating languages\n\nUsing HTML templating languages (such as Mustache, Handlebars, Twig,\nUnderscore, Jade, Nunjucks, and a slew of others) makes markup more portable\nand dynamic. Templating languages separate structure and data, and supercharge\nour HTML to keep us from having to write the same markup patterns over and\nover again. The good news is that many CMSes and application environments also\nmake use of templating languages to serve up front-end markup.\n\n**The templating language can serve as the bridge between your pattern library\nand production environments.** If you use a templating language to create the\npatterns in your design system (something we discussed at length in chapter\n3), you can easily share those patterns with production environments that\nutilize the same templating engine.\n\n![A templating language like Mustache, Handlebars, Underscore, Jade, and\nothers can serve as a bridge that allows front-end code to be shared between\nthe pattern library and production application.](../Images/file89.png)\n\nA templating language like Mustache, Handlebars, Underscore, Jade, and others\ncan serve as a bridge that allows front-end code to be shared between the\npattern library and production application.\n\nThe team at Phase2 Technology achieved the holy grail by using Pattern Lab as\ntheir pattern library development tool and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) as\ntheir content management system. Because both Pattern Lab and Drupal support\nthe popular [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org) templating engine, Phase2 is\nable to easily share patterns between the two environments, ensuring their\nclients’ pattern libraries and production builds are always in step with each\nother.\n\n> By using the same templating engine, along with the help of the Component\n> Libraries Drupal Module, the tool gives Drupal the ability to directly\n> include, extend, and embed the Twig templates that Pattern Lab uses for its\n> components without any template duplication at all! [Evan Lovely, Phase2\n> Technology](https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/introducing-pattern-lab-\n> starter-8/)\n\n### Is your culture holy grail compatible?\n\nYou may have read that last section and thought, “That’s amazing! My company\nneeds this now!” While holy grail systems are indeed great, there are reasons\nwhy you may _not_ be able to automagically keep your production environments\nand pattern library in sync. Perhaps your organization creates tons of digital\nproducts on many different platforms using wildly different technologies.\nMaybe you’re a giant multinational company scattered all over the world. Maybe\nyour company has an extremely decentralized, autonomous culture. Or maybe\nyou’re a gigantic federal government.\n\n![The Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are the design system for the United\nStates federal government.](../Images/file90.png)\n\nThe Draft U.S. Web Design Standards are the design system for the United\nStates federal government.\n\nThe U.S. government’s design system – called the [Draft U.S. Web Digital\nStandards](https://standards.usa.gov/) – is a collection of UI components and\nvisual styles created to help people making government websites build more\nconsistent UIs. The design system provides markup and styles for users to\ndownload and weave into their applications. It would certainly be amazing to\nsee a holy grail design system implemented at such a gigantic scale, but as\nyou might imagine, that’s a pretty tall order. The vastness and decentralized\nnature of the organization means that a synchronized pattern library isn’t\nreally achievable without some dramatic restructuring of how federal\ngovernment websites get built.\n\nIf a relatively scattered, decentralized culture is your reality, don’t be\ndisheartened! Even getting _some_ design system in place – a handful of go-to\nUI patterns, some helpful documentation, and guiding principles – can show\nyour organization the light that points towards the grail. As we’ve discussed\nthroughout this chapter, these efforts should be ongoing, and before you can\nrun you must first learn to crawl.\n\n## Make it cross-disciplinary\n\nStyle guides often jump straight into code snippets and pattern usage for the\nbenefit of the design system users. Of course, a pattern library needs to be\nhelpful for the people actually making use of the patterns, but **treating a\nstyle guide solely as a developer resource limits its potential**.\n\n**A style guide has the opportunity to serve as a watering hole for the entire\norganization** , helping establish a common vocabulary for every discipline\ninvested in the success of the company’s digital products. Establishing this\ncommon vocabulary can lead to more efficient work, better communication, and\nmore collaboration between disciplines across the organization. That’s why the\nstyle guide should be an inviting place for everybody, not just design system\nusers.\n\nTake the carousel (please!). This component is amazingly complex from an\norganizational standpoint. A homepage carousel on an e-commerce website\nrequires input from a host of disciplines across the organization. Business\nowners and editorial staff must choose products to be featured in the\ncarousel. Copywriters must ensure the copy is effective and stays within the\nconstraints of the design. Art directors need to make certain the aesthetic\ndesign is pleasing and the product photography is legible across every screen\nsize. UX designers have to confirm the functionality and controls are\nintuitive. Front-end people must be sure the component is responsive,\naccessible, and performant. Back-end developers need to ensure the component\nis properly wired up to the back-end system. You get the idea.\n\n![A homepage carousel on a site like Walmart requires input from many\ndifferent disciplines and stakeholders. A style guide can help gather those\ndifferent perspectives under one roof.](../Images/file91.jpg)\n\nA homepage carousel on a site like Walmart requires input from many different\ndisciplines and stakeholders. A style guide can help gather those different\nperspectives under one roof.\n\nA well-crafted style guide can help manage all these moving parts and ensure\nthe many perspectives that influence each pattern are properly documented in\nthe style guide. Make the pattern library accessible to every discipline, and\nthink about how to make it easy and inviting for different disciplines to\ncontribute to the documentation.\n\n## Make it approachable\n\nIt should come as a surprise to no one that people tend to gravitate towards\nattractive things. A big part of making a style guide a cross-disciplinary\nresource is ensuring the container that houses your pattern library and other\ndocumentation is good-looking, inviting, and easy to navigate.\n\n![Yelp's style guide has an attractive, friendly front page that explains what\nthe resource is, who it's for, and how to use it.](../Images/file13.jpg)\n\nYelp's style guide has an attractive, friendly front page that explains what\nthe resource is, who it's for, and how to use it.\n\nTaking the time to craft an attractive home for your style guide and\ndocumentation can lead to more usage, help build awareness, help create\norganizational investment, and help get non-developers’ eyeballs on the style\nguide. All of this contributes to that important shared vocabulary that leads\nto better cross-disciplinary collaboration.\n\nBut creating a great-looking, intuitive style guide experience doesn’t just\nhappen, and this can be problematic when getting a style guide off the ground.\nIf teams think that making a useful style guide involves making some Big,\nOfficial Thing with custom branding and a glossy website, they might be\ndeterred from ever starting the initiative. So remember:\n\n  1. Make a thing.\n  2. Show that it’s useful.\n  3. Make it official.\n\nCreating a useful design system should be the team’s first priority. Building\na happy home to contain it all might not happen straightaway, but should\nbecome a bigger priority once the design system becomes official. Making a\ngood-looking style guide isn’t just design for design’s sake; **it reflects an\norganization’s commitment to making and maintaining a thoughtful, deliberate\ndesign system**.\n\n## Make it visible\n\nVisibility is critically important to the ongoing health of your design\nsystem. Such an important endeavor shouldn’t be tucked away in a dark corner\nof your intranet. What steps can you take to ensure the design system remains\na cornerstone of your design and development workflows?\n\n### Design system evangelism\n\nYou can create the best style guide in world, use the most sophisticated\ntechnology, have an amazing team in place, and have excited users, but if you\ndon’t actively promote the design system and communicate changes, the entire\neffort will suffer greatly.\n\nEvangelizing your design system efforts can and should happen even before the\nsystem is off the ground. At the onset of your project, you can set up places\nto document progress of the project to help garner awareness and excitement\nfor the design system effort. One client of mine set up an internal blog to\npublish updates to the project, as well as a design system Yammer channel\nwhere developers and other interested parties can share ideas, address\nconcerns, give feedback, and ask questions. Establishing a culture of\ncommunication early in the process will increase the likelihood of the design\nsystem taking root.\n\n#### Communicating change\n\nOnce the design system is off the ground and is being used in real\napplications, it’s imperative to communicate changes, updates, and an ongoing\nvision to the entire organization.\n\nThe tactics for this communication can vary from nuts-and-bolts utilities to\nmore outward-facing marketing efforts. Here are some materials that can help\ncommunicate change:\n\n  * **Change logs** : “Here’s what’s changed in the pattern library this month.”\n  * **Roadmap** : “Here’s what’s coming up over the next few months.”\n  * **Success stories** : “Team X launched this great new application using the design system; read more about how they did it.”\n  * **Tips and tricks** : “Here are a few best practices and considerations for using our system’s buttons throughout your application.”\n\nHaving a base for all these materials is a great idea, and keeping them\nadjacent to (or even within) the style guide itself makes a lot of sense as\nwell.\n\n![The material design team publishes a handy changelog within its style guide\nso users can easily learn about the latest updates and improvements to the\nsystem.](../Images/file92.png)\n\nThe material design team publishes a handy changelog within its style guide so\nusers can easily learn about the latest updates and improvements to the\nsystem.\n\n**Design system changes, updates, and requests should be communicated wherever\nyour team hangs out.** That may include Slack, Basecamp, GitHub, wikis,\nYammer, email lists, company blogs, intranets, and any other internal tools\nyour team uses to communicate and collaborate. If that sounds like a lot of\nwork to you, fear not! Keeping your team and users updated doesn’t have to\nrequire a huge manual effort. Thanks to the connected nature of our tools,\nteams can automatically get alerted to changes via software, as Micah Sivitz\nfrom Shyp explains:\n\n> Whenever someone makes a pull request, it sends a notification to our\n> #Design slack channel, announcing to the team that there is a proposal\n> change and feedback is required. [Micah Sivitz,\n> Shyp](https://medium.com/shyp-design/managing-style-guides-at-\n> shyp-c217116c8126)\n\nBaking this communication into the team’s everyday workflow keeps makers,\nusers, and stakeholders engaged, and helps reassure users that the pattern\nlibrary is being actively maintained and improved.\n\n#### Training and support\n\nYou wouldn’t hand someone a hammer, saw, and screwdriver then say, “All right,\nyou’ve got what you need; now go and build me a beautiful new house.” Knowing\nhow to properly use a tool is often even more important than that tool’s\navailability. Documentation in the form of a style guide is no doubt helpful,\nbut by itself it’s not enough. It’s essential to provide adequate training and\noffer ongoing support for your design system’s users to ensure they\nsuccessfully get up and running with the tool kit and continue to create great\nwork with it.\n\nTraining users how to work with the design system can take many forms,\nincluding:\n\n  * **Pair sessions** : Nothing beats pulling up a chair and working together on a project. While more time-intensive than other training vehicles, it’s the best way to get makers and users collaborating together, learning how the system works, and exposing new opportunities and shortcomings.\n  * **Workshops** : From immersive full-day sessions to quick walk-throughs, it’s incredibly helpful to set up face-to-face training workshops involving both makers and users. These sessions can help smooth out any misconceptions about the system, help level-up users with hands-on guidance, and create a healthy relationship between the people in charge of maintaining the system and the people in charge of working with it.\n  * **Webinars** : If workshops or pair sessions aren’t possible, or you need to train a lot of users at scale, webinars can be fantastic. Users can tune into online sessions to learn about how to properly use the system. When conducting webinars, be sure to build in plenty of Q&A time to field both audio and typed questions, concerns, and comments.\n  * **Tutorials** : A series of blog posts and screencasts can neatly encapsulate core concepts of working with the design system. Not only do these help serve as a training tool, but they can serve as a great reference to keep coming back to.\n  * **Onboarding** : A great way of injecting your design system into your company culture is to bake design system training right into the onboarding process for new employees. New colleagues will understand the importance of modularity, reuse, and all the other benefits a design system brings.\n\nUsers will undoubtedly have questions or encounter issues once they get up and\nrunning and start building things with the design system. They need to know\nthere’s a robust support system in place to help answer any questions, listen\nto their requirements, and address bugs. There are a host of mechanisms in\nplace to provide support for users, including:\n\n  * **Issue trackers** : Tools like JIRA and GitHub Issues are great for users and makers to report bugs and have technical conversations. Users should be aware of the protocol for filing bugs and feel empowered to contribute.\n  * **Office hours** : Schedule regular times when the design system team is available to field questions, address issues, and talk about what’s next for the design system.\n  * **Slack and chat tools** : The real-time nature of many of our work collaboration tools presents a huge opportunity to keep the pattern-laden conversation going. Thanks to tools like Slack, Yammer, and HipChat, makers and users can engage one another whenever and wherever.\n  * **Forums** : Communities like Stack Overflow and GitHub have proved to be extremely effective at enabling grassroots, community-driven support. Rather than design system makers becoming a support bottleneck, it can be worthwhile to open up support to the entire user community.\n  * **Outreach** : Not everyone has the time or the personality to ask questions and suggest changes. Design system makers should be proactive and reach out to developers using the design system to see if they have any issues or concerns. These kinds of actions can help build a genuine and positive relationship between makers and users.\n\n![The Draft U.S. Web Digital Standards system tracks issues using GitHub,\nproviding a place for users and makers to file bugs and have conversations\nabout the nitty-gritty.](../Images/file93.png)\n\nThe Draft U.S. Web Digital Standards system tracks issues using GitHub,\nproviding a place for users and makers to file bugs and have conversations\nabout the nitty-gritty.\n\nThanks to tools like GitHub, design system users don’t have to be relegated to\nthe role of dumb consumers. The people who use the system day in and day out\ncan be extremely valuable contributors to the design system if given the\nchance. Embrace the fact that users are eager to pitch in and make the system\nas great as it can be. Here are some tactics for encouraging user\ncontributions:\n\n  * **Suggestions and pull requests** : Encourage anyone using the design system to suggest changes and new features. Better yet, invite users to submit changes in the form of pull requests that can be merged directly back into the codebase.\n  * **Individual interviews and roundtable discussions** : It’s always a good idea to talk to users, so regularly schedule time to chat with the people who are touching these patterns on a regular basis. Take it all in, listen to both the good and the bad, and collectively determine a plan of attack to address any issues and suggestions.\n  * **Requests for feedback** : Managing a system that can potentially be deployed to hundreds of applications can be tricky. Before pulling the trigger on decisions that could impact a lot of people, ask for opinions: “We’re considering deprecating our carousel pattern and would like to hear what you think.”\n  * **Surveys** : If interviews aren’t feasible, you can lean on quick surveys to get a feel for how effective UI patterns and the style guide are. Questions like “On a scale from one to five, how useful is the pattern documentation? Any suggestions?” can help identify blind spots and get users to suggest features that would make their lives easier.\n  * **Regular “state of the union” meetings** : Schedule regular meetings where the design system team discusses the product roadmap, lessons learned along the way, and suggestions and feedback. Encourage anyone to join the meeting, and be sure to record and distribute these sessions so everyone is aware of the master plan.\n\n### Make it public\n\nCommunicating change, evangelizing, and setting up proper training and support\nare all great things to increase your system’s visibility. But there’s another\nbig opportunity to take your communication strategy to another level: **making\nyour style guide publicly accessible**.\n\nWhy? Isn’t a style guide merely an internal resource to help people in your\norganization work better together? What use is it to the outside world? And\nwouldn’t publishing your style guide give away all your trade secrets?\n\n**Publishing your style guide for the world to see increases its visibility,\nincreases accountability, and serves as an amazing recruitment tool.**\n\nPutting your style guide behind a login or firewall reduces visibility and\nadds an unnecessary burden to your team and partners, which limits the\nresource’s effectiveness and potential. And the fears about giving away your\ntrade secrets are completely unfounded. These are UI patterns, not nuclear\ncodes.\n\n![Styleguides.io rounds up over 150 public-facing style guides from\norganizations across the world.](../Images/file94.png)\n\nStyleguides.io rounds up over 150 public-facing style guides from\norganizations across the world.\n\nIn addition to making important documentation easier to access, a public style\nguide **helps create organizational accountability**. Publishing your style\nguide demonstrates your organization’s commitment to the design system, which\ncreates a helpful bit of pressure to keep it an up-to-date and useful\nresource.\n\nPublic-facing style guides are also **hugely helpful for recruiting**.\nDesigners, developers, and people working in other disciplines want to work\nfor organizations that embrace modern digital best practices, and (as we’ve\ndiscussed throughout this book) design systems are quickly becoming an\nindustry-wide best practice. Publishing your style guide sends out a strong\nBat-Signal that can attract passionate, pattern-minded people. For instance,\nstyle guide expert Jina Bolton went to work at Salesforce after seeing the\ncompany’s style guide for their Salesforce1 product.\n\n> When I saw [Salesforce’s style guide] I thought it was beautiful and it’s\n> why I wanted to join this team. [Jina\n> Bolton](http://styleguides.io/podcast/jina-bolton/)\n\nSince joining Salesforce, she’s helped create the ultra-successful Lightning\nDesign System and helps manage their growing design system team. Jina’s story\nis not an isolated one; almost every guest Anna Debenham and I interviewed on\nthe [Styleguides Podcast](http://styleguides.io/podcast) discussed how helpful\ntheir public-facing pattern library was for attracting talent. All that means\nyour public style guide makes your organization _more_ competitive, not less.\n\n## Make it bigger\n\nA visible, cross-disciplinary, approachable pattern library is one that your\nteam will come back to again and again. Use that to your advantage. Since the\nteam’s eyeballs are already fixated on that one resource, there’s a big\nopportunity to extend it to include other helpful documentation like the voice\nand tone, brand, code, design principles and writing guidelines we discussed\nin chapter 1.\n\n![Intuit's Harmony design system includes a pattern library, design\nprinciples, voice and tone, marketing guidelines, and more. Housing this\nhelpful documentation under one roof helps increase its visibility and\neffectiveness.](../Images/file95.png)\n\nIntuit's Harmony design system includes a pattern library, design principles,\nvoice and tone, marketing guidelines, and more. Housing this helpful\ndocumentation under one roof helps increase its visibility and effectiveness.\n\nNow, your organization may not need to implement every flavor of style guide\nout there, but the point is that **creating a centralized style guide hub\nbuilds more awareness of best practices, increasing the documentation’s\neffectiveness**.\n\nAnother way to extend the functionality of the pattern library is to include\nguidelines for native platform patterns alongside web-based patterns. We can\nlook to Intuit’s Harmony design system once again for an example of how native\nmobile platform patterns for iOS and Android can live beside their web-based\ncounterparts.\n\n![Intuit's Harmony pattern library includes buttons to switch between web,\niOS, and Android for each pattern. This allows the team to maintain a mostly\nconsistent design system across platforms but also document pattern\ndivergences when they occur.](../Images/file96.png)\n\nIntuit's Harmony pattern library includes buttons to switch between web, iOS,\nand Android for each pattern. This allows the team to maintain a mostly\nconsistent design system across platforms but also document pattern\ndivergences when they occur.\n\n## Make it context-agnostic\n\nThe way your UI patterns are named will undoubtedly shape how they are used.\n**The more agnostic pattern names are, the more versatile and reusable they\nbecome.**\n\nBecause we tend to establish UI patterns in the context of a broader page, it\ncan be tempting to name components based on where they live. But rather than\nnaming your component “homepage carousel” (forgive my morbid obsession with\ncarousels), you can simply call it “carousel,” which means you can now put\ncarousels everywhere! (But for the love of all that is holy, please don’t.)\n\nAnother challenge for naming _display_ patterns is that we tend to get\ndistracted by the _content_ patterns that live inside them. For instance, if\nworking on an e-commerce site, you may be tempted to call a block containing a\nproduct image and title a “product card.” But naming things in this manner\nimmediately limits what type of content can live inside it. By naming the\npattern simply “card,” you can put all sorts of content patterns inside it:\nproducts, promotions, store locations, and so on.\n\nFair warning: **naming things is really freaking hard**. But there are\nstrategies to help you create robust names for your patterns. Conducting an\ninterface inventory (as detailed in chapter 4) helps remove patterns from the\ncontext of the page where they normally reside, meaning your team can create\nnames that aren’t distracted by their context. I’ve conducted naming exercises\nwith teams where we’ve blurred out the content residing inside a pattern so\neveryone can focus on the pattern’s _structure_ rather than the _content_ that\nlives inside it.\n\n![A good exercise when naming patterns is to blur out the content so your\nnames reflect the patterns' structures rather than the content living inside\nthem.](../Images/file97.png)\n\nA good exercise when naming patterns is to blur out the content so your names\nreflect the patterns' structures rather than the content living inside them.\n\nWhile naming things will always be a challenge, pattern names that are\nagnostic to context and content will be more portable, reusable, and\nversatile.\n\n## Make it contextual\n\nShowcasing UI patterns in a pattern library is all well and good, but **you\nneed to demonstrate context for design system users to understand how and\nwhere to properly use them**. Most pattern libraries show a demo of each UI\npattern, but as we’ve discussed, those patterns don’t live in a vacuum. Where\nexactly are these patterns used?\n\nOne way to demonstrate context might include showing screenshots or videos of\na component in action. Material design’s documentation does a fantastic job at\nthis; each component is rich with photos, videos, and usage details to give\nusers a clear understanding of what these patterns look like in the context of\nan application, and demonstrate how each pattern should be used.\n\n![Material design's component library doesn't just contain an example of each\ncomponent; it thoroughly documents the component's usage with plenty of images\nand videos to support it.](../Images/file98.png)\n\nMaterial design's component library doesn't just contain an example of each\ncomponent; it thoroughly documents the component's usage with plenty of images\nand videos to support it.\n\nAnother way to show context is to provide lineage information for each\npattern. As we discussed in Chapter 3, a tool like Pattern Lab automatically\ngenerates this information, letting you see which patterns make up any given\ncomponent in addition to showing where each component is employed. This\nprovides a sort of pattern paper trail that helps immensely with QA efforts,\nas it highlights exactly which patterns and templates would need to be tested\nif changes were made to a particular pattern.\n\n![Tools like Pattern Lab provide lineage information, allowing teams to see\nwhich smaller components are included in any given component, as well as where\neach pattern gets used.](../Images/file54.png)\n\nTools like Pattern Lab provide lineage information, allowing teams to see\nwhich smaller components are included in any given component, as well as where\neach pattern gets used.\n\n## Make it last\n\nMaking a design system is an incredibly and important endeavor. But without\nproper maintenance, the value of your design system will depreciate much like\na car that’s just been driven off the dealer’s lot. Instead, your design\nsystem should be like a bottle of fine wine that increases in value over time.\n\n![Bottles of fine wine and a used car lot](../Images/file99.jpg)\n\nWith proper maintenance, your design system should increase in value over time\nlike a bottle of fine wine, rather than a used car that's just been driven off\nthe lot. Image credit: [Sabin Paul Croce on Flickr](https://flic.kr/p/on4ffK)\nand [Ray Larabie on Flickr](https://flic.kr/p/e35AtD)\n\nAs we’ve discussed throughout this chapter, making your design system stand\nthe test of time requires a significant amount of time and effort. But isn’t\nthat the case with all living things? Animals need to eat, and plants need\nwater and sunlight in order to survive. Creating a living design system means\ngiving it attention and care in order for it to continue to thrive.\n\nAll that effort not only creates a better present for your organization, but\nsets you up for long-term success. Establishing a clear governance plan,\ncommunicating change, and implementing the other advice found in this chapter\nhelps the design system take root and become an integral part of your\norganization’s workflow. Creating the damn thing in the first place is the\nhard part, but once established, you have a solid foundation with which to\nbuild on for years to come. Even if you were to burn everything down and\nrebuild a new system from the ground up, you’ll find your UIs will still need\nbuttons, form fields, tabs, and other existing components. And you’ll need a\nhappy home to display and document the system. Don’t throw the baby out with\nthe bathwater!\n\nSo there you have it. To make a maintainable design system, you should:\n\n  * **Make it official** by allocating real time, money, and resources to your design system.\n  * **Make it adaptable** by counting on change and establishing a clear governance plan.\n  * **Make it maintainable** by seeking the holy grail and making it easy to deploy and communicate changes to the design system.\n  * **Make it cross-disciplinary** by making your pattern library a watering hole the entire organization can gather around.\n  * **Make it approachable** by making an attractive, easy-to-use style guide with helpful accompanying documentation.\n  * **Make it visible** by communicating change, evangelizing the design system, and making it public.\n  * **Make it bigger** by including brand, voice and tone, code, design principles, and writing guidelines.\n  * **Make it agnostic** by naming patterns according to their structure rather than their context or content.\n  * **Make it contextual** by demonstrating what patterns make up a particular pattern and showing where each pattern is used.\n  * **Make it last** by laying a solid foundation with which to build on for years to come.\n\n## Go forth and be atomic\n\nWe’re tasked with making a whole slew of products, sites, and applications\nwork and look great across a dizzying array of different devices, screen\nsizes, form factors, and environments. I hope that the concepts covered in\nthis book give you solid ground to stand on as you bravely tackle this\nincreasingly diverse digital landscape. By creating design systems, being\ndeliberate in how you construct user interfaces, establishing a collaborative\nand pattern-driven workflow, and setting up processes to successfully maintain\nyour design system, I hope you and your team can create great things together.\nGo forth and be atomic!\n\n\nArtboard 1Thanks &AcknowledgementsWithout these people this book wouldn't\nexist.\n\nThis book is dedicated to my amazing wife **Melissa** , who supports all of my\ncrazy ideas and somehow puts up with all of my shit.

Thanks to **Rachel\nAndrew** for wrangling all the technical stuff that goes into making ebooks.\nAnd a big thanks to **Rachel Arnold Sager** for all your work getting the\nprint version of the book laid out and ready for the printer.\n\nTo **Anna Debenham** for all your amazing thinking about front-end style\nguides, your [book](http://maban.co.uk/projects/front-end-style-guides/) on\nthe topic, and your willingness to co-host a podcast all about style guides\nwith me. I’m proud of the work we’ve done on\n[Styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/) and I’m so happy we got to work\ntogether.\n\nTo **Jonathan Snook** for your fantastic SMACSS methodology, and for taking\nthe time to guide me through the process of self-publishing a book. Thanks for\nmaking such a scary endeavor a lot more approachable.\n\nTo **Stephen Hay** , who was the first person I heard articulate the need to\nbreak interfaces into smaller pieces. Thanks for being a continued source of\nwisdom and sarcasm.\n\nTo **Andy Clarke** , who was talking about design systems and\n[atoms](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/an-extract-from-designing-\natoms-and-elements) before it was the hip thing to do. Thank you for all your\nwriting and thinking, but you’re still not getting my dog.\n\nTo Dave “Tiny Bootstraps” Rupert, Susan Robertson, Samantha Warren, Jina\nBolton, Nathan Curtis, Paul Robert Lloyd, Harry Roberts, Nicole Sullivan,\nBrett Jankord, Tyler Sticka, Lincoln Mongillo, Nicholas Gallagher and the many\nothers who have advanced the concepts of design systems, pattern libraries,\nand style guides. Thanks for helping me and so many others think more\nmodularly.\n\nTo Jeffrey Zeldman, Eric Meyer, Marc Thiele, Vitaly Friedman, and all the\nother conference organizers who gave me the opportunity to stumble onto the\nstage to ramble on about the concepts contained in this book.\n\nThis book would not have been possible if it weren’t for the amazing work done\nby some amazing people in the web community. I’m so incredibly fortunate to\nwork in such an open, sharing, and collaborative community; every day I look\nforward to learning new things from you all.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, thanks so much to my family for all your\nlove and amazing support over the years.\n\n\nArtboard 1ResourcesA list of all the resources referenced in the book\n\n## Chapter 1\n\n  * [Scope Components, Not

The problems you are\nsolving become more evident as you gain a better understanding of the user\nbase. As your comprehension grows, ideas and solutions are formed. Each member\nof the team has a part to play in crafting the user experience of that\nproduct.\n\n_The Designer:_ You have a system for housing design files, but they aren’t\neasily accessible to product managers and developers. Collaborating with those\noutside of the design department is time-consuming. Screenshots and exported\nartboards are shared back and forth, and there are constant updates and tweaks\nrequired. With no overarching guidelines for your work, you find yourself\ndefending the same choices and solutions over and over again. Looking for the\nright design file becomes a sport, and it can be hard to remember who worked\non what. To make matters worse, you don’t feel like you have any real input\ninto the product road map. By the time you become involved, the product\nmanager is focused on a solution rather than the problem being solved.\n\n_The Front-end Engineer:_ Much of your time is spent on developing the same\ncode solutions within different contexts. You try to provide feedback to the\ndesign team, but it often feels as though you not only work in different\ndepartments, you work on different planets. You don’t have access to design\nfiles and don’t have much insight into the why or how behind the decisions the\ndesign team is making. You are noticing inconsistencies in the text, color,\nand spacing across screens, and the code is a mess.\n\n_The Product Manager:_ There is a lot of pressure from users and other\nstakeholders to deliver. The road map is long, and the resources are small. It\nfeels as though there aren’t enough designers and developers available to\nhandle all the work that needs to be done. There are lots of minor problems\nyou think you can solve on your own, but you don’t want to step on anyone’s\ntoes. It would be great if the design department could give more input on the\nroad map and vision for the product, but you know they are stretched thin.\n\nSomehow, amid all of this chaos, you need to provide users with a top-notch\nuser experience.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, don’t worry; you are not alone. As products, teams,\nand organizations scale, it becomes more difficult to maintain speed and\nefficiency without a concerted effort. In this book, we will show you how, and\nwhen, a design system can be used to solve the problems faced by teams\nbuilding one product or many.\n\nDesign systems offer a way for organizations to build products at scale. Don’t\nlet the name fool you; design systems are not just for designers. They benefit\nthe entire organization and offer a foundation for collaboration and\ninnovation. Design systems are a collection of shared principles and practices\nthat help to inform the work of designers, product managers, and engineers, as\nwell as sales and marketing. They offer a single source of truth and are the\nguiding light for the design and development of a product’s user experience.\n\nWhy design systems and why now? Design systems are not new. They are the\ndescendant of the traditional graphic standards manual. These printed manuals\nwere a practical way to relay design guidelines for corporation and\norganizations before the advent of the Internet. Often hefty, these manuals\nprovided the governing principles and practical guidelines for applying a\nvisual language across all areas of a company.\n\nDesign systems are the natural evolution of the graphic standards manual for\ntoday’s organizations. They are the result of the need to coordinate and align\nthe different disciplines necessary to bring digital products to life. These\nsystems do more than merely convey design guidelines such as typeface, logo,\nor color standards. They unite designers, developers, and product managers\nalong a set of core principles while enabling their work through reusable\ncomponents.\n\nThroughout our careers, we have been involved in developing many different\nsystems for design. We have watched the evolution from a simple collection of\npatterns and styles to today’s robust systems containing principles, design,\nand code. Within this book, we’ve combined our mistakes and successes, in\norder to share what we have learned every step of the way.\n\n## What We’ll Cover\n\nWe begin by looking at the history of systems in design to gain perspective on\nhow this has affected the design systems of today. You’ll learn about the\nintersection of art, technology, and industry during the early days of the Web\nand examine the technological advancements that led to the prevalence of CSS\nand JavaScript in the digital landscape. You’ll come to understand why design\nsystems have risen in popularity and how they align with and are influenced\nby, development best practices.\n\nNext, we will focus on the six interlocking areas that make up a design\nsystem; layout, styles, components, regions, content, and usability. You’ll\nlearn how these parts work together to create a robust system. We will help\nyou to understand whether it is the right time to implement a design system\nand, if it is, how to avoid common failures.\n\nGetting support from key stakeholders will be essential. You’ll learn about\nthe three target audiences for your system and how to gain their support. You\nwill have to understand how your peers, your overall organization, and the\nusers of your product benefit from a design system, in order to form the\nnecessary allies for your effort. We will also show you how to use qualitative\nand quantitative data to measure the benefits.\n\nNext, you will learn how to think about design systems as a shared language.\nYou will learn how to create the building blocks and guidelines for your\nlanguage. This can be done by breaking interfaces down into their simplest\nforms, as well as by building elements to create larger interfaces. We will\nshow you how to create design principles that you can use to craft your unique\ndesign language. These principles will address both user needs and\norganizational goals.\n\nImplementing your design system can be one of the most difficult hurdles to\novercome. We will show you how to assess your organization before attempting\nto build your system. You’ll learn why the type of organization you work for\ncan affect your approach. You’ll be given the tools to assess the current\nstate of your product, to help determine the structure that best suits your\norganization’s needs. Case studies help put the unique challenges you are\nfacing into sharper focus.\n\nIterating on your system will be critical to its future success. Your design\nsystem cannot be created and then set aside. You will have to understand how\nto maintain and scale it as your product and organization changes. Measuring\nand tracking results will be vital for your stakeholders. We will show you how\nto maintain momentum through established process, goal setting, and\nevangelizing your system across your organization.\n\nFinally, we provide you with a detailed case study on the development of\nGitLab’s design system. This case study digs deeply into our roles in building\nthe system, the challenges we faced, and the successes we experienced. An\nadditional chapter audits some of the most popular design systems out there\ntoday, giving you insight into the many different methods for structuring your\nsystem. Having real-world experiences and resources to draw from will make\nbuilding your system more straightforward.\n\nStarting your own design system is exciting and daunting. We hope that this\nbook will help make the challenges of building a design system a little less\nintimidating and a lot more exciting. Let’s get started!\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nSarrah and Taurie would like to thank the designers we worked alongside and\nfrom whom we learned so much about building design systems: Pedro Moreira da\nSilva, Dimitrie Hoekstra, Chris Peressini, Matej Latin, Hazel Yang, Jeethu\nKarthik, and Annabel Dunstone (who pulled double duty between design and\nfront-end).\n\nThank you to Simon Knox, Winnie Hellmann, and Clement Ho. Your excitement kept\nour momentum going, and the engineering support was invaluable.\n\nThank you to Bermon Painter. Your insight made this book that much stronger.\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the many industry professionals out there writing\nand speaking about their work on design systems. When we were first starting\nour own design systems, your perspective was indispensable and inspired us to\nshare our personal stories and insights here in this book.\n\n_Sarrah:_ Special thanks to my husband, Daniel Urdzik. Without you there to\nfeed me and make me take breaks, I may have died while writing this book.\nThank you to my sons, Ni and Maxim Vesselov, for vacating the premises until\nthis book was complete. You can come back now.\n\n_Taurie:_ Special thanks to Lucas Charles for being my constant sounding\nboard, reading and editing chapters countless times, making me endless meals,\nand giving your full support throughout this entire process. Thank you to\nMarla Davis for always listening. And last, thanks to Sarrah for sharing this\njourney with me.\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n[Chapter 1:​ The Rise of Design Systems](468954_1_En_1_Chapter.xhtml) 1\n\n[A History of Systems in

The Rise of Design Systems\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nWith the rise of design-led organizations, the role of the designer has\nshifted from that of mere stylist to that of a business’s number-one problem\nsolver. Yet, to build products that people love, designers must do more than\nsolely solve problems. They must structure the way they work, establishing the\nguiding rules and principles that support and drive both their design process\nand the product for which they are designing.\n\nIf you’re reading this book, chances are you don’t have to be convinced of the\nvalue a design system can bring to your organization. You already know it can\nmake your life and work easier. You believe that consistent design will\nimprove the user experience. You are sure that having established guidelines\nand usability patterns will enhance communication between team members and\nsimplify the interface for end users.\n\nWhat you may not be sure of is how to start implementing your design system\nwith the full support of colleagues and upper management. We wrote this book\nto provide you with the tools necessary to successfully communicate the value\na design system can bring to your organization. You will also learn how to\nestablish your own design language, define usability patterns, and create a\ncomprehensive component library.\n\nArticles, books, and talks discussing the importance of design systems are\nrising in popularity (yes, we sense the irony). It may be tempting to write\nthem off as just another design fad that will burn out when the next big thing\ncomes along. However, design systems are not new. Humans have been organizing\nand categorizing the world around them since the beginning of time.\nOrganization gives us a sense of control and order. Order creates feelings of\nsecurity and predictability. For some, this predictability feels limiting,\nsomething counterintuitive to the vision of creativity and expression. When\napplied to the world of technology and application design, however, this\npredictability is freeing, as it removes the need to continuously reinvent the\nsame solutions. By automating and documenting routine tasks, designers have\nmore time for thinking and exploration.\n\nAll design systems start the same: as an attempt at making order out of chaos.\nCategorizing and organizing elements makes them easy to find and replicate. It\nis a necessary utility, born from the tech industry’s need to move fast and\ninnovate even faster. However, design systems are so much more than this. They\ndefine the language we use to create new elements and experiences.\n\n## A History of Systems in Design\n\nLooking back to the Bauhaus and Swiss design movements, you can begin to see\nwhat could be viewed as the foundation for today’s design systems. The Bauhaus\nmovement (1919–33) revolved around the idea that “form follows function.”\nRather than focusing on decorative elements, the primary facet was functional\nsimplicity. The notion that all the parts on a page must have a function led\nto a focus on proportions, grids, and color theory. An example demonstrating\nprinciples from the Bauhaus design movement is shown in Figure 1-1.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg](../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nFigure 1-1\n\nBauhaus-inspired design by Amna Zulfqar\n\nThe Swiss Style, also known as the International Typographic Style,\n(1950s–60s) took grids a step further and shifted the focus to asymmetry and\nclean sans-serif typefaces.1 Figure 1-2 shows an example of the Swiss Style.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg](../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\nFigure 1-2\n\nSwiss Style–inspired design by Amna Zulfqar\n\nYou may be thinking, How does this relate to design systems? What am I\nmissing? These two crucial periods in art history centered on the idea of a\nunified design language, with guidelines for patterns and elements that should\nbe followed. They were a fundamental influence on the evolution of modern\ngraphic design, desktop publishing, and, eventually, web design.\n\n## The Intersection of Art, Technology, and Industry\n\nDesign systems are more than the latest fad; they are a natural evolution in\nthe intersection between art, technology, and industry. Critical factors in\nthis evolution have been:\n\n  * The rise of personal computers and the Web.\n\n  * Technological advancements in Web development (CSS, JavaScript).\n\n  * The influence of technology on business.\n\n  * The shift from waterfall to Agile methodologies.\n\n### The Rise of the Web\n\nThe early days of the Internet were dark for design. Websites were little more\nthan glorified Word documents. In these earlier times, the Web was built using\nonly HTML. CSS did not yet exist, and it was left up to individual browsers to\ndetermine how a webpage would be displayed. An early webpage design lacking\nCSS styling is shown in Figure 1-3.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg](../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\nFigure 1-3\n\nThe Yahoo! home page from 1996 shows an example of an early website lacking\nCSS styling\n\nThis all began to change in the mid-1990s, as more and more people had access\nto personal computers and the Internet. Ultimately, this meant that the Web\ngrew in popularity as the place for electronic publishing. Web authors grew\nincreasingly frustrated by the stylistic limitations of HTML. Browsers,\nrecognizing the opportunity this presented, began exploring ways to give\nauthors more control over their pages.\n\nThe first proposal for CSS was presented in 1994 and spurred a lot of\ndiscussion. Surprisingly, much of the conversation revolved around who should\ncontrol how a page would be viewed. On the one side, many felt that authors\nshould determine the final presentation, ensuring that it matched their\nintention and vision. On the other side, some believed that users should have\nthe ability to decide how they would like to view a page (think in terms of\nthings such as preferred font size). These debates spurred the creation of the\nWorld Wide Web Consortium (W3C), to help work out standards and best practices\nfor the Web, and, ultimately, HTML and CSS. This was an essential development\nin the trajectory of the Internet. Without the W3C to unify and make\nrecommendations, each browser could potentially support a different HTML\nspecification.\n\n### Technological Advancements\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and lots of debate, to 1996, when CSS was\nofficially introduced. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was the first browser to\nsupport the new technology, with Netscape following close behind.2 The\ncompetition was both good and bad. Good, because browsers were now competing\nwith one another to support Web standards. Bad, because it caused significant\npain points for anyone building for the Web. Even as browsers began to support\nstandards, that support was not the same. Each browser implemented CSS in its\nunique way, causing many inconsistencies. The only thing you could count on\nwas the fact that your webpage would not look the same from browser to\nbrowser.\n\n####  Table-Based Design\n\nAs the Web grew, so did the need for better user experience. Graphic designers\nbegan to play with this new medium, applying the fundamentals of layout and\ngrid techniques used in print. Even with the adoption and spread of CSS,\ndesigning on the Web in these early days was painful and limited. Web layouts\nwere being developed using tables, and there was a lack of control when\ncustomizing layouts using HTML and CSS. If you are unfamiliar with tables in\nHTML, it is the same concept as creating a table inside a Word document. Now,\nimagine trying to implement a complicated design interface using only images\ninserted inside table data cells. Some obvious problems arise. Table cells in\nthe same row cannot be different heights, and table cells in the same column\ncannot be different widths. Web designers had to get very creative, using\ncomplicated workarounds of sliced Photoshop images, tables inside of tables,\nand hidden text, among a variety of other hacks.\n\nIn reaction to table-based layouts, Flash emerged as the gateway program for\nmany graphic designers on the Web. The difficulties posed by the limitations\nof table-based design presented an opportunity for programs such as Flash to\nmake web applications easier to design. The Flash interface allowed designers\nto use  graphical user interface (GUI) tools to develop rich interactive\nexperiences. It had a profound influence on the Web, raising the bar for\ndesign and prompting the development of HTML5, which, in the end, led to\nFlash’s eventual demise.\n\n#### The Rise of CSS and JavaScript\n\nBy 2002, the notion of “table-less design” was beginning to gain momentum.\nRather than relying on tables for positioning the elements of a page, CSS had\nadvanced enough to do the job more efficiently. This opened designers up to\nexperimenting with a variety of creative and increasingly complex layouts.\n\nUp until this time, many websites were built page by page. Elements such as\nthe header, footer, and menu were copied and pasted across every page. Change\nsomething on one page, and you would have to go to every other page to make\nthe same change. As the complexity and scale of websites increased,\nperformance, scalability, and maintainability became real concerns.\n\nWe haven’t talked much about JavaScript up to this point. While it has been\naround for 19 years, its acceptance as one of the pillars of Web development\nwas slow in coming. It gained momentum in the mid-2000s and began to be more\nheavily relied on for both client-side and server-side development. JavaScript\nwas used to enhance interactivity, performance, and make sites DRY(er).3 These\nenhancements opened the floodgates for more complicated and interactive design\non the Web.\n\nJavaScript also helped to change the way we approach building websites.\nJavaScript allowed developers to build components rather than entire pages, as\ndemonstrated in Figure 1-4. Components are like Lego bricks that can be moved\naround to reimagine almost any interface. Reimagining pages and even whole\nsites became faster and easier. The pace of development picked up quickly,\nallowing companies to innovate and deliver faster than ever before.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_1_Chapter/468954_1_En_1_Fig4_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 1-4\n\nPage-based design vs. component-based design\n\nThis component-based approach is now being adopted by designers on the Web.\nDesign deliverables have changed from whole-page layouts to pieces of the\nwhole. Doing this has its risks. It is easy to get caught up in the details\nand fail to see the bigger picture. This is where a design system can make all\nthe difference. Defining paradigms makes it easier to keep things consistent\nand manageable. Well-defined paradigms make everything faster, from design to\nimplementation.\n\n### The Influence of Technology on Business\n\nThe Internet grew fast, and the number of people buying computers for personal\nuse rose. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Labor, computer\nownership in the United States rose from 15% to 35% between 1990 and 1997.4\nComputers were no longer a luxury; they were a necessity. Organizations\nimmediately recognized the potential of this new information technology\nmarket. Many companies were founded during what is known as the dot-com boom.\nThis increase in demand for technology caused a flurry of excitement and a\nsense of urgency to build bigger, better websites and software products as\nquickly as possible.\n\n### The Move to Agile\n\nThe traditional waterfall method of software development was built on heavy\nprocess and long lead times. It could take years to get from idea to\ndistribution. Once locked into a concept, organizations using the waterfall\nprocess were unable to easily change course if they found that something\nsimply wouldn’t work. This was because a waterfall process approached product\ndevelopment in a sequential fashion. Requirements would be handed down to\ndesigners, and designs would be handed down to developers, leaving little room\nfor collaboration among teams. Without this collaboration in place, it was\nextremely difficult to shift directions when problems arose later in the\nprocess.\n\nIn 2001, frustrated with the lack of progress, thought leaders gathered to\nfind a more efficient way to develop technology products.5 This was the birth\nof Agile , a fast-delivery approach to building software. It allowed\norganizations to deliver their products quickly, with full knowledge that they\nmay not have gotten it right the first time. They could then gather user\nfeedback and make improvements in rapid succession. Agile focuses on the\npeople building and using the software and not the process or tools it takes\nto make that software.\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nThe rise of component-based architectures and the move to Agile software\ndevelopment has created a need for design systems. With so much of our design\nwork focused on small pieces of the product, it is easy to lose sight of the\nwhole. Design systems provide a necessary overview of the product, its goals,\nand driving vision. It details the language used to build and design, enabling\nyour team to work faster and more confidently. Additionally, design systems\nprovide an iterative snapshot of your interface and are an essential\nwayfinding tool for engineering, product, and design.\n\nIn the next chapter, we will take a closer look at what makes up a design\nsystem and how to decide if and when your organization truly needs one. We\nwill also discuss why and how design systems can fail and what you can do to\nprotect your team from failure.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\nRune Madsen, “A History of Design Systems,”\n[http://​printingcode.​runemadsen.​com/​lecture-\nintro/​](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/lecture-intro/).\n\n2\n\nBert Bos, “A Brief History of CSS Until 2016,”\n[https://​www.​w3.​org/​Style/​CSS20/​history.​html](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html),\nDecember 17, 2016.\n\n3\n\nDRY stands for “Don’t Repeat Yourself” and is a term used in software\nengineering.

Introducing Design Systems\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nUnderstanding the goal of a design system is the first step toward\nimplementing a solution that helps teams successfully scale product. With a\nclearly defined system, designers and engineers can focus their efforts on\nsolving user needs, rather than re-creating elements and reinventing\nsolutions.\n\nThroughout this book, we’ll discuss six interlocking areas that make up a\ndesign system.\n\n  * **Layout** : Defined measures that make up your spacing and grid system.\n\n  * **Styles** : Core aspects of your visual language. These include colors, iconography, and typography.\n\n  * **Components** : Core elements of an interface. These include buttons and form fields.\n\n  * **Regions** : Overarching design paradigms, such as navigation or search.\n\n  * **Content** : Information regarding the voice and tone, as well as punctuation guidelines. Content can also include terminology if your product has a specific vocabulary.\n\n  * **Usability** : Rules that define accessibility and internationalization.\n\nThese parts work together, building off one another. For example, components\nare created with a combination of both layout and style, while regions are\ncomposed of multiple components, as shown in Figures 2-1 through 2-3. Content\ninforms the copy used within your components, while usability keeps the\ncontent accessible. The size and scope of these areas can vary, depending on\nthe organization, but all should be considered.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_2_Chapter/468954_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_2_Chapter/468954_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 2-1\n\nSpacing (layout), combined with color and typography (styles), create\ncomponents\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_2_Chapter/468954_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_2_Chapter/468954_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 2-2\n\nComponents can be combined to form component groups. In this example, combined\nbuttons create a segmented control. Another example includes combining an\ninput field with a button to create a form.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_2_Chapter/468954_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_2_Chapter/468954_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 2-3\n\nMultiple components can create larger paradigms used throughout your product,\nsuch as navigation. It is helpful to document guidelines related to these\nspecific regions.\n\nThroughout this book, we will use the following terms when referencing\ndifferent aspects within your system:\n\n  * **Elements** : The lowest-level object. Elements cannot be broken down further. This can include labels and icons.\n\n  * **Components** : A combination of one or more elements that function as a whole, such as a form.\n\n  * **Component groups** : A group of components that form a larger component, as seen in Figure 2-2.\n\n## Style Guides, Component Libraries, and Design Systems\n\nAs design tools become more sophisticated, style guides and component\nlibraries continue to grow in popularity. This popularity is for a good\nreason, as they allow designers to create core elements that can be shared and\nsynced across multiple design files. By making a change in one file, you can\neasily update the design across all files that use that same element. This\nallows designers to easily make global changes and achieve consistency within\ntheir design tool.\n\nA common misconception is that style guides, component libraries, and design\nsystems are all the same. This confusion occurs because often, they contain\nmany of the same parts. A primary difference is that a design system houses\nthe processes and philosophies behind your design decisions. Your design\nsystem is a documented approach to systematic design. Style guides and\ncomponent libraries are assets to help get you there. In addition, the core of\na design system is tied to the codebase of your application, whereas style\nguides and component libraries are often static. With design systems,\ncomponents are built, implemented, and documented with the help of front-end\nengineers. This is an important distinction that ultimately helps your team\ndevelop a series of components that can easily be referenced, used, and\nupdated directly within your codebase. Design systems let teams move faster by\nreducing the layers of translation between design and implementation.\n\n  * **Style guide** : Static documentation that defines how the brand is stylistically applied to interface elements. It contains high-level details about color, typography, iconography, and more.\n\n  * **Component library** : A set of styles and components that can be used and shared among a team. A component library consists of common core elements that are used throughout an application. If supported by a design tool, they can automatically sync across design files when a change is made. Component libraries may or may not include living code.\n\n  * **Design system** : A series of documented elements, components, and regions that include both design and front-end guidelines. The documentation contains live code examples, allowing cross-functional teams to easily reuse styles and components in several instances across an application. A design system also includes underlying design principles, rules, and guidelines that help a team build one or multiple products.\n\n### Our experience\n\nThe terms _components_ and _patterns_ are often used interchangeably. For\nexample, a component library is often also called a pattern library.\n\nTerminology is important, but don’t get too caught up on exact phrases. Define\nterms based on what works for your organization and be consistent in how you\nuse them within your team.\n\n## The Right Time to Implement a Design System\n\nThere are a few factors to take into consideration when deciding if it is the\nright time to implement a design system. You’ll want to consider the\nfollowing:\n\n  * Age of the organization.\n\n  * Team size.\n\n  * Volume and type of work.\n\n### Age of the Organization\n\nIn the beginning, many organizations invest more time and effort into growing\nproducts and features than they do in developing good user interfaces. It is\neasy to point fingers, but the climate for technology and the speed at which\ncompanies must move to become profitable can make even the smartest\norganization choose features over experience.\n\nPutting a design system in place takes a great deal of time and effort.\nAccording to a 2018 design systems survey conducted by Figma, design systems\ntypically come after the product is built.1 Creating patterns and strict\nguidelines are often unnecessary during the early stages of a startup or in a\nyoung organization. Attempting to lock the team into a set of strict\nguidelines while everything is still in flux will result in wasted time, as\nthe organization pivots to meet market demands.\n\nThat isn’t to say you can’t begin to lay the foundations for a design system.\nThis is the time to loosely organize patterns and guidelines. Establish a\nsingle source of truth for the basics, such as typography, colors, and\nspacing, but avoid creating too much overhead and process. Until things are\nmore stable, it will be important to remain flexible.\n\n### Team Size\n\nIf there are only a few designers and engineers on your team, it may be too\nearly to start thinking about a design system. Keep in mind the resources that\nyou have. A small team might mean you are strapped for time. Being unable to\nspend sufficient time to start your system could result in failure. If you\nanticipate that the team will be growing soon, now is the time to think about\nhow you will handle that growth. Keeping things organized and preparing only\nthe essential documentation should suffice. Once the team grows to five or\nmore members, it is likely time to think about a more sophisticated system.\n\nIt is equally important to think about other teams you interact with. Will a\ndesign system improve communication and collaboration with product,\ndevelopment, and even marketing? If the answer is yes, then it is time!\n\n### Volume and Type of Work\n\nAt first glance, agency work may seem too varied and fast-paced to benefit\nfrom a design system. The work is continually changing and can vary\nsignificantly from day to day. Designers must often context switch between\ndifferent sets of branding guidelines and user bases. Compared to that of a\nproduct team, the work does not have a regular cadence of iteration, and\ndesigners don’t typically have the opportunity to grow the user experience\nsteadily over time. However, a design system can be used as a starting point\nfor creating brand-consistent user experiences at agency speed. Many agencies\ncan use a generic set of layout rules, components, and regions that can be\neasily adapted to each brand’s unique look and feel. In some cases, agencies\nwill even build unique design systems for their clients.\n\n## Approaching the Start of Your Design System\n\nIn the beginning, implementing a design system can feel overwhelming.\nUnderstanding the current state of your product is always a good first step\ntoward incrementally building your design system.\n\nWhether your organization is young or mature, starting with an interface\ninventory will provide insight into where you are in the process of creating\nyour system. The goal of your inventory is to assess the layout, styles, and\ncomponents used throughout your product. It can also serve as a road map when\ndefining the scope of your design system.\n\nA component library can be used as a first step toward incrementally\nimplementing your design system. You and your design team can work from the\ninterface inventory to create a series of components that are then used to\ncommunicate with your front-end engineering team during implementation.\n\nA design system is distinct for every organization. To begin planning, ask\nyourself fundamental questions to understand the needs and goals of your\norganization and users. Some of these questions may include:\n\n  * What details prevent our team from quickly and efficiently creating designs?\n\n  * How does our visual language complement brand guidelines?\n\n  * Which components are most frequently used?\n\n  * Which interactions are critical to core business needs?\n\n  * Does our organization support internationalization?\n\n  * Who is our user base and how can we enable them to use the product effectively?\n\n  * What tone do we use to communicate with users?\n\nQuestions such as these map long-term goals to the six interlocking areas that\nmake up a design system. Asking the right questions also helps break down the\nneeds of your organization into small, digestible pieces, making it easier to\nget started and stay motivated.\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn more about implementation techniques, see Chapter\n[5](468954_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n## Understanding Why Design Systems Fail\n\nDesign systems are not foolproof. They can fail for many reasons.\nUnderstanding how and why things can go wrong will help you stay on track.\n\n### Lack of Initial Buy-In\n\nAttempting to build anything without the support of your organization will be\na struggle. Building a design system requires resources and time. You can’t do\nit all on your own. Before making any decisions or taking any steps, take the\ntime to talk to others in your organization. Start by getting a feel for what\nthey already may know about design systems. Approach conversations from the\nperspective of problem-solving: What pain points do they encounter that a\ndesign system would help relieve? What goals and initiatives are important to\nthem, and how can a design system further those goals?\n\nMake sure to reach out to colleagues at every level of the organization:\nproduct management, engineering, sales, marketing, and executive leadership.\nIt is essential that everyone understands the specific benefits a design\nsystem will provide them. You must evangelize and then socialize your design\nsystem; otherwise, you run the risk of others seeing it as a design-only\ninitiative and losing support for the time and resources needed.\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn more about getting support for your design system, see Chapter\n[3](468954_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### Trying to Do Too Much, Too Soon\n\nGetting started on your design system is exciting, but don’t let that\nexcitement get the better of you and your team. It can be tempting to jump\nright into working on your system. It is vital to understand your company’s\nunique needs and challenges before devoting all your time and resources to\nbuilding something.\n\nPace yourself and your team, or you run the risk of burning out. Understand\nwhat you really need before committing, and accept the fact that progress may\nnot always be as fast as you would like. Doing a lot and then nothing can make\nboth stakeholders and your team lose faith in your system.\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn more about framing your design system, see Chapter\n[3](468954_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### Perfectionism\n\nDon’t try to make your system perfect by worrying over every little detail.\nIteration will be vital to getting your design system up and running. As you\nwork, you will discover patterns you forgot or details that seem vital. Keep a\nrunning list of improvements and additions. Avoid the impulse to switch gears\nto get them in your system immediately. Approach building your design system\nas you would any other project. Plan, execute, and iterate as new information\nor needs arise. Most of all, get comfortable with the idea that it will never\nbe “done.”\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn how to implement your system iteratively, see Chapter\n[5](468954_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### Maintenance\n\nIt is common to feel the pressure to deliver quickly, both for your team and\nexternal stakeholders. Don’t give in to this pressure. Think strategically\nwhen developing your design system. Avoid getting stuck with a system that\nrequires constant upkeep. Such things as static images and repeated text will\nnot scale as your system grows and becomes more complicated. Self-\ndocumentation is essential if you want to ensure the system remains relevant.\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn more about building a maintainable design system, see Chapters\n[5](468954_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml) and [6](468954_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### Design System Envy\n\nGetting inspiration from other design systems can be extremely helpful. You\ncan see how other companies have grouped their content, which components are\nvital to include, as well as how much and what information is necessary to\ndocument. However, it is hard not to compare your progress to more prominent\norganizations, and that can be demotivating. You may have only a few people in\nyour organization available to work on your system part-time. Remember that\nmany of the well-established design systems you see have been developed over a\nperiod of years by full-time, devoted teams. Be happy with your progress and\nconcentrate on the needs of your organization.\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn how to use other design systems to your advantage, see Chapter\n[8](468954_1_En_8_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nSix interlocking areas make up a design system: layout, styles, components,\nregions, content, and usability. A robust design system should contain guiding\ndesign principles, guidelines for use and implementation, as well as a\ncomponent library that includes front-end code.\n\nBefore you build anything, determine whether it is the right time to implement\na design system. Avoid investing a lot of time creating a design system before\nyour team and organization are ready for it. You may have to start gradually,\nbeginning with a style guide and basic UI kit. As your team and organization\ngrow, so will the need for a design system.\n\nWhen you are ready, start with an interface inventory of your product.\nDocument the layouts, styles, and components that make up your unique\ninterface. Then, ask some fundamental questions to understand the needs and\ngoals of your organization and its user base. Answers to these questions will\nallow you to map out the long-term goals of your system.\n\nFinally, knowing why design systems fail is as essential as knowing what makes\nthem successful. Avoid the common traps, such as perfectionism, taking on too\nmuch, and starting a system without proper buy-in from stakeholders.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\nFigma, “State of Design Systems 2018,” [https://​www.​figma.​com/​blog/​state-\nof-design-systems-2018/​](https://www.figma.com/blog/state-of-design-\nsystems-2018/), December 19, 2018.\n\n\n© Sarrah Vesselov and Taurie Davis 2019\n\nSarrah Vesselov and  Taurie Davis Building Design Systems\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-4514-9_3>\n\n# 3\\. Selling the System\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nOften, it can be difficult to articulate to others something that you know\nintuitively. As designers, it is our job not only to create better user\nexperiences but also to explain why they are better, in the simplest terms\npossible. More often than not, we are not the decision makers within an\norganization. To see our ideas come to pass, we have to advocate for them to\nthe decision makers. We can’t just be convinced of the value of our ideas; we\nhave to show that value to others.\n\nDesign systems feel intuitive to designers. Perhaps this is a byproduct of\nbeing problem solvers. We naturally seek out problems and ways to solve them.\nDesign systems feel like a natural solution to the many obstacles that come\nfrom working on projects at scale.\n\nWhether formally or not, we have all designed systems with the intent of\nmaking our jobs or lives more comfortable and enjoyable. Tapping into this\nidea is the first step in communicating the value a design system can bring to\nan organization.\n\n## Defining Why Design Systems Are Beneficial\n\nEvery organization is unique, both in its offerings and its challenges.\nCommunicating the value and benefit a design system can bring in a relatable\nway is critical. Approach it as you would a product problem. The first step is\nto understand the organization, its goals, and challenges, as well as\nindividual roles and the parts they play.\n\nWhat are the goals of the organization? How can you align user experience\ngoals with those of the broader organization? Who will benefit most from a\nwell-defined system? These are all essential questions to answer.\n\n### Three Dimensions of Value\n\nTo begin answering these questions, let’s examine the value of a design system\nin light of who will benefit and how. Generally, you can break it down into\nthree target audiences: the employees of the organization, the users of the\nproduct, and the organization itself.\n\n#### Selling Value at the Employee Level\n\nWe will start with the benefits to employees first, because, let’s face it,\nmaking employees’ lives comfortable and enjoyable has benefits for all three\ntarget audiences. We surveyed 82 people with questions relating to their\nskills, personal and professional goals, as well as what frustrates them most\nin their work. We used this data to build simple personas that will help you\nto understand how each role benefits from a design system.\n\n##### Designers\n\nThe majority of designers (Table 3-1) we spoke with placed problem solving and\nelevating the perception of design at the top of their priorities list. Many\nof them felt frustrated and held back by vague requirements, too many\nmeetings, and the pressure to deliver solutions quickly without proper\ndiscovery. Design systems can help alleviate these frustrations while enabling\ndesigners to move faster and be more productive.\n\nTable 3-1\n\nDesigner Persona\n\n**A.K.A.** | • UX designer• UX engineer• Interactive designer• Product designer• Multimedia designer  \n---|---  \n**How I see what I do** | • I make sure we are solving the right problems. I use data to understand user needs and motivations as a way of delivering the best experience possible.  \n**My core skills** | • Design• Research• Communication• Collaboration• Problem solving• T-shaped skills: broad knowledge of design concepts with deep knowledge of certain disciplines (e.g., interactive design, research, visual design)  \n**My personal goals** | • Continue to learn and push the quality of my design solutions• Work on design solutions that have a positive impact on people• Keep up with design trends and technologies to remain relevant in the industry  \n**My professional goals** | • Help others see the value and effectiveness of good design• Solve user problems• Create solutions that make a difference in people’s lives• Bring together user experience and visual appeal  \n**I spend most of my time on** | • Meetings• Design discussion/discovery• Documentation• Defending/advocating for my design solutions• Communicating with other teams to better understand the problem  \n**Things that frustrate me** | • Meetings• Out-of-date documentation• Lack of understanding or support for the value of design• Vague requirements• Lack of support/trust from product owners• Pressure to deliver quickly without proper research or discovery  \n  \nAn established system gives the design team access to styles, shared\ncomponents, and implementation guidelines. This single source of truth helps\nthe team to work independently of one another while ensuring consistency.\nShared design documents allow designers to quickly and accurately put together\nhigh-fidelity designs.\n\nDesign systems also give designers the opportunity to step outside of their\ntraditional toolset and create prototypes in the browser. Doing so enables\nthem to see what will be in production instead of the “ideal world” within a\ndesign tool. Some design systems make components available in the browser,\nallowing designers to quickly and easily change attributes and behaviors\nwithout knowing how to code. Other systems require the use of Git and running\nthe project locally to create prototypes. Designers can quickly learn how to\ndo this on their own or work in tandem with an engineer. Many designers are\ngetting comfortable with component wrapping and styling, learning how to\nhandle these changes without the aid of engineers. A design system brings\ndesigners closer to the final product earlier in the process, allowing them to\ntest solutions and iterate faster.\n\nDesign systems can make space for innovation and creativity. How can devoting\ntime and energy to a design system make a design team more innovative and\ncreative? It may seem counterintuitive, but, in the end, a well-thought-out\ndesign system buys the team time. Designers will have time to dedicate to\nexploration and idea generation rather than to solving the same set of user-\nexperience problems over and over again. The design team is now in a position\nto do more user research, explore user journeys, and investigate ways to make\nthe existing experience more intuitive and competitive. The organization, its\nuser base, and the design team all benefit from this ability to dig more\ndeeply into the product.\n\nIt will be important to emphasize this, as there will be a trade-off in the\nbeginning. It could potentially take a significant amount of time to establish\nthe design system. Stressing that this is temporary and that the team stands\nto gain that time back plus some can help soothe these concerns.\n\n##### Engineers\n\nThe engineers (Table 3-2) we spoke with gave surprisingly similar answers as\nthe designers. Too many meetings, inadequate requirements, and missing design\nassets were among their chief complaints. As with designers, there was a\npersonal need to engage in fulfilling work that utilized their creativity to\nsolve everyday problems. The benefits design systems bring to engineers are\nclear. They clarify solutions, make assets readily available, and give\nengineers the tools to create autonomously.\n\nTable 3-2\n\n_Engineer Persona_\n\n**A.K.A.** | • Support engineer• Front-end engineer• Web developer• Software engineer• QA• Back-end engineer  \n---|---  \n**How I see what I do** | • I listen to problems and solve them.

I create, support, and expand upon solutions.  \n**My core skills** | • Development• Communication• Collaboration• Problem solving• T-shaped skills: broad knowledge of programming and development with deep knowledge of particular languages or problem spaces (e.g., infrastructure, databases, etc.)  \n**My personal goals** | • Keep up with ever-changing tech processes and requirements, to remain relevant in the industry• Encourage mutual interest and respect between collaborating roles• Deliver useful things• Use programming as a creative outlet and get paid for it  \n**My professional goals** | • Minimize customizations while meeting user and business needs• Minimize risk and technical debt• Build scalable, maintainable code  \n**I spend most of my time on** | • Communicating with product managers, project managers, designers, and clients• Clarifying requirements• Meetings• Setting up dev environments• Learning something new for a project I am working on  \n**Things that frustrate me** | • Meetings• Maintaining documentation• Complicated dev environments• Lack of transparency across departments/teams• Bad requirements and lack of discovery• Missing assets  \n  \nThe design-to-developer handoff is an additional source of frustration for\nmany. Designers often have to create detailed specs, such as redlined\ndesigns1, for every design handed off to a developer. Done manually, this is a\ntime-consuming process. With an established system, design specs remain\nconsistent and can be automatically documented and generated. Developers can\nuse these guidelines as a reference during the implementation phase, cutting\ndown on the need for a back and forth with designers. With detailed\ndocumentation, developers will be able to copy the code for the component they\nrequire and move on.\n\n#####  Product\n\nProduct managers (Table 3-3) set the product vision and strategy. This vision\noccurs on two distinct levels: the macro and the micro. At the macro-level,\nthe focus is on the whole application. This includes flows, features, and\noverall stability. At the micro-level, the focus shifts to small-scale\ninteractions. Maintaining a holistic (macro) view of an application while\nfocusing on the details (micro) can be a challenge for anyone. Design systems\nhelp reduce the cognitive load spent on micro-level interactions, allowing\nproduct managers to focus on the larger picture.\n\nTable 3-3\n\n_Product Persona_\n\n**A.K.A.** | • Product owner• Product manager  \n---|---  \n**How I see what I do** | • I work with executive leadership, designers, engineers, and our user base to determine the features that will fulfill the vision and needs of the product. I solve everyday problems.  \n**My core skills** | • Communication• Collaboration• Research• Problem solving• T-shaped skills: broad knowledge of design, engineering, and business concepts with deep knowledge of their particular industry and user base  \n**My personal goals** | • Continually learn about new technologies• Improve my ability to see the bigger picture and direction• Improve my ability to communicate and gain buy-in from key players  \n**My professional goals** | • Solve customer problems while propelling the needs and goals of the business• Understand my users better than anyone else• Understand all the players (design, engineering, sales, executives, etc.) better than anyone else• Understand my industry better than anyone else  \n**I spend most of my time on** | • Product discussion/discovery• Reviewing data• Meeting with customers• Communicating with other teams to keep features and improvements coming  \n**Things that frustrate me** | • Lack of understanding or support for valuable features• Inability to work directly on features or problems (i.e., contribute code or design)  \n  \nIt isn’t uncommon for product managers and developers to outnumber UX\ndesigners at an organization. This situation can sometimes cause tension and,\npotentially, trust issues, as UX becomes a “blocker” for improvements. As an\nexample, imagine that a product manager has an idea for a feature but the UX\nteam has other priorities. Instead of waiting, the product manager pushes\nahead with an MVC (minimal viable content) that contradicts existing patterns.\nThe instinct from UX can be to put their foot down and say, “everything must\ncome through us.”\n\nWell-documented usability patterns and usage guidelines make it easy for\nproduct managers to make educated decisions without the burden of UX\noversight. A design system does the heavy lifting by making common usability\npatterns, usage guidelines, and defined styles available at any time. The\nability to cross-reference the details of an interface or interaction with\nthose generally used across the application can save hours of time for UX and\nproduct managers.\n\n#####  Sales\n\nThe bar for application design is high. Potential users want to know that what\nthey are buying has the features they need and that they won’t get frustrated\nusing it. The sales department (Table 3-4) often reaches out to product and\nengineering teams to get answers to questions that can determine whether a\ndeal will go through. A design system provides greater visibility into the\nproduct, giving sales teams insight into the organization's unique direction.\n\nTable 3-4\n\n_Sales Persona_\n\n**A.K.A.** | • Sales account manager• Sales representative• Solutions architect• Sales admin• Account manager  \n---|---  \n**How I see what I do** | • I build relationships with people. I make their lives easier by understanding their needs and communicating that back to the organization.  \n**My core skills** | • Communication• Good listening skills• Product knowledge• Prospecting  \n**My personal goals** | • Deliver what customers really want and need• Money is not the most important thing, but it is a motivator for me and my work.• To be liked, respected, and recognized by my peers  \n**My professional goals** | • Solve customer problems while propelling the needs and goals of the business• Dedicate myself to ensuring my client’s success• Make and exceed my sales quotas on a regular basis• Achieve revenue targets  \n**I spend most of my time on** | • Client calls and meetings• Logistics for meetings• Demos• Communicating with marketing and product about ways to increase sales and make the product more valuable to the customer  \n**Things that frustrate me** | • Waiting to get answers to customer questions from product or engineering• Lack of urgency internally and externally• Not having enough time to research and learn  \n  \n#####  Marketing\n\nAs in the case of sales, the marketing department (Table 3-5) is focused on\nhow to best frame the product, its offerings, and its competitive advantages.\nThrough a design system, marketing can become more aligned with its product\ncounterparts. This ultimately helps shape a cohesive design language used\nthroughout the organization.\n\nTable 3-5\n\n_Marketing Persona_\n\n**A.K.A** | • Content marketing associate• Marketing director• Marketing executive• Social media strategist• Brand manager  \n---|---  \n**How I see what I do** | • I work for the organization and the customer. I create a sense of excitement and shape brands through engaging content and targeted campaigns.  \n**My core skills** | • Communication• Good listening skills• Good writing skills• Product knowledge• Market and industry knowledge  \n**My personal goals** | • Maintain a sense of creativity and inspiration in my work• Keep up with the constantly changing landscape of Internet marketing  \n**My professional goals** | • Increase market share• Attract and retain customers• Achieve marketing goals• Build a consistent and compelling brand experience  \n**I spend most of my time on** | • Logistics for campaigns, events, and projects• Market and industry research• Measuring results• Communicating results with the executive team• Understanding the product vision to better represent the brand  \n**Things that frustrate me** | • Lack of urgency internally and externally• When an organization does not follow through on its commitments• Constantly changing targets• Inability to accurately measure results• Impossible deadlines• Not having enough time to research and learn  \n  \nIn our survey, the sales and marketing groups shared similar goals and\nfrustrations. Both voiced frustration with the lack of opportunity to learn\nmore about the product itself. A design system can be used for onboarding, as\nit defines common terminology, concepts, and patterns unique to the product.\nSales and marketing can utilize the system to learn about and familiarize\nthemselves with the product and organizational language.\n\nBoth groups also pointed to a lack of urgency from others as a blocker. It\nisn’t uncommon for sales prospects to question the future of specific features\nor request enhancements before committing to the purchase. A design system can\nbe used to quickly answer these concerns and demonstrate to potential buyers\nthe future vision and direction for the product. It showcases the\norganization’s commitment to continually improving the user experience.\n\n##### Shared Vision and Language\n\nA good starting point is to emphasize design systems as a language. Each\nlanguage is unique to the organization and the product. Documenting this\nlanguage and establishing a clear vision decreases the likelihood of\nmiscommunication and makes it easier for employees across the organization to\ncontribute to better user experiences. The design, product, development,\nsales, and marketing teams all stand to benefit.\n\nMaking this language accessible to all employees increases consistency and\nempowers all teams to be part of improving the user experience. There is no\nneed for other teams to overstep boundaries or inadvertently work against UX\nif the design language is available to all.\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn more about crafting your language, see Chapter\n[4](468954_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n##### Quick Onboarding for All New Team Members\n\nWhether you are starting on the UX team, joining the engineering department,\nor beginning in marketing, a design system can be an excellent jumping-off\npoint. It maintains an overview of the application design and terminologies\nused, while also providing an easy way for anyone to understand the\norganization’s unique language. For those starting in design or development,\nreadily available components allow you to jump in on day one and contribute.\n\n#### Selling Value at the Organizational Level\n\nIn the beginning, many organizations invest more time and effort into growing\nfeatures than they do into developing good user interfaces. As designers, it\ncan be frustrating to have a seat at the table but feel no power while in that\nseat. Pressure to push out results can make you feel as though you are a\nconsultant rather than a partner—a checkbox in a process rather than a driver.\n\nMany of the most successful companies are design-driven or have a deep\nappreciation for the value good design can bring. A study published by\nMcKinsey & Company2 in 2018 found a strong correlation between how capable a\ncompany is at design and how well it performs financially. Apple, Airbnb,\nSlack, and IBM come to mind quickly. These companies have invested time and\nresources into design, with design leadership existing in the C-suite.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a common occurrence. For many of us, design and its\nconcerns in the organization linger in the middle management layer. We have to\nconsistently advocate for design by speaking a shared language.\n\n##### Speaking in terms of ROI\n\nHow can design teams in organizations without executive design leadership\neffectively make a case for a design system? Work on describing the benefits\nof a design system in quantifiable terms when selling the idea at the\nexecutive level. Many organizations will say that they value user experience,\nbut when it comes down to it, things like the performance and stability of the\nproduct are regarded separately and as a higher priority than user experience.\nUptime and availability are readily obtainable measurements. It is easy to\nquantify the return on investment (ROI) for achieving 100% uptime. It can be\nmore challenging to measure user satisfaction accurately.\n\nMerely saying that a design system will increase consistency or improve user\nexperience is not something most business executives, or even product\nmanagers, will see as a tangible benefit. You need to speak their language and\ndescribe the benefits in terms of ROI, as follows:\n\n  * What does the organization stand to gain from the time and money being spent?\n\n  * How will a design system increase revenue, customer retention, and productivity?\n\nLet’s look at an example. Imagine that your organization has developed an\nambitious road map for next year. The number of features planned would require\nthe whole team full-time, leaving no room for improving the existing feature\nset. You know that having a design system would help automate a significant\nportion of the effort. This automation would allow for the exploration and\ndesigning of new features as well as improving existing ones.\n\n  * Select just one of the features and estimate the number of hours it will take to explore, design, and build from scratch.\n\n  * Now, estimate the time it would take if you had the following:\n\n    * Components (design and code, readily available for product, engineering, and UX)\n\n    * Consistent guidelines and standards, including specs (faster reviews for quality and assurance)\n\n  * Measure the difference and multiply this number by the total number of features proposed. Some features will be larger, and some will be smaller. Don’t worry about that. We are looking for a rough estimate here. Got it? Good!\n\n  * Now, multiply the total number of hours by the average designer’s hourly rate.\n\nThe result is an estimate of how much time a design system will save and how\nmuch money that time is worth to the organization.\n\nThere are many ways to show the value of your design system. Finding ways to\ntie this value into revenue and profit will make a more compelling case. Using\nthe worksheet provided later in this chapter, review your organization’s\ngoals. If a particular feature or feature set represents the anchor for sales\nand marketing efforts, improving the user experience of this feature is likely\nto increase retention and revenue. Mapping UX goals to the organizational\ngoals in this way can make it easier to demonstrate the return for investing\ntime and money into a design system.\n\n##### Get a Baseline from Employees and Users\n\nIt isn’t enough to say that something will have an impact. You should have a\nplan for measuring the results to demonstrate positive effects. Use both\nquantitative and qualitative methods of measurement when evaluating the\neffectiveness of your improvements. To do this, you will have to gather\nbaseline data early, so be prepared to factor this into your plan.\n\n  * Establish the current level of satisfaction that users have, through surveys and usability testing. Use a System Usability Scale (SUS)3 template to measure the usability of your product.\n\n  * Remember: The goals are to highlight the benefits across all user groups. This includes measuring user satisfaction across multiple areas of the product, as well as employee satisfaction with the current system.\n\n### Note\n\nFor additional information on gathering baseline data, see Chapter\n[6](468954_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n##### Maintain and Update Data\n\nContinue to do research throughout the process of implementing the design\nsystem. As the system becomes more robust and covers more areas of the\nproduct, the overall ROI should improve. The goal is to show that employees\nare more productive and happier with their work and that users are more\nproductive and more satisfied with the product. If your results do not bear\nthis out, this is your opportunity to reevaluate and take corrective action\nearly on. Remember to:\n\n  * Have a plan for continued measurement and evaluation.\n\n  * Compare baseline data from your initial testing with subsequent testing.\n\n  * Keep track of corrective actions, to ensure they have the desired effect.\n\n##### Cost and Agility\n\nThe need to get to market before the competition has dramatically changed\nsoftware development. In today’s agile environment, we no longer have the\nluxury of lengthy discovery and exploration. There is great emphasis placed on\nspeed and cost-effectiveness, so much so that we are often working on\ndiscovery, design, and implementation all at once.\n\nThere are many ways to cut costs within an organization. It isn’t uncommon for\ndesign departments to be the first to feel the pinch when organizations have\nto cut back. But what _appears_ to provide savings could end up costing the\norganization a lot more in the long run. Robert Pressman illustrates this\npoint beautifully in his book _Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s\nApproach_ : “For every dollar spent to resolve a problem during product\ndesign, $10 would be spent on the same problem during development, and\nmultiply to $100 or more if the problem had to be solved after the product’s\nrelease.”4\n\nDesign systems present an opportunity to reduce costs without resorting to\nlayoffs or slashing benefits. Established patterns and guidelines have already\nbeen thought out, tested, and used in other areas of the application.\nLeveraging these patterns will reduce the cycle time from design to\nimplementation and be more likely to provide a superior user experience the\nfirst time.\n\n### Our experience\n\nIdentifying key features or areas of the application that will be improved is\none way to quantifiably present value. Pairing work on the design system with\norganizational goals masks the time involved. You are still putting in the\ntime and effort, but in a way that appears more productive to the rest of the\ncompany. Optics are important.\n\n#### Selling Value at the User Level\n\nDon’t forget the primary beneficiary of a well-thought-out design system: the\nend user. Delighting users is what will often determine the success of a\nproduct. The overall usability of a product, coupled with the benefits it\noffers a user, is critical.\n\nAll of the benefits listed in our other sections trickle down to benefit the\nuser:\n\n  * Happy and more productive employees have more time to work on complex flows and user experience solutions.\n\n  * Reduced cycle time allows improved experiences to make it into the product faster, increasing feedback and further iteration.\n\n  * Sales and marketing can appropriately address buyer concerns and questions before users are locked in.\n\n## Communication Strategies\n\nCommunication is all about balance—a balance between talking and listening,\neducating and learning. There are many methods and channels you can use to\ncommunicate with your team, colleagues, and bosses about your design system.\nThe methods include diplomacy, education, salesmanship, and good public\nrelations (PR). The channels include, but are not limited to, organizational\nannouncements, one-on-one conversations, and updates to guidelines and\nhandbooks. Balancing these methods and channels will give you the greatest\nlikelihood of success.\n\n### Diplomacy\n\nEngage with other teams and key players within the company. Most important\nwill be members of product and front-end engineering, as they will be the\nfirst to reap the rewards of the system. They may also be your staunchest\nallies.\n\nDiplomacy is not about politicking or quid pro quos. Diplomacy is about\nunderstanding and defining the expectations of both you and your colleagues.\nBuild trust and be flexible. Listen to their needs and make a concerted effort\nto find the balance between your needs and theirs. Not only will it help\nensure support from other departments, it will also help to better inform and\nshape your design system.\n\nAs a part of diplomacy, you’ll have to educate those around you about what it\nis you are proposing. Don’t assume what others know, or don’t know, about\ndesign systems. Practice empathic listening when speaking about your design\nsystem. Don’t expect that they have understood what you have said. Try to put\nyourself in their place and listen from their point of view. Look at their\nbody language and pay attention to the questions they ask. No matter how well\nyou think you are messaging your intentions, they may not be understood.\n\nUse multiple channels to get your message across and get feedback on what\nothers understand from these communications. Use one-on-ones, team meetings,\nand organizational announcements to advocate how your design system will\nbenefit the organization and its employees.\n\n### Education\n\nThere are many misconceptions surrounding design systems. Ensuring that you,\nyour team, and the remainder of your organization have a shared understanding\nof what a design system is will be crucial to its success.\n\nThe most common misconception is that style guides and design systems are the\nsame thing. Design systems and style guides do have similar goals, both serve\nto create a unified and consistent style across an application. However, style\nguides are just one piece of a whole. They don’t represent a design system in\nand of itself. A fully realized design system is a language shared amongst an\norganization. It is composed of the design concepts, terminologies, and the\noverall approach the organization takes in communicating ideas.\n\nThis concept can be challenging to get across, especially for those outside of\nthe design department in an organization. It may be helpful to explain that a\ndesign system is a set of connected parts and principles. It will contain the\nvoice and vision for design at the organization. This could roughly be\ncompared to an organization’s mission statement. It will provide the\nterminology and definitions for UI elements used throughout the product, as\nwell as make available common usability patterns. Once there is a basic\nunderstanding of what a design system is, it is easier to communicate the\nbenefits and value it will bring.\n\n### Salesmanship: Preparing for the “No”\n\nPreparing yourself for the objections and reservations of others will help you\naddress their concerns and, hopefully, win them over. Be positive, but\nrealistic, about the reactions you are likely to receive.\n\nThe following are a few reasons why stakeholders will say “no”:\n\n  * **We don’t have enough resources to devote to this effort**. Create a survey to show just how much time employees are spending on fixing UI bugs or how much time developers are spending asking designers to review basic UX paradigms. Show them the wasted resources and explain that the design system will begin to shift these resources to more productive areas.\n\n  * **We can’t stop shipping features to organize. It will never be finished**. Recognize that they are right, and it will never be complete, but that’s okay! Improving the user experience should never be finished. You should always be striving for the best product that solves user needs in the most efficient way. Acknowledge the truth of their statement and explain how you can start by building the documentation for areas you are working on now. There is no need to stop the work being done on current features. Simply ensure that, moving forward, all documentation will be done as features are developed.\n\n  * **We don’t see the value. How does this help our product and UX**? Design systems focus effort on improving the overall product rather than keeping the focus on redesigning the same features over and over again. Driving efforts toward achieving organizational objectives will, in the end, translate to user experience improvements for the end user. It will align teams using a common language and make design, product, engineering, marketing, and sales all more productive and united. People are more readily able to make autonomous decisions, which means the organization moves faster as a whole.\n\n### Good Public Relations!\n\nAs you may have already experienced , implementing a design system requires\npositive PR within your organization. The good news is that design systems\nhave the potential to be PR in and of themselves. Airbnb and Google are\nexcellent examples of this. When you establish a unique design language for\nyour product, people begin to see them as lifestyles instead of just a product\nthey use. They get excited about releases and want to hear about what you are\nworking on.\n\nMany organizations go so far as to open-source their design systems, driving\nfurther interest in their product as a resource beyond a service. Good public\nrelations is just one more selling point when trying to get internal buy-in\nfor your design system .\n\n## Selling Your System Worksheet\n\nNow that you’ve learned about all the different ways to communicate the value\nof your design system, it’s time to craft the pitch that’s right for your\norganization. We’ve put together this worksheet to help you understand\norganizational goals, map those goals to UX design goals, and identify your\nallies. Think of this business case as a road map to crafting convincing\narguments when talking about your design system.\n\n  1. 1.\n\nWhat is/are the long-term goal(s) of the organization? Is it an acquisition,\ngoing public, etc.?\n\n  2. 2.\n\nWhat is the goal of the organization for the coming year? This could be in the\nform of OKRs (Objective and Key Results), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators),\nor however your organization tracks and measures success.5\n\n  3. 3.\n\nWhat are the current efforts the UX team is making to achieve the\norganizational goals, both short-term and long-term?\n\n  4. 4.\n\nNow, look at your answers to 1, 2, and 3. Identify how a design system can\nsupport these efforts and write them down. If you are unsure, consult a\ncolleague for insight.\n\n  5. 5.\n\nAre there specific areas of the product needing work that can be coupled with\ndevelopment of the design system? For example, perhaps you have long settings\npages that desperately need to be cleaned up with the use of better spacing,\nform styling, and sectioning. Work on this area and document the updated\nspacing, form styles, and sections in the system. Push to have these new\nusability patterns and styling implemented throughout the product.\n\n  6. 6.\n\nBased on your answers to questions 1–5, who are the people in your\norganization that would benefit most from a design system? Focus on individual\npersonas, such as a product manager, developer, chief marketing officer, etc.\nList each persona by title and how they’ll benefit:\n\n     * Title: How they benefit from the system...\n\n     * Title: How they benefit from the system...\n\n     * Title: How they benefit from the system... \n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nYou need support to make your system successful, which means that getting buy-\nin before you start is essential. There are three target audiences for a\ndesign system: the employees of the organization, the organization, and the\nusers of the product. Approach this in the same way you would a design\nproblem, by understanding each audience’s unique goals and challenges.\n\nEach member of your organization has something to gain from a design system.\nDesigners will benefit from the consistency and availability of centralized\nsolutions. A system will buy them time, allowing them to devote more effort to\nuser experience, research, and exploratory work. Engineers and product\nmanagers can gain easy access to specs and assets and can utilize readily\navailable solutions. Sales and marketing can use the system to answer customer\nquestions and demonstrate a future vision to prospective customers.\n\nUse both qualitative and quantitative measurements to establish the ROI of a\ndesign system for an organization. Some examples of measurable benefits are\nproductivity, cost savings, sales, and customer satisfaction. It will be\nimportant to take baseline measurements and continue to measure results along\nthe way.\n\nYou will have to use several methods and channels to communicate with your\nteam and colleagues about your design system. Use the methods outlined in this\nchapter to further your efforts and gain buy-in within your organization.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\nRedlined designs are specs that are generated by designers which place red\nlines on top of mockups to indicate the sizing and spacing of elements.\n\n2\n\nBenedict Sheppard et al., “The business value of design,” _McKinsey Quarterly_\n, [https://​www.​mckinsey.​com/​business-functions/​mckinsey-design/​our-\ninsights/​the-business-value-of-design](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design), October\n2018.\n\n3\n\nTo learn more about SUS visit [https://​www.​usability.​gov/​how-to-and-\ntools/​methods/​system-usability-scale.​html](https://www.usability.gov/how-\nto-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html)\n\n4\n\nRoger S.Pressman, _Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach_ (New York:\nMcGraw-Hill) 1987.\n\n5\n\nOKR and KPI are leadership processes for setting, communicating, and\nmonitoring goals and results in an organization.

Design As a Language\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nCommunication is essential in our everyday lives. It allows us to distribute\nknowledge, learn complex ideas, and facilitate the development of\nrelationships. Successful communication is achieved when people share the same\nlanguage. By thinking about design systems as a shared language, your\norganization will establish a better and more consistent means of\ncommunication. The basis of language is composed of two attributes:\n\n  * **Lexicon** : Within a language, a lexicon refers to the total number of fragments (or words) that make up that language. These fragments form the foundation of a language and can be arranged and rearranged in an infinite number of ways. When viewed in their simplest form, these fragments are meaningless. Often, it isn’t until we begin using them as building blocks that we can derive meaning and effectively communicate with one another. Within a design system, these fragments make up your elements, as depicted in Figure 4-1.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 4-1\n\nThe distinct elements shown in this figure work together to create an\ninterface that has different meaning than each part in isolation\n\n  * **Grammar** : Language relies on a system of rules, known as a grammar. Without a shared understanding of the rules that govern a language, we are bound to experience misconceptions and communication breakdown. Once a grammar is established, we can focus on higher-level ideas, rather than form or structure. Within a design system, guidelines are introduced to form the grammar of our system. In other words, usage and technical guidelines help define when and how individual components should be used. Figure 4-2 shows how guidelines help to establish reusability among components.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 4-2\n\nDocumented guidelines help to ensure the preceding component is consistently\nreused to build three separate content areas\n\nBy thinking about design as a language system, we can create a lexicon\ncomprised of elements and document a grammar, or series of guidelines, that\ngovern their use.\n\nEach language contains a different set of a lexicon and a grammar, making the\nlanguage unique. In terms of a design system, guiding principles are used as\nthe method to create a design language that is distinct to your organization.\nThese principles enable you to build a relationship that addresses both user\nneeds and organizational goals.\n\n## Lexicon: The Elements of Your System\n\nLanguage is a system comprised of interconnecting elements that work together\nto aid communication. Thinking about design as a system will allow you to\ncreate the lexicon, or building blocks, that can be arranged in multiple ways\nto make up your product.\n\nDepending on the state of your organization, it can be helpful to approach\nthinking systematically from two directions:\n\n  1. 1.\n\nBuilding up elements to create larger interfaces.\n\n  2. 2.\n\nBreaking down interfaces into their simplest elements.\n\n### Building Up Elements\n\nIf your team is starting a relatively new project, it is helpful to start with\nthe simplest element and build your interface up from there. Start by\nidentifying what elements are commonly used. These include various stylistic\nelements, such as typography and colors, as well as interactive components,\nsuch as inputs, buttons, and so on.\n\nOnce you have defined your elements, you can start to build on them, making\nmore complex components or component groups, as shown in Figures 4-3 and 4-4.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig3_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 4-3\n\nA label, input, and button create a form\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig4_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 4-4\n\nA button with a list of anchors create a dropdown\n\nComponent groups can then be combined to create larger interface areas, such\nas a navigation bar. Your navigation could comprise multiple tabs, dropdowns,\nand a search bar. When large groups of components come together and have a\ndistinct set of rules, they form a region, as shown in Figure 4-5.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_4_Chapter/468954_1_En_4_Fig5_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 4-5\n\nNavigation region\n\n### Note\n\nFor more information on building components, see Chapter\n[5](468954_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### Breaking Down Interfaces\n\nIf you have already designed interfaces for your product, it is helpful to\nbegin by breaking down your UI and determining which aspects are repeated\nthroughout your product or application. The most effective way of breaking\ndown an interface is to create an inventory of the elements, components, and\ncomponent groups you already use within your product.\n\n### Note\n\nFor more information on how to create an interface inventory, see Chapter\n[5](468954_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### How a System Helps You Scale Design\n\nBuilding up and breaking down your interface are two methods of thinking about\ndesign systematically. These approaches are not sequential; they can happen at\nthe same time. Think holistically, while also considering the individual\npieces that make up the whole. Considering each piece that makes up a design\nwill ensure that you are defining components that can be used globally across\nyour product.\n\nIt is necessary to think about how your design will scale as your product\ngrows. Not only does your team size have the potential to increase, so does\nthe number and complexity of interactions you will have to take into account.\nKeeping a design system will save your team time from having to reinvent\nsolutions. It will create cohesiveness and keep your application DRY. In turn,\nthis creates a consistent experience that reduces friction and cognitive load\nfor your users.\n\n## Grammar: The Guidelines of Your System\n\nA grammar is formed when you apply formal rules to govern the behavior of your\nelements. This in turn creates meaning. Your design system thrives when you\ncommit to including documentation as part of your creation process. By writing\ndown guidelines, you are reinforcing desired behaviors and promoting\nconsistency. Ultimately, teams are encouraged to learn your design language\nand use it to communicate appropriately.\n\nWhen documenting new rules, think about it from multiple perspectives.\nRemember that the organization, your team, and your users, along with product,\nmarketing, and engineering, all stand to benefit from the system you create.\nIf you keep them all in mind, your language will be universal and usable by\neveryone.\n\nWhen getting started, it can be helpful to look toward other design systems\nfor inspiration and guidance. However, keep in mind that those organizations\nare solving for different goals and needs. It is important to create a system\nthat works for your organization, rather than merely adapting the rules and\nguidelines that were determined for another organization.\n\n### Different Types of Guidelines\n\nThere are several types of guidelines that should be included within your\ndesign system. These include:\n\n  * **A formal definition** : A brief overview of what you are documenting. What is a button? This may seem straightforward to you, but being explicit strengthens your language and the overall understanding that your team shares.\n\n  * **Usage guidelines** : Explain the use of each component. Include behavioral rules. When should you use placeholder text within an input? How do alerts differ from toast notifications? These are questions that should be answered when reading your design system.\n\n  * **Technical guidelines** : Work closely with your engineering team to include any technical guidelines that will aid in the creation and use of a component within your product. This could include class names, as well as other options passed via data attributes or JavaScript.\n\n  * **Related components** : Link related components to help those navigating your system find what they are looking for more easily.\n\nRemember that as components are combined to create more component groups,\nthose component groups need documentation as well. Specific rules come out of\ncomponent groups that do not exist for the individual components. For example,\nan input is just an input until you attach a button to it. Then it becomes a\nform. As a form, this component group has new guidelines and rules aside from\nthose of its individual parts. Document the usage of buttons on their own, as\nwell as when they are added to create a form.\n\nWhen creating interfaces, some guidelines may feel organic. For example, your\nteam may intuitively know which button to use in any specific situation.\nAssuming that everyone has a shared understanding of when and where to use\ncertain components can cause teams to skip the documentation step. Take\ncaution; skipping documentation is dangerous and leads to inconsistencies.\nWithout clearly defined guidelines, multiple interpretations can occur. Even\nif the use of a component feels organic, you must define it explicitly.\n\n### Contextual Rules\n\nCreating contextual rules may be necessary. Contextual rules occur when there\nis an instance that requires a deviation from the standard guidelines. Be\nflexible with your system but remember that creating an abundance of\ncontextual rules or exceptions will make your system more difficult to\nmaintain. If there is a need for an exception, ensure that you write detailed\ndocumentation explaining both the change, as well as a clear reason, so that\nyour entire team has a shared understanding. More important, first ask\nyourself if an exception is truly needed or if this points to a larger\nconsistency issue.\n\n### Our experience\n\nA design system is not meant to be a rigid set of rules that remove creativity\nfrom the process. You are allowed to create deviations in your guidelines so\nlong as you are intentional in your choices and document your decisions. Be\nstrict but understand that outliers are sometimes necessary to improve your\ninterface and user experience.\n\n## Design Principles\n\nEvery organization has a unique set of needs and goals. The ability to\ncommunicate these needs and goals through a set of principles will allow you\nto shape the way your organization talks about its product.\n\n### Defining Design Principles\n\nDesign principles combine organizational goals with user needs, creating the\ncore values that aid us in making crucial design decisions. Effective design\nprinciples will align designers and build cohesiveness within your product and\nacross teams. Additionally, design principles provide an anchor for teams to\nrally around. When a new member joins, your principles should be the guiding\nlight that acquaints them with the core goals of your organization.\n\nSuccessful design principles consist of phrases that provide valuable insight\ninto both what the team is striving to accomplish and why. This means that\nconcise, yet descriptive, principles are often more effective than single\nwords. For example:\n\n> _Minimal and efficient_\n\nvs.\n\n> _Bring a sharp focus by helping customers know what matters now_\n\nMinimalism and efficiency are common traits to strive for in user experience.\nThis often means that those words lose their power when used as principles.\nWhile it can be useful to write down keywords such as these to establish high-\nlevel goals, be sure to drill down further and determine what they mean for\nyour organization.\n\nIncluding descriptive principles in your design system will give you and your\nteam a reference to draw upon when conflicts or uncertainty arise. The goal of\nyour design principles is to help govern a mode of thinking for your team,\nsetting it apart from systems used by other organizations.\n\n### A Practical Guide to Creating Your Own\n\nBegin thinking about your own set of principles by reflecting on what your\nproduct is trying to accomplish for your users. Look to your organization’s\nculture and consider the behaviors that you reward internally. Identify the\nvoice you use to talk to customers and the identity you portray to users.\nThese can provide valuable insight when determining which principles hold the\nmost meaning for your organization.\n\nFocus on creating three to five solid design principles that reflect the goals\nof your organization and the needs of your user base. Creating too many\nprinciples will make them difficult to follow and adhere to, while too few\nwon’t provide enough guidance for a wide variety of experiences.\n\nIf some principles stand out more than others, you may benefit from using a\nranking system. A value hierarchy allows your team to understand which\nprinciples hold more weight. Visualizing the hierarchy by creating an ordered\nlist, or pyramid structure, can be helpful. Alternatively, all principles may\nbe considered equally within your organization. Both strategies are valid but\nshould be documented clearly. If your team is experiencing conflicts often,\nconsider reexamining the principles you’ve defined. Chances are that if your\nprinciples are often in conflict, then one or more may not match your goals or\nneeds.\n\n### Defining Your Design Principles\n\n  1. 1.\n\n**Build a team** : Start by inviting your whole team to participate. The more\ndiscussion you have as a group, the better the alignment you will achieve\nwithin your team. Include engineers and product managers as part of the\nconversation. Gaining their buy-in and insight from the start is vital to\nbuilding your shared language.\n\n  2. 2.\n\n**Set a clear purpose** : Ensure the team understands the objective of the\nmeeting. The goal should be to determine which principles best align with your\norganizational goals and user needs. If these are unknown to you and your\nteam, seek out key stakeholders within your organization. You should be able\nto produce a list of goals and needs prior to determining your design\nprinciples. Also, understand that these goals and needs may change over time.\n\n  3. 3.\n\n**Prepare** : Ask each team member to brainstorm five to ten ideas in advance.\nThis will make the discussion more productive, as each person will bring new\nideas to the table at the start of the meeting.\n\n  4. 4.\n\n**Discuss** : Bring physical sticky notes or use an online platform that\nallows you and your team to move ideas around on a board easily. This provides\na way to group similar ideas and visually see which concepts stand out. Allow\nsome time for new ideas to form and address outliers or conflicts as they come\nup. When in doubt, revisit your organizational goals and user needs to better\nmap your design principles to those values.\n\n  5. 5.\n\n**Iterate** : Goals and needs change over time. Be open to adjusting your\ndesign principles as your organization shifts. Recognize when a principle is\nnot benefiting your team and strive to keep your principles at the forefront\nof your design thinking.\n\n## A Shared Language\n\nIncluding other teams in the creation process of your system will lead to a\nbetter understanding of the overall language you are creating. To be fluent in\na language, you must actively use it. The same can be said for your design\nsystem. The more team members you have using and contributing to it, the more\ncohesion your organization will experience.\n\nKeep in mind that a design system, just like a language, can and should evolve\nover time. Change is a natural part of a language that allows new functions\nand concepts to form. As you begin to craft your own design language, be rigid\nwith your guidelines but be open to change as your system adapts and grows.\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nYour design language is a vehicle for communicating. Every language consists\nof a lexicon and a grammar. Within your design system, elements build to\ncomponents, which build to component groups, all comprising your lexicon. Your\ngrammar is composed of the guidelines you define for each aspect of your\ndesign system, including usage and technical guidelines.\n\nCreating your own design principles will encourage you and your team to create\nelements and guidelines that best serve your unique product and organization.\nPrinciples should be concise yet distinct to your organizational goals and\nuser needs.\n\nTo strengthen your design language, involve others during the creation\nprocess. The more team members who use and contribute to your system, the more\neffective it will be.\n\n\n© Sarrah Vesselov and Taurie Davis 2019\n\nSarrah Vesselov and  Taurie Davis Building Design Systems\n<https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-4514-9_5>\n\n# 5\\. Implementing Your System\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nNow that we’ve established the “why” of a design system and learned how to\nthink about design as a language, the next step is to begin implementation. In\nthis section, we will start by assessing your organization, building a support\nsystem, and understanding the state of your product. You will learn how to\nbuild a predictable architecture that supports the multiple areas that make up\nyour system. Once there is a clear foundation, you can begin designing,\nbuilding, and implementing components while ensuring to clearly document\ndecisions along the way. We’ve provided three case studies to help ground the\ndiscussion and provide real-world scenarios for how to implement a system\nbased on individual needs.\n\n## Assessing Your Organization\n\nThe way you tackle your design system will largely depend on your\norganization. Begin by assessing the type of organization, your stakeholder\nbuy-in, and your team size, to understand the challenges you face, as well as\nhow to best begin implementation.\n\n### Type of Organization\n\nIs your organization a product shop or an agency? You’ll want to approach your\ndesign system differently depending on whether you are building one or\nmultiple products.\n\nWhen working on one application, start by defining your layout and styles.\nThese guidelines will establish the foundation needed for all components.\n\nAgencies, on the other hand, often have multiple clients. Their design system\nhas to adapt to different themes and functionality to support multiple clients\nand products. Start by defining or identifying the critical components that\nare used throughout all of your products. Create a layout system that is\ndriven by a central set of variables. In programming, variables are used to\nrepresent a value that can change depending on the information or conditions.1\nWhen building interfaces, these variables include values for spacing that can\nbe customized on a product-by-product basis. Starting from a flexible layout\nwill give you a solid foundation that allows the freedom to customize each\nproduct and project.\n\nYou’ll then work to create flexible styles that can be applied on top of your\ndefined components to further customize and suit different needs, as\ndemonstrated in Figure 5-1. This method, known as theming, allows you to\nintroduce a unique visual language for each distinct brand.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.jpg](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nFigure 5-1\n\nFlexible styles can transform the same component, giving it a completely\ndifferent visual language while maintaining the same foundation\n\n### Stakeholder Buy-In\n\nThe support you have from others within your organization will play a critical\nrole in how you build out your system. If you do not have buy-in from key\nstakeholders, you will have to be more strategic in approaching\nimplementation. While helpful, it is not necessary to have stakeholder buy-in\nto start implementing your system. Carve out time to start defining your\nelements and documenting your guidelines as a first step. Keep track of how\nthese improvements are helping you work faster and smarter to build the\nbusiness case. As these become more concrete, the perceived value of your\nsystem will grow over time, and the business case will be more evident to the\norganization.\n\n### Note\n\nFor more information on how to gain stakeholder buy-in, review Chapter\n[3](468954_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### Team Size\n\nA small team typically struggles to find the necessary time to build out a\nfully functioning system, while a large organization may grapple with getting\nahead of the inconsistencies that have built up over the years. The problems\nyou experience will vary, depending on the size of the team. Remain aware of\nthe challenges your organization is facing and be prepared to come up with a\ngame plan to address these problems at the start of implementation.\n\nReview the case studies at the end of this chapter for real-world insight into\nhow your type of organization, stakeholder buy-in, and team size can all\naffect your design system.\n\n## Gathering a Support System\n\nOnce you’ve assessed your organization, begin to gather support from co-\nworkers. Some organizations are lucky enough to form dedicated design system\nteams that comprise designers, engineers, and product managers. However, this\nis relatively uncommon when first beginning. It is more likely that you will\nstart on your own, with the help of a few co-workers you may have to recruit.\n\nClearly articulate what a design system is when talking with your peers. One\ncommon misconception is that a design system is solely a place to house the\nvisual aspect of each component. To address this misconception, explain that a\ndesign system encompasses all areas of your platform: from design principles\nand usability guidelines, to live component examples, and technical rules.\n\nBuild enthusiasm among those who show interest in learning more about your\neffort. These will be your most reliable allies throughout the process. If you\ndon’t have a technical background, it is crucial to form a relationship with\nthe members of your team who can assist with the technical implementation.\nWithout them, you will struggle to make headway on completing your design\nsystem.\n\nOver the course of implementation, you will need a team that can:\n\n  * Research best practices.\n\n  * Make an interface inventory.\n\n  * Design and define your layout, styles, and components.\n\n  * Document guidelines.\n\n  * Review documentation.\n\n  * Build and implement components.\n\n  * Iterate and refine.\n\n  * Evangelize your efforts across your organization.\n\n## Assessing Your Product\n\nCreating systematic design requires a structured approach. If you jump\nstraight into creating new components for your product without first\nunderstanding the current state of your interface, you will fall into the trap\nof continuously redesigning the same components. Begin by understanding where\nyour problem areas are in order to create a system that brings focus and\nefficiency.\n\n### Utilize an Interface Inventory\n\nInconsistencies within your product can lead to confusing experiences for your\nusers. To help understand the current state of your product or application,\ncreate an interface inventory. An inventory will surface inconsistencies and\nlay the groundwork for correcting them.\n\n### Note\n\nIf your product is brand new, you may choose to forgo creating an interface\ninventory at this time.\n\nTo begin, capture and record all of the elements and components used within\nyour UI. The easiest way to do this is to screenshot each one. You don’t need\nto log every instance, simply document each unique design. Include typography,\ninputs, radios, buttons, etc. Be meticulous. Every individual element and\ncomponent used throughout your product should be recorded. Navigate page by\npage until you feel confident that you have grabbed each one.\n\nFrom here, you can begin categorizing. Group duplicates together and look for\ninconsistencies, as shown in Figure 5-2.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig2_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-2\n\nAn interface inventory showing icon inconsistencies\n\nUse your interface inventory as a jumping-off point. Now that you have\neverything recorded, you’ll be able to use this to start working toward a\ncomprehensive component library. Knowing the current state of your product\nwill allow you to successfully break down your design system into intuitive\ncategories.\n\n## Creating a Predictable Architecture\n\nHow you organize your system is crucial to the success of your design system.\nBreaking your system down into predictable categories will keep your content\neasily discoverable. Remain open to adjusting the architecture as you build\nout and expand on your system.\n\n### Categorizing to Improve Discoverability\n\nA successful design system will contain multiple parts. As mentioned earlier\nin Chapter [2](468954_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml), you can break down your design\nsystem into the following six interlocking areas:\n\n  * **Layout** : Defined measures that make up your spacing and grid system.\n\n  * **Styles** : Core aspects of your visual language. These include colors, iconography, and typography.\n\n  * **Components** : Core elements of an interface. These include buttons and form fields.\n\n  * **Regions** : Overarching design paradigms, such as navigation or search.\n\n  * **Content** : Information regarding the voice and tone, as well as punctuation guidelines. Content can also include terminology if your product has a specific vocabulary.\n\n  * **Usability** : Rules that define accessibility and internationalization.\n\nBreaking your system down into sections will provide a sense of organization,\nmaking it easier to find the information required to complete a specific task.\n\nUsing the preceding six categories as a base, begin to piece together the\nstructure for your system. Your system should consider all areas, but they\nwill vary in size depending on your organization. Don’t get stuck on\nconforming to a set of categories or rules that don’t work for your\norganizational goals or user needs. Categories will help to communicate\ndifferent areas of focus, but keep in mind that your design language needs\nroom to grow and evolve over time.\n\n### Card Sorting\n\nAs your design system expands, you may not always be sure where specific\ncontent should live. When this happens, utilize a card-sorting technique to\ndetermine what should be grouped together. You may find that you need to add a\nnew category, or change a category name, to fit new content.\n\n#### How to Perform a Card Sort\n\nThere are many tools available to assist with creating a card sort, but all\nyou really need are pen and paper. The primary objective is to determine how\npeople categorize the information in your system to build a predictable\narchitecture.\n\n  1. 1.\n\nIf you’ve already begun creating your design system, start by capturing the\ndifferent parts that make up your system. Include any new components or\nguidelines you are looking to add. Use your interface inventory to incorporate\ncomponents you have identified. Drag-and-drop interactions, common terms, and\nfilters are perfect examples of what you may be looking to categorize.\n\n### Note\n\nYou will want to limit the number of cards you create to reduce fatigue during\nthe study. This may mean that not all elements or guidelines are captured in\nyour research. Aim to be broad enough so that you can use the findings to\ncategorize cards that didn’t make it into the test. Alternatively, if you\ndon’t have enough cards to test, it will be difficult for users to find\nparallels between them. Try to keep your number of cards between 30 and 50.\n\n  1. 2.\n\nRecruit seven to ten participants to take part in your card sort.\n\n  2. 3.\n\nFor each participant, mix up the order of your cards and allow them to\norganize the content into any categories they choose. Give the participant the\nopportunity to write their own category names. This will give you more insight\ninto how they would structure and define the content.\n\n  3. 4.\n\nAfter every participant has finished their sorting, analyze how often the same\ncards were grouped together, as well as how often the same categories were\ncreated.\n\n  4. 5.\n\nUse your analysis to tweak the information architecture of your system as\nneeded.\n\n## Layout\n\nA foundational aspect included in your system is the layout, which includes\nguidelines for both your spacing and grid. These provide a solid base from\nwhich you can create components and build interfaces.\n\nRemember: If you are creating a system for multiple products, consider\ncreating a series of variables that allow you to customize your layout for\neach one.\n\n### Spacing\n\nA series of spacing increments will create the foundation for the padding and\nmargin used within your product. Figure 5-3 shows how padding and margin are\napplied to a series of buttons to make up the spacing.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-3\n\nPadding is used to add space between the text and borders of the buttons,\nwhile margin makes up the space between components\n\nCreate a spacing system that uses a set series of increments for defining\npadding and margin. Specify a starting number from which your spacing will\nderive. A starting number of eight is often used for spacing systems because\nit is scaled easily to different resolutions, making it ideal for the growing\nnumber of devices that are out there today. Also, a base of eight provides a\nvariety of increments when used within a mathematical progression without\noverwhelming designers with choices. This is demonstrated in Figure 5-4. As an\nalternative, use a geometric progression to limit the number of options\nfurther while still allowing for visually appealing interfaces. Regardless of\nthe progression you choose, be deliberate in your decision.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig4_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig4_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-4\n\nA spacing system using a mathematical progression with a starting base of 8px\n\nIn the end, you will have to determine the most appropriate starting number\nfor your needs, as well as the increments to use across your product.\n\n### Grid\n\nThere are multiple types of grids, most commonly column and baseline grids.\nColumn grids are regularly used within web development to separate\ndiscontinuous content. Equal spacing between columns keeps content divided\nuniformly, allowing users to digest information quickly. Column grids can also\nbe rearranged to accommodate different screen sizes, making them ideal for\nimplementing a responsive design. While column grids are useful in many\nlayouts, they may not always be appropriate in others. A complex web app may\nrequire more flexibility than column grids allow. High-density information,\nfor example, would benefit from implementing a strict measurement system that\ncould be used in place of, or in addition to, column grids.\n\nFurther, utilizing a baseline grid will keep your units horizontally aligned\nto one another. Baseline grids align all of your text to a horizontal grid.\nThe x-height2 of each letter is anchored onto this grid, keeping content\nlegible and reducing the guesswork when building out new user interfaces. With\nconsistent spacing, you can ensure that the hierarchy of your content is well-\ndefined and easy to determine.\n\nIt is helpful to choose a baseline number that provides flexibility when\nspacing out components while also creating legible line-heights. Your baseline\nshould be a derivative of your spacing system. In the spacing example shown in\nFigure 5-5, a baseline number of four aligns with your mathematical\nprogression while also providing enough flexibility within your designs.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig5_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig5_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-5\n\nComponents placed on a baseline grid of 4px\n\n## Styles\n\nYour styles make up your visual language and include typography, colors, and\nicons. As you define these elements, be sure to reference the design\nprinciples you created for your organization. This will help to align your\noverall visual language with the design language you are crafting.\n\nIf you are working with one product, you only need to define your styles once.\nHowever, if you are building a system for multiple products or clients, you\nwill need to create a theming system that allows you to customize the visual\nlanguage of each unique product.\n\n### Creating a Typographic System\n\nTypography that functions well, conforms to user needs, and aligns with your\nbaseline grid can be a challenge to get right. To ensure that your typography\naligns with your baseline grid and has readable line-heights, we have found\nthat it is useful to break down your typography into two categories: UI\ntypography and long-form typography.\n\nUI typography makes up the text used within your UI components, such as button\ntext, input labels, or dropdown options. To ensure that your elements align to\nyour baseline grid, the line-height of your UI typography should strictly\nalign to a multiple of the starting number chosen in your layout rules. This\nis shown in Figure 5-6.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig6_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig6_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-6\n\nThe UI typography within the input box uses a line-height of 16px. This is a\nmultiple of the starting unit 8, chosen in the illustrated spacing system\n\nIn many cases, the line-height for UI typography can feel crowded when applied\nto larger bodies of text. In these instances, create a system for long-form\ntypography that uses improved line-heights for better readability, as\ndemonstrated in Figures 5-7 and 5-8. If your product includes any form of\ndescriptive text, you should consider whether creating a separate long-form\ntypography system would benefit your users.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig7_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig7_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-7\n\nLine-heights for UI typography are too small for readable text when used for\nlong-form text\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig8_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig8_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-8\n\nUI typography vs. long-form typography\n\nAligning your typography with your baseline grid and measurement system is one\nof the more frustrating parts to get right. It can take a lot of trial and\nerror. Take time to experiment. Nailing down a typographic system that aligns\nwith your layout makes the remainder of your visual decisions a breeze.\n\n### An Accessible Color System\n\nColors are an important consideration when determining the aesthetic of your\nproduct or projects. Because they do not affect layout or functionality, your\ncolor palette can be iterated freely. This makes your color system an easy\nfirst choice if you are struggling with where to begin once you start\ntechnical implementation.\n\nAs you build or refine your color system, keep accessibility at the forefront\nof your mind. Colors play a huge role in calling attention to individual UI\nelements, but a lack of contrast between colors can quickly make your\napplication difficult to use by users with visual impairments. Depending on\nyour organization, you may have to support a higher level of contrast, as\ndefined by the [Web Content Accessibility\nGuidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG). For\nexample, organizations that operate internationally will encounter a higher\naccessibility threshold due to stricter laws in some countries. Figure 5-9\nshows different color combinations with their WCAG rating.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig9_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig9_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-9\n\nColor combinations and their corresponding rating, according to the WCAG\n\nAs shown in Figure 5-10, you may choose to create a color system that includes\npalettes for each primary color. These palettes include shade variations, such\nas secondary and tertiary options. Like other areas of your system, the more\noptions you add, the more flexibility you will have. Keep in mind that this\nflexibility can bring inconsistencies while also making documentation more\nchallenging to manage.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig10_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_5_Chapter/468954_1_En_5_Fig10_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 5-10\n\nA series of shades that make up a palette. This provides flexibility and the\nability to define primary, secondary, and tertiary options.\n\n### Our experience\n\nIf you choose to create an expansive color system, implement color priorities\nto reduce your decision making during the design process. You can achieve\ncolor priorities by creating a system similar to font weights. Assign your\ncolors a numbered value that corresponds to the hierarchy in which they should\nbe used.\n\n### Uniform Iconography\n\nNot all products will require their own set of icons. You can take advantage\nof multiple open source icon fonts. However, one primary benefit of creating\nyour own set of icons is the ability to align them with your distinct visual\nlanguage. If you are creating your own icon set, remember to document your\nprocess thoroughly. Establish an icon grid and core shapes in order to\nmaintain proportions and visual consistency across icons. The rest of your\nteam should understand the structure that makes up your icons, as well as how\nto export and include them within your application. If necessary, get the help\nof your engineering team to create an icon viewer that allows your\norganization to search for existing icons quickly. For ease of use, include a\nway to copy the source code or download a vector version.\n\n## Components\n\nAs you begin to design and define components, look back at what was included\nwithin your interface inventory. Establish a structure that mimics the way\ncomponents will be implemented. A systematic approach will bring your design\nand engineering teams closer together while ensuring that components stay DRY\nand reusable.\n\n### Creating a Component Library\n\nBuilding a component library will help your design team to visually see how\nlayout and style guidelines apply to each component. Often, your component\nlibrary will start within a design tool, but it can also be created directly\nin code.\n\nYou can use your component library as a playground when first determining your\nprimary set of guidelines. Remember to think about your specific product and\nstart by creating the components that are most relevant to your needs.\n\nReview your inventory and choose the ten most widely used components to get\nstarted. This most often will mean starting with the basic components that\nmake up your interface: buttons, inputs, labels, tool tips, etc. Beginning\nwith these will create a solid foundation on which to build more complex\ncomponent groups as you work through your interface inventory.\n\n### Tooling\n\nThere are many different tools you can use throughout the creation process.\nThis can include design software, front-end frameworks, and UI development\nenvironments.\n\n  * **Design software** : Tools, such as Sketch or Figma, give your design team the flexibility to play with applying different guidelines to your components.\n\n  * **Front-end frameworks** : Many front-end teams use frameworks as a base for their component structure that can then be easily modified to fit unique styles. Bootstrap and Foundation are common web frameworks used by many teams.\n\n  * **UI development environments** : Your team may also choose to use an interactive UI development environment, such as Storybook. Tools like these allow developers to build components in an isolated setting, providing a way to easily test each component independently of your product.\n\nChoosing tools can be an arduous task, especially considering the number of\noptions available for designers and engineers today. It is easy to get caught\nup in the latest tool, turning progress into tool churn.\n\nTools are always evolving, but it’s important to keep in mind that constant\nchange may slow progress. Evaluate your tools carefully and decide what is\nbest for your team at this moment. Don’t get caught up in a niche toolset that\nmay disappear in a few months. Look at numerous aspects, such as performance,\nscalability, and reliability. The tools and technologies you use to create\nyour library are meant to help your team create your design system, not act as\nthe solution.\n\n### Building Components\n\nIn Chapter [4](468954_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml), we talked about how to build up\nelements to create components, component groups, and regions. This systematic\nstructure is important to keep in mind throughout the process of building your\ncomponent library. Thinking about your interface in this way will mimic the\nway in which your product is built by your engineering team.\n\nThere are many other methodologies that exist to help structure design in a\nsystematic way. You may choose whichever methodology works for you, so long as\nyou are thinking about your interface as building blocks. If this is a new\nconcept for you, be sure to bring in engineers early and get their perspective\noften. Doing so will strengthen your design language and propel\nimplementation.\n\nRemember: All your components should adhere to the rules you have previously\ndefined in other sections. If you are working for an agency and do not yet\nhave a set of flexible styles, create a series of components with base styles\nthat you can apply themes to later.\n\n## Regions\n\nYour system needs a place for documentation related to larger paradigms that\ngo beyond your components. These areas are often reused throughout your\nproduct and have specific guidelines that relate to the region as a whole.\n\nFor example, you may choose to classify a search bar as a component. However,\nif search plays a primary role within your product, has many interactions, and\nis reused often, consider categorizing search as a region. By setting it apart\nfrom an individual component, you recognize that the region has guidelines\nthat are made up of more than its building blocks.\n\nRegions provide the space to expand on interactions specific to your product.\nFor example, if your application has different user permissions, you can\ninclude guidelines related to how they affect your interface and user\nexperience. You may choose to add rules for logged-in vs. logged-out users.\nRegions also typically consist of rules that apply to your navigation\nstructure, such as guidelines for global and contextual navigation or a\ncomplex hierarchical structure. What you decide to include as a region will\nlargely depend on what product you are building.\n\n## Content\n\nLike regions, your content section will rely on the needs of your product.\nThis is a place for you to capture the voice and tone you want to portray in\nyour application. Collaborate with marketing to create a shared writing style\nand include useful terminology that is specific to your organization.\n\nIf you are working for an agency, this section will provide the space needed\nto create guidelines that help propel new projects. If your clients are\nsimilar, you can create a standardized voice to reference across projects.\nHowever, if your clients are varied, this section will act as a reference\npoint for different scenarios. Create guidelines that are useful for your\nagency to consider when taking on new clients. This could include the voice\nyou want to portray when working with a client who caters to children vs. one\nwho works primarily with mortgage brokers. One will be fun and friendly, while\nthe other will be more professional. Every product is unique, so the\ndocumentation you write in this section should be solely guidelines to\nreference and help get you started on new projects.\n\n## Usability\n\nHow usable your product is will define its success. Users should be able to\nfamiliarize themselves with your user interface quickly and without too much\nprompting. They should be able to achieve their objectives directly and with\nas little friction as possible. Upon returning to your product, they should be\nable to recall how to navigate and perform familiar actions. When building out\nyour design system, include guidelines that will improve the usability of your\nproduct. Two common usability concerns include accessibility and\ninternationalization.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nRegardless of whether you are working for a product shop or an agency, your\ndesign system should include accessibility guidelines. If you haven’t\nconsidered accessibility concerns, this is the perfect time to introduce this\nway of thinking into your organization.\n\nThere are various levels of accessibility, such as visual, hearing, and\ncognitive impairments, as well as motor disabilities. Keeping these at the\nforefront of your mind while designing will improve the overall experience for\nyour users.\n\nDepending on your audience, you will have to consider all accessibility\nconcerns and document the most appropriate action for your organization to\ntake. Should your product work with screen readers? Do your colors pass WCAG\ncontrast ratio standards? Do your touch points on mobile have large enough\ntargets? Is your font readable? In nearly all circumstances, your design\nsystem should take into account how your product will support these usability\nconcerns.\n\nTo show your commitment to accessibility, include a statement of compliance.\nThis statement should include your commitment to maintaining an accessible\nproduct, as well as the level of compliance to which you aim to conform. It is\nimportant to create guidelines for your individual product. It is not always\nnecessary to conform to all levels of compliance. Understand your user needs\nand create a statement of compliance that functions well for your intended\naudience.\n\n### Our experience\n\nThe Information Technology Industry (ITI) Council produces a Voluntary Product\nAccessibility Template (VPAT) that you can use to assess the compliance of\nyour product. While this document may be overwhelming at first, it is\ninvaluable in learning the leading accessibility standards while also\nshowcasing where your product can improve.\n\n### Internationalization\n\nIf you are delivering content to users around the world, internationalization\nis something you will have to account for and document. Supporting multiple\nlanguages will mean including translation mechanisms, changes in word\nalignment (right to left vs. left to right), as well as line-height and\nletter-spacing changes. Cultural differences should also be accounted for.\nLanguage and imagery should be tailored to best suit the culture of the region\nit is being delivered to.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nDefining, designing, and implementing your system can happen simultaneously.\nBegin by defining your layout, styles, and components. As you start to feel\nconfident in your new guidelines, work closely with front-end engineers to\nbegin implementing them in your design system. As you work in parallel, issues\nwill surface. Working together will allow you to fix unexpected problems\nearlier in the process.\n\nIf you created your component library using design software, use this as a\ntool to help communicate. Once you have begun to build your system using live\ncode, this will become the primary reference for your organization. Involve\nproduct, design, and engineering in the decision making and understand that\nchanges and additions along the way are inevitable.\n\n### A Single Source of Truth\n\nOne of the most difficult challenges teams face is the technical\nimplementation of their design system. Think about your system as a dependency\nfor your product; it should be the single source of truth that manages the\nstate of your components. The components within your design system should all\nutilize the same code that make up the building blocks of your product.\n\nTo build your components, you and your engineering team will use a series of\nprogramming tools to implement the markup (HTML), styling (CSS), and\nfunctionality (JavaScript) that you’ve defined in your guidelines.3 Think of\nthese programming tools as associated assets that are consumed by both your\ndesign system and your product. When used in this way, you are ensuring that\nyour design system is the single source of truth for your product.\n\nIt is common for edge cases to become apparent when your designs are applied\nto real-world scenarios. Take the necessary time to fix problems and iterate\nalong the way. As you continue to build and implement the components within\nyour system, you will want to manage revisions that are made over time. This\nworkflow, known as version control,4 allows you to compare old versions of\nyour components with new changes. In the event of a mistake, you can reference\nprevious decisions or even revert to older versions. Using a version control\nsystem ultimately ensures your entire team knows which version of your\ncomponent is most recent and up-to-date.\n\n### Incremental Implementation\n\nUnless you are starting with a brand-new application, you will want to\nintroduce changes into your product incrementally. When replacing old\ncomponents, there are two common methods:\n\n  * Replace one element throughout the entire product,\n\n  * Replace elements page by page.\n\nReplacing a component throughout your entire product is excellent for\nmaintaining consistency. However, if you have a large application, this method\ncan be overwhelming. Components affect other components, and if you are\nchanging your entire typography or spacing system, this will have a cascading\neffect. On the other hand, replacing elements one page at a time can hinder\nthe user experience. You don’t want to confuse users by having multiple\ninteractions for the same component.\n\nWhich method you choose will depend on how large your product is, how much\ntime your team can dedicate towards implementing these changes, and the\ncomplexity of your product. Most often, it will be more realistic to use a\ncombination of both methods. For example, implement your typography system\npage by page. While you work on implementing your typography across your\nproduct, you can also replace a simple component, such as inputs, all at once.\n\n### Our experience\n\nYou won’t be able to implement all your components immediately. If you already\nhave a product built, don’t waste time documenting guidelines for components\nyou are going to replace. Instead, spend your energy on creating rules for new\ncomponents you’ve defined in your component library. While this means that\nyour design system will reference guidelines that are not implemented, it will\ncreate a single source of truth for what your product should be utilizing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAs we discussed in Chapter [4](468954_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml), there are many\nguidelines that must be documented. These guidelines, as well as live code\nexamples, will make up the primary documentation for your design system.\n\nProvide clearly defined rules for how each component will be used. Readers\nshould be able to answer the what, when, where, and why of each component you\nhave documented. You will need to include any implementation rules that assist\nin using your components. This means including class names and code snippets.\nProviding live code examples will tie together usage guidelines with the\ntechnical rules, providing a visual representation of how the component should\nlook and function. Avoid including static images that can easily become out of\ndate over time.\n\nAs you implement your system iteratively, it is beneficial to call out the\nstate of each component. Create a page that shows each component status.\nInclude whether it is upcoming, in progress, or stable and ready for use. Tag\ncomponents as “new” if they’ve been recently added to your design system.\nProviding visibility into the status of each component gives your team a clear\noverview of the progress being made to your system.\n\n### Establish a System That Self-Documents\n\nWriting documentation is a challenge, and keeping documentation up to date is\neven tougher. By following the recommendations in this chapter, you will have\ncreated a structure that utilizes the same component for both your design\nsystem and your product. When a change is made to a component, the effect will\nbe seen in both places. This keeps your components up to date without having\nto manually make changes. Change the code in one place, and your design system\nwill update along with your product.\n\n### Searchability\n\nYou can vastly improve the usability of your design system by including a way\nfor your team to search through documentation. Finding the piece of\ndocumentation that you need can be difficult and time-consuming. Make it\neasier for your organization to use the documentation that you have worked so\nhard on by adding the ability to search the content you have created.\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nTo start implementing your design system, you must first assess your\norganization. Come to understand how your type of organization will affect the\ndecisions you must make when building your system. Learn whether you have\nstakeholder buy-in or if this is something you will have to develop over time.\nRecruit peers who show an interest in learning more and participating in the\ncreation of your design system.\n\nWhile you build a support network, assess the state of your current product.\nUtilize an interface inventory if your product is already underway. Begin to\nbreak down your product into the following six areas: layout, styles,\ncomponents, regions, content, and usability. These categories will keep your\ndesign system organized, but don’t be afraid to create your own. Use a card-\nsorting technique to better understand how to group different information\nwithin your system.\n\nDefine a set of layout guidelines and styles that can be applied to your\ncomponents. If you are working with multiple products, create flexible styles\nthat allow you to theme your system based on each brand’s unique visual\nlanguage. Determine which regions are essential to document and include unique\ncontent rules, such as voice and tone. Last, ensure that usability is at the\nforefront of your mind. Document accessibility guidelines and include\ninternationalization rules if that is relevant to your organization.\n\nWork closely with your engineering team to make your design system the single\nsource of truth for your organization. Implement a version control system that\nallows your team to reference previous iterations of your components. Make\ndocumentation a part of your creative process, and you will ensure that your\nsystem remains useful to your entire organization.\n\n### Case Studies\n\nOn the following pages, you will find examples of the different scenarios you\nmay experience. Bear in mind that there are countless combinations, and every\norganization is unique. Use the following case studies as a starting point\ntoward understanding the unique challenges your organization is facing and how\nyour team can navigate those during the beginning of your process.\n\n### A Single Product with a Large Team\n\n**Organization Type**\n\nYou work for a quickly growing organization that ships new features to users\nregularly. There are tight deadlines, and you ship fast, which sometimes means\nthe user experience is not what you would like it to be. Engineers work\nclosely with designers to ensure that you ship the best first iteration in the\ntime allotted. The executive team doesn’t quite see the benefit of a design\nsystem. However, as long as you continue to ship product, it doesn’t get in\nthe way of creating one.\n\n**Team Description**\n\nYou are on a large team that consists of a half-dozen designers and roughly 30\nfront-end engineers. The product designers were hired after the application\nhad begun to be implemented. All designers have a decent grasp of their visual\nlanguage, even though it has never been deliberately defined.\n\n**Challenges**\n\nThere are numerous inconsistencies throughout the application that have grown\nover the years. You are aware of them but can’t quite seem to get ahead.\n\n**Where to Begin**\n\nBegin by documenting what you already know intuitively. You may have\ntypography already established but not yet defined. Write down everything that\nis widely known to create your foundation. Then, begin to use this\ndocumentation to surface inconsistencies in your components. Don’t forget to\nutilize an interface inventory! Work component-by-component to integrate any\ndocumented changes into your product.\n\n**The Initial Benefit of a Design System**\n\nOver time, inconsistencies will begin to disappear as you start to document\nand implement your system.\n\n### An Agency With a Medium Team\n\n**Organization Type**\n\nYou work for an agency that brings in new clients throughout the year. Most\nprojects are similar, and you are typically working on multiple projects at\nthe same time. You move around from project-to-project as organizational needs\nshift and new clients come on board. Stakeholders are not concerned with a\ndesign system because they do not see how it could help clients.\n\n**Team Description**\n\nYou are part of a team with three designers and ten front-end engineers. The\nfirst UX designer was hired shortly after the engineers came on board. Client\ndemand increased, so two more designers were hired. As a team of three, you\nstarted a team component library, to keep components consistent throughout\nyour design tool. This made it easier to reuse components from client-to-\nclient. However, it is common for designers to add new components without\nupdating or cleaning up old ones, and this has made upkeep difficult. The\nlibrary is in jeopardy of being abandoned.\n\n**Challenges**\n\nThe team library is not scaling with the team. It is becoming unwieldy and not\nuseful. You aren’t sure how to keep it up to date as you continue to work on\nnew projects.\n\n**Where to Begin**\n\nBegin by creating an interface inventory for your past three projects. This\nwill help establish the primary components you use across projects. With a\ncomponent library already started, you are in an excellent position to update\nyour existing files using strict rules. After you have a clear inventory to\nwork from, create base components that you can apply different styles to\ndepending on the client. Getting your system implemented will be imperative\nsince updating styles for each product will be much easier when you have\ntheming in place.\n\n**The Initial Benefit of a Design System**\n\nStarting your design system will increase productivity. It will also close\ngaps within your team and free up time spent on dealing with old, outdated\ndesign files from dead projects.\n\n### A Single Product With a Small Team\n\n**Organization Type**\n\nYou work for a small startup that is just getting off the ground. This is your\nfirst job as a user-experience designer, and you are learning the ropes as\nquickly as you can. Your boss is invested in your learning but is more focused\non both business and product.\n\n**Team Description**\n\nYou are a team of one designer and four engineers. The team was hired around\nthe same time, at the start of the project. Because you are the sole designer,\nthere are not many inconsistencies in the product. However, you are not in\nconstant communication with the engineers, and therefore, not all your designs\ntranslate as expected during the implementation phase.\n\n**Challenges**\n\nWith limited development background, your designs may not always come out as\nexpected. You struggle to speak in the same language as your engineering team.\n\n**Where to Begin**\n\nBegin by working closely with your front-end team to understand all the\ncomponents being used within your product. Sit down with them and make a list\nof the top-ten components used and start applying a set of defined styles to\nthem. Work to shape a shared design language that both you and your front-end\nteam will understand.\n\n**The Initial Benefit of a Design System**\n\nAs your design system begins to form, you will start to have more power over\nthe experiences you are creating. You’ll gain a better understanding of\nimplementation limitations and be more adept at designing experiences that\ntranslate well to code. As the implemented design becomes more predictable and\nfamiliar to you, the overall user experience will improve as well.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\nThe most common method for doing this is to set up core variables, using CSS\nor Sass. Another method for custom theming worth noting is “design tokens.”\nUsed by Salesforce Lightning Design System, among others, design tokens are\nnamed entities that store UI attributes. They are often stored in JSON or YAML\nfiles and can be shared in nearly any format: JavaScript objects,\nSass/Less/CSS variables, Sketch files, etc.\n\n2\n\n“<Emphasis type=\"Italic\">x-height</ Emphasis> ” refers to the height of a\nlower-case <Emphasis type=\"Italic\">x</ Emphasis>. In typography, the x-height\nrepresents the distance between the baseline and the midline of lower case\nletters for a given typeface.\n\n3\n\nHTML, CSS, and JavaScript are common languages used for web applications. If\nyou are building a design system for mobile products, the technologies used\nwill vary.\n\n4\n\nThe most common system used for version control is Git. It is free and open\nsource.

Measure and Maintain\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nDesign systems require continuous effort. Even as you are writing design\nguidelines and working with engineering to implement your components, there\nwill be revisions and improvements to be made along the way. Focus on the\nfollowing key areas as you continue to grow your design system: measuring the\neffectiveness, understanding how to scale with your organization and product,\nand learning how to iterate over time.\n\n## Measuring Effectiveness\n\nYour design system is only as effective as it is useful. To make sure it is\nachieving results, you’ll have to make plans to measure your design system’s\neffectiveness objectively.\n\nBuilding out a design system is hard work. It can be easy to feel discouraged\nand wonder if your efforts are paying off. Seeing data that shows its\neffectiveness will help keep the team’s momentum going. If the data you\ncollect indicates that the system is not making the difference you\nanticipated, you can take steps to make the necessary course corrections.\n\nStakeholders will also want reassurance that your system is working. Design\nsystems can increase speed and agility for your team, reduce technical debt,\nand improve the user experience. Focus your measurement efforts on the items\nlisted in the business case you created in Chapter\n[3](468954_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml). Gather baseline data before introducing your\nsystem and check in at critical points along the way.\n\nWhen communicating with the executive team and members of management, it can\nbe helpful to frame results in terms of the cost savings and profit. How has\nyour system saved the company time and money? How has it positively affected\nthe user experience in a way that increased customer retention and sales?\n\n### Note\n\nTo learn more about making the business case for your design system, review\nChapter [3](468954_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml).\n\n### Gathering Data Through Goal-Setting\n\nEstablishing Objective and Key Results (OKRs) for your design system can be a\nhelpful way to track results. Google introduced OKRs as a tool to track\nalignment and progress toward shared, measurable goals. They consist of an\nobjective, what you want to achieve, and key results, the set of outcomes that\nsignal you have met your goal.1 Here are a few OKR examples to illustrate how\nthis can work in tracking your system’s effectiveness:\n\n  * **Objective** : Reduce UX cycle time to increase speed to market.\n\n    * **Key Result** : Define the road map for getting all “priority one” user experience components into the system (these could be core elements, such as typography, color, etc., or high-priority product features).\n\n    * **Key Result** : Publish eight finalized guidelines to the system each month.\n\n    * **Key Result** : Reduce UX review time spent on code changes by 50%.\n\n  * **Objective** : Accessibility is built into everything we do.\n\n    * **Key Result** : 100% of new components ship with accessibility standards checklist met.\n\n    * **Key Result** : By the end of three months, all existing components will be updated to meet accessibility standards.\n\n  * **Objective** : The design system is an organization-wide resource.\n\n    * **Key Result** : Increase membership of non-design team members in the design system team chat2 channel by ten members each month.\n\n    * **Key Result** : Increase design system contributions by five non-design team members each month.\n\nWhether your organization uses OKRs or some other way to measure goals, use\nthem to your advantage. There are many ways to measure and demonstrate how\nuseful your design system is for your organization and your user base. Focus\non creating measurable goals that allow you to track results related to your\nbusiness case. This can include:\n\n  * Maximized adoption within a certain time period.\n\n  * Commitment to adopt.\n\n  * Reduced development times and increased time to market.\n\n  * Reduced technical debt and bugs.\n\n  * Improved user experience.\n\n  * Increased collaboration among teams.\n\n### Gathering Data Through Surveys\n\nSurveys are another way to measure how useful your design system is for your\norganization, especially if you don’t have access to analytics or usage data.\nCreate a survey to send to your fellow colleagues that helps you understand\nthe state of your system, what you may need to change, and what can be added\nto make your system more effective and efficient.\n\nWhen creating your survey, be sure to include questions that will capture how\nmuch time is being spent on team members inquiring about styling or usage\nguidelines. Over time, these guidelines will be captured within your system,\nallowing everyone to be more autonomous. You can also ask UX designers how\nmuch time they are spending answering style or usage questions vs.\nbrainstorming solutions to problems.\n\nSend the survey when you first start the process of creating your design\nsystem, as well as after you have made significant progress. By sending out\nthe survey in regular intervals, you can measure how effective your system is\ncompared to the previously sent survey. Overall, you will see that there is\nless time spent on discussions that revolve around styling and usage as your\ndesign system becomes easier to navigate, with robust and up-to-date\nguidelines. With this information, you can keep the momentum going and\ncontinue to gain buy-in from key stakeholders.\n\n#### Survey Template\n\nBelow is a sample survey to utilize within your team. Customize the questions\nand answers to better suit your individual organization.\n\n### Team Member Survey\n\n_Which team are you a member of?_\n\n  * Front-end\n\n  * Back-end\n\n  * Product\n\n  * Marketing\n\n  * Support\n\n  * Sales\n\n  * Other\n\n_How often do you ask a UX designer or front-end engineer for help regarding\nthe styling of a component?_\n\n  * 0–1 time a cycle\n\n  * 2–4 times a cycle\n\n  * 5–7 times a cycle\n\n  * 8+ times a cycle\n\n_How often do you ask a UX designer or front-end engineer for help regarding\nthe usage of a component?_\n\n  * 0–1 time a cycle\n\n  * 2–4 times a cycle\n\n  * 5–7 times a cycle\n\n  * 8+ times a cycle\n\n_On average, how long does it take to get the assistance you need regarding\nthe usage or styling of a component?_\n\n  * I don’t have to ask for help with usage or style guidelines.\n\n  * Under an hour\n\n  * 1–3 hours\n\n  * 4–8 hours\n\n  * 1 day\n\n  * 2+ days\n\n_How often are you able to work on a UI bug or improvement without UX\nassistance or review?_\n\n  * Frequently (most problems)\n\n  * Sometimes (some problems)\n\n  * Rarely (once in a while)\n\n  * Never\n\n  * Other [text field]\n\n_How often do you visit the design system to answer a question regarding a\ncomponent?_\n\n  * Frequently (most questions)\n\n  * Sometimes (some questions)\n\n  * Rarely (very few questions)\n\n  * Never\n\n  * Other [text field]\n\n_If you do not utilize the design system as a resource, tell us why._\n\n  * It doesn’t have what I’m looking for.\n\n  * Guidelines are out of date.\n\n  * It’s difficult to navigate.\n\n  * I didn’t know there was a design system.\n\n  * Other [text field]\n\n_On average, are you able to find the information you are looking for within\nthe design system?_\n\n  * Yes\n\n  * No\n\n_What can we add to the design system that would help improve your process?_\n\n  * [Open-ended question]\n\nIt can also be useful to create a similar survey that is directed toward\nmembers of your design team. This will give you specific feedback regarding\ntheir time spent, as well as their perception of the usefulness of the design\nsystem. Remember to take one of the surveys yourself as well!\n\n### UX Member Survey\n\n_How often are you asked to help clarify the styling of a component?_\n\n  * 0–3 times a cycle\n\n  * 4–6 times a cycle\n\n  * 7–9 times a cycle\n\n  * 10+ times a cycle\n\n_How often are you asked to help clarify the usage of a component?_\n\n  * 0–3 times a cycle\n\n  * 4–6 times a cycle\n\n  * 7–9 times a cycle\n\n  * 10+ times a cycle\n\n_How much time do you spend responding to questions regarding the styling or\nusage of a component?_\n\n  * Less than 25% per week\n\n  * 26–50% per week\n\n  * 51–75% per week\n\n  * 76%+ per week\n\n_How much time do you spend responding to questions or doing reviews for new\nfeatures?_\n\n  * Less than 25% per week\n\n  * 26–50% per week\n\n  * 51–75% per week\n\n  * 76%+ per week\n\n_How much time do you spend writing documentation?_\n\n  * Less than 25% per week\n\n  * 26–50% per week\n\n  * 51–75% per week\n\n  * 76%+ per week\n\n_How much time do you spend brainstorming and creating solutions to new\nproblems?_\n\n  * Less than 25% per week\n\n  * 26–50% per week\n\n  * 51–75% per week\n\n  * 76%+ per week\n\n_How often do you reference the design system when working on design related\ntasks?_\n\n  * Frequently (most problems)\n\n  * Sometimes (some problems)\n\n  * Rarely (very few problems)\n\n  * Never\n\n  * Other [text field]\n\n_How often do you reference the design system when answering a user-experience\nrelated question?_\n\n  * Frequently (most questions)\n\n  * Sometimes (some questions)\n\n  * Rarely (very few questions)\n\n  * Never\n\n  * Other [text field]\n\n_Overall, how useful is the current design system to you in your work?_\n\n  * Very useful\n\n  * Somewhat useful\n\n  * Not very useful\n\n  * Not useful at all\n\n_What makes the design system useful or not useful to you?_\n\n  * [Open ended question]\n\nMeasuring the effectiveness of your design system will be crucial to its\nsuccess. Frame the context of your data in terms of who you are communicating\nwith. Design and development managers will care about how the design system\nhelps their teams function internally while an executive will care about time\nand money. Tell an effective story and be able to defend your business case,\nenabling you to continue on the path of building an effective design system.\n\n### Maintaining Your System in the Face of Growth\n\nAs you work on your design system, it is inevitable that your organization and\nproduct will experience change. This change comes in many forms: growth,\nreorganization, new product focus—the list goes on and on. Continuous, and\nsometimes rapid, growth presents both opportunity and risk for your design\nsystem.\n\n####  Opportunities\n\n  * The ability to work on initiatives for which you previously lacked resources.\n\n  * The capacity to create a team dedicated to the design system.\n\n  * Enriched user experiences (depth).\n\n  * The opportunity to add additional features the product is lacking (breadth).\n\n####  Risks\n\n  * Loss of culture and morale as too many people are added too fast.\n\n  * Increased UX debt as new team members fail to understand or use the design system. UX debt could also increase if UX hiring lags behind engineering or product.\n\n  * The inability to sufficiently support the design system due to time spent onboarding new team members.\n\nThere are many outside influences and factors that can affect the growth and\nprogress of your design system. Don’t allow yourself to get bogged down by\nwhat could happen. Learn to recognize the opportunities and risks and use them\nto your advantage.\n\n#### Organizational Growth\n\nOrganizations are not static; they grow and change over time. When an\norganization enters a high-growth phase, it is both exciting and stressful.\nOrganizations hire more employees when there is the opportunity to grow the\nproduct and its footprint within the market. This is a good sign that the\norganization is healthy and headed in the right direction. It also means\nonboarding new employees, adding additional managers, and making sure\nprocesses support the growth and change. To maintain and continue to grow your\ndesign system, you will have to make sure every new member becomes familiar\nwith it.\n\n**Onboard new designers properly.** Ensure that every new designer on the team\ngets proper instruction on how to use and contribute to your system.\n\n**Utilize organizational announcements to educate other departments.** It\nisn’t enough to have a design system. You will have to share, socialize, and\nevangelize it continually. Reach out to new product managers and developers.\nConduct AMAs (Ask Me Anythings) or webinars for internal employees.\n\n#### Product Growth\n\nProducts are not static, either. As the product matures, features are added\nand taken away. The visual design and user experience of the product undergo\nconstant iteration as user feedback comes in and new designers add new\ninsights. A side effect of these changes is UX debt. UX debt refers to the\ninconsistencies that accumulate and have a negative impact on user experience.\nThese can include differences between styles you have documented and those\nfound in the product, as well as misuse of components across features.\n\n##### Tackling UX Debt\n\nUX debt creeps in when the solutions and standards in your design system have\nnot yet been implemented into the product. These lingering discrepancies can\nfeel particularly painful to your team. Just like developing your design\nsystem, addressing UX debt will be a continuous process.\n\nAccounting for UX debt is important to maintaining and growing your system.\nDiscrepancies can lead to confusion and require more communication between\nengineering and design to ensure that things are being implemented correctly.\nWithout a reliable single source of truth, the speed and efficiency of the\nengineers and designers working on the product will be greatly affected.\n\n**Incremental implementation.** It is tempting to try and fix existing\nproblems all at once. This can lead to long, drawn-out debates and little to\nno progress. You may need to implement newly defined styles one feature at a\ntime. Create a road map for these changes and communicate it across the\norganization.\n\n**Consistency.** Give your designers ownership of the system and hold them\naccountable. Try and schedule a certain number of improvements for each\nsprint. These could be UX debt issues already in the product or corrections\nand additions to the design system itself.\n\n**Collaboration.** Work alongside product management and engineering to tackle\nexisting UX issues. This isn’t just a problem for the design team, this is an\norganizational problem. Understand what is most important to product\nmanagement and use that knowledge when prioritizing. Talk to engineers to\nunderstand which fixes are more difficult or complicated than others.\n\nTackling UX debt will ensure that your product can continue to scale alongside\nyour design system .\n\n#### Design System Growth\n\nGrowing pains can cause daunting challenges, but there are strategies you can\nuse to mitigate risks and take advantage of opportunities. You should think of\nyour system as another team member. It can take on duties and\nresponsibilities, freeing you up to tackle more complicated tasks. The\ncompetencies and skills of your design system should grow alongside those of\nthe organization.\n\n**Ensure a centralized location for your design system.** Make sure that\neveryone has access. It should pull its weight for the team, answering known\nquestions and allowing other teams the autonomy to work independently.\n\n**Stay focused on developing your system.** Don’t allow delivery pressures and\ntight timelines to distract you from keeping up with your design system. Your\nsystem is an organizational priority. Advocate for it when scheduling and\nprioritizing work. Make the space for your team to add to and improve its\ncontents continually.\n\n**Set up processes and a system of checks and balances.** This means a self-\ndocumenting design system with designated maintainers tasked with checking the\nwork that is added. Have documentation steps for adding to the system as well\nas reviewing additions.\n\n**Stop trying to make it perfect.** Iteration will be vital to keeping your\nsystem going. Long, drawn-out conversations about every detail in your system\nwill stop progress and exhaust the team. Get something in and continue to\nimprove it over time.\n\n## Iterating on Components and Guidelines\n\nAs your organization grows or client needs shift, there will be times when you\nmust iterate on the components and guidelines you have already created. A\nusage guideline may no longer be useful or a component may have to change\nentirely to match the needs of your changing product. Don’t paint yourself\ninto a corner; keep an open mind and allow your design system to evolve to fit\nthe ever-changing needs of your users.\n\n### Making Room for Revisions\n\nLearning to iterate can be a challenge. It is likely that you won’t be\ncompletely happy with the first iteration of your design system. As you\ncontinue to iterate, adding more guidelines often means adding more\ncomplexity. Be open to allowing your system to shift over time.\n\nAs your product grows and user needs change, so might your guidelines. It is\nokay to throw out components and begin anew. Remember that your design system\nis supposed to provide guidance for your team. If a certain guideline is not\nworking within your product anymore, it’s time to change or remove it.\n\n### Utilizing Research\n\nResearch is a powerful tool that will help you to build robust components that\nfunction well for your users. Whether you have a team of UX researchers or\nyou’re working on your own, you can create small studies that help you test\ndifferent variations of the same component. Below are a few research\ntechniques that can help you iterate and revise your components to best match\nyour users’ needs:\n\n#### A/B Testing\n\nPerforming A/B tests allows you to compare two versions of a component and\nmeasure how effective each one is. There are many tools out there to help you\neasily perform A/B tests, but you can also keep it simple by creating your own\nprototypes and testing with users one-on-one. This is a powerful tool that\nhelps you determine the most effective iteration of a component.\n\n#### Usability Testing\n\nIf you are unsure whether a certain component will solve a user need, utilize\nusability testing to get the answers. Start by creating a hypothesis and a\nlist of assumptions. Be clear about what you are hoping to accomplish with\nyour study. Then create a script that you can use when talking with users that\naddresses your hypothesis and helps answer your assumptions. Be willing to\nmake changes based on the findings within your study.\n\n#### Beta Groups\n\nWhen creating a new feature or feature set, you are likely to introduce\ncomponents into a new flow. Create a beta group to test the new flow before\nintroducing it to the majority of your users. This will also give you useful\ninformation regarding whether you need to make any adjustments to your\nguidelines.\n\n### Communicating Changes\n\nA key aspect of revising your design system is ensuring you have a process in\nplace for communicating changes. UX designers should be up to date with the\nstate of your system, as should your engineering team. Keeping your\norganization in the dark about the changes you make will only lead to\ninconsistencies and incorrectly implemented components.\n\nWhen you make a change to a usage guideline, announce the change in your next\nupcoming team meeting. Remember that when a usage guideline is changed, it may\nmean updating the implementation of that component. Check in with your\nengineering team to ensure that the change can be implemented in a timely\nmanner. If there is no capacity to make the change, be sure to document the\nissue in your issue tracker. This will ensure that the change will be made\nwhen scheduling allows. For larger changes that may affect the whole of the\norganization, be sure to have a channel in place that allows you to\ncommunicate the changes to all parties. This will vary between organizations\nbut could be a chat channel, a company call, or a team bulletin.\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nYour design system cannot be completed and then simply set aside. It will\nrequire continuous effort and constant attention to thrive. Treat your design\nsystem as you would a product. Set goals for what you would like your system\nto achieve within a specific time frame and track the results. Doing so will\nallow you to make corrections when necessary and bolster morale for the team\nas the benefits become clear.\n\nMeasuring and tracking results is vital for your stakeholders as well. Provide\ndata that shows the effectiveness of your system and how it is benefiting\ncustomer growth and retention. Make clear the value your system has for the\norganization, and you are more likely to continue receiving support in the\nform of time and resources.\n\nMaintaining your system as your organization and product grow can be daunting.\nCreate processes to address the addition of team members across the\norganization and have a plan to tackle UX debt that accumulates.\n\nAccount for the need to scale your system in parallel with your product and\norganization. Start by placing your system in a centralized location and make\nit available to everyone. Encourage all teams to contribute but reinforce\nchecks and balances. Be open to iteration and create a process for\ncommunicating changes over time. Socialize and evangelize your system within\nthe organization to maintain excitement and keep the momentum going.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\nChristina Wodtke, _Introduction to OKRs_ , (Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly Media,\nInc., 2016).\n\n2\n\nIf your organization uses a chat tool, create a channel dedicated to your\ndesign system.

A GitLab Case Study\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nThroughout this book, we have combined our collective experiences to share\nwhat we’ve learned while working on design systems throughout our careers. The\nfollowing case study is a look into our roles, challenges, and successes while\nworking together on the GitLab Design System. Our goal with this chapter is to\nprovide you with concrete experiences from which you can draw parallels while\nworking on your system.\n\n## Background\n\nGitLab began as an open source, web-based Git repository manager and quickly\ngrew into a single application for the entire DevOps life cycle. GitLab\nprovides organizations with code, project, and operations management,\nalongside security and monitoring tooling.\n\nBy 2017, GitLab, as an organization and product, was growing fast. We were\nworking on introducing new features while bringing additional designers,\nengineers, and product managers on board to handle the increase in scope and\nvolume of work. While there was existing markdown documentation in our UX\nguide, upkeep was manual and time-consuming. The use of static images meant it\nwas prone to being out of date. In addition to a lack of current usage\nguidelines, our CSS was growing without clear technical guidelines. We had\npage-specific styles that would cascade down, affecting other areas and\nproducing more interface bugs. Overall, we were lacking two crucial things:\nreusable components and clear guidelines for their use.\n\n## Problem\n\nGitLab was experiencing a growing number of stylistic issues as the product\ncontinued to increase in scope. This highlighted consistency concerns. Colors\nand fonts were not well-defined, and the way we handled components differed\nfrom page to page. We found ourselves addressing the same usability problems\nover and over. The pace of design was slowing, leaving us unable to focus on\nmuch beyond the current milestone. Rather than working closely with product\nmanagers to generate future features and strategic roadmaps, we found\nourselves in a purely transactional role.\n\nWith these problems in mind, we needed a way to do the following:\n\n  * Increase speed of design and design handoff.\n\n  * Improve consistency across GitLab.\n\n  * Make time for exploratory UX work and discovery.\n\n  * Empower the entire company to make design decisions.\n\n  * Speed up and improve the quality of onboarding.\n\n## Our Roles\n\nTo understand how we worked together to create GitLab’s design system, we\nthought it would be helpful to begin by giving an overview of our roles. While\nwe both contributed to all aspects of planning, building, and evangelizing our\nsystem, it was necessary for each of us to own a specific part of the effort.\nDoing so allowed each of us to concentrate our efforts and avoid getting\npulled in too many directions.\n\n### Sarrah\n\nSarrah’s primary role was to gain support and buy-in from stakeholders, as\nwell as remove any obstacles that stood in the department’s way. The first and\nmost crucial stakeholder was the design department itself. While we all knew\nthere was a need for a dedicated design system, there were many obstacles for\nthe design department to consider before we could begin.\n\nOur department was doing all it could to stay on top of monthly deliverables,\nand our capacity was maxed. Hiring dedicated designers to work on our system\nwas not an option, meaning we had to make time by taking on fewer deliverables\neach month. For this to happen effectively, we needed to socialize with each\nproduct manager the reasons why. Their understanding and support were vital.\n\nSarrah also ensured that the design system effort was supported by the design\ndepartment’s Object and Key Results (OKRs). This meant gaining support from\nthe CEO and VP of Engineering while making sure the department prioritized the\nefforts that supported each key result. These OKRs proved to be vital in\nensuring that the department was focused on and committed to the design\nsystem.\n\nChoosing which technology to use was also a challenge. There were varying\nopinions on which tools and technology were best-suited to the department. We\nspent a lot of time talking about what we should use. Sarrah pushed for a\ndecision and made sure that one person was driving the effort. There was no\nway she could get buy-in from the designers, product managers, engineers, and\nexecutives while also navigating the many choices that needed to be made about\ntooling. Taurie stepped up to own this responsibility, acting as a guide and\npoint of pressure on the department.\n\nWe had an existing UX guide in the company-wide GitLab handbook, the central\nlocation for all of our documentation. However, this was not the best location\nfor our design system. We knew that we needed the ability to house\ndocumentation alongside working components and CSS styles. The decision was\neasy to make on the department level, but we needed to present a strong\nargument for why it had to be a standalone resource.\n\nMuch of Sarrah’s time was spent socializing the system with the CEO, head of\nproduct, VP of Engineering, and other engineering managers. It was imperative\nthat these stakeholders understood the benefits the system would bring to\nGitLab. Having their support from the start would make it easier to gain buy-\nin from the rest of the organization. Sarrah also spent time evangelizing the\ndesign system, sharing it with GitLab as well as the larger community.\n\n### Taurie\n\nWhile Sarrah worked to gain support and remove obstacles, Taurie drove the\nimplementation of the design system. At the start, the design department had\nno formal component library to utilize, and we wanted to begin thinking about\ndesign as a scalable system. As the department and product continued to grow,\nit was apparent that we needed clear guidelines that would help direct us\ntoward making consistent design decisions.\n\nTaurie began by determining the best way to build a component library that the\ndesign department could contribute to easily. A key aspect for her was to find\nsomething that was reliable and easy to understand—a tool that would allow any\nnew designer to come in and familiarize themselves with our design language on\nday one.\n\nTaurie set up the foundation for the department to build upon, aiding\ndesigners in developing a component library that contained styles and\ncomponents used on a regular basis. With the component library in place, she\nwas able to shift her focus to building the design system. Taurie recruited\nmembers of the front-end department who showed an interest in the system and\nwere able to assist along the way. The goal at this time was the same as when\nwe began the component library: create a foundation from which the entire\ndepartment could build.\n\nThe design system began as a series of components and guidelines grouped into\nspecific categories, many of which we have covered in this book. While the\npages of our system began as placeholder to-dos, the critical thing for us was\nto create a vision that the department could run with themselves. With a\ndefined structure and information hierarchy, we were able to start writing UX\ndocumentation together. The entire design department contributed to filling in\nto-dos every month.\n\nTaurie began to work closely with Sarrah to communicate the benefits of a\ndesign system and how it would help improve productivity. It was imperative to\nget the support of the front-end engineering department in order to include\nworking components within our system. Over time, we shaped a shared vision of\nour design system that enabled both departments to work together. At this\npoint, we were able to begin building a series of repositories that integrate,\nwith the goal of feeding both our design system and the product as a single\nsource of truth.\n\n## Challenges\n\nAs with many companies setting out to build a design system, there were\nchallenges and constraints that cropped up along the way. While some were\nwithin our direct control, many were not. As each new obstacle came up, we\nwere challenged to evaluate the situation and set a course for resolution. The\nfollowing outlines the struggles we encountered, our approach to solving them,\nand the resulting outcome.\n\n### Misconceptions and Buy-In\n\nDesign systems were a new concept to a lot of team members at GitLab when we\nfirst began. We knew that we would have to educate our peers on what a design\nsystem was, as well as what it wasn’t. A common misconception we encountered\noften was that the design system would simply house usability guidelines. We\nhad to be diligent, communicating the full scope of a design system to ensure\nwe had proper support throughout the process. Gaining stakeholder buy-in would\nenable us to make further headway and align teams along a common goal.\n\n#### Our Approach\n\nWe began with our direct supervisor, discussing the advantages a design system\nwould bring to the organization. We detailed the speed and consistency\nbenefits it would afford the design department, as well as engineering.\nFortunately, it wasn’t a tough sell. Design reports directly to the VP of\nEngineering, and our supervisor understood the value a design system would\nbring to the organization as a whole.\n\nDuring this time, we reached out to the engineering managers in the front-end\ndepartment. Again, we focused on communicating the benefits this would have\nfor both engineering and design.\n\nIt took time to communicate the full scope of a design system and get everyone\non the same page. We became comfortable addressing misconceptions. We knew\nthat if context was missing, it would lead to misunderstandings about what a\ndesign system was meant to accomplish. On a consistent basis, we made an\neffort to ensure everyone understood and agreed with the primary goals a\ndesign system would solve. This also meant revisiting technical implementation\nstrategies as different people were brought into the discussion.\n\nThe next step was to gain support from the product department. At GitLab,\nproduct managers set the road map and prioritization for each milestone. If we\nwere going to make any headway on our system, we would have to take on fewer\ndeliverables each month. While speed and consistency are indeed concerns for\nproduct managers, it was difficult to make this case while intentionally\nslowing down the work they wanted to accomplish. Here, we needed to do our\nbest to align our design system efforts with the product roadmap. We\nprioritized components that tied directly into the issues that mapped to the\nproduct department’s vision and strategy. In this way, the problems we were\nalready working on could be used to drive what we were adding to the system.\n\n#### Outcome\n\nAs a shared vision developed over time, we were able to gain more buy-in. With\nthe front-end engineering department on board, we were able to dovetail our\ndesign system efforts nicely into engineering efforts to introduce Vue\ncomponents and refactor CSS. Rather than go it alone, we were able to work\ntogether, pushing for a single source of truth for the entire organization. In\naddition to working closely with engineering, we worked in parallel with\nproduct. This ensured that we were able to execute on our monthly deliverables\nwhile also writing guidelines for our newly defined components.\n\n### Resourcing\n\nFinding the people and time to start our design system was a significant\nchallenge. As a department, we were already ruthlessly prioritizing the work\nwe needed to accomplish each month. We had been working with the rest of the\ndepartment to allocate time toward documenting our existing components but\nthere wasn’t the necessary time or people to devote to the system.\nAdditionally, we faced challenges in getting working code components embedded\ninto our system as we could not control, or even influence, the front-end\nresources available to assist us.\n\n#### Our Approach\n\nAs with everything at GitLab, we started with an issue. Issues allow you to\nshare and discuss proposals before and during implementation. This was the\nfirst step toward rallying resources within the design department.\n\nThe issue description1 contained the following excerpt:\n\n> _Let’s focus on the Big picture for GitLab’s UX_ _. It is important that we\n> keep our day to day work focused on contributing to larger goals. It is easy\n> to get so heads down in our work that we lose sight of bigger things we are\n> trying to accomplish as a team and company._\n\n> _This issue intends to set UX goals that will continue to establish and\n> evolve GitLab’s UX. We already have OKRs for this quarter, and those will\n> need to be considered in determining which issues to take up and move\n> forward with. However, I think there is plenty of room for us to focus on UX\n> centric goals. Specifically, cleaning up and establishing GitLab’s unique\n> personality and voice._\n\n> _The basic ground rules are_ _:_\n\n  * _Each team member should think about an area they would want to focus on and contribute to_\n\n  * _We must be sure to support our OKRs fully_\n\n  * _We should write a blog post (or series of) stating our plan—declare our intentions to the community and company_\n\n  * _All issues we take on and create should support our plan_\n\n  * _We should establish a_ _GitLab Pages_ 2 _for UX (_ [ _design.gitlab.com_ ](http://design.gitlab.com) _)—Be visibly committed_\n\n> _The end goal is to have an established UX Foundation Guide_ _._\n\nThis issue description was the starting point for our design system. It\ncommitted us to dedicating time to work on the system at the department level.\nMaking time for the necessary work we needed to do highlighted our lack of\nresources overall. With no dedicated team, we were delivering less toward the\nproduct road map and struggling to make significant progress on our system. We\nhighlighted this as a case for hiring additional UX designers.\n\nWe used OKRs as another strategy to assemble resources. GitLab uses OKRs as a\nway to inspire and drive teams to push forward essential initiatives. We\nsought to guarantee time dedicated to our system by driving key results\nrelated to these efforts. This required support from the CEO himself, but we\nwere met with some resistance. The perception was that an OKR should be\nfocused on initiatives outside of an individual’s job responsibilities, and\nthe design system did not meet this requirement. We explained that the value\nof a design system went beyond individual job responsibilities. By leveraging\nkey results, we could ensure the system was included and prioritized with\nother initiatives. We needed a forcing function if we were going to make\nprogress. In the end, we were able to dedicate the design system as part of\nour OKRs for two quarters.\n\n#### Outcome\n\nWe unified the design department through a shared vision using a familiar way\nof working. Opening an issue allowed us to branch off, creating more issues\nand dividing up work. It encouraged the department to have more discussions\nand come together around solidified goals. In supporting our design system\nthrough the use of OKRs, we were able to ensure that designers could devote\ntime toward building the component library and documenting usage guidelines.\nDoing so set the stage for designers to get in the habit of carving out space\nfor the design system. Even after the system was no longer an OKR, designers\ncontinued to include at least one design system issue as a deliverable during\neach release cycle.\n\n###  Tooling\n\nWhen we set out to build our component library, we were already using Sketch3\nas our primary design tool at GitLab. Although we evaluated other software, it\nwas natural for us to continue using a familiar tool. However, Sketch team\nlibraries had not yet been released, and the process of selecting a tool to\nfacilitate the creation and use of a synced team library proved more difficult\nthan initially anticipated. We evaluated several tools available and\nencountered various problems, such as:\n\n  * Slow performance, as well as bugs, when adding, changing, and renaming components.\n\n  * Limited Sketch capabilities, such as not including override options when adding symbols4 to a new document.\n\n  * Frustrating bugs, such as text styles that weren’t saved or included within symbols.\n\n#### Our Approach\n\nWe knew that if we continued to evaluate every tool available, we would never\nmake progress on our component library. To solve the issue of managing shared\nassets, we assessed the top tools that were available at the time and decided\nto move forward with Brand.ai. This Sketch plugin solved many of the technical\nissues we were running into with other tools, but no tool is perfect:\n\n  * Our complex product benefited from various levels of nesting, and Brand.ai limited the organization of components to only one level deep.\n\n  * While faster and less buggy than other plugins, Brand.ai was slow and becoming slower as more components were added.\n\nThe department has since moved away from using Brand.ai and switched to native\nSketch libraries. We made this change only after making sure it would improve\nour workflow and not set us back in terms of build out. Ultimately, it was\nclear to the department that the new Sketch feature would improve our overall\nworkflow and ensure that we could iterate faster toward a more complete\ncomponent library.\n\n#### Outcome\n\nBy being flexible with tooling, the department was able to focus on building\nrobust and reusable components. We only switched tools when it made sense for\nthe team and would not hinder our progress. This meant that we could define\nguidelines for our components and build them out with more speed, ensuring\nthat we met our OKRs and maintained our stakeholders’ buy-in.\n\n### Structure and Setup\n\nWhen we first began work on the design system, we struggled with how it would\nbe structured from a technical perspective. We knew that everything would have\nto be integrated, but we had to work within the various resourcing constraints\nto make that happen. With limited front-end resources, this meant getting\nstarted with whatever project setup we could. We knew we would have to figure\nout how our working components would be integrated into the system, as well as\nthe actual product, at a later date.\n\n#### Our Approach\n\nIn the early stages, we sought out members of the front-end department to help\nus determine how to structure the system from a technical perspective. As a\nfully remote company, GitLab is distributed globally across more than 40\ncountries. We took advantage of one of our annual work summits, where we\ngathered in person for a week, to meet with two front-end engineers who showed\ninterest in helping start the design system. Getting their input and\nassistance at this very early stage enabled us to make headway on building an\noutward-facing design system. They proved to be valuable allies after we\nreturned home by answering questions and assisting with technical\nimplementation going forward.\n\nOne of our strengths throughout this project was the ability to iterate toward\na robust design system. Iteration encouraged members of various departments to\nget involved throughout the process. We didn’t keep the design system locked\naway until it was ready for a successful launch. Instead, we shipped a blank\ncanvas with an extensive list of placeholder to-dos, shown in Figure 7-1, that\ncould be filled in over time by various team members. The addition of a\ncomponent status page informed users, at a glance, which components were ready\nand which still needed documentation.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg](../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nFigure 7-1\n\nBy creating blank pages with to-dos, team members could quickly see which\nareas still required documentation\n\n#### Outcome\n\nRecognizing peers who are interested in helping you build your system is\ninvaluable. Dedicating time to talk with members of the front-end team allowed\nus to propel our design system forward. Even though we didn’t have the ability\nto add engineering resources, we had formed allies whom we could ask for help\nalong the way.\n\nWith a shared vision of the design system among departments, we filled in the\nblank slate we’d created with the help of our front-end allies. We made steady\nprogress each month, by scheduling components at three distinct levels:\n\n  * Documenting usage guidelines.\n\n  * Wrapping existing components and writing styles.\n\n  * Implementing new components within the product.\n\nHaving these three levels in place allowed designers and engineers to work on\nthe design system in tandem.\n\n### Component Redundancy: Buttons, Badges, Labels, Tags, Oh My!\n\nGitLab is a complex product with many features that span the entire DevOps\nlife cycle. There is an abundance of components to organize, document, and\nimplement within a product so involved. Working on the design system forced\nthe department to sit down and define specifics for each component. We\nrealized we had many visually similar interface elements being used in varying\ncontexts.\n\nAn excellent example of this was our use of buttons, badges, labels, and tags,\nas shown in Figure 7-2. Although some were informational, interactive, or\nboth, they were using virtually the same styling without clearly defined usage\nguidelines. It wasn’t clear when to use one vs. another.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 7-2\n\nVisually similar components that lacked clear usage guidelines\n\n#### Our Approach\n\nSitting down to define each component meant that we had to recognize the\nsimilarities, identify the differences, combine duplicates, and establish\nusage guidelines. As illustrated in Figure 7-3, we ultimately were able to\nreduce the number of components, simplifying when and where to use each one.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig3_HTML.png](../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig3_HTML.png)\n\nFigure 7-3\n\nAfter determining clear usage guidelines, we were able to reduce the number of\ntotal components while also giving each one a visually unique style\n\nTo arrive at this outcome, one designer took ownership of determining a\nsolution to the problem we had identified. We then followed a standard code\nreview process.5 This review process ensures that any changes made are\nreviewed before they are introduced into the product. We adopted this process\nof checks and balances, tasking designers with reviewing all changes that were\nmade to both the component library and the design system.\n\nIn addition to having reviewers, we also had a set of maintainers. While\neveryone is encouraged to help review changes, only maintainers are able to\naccept changes to the design system. Maintainers are subject matter experts\nand know the codebase extremely well, enabling them to spot inconsistencies or\nproblems that could be easily missed by others.\n\n#### Outcome\n\nWith reviewers and maintainers in place, we created a robust process that is\nless likely to introduce bugs or inconsistencies to our design system. This\nminimized mistakes and broadened the scope of knowledge across the\norganization by getting more eyes on changes early. It allowed us to work\ncollaboratively toward the best solution, providing feedback along the way.\n\n### Communicating Value\n\nFor a long time, the work of the design department at GitLab went largely\nunder the radar, both internally and externally. That isn’t to say that our\npeers at GitLab did not value and appreciate our work. They did, and do.\nHowever, the bulk of our work and accomplishments were a part of the whole, in\nwhich product managers presented designs and solutions in the monthly kickoff\ncall. We often faced criticism, largely for being transactional in our work\nrather than focusing on thinking strategically and generating ideas for the\nproduct. All of this took a toll on the morale of the team, and it was\nsomething we needed to change.\n\nAfter working on the design system for nearly a year, the design department\nfelt good about the progress we had made. Everything in the original UX guide\nwas moved from the handbook over to our dedicated site, [ design.gitlab.com\n](http://design.gitlab.com). We documented many new components while old\ncomponents were being revisited and updated. As a department, the design\nsystem was our single source of truth for information on components and how to\nuse them. We had written blog posts about the design system that garnered\nattention from the broader UX community, and we were seeing applicants citing\nit as a reason for applying. Designers had more time to dedicate to generating\nideas and working toward the product road map. While we were still waiting for\nthe capacity required to implement working code components, we felt that our\nefforts had paid off.\n\nHowever, in a conversation with one executive, we received feedback that the\nsystem was a failure. This opinion was formed because, from their perspective,\nnobody was using it. You can imagine our surprise and disappointment when we\nheard this. The design department was using the system on a daily basis as\npart of our work, and the front-end department was just beginning to add the\ncorresponding code components. How could this perception be so different from\nours?\n\n#### Our Approach\n\nWe quickly realized that, while the system was a daily part of our lives, we\nhad not yet made it part of the daily lives of the organization as a whole. In\nthis regard, we had failed. We immediately set about correcting this. First,\nwe added announcements about the design system in the company call, weekly\nengineering newsletter, and product management meetings. Next, we ensured that\nreviewing the design system was part of onboarding for all front-end engineers\nand product managers. We added a dedicated company chat channel for our design\nsystem and shared it with the entire organization. Finally, we created buzz\nand excitement by branding the system with its own name and styling. All of\nthese efforts helped us to communicate the worth of the system to the entire\ncompany, ultimately broadening its audience.\n\n#### Outcome\n\nThe design system needed championing to be successful. We needed to engage in\nactivities that highlighted our work, our struggles, and our successes. We\ntalked about it in company calls, slack channels, in blog posts, and in a\nwebinar dedicated to showcasing how we work together remotely. We added our\ndesign system additions to our kickoff call, highlighting our efforts and\ncontributions.\n\nThese efforts paid off. We saw an increase in overall engagement from other\ndepartments within GitLab. We also saw an increase in engagement with the\nbroader UX community. Designers around the world were sharing our posts,\nproviding feedback, and applying to our open remote positions.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nThroughout the process of implementing a design system at GitLab, we learned\nmany valuable lessons. For example, remember that reiterating goals often\nensures that teams are working toward a shared vision. Align your efforts with\nthe goals that other teams have set out to accomplish. This allows both of you\nto make progress, guaranteeing your efforts won’t be sidelined. We also\nlearned that utilizing your company’s way of measuring initiatives can be\nextremely effective in ensuring that your department has the necessary time to\ndevote to your objective.\n\nWe learned that gathering allies is very beneficial, especially when resources\nare tight or nonexistent. Working iteratively will ensure that you can set a\nfoundation from which to build over time, getting help along the way when\nneeded.\n\nThroughout this process, we came to understand that tools are continually\ntransforming and that frequently changing them will slow progress. We learned\nto evaluate tools carefully and decide what is best for the team at the\ncurrent moment. Remember that component libraries and design tools are only\none aspect that helps you arrive at a design system.\n\nCreating a series of checks and balances ensures your work is being reviewed\nby colleagues. This strengthens the overall output and ensures that you are\nconsidering all use cases when documenting new guidelines or creating new\ncomponents.\n\nLast, we learned that celebrating the successes, no matter how small they may\nseem, is vital to keeping the momentum going. Even as we faced a variety of\nchallenges, we were able to make progress in critical areas. Recognize and\nshare the successes throughout your organization and you’ll be prepared to\novercome the next obstacle that comes your way.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe can’t say it enough: building your design system is a continual process.\nWhile many of our original goals and objectives have been met, the effort to\nscale and adapt the system to meet the changing needs of GitLab continues.\nAfter the progress made over the first year and a half of building GitLab’s\nsystem, we were left with some additional initiatives. This included ensuring\nthat the system was the primary location for not only product guidelines but\nall things related to marketing as well. We also wanted to move designers away\nfrom their reliance on design software by utilizing the design system as a\nmeans of working more closely with production code.\n\n### Marketing\n\nMarketing guidelines were not an original aspect of our design system. At\nGitLab, the design department is separate from the designers working on the\ninformational website and marketing materials. While we remain in close\nproximity, our day-to-day work is very different. As GitLab grows and expands,\nit is critical to maintain a consistent brand experience across the product\nand marketing material. We established the information architecture to support\nbranding and product guidelines, as seen in Figure 7-4. Our end goal is to\nwork with the marketing design team to move all of the marketing documentation\nover to the design system in an effort to create one cohesive experience.\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig4_HTML.jpg](../images/468954_1_En_7_Chapter/468954_1_En_7_Fig4_HTML.jpg)\n\nFigure 7-4\n\nGuidelines are broken down into brand and product sections\n\n### Less Reliance on Design Tools\n\nOne of our original goals was to enable our design department to think in\nterms of systems. What we ship to production is what our users will see, not\nthe mocks and prototypes we create in various design tools. Relying on these\nprograms to translate user flows separates designers from the actual user\nexperience. Design systems empower members of various departments to work more\nclosely to the shipped product and, in turn, the users of that product.\n\nWe began this journey by creating a component library within Sketch. However,\nthat was just one step in a series of steps that led us to the design system\nwe have today. As we continue to build our design system, the ultimate goal is\nto iterate away from relying on design tools and empower designers to work\nmore closely with the production code. Iterating toward this workflow will\nenable designers to easily prototype in the browser, using cleanly documented,\nreusable components that will be directly used within the end-user\nenvironment.\n\n## Tying It All Together\n\nSignificant progress was made on GitLab’s design system over the span of a\nyear and a half. There was still work to be done, but the benefits of our\nsystem were felt across the organization, even in the early stages. We saw the\ndesign system begin to accomplish the goals we were aiming to achieve at the\nvery beginning of this process.\n\n**Increased speed of design and design handoff**. Although the effort is\nongoing, we saw an increase in efficiency related to delivering designs to the\nengineering department. Designers are able to consult guidelines in the design\nphase and link to them when handing them off to an engineer.\n\n**Improved consistency across GitLab**. We documented style and usage\nguidelines in order to improve consistency throughout the product. This\nallowed us to align elements and components, such as colors, fonts, dropdowns,\nand forms. Problem areas that still existed were identified and placed on the\nroad map for future improvements.\n\n**More time for exploratory UX work and discovery**. While this was a\nchallenging goal to accomplish, we saw improvements. Having standardized\nguidelines gave the department breathing room to think less about designing UI\nelements and focus more time on strategic thinking and problem solving.\n\n**Empowers the entire company to make design decisions**. The design system\nhas been shared and promoted to the whole organization. Product managers and\nengineers use it to guide them in making suggestions for user experience\nimprovements. They don’t have to wait for a designer to become available, they\ncan propose a solution themselves, using the system as a guide.\n\n**Increased speed and quality of onboarding**. The design system has been\nadded to the list of onboarding resources for product managers, designers, and\nfront-end engineers. It has aided new team members in familiarizing themselves\nwith the product and our vision for building it.\n\nIterating toward a robust design system allowed us to make headway on the\ngoals we set out to achieve. As in any company, we faced a series of\nchallenges that we had to overcome along the way. While these can be\nfrustrating at times, it is important to not give up. Keep sight of your\ngoals, and your efforts will pay off.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\nSarrah Vesselov, “[META] UX Big Plan,” [ https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-\ndesign/issues/30 ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/issues/30).\n\n2\n\nPages is a feature that allows you to publish websites for your repositories\nwithin GitLab.\n\n3\n\nSketch is a vector-based design tool that allows you to create mockups and\nprototypes for user interfaces.\n\n4\n\nSymbols are a feature within Sketch that allow you to reuse the same component\nacross different files.

Design Systems As a Resource\n\nSarrah Vesselov1 and  Taurie Davis 2\n\n(1)\n\nDade City, FL, USA\n\n(2)\n\nPortland, OR, USA\n\nStarting your own design system can be overwhelming. While we’ve provided you\nwith everything you need to start working, it can be helpful to look at\nexisting systems for inspiration. Public-facing and open source design systems\nprovide a window into how different organizations categorize and structure\ntheir systems. In this chapter, we will cover the common similarities and\ndifferences you can expect to encounter among popular design systems when\nresearching for your own.\n\n## The Role of Open Source\n\nThe term _open source_ refers to publicly available technology that is often\nfree to use and modify. The goal of open source software is to encourage and\nmaintain free-flowing ideas, unhindered by proprietary business interests.\nOpen source projects are developed and curated by those with a deep interest\nin the software, as well as the problem that software seeks to solve. This\ninterest helps contribute to higher quality, as the goals revolve around the\nsoftware itself, rather than potential monetary gain.\n\nOpen source software (OSS) also helped contribute to the open design movement.\nWhile open design often refers to physical products, the principles remain the\nsame as OSS. Primarily, this involves publicly sharing design information\nrelated to the development of your product and allowing anyone to use and\nalter it freely.1\n\nThese trends have encouraged companies to be more open with their design\nlanguage. Many organizations have even created and open-sourced their design\nsystems as a way of disseminating information more efficiently. It has allowed\norganizations to get direct feedback and contributions from users, as well as\ndesigners and engineers working with their system. Access to these systems has\nprovided an easy way to learn the reasoning behind decisions made, enabling\ndesigners to improve the user experience while collaborating more effectively\nwith engineers.\n\nGoogle’s Material Design debuted in 2014 and was backed by open source code.\nIt provided stronger dialogue and improved collaboration among designers and\ndevelopers, as each group had insight into the function as well as the form of\nthe product.\n\nThroughout this chapter, we will use publicly available design systems as a\nway of researching common similarities and differences. Use these as an\nadditional way to understand what is essential to include in your system, but\nremember that every organization is unique and will have different needs and\ngoals.\n\n## Researching Other Systems\n\nLooking at how other organizations tackle their design systems is helpful when\nstarting your own. It is also often overwhelming. We found that there are many\ndesign systems out there, all with their own way of categorizing, organizing,\nand conveying their design language. It is challenging to know which method\nmakes the most sense for your system.\n\nRather than look at other systems as a prescription for how a design system\nshould be, look to them for insight and inspiration. You will notice many\nsimilarities and just as many differences. At first, it can be difficult to\ngrasp the reasons behind why they differ. Why does one system use _voice and\ntone_ while others use _writing style_? Why do some systems break things down\ninto elements and components while others don’t? Much of the differences come\ndown to what we have focused on throughout this book: the size of the\norganization, the type of product it builds, organizational needs, and user\ngoals. Study these systems as an additional way of understanding what makes\nthe most sense for your organization.\n\nIt is important to remember that these systems, like all, are in constant\nevolution. By the time you are reading this, they have likely undergone\nadditional tweaks and changes.\n\n### Commonalities\n\nNearly every system contains the essentials: typography, grid, color,\ncomponents, etc. Some include general guidelines for components with more\nspecific usage guidelines for each component group. This is necessary because\nspecific rules come out of combined groups that do not exist for the\nindividual components. Many also include working code examples, along with\ntechnical guidelines.\n\nIt is common for design systems to include particular guidelines to describe\nand prescribe personality, voice, and tone. These typically consist of a word\nor short phrase, such as “Playful” or “Optimistic,” followed by a few guiding\nsentences that set the tone for the brand.\n\nMost systems do not include a section specific to marketing. Atlassian and\nGitLab are the only organizations that have a separate section dedicated to\nmarketing guidelines within their systems. Including marketing in your design\nsystem can strengthen the alignment between the user experience of the product\nand how that product is branded and marketed to users.\n\nSome systems supply users and possible contributors with access to resources\nsuch as code repositories, design files, and icon sets. They often include\nuser-friendly public-facing sites focused on both design and development.\nThese sites help foster design thinking within your organization.\n\n### Differences\n\nWe saw a distinct difference between design systems in how they choose to\nbuild and mix elements. Some systems, such as Google’s Material Design, use\ndesign standards similar to those of Atomic design.2 Atomic design is defined\nby breaking interfaces down into basic building blocks and working up from\nthere. Every piece of the interface must be defined.\n\nOther systems, such as Airbnb’s Design Language System (DLS) and IBM take a\ndifferent approach. They don’t break components down into atoms, because they\nbelieve this allows too many permutations. Instead, they define individual\ncomponents that work together within an ecosystem.3 For Airbnb, this maintains\ntheir brand, even as they make adjustments for the many different cultures and\nlanguages they support. At IBM, this approach helps them remain consistent\nacross their platforms. The differences can be subtle. This is how Airbnb’s\ndesign team describes the differences:\n\n> _Instead of relying on individual atoms (or atomic design), we started\n> considering our components as elements of a living organism. They have a\n> function and personality, are defined by a set of properties, can co-exist\n> with others and can evolve (or die) independently. This is one of the key\n> points about the system compared to more atomic ones—we don’t have\n> complicated networks of interconnected parts and components._\n>\n> —Karri Saarinen4\n\nFurther differences arise in how organizations choose to categorize and\nstructure their systems. A few begin with guiding principles, working\nprogressively toward elements and components.\n\nAtlassian and GitLab split their systems into marketing and product sections\nbefore listing guiding principles, elements, and components. Mailchimp does\nnot include any guiding principles.\n\nThere is a variety of terminology used by different systems. Some use the\nterms _patterns_ and _components_. However, in Shopify’s system, the pattern\nsection includes guidelines for layout, error messages, and mobile patterns,\nwhile their components section is dedicated to reusable interface elements.\nMailchimp’s system combines patterns and components under the general term\n_patterns_ , providing guidelines and code snippets together. GitLab makes a\ndistinction between components and regions, with regions representing\noverarching design paradigms such as the navigation. Other organizations refer\nto these paradigms as patterns. Most systems include guidelines for\noverarching paradigms, but the naming often varies. While the terminology\ndiffers, the contents remain similar and often overlap.\n\nTable 8-1 provides an overview of some of the more well-known design systems.\nIt illustrates, at a high level, the commonalities and differences you will\nencounter. The structure and terminology can differ wildly from system to\nsystem. We suggest that when researching other systems, don’t become\noverwhelmed by nomenclature. When you feel lost, review this book as a guide.\nRemember to remain focused on the needs of your organization and be consistent\nin how you apply terminology within your system.\n\nTable 8-1\n\nOverview of the Contents Within Some of the More Popular Design Systems\n\n![../images/468954_1_En_8_Chapter/468954_1_En_8_Figa_HTML.jpg](../images/468954_1_En_8_Chapter/468954_1_En_8_Figa_HTML.jpg)  \n---  \n  \n## Tying It All Together\n\nThe systems we’ve outlined all contain key aspects that help drive their\nindividual design languages. What works for them won’t necessarily be a good\nfit for your organization. Use these design systems, along with this book, as\na reference and inspiration for when you feel lost or unsure of which\ndirection to go in.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1\n\n[AdCiv.​org](http://adciv.org), “Open collaborative design,” [\nhttp://www.adciv.org/Open_collaborative_design\n](http://www.adciv.org/Open_collaborative_design), last updated July 29, 2010.\n\n2\n\nBrad Frost, “Atomic Design,” [ http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/\n](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/).\n\n3\n\nKarri Saarinen, “Building a Visual Language,” [\nhttps://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/\n](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/).\n\n4\n\nKarri Saarinen, “Airbnb—Design Language System,” [\nhttps://karrisaarinen.com/dls/ ](https://karrisaarinen.com/dls/).\n\n\n### Index\n\n### A\n\nA/B testing\n\nAccessibility\n\nVoluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)\n\nAgile methodology\n\nAssessing organization\n\norganization age\n\nstakeholder buy-in\n\nteam size\n\nvolume and work type\n\n### B\n\nBauhaus design movement\n\nBeta group\n\n### C\n\nCard-sorting\n\nCode review\n\nCommunication strategies\n\ndiplomacy\n\neducation\n\ngood PR\n\nsalesmanship\n\nComponent\n\nbuilding\n\ngroups\n\nlibrary\n\nContent\n\nCSS\n\n### D\n\nData gathering\n\ngoal setting\n\nsurvey\n\nsurvey template\n\nUX team survey\n\nDesigner Persona, _see_ Personas\n\nDesign language\n\nattributes\n\ndesign principles\n\nDesign Language System (DLS)\n\nDesign principles\n\ndefinition\n\npractical guide\n\nDesign system\n\ncommunication strategies\n\nvalue, dimension,\n\n( _see also_ Value, dimension of)\n\nworksheet\n\nDesign system failures\n\nDesign tools\n\nDocumentation\n\nautomate\n\nplaceholder to-do\n\nsearchability\n\nDon’t repeat yourself (DRY)\n\n### E\n\nElements\n\nEngineer Persona, _see_ Personas\n\nEvolution, critical factors\n\n### F\n\nFigma\n\nFlash\n\n### G\n\nGitLab\n\nGitLab, case study\n\nchallenges\n\ncommunicating value\n\ncomponent redundancy\n\nmisconception\n\npeople\n\nstructure\n\ntooling\n\nchecks and balances\n\nmaintainers\n\nmarketing guidelines,\n\n( _see also_ Marketing guidelines)\n\nOKRs\n\nscheduling components\n\ntool choice\n\nGrammar\n\ncontextual rules\n\ndefinition\n\nguidelines\n\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\n\nGraphic designers\n\nGrowth\n\ndesign system\n\ncentralized location\n\nchecks and balances\n\nopportunities\n\nproduct growth\n\nUX debt\n\nrisks\n\n### H\n\nHTML\n\nHTML5\n\nHTML specification\n\n### I\n\nImplementation tools\n\nImplemention\n\nincremental\n\nsingle source of truth\n\n( _see also_ GitLab, case study)\n\nInformation architecture\n\nInterface inventory\n\nInternet\n\n### J, K\n\nJavaScript\n\n### L\n\nLayout\n\nbaseline grid\n\ncolor system\n\ngrid\n\nspacing\n\ntypography\n\nLexicon\n\nbreaking down elements\n\nbuilding up elements\n\ndefinition\n\n### M\n\nMaintenance, system\n\nSee alsoGrowth\n\nMarketing guidelines\n\nMarketing Persona, _see_ Personas\n\nMeasuring effectiveness\n\ngathering data\n\n( _see also_ Data gathering)\n\norganizational growth\n\nproduct growth\n\nresearch utilization\n\nMicrosoft’s Internet Explorer\n\n### N\n\nNetscape\n\n### O\n\nObjective and Key Results (OKRs)\n\nOpen source software (OSS)\n\n### P, Q\n\nPerfectionism\n\nPersonas\n\ndesigner\n\nengineer\n\nmarketing\n\nproduct\n\nsales\n\nProduct Persona, _see_ Personas\n\nPublic Relations (PR)\n\n### R\n\nRegions\n\nnavigation\n\nResearching systems\n\ncommonalities\n\ncomparison table\n\ndesign system envy\n\ndifferences\n\n### S\n\nSales Persona, _see_ Personas\n\nSketch\n\nStyle guides\n\nStyles\n\ncolor\n\niconography\n\ntypography\n\nSwiss design movement\n\n### T\n\nTable-Based Design\n\nTechnological advancements\n\nCSS and JavaScript\n\nTypography\n\n### U\n\nUsability\n\naccessibility\n\ninternationalization\n\nUsability testing\n\nUX debt\n\nUX designers\n\npersona\n\n### V\n\nValue, dimension of\n\nemployee level\n\ndesigners\n\nengineers\n\nmarketing department\n\nproduct managers\n\nsales department\n\norganizational level\n\ncost and agility\n\nROI\n\nuser level\n\n### W, X, Y, Z\n\nWaterfall process\n\nWeb designers\n\nWebsites\n\nComponent-based approach\n\nPage-based design\n\nWorld Wide Web Consortium (W3C)\n\n",

If you think digital product work\ncan be more collaborative, this book is for you. If you think work can be more\nfun if you could somehow eliminate the boring stuff, this book is for you.\n\nThis is a book about process. It’s about the counterintuitive process of\ncreating design systems in a way that makes it easier to get traction and\ninvestment. It’s about the new process that designers, engineers, product\nmanagers can adopt with a design system at their disposal. It’s about the\nworthy process of getting teams to contribute to your design system so that it\ngets better for everyone. It’s ultimately about connecting your design system\ndirectly to the crucial process that creates value for your organization’s\ncustomers, users, and constituents.\n\nDesign systems can do all of that, if you know how. This book contains\nconcepts and theory that give design systems context, as well as examples of\nhow you can practice design systems successfully and stories for how others\nhave done it too. This book will help you think about design systems in a\ndifferent way than you may have before.\n\nEven though there’s a chapter called “Design System Fundamentals,” this isn’t\na “nuts and bolts” book. You’ll only find a handful of definitions and\nfoundational discussions here, as many other people and texts have previously\ncovered that in great detail. This book isn’t a “how-to” book. Even though\nthere are code examples, this book isn’t a collection of design system\ntutorials. This book spends most of its pages on the guidance and\nrelationships needed to create, use, and maintain design systems successfully\nat large organizations.\n\n## What’s in This Book?\n\n[Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml): “Why Design Systems” makes the case for why a\ndesign system is a worthwhile undertaking for most organizations managing two\nor more digital products.\n\nMany teams don’t know the difference between design systems, component\nlibraries, and UI kits. [Chapter 2](chapter2.xhtml): “Design System\nFundamentals” lays out some important distinctions about why design systems\nare so tricky to define.\n\n[Chapter 3](chapter3.xhtml): “The Parts of a Design System Product” breaks\ndown the ecosystem around a design system to understand the context in which a\ndesign system must succeed.\n\n[Chapter 4](chapter4.xhtml): “The Broken Business of Buy-In” deconstructs the\nstandard wisdom of how design systems are sold to understand why it almost\nnever works—and what’s a better way instead.\n\n[Chapter 5](chapter5.xhtml): “Pilots—The Best Way to Start and Sustain a\nDesign System” walks through a counterintuitive process for successfully\ncreating a new design system that proposes a low-friction path to automatic\ncontribution.\n\n[Chapter 6](chapter6.xhtml): “Governance and Contribution” goes over the who,\nwhat, where, when, and why of design systems to establish a simple, repeatable\nprocess.\n\n[Chapter 7](chapter7.xhtml): “Roles and Responsibilities” and [Chapter\n8](chapter8.xhtml): “Process and Workflow for Design Systems” discuss the\npeople involved in connected design system work, where they fit, and useful\nworkflows for how they can best collaborate.\n\n[Chapter 9](chapter9.xhtml): “Success Metrics for a Design System” covers both\ngeneral and organization-specific metrics of success for design systems to\nhit.\n\n[Chapter 10](chapter10.xhtml): “Evangelism Never Stops” discusses the oft-\nneglected task of marketing a design system to the people who need to use it:\ninternal designers, engineers, and product managers.\n\nThe Conclusion rounds out the book by reminding us why any of this design\nsystem stuff matters in the first place.\n\n## What Comes with This Book?\n\nThis book’s companion website ([rosenfeldmedia.com/books/design-that-\nscales](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/design-that-scales)) contains a blog\nand additional content. The book’s diagrams and other illustrations are\navailable under a Creative Commons license (when possible) for you to download\nand include in your own presentations.

In this book, I talk primarily about design systems as an\norganizational practice. [Chapter 2](chapter2.xhtml), “Design System\nFundamentals,” explores each of these kinds of design systems in more detail.\n\n## Why are design systems important?\n\nAbout five billion people use the internet each day, and the average person\nspends over six hours online daily. Designing websites, apps, and digital\ncontent at scale is imperative for keeping up with the ever-increasing demand\nfor information and services online. Understanding design systems and how to\nwork with them is already a job prerequisite for digital designers, engineers,\nand product folks at many organizations, and that trend continues to increase.\n\n## Aren’t design systems just for designers?\n\nAbsolutely not! Design systems are exciting because they are one of the few\ntools that equally serve the proverbial three-legged stool of design,\nengineering, and product. [Chapter 7](chapter7.xhtml), “Roles and\nResponsibilities,” describes all the roles and responsibilities that can exist\non a design system team.\n\n## Will this book teach me how to make a design system?\n\nYes and no. If you’re looking for detailed how-to for setting up UI kits in\ndesign tools like Figma or prop settings in languages like React or Angular,\nthere are many online articles and courses that do a better job of that. I\nchose not to cover those kinds of topics in this book because that’s not\nusually where most design systems fail. Most design systems fail because they\naren’t integrated early enough into the grain of how an organization operates,\nso this book focuses mostly on how to do just that.\n\n## I’ve made design systems before in just a few days. Does this topic really\nwarrant a whole book?\n\nIt’s true that a skilled practitioner can create design system artifacts like\nFigma UI kits and code libraries very quickly. However, a design system\npractice takes time to establish. It’s not that the tasks take long; it’s that\ndesign systems practices are exercises in cultural change, and change takes\ntime to permeate through an organization in a way that sticks. [Chapter\n6](chapter6.xhtml), “Governance and Contribution,” explains the who, what,\nwhere, when, and why design systems take time—time that’s well spent.\n\n## Will this book recommend tools that make design system work easier?\n\nIt’s an exciting time in design system tooling because new applications, plug-\nins, and software are coming out every day! While there are a handful of tools\nmentioned throughout the book, the tools are too new and change too often for\nme to call out any as having stood the test of time.\n\n\n# CONTENTS\n\n  1.

When you hear the name\nJohn Maeda, the intersection of design and technology comes to mind. And most\nimportantly, when you hear the name Dan Mall, you think of design systems.\n\nCongratulations! If you are reading this foreword, it means that you have just\nbought a book that is not only going to help you, but also the people around\nyou. If you are simply browsing this book and wondering “Should I buy this\nbook?” I’m here to tell you that the answer is “YES! Absolutely YES!”\n\nDan Mall is fundamentally the most experienced person on the planet to talk\nabout design systems. His experience reaches far and wide, and this book is\ngoing to give you all the tools you need to create and maintain a design\nsystem. Not just a design system that will work right now, but a sustainable\ndesign system. One that designers, engineers, and others will thank you for\nbuilding for years to come.\n\nThis book will help you flip the apprehensive mindset that design systems are\nused to stifle innovation into a mindset that shows designers and engineers\nthey have more freedom than ever.\n\nI met Dan several years back at a design conference. We were sitting next to\neach other at a dinner we were both attending, and the two of us “nerded” out\nfor quite some time about the role of design operations and design systems on\ndesign teams. Everything we were talking about made sense. We just needed to\ntell the world how to leverage these skill sets. We wanted to make happier and\nmore successful teams. This is your chance to hear from the maestro himself.\n\nNow stop reading my foreword and let’s get reading.\n\n> —Meredith BlackFounder, DesignOps Assembly\n\n\n# INTRODUCTION\n\n## Design Systems: An Advantage for Designing at Scale\n\nI’m fortunate to have worked and consulted with people at hundreds of\norganizations on their design systems. Most of them do it wrong.\n\nThe story usually goes like this.\n\nAfter spending weeks, months, and even years designing and building the same\ninterface elements over and over, a small faction gets wise and decides that\ncreating a handful of reusable, common solutions will help everyone get out of\nthe grind of reinventing the wheel every time. They design and code interface\nbuilding blocks like form elements, tables, headers, footers, buttons … the\nelements they think everyone uses or could use.\n\nThey start to use this new library themselves, and it works! They’re finishing\ntheir work faster, and they’re even seeing an added bonus of more consistency\nacross the work.\n\nNot ones to be selfish, they think others would benefit from this new library,\ntoo, so they share it with other teams within the company. And then …\n\nCrickets.\n\nThey hear nothing back for a while. Once they finally do, the responses are\nboth unexpected and undesirable.\n\n“We tried using it, but there were a few elements missing.”\n\n“We weren’t really sure how to use it because there wasn’t much\ndocumentation.”\n\n“We don’t have time to learn a new library right now.”\n\nDiscouraged, the team decides that they _could_ address these legitimate\nobjections that teams raised, but doing so would take them away from their\nmain work, and they can’t afford to do that right now. Their library sits\nthere, lonely and unused.\n\nUnbeknownst to this team, another team elsewhere in the organization just went\nthrough the same exercise with the same result. To make things worse, neither\nof these teams knew that the other team was also working on this, that a few\nmore teams in this organization did the same thing last year, and that others\ndid it the year before that. Only a handful of people who have been with the\ncompany for a few years know about all of these false starts.\n\nI call these collections of failed attempts _design system ghost towns_ and\n_design system graveyards_. Almost every organization has them. They’re always\nwell-intentioned. Teams do what seems sensible and intuitive, and it rarely\nworks. Why don’t they work?\n\nMost teams approach creating a design system as a project first. They’re\nunprepared for the reality that design system adoption is dependent on\nchanging organizational culture—namely, getting everyone to think and work\ndifferently than they’re used to. Most design system efforts start with a\nbattle against the status quo. Modern digital organizations typically\nstructure teams and work in silos; it’s supposedly more efficient that way.\nDesign system work quickly bumps into the edges of those silos, and successful\ndesign systems break through them, often prompting reorganization. The naïve\ndesigner or engineer, who thought a few simple tools could help everyone\nquickly, finds themself ill-equipped to address the barrage of concerns that\ndesign systems inevitably surface.\n\nQuickly, a _design system as a project_ that somehow thrives will evolve into\na _design system as a product_ by necessity. Like any good product, it needs\ninvestment, a dedicated team, a roadmap, marketing, and—most importantly—loyal\ncustomers and users.\n\nTeams that run design system products eventually realize that they need more.\nDesign systems are most needed at large enterprises that manage many digital\nproducts. Design systems require people with different skills to work\ntogether, and that’s often unusual and foreign for many organizational\ncultures. The process of making digital products nowadays needs people who can\nunderstand typographic scales, model-view-controller patterns, and customer\nacquisition costs, all at once. Design systems have the potential to bring it\nall together, but that means people using design systems need to develop new\nhabits. They need the ability to try new things, experience small wins early,\nand build momentum that adds up to larger wins over time.\n\nOverall, the most mature kind of design system is a practice.\n\nJust what to practice, though, is often elusive. Done well, design systems are\nfitting vehicles for efficiency, innovation, and job satisfaction. This book\nwill show you how to create and sustain a thriving design system practice so\nyou can effectively design at scale.\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 1 Why Design Systems?\n\nSystems Connect Organizations\n\nCommon Benefits of Design Systems\n\nWho Are Design Systems For?\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nThink about all the Google products you used today. Maybe you checked your\nemail using Gmail during some early part of your day. Perhaps you drove to\nyour office or to an appointment using Google Maps to help with directions.\nYou probably needed more info about something, and you looked it up on Google\nSearch, perhaps using Google Chrome. Maybe you collaborated with a colleague\non a Google Doc or Google Sheet. Maybe you watched a video on YouTube. Maybe\nyou did all of that on an Android mobile device.\n\nAs a user, you probably didn’t give much thought as to what it took on the\nGoogle end to make this kind of day possible for you. And you shouldn’t! All\nyou should care about is whether or not you’re getting the experience you want\nfrom using these applications.\n\n## Systems Connect Organizations\n\nBut what does it take for Google to deliver this holistic experience for you?\nAs of this writing, Google—technically Google’s parent company, Alphabet\nInc.—employs almost 140,000 people. Google also works with many external\npartners and agencies to help them accelerate and innovate on the digital\nproducts they create for their users. Keeping thousands of people aligned from\na design and engineering perspective requires some kind of system, a set of\nthings working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network.\nFor organizations that make digital products, one of those systems is called a\n_design system_. Here’s my definition:\n\nA design system is a connected, package-managed, version-controlled software\nproduct that contains the smallest set of components and guidelines a\nparticular organization needs to make digital products consistently,\nefficiently, and happily.\n\nThis is a mouthful! I’ll explore and explain each of these words and phrases\nin greater detail in [Chapters 2](chapter2.xhtml), “Design System\nFundamentals,” and [9](chapter9.xhtml), “Success Metrics for a Design System.”\n\nGoogle’s design system is called _Material Design_.1 In Google’s own words,\nMaterial Design is “an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools\nthat support the best practices of user interface design.” (See how close that\nis to my definition?) Without Material\n\nDesign, Google employees and partners would be left to design and build each\nproduct and screen and interaction and element from scratch each time,\ncreating an incredible amount of effort and unwarranted variation. Having a\nshared system like Material Design means Google designers and engineers can\nquickly reference common solutions ([Figure 1.1](chapter1.xhtml#fig1-1)) that\nare ready for implementation.\n\n![](../images/fig1-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 1.1No matter what Google application you use, the floating action\nbutton component always provides easy access to the primary action of a screen\nin the bottom-right corner.\n\nDesign systems aren’t just better for the designers, engineers, product\nmanagers, and rest of the team creating digital products. Design systems prove\nbetter for users, too, because they don’t have to relearn interaction\nconventions from application to application. A 2016 Forrester study2 found\nthat consistency in customer experience led to a 24% increase in revenue, and\ndesign systems tend to create interface consistency by their nature ([Figure\n1.2](chapter1.xhtml#fig1-2)).\n\n![](../images/fig1-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 1.2Even if you’ve only used one Google product header, you know how to\nuse them all.\n\nBut maybe you don’t use Google products.\n\nMaybe you use Microsoft products. Microsoft takes the same approach with their\nFluent Design System.3\n\nMaybe you use IBM products. IBM takes the same approach with their Carbon\nDesign System.4\n\nMaybe you use Salesforce products. Salesforce takes the same approach with\ntheir Lightning Design System.5\n\nThe list goes on and the point is clear: organizations that create and\nmaintain two or more digital products often turn to design systems to help\nthem solve the problem of digital product management at scale. If your\norganization wants to scale digital products, design systems aren’t just a\ngood idea, they’re an inevitability.\n\n## Common Benefits of Design Systems\n\nDesign system aficionados often espouse three main benefits of design systems:\n\n  * **Using a design system advocates efficiency.** Starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel each time a digital product is made is a major culprit of digital overspending. Having proven solutions at the ready helps teams address problems more quickly.\n  * **Using a design system generates consistency.** Design systems prioritize reusability across digital products, and reusability is the main ingredient in consistency.\n  * **Using a design system spawns innovation.** Moving designers and engineers from creating everything from scratch to reusing common interface and interaction remedies frees up their time to address unfamiliar problems and invent solutions for them.\n\nI also like to add a fourth:\n\n  * **Using a design system bestows relief.** Digital product teams regularly stress over unrealistic deadlines and wicked problems. Design systems give them a cheat code that gives them time and space back so they can breathe more easily.\n\nRealizing these benefits is easier said than done. Many successful design\nsystem initiatives instigate cultural and organizational transformation, and\nunsuccessful attempts frequently die due to organizational politics. An\ningrained and lasting design system practice is necessary to bring about these\nbenefits.\n\n## Who Are Design Systems For?\n\nAnyone who works on a digital product team can benefit from a design system.\nWhile this book focuses primarily on the roles of the famed “three-legged\nstool”—design, engineering, and product—design system work includes many other\ndisciplines like content, QA, research, illustration, business analytics,\nbehavioral science … any discipline typically found on a digital product team.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these are also the roles useful in making a design system for\nan organization. It’s natural for a design system to start within a particular\ndiscipline like design, IT, or UX. These design systems often fail to gain\ntraction, because it’s too easy for the rest of the organization to see it as\n“someone else’s library.” A design system needs to belong to everyone, which\nmeans it can’t really belong to anyone. Working on, contributing to, and\nmaintaining a design system is truly a democratic and collaborative exercise.\nThe rest of this book will show you how to avoid a siloed birth for a design\nsystem and instead create one that eventually represents an entire\norganization.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * Does your team or organization manage two or more digital products?\n  * What kind of efficiencies in tools and processing could your organization benefit from?\n  * Do you already have a design system in your organization?\n\nSUCCEEDING IN DESIGN SYSTEMS\n\n![](../images/pg7.jpg)\n\n_Hayley Hughes is a seasoned design system expert who has worked at some of\nthe largest and well-known enterprise organizations of our time. I asked her a\nfew questions about her experience with design systems and what it takes to\nsucceed in the space._\n\nWhat is a design system to you?\n\nTo me, design systems are a _community of practice_ made up of diverse teams\nwithin an organization. This practice involves teams collaborating in an ever-\nevolving feedback loop of observing, making, and reflecting on what a quality\nexperience means for their users, and how to deliver it. The community creates\nand governs shared platforms and tooling for scaling insights, standards,\nassets, and services across an enterprise.\n\nYou’ve worked on design systems at the largest scale at some of the world’s\nlargest organizations. What skills do you need to work at that level?\n\nAt larger organizations, the design system supports thousands of people, from\nin-house teams to external partners. It needs to work for diverse audiences in\na variety of geographies and environments using different devices and\ntechnologies. With so many use cases, the system needs to enable unity, not\nuniformity—rallying teams to create cohesion across experiences, while giving\nthem flexibility and a wide range of expression.\n\nGoing from small to large companies is as much a mindset shift as it is a\nskillset. You stop thinking of systems as a purely pixel-and-code craft and\nstart thinking of systems as a state craft of operationalizing people and\npractices.\n\nOperational skills like facilitation, coaching, and diplomacy help you\norganize movements and manage change with large groups of people. That means\nyou drive alignment conversations between a dozen teams. You coordinate\nrollouts that cascade changes across hundreds of products. You create\neducational materials for training design system trainers. You build domain\nknowledge in the product development cycle and identify ways that systems can\nimprove institutional capacity. You look for patterns—matchmaking people and\nresources. Pixels and code still matter, but you hire others with the skills\nthat it takes to do those jobs, while coaching them on the skills it takes to\nscale systems.\n\nWhat are some commonalities between every design system you’ve worked on?\n\nI’ve worked on a handful of design systems at IBM, Airbnb, Nike, and Shopify.\nOne reason I chose to work on these systems is because the people leading them\nhave common values. First, they understand that the purpose of design systems\nis to improve the quality of decision-making on teams versus just shipping\nfaster. Second, they really care about driving collaboration across teams and\nintroducing changes in a thoughtful way. Third, these teams prioritize\nequitable work in areas like accessibility, inclusion, localization, and\nethics.\n\nFrom a team size perspective, most systems I’ve worked on had a core team of\ndesigners and developers that might range anywhere in size between a handful\nto a few dozen people at any given time. They’ve all had a shared design\nlanguage, component libraries, documentation site, and enablement program for\ntraining and partnering with product teams. Usually, the system has been\npositioned horizontally, reporting in through a design, operations, or\ninfrastructure function.\n\nWhat are some differences in organizations that make each of their design\nsystems unique from one another?\n\nEvery design system I’ve worked on has been at a different stage of maturity.\nIBM’s design system was built from the ground up, developing a design language\nfor everything—not just the software and hardware, but also the physical\nbuildings, business cards, events, advertisements, you name it. Airbnb had\ntrouble getting people to use the system, so I was asked to help drive\nadoption. Shopify wanted to expand to become a system of systems. This meant\nfocusing on governance and enabling teams to create local systems. Nike’s\nsystem needed to become more flexible to support more differentiation across\nbrands, geographies, and use cases. Every system has similar problems, but\ndepending on which stage of maturity they’re in, you might be prioritizing one\nover another.\n\nHow did your career path prepare you to work on design systems so effectively?\n\nThere is no one career path that leads you to being effective in design\nsystems. I’ve had teammates who were former biologists that were experts in\nfeedback loops or lawyers who knew how to handle open source licensing. People\nin design systems come from all different kinds of backgrounds.\n\nA common theme in a design system career path is the idea of being hybrid, or\nshowing interest and capability in multiple domains. This concept most often\nrefers to hybrid skills in design and development, but there are many types of\nhybrids. Part of becoming a hybrid involves trying on many hats before\ndefining your role in design systems. By doing so, you become an\ninterdisciplinary thinker with more empathy for others.\n\nI wouldn’t call myself a hybrid, but I have spent most of my career doing\ninterdisciplinary thinking. I first worked at nonprofits focused on\ninfluencing political and environmental systems. Then I worked at restaurants\nand art museums that created hospitality, brand, and wayfinding systems. In\ngrad school, I studied healthcare and local food systems. Now, I’m focused on\ndesign language systems.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone looking to break into a design system\ncareer?\n\nLook for the holes. If you’re able to sell the holes as an actual problem,\nthen you can put yourself in a position to fix them. Do the research to show\nthat you know what teams need. For example, if you’re seeing issues with\naccessibility in a product experience, dig deeper. The business should also\ncare because it probably has requirements it has to meet around compliance to\navoid litigation. Combine the user needs and the business requirements into a\ncompelling opportunity, and solve for that.\n\nYou don’t even need to say the words _design system_ at first, even if that’s\nwhat you’re technically making. Once you solve it, you’ve built trust to ask\nfor more investment, perhaps another teammate or resources to keep filling\nother “holes.” Keep tracking and measuring the outcomes of the problems you’re\nsolving. Eventually, these things snowball where you can share full case\nstudies and reveal the system that powers them.\n\nWhat encouragement would you give to design system veterans?\n\nIf you’re in an organization that struggles to reward systems work and promote\nsystems people into higher levels, don’t give up. There are periods in your\ncareer when no matter what you say, people just won’t “get” systems. Maybe\nit’s because they require a tolerance for some degree of complexity. There\nwill be other times where you’ll have incredible advocates who not only “get”\nsystems but invest in you and your team. There’s some peace in knowing that\nthis is an endless cycle, as stakeholders and investors come and go over the\nyears.\n\nWhat we have control over is the ability to apply the holistic approach we\ntake to solving any type of problem within an organization. Don’t just make\ndecisions. Study how decisions get made. People who move into a systems\nleadership role need to shift their practice toward understanding: How are\ndecisions made, contributed, governed, learned about? Our jobs are to make\nsure that process, that decision workflow is as seamless and easy to do and\nconducive to good outcomes as possible. That’s system lifecycle work.\n\nLastly, remember to ask: Where is the most impact you can make inside or even\noutside your organization with your skills in design systems? Your answer\nmight be about helping people work better together. It might be about training\npeople to be systems thinkers. Maybe it’s about bringing together the entire\norganization and the end-to-end user experience. The bounds of systems are\nonly where you draw the line for yourself, on your team, and within your\norganization. Keep dreaming and let your imagination be your guide.\n\n  1. 1 “Material Design,” Google, <https://m3.material.io/>\n\n  2. 2 Dylan Czarnecki and Harley Manning, “Customer Experience Drives Revenue Growth, 2016,” Forrester, June 21, 2016, [www.forrester.com/report/Customer-Experience-Drives-Revenue-Growth-2016/RES125102](http://www.forrester.com/report/Customer-Experience-Drives-Revenue-Growth-2016/RES125102)\n\n  3. 3 “Fluent Design System,” Microsoft, <https://fluent2.microsoft.design/>\n\n  4. 4 “Carbon Design System,” IBM, <https://carbondesignsystem.com/>\n\n  5. 5 “Lightning Design System,” Salesforce, [www.lightningdesignsystem.com/](http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/)\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 2 Design System Fundamentals\n\nWord Nerds Unite!\n\nDifferent Kinds of Design Systems\n\nChoose Your Own Design System Adventure\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about design systems is that they’re a\ntangible, particular thing. Instead, design systems represent a combination of\nthings. They are ecosystems, and ecosystems are hard to point to.\n\nIt’s like trying to show someone a coral reef. You might take them to the\nbeach and point vaguely toward the ocean. You’re not pointing at anything in\nparticular but the combination of elements: water, sand, land, rock, polyps,\netc.—so many other parts that contribute to the whole. Without even one of\nthese things, a coral reef is less of itself. So, too, are design systems.\n\nOut of curiosity, I asked people on Twitter how they might point to their\ndesign system,1 and I received dozens of different answers ([Figure\n2.1](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-1)). No one individual was correct, but together,\nthey all were.\n\n![](../images/fig2-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.1A design system is an ecosystem consisting of lots of different\nparts.\n\n## Word Nerds Unite!\n\nDespite the countless articles, books, videos, courses, and other content\nabout design systems on the internet, part of the challenge of understanding\nthem is that the digital design industry generally doesn’t agree on a shared\ndefinition. Here are a few different takes on what a design system is:\n\n> A set of connected patterns and shared practices, coherently organized to\n> serve the purposes of a digital product.\n>\n> —Alla Kholmatova, UX + interaction designer\n>\n> A design system offers a library of visual style, components, and other\n> concerns documented and released by an individual, team, or community as\n> code and design tools so that adopting products can be more efficient and\n> cohesive.\n>\n> —Nathan Curtis, design system evangelist, EightShapes\n>\n> A design system [is] the official story of how your organization designs and\n> builds digital interfaces.\n>\n> —Brad Frost, front-end designer\n>\n> A design system is any set of decisions governed across an organization.\n>\n> —Hayley Hughes, design director, Nike\n>\n> The components are the trees. The design system is the forest.\n>\n> —Jeremy Keith, web developer\n\nAll of these things are accurate! The challenge comes from the fact that the\nroot words—“design” and “system”—are each broad. Let’s examine where they come\nfrom.\n\n“Design” is particularly problematic because it’s both a noun and a verb. It\nstarted as a verb in the late 14th century with the Latin word designare,\nwhich means to “make an identifying mark.” The word evolved into a noun as\nwell in the late 16th century with the French word desseign, which means\n“making a plan with a purpose.”\n\nThe word “system” emerged in the early 17th century in the Latin word\n“systema” meaning “an arrangement” and the Greek word “systema” meaning “an\norganized whole compounded of parts.”\n\nPut them together and you have something close to the idea of “an organized\narrangement for a particular purpose.” That could apply to anything!\n\n## Different Kinds of Design Systems\n\nRather than trying to define design systems outright in order to determine\nwhat is and isn’t one, be broader and more inclusive about defining design\nsystems. No gatekeeping here! It’s a fruitful exercise to identify a few\ndifferent types of design systems. In relation to digital product work, here\nare the seven common kinds of design systems:\n\n  1. Design systems as brand identities and visual languages\n  2. Design systems as projects\n  3. Design systems as tools and templates\n  4. Design systems as a digital product\n  5. Design systems as a process\n  6. Design systems as a service\n  7. Design systems as a practice\n\n### Design Systems as Brand Identities and Visual Languages\n\nVisual languages are one of the oldest kinds of design systems. Humans have\nreused symbols to communicate meaning from cave paintings as early as 38,000\nBCE to the Sumerians’ alphabet in 3000 B.C. to movable type in 6th century\nChina to Gutenberg’s modern printing press in the 1400s to the email you\nprobably sent a few hours ago. Brands develop visual identities that they\nreuse to establish themselves in the minds of their consumers. For example, a\nspecific shade of blue reminds people of high-end jewelry retailer Tiffany &\nCo. ([Figure 2.2](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-2)). A simple bottle silhouette makes\nyou salivate for an ice-cold Coca-Cola ([Figure 2.3](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-3)).\nPeople know a phrase on a T-shirt set in Futura Extra Bold Condensed is a Nike\nshirt without many other signals ([Figure 2.4](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-4)). Visual\nlanguages are an important and prevalent kind of design system in our brand-\nsaturated world.\n\n![](../images/fig2-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.2The iconic Tiffany Blue® is a significant part of the Tiffany & Co.\nbrand identity.\n\n![](../images/fig2-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.3A simple bottle silhouette paired with a specific shade of red\nscreams Coca-Cola.\n\n![](../images/fig2-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.4Setting text in Futura Extra Bold Condensed feels like a Nike shirt\neven before seeing the logo.\n\n### Design Systems as Projects\n\nWithin a digital design context, many design systems start as a simple project\nwith a deadline and some desired output, usually borne out of the desire for\nmore efficiency. These often look like a manager or supervisor granting\npermission and extra time to one or more of their direct reports to create\nsome output like a UI kit or a component library of reusable parts with the\nhope that it will speed up or simplify the next similar project.\n\n### Design Systems as Tools and Templates\n\nParticularly good for service providers like freelancers, studios, and\nagencies that do work that they deliver to others, tools and templates are\ndesign systems that are designed to ultimately be detached from their original\nsource and given away to take root elsewhere. These tools and templates could\nbe things like boilerplate contracts and agreements, Keynote and PowerPoint\ntemplates, or some generic code files that every project starts with.\n\nHTML5 Boilerplate2 is a great example of a design system as a tool: created at\na central source, it’s designed for others to take and modify for their needs\n([Figure 2.5](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-5)). The creators call it “delete-key\nfriendly,” in that it contains more than you’ll probably need, and the process\nof making it your own involves removing parts that aren’t applicable to your\nuse case.\n\n![](../images/fig2-5.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.5The HTML5 Boilerplate is a simple template for quickly building web\npages that adhere to best practices.\n\nA quick way to employ a design system of tools and templates is to use someone\nelse’s. While a design system as a project typically involves the creation of\na tool or template, you could certainly purchase a paid tool or start with an\nopen-source one.\n\n### Design Systems as Digital Products\n\nIn digital design, products are pieces of software that usually get iterated\nupon over time. They typically have one person or a small team dedicated to\nimproving them, which often means there’s an amount of money over time\nallocated to maintenance costs and compensating employees. (This is the kind\nof design system you’re probably reading this book to learn more about.)\n\nShopify’s Polaris design system is a great example of a design system that’s a\ndigital product ([Figure 2.6](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-6)). There are people who\nwork at Shopify whose job it is to work on Polaris full-time. The “What’s New”\nsection outlines recent changes entitled “Version 10 typography,” which\nimplies that there have been nine prior versions that have been iterated\nthrough over time!\n\n![](../images/fig2-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.6Shopify’s Polaris design system is a digital product that helps\nShopify employees build experiences for their merchant customers.\n\nA common characteristic of design systems as products are that they have\nroadmaps for improvement for the near- to long-term future. This is really\nwhat sets a design system as a _product_ apart from a design system as a\n_project_. Projects typically have a deadline and a deliverable, and then\nthey’re done. Products are never finished. Consider version-control service\nGitHub as an example of a digital product. Founded in 2008, GitHub employees\nhave been making their product better for more than a decade, with no sign of\nstopping. In fact, they’ve made their roadmap public so that anyone can see\nwhat they plan to do in the short-term and long-term ([Figure\n2.7](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-7)). Like GitHub, design systems that are products\nare on a quest to continually improve their product for the foreseeable\nfuture.\n\n![](../images/fig2-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.7GitHub makes their roadmap public so that anyone can see what\nfeatures will be worked on and released in the near future.\n\n### Design Systems as a Process\n\nSome design systems aren’t a tangible thing. For many organizations, a design\nsystem can be a specific way of doing design and product that everyone can\nadopt and rally around.\n\nDesign sprints are a great example of a design system as a process.\nPopularized by the team at Google’s venture fund GV, a design sprint is a\nfive-day process for answering critical business questions through design,\nprototyping, and testing ideas with customers ([Figure\n2.8](chapter2.xhtml#fig2-8)). Agnostic of any specific customer or use case,\nthe GV team uses their design sprint system to help their portfolio companies\ndesign new products and explore new markets.\n\n![](../images/fig2-8.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 2.8The GV 5-day sprint is a process that can be effective for any\ncompany they take it to.\n\nThere are many different kinds of product and design processes that can be\nadopted as design systems, like double diamonds, spiral models, Lean, and many\nmore. The key to treating them as design systems is making it a shared way of\nworking on your team or at your organization.\n\n### Design Systems as a Service\n\nSome organizations treat a design system as a service: a collaborative,\ninterdisciplinary, holistic approach to create experiences that meet a host of\nneeds. Rather than this kind of design system being a tangible thing or an\napproach, a design system as a service often manifests as a group of people\nthat can be utilized as supplementary knowledge or additional resources. This\ncan be an internal team that gets brought in for special reasons, or it can be\na third-party like a consultancy or agency.\n\nAn entire branch of a company can be an example of a design system as a\nservice, like a design operations organization. But beware: a design\noperations organization (DesignOps) can also be the umbrella organization that\na design system team sits within. At this level, definitions get really\nblurry, so focus less on what this is and instead on what value it might\nprovide.\n\n### Design Systems as a Practice\n\nOn his blog, yoga teacher James Happe describes the difference between _doing_\nyoga and _practicing_ yoga.3 He talks about doing yoga as something that\nanyone can do. It can be fun. It can be light. It can be part of a weekly\nschedule as rarely or often as you prefer.\n\nPracticing yoga, however, is “more about the effort than the result … It\nrequires an active, participatory learning on the part of the student where\nthe instructions are only internalised (sic) through questioning,\nexperimentation, application, and reflection. [It] requires wholehearted\nattention.”\n\nDesign systems can be practices, too. Design systems as a practice aren’t\nabout a particular artifact, tool, technology, or process. Instead, they’re\nabout a shared, collaborative effort that can bring the otherwise disparate\ndisciplines of product, design, and engineering together in harmony.\n\nWhichever design system—or combination of them—you’re pursuing, you have to do\nit repeatedly to get good at it. The more you use a tool, the better you\nutilize it. The more you employ a process, the more familiar it becomes.\nDesign systems that aren’t a practice run the risk of quickly becoming\ndormant, so make sure you’re setting aside time to practice using whatever\nkind of design system you choose.\n\n## Choose Your Own Design System Adventure\n\nEvery time you begin or continue design system work, declare and decide which\none you’re working on. This is especially important when you work with a team,\nas you can accidentally be pursuing different goals without knowing it.\n\nFor the purposes of the rest of this book, I’ll teach you how to start, grow,\nand maintain a design system as a product and as a practice. These kinds of\ndesign systems stand to reap major rewards for some of the world’s largest\norganizations working at the grandest scales, so it stands to reason that\nbuilding momentum here would be difficult. Fear not! Understanding what kind\nof design system you’re working on is the first step, and you’ll soon see some\nmovement that will start to pick up speed.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * What kinds of design systems do you have experience with? Which are new to you?\n  * What kind or combination of design systems does your organization have? Is there a different kind or combination that would work better?\n  * How can you continue to articulate to your team the kind of design system you’re pursuing so that you’re all working toward the same goal?\n\n  1. 1 Dan Mall [@danmall], “If someone said to you, ‘Show me your design system,’ what’s the first thing you’d pull up?” _Twitter_ , April 6, 2020, <https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1247285170396422145>\n\n  2. 2 “HTML5 Boilerplate,” <https://html5boilerplate.com/>\n\n  3. 3 James Happe, “The Difference Between Practicing Yoga and Doing Yoga,” September 22, 2014, <https://jameshappeyoga.co.za/practicing-yoga-doing-yoga/>\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 3 The Parts of a Design System Product\n\nThe Most Common Parts of a Design System\n\nThe Sum of Its Parts\n\nDesign Systems Are About Connectedness\n\nComponent Libraries vs. Design Systems\n\nConnect the Entire Digital Ecosystem\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nThe first automobile ever mass-produced was the Ford Model T, created by the\nFord Motor Company in 1908. It had little more than an engine, a transmission,\na suspension, wheels, and a body.\n\nMore than a century later, today’s cars are much more modern, sophisticated,\nand advanced than the Model T. Some modern cars automatically turn the\nwindshield wipers on when they detect moisture. Some automatically dim the\nheadlights when another car approaches. Some cars even drive themselves.\n\nYet, despite these advances and the major differences, it’s safe to assume\nthat it wouldn’t be too difficult for a driver from today to drive the Model\nT. Today’s cars have the same basic construction: an engine, a transmission, a\nsuspension, wheels, and a body. Because of these standard parts, even new\ndrivers can sit in very different kinds of cars manufactured across many\ndecades and get acclimated in just a few minutes because the parts are fairly\ncommon.\n\nThe same is true of design systems. Every design system is unique because\nevery organization is, but the same set of standard parts tend to appear from\nsystem to system. This means that, if you’ve learned to use one design system,\nyou can get acclimated to most other design systems fairly quickly.\n\n## The Most Common Parts of a Design System\n\nThe most common parts of a design system product tend to be naturally aligned\nto what designers and engineers need in their everyday work. This includes a\nfew tools and assets, some instructions on how to use them, and a few ways to\ncommunicate all of it to a broader audience. Many design systems products\nfeature these six common parts ([Figure 3.1](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-1)):\n\n  * A UI kit\n  * A component library\n  * Guidelines\n  * A reference website\n  * Design tokens\n  * Digital products, e.g. websites and applications\n\nLet’s explore and dissect each of these parts.\n\n![](../images/fig3-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.1The six most common pieces of a design system product are shown\nhere.\n\n### UI Kit\n\nWhen many people think about design systems, they picture a UI (user\ninterface) kit, a file typically made in a design tool like Figma or Sketch\nthat displays all the individual components as if they were spread across a\ntable ([Figure 3.2](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-2)).\n\n![](../images/fig3-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.2Tetrisly is an example of a popular UI kit.\n\nUI kits are useful, but they’re only a piece of a design system product, not\nthe entire thing. Prioritizing UI kits higher than the other parts is one of\nthe biggest culprits of why design system products don’t get fully adopted\nthroughout an organization. In fact, a UI kit may be the least important part\nof a design system product ecosystem.\n\nOver the last few years, the design industry has seen a renaissance of sorts\nin design tooling in applications like Figma and Sketch. The danger that\naccompanies this revitalization of powerful design tools is to use them for\nmore than is actually useful.\n\nIn his keynote address at company conference Config Europe 2020,1 Figma CEO\nDylan Field introduced the new Variants feature by walking through a file that\nshowed the Settings page of the Spotify mobile application. He described the\nproblem designers face in creating a page like this that can show different\nstates of the page with certain items toggled on and others toggled off. He\nsaid, “If I was going to try and prototype this in Figma today, I’d have to\nmake [a] monstrosity, because I’d have to think about all of the possible\ncombinations, which is something like 26. We started prototyping it out to see\nif it could work, but we stopped halfway through because there are better\nthings to do with our time.”\n\nAlthough the new Figma Variants feature certainly makes it easier to prototype\nthat kind of Settings screen, the hidden toxicity that snuck in is that it\nmakes designers think that this work is even worth doing in the first place.\nRather than actually creating work that increases customer value, designers\nsquander their efforts on polishing UI kits and wiring up Settings screens in\na design tool instead of a true software environment. (I’ll explore worthwhile\nwork effort in more detail in [Chapter 7](chapter7.xhtml), “Roles and\nResponsibilities.”)\n\n### Component Library\n\nEngineers need their own equivalent of a UI kit, but in code, as opposed to a\ndesign tool. That’s typically known as a _component library_ or a _pattern\nlibrary_. (I’ll refer to it as a “component library” for the rest of this\nbook, but the terms are generally interchangeable.) Components are reusable\nsnippets of code, so a component library is a collection of code snippets\nwhere you can browse examples and references for implementing into a codebase.\n\nDesign systems that are products need some way of connecting reusable\ncomponent code to digital products that end-customers interact with, and\ncomponent libraries are the most common way to do that. That’s why the\nmajority of most design system products are component libraries, followed by\nthe guidelines that accompany the components.\n\nGoogle’s Material Design is more of a methodology than a product, much of\nwhich you can read about on the Material Design reference website ([Figure\n3.3](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-3)). However, at the time of this writing, the web\ncomponent library for Material is a simple GitHub repository of components\nwith very little documentation,2 so other third-party companies have taken the\nMaterial Design methodology and created their own component libraries for it\n([Figure 3.4](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-4)).\n\n![](../images/fig3-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.3Material Design is more than just a component library. It’s an\nentire methodology for designing and building digital products that feel\ninherently like Google products.\n\n![](../images/fig3-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.4MUI (Material UI) is a third-party library that features coded\ncomponents based around the Material Design approach.\n\nBecause the design system product industry is so young, there are many\nemerging and promising ideas in this space. One to watch is the effort of\ntools like Bit ([Figure 3.5](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-5)), favoring more of a micro\nfront-end approach. Their proposition is to move teams away from building\nmonolithic, organization-centric design systems and more toward, in their own\nwords, “component-driven apps composed of independent components built by\nautonomous teams working side by side.”\n\n![](../images/fig3-5.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.5Bit is an open-source toolchain for component-driven software.\n\n### Guidelines\n\nEvery good design system has _guidelines_ , suggestions or rules to follow for\nhow to best use any given design system. Good guidelines tell you what and\nwhat not to do. Design system guidelines often take the form of principles or\nuser experience best practices.\n\nAt first glance, this might seem like the same thing as a reference website,\nbut not all guidelines or documentation need to live on a reference site—nor\nshould they! The best guidelines help designers and engineers at the point in\ntheir work where they need it, often called “just-in-time” documentation. For\nexample, designer Mike Wilson has built a Figma plug-in called _Gist_3\n([Figure 3.6](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-6)) that lets you “view attached\ndocumentation without leaving your working file.” The documentation for a\ncomponent is right there in your view as you’re working on it in your working\nenvironment.\n\n![](../images/fig3-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.6The Gist plug-in for Figma brings documentation right into the\ndesign environment.\n\n### Reference Website\n\nUI kits, component libraries, and guidelines are typically compiled together\nin a reference website or reference site (also known as a _style guide site_).\nA reference site is a visible manifestation of a design system, typically a\nURL that displays both the full component library and a set of guidelines.\nMost design system reference websites are largely documentation references.\n(This misses a large opportunity, which I expound on in [Chapter\n10](chapter10.xhtml), “Evangelism Never Stops.”) Unencumbered access to the\ndocumentation needed to use a design system plays a big part in how much that\nsystem is used. If the system is difficult to use or a practitioner can’t\nfigure out how to use it, they’re often content to find another resource\nthat’s easier for them, which is likely a big part of why many folks look to\nBootstrap or Material Design over creating their own design system or even\nusing the one they already have.\n\nFor many oft-admired design systems, the reference site is most people’s entry\npoint into it. When people talk about Shopify’s Polaris, they’re often\nreferring to what they see at <https://polaris.shopify.com/>. When people talk\nabout IBM’s Carbon Design System, they’re often referring to what they see at\n<https://carbondesignsystem.com/>. When people talk about Salesforce’s\nLightning Design System, they’re often referring to what they see at\n[www.lightningdesignsystem.com/](http://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/). For\nall of these examples, the reference sites are completely public, i.e., anyone\nwith an internet connection can view them.\n\nThere are many benefits to a completely public reference website. Front-end\ndesigner Brad Frost is explicit about this in his book _Atomic Design_. His\nsubsection about making a design system public is part of a larger section\ncalled “Make It Visible,” within a chapter entitled, “Maintaining Design\nSystems.” And rightly so! Making a design system public is a crucial part of\nunderstanding how to keep it managed and maintained. Brad explains that making\na design system public:\n\n  * **Increases its visibility** , which therefore increases the likelihood of use.\n  * **Creates accountability** by demonstrating a commitment to a product dedicated to consistency and reusability.\n  * **Helps recruiting** by publicly signaling values that attract like-minded individuals to join the organization.\n\nWith all the advantages of a completely public reference site, why aren’t all\ndesign system reference sites public? In theory, there’s not much to making a\ndesign system public. After all, if there’s one core skill a web designer or\nweb developer should have, it’s taking some HTML files and putting them on a\nserver that has an associated URL. (FTP, anyone?)\n\nWhat prevents a design system from being public? In short: business. If you\nwork at an organization with enough sprawl to warrant a design system, chances\nare high that there’s an IT process for getting any site deployed. That\nprocess likely includes authentication of some form, and launching something\npublicly is one of the most risk-loaded actions you can undertake, so it has\nthe most amount of rigor attached to it. I’ve seen this process take months or\neven be blocked altogether. All of that can be a deterrent to even attempting\nto have a public design system.\n\nLinkedIn senior UX lead Nate Whitson makes it plain: “It’s non-trivial to be\nable to share all of your documentation publicly.” Nate expounds on that\nstatement to say that sharing information outside a company means you need\nadditional context for the uninitiated, which amounts to extra overhead on\nwhat you might write, design, and document.\n\nBut “public” isn’t an all-or-nothing kind of decision. The accepted definition\nof a “public design system” tends to refer to a design system with both a\npublic reference site and an open-source code library. GitHub Head of Design\nDiana Mounter describes the different degrees of how a design system can be\npublic:\n\n  * **Public documentation only:** The reference site is accessible to all, but the code itself is hidden away.\n  * **Open-source code library:** Not only is the code public, but people are free to request features and contribute back (with acceptance of contributions at the maintainers’ discretion).\n  * **Open-source documentation:** People can modify and contribute only to the documentation, not the design system code itself.\n  * **Downloadable:** Typically in the form of a zip file, this can allow for a downloadable version of the design system that’s different from the code that maintainers actually work with.\n  * **Publish the component library:** You could publish a read-only version of your component library—Storybook, Pattern Lab, Fractal, etc.—to a URL that all can see.\n\nSoftware engineer Ryan DeBeasi shares how he’s split the difference in the\npast. “We didn’t have permission to make our design system public, so we did\nthe next best thing: we treated it like a small open-source project within the\norganization,” which reinforces the idea that making a design system public\nhas many different flavors.\n\n### Design Tokens\n\nDesign tokens aren’t technically a requirement of a design system in the same\nway that guidelines or a component library are, but many teams are using or\nstarting to use them to make a design system even more useful and powerful. As\ndefined by the Design Tokens W3C Community Group, a design token is “the\nsingle source of truth to name and store a design decision, distributed so\nteams can use it across design tools and coding languages.” A common use for\ndesign tokens is to centralize design and brand attributes across multiple\nplatforms like web, iOS, Android, and more.\n\n### Digital Products: Websites and Applications\n\nThe last piece is the most important: _digital products_! These could be\nwebsites, native mobile applications, kiosks, touchscreen apps—essentially,\nany application that lives on a screen. Without a real digital product for\nsomeone to use, a design system is just a theoretical exercise, a tool that\nnever gets pulled out of its toolbox. The more products that use the design\nsystem, the more evident the design system’s usefulness becomes. And there you\nhave it: all of the parts of a design system product!\n\nA PRIMER ON DESIGN TOKENS\n\n![](../images/pg32.jpg)\n\n_Esther Cheran is the chief product officer and co-founder of Hyma, a company\nbuilding the next generation of tooling in the design systems and design\ntokens space. She’s also the co-creator of the widely used Tokens Studio for\nFigma. I asked her a few questions about her experience with design tokens and\nhow they help amplify the efficacy of a design system._\n\nWhat is a design token?\n\nDesign tokens are the smallest design decisions that encapsulate a brand\nidentity. Examples of a design token are design decisions like border radius,\nborder width, and background fill of a button.\n\nWhat’s your experience with design tokens?\n\nI started using design tokens to build a tokenized Design System, which\neventually became the Headless Design System. During that time, I was using\nTokens Studio created by Jan Six very heavily and eventually started\ncontributing to the plug-in and became one of the co-creators.\n\nI was pushing the boundaries of how design tokens can be used to build\ncompletely headless design systems and the concept really took off with a lot\nof other teams building multibrand design systems.\n\nHow do design tokens help designers?\n\nDesign tokens are now becoming available to designers to actually use in their\ndesign process through tools like Tokens Studio and soon native\nimplementations in design tools. Because of this, designers have a direct\nfeedback loop with tokens making maintenance of the system a lot easier and\nalso making design consistency less prone to human error.\n\nHow do design tokens help engineers?\n\nDesign tokens take out the guesswork in interpreting designs from designers.\nAny minor changes in the look of the components can be done by designers\nwithout having to allocate developer resources.\n\nHow do design tokens help team members who aren’t designers or engineers?\n\nDesign tokens give everyone a single source of truth to work from. For\nexample, brand teams can visualize and quickly prototype how the brand would\nlook using tokenized mock-ups.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who has never used design tokens before?\n\nDesign tokens should be used as per the requirement of your project. You might\nnot need a complicated design token architecture with several layers of token\nsets and themes if you are building a single brand design system. A simple\ntoken architecture would suffice. On the other hand, a multibrand design\nsystem that caters to different platforms might need a more complicated\nmultitiered architecture.\n\n## The Sum of Its Parts\n\nA design system is the sum of its parts. It’s the whole thing, not any one\npiece in particular.\n\nEach individual part of a design system helps a specific discipline. UI kits\nhelp designers to design faster and better. Component libraries help engineers\nto code faster and better. Those tools help primarily with process.\n\nBut a design system is a tool for an entire team, not a particular discipline.\nDesign systems help product teams deliver software to their customers faster\nand better. Design systems aren’t a process tool; they’re a delivery product.\n\n## Design Systems Are About Connectedness\n\nMost of the conversation about design systems tends to center around\ncomponents: how to architect them, compose them, combine them, and the like.\nIn her book _Thinking in Systems_ , environmental scientist, educator, and\nwriter Donella Meadows outlines what is and isn’t a system. She says, “A\nconglomeration without any particular interconnections or functions [is not a\nsystem] … stop dissecting elements and start looking for the interconnections,\nthe relationships that hold the elements together.”4\n\nWhat’s more important than the individual components within a design system is\nhow they relate to one another. Look for what’s shared, what’s common, the\nconnections between the components.\n\nTrue design systems are connected. Design and engineering need to be connected\nto product. How do you do that exactly? Read on!\n\n## Component Libraries vs. Design Systems\n\nPart of the confusion around design systems happens because some terms and\nconcepts are interchangeable while others aren’t. It’s difficult to know which\nis which. “Component library” and “pattern library” generally mean the same\nthing. “Alert” components are often called “notification” or “toast”\ncomponents. But “pills” and “badges” are very different, even though they\nmight look identical.\n\nPerhaps the most common conflation of terms occurs within the difference\nbetween a component library and a design system. These terms cannot and should\nnot be used interchangeably, because they’re very different things, even\nthough they seem comparable at first glance.\n\n### How to Use a Component Library\n\nBootstrap was originally conceived as “simple and flexible HTML, CSS, and\nJavaScript for popular user interface components and interactions” ([Figure\n3.7](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-7)). From that description, it’s unclear whether\nBootstrap is a component library or a full design system.\n\n![](../images/fig3-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.7The Bootstrap website debuted with a handful of common components\nfor designers and developers to use.\n\nThe clarity comes from the intended way to use Bootstrap. The two main calls\nto action at the top of the page are to “View project on GitHub” and “Download\nBootstrap.” Subsequent versions of the Bootstrap website simplified it even\nfurther to only “Download Bootstrap.” Tapping that button prompts the download\nof a ZIP folder containing CSS, icons, and JavaScript files to be copied and\npasted into a build.\n\nThis is the first clue about whether Bootstrap is a component library or a\ndesign system. Downloading files is working with duplicates; it’s your own\ncopy of the original set of files. Downloading means you have your own\nversion, which means the version of Bootstrap in your files isn’t connected to\nthe official version of Bootstrap anymore. Remember: true design systems are\n_connected_ , so using Bootstrap this way isn’t using a design system.\n\nThe difference further intensifies as you start to use Bootstrap’s components.\nFor example, to use Bootstrap’s “Breadcrumb” component, navigate to that\n“Breadcrumb” page in the “Components” documentation section and copy this code\ninto your build:\n\n`<nav aria-label=\"breadcrumb\">`\n\n`<ol class=\"breadcrumb\">`\n\n`<li class=\"breadcrumb-item\"><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>`\n\n`<li class=\"breadcrumb-item active\" aria-current=\"page\">`\n\n`Library`\n\n`</li>`\n\n`</ol>`\n\n`</nav>`\n\nAgain, as soon as you copy and paste, you’re breaking any connection from an\noriginal source. For those familiar with Figma, this is the code equivalent of\ndetaching an instance from its original component definition. Component\nlibraries rely mainly on copying and pasting, whereas design systems maintain\na connection to the original source.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s nothing wrong with using a component library.\nIn fact, component libraries are incredibly useful for the general practice of\nsoftware development and were partially the precursor to what eventually\nevolved into the practice of design systems. However, a component library\ndoesn’t utilize many of the advantages that a true, connected design system\ncan bring to a product team and an organization.\n\nImagine if the team that makes Bootstrap releases a new version with updated\nbreadcrumbs. While the updates may be both beneficial and desirable, they\nmight conflict with the customizations you’ve made to the version you’ve\ndownloaded and worked with. You’re stuck between a choice of retaining the\nwork you’ve already done or updating it and having to start from scratch.\n\n### How to Use a Design System\n\nContrast that with using something like Material UI, a React-based design\nsystem built to implement Google’s Material Design aesthetic into products.\nTapping “Get Started” or scrolling down on the homepage tells you how to start\nusing Material UI in your build. Unlike Bootstrap, which asks you to download\nfiles, Material UI asks you to “install” it. That’s a major distinction:\ncomponent libraries get downloaded, while design systems need to be installed.\nLet’s walk through the details of how that works by way of an example React\napp to, say, build a dashboard that lets you see your personal finances at a\nglance.\n\nOpen the root of your React app in a Terminal window.\n\nType `npm install @material-ui/core` at the prompt.\n\nThat’s it! The design system is now installed as a dependency in your\nfinancial dashboard React app. That’s a fancy way of saying that this\nfinancial dashboard is built on top of the Material UI design system.\n\nYou can check that, too, just to make sure. If you open the `package.json`\nfile in the root folder of this project, you’ll see these lines:\n\n`{`\n\n`\"name\": \"Example App\",`\n\n`\"version\": \"5.0.0\",`\n\n`\"private\": true,`\n\n`\"scripts\": {`\n\n`// build scripts go here`\n\n`},`\n\n`\"dependencies\": {`\n\n`\"@material-ui/core\": \"^5.0.0-alpha.12\",`\n\n`\"react\": \"latest\"`\n\n`}`\n\n`}`\n\nWHAT IS REACT?\n\nMany popular design systems are built on React. What is React, and why is it a\ngood choice for design systems?\n\nPer its official website, React is “a JavaScript library for building user\ninterfaces” ([Figure 3.8](chapter3.xhtml#fig3-8)). It was originally created\nin 2011 by Facebook software engineer Jordan Walker to make it easier to build\ncomplex user interfaces like Facebook’s newsfeed. Being the library that\npowers a highly-trafficked page like Facebook’s newsfeed is a heck of a proof-\nof-concept, so many engineers quickly adopted React as their library of\nchoice.\n\n![](../images/fig3-8.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 3.8React is a popular library for building user interfaces.\n\nThe heart of React’s allure is that it’s a component-based library. It\nincentivizes writing code in a way that’s reusable and portable, a perfect fit\nfor design systems.\n\nWhile most of the code examples in this book feature React code, the\nprinciples apply to many other component-based libraries like Angular and Vue,\neven if the syntax varies from library to library.\n\nLine 9 is what you’re looking for. Translated to plain speak, this line says\nyour financial dashboard application is _dependent_ on Material UI version\n5.0.0, release alpha 12. Just like kids are dependent on their parents for a\nfew crucial things, this app is dependent on Material UI. If Material UI\ndidn’t exist, your dashboard would be incomplete. That’s the link back to the\noriginal design system. That’s the connectedness that Donella Meadows was\ntalking about.\n\nThe benefit that connection gets you is real-time updates both ways. If the\nMaterial UI team makes a change to breadcrumbs, you get them for free the\nsecond you decide you want them. All you have to do is type `npm update\n@material-ui/core` in your Terminal. That will edit the line in `package.json`\nyou just looked at from \"`@material-ui/core`\"`:` \"`^5.0.0-alpha.12`\" to\n\"`@material-ui/core`\"`:` \"`^5.0.1-alpha.13.`\" No overriding will happen. No\nerased changes. No redoing work. The software does all the merging, keeping\nyour old work while integrating the new stuff, and you are none the wiser.\n\nIf you make a change to the breadcrumbs on your side and decide it might be\napplicable to everyone else that uses Material UI, there’s also a way for you\nto contribute that back to the Material UI library for others to use, assuming\nyou have the proper permissions to be able to do that. (I’ll go into more\ndetail about contribution in [Chapter 5](chapter5.xhtml), “Pilots—The Best Way\nto Start and Sustain a Design System.”)\n\nNOTE WEB VS. NATIVE\n\nThis is how design systems products for the web get installed and used. Design\nsystems products for native mobile platforms like iOS and Android have\nslightly different steps, but the general idea is the same.\n\n## Connect the Entire Digital Ecosystem\n\nA true, connected design system maintains a link from the financial dashboard\napp to the design system itself so that they’re always intact and always able\nto be in sync. The real power of all this is that it’s not just one site that\ncan be linked to the design system, but all of an organization’s digital\nproducts can maintain a connection between itself, the design system, and all\nthe other products in that ecosystem. When you install the design system as a\ndependency in every website and application, each instance is connected to the\nsystem—and, therefore, connected to each other.\n\nOne of the first big pitfalls that design system teams at an organization\nencounter is thinking they have a true design system product when, in fact,\nall they have are design system tools like UI kits or component libraries, and\nthey don’t know the difference. Worse still, they’re baffled about why it’s so\ndifficult to scale the kind of efficiency and consistency that true design\nsystem products and practices bring.\n\nNow that you know the difference, spread the word!\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\nTake these questions back to your teams of designers, engineers, and product\nmanagers in order to help identify design system gaps:\n\n  * Do you have a UI kit, a component library, a true design system, or something else at your organization?\n  * Whichever one you have, how did it get that way? (Understanding how something came to be may help unlock how to get it to progress.)\n  * What links or connections are you maintaining between your digital products and your design system?\n  * How can you move your organization toward a more connected system? If you already have a connected system, how can you deepen the commitment to sustaining a true, connected design system?\n\n  1. 1 “Config Europe 2020,” YouTube, September 17, 2020, [www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWy4fB3G9Gc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWy4fB3G9Gc)\n\n  2. 2 Material Design Team, “Material Web,” GitHub, <https://github.com/material-components/material-web#readme>\n\n  3. 3 Mike Wilson, “Gist,” Figma Community, [www.figma.com/community/plugin/1073059820691713754/Gist](http://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1073059820691713754/Gist)\n\n  4. 4 Donella H.

Those steps look something like this:\n\n  1. **Pitch the project.** Propose a design system initiative to executive leadership to get their buy-in in the form of both conceptual blessing and literal funding to grow a team.\n  2. **Create the building blocks.** A small team creates foundational components—“the design system”—that all other product teams are prone to implement and use.\n  3. **Use the system.** Product teams begin using the design system’s components in their product work.\n  4. **Contribute back.** For anything that’s not already in the design system, a product team creates it and then contributes it to the design system for other teams to use.\n\nThis process almost never works, and teams are left scratching their heads as\nto why. It’s because this plan is entirely wishful thinking, and not at all\nrealistic.\n\n## “Make System, Use System” Is a Fantasy\n\nThe core idea behind the way most people think to create a design system is\nthis: first you make the system, and then you use the system you made. So\nsimple! My kids sometimes think this way: “Dad, you put the old stuff you\ndon’t want out on the lawn for a yard sale, and then you make a lot of money\nfrom it.” Duh! All we need to do is make a really good design system, and\npeople will use it. Duh! This reeks of a naïve “If you build it, they will\ncome” strategy.\n\nThe pitfalls are in the details, and they exist in every step. These steps\ndon’t work because every step is individually difficult; each has a high\npotential for failure.\n\n## Getting Design System Buy-in Is Often Pitching Vaporware\n\nProposing a design system initiative to leadership is tough because the design\nsystem you’re pitching doesn’t exist yet—it’s vaporware. As of this writing,\nthere are three billion Google search results on “getting buy-in for a design\nsystem.” The top results share similar advice: prepare your elevator pitch,\ndefine the pain, compile projections about the business value of design\nsystems and their typical return on investment, show a plan on getting from\nzero to up-and-running, and communicate your progress to your stakeholders\noften. With these pillars, you’re bound to get leadership excited and full\nfunding to make your design system dreams a reality.\n\nIt’s an attractive concept that rarely works.\n\nPerhaps the venture capital-funded, startup unicorn world we live in has\nfooled enough of us into thinking that, if only our pitch is strong enough,\npeople will invest, sight unseen. But, in the same way that a VC is more\nlikely to invest once a startup has found traction—that is, a critical mass of\npeople are already using the product—executive leadership will be much more\nlikely to bless a design system initiative after people are steadily using a\ndesign system. Until then, you’re just crossing your fingers for a leadership\nteam that has a high tolerance for risk, a rarity these days.\n\n## Abstract Design Systems Are Difficult to Make\n\nCreating foundational building blocks is difficult because it’s an abstract\nexercise. Even the supposedly simple task of creating a color palette is\nfraught with difficult questions to answer in abstraction, which is why most\ndesign system color palettes end up including every hue of the rainbow and\nmultiple shades of grayscale with little guidance on how to use any of them.\n\nYou end up with a system that’s more “book smart” than “street smart.” It’s\nlike telling a kid that they must learn the ins and outs of music theory\nbefore they can jam on a familiar tune. Music theory knowledge would certainly\nbe helpful, but it severely delays the joys of being able to play a song and\nimpress your friends.\n\nWhen design system work is done in a vacuum and a design system team doesn’t\nhave specific use cases, their strategy seems to be something akin to “let’s\nprovide as many elements as product teams might need at any point,” leading to\nbloated design systems. In trying to create a design system that gets used by\nanyone and everyone, they actually create a design system for no one in\nparticular.\n\n## Good Luck Convincing Someone to Adopt a New Tool\n\n“But Dan!” you object. “You’re being so pessimistic! Surely, it’s possible to\ncreate something that would be valuable for product teams to use.” It’s true:\nthere are teams that manage to get past this stage and emerge with potentially\nuseful components that are able to appropriately balance flexibility and\nspecificity.\n\nNow it’s time to get teams to use this new system. This usually poses the next\nbig blocker: convincing someone to adopt a new tool—or generally just to do\nanything new—is difficult! You’re asking product teams to renounce their\nfamiliar tools and employ yours instead. How do they know they can trust it?\nWill it work for them? Will they know how to use it? How steep is the learning\ncurve?\n\nThe typical proposal that design system teams give is that their newly created\nsystem of building blocks is objectively better than other tools, and that it\nwill create more consistency across all of the organization’s websites and\napplications because it has the brand’s color palette and typography built in,\namong other things.\n\nThe challenge isn’t that this stance is wrong; it’s that the stance is\nirrelevant, at least right now. It’s answering questions that haven’t been\nasked. The design system team is trying to solve problems of consistency, but\nproduct teams are mostly trying to meet their already aggressive deadlines.\nAnything that might slow them down—like investing time and mental space in\nlearning a new tool—is considered a nonstarter.\n\nThis step is particularly exasperating because you’re literally fighting the\nscience here. Behaviorally speaking, humans tend to follow the principle of\nleast effort (or Zipf’s Law), which says that, given the choice, animals,\npeople, and even well-designed machines will choose the path of least\nresistance as a way of conserving as much energy as possible. That path is\nusually continuing to do what’s currently being done. Pragmatically, teams are\ngenerally predisposed to stick to their current practices by default, a major\nhurdle in trying to get them to adopt your new design system.\n\n## Product Teams Don’t Contribute to Design Systems\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I hear from design system teams is that their\nproduct or feature teams don’t contribute to the design system. Of course,\nthey don’t! It’s difficult enough getting them to adopt the risk of using a\nnew design system into their current workflow.\n\nThere are two main reasons why product teams don’t contribute to their\norganization’s design system(s):\n\n  * **Too many new things.** According to a paper published by a Duke University researcher in 2006,1 more than 40 percent of a person’s daily actions are driven by habits. Introducing too many new tools and processes into a team’s standard way of creating products simply won’t take.\n  * **It’s not their job.** A product team’s job is to make product, not contribute to a design system. Asking a team that’s typically understaffed and worried about a deadline to contribute to a design system is exactly why that request moves to the bottom of a backlog.\n\nIn the next chapter, I’ll show you how to make contribution a much more\nnatural and automatic part of a design system workflow.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * Do you have buy-in on your design system? If so, how did you get it? If not, how can you get it?\n  * If the usual business of buy-in is broken, what might be a better way? Note your answer now and compare it to what you learn is a better way a few chapters from now.\n\n  1. 1 David T. Neal, Wendy Wood, and Jeffrey Quinn, “Habits—A Repeat Performance,” Neuron, (2006), [http://web.archive.org/web/20110526144503/http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendywood/research/documents/Neal.Wood.Quinn.2006.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20110526144503/http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendywood/research/documents/Neal.Wood.Quinn.2006.pdf)\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 5 Pilots—The Best Way to Start and Sustain a Design System\n\nLinking Design System to Product Work\n\nA Design System Pilot Scorecard\n\nTypes of Design System Pilots\n\nMultiple, Concurrent Pilots\n\nImproving the System as You Use It\n\nThe Piloting Process\n\nExtracting and Abstracting\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nInstead of employing a fingers-crossed, “make system, use system” strategy,\npiloting a design system by way of product work is a much more successful\nstrategy for creating—or recreating—a design system at an organization.\n\nConsider the way a television series is sold to a network. The show’s creators\ndon’t simply ask for a budget to make a show. They make something first. They\nmake one episode—a pilot—designed to gauge how successful more episodes and\nseasons might be. That pilot is intended to prototype characters,\ninteractions, dialogue, scenes, and more to justify further episodes and\nseasons of the show. The pilot for ABC’s hit drama _Lost_ dropped viewers\ndirectly into the show just moments after a plane crash on a mysterious\nisland. The audience got a glimpse into many of the characters and some hints\nthat everything on the island might not be what it seemed. They were hooked!\nBring on more episodes!\n\nThe point of having a design system is to improve the process and output of\nmaking digital products. But, before investing significant time and money to\nestablish a full design system and an associated practice, it’s worthwhile to\ntest out what kind of design system you’ll need, in order to build confidence\nthat you can create more products like that in the future. The best way to\npilot a design system is to make a product with that design system—even if the\nsystem doesn’t exist yet.\n\n## Linking Design System to Product Work\n\nLinking design system work directly to ongoing digital product work is one of\nthe most successful ways to get traction for a design system. Why? Science, of\ncourse! Isaac Newton’s first law of motion—the law of inertia—says that\nobjects at rest tend to remain at rest. In design-system-speak, that means\nthat an organization without a design system is most likely to continue not\nhaving one.\n\nFortunately, science has the solution, too! The law of inertia also confirms\nthat opposite: objects in motion tend to stay in motion. If you want to get a\ndesign system initiative to start moving, hitch it to something that’s already\nmoving. What kinds of things are already moving in organizations that make\ndigital products? The digital product creation process! New products and\nfeatures are always on roadmaps. Teams are already allocated and have funding\nand executive buy-in to work on those features. Use their momentum as your\nown!\n\nIn digital-centric organizations, there are a handful of inflection points\nthat are perfect boarding platforms for design system work:\n\n  * Rebranding\n  * Replatforming\n  * Re-org\n  * Content or migration\n  * Merging with or acquiring another company\n\nWhat do these events have in common? These are points where the organization\nhas already committed to a large company-wide change. Hitch your design system\nquest to those wagons, because they’re already on the move. Volunteer your\nteam to tackle this work. This is the kind of work where it’s common to hear\nthe sentiment, “While we’re doing this, we might as well try to do it as\nefficiently as we can,” which is the perfect gateway to start laying the\ngroundwork for a design system practice.\n\nYou don’t even have to say the words “design system.” In fact, I’d encourage\nyou not to say those words to leadership, because it often feels like a\ndistraction to them. Instead of talking about the tool you’re making—a design\nsystem—talk more about the outcome of that work.\n\n“Doing work in this way will put us six weeks ahead of schedule.”\n\n“See how many fewer bugs we had by reusing code that’s already been through QA\n(quality assurance)?”\n\n“Our velocity has increased over the last few weeks.”\n\nYou and your team will know that a design system was the vehicle you used to\ncreate these kinds of wins, but no one else will be the wiser just yet.\n\n## A Design System Pilot Scorecard\n\nDoing design system pilots in a useful order simultaneously improves your\nproduct offering while growing your design system. Which begs the question:\nHow do you choose a useful sequence? A well-rounded scorecard can help\ndetermine what products best feed a design system, and in what order.\n\nPull up your organization’s roadmap for new products to create, in addition to\nexisting products to touch up or rethink. You can score every product against\nthese eight factors on a scale from 0 (unlikely) to 10 (very likely) to help\ndetermine which products make for good design system pilots:\n\n  * **Potential for common components.** Does this pilot have many components that can be reused in other products?\n  * **Potential for common patterns.**1 Does this pilot have many patterns that can be reused in other products?\n  * **High-value elements.** Is there a component or pattern with high business value that is the heart of this project?\n  * **Technical feasibility.** How simple is a technical implementation of the design system? Is a large refactor required?\n  * **Available champion.** Will someone working on this product see it through and celebrate/evangelize using the design system (and even contributing to it)?\n  * **Scope.** Is this work accomplishable in our pilot timeframe of [3–4 weeks] (insert your timing here)?\n  * **Technical independence.** Is the work decoupled enough from other legacy design and code that there are clear start-and-end points?\n  * **Marketing potential.** Will this work excite others to use the design system?\n\nOnce you’ve scored each new product on your roadmap (Table 5.1), average the\nscores and order them from highest to lowest. This is the sequence that will\nbest grow your design system. Do the highest score first and the lowest score\nlast. If you’ve scored this accurately, and you do the highest scoring pilot\nfirst, the second pilot should benefit from the work you’ve done on the first\none. And the third would benefit from the second, and so on. The pilots should\nget easier as you go along, because you should be extracting components and\npatterns from each pilot, growing the design system constantly.\n\nTABLE 5.1AN EXAMPLE DESIGN SYSTEM PILOT SCORECARD\n\n|  [Flagship.com](http://Flagship.com) Website |  Native iOS Application |  Employee Intranet  \n---|---|---|---  \nPotential for Common Components |  7 |  2 |  10  \nPotential for Common Patterns |  7 |  2 |  10  \nHigh-value Elements |  4 |  3 |  3  \nTechnical Feasibility |  2 |  10 |  5  \nAvailable Champion |  8 |  6 |  9  \nScope |  1 |  10 |  1  \nTechnical Independence |  4 |  3 |  8  \nMarketing Potential |  10 |  10 |  4  \n|  |  |   \nTotals |  43 |  46 |  50  \nAverage |  5.38 |  5.75 |  6.25  \n  \nAnother useful thing about this kind of roadmap scoring is that sequencing is\noften subjective. Sometimes, a powerful or loud product owner picks their pet\nprojects or favorite features to get funding and priority, often under some\nhand-wavy guise of “business value.” A scorecard like this turns that\nsubjectivity into something more objective that can be debated and discussed\nagainst agreed-upon criteria. Making good roadmap decisions should be the same\nas making good design system decisions and vice versa.\n\n## Types of Design System Pilots\n\nJust like there are different kinds of TV pilots—premise pilots set up a\nscenario that may drive the first season, while non-premise pilots spend more\ntime on characters’ lives and personalities—design system pilots can vary in\ntype, scale, and scope. The driving question is, “What do we need to be able\nto make with our design system?” To answer that, each digital product used as\na design system pilot should attempt to test something specific. Using a\nproduct build to pilot the expressiveness of a design system is a very\ndifferent pilot than testing how quickly a product can be built.\n\nHere are a few different kinds of pilots you can run depending on what kind of\noutput you’re trying to test:\n\n  * **The Indiana Jones:** In a scene from _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ , adventurous archaeology professor Indiana Jones tries to swap a golden idol with a bag of sand weighing approximately the same amount in hopes no one will notice the change. One of the earliest kinds of pilots worth doing is to refactor a codebase from using custom-built components to ones coming from a central design-system repository. It’s a way to establish a connected system where there was previously none. An important aspect of this kind of pilot is to resist the temptation to “improve” anything while you’re in there. Don’t make design or user experience changes. The big idea with this kind of pilot is that nothing will appear different to an end user.\n  * **The Facelift:** These pilots are perfect for helping migrate products to a new visual language, especially useful after a big rebrand. If the design system already contains pieces of the new identity, like updated typefaces and color palettes, you can use this kind of pilot to entice product teams to upgrade to the new visual language “for free” just by adopting the design system.\n  * **The Speed Run:** The point of this kind of pilot is to test how quickly you can create an interface with components from the design system. Choose a feature, page, or product to construct and give yourself a small window of time to complete this pilot. The more of this kind of pilot you can do, the more confidently you can advertise the design system as a major timesaver.\n  * **The Surrogate:** The best pilots are working on real roadmap items, but sometimes that just isn’t feasible due to team availability, tight deadlines, lack of interest, and more. In those scenarios, the design system team can role-play as a product team, building front-end prototypes of current features but with the design system instead. Those prototypes can be made available as a front-end target and example to strive for once the actual product team has the bandwidth.\n  * **The Perimeter:** Flagship products make the best impression when you tell people they were built on the design system, but they’re also the most difficult to line up. Stakeholders are more protective of them, and their roadmaps may be impossible to influence. Take the opposite approach: build the products with the least amount of red tape to be involved with and do as many of them as you can very quickly. When my team and I worked with a hotel chain, we used pilots like the Wi-Fi landing screen and front desk welcome screen, products that got way less stakeholder attention than something like a booking page but actually were seen by guests way more often.\n\nBe creative with the kinds of pilots you run and watch your design system grow\nnaturally!\n\nNOTE NEEDS AND WANTS\n\nA semantic difference to be sure, but it’s important that the question driving\na pilot is “What do we need to be able to make with our design system?” and\nnot “What do we want to be able to make with our design system?” If the\nquestion were the latter, it would be too easy to answer, “Anything and\neverything!” This well-intentioned sentiment is often what leads teams to\ncreate design system graveyards of too many components that no one needs and\nnot enough components that are actually needed.\n\nA simple but useful guideline here is to create a design system that your\norganization needs, even if it’s not the design system that everyone wants.\nHow do you know what people at your organization need? Ask them!\n\n## Multiple, Concurrent Pilots\n\nIt’s sensible to think that working on one pilot at a time is a reasonable way\nto grow a design system. Resist that urge. Your first pilot will probably go\npretty well. Then you’ll realize that, unless you got lucky, very few of your\ncomponents that came from the first pilot work well in the second, because you\ndidn’t have the second use case in mind yet.\n\nIf you eventually want your design system to simultaneously power your\ninterfaces for web, native mobile applications, and lean-back experience, you\nhave to simultaneously pilot powering interfaces for web, native mobile\napplications, and lean-back experiences. It might be messy to wrangle, but it\nwill reflect the reality of what you’re trying to do. If you can’t support it\nin a piloting environment, that’s a helpful indicator that your design system\nmight not be able to support multiple teams across all of those platforms in\nthe future. Pilots should give the team a taste of what’s ahead and the\nconfidence that they can do it.\n\nTo that end, a good starting point is to work on three pilots at the same\ntime, using your pilot scorecard to identify three in sequence. Across\nscience, religion, philosophy, and psychology, three is a special number.\nThree is the smallest number to see patterns emerge (see sidebar: “Three Times\nIs a Pattern”). Three concurrent pilots give you ample range and variety\nwithout being too overwhelming.\n\nThat means the ideal piloting setup is to have four teams running\nsimultaneously ([Figure 5.1](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-1)):\n\n  1. Product 1 team\n  2. Product 2 team\n  3. Product 3 team\n  4. Design system team\n\n![](../images/fig5-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.1The beauty and the challenge of a design system ecosystem is\nmanaging at least four concurrent workstreams.\n\nCoordinating four teams to work on four independent products that still have\noverlap is no small feat. Luckily, you can treat the idea and scope of a pilot\nas liberally as you please. A pilot could be a full-on product with many\ndifferent components and pages and screens and states, like an intranet, a\ndashboard, or a shopping cart. But it doesn’t have to be. A pilot could also\nbe one page or feature of a product, like a pricing table or embeddable video.\nHeck, a pilot could be a particularly complex component, like a calculator, a\ntab set, or a header.\n\nRemember: the important part of a pilot is that it answers the question, “What\ndo we need to be able to make with our design system?” As long as it\naccomplishes that outcome, give yourself permission to dial down how much\nyou’re biting off at a time in order to rack up some wins and confidence for\nthe team.\n\nTHREE TIMES IS A PATTERN\n\nIan Fleming is the author of the James Bond series of spy novels. In his book\n_Goldfinger_ , one of the characters says to James Bond, “Once is\nhappenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time, it’s enemy action.” In\nother words, it’s only after the third time that you have enough confidence\nthat the pattern is on purpose.\n\nSo, when do you contribute a component to the design system? When three or\nmore teams need it or are using it.\n\nDesign systems exist to solve common problems. Less than three instances isn’t\ncommon enough to be worthwhile work to warrant a design system team’s\nattention. Design systems are a tool for scale. Spending time on one-offs (and\ntwo-offs) isn’t working at scale, but three or more starts will get you in\nthat territory.\n\nIf it’s good enough for 007, it’s probably good enough for you.\n\n## Improving the System as You Use It\n\nThere’s a scene in _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_ where teenage\nwizard Harry and his friend Ron arrive late to their first class of the year\nof “Advanced Potion Making.” Harry tells Professor Slughorn that they don’t\nhave textbooks yet, so Slughorn sends them into the closet to get some.\n\nThere are two books left: a brand new one and an old, beat-up, used one\n([Figure 5.2](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-2)). Ron and Harry fight over it, and Harry\ngets stuck with the old one.\n\n![](../images/fig5-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.2Trick question: Would you choose the brand-new textbook or the old\nused one?\n\nThe first assignment given to the class is to brew an acceptable draft of\nLiving Death, and whomever can do this will win a vial of Liquid Luck as a\nprize. Slughorn says the recipe for Living Death is found on [page\n10](chapter1.xhtml#pg_10) of the textbook, but he also warns that only once\ndid a student ever manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim the\nprize. (Foreshadowing!)\n\nAll of the students struggle, but Harry discovers that his old\ntextbook—labeled property of “the Half-Blood Prince”—is full of notes written\nin the margin that show how to successfully brew this potion ([Figure\n5.3](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-3)). The notes share tips like, “Crush with blade”\ninstead of “cut” like the instructions say. Or use 13 beans instead of 12.\n\nWith his annotated textbook, Harry’s the only one who manages to make the\npotion successfully and win the prize. It’s almost like cheating to have\nsomeone who’s done it before tell you how to do it successfully.\n\nMany teams approach making a design system like writing a textbook. They write\ndown the ideal way to build a product in theory. They try to guess what the\nperfect card component for everyone would be.\n\n![](../images/fig5-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.3Notes from someone who has done what you’re currently attempting to\ndo are invaluable.\n\nBut that’s just a spec. It hasn’t really been proven yet. That’s why piloting\nis so useful. A design system isn’t writing a spec beforehand. It’s doing\nsomething successfully and documenting it while you’re doing it.\n\nFront-end designer Brad Frost says a design system is “the official story of\nhow an organization designs and builds digital interfaces.”2 Said differently,\nit’s a collection of stories for how teams at this organization have made\ndigital products that highlight the patterns that emerge from seeing all those\nstories in one place.\n\nMake a cheat sheet for people who create digital products after you have.\nCrush with blade; don’t cut. Use 13 beans, not 12. Inline alerts here, not\npop-ups. This shade of teal because it has higher contrast against the\nbackground. Not because that could work in the future, but because that has\nworked in the past.\n\nStop trying to make a design system by making abstract components. Instead,\ngive your team a use case. Pick a potion to brew like “Living Death.” Choose\nthe main product dashboard. Build the new intranet. Put yourself in the shoes\nof the people trying to use the design system by trying to make something\nclose to what they’d be making. If the design system needs to streamline the\nprocess of making intranets in the future, start by making intranets first to\nwork out the kinks.\n\nTry to follow the textbook and make notes about where the textbook just isn’t\nright.\n\nThat’s the design system. Not the textbook. The design system is the notes in\nthe margin. That’s what’s been contributed back: the stories, the solutions.\nThe nice thing about doing this in the context of making digital products is\nthat you don’t have to settle for notes in the margin. You get to update the\ntextbook itself. Every product used as a design system pilot makes the\ntextbook more and more accurate so that it gets easier for everyone to do it\nthe right way.\n\n## The Piloting Process\n\nThe process of piloting a design system is a cyclical one. Cycles and feedback\nloops are important ingredients in any system. These cycles are primary\nmechanisms for how a system self-corrects.\n\nWithin the practice of design systems, linking design system growth and\nproduct creation creates a virtuous cycle, a positive feedback loop that\ngenerates momentum ([Figure 5.4](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-4)). But how does an\norganization start the cycle? It’s a classic chicken/egg problem. Is one place\nbetter to start than the other?\n\n![](../images/fig5-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.4The virtuous cycle for digital organizations relies on building\npositive momentum between design system and product.\n\nThe answer is to start with product. Product comes before system. I prefer a\nslightly modified diagram that I call “the Measuring Spoon Cycle for Design\nSystems” ([Figure 5.5](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-5)). (Because it’s shaped like a\nmeasuring spoon? See? I know; it needs work.) In short, this is the most\nsuccessful process for making a design system that I’ve seen yet.\n\n  1. Make a feature or product.\n  2. Extract and abstract components from that feature or product to start the system.\n  3. Make another product using the components you previously extracted.\n  4. Return to Step 2.\n\n![](../images/fig5-5.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.5Kick-starting the virtuous cycle of a design system practice should\nstart with product.\n\nThen repeat this process. Forever. For as long as your company exists.\n\nThe nice thing about the Measuring Spoon Cycle is that it applies equally to a\nnew team making their first product and system as much as it does to an\norganization that’s had a design system for many years and wants to improve\nit. It’s never too late to start—or restart—this flywheel.\n\n### Piloting a Design System from Scratch\n\nSome organizations find themselves in a “blank slate” phase regarding design\nsystems. It could be a startup making its first set of digital products. Or it\ncould be an established organization that has so much interface sprawl or\ndesign/code debt that starting from scratch feels like a more viable path over\nuntangling what already exists to build on top of. Whatever the case, here are\nsome examples of how you can use a pilot process to identify some starting\npoints for your design system.\n\n#### Piloting Unity, ExxonMobil’s Design System\n\nWhen I worked with ExxonMobil in 2016 to help them create their design system,\nUnity, they had 500 developers and only one designer (hi Chris!). The biggest\nneed from the outset was to figure out how to scale design inside the\norganization in a way that promoted brand consistency without it being\nenforced by any one person or team in particular. Developers were largely left\nto their own devices to build products. Some had design skills; others tried\nto use libraries like Bootstrap or Material Design that already had some\ndesign baked in by default. That meant there was a wide range of variance\namong all of the digital products created at ExxonMobil ([Figure\n5.6](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-6)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.6ExxonMobil apps sport a range of looks before a unified design\nsystem came along.\n\nThe team’s work began by picking a few applications to use as pilots for the\ndesign system and talking to the designers and developers making those\napplications, as well as some of the users of those applications. We started\nto design and build the features and functionality that users needed from\nthese applications. We didn’t do anything too “design system-y,” like defining\na global color palette or writing principles or anything like that. Instead,\nwe started to let that kind of work be emergent. We started with the Good Ol’\nProduct Design Process.™\n\nOne of our pilots was their Agenda Creator product ([Figure\n5.7](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-7)), a necessity for organizations that need to\nstructure their many meetings. We did stakeholder research and customer\nresearch, just like you would in any good product design process. We learned\nwhat functionality needed to be there and didn’t. We came up with a new design\nthat was a bit simpler and more modern with a sharper focus on the primary\ncustomer needs ([Figure 5.8](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-8)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.7ExxonMobil’s Agenda Creator product before a design system was\nimplemented.\n\n![](../images/fig5-8.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.8ExxonMobil’s new Agenda Creator product.\n\nOnce we were done designing and building this product, we looked at it again\nfrom the perspective of understanding what pieces could be abstracted and\nextracted for other ExxonMobil teams to use. The header in [Figure\n5.9](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-9) is a good example. By extracting the header from\nthis Agenda Creator product, the next team to use it got the benefit of all\nthe good thinking and hard work that went into making this header in the first\nplace. It’s responsive. It has all the right typefaces and brand attributes\nwithin it. It’s been tested for accessibility and for performance. The\nbehavior has been QA’d. It’s pulled straight out of a product and ready for\nothers to use where applicable.\n\n![](../images/fig5-9.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.9The Agenda Creator header is a perfect design system candidate\nbecause other teams could use it right away.\n\nThis isn’t a perfect header or a header that every team could use in\nperpetuity. It doesn’t even have navigation in it! But it didn’t need to. This\nteam needed a header without navigation—which we found out through the product\ndesign process research activities—so there’s a high likelihood that maybe\nanother team might need one, too.\n\nNotice that what we didn’t do was start abstractly. We didn’t say, “Let’s make\na header that everyone can use.” If we had started that way, we probably would\nhave overdesigned and overengineered the header. We probably would have tried\nto plan for any type of header that could exist whether it had mega drop-downs\nand search boxes and global nav and utility nav and all sorts of stuff in it\nthat we had no idea would be used, rather than working from a very particular\nuse case. It’s the other way around: let’s build a product and extract its\nheader into a design system for anyone who might make use of it. Pilots give\ncomponents context that you wouldn’t have otherwise.\n\nAgenda Creator was the first pilot. The second pilot was the Identity & Access\nManagement Portal ([Figure 5.10](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-10)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-10.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.10ExxonMobil’s Identity & Access Management Portal product before a\ndesign system was implemented.\n\nWe realized we could use the header we extracted from Agenda Creator, although\nit needed a few tweaks. So, we tweaked it for the new design ([Figure\n5.11](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-11)). We added a few more pieces like navigation\nlinks and a search bar.\n\n![](../images/fig5-11.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.11ExxonMobil’s new Identity & Access Manager product.\n\nWhat I hope you can anticipate is that, after working on five or six different\npilots, we had a few variations of our header ([Figure\n5.12](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-12)) with things like drop-down menus and utility\nlinks and mega navs, and also versions that didn’t have those elements when\nthey weren’t necessary. Sometimes it’s just a logo and a title and a\nnavigation. Each of these variations was easy to create because it came from\nspecific product requirements and a previously tested version. Since we had a\nfew robust header variations, we should never have to create a header from\nscratch again. We would likely tweak it with more variations, but most of the\nheavy lifting should be done.\n\n![](../images/fig5-12.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.12Different variations of the header in Unity.\n\nNow that we had all these headers, it made sense to put them somewhere with\nhelpful instructions so that other teams could easily find and use them.\nThat’s the purpose of a design system reference site, and this is the exact\npart of the process—the point where you have a component extracted from a\nproduct that doesn’t yet have a home—where you add it to that reference site.\n[Figure 5.13](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-13) shows a page of headers and footers that\nwe got from extracting them from real products for Unity, ExxonMobil’s design\nsystem.\n\n![](../images/fig5-13.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.13This is the time in the piloting process to add all variations of a\ncomponent to a page in a reference site.\n\nThe header component detail page ([Figure 5.14](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-14)) has\nso much useful information about the header, such as different variations,\ncode to implement, usage guidelines like do’s and don’ts, class name and API\ndocumentation, and much more. After doing a lot of pilots, you get a really\nrobust reference site as a by-product of the product design process.\n\n![](../images/fig5-14.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.14The header component detail page shows all the info someone needs\nto know how to use it.\n\n#### Piloting Seton Hill University’s Web Presence\n\nIn 2015, I helped create a design system for a Catholic liberal arts\nuniversity just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, called Seton Hill\nUniversity. As with the ExxonMobil example, creating that design system\nstarted with the regular Good Ol’ Product Design Process.™\n\nOn the “Areas of Study” template ([Figure 5.15](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-15)),\nthere’s a component halfway down the page with a label of “From Degrees to\nCareers.” The idea was that we could show the kinds of jobs that students with\nthis degree typically got after graduating. We designed it, and we built it.\nWe fittingly called it the “From Degrees to Careers” component. We figured it\nwould be a one-off component (sometimes called a _snowflake_ , as we didn’t\nthink it would be very reusable.\n\nWe made a few more pages, like Campus Life ([Figure\n5.16](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-16)). Our research strongly suggested that a\ncalendar of events on campus would be really useful to students, so our team\ndiscussed how to add it to the Campus Life page in the best possible way. We\nrealized we could use a pretty similar format to the “From Degrees to Careers”\ncomponent, so we mocked up a variation of it for this page.\n\nFrom an implementation and code standpoint, it felt a little bit odd to use\nsomething called the “From Degrees to Careers” component for upcoming events.\nSo, we had a few choices here:\n\n  1. We could duplicate the “From Degrees to Careers” component and make a similar “Upcoming Events” component, but it felt a little weird to have two separate components that were basically the same thing.\n  2. We could abstract the “From Degrees to Careers” component to serve both use cases.\n\nWe went with the second option (as you probably would have done). We\nabstracted it into a component called the “Vertical Tabs” component ([Figure\n5.17](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-17)). That way, it could be a flexible user\ninterface that could accept many different kinds of content and have a few\nvariations on how it might be styled.\n\n![](../images/fig5-15.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.15The “From Degrees to Careers” component is a unique area of the\npage.\n\n![](../images/fig5-16.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.16The “Upcoming Events” component looks strangely familiar to the\n“From Degrees to Careers” component.\n\n![](../images/fig5-17.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.17An abstracted Vertical Tabs component can work for both the “From\nDegrees to Careers” content as well as the “Upcoming Events” content.\n\nWhenever I share this kind of example, I usually get two specific kinds of\nreactions.\n\nThe first reaction is, “Isn’t this backward? Couldn’t you have started by\nmaking a Vertical Tabs component and then using it on each one of these\npages?” The answer is yes, I could have done that, but I didn’t know I needed\nit until I started designing these pages. It’s significantly easier to fill\nyour design system with components you actually need and will use when you\nhave real content and real use cases. Many organizations have a design system\ngraveyard full of components no one really needs right now that also doesn’t\nhave components that everybody actually _does_ need right now.\n\nThe second reaction I get is often framed as a criticism: “You took something\ncool and made it boring.” Yes! Thank you for noticing! That’s the point of\ndesign systems. As UX design leader Josh Clark says in his article, “The Most\nExciting Design Systems Are Boring,” “Design systems are containers for\ninstitutional knowledge. Identify the design problems teams confront over and\nover again. The more common the problem the better. Design systems should\nprioritize the mundane.”3 If you look at the stuff that a design system\nconsists of that comes out of the piloting process, it’s all the boring stuff,\nthe elements you don’t ever want to be making over and over again: paragraphs,\ncheck boxes, radio buttons, alerts buttons. It’s not about reinventing the\nwheel; it’s about mass producing the wheel so more people can more easily\nexperience their own adventures.\n\nCONTENT COMPONENTS VS. DISPLAY COMPONENTS\n\nIf you work on any kind of digital business, thinking and building in terms of\npatterns is incredibly valuable for your organization, as it will help you\nbuild leaner, faster, and more future-friendly. One of the most important\nlessons I’ve learned in creating modular design systems is that there’s a\ndifference between _content components_ and _display components_ :\n\n  * A _content component_ describes the types of elements within and can be rendered in multiple forms.\n  * A _display component_ describes a specific rendering and can be applied to multiple types of content components.\n\nWhat does that mean?! Let’s look at a common example. When constructing a\npage, I’ll often hear a team member say something like, “We can use the event\ncomponent here.” What does that actually mean? Perhaps the most obvious place\nto start is from a previously designed comp that looks like [Figure\n5.18](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-18).\n\n![](../images/fig5-18.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.18A simple event component with a title, date, and location.\n\nA simple way to mark that up could look like this:\n\n`<div class=\"event\">`\n\n`<h1 class=\"event__title\">Star Wars: The Force Awakens Premiere</h1>`\n\n`<p class=\"event__date\">Dec 20, 2015</p>`\n\n`<p class=\"event__location\">Ritz East, Philadelphia PA</p>`\n\n`</div>`\n\nWhile there’s nothing technically incorrect about this markup, it may not be\nabstract enough for reuse. As you think about the content model for an event,\nthe pieces displayed here are:\n\n  * Title\n  * Date\n  * Location\n\nThere’s nothing that ties an event to this specific display. Other types of\ncontent that may exist on the site could have similar content models, like\narticles: title, date, description. I could easily use the same display\ncomponent to render an article ([Figure 5.19](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-19)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-19.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.19A simple Article component with a title, publish date, and\ndescription.\n\nInteraction designer Alla Kholmatova wisely observed,4 “If you give [a\ncomponent] a presentational name, its future will be limited, because it will\nbe confined by its style.” Calling this an event component might mean that I\nnever even consider it for an article, even though it could work just as well.\n\nSo, how can you make a more useful component? Abstract the display from both\nan event as well as an article into a component that can apply to both\n([Figure 5.20](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-20)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-20.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.20A more abstracted component that can work for both events and\narticles.\n\nWith an abstracted display component like this, you can choose multiple kinds\nof content patterns (events, articles, etc.) to visualize. That leads to an\ninteresting approach when thinking about how to think and talk about\ncomponents in design systems:\n\n  1. Identify the type of content (content component).\n  2. Choose a visual option (display component) to render said content.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice? On a previous project we’d worked on\ntogether, my team decided that wireframes were too time-consuming to make and\nconstrained our client’s thinking on graphic design a little too much. We\nrealized that the most valuable thing about our previous wireframes was having\na list of content for each page. So, when our information architect sat down\nto map out the content strategy for the site, she whipped out a list of\ncomponents for each major page on the site ([Figure\n5.21](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-21)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-21.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.21Content descriptions without visual suggestions allow everyone to\nwork with ideal versions of content and user interface elements.\n\nThis allowed the engineer and me to work simultaneously, assembling all the\nparts in our own ways and riffing off each other’s work. Seeing this process\nunfold revealed another important insight: when working, content strategists\nprimarily think about content components, designers primarily think about\ndisplay components, and front-end engineers are responsible for bringing the\ntwo together. Certainly, a bit of an oversimplification, but I’ve witnessed it\nbeing true more often than not. It’s obvious in hindsight but easily\noverlooked when you’re heads-down in the middle of a project.\n\nLook at that spreadsheet. “Big Promo,” “More Upcoming,” and “Local Promo” are\nall listed as separate components because they do different jobs (see the\n“Features/Functions” column), but their content components are exactly the\nsame. Our information architect made sure that the engineer and I wouldn’t\nforget about that content and left it up to me to decide on the best display\ncomponents for this data to be rendered across different screen sizes. The\nengineer and I could decide how much to abstract these in code to make them as\nreusable and easily understood as possible.\n\nI hypothesized that we could build these content components with multiple\ninstances of just two display components, so I started by designing these (see\n[Figure 5.22](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-22)).\n\nThe engineer then translated both display components into one block of code:\n\n`<div class=\"g-item\">`\n\n`<div class=\"block block-thumb\">`\n\n`<div class=\"b-thumb\">…</div>`\n\n`<div class=\"b-text\">`\n\n`<h2 class=\"b-title\">…</h2>`\n\n`<div class=\"date-city\">…</div>`\n\n` <div class=\"dek\">…</div>`\n\n`</div>`\n\n`<!-- .b-text -->`\n\n`</div>`\n\n`<!-- .block -->`\n\n`</div>`\n\n`<!-- .g-item -->`\n\n![](../images/fig5-22.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.22Abstracted variations of display components that can work for\nanything with a title, description, metadata, image, and kicker.\n\nHe then created a modifier called `.g-item-hero` that turns the small display\ncomponent into the large one.\n\nThe final page ended up looking something like [Figure\n5.23](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-23).\n\n![](../images/fig5-23.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.23Content descriptions without visual suggestions allow everyone to\nwork with ideal versions of content and user interface elements.\n\nIn short: three sections powered by one display component—which we ended up\ncalling a “media object”—with two different views based on size, written as\none code block with one modifier.\n\nAs general guidelines, don’t let your display components describe the content\nwithin and don’t let your content components suggest anything about their\npresentation. With a construct like this, each person’s job could break down\nlike this. Initially:\n\n  * The content strategist’s job would be to define the content components.\n  * The designer’s job would be to create display components.\n  * The engineer’s job would be to create the markup for the display component and create the hooks for content to flow into the display components appropriately.\n\nWhere this all becomes really liberating and powerful is when you can have an\narmy of display components that can work with an infinite amount of content\ncomponents. Distinctions like these become incredibly useful in how you can\nwork on component-based modular designs.\n\n### Piloting a Design System from Existing Products\n\nOne of the most prevalent design system challenges today is when a person or a\nsmall team receives the charge to start a design system at an organization\nthat already has more than a handful of digital websites and applications that\nend users use. How do you pilot a design system when there are already plenty\nof existing products to choose from?\n\n#### Collecting the Best and Best Practices\n\nMany design system teams start their design system journey with an interface\ninventory,5 an exercise to collect the many different existing user interface\nelements to look for patterns and commonalities. These teams often use the\noutput of the inventory to demonstrate the amount of unintentional variation\nto the wider organization. In other words, “Look at all this redundancy and\ninefficiency!”\n\nBut an oft-missed opportunity from this exercise is to collect the good stuff\nalong with the bad. In fact, overlooking this responsibility is one of the\nbiggest missteps and misconceptions design teams have of themselves.\n\nMany see their role on a design system team as an opportunity to create best\npractices that the rest of the organization can then employ. “I’ll design one\nbutton to rule them all,” the naïve design system designer thinks. But\ncreating something new and convincing everyone else to use it is nontrivial.\nIn fact, it’s one of the primary hurdles to widespread design system adoption.\nInstead, the primary job of a design system team is to collect the\norganization’s best practices and prepare them for scaling. Highlight what’s\nalready been done in the past that works. In his book _Do Scale_ ,6 advisor\nLes McKeown summarizes, “Scalability is built on mastering the mundane.”\n\nOne way to reflect on whether your team is mastering the mundane is to reflect\non your language. Scrutinize your job descriptions, Kanban boards, and\nconversations you have about your work. If you’re constantly using words like\n_create_ , _generate_ , or _define_ , your team might have too much of a\npropensity to see themselves as the authority than they should, and you’re\nprobably in for an uphill journey in adoption. But if your team tends to\ngravitate toward words like _collect_ , _curate_ , and _establish_ as their\nforemost roles, that spirit will serve you well and lay out a smoother path\nfor others to want to use and contribute to your design system.\n\nOnce you’ve adopted a collector mindset, start collecting your organization’s\nbest stuff, which begs the question: what constitutes “best?” Here are a few\nsimple ways you might define “best” (see Table 5.2).\n\nTABLE 5.2DEFINING “BEST” AT YOUR ORGANIZATION\n\nOrganizational Priority |  Definition of “Best”  \n---|---  \nPerformance |  Fastest loading components  \nCustomer satisfaction |  Components on pages with least customer complaints  \nTechnical powers |  Well-coded components  \nAesthetic |  Components with beautiful user interface  \n  \nIn [Chapter 3](chapter3.xhtml), “The Parts of a Design System Product,” I\nmentioned connectedness as an important criterion for a true design system.\nThat doesn’t just apply on the technology side. Connecting design system goals\nand activities to larger and broader organizational priorities ensures that\ndesign systems efforts aren’t isolated or treated as secondary. The more you\ninfuse the design system with the regular and vital goings-on of the rest of\nthe organization, the more wins you’ll experience there, too.\n\n#### Collecting as an Exercise of Inclusion\n\nYou can also use your definition of “best” to signal important values about\nyour design system, in particular how inclusive you intend the system to be.\n\nFor example, you can choose to include in your design system some components\nthat teams are really proud of making, signaling that the design system is a\nplace that spotlights teams’ accomplishments.\n\nI once worked with an organization that had a component everyone knew as\n“Fred.” Every feature team had an instance of Fred within their work, even\nbefore an official design system team was established. When it came time to\nmake a design system, Fred was obviously the first official contribution.\nBecause the organization already had an affinity for Fred, including Fred in\nthe design system brought along some of that affinity with it. When fondness\nexists at a local (read: feature or product) level, collecting and promoting\nit to a deeper and more connected level of importance with a design system is\na great way to get people to want to use the design system, because they\nrecognize something they’re already drawn to.\n\nYou can also use the exercise of collecting to make friends around your\norganization. Perhaps there’s a team that tends to want to do their own thing.\nOr maybe there’s a team that everyone seems to stay away from. Including a\ncomponent or pattern they’ve made in a newly established design system signals\nthat you want them to be part of the shared foundation. It’s a way to say, “We\nwant you to be part of this initiative, because you’re already a part of it,”\nand that signal is a major driver of adoption for design systems.\n\nThe IKEA effect is a cognitive bias coined in 2012 by researchers Michael\nNorton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan Ariely that says people place\ndisproportionately higher value on items they had a hand in creating. It taps\ninto the psychological need to feel competent and that your work was worth it.\nThe IKEA effect is a big reason that designers and engineers will either try\nto create a new system on their own or prefer their own highly modified\nversions of systems like Google’s Material Design or (formerly) Twitter’s\nBootstrap. You can combat that cognitive bias with your design system by\nsignaling, “Hey, you’ve made this thing, too” and proving it by including\nelements that others have created, not just the design system team.\n\n#### Piloting a Speculative Nike Design System\n\nAs an example, let’s examine a brand like Nike that has many different public\nwebsites and applications in the wild to demonstrate how to extract a design\nsystem from existing digital products.\n\nFirst up: taking inventory. Might they already have a design system in use?\n\nLet’s start with the flagship website, [Nike.com](http://Nike.com) ([Figure\n5.24](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-24)). There are many components you’d expect to find\non a flagship website: navigation, logo, headers, buttons, hero elements,\nvarious typographic styles, product cards, calls to action, and more.\n\n![](../images/fig5-24.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.24[Nike.com](http://Nike.com) has many elements you’d expect to find\non a flagship ecommerce website.\n\nNext up: Nike’s news site ([Figure 5.25](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-25)). It contains\nmany of the same visual elements from the .com, but there is a decent amount\nof small variance. For those of you who are typographically minded, you may\nhave already noticed that there’s a slight difference in typefaces here from\nwhat we saw on the flagship website. This site uses the sans serif typeface\nCircular for headlines, which didn’t appear on the .com.\n\nAlso, while the header looks somewhat consistent, all of the navigation items\nare now hidden under an icon with three vertical lines, lovingly referred to\nas a “hamburger menu icon.”\n\n![](../images/fig5-25.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.25The Nike News site kinda feels like a Nike site, but there is some\nvariance from [Nike.com](http://Nike.com).\n\nContinuing over to the Purpose site ([Figure 5.26](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-26)),\nthere’s more variance here, too. The navigation is back and exposed; it’s no\nlonger under a hamburger menu icon. But now, there’s some variation in the\ntypography, as it’s using a much bolder condensed sans serif (Futura) to pair\nwith sans serif body copy (Helvetica Neue) and a serif (Palatino) for\nadditional flavor. And from a components and aesthetic point of view, there\nare much splashier hero elements with illustration and video on this site than\nthe previous ones.\n\n![](../images/fig5-26.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.26The Nike Purpose site kinda feels like a Nike site, but there is\nsome variance from [Nike.com](http://Nike.com).\n\nMoving on to the Jobs site ([Figure 5.27](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-27)), there is\neven more variance. The header looks close to the previous examples, but with\ndifferent typography and sizing. The interaction on the page is very\nanimation-heavy, driven by scrolling.\n\n![](../images/fig5-27.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.27The Nike Jobs site kinda feels like a Nike site, but there is some\nvariance from [Nike.com](http://Nike.com).\n\nOver to the Investors site ([Figure 5.28](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-28)), the Trade\nGothic sans-serif is back but in more of a leading role. There is also more of\na beveled Web 2.0 look in the header where there is some dimension rather than\nthat flat design look that was on the previous sites.\n\n![](../images/fig5-28.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.28The Nike Investors site kinda feels like a Nike site, but there is\nsome variance from [Nike.com](http://Nike.com).\n\nLet’s look at some native applications, too. Although visually similar, the\nNike Shopping app ([Figure 5.29](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-29)) has many more\ncomponents designed for interaction like tab sets, carousels, and accordions,\nas opposed to the mobile site which has many more static calls to action\n([Figure 5.30](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-30)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-29.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.29The Nike shopping native mobile app.\n\n![](../images/fig5-30.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.30The Nike shopping mobile website.\n\nThe SNKRS app ([Figure 5.31](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-31)) uses similar conventions\nas the Nike Shopping app, but there are small variations in what could be\nidentical elements like tabs or icons.\n\nLooking at these sites and apps in aggregate ([Figure\n5.32](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-32)), it’s easy to notice the little differences in\nvariation. Big differences are easy to justify, because different content\noften needs different ways to be expressed, but it’s all the little stuff that\nexposes the lack of a system.\n\nIf you solely look at just all the headers here ([Figure\n5.33](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-33)), look how closely they’re related, but not\nquite the same. Why are these different? This kind of variation is much more\ndifficult to justify and often doesn’t have a good explanation. It exposes\nthat each of these things was probably designed and built individually without\nthe qualities of what a system should actually contain. It’s the small\ninconsistencies, not the big ones.\n\n![](../images/fig5-31.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.31The Nike SNKRS native mobile app.\n\n![](../images/fig5-32.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.32Comparing Nike websites to search for common patterns.\n\n![](../images/fig5-33.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.33Comparing headers reveals inconsistencies. Intentional or not?\n\nLooking under the hood at the code side, too, the inconsistency is even more\napparent ([Figure 5.34](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-34)). For navigation front-end\ncode across three sites, one has a class name of `pre-l-nav`, another has a\nclass name of `nav-main`, and the third has a class of `main-menu`, even\nthough it looks like all three have very similar styling and behavior. Again,\nthis kind of small variation exposes the fact that this was probably created\nwithout some of the other versions in mind or without anyone who had an\noverview and an oversight of all of these things. In short, because these\nsites are connected where they could and should be, it’s a safe assumption\nthat no shared system was used and may not even exist.\n\n![](../images/fig5-34.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.34Comparing code that could be the same but isn’t.\n\n### Minimum Viable Design System\n\nIf our assumptions are correct that there isn’t an existing design system,\nit’s time to make one! You’ve just done the inventorying; now it’s time to\ncollect the best stuff. Trying to collect three best components and practices\nis a great place to start. The driving question you should try to answer is,\n“What three components could other teams use right now?” Through inventorying\nand talking to teams, you decide that these three elements are worthwhile\ncandidates ([Figure 5.35](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-35)):\n\n  * **Account Bar:** Its vertical format and limited horizontal space is the least visually disruptive to existing sites when implemented.\n  * **Button:** Everyone seems to be trending toward using this one anyway.\n  * **Nav Drop-down:** It’s a great example of balancing brand and functionality.\n\n![](../images/fig5-35.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.35Here are the three elements to begin a design system.\n\nThese three elements are the beginning of a Nike design system! You might be\nsurprised to hear that just three elements can be a design system. After all,\nmost of the popular design systems out there feature dozens if not hundreds of\ncomponents, so how could three components be sufficient?\n\nRemember that the design system definition from [Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml),\n“Why Design Systems?,” proposed that a design system was the _smallest_ set of\ncomponents that could be useful. Many teams view design systems as an all-or-\nnothing proposition, that an app has to be fully composed of design system\ncomponents to realize value. This is simply false. If even one component from\na design system saves a feature team a week, a few days, or even a few hours\nof time, the design system is already proving its value. I’ll share more about\nappropriate targets and goals for design system usage, adoption, and coverage\nin [Chapter 9](chapter9.xhtml), “Success Metrics for a Design System.”\n\n### Design Systems Are Emergent\n\nIn 1987, business management consultant Henry Mintzberg wrote an article for\n_Harvard Business Review_ called, “Crafting Strategy,”7 and it could not be\nmore appropriate to design system work. Mintzberg wrote, “Strategies that\nappear without clear intentions—or in spite of them—[are called] emergent\nstrategies. Actions simply converge into patterns … deliberate strategy\nprecludes learning once the strategy is formulated; emergent strategy fosters\nit. People take actions one by one and respond to them, so that patterns\neventually form.”\n\nMore often than not, the practice of design systems is one of emergent\nstrategy. Creating a design system in a vacuum and then trying to plug it into\nan organization’s rapidly moving product design process rarely works. Piloting\nworks because it allows patterns to emerge organically over time in a way that\nreflects the reality of an organization and rolls with its natural pace.\n\nWhen you look at a list of basic components that exist in a design system\n([Figure 5.36](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-36)), it’s easy to assume that it’s a list\nof prerequisites, like all the ingredients before you bake a cake. But that’s\nonly because there’s no context to the list. It’s the wrong metaphor.\n\n![](../images/fig5-36.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.36Are these jars of ingredients to make dishes or storage after\ndishes have been made? It’s impossible to tell just by looking at them.\n\nImagine instead that you inherited an antique car from a relative. While the\ncar was a beautiful and exquisite piece of machinery in its heyday, years of\nsitting around have concealed its luster, and it just doesn’t drive anymore.\n\nSo, you decide to restore it. You carefully disassemble the car so you can\nclean it; tune the parts that can still work after some love; and replace some\nparts that just don’t work anymore for brand new ones. At some point, you end\nup with all the parts disassembled on your garage floor.\n\nThat’s what this list is. Rather than thinking of this as a list of inputs,\ninstead consider this the list of outputs from the piloting process. You’ve\ntaken apart a product team’s application or website. And before you create a\nnew digital product, you have a bunch of parts on the garage floor, ready and\nwaiting to be reassembled into something new. It’s what comes out of the\nproduct design process that then can go into the design system. It’s not the\nfirst step that starts the Measuring Spoon Cycle. It’s a natural part of\nalready being in the cycle. This list reflects a moment in time, just after\nsomething has been deconstructed and just before you’ll use the parts to make\nsomething new and even better.\n\n## Extracting and Abstracting\n\nI’ve written about “extracting and abstracting” components a lot in this\nchapter, but how exactly does one extract and abstract a component? What does\nthat mean? What does that look like in a literal sense?\n\nAs you’re scrutinizing your organization’s many digital products, you’re bound\nto encounter multiple variations of the same component, likely stemming from\nthe lack of connection between design teams. For example, a cursory glance\nthrough multiple digital products from an American insurance company,\nAllstate, reveals nine separate kinds of text inputs ([Figure\n5.37](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-37)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-37.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.37Different text inputs for the same brand.\n\nHow could you reconcile all of these into one canonical version? The big risk\nhere is that you ultimately end up creating the 10th version instead of a\ncanonical version, reminiscent of the famous xkcd comic on standards ([Figure\n5.38](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-38)).\n\n![](../images/fig5-38.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.38Design system work often toes the fine line of creating yet another\ncompeting standard.\n\nThe key lies in reusing as much of what already exists within each of these\nvariations. Note the commonalities across four different criteria (Table 5.3).\n\nTABLE 5.3IDENTIFYING COMPONENT CRITERIA\n\nAll |  What does every version of this component have in common?  \n---|---  \nMost |  What do most versions of this component have in common?  \nSome |  What do some versions of this component have in common?  \nFew |  What do few versions of this component have in common?  \n  \nIn the case of this text input component, the chart breaks down like so (Table\n5.4):\n\nTABLE 5.4FILLING IN COMPONENT CRITERIA\n\nAll |  White background Border  \n---|---  \nMost |  Placeholder text  \nSome |  Rounded shape vs. rectangular shape Italic placeholder text vs. regular placeholder text Border vs. no border  \nFew |  Icon  \n  \nAs you start to design and build the “new” abstracted component, approach each\narea of the chart with these directives (Table 5.5):\n\nTABLE 5.5A RUBRIC FOR ABSTRACTING A COMPONENT\n\nAll |  Every characteristic is mandatory.  \n---|---  \nMost |  Every characteristic is highly recommended.  \nSome |  Prepare proposals and/or facilitate workshop to form consensus.  \nFew |  Delay including these characteristics.  \n  \n_All_ and _Few_ are the simplest. If every text input has a white background,\nmake sure that the consolidated, abstracted component has a white background.\nIf only a few text inputs have icons, don’t include an icon just yet; wait for\nthat obligation to become more common.\n\n_Most_ is a little trickier, but not much. If most text inputs have\nplaceholder text, it’s a safe enough bet that your abstracted component should\nhave placeholder text.\n\n_Some_ is the most contentious criteria by far. If some text inputs are\nrounded and others are rectangular, how do you resolve that conflict? The most\ninfallible way is to facilitate a workshop. Call together as many people who\nhave their own versions of the text input as possible and get them to agree to\nas much as you can. This effectively moves the characteristics up into the\n_All_ or _Most_ categories. For characteristics where an agreement can’t be\nreached, try to at least get the participants to agree that the design system\nteam’s choice will be the tiebreaker.\n\nGiven all of this, your abstracted text component may end up looking something\nlike [Figure 5.39](chapter5.xhtml#fig5-39).\n\n![](../images/fig5-39.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 5.39A consolidated text component from nine separate sources.\n\nThe important thing about this version is that as many people as possible can\nlook at it and conclude, “That looks pretty close to what we already have,”\nbecause they recognize some overlapping characteristics. In that way, they may\nfeel like they’ve “contributed” that characteristic, which is a major boon for\ncomponent adoption.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * Given where your organization is right now, would it be more fruitful to pilot a design system from scratch or from existing products?\n  * What are the “best” pieces of digital interfaces happening at your organization right now?\n  * Complete a pilot scorecard for your organization’s roadmap. What do the scores tell you about how to best grow a design system at your organization? How close is it to your current roadmap sequence?\n  * What three components could make up your “minimal viable design system?”\n\n  1. 1 In this instance, I’m distinguishing components from patterns, in that components refer to common static elements like buttons and cards while patterns refer to common interaction flows like login and checkout.\n\n  2. 2 Brad Frost, “Design Systems Are for User Interfaces,” November 15, 2021, <https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-are-for-user-interfaces/>\n\n  3. 3 Josh Clark, “The Most Exciting Design Systems Are Boring,” April 3, 2017, <https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html>.\n\n  4. 4 Alla Kholmatova,” Design Systems,” _Smashing Magazine_ AG, 2017.\n\n  5. 5 Brad Frost, “Interface Inventory,” July 10, 2013, <https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/>\n\n  6. 6 Les McKeown, _Do Scale_. (London, England: The Do Book Co., 2019).\n\n  7. 7 Henry Mintzberg, “Crafting Strategy,” July 1987, <https://hbr.org/1987/07/crafting-strategy>\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 6 Governance and Contribution\n\nThe WordPress Ecosystem as It Relates to Design Systems\n\nA Framework for Design System Governance\n\nA Design System Governance and Contribution Template\n\nDesign System as Canon and the Expanded Universe\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nFar and away, the conversations most teams I work with want to have are on the\ntopics of design system contribution and governance. That’s usually because\nthese are the places they see the most resistance: they see very little\ncontribution, and, even when contribution does happen, it’s not in the way the\ndesign system team wants.\n\nIn her book, _Managing Chaos: Digital Governance by Design_ (Rosenfeld Media\ncross-sell achievement unlocked!), management consultant Lisa Welchman\nemphasizes the importance of digital governance: it clarifies roles and\nresponsibilities for collaborative teams. I’ve seen two common scenarios where\ndesign system governance goes wrong:\n\n  * Teams define the right roles and the responsibilities but link them incorrectly.\n  * Teams understand the theory, but often get lost in the application of the specifics.\n\nTo address both of these common pitfalls, let’s turn to a long-established\nmodel for framing: the world of open source.\n\n## The WordPress Ecosystem as It Relates to Design Systems\n\nWordPress is a free, open-source content management system that powers 43% of\nthe top 10 million websites. It was released in 2003 and still remains heavily\nin use almost 20 years later.\n\nPart of the reason for WordPress’s longevity and scale is the way it’s\nmaintained. Consider the different kinds of groups involved in the ecosystem\nof WordPress:\n\n  * The WordPress core team consists of 5–10 developers, including co-founder Matt Mullenweg.\n  * Automattic is the company behind WordPress (among other ventures) that employs around 2,000 people, some of whom get paid to work on WordPress full-time.\n  * As of July 2023, there have been 56,326 contributions to WordPress Core.1\n  * WordPress has a number of contributors who get paid by their own companies (not Automattic) to work on WordPress, because it is a crucial tool to their business. Automattic employee Chuck Grimmett estimates that around 523 people on average have contributed to each version of WordPress from 5.0–6.0 that don’t work at Automattic.2\n  * WordPress has millions of users who conceivably have never and will never contribute to it. It’s estimated that 43% of the top 10 million websites use WordPress, and even with a conservative estimate of one WordPress developer for each of those sites, that’s a base of 4.3 million users.\n\nIn short, and with the most generous interpretation of the data:\n\n  * Only 0.05% of WordPress users get paid to work on it.\n  * Only 0.01% of WordPress users contribute back to it.\n  * Only 0.0002% of WordPress users are directly responsible for it.\n\nThat should set some expectations for what you might see and what’s realistic\nfor your organization’s design system. Many design system teams expect every\nteam that uses the design system to contribute back to it, which is just\nunrealistic.\n\nHaving been around for as long as it has, WordPress certainly benefits from\nthe economies of scale that you won’t have early on, so here’s a little fudge\nfactor translation for how this may relate to your organization’s design\nsystem. If 100 people in your organization use your design system:\n\n  * About 2 people (2%) should be expected to contribute back.\n  * About 6 people (6%) should be paid to work on it full-time or mostly full-time.\n  * 1 (1%) person should be directly responsible for it (likely the design system product owner).\n\n(I’ll share more about these roles in [Chapter 7](chapter7.xhtml), “Roles and\nResponsibilities.”)\n\nThis gives you some benchmarks for what to expect within your design system\necosystem.\n\n## A Framework for Design System Governance\n\nHere is a framework of the primary questions to answer regarding design system\ngovernance in this order:\n\n  1. What are the design system activities that need to be done?\n  2. Why should these design system activities be done?\n  3. Who should do these design system activities?\n  4. When should these design system activities be done?\n  5. Where and how should these design system activities be done?\n\nFortunately, many others have written extensively about the subject of design\nsystem governance. Let’s examine all of the pieces.\n\n### What Are the Design System Activities That Need to Be Done?\n\nIn Getting Vanilla ready for v1: the roadmap,3 design producer Inayaili de\nLeón lays out a flowchart to define the process for adding new patterns and\ncomponents to a design system ([Figure 6.1](chapter6.xhtml#fig6-1)). Each\norganization’s design system workflow may be slightly different due to\ninternal processes and culture, but the general questions to be answered in a\nworkflow document are shared:\n\n  * When do I use the system and when do I make something on my own?\n  * How does something new make its way back into the system?\n\nWhatever steps you include, make sure that it fits seamlessly within the\ncurrent process of product design your company uses ([Figure\n6.2](chapter6.xhtml#fig6-2)). Don’t just start and end your flowchart with\ndesign system tasks. The beginning of this workflow should be a step that’s\nalready in your product design workflow, and the last step of this workflow is\nto transition back into that existing product design workflow.\n\n![](../images/fig6-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.1Inayaili de León’s flowchart for adding a new component to the\nVanilla design system at Canonical.\n\n![](../images/fig6-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.2A new design system–based workflow is the perfect filling for your\nexisting process.\n\n### Why Should These Design System Activities Be Done?\n\nBecause you’re reading this book and have gotten this far, I’ll assume you\nknow why all of these design system activities are important: because life and\nwork have way more to offer than wasting your days making the same data table\nfrom scratch over and over again. ‘Nuff said.\n\n### Who Should Do Which Design System Activities?\n\nIn his article “Team Models for Scaling a Design System,”4 design system\nconsultant Nathan Curtis lays out the most common scenarios for how design\nsystem support teams are structured, with a soft recommendation for a\nfederated model ([Figure 6.3](chapter6.xhtml#fig6-3)) that includes a subset\nof both centralized members and representative members of different products\nand features.\n\n![](../images/fig6-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.3Nathan Curtis suggests a federated model of a representative group\nfrom around the organization to grow and evolve a design system.\n\nJina Anne—founder of design system conference Clarity—expands on that5 in\ntalking about her time at Salesforce, working on the Lightning Design System.\nShe recommends a cyclical model ([Figure 6.4](chapter6.xhtml#fig6-4)), one\nwhere product teams and the design system team work together to create the\nvirtuous cycle I mentioned in [Chapter 5](chapter5.xhtml), “Pilots—The Best\nWay to Start and Sustain a Design System,” where the design system informs\nproduct design and product design informs the design system.\n\n![](../images/fig6-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.4Jina Anne describes a cyclical model of responsibility between\nproduct teams and design system teams.\n\nHaving the wrong people doing the wrong work inside a design system ecosystem\nis probably the biggest source of unadopted design systems I’ve come across.\nThis role confusion is directly tied to the poor “make system, use system”\nstrategy I described in [Chapter 4](chapter4.xhtml), “The Broken Business of\n‘Buy-In’.” Perhaps the biggest value of thinking about design system work as a\npractice of emergent strategy is how it frames the idea of design system\ncontribution, one of the most important and elusive steps in an organization’s\nvirtuous cycle of product design.\n\nWhy is contribution so tricky? For organizations that don’t treat design\nsystem work as emergent, design system work and the product design cycle are\noften completely separate efforts. In that kind of organizational model,\ndesign system teams make components, product teams work on features, and it’s\nno one’s job in particular to figure out how the two fit together, and yet\nit’s still somehow an expectation.\n\nWhen you pilot, though, the roles of each team become much clearer. The job of\nthe product and feature teams is to create valuable things for their\ncustomers: end users of their products. The job of the design system team is\nto collect the components and patterns the product teams are creating by\nextracting them from the product and abstracting them for other teams to use.\n\nSaid differently, it’s the job of the design system team to contribute to the\ndesign system; it’s not the product team’s job. That’s where most\norganizations get it wrong. They think the design system team’s job is to\ncreate best practices and the job of the product teams is to somehow absorb\nand utilize those best practices and then magically figure out how to\ncontribute to that set of best practices. I’ve seen design system teams create\nelaborate checklists that product teams need to comply with in order to\ncontribute, and then they wonder why contribution is so low or even\nnonexistent. Contribution is difficult when the wrong people are responsible\nfor it and when the systems in place—sprint plans, product velocity, a “move\nfast and break things” culture—disincentivize it. A better way is to let teams\ndo what’s easy, natural, familiar, and (hopefully) fun for them for as long as\npossible. Systems people want to do system things. Product people want to\ncreate things. This is the way.\n\nI love to cook, but I don’t do it often, because I make a gigantic mess when I\ncook. I’m all for cleaning my stations as I go, but there’s still a bunch of\ncutting boards and knives and ramekins and plates that need washing and\ncleaning afterward. To avoid the work I don’t want to do, I sacrifice the\nthing that I actually do want to do.\n\nLuckily, we’ve struck a balance in our house. My wife Emily doesn’t like\ncooking, but she doesn’t mind cleaning at all. And she’s great at it! She’s\nway faster and better than I am at it with what looks to me like so much less\neffort than I generally have to exert when I clean.\n\nSo, we have an agreement: I cook, she cleans. We both (along with our kids)\nget a delicious meal, and we each get to contribute to it in the way we\nenjoy—or at least don’t mind—by getting the benefit of what the other one\ndoes, too.\n\nThat’s how product teams and the design system team should work together.\nDesign system teams are really good at standardizing things and abstracting\nthem. Product teams are really good at inventing new things and being able to\nuse them in their products to meet their deadlines and to create customer\nvalue. Invest in this by letting it drive your Measuring Spoon Cycle.\n\nOnce this cycle is going, design system contribution becomes automatic just by\nvirtue of everyone doing the work they’re supposed to do. From a product\nteam’s perspective, they created some things for a feature for their\ncustomers, and a few weeks later, it shows up in the design system, ready for\nother teams to use. From a design system team’s perspective, all they had to\ndo was identify some good component and pattern candidates and make a few\ntweaks to make sure the component’s scope is a little more widely applicable.\nWhen done well, it feels like magic to everyone involved, but it’s really\nbecause everyone’s doing their part.\n\n### When Should These Design System Activities Be Done?\n\nIf the “who” part of design systems is the biggest thing most teams get wrong,\nthe “when” part is the second largest culprit that goes hand-in-hand. In\nexpecting product teams to abstract, contribute, and document components that\ncould go into the system, that work is often expected to happen at the end of\na product design cycle. Ha! As if product teams had extra time. And even if\nthey did, they’re probably sprinting to the finish line of their work and\nwould much rather spend the extra time getting to the things they initially\nhad to deprioritize because of the deadline, not doing an act of kindness for\na team they’re not on with results they won’t see. The end of a project is one\nof the worst times to ask any team to do cleanup.\n\nA few years ago, my team and I went to Orlando, Florida’s Disney World to\nspeak at and attend a design conference. We were also at the tail end of some\nproduct work we had been doing, and the only thing we hadn’t finished was our\ndocumentation work. While everyone went to Disney World the next day, we sat\nin our hotel rooms, documenting APIs and UX guidelines. Every time I think of\nsaving the documentation part for last, I remember that I’d rather go to\nDisney World instead. True story.\n\nIf abstraction and contribution and documentation don’t go at the end of the\nprocess, when should they happen? All throughout.\n\nI can hear you scoffing already. “Sure! Document throughout a project! Just\nlike flossing every day and balancing your checkbook once a week.” Fair\nenough, dear reader! In order to make this a habit, you’ll have to formalize\nit a bit. If you’re onboard with everything you’ve read in this chapter so\nfar, you realize that design system work and product design work are all part\nof the same process. Contribution isn’t a separate effort; it’s a step in the\npiloting process.\n\nAllot time for both “Flow weeks” and “Systems weeks” ([Figure\n6.5](chapter6.xhtml#fig6-5a)). Give the product teams 2–3 weeks to get into\nthe flow of solving user needs. In those Flow weeks, the design system team\ncan surface and provide existing components and patterns that save time for\nthose product teams. Then, every 3–4 weeks, the design system team does a\nSystems week, a week where they get to audit any newly created components from\nany of the three pilot teams for eligibility in the design system.\n\n![](../images/fig6-5a.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.5AMagic happens when a connected and safe team gets into a state of\nflow.\n\n![](../images/fig6-5b.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.5BProduct work is most important because it’s a direct line to\ncreating customer value, but scaling good product work for future benefit\nneeds allotted time. Plan a Systems week: One week out of every four to\nextract and abstract the great work being done so that others can make use of\nit, too.\n\nThe criteria for eligibility is simple. For each component candidate, ask,\n“Can three other teams at this company use this component right now?” If not,\ndon’t add it to the design system.\n\nBring on the groans. “What strict criteria! Surely, we have to be more forward\nthinking than that?” I get the sentiment. But a strict rule helps avoid the\ntrap most organizations fall into. Remember, most design system graveyards are\nfull of design systems that have lots of components that no one uses. The\nnuance is that they’re full of components that someone might use someday. But\n“someday” never arrives. By keeping your design system contribution criteria\nfocused on the needs _right now_ , you’re much more poised to create a system\nthat gets immediately adopted because the need is immediate.\n\n(That said, when I work with teams that understand that nuance, then we’ll\nslightly expand the criteria to be, “Can another team at this company use this\ncomponent this quarter?” Yeah, I’m a big softy.)\n\nFor all of the components that do fit the criteria of being used now or within\nthe quarter, the rest of this Systems week gives the design system the time to\ntake components that were likely made for a specific use case and abstract the\ndesign and code to be more broadly applicable and flexible for other teams.\nThis is also the week to write any relevant documentation for just a handful\nof new components, as opposed to waiting until the end of a whole product\ncycle and needing to write documentation for dozens or even hundreds of new\ncomponents. (Remember and say it with me: “We want to go to Disney World.”)\n\nSystems week doesn’t just make time for the abstraction and documentation\nwork; it carves out space to spread the word about the newly available\nupdates. If a component falls in the forest … the analogy stinks but hopefully\nyou get the idea. Tell people there are new options available to them! Every\norganization will have a different vehicle for this among email updates, Slack\nchannel posts, wiki entries, show-and-tell ceremonies, and much more. But the\nimportant thing here is that there’s dedicated time allocated to effort that\noften gets left until last.\n\nAnd maybe you could floss your teeth a little more, too.\n\n### Where and How Should These Design System Activities Be Done?\n\nPhew! That’s a lot of paradigm shifting in the “who” and “when” of design\nsystems.\n\nLuckily, I can ease off the gas in this “where” and “how” section. While the\n“who” and “when” are the stuff teams usually get wrong, the “where” and “how”\nare the stuff that usually goes well! Your organization probably already has a\ndecent starting point of a product design process that defines a lot of the\n“where” and “how” already:\n\n  * How should we review ongoing work as a team?\n  * Where do we build our prototypes?\n  * How can our executive sponsors track our work?\n  * Where do customers go to give feedback on new product features?\n\nHopefully, you have a confident reaction looking at this list, because these\nare the kinds of things that are already figured out at your organization. And\nthey have a place in the workflow, too; these are the kinds of best practices\nthat your design system team can “collect” as things to continue doing. These\nare the kinds of ways that product design influences the design system, and\nthe design system influences product design. It’s that healthy mix of some new\nthings and some established things that give you good momentum for the next\nproduct cycle.\n\n## A Design System Governance and Contribution Template\n\nThat’s a lot to digest! How do you put it all together?\n\nPick a date for your first Systems week. The first activity of this first\nSystems week will be to document—no, chronicle—how you currently work. Resist\nthe urge to create a new way of working, even if your current process is less\nthan ideal. If you can’t resist that urge, document two versions: the current\nprocess and the new, ideal one. Document the what, why, who, when, where and\nhow of each activity. As a starting point, you can use this extensive starting\npoint/flowchart ([Figure 6.6](chapter6.xhtml#fig6-6)).\n\n![](../images/fig6-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.6A flowchart for how design system teams and product teams can work\ntogether.\n\nA lot of what’s in this template will be irrelevant or inappropriate to your\norganization. That’s OK; prioritize documenting what’s more fitting for you\nover sticking to the items in this template. It matters less what you\nspecifically do. It matters more that you all agree on something. Whatever you\nagree on, document it. Just like the piloting process, do a thing, and then\nwrite it down. After the first Systems week is over, try to follow the process\nyou captured in the next Flow week. Make edits and additions in the next\nSystems week (or sooner) as you discover them. This is how you build the\norganization muscles and habits to move past a design system as a tool and\nmore into how design systems can become an ingrained practice.\n\n## Design System as Canon and the Expanded Universe\n\nThe _Star Wars_ saga by George Lucas has been a cultural tidal wave since the\noriginal movie debuted in 1977. Since then, a plethora of stories have been\nwritten about the _Star Wars_ universe and characters, some by Lucasfilm (and\nlater by acquiring company Disney) and others by other companies and the\ngeneral fan population. Which begs the question: Which stories are “official,”\nand which are not?\n\nTo answer that question, Lucasfilm established the idea of “canon” in 1994. As\ndefined by online encyclopedia Wookiepedia, _Star Wars_ canon is the set of\nimmovable objects of _Star Wars_ history, the characters and events to which\nall other tales must align. _Star Wars_ canon includes the six _Star Wars_\nfilms; the _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ television series and film; novels\n(where they align with what is seen on-screen); and Part I of the short story\n_Blade Squadron_. In short, canon is gospel. Everything else is considered\npart of the “Expanded Universe” (later rebranded to “Legends”), i.e., they’re\nallowed and encouraged to exist even though they’re not part of canon.\n\nThe overall awareness of _Star Wars_ generally reflects canon, too ([Figure\n6.7](chapter6.xhtml#fig6-7)). Most people know canon characters Darth Vader\nand Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker and Yoda, but Expanded Universe\ncharacters Cindel Towani or DRN-38 or Nadia Grell are much less familiar, even\nthough they’re crucial to their storylines.\n\nThe model of what is and isn’t canon holds well for design systems as well. At\nevery point, your design system should contain what’s canon, the official\ncomponents and patterns and processes to which everything else must align.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that everything has to go in the design system. In fact,\nsome stuff shouldn’t go into the design system. Every organization needs an\nexpanded universe of components, ones that are crucial to their own local\nstories.\n\nDeciding what components, patterns, and processes get promoted to canon\nthrough a pilot-based governance and contribution workflow is how your design\nsystem starts to become the story of how your organization makes valuable\ndigital interfaces for your customers.\n\n![](../images/fig6-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 6.7Canon and noncanon Star Wars characters are pictured here. Clockwise\nfrom top left: Nadia Grell, Darth Vader, BZ-9D, Yoda, Dash Rendar, Princess\nLeia.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * Start filling out the governance and contribution template with your team. How standardized is this workflow across the organization? What can you do to move more teams closer to one official story of how you make digital interfaces?\n  * Among the “who,” “what,” “where,” “when,” and “why” of governance, which one has been or will be easiest for you and your team? Which one has been or will be the most difficult?\n\n  1. 1 “Make WordPress Core,” Automattic, July 31, 2023, <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset>\n\n  2. 2 Chuck Grimmett, “Some WordPress Core Contributor Stats,” September 24, 2022, <https://cagrimmett.com/data-viz/2022/09/24/some-wp-core-contributor-stats/>\n\n  3. 3 Inayaili de León, “Getting Vanilla Ready for v1: The Roadmap,” July 8, 2016, <https://medium.com/@yaili/getting-vanilla-ready-for-v1-the-roadmap-8c0f4433f2f8>\n\n  4. 4 Nathan Curtis, “Team Models for Scaling a Design System,” September 17, 2015, <https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/team-models-for-scaling-a-design-system-2cf9d03be6a0>\n\n  5. 5 Jina Anne, “The Salesforce Team Model for Scaling a Design System,” October 13, 2015, <https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/the-salesforce-team-model-for-scaling-a-design-system-d89c2a2d404b>\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 7 Roles and Responsibilities\n\nFront-end Engineering Is More Important Than Visual Design\n\nFront-end Engineering Is More Important Than Back-end Engineering\n\nFront-end Engineering: The Missing Skill Set\n\nRebranding the “Front-end Engineer”\n\nPsychological Safety\n\nEcosystem Engineers\n\nThree-legged Stools\n\nOther Roles on a Design System Team\n\nDesign System Annual Budgeting\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nSeventeen software engineers met in early 2001 to discuss how work could and\nshould get done, and out popped the “Manifesto for Agile Software\nDevelopment”—often shortened to “The Agile Manifesto”—a series of principles\nand guidelines to shepherd software projects. The manifesto led with these\nfour main tenets:\n\n  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\n  * Working software over comprehensive documentation\n  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\n  * Responding to change over following a plan\n\nMany organizations have adopted Agile wholesale as their standard of shipping\nsoftware, so design system practices need to effectively fit within the\ncontext of Agile. When it comes to design systems, my favorite Agile Manifesto\nprinciple and the one I focus on most is the second, because it’s the one that\nmost teams seem to forget and the one that unlocks the most benefits when done\nwell. The manifesto makes a point to say, “While there is value in the items\non the right, we value the items on the left more.” But most design system\nteams and product teams seem to indicate that documentation is more important\nthan working software.\n\nDon’t believe me? Look at the output that team members are responsible for.\nInformation architects make diagrams. Writers make documents. Product managers\nwrite requirements. Strategists craft briefs. Designers make comps. Engineers\nwrite code.\n\nWho on the team actually makes working software? Only the engineers. Every\nother role is largely one of documentation ([Figure\n7.1](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-1)). What is a wireframe? Documentation about how a\nsite or an app should function. What is a comp? Documentation about what a\npiece of software should look like.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation? Doesn’t look like it,\naccording to our team makeup. Every role primarily makes documentation except\nengineers. Most teams are overindexed on documenters.\n\nIt often doesn’t look like teams value software over documentation, according\nto the time spent on a project or sprint. Engineers often get the least amount\nof time on a project. Extra time spent on discovery or design usually eats\ninto engineering time without moving a deadline or reducing scope. These are\nthe kinds of signals that indicate where priority truly lies.\n\n![](../images/fig7-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.1Most digital team members make documentation, but only engineers\nmake code, the real thing for users to interact with.\n\nPrioritizing working software is prioritizing things that your organization’s\ncustomers can use. The more time your team spends writing\ndocumentation—especially documentation that’s created before software is\nmade—the longer it will take for customers to interact with your products.\nThis is why the piloting we discussed in [Chapter 5](chapter5.xhtml),\n“Pilots—The Best Way to Start and Sustain a Design System,” is so important:\nit prioritizes adoption and use as quickly as possible. If your organization\nhas a culture of documentation over software, you can model the opposite—a\nculture of relentless focus on shipping working software—by starting it with\nyour design system team.\n\nThe irony of our industry’s ever-expanding team roles is that there’s only one\nrole that you need on a team: the one that writes HTML.\n\n## Front-end Engineering Is More Important Than Visual Design\n\nIn 2005, developer Noah Stokes created a marvel of a personal website ([Figure\n7.2](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-2)).\n\n![](../images/fig7-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.2Noah Stokes’s 2005 website is a full product.\n\nNoah’s website was just HTML. There’s no CSS file attached to it. There’s some\nanimation of a line that goes back and forth from the left to the right edges\nof the screen, but it’s not powered by fancy new CSS or JavaScript animation …\nit’s a good ol’ `<marquee>` element.\n\nNoah’s website is a complete product. Did he need a design comp? Nope. Could a\ndesigner have made this website better? Possibly. (Although there’s a good\nargument for why this is probably the best this site could be.) Could an\ninformation architect make this better? Probably. Could more backend logic\nmake this better? Probably. But all the things that I’m talking about are to\nmake it better, not to make it. Design, IA, strategy: all of those are\noptimizations on software. And as every good engineer knows, you optimize\nafterward.\n\nYou don’t start by optimizing; there’s nothing to optimize yet. What does a\ntrue, minimal viable web product look like? A plain old HTML document.\n\nWhen it comes to making web products, front-end engineering is more important\nthan visual design.\n\n“But Dan … can you really draw that conclusion from a personal website created\nin 2005?” Fair point, dear reader. Allow me to point you to some more\nsupporting evidence.\n\nThe general public often forgets that entrepreneur and investor Jeff Bezos\nstarted as computer engineer Jeff Bezos. The first Amazon website launched in\n1995 was just HTML with a handful of HTML-based styling attributes ([Figure\n7.3](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-3)). Bezos’s original job postings on Usenet for help\nwith the product asked for “C/C++/Unix developers” who have “familiarity with\nweb servers and HTML.” No mention of design or strategy or anything like that;\nthey weren’t necessary to create the foundations for one of the most\ninfluential products in the history of the world.\n\n![](../images/fig7-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.3The original [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) from 1995.\n\n(What’s really gonna break your brain is the fact that many of the world’s\nmost popular software products—eBay, Craigslist, Wikipedia—still stay pretty\nfaithful to their original “undesigned” forms. Could there be a tie between\nthe ones who best understand the idea of prioritizing working software and\nthose who have lasting success?)\n\n## Front-end Engineering Is More Important Than Back-end Engineering\n\nDeveloper Mandy Michael wrote a fantastic article in 2017 entitled “Is There\nAny Value in People Who Cannot Write JavaScript?” where she lamented the fact\nthat the majority of current job openings necessitate JavaScript knowledge.1 I\nthink part of the subtext that Mandy was raising is this: Are HTML and CSS as\nimportant as JavaScript?\n\nI say, “Heck yes!”\n\nBack-end languages—and I sort of include JavaScript in there for now—are\nincredibly powerful, but there’s a reason that all of them have at least one\nmethod of outputting HTML. Until you output HTML—whether it’s the Echo\nfunction in PHP or Return method in React, or whatever language you’re\nusing—the product isn’t a real web product until you put something on the\nscreen that people can interact with. And what is that thing? HTML. Whether\ngenerated by the server or the client, you need HTML to use anything on the\nweb. When I’m talking to or working with people who are new to the industry\nand they ask me what’s the first thing they should learn, I always say HTML.\nIf you’re trying to make web products, all roads lead to HTML.\n\nWhen it comes to making web products, front-end languages are more important\nthan back-end languages.\n\n## Front-end Engineering: The Missing Skill Set\n\nIf your team consists of designers that work in tools like Figma or Sketch and\nyou also have engineers that configure Webpack builds and write .net or Java,\nyou’re missing a core skill set that will allow you to take the most advantage\nof a design system.\n\nIn order to make the most of a design system, you have to prioritize front-end\ndevelopment.\n\nThat might mean expanding your designers’ responsibilities to include coding\nHTML and CSS, or convincing everyone that front-end is “real programming,” or\nhiring front-end engineers that already have that specialty. Either way, you\nhave to invest in front-end design and development. It’s the coupling that\nconnects design, engineering, and customers ([Figure\n7.4](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-4)). Without that investment, you’re missing the most\ncritical part of how digital products built with design systems can create\ncustomer value.\n\n![](../images/fig7-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.4Front-end is where design and engineering converge.\n\n## Rebranding the “Front-end Engineer”\n\nOn May 11, 1996, ValuJet Flight 592 was supposed to fly from Miami to Atlanta.\nInstead, tragically, it crashed in the Florida Everglades, with no survivors\namong the 110 passengers and crew. Following the crash, despite initially\nruling the airline safe, the FAA grounded ValuJet flights for three months.\nUpon further investigation, the FAA found that ValuJet often utilized\ndangerous cost-cutting measures. They didn’t train employees well and relied\non the cheapest labor they could find for maintenance. The company quickly\ndeveloped a reputation for its delinquent safety. When people thought of\nValuJet, they thought of untrustworthiness. That was the gut feeling people\nhad about it; untrustworthiness was its brand.\n\nIn 1997—a year later—ValuJet acquired AirTran Airways, and they actually took\nthe smaller airline’s name. The original name was too toxic to keep around.\nThe brand of ValuJet had become synonymous with danger. They had to rebrand\nbecause they had to change people’s gut feeling about them.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s another name that’s starting to become toxic in our\nindustry. It’s well-intentioned and it actually does mean what it’s supposed\nto, but despite the best of intentions, our industry is starting to have the\nwrong gut feeling about it.\n\nI think it’s time to rebrand the “front-end engineer.”\n\nThe title is starting to have the connotation that front-end skills aren’t\nuseful skills. We’re never more than a few days away from Twitter arguments\nabout whether writing HTML and CSS is “real programming.” Ugh. (It is.)\n\nWe want a title that says that the skills this person possesses are important.\nWe might even acknowledge that it’s not the same as other programming, but\nit’s equally as valuable, if not more or even most valuable, as I made an\nargument for in the beginning of this chapter. We want to communicate that\nthis person is involved in crafting the product vision, as well as the\ninterface the users will interact with.\n\nIf you think about it for a bit, you’ll realize that lots of organizations\nalready have a word for this. That word is …\n\n_Designer._\n\nWhen I’m working with teams that want to be more collaboratively successful at\nmaking web products, one of the first things I suggest is moving all front-end\nengineers to the design team and changing their titles to “Designer.” It takes\na little while to warm up to the idea and a little more time to implement, but\nit’s amazing to see how much confidence a front-end engineer can get when\npeople think of them—and when they think of themselves—as designers.\n\nIt’s easy to justify, too.\n\n### Front-end Engineers as Designers\n\nLook across your current design team. Perhaps one of your designers, Kate,\nuses Sketch. Maybe another designer, Miles, uses Photoshop (I know, I know).\nYet another designer, Kamala, uses Figma.\n\nIt’s easy to make a case for why front-end engineer Jane—who primarily uses\nHTML5 as her design tool—can join this team as a designer, too. All of these\npeople design interfaces for users. All of them use different tools. But\nbecause they’re all different, they’re all the same: they’re all designers\n([Figure 7.5](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-5)).\n\n![](../images/fig7-5.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.5Diverse teams allow people to be different in a way that’s delicious\ntogether.\n\nWhat’s that you say? Everyone on your design team uses Sketch because it’s\nmore efficient when everyone’s alike? You’re right: that would make it\ndifficult for Jane to join this team, because she’s different from everyone\nelse. And that’s how easy it is to eliminate diversity from a team. When you\nforce—or worse, encourage—people who think and act the same to group together,\nit very obviously leaves out the ones who aren’t like everyone else ([Figure\n7.6](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-6)). It creates outcasts. It creates stale and\nmundane thinking.\n\nBut if you can shape a group with different skills and different backgrounds\nand different approaches, now you’ve got something really special. This is a\nreally effective way to design a team.\n\n![](../images/fig7-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.6Making people assimilate to be the same easily creates outcasts.\n\nCompare this to the way we typically design our teams. We try to make the\ncategories really specific but the skills really broad within them. Like, if\nyou’re a visual designer, you have to be all of a visual designer.\n\nThis rarely works because people don’t fit neatly into little boxes. Scott\nBelsky, the founder of work showcase site Behance and chief product officer at\nAdobe, describes it like this: “… a lot of the magic I’ve observed in teams\nover the years happens when the talent stack is collapsed—when a designer also\ncodes, when an engineer has a growth hack skill set, when a product leader is\ngreat at copy. unfortunately (sic), traditional org structures are liable to\nsuppress such overlaps of roles instead of running w/ them. but the best\nmodern orgs tailor the structure of each product team to the actual people and\noverlaps they’re lucky enough to have.”\n\nInevitably, you’ll have a visual designer who can do a little UX, too, but\ncan’t art direct very well yet. Or a front-end engineer who doesn’t know\nJavaScript but is really into deployment tools ([Figure\n7.7](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-7)).\n\n![](../images/fig7-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.7Making people fit neatly into boxes means everyone falls short.\n\nRather than making the boxes specific and trying to fill them broadly, do the\nopposite: make the roles broad and then fill them specifically.\n\nOne configuration I’ve recommended is that every maker on the team is either a\ndesigner or an engineer. Think of this more like a spectrum than binary. Plot\npeople, not roles. Think of it like a heat map ([Figure\n7.8](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-8)).\n\n![](../images/fig7-8.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.8When the roles are broad, people can occupy their own space within\nthem.\n\n  * Kate is a strong user interface designer and can do a lot of UX thinking on her own. She can even tweak some CSS to get the details right if someone else can initially write it.\n  * Miles is kind of an old-school art director: he likes writing his own copy while doing broad stroke design, but he’s the first to admit that he’s not good at the details.\n  * Jane does most of her designing in the browser and CodePen with HTML and CSS. She knows a tiny bit about writing JavaScript from scratch but is pretty proficient editing it and finding snippets on the web to drop in and modify.\n\nJane blurs the lines between design and engineering, but because her skills\nfall more on the design end than engineer, she can call herself a designer.\nIt’s her choice.\n\nThis is a much more realistic visualization of your team’s strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\nThis is also only one version of a spectrum. Instead of plotting against a\n“design to engineering” spectrum, you can map this to your delivery process\n([Figure 7.9](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-9))—for example: planning, sketching,\nbuilding, deploying. And you’ll see that this is much more of a continuum than\nspecific sections. Planning blends right into sketching, which blends into\nbuilding.\n\n![](../images/fig7-9.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.9There are many more configurations for where people fit on a team\nother than just job descriptions.\n\nPerhaps converting front-end engineers to designers is more than your\norganization can culturally stomach right now. That’s fair! Here are some\nalternate ways to make a framing shift for the role of front-end engineer that\nmay be easier to implement.\n\n### Front of the Front-End\n\nFront-end designer Brad Frost quipped on web development podcast “ShopTalk\nShow” that “front-end engineering” should be split into “front-of-the-front-\nend” and “back-of-the-front-end,”2 and those terms seemed to have gained\ntraction! He then went on to define those terms, both collectively and\nindividually:\n\n  * A front-of-the-front-end developer determines the look and feel of a button, while a back-of-the-front-end developer determines what happens when that button is clicked.\n  * A front-of-the-front-end developer is a web developer who specializes in writing HTML, CSS, and presentational JavaScript code.\n  * A back-of-the-front-end developer is a web developer who specializes in writing JavaScript code necessary to make a web application function properly.\n\nConsider adding these terms to your team’s vocabulary—if not official\ntitles—to create clarity in roles and responsibilities.\n\n### The Hammer and the Chisel\n\nSparkbox is an agency in Dayton, Ohio, that does excellent web and design\nsystem work. They have these concepts called the “Hammer and the Chisel.”3\nThese aren’t titles, mind you: they still have titles like “Frontend Designer”\nand “Developer,” but “Hammer” and “Chisel” describe how they think of their\nwork.\n\nHere’s how front-end designers Philip Zastrow and Andrew Spencer describe it:\n“The Hammer puts in the overall HTML and CSS structure for our base of layout\nand overall look and feel of components. The Chisel takes the Hammer’s work\nand refines it and makes it more polished and aligned with the original design\nvision. It puts a client in a better position to see the progress of the site\nand see refinement throughout the process. They can see the vision come to\nlife.”\n\n## Psychological Safety\n\nIn 2013, a team within Google’s People Operations—that’s Google’s version of\n“human resources”—set out to determine what makes for effective teams at\nGoogle. Their hypothesis was that it would be something like a good mix of\nseniority, skill, enthusiasm, and motivation.\n\nBut that wasn’t the case at all. What turned out to be the most successful\npredictor of top performing teams? Psychological safety. Teams where people\nfelt safe—where they wouldn’t get fired or ridiculed or ostracized for their\nideas, work, and selves—were the highest performing.\n\nChanging your workflow and team dynamic isn’t just to make design and\ndevelopment better and faster. Work should be more exciting, fulfilling,\ninnovative, and ultimately fun. That starts with safety, knowing that you’re\nall in it together, and you have each other’s backs.\n\nIn order to start creating more safety within your teams, be the first to\nextend that safety to others. Many teams employ the Agile ritual of “daily\nstandups,” using a format of sharing what you did yesterday, what you’re doing\ntoday, and what blockers stand in your way. Add this new part: What risk did I\ntake yesterday? This will both normalize that taking risks is a part of\neveryone’s job as well as allow everyone an equal opportunity to share their\nsuccesses and failures. Not every risk is worth taking, and not every risk\nturns out to be a success. That’s OK. Expose the dynamic that it’s OK.\n\nWhile I’ve rarely met anyone that disagrees with the general idea of\nsupporting more psychological safety within their teams, the specific places\nthat the obstacles sneak up in design system work are worth addressing. One of\nthe first places to look is where a new skill is being attempted. To our\nworkflow changes, this might be the first time a designer has written a line\nof code. If you’re an engineer, your first instinct might be to critique that\ncode to point out how it could be better. Beware though: even though your\nintention may be pure, a criticism this early on may discourage that designer\nmore than encourage them and signal that they shouldn’t have tried something\nnew here. Instead of criticizing the code, praise the person. Build up their\nconfidence in trying something new so that they’re more prone to do it again\nand again.\n\nThe same could be true of an engineer who has made a design decision,\nsomething they may not be used to doing. Instead of saying that it still looks\nbad—which it likely will on a first try—affirm the attempt. These affirmations\nset a foundation of safety for your colleagues that will make your\ncollaborations on working software that much more productive.\n\nIf you’re a manager, lead by example. If you’re not a manager, lead by\nexample. Just start doing it. You’ll see everyone start to join in after a few\nweeks.\n\n## Ecosystem Engineers\n\nBeavers are fascinating, aren’t they? They build dams, mostly for protection\nand also to make sure they have food when it gets colder.\n\nEven though it’s not their intention, many other species benefit from what\nthey build. Woodpeckers occupy the trees that beavers excavate. Ducks and\ngeese settle in their old lodges. Their wetlands become homes for herons,\nkingfishers, frogs, lizards, dragonflies, mussels, beetles, and more.\n\nDr. Clive Jones at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies came up with a name\nfor beaver-like creatures who create habitats for others to flourish. He calls\nthem “ecosystem engineers.”\n\nIsn’t that a great name for the people who either intentionally or\nunintentionally create the habitat for others to flourish? I know many a\ndesigner that would and have traded invention for habitat-building. During one\nof my interviews at Facebook years ago, I remember asking a very talented\ndesigner what was interesting to them about working there. They replied,\n“Having the ability to roll out a feature to 100 million users? There’s no\nbigger rush.”\n\nEcosystem engineers are interested in building platforms … quite literally, “a\nraised level surface on which people or things can stand.” Thirty years ago,\nSir Tim Berners-Lee used the existing technology of HTTP and a newly\ntransformed version of SGML called HTML and stacked them together as a\nplatform to create the World Wide Web. Fifteen years ago, it only took six\nmonths to build the initial version of YouTube because it stood on the\nexisting platform of the web.\n\nIf you’re the kind of person who likes building platforms to help others\nsucceed, a design system team might be the right place for you.\n\n## Three-legged Stools\n\nIn his article “Defining Product Design,” former VP of Design at Airbnb Alex\nSchleifer describes the making of a good product like this:4\n\nThree elements define a product: the business, the code, and the pixels. Give\neach a voice in all product decisions. Fuse Engineering, Product, and Design\nfrom the start.\n\nThe team should resemble a three-legged stool, in which each leg represents\none of the three areas that helps build a product. If it’s done from the\nstart, each function can grow in parallel and proper ratio as the broader\norganization scales.\n\nWithout those strategies from the onset, you’re bound to create an unstable\nstool down the line, which, in this case, is a shaky product. That might be\nbecause no design role was developed at the onset or was added on after the\nproduct—and the engineering and product management teams—has already matured\nand grown. The best way to avoid a wobbly seat (or product) is to build each\nstool with three legs from the get-go.\n\nDesign systems intentionally blend Design, Engineering, and Product in order\nto succeed. Great design system teams balance growing the team with an eye\ntoward how Design, Engineering, and Product are doing at the organization so\nthe design system team can be in lockstep with them … not behind, but not\nahead either.\n\nCreating or even using a design system one phase at a time is like building a\nstool one leg at a time; the only time the stool is stable is at the very end.\nInstead, following a more collaborative workflow always keeps the stool\nbalanced and growing at a steady, equivalent rate.\n\n## Other Roles on a Design System Team\n\nEarlier in the chapter, I highlighted the importance of a close-knit designer\n+ engineer workflow. It’s no surprise then that design system teams often\nstart with these two roles. Where does the team go from there? How and when\ndoes a design system team grow beyond this?\n\n### The Product Owner\n\nGenerally, the next role to add is a design system product owner. Design and\nengineering are often very tactical roles, and so they tend to want or need a\nproduct owner or someone who can walk the hallways and do some of the\nevangelism while they’re actually doing some of the “on-the-ground” work of\ncomponentry ([Figure 7.10](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-10)).\n\n![](../images/fig7-10.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.10A product owner is usually the first role needed on a design system\nteam outside of a founding designer and engineer.\n\nThat product owner can come from many different places for many different\nreasons:\n\n  * The original designer or engineer on this team may become the product owner. This kind of design system product owner tends to excel at fielding requests from features teams, largely because of their history, context, and familiarity with the system.\n  * An external product manager may join the team to become the product owner, turning the original dynamic duo into a trio, commonly known as the famed _product triad_ structure. This kind of product owner fits well on a team where the original designer and engineer have little familiarity or interest in focusing on business outcomes.\n  * An external product manager with design, engineering, or product background may join the team in more of a management capacity. This kind of product owner works well with team members who may be talented but need some structure and support to continue to get things done.\n\nThe most important job of a product owner on a design system team is to\nunderstand how to weave the design system into the way business gets done at\nthe organization. That means understanding feature teams’ roadmaps, as well as\nthe design system team members’ capabilities, enough to plot out where the two\ncan naturally intersect.\n\n### More Engineering and Design Help\n\nFor successful design system teams that start to see more interest from\nfeature teams, the workload tends to grow. Generally, that starts on the\nengineering side: give us more components we can implement into our features.\nAnother engineer helps alleviate that burden to share the work with the\ninitial engineer ([Figure 7.11](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-11)). Design help often\ngoes hand-in-hand with that.\n\n![](../images/fig7-11.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.11More production help is often needed as a design system grows.\n\n### Producers/Project Managers\n\nThe next stage tends to see a need for some more on-the-ground management.\nThis is different from the design system product owner, whose focus is on\ntalking to other teams and evangelizing it as a whole, but teams often need\nsomeone to help manage the work at an in-the-weeds level as the team grows.\nThat role is often a producer or project manager ([Figure\n7.12](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-12)) who ties all of the individual threads together\nto make sure that it’s all moving toward the product owner’s vision for the\ndesign system. For teams that are run in an Agile way, the producer/project\nmanager is often a scrum master, someone who facilitates activities and\nrituals like sprint planning and standup for the team.\n\nThis person may also be a DesignOps professional. In the words of Atlassian’s\nHead of DesignOps, Dominique Ward, DesignOps is the organization typically\ncharged with “designing design and designing designers.” DesignOps governs\nareas like design process, team structure and culture, hiring, and design\ntools—which may include design systems, among other things. (See sidebar: “A\nConversation with Michelle Chin about DesignOps.”)\n\n![](../images/fig7-12.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.12As the team grows, they’ll need help coordinating and\noperationalizing their work.\n\nA CONVERSATION WITH MICHELLE CHIN ABOUT DESIGNOPS\n\n![](../images/pg132.jpg)\n\n_Michelle Chin is a design advocate at zeroheight, a design system\ndocumentation platform. She’s been a product designer, design manager,\nDesignOps manager, strategist, and more. I asked her a few questions about her\nexperience with DesignOps and why it’s so important._\n\nWhat is DesignOps?\n\nDesignOps is the specialized support services that help ensure that the design\nteam can do its best. If you consider individual contributors on the design\nteam (e.g., designers, researchers, content people, etc.) as professional\nathletes, DesignOps people are the athletic trainers, nutritionists, etc. They\nhave special skills that allow individual contributors to focus on their craft\nand set them up for success.\n\nWhat has your experience with DesignOps been like?\n\nThere’s DesignOps as a role, and there’s DesignOps the work. So even when I\nwasn’t in a specific DesignOps role, I usually did some operational work to\nhelp improve team processes. While working at Citrix, some DesignOps side\nprojects included creating checklists to ensure accessibility design, new hire\nonboarding, or facilitating workshops to help define our team’s critique\nculture.\n\nWhen I became a design manager at Citrix, DesignOps became a more official\npart of my work. However, as design managers, so much of our work focused on\ndesign strategy and people management that we often neglected DesignOps\nprojects. We tried to fit in initiatives where we could but never felt we\ncould give them the proper attention. As a manager, you want to do right by\nyour team, and knowing you weren’t didn’t feel great.\n\nI attended the DesignOps Summit a few times and always wondered if DesignOps\nwas something I could pursue. I loved managing and guiding people in their\ncareers, but I saw DesignOps as a way to help empower individual contributors\n(ICs) even further. I worked with my manager on evolving my career toward a\nDesignOps path.\n\nWe figured out how to make DesignOps a practice on our team. Our idea proposed\nthat the DesignOps responsibility usually asked of design managers would shift\nsolely to me. It would give them more time to focus on design strategy and\npeople management. Then I could exclusively concentrate on DesignOps, and we\ncould get several design org initiatives done with the attention and quality\nthe team deserved.\n\nI absolutely loved this transition and had so much fun in my role. In some\nways, it felt like finding my “true calling.” Unlike my work designing\nenterprise software, I saw my “users” (the design team) daily. So, I could see\nthe direct impact I was making and had first-hand visibility for when we\nneeded to pivot. Knowing I was helping them succeed at doing amazing design\nwork felt satisfying.\n\nThere were certainly challenges, though. I was a DesignOps team of one, and\nDesignOps was a new concept for many. So, in addition to driving initiatives\nand working on projects, I did a lot of educating, advocating, and\nexpectation-setting not just within the design org but also with other\ndepartments. It was also tough being a team of one. Because I was the only one\nleading an org-wide initiative, people often thought it was a personal\nproject. So, some felt it was less of a priority when the project was really\nto benefit the whole team. I still enjoyed it, and even as a team of one, I\nfound friends through the DesignOps Assembly Slack community.\n\nI ended up pivoting away from DesignOps when I joined zeroheight. My focus is\nmore on consulting, writing best practices, and building a community. But my\nrole as a design advocate leans heavily into my experience in DesignOps and\ndesign systems. But it’s hard to give up once you develop a knack for\noperationalizing. I’m constantly trying to find ways to improve processes for\nour team.\n\nHow do DesignOps and Design Systems relate to one another?\n\nIn some ways, DesignOps relates to design systems; in others, they don’t.\nPhilosophically, people can see design systems as a solution that helps\nICs/teams work more effectively to focus on solving challenges. In that\nrespect, it’s like DesignOps.\n\nBut fundamentally, a considerable amount of design work is involved in\ncreating a design system. Unless the DesignOps person was previously a\ndesigner, it would be challenging for them to contribute to building the\nactual parts of the design system. Design systems can happen without having a\ndesign, code, or content background.\n\nThat’s not to say design systems don’t need DesignOps. It’s the opposite.\nDesignOps people can contribute to design systems in many other ways. They’re\nessential in scaling a design system and design system team. For example,\ntheir expertise can help identify and create governance processes, manage the\nteam’s workload and backlog, coordinate with cross-functional partners, and\nincrease adoption.\n\nHow is DesignOps different from Design or Product Design?\n\nDesignOps is more like service design; both are design and product design\nadjacent. So, you often apply the same design thinking principles: understand\nyour users, brainstorm solutions, pilot ideas, etc. Instead of creating\nsolutions as a feature or app, your solutions are templates, processes, or\nplaybooks. Many DesignOps practitioners were previously designers. So, I think\nof it as being a designer with different tools and challenges.\n\nWhat areas are DesignOps concerned with?\n\nThis can feel muddy when there’s a small team, and DesignOps people feel like\nthey do a little of everything. But there are two focus areas of DesignOps:\nTeamOps and ProductOps.\n\nIn TeamOps, practitioners focus on holistic initiatives that benefit the\ndesign org horizontally. Some aspects include hiring, onboarding, tool\nprocurement, team culture, learning and development, process standardization,\ndesign systems, budget, or illustration alignment. Anything that needs org-\nwide alignment is where they can help.\n\nIn ProductOps, practitioners work closely with designers supporting a specific\nproduct. So, they’re more concerned with ensuring that designers can focus on\ngetting their work done, removing blockers, and negotiating with cross-\nfunctional stakeholders. Depending on the company, they might handle project\nmanagement tasks.\n\nWhat traits, skills, or experience make for a successful DesignOps\nprofessional?\n\nAs you can imagine, DesignOps is a very people-oriented role. You can still be\nan introvert (like me) and do well, but the crucial skill you need is change\nmanagement facilitation. Success is more than creating a process; it’s getting\npeople brought in and adjusted to the process.\n\nIn terms of traits, people who thrive in chaos do well. DesignOps people love\njumping into a situation and figuring out how they can help create calm. Being\nflexible and easygoing helps, too. Implementing change is a process, and how\nteams react to change can differ from project to project. DesignOps people\nneed to be flexible, patient, and ready to pivot.\n\nWhen it comes to experience, having a design background is helpful in\nunderstanding context, having empathy, or building trust. But it’s definitely\nnot necessary! I’ve met some fantastic DesignOps people who came from\nnondesign disciplines.\n\nWhy is DesignOps important?\n\nOverall, DesignOps helps keep a design team running smoothly. Although there\nmight be no formal DesignOps role, someone is doing DesignOps work to help the\nteam succeed. Even if the managers and ICs are more than capable of procuring\nsoftware and other operational tasks, these tasks take up time, cause a lot of\ncontext switching, and distract them from their main responsibilities. Having\nDesignOps practitioners unburdens managers and ICs, so they can focus on their\ncraft.\n\nDesignOps as a role or team is also vital to help a team grow or maintain\nconsistency at scale. When a dedicated team handles DesignOps, the org can\nstay aligned and adapt to changes (e.g., switching to a new tool) efficiently\nand smoothly.\n\nWhat’s easy about DesignOps?\n\nThe easiest thing about DesignOps is having access to your “users.” As a\nproduct designer, we’d have to recruit users for any feedback, which takes\ntime and effort. But in DesignOps, if I have a question, need feedback, or\nwant to try something out, I only have to ping someone on Slack or drop in on\na team meeting. I can also see how things work in real time to identify what’s\ngoing well and where we may need to pivot.\n\nWhat’s difficult about DesignOps?\n\nThe hardest part is change management. Change can be difficult for people,\neven if they know it’s for the better. For any arduous change, I try to make\nthings fun and find time to celebrate any wins along the way. At a previous\ncompany, we were transitioning from several different cloud-based tools.\nPeople were skeptical the first time we migrated from one tool to its\nreplacement. I get it, it was a lot of work, people would have to learn a\nwhole new tool, and even though this is something they wanted, it never seems\nlike a good time to shift workflows and mindsets. But to make things more\nenjoyable, we had working sessions, created Miro boards for adding GIFs and\ncocktail recipes based on their moods, and achievement boards for learning new\nskills. We even had a celebration party at the end and gave away prizes.\n\nFor the next tool transition, things were much more manageable. By then,\nDesignOps had built trust, and people knew we were trying to make things as\npainless as possible.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a team or organization that doesn’t have a\nDesignOps team?\n\nThe size of a design org will indicate if they need a DesignOps person or\nteam. If your team is rapidly growing, I’d strongly consider looking to add\nDesignOps. A good ratio might be one DesignOps person for every 1–2 design\nmanagers as a start. Because not everyone knows what DesignOps is or the value\nthey bring, it can take a while to get the buy-in needed. Planting that seed\nearlier is helpful, so when the time for headcount comes up, the ask is not a\nsurprise to anyone.\n\nI’d also check in with your management team to see how they’re doing. If they\ncannot get to the DesignOps projects they’d like to, it’s a good sign that\nit’s time to bring someone in. If you have someone internally interested in\nshifting to this role, it might be hard to make a case for this. It’s not that\nthe stakeholders disagree about the need for DesignOps. But they’re more\nconcerned about the gap this person would leave behind in their current role.\nSo be prepared to have a plan for that.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a team or organization that has DesignOps but\nisn’t sure how to grow it?\n\nIf you have a large, mature DesignOps team, there are a lot of opportunities\nto grow the team. When UX was a budding field, most of us were generalists.\nBut as more teams recognized user experience design, people could specialize\nin a specific aspect like information architecture, interaction design, or\nuser research. Similarly, DesignOps people can start to specialize in\nProductOps or TeamOps. I’ve even met people focusing on one specific aspect of\nTeamOps, like just tool procurement, just learning and development, or just\nevent planning.\n\nOnce a DesignOps team matures, where there isn’t constant chaos that needs\nwrangling, I think there are also more opportunities for DesignOps to become\nmore strategic partners in growing the design org and educating and partnering\nwith other cross-functional departments. Because of their experience with\nchange management, they can help contribute ideas and weigh in on strategies\nthat involve orchestrating change at scale.\n\n### Design and Engineering Hierarchy\n\nWith design system demand increasing and processes being put in place,\nproduction help becomes the largest need for the team. A few more designers\nand engineers help spread the workload around more evenly ([Figure\n7.13](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-13)). This is also usually the point where you’ll\nsee a wider diversity of design and engineering challenges. Bringing more\njunior and mid-level designers and engineers onto the design system team to\ntackle the straightforward component work frees up the more senior designers\nand engineers to focus on more complex design and engineering challenges.\n\n![](../images/fig7-13.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.13As the need for components increase, you’ll need more production\npeople to help keep up with the demand, as well as a hierarchy to support it.\n\n### More Than Just Design, Engineering, and Product\n\nAt this point, the workflow between the design system team and feature teams\nis usually pretty set or at least has a good rhythm being established.\nComponent design and building, implementation, application, adoption … all of\nthat stuff starts to get smoothed out. The design system team stops feeling\nlike they’re behind the needs of feature teams and for the first time feels\nlike they’re getting ahead and can take some deep breaths. This is the time\nyou’ll start to see some extracurricular activities come into play: office\nhours, design system newsletters and Slack channels, public design system\nroadmaps, etc.\n\nIt becomes more evident that other roles outside of the primary function of\ncomponent design and building are critical: business analysis, content\nwriting, quality assurance, etc. ([Figure 7.14](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-14)).\n\n![](../images/fig7-14.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.14An org chart shows a fully cross-disciplinary design system team.\n\nThis is a version of what a mature design system team looks like: a full-\nservice, holistic team that supports an organization-wide internal product.\nMost organizations I’ve worked with take between a year or two to grow to this\npoint. While that might feel slow to some, it’s important that this team grows\norganically with the need. Growing too fast or too slow puts this team out of\nsync with the rest of the organization, and that’s the kiss of death for\ndesign system teams. The more connected a design system team is to the rest of\nthe organization, the more successful and serving it can be.\n\n## Design System Annual Budgeting\n\nAny digital product you use has a team of at least a few people that keep it\nbug-free and ideally even add useful features and functionality over time. In\norder for that to happen, the organization that supports digital product has\nto devote funds to it to keep it going. Design systems are products, and\nthey’re not exempt from this requirement.\n\nMany teams starting a design system journey wonder what kind of funding they\nneed to eventually allocate to sustain a design system practice. For those\nlooking for a simple answer, it takes $1–$1.5 million annually to sustain a\nmature design system practice ([Figure 7.15](chapter7.xhtml#fig7-15)).\n\n![](../images/fig7-15.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 7.15A sample annual budget for a mature, cross-disciplinary design\nsystem team.\n\nLet’s explore the nuances of that.\n\nThe salaries of the people on the team are the biggest cost of a design\nsystem. Because salaries vary widely between geographies and experience,\nthere’s a wide spread here for general applicability, but the good news is\nthat your organization probably—hopefully?—has defined salary bands and\nlevels, so you can plug in those ranges for a number that’s realistic for your\ncompany.\n\nThe next largest cost will be training and professional development for the\nteam. This team will be serving your entire organization at scale, so it’s a\nworthwhile investment to keep them sharp and growing. That includes things\nlike sending them to conferences, acquiring coaching, and having hundreds of\ncopies of this book on hand (wink, wink).\n\nThe last big piece of budgeting for this team is software licenses. Just like\na design system is an investment in a tool that makes other teams’ jobs\neasier, this team will need their own tools. That includes software licenses,\nplug-ins, and other enterprise software for things like design software or\nproject management tracking tools.\n\nThese dollar amounts aren’t chump change. As described in the previous\nchapter, this is a big reason that trying to get buy-in for a design system\neffort before you’ve actually made any traction often flops: it’s difficult to\nask for $1 million without much to show. But if you can conduct some initial\npilots and even measure the time savings, you can extrapolate that data and\nget a relatively realistic projection of the benefits of a design system at\nyour organization. (In the next chapter, I’ll give you a plethora of examples\nof things to track that make this case even stronger.)\n\nOne of my recent clients conducted a few pilots and used the tracked data to\nproject a $40 million savings from an initial investment of $4 million.\nAssuming my math is right, that’s a 1,000% return on investment. If that’s not\nenough to whet your appetite, might I recommend you drop this book and pick up\none about day trading instead?\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * Does your organization undervalue front-end engineering? How can you start to change the perception of value of front-end engineering?\n  * What roles currently exist on your design system team? Sketch out a timeline for when new people could join the team and the budget that needs to be allocated toward the growth of this team.\n\n  1. 1 Mandy Michael, “Is There Any Value in People Who Cannot Write JavaScript?” September 13, 2017, <https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06>\n\n  2. 2 “334: How to Think like a Front-End Developer with Brad Frost,” _ShopTalk Show_ , October 22, 2018, <https://shoptalkshow.com/334/>\n\n  3. 3 Philip Zastrow, “The Hammer and the Chisel,” May 30, 2017, <https://sparkbox.com/foundry/the_hammer_and_the_chisel>\n\n  4. 4 Alex Schleifer, “Defining Product Design: A Dispatch from Airbnb’s Design Chief,” <https://review.firstround.com/defining-product-design-a-dispatch-from-airbnbs-design-chief>\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 8 Process and Workflow for Design Systems\n\nFrameworks over Processes\n\nLess Is More\n\nThe Hot Potato Process\n\nA Change in Tools Needs a Change in Behavior\n\nHot Potato Gotchas\n\nResistance to New Workflow\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nAds from the 1920s were pretty simple. The tried-and-true formula was to\ndescribe a product’s features as a way to appeal to the potential buyer. For\nexample, an ad for the Randolph Radio Corporation’s all-electric radio\ndescribed its “no batteries, chargers, eliminators, acids, or liquids” as a\nheadline ([Figure 8.1](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-1)). The rest of the ad highlighted\nthe “beautiful ampliphonic console,” “genuine walnut cabinets,” and “7-tube\nradio.” It was no frills … and no feelings.\n\nIn those days, a copywriter’s job was to take what their clients wanted to\nsay—usually simply the features of their product—and turn it into a headline\nand body copy. Then they’d hand that copy to an account executive who would\nrun it to another floor and literally slide that paper under a door to the art\ndepartment to “visualize” the final ad. Artists simply followed the\ncopywriter’s orders. It was very rare that the copywriter and the artist would\nactually know each other.\n\n![](../images/fig8-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.1An ad for the Randolph Radio Corporation from the 1920s.\n\nThe accepted truth of advertising at the time was that copy was the idea and\nart was just the visuals that supported the idea. All of that changed when\ncopywriter Bill Bernbach met art director Paul Rand. In their work, they\nsometimes thought the visuals could be the idea, or that the copy was the\nvisuals. Rand once remarked about working with Bernbach, “This was my first\nencounter with a copywriter who understood visual ideas and who didn’t come in\nwith a yellow copy pad and a preconceived notion of what the layout should\nlook like.” Contrary to the siloed dynamic at the time, they’d take lunch\nbreaks together to visit art museums and galleries; they became good friends.\n\nThat camaraderie led to a fresh new kind of advertising approach. Take, for\nexample, an ad they created for Lee Hats ([Figure\n8.2](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-2)). Rather than touting the features of the hat, the\nad celebrated the company for hiring more workers and creating new jobs as a\nway to fight inflation. As far as visuals went, rather than showing an obvious\npicture of a hat, it displayed a solitary balloon, a symbol of the ad’s\nconcept that would resonate with its reader.\n\n![](../images/fig8-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.2A new kind of ad for Lee Hats by Bernbach and Rand.\n\nThat kind of thinking changed the face of advertising forever. You may not\nhave seen Lee Hats’ ads before, but you likely have come across the famous\n“Lemon” ads for Volkswagen ([Figure 8.3](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-3)), created\nyears later at the same agency DDB by Bernbach and Rand’s professional\ndescendants and protégés: copywriter Julian Koenig and art director Helmut\nKrone.\n\n![](../images/fig8-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.3Famous Volkswagen ad from the 1960s.\n\nBernbach and Rand’s collaborative working style led to the birth of the idea\nof “the creative team,” the mutual respect and partnership between art\ndirector and copywriter that tended to yield unique results. Bob Gage, an art\ndirector who worked for DDB, the agency Bernbach co-founded, described it like\nthis:\n\nTwo people who respect each other sit in the same room for a length of time\nand arrive at a state of … free association, where the mention of one idea\nwill lead to another idea, then to another. The art director might suggest a\nheadline, the writer a visual. The entire ad is conceived as a whole, in a\nkind of ping-pong between disciplines.\n\nIsn’t that what we all strive for in our jobs? True collaboration with equals\nand partners? Ideas that build upon others? Why does this seem so far away for\nsome of us? Unfortunately, the way the digital industry has evolved over the\nlast few decades has led us to believe that increased separation in our\ndisciplines is the path to success, when that actually couldn’t be farther\nfrom the truth. One of the reasons I’m so excited about design systems is that\nthey’re an equally powerful and useful tool for both designers and engineers.\n\nDesign systems need multiple disciplines to work together closely to\naccomplish organization- and industry-changing work. Design systems need\npeople like us to think differently about our craft than many currently think.\nWe need to change the dynamic of how we work and move closer together as\ncollaborative partners. If we can shift our thinking to embrace a different\nview of the roles of designers and engineers, a design system team can be a\nprototype of and breeding ground for the most Agile team within an\norganization.\n\nLet’s start by assessing the existing workflow between designers and engineers\nand look for opportunities to work more closely together.\n\n## Frameworks over Processes\n\nProcesses—a series of steps we can repeat to achieve a certain goal—give us\ncomfort. It’s no surprise that we look for processes wherever we can. Sadly,\nthere is no one true process for making a design system. There’s some amount\nof luck involved: getting lucky with team members’ availability and capacity,\nroadmap timing with pilot teams, having the right executives involved to bless\nthe ongoing efforts, and more. That’s what makes design system work emergent,\nand that’s what makes a process elusive.\n\nHowever, where processes don’t do well, as luck is involved, frameworks are a\nhandy tool instead. A framework gives us a supporting structure that luck can\nflow through.\n\nAs an example, Newton’s cradle ([Figure 8.4](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-4)) is a\ndevice where a sphere on one end is released and strikes other spheres that\npush the opposite end upward. As the last sphere returns, the cycle begins\nagain. This is a process, a repeatable system that’s optimized for efficiency,\nnot innovation. It acts the same way every time. Nothing surprising ever\noccurs here.\n\n![](../images/fig8-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.4Newton’s cradle is a predictable process.\n\nHowever, a soccer field or football pitch ([Figure\n8.5](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-5)) is a framework. Every game is played on the same\nkind of field of the same length. The rules are always the same. But what\nhappens within the 90-minutes of the game is always emergent. It can’t be\nfully predicted. We know what the outcomes will be—usually one winner and one\nloser—but how the game arrives there is what makes us all intrigued and\nenamored.\n\nDespite logical reasons to the contrary, digital work still largely relies on\na process, so we must deconstruct that process in order to move toward a\nframework that captivates us all. A simple Google image search for “digital\ndesign process” shows the kinds of steps that teams and organizations claim to\nfollow to success ([Figure 8.6](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-6)).\n\n![](../images/fig8-5.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.5A football pitch/soccer field is a set of constraints that create\ninnovation.\n\n![](../images/fig8-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.6Typical results for “design process.”\n\nWhere does this kind of “common wisdom” come from? Two places.\n\nFirst, it comes from agencies. Take it from me, someone who ran an agency for\na decade and has worked with and at other agencies for the decade before that.\nAgencies are incentivized to make their process look official and complicated\nso that clients think they can’t do it on their own and also so they get paid\na lot of money for it. I’ve been told by well-meaning clients—and also fought\nthe urge regularly myself—to make the process graphic look prettier and more\nofficial so we could justify a higher price for our services.\n\nThe second place this comes from is less sleazy. In the 1970s, TRW Center\nDirector of Engineering Dr. Winston Royce described his ideal process for\nworking on space-flight systems. He was working on space-flight systems, and\nhis job—as he stated in his paper—was to try to deliver projects “at an\noperational state, on-time, and within costs.”1 His paper described a flow\nthat eventually came to be known as a “waterfall” process ([Figure\n8.7](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-7)). He concluded his paper by saying, “I believe in\nthis concept, but the implementation described is risky and invites failure.”\nWhat a buzzkill!\n\n![](../images/fig8-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.7The original waterfall process from Dr. Winston Royce.\n\nWith initiatives as complex and emergent as design system work, it’s difficult\nto rely on a process that will work every time. What’s a better framework that\nwe can use?\n\nMy favorite answer comes from software engineer Jonathan Rasmusson in his\nbook, _The Agile Samurai_. The first sentence of the first chapter of the book\nsays, “What would it take to deliver something of value [to customers] each\nand every week?”\n\nThat’s it. That’s the framework. Every time your team sits down to work, ask\nthis question. Whatever the answer, do that.\n\n## Less Is More\n\nIn order to do more working on software together, everyone has to do less of\nthe old thing. Engineers need to spend less time waiting for “the design\nphase” to end to start building. Designers need to create fewer static comps.\nRestricting these wasteful activities frees up more time to do many more\nvaluable things.\n\nWhat kinds of valuable things? I’m so glad you asked.\n\n## The Hot Potato Process\n\nI’d like to propose a new—and old—way for designers and engineers to be\nworking together.\n\nPretend that you’re making a web application for cataloging events and trips.\nYou’ve done the research and have hypotheses to test through a minimum viable\nproduct (an MVP). What should you do next to bring this product to life?\n\nFor those of you who thought Figma or Sketch or Photoshop or some design tool,\nthink again! This is your new world, where you create working software as much\nas possible, not documentation.\n\nWhere a visual designer might have started by making a screen in a graphics\neditor, this is an opportunity for a front-end engineer to begin.\n\nThe engineer opens up a code editor and starts writing some code. Starting\nwith a logged-in version of the homepage, the first thing to create is a list\nof the jobs this page should be doing. They write some plain text in an HTML\ndocument and open it in a web browser to preview what’s been done ([Figure\n8.8](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-8)).\n\nVersion 1 is done! Remember, all that’s needed to make a web product is some\nHTML. Everything else is an optimization. Time to optimize!\n\n![](../images/fig8-8.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.8Plain text rendered in a web browser is a great first version of a\nweb product.\n\nThe next steps are really about scaffolding—a fancy way to say some structure\nis being added to this page, both visually and in code—which is much easier\nand faster to do in code than in a graphics editor. This is what it looks like\nto design and decide in the browser. Make each job its own discernible block\n([Figure 8.9](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-9)). It’s up to the engineer where this is\nbeing written, whether it’s a blank file in a local code editor, a CodePen, a\nlibrary creator like Fractal or Pattern Lab, or somewhere else. The important\nthing is moving quickly and iterating as much as possible.\n\nOne pro tip is to shrink the browser window to the smallest width it can go,\nusually around 320px wide. Working on the smallest screen possible is a major\nadvantage, because the page hierarchy works linearly; no need to worry about\ncolumns quite yet. Also, you get all the other benefits of creating mobile-\nfirst: it’s easy to test with users, the preview environment is responsive by\ndefault, and the smaller form factor forces focus as it relates to content\ncreation.\n\nOK, version 2: done!\n\nNow, translate some of the jobs this page has to do into the features and\ncontent that actually do that job. You’ll see in that first block: “Orient me\nso I know where I am and let me move around if I want to.” An appropriate\nelement for doing all that stuff is a header component, so replace the job\nphrase with a word or two that describes the actual content going in here\n([Figure 8.10](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-10)).\n\nVersion 3: done!\n\n![](../images/fig8-9.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.9Add some simple HTML to give structure to the content.\n\n![](../images/fig8-10.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.10Replace descriptive content with the name of the component that\nperforms that job.\n\nSo far, this is something the front-end engineer has been leading the charge\non, but the designer has been paying attention this whole time. At any point\nalong the way, they can revise each other’s work. The designer might realize\nhere that “For Your Consideration” and “Blast from the Past” have equal\npriority so they should always exist side-by-side.\n\nThe engineer can take a quick tour to put in a little CSS Grid action—or\nflexbox, or floats, or any other layout technique of choice—to put that\ncontent side-by-side to communicate equal priority. Just like that, version 4\nis done ([Figure 8.11](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-11))!\n\n![](../images/fig8-11.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.11Structural tweaks can happen early when working in software.\n\nNow, this whole time, the designer wasn’t just sitting around watching. The\nbeauty of Hot Potato is that people can be working in parallel. While the\nengineer sets up the scaffolding, the designer can start playing around with\nthe general art direction. This isn’t a UI kit or a component library or\nreally anything finished or too official. This is a thing I like to call an\n_element collage_ ([Figure 8.12](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-12)). Imagine that you\ntook a finished website, printed out all the pages, cut them up, and then\nspread them all out on the table. An element collage is exactly that, except\nin reverse. It should be just enough exploration that everyone knows where the\ndesigner is headed. This is only a handful of elements, but let’s list all the\nthings the engineer might be able to tell about this just from this short\nvisual exploration:\n\n  * The name of the app is Trippin’.\n  * Looks like there’s a rounded card motif happening for major pieces of content.\n  * The typographic palette is a bold sans serif for headlines with a serif italic for some subheads.\n  * The color palette has at least four major colors in it.\n\n![](../images/fig8-12.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.12An element collage for our Trippin’ app.\n\nBased on even the little that’s currently in that element collage, the\nengineer could start to set up some design tokens related to things like\ntypography and colors ([Figure 8.13](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-13)). Those tokens\nmay manifest as Sass variables, a JSON file, YAML, or whatever you prefer.\n\n![](../images/fig8-13.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.13A configuration file of design decisions in code that the designer\ncan be in charge of.\n\nWhat’s important here is that this becomes a file that the designer is in\ncharge of. That’s right designer: you’re gonna have to learn some code, or at\nleast code-like concepts. Did you really think we’re just going to flip the\nfront-end engineer’s world upside-down by making them lead the charge on\ndesign, and you could just do what you’ve always done? Think again! You’ll\nhave to learn some new things, like getting familiar with some Sass syntax and\nmaybe even get a local build up and running, but it’ll be good for you.\nWelcome to the party! And don’t worry: your engineer can help walk you through\nit all.\n\nOnce this is up and running, these tokens can be tweaked to the designer’s\nheart’s content! Rather than the engineer being in charge of getting the\ndesign details right, now the designer has the power to do it directly! Say\ngoodbye to redlines forever; just climb into this file to make the changes.\n\n### What Do You Need Right Now?\n\nThis is my favorite part of Hot Potato, because this is really where it starts\nrolling. Remember, the front-end engineer is leading the charge, making the\nsoftware. That means everyone is in service of the engineer. And this is the\nquestion everyone should be asking:\n\n**Dear Engineer, what do you need right now?**\n\nThese are the magic words.\n\nAs a designer, I’m constantly asking my engineers what they need. My job is in\nservice of theirs. And that’s the rest of the team members’ jobs, too. We’re\nhere solely to help them, because they’re the ones closest to the working\nsoftware.\n\nAt this stage, the engineer might say they need some copy for the footer.\nCopywriter, can you get some copy ready for the footer? If the copywriter is\nbusy, product manager, can you track that down instead? If the product\nmanager’s busy, who’s not busy right now who can do that?\n\n### All Hands on Deck\n\nAt this point, it’s all hands on deck. Let’s pause for a minute to talk about\nthat. When is the only time on a project where it’s all hands on deck?\nUsually, at the end, at crunch time. Everyone’s working furiously together,\nbut stressed out, too. If you can move that “all hands on deck” dynamic to way\nearlier in the project—like at the beginning—you get the same amount of\ncollaboration and help, but without the stress.\n\n### Kinda Like This\n\nEngineer, what else do you need? They might say, “I’d love to know what the\n‘Coming up’ section is gonna look like.”\n\nThe designer replies, “I was thinking it could be a bunch of cards that you\ncan swipe through horizontally.” And they could pull their phone out of their\npocket and open the App Store. “Yeah, kinda like this middle one” ([Figure\n8.14](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-14)). And that will give the engineer enough to go\non to prototype. Instead of spending a few hours making a comp, they solved it\ntogether in just a few seconds.\n\n![](../images/fig8-14.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.14The Apple App Store acts as a perfect reference for the design and\ninteraction I’d like the Trippin’ app to have.\n\n“Kinda like this” is a great phrase to use in a Hot Potato session where you\ncan use references to make sure that you’re aligned. References shortcut the\ntime to alignment, as opposed to having to design and build everything from\nscratch.\n\n### Spot Comps\n\n“Engineer, what else do you need right now?”\n\n“I’d love to know what the header looks like,” they reply.\n\nThe designer may actually have something specific in mind for the hamburger\nmenu button, and they may not have a good reference for it because it’s so\nunique, so “kinda like this” isn’t really applicable here. Once all other\noptions have been exhausted, that’s the right time for a comp! But not a full\ncomp … just what I like to call a “spot comp,” a visual sketch of just one\nspot on this screen, not the whole screen.\n\nThe designer describes what they can in words—“I’m thinking it’s the logo on\nthe left and a hamburger icon on the right” so that the engineer can scaffold\nit—and then the designer goes off to design this specific piece for the next\n5–10 minutes while the engineer is building the scaffolding.\n\nHere’s what a spot comp looks like in [Figure 8.15](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-15).\nIt’s just one spot of the screen.\n\nWhile the designer was spending 5–10 minutes spot comping the header, the\nengineer was dropping in a scrolly-card pattern that can be swiped through\n([Figure 8.16](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-16)).\n\n![](../images/fig8-15.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.15Don’t comp everything if the engineer doesn’t need it.\n\n![](../images/fig8-16.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.16Scrolly patterns are now added to the page.\n\nThe designer drops off a header spot comp. While the engineer is building out\nthe header, the designer might open up those design tokens and start honing\nthe details of the cards, like getting the shape of the card right with the\nappropriate drop shadow ([Figure 8.17](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-17)) or getting\nsome of the proper typographic styling in there ([Figure\n8.18](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-18)).\n\n![](../images/fig8-17.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.17Colors and rounded corners are added to scrollable cards.\n\n![](../images/fig8-18.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.18Proper typography is added.\n\nWhile the designer was working on those details, the engineer now has the\nheader built out ([Figure 8.19](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-19)).\n\nWhile the engineer was pulling in the header, the designer started setting up\npulling in different colors for different variations of cards ([Figure\n8.20](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-20)).\n\n![](../images/fig8-19.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.19Header is fully built out.\n\n![](../images/fig8-20.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.20Different color cards are added.\n\nI won’t take this much further here, but hopefully, you get the idea. After a\nfew hours of this, I hope you can see how a team might collaboratively build\nout a whole screen. And that may previously be the same amount of time it\ntakes a designer to do a bunch of full static comps in a design tool, and then\neverything has to start from scratch again when you start the build. With the\nHot Potato method, you get everything in the browser as early as possible, and\nyou get the bonus of a responsive working environment while being way closer\nto making working software with everyone involved in the same process. Hot\nPotato works best when everyone’s working on the same thing at the same time.\n\nOne way to best visualize the Hot Potato process is by superimposing a sine\nwave and an inverted sine wave ([Figure 8.21](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-21)). Hot\nPotato is about continually coming together to sync up and going apart to have\nheads-down independent work. The key to this process is keeping the time apart\nas short as possible. Many teams will let designers go away for one or more\nweeks before coming back together for scheduled rituals like critique. While\nthat’s useful, it’s not collaboration; it’s designers being independently\nresponsible and not maximizing the amount of help a team can give each other.\n\n![](../images/fig8-21.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.21Hot Potato works best when each party frequently works\nindependently, then together, then independently, and then together.\n\nAs teams get more practiced with Hot Potato, the amount of time between coming\nback together can increase. To the untrained eye, this can look exactly the\nsame as the old waterfall process, but the Hot Potato methodology is crucial\nto make sure that teams stay connected, and connection is a prerequisite for\nboth collaboration and fruitful design system work.\n\n## A Change in Tools Needs a Change in Behavior\n\nEvery animal on earth is constrained by its energy budget.\n\nIn an article for _Smithsonian Magazine_ , editor Jerry Adler proposes that\nmost calories for human beings are burned invisibly through activities like\npowering the heart, the digestive system, and especially the brain, which\nsilently works to move molecules around within and among its 100 billion\ncells.2 A human body at rest devotes roughly one-fifth of its energy to the\nbrain, regardless of whether it is thinking anything useful, or even thinking\nat all.\n\nIn 2009, Harvard University Professor of Biological Anthropology Richard\nWrangham proposed “The Cooking Hypothesis,” a theory that our brains became\nsignificantly larger than our ancestors’ because of cooking. They could spend\nless time on energy-draining activities like foraging, chewing, and digesting\nfoods because cooking drew out additional nutrients and they had more energy\nto spend. Larger brains allowed us to process more information, create more\ndynamic social groups, and adjust to unfamiliar habitats.\n\nAnd what made this possible? Fire. Legend has it that Prometheus, the son of a\nTitan, scaled Mount Olympus to steal fire from the workshop of Hephaestus (god\nof fire and metalworking) and Athena (goddess of war). Prometheus gave the\nfire to humans, which gave them the power to harness nature for their own\nbenefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could\ncare for themselves with food and warmth, and they could also forge weapons\nand wage war. Prometheus’s gift of fire acted as a catalyst for the rapid\nprogression of civilization.\n\nWhen a community gets new powerful tools, their lives can change drastically\nfor the better—if they can fully embrace those new tools into how they live.\nPrometheus’s gift of fire to humans changed the course of humanity forever,\nbecause humans did things with it. They cooked food. They migrated. When you\nget a powerful new tool, you have to change something in your behavior in\norder to make the most of it.\n\nThe biggest pitfall I see with design systems is that designers and engineers\nstill try to work the way they’ve been working without a design system, even\nthough they may have one now. For example, I’ll say to a designer and engineer\npair, “Work together on the homepage.” This is what they do: the designer goes\nback to their desk to make a comp of the homepage, and the engineer waits for\nthe designer to make a comp so that they can build it. And they truly believe\nthis is working together. It’s not.\n\nLet’s look at two examples that hopefully illuminate how different and\nempowering working together in a truly collaborative way could be.\n\n### The Future of Collaborative Work\n\nIn 2017, a few designers and engineers at Airbnb conducted an experiment where\nthey classified 150 components in their design system and taught a machine how\nto recognize them.3 They built a prototype where they could draw rudimentary\nshapes on paper, point a camera at the sketch, and a computer translated that\nlow-fidelity sketch into a high-fidelity, coded component in a web browser\n([Figure 8.22](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-22)).\n\n![](../images/fig8-22.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.22An experiment by Airbnb about automating UI design through paper\nsketches.\n\nIn 2020, designer Jordan Singer wrote a plug-in for Figma that assessed plain\ntext and translated it into an interface. A designer could type words into a\ntext box: “An app that has a navigation bar with a camera icon, ‘Photos’\ntitle, and a message icon. A feed of photos with each photo having a user\nicon, a photo, a heart icon, and a chat bubble icon.” And the plug-in will\nturn that text into a representative interface ([Figure\n8.23](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-23)).\n\n![](../images/fig8-23.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.23Jordan Singer’s “Designer” plug-in for Figma created interfaces\nusing a text prompt.\n\nI don’t know the specific mechanics of how these examples work—they use words\nlike “neural network” and “machine learning” that are above my pay grade right\nnow—but I assume they probably use some natural language processing to somehow\ntie recognized words and phrases to components in a system.\n\nWhat’s bananas about this is that we as an industry are more willing and able\nto write software programs that use natural language processing or machine\nlearning to assemble interfaces than we are to sit with a designer or engineer\nand use these same exact words. Both of these examples assume there’s already\na system or at least a library in place.\n\nThis is how you use a design system when you have it. A designer and engineer\ncan sit down together, and the designer can say, “I’m thinking this could be\nan app that has a navigation bar with a camera icon, ‘Photos’ title, and a\nmessage icon. A feed of photos with each photo having a user icon, a photo, a\nheart icon, and a chat bubble icon.”\n\nIn the previous two examples, the designer “tells” the computer to make\nsomething. What’s even better about doing this with another person instead of\nan artificial intelligence is that the engineer could reply, “Ooh, I have a\ndifferent idea, or a better idea.” That kind of conversation is the start of\nwhere excellent work comes from, because everyone’s invested, and their ideas\nare represented early on.\n\n## Hot Potato Gotchas\n\nThe Hot Potato process works wonders, but it does have some gotchas associated\nwith it. Many teams are so used to working the way they have for many years\nthat anything new feels too daunting to take on. Let’s address a few common\nroadblocks and objections to the Hot Potato process.\n\n### Start Hot Potato by Sitting Together\n\nMany teams are open to the idea of trying Hot Potato, but they don’t exactly\nknow where to begin. It seems overly simplistic, but the best way for\ndesigners and engineers to start trying the Hot Potato process is to\nphysically sit together. We’ve seen many a designer + engineer pair who have\nworked together for years become enlightened as to how the other works within\nthe first few minutes of sitting together.\n\nIf you can’t physically sit together, try a video call where the goal is to\nwatch each other work. Push through the initial awkwardness about someone\nwatching you work; try to narrate what you’re doing and answer as many\nquestions your partner has, no matter how simple they seem. You may be\nsurprised about how little you know about how your co-workers get their work\ndone and how little they know about how you work. But this is the gateway to\ntighter and more fruitful collaboration.\n\n### Hot Potato for Distributed and Geographically Separate Teams\n\nIf you can’t work at the same time due to schedules or time zones not lining\nup, use video to bridge the gap. Record yourself working and send it to your\ncollaborator. Your collaborator can then work alongside your recording while\nmaking their own recording. Then continue to pass recordings back and forth.\nTools like Loom, Voxer, Marco Polo, and other walkie-talkie- and intercom-like\napps help to make asynchronous collaboration feel a bit closer to synchronous\ncollaboration.\n\n### Hot Potato for Large Teams\n\nA common concern is that Hot Potato seems viable for a small team of four to\nsix people, but it wouldn’t work if you have a hundred-person design or\nengineering team.\n\nAnd that’s absolutely true: it wouldn’t work. The math works against you. If\nyou have a team of three people, there are only three communication points\nneeded between them for the whole team to stay connected. Adding just one more\nperson to the team doubles the number of lines of connection you need between\nthem: for example, a four-person team needs six communication points for the\nwhole team to stay connected ([Figure 8.24](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-24)).\n\nYou see how quickly the complexity increases. On a 12-person team, you need 66\nlines of connection ([Figure 8.25](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-25)).\n\n![](../images/fig8-24.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.24Adding one more person to a team necessitates three additional\nconnections.\n\n![](../images/fig8-25.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.25A 12-person team needs 66 lines of communication to stay connected.\n\nTrying to sustain this is the wrong problem to solve. Instead of trying to\nnavigate the complexity in 66 lines of connection for a 12-person team, break\nup into two teams of six people that only need 30 connections ([Figure\n8.26](chapter8.xhtml#fig8-26)). It’s the same number of people, but the scale\nworks against you with a larger team. So, instead of figuring out how to scale\nthis process, try to reduce your scale to capitalize on this process.\n\n![](../images/fig8-26.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 8.26Splitting a 12-person team into two teams of six people simplifies\nthe communication needed to stay connected.\n\n## Resistance to New Workflow\n\nUsually, when I share this kind of Hot Potato, “use your words instead of your\nhands” process with a new team, engineers get pretty excited and can’t wait to\ntry them out. Designers, on the other hand, often put up a bit of resistance.\nThere are usually two different reasons for this. Both are worth addressing,\nalthough in very different ways.\n\n### Ego\n\nSome designers think they rule the team. This deserves to be dealt with\nquickly and sternly. There’s no room for ego on a collaborative team. It’s\ntoxic. If you’re a manager, tell your little prima donna that they can shape\nup or ship out. No matter how much you think you need them, they’re probably\nstifling the rest of the team. Get rid of them, and you’ll likely see your\nteam step up to the challenge because now they have room to shine.\n\n### Loss of Identity\n\nThe second reason I get pushback is much more understandable, because lots of\npeople don’t even realize that it’s happening. There are usually four types of\nresponses I get from designers that hint at this second reason:\n\n  * “There’s no way that kind of process would work here.”\n  * “Why do we even need to change things in the first place?!”\n  * “What if we only try this new process on projects where we have extra time?”\n  * “Even if this works, it’s not like it will make anything better here.”\n\nThese kinds of sentiments may look familiar to some of you. Respectively, they\nare signs of the following:\n\n  * Denial\n  * Anger\n  * Bargaining\n  * Depression\n\nWhat are these signs of? Grief. When does one grieve? When they experience\nloss. And what did they lose? Their identities.\n\nSo many designers have their worth tied to the output they create, namely\ntheir comps. And for good reason: it’s one of the biggest dopamine hits around\nfor a designer to make something quickly and hear the people around them say\nhow awesome it is. Multiply that by the number of years they’ve been a\ndesigner, and it’s increasingly more engrained. And all of a sudden, I’m\nsaying to comp less and trust someone else with that job? Now what do they do?\nWho are they? Who can they become?\n\nIf designers are losing their old identities because of this new approach,\nlet’s give them new ones. One of my favorite exercises to do when introducing\nthis new kind of working style is that I ask designers to think of their most\nrecent project or two. Regarding those projects, I’ll ask them to list all the\nthings they wish they had gotten to do but didn’t have time for. Though the\nconversation might take a little while to get started, I’ll eventually start\nto hear answers like:\n\n  * Animating\n  * Learning a new app (Figma, Framer, etc.)\n  * Creating custom illustrations\n  * Learning some code\n  * Creating a custom icon set\n  * Writing better documentation\n  * More accessibility efforts\n\nFinally, it will dawn on them: this isn’t writing on the wall. Instead, it’s\nthe opposite: this is an opportunity to grow, to further explore their own\ninterests that have previously been unexplored. But the culture needs to exist\nfor designers to feel safe to grow into their new skills.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * How well do you think the Hot Potato process would work at your organization? Make a list of a few teams or even a few pairs or trios that might be the most receptive to giving Hot Potato a try in their next sprint.\n  * How might future developments like artificial intelligence or automation change your design system process for the better? For the worse?\n\n  1. 1 W. W. Royce, “Managing the Development of Large Software Systems,” Proceedings of IEEE WESCON 26 (1970): 328–388.\n\n  2. 2 Jerry Adler, “Why Fire Makes Us Human,” _Smithsonian Magazine_ , June, 2013, [www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?all](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/?all)\n\n  3. 3 Benjamin Wilkins, “Sketching Interfaces,” Airbnb, <https://airbnb.design/sketching-interfaces/>\n\n\n#  CHAPTER 9 Success Metrics for a Design System\n\nIdentifying Custom Success Metrics\n\nA Framework to Measure Success\n\nPeople Succeed, Not Systems\n\nAlign Goals to Connect an Organization\n\nQuestions for Reflection\n\nYou can probably already guess the two most common promises of design systems:\nefficiency and consistency.\n\nEfficiency is straightforward to measure. You can look for things like these\nindicators to determine if your design system is making your organization more\nefficient:\n\n  * Reduction in design or engineering time from feature teams\n  * Increase in speed to market\n  * Reduction in time to perform quality assurance (QA)\n  * Reduction in bugs filed during the feature creation process\n\nConsistency is a bit more difficult to nail down, but the impact is usually\ngreater if you can do so. For example, a decrease in redundancy within the CSS\nthat designers or engineers are writing may indicate that your digital\ninterfaces are becoming more consistent. You can use tools like CSS Stats1 to\ncreate a benchmark of quantitative data about your CSS and track it over time\nas more teams use the design system.\n\nYou might also track things like reductions in customer complaints or\ndecreases in customer task completion time. There’s certainly as much\ncorrelation as causation here, but it could be a possible signal that your\norganization’s customers are having a better user experience because of more\nconsistent interface choices.\n\nUltimately, all of these indicators for efficiency and consistency point to\none thing, the holy grail of design system success: adoption. Design system\nadoption is when feature teams choose to use the design system’s components to\ncreate their feature or product’s interface. The more teams that adopt your\ndesign system, the better the experience becomes for your customers, which, in\nturn, is better for the organization, too.\n\nUnfortunately, adoption is difficult to track. As of the date of this writing,\nthe only viable design system analytics tool I’ve come across is Omlet,2 a\ntool for developers that measures component usage by analyzing your codebase.\nOtherwise, most of the adoption tracking tools out there have been custom\ncreated by and for the teams who have the bandwidth and expertise to build\nthem. The Segment team (now part of Twilio) created their own adoption\ndashboard3 that tracks precisely which files import a component ([Figure\n9.1](chapter9.xhtml#fig9-1)). Graphics editor Figma has its own Library\nAnalytics feature4 (formerly called _Design System Analytics_5) that’s\nexclusive to how designers are using connected components within the Figma\nenvironment ([Figure 9.2](chapter9.xhtml#fig9-2)).\n\n![](../images/fig9-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.1Segment’s custom-built design system adoption tool.\n\n![](../images/fig9-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.2Figma’s Library Analytics tool shows how connected UI kits are.\n\nIn his article “Measuring Design System Success,” design system consultant\nNathan Curtis outlines four topic areas that most design system teams can use\nto measure how successful their work is:6\n\n  * Product Adoption\n  * Operating a Systems Team\n  * Cultivating a Community\n  * Monitoring Product Improvement\n\nThis is a great starting point, but it’s table stakes. It’s also what every\ndesign system team does, so there’s a high-enough likelihood that more than a\nfew of these won’t be relevant for your design system initiative.\n\nTo really understand how a design system can be impactful in your\norganization, you’ll have to identify some custom success metrics that tie the\ndesign system to specific organizational goals more directly.\n\nDESIGN SYSTEM COVERAGE\n\nHow much of any given page of a website should be made up of design system\ncomponents?\n\nAs of this writing, here’s the current version of the United Airlines homepage\nas it stands today ([Figure 9.3](chapter9.xhtml#fig9-3)).\n\nUnited Airlines’ design system is called _Atmos_. Here’s the current version\nof the United Airlines homepage ([Figure 9.4](chapter9.xhtml#fig9-4)), broken\ndown by what _is_ an Atmos design system component (highlighted in neon green)\nand what _is not_ (highlighted in pink).\n\nThis system isn’t based on any insider knowledge of any back-end code or\nlogic. It is purely an analysis of front-end HTML. You can perform the same\nassessment yourself by inspecting the HTML of this page and looking for any\nclass that starts with `atm-`, the design system “namespace” for all Atmos\ncomponents.\n\nHere are all the different kinds of components that can—and often do—live\ntogether on one page:\n\n  * Components that come straight out of the design system\n  * Components that are custom built for this page or a specific feature on this page\n  * Components that are forked or duplicated versions of what also lives in the design system\n\n![](../images/fig9-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.3The United Airlines homepage, made up of many different kinds of\ncomponents.\n\n  * Components that started here where an abstracted version eventually ended up in the design system\n  * Components from the design system whose styles are being augmented or overwritten\n  * Design system components nested inside of nondesign system containers\n  * Custom components nested inside of design system containers\n\nWhat variety! And that’s OK! This is the reality of enterprise product design\nat scale. It reflects the nature of parallel roadmaps, design system team\nresourcing and bandwidth, business priorities, and many more factors.\n\nSome organizations seem to strive for an ideal that, once a design system\nexists, everything in an interface can and should be built with it. Not only\nis that an unrealistic goal for most enterprises, but it can often be a toxic\nmindset to think that anything less than 100% coverage is a misuse of a design\nsystem at best or an utter failure at worst.\n\nUse the Pareto principle—often known as the “80/20 rule”—to set an actionable\ntarget for teams: aim for up to 80% of any given page to be made of design\nsystem components and leave room for about 20% of the page to be custom. That\nremaining 20% is where the invention and innovation can happen. I recently\nheard an anecdote from a design system team who reported that they spent only\n20% of their sprint time creating 80% of their pages with the design system,\nwhich then freed up 80% of the sprint time to work on the 20% of custom\nfunctionality that really made the experience sing. This is exactly the kind\nof innovation that design systems should enable!\n\n![](../images/fig9-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.4The United Airlines homepage is shown classified with Atmos and non-\nAtmos components.\n\nOne nuance to add to this 80/20 rule for page makeup is that 80% is the\nmaximum target, not the starting point. So, what’s a good starting target for\ndesign system coverage on a page?\n\nUse 10% as a starting point, with a plan to work up to 80% eventually, likely\nover the course of a year or two. Coincidentally, the United Airlines homepage\nshows this in action. Of eight major sections of the page—admittedly a touch\noversimplified for the purposes of this example—one major section (12.5%) is\npowered by the design system.\n\nBut even 10% is too ambitious sometimes. For a more attainable starting point,\ntry to get one component adopted by a few feature teams simultaneously. It\nseems trivial, but there’s a mountain of work that goes into implementing one\ncomponent—especially the first component—into a codebase that will eventually\nmake its way to production. The effort from zero adopted components to one is\nthe steepest, and there’s a long tail of decreasing effort from there ([Figure\n9.5](chapter9.xhtml#fig9-5)).\n\n![](../images/fig9-5.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.5It’s most difficult to get the first component implemented.\n\nFor teams where even one component is too much to take on, getting _anything_\nadopted is a good first step. I often suggest a plain neon green box, like a\n`<div>` with a width, height, and background color. You might think I’m\njoking, but I’m not! Once the hurdle of getting something from one codebase\nimported into another is crossed, it’s easier to iterate into more, better,\nand higher quality components than it is to try and create a perfect one the\nfirst time around.\n\nDon’t worry if you aren’t creating everything with your design system! Be kind\nto yourself, your colleagues, and your teams. Give yourself permission to\nstart with just one component, or even just one neon green box. If you can\nmake that happen, it’s all downhill from there!\n\n## Identifying Custom Success Metrics\n\nIn his book, _Change by Design_ ,7 executive chair of design firm IDEO Tim\nBrown discussed helping people articulate their needs. He wrote, “The easiest\nthing about the search for insight … is that it’s everywhere and it’s free.”\n\nThere are many different methodologies you can use to get insight on the work\nof identifying custom success metrics that lies ahead. In her book, _How to\nMake Sense of Any Mess_ ,8 information architect Abby Covert suggested a few\nquestions you can ask about in your search for insight:\n\n  * Why does this work need to be done?\n  * Why is change needed?\n  * Why do those changes matter?\n  * Why should other people care?\n  * Why hasn’t this been tackled correctly?\n  * Why will this time be different?\n\nIn his book, _Interviewing Users_ ,9, 10 user researcher Steve Portigal\nsuggested themes that are ripe for insight exploration:\n\n  * Sequence\n  * Quantity\n  * Exceptions\n  * Complete list\n  * Relationships\n  * Organizational structure\n  * Clarification\n  * Native language\n  * Emotional cues\n  * Process\n  * Time\n\nRegardless of the specific line of questioning, talk to about 30 people.\nThat’s a large enough subset to give you a mountain of insight about what’s\nimportant to the organization as a whole.\n\nNow that you have a broad view of all or most of the things that are important\nto everyone, it’s time to rank them.\n\n### Use the KJ Method to Determine Priorities\n\nEthnographer Jiro Kawakita pioneered the idea of affinity mapping, which is\nthe idea of grouping similar data to simplify the process of deciding what\nmatters most. Nicknamed the _KJ Method_ for its founder, make this technique a\nregular go-to for creating organizationally relevant success metrics for your\ndesign system:\n\n  1. Talk to 30 individuals and record their beliefs about what’s important to a design system effort. (Alternatively, you could collect this data by asking people to submit answers through a digital survey.)\n  2. Group items together that seem related and name the group.\n  3. Bring all of the people that you originally talked to together and share the groups of priorities with them.\n  4. Give each participant three votes and ask them to choose their top three priorities.\n\nWhen done well, you can easily start to see what everyone believes success\nlooks like. A shared idea of success is a crucial ingredient in establishing a\ndesign system practice that lasts.\n\n## A Framework to Measure Success\n\nThere are many different measurement frameworks for figuring out how to track\nthe progress of work:\n\n  * You can define service-level agreements (SLAs) to memorialize understandings about priorities and responsibilities.\n  * You can use key performance indicators (KPIs) and operational performance indicators (OPIs) to focus on the key targets that make the biggest impact on realizing your organization’s high-level strategy.\n  * You can employ the Jobs-to-Be-Done framework to define and focus relentlessly on your customers’ needs.\n  * You can make hard choices using Top Tasks Management to center the five or fewer tasks that matter most to your customers.\n  * You can define (objectives and key results) (OKRs) to keep your teams constantly aimed at the bull’s-eye.\n\nSaying too much more about each methodology is a bit beyond the scope of this\nbook, but they’re all worth considering and researching further.\n\nMy favorite is OKRs, so let’s look at how you might define some custom ones\nfor your design system.\n\n### Defining Success with OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)\n\nVenture capitalist John Doerr presented the idea of OKRs to Google’s\nleadership in 1999 when they were less than a year old, and they’ve been in\nuse ever since. OKRs were originally implemented at Intel in the 1970s. Now,\ncompanies like Google, LinkedIn, Zynga, Sears, Oracle, and Twitter are just a\nhandful of organizations that use OKRs to drive their businesses.\n\nOKRs stand for _objectives and key results_ , and both parts are necessary in\na framework for keeping teams on track.\n\n  * An _objective_ is a statement that is vague, ambitious, and somewhat comfortable. Objectives usually start with a verb.\n  * A _key result_ is a measurable statement that is set and evaluated quarterly. Key results usually contain a number.\n\nObjectives are relatively easy to unearth. In fact, all of the groups’ names\nyou just created in the KJ Method serve as perfect objectives, as they’re\nprobably all vague, ambitious, and somewhat comfortable.\n\nThe next question to answer is, “How will we know that we’re making progress?”\nThe evaluation scale is the main reason I prefer the OKR framework above the\nothers. OKRs aren’t goals or targets. They’re not about achieving a goal;\nthey’re about making progress. You’re not grading your results; instead,\nyou’re evaluating your progress. The way you evaluate key results is on a\nscale from 0–10 (or 0–100, if you prefer, which I do). The aim for any given\nkey result is somewhere from 60 to 80. Why not 100? Well, imagine you hit 100.\nIt would be easy to question whether you sandbagged that key result—that is,\nyou set a key result that you knew you’d hit. Which begs the question: Were\nyou not being ambitious enough? A target score of 60–80 means that you’re\nprobably doing something a bit ambitious and that your intention is to do\npretty well against that ambitious thing. That’s a great mindset for a design\nsystem team—or any team—to have.\n\nOf course, this cuts both ways. If you get a 0 on a key result, you were\nprobably being too ambitious to the point where it was unrealistic. Be kind to\nyourself. OKRs provide a wide playing field to experience some wins in the\ncontext of work that can push you … a good balance.\n\nThe first questions I often get when creating key results with teams are,\n“Where do we get the numbers from? How do we know if we’re trying to improve\nor decrease a metric by 1% or 42% or 75%?”\n\nAdmittedly, the first time you create OKRs, you will likely be wildly off.\nThat’s OK! It’s the first time you’re doing it! You don’t have to be perfect.\nRemember: the great thing about OKRs is that they’re not about hitting a\ntarget; they’re about measuring progress. Think about it this way: the first\ntime you set OKRs will be the most difficult and probably the worst. You’re\nestablishing a benchmark. The next time (next quarter), it will be slightly\nless difficult and a little less bad. One day, a few quarters from now,\nsetting OKRs will start to feel normal and maybe even easy. Said differently,\nthe point of this quarter’s OKRs is that you’ll have a better starting point\nfor next quarter’s OKRs.\n\nNow you’ve accepted that you don’t have to be perfect about nailing your first\nset of OKRs. Still, you have to start somewhere, right? So, do you just pick a\nnumber out of a hat?\n\nThere’s a branch of psychology called _psychophysics_ , which investigates the\nrelationship between physical stimuli and the sensations and perceptions they\nproduce. In psychophysics, they talk a lot about the _just noticeable\ndifference_ (JND), which says time intervals are prone to be between 7% to 18%\non average for periods with a duration of less than 30 seconds. That means for\nsomeone to perceive, “Hey, that was faster/better/slower/worse,” the\ndifference has to be at least 7–18%. Because of the JND, my first key results\nare generally looking for a 15%–20% change (increase or decrease) in some\nelement.\n\n### Make OKRs Matter by Scheduling Time to Track Them\n\nIt’s not enough to simply set good OKRs. After you’ve identified them, you\nhave to make them matter by building a practice around them.\n\nAdd three events to your calendar:\n\n  * **Every Friday:** Set aside an hour to look at the data for all of your key results to record what’s changed.\n  * **Every Monday:** Set aside an hour to write an update to your fellow design team members to make progress—or the lack of it—visible. Make this message applicable at the ground level that everyone’s working on. Spend time in this message focusing more on key results rather than objectives, especially on what each team member can do or try to influence the key results in the direction you want to see them go.\n  * **On the last Friday of each month:** Draft a message to all the people you initially interviewed and report what you’ve learned in the previous four weeks of tracking. Keep this message high-level by focusing more on the objectives than the key results—the opposite weighting of the message you send to the team each week.\n\nThere are a few tools that can automate key result tracking, but I’d suggest\nyou do it manually for the first 2–4 quarters of implementing OKRs. The more\nintimately familiar you are with the data, how it’s being collected, and how\nmuch it can be influenced, the better story you’ll be able to tell around how\nyour design system is contributing to the company’s overall goals.\n\nSUCCESS METRICS FOR THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS: A CASE\nSTUDY\n\nA few years ago, my team at SuperFriendly and I worked on a project for the\nGeneral Conference of Seventh-day Adventists to create a design system for\nthem. The Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) church is a centralized, global\norganization. They have many suborganizations: over 70,000 churches worldwide\norganized into 13 world divisions; 63 publishing houses offering publications\nin over 350 languages; over 7,500 primary schools; 15 media centers; and\ndisaster relief in 130 countries.\n\nTo better understand what people needed from the new design system, we talked\nto different kinds of people. We talked to people who build websites for any\nof the suborganizations, from web professionals in charge of multiple sites to\nchurch secretaries learning WordPress for the first time to publish the weekly\nservice bulletin online. We talked to people who visited SDA websites both\nregularly and nonregularly. We talked to people who worked at the General\nConference about what the organization needed from a new design system.\n\nOur script for these conversations was simple. In general, we asked people\nabout themselves. What do they do as part of their normal routines? What do\nthey love about it? What do they wish they could change? Simple questions like\nthese provoked 30–60 minutes of interesting conversations that served as great\nfodder for the needs the design system had to meet.\n\nFor the SDA, we organized all of the insights into these common themes and\nobjectives. After employing the KJ Method, it was easy to visualize where\nconsensus lay: at the highest concentration of Post-its ([Figure\n9.6](chapter9.xhtml#fig9-6)).\n\n![](../images/fig9-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.6A voting session quickly surfaced the themes most and least\nimportant to everyone in the room.\n\nThe three top priorities became our objectives:\n\n  * Create a foundational, deeply rooted design system.\n  * Allow for customization and individuality.\n  * Involve the community in creation and adoption.\n\nHere is the first quarter of OKRs we set up for the new Adventist Living\nPattern System (ALPS):\n\n**Objective:** Create a foundational, deeply rooted design system.\n\n**Key Results:**\n\n  1. 1,800 Adventist websites (15% of the 12,000 sites in the Seventh-day Adventist network) make obvious use of ALPS.\n  2. 57 websites made by the General Conference (50% of the 114 websites created directly by the General Conference) make obvious use of ALPS.\n  3. The first websites built in these languages using ALPS report 0 issues when building:\n\n  1. Mandarin\n  2. Spanish\n  3. English\n  4. Hindi/Urdu\n  5. Arabic\n  6. Portuguese\n  7. Bengali\n  8.

Eighteen unions (30% of the organization) register in our feedback program.\n  2. Three ideas originating from the community not included in the initial launch of ALPS have been adopted.\n  3. ALPS is adopted by three customers who weren’t part of the initial round of customer interviews or any feedback program.\n\n![](../images/fig9-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.7ALPS contained many different color themes for constituents to\nchoose from that expressed their individuality.\n\nWhat I absolutely love about these OKRs is how specific they are to the\nAdventist Church and ALPS. They push beyond default and generic metrics of\nadoption and focus on change that’s meaningful for the mission of the\norganization.\n\n## People Succeed, Not Systems\n\nThe big epiphany in creating meaningful success metrics for your design system\nreally occurs when you start looking for how the people who make and use the\ndesign system succeed, not the system itself. Most design system teams start\nby declaring key results like “15% increase in adoption of form components”\nwhen a better focus would be “Landing Pages teams (teams that use forms)\ncomplete their work one week faster.” Certainly, two sides of the same coin,\nbut the latter opens up a myriad of possibilities for design system strategy\nby focusing on how the people using the design system succeed.\n\nHere are a few areas to look for where people can succeed.\n\n### Keep Your Team Motivated with Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose\n\nThe early days of the web were a mix of experiments ranging from news websites\nto forums to comics to personal expression and much more. As the web evolved,\nmore people and corporations started to run their businesses on the internet.\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau reported that in 2020, the internet\ncontributed $2.45 trillion (over 11%) to the United States’ GDP.11 The web is\nnow Serious Business.™\n\nAs a result, the need to track and report useful quantitative data that helps\nbusinesses grow is high. But I think the pendulum has swung a little too far.\nAs an industry, I think we now tend to overprioritize the quantitative. We\nwant dashboards, analytics tools, and hard metrics. That’s good. It’s a\ncorrection to an era where we just “felt it all out.” But I think it may be an\novercorrection.\n\nIn his book, _Drive_ , Daniel Pink described a framework for what drives\npeople and what motivates them:\n\n  * **Autonomy:** The desire to direct our own lives\n  * **Mastery:** The urge to become better at something that matters\n  * **Purpose:** The yearning to contribute and be part of a cause greater and more enduring than ourselves\n\nWhat does this have to do with design systems? Well, nothing in particular.\nBut also … everything! The job of a design system is to take care of the\nmundane, so that everyone on the team can have some amount of autonomy,\nmastery, and purpose. Sometimes, designers in particular see a design system\nitself as a direct threat to their autonomy because a system of reusable\nelements removes the point that previously held the most autonomy for\ndesigners: the creation process.\n\nTo combat that, make a list of all the things your team promises to do “if we\nhave extra time at the end.” You know—it’s the list of stuff that never gets\ndone. Usual suspects on this list typically include activities with the words\n“custom” or “more” or “trying out” in them: art-directing a custom photo\nshoot, more animation, trying out new tools, etc. Assure your team that their\ncontinued investment in design success means they get to do more of the things\non this list.\n\n### Design Systems as Relief\n\nEarlier in the chapter, I outlined efficiency and consistency as some of the\nmost typical promises of a design system, but I think there’s a much more\nimportant one that often gets overlooked: The most impactful promise of a\ndesign system should be as a _relief_ to the people who use it. Because our\nindustry’s collective work can contribute two freakin’ trillion dollars to a\ncountry’s GDP, many of our jobs now come with a dose of intense pressure.\nHonestly, most of it is undue. It’s not that deep; no one’s gonna die if you\nmess up. (For those of you who work on design systems for life-or-death\ndigital products, we thank you for your service.) For all the rest of you, be\nkinder to yourselves and your teams by relieving some of that pressure.\n\nEfficiency is a good thing, but you don’t always have to use that efficiency\nto get _more_ work done. Efficiency should allow you to rest more sometimes.\nInstead of “do more in the same amount of time,” what about “do the same\namount in a shorter amount of time and take more breaks?”\n\nRelief is even more difficult to measure than efficiency and consistency, but\nits impact is more critical. Some areas to observe whether your design system\nis truly a relief:\n\n  * **Turnover:** Is turnover lower for those who work on or use the design system than those who don’t?\n  * **Job satisfaction:** Do the people who work on or use the design system enjoy their jobs more than those who don’t? In the results of their latest “How We Document” survey, the team at design system documentation tool zeroheight starts to draw some correlations between design system work and job satisfaction.12\n  * **Creativity and innovation:** Using your organization’s standards for innovation, are people and teams who have direct ties to the design system being more creative and innovative than people and teams who don’t?\n  * **Team engagement and psychological safety:** Are people and teams who have direct ties to the design system more engaged and supportive than people and teams who don’t?\n\nHere are some examples of key results that really test whether your design\nsystem is living up to its fullest potential:\n\n  * Increase retention on [team that has the highest turnover] by 15%.\n  * Receive five new feature proposals from teams that have used the design system.\n  * 15% increase in positive and supportive language in design critiques.\n\n### Invest in Both Your Stables and Volatiles\n\nMichael Lopp was a former engineering manager at Apple before moving on to run\nengineering at Pinterest and now Slack. Over the last decade, I have yet to\nfind an article that better describes the product creation narrative than his\narticle “Stables and Volatiles.”13 In it, he thinks about how engineering\nteams can get to a v1 of a piece of software and what happens shortly after.\nHe says, “The birth of 1.0 initiates a split of the development team into two\ngroups: Stables and Volatiles.” The article goes into depth about the specific\ncharacteristics of both, but generally:\n\n  * _Stables_ tend to rely on process for predictability and measurability and are known for being reliable and calm.\n  * _Volatiles_ don’t often build beautiful or stable things, but they do build a lot, and they tend to leave a trail of disruption in their wake.\n\nLopp concluded the article by saying, “I believe a healthy company that wants\nto continue to grow and invent needs to equally invest in both their Stables\nand their Volatiles.”\n\nApplying this approach to a design system fits perfectly. Yes, a major benefit\nof a design system is creating efficiency by reuse. But even if you can build\neverything you dream of with your design system, don’t. Sure, it will count as\nsuccess for your Stables, but say goodbye to your Volatiles. A design system\nis a product, and like any good product team, some people can work on the\nsettled solutions while others can venture out, seeking the new.\n\n### Favor Incentive over Punishment\n\nCharlie Munger is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the financial\nconglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett. In a university commencement\nspeech, he once said, “Punishment works best to prevent actions whereas\nincentives work best to encourage them.”\n\nPeople are often asked to do new things under fear of punishment. That doesn’t\nmake sense. It works sometimes, but it’s confusing. Teams get told, “You have\na year to migrate to the new tech stack.” And the subtext is, “Or else\nsomething bad will happen.” Right? Per Munger’s quote here, the threat of\npunishment is more likely to get people to _stop_ doing something rather than\nget them to _start_ doing something, like learning a new technology or\nadopting a new tool like a design system.\n\nA common mantra across design system teams is, “Make the right to do the\neasiest thing to do.” In 2016, the design and engineering teams at United\nAirlines were given a year to migrate off of the old .NET tech stack, as well\nas get their UI in line with the new rebrand. They used that mandate as the\nprimary value proposition of adopting their new Atmos design system, so much\nso that it was the first line of text on the reference site homepage ([Figure\n9.8](chapter9.xhtml#fig9-8)): “Atmos is the easiest way to bring the new\nUnited Airlines visual language and React tech stack to your application.”\n\n![](../images/fig9-8.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 9.8The first line of the Atmos reference site was designed to signal\nthat it was the easiest way to do the right thing.\n\n## Align Goals to Connect an Organization\n\nA design system team’s goal is often not the same as a product team’s goal.\nThe design system team’s goal is usually adoption of the design system. The\nproduct team’s goals are often some form of customer value.\n\nWhen there’s tension between a design system team’s goals and a product team’s\ngoals, which one do you prioritize? There’s an easy answer: the product\nteam’s. A design system team is a service team. The design system team should\ntie their goals to product team’s goals. That way, as the product team wins,\nthe design system team wins, too, as a result.\n\nIn [Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml), “Why Design Systems?,” I defined design\nsystems as a mechanism for connecting an organization. So far, I’ve described\nthe technical connections a design system makes through code and workflow.\nEven more powerful, design systems can kick-start a connection between teams\nthat have similar and overlapping goals.\n\nFocus your design system work on specifically supporting how your organization\ncreates customer value, and you’ll get your goal—design system adoption—for\nfree.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * How can you write or rewrite your team’s OKRs with a specific focus and tie them to how your organization creates customer value?\n  * Can you identify the specific ways that people on your team get autonomy, mastery, and purpose?\n  * Who on your team is a Stable and who is a Volatile? Is everyone working on things that align with their personality type?\n  * Do you or your managers use incentive or fear of punishment to drive your team? Are you trying to get them to stop doing existing things or start doing new things?\n\n  1. 1 “CSS Stats,” <https://cssstats.com/>\n\n  2. 2 “Omlet,” <https://omlet.dev/>\n\n  3. 3 Jeroen Ransijn, “How We Drove Adoption of Our Design System,” _Segment_ (blog), October 16, 2018, <https://segment.com/blog/driving-adoption-of-a-design-system/>\n\n  4. 4 “View and Explore Library Analytics,” Figma, <https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039238353-View-and-explore-library-analytics>\n\n  5. 5 Because it doesn’t track code, that version of design system adoption is a little bit different than how this book defines design system products and adoption.\n\n  6. 6 Nathan Curtis, “Measuring Design System Success,” June 9, 2017, <https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/measuring-design-system-success-d0513a93dd96>\n\n  7. 7 Tim Brown, _Change by Design_ (New York: HarperBusiness, 2009).\n\n  8. 8 Abby Covert, _How to Make Sense of Any Mess_ (Self-published, 2014).\n\n  9. 9 Steve Portigal, _Interviewing Users_ , 2nd Edition (New York: Rosenfeld Media, 2023).\n\n  10. 10 Another Rosenfeld Media cross-sell unlocked!

It’s\na store full of Legos, and it’s a perfect analogy for what an ideal experience\nof interacting with a design system should be like.\n\nThe entrance of the store features a showcase of all the coolest—and most\nexpensive—things people have made with Legos, for sale already assembled. The\nfirst things you see are a $360 Star Wars Y-wing ([Figure\n10.1](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-1)), a $368 Star Wars Snowspeeder ([Figure\n10.2](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-2)), a $100 Space Shuttle Orbiter ([Figure\n10.3](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-3)), and an $80 assembled Millennium Falcon\n([Figure 10.4](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-4)).\n\n![](../images/fig10-1.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.1A $360 Star Wars Y-wing.\n\n![](../images/fig10-2.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.2A $368 Star Wars Snowspeeder.\n\n![](../images/fig10-3.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.3A $100 Space Shuttle Orbiter.\n\n![](../images/fig10-4.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.4An $80 assembled Millennium Falcon.\n\nAs you get past the higher-end assembled pieces, you see some lower-value\nassembled pieces, like these $8 houses and storefronts ([Figure\n10.5](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-5)).\n\nToward the middle of the store lining the walls are different “universes” that\nshow assembled sets, from Star Wars ([Figure 10.6](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-6))\nto Tolkien’s Middle Earth ([Figure 10.7](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-7)) to DC and\nMarvel Comics ([Figure 10.8](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-8)), and more.\n\n![](../images/fig10-5.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.5$8 houses and storefronts.\n\n![](../images/fig10-6.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.6The Lego Star Wars universe.\n\n![](../images/fig10-7.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.7The Lego Middle Earth universe.\n\n![](../images/fig10-8.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.8The Lego DC and Marvel universes.\n\nAs you move past different “universes,” you start to see collections by type\ninstead of by theme. This is where you’ll find armies of Chewbaccas ([Figure\n10.9](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-9)), Batmen ([Figure\n10.10](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-10)), C-3POs ([Figure\n10.11](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-11)), Supermen ([Figure\n10.12](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-12)), and more.\n\n![](../images/fig10-9.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.9Lego Chewbaccas.\n\n![](../images/fig10-10.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.10Lego Batmen.\n\n![](../images/fig10-11.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.11Lego C-3POs.\n\n![](../images/fig10-12.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.12Lego Supermen.\n\nFurther back in the store, you’ll find the organization gets more granular, as\nparts are separated into types like gears, connectors, sprockets, flames,\npots, wheels, and more ([Figure 10.13](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-13)).\n\nThere’s even a whole section of heads ([Figure\n10.14](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-14)). Lots and lots of heads ([Figure\n10.15](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-15)).\n\n![](../images/fig10-13.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.13Legos, organized by type.\n\n![](../images/fig10-14.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.14Heads.\n\n![](../images/fig10-15.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.15Lots of Lego heads.\n\nFarther back still, once you pass the categories of parts, you’ll find parts\nnot organized into categories ([Figure 10.16](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-16)).\nThere are big bins of random assortments. Some of these parts will one day be\ncategorized, while others won’t be.\n\nLastly, at the very back of the store, there’s a trash bin for fake legos\n([Figure 10.17](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-17)). They exist. Andy’s Brick Shop\nacknowledges it and makes room for it while still letting you know that\nthey’re different from everything else you find in the store.\n\n![](../images/fig10-16.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.16Unorganized Legos.\n\n![](../images/fig10-17.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.17A trash bin for fake legos.\n\nHere’s the full view of the store ([Figure 10.18](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-18)).\nThey occasionally host classes and meetups where enthusiasts can convene,\nlearn from each other, and just play! What an amazing place!\n\n![](../images/fig10-18.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.18Andy’s Brick Shop, in all its full glory.\n\n## Lay Out Your Design System like a Store\n\nMost design systems could learn a lot from the way Andy’s Brick Shop engages\nits customers and community. In fact, many design system teams do it\ncompletely opposite, to their detriment.\n\nMost of the popular, public design system reference sites lead with the least\ncompelling parts first—components. It’s not that components aren’t important;\nthey’re crucial to a design system. But highlighting components first misses\nthe opportunity to present what’s even more appealing to the audience of\ndesigners and engineers and product managers that could use the system. It’s\nthe same idea behind the mainstream marketing mantra, “Nobody wants a quarter-\ninch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.” The biggest mistake most public\ndesign system reference sites make is that they don’t lead with the _results_\nthat can come from using the design system ([Figure\n10.19](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-19)).1\n\n![](../images/fig10-19.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.19Though beautiful and functional, the Atlassian Design System\nreference site misses a bigger opportunity by leading with components and\npatterns.\n\nHighlighting components first would be like Andy’s Brick Shop putting a bin of\nheads at the front of the store. It would be an odd signal to send to\ncustomers, to communicate that this is just a store where you can find parts\ninstead of a store where you can immerse yourself in universes you love and\nexpand your ability to play to match your imagination. Of course, it is a\nstore where you can find parts, but the context and the opportunity are much\nlarger.\n\nThe first things people should see when they come to a reference site are\nexamples of the kinds of things that could be made with that design system.\nThat may be an odd thought if you’re thinking about a reference site as a\ntechnical documentation site. It is, but only partially. Don’t forget that a\nreference site is a marketing site, too.\n\nThe Material Design website would be much more powerful if it led with how\nconsistent interfaces between products like Gmail, Search, and Maps make\nGoogle users more productive. What a statement it would be for Atlassian to\nshow their design system implemented in tools like Trello and Jira and\nBitbucket as a primary driver for how teams get their work done. Putting your\norganization’s equivalent of the Millennium Falcon at the front of the store\nmakes more people walk in ([Figure 10.20](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-20)).2\n\n![](../images/fig10-20.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.20Audi’s user interface guide is one of the few that prominently\nhighlight the kinds of products that can be made with it.\n\n## Make Your Design System About Its Users\n\nAnother big reason to focus more on the products that can be made with the\nsystem than the parts that make it up is that it signals that the people using\nthe system are as important—if not more—than the people making the system.\nComponents are the work of the design system team, but products are the work\nof feature teams. If products are nowhere to be found on design system\nreference sites, the idea that digital products can be made from a combination\nof the components gets lost. At that point, it’s just a portfolio site for the\ndesign system team.\n\nFocusing on end results also opens doors to many additional opportunities.\nAstro is the design system for the United States Space Force, and they\nhighlight a few examples of the kinds of products that can be—and have\nbeen—made with the system ([Figure 10.21](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-21)).\n\n![](../images/fig10-21.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.21The GRM Dashboard, one example of a real product that has been\nmade with the Astro Design System.\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there. The team there uses the opportunity to show how the\npage has been constructed, breaking down the anatomy of the page and the\ncomponents used ([Figure 10.22](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-22)).\n\n![](../images/fig10-22.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.22A breakdown of the GRM Dashboard product.\n\nThey link to a live demo of the application so you can see for yourself how\nthe components all work together ([Figure 10.23](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-23)).\n\n![](../images/fig10-23.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.23The real GRM product.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, they link to a Bitbucket repository ([Figure\n10.24](chapter10.xhtml#fig10-24)) so that you can see the source code behind\nthis application.\n\n![](../images/fig10-24.jpg)\n\nFIGURE 10.24The Bitbucket repository for the GRM product so you can see its\nsource code.\n\nThis is a design system at its zenith. It’s more than plug-and-play\ncomponents. It’s more than assembling parts into a layout. It’s more than\ndocumentation as a dry instruction manual. It’s a whole ecosystem that\ndescribes a way of doing things, shows you examples as starting points, and\ngives you the ingredients to try it yourself.\n\nDon’t miss the chance to give the users of your design system every advantage\nto make their jobs easier, so that they can give their customers a chance to\nmake their lives easier. It’s a cycle that keeps on giving, but it starts with\nreminding your design system customers that using your design system is going\nto somehow improve their lives and that they are a crucial part of that\nformula. Sure, they’ll find components here, but the context of it is to make\ntheir work lives easier, faster, and overall better somehow.\n\nOtherwise, your design system is just a bin of heads.\n\n## Questions for Reflection\n\n  * What’s your version of “The Millennium Falcon” in your design system? How can you make it the first thing showcased when someone comes in contact with your design system?\n  * What pieces of instructional documentation can you instead replace with stories, examples, and templates?\n\n  1. 1 “Atlassian Design System,” <https://atlassian.design/>\n\n  2. 2 “UI Introduction,” Audi, [www.audi.com/ci/en/guides/user-interface/introduction.html](http://www.audi.com/ci/en/guides/user-interface/introduction.html)\n\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nI once worked with a company that went through a rebranding effort. The\nrebrand was simple: changing all of their yellow buttons to purple buttons.\nThey estimated the effort to be around 11 months of work, to the tune of about\n$10 million.\n\nThis company managed hundreds of websites and applications across many\ndifferent platforms, and each one was built from scratch by a different team\nusing different approaches.\n\nThis rebrand should have taken four weeks maximum: one day to implement the\ncolor change in one place and four weeks to test and make sure they didn’t\nbreak anything important. But they didn’t have a system that connected all of\nthe buttons to one canonical source. Instead, they spent the amount of time\nand money it takes to put on a Broadway show.\n\nAfter reading this book, you have the knowledge to avoid this situation for\nyour team or company. Here are the four biggest lessons I hope you take with\nyou:\n\n  * Real organizational value lies in truly connected design systems.\n  * Pilots are the easiest way to make a design system that’s kindest for the teams making it and using it.\n  * True collaboration takes the most advantage of the promises of a great design system.\n  * You can serve people well if you understand what drives them.\n\nFrench author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once wrote about a man who wanted to\nbuild a seaworthy vessel. This man was able to rally a group of friends to\nperform all of the tasks needed to build the said vessel. How? This popular\nmotivational quote is said to have emerged from that story:\n\nIf you wish to build a ship, do not divide the men into teams and send them to\nthe forest to cut wood.\n\nInstead, teach them to long for the vast and endless sea.\n\nThe state of the world is increasingly alarming. Pandemics and recessions and\nlayoffs make people anxious for their livelihoods, so the least we can do for\nsome people is make work as unremarkable as possible. For those who work in\ntech, establishing and sustaining design systems practices are a great way to\ndo that.\n\nAs designers, engineers, and product people—and especially if you’re a manager\nor a leader—your primary job isn’t to increase efficiency and drive innovative\nresults. It’s to take care of the people you work with. Help them. Protect\nthem. Make their work easy. Inspire them. Excite them. Challenge them. Make\nwork a place of relief for them.\n\nI wrote this book to help you understand design systems more intimately, which\nI hope it did. But what’s the point of that? Design systems aren’t “the vast\nand endless sea.” Design systems are the ship. The vast and endless sea is a\nworld where our work is more interesting, more safe, and more fun, and\ngenerally happier. Because that’s the stuff that can make the world just a\nlittle bit better for everyone.\n\n\n# INDEX\n\n  * 80/20 rule, [176–177](chapter9.xhtml#pg_176)\n\n  * A\n  * abstracting components,

God, for lining up the experiences and moments that gave me enough\nknowledge and ability to write a book like this.\n\nThank you to my wife Emily and daughters Sidda and Charlie for all your\nsupport while I did something as silly and exciting and draining and\nenergizing and daring and audacious and humbling as writing a book.\n\nThank you to the entire Rosenfeld Media crew. Lou Rosenfeld: this book would\nnot have happened without you. Thank you for believing in me enough to let me\nfly the Rosenfeld flag behind my words. I appreciate the wrestling matches we\nhad that made our work together and our relationship stronger. Marta Justak:\nwe hit it off in our first conversation with our shared love of serial commas.\nThank you for pushing me to write the book that I wanted to write and helping\nme to avoid too many gerunds. Kevin Hoffman: thanks for introducing me to Lou.\nWithout that connection, this book wouldn’t have existed.\n\nTo my reviewers, Jesse Gardner and Alex Rice, thank you for the thoughtful and\nsuperb comments on my drafts. Many sections of this book exist because of you,\nand readers were also spared many tragedies because of you, too.

There’s a story behind it and every\nproduct we create at Rosenfeld Media.\n\nSince the early 1990s, I’ve been a User Experience consultant, conference\npresenter, workshop instructor, and author. (I’m probably best-known for\nhaving cowritten _Information Architecture for the Web and Beyond_.) In each\nof these roles, I’ve been frustrated by the missed opportunities to apply UX\nprinciples and practices.\n\nI started Rosenfeld Media in 2005 with the goal of publishing books whose\ndesign and development showed that a publisher could practice what it\npreached. Since then, we’ve expanded into producing industry-leading\nconferences and workshops. In all cases, UX has helped us create better, more\nsuccessful products—just as you would expect. From employing user research to\ndrive the design of our books and conference programs, to working closely with\nour conference speakers on their talks, to caring deeply about customer\nservice, we practice what we preach every day.\n\nPlease visit\n![](../images/elephant_logo_black.jpg)[rosenfeldmedia.com](http://rosenfeldmedia.com)\nto learn more about our **conferences** , **workshops** , **free communities**\n, and **other great resources** that we’ve made for you. And send your ideas,\nsuggestions, and concerns my way:\n[louis@rosenfeldmedia.com](mailto:louis@rosenfeldmedia.com)\n\nI’d love to hear from you, and I hope you enjoy the book!\n\n![](../images/bm1.jpg)\n\nLou Rosenfeld,Publisher\n\n![](../images/pg256.jpg)\n\n\nRECENT TITLES FROM ROSENFELD MEDIA\n\n![](../images/back_ad1.jpg)\n\nGet a great discount on a Rosenfeld Media book: visit\n[rfld.me/deal](http://rfld.me/deal) to learn more.\n\nSELECTED TITLES FROM ROSENFELD MEDIA\n\n![](../images/back_ad2.jpg)\n\nView our full catalog at\n[rosenfeldmedia.com/books](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books) to learn more.\n\n\n# ABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n![](../images/author.jpg)\n\n**Dan Mall** is a husband, dad, teacher, creative director, designer, founder,\nand entrepreneur from Philly.

New tools,\nwidespread support, and plenty of available resources mean that most of us can\nhave one up and running relatively fast.\n\nBut there’s a lingering problem. After so carefully crafting kits, parts, and\ncomponents, many teams find that their systems aren’t used as intended,\nor—even worse—aren’t used at all.\n\nWe talk a lot about design systems, but that doesn’t always mean we understand\nthem at a deeper level. How does a system serve the brand and the purpose of\nthe products we build? What do design patterns communicate? How do they relate\nto each other? How does changing a pattern alter the perception of the brand\nas a whole?\n\nYesenia answers those questions and many more. She explains how to grasp a\nbrand’s ethos, then demonstrates, through real-world examples, how design\nintent manifests in the smallest details—leading to systems that are as\nexpressive as they are effective.\n\nTo make design systems more purposeful, creative, and inclusive, we need a\ncompelling conceptual framework, a way of grasping the systemic expression of\nthe brand alongside day-to-day patterns and components. Yesenia teaches us\npractical techniques and thoughtful strategies that we can put to work right\naway—so we can see both the forest and the trees.\n\n**—Alla****K****holmatova**\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nWithout a unified language, all products drift toward inconsistency.\n\nTeams don’t _choose_ to be inconsistent. The drift goes hand in hand with\nscale. Today, technology companies have to solve increasingly complex user\nproblems across a variety of channels, like apps and websites. As companies\ngrow, it’s common for teams to form around discrete areas of a product, like\nthe homepage, account management, and search. These individual teams, in an\neffort to work quickly, develop their own standards for quality—which leads to\na weakened design vision.\n\nYou might not notice this sprawl until you look at all of your products\ntogether. Andreas Pihlström from Pinterest explains:\n\n> Over the years, the designs for our website, apps and marketing had all\n> begun to drift, so they no longer felt like they had the same personality. A\n> number of new features had also been added without a clear vision to how\n> they fit into the overall design, so the interface had begun to feel\n> cluttered and hard to understand. There was no visual hierarchy or system to\n> help you understand what was important when you looked at any given page. As\n> a result, all the inspiring ideas people save on Pinterest — by far the most\n> important part of our experience — were getting lost.\n> ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/00-01/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/00-01/))\n\nAs Pihlström notes, the problem with this drift isn’t that products look\ndifferent (though that’s part of it). The larger issue is what this\ninconsistency represents (and exacerbates): a lack of alignment and\ncommunication across teams, a diluted brand voice, and a disjointed user\nexperience.\n\n### Modular building\n\nTo address the problem with drift, many companies try to design and build with\nreusable components. This modular way of building is commonly referred to as a\n_pattern library_ , a _style guide_ , or a _design system_. These names are\noften used interchangeably, but they refer to different things:\n\n  * A pattern (or component) library is a collection of reusable user interface (UI) building blocks that are shared across teams and assembled to build products. \n  * A style guide is documentation, often on a website, that contains your company’s brand language, your component library, and rationale about how these components should be used.\n  * A design system is the broadest of these tools, and explains how a team should create products. It encompasses the pattern library and style guide, but also includes underlying design principles, rules, and guidelines to help teams create cohesive experiences. \n\nStyle guides and pattern libraries are the most tangible outputs of a design\nsystem. Because of this, many teams begin their systems by focusing on UI\ncomponents. But components alone won’t eliminate inconsistency.\n\n### What does your team need?\n\nDesign systems can take many forms, depending on the size of your team. If\nyour team is small and your primary goal is to reduce inefficiencies in the\ndesign and development process, then a small set of documented components and\npatterns might be all you need.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, if you aspire to build a UI framework that\ndefinitively guides how a web application should be built, and that thousands\nof teams will use, then you need a more generic solution. Your patterns need\nto be generalized and open-ended so the product teams that implement the\npatterns in their work can customize them as they see fit.\n\nHowever, if your goal is to improve the design and user experience of your\nproducts by enabling harmonious, integrated design and development work, then\nyou need more. A pattern library alone can’t create alignment across multiple\nproduct teams that are all working toward their own objectives. And a generic\ndesign system isn’t going to focus on the common ingredients that make your\norganization and products special.\n\nThroughout this book, I’m going to refer to the _design systems team_ and the\n_product teams_. The design systems team is responsible for creating and\nmaintaining the design system. The product teams are focused on specific\nproducts or features. In some organizations, that split might not exist. You\nmay have the same people creating the system and using it to create products.\n\n### Design system principles\n\nWhen you create a design system, you’re not just creating reusable\npatterns—you’re operationalizing how your company approaches design. Your\nteam’s design system needs to be highly specific to your team’s needs. If\nyou’re creating a design system for the first time, here are some guiding\nprinciples as you start your journey—adapt them as needed to fit your team:\n\n  * **Design systems are intentional.** A design system necessarily means being deliberate about how you approach creating, building, and maintaining the user experience of your product. What new habits do you want to introduce that can help your team build higher-quality products?\n  * **Your team is already working in systems.** Whether your team has a documented pattern library or not, it uses systems. Over time, teams develop a shared understanding about how they should work. Often, these systems live in people’s heads. A good way to start a design system is by identifying systems that you already have in place that are working well and documenting them. Then, critically evaluate your findings to understand which systems you want to change. \n  * **Strong systems are collaborative.** A design system should be cross-disciplinary and should represent how your teams build products _together_. \n  * **The human aspects of your system are more complicated than the tooling.** Many of the conversations around design systems focus on tooling problems. “Our lives will change once we have this Sketch UI kit that maps directly to code.” I get it. Tooling feels tangible. The problem is there are many intangible parts of a system that need to be defined before we can enable harmonious, integrated, and successful product development. Spend more time on creating a shared language and less time on tools.\n\n### What makes a design system expressive?\n\nIf you’re reading this book, you’ve probably already heard about the benefits\nof creating a design system:\n\n  * Faster builds, through reusable components and shared rationale \n  * Better products, through more cohesive user experiences and a consistent design language \n  * Improved maintenance and scalability, through the reduction of design and technical debt \n  * Stronger focus for product teams, through tackling common problems so teams can concentrate on solving user needs\n\nIn short, a design system can take on the easier, more repetitive problems so\nproducts can solve hard problems more readily.\n\nDespite these benefits, some designers express frustration with design\nsystems:\n\n  * Rigid systems that stifle creativity\n  * Monotonous systems that lead to generic, cookie-cutter experiences\n  * Overly specific systems that can’t be adapted to enough use cases\n  * Complicated, unexplained, and unsupported systems that lead to fragmented user experiences\n\nIn this book, I’m going to describe ways you can create a design system that\nmakes your products feel cohesive across multiple touchpoints while still\nleaving room for meaningful experimentation and divergence. This is what I\ncall an _expressive desi_ _gn_ _system_.\n\nExpressive design systems have three defining qualities:\n\n  * **They are purpose-built.** Your design system should align your team on a shared vision of your brand’s voice, visual style, and behavior. \n  * **They support a range of expression.** Your design system should enable meaningful experimentation and divergence while still retaining the spirit of the system writ large. \n  * **They inspire use.** Designers should feel motivated to solve complex problems with their design system, rather than feeling constrained by it. \n\n### What this book will cover\n\nThis book is not a step-by-step guide to building a design system. The purpose\nof this book is to help you integrate brand expression and range within an\nexisting design system. Working on a design system isn’t a linear process. You\nneed to continually zoom in and out, jumping between small elements and your\nentire product ecosystem. So, you’ll find that this book isn’t written in a\nlinear fashion. Feel free to jump around and read things in any order you\nplease.\n\n  * In Chapter 1, we’ll discuss how to set a purpose statement for a design system that will guide your work. Then we’ll look at how to establish principles that will align teams as they make design decisions. \n  * In Chapter 2, we’ll look at the process behind the system. How can you get a better understanding of your organization so you can make the most impact with a design system? After that, how do you go about unifying, consolidating, and documenting elements?\n  * Chapter 3 focuses on how to communicate your brand through a system. We’ll look at how to define your design language so that your brand’s voice feels harmonious throughout your products. \n  * Chapter 4 is about how to build in opportunities for variation. A huge part of creating an expressive design system is knowing when to allow for flexibility and experimentation. We’ll discuss some frameworks you can use to decide when, where, and how to allow for variation.\n  * Chapter 5 reflects on managing design systems. In order to keep our design systems purposeful and expressive, we need to evolve them from real-world use cases. We’ll discuss how clear governance and contribution models will keep our systems alive. \n\nBy the end of this book, I hope you’ll believe there’s plenty of space for\ncreativity within design systems.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n\n# Chapter 1. Purpose And Principles\n\n![](image/1.png)\n\nIn the 1960s, the NYC subway system was a maze of mismatched signage and\nbroken wayfinding. With no clear unifying language, travelers were getting\nlost. The New York City Transit Authority hired Massimo Vignelli and Bob\nNoorda to design a solution.\n\nVignelli and Noorda spent several years underground, watching the flow of\npassengers getting on and off trains and moving through stations. They studied\npeople’s habits. What paths did people take? When and where did they look for\ninformation?\n\nThe resulting _New York City Transit Authority Graphics Standards Manual_ (Fig\n1.1) was an impressively detailed set of specifications for designing and\nconstructing signage, guided by strong user-centered principles (Fig 1.2).\n\nThe level of detail in this 185-page manual is impressive, and the principles\nthat guided the work are even more so. Through the unified design language,\nVignelli and Noorda aimed to help orient people within the subway environment,\nso they could get to where they needed to go, quickly.\n\nDesign systems create better products when they provide both unity and\ncohesion. _Unity_ means that things feel complete—all of your brand elements\nwork together as one.\n\nBut unity doesn’t guarantee cohesion. _Cohesion_ is the quality that makes\nyour user interfaces easy to understand across the experience. Vignelli and\nNoorda created unity with a consistent visual language for signage, but they\nenabled cohesive experiences by defining where that signage should be placed\nfor commuters to receive the right information at the right time. If they had\nonly addressed the visual inconsistencies in the signage without also\nconsidering the behaviors of subway riders, people would still be getting lost\nunderground.\n\nUnity is easier to accomplish than cohesion, because it can be solved by\ncreating tools: style guides, brand languages, shared components. Cohesion is\nmore complicated because it can’t be solved with a tool alone. In order to\ncreate products that feel cohesive, you need to align teams around a shared\ndefinition of how your brand should look, feel, and behave. That’s why it’s\nimportant to set a purpose and establish principles.\n\n![A binder page from the New York City Transit Authority Graphics Standards\nManual, showing the required fonts and icons for subway\nsignage.](image/1.1_NYC_Subway_Manual_1.png)\n\nFig 1.1: Similar to digital design systems, this page from the _New York City\nTransit Authority Graphics Standards Manual_ explains how to use smaller\ncomponents, like arrows and directional information, to construct signs for a\nrange of situations.

Never before. Never after.”\nPhotograph from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\n## Setting a Purpose\n\nIf you’re proposing a design system at your company, you may get resistance.\nWhy is a design system worth the effort? Why would we take time away from\nshipping product features to create a system? Busy teams pushing on their\nindividual product roadmaps may not understand (or care) about why creating a\ndesign system will help them be more efficient. If you can demonstrate the\nvalue that a design system will have for your internal team and your end\nusers, then you improve your chances of getting buy-in.\n\nDesign systems are all about alignment. Early on, you need to align your team\naround why a design system matters. You can do this by defining a purpose\nstatement for your design system.\n\n### Finding your purpose statement\n\nYour _purpose statement_ describes what your team is trying to achieve with\nthe design system. It answers four questions:\n\n  * **What** is the goal for our design system?\n  * **Why** is that goal important?\n  * **How** will the design system help us?\n  * **Who** is the design system for?\n\nImagine your organization answers those questions like this:\n\n  * **What is the goal?** Our design system will free up more time for innovation and creativity. \n  * **Why is it important?** If we don’t increase our innovation, our product could grow stagnant and be surpassed by a competitor. \n  * **How will it help us?** By resolving common, recurring situations with repeatable patterns so product teams can focus on new problems. \n  * **Who is it for?** Our internal product teams.\n\nThis purpose statement is all about driving innovation. The resulting design\nsystem might focus on tooling that would allow teams to rapidly prototype. You\nwould be able to measure the design system’s success if the products grew more\ninnovative over time.\n\nHere’s another way to answer those questions:\n\n  * **What is the goal?** Our design system will make the quality of our products better for our audiences. \n  * **Why is it important?** If our audiences are met with confusing, inconsistent workflows, we’ll lose their trust. \n  * **How will it help us?** By unifying the people that are creating our products through shared tools, guidelines, and principles. \n  * **Who is it for?** Our internal product teams, in service of our audiences.\n\nThis purpose statement is more focused on improving the user experience than\non innovation. The resulting design system would also focus more on aligning\nteams, encouraging people to talk and share internally. You would know if this\ndesign system was successful by doing usability testing before and after it\nwas implemented to see if user experiences felt more cohesive.\n\nTo find your purpose statement, bring key stakeholders together to answer\nthese four key questions, and then discuss the results as a group. You may\nfind that while there’s agreement that a design system is important, there’s\ndisagreement on the goal or _why_ it’s important. Getting aligned on exactly\nwhat you want to accomplish—and how you’ll know you’ve succeeded—will set the\ndesign system on the right path from the beginning.\n\nDefining your purpose statement up front helps you prioritize and make\ndecisions later on. If you have to choose between building an average\nexperience that only uses reusable components or an excellent experience that\nrequires new or adjusted components, how will you decide?\n\nThe best way to answer these questions is to listen to your users.\n\n### Listening to users\n\nLike Vignelli and Noorda, we need to go underground and pay attention to user\nneeds and behaviors. Successful design systems need to serve many audiences:\ndesigners, developers, content strategists, products managers, and, of course,\nend users. Interviewing these users will help you set a purpose.\n\nTalking to the people who will be using the design system you’re creating is\nkey to making a design system they will actually use. The biggest thing you\ncan gain from this is finding out what they need and what to focus your\nefforts on.\n\nSet up some interviews with the users of your design system. Be sure to talk\nto people from different disciplines, as well as people with different levels\nof experience.\n\nUncover problems:\n\n  * What are their biggest pain points?\n  * Where are they currently duplicating their efforts in inefficient ways?\n  * Where is communication between designers and engineers starting to break down?\n\nUncover goals:\n\n  * What would a design system help them achieve?\n  * What information do they need from a style guide?\n  * How would they want this information presented?\n  * What rationale would they need in order to trust the information in a style guide? \n\nThese questions are very tool-focused. They’ll help you understand how tools\nlike component libraries and style guides can make a team’s work more\nefficient.\n\nBut they won’t help you understand how a design system can help improve\nalignment and collaboration. To understand this, you need to dig into how\nteams are currently working. Even if your team doesn’t have a documented style\nguide, it has systems. These systems are the habits teams develop over time.\nIt’s important to dig into these questions as well.\n\n  * How are different disciplines currently collaborating?\n  * How do teams define quality?\n  * How do teams know if they’re aligned? \n  * How do teams define good design?\n  * How do you know if work is ready to ship? \n  * What resources and documentation already exist?\n\nThese questions will give you a baseline understanding about how aligned your\nteam currently is. If people have inconsistent definitions of good design, for\nexample, that misalignment is probably reflected in your products.\n\nIt’s also important to understand how your design system will benefit your\nproduct’s customers. In Chapter 2, we’ll talk about how to create a map of\nyour ecosystem to help you identify how to prioritize your work in a way that\nwill help end users.\n\n## Creating Aligning Principles\n\nDesigning products requires making hundreds of decisions quickly. A small team\ncan rely on tribal knowledge to ensure that those decisions are consistent.\nBut as teams grow, the ability to make aligned, consistent decisions becomes\nharder. Your products won’t feel cohesive if everyone is working from a\ndifferent definition of “quality.” To address this, we need to create a shared\nframework for decision-making. These are our design principles.\n\n_Design principles_ are a set of guidelines your team can follow throughout\ntheir design process in order to create more aligned experiences. Well-written\ndesign principles create alignment, speed up decision-making, and increase the\nquality of your team’s output. While shared components and visual styles help\nteams align on how their brand should look, shared principles help teams align\non how their brand should behave.\n\n### Effective principles\n\nTeams can sink a lot of time into creating principles, perhaps because the\nidea of a “principle” feels permanent. You won’t be carving these principles\ninto stone! Principles can and do change. What’s most important is that your\nprinciples reflect the purpose you’ve defined and the values you want to\nembody _today_ , and that everyone building and using the design system is\naligned on them. The process of creating your principles should be inclusive\nand shaped by all of the people you hope will adopt those principles.\n\nEffective design principles should be:\n\n  1. Specific and opinionated\n  2. Grown from within your team\n  3. Decision-making tools\n\n#### Specific and opinionated\n\nThere are two types of principles: universal and specific\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-01/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-01/)). _Universal\nprinciples_ are broadly applicable and can be used for all kinds of design.\n“Delightful” and “simple” are examples of universal principles. By contrast,\n_specific principles_ map directly to a specific product and are used to align\nteams around a common language. To create expressive design systems, you need\nspecific principles.\n\nHave you ever gone into a design critique and heard the feedback, “But that\ndoesn’t _feel_ like us?” The point of creating principles is to codify what it\nmeans to create a product that feels like your company. What decisions would\nyour company make that other companies wouldn’t?\n\nThese principles should not only be specific to your product, but should also\nembody the qualities you want your user experience to have. Take, for example,\nIntercom’s principle of “Designing conversations, not transactions”\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-02/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-02/)). A\n_transaction_ feels cold, robotic, formal—like submitting a help request into\na void. A _conversation_ , on the other hand, feels warm, human, helpful. This\nprinciple starts to tell me how the product should feel (Fig 1.3), and steers\ndesigners on that team away from building experiences that feel formal and\ndisconnected from their users.\n\n![Side-by-side comparison of two conversational styles, showing a text chat\nbetween two humans on the left, and an email help form to a company on the\nright.](image/1.3_Intercom.png)\n\nFig 1.3: Intercom demonstrates the difference between a conversation with a\nperson and a conversation with a business.\n\n#### Grown from within your team\n\nPrinciples should feel like they’re aligned with your team values and your\nproduct’s purpose, not unfamiliar to them. Start with principles that are\nalready baked into your culture and how your team works. You want your\nprinciples to feel true to your organization.\n\nAs designer Mark Boulton describes it:\n\n> All you do is be mindful of when the team repeats design desires. This could\n> be several members of the team say the same thing in a slightly different\n> way, or that you keep circling around and around a problem but struggle to\n> articulate it. By being mindful at all times to this a team can quickly pull\n> together principles that are derived from doing the work on their particular\n> problem rather than principles which are imposed on the work.\n> ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-03/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-03/))\n\nTeam members need to believe in these principles in order for them to be\nuseful. The principles should feel like a conversation among team members—not\nsomething that has been imposed on them. When you’re interviewing your\ninternal team, pay attention to how they define “good design.” What themes\nemerge? If several people mention the importance of making experiences clear\nand efficient, you may want to codify that as a principle, like “Clear over\nclever.” Often, these principles already exist within people’s minds, but need\nsome work to define and document.\n\n#### Decision-making tools\n\nGood design principles help your team make decisions faster. Without clear\nbenchmarks, design reviews can become subject to whim and opinion. Principles\ngive structure to design feedback so you can make sound decisions more\nefficiently.\n\nSalesforce’s JD Vogt explains how design principles helped their team make\ndecisions more quickly:\n\n> It became clear that we lacked a framework for up-leveling and accelerating\n> the discussion. We needed a way for everyone in the room to grok the\n> intention, so we could align on the path forward. We needed prioritized\n> principles to guide our communication and decision making.\n\n> We started to use these principles when discussing designs amongst\n> ourselves. When creating designs, we’d consciously remind ourselves that the\n> experiences we were creating should be clear, efficient, consistent, and\n> beautiful. When reviewing design options, we’d run it through the same\n> gauntlet. With practice, it became easier to rationalize a decision and pick\n> a path forward.”\n> ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-04/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-04/))\n\nGood design principles can help your team get better at justifying decisions,\narticulating that justification, and connecting back to your purpose and\nvalues at every turn.\n\n### Establishing your principles\n\nYou don’t want to create principles in a vacuum and then drop them on your\nteam. Instead, bring people together to craft principles collaboratively.\n\nStart by holding a principles workshop, either in person or remotely. The\nbenefit of developing these principles in a workshop is that it generates\nmomentum across your organization.\n\n  1. **Choose a cross-disciplinary team.** You want to focus on alignment across teams, not just individuals. Bring together a representative group of designers, engineers, researchers, content strategists, and other key stakeholders. \n  2. **Gather your materials.** If you’re running this workshop in person, you’ll need Post-its, Sharpies, and dot-voting stickers. If you’re running this workshop remotely, you can use any digital card-sorting tool with video conferencing. I like to use Trello for this exercise, because the cards are sortable and feel tactile. \n  3. **Establish your goals.** Set up the meeting by establishing the purpose. Explain what principles are and how they help. Share examples of effective principles. I’ve found it useful to share examples of effective principles and how they are reflected in products. \n  4. **Brainstorm principles.** Have everyone jot down one idea for a principle per Post-it note (if meeting in person) or Trello card (if meeting remotely)—one principle per card! Give people enough time to generate five or six cards.\n  5. **Converge and theme.** Participants can take turns reading their principles aloud and sticking the Post-its on walls. As the workshop facilitator, you can start to group these Post-its into themes (or designate other workshop members to do so). You can use this same process remotely on Trello by grouping cards in the same lanes. \n  6. **Rank and vote.** Have your team vote on the principles that resonate most with them. Which ones feel most like your company? If you’re meeting in person, you can use dot-voting: give everyone three dot stickers and ask them to place them on the principles that resonate with them the most. If you’re running this workshop remotely, team members can join Trello cards to “vote.” Talk about the principles that got the most votes as a group. Why did they resonate?\n\nIdeally, you will leave this workshop with a long list of principles that have\nbeen grouped into themes and rated. The next step is making the principles\nshort and memorable. I’ve found that once you go over five principles, people\nstart forgetting them. Aim for five principles and focus on making the\nlanguage as clear as possible. Then prepare to share them more broadly so the\nprinciples get used.\n\n### Using your principles\n\nDesign principles can be considered a tool, just like a UI kit. They should be\napplied throughout the design process in order to create better experiences.\nDesign your principles with adoption in mind.\n\n#### Pilot principles with teams\n\nOne way to treat principles like a tool is to soft-launch them with a few\nproduct teams. Test your principles with a handful of teams at different\nstages in their process. How will the principles help the teams decide on a\nstrategy or refine an implementation? Get insights from these teams about how\neasy it was (or wasn’t) to use the principles. Did they feel tangible enough\nto apply to their work? These insights will help you refine your principles\nbefore you release them more broadly.\n\n#### Make them stick\n\nPrinciples will only be effective if they become part of your team’s shared\nlanguage. Get people excited about them! Posters can keep principles in\neveryone’s sight (Fig 1.4). If you have remote employees that can’t see\nposters in an office, creating desktop wallpapers for work computers can help\nthose employees feel included.\n\n![Four posters showing the Salesforce design principles of Clarify,\nEfficiency, Consistency, and Beauty overlaid on graphic representations of San\nFrancisco landmarks.](image/1.4_SalesforcePosters.png)\n\nFig 1.4: These posters helped the Salesforce team evangelize their design\nprinciples.\n\nAt Shopify, principles became a topic of weekly discussion in our team’s UX\nSlack channel. We would discuss, say, what it meant for a product to feel\n“crafted” and share examples of other products, digital or not, that\nexemplified that principle. This helped reinforce our principles among team\nmembers and added more nuance to our understanding.\n\n#### Turn your principles into decision-making tools\n\nPut your principles into practice by coming up with tools that make it easier\nto apply them. For example, you could create a design review template that has\nthe principles baked in, or scorecards for teams to measure themselves against\nthe principles in project retrospectives.\n\nIn “Design Doesn’t Scale,” Stanley Wood describes how the team at Spotify\ncreated an acronym from their design principles:\n\n> Looking for more ways to define quality, we recently began asking if a\n> design is “in TUNE”, an acronym to measure all parts of the experience,\n> including how it feels to use Spotify. This is helping to shape a strong\n> narrative around the emotive aspects of our experience, and be mindful that\n> the interface is the brand.\n\n  * Tone. Are we using the right kind of tone of voice for our brand?\n  * Usable. Is it accessible to everyone?\n  * Necessary. Is that functionality really needed?\n  * Emotive. Does it feel good to use? Feel like somebody cares? ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-05/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/01-05/))\n\nThese aren’t the typical kinds of tools you might expect to come out of a\ndesign system, but they are important because they give teams a shared\ndefinition of quality. We’ll only be able to build better products faster if\nwe can define what “better” means to us.\n\nThese principles will also come in handy when teams need to diverge\nmeaningfully from something in the system. If they need to create a new\npattern, aligning to the principles will improve the chances of this new\npattern feeling aligned with the rest of the product.\n\n## A Strong Foundation\n\nYour principles will evolve over time. As your product grows and business\nchanges, some of your old principles may no longer seem relevant. Give\nyourself space to revisit and evaluate whether your principles still work for\nyou.\n\nEven though component libraries and style guides are the most visible outcomes\nof a system, it’s important to start with your purpose. A design system that\nhas a solid purpose and principles, even with just a handful of components,\nwill be more cohesive and dynamic than a system with hundreds of components\nbut no shared purpose, principles, or foundation.\n\nNow that we’ve discussed how to define your system’s purpose and keep teams\naligned towards that purpose, let’s talk about the process behind a design\nsystem.\n\n\n# Chapter 2. The Process Behind the System\n\n![](image/2.png)\n\nBrasilia, the capital of Brazil, is a planned city, built in the 1950s to\nshowcase a futuristic vision of what a city could be. The plan was created by\nLucio Costa and Oscar Neimeyer, who dreamed of a deliberate and orderly city\nthat would contrast with other organically grown Brazilian cities like Rio de\nJaneiro ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-01/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-01/)).\n\nFrom ten thousand feet above, the city resembles an airplane or a soaring\nbird. At that macro level, the design of the city is perfectly rational, with\nclear separations of administrative, industrial, commercial, residential, and\nrecreational areas. The individual buildings are striking examples of\nmodernist architecture. So what went wrong?\n\nThere were two big problems with the design of Brasilia: it couldn’t scale,\nand it didn’t consider how real people behave in cities. Brasilia was designed\nfor five hundred thousand people. The city now has a population of two\nmillion, with only ten percent living in the original planned city. The rest\nhave created their own communities on the outskirts. The plan also didn’t\ncontain the ingredients of a typical city: messy streets, plazas, sidewalks,\nmeeting places. And Brasilia was built to be traversed by car, making it\ndifficult for pedestrians to get around.\n\nBrasilia contains many beautiful components, but they don’t all work together\nas a city because its design didn’t consider people’s needs.\n\nWe’re not building anything as vast or permanent as a city. But design\nsystems, like cities, need proper planning in order to work well. A well-\nplanned system is easy to use, inspires participation, and grows stronger over\ntime. A poorly planned system feels disjointed, confusing, and difficult to\nuse. And if you don’t plan your system well, people will start creating their\nown systems on the outskirts.\n\nBefore you design any components, start your design system by doing a series\nof inventories and mapping exercises. Take a broad view of your entire product\necosystem before getting into more granular, individual components. It may\nfeel tedious at first, but this planning will help you make better decisions\nlater on.\n\n## Mapping Your Ecosystem\n\nWhen you start developing a design system, you need to answer some big\nquestions:\n\n  * What products will this system serve? \n  * Which people should we involve? \n  * What is the scope of this system? \n\nPlanning will help you focus. The first step is to understand your system as\nit exists today. What products or services exist? What is their relationship\nto one another?\n\n### Product and user inventory\n\nWe’re going to kick off the planning process by creating a product and user\ninventory. This works best as a collaborative exercise with everyone in the\ndesign systems team; that way, you can draw on your collective memory. Doing\nthis exercise might reveal products you didn’t even know existed.\n\nCarve out a couple of hours as a group and list as many products as possible.\nStart with the obvious: what are the core products your audiences interact\nwith daily? Then move on to smaller products. List actual product names (like\n“Gmail”) instead of broad categories (like “mobile apps”).\n\nYour list will vary in complexity based on the size of your organization. If\nyou’re creating a design system for a large website, your “products” may\nactually be distinct sections or pages of your site that are owned and managed\nby different people. For example, a University site may list “Home,” “Course\nCatalog,” “Library,” “Admissions,” and “Virtual Tour.” If you’re a large\ncorporation, you may have many products across a range of platforms. A bank,\nfor example, may have separate websites for banking and credit cards as well\nas several iOS and Android apps.\n\nAfter you’ve created a list of your products, the next step is to create a\nlist of your audiences. What different types of people use your products? As\nyou create this list, you may also want to note who your primary audience is.\nYou will eventually want to go further and start thinking about the types of\ntasks each audience performs when they use your products, but you don’t need\nto do that just yet.\n\nIf you finish this exercise feeling surprised or overwhelmed by the scope of\nyour product landscape, don’t worry. At this point, we’re just trying to\nunderstand the bigger picture. We’ll get more granular as we move through the\nplanning.\n\n#### Document the inventory in a spreadsheet\n\nYou want the information you gather to be shareable and to serve as a\nreference for future design-systems work. So expand on the list in a\nspreadsheet. Here’s some information that is most useful to document:\n\n  * **Product name.** What is the name of this product?\n  * **Platform.** What platform is this product on (Web, iOS, Android, etc.)?\n  * **Audience.** Who is the core audience for this product? \n  * **Purpose.** What is the primary purpose of this product? \n  * **Product owner.** Who is the product owner or team lead? \n\nDepending on your organization, you may also want to document the following:\n\n  * **Principles.** Does this product have any documented principles? \n  * **Brand language.** Does this product use a different brand language? If you’re working at a company that has multiple brands or sub-brands, make a note of that.\n  * **Other metadata.** Make a note of anything else that can help your planning process. Has this product team expressed interest in the design system? Is this product due for a redesign, or has it recently undergone one? \n\nAt this point, you’re not making any decisions. You’re just deepening your\nunderstanding of the landscape so you can make informed decisions later.\n\n### Drawing an ecosystem map\n\nAll of this context you’ve gathered about your products and audiences will\nhelp you create an ecosystem map. An ecosystem map reveals the connections\nbetween your users and your products.\n\nSmall, iterative changes can dilute your brand voice and make it uneven over\ntime. You may not notice any inconsistency unless you happen to see two\njuxtaposed screens showing different brand applications. Ecosystem mapping\nallows you to perceive this inconsistency through the eyes of an end user.\n\nRemember when I said, in Chapter 1, that cohesion is harder to accomplish than\nunity when creating a design system? An ecosystem map helps you understand how\nyour experiences lack cohesion. In the context of your organization, your\necosystem contains all of your products across all platforms. Your users are\ntraveling from place to place in order to accomplish their tasks. Along that\npath, they might be met with inconsistent naming, visual styles, or\ninteraction patterns.\n\nIt’s valuable to perform an ecosystem mapping exercise as a collaborative\nworkshop, especially if you include representatives from different product\nlines in addition to the design-systems team. Besides spotting\ninconsistencies, you’re also developing a shared understanding of how users\nexperience your products.\n\nTo create an ecosystem map:\n\n  1. **Choose an audience type.** Select an audience type from your user inventory. It makes sense to start with your primary audience types. \n  2. **List the tasks they perform on a daily basis.** Using Post-it notes, write down the tasks this audience type performs on a daily basis. For instance, if you’re working on a website for a university, those tasks might be applying for admission, scheduling a campus visit, applying for financial aid, etc. \n  3. **Break a task out into a user flow.** Choose one task and break out the steps necessary to complete it. For instance, if your task is “applying for admission,” a user needs to research the programs, find key dates, and submit the application.\n  4. **Map the flow to the sections of your product.** One way to do this is by using Post-its. Use one color for your users, another color for your tasks, and a third color for the pages or sections a user will visit to complete that task. Place the user at the center and cluster their tasks around them, followed by the corresponding pages in the outer ring (Fig 2.1). If your product is on multiple platforms, take that into account as well. How does a user complete the task of “applying for admission” on a website versus a mobile app? \n  5. **Write down which teams are responsible for each of the sections.** Pay attention to moments where several teams are responsible for different parts of one flow. In the example above, you might have one team responsible for the “homepage,” another responsible for the “admissions page,” and still another responsible for the “applicant submission” process. Or you might have one team responsible for that entire flow on your website and a different team managing the flow for your mobile app. \n  6. **Repeat these steps as needed.** Repeat this process for other core flows and audience types.\n  7. **Visualize your ecosystem map.** After you’ve done the steps above for a few flows, you want to understand what each flow looks like from a user’s perspective. Choose a flow and take screenshots of each of the product sections. This will help you see how a user moves through the various sections of your products. \n\n![A collection of virtual sticky notes in digital whiteboarding tool Miro,\nmapping out a prospective student’s flow through a university\nwebsite.](image/2.1_Ecosystem_Map.png)\n\nFig 2.1: A sample ecosystem map. The inner ring (red) is the audience type,\nthe middle ring (orange) shows the different steps this audience type would\ntake to apply for college, and the outer ring (yellow) represents the\ndifferent site sections they’d need to interact with to carry out the tasks.\nThis hypothetical user would have to travel to at least three different\ndomains to complete everything.\n\nThis exercise works well in person with lots of sticky notes, but you can also\nuse a collaborative whiteboarding tool if your team is remote. I used Miro for\nthis example ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-02/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-02/)).\n\nPay special attention to the times when a user needs to travel across\ndifferent sections of products to complete a task. Do those flows feel\ncohesive? How much variation is there across the different products that make\nup one user journey? Look out for inconsistencies that would make a user feel\nlike they’re suddenly in a new experience (Fig 2.2).\n\n![Comparison of the Sprint International Support page and the Sprint Support\nchat interface, using different design elements despite being part of the same\nuser flow.](image/2.2.png)\n\nFig 2.2: Recently, I was looking for international customer support for my\nphone carrier. As I went through the flow, I felt like I had landed on a\ncompletely different website: the navigation, typography, spacing, and button\nstyling were completely different from the previous pages. I had to take the\ntime to make sure I was still on the Sprint website before I added my\ninformation. Inconsistencies like these can confuse and frustrate your users.\n\nVisual inconsistencies can be easy to spot, but be sure to keep an eye out for\ndifferent language describing the same task, which can also lead to confusion.\nSelene Hinkley, a content strategist on the Shopify Polaris team, found that\nacross the App store and Theme store, different terms were being used to\ndescribe the action of installing a theme onto a store (“Add Theme” versus\n“Install Theme”). Because the phrase “Add Theme” was more approachable and\nembodied the principles the team had established, the team updated all\nlanguage to use that term.\n\n### Evaluating your ecosystem map\n\nThe point of these activities is to help you figure out where to start in the\nplanning process.\n\nThere are many ways to begin design-system work: you can start with your\nvisual language, or you can start with small, basic components, like buttons.\nI recommend something else: start with the elements that will most improve the\nuser experience of your products.\n\nLet’s revisit the planning questions that I raised in the beginning:\n\n  * **What products will this system serve**? The product inventory can show you your core product. If you have multiple core products, start with products that share similar purposes and audiences. \n  * **Which people should we involve?** Your ecosystem map should illuminate which teams need to work more closely together. For example, you may discover that two teams that don’t work closely together are closely linked in a user’s journey. You may decide that part of your design-system work will involve bringing those teams closer together. \n  * **What is the scope of this system?** A design system’s scope is a combination of the products and people it serves and the parts it contains. At this point, you probably have an idea about the products and people, but still don’t know which parts to include in your initial release. We’ll get to that next.\n\nIn other words, you’re looking for where your system can have the biggest\nimpact. Consider these goals in your planning process:\n\n  * **Identify workflow pain points and opportunities.** As a user moves through a workflow, is there a similar concept that’s described in a different way? Are there specific flows where users are met with inconsistent navigation patterns? Where are users getting the most confused? \n  * **Find visual inconsistency.** Does your company look like it has a unified design language? This exercise should help you spot some of your biggest areas of visual inconsistency right away. This will especially be the case if your team has been iterating on design language in small bits over time (for example, if you’ve been experimenting with different illustration styles in a specific area). Seeing these things next to one another, through the lens of how a user sees them, will illuminate areas where your brand language is falling apart. \n  * **Organize across silos.** Even if your team is organized into silos, your users shouldn’t see that. This exercise can help you spot where the siloing leads to a lack of cohesion. And that, in turn, will let you determine how a design system can help you drive alignment across different feature teams. Creating this map gives you a good opportunity to form relationships with these product teams. \n\nEach of these goals maps to an aspect of your design system. If you find you\nhave a lot of uneven workflows, you may want to focus your attention on\nguidelines for how components are used to solve problems. If you mostly find\ninconsistency with components, think about how you might improve visual\nconsistency. If you find a lack of cohesion across your team’s product lines,\nyou may want to concentrate on unifying teams and encouraging them to talk\nwith one another more.\n\n## Taking Inventory\n\nYour product inventory should have given you a good understanding of the scope\nof your products. Your ecosystem mapping exercise should have revealed areas\nwhere your products lack cohesion. Up to this point, we’ve been looking\nbroadly. Now it’s time to go a level deeper to understand the current state of\nour design language and user interfaces.\n\nThe next step in the planning process is to create an audit. You’ve probably\nheard of an audit before, or conducted one yourself. It’s frequently\nrecommended as the first activity in any design-system process. I recommend\ndoing your audit after your product inventory and ecosystem map because\nauditing takes a lot of time. The previous exercises can help you narrow your\nscope, allowing you to focus on a few products or sections at a time.\n\nWhen you audit, you’re evaluating the quality and amount of variation in your\ndesign. You want to focus on two things: your design language and your user\ninterfaces. Your design language includes all of the elements that express\nyour brand visually: typography, color, iconography, shape, and space. Your\nuser interface is your components.\n\nSome folks recommend auditing the components and design language separately. I\nrecommend doing one audit, and then evaluating the results independently.\nThink of the auditing process like decluttering your closet. First, you want\nto take everything out of the closet. Then, you want to group similar items.\nAnd finally, you’ll get rid of items that are redundant or not providing\nvalue. If you try to do all of these steps at once, the process will take too\nlong and you’ll feel overwhelmed. The same is true for auditing your design\nlanguage and UI. Get everything out in the open, categorize, and then evaluate\nfor quality.\n\nHere’s what an auditing process looks like:\n\n  1. **Organize a team**. Auditing takes time. Working as a team can make it go faster, so no one suffers from audit fatigue. Another benefit: shared perspectives. It’s easy to quantify how many components you have, but it’s much harder to measure the quality of a component. Conducting an audit as a group enables you to develop a shared understanding of quality. \n  2. **Choose a tool**. Your auditing tool should be digital and collaborative. It should also allow you to add metadata, like where a component is located. Finally, the tool should be visual. You are, after all, evaluating the visual appearance of these components. Based on these criteria, I’ve found that AirTable ([airtable.com](http://airtable.com)) works best for this type of audit because it lets you switch between a traditional spreadsheet view and a gallery view (Fig 2.3).\n\n![A visual inventory of button styles and other interface elements displayed\nin an Airtable audit.](image/2.3_AirTable.png)\n\nFig 2.3: AirTable’s gallery view makes it easy to see visual inconsistencies\nin the user interface, as in this audit Vivian Li conducted at Qwilr\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-03/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-03/)).\n\n  3. **Decide on categories**. Choose the categories you’ll be auditing. You may want to divide your audit into three big categories: UI components, content display components, and visual styles. _UI components_ include small elements like form fields and buttons. _Content display components_ refer to larger components like a hero module or a story card. _Visual styles_ indicate your design language—elements like type and color. After you’ve decided on the categories, assign them to people on the team. \n  4. **Screenshot and categorize**. Next comes the work of taking and categorizing screenshots. Each auditor reviews your products, taking screenshots of the components and entering relevant information into the spreadsheet. Your spreadsheet should include an image of the component, the component’s name, and the component’s location.\n\nDepending on the scope of your products, an audit can take several weeks. Once\nyou’ve completed this process, it’s time to interpret the results.\n\n### Evaluate your design language\n\nThe purpose of a visual audit is to evaluate your design language across your\nproducts. You’re looking for unity. Do all of your brand elements currently\nhold together to tell one story? Broadly, you want to understand two\nthings—quality and quantity:\n\n  * **How well does your design language express your brand?** You need some way to measure whether your design language is effective—that is, how well it expresses your brand. Before you start evaluating, it’s helpful to come prepared with any documentation of your strategic brand guidelines. That could be a brand playbook, brand purpose statement, or design principles. I’ve seen teams use a print style guide or printed material as the true representation of their brand and evaluate their digital presence against it. \n  * **Is your design language consistent?** While the first question is all about the quality of your design language, here you want to understand the _quantity_ of your design elements. Are you using design elements in a consistent way? Are primary buttons always blue? Is the body copy `18px` throughout the site? For each of your categories, add up how many variations currently exist. Type sizes and color hex codes are common culprits of inconsistency. \n\nBoth questions are important. In general, I’ve seen audits focus more on\nanswering the second question. However, if your design language is consistent\nbut it doesn’t express your brand, then your language isn’t working.\n\nThis exercise should help you understand whether you need a full-scale\nredesign or just some realignment. If your brand language clearly expresses\nthe mission of your products but there are some outliers, then you may just\nneed to make some adjustments.\n\n### Evaluate your components\n\nNext, you need to evaluate your components. As with the visual audit, we want\nto understand quantity as well as quality. However, we’ll start with quantity\nand then evaluate quality once we’ve narrowed down our component list:\n\n  * **Which components are used most frequently?** First, you’ll find some components that recur often because they are the basic building blocks of any digital product—buttons, accordions, checkboxes, tabs. I consider these _high-frequency components_ because they repeat so often throughout digital products. \n  * **Which high-frequency components are unique to your products?** Chances are that in addition to these basic components, your specific product has a few larger components that repeat often, like Airbnb’s listing cards, or the _Guardian_ ’s story cards (Fig 2.4). I consider these _high-value components_. They might not repeat as often as high-frequency components, but they have a huge role in defining the experience of your product. Improving the functionality and design of high-value components is a great way to improve the overall design quality of your products. \n\n![Two listing cards for Airbnb and two story cards for the Guardian, all\nshowing design elements specific to the brands.](image/2.4.png)\n\nFig 2.4: Airbnb’s listing card and the _Guardian_ ’s story card repeat\nfrequently and are specific to their product, making them good design-system\ncontenders.\n\nFor your first design-system release, you’ll want to choose a blend of both\nhigh-frequency and high-volume components.\n\n### Group components by purpose\n\nAs useful as they are, these inventories don’t help us understand _why_ the\ncomponents exist, or what problems they solve.\n\nIn her book _Design Systems_ , Alla Kholmatova proposes the idea of a\n_purpose-directed inventory_. While a visual inventory focuses on grouping\nthings by appearance and type, like buttons and forms, this inventory groups\nitems by _purpose_.\n\nYou may have two patterns that look different but solve similar problems, or\ntwo patterns that look similar but solve different problems. To spot these\nsorts of patterns, define components (and their variations) by the problem\nthey solve instead of by their visual style.\n\nWhen components lack clarity and purpose, the result is inconsistency. If you\ndon’t define a purpose, you may get designers and engineers making a new\nversion of a component for a small visual change. An increase in the number of\none-off components across your system will increase technical and design\ndebt—the exact opposite of what you want.\n\nGrouping components by purpose works best to help you understand your larger\ncomponents, especially ones that display content. That’s because the variation\non smaller components, like buttons, tends to be visual, not conceptual.\n\nAsk your auditors to work together to group components they think serve a\nsimilar purpose. This usually leads to some debate about each component’s\npurpose until people start to get aligned. Eventually, you’ll have a pile of\ncomponents that seem like they’re solving the same problem.\n\nHow do you know if components are solving the same problem? Ignore the visual\ndesign for a moment and focus on the content. Consider four components from my\nlocal library’s website (Fig 2.5). The purpose of each component is to preview\nbook information, such as:\n\n  * thumbnail of the book cover\n  * book title\n  * author name \n  * publication date \n  * type of book \n  * availability \n\nWhy do only some display an author name? How relevant is the publication date\nto the action the user is taking? These are good questions to dig into once we\nget to consolidating components.\n\n![Four components from the same library website, each displaying different\npieces of metadata with varying visual styles. ](image/2.5_Book-\nComponents.png)\n\nFig 2.5: This set of components all offer varying information about a book,\nbut at first glance, it’s unclear whether those variations are intentional.\nDigging into the content and how it differs across components is a good way to\nstart consolidating them.\n\n### Consolidate your components\n\nIt’s very likely that you found a lot of redundant components in your audit.\nYou can’t bring all of the existing components into your new system because\nyour goal is to reduce design and technical debt. You need to determine\nwhether a component adds value before you try to bring it into the new system.\n\nWhen we were creating a unified feature template at Vox, we identified eighty-\none HTML components—like pull quotes, captions, and galleries—that editors\nused via the CMS to make their stories more robust. We needed a way to whittle\nthat list down to something more manageable. The team established some\ncriteria to evaluate whether the existing snippets were worth including:\n\n  * **Does it add value?** Value, in this case, was determined by whether or not editorial teams found the snippets enhanced their storytelling. There were a few ways we identified value. If a snippet was used more frequently, we assumed it provided more value. We also talked to editorial teams about how they put stories together. \n  * **Is it available to three or more brands?** If it’s common enough to be used by three or more of our eight brands, then we can bring it into the new system.\n  * **Is it a must-have for one brand?** If it’s absolutely critical to the editorial mission of a brand, then we can make an exception to the “three or more” rule.\n  * **Does it engage readers?** Analytics can also provide insight into which of your existing components perform the best. If you have several components that serve the same purpose, you can use analytics to determine if some are more successful than others. For example, if you have several recirculation modules—maybe one with large images, one with small images, and one with no images—you could see which one drives more page views, and then use that as the model for a new, consolidated component.\n  * **Does it uphold the design principles?** Lastly, use the design principles you’ve set to measure the success of your existing components. Rank similar components against your values to see which ones meet your quality standards. Let’s say one of your principles is “Clarity”—if you have a component that makes it very clear to a user what their next step should be, and a similar component that doesn’t, you could remove the more ambiguous component. \n\nAt this point, we’ve created a map of our ecosystem, which told us where we\nshould focus our efforts first. We’ve gone one level deeper with a component\naudit to determine which components are used most frequently. We’ve\nestablished some criteria for measuring the success of these existing\ncomponents. Now let’s begin the work of creating the system.\n\n## Beginning Your System\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this book, your team is already working in\nsystems, whether they are documented or not. Now that you’ve completed your\necosystem mapping and audits, it’s time to ask yourself if you are happy with\nthe existing system.\n\nThat will help you figure out where to start. Your research should lead you to\none of two conclusions:\n\n  1. Your existing system is working well. You want to document what’s working about it and create reusable patterns so everyone on your team can benefit.\n  2. Your existing system isn’t working well. You want to improve the system. \n\nWhat does “working well” mean? One of the reasons to set up design principles\nin the beginning is so you can answer this question objectively. “Working\nwell” means the product is upholding your design principles, the design\nlanguage is communicating your brand voice, and the design system as a whole\nis responding to user needs.\n\nYou may find that some aspects of your system work better than others. Say\nyou’re happy with your typography system, but your color system doesn’t\nexpress your brand accurately. Since design systems aren’t linear, you may\ndiscover through the process of documenting your typography system that it\nactually isn’t working as well as you initially thought and that you need to\nimprove it. That’s okay! Systems are meant to evolve as context accumulates.\n\nAt this juncture, you want to find a starting point that will be the most\nvaluable for your team, either by documenting what already exists or by\nstarting from scratch.\n\n### Start by documenting what exists\n\nIf you find your existing system is working well, your goal will primarily be\nto unify and document what exists. Many teams use one or two core products\nthat work well as the starting point for their design system.\n\nWith this approach, you’re starting with an existing product and distilling\nits proven patterns into a design system. The benefit of this approach is that\nyou’re starting with patterns that have been vetted. This way is quicker\nbecause you don’t have to design lots of new things. Instead, you’re\ncataloging what works well so other teams can benefit. If you find you have\ntoo many components that are solving similar problems, you can use the core\nproduct as a starting point for consolidation.\n\nThere is a downside to this approach, though. The patterns may be too specific\nto one product. Other teams may feel left out of the process and as if they\nhave to use a system that doesn’t fully reflect their needs. You have to pay\nclose attention to involving other teams in this work.\n\n### Start from scratch\n\nThe other option is to start from scratch. This is usually the way to go if\nyou find your design language isn’t working well. With this approach, you\nstart by creating a brand-new design language, exploring how that design\nlanguage might work across multiple products, and creating reusable\ncomponents. This approach can lead to a more well-rounded system, because it\ncompels you to explore how the design language works across a range of\nproducts.\n\nThe risk of this approach is that it takes longer, and you may spend too much\ntime exploring a design language in the abstract. The danger here is that an\nelement that works well in isolation might not work well in context. For\ninstance, a primary button style that looks bright and vibrant on its own may\nfeel too overwhelming when it’s placed around other components. Or the spacing\nbuilt into a component doesn’t work once it’s around other ones. In Chapter 3,\nI’ll talk about how you can explore a design language by looking across a\ncomponent hierarchy, so that you can look at design elements both by\nthemselves and in context. However, the best way to avoid this problem is by\nstarting small and integrating a few elements of your new design language into\nproducts so you can get a sense of how they feel in actual products.\n\nAfter your audit and planning work, you will have a list of tasks to start\nfrom. Regardless of where you landed, it’s very likely that part of your work\nwill include unifying and documenting a set of components.\n\n### What makes a good component?\n\nNo matter which entry point you choose, you’re working toward a system of\n_good_ design components—components that are:\n\n  * **Purposeful.** All of your components should solve a specific problem. Define them by their purpose, not by how they look. \n  * **Reusable.** Your components should work for multiple use cases. Reduce the number of components that only work for a singular use case.\n  * **Flexible.** They should work in many different contexts. If you design components that are too rigid, people will create their own components and you’ll end up with a bloated system.\n\nBy now, you will have a collection of components to work with—components that\nhave the potential to be good, solve specific problems, and provide value to\nyour system. A big part of design-system work is gathering, consolidating, and\ndocumenting components until your first release.\n\n### The process at work\n\nTo understand how this all works together, consider Vox Media’s scorecard\ncomponent (Fig 2.6). A scorecard is displayed in a review to show the author’s\nrating of that particular product. Although scorecards at Eater, the _Verge_ ,\nand Polygon all look visually distinct, they all solve the same problem: “Show\nan author’s rating and summary of a review.”\n\nIn order to identify the points where these components aligned—and didn’t—we\nmapped out the user goals and content for each (Fig 2.7).\n\n![Comparison of scorecard components from Eater, the Verge, and Polygon,\nshowing considerable visual variation.](image/2.6_Eater-Scorecard-b.png)\n\nFig 2.6: Eater, the _Verge_ , and Polygon each used to have very different\nscorecards—but to what end? They all solved the same problem of summarizing\nreviews.\n\nAll three scorecards showed a score; two of the three included a title and a\ntext field. We decided that at a minimum, the scorecard component should\ncontain a score, a title, and a text field.\n\n**Brand** | **User goal** | **Content**  \n---|---|---  \nEater | Find where to eat and what to order | \n\n  * Score\n  * Title\n  * Address\n  * Cost\n  * Book a table\n  * Text field\n\n  \nThe _Verge_ | Find a tech gadget to buy | \n\n  * Score\n  * Title\n  * Product image\n  * Pro/con list\n  * Buy buttons\n  * Text field\n\n  \nPolygon | Find a game to play | \n\n  * Score\n  * Platform(s)\n  * Publisher\n  * Release date\n\n  \nFig 2.7: Mapping the goals and content for each brand’s scorecard component\nhelped us identify how we might be able to design a single component that\nwould work for all three.\n\nThe result was a baseline component: the product card, a flexible component\nthat could be applied broadly across our brands. If you swapped out the gadget\nimage for an image of a kitchen appliance, for example, the design would still\nwork (Fig 2.8).\n\n![A product card displaying score, title, and image, and text\nfield.](image/2.8_Product_Card.png)\n\nFig 2.8: The product card includes a score, a title, and a text field, all\ncommon elements to scorecards across the brand. It’s flexible enough to be\napplied in many different contexts.\n\nBut we also had to consider the content that was different across the original\nscorecards, and why it was different. For instance, when looking at an Eater\nscorecard for a restaurant review, end users need to know venue information\nlike the address and phone number. When looking at a game review at Polygon,\nthey need to know the publisher, developers, and comparative scores across\ngaming platforms.\n\nThese were necessary, brand-specific pieces of information, so we created two\nvariations on the product card: the venue card and the game card. Each\nvariation drew attention to the content that was specific to that card (Fig\n2.9).\n\n![Comparison of a venue card and a game card, showing the same base\ninformation of the product card, with additional metadata to support brand\nvariations.](image/2.9_Venue-Game_Cards-redo.png)\n\nFig 2.9: The venue card and the game card—two variations on the product\ncard—show information specific to Eater and Polygon, respectively.\n\nAnother benefit of basing components and their variations on their purpose\n(instead of on their visual style) is that it lets you iterate on them over\ntime. Once a component is integrated into a product, product teams can measure\nhow well the component solves the problem it is targeting. This allows teams\nto feel more confident about evolving and improving components.\n\n## Documenting Components\n\nStrong, clear, thorough documentation is an important part of any design\nsystem. A component or pattern is only as good as the guidance that explains\nhow to use it. Your documentation should help everyone building products\nunderstand how to use your components to craft experiences. Explain the\npurpose of each component and the UX rationale behind it so that everyone\ninvolved with the system can use the components thoughtfully.\n\n### Name it\n\nThe naming of a component should be as diverse and cross-disciplinary as your\nteam is. In “The Language of Modular Design,” Alla Kholmatova explained the\nimportance of collaborative naming: “It’s not so much about giving something a\ngreat name (although, of course, that’s an ideal to aspire to), but\n_agreeing_ on the name. That determines how the element will be used and helps\nto ensure that it’s used consistently by everyone”\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-04/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/02-04/)). Designers,\nengineers, product managers, content strategists—all should inform the name of\nyour component.\n\nEstablishing a clear, shared language helps us make better decisions about the\npurpose of each of our components and how they should be used. It improves\ncollaboration and speeds up design and development.\n\nA good component name should be:\n\n  * **Purposeful.** A name should describe the purpose of the component, not what it looks like. \n  * **Specific.** A name should be as straightforward as possible. \n  * **Inclusive.** Use language that everyone can understand. Because design systems serve many types of people who have varying levels of technical expertise, it’s important to give components names that most people can understand.\n\nWhile metaphors can be memorable, they can be tough to scale. At Vox Media, we\nused a “river” metaphor to describe a list of articles. Content flowed down a\n“river” and could be interrupted by “rocks” and “breakers,” like Most Read\nmodules. This metaphor made sense to the team that created it, but onboarding\nnew people became increasingly difficult. Explaining the river metaphor every\ntime a new person joined the team was a source of friction. A better name for\n“River” would be “Story Feed.” The name is more straightforward and\ndescriptive. It lets people know that this component is a collection of\nstories. Because the concept of a “feed” is well established throughout the\nweb and publishing industries, new team members find that language familiar.\n\n### Draft some guidelines\n\nAt a minimum, your component documentation should include these elements:\n\n  * **Name and description** : A title and short description that helps users quickly understand what the component or pattern is.\n  * **Purpose:** A scannable statement that explains the purpose of the component. You want designers and developers to be thoughtful about how each component fits into the bigger picture. \n  * **Example:** Preferably an example of the component at work, both in design and in code.\n\nYou may also want to include:\n\n  * **When to use it** : The situations in which a component or pattern should be implemented.\n  * **When not to use it** : Specific situations where you know a pattern will not work, and what to use instead.\n  * **Content guidelines** : How content should be written for this component based on what it needs to communicate to users.\n  * **Related patterns** : Other patterns or components in the system that may be related in purpose, presentation, or content.\n\n### Meet your users’ needs\n\nDesign systems serve many types of users. In order to write effective\ndocumentation, figure out who your primary system users are and what they need\nto understand about using the components. Conduct interviews to learn about\nother teams’ processes, degrees of technical expertise, and what would best\nserve them in working with the system.\n\nShopify’s Polaris team did research with different teams to understand how\nthey each used existing design-system documentation. They discovered that\ndesigners and content strategists were likely to scroll to find a more\ndetailed rationale behind how to use components. Developers, on the other\nhand, craved efficiency; they wanted to be able to grab component code as\nquickly as possible. Because of this, Shopify created documentation that\npresented components with code snippets first, and content guidelines farther\ndown (Fig 2.10).\n\n![Documentation for the card component in Shopify’s Polaris system, showing\ncode guidelines, design guidelines, and content guidelines.](image/2.10.png)\n\nFig 2.10: Shopify’s component documentation gathers guidance for code, design,\nand content all in one place, organized for use by multiple Polaris audiences.\n\nThe resulting design system documentation is a reflection of Shopify’s cross-\ndisciplinary process. Design, content, and tech guidelines are all integrated\nin each component’s documentation.\n\n## Integrating Your New Components\n\nAfter designing your initial components, you’ll need to release them into\nexisting products. There are two ways to roll out a design system:\nincrementally or with a large-scale redesign.\n\nAn _incremental rollout_ involves rolling out small pieces of the design\nsystem at a time. If you’ve started your design system by abstracting\nsuccessful patterns from an existing product, then an incremental rollout\nmakes sense. You can take those components and slowly start to integrate them\ninto other products.\n\nThis gives you the opportunity to test your components in a real context and\nnot spend too much time designing in a vacuum—and you’ll see progress more\nimmediately. If you start with common problems, like consolidating icon\nstyles, users will benefit from the consistency more quickly, and you’ll start\nreducing technical and design debt. An incremental approach also gets you into\nthe habit of working in a system.\n\nThe downside to an incremental approach is that your products may exist in a\nlimbo period where they rely on a combination of new and old styles. The\nimpact of this will depend on how much of your design language you’ve changed.\nIf a new button feels completely out of place next to the rest of your UI,\nthen an incremental approach might not make sense.\n\nKeep in mind that some components will be easier to implement than others. A\ngrid, for example, will likely require substantial layout changes because\nyou’re essentially sliding a new foundation under a house. Smaller components,\nlike buttons and icons, require less redesigning, but could be deceptively\ncomplicated because they exist in so many places.\n\nOn the other hand, a _large-scale redesign_ means you’re engaging in a full\ndesign process, changing big things like your design language, layouts, and\ncomponents. The benefit of a large-scale redesign is you won’t feel that\ninconsistency of mixing old and new visual styles. The downside is that it\ntakes more time up front, and you’ll wait longer to see the benefits. Also,\nyou may spend too long debating design decisions in isolation without seeing\nthem in context. If you plan on doing a large-scale redesign, I recommend\ngiving your team a time limit to get the initial release out.\n\nIt’s also likely that a large-scale redesign will require product teams to\nredesign some of their work. What if the new design system doesn’t include a\ncomponent they need? Should they redesign it to fit the new standards? Choose\nan alternative component? Wait and see if this component ends up on your\nroadmap? Be prepared to answer those questions and use them to inform future\nwork on the system. If several teams are asking for a toggle component, that\nwould be a good candidate to include in a future release.\n\nRegardless of your initial scope, your design system will require product\nteams to stop what they’re doing. If you’ve won advocates along the way, by\ninvolving a variety of people in your principles workshop, ecosystem mapping,\nor component design work, it’ll be easier to get buy-in.\n\nSo far, we’ve talked about how to plan a system and how to create your initial\ncomponents. Next, we’ll take a look at defining your brand in a system. Your\nbrand language holds all of these smaller pieces together by presenting a\nunified voice to your users.\n\n\n# Chapter 3. Communicating Your Brand\n\n![](image/3.png)\n\nIn the previous two chapters, I talked about the importance of using a design\nsystem to achieve unity and cohesion. When it comes to expressing brand in a\nsystem, there’s another quality we want to embody: harmony. Harmony is the\nresult of combining all of our design elements to produce pleasing layouts.\n\nThere are a few reasons why I think harmony is important for a design system.\nFirst, we’re breaking down our user interfaces into small, reusable pieces. We\ndon’t always know how these pieces are going to be put together, but we do\nwant the pieces to _fit_. Having consistent building blocks won’t guarantee a\nharmonious layout.\n\nI often see the conversation about components kept separate from the\nconversation about design language—which means we’re spending a lot of time\ndefining the functionality of components and then applying the visual language\non top, like slapping a coat of paint on a table and hoping for the best.\n\nBut a table has more qualities than just its color! The shape of the legs, the\nheight, the style, the material it’s made of—all of these characteristics\ndefine what a table looks like. Similarly, brand expression is more than your\nvisual language—it’s how all of your elements come together to communicate\nyour brand voice. Instead of feeling like a skin on top of a component, your\ndesign language should feel like a complete experience driven from the core of\nyour brand’s identity.\n\nWe won’t be able to predict all of the different combinations of components\nthat will make up our pages. What we _can_ do is think about our brand\nlanguage as it applies to a component hierarchy. When we are thoughtful about\nhow our brand gets expressed at each level of a component hierarchy, we\nachieve harmony.\n\nThere are many design elements that can express brand, but the trifecta of\ntypography, color, and space is the most essential to achieving harmony.\nThat’s because we rely on typography and color to convey information and\nemotion more than on any other design elements. Space doesn’t speak, but it’s\n_felt_ throughout our designs. The difference between a design language that\nfeels complete and one that feels random is usually a judicious use of space.\n\nIn this chapter, we’re going to explore component hierarchies and how branding\ndecisions permeate each level. Then, I’ll give you some strategies for\ncomposing a design language with component hierarchies in mind.\n\n## Component Hierarchy\n\nBreaking your products down into reusable components is a crucial aspect of\ncreating a design system. Those components can either be generic or specific.\nGeneric components are adaptable for different use cases; specific components\nonly work in a few contexts. The more generic a component is, the more\nflexible it will be.\n\nThe word “generic” makes me a little uncomfortable, though. How can our\nproducts feel distinct if they’re made up of generic components? We first have\nto define a _component hierarchy_ to explain how these smaller pieces can be\ncombined to form larger, more expressive components. This hierarchy allows our\nsystems to scale.\n\nDifferent teams define the hierarchy of their components in different ways. As\na general rule, though, these are the different layers:\n\n  * **Basic components:** Small, standalone components like buttons and icons\n  * **Composite components:** A collection of basic components combined to make larger, more specific components\n  * **Containers:** Areas of a page that contain a collection of components\n  * **Layout:** How all of the pieces are laid out on a page\n\nLet’s take a look at how to apply the core building blocks of a visual\nlanguage to the layers of a design system.\n\n### Basic components\n\nThe lowest layer in the hierarchy consists of basic components, sometimes\ncalled _elements_ , _basics_ , or _atoms_. Basic components are the smallest\npossible elements that can’t be broken down any further, like buttons, links,\nor text fields (Fig 3.1).\n\n![](image/3.1_Atlassian_Buttons.png)\n\nFig 3.1: A basic component, like Atlassian’s buttons, can’t be broken down any\nfurther ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-01/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-01/)).\n\nThey are the building blocks of your system, and because you will use them to\ncreate all of your larger components, they need to be modular. Basic\ncomponents also need to be the most flexible; because they’re repeated so\nfrequently in your interfaces, they need to work in a range of contexts.\n\nAt the basic component level, color should be functional. Most basic\ncomponents are repeatable UI elements that direct a user toward their next\ntask, so the purpose of color should be to guide attention.\n\nTypography should also be functional. Buttons, labels, and other basic\ncomponents in the user interface should use highly legible fonts that make it\neasy for people to complete tasks. Typefaces should have high x-heights, open\napertures, and low contrast between strokes, and work well at small sizes.\n\nThe space within and between these basic components can also become a style\nelement. Compare the _Bon Appetit_ button with the _Guardian_ button (Fig\n3.2). The text on _Bon Appetit_ ’s button is reversed out of a dark\nbackground, set in all-caps, and tracked out slightly; there’s generous space\naround the text, giving the button a relaxed and elegant feel. By contrast,\nthe _Guardian_ ’s button uses a slightly heavier font weight and tighter\ntracking; both the arrow and the color yellow feel urgent.\n\nBasic components, like buttons, form fields, and dropdowns, are common\ningredients of digital products, but there are ways to make them feel\nexpressive. Take a look at Atlassian’s toggle component (Fig 3.3). It’s small\nbut highly opinionated, using both color and an icon to communicate a state\nchange (which also makes it more accessible). The documentation for the toggle\nalso sets clear, specific guidelines about when it’s appropriate to use the\ntoggle and when it’s better to use a checkbox:\n\n> Toggles should never require users to press a button to apply the settings.\n> When you require users to press a submit button with a toggle, you may\n> confuse them because it’s not the expected next step. In those cases, use\n> checkboxes instead\n> ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-02/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-02/)).\n\nBroadly used design frameworks, like Bootstrap, don’t (and shouldn’t) include\nthis level of specificity around how to use components—they leave those\ndecisions up to product teams. The rationale you provide for how basic\ncomponents should be used will set your products apart. Ideally, this\nrationale will explain how each component can serve the design principles you\nestablished at the outset.\n\n![Comparison between a black button with all-caps text on Bon Appetit’s\nwebsite and a bright yellow button with an arrow on the Guardian’s\nwebsite.](image/3.2.png)\n\nFig 3.2: Basic components need to be functional, but they should still\nrepresent your brand through typography, color, and use of space.\n\n![Atlassian’s basic toggle component, showing a regular gray toggle with an X\nand a large green toggle with a checkmark.](image/3.3_Atlassian_Toggle.png)\n\nFig 3.3: Atlassian’s toggle component is opinionated in both its design and\nusage guidelines.\n\n### Composite components\n\nThe second layer is more complex. Composite components, often called\n_components_ , _modules_ , or _molecules,_ are collections of basic components\nthat have been arranged in specific and opinionated ways (Fig 3.4). These\ncomponents can also be reusable, but they often serve a more specific purpose,\nwhich makes them less flexible. While the main measure of success for a basic\ncomponent is reusability, composite components are measured by how well they\nsolve their chosen problem.\n\n![A list of checkbox options for channel availability, an example of a\ncomposite component.](image/3.4_Shopify_Option_List.png)\n\nFig 3.4: Shopify’s option list component is an example of a composite\ncomponent because it’s created by combining the card, title, and checkbox\ncomponents.\n\nComposite components give you an opportunity to use color and typography\nexpressively. More complex components, like Mailchimp’s story cards, call for\nlarger, more expressive type (Fig 3.5). For components like these, you can\nchoose typefaces that have more character and higher contrast, unlike the more\nneutral UI fonts that work better for basic components.\n\n![A story card from Mailchimp, with a yellow background, large serif text that\nsays “It’s easy to get started,” and a teal signup\nbutton.](image/3.5_Mailchimp_Type.png)\n\nFig 3.5: Compare the difference between a font that works well for a basic\ncomponent and one used in a composite component. The font used for the button\nis a neutral, humanist sans serif that works well at small sizes. The headline\nfont, on the other hand, is a display serif that’s packed with personality,\nbefitting the brand’s mission: “Mailchimp celebrates the joy, intensity, and\nweirdness of growing a brand.”\n\nAlong with typography, color in composite components can also be more\nexpressive—bolder, brighter, and more striking, like the yellow background in\nMailChimp’s story cards (Fig 3.5).\n\nCompare two story cards from the _Guardian_ and _Bon Appetit_ (Fig 3.6).\nFunctionally, they’re very similar. They both contain an image and a headline,\nand serve the purpose of providing a preview to an article. Their designs,\nhowever, communicate very different tones: the _Guardian_ ’s card feels more\nserious, while _Bon Appetit_ ’s feels more relaxed. Let’s unpack the design\nchoices that make us feel that way.\n\n![A formal, journalistic story card from the Guardian compared to a casual,\ncolorful story card from Bon Appetit.](image/3.6.png)\n\nFig 3.6: Functionally, these story cards from the _Guardian_ and _Bon Appetit_\nare similar, but they each express different tones.\n\nWhat’s most interesting about these story card examples is their use of space.\n_Bon Appetit_ ’s typography makes generous use of space within and around the\ntext, which lets the design breathe—I feel like I can lean back and take my\ntime browsing this site. The _Guardian_ , on the other hand, uses very tight\nspacing. The text is tightly leaded; the space between text and container is\nalmost nonexistent. This compression, common in newspapers and news sites,\ncreates a tension that communicates urgency.\n\nAt the composite component level, you start to feel the design language more\nbecause you’re looking at a collection of components together. In these\nexamples, the photography style, the headline font, and the space around the\ntype all work together to express their respective brands.\n\nKeep in mind that the choices you make at this level should build on the\nchoices you made at the basic level. If you designed your buttons with\ngenerous spacing, then your larger components should also have airy spacing.\n\n### Containers\n\nContainers (or _regions_) are larger areas of a page that contain composite\ncomponents. They are typically full-width horizontal elements; pages are then\ncomposed by stacking containers on top of each other. Containers are useful\nwhen you want to group content in a specific way, but need to provide\nflexibility in how those content chunks are arranged.\n\nOnce we get to the container level, we can start to see how pieces are working\ntogether. The primary design elements for containers are color and space.\nColor can be used as a background behind a container to signal a shift in\ncontent or tone. Space can be used to control density (Fig 3.7). At this\nlevel, we’re looking at the horizontal space between elements as well as the\nvertical space around the container.\n\nIt’s really important to consider density holistically—again, we’re building\nup our decisions at each level. If you have roomier buttons and components,\nthen leaving more space between your containers will make your designs feel\nmore cohesive.\n\n### Layouts\n\n![An airy collection of story cards on Bon Appetit compared to a dense\ncollection on the Guardian.](image/3.7b_Guardian_Containers.png)\n\nFig 3.7: Once you get to the container level, you can start to design your\noverall density. _Bon Appetit_ (left) uses vertical space much differently\nthan the _Guardian_ (left).\n\nLayouts (also known as _templates_) determine how these components can be\narranged on a screen. They are defined by how the information on a screen will\nbe used and how content will be organized.\n\nWhen you design a layout, you’re thinking about the relationship between all\nof the elements on the page. Whereas at the container level we were thinking\nabout the vertical space between components, at the layout level we’re\nthinking about the horizontal space between elements. At this level, you’ll\nmake decisions about how large the various components should be in relation to\none another.\n\nThe _Guardian_ ’s container model provides a good example of how to compose a\npage from smaller elements (Fig 3.8). Their smallest building blocks are\ncalled _items_ ; each item represents an individual story. These items can be\ngrouped horizontally into slices. Then, slices are gathered into containers\nthat can be arranged in different ways. Finally, the _Guardian_ ’s pages—Home,\nNews, Sports, and so on—are made up of containers.\n\n![Wireframe representations of the Guardian’s container model, showing how\nsmall components get connected to form larger and more complex\nlayouts.](image/3.9_Guardian_container_model.png)\n\nFig 3.8: At the _Guardian_ , items (left) are grouped into slices (middle),\nwhich are stacked into containers (right) to compose a page\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-03/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-03/)).\n\nBy defining its design system with this hierarchy, the _Guardian_ gives itself\nopportunities for flexibility at every level (Fig 3.9). At the component\nlevel, story cards can be displayed in a variety of sizes to communicate\nhierarchy. Containers can expand or contract based on the number of stories\nadded to them, which communicates importance at any given time. And because\nthe site’s pages are made up of these containers, stories can be grouped and\nhighlighted in a variety of ways. Think about the type of flexibility you want\nyour system to have and create a component hierarchy that helps you meet that\ngoal.\n\n![A stylized portion of a page layout on the Guardian, showing how items,\nslices, and containers work\ntogether.](image/3.8_Guardian_Container_Model_.png)\n\nFig 3.9: The _Guardian_ ’s container model allows them to curate pages in\nflexible ways.\n\nThe decisions the _Guardian_ made about its design language are applied\nconsistently at each level of the hierarchy. Spacing is compact within\nindividual cards, between cards, and between containers. Color is used as a\nwayfinding tool. Lines are used within cards, between cards, and between\ncontainers. When you look at your design language at the layout level, you\nwant to ensure that all of your branding attributes work well together.\n\nNow that we’re up to speed with the building blocks of component hierarchies,\nlet’s talk about how to design at every level in order to achieve a harmonious\nbrand.\n\n## Big Levers and Small Dials\n\nAs we saw when we broke down our component hierarchy, we not only need to\nthink about design elements at each level, but also how they ascend the\nhierarchy. To do this, we need to explore our design language both globally\nand granularly.\n\nJust as there’s a hierarchy to components, there’s also a hierarchy to the\nkinds of design decisions you make. I think about it in terms of big levers\nand small dials. _Levers_ are broad, sweeping decisions about how our\nexperiences should feel. _Dials_ are small, detailed choices that enable those\nfeelings.\n\nImagine you have a design in front of you. If you were to make the entire\ndesign feel heavier and more dense, what would you change? You would probably\nreduce the amount of space between elements. You might swap out fonts to a\nbolder weight or add some dark background colors. Now, what if you wanted to\nmake the design light and airy? You would remove the dark background colors,\nlighten the font weights, and increase the amount of space between everything.\n\nYou’re not actually pulling any levers or turning any dials, but I like to use\nthis metaphor because it gets me in the mindset that all of the elements need\nto change _together_ to change the overall feeling of a page. Harmony means\nthat everything is working together.\n\nThere are four big levers that determine what a design will feel like: size,\nscale, density, and weight. If you squint, how should your pages _feel_?\nCompact or loose? Dynamic or evenly paced? Light or heavy?\n\nDefining the levers helps you make better choices about your dials. The dials\ndefine granular elements: typography, spacing, and color values. If your\ndesign process is anything like mine, then you know the feeling of\nmeticulously increasing and decreasing a font size by one pixel before finally\nlanding on a size that feels right—it’s like turning a dial ever so slightly.\n\nIf you define your dials but not your levers, you risk ending up with design\nchoices that feel arbitrary. You may have really tight spacing in one section\nand loose spacing in another. Or an area where color is used very heavily next\nto an area where it’s used lightly. There are a few downsides to this:\n\n  * Your pages will lack harmony and your layouts will feel unclear. \n  * You’ll miss opportunities to be expressive, because levers have a larger global impact than dials. \n  * Your teammates won’t understand how to apply the design language. As we’ll see in Chapter 5 (when we talk about how to document a design language), it’s important to specify not only the granular design choices, but also the overall characteristics. \n\nEven though we won’t know all the ways components will be used to build pages,\nwe can have harmonious layouts if our levers and dials are in tune. Let’s take\na look at how to set them.\n\n### Making global design decisions\n\nBy manipulating the four levers—size, scale, density, and weight—we can have\nenormous, sweeping impact on the look and feel of our layouts (Fig 3.10):\n\n  * **Size:** What size are the elements on the page? Should they be large or small? This choice ties back to the purpose of your product and what your audience expects to be able to do. Do you want someone to take their time consuming all of your content, focusing on one thing at a time? Choose larger elements that take up more room. Or, do you want someone to quickly see every action they can take at a glance? Choose smaller elements. Size primarily impacts the speed at which your content is consumed.\n  * **Scale:** What size are elements relative to one another? Should there be a more dramatic size contrast between elements, or should everything feel similarly sized? Again, this ties back to purpose, audience expectation, and design principles. Scale is used to focus attention. If you want to guide your audience through a process, you need more pronounced size contrast that points to one primary action. This makes your audience feel more supported in their journey. If you want your audience to choose their own path, then use less contrast to highlight that there are multiple paths to choose from. Your audience will feel more empowered to make a decision. Scale primarily involves how you use size to focus attention. \n  * **Density and weight:** How dense is the page? Should it feel airy or compact? Density and weight are related, but not identical: _density_ refers to how tightly packed your elements are, while _weight_ refers to the overall heaviness of a page. While density is primarily communicated through space, weight is communicated through typography and color. A page with lots of space between elements will feel airier than a page with tightly packed elements. A page with dark headers and bold, compact fonts will feel heavier than a page with delicate fonts and light colors. \n\nAll of these levers relate to one another. For example, smaller elements that\nare more densely packed feel more efficient, which is helpful if you want\nusers to complete a task quickly. Larger elements with airier spacing feel\nmore engaging; these design elements make a user spend more time consuming the\ncontent. Combined, our levers describe how we can express a brand.\n\n![Four spectrums for Size \\(from small to large\\), Scale \\(small contrast to\nlarge contrast\\), Density \\(compact to airy\\), and Weight \\(heavy to\nlight\\).](image/3.10_Levers_Diagram_-_redo.png)\n\nFig 3.10: Size, scale, density, and weight are the four levers you can pull to\ndefine your design language.\n\nHere’s how I pulled these levers when I was working on designs for Vox.com and\nthe _Verge_ (Fig 3.11). My team was starting from design languages that had\nbeen developed for social and print. Our task was to take those brand\nguidelines and reflect them digitally, as a design system.\n\nOur challenge at Vox Media was representing different brands within one\nportfolio using the same building blocks. Each of the verticals had a very\ndifferent brand ethos, so we started there. The following points have been\nadapted from Vox.com’s brand statement:\n\n  * Vox explains the news and the world around you. \n  * Audiences expect trustworthy and contextual information. Vox conveys this with its brand ethos: “Smart. Audience-first. Generous. Explanatory.” \n  * The content is primarily text-based, with just a little custom photography and illustration. \n  * The yellow highlight is a strong visual signifier. \n\n![Comparison between Vox.com’s straightforward, journalistic brand ethos and\nthe Verge’s colorful, entertaining brand ethos.](image/3.11.png)\n\nFig 3.11: For Vox.com and the _Verge_ , we pulled different levers to\ncommunicate each publication’s distinct brand voice. Vox has more density than\nthe _Verge_ , while the _Verge_ uses more pronounced size contrast.\n\nAnd these have been adapted from the _Verge_ ’s brand statement:\n\n  * The _Verge_ is an ambitious multimedia effort to examine how technology will change life in the future for a massive mainstream audience. \n  * Audiences expect in-depth reporting and long-form feature stories, delivered in a cutting-edge way. The _Verge_ does this with its brand ethos: “Illuminating. Beautiful. Rebellious. Entertaining.” \n  * The _Verge_ is known as much for its custom photography as for its written content. \n  * The gradients are a strong visual signifier. \n\nVox.com’s “explanatory” versus the _Verge_ ’s “entertaining” sends a useful\nsignal about scale and density. You can deduce that an audience looking for\nexplanation expects information to be more compact than an audience looking to\nbe entertained.\n\nIn addition to the publications’ brand statements, we considered their\ncontent. The _Verge_ is known for its custom product photography and wanted to\nhighlight it. Vox, on the other hand, often uses photos from sources like\nGetty Images, so it didn’t want to focus as much attention on photography. We\nnoted, too, that Vox headlines tend to be longer than the _Verge_ ’s.\n\nWe also looked at the design elements that had already been defined. Balto,\nVox’s headline typeface, is sturdy and works well at a range of sizes. Heroic,\nthe _Verge_ ’s headline typeface, is tall, narrow, and needs to be set large\nto be legible.\n\nWe determined that, for the _Verge_ , we would need to make the components\nlarger to set Heroic well and highlight the photography. In light of the\n_Verge_ ’s brand ethos of “Rebellious,” we wanted the layout to feel dynamic,\nso we used a more pronounced size contrast between elements. We selected\ngradients and a dark color palette to evoke the “Illuminating” ethos. We knew\nthese choices would resonate with the _Verge_ ’s audience because it expects\nthe _Verge_ to be entertaining.\n\nFor Vox, we wanted to highlight the breadth of its coverage without\noverwhelming the audience. The components are medium-sized: not big, but not\nas small as those in a complex web app. While hierarchy is still important to\ndraw your eye to the top story, the size contrast isn’t as dramatic as on the\n_Verge_.\n\nAt this point, we’re describing what our experiences should feel like and how\nour broad design choices will communicate those feelings. But we haven’t yet\ndefined specifics, like the exact pixel size of our typography. By taking the\ntime to define our levers first, we’ll be able to make better decisions about\nour dials later.\n\nWhile this process describes how to use levers to make choices for a new\ndesign language, you might not always have the ability to start from scratch.\nYou can still use the levers to analyze how well your design language is\nworking to convey your brand. What levers are you pulling across your products\nor websites? Are they the right ones? Are they all working harmoniously?\nAsking these questions could reveal parts of your design language that could\nbe improved.\n\n### Making granular design decisions\n\nAfter deciding on your global settings, you can translate those decisions to\nthe smaller dials at the composite and basic component levels.\n\nNow, there are a lot of decisions to make when you’re defining a design\nlanguage, like choosing a font family and creating a color palette. I’m not\ngoing to focus on those choices because they’re inherent to design work, not\nspecific to creating a design system. Instead, let’s focus on how to define\ntype, spacing, and color to reflect the choices you made with size, scale,\ndensity, and weight.\n\n#### Type system\n\nType makes up the majority of our user interfaces, making it the most\npervasive and evocative design element. That means that all of the levers will\nhave an impact on your typography. Again, we’re going to assume that you or\nsomeone else has already chosen your brand fonts and that those brand fonts\nare successfully communicating your brand ethos. Now we have to turn those\nfonts into a type system.\n\nWhen you’re defining your type system, there are three primary decisions you\nneed to make: defining your base font size, defining your type hierarchy, and\ndefining your global line height.\n\n  * **Set a base font size.** First, you need to set a base font size. The base font size is the size of your body copy and is the number that the rest of your type system will be built from. Choose a size that makes for a comfortable reading experience. Take your “size” lever into account here. If your elements are generally large, consider using a higher base font size, like `18px`. If your elements are generally smaller, go with a smaller size (though I wouldn’t go any lower than `14px`). \n  * **Set a scale.** Next, create a type scale. Modular type scales size scales for typography based on musical interval ratios. Type scales are helpful for making your type system feel harmonious and proportional. To make a type scale, you take your base font size and multiply that number by a numeric ratio, such as 1.5. You don’t need to do this math on your own. The site [modularscale.com](http://www.modularscale.com) is a calculator that allows you to set your base font size and then outputs a variety of type scales based on the ratio you’ve chosen (Fig 3.12). Here’s where our levers come into play. If you’ve decided your design language needs more size contrast between elements, use a type scale with a high ratio between headings. If your design language has less contrast, choose a lower ratio. \n\n![Comparison between high contrast and low contrast type scales on\nmodularscale.com.](image/3.14_Modular_Scale.png)\n\nFig 3.12: Two examples of a type scale using modularscale.com. The scale on\nthe left has much higher contrast between the type headings; the scale on the\nright has lower contrast.\n\n  * **Set your line height.** Line height is the distance between lines of text. A smaller line height will make text appear denser; a higher line height will make it seem airier.\n\nYou can achieve typographic density and weight a couple of different ways.\nFirst, you have to consider the weight of the fonts themselves. That one is\nself-explanatory. A heavier font will feel heavier. A lighter font, lighter.\nThen, you have to consider the space around it. Adding lots of space around a\nlight font will make your layouts feel much airier. Tight spacing makes\nlayouts feel denser and more urgent.\n\n#### Spacing system\n\nYour spacing system defines the space within and around your components.\nHaving a spacing system gives your products a consistent rhythm and visual\nbalance. It also helps everyone using the design system apply space in a\nconsistent way. The density lever will have the biggest impact on your spacing\nsystem.\n\nThere are two big decisions you need to make when you’re designing a spacing\nsystem:\n\n  * **Setting a base number.** First, you need to set a base number that the rest of your scale will be built from. Many teams build their spacing on a unit of `4px` because it’s easily divisible. Even if you choose `4px` as your base number, it doesn’t have to be the first number in your scale. You could choose `2px` as your first number if you need really tight spacing or with `8px` if you want looser spacing.\n  * **Setting the scale**. The next step is to decide how the spacing system will scale from your base number. Your main options are to choose between a linear scale and a nonlinear scale. With a linear scale, every step is a fixed increment: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, etc. With a nonlinear scale, the system relies on a ratio as it increases, just like the modular scale we used for type. A nonlinear scale based on a unit of 4 could look like this: 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, etc. \n\nYour density lever will help you figure out what base number to start with, as\nwell as how dramatic your size progression should be (Fig 3.13). If you want\nyour layout to feel compact, start from a smaller base size and only increase\nyour space by small increments. If you want your layout to feel airy, start\nwith a larger base size and increase your space by larger increments. As with\nour type scale, you get those larger increments by multiplying your base font\nsize by a larger ratio number.\n\n![Comparison between low contrast and high contrast space scales, showing how\nthe size of and distance between graphic squares changes with\nscale.](image/3.15_Space_Scales.png)\n\nFig 3.13: Two examples of a spacing scale based on a unit of `4px`. The scale\non the left has less contrast between each size, which will result in a layout\nthat feels more compact. The scale on the right has more dramatic contrast\nbetween each size, which will produce airier layouts.\n\nAfter defining your space system, you need to help people understand how to\nuse it.\n\n  * **Name your space intervals.** Giving your space intervals clear names will make it easier for people to use the scale. Space is perhaps the element that designers and developers go back and forth on the most. Have you ever gone through a process where a designer annotates a static design mock and hands it over to a developer, who then codes up the page and hands it back—except the space in the built page doesn’t match the space in the annotated design mock? The good news about having a spacing system is that it gives both disciplines a common language to work from. You could give the space descriptive names, like _compact_ , _cozy_ , and _airy_ , but you would run out of names quickly. _Extra cozy_? _Super airy_? Or you could assign T-shirt size names, like _extra small_ , _small_ , _medium_ , _large_ , and _extra-large_. That works if you have just a handful of space intervals. The other option is to name space numerically, like _Space 0_ = `0px`, _Space 1_ = `4px`, _Space 2_ = `8px`, _Space 9_ = `60px`, and so on. This may not be the most creative option, but it’s the most straightforward. The benefit is that it scales better. If you decide you need to add a larger space interval, you can simply add a _Space 10_ , instead of adding another _extra_ to that _ext_ _ra-large_. \n  * **Define space within and between components.** The other way to help other designers and developers use your space scale is by explaining how to apply it to the space within and around components. Your guidance can range from broad to more specific. For instance, you can say: “Use less space within components and more space between containers.” Or you might go further and say: “Always use _Space 2_ between elements in a form” and “Use _Space 1_ between an icon and the text in a button.” \n\n#### Color system\n\nThe last design element in the trifecta is color. I recommend reading Josef\nAlbers’ _The Interaction of Color_ to understand how colors influence one\nanother. In it, Albers explains that “colors present themselves in continuous\nflux, constantly related to changing neighbors and changing conditions.” When\nyou create a color system, you need not only to consider individual colors,\nbut also how they interact. The proximity of colors to one another, when they\noverlap, and how prominently color appears on a page—all of these factors\ninfluence how people use color.\n\nWhen determining color values, we look at three things:\n\n  * _Hue_ refers to where the color lives on a color wheel (green, red, blue). \n  * _Saturation_ refers to the amount of gray mixed into the color. \n  * _Luminance_ refers to how much white or black have been mixed into the color. \n\nUsually, you begin to see fragmentation in color systems through variations in\nsaturation and luminance. Teams start from a primary hue, but then realize it\nfeels too bright for the design they’re creating, or the color isn’t luminous\nenough on a dark background, so they create variations (Fig 3.14).\n\n![A collection of fifteen pink circles, varying in name, saturation, and\nluminosity.](image/3.16_Lyft_color.png)\n\nFig 3.14: The Lyft team found fifteen variations of pink across its products.\nThere’s a little variation in hue, with some colors leaning further toward\nviolet in the color wheel than others. Mainly, though, we see variation in\nsaturation and luminosity. “Pink 2” is a more luminous version of “UI Pink.”\n“Pink 500” is a less saturated version of “Pink 700.”\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-04/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-04/))\n\nTo prevent this fragmentation, study color across a component hierarchy—look\nat color values by themselves, in components, on a page, and in interactions.\nCreating a color system is an incremental process; one change can alter the\nway you perceive another color.\n\nAs you define your color system, consider the following questions:\n\n  * **How should color direct attention?** Color directs attention in a few ways. It signals actions users can take on the page (button and link colors). It conveys the urgency of notifications (success, warning, and error colors). And it communicates interactive states (focus states, in-line validation). How many colors do you want to use to signify action? Deciding on which color you want to use for your primary and secondary actions is a good starting point for figuring out the rest of your color system. Let’s say you’ve chosen a bright green for your primary-action color. Now let’s think about how that color will be perceived in context. \n  * **How should your foreground and background colors interact?** The bulk of our user interfaces are neutral colors. Our neutral tones can have a major influence on how our action colors are perceived (Fig 3.15). I recommend experimenting with your neutral tones to understand how shifting the hue of your grays will impact the rest of your page. Does a cool-gray palette make your page feel cold and stark or fresh and modern? Does a warm-gray palette feel friendly or dull? That will depend greatly on how your foreground and background colors interact. A cool-gray palette can feel lively if paired with vibrant, warm foreground colors but clinical if paired with foreground colors that lack saturation or luminosity (Fig 3.16).\n\n![Three columns of neutral color gradations, moving vertically from light to\ndark and horizontally from warm to cool.](image/3.17_Neutral_Grays.png)\n\nFig 3.15: Neutrals aren’t neutral. Nudging your grays toward warmer or cooler\ntones can help express your brand voice. True medium grays can feel\nunexpressive if they’re used too heavily.\n\n![Comparison showing how the same shade of green appears to change based on\nthe shade of gray behind it. ](image/3.18_Color_Theory.png)\n\nFig 3.16: The green box on a cool gray background (left) appears more\nluminous; the same green on a warm gray background (right) feels more muted.\n\n  * **How prominently should color be used?** Then, consider how prominently color should be used. You may find that a style that works well in isolation doesn’t work when it’s in context. For example, a colored icon may look great on its own, but when you start to stack the icons in a list, the color becomes too overpowering (Fig. 3.17).\n\nThe best way to create a color system that can scale is to consider color at\nevery level of a component hierarchy. Look at pages with lots of actions and\npages with only one action. Look at how dark and light background colors shift\nthe way your primary colors look. Adjust the hue, saturation, and luminosity\nof your palette until you have a color system that feels harmonious.\n\n## Achieving Harmony\n\n“Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context—a chair in\na room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city\nplan,” said Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-05/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/03-05/)). Remember that\ncomponents aren’t used in isolation, but around and within each other.\n\n![A single green icon and menu label, compared to a list of green icons and\nmenu labels.](image/3.19_Color_in_Context.png)\n\nFig 3.17: Think about how a color will look in context. This green icon might\nlook great in isolation, but once it’s on a page as a list, the green color\ncommands much more attention.\n\nLike all aspects of a design system, achieving harmony isn’t a linear process.\nUse the levers to guide you. You may roll out a new header style that makes\nyour pages feel too heavy. What can you adjust to reduce that heaviness—either\nadjust the header style or something around it? By considering your brand\nlanguage in layers—the same way we think about components in layers—you can\nensure that every aspect of your design feels branded. As a result, all\nelements will come together with a harmonious brand voice.\n\nSometimes our brand voice needs to have separate tones. Or we may be designing\nsystems for entirely different brand voices. In the next chapter, we’ll talk\nabout how to build variations into your design system.\n\n\n# Chapter 4. Making Room for Variation\n\n![](image/4.png)\n\nMaking a brand feel unified, cohesive, and harmonious while also leaving room\nfor experimentation is a tough balancing act. It’s one of the most challenging\naspects of a design system.\n\nGraphic designer and Pentagram partner Paula Scher faced this challenge with\nthe visual identity for the Public Theater in New York. As she explained in a\ntalk at Beyond Tellerrand:\n\n> I began to realize that if you made everything the same, it was boring after\n> the first year. If you changed it individually for each play, the theater\n> lost recognizability. The thing to do, which I totally got for the first\n> time after working there at this point for 17 years, is what they needed to\n> have were seasons.\n\n> You could take the typography and the color system for the summer festival,\n> the Shakespeare in the Park Festival, and you could begin to translate it\n> into posters by flopping the colors, but using some of the same motifs, and\n> you could create entire seasons out of the graphics. That would become its\n> own standards manual where I have about six different people making these\n> all year ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-01/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-01/)).\n\nScher’s strategy was to retain the Public Theater’s visual language every\nyear, but to vary some of its elements (Fig 4.1–2). Colors would be swapped.\nText would skew in different directions. New visual motifs would be\nintroduced. The result is that each season coheres in its own way, but so does\nthe identity of the Public Theater as a whole.\n\n![Sixteen Public Theater posters in black, white, and yellow, with slanted\nwood type letterforms and high-contrast images of\npeople.](image/4.1_Public_Theater_2014.png)\n\nFig 4.1: The posters for the 2014/15 season featured the wood type style the\nPublic Theater is known for, but the typography was skewed. The color palette\nwas restrained to yellow, black, and white, which led to a dynamic look when\ncoupled with the skewed type\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-02/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-02/)).\n\n![Twelve Public Theater posters using black, white, and pastel colors with\nwood type letterforms and softer images of\npeople.](image/4.2_Public_Theater_2018.png)\n\nFig 4.2: For the 2018 season, the wood type letterforms were extended on a\nfield of gradated color. The grayscale cut-out photos we saw in the 2014/15\nseason persisted, but this time in lower contrast to fit better with the\nsofter color tones\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-03/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-03/)).\n\nEven the most robust or thoroughly planned systems will need to account for\nvariation at some point. As soon as you release a design system, people will\nask you how to deviate from it, and you’ll want to be armed with persuasive\nanswers. In this chapter, I’m going to talk about what variation means for a\ndesign system, how to know when you need it, and how to manage it in a\nscalable way.\n\n## What Is Variation?\n\nWe’ve spent most of this book talking about the importance of unity, cohesion,\nand harmony in a design system. So why are we talking about variation? Isn’t\nthat at odds with all of the goals we’ve set until now?\n\nVariation is a deviation from established patterns, and it can exist at every\nlevel of the system. At the component level, for instance, a team may discover\nthat they need a component to behave in a slightly different way; maybe this\nparticular component needs to appear without a photo, for example. At a\ndesign-language level, you may have a team that has a different audience, so\nthey want to adjust their brand identity to serve that audience better. You\ncan even have variation at the level of design principles: if a team is\nworking on a product that is functionally different from your core product,\nthey may need to adjust their principles to suit that context.\n\nThere are three kinds of deviations that come up in a design system:\n\n  * **Unintentional divergence** typically happens when designers can’t find the information they’re looking for. They may not know that a certain solution exists within a system, so they create their own style. Clear, easy-to-find documentation and usage guidelines can help your team avoid unintentional variation.\n  * **Intentional but unnecessary divergence** usually results from designers not wanting to feel constrained by the system, or believing they have a better solution. Making sure your team knows how to push back on and contribute to the system can help mitigate this kind of variation. \n  * **Intentional, meaningful divergence** is the goal of an expressive design system. In this case, the divergence is meaningful because it solves a very specific user problem that no existing pattern solves. \n\nWe want to enable intentional, meaningful variation. To do this, we need to\nunderstand the needs and contexts for variation.\n\n## Contexts for Variation\n\nEvery variation we add makes our design system more complicated. Therefore, we\nneed to take care to find the right moments for variation. Three big\ncontextual changes are served by variation: brand, audience, and environment.\n\n### Brand\n\nIf you’re creating a system for multiple brands, each with its own brand\nlanguage, then your system needs to support variations to reflect those\nbrands.\n\nThe key here is to find the common core elements and then set some criteria\nfor how you should deviate. When we were creating the design system for our\nwebsites at Vox Media, we constantly debated which elements should feel more\nexpressive. Should a footer be standardized, or should we allow for tons of\ncustomization? We went back to our core goals: our users were ultimately\nvisiting our websites to consume editorial content. So the variations should\nbe in service of the content, writing style, and tone of voice for each brand.\n\nThe newsletter modules across Vox Media brands were an example of unnecessary\nvariation. They were consistent in functionality and layout, but had\nvariations in type, color, and visual treatments like borders (Fig 4.3). There\nwas quite a bit of custom design within a very small area: Curbed’s newsletter\ncomponent had a skewed background, for example, while Eater’s had a background\nimage. Because these modules were so consistent in their user goals, we\ndecided to unify their design and create less variation (Fig 4.4).\n\n![Three examples of newsletter modules, showing different colors, fonts, and\nspacing.](image/4.3.png)\n\nFig 4.3: Older versions of Vox Media’s newsletter modules contained lots of\nunnecessary visual variation.\n\n![Three examples of newsletter modules, showing the same colors, fonts, and\nspacing. ](image/4.4_Curbed_New_Newsletter.png)\n\nFig 4.4: The new, unified newsletter modules.\n\nThe unified design cleaned up some technical debt. In the previous design,\neach newsletter module had CSS overrides to achieve distinct styling. Some\nmodules even had overrides on the primary button color so it would work better\nwith the background color. Little CSS overrides like this add up over time.\nWhenever we released a new change, we’d have to manually update the spots\ncontaining CSS overrides.\n\nThe streamlined design also placed a more appropriate emphasis on the\nnewsletter module. While important, this module isn’t the star of the page. It\ndoesn’t need loud backgrounds or fancy shapes to command attention, especially\nsince it’s placed around article content. Variation in this module wasn’t\nnecessary for expressing the brands.\n\nOn the other hand, consider the variation in Vox Media’s global header\ncomponents. When we were redesigning the _Verge_ , its editorial teams were\nvocal about wanting more latitude to art-direct the page, guide attention\ntoward big features, and showcase custom illustrations. We addressed this by\ncreating a masthead component (Fig 4.5) that sits on top of the global header\non homepages. It contains a logo, tagline, date, and customizable background\nimage. Though at the time this was a one-off component, we felt that the\nvariation was valuable because it would strengthen the _Verge_ ’s brand voice.\n\n![Three examples of the Verge’s masthead component: one with magenta and blue\nabstractions, one with a city skyline in orange tones, and one in pixelated\nblack and white.](image/4.5.png)\n\nFig 4.5: Examples of the _Verge_ ’s masthead component.\n\nThe _Verge_ team commissions or makes original art that changes throughout the\nday. The most exciting part is that they can use the masthead and a one-up\nhero when they drop a big feature and use these flexible components to art-\ndirect the page (Fig 4.6). Soon after launch, the _Verge_ masthead even got a\nTwitter fan account (@VergeTaglines) that tweets every time the image changes.\n\n![Comparison of the Verge’s homepage, changing based on the masthead design\nand hero photography.](image/4.6.png)\n\nFig 4.6: The _Verge_ uses two generic components, the masthead and one-up\nhero, to art-direct its homepages.\n\nThough this component was built specifically for the _Verge_ , it soon gained\nbroader application with other brands that share Vox’s publishing platform,\nChorus. The McElroy Family website, for example, needed to convey its sense of\nhumor and Appalachian roots; the masthead component shines with an original\nillustration featuring an adorable squirrel (Fig 4.7).\n\nThe _Chicago Sun-Times_ —another Chorus platform site—is very different in\ncontent, tone, and audience from The McElroy Family, but the masthead\ncomponent is just as valuable in conveying the tone of the organization’s\nhigh-quality investigative journalism and breaking news coverage (Fig 4.8).\n\nWhy did the masthead variation work well while the newsletter variation\ndidn’t? The variations on the newsletter design were purely visual. When we\ncreated them, we didn’t have a strategy for how variation should work;\ninstead, we were looking for any opportunity to make the brands feel distinct.\nThe masthead variation, by contrast, tied directly into the brand strategy.\nEven though it began as a one-off for the _Verge_ , it was flexible and\npurposeful enough to migrate to other brands.\n\n![The masthead component for the McElroy Family, showing a blue navigation bar\nand a pastel illustration of a forest.](image/4.7_McElroy_Masthead.png)\n\nFig 4.7: The McElroy Family site uses the same masthead component as the\n_Verge_ to display a custom illustration.\n\n![The masthead component for the Chicago Sun-Times, showing a white\nbackground, stark black text, and a red Subscribe\nbutton.](image/4.8_Chicago_Sun-Times_Masthead.png)\n\nFig 4.8: The same masthead component on the _Chicago Sun-Times_ site.\n\n### Audience\n\nThe next contextual variation comes from audience. If your products serve\ndifferent audiences who all need different things, then your system may need\nto adapt to fit those needs.\n\nA good example of this is Airbnb’s listing pages. In addition to their\nstandard listings, they also have Airbnb Plus—one-of-a-kind, high quality\nrentals at higher price points. Audiences booking a Plus listing are probably\nlooking for exceptional quality and attention to detail.\n\nBoth Airbnb’s standard listing page and Plus listing page are immediately\nrecognizable as belonging to the same family because they use many consistent\nelements (Fig 4.9). They both use Airbnb’s custom font, Cereal. They both\nhighlight photography. They both use many of the same components, like the\ndate picker. The iconography is the same.\n\n![Comparison of Airbnb’s standard and Plus listings, using the same brand\nelements but resulting in different tones.](image/4.9.png)\n\nFig 4.9: The same brand elements in Airbnb’s standard listings (above) are\nused in their Plus listings (below), but with variations that make the listing\nstyles distinct.\n\nHowever, some of the design choices convey a different attitude. Airbnb Plus\nuses larger typography, airier vertical space, and a lighter weight of Cereal.\nIt has a more understated color palette, with a deeper color on the call to\naction. These choices make Airbnb Plus feel like a more premium experience.\nYou can see they’ve adjusted the density, weight, and scale levers to achieve\na more elegant and sophisticated aesthetic.\n\nThe standard listing page, on the other hand, is more functional, with the\nbooking module front and center. The Plus design pulls the density and weight\nlevers in a lighter, airier direction. The standard listing page has less size\ncontrast between elements, making it feel more functional.\n\nBecause they use the same core building blocks—the same typography,\niconography, and components—both experiences feel like Airbnb. However, the\nvariations in spacing, typographic weights, and color help distinguish the\nstandard listing from the premium listing.\n\n### Environment\n\nI’ve mainly been talking about adding variation to a system to allow for a\nrange of content tones, but you may also need your system to scale based on\nenvironmental contexts. “Environment” in this context asks: Where will your\nproducts be used? Will that have an impact on the experience? Environments are\nthe various constraints and pressures that surround and inform an experience.\nThat can include lighting, ambient noise, passive or active engagement,\nexpected focus level, or devices.\n\nShopify’s Polaris design system initially grew out of Shopify’s Store\nManagement product. When the Shopify Retail team kicked off a project to\ndesign the next generation _point-of-sale_(POS) system, they realized that the\npatterns in Polaris didn’t exactly fit their needs. The POS system needed to\nwork well in a retail space, often under bright lighting. The app needed to be\nused at arm’s length, twenty-four to thirty-six inches away from the merchant.\nAnd unlike the core admin, where the primary interaction is between the\nmerchant and the UI, merchants using the POS system needed to prioritize their\ninteractions with their customers instead of the UI. The Retail team wanted\nmerchants to achieve an “eyes-closed” level of mastery over the UI so they\ncould maintain eye contact with their customers.\n\nThe Retail team decided that the existing color palette, which only worked on\na light background, would not be clear enough under the bright lights of a\nretail shop. The type scale was also too small to be used at arm’s length. And\nin order for merchants to use the POS system without breaking eye contact with\ncustomers, the buttons and other UI elements would need to be much larger.\n\nThe Retail team recognized that the current design system didn’t support a\nvariety of environmental scenarios. But after talking with the Polaris team,\nthey realized that other teams would benefit from the solutions they created.\nThe Warehouse team, for example, was also developing an app that needed to be\nused at arm’s length under bright lights. This work inspired the Polaris team\nto create a dark mode for the system (Fig 4.10).\n\n![Comparison of light and dark modes for navigation menus in the Polaris\ndesign system.](image/4.11_Polaris_Dark_Mode.png)Fig 4.10: Polaris light mode\n(left) and dark mode (right).\n\nThis feedback loop between product team and design system team is a great\nexample of how to build the right variation into your system. Build your\nsystem around helping your users navigate your product more clearly and\nserving content needs and you’ll unlock scalable expression.\n\nNow that we’ve looked at a few cases where variation works, let’s look at how\nwe can make that variation happen in a scalable way.\n\n## Approaches to Variation\n\nAlthough the reasons we need variation in a system may differ, the way we\nachieve variation is the same. We can vary either the components or the visual\nlanguage. Let’s look at both of these approaches in turn.\n\n### Varying your components\n\nAs we discussed in Chapter 3, components should be designed for flexibility.\nIn his article “Pattern Variations,” Brad Frost writes:\n\n> At the heart of a good design system is a set of solid, flexible components\n> that can be arranged to create cohesive, delightful user interfaces. An\n> effective design system provides components that are robust, resilient,\n> flexible, and adaptable\n> ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-04/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-04/)).\n\nThere are three main ways you can modify components to express variation:\n\n  * **Content.** The most obvious way is to change the content being displayed. Text, images, and media that feel tonally different will convey a different meaning, even if they’re displayed in the same component. \n  * **Structure.** The structure of a component can also change depending on context. In Chapter 3, I mentioned how the size lever impacts not just the design language, but also the general size of your elements. A story card, for example, could be bigger or smaller to convey a change in hierarchy. \n  * **Style.** The component could have different type, color, or spacing variations. \n\nThe _Guardian_ uses a variety of card sizes to create hierarchy on the page\nand to help a reader gauge a story’s importance (Fig 4.11). Components, too,\ncan contain visual variation to communicate a difference in tone. While the\n_Guardian_ uses structure and style to indicate variation, it’s also important\nto note how much the content itself communicates that range. Sometimes the\nbest strategy for supporting variation is to let the content speak.\n\n![Three examples of story cards from the Guardian, showing differences in\ncolor, text size, and image.](image/4.11.png)\n\nFig 4.11: Compare these three cards from the _Guardian_. The prominent,\nbeautifully shot food photography on the left whets the appetite. In the\nmiddle, the use of red for news content indicates that the message is serious.\nFor the opinion piece on the right, the focus on the columnist suggests that\nthis is a personal essay.\n\n### Varying your visual language\n\nThink of _____theming_ as a set of interconnected variables that allow you to\nrepresent a brand’s look and feel within your design system. Theming makes it\npossible to flexibly change the appearance of a product without changing the\nunderlying foundation of components.\n\nAt Vox, theming allowed us to achieve a wide range of brand expression in our\ndesign system. Each of the components in the system was designed with a\ndefault theme to let the team focus on things like hierarchy, balance, and\nlayout first. Later, each of Vox Media’s brands got its own theme with a\ncustom color palette, typography, and spacing scale.\n\nTheming let us express the visual language for all of our brands in a scalable\nway. It consisted of a few layers:\n\n  * **Tokens:** A code identifier for each role, like `$text`.\n  * **Role:** The systematic usage of a token. We might give `$text` the role of “primary text color.”\n  * **Value:** The actual value of that style, such as an individual hex code assigned to a token. For example, `$text`’s individual hex code could be `#333333`. \n\nTheming works by assigning a token to every element in your UI. Tokens and\nroles don’t change, but values can be customized according to brand (Fig\n4.12). For example, you could say that your primary text color will always use\nthe `$text` color token, which will keep your system aligned as you create new\nvariations (Fig 4.13).\n\n![Comparison of light and dark themes applied to the same component, changing\nthe background and text colors.](image/4.13_Theming_Example.png)\n\nFig 4.12: An example of light and dark themes for a general promotion module. Roles, defined by token names, are consistent, but the individual values vary. **Token** | **Role** | **Light theme value** | **Dark theme value**  \n---|---|---|---  \n`$background` | Page background | #EEEEEE | #000000  \n`$surface` | Component background | #FFFFFF | #152935  \n`$text` | Primary text | #000000 | #FFFFFF  \n`$text-muted` | Muted text  | #3E5269 | #DFE6EB  \n`$interactive-action` | Primary action | #3D70B2 | #5AAAFA  \n`$interactive-on-text` | Primary action text | #FFFFFF | #FFFFFF  \nFig 4.13: Here’s how the tokens, roles, and values line up for the light and\ndark themes in Fig 4.12.\n\nFor theming to work, you need to give your tokens semantic rather than\ndescriptive names. If your buttons have a background color of `$color-blue`,\nyou’ll run into trouble down the line if you have to create a theme or if your\nbrand colors change.\n\n## Building Themes\n\nBefore you can begin creating themes, you need to determine an approach to\nyour theming. What degree of theming are you going to allow? Let’s think back\nto the levers and dials from Chapter 3. Are you going to let people just turn\na few dials or pull the big levers? There are two approaches you can take:\n\n  * **Theme only your dials.** One approach is to allow only the dials to be themed. In other words, you could allow for customization on type and color but nothing else—it would essentially be a applying a skin on top of the same interface. This approach is valuable if you’re creating a white-label product and want your customer to use their own colors, but otherwise keep the rest of the design elements the same.\n  * **Theme your dials and levers.** Or, you could allow for both the dials and levers to be themed. In addition to allowing for color and type to be customized, you could also allow for global scale and sizing to be adjusted.\n\nColor is the only dial you can successfully change _without changing anything\nelse_. Unless you’re swapping out fonts that have exactly the same metrics,\nyou’ll have to change spacing if fonts are altered (Fig 4.14).\n\n![Comparison of light and dark themes applied to the same component, changing\nthe font in addition to colors. ](image/4.15_Theming_Type.png)\n\nFig 4.14: The same component as in Fig 4.12. This time, though, we’ve changed\nthe primary font to the very narrow Druk Condensed Super. As you can see, once\nyou start changing type, other levers need to adjust around it.\n\nWe can use all of the foundations of creating a design language to create\nthemes. Our trifecta of type, space, and color contains the most common\nelements to define for expressive themes.\n\n### Theming type\n\nIf only theming type could be as simple as swapping in a different font and\ncalling it a day! But because typefaces vary so wildly, it’s hard to change a\nfont without making other significant changes to the design system. Fonts vary\nin optical sizing; even if two fonts are set at the same pixel value, an\noptically small typeface appears smaller than an optically large typeface. The\noptical sizing depends on each typeface’s physical characteristics. A font\nwith a small x-height, for example, looks smaller than a font with a large\nx-height.\n\nThe other problem with theming type is that all fonts have different vertical\nmetrics ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-05/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/04-05/)). Every\nfont file contains mathematical instructions that describe how to space each\ncharacter, including the amount of room a glyph should consume relative to its\nspecified size and the amount of space around it. That’s a long-winded way of\nsaying that fonts have different space built into them (Fig 4.15). You will be\nbewildered and astounded the first time you try to vertically align two fonts\nwithin one button component, I promise.\n\n![The letters “e” and “g” in three different fonts, showing how space and\nvertical sizing vary widely across\nfonts.](image/4.16_Fonts_Vertical_Metrics.png)\n\nFig 4.15: Fonts vary in vertical metrics and optical sizing. That makes\ntheming them a challenge.\n\nTheming type is challenging, but it’s not impossible. Here’s what I’ve learned\nabout how to make it work.\n\n#### Assign your tokens and roles\n\nThe first thing you need to do is assign your type tokens and roles.\n\n  * **How many categories of fonts do you need?** For our type system at Vox Media, we knew we wanted four categories of fonts. `$font1` was for story titles and headings within the body of an article. `$font2` was for the body copy. `$font3` was for the page or section headings. `$font4` was for metadata and UI copy like tags, captions, timestamps, and button text.\n  * **Which of these categories should be themed?** You could allow for custom fonts for each of these categories, or you could restrict some choices and only allow theming for a few categories. I can imagine an instance where you would let the heading font be customized but want to leave all UI fonts the same, if you’ve found a good UI font that works well across the board.\n  * **Decide on your type sizes and proportions.** When you allow type to be themed, you need to be deliberate about what choices will be baked into the system and what choices you’ll allow others to make. For our type system, we decided we would let teams change the baseline font size and the font ratio, but the role of type sizes would need to be consistent. We used our existing article page to determine how many type sizes we would need (Fig 4.16). The headline, for example, would use the Size 8 value while the byline would use the Size 1 value. This meant that one brand could have `44px` as its Size 8 and another could have `64px`, but the headline would always remain in proportion to the relative size of the other type on the page. \n\n![An article on the Verge, with different pieces of content annotated to show\nwhich type size they use.](image/4.17_Type_size_mapping_The_Verge.png)\n\nFig 4.16: Mapping your type sizes to elements on the page means your type will\nalways be proportional, even if the individual values change.\n\n#### Theming type sizes\n\nOnce you’ve assigned the type sizes to roles, you need to allow teams to\ncustomize those type sizes. You have two options here:\n\n  1. **Let teams choose each of those values individually.** This gives teams more control. They can rely on optical sizing to choose the values that make the most sense for each font. The downside is that this is a dial-setting approach. And as we’ve learned, setting type by making too many granular choices can make your overall system feel disharmonious.\n  2. **Let teams change the base font size and font ratio.** In other words, you’re letting them choose a font scale. This reduces the number of choices from ten to two. It also encourages designers to think about the big levers they want to pull, making their type feel more purposeful. The higher the font ratio, the larger the size contrast you’ll have between type headings (Fig 4.17). A font ratio of 1.125 will have less size contrast between headings than a font ratio of 1.333 (Fig 4.18). If the designers of one product decide they need a smaller size contrast between type sizes, they can choose the font ratio that will enable that. \n\n![Comparison between a long, low-space-contrast headline and a condensed,\nhigh-space contrast headline.](image/4.17.png)\n\nFig 4.17: A site with long headlines and less contrast between its heading and\nbody copy (left) might want to use a font ratio with less contrast. A more\ncondensed typeface paired with smaller typefaces (right) would benefit from a\ngreater font-ratio contrast.\n\n![Comparison between two different font ratios, showing higher contrast with a\nlarger ratio.](image/4.19_Font_ratios.png)\n\nFig 4.18: Two different type scales that vary in the contrast of their\nheadings. The left has a font ratio of 1.125 (minor third) and the right has a\nfont ratio of 1.333 (perfect fourth).\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that the trickiest part of theming text is dealing with\nthe variations in the space around the text. If you theme type, you also need\nto allow for the space around the type to be adjusted. At Vox, the way we\nsolved this was by theming the space around the type.\n\n### Theming space\n\nYou want space to be themed as a lever, not as dials. The global spacing in\nyour design system should feel holistic. If you have really tight spacing in\nsome components and really loose spacing in others, your pages will feel\nerratic.\n\nA team might want to theme space for a few reasons:\n\n     * They’re creating a task-driven experience and need compact spacing.\n     * They’re creating a marketing, brochure, or editorial experience and want more open spacing.\n     * They want the spacing to change based on device sizing.\n\nHaving a set of three density settings for your components could help people\ntheme space in a way that feels consistent. Why three? You don’t want to build\nin _too_ much variety. Having a compact space scale, default space scale, and\nloose space scale covers the most common variations.\n\nGmail’s density settings provide a good example (Fig 4.19). In this case, they\ngive the end user the option to adjust the layout’s density. For your\npurposes, you may choose to build density settings into your components to\nallow internal teams to choose the density that works best for the experience\nthey’re solving for.\n\nLet’s look again at our general promotion module (Fig 4.20). First, we can\ndecide the relationship of space between elements. In this case, we want a\nlarger unit of space before and after the content. Within the content, we want\nto use a slightly smaller unit of space.\n\nWe can define the vertical space in a card by choosing a number from our space\nscale (Fig 4.21). Regardless of the actual size of the spacing unit, we know\nthere will be more space above the headline and below the button. The card on\nthe left uses the small space scale while the card on the right uses the large\nspace scale. The card on the left is using the “Default” spacing scale, which\nmeans there will be `24px` around the content and `16px` between the content.\nLet’s say another team is using the design system, but they want to use the\n“Loose” space scale instead of “Default.” They can select that space scale\nglobally, and the general promotion module will automatically use the pixel\nvalues from the “Loose” scale.\n\n![Comparison of Gmail’s density settings, showing how the Comfortable and\nCompact themes differ in their spacing.](image/4.19.png)\n\nFig 4.19: Gmail’s density settings are a good example of how space can be\nthemed holistically.\n\n![Comparison of two variations of a component, showing how space sizes are\nadjusted between them.](image/4.21_Theming_Space.png)\n\nFig 4.20: When theming space, first map your components to space sizes and then allow the spacing scale to be adjusted.  Size | Compact | Default | Loose  \n---|---|---|---  \n0 | 0 × 0 | 0 × 0 | 0 × 0  \n1 | 2 × 2 | 4 × 4 | 8 × 8  \n2 | 4 × 4 | 8 × 8 | 12 × 12  \n3 | 8 × 8 | 12 × 12 | 16 × 16  \n4 | 12 × 12 | 16 × 16 | 24 × 24  \n5 | 16 × 16 | 24 × 24 | 32 × 32  \nFig 4.21: An example of five sizes on a space scale. The “Loose” scale has\nlarger values while the “Compact” scale has smaller values.\n\n### Theming color\n\nColor theming means changing the color values in an interface to match an\nindividual brand’s design language. There are two approaches for color\ntheming:\n\n  1. Allow foreground colors to be changed, but not the background color. \n  2. Allow both foreground and background colors to be themed. \n\nTheming only the foreground colors is much simpler, but also more limited. You\nwould typically choose just a few areas where you’ll allow customization. In\nthis case, you could say that `$brand-01` will be customizable, but every\nother color will stay the same. Then, you would specify all of the areas that\nwill use `$brand-01`. This is the minimum amount of theming possible, and it’s\ngood for when you want to give teams a small amount of customization—the\nvariations will feel pretty similar across the board (Fig 4.22).\n\nTheming both the background and foreground gets trickier. You’ll notice I talk\na lot about reducing the number of choices teams need to make when deciding on\ntheme values. There’s a good reason for my reluctance to open up a world of\noptions when it comes to theming.\n\n![Component theme changes showing how a button and highlight color can be blue\nor orange.](image/4.23_Theming_foreground_colors.png)\n\nFig 4.22: An example of only theming the foreground colors.\n\nWhen we created our first color system at Vox Media, we allowed for many, many\noptions. Practically every element of the page had a color variable associated\nwith it (Fig 4.23). The navigation started with `$nav-background-color`,\n`$nav-foreground-color`. Okay, sensible enough—but it progressed. `$nav-link-\ncolor`. `$nav-link-color-hover`. Then, we got to our dropdowns: `$nav-\ndropdown-bg-color`, `$nav-dropdown-fg-color`, `$nav-dropdown-link-color`,\n`$nav-dropdown-link-hover-color`. Just remembering this makes me sweat. And\nthese were only the color variables _in the navigation_. All in all, we ended\nup with almost three hundred different variables.\n\nOur thinking was: “Let’s give designers control! They’re experts at choosing\ncolors and will make much better choices than a machine.” In reality, though,\nthis degree of choice was completely overwhelming. We ended up with lots of\ninconsistency, and a ton of visual QA tickets.\n\nThere’s a better way to theme colors: color groups.\n\n![Comparison of two variations of a component, where every design element has\nbeen marked for color changes.](image/4.24_Granular_color_names.png)\n\nFig 4.23: These are granular color variables. Don’t do this!\n\n#### Color groups\n\nThe idea of color groups is that you define foreground colors based on their\nbackground colors. Then you apply a color group to a component. For example,\ninstead of setting individual values for every single element in our\nnavigation, we would assign it the “dark” color group.\n\n  * **Decide how many types of background colors you need.** Light and dark are the most common types of background colors, especially for complex applications when the primary goal of your theming is to switch between a “light” and “dark” mode. Editorial or content sites tend to use more colored backgrounds behind cards or containers. At Vox Media, we opted for four backgrounds: light, dark, bright, and muted. \n  * **Choose the background color values.** Decide the color values for each of these background colors. For example, the “light” background hex value could be `#ffffff`. \n  * **Decide how many types of foreground colors you need.** We used `$primary-foreground` for the more prominent text, `$secondary-foreground` for less prominent text, `$accent` for supplementary text (like tags), and `$link` for links.\n  * **Choose values for the foreground colors for each color group.** Now comes the part where you really put your color groups together. Start with one of your background colors and define each of the foreground color values (Fig 4.24). As you create each group, remember to test the accessibility of the color combinations to make sure the foreground and background colors are accessible when used together. \n\n![Comparison of dark and light color groups as applied to the same\ncomponent.](image/4.24.png)\n\nFig 4.24: Examples of dark and light color groups and how they map to\ncomponents.\n\nIt makes much more sense to group colors than to define every color\nindividually. The groupings help people think about color holistically when\nthey create a theme, which leads to more consistency: a link color will always\nbe the same when it’s on a dark background.\n\nThe color groups also mean you have one source of truth when it comes to\ntesting the accessibility of your color palette. If your color groups are\naccessible, then the color on your site will also be accessible. If you have\nan inaccessible color combination, you can fix that in your color group so\nthat it will permeate the entire site.\n\nColor is a powerful tool when it comes to theming. But please—vary responsibly\nand don’t create three hundred customizable values for color.\n\n## System Layers\n\nDesign systems shouldn’t be static—they should be able to flex and change over\ntime. We are building design systems for products that need to change rapidly.\nTo succeed, we need to account for change. Part of allowing for variation in a\nsystem is defining where change should happen most frequently.\n\nIn the book _How Buildings Learn_ , Stewart Brand explains that different\ntimescales can have an effect on a building:\n\n> Our basic argument is that there isn’t any such thing as a building. A\n> building properly conceived is several layers of longevity of built\n> components.\n\nThe layers Brand describes are _site_ , _structure_ , _skin_ , _services_ ,\n_space plan_ , and _stuff_ , ordered by an increasing frequency of evolution.\nSite, the location of a building, never changes, while stuff—chairs, desks,\nphones, etc.—can change often.\n\nThinking of our design systems in terms of layers that change at different\nfrequencies can help us support variation in a scalable way. For instance,\nchanging your underlying brand principles would mean that every other part of\nyour system would need to change, too. Changing your grid would impact\nlayouts.\n\nDesign systems don’t need to stifle creativity or limit brand expression. You\nhave a vast array of tools to express brand. Choose the ones that will serve\nyour brand purpose best and focus on turning them into signature patterns.\n\nUp to this point, we’ve focused on how to create a design system. However, we\ncan’t see the benefits of the system until it’s integrated into real products.\nIn the next chapter, we’ll look at how to _use_ a design system.\n\n\n# Chapter 5. Managing Design Systems\n\n![](image/5.png)\n\nA good design system helps you improvise. Think of it like cooking: if you’ve\ndone all the prep work ahead of time—chopped your vegetables, measured your\nspices—then you can start improvising as you assemble your ingredients.\n\nFollowing this metaphor, your design system is your pantry, not your cookbook.\nYou have space to create your own recipe, to add more garlic or less salt if\nyou want to, but you won’t switch to an entirely different cuisine because you\nwon’t have those ingredients.\n\nHow do you build a system people want to use? One that helps people improvise?\nThat empowers but doesn’t constrain? If we focus on what people need, it makes\nour systems stronger.\n\nThe best example I’ve heard of what it feels like to use a bad design system\nis this: “It’s like having to use a hammer when you actually need a\nscrewdriver.” We don’t want the users of our system stuck using the wrong tool\nfor the job.\n\n## The Right Tool for the Job\n\nThe worst thing we can do with a design system is create a bunch of tools that\ndon’t solve our team’s problems. Take care to choose the right component\nhierarchy for the scale of your team.\n\nLet’s pretend we’re in the business of making chairs instead of digital\nproducts. If I give my team pre-cut pieces of a chair, in the shape of a seat,\na back, and legs, with an instruction manual telling them how to put the chair\ntogether, they will all build the same chair. But what if I just give my team\nthe materials—oak planks, nails, paint—along with some guidelines about how to\nmake a comfortable chair? We may end up with several chairs that look\ndifferent, but they will still feel like they’re part of the same family\nbecause they’re built with the same materials and the same guidelines.\n\nIf you’re creating a design system for several teams, each with its own\ndesigners and developers, you’ll want to give those teams the freedom to\ndesign their own chairs. The system shouldn’t limit them from creating the\nbest possible experience. Basic components with guiding principles about how\nto craft good experiences give teams that flexibility.\n\nShould your system contain more basic components or more composite components?\nThat depends on the size of your product team, the breadth of your products,\nand the reach of your design system. If you look at Bootstrap, a system used\nby teams around the world, you’ll see that it mainly has basic components (Fig\n5.1). These components are flexible and general, which allows teams to combine\ncomponents in a much more flexible way.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, you may have a small team working on a\nsystem to make building and maintaining a single product more efficient. The\nteam maintaining the system may be the same team that uses it to build\nproducts. In this case, having a small collection of composite components,\ntailored to the team’s product objectives, might be enough.\n\nMailchimp’s design system has a handful of patterns that repeat throughout\ntheir product. Seven of their eleven components are composites (Fig 5.2). It\nwould be difficult for a team outside of Mailchimp to drop one of these\ncomponents into their product, because they are so specific to Mailchimp’s\nproduct needs.\n\n![A list of alert component examples in Bootstrap.](image/5.1_Bootstrap.png)\n\nFig 5.1: Bootstrap has a very broad reach, so its components are unstyled and\nfairly small.\n\n![Examples from Mailchimp’s design system, showing composite components like\nmeters, switchers, and subscriber tables.](image/5.2_Mailchimp_Components.png)\n\nFig 5.2: Mailchimp’s design system has patterns that are highly specific to\ntheir product.\n\nIf you fall somewhere in the middle—if you have multiple teams building\nmultiplatform products, say—it’s best to start with basic components and\nexpand from there. If you make components that are too large, too inflexible,\nor too singularly focused, users will end up creating their own patterns.\n\nYou also need to think about the types of product teams that will be using\nyour system. Some product teams within your organization may have more design\nand development resources than others. A team with more designers and\ndevelopers will be able to modify and create new components more easily than a\nteam with limited resources. If this is the case for your team, consider\nproviding product teams with options: either consume existing composite\ncomponents out of the box, or assemble a component using a set of basic\ncomponents.\n\n## Evolving Patterns from Products\n\nDesign systems shouldn’t be static, especially if you start with a narrow\nscope. After you’ve released a system, it’s important to monitor how it’s\nworking in products. Good systems evolve from real-world contexts.\n\nThe best way to evolve your design system is to test it in real products.\nProduct teams are deeply knowledgeable about solving specific user problems.\nThe systems team has the ability to see across product teams, finding common\npatterns and building scalable solutions. As Christopher Alexander said in _A\nPattern Language_ , “Patterns stay alive because the people who are using them\nare also testing them.”\n\nLet’s take a look at this real-world testing in action. My team at Shopify was\napproached by a product team that had found a limitation to a design-system\npattern. The logistics team at Shopify needed a way to warn users that they\nhad to finish setting up their account details before they could use a payment\nservice. So the team used a component for displaying the user’s information (a\ncard) and a component for displaying a warning (a banner). There was just one\nproblem: the banner component hadn’t been tested within a card, so the spacing\naround it was too generous (Fig 5.3).\n\n![A combination of components in the Polaris design system showing too much\nspacing.](image/5.3_Large_banner_in_card.png)\n\nFig 5.3: We had never tested a banner within a card before. This combination\nof components created too much space around the banner.\n\nA designer on the logistics team came to the Polaris team with the question,\n“How can we adapt banners in cards to keep the same style, but not lose out on\nso much space?” They proposed a change, then paired with a designer on the\nPolaris team to refine the styles. They iterated designs together in Sketch\nvia video call (the Polaris team is remote) before coming to a solution for a\nsimplified banner that would work in a card (Fig 5.4).\n\n![A redesigned component with more streamlined spacing, resulting in a new\nbanner variation.](image/5.4_Banner_in_card_component.png)\n\nFig 5.4: Designers from the logistics and Polaris teams worked together to\ncreate a simplified banner that fits better within a card. After some testing,\nthat banner variation was added to Polaris for other teams to use.\n\nThe logistics team then created a fork of this component to test in their\nproduct. After the component was deemed successful, it was folded back into\nthe system for the benefit of other teams.\n\nIt’s impossible to anticipate all of the features your system will need up\nfront. If you’ve set up a clear feedback loop between a systems team and a\nproduct team, then you will be able to evolve your system organically. A good\nfeedback loop starts with clear communication across teams.\n\n## Getting Buy-in\n\nIntroducing a design system means that some of the choices individuals were\nresponsible for making before will now be handled by the system. More\nspecifically, it means that _you_ are now responsible for making decisions\nthat people have been used to making themselves. Some people will be excited\nby this; others may resent losing that control.\n\nHowever, if people feel like their needs are reflected in the system—if they\nfeel like they were included in the process of creating it—then they’ll be\nmore likely to use it.\n\n  * **Include people in your planning exercises.** The planning exercises in the beginning of the book were designed with buy-in firmly in mind. Involving people from product teams to take part in the mission statement exercise will give you an idea of where they think the system could add the most value. The ecosystem-mapping exercise is also useful for group alignment. It helps draw connections between lack of consistency and a confusing user experience. \n  * **Change your approach for different disciplines.** I’m going to make a generalization here: developers tend to care about efficiency more than designers do. The software principle of “Don’t repeat yourself” (DRY) aims at reducing repetition of software patterns and translates very well to the concept of a design system. Because of this, I’ve found it much easier to sell developers on the concept of a design system. It’s not that designers don’t care about efficiency, but our core need to be creative sometimes trumps efficiency. When selling a design system to designers, focus your messaging around how a design system can help them make better user experiences and free them up to focus on more innovative problems.\n  * **Keep up your onboarding.** You’ve done all of this work to sell people on the value of a design system at the very beginning of the project. Everyone is on board. Except teams aren’t static. What do you do when new people join and they don’t understand why the system exists? You need to plan for how you want to introduce your design system to new team members. Creating some onboarding material that introduces the concept of the system, why it’s valuable, and how to use it will help you get buy-in every time a new person joins the team. \n\n## Governance and Feedback\n\nSome say the greatest risk to a design system is lack of adoption—but rapid\nadoption without a plan for how you’ll maintain the system is just as\ndangerous.\n\nPart of this challenge lies in the fact that the skills it takes to build a\ndesign system are different from the skills it takes to maintain a system.\nAfter you’ve finished your planning, you get into a flow state of creating and\ndocumenting new components. The design-system team is almost in pure making\nmode. Once you release a system for other teams to use, this making mode\ndiminishes. Suddenly you have to be in support mode. You could see your\nconfiguration of time go from a hundred percent making to sixty percent\nsupport and forty percent making. This rapid shift can sometimes come as a\nshock.\n\n  * **Decide what skills you need to maintain the system.** How do they differ from the skills it took to make the system? When you’re making a system, most of the work is design and development. Once you’re maintaining a system, especially one that’s gotten widespread adoption and needs to function as a product, then you need some different roles. Product management to manage a backlog and maintain a roadmap. Community management to handle community support, like communicating releases and answering questions. Data and research, to understand adoption rates and see how well your system is doing. \n  * **Rotate people.** You may also find that the people who were really excited about creating the design system are less jazzed about needing to spend most of their time supporting people using the system. Rotating people from the product teams to the systems team and from the systems team to the product teams can be healthy. By moving someone from the systems team to a product team, you have someone well-versed in the system who can advocate for it on the other side. Product team members, in turn, have all of the context about how to use the system to ship products. Rotating them onto the systems team can help make the system stronger because they know the low points of using the system.\n\n### Design-system ambassadors\n\nOne way to evolve your system is to have systems thinkers work on products.\nPeople who are invested in the growth and success of the system can be your\neyes and ears on the ground—identifying gaps in the system and bringing that\nknowledge back to the systems team.\n\nCompanies like Etsy, GOV.UK, and Sprout Social have all created a version of a\n“design-systems ambassador program.” In an interview with me, Ben Lister,\ndesign-systems lead at Sprout Social, outlined the benefits they’ve seen from\ntheir design-system ambassadors program:\n\n> Our Design System Ambassadors are designers from across the organization\n> that act as liaisons between their embedded teams and the design systems\n> team. They are our eyes, ears, and voice across the company. Design System\n> Ambassadors not only define and document their team’s design patterns and\n> components, but they also take ownership of them, keep their team synced on\n> design system initiatives, and uncover ways to include design system work on\n> their team’s roadmaps.\n\nThe GOV.UK design system has a “design-system working group” composed of\nmultidisciplinary representatives from across government\n([http://bkaprt.com/eds/05-01/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/05-01/)). Formed to\nensure that the design system effectively represents its users, the GOV.UK\nworking group:\n\n  * reviews proposals and contributions against the contribution criteria\n  * makes recommendations to help contributors improve their work\n  * advocates for the needs of colleagues across government\n\nThe goal of an ambassadors group is to decide on the roadmap for the design\nsystem. Ambassadors should vote on what the design systems team will work on\nnext.\n\nTo set up your own design-system ambassadors group, focus on people in your\ncompany who show a marked interest in your design system. Are some people\nalways asking questions and adding contributions? Start with the folks who are\nthe most invested.\n\n### Governance models\n\nAfter a system is in place, who is responsible for it—for maintaining it,\nevolving it, and providing support for it?\n\nNathan Curtis ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/05-02/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/05-02/))\nand Jina Anne ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/05-03/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/05-03/))\nhave written in depth about the various types of governance models for a\ndesign system. They’ve broken governance models into four categories:\n\n  * **Solitary:** A solitary model works well for a design system built by one team, primarily to serve its own needs. \n  * **Centralized:** A centralized model is a single, central team that produces and supports a system used by others. A centralized team can identify broader systems needs affecting many product teams, but may lack sufficient context into the day-to-day work of creating products.\n  * **Federated:** A federated model has designers from multiple product teams deciding on the system together. A federated team has context, but lacks the clear ownership that a centralized team has. \n  * **Cyclical:** This model is a combination of a centralized and federated model, where you have a centralized team whose primary responsibility is to maintain the system, but you welcome and encourage contributions from product teams. \n\nThe cyclical model sounds ideal, right? You get all of the benefits of using\nthe system in context but also the ability to see across product lines to\nidentify system needs.\n\nMaking this work, however, is harder than it seems. For starters, it can be\nvery difficult for the systems team to get that perspective on every product\nteam roadmap, and thus difficult for them to identify recurring problems.\nAlso, product teams are focused on shipping their individual products quickly.\nThey use the system because it’s efficient, but they may not have the time or\nenergy to contribute back to the system.\n\nIn order to make the cyclical model work, you need to be thoughtful about how\nyou’ll maintain the system—how you’ll build trust, find advocates, and\nencourage contribution.\n\n### Providing support\n\nThe systems team needs to play an active role in supporting product teams.\nIt’s not enough to publish a component. You need to enable product teams to\nprovide feedback on the component’s performance, and use that feedback to\nevolve components iteratively over time.\n\nPart of building a community around the design system is helping product teams\nknow how they can collaborate with you. If you’re a centralized systems team,\nyou should set up some communication channels so people know where to go when\nthey have questions:\n\n  * Choose a channel for quick questions and conversations about the design system. For instance, you could set up a Slack channel for ad hoc feedback, ideas, and questions.\n  * Organize bigger collaboration sessions. These could take the form of office hours, open-door policies, or training sessions. At Shopify, the Polaris team has design-system office hours every Monday; people can sign up for a short session to walk through how they can solve a problem using the design system. \n\nThese communication channels are all about building trust with the teams using\nyour system. The design system grows stronger when people contribute to it—and\npeople are more likely to contribute if they feel invested in the success of\nthe system. Decide on which contribution models make the most sense for your\nteam and then clearly broadcast them.\n\nA word of warning: it’s also easy to over-index here and give people more\nsupport than they need. In some cases, you may not want to walk someone\nthrough all of the ten steps they need to take to solve a problem. Suggest a\nfirst step, point them toward the documentation, and empower them to solve the\nproblem themselves.\n\n### Encouraging contribution\n\nIf you’re on a design-systems team, one of the main things you’ll have to deal\nwith is helping people understand how they can contribute to the system. The\ndesign system shouldn’t be a barrier to creating the best possible user\nexperiences. It’s important to clarify how the system can evolve.\n\nAt the beginning of this book, I mentioned that expressive design systems\nshould inspire use. In order for your design system to evolve, product teams\nneed to be using patterns in their products and contributing back to the\nsystem. One way of contributing back is by shipping code into the system,\neither via a bug fix or by submitting a new component. But developers aren’t\nthe only ones who can contribute to a system. Designers, researchers, content\nstrategists, and others can contribute by providing feedback when they find\ninconsistencies. They can make a suggestion to improve a component if they’ve\ndone their own user testing. They can suggest a revision to documentation if\nexisting content is unclear. Communicate to your teams that contributions can\ntake many forms and can come from anyone.\n\nBe mindful of the reasons people might not use or contribute back to a system.\nTeams are busy pushing on their own roadmaps and may not have time to\ncontribute back. They may lack the confidence, motivation, or permission to\ncontribute. Perhaps they perceive the systems team as gatekeepers.\n\nAnswering a few questions will help solicit more contributions:\n\n  * **Why should you contribute?** “Isn’t maintaining the system the system team’s responsibility? I’m busy over here trying to ship this update to my product.” Help people understand that their expertise and context are critical to maintaining a strong system. Remember, you don’t need to do this alone. If you’ve done a good job at getting buy-in from stakeholders, especially discipline leadership, you can lean on their support to advocate for why contributing back to the system matters. At Shopify, contributing back to the design system is baked into people’s job descriptions, so the expectation for collaboration is set from the very beginning.\n  * **How should you contribute?** “I have something I want to contribute. What do I do with it?” Point people in the right direction. The GOV.UK design system contains a “Community” section with information about how to propose a new component or pattern (Fig 5.5). They also include contribution criteria that help people decide if they should pitch a new pattern. The criteria specify that a pattern should be useful for several teams and not replicate an existing pattern. \n  * **Make a big deal when someone contributes.** Remember that you want to get continual buy-in for your design system. When someone contributes something meaningful back to the system, celebrate it. That could include making contribution stickers or making an announcement in Slack. Emphasize that this was a shared win. People will want to be part of the celebration. \n\n![GOV.UK’s Community page showing guidelines for proposing a component or\npattern for their design system.](image/5.5_Gov.Uk_Community_Section.png)\n\nFig 5.5: GOV.UK’s Community section includes information about the process for\nproposing a new pattern.\n\n## Start with a Simple System\n\nWhen you create an expressive design system, you’re not just creating reusable\ncomponents—you’re operationalizing design across an organization. Successful\ndesign systems have three major parts: components, guidelines for how the\ncomponents can be used, and a governance model that unifies the teams that use\nand contribute to the system.\n\nInstead of focusing intently on just one of these areas—like, say, shipping a\nUI library with hundreds of components—build your system by starting small in\neach.\n\nRemember Gall’s law, which John Gall suggested in his book _Systemantics_ as a\nrule of thumb for building systems:\n\n> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a\n> simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never\n> works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with\n> a working simple system.\n\nA working simple system contains a few components (with guidelines on how to\nuse them) that have been integrated into products. Until you complete the\ncycle of designing, building, releasing, and integrating the components, you\nwon’t have a complete system. Once a few components are functional and\nintegrated, you can evolve from there.\n\nThis is especially important because you want people to evolve the system. A\nsystem that feels too robust or complete may intimidate teams. They may feel\ndiscouraged from adapting it. Instead, focus on providing a core simple system\nand allow teams to improvise. That way, your system will become a continual\nloop between the systems team and the product teams.\n\nDesign systems shouldn’t suppress creativity. In _Thinking in Systems_ ,\nDonella Meadows explains how the greatest complexities of systems arise at\ntheir boundaries: forest species extend beyond the edge of the forest into the\nfield and field species extend into the forest. That leads to new species with\nunique compositions that inherit the qualities from both the forest and the\nfield. Borders contain the greatest sources of diversity and creativity.\n\nPay attention to the borders of your design system. How are people combining\nexisting system elements with custom styles to create new components? How are\npeople using the system in unexpected ways to solve problems? How are people\ntweaking styles that exist? You may find that multiple teams have started to\nadd another type heading style or a brighter variation on your primary color.\nStudy those behaviors and use them to guide the evolution of your system. If\nyou enable creativity at the boundaries, your system will grow and stay\nexpressive.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nLevittown is known as the first true American suburb. Not one town, in fact,\nbut seven planned communities in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland,\nand Puerto Rico, the Levittowns were designed by William Levitt with the goal\nof making housing affordable for Americans after World War II.\n\nLevitt made housing affordable through standardization: the houses were\nexactly the same, with a white picket fence, green lawns, and modern\nappliances. With built-in TVs and heated floors, all of the features of these\nhomes evoked an idealistic view of suburban life. Production of the homes was\nmodeled on assembly lines; building each home took twenty-seven steps, with\neach construction worker trained to perform just one. Standardization saved on\ncosts, so houses were built quickly and inexpensively, and more people were\nable to afford homes. It was the American dream!\n\nExcept it wasn’t the American dream for everyone. Levitt refused to sell\nhouses to people of color; the Levittowns were segregated communities. Levitt\nfamously said, “We can solve a housing problem or we can try to solve a racial\nproblem, but we can’t do both.”\n\nAround the same time, another developer, Morris Milgram, had a different\nmission—to create housing for everyone. His suburb, Concord Park, had the same\nidyllic features of Levittown, white picket fences and all. But Milgram set\nout to create a racially inclusive neighborhood, making the dream of the\nsuburban life accessible to _all_ Americans.\n\nSystems aren’t neutral. Systems reflect the values of the people who make the\nsystem.\n\nYour company’s design system is more than a set of tools. Through its\ncomponents, guidelines, and patterns, it tells a story about what your\norganization values. In other words, your design system reflects your\norganization. You have an opportunity—and an imperative—to use your design\nsystem to make your products more inclusive. Once something is in a system, it\ntravels fast. A decision to bake accessibility into your components from the\noutset is a big step toward making your products more accessible.\n\nYou can’t do this unless a heterogeneous group of people contributes to your\ndesign system. Pay attention to the demographics of your design-system\ncontributors. Do they represent a range of disciplines and backgrounds? If\nnot, then you need to make an effort to reach out to the people who aren’t\ncontributing and understand why they’re reluctant. Do they feel intimidated?\nAre the methods of contribution unclear? The more diverse the people who help\nshape your system are, the stronger and more inclusive your system will be.\n\nDesign systems are powerful. Use that power responsibly.\n\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nWriting a book had always been a “someday” goal for me, but I never would have\nwritten this without the encouragement of Katel LeDû. Thank you for believing\nin me.\n\nLisa Maria Marquis was my editor—an amazing partner in this process who helped\nme shape my thoughts into a clear narrative, pushed me to write more words,\nand patiently talked through concepts with me. This book is a million times\nbetter because of you.\n\nThank you to Caren Litherland for the editing, feedback, and skillful\nwordsmithing.\n\nTo Sophie Shepherd, Katie Kovalcin, and Alison Harshbarger: thank you for the\nfeedback, encouragement, and support throughout this entire process. I cherish\nour friendship. Let’s plan an actual relaxing vacation now.\n\nI’ve had the privilege to work with some of the brightest minds in the\nindustry at Vox Media and now at Shopify. There are too many of you to name,\nbut I’m so grateful for the opportunity to learn, grow, and make mistakes with\nyou.\n\nMaya Benari, Ben Lister, and Paul Murphy generously shared their experience\nand insights in my early research for this book.

I love you!\n\n\n# Resources\n\nHere are some resources that have shaped my thinking on systems and design.\nThey’ll encourage you to dig deeper into the topics we’ve covered and will\nhelp you expand your thinking on design systems.\n\n### Systems thinking\n\nWe’re surrounded by systems. The following resources aren’t specifically about\ndesign systems. Instead, they examine various types of systems in our\nlives—how they thrive and how they fail.\n\n  * _Thinking in Systems_ by Donella Meadows. This is an accessible primer on systems thinking. It will help you learn the conceptual tools and methods behind systems thinking and how you can use them to drive change. These methods are valuable as we try to implement and gain adoption for a design system. \n  * _A Pattern Language_ by Christopher Alexander. _A Pattern Language_ has been incredibly influential in design-systems thinking. What’s most interesting to me is how patterns connect to other patterns to solve a problem. \n  * _The Timeless Way of Building_ by Christopher Alexander. If _A Pattern Language_ documents patterns, _The Timeless Way of Building_ provides the framework and philosophy underpinning them. I especially like the concept of creating systems that feel alive, which Alexander goes back to throughout the book. \n  * _Seeing like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed_ by James C. Scott. This book is a heavy read. I find it important and necessary, though, because it explains how many systems that were designed to improve the human condition failed because they ended up only improving conditions for the makers of that system. \n  * The _Nice Try!_ podcast from Curbed. Do my coworkers think my constant comparisons of design systems and failed utopias is weird? Probably. But hear me out. Utopian cities were designed with the aspiration that society could be improved through a system. Many of them failed because they were so lofty that they didn’t consider how real people behave. So much here about designing real-world systems for people applies to our digital systems work.\n\n### Design\n\nThere’s so much about the design process that I didn’t get to cover in this\nbook. Thankfully, there are lots of good resources to help you develop your\ndesign language.\n\n  * _Design Systems_ by Alla Kholmatova. I didn’t cover many of the steps involved in creating a design system, namely because Kholmatova has already done that so well. Read this if you want to learn deeply about the process of creating a design system. \n  * _Interactions of Color_ by Josef Albers. If you want to understand how the interactions of colors influence how we perceive them, this book is a must. \n  * _Designing Interface Animation: Meaningful Motion for User Experience_ by Val Head. In this book, Head explains how animation can help improve feedback, orient users, direct attention, and express your brand’s personality. Start here if you want to define animation for your brand. \n  * “Including Animation in Your Design System” by Val Head ([http://bkaprt.com/eds/06-01/](http://bkaprt.com/eds/06-01/)). Once you understand how animation should feel for your brand, this article is a great primer on how to create a motion system—from setting up motion principles to implementation. \n\n### Service design\n\n  * _Orchestrating Experiences: Collaborative Design for Complexity_ by Chris Risdon and Patrick Quattlebaum. This book goes into serious depth about how to coordinate customer experiences that span multiple channels, touchpoints, and contexts. This is a great next step if you want to build on your ecosystem mapping. \n\n\n# References\n\nShortened URLs are numbered sequentially; the related long URLs are listed\nbelow for reference.\n\n##

Fisher Couldwell](https://owltastic.com)\n\n[@owltastic](http://twitter.com/owltastic)\n\n\nForeword IX\n\nThere are many reasons why I’m so excited that you’re holding this book right\nnow. To start, Andrew has years of experience creating design systems for\neveryone from small, agile clients to big, complex teams — in fact, he was\ndoing “system design” long before we had a name for it, and well before it\nfirst appeared in the growing list of skills which designers are required to\nknow.\n\nI, on the other hand, had long avoided thinking, reading, or talking about\nsystem design because it sounded big and terrifying and complicated. But\nconversations with Andrew about his approach made it feel simple, logical, and\n(believe it or not) fun to do. I’ve been telling him for years that he should\nwrite a book to help demystify system design for others, which is a big reason\nwhy I’m so glad this book is finally in your hands.\n\nIf you think system design won’t work for your complicated team, or are\nconfused by the jargon surrounding it, or just want to take some small steps\ntoday to be better at your job, this book is going to be a godsend for you.\nIt’s not written on behalf of any company, or to make anyone look good, so\nit’s an honest and unflinching look at the challenges and rewards that come\nwith designing systematically.\n\nThis book covers — and goes beyond — the more commonly explored topics\nsurrounding how to create a design system. It also gives us a helpful\nframework for how we can work together to create better experiences, and shows\nus how to lower the barriers between different teams and roles.\n\nIn addition to drawing on his own 15+ years of experience as a web designer,\nproduct designer, developer, manager, and system design lead, this book\nincludes a wealth of research; it covers case studies, articles, and examples\nfrom dozens of different teams.\n\nAndrew often says “system design is really a term we use to talk about best\ndesign practices.” The knowledge packed into this book will not only improve\nthe way you create experiences, it will also empower you to build stronger\nteams and a better world. We can’t wait to see what you do with it!\n\n![](image/mc-signature.png)\n\n\n10\n\nIntro—duc—tion\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nThis book covers what design systems are, why they are important, and how to\nget stakeholder buy-in to create one. It introduces you to a simple model, and\ntwo very different approaches to creating a design system. What’s unique about\nthis book is its focus on the importance of brand in design systems, and\ncreating documentation. It’s a comprehensive, practical guide that’s simple to\nfollow and easy on the eye.\n\nI’ve been designing and building websites, working on products, and creating\ndesign systems for over 15 years. During that time:\n\nI’ve been the solo designer and developer at a company.\n\nI’ve worked with small 1-5 person teams.\n\nI’ve worked with large 10-100+ person teams.\n\nI’ve led teams of designers.\n\nI’ve worked in-house, remotely, and as a freelancer.\n\nI’ve worked with and at small startups and large corporations.\n\nI’ve seen things go so wrong, so many times. I’ve learned from those\nexperiences, and worked with others to fix the problems we’ve encountered.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time learning, assimilating, and distilling all that I’ve\nlearned down to its simplest form. I’ve sold the value of simple system design\nthinking, models, terminology, and values to designers, developers, and\nstakeholders.\n\nAfter years of this, I’m left with dozens of Keynote decks, Google Docs,\ndesign systems docs, style guides, design files, code, scars, bruises, lessons\nlearned, enemies, friends, and a head full of thoughts.\n\nI decided to do something meaningful with all that experience. I sincerely\nhope you enjoy this book, and that it helps you and your team! :)\n\n![](image/ac-signature.png)\n\n\n12\n\n![](image/_texture2.png)\n\n12\n\nThis is real talk about creating design systems. No jargon, no glossing over\nthe hard realities, and no company hat. Just good advice, experience, and\npractical tips.\n\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nReal talk\n\nPerhaps my “real talk” approach is because of my roots: I was born and raised\nin the industrious north of England, where people value hard work and plain\nspeaking. Or perhaps it’s all my experiences — good and bad — that have shaped\nthe way I think and talk about designing and building websites and digital\nproducts.\n\nI don’t like jargon. I like to keep things simple. Nowhere is this more\nimportant than in system design, where communication and collaboration are\nessential. The simpler you keep things, the more successful you’ll be. This is\na theme throughout this book, from the design system model and terminology, to\npractical steps, to working with your team.\n\nI could tell you how to design, build, and document a design system for\nyourself, as a personal project. It would be awesome, but I doubt that’s a\nreality for many people reading this book. Chances are you work on, or lead a\nteam at a company… Or you plan to.\n\nThe realities of working in-house at companies — especially large companies —\nare often very different from the rosy perspectives we read about on Medium\nand company blogs, and hear about in design talks. These stories are told by\npeople wearing a company hat, who can only say generally positive things about\ntheir experience. They don’t talk about office politics and other hard\nrealities. I don’t work for anyone but myself. I’ll tell you — honestly — how\nto navigate the challenges of working in-house, with stakeholders, deadlines,\nlegacy problems (design, code, and people!), and all the other fun challenges\nwe encounter along the way.\n\nI’ve been in the creative trenches, fighting for the designers and developers\non my team, the brand, and the users. I’ve defeated the odds to create\nbeautiful and meaningful work. It’s not always easy. In fact, it’s often very\nhard, and very tiring. Sometimes it even feels hopeless, but perseverance and\nthe arsenal of knowledge you’ll learn in this book will set you in good stead\nto create the best work of your career!\n\n\n14\n\nWho is this book for?\n\nThis book is definitely more design-focussed, but we’ll be delving into the\nwhole process — which involves much more than just design.\n\nSelling, managing, and advocating are key to the success (or failure) of a\ndesign system. You can design a system in a matter of days, but you won’t get\nmuch further without the support and collaboration of developers, product\nmanagers, and other stakeholders. This book will help you reach and\ncollaborate with these stakeholders.\n\nWe’ll cover brand and digital guidelines, and how to create, document and roll\nout a design system. This book will also prepare you for how to build your\nteam, and set your system up for success.\n\nBuilding, integrating, and launching a design system is arguably the lion’s\nshare of the work. We won’t be covering development processes or writing\n(much) code, but we’ll certainly look at the overlap of design and\ndevelopment. It’s important that design and engineering teams work together,\nwhich is a theme throughout this book.\n\nThe role of development in design\n\nA design system will go nowhere without developers. A beautifully designed\nlibrary of design components is useless if it lives only in design software\nand documentation. It has to be built, deployed, maintained, and scaled. Do\nyou want to create a design system? Developers are your new best friends (if\nthey’re not already, which they should be).\n\nDevelopment should always be part of the design process. Designers and\ndevelopers working in silo — or even physically separated from each other (in\nthe workplace) — is bad for team culture, as well as the quality and\nefficiency of the work.\n\nWith any form of digital design — but especially system design — I encourage\nyou to discard this (lazy) notion of ‘the developers will figure it out’.\nInvolve developers. Get them interested in building the system with you, not\nafter you’ve finished designing it. We’ll talk about this more\n\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nthroughout this book.\n\nTechnology moves too fast for print\n\nThis book intentionally avoids referencing specific tools or software, save\nfor a few exceptions. Technology evolves so fast that anything I reference may\nbe obsolete by the time you read this! (Hello, it’s 2018/19 as I write this).\n\nThat said: the supporting website (01) for this book includes links to tools,\nresources, and articles relating to system design. They, at least, will remain\ncurrent.\n\nSystem design is not a scary thing\n\nA good place to start is to discard this notion that system design is a scary\nprocess, or an exclusive club for the design elite. System design is nothing\nnew. Unlike responsive design, Sass, CSS Grid, or Flexbox — nobody invented\nsystem design. It’s just a term our industry has given to cover the processes\nand habits that lead to the most efficient digital design, development, and\nmanagement. That’s all.\n\nFeel better? Good :)\n\nSystematic design\n\nIt might be easier to view system design as ‘a systematic approach to design’.\n\nSystem design is about not tackling design problems in isolation, or as one-\noffs. It’s about considering versatile solutions that can be used repeatedly\nand consistently throughout a product. It’s about not creating a different way\nto solve the same or similar problem every time you come across it.\n\n01. [designsystemfoundations.com](https://designsystemfoundations.com)\n\n\n16\n\nA design system is the end result of a systematic approach to design. It’s the\nharmonious package of design, code, guidelines, and documentation that’s used\nto build consistent, on-brand, and efficient websites and products.\n\nThe sobering reality\n\nHere’s the thing — and, sorry, this is the brutal and honest truth: if you’re\na designer working on websites, products or apps, and you’re not designing (at\nleast somewhat) systematically — you’re doing more harm than good.\n\nDo you choose a different font, weight, or size for every header?\n\nAre you creating a different button every time you need a call to action?\n\nEvery time you design a different (unnecessary) solution, you’re adding more\ncomplexity to the code. This leads to legacy problems. Future edits will be\nharder to make. Shipping new features or iterations will take longer. Page\nload times will increase. The user experience can be diminished. You get the\npicture.\n\nYou’re halfway there!\n\nThe good news is, you may already be designing systematically without even\nrealising that’s what you’re doing.\n\nWhen you decide to use only two typefaces...\n\nWhen you use title case instead of sentence case in certain scenarios...\n\nWhen you define a set of text styles or pick a colour palette…\n\nWhen you design to a consistent grid or use specific spacing…\n\n...and stick* to those design choices — you’re designing systematically.\n\nIf you design systematically, you’ll be a better digital designer for it. You\ndon’t necessarily have to create a design system, to ‘do’ system design! Not\nevery project requires a design system. We’ll get into this more throughout\nthis book, but just keep in mind: even if you don’t need a design system,\n\n\nIntroduction 17\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nYou can design a system in a matter of days, but you won’t get much further\nwithout the support and collaboration of developers, product managers, and\nother stakeholders.\n\n\n18\n\ndon’t currently have one, or your company won’t grant you the time to create\none, you should still take a systematic approach to design.\n\n* To clarify: by “stick”, I don’t mean permanently. All design choices are subject to change and iteration.\n\nThis book will help you and your team\n\nThis book is about levelling up as a digital designer by taking those extra\nsteps to go from designing systematically to creating a design system.\n\nThis book will help you formulate and document the design choices you and your\nteam make. After all, a system wouldn’t be much of a system without rules.\nRemember: the systematic design choices you make are no good just in your head\n— especially if you’re working with a team.\n\nWe’ll look at the importance of brand in system design — first by creating\ndigital brand guidelines, then building design systems upon those solid\nfoundations.\n\nYou’ll learn about creating a design library of system elements that will\nenable your design team to work quickly, efficiently, and consistently.\n\nI’ll coach you on how to adjust your design system pitch to different\nstakeholders at your company in order to gain the support and momentum you\nneed to succeed.\n\nWe’ll talk (a lot) about the importance of finding your team, and working\ntogether to identify the problems in your product and processes — and\npractical things you can do to fix them. We’ll even look at two different\napproaches to these problems: an ‘iterative’ approach, and a ‘wholesale’\napproach.\n\nAnd throughout this book, I’ll share lots of real examples of design work,\ndocumentation, and best practices to illustrate the concepts covered.\n\n\nIntroduction 19\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nThank you for reading my book!

It’s perhaps easier to explain why\ndesign systems are important, and what they help us to do, than to explain\nexactly what they are. However, here’s my attempt at a definition:\n\nDesign systems bring order and consistency to digital products. They help to\nprotect the brand, elevate the user experience, and increase the speed and\nefficiency of how we design and build products. They are a source of truth and\na system of record for our design decisions. They hold us to high standards,\nkeep teams on the same page, and help to onboard new team members. They\ndocument the why, when, where, and how.\n\nI should stress that the design, build, and ‘rules’ of a system are not set in\nstone — they are a constant work in progress, open to iteration to improve,\nadapt, and scale.\n\nDesigning and building on-brand, quality, and consistent digital products at\nscale is hard. It’s even harder when your designers and engineers span\ndifferent product teams, departments, and locations. Success requires more\nthan an assortment of Photoshop or Sketch files, style guides, a print brand\nbook, pattern libraries, and whatever else your team may be working from. You\nneed a single source of truth.\n\nWhy are design systems important?\n\nHere are just some of the things design systems help us with:\n\n1\\. Efficiency and speed\n\nDesign systems allow us to work faster and more efficiently. They streamline\nthe design and development process — decreasing the amount of time it takes to\ndesign, build, and ship new websites, products, and features. They also enable\nteams to rapidly prototype and experiment with ideas in high fidelity —\nultimately saving the business time and money.\n\n2\\. Consistency and user experience\n\nDesign systems help us design and build on-brand, quality digital products.\nRather than working with a variety of styles and slightly\n\n\n22\n\ndiffering approaches, teams are able to follow guidelines and stay consistent.\nThis ensures interfaces are more predictable and accessible, which fosters\ntrust in users and helps with conversion and retention.\n\n3\\. Creating stronger brands\n\nDesign systems help weave brand identity throughout a product in a consistent\nand maintainable way. I’m a big believer that brand plays a crucial role in\ndesign systems. This is why I recommend thinking and designing holistically —\nconsidering the brand and product as a whole, as opposed to tackling problems\none-by-one and hoping the pieces will fit.\n\n4\\. They free us to focus on what matters\n\nDesign systems help designers and engineers spend less time needlessly\ncreating the same things over-and-over — slightly differently every time — and\nmore time focussing on user research, problem-solving, and building great\nproducts. They also help keep feedback focussed on the user experience, as\nopposed to debating padding, colours, and type choices.\n\n5\\. Organisation\n\nDesign systems keep our work organised, which makes everything easier — from\naccessing common design elements in a master library, to using a uniform\napproach for the structure and naming conventions in the code, to ease of\nmaintenance, iteration, and syncing of the design and code.\n\n6\\. Speaking the same language\n\nDesign systems help our teams communicate more clearly by establishing naming\nconventions and consistent terminology across the design and code. We’ll look\nat a simple design system model and terminology in the “Design System Model”\nchapter.\n\n7\\. Source of truth\n\nDesign systems and documentation are a source of truth for the whole team. A\nwell designed, implemented, and maintained design system sets high standards\nfor your product and your process. Everyone becomes accountable for upholding\nthese standards.\n\n\nWhat is a design system? 23\n\nWhen do we need design systems?\n\nDesign systems are always useful, but the ‘need’ for a design system varies\ngreatly depending on the nature of the business, product, or project.\n\nIt’s a reasonably common experience for design agencies, small companies, and\nfreelancers to design and build without a design system, then move on. This is\noften fine, and it works for many companies. The resulting product may be\nonline for only a couple years before it’s replaced when change is needed.\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with that process. It’s cost effective,\nsimple, and fast.\n\nDesign systems are useful when companies aim to iteratively work on a product\nover time — to not just build once, and replace later. This is why they’re\nmore frequently needed for products than marketing websites.\n\nDesign systems are especially useful when a team of people are working on the\nsame product. I can’t stress this point enough.\n\n“Software is often built by teams – sometimes incredibly large teams – of\npeople. The challenge to create coherent experiences multiplies exponentially\nas more people are added to the mix. Also, over time, no matter how consistent\nor small a team is, different people will contribute new solutions and styles,\ncausing experiences to diverge.”\n\nQuote taken from an article (1.1) by Karri Saarinen (1.2), a principal\ndesigner on the Airbnb design team.\n\nStartups are a little different. For startups, a design system can be a low\npriority, because everything tends to be wide open to radical and fast changes\nof direction. They rarely have the stability, security, budget, and timeframes\nthat established companies have. This isn’t to say startups\n\n1.1. [airbnb.design/building-a-visual-\nlanguage/](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)\n\n1.2. [karrisaarinen.com](https://karrisaarinen.com/)\n\n\n24\n\nshouldn’t be designing systematically; they just need to be more realistic\nabout their priorities. That said… Start as you mean to go on! If you create a\ndesign system from the start, you’ll avoid legacy problems later on.\n\nA recent trend is to bring design and development in-house. And the larger the\ncompany, the larger the product teams (for better or worse).\n\nMy time spent working with in-house design environments/people/teams/cultures\ntaught me a lot about the importance of design systems, and the intricacies of\ndesigners, developers, and product managers working together.\n\nWorking on products which involve lots of people requires a different approach\nthan projects with smaller, leaner teams. It’s more complicated, and there’s\nmore that can go wrong. The expression: ‘too many cooks spoil the broth’\nbecomes a little too real at times. Every member of the team has their own\npreferences about what typefaces, colours, buttons, formatting, spacing,\nframeworks, or naming conventions you should use.\n\nIt gets messy, if you allow it.\n\nDesign systems bring structure, accountability, and order to this chaos.\n\nLeading the way\n\nFor me, making the transition from freelance design into an in-house design\nleadership role was a learning experience, to say the least. Overseeing other\npeople doing the work — or working with a team of people on the same product —\nis very different to being the one person doing the work!\n\nDesign leadership and teamwork go beyond just handing-off design mockups,\nstyle guides, and specs. You need to find a way to create — and effectively\nand openly communicate — common, shared design guidelines, so everyone works\nin the same direction. The alternative is everyone does their own thing —\nreinventing the wheel, bloating the code, and damaging the brand and product\nuser experience. And sometimes,\n\n\nWhat is a design system? 25\n\nfalling out in the process.\n\nWhen you work on a team, your design thinking is useless if only you know\nabout it, or if it’s disruptively different from the approach of your\ncolleagues. You need to work together in the same direction. As other chapters\nin this book will demonstrate, a design system genuinely helps you to do this.\n\nThe real test...\n\nThe real test of a design system is whether the design and build mirror each\nother, and if you and your team consistently use the elements you establish\nrather than needlessly creating new ones.\n\nA successful design system liberates your team from reinventing the wheel. It\nallows you to focus on what really matters: learning and improving digital\nproducts to meet user and business goals. Heck, you might even create\nsomething amazing that you’re all proud of!\n\n\n26\n\nSelling a design system\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n26\n\n02\n\n![](image/83.png)\n\nSell—ing a Design System\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nSelling a design system 27\n\nSo far, I’ve talked about all the advantages a design system offers, many of\nwhich you’ve probably read about before. But before we get into design system\nmodels — and how to go about creating a design system — I want to take a\nminute to get real. Designers romanticise design systems in countless articles\nonline, and we make it sound so easy in our case studies. But the reality is:\n\nThey’re time-consuming to build and establish.\n\nThey take up a lot of development resources.\n\nThey distract from working on any roadmaps of features.\n\nThey’re tricky to maintain.\n\nDesigners can see them as a threat to their creativity.\n\nAnd, they require a lot of stakeholder support to succeed.\n\nHonestly, selling a design system could well be the hardest part of the\nprocess!\n\nYou need to convince a wide range of people — from the bottom to the top of\nthe chain of command — that it’s worth it. And it is, but I just listed a lot\nof legitimate reasons not to create a design system! And these are just some\nof the reasons why you’ll be told: “No”.\n\nTo avoid being told ‘No’, you need to learn how to teach the value of design\nsystems — and to earn the support and trust of stakeholders — or your design\nsystem is going to go nowhere.\n\nFind your partner(s)\n\nTo illustrate this process, I’ll share an example from my real-life experience\nof selling design systems at a company.\n\nAt this company, I had a partner in crime called Nick Stamas (2.1). Nick had\nalready started selling the idea of a design system before I came onboard. He\nhad a smart approach: rather than lead with: “let’s create a design system!”,\nhe gave presentations to a number of engineers from different product teams\nabout the advantages of a centralised code base, and promoted better\ncollaboration between designers and developers.\n\n\n28\n\nI was only an observer at these meetings. As a fellow design lead at the same\ncompany, I had a vested interest in this presentation going well, and I was\ngauging the response from the attendees. I recognised that this was the type\nof support and interest we’d need — to inspire, and to build — from a range of\nstakeholders.\n\nIn essence, Nick was sowing the seed of the idea of a design system by simply\nhighlighting common problems most developers can identify with and tailoring\nhis presentation to different teams. He was getting developers excited about\nthings they care about!\n\nTo quote from an article (2.2) Nick wrote about this process:\n\n“Sell a vision that everyone can buy in to. Selling is a process, probably\nmore than a single meeting. Look for teaching moments. Use your storytelling\nskills. Show your team that a better way is possible. Come up with a memorable\nname and say it a lot. Get people excited with a splashy presentation.”\n\nAside from these presentations, Nick had made a start on a design system which\nhe called Plasma (2.3).\n\nNick’s early approach was to begin with code — not to mock up anything in\ndesign software. He was building the bones of a code base in React by\ndocumenting basic system components like buttons and form inputs. He didn’t\nfocus on design or style. Instead, he focussed on getting the basics right,\nbuilding strong foundations, and creating a semantic system for naming\nconventions.\n\nOver time, he shared his progress with developers , one-by-one , getting them\nexcited about it. He started inviting other developers to contribute.\n\n2.1 [nickstamas.com](https://nickstamas.com/)\n\n2.2 [uxdesign.cc/selling-a-design-system-at-your-\ncompany-74cb2bc97195](https://uxdesign.cc/selling-a-design-system-at-your-\ncompany-74cb2bc97195)\n\n2.3 [roomfive.net/plasma-design-system/](https://roomfive.net/plasma-design-\nsystem/)\n\n\nSelling a design system 29\n\nHis intent was to prove that a simple, consistent, shared code base could be\nintegrated and maintained effectively and efficiently within his team and\nproduct, and ultimately across different teams and in different products.\n\nNote: Nick’s advantage was his diverse development and design skillset. He\nspoke the same language as engineers, which helped him pitch to them. Everyone\nhas their strengths. Play to yours, and your team’s. You don’t have to start a\ndesign system in code. The important message here is to get people who will be\ninvolved in the system excited about it! That often means proving your point,\nor earning people’s trust.\n\nMore than design and engineering\n\nIt’s important to note: in these early stages, Nick was also working with his\nlarger product team — including product managers and designers — to identify\nproblem areas in their products and processes that the design system would\naddress.\n\nSolving problems is a big part of the value proposition of a design system.\nThe more powerful stakeholders won’t care about what the product looks like,\nor your code base. They will care about solving problems, or more\nspecifically, the business success these solutions lead to.\n\n‘Finding your partners’ involves gaining support from all stakeholders, not\njust designers and developers. We’ll come back to Nick’s story, and this\nprocess of forging partnerships, throughout this book.\n\nLaying the foundations\n\nIn parallel to Nick’s story so far — as Nick was highlighting the need for a\ndesign system — I was working on what I called the ‘Digital Foundations’,\nwhich we’ll cover in the next chapter. For now, think of these as ‘digital\nbrand guidelines’.\n\nThese Digital Foundations were intended to act as a source of truth for our\nvalues and to guide the design, content, and build of all of the company’s\n\n\n30\n\ndigital products. I based this work on the company’s existing brand book*,\nwhich had been created with print and physical spaces in mind. After\nextrapolating what could successfully be applied to digital, I went on to\ngreatly expand it to cover digital product requirements.\n\n* Big brands commonly create — or commission an external agency to create — a ‘brand book’, which acts as a ‘manual’ for everything created for that brand.\n\nIt’s important for a large company to have brand guidelines to prevent\neveryone from doing their own thing, and to keep products from spiraling out\nof control. With the creation of these ‘Digital Foundations,’ our guidelines\nnow existed, but we hadn’t put them to work yet. Brand guidelines are of no\nuse on their own. They need to be practically implemented and adhered to, and\ndesign systems give us the perfect opportunity to do so.\n\nSo naturally, after a period of shadowing each other’s work, there came a\npoint where Nick and I teamed up to collaborate on a design system. Nick\ndirected the engineering and planning, and I led the design and creative\ndirection. We combined the Digital Foundations with the product needs that\nNick’s team had brainstormed, and the code Nick had written. Working with\nthese strong foundations, it didn’t take long for an on-brand, problem-\nsolving, and product-focussed design system to take shape.\n\nWe’ll delve more into the process of creating a design system later, but for\nnow, you can read a design case study article (2.4) about the Plasma design\nsystem described here.\n\nStart small, and adjust your pitch accordingly\n\nContinuing our story: in parallel to the design and build work, we continued\nto present to different stakeholders. Selling a design system\n\n2.4 [medium.com/@andrewcouldwell/plasma-design-\nsystem-4d63fb6c1afc](https://medium.com/owl-studios/plasma-design-\nsystem-4d63fb6c1afc)\n\n\nSelling a design system 31\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nSelling a design system 31\n\nSolving problems is a big part of the value proposition of a design system.\n\n\n32\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n32\n\nIf you believe in design systems and want to see one thrive at your company,\nyou need a compelling case that’s tailored to your business, team, and user\nneeds.\n\n\nSelling a design system 33\n\nnever really stops, no matter where you are in the process. We started small,\nworking our way up the chain of command, gaining support and momentum as we\nwent.\n\nIt’s impossible to say whether pitching the design system from top-to-bottom\nor bottom-to-top will work best at your company. It depends on the intricacies\nof different work culture, politics, personalities, and hierarchies. Have a\nthink about which will be more effective at your company. And remember, the\npoint is to tailor your pitch to your audience. You want to excite as many\npeople as possible with all the ways a design system will benefit them.\n\nFrom junior designers to design leads, from front-end developers to\nengineering leads, and from product managers to heads of departments: we spoke\nto a wide range of stakeholders, adjusting our pitch depending on who we were\ntalking to. Presentations were either broad, or focussed on design and code,\nbut they all emphasised the value of design systems. For example:\n\nProduct managers, leaders, and heads of departments...\n\n…care about how fast the team can ship products, and the impact the work has\non business goals, sales, reports, and analytics.\n\nSell them on how a well-established design system allows for a faster, more\nefficient shipping cycle. Convince them of how taking the time to create a\ndesign system now will enable faster product releases and iteration, as well\nas a better user experience going forward. In a ‘perfect world’, this\nincreases the potential for growth, sales, and analytics trending in the right\ndirection.\n\nAnd remember, a really successful system will also unify the teams working\nwith it, creating a healthier work culture, staff retention, and tool for\nrecruiting talent. The leaders in your company should care about these things!\n\n\n34\n\nEngineers...\n\n...care about a unified code base, version control, consistency, performance,\norganisation, efficiency, and naming conventions.\n\nSell them on how design systems will help bridge the gap between designers and\ndevelopers, and their positive impact on all the engineering factors they care\nabout. If you’re not comfortable speaking their language; work with a\ndeveloper on these engineering pitches.\n\nDesigners...\n\n...care about aesthetics, brand, typography, colour, user experience, and\nshipping beautiful products, which stay true to their original vision.\n\nGet them excited about how great the end product will look! Anything relating\nto the front-end being a ‘pixel perfect’ reproduction of their designs will be\nmusic to their ears. Be careful not to scare the more visual designers on your\nteam , as some will view design systems as a threat to their creativity.\nInstead, focus on how quickly and efficiently they can design with pre-defined\nsystem components in their design tools of choice. The system will curb the\nintroduction of rogue elements like buttons and form inputs, freeing them to\nfocus on more interesting tasks like problem solving, layout, and user\nexperience. The best designers on your team will be excited about this, and it\nwill be a valuable learning experience for everyone else.\n\nWe’re all in this together\n\nFor all parties, be sure to pitch the importance of this being a collaborative\nteam effort. Some may worry their voice won’t be heard, or that the system\nwill go against how they like to work. A good design system won’t be designed\nand built by only a few people, then closed to changes from everyone. It will\nevolve. It requires everyone’s input and support, over time, in different\ncapacities. It will help everyone, and it will help the business. It’s\nsomething everyone should be proud of.\n\nThe following screenshot (fig 2.1) is from a deck I used to present to an\nexecutive when I was the System Design Lead at a previous employer. This\nexecutive was not a designer or a developer, but a powerful individual\n\n\nSelling a design system 35\n\nwith significant influence and connections. A fellow design lead at the\ncompany told me this person would be interested in the digital brand\nguidelines I was working on, and could be a powerful ally for our design\nsystem initiatives. With their advice, I contacted the executive, set a\ndate/time/place for a meeting, and started preparing this presentation.\n\nThis particular stakeholder didn’t know or care about what designers were\ndoing in Sketch, or how developers were refactoring code. The way to reach\nthis person was to pitch:\n\nWhat is the value of a design system to our company?\n\nThe design system saves us time and money because _____ (e.g. we can ship\nupdates faster, as engineers won’t have to write as much new code).\n\nThe design system makes us/you look good because _____ (e.g. we can release\nmore features per quarter, which will have a positive impact on sales).\n\nThe design system sets us apart from our competition because _____ (e.g. our\ncompetition doesn’t have a consistent brand across their\n\n![](image/109.png)\n\n![](image/screen-sell-deck.png)\n\nfig 2.1 Presentation deck\n\n\n36\n\ndigital platforms, so we can stand out from the crowd with a stronger brand\nand user experience).\n\nOur competitors are doing _____, which helps them because _____. (e.g. They\nare publicly sharing their design system, which helps them recruit a higher-\ncaliber of designer and engineer).\n\nHow can you help us achieve this? (e.g. We need your endorsement. And who else\ndo you recommend we talk to, to make this happen?).\n\nProve to them how what you’re pitching helps the company, and makes us (i.e.\nthe stakeholder and the company at large) look good in the process! It’s hard\nfor managers and executives to turn down something that makes them look good,\nwhen often all they have to do is say “Yes” and grant you an endorsement and a\nfew connections. It’s a win-win for everyone.\n\nAt what stage do you sell?\n\nThis chapter on selling a design system was one of the hardest to place in\nthis book. There is no strict linear structure to this book, but ‘selling a\ndesign system’ doesn’t belong at the end — because you don’t want to put in a\nlot of work only to be told “No” by someone higher up the chain of command.\nAnd it doesn’t belong at the start, because you don’t know yet what you’re\nselling. You first need to understand what a design system is, why it’s\nvaluable, and what problems you’re solving in order to build and present your\ncase.\n\nThe key thing to understand is: selling a design system isn’t a stage of the\nprocess. It’s ongoing. You need to always be advocating for the system, or it\nwill fail. Even — and perhaps especially — after you’ve successfully designed,\nbuilt, and integrated the system.\n\nAll it takes is a powerful stakeholder to come on board and decide they don’t\nlike a systematic approach to design, and the whole thing comes crashing down.\nBelieve me, I’ve seen this happen. However, if you’ve been gathering support\nthroughout the conception and creation phases, the design system will have a\nbetter chance of weathering organisational changes and individuals who oppose\nit.\n\n\nSelling a design system 37\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nSelling a design system 37\n\nSelling a design system isn’t a stage of the process. It’s ongoing.\n\n\n38\n\nThe importance and quality of ‘the sell’\n\nYou need a convincing pitch to sell your vision, and you need to present it\npassionately and concisely — as some stakeholders’ time and attention can be\nlimited.\n\nAt large companies with more complex hierarchies (and the politics that come\nwith that), I like to think of it as being well armed before going into\nbattle. You stand a much better chance of being taken seriously if you build\nup an arsenal of data, problem statements, and industry examples to\ndemonstrate your points, as well as having the backing of a small army of\nsupporters all champing at the bit to get started.\n\nIt’s easy for higher-ups to say no. Very easy. As I mentioned earlier,\ncreating design systems can be involved, and therefore expensive to the\ncompany.\n\nSometimes, projects like design systems are rejected with good reason. The\nmore experience you get in the tech industry, the more you understand the\nimportance of saying no. Creating new things just for the sake of having\nsomething new often leads businesses down the wrong path. Just as we shouldn’t\ncreate new product features because one person ‘thinks it would be cool’, we\nalso shouldn’t create a design system ‘because everyone else is doing it’.\n\nSo, if you believe in design systems and want to see one thrive at your\ncompany, you need a compelling case that’s tailored to your business, team,\nand user needs. This helps your stakeholders to make informed decisions.\n\nIn the “Getting Started” chapter we’ll cover how to build a compelling case by\ninvestigating what problems exist in your product and team processes, and\ncommunicating how a design system can help to solve those problems. Matching\nproblems to a potential roadmap of solutions can be a compelling way to gain\nstakeholder support and turn “No” into “Yes”.\n\n\nSelling a design system 39\n\nA word on office politics\n\nEvery stakeholder wants something different. Some focus purely on the business\nneeds. Some care most about customer happiness.\n\nAnd — let’s be honest — others may be driven by a selfish motivation. I’ve\nseen employees driven by something as trivial as taking credit, winning an\naward, or gaining a portfolio piece. Others have more toxic incentives, and\nwill make poor decisions to ‘earn’ a promotion at the expense of their team.\nUnfortunately, you have to navigate these people and work around them, or find\na way to make their goals fit with your broader goal of creating better\nproducts.\n\nHere’s my advice on office politics: try to understand what’s really driving\neveryone involved in your product.\n\nYour primary goal should be to rally those with pure motivations to join your\ncause.\n\nFor stakeholders who care about business needs; play up the speed of iteration\nthat comes with design systems.\n\nFor designers who want to make something beautiful for your users; advocate\nfor the quality output that comes with a well-crafted library of elements.\n\nFor developers who want well-performing code; celebrate the efficiency of a\nconsistently designed interface.\n\nIf you are passionate and well-informed, you’ll build a team of like-minded\nadvocates that can defeat any of the self-involved office politicians who\nmight try to stand in your way.\n\nIt may also be possible to convince those who have selfish motivations that a\ndesign system will make them look good, help them win an award, or gain them\nthe promotion they’re after — in which case they could become its biggest\nchampion. The point is to understand what’s driving your stakeholders, and\nwork with them accordingly.\n\n\n40\n\nCreating a design system is a process. It’s a long-haul — and often expensive\n— project that takes up a lot of time and resources which involves more people\nin your organisation than just designers and developers.\n\nIt stands to reason that design systems are easier to implement at smaller\norganisations. A smaller design team will create less rogue design elements,\nand a smaller engineering team means less friction in the code base. There are\nalso fewer people with the word ‘manager’ in their title, which often means\nthere are fewer opportunities for things to go wrong. There’s less need for\nbuy-in or permission, which means there’s greater potential for faster\nprogress.\n\nLarger organisations are a different animal. More hierarchy means more\nchannels for decisions to go through to be approved and implemented. Think\nabout what happens when there are dozens — even hundreds — of designers,\nengineers, and managers split across multiple teams, all working on the same\nfamily of products. Some of those teams may even be remote, nationwide, or\ninternational.\n\nIt gets complicated.\n\nThis isn’t intended to scare you, but rather to provide a dose of reality from\nthe trenches of my real-world experience. As I said in the beginning of this\nchapter, we romanticise about design systems, and we make it sound so easy.\nHopefully, now that we’ve explored some of the challenges of creating a design\nsystem, you’ll be better armed to deal with them as they arise.\n\nI admit selling a design system is hard work, and it’s not the sexy part that\ngets shared on Dribbble or Medium, but it’s important.\n\n\nSelling a design system 41\n\nIn summary\n\nStart small.\n\nBe prepared.\n\nIdentify the problems you’re trying to solve.\n\nDo some (enough) impressive design and build work to get people talking.\n\nMake friends and build a team of people excited to work with you.\n\nCome up with a cool name, and create a sexy presentation.\n\nTailor your pitch according to your audience.\n\nEarn trust and support.\n\nBe an advocate and a guardian for the system, and inspire others to do the\nsame.\n\n\n42\n\nLaying the foundations\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n42\n\n03\n\n![](image/131.png)\n\nLaying the Found—ations\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nLaying the foundations 43\n\nIt’s easy to explain how brands and products go astray, especially nowadays\nwith the trend of staffing huge in-house design teams with dozens of designers\nand engineers.\n\nIt takes a dedicated (and rare) kind of leadership to unify a team of\nindividuals. In sport, it’s the job of a coach to condition their players to\nadopt team tactics and play as a unit. In design and development, our teams\nare often so large, disparate, and constantly changing that we usually can’t\nrely on one manager to get us all on the same page.\n\nInstead, we can use guidelines for our brand, design, and code — as well as a\nclearly defined set of values and principles — to help us all work in sync.\n\nMy dad was a quantity surveyor; it was his job to evaluate building plans to\nassess the risk and cost required to create a solid structure. In many ways\nthis isn’t so different to what I do as a web designer and developer. Perhaps\nit’s because of his influence that I tend to think of my work in terms of\nconstruction, and why I believe the phrase ‘laying the foundations’ is a great\nmetaphor for how we should think about setting up brands, products, and teams\nfor success.\n\nIn order for teams to work together to create great products, they need a\nstrong foundation to build on. Just as a building built on sand won’t hold up\nas well as one built on stable foundations, a product built with a poorly\ndefined structure will quickly start to have issues. A solid set of guidelines\nand principles helps us achieve the cohesiveness, sturdiness, confidence, and\nscalability we need.\n\nIn this chapter, we’ll focus on how to create these digital brand guidelines\nand principles.\n\nPutting up scaffolding\n\nI want to be as real as possible in this book, which is why I’m going to be\nblunt for a minute. As design systems become more trendy, many design articles\nand case studies give idealistic accounts of creating beautiful\n\n\n44\n\ndesign systems, and sometimes they pass over the ugly, gritty details. This\ncan leave many designers feeling like a systematic approach won’t work for\ntheir team, because their team or product has too many issues to address.\nPerhaps you can’t just start from scratch with a shiny new system, as many\nseem to do in their polished case studies.\n\nIn keeping with my construction analogy: in a perfect world, you want to ‘lay\nthe foundations’, then build a beautiful ‘building’ (i.e. a design system and\nproduct) upon those foundations. Other times, it’s just not that simple. You\nmay have to deal with a crumbling structure that’s already in place. Out with\nthe old and in with the new isn’t always an option.\n\nIf you’ve inherited a mess and your team’s decided enough is enough, sometimes\nyou can take a wrecking ball to it and clear the way for a fresh start. But\nwhat should you do if you don’t have that luxury, and have to work with what\nyou’ve got? In these cases, you’ve got to build scaffolding around your\nexisting structure — stabilising, stopping the rot, and renovating it over\ntime.\n\nWorry not. Whether you’re facing a nice empty plot of land, a wrecking ball,\nor putting up scaffolding, the principles in this chapter will help you and\nyour team.\n\nThe importance of brand in system design\n\nI’m a big believer that brand is a core component to a design system. It’s why\nwe spend so much time and money on building unique design systems. Without a\nunique brand, an off-the-shelf, white-label system (e.g. Bootstrap 3.1) would\ndo the job.\n\nYou likely don’t want to use an open-source design system because it doesn’t\ncommunicate your brand story effectively. It might have everything you ‘need’,\nbut you want to create something that gives your brand a unique, strong, and\nfocussed voice to set you apart from your competitors.\n\n3.1 [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 45\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nLaying the foundations 45\n\nBrand foundations help to keep everyone on the same page, speaking the same\nlanguage, and working as a team — rather than a collection of individuals\ndoing their own thing.\n\n\n46\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\n46\n\n![](image/brand-dropbox-2.png)\n\n![](image/brand-dropbox-1.png)\n\n![](image/brand-dropbox-product.png)\n\nfig 3.3 Dropbox product\n\nFig 3.1 Dropbox brand\n\nFig 3.2 Dropbox marketing\n\n\nLaying the foundations 47\n\nLet’s look at a scenario where brand guidelines and design systems work well\ntogether.\n\nMarketing vs. product\n\nProduct design and web design are two distinct disciplines. You can’t — or\narguably shouldn’t — apply the same design methodologies or design systems to\ndesigning a product as you would to marketing design. Websites and products\noften have very different business objectives, use cases, and target\naudiences.\n\nTake Dropbox, for example, the bright colours, extreme spacing, large buttons,\nand dramatic typeface Dropbox use in their brand (fig 3.1) and marketing\nwebsite (fig 3.2) wouldn’t work in their product.\n\nDropbox’s marketing website is loud and confident, but their product succeeds\nby running quietly in the background — simply and efficiently. The last thing\ntheir product should be is loud, so it uses lighter colours, more compact\nspacing, smaller buttons, and a more reserved typeface, as seen in fig 3.3.\n\nHowever, some things are inherent throughout all of Dropbox’s digital\nproperties — like their use of their brand blue colour, their logo (or a\ncompact version of it), the odd illustration, sentence case, and certain other\nguiding principles. Their website and product are very different, visually and\nfunctionally, but there’s just enough similar about them to unify them under\none brand. And that’s very much by design.\n\nBrand guidelines help companies like Dropbox unify their marketing, product,\nadvertising, social media, copywriting, illustrations, icons, photography, and\nso on.\n\nThe threads that tie these different assets together need to be documented.\nThey are the brand foundations — the pillars that run through each floor of\nyour building, holding the whole thing together. Brand foundations help to\nkeep all designers and engineers at a company on the same page, speaking the\nsame language, and working as a team —\n\n\n48\n\nrather than a collection of individuals doing their own thing.\n\nDigital Foundations\n\nI call these digital brand guidelines “Digital Foundations”. Digital\nFoundations are different from traditional brand guidelines, for reasons I’ll\ngo into shortly.\n\nWhy give them the name Digital Foundations? Because it’s memorable. It\ndifferentiates digital assets from other brand assets like print materials or\nyour company’s physical space. It helps to reinforce the idea of ‘laying the\nfoundations’ for creating great products, and it works with our design system\nmodel*. Digital Foundations govern much of the foundational layer of the\nmodel, and guide the design of components and patterns too.\n\n* We’ll delve into the design system model in the next chapter.\n\nTraditional brand guidelines typically cover the do’s and don’ts of logo,\ncolours, art direction, brand values, and tone of voice. They are applicable\nto everything a company does. Some companies might publish these guidelines in\na ‘brand book’. Some companies produce a simple PDF.\n\nDigital is different. The same principles we apply to physical spaces and\nprint mediums don’t always work for digital, and there are some considerations\nthat only affect digital. Factors like accessibility and user experience\nimpact things like the colours we use (e.g. blue for navigation, red for\nerrors, and green for success, etc.). There are other considerations such as\ntypography, animation, grids, responsive design, different platforms and\noperating systems, localisation, formatting, animation, load times, etc. which\nare unique to the digital experience.\n\nWhere a brand book typically comes in print or PDF forms, the ever changing\nnature of digital experiences requires a more — well — digital approach.\nDigital Foundations are better suited to a dynamic, accessible, and easily\neditable digital form. Some companies choose to make their digital brand\nguidelines public, and we’ll look at a few of those in a bit. Others are\nprivate — for employee eyes only.\n\n\nLaying the foundations 49\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nLaying the foundations 49\n\nCreating values and standards as a team is a great way to open up a positive\ndialogue and momentum that you can take into future design system initiatives.\n\n\n50\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the things Digital Foundations cover.\n\nMission, values, and principles\n\nEveryone who works at your company should be aligned on what your company\ndoes, its core values, and its mission. Who is your target audience? What are\nyour design and engineering principles? You want to align your team with a\ncommon vision, set of standards, and way of thinking.\n\nMozilla (fig 3.4) has a page introducing their brand, mission statement, what\nthey stand for, and their design principles.\n\n“Mozilla is the champion for a healthy internet, one that is open and\naccessible for all, both technologically and culturally.”\n\nFirefox (fig 3.5), a product of Mozilla, builds upon its parent company’s\n\n![](image/159.png)\n\n![](image/docs-mozilla-1.png)\n\nFig 3.4 [mozilla.design/overview](https://mozilla.design/overview)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 51\n\nbrand with their own design values tailored to their products:\n\n“As we design new features for our existing products, and create new products,\nwe find ourselves asking — is this Firefoxy? Is what we’re making a clear\nexpression of what it means to be Firefox?”\n\nWhile it’s not sourced from digital brand guidelines (or design system\ndocumentation), I’d be a fool not to share the following stellar example of\nmission and values in a digital space. Basic, a design agency in the United\nStates, created a website called Basic Culture (fig 3.6), dedicated\n\n![](image/163.png)\n\n![](image/docs-firefox.png)\n\nFig 3.5 [design.firefox.com/values/](https://design.firefox.com/values/)\n\n\n52\n\nto sharing their ‘Culture Manual’. While the content is intended for internal\npurposes, it’s very much a statement to the outside world of ‘we do awesome\nwork, come work with us!’. Aside from the beautiful and memorable design and\nquirky animations, they confidently state their mission, values, and\nphilosophies in a memorable and inspirational way — what better way is there\nto present such content?\n\n“Do work you’ll be proud of. Work hard while doing it. Have fun, always. Don’t\nwait for permission. Be bold and try things. Mistakes happen. Learn from your\nmistakes. Be real. Be better. Love what you do.”\n\nI couldn’t agree more with this mission statement (above).\n\nThe content you define in this section of your Digital Foundations has to come\nfrom somewhere. Perhaps your company already has something similar for the\nbrand and company at large. If so, you should also document these values and\nmake them accessible to your team — it all helps to foster a better\nunderstanding of the company you work for. But\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/brand-basic-1.png)\n\nFig 3.6 [culture.basicagency.com](https://culture.basicagency.com/)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 53\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\nLaying the foundations 53\n\n![](image/brand-basic-5.png)\n\n![](image/brand-basic-6.png)\n\nFig 3.8 [culture.basicagency.com/our-\nway/](https://culture.basicagency.com/our-way/)\n\nFig 3.7 “How we think”\n\n\n54\n\nconsider that any existing brand values may be written with consumers,\nbusiness objectives, and the physical world in mind. You might want to write\nnew values specific to design, product, technology, and a digital audience.\n\nEarly in the formation of your Digital Foundations, gather a group of people\nwho best represent the diversity of teams working on digital products at your\ncompany — stakeholders, designers, copywriters, developers, marketing,\nproduct, etc. — and hash out your mission, values, standards, and principles.\nThis can be an illuminating and exciting part of creating the Digital\nFoundations, as it reminds everyone across departments what your common goals\nare. Creating these shared values and standards as a team is a great way to\nbring people together and open up a positive dialogue and momentum that you\ncan take into future design system initiatives.\n\nBrand identity\n\nYour brand identity covers everything from your logo, to typography, colour,\ntone of voice, photography, illustration, creative direction, motion, and so\non. It answers questions such as:\n\nWhat is our logo, and how do we use it?\n\nWhat fonts and colours do we use — why, when, and how do we use them?\n\nDo we have any cross-platform considerations (web, iOS, Android)?\n\nArt and creative direction: what style of imagery do we use?\n\nHow do we use photography, illustration, icons, animation, and video?\n\nDo we have any guiding principles for motion?\n\nUber Design (fig 3.9) has a comprehensive case study page dedicated to their\nbrand identity covering all of these topics, which forms the basis of their\ndigital, print, and physical design systems.\n\n\nLaying the foundations 55\n\nBrand identity is about more than just making things look good. The colours,\nwords, typefaces, shapes, graphics, and motion you use — and the way you use\nthem — can make your brand more or less accessible, memorable, or relatable.\nBrand identities heighten the user experience, and create a familiar and\nconsistent identity.\n\nMy personal project, Club of the Waves (fig 3.10), is a website with a simple\npurpose: to showcase artists and photographers whose work focusses on surfing\nand surf culture. The simplicity of the concept is reflected in both it’s\nbrand identity and design system. The brand uses just three colours:\n\nBlack for utility.\n\nRed to represent anything related to artists.\n\nBlue to represent anything related to photographers.\n\nIn the design system, these brand colours translate to section colour, links,\nbuttons, the logo, hover states, filters, accent colours, and so on.\n\nI should say — while the brand colours dictate meaning as an aid to\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/brand-uber-2.png)\n\nFig 3.9 [uber.design/case-studies/rebrand-2018](https://www.uber.design/case-\nstudies/rebrand-2018)\n\n\n56\n\nthe user experience and an embellishment — they are not required for\nunderstanding or navigation. Users can easily navigate without awareness of\nthese colours (if they were, say, colour blind, or just don’t pick up on the\nmeaning). Accessibility considerations like this are an important distinction\nbetween Digital Foundations and traditional brand guidelines\n\n![](image/184.png)\n\n![](image/cotw.png)\n\nFig 3.10 [clubofthewaves.com](https://clubofthewaves.com)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 57\n\n— as we’ll look at more in depth later in this chapter.\n\nGoogle is a great example of a company with a strong and consistent brand\nidentity (fig 3.11) threaded throughout its digital properties; their\nsimplicity, white space, clean design, logo, iconography, motion, colour, and\ntypography make their brand instantly recognisable. Google wrote a great\naccount (3.2) of how they designed their brand, and how it’s intended to be\nused systematically across their various products.\n\n“A new brand identity that makes Google more accessible and useful to our\nusers — wherever they may encounter it.”\n\n“The final logotype was tested exhaustively at various sizes and weights for\nmaximum legibility in all the new digital contexts. To guide usage in screen\nand print, we developed standards to cover all aspects of the logotype\nincluding spacing, clearance rules, product lockups, and redline\nspecifications for in-product treatments.”\n\nWe’ll cover documenting brand identity later in this book. In the meantime,\njust know that having strong guidelines for your brand identity is a vital\npiece of your Digital Foundations.\n\n![](image/187.png)\n\nFig 3.11 Google’s strong brand identity\n\n![](image/brand-google.png)\n\n3.2 [design.google/library/evolving-google-\nidentity/](https://design.google/library/evolving-google-identity/)\n\n\n58\n\nBrand tone of voice and copywriting\n\nHow does your company want to come across to its audience? We all have our own\ndistinct personalities and ways of talking. A brand is no different. If your\ndesigners aren’t aligned on what your brand’s voice and personality is, then\nthey’ll all do their own thing, and your brand voice will be weakened or lost.\nThis is why it’s vital to include copywriting guidelines in your Digital\nFoundations.\n\nThis interesting interview (3.3) with Molly Young (3.4) describes Warby\nParker’s “robust creative vision” when she joined them, and how that vision\ndefined the tone for their copywriting:\n\n“It [the Warby Parker brand] was very literary, and quirky, and fun. They had\nmood boards with a very specific bike, and a very specific edition of a book,\nand a calendar that they really liked the graphic design of. There was very\nspecific reference points. They would describe it to me as: ‘Warby Parker is\nthe person you want to sit next to at a dinner party. They are funny and\nsmart, and they get up to do the dishes.’”\n\nAs their ‘Director of Copy’, Molly worked with Warby Parker’s design team to\ntranslate this creative vision into brand copywriting guidelines.\n\nI like this approach. Copywriting starts with brand identity and vision and is\ninterpreted into a practical guide for its application in a digital product.\nThese guidelines help to create more user friendly and on-brand experiences.\n\n3.3 [link.medium.com/MlRsSmQABX](https://medium.com/percolate-design/building-\nbrands-a-conversation-with-molly-young-at-warby-parker-10173f4194b1)\n\n3.4 [molly-young.com](http://molly-young.com/)\n\n3.5 [airbnb.design/words-shape-design-2/](https://airbnb.design/words-shape-\ndesign-2/)\n\n3.6 [linkedin.com/in/joscelin-\ncooper-0262191/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joscelin-cooper-0262191/)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 59\n\nMolly also brings up an important point on copywriting in digital products,\nadvising that designers and copywriters should sit and work together:\n\n“If you put them [designers and copywriters] next to each other, they’ll be\nlooking at each other’s screens and asking each other questions, and\ninterrupting each other, and learning from each other. Once a copywriter knows\nhow a designer thinks and vice versa, you can work together really\nseamlessly.”\n\nI think this is great advice; much the same as I believe designers and\ndevelopers should sit and work together. Don’t segregate your teams. Have them\nwork together and benefit from each other’s expertise.\n\nAnother excellent article (3.5): Words Shape Design by Joscelin Cooper (3.6)\nat Airbnb, also describes the importance of copywriters and designers working\ntogether. Joscelin dispels the common (and unfortunate) expectation that a\ncopywriters role is to:\n\n“...provide a word layer to already-complete designs.”\n\nJoscelin advises designers and project leads to involve writers early.\nIdeally, projects should start with a “content kickoff”:\n\n“Getting a writer involved at the beginning means you’ll start design\nexplorations with a more informed perspective of the messages you’re working\nto convey.”\n\nJust as new design projects benefit from early considerations for voice and\ntone, so should the creation of your Digital Foundations that will in-turn\nguide all future digital content and design projects.\n\n\n60\n\nAtlassian (fig 3.12) introduce their brand “personality” as:\n\n“Our personality establishes the foundation of the Atlassian brand. It is a\nproduct of our mission, and a reflection of our culture, values, and promise\nto customers. We make sure that these traits come through in all of our\ncustomer-facing communications and content.”\n\nAs well as defining your brand tone of voice and personality, it’s good\npractice to define a shared vocabulary.\n\nThe Digital Foundations I created for WeWork include guidelines for brand\nterminology, so the team consistently uses the same language\n\n![](image/197.png)\n\nFig 3.12\n[atlassian.design/guidelines/brand/personality](https://www.atlassian.design/guidelines/brand/personality)\n\n![](image/docs-atlassian-2.png)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 61\n\nacross all properties (fig 3.13). For example, all companies have ‘customers’\nof some variety, but not all brands like to refer to them as “customers” or\n“clients”; instead they may use friendlier, more ‘human’ terms like: “members”\nor “guests”. A popular example is using “team” instead of “staff” or\n“employee”. Disney refer to their theme park employees as “cast members”. I’m\nsure your company has its own preferences… If so, document them so your whole\nteam knows about and uses them. This piece of your Digital Foundations will be\nespecially helpful for onboarding new team members, as learning the lingo of a\nnew company can sometimes be daunting.\n\nFormatting\n\nIn addition to tone and vocabulary, your Digital Foundations should include\nguidelines for formatting. For reasons we’re about to examine, being\nconsistent with punctuation, abbreviation, and language choice is vital for\nuser comprehension and team collaboration.\n\nWithout a source of truth, your team may be unsure about something\n\n![](image/201.png)\n\n![](image/docs-foundations-4.png)\n\nFig 3.13 [digital-foundations.netlify.com/brand-voice/](https://digital-\nfoundations.netlify.com/brand-voice/)\n\n\n62\n\nas basic as how to format a headline. Speaking from experience, you wouldn’t\nbelieve how much friction a question like: “do we use sentence case or title\ncase?” can cause across teams! Shakes head, remembering.\n\nThe next few example images (fig 3.14 \\- 3.18) are excerpts from Digital\nFoundations I’ve written in the past, including guidelines for writing\neverything from copy, titles, form labels, and calls to action. The screenshot\nabove (fig 3.14) is just one small piece of this documentation; it focusses on\nexplaining when to use sentence case versus title case in various product\nscenarios.\n\nFormatting guidelines could also answer questions such as:\n\nDo we use “and” or “&”?\n\nDo we put a period (“.”) at the end of a header?\n\nDo we use American English or British English?\n\nDo we use the Oxford comma?\n\n![](image/205.png)\n\n![](image/docs-foundations-3.png)\n\nFig 3.14 When do we use sentence case vs. title case?\n\n\nLaying the foundations 63\n\nTo you, these questions may seem inconsequential, but when you’re part of a\ndiverse team with varied (personal) approaches to writing, the answers may not\nbe obvious to everyone (fig 3.15).\n\nFor example, I live in the United States, but I’m from England. Although a\ngood deal of my audience are undoubtedly in the United States, I made a\ndecision to write this book in my native British English because this book is\navailable worldwide, where British English is more commonly used. If this book\nwas exclusively a digital product, I might decide to use American English for\nmy audience in the United States, and British English internationally.\n\nThese things may seem trivial to some people, but if you’re a San Francisco\nbased company with a good deal of your audience outside of the United States,\nyou should think about your approach to language and have guidelines in place.\n\n![](image/201.png)\n\n![](image/docs-foundations-5.png)\n\nFig 3.15 The little details can make a big difference\n\n\n64\n\nFormatting date and time\n\nAn important factor to consider with international audiences is that the\nUnited States, Europe, and Asia all format things like date, time, and\ncurrency very differently. Don’t make the mistake of assuming your\ninternational users will perceive everything the same way you do.\n\nFor example, when formatting dates (fig 3.16):\n\nThe United States puts the month before the day (MM/DD/YYYY).\n\nEurope puts the day before the month (DD/MM/YYYY).\n\nAsia puts the year before the month and the day (YYYY/MM/DD).\n\nTake my birth date for example (presents welcome): where I’m from (England), I\nwould write my birth date as:\n\n“24th June, 1982” or “24/06/1982”\n\n![](image/205.png)\n\nFig 3.16 Document formatting guidelines for dates\n\n![](image/docs-foundations-2.png)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 65\n\nBut in the United States, I would write:\n\n“June 24, 1982” or “06/24/1982”\n\nAlso, notice I wrote “th” after “24” in the first example... It’s common\npractice in the United Kingdom to add an ordinal indicator (e.g. 2nd, 3rd,\n4th) after an ordinal number (i.e. a date), where it’s less common to see\nordinal indicators for dates in the United States.\n\nAs for time: the United States (U.S.) is one of the only countries in the\nworld not to use the 24-hour clock (they use the 12-hour clock). Those not\nliving in the United States would understand that 09:00 is 9 in the morning,\nwhere 21:00 is 9 in the evening — but a good deal of people in the U.S. would\nneed to see 9:00 a.m. or 9:00 p.m. to make sense of these times. This is\nimportant, both for companies in the U.S. building products that are used\nabroad, and for companies outside of the United States targeting a U.S.\naudience.\n\n![](image/217.png)\n\n![](image/docs-foundations-1.png)\n\nFig 3.17 Document formatting guidelines for time\n\n\n66\n\nSimilarly, the east and west coasts of the United States are in different time\nzones. If your target audience is nationwide in the U.S., being specific about\ntime is important. If you state that a game kicks off at 7:30 p.m., but don’t\nspecify 7:30 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time), your audience on the west coast\n(in the Pacific Standard Time zone) are gonna be pretty mad when they tune in\n3 hours too late!\n\nTime and date are tricky. There are so many different ways you can represent\nboth. When we look at something called ‘interface audits’ later in this book,\nyou may be surprised by how many different formats you find in your product\nfor time and date. If you’re referencing time, for example, you could write:\n\n“1 hour ago”\n\n“1 hr ago”\n\n1h ago\n\n1h\n\nA quick browse through several news websites shows how many different formats\nare used to express the exact same time and date. The following examples are\nreal:\n\nFeb 1, 2019\n\nFebruary 01, 2019\n\n1 February 2019\n\n1st February 2019, 4:04 pm\n\nFebruary 1, 2019, at 4:04 p.m.\n\nFebruary 1 2019, 4:04pm\n\nFeb. 1, 2019 4:04 p.m. ET\n\nFeb. 1, 2019, 4:04 PM EST\n\nFri 1 Feb 2019 16.04 GMT\n\n4:04 PM ET, Fri February 1, 2019\n\n16:04 EST, 1 February 2019\n\nGiven that there are so many different ways to format things like dates,\ntimes, numbers, and currency; including do’s and don’ts and example\n\n\nLaying the foundations 67\n\nscenarios in your Digital Foundations (fig 3.18) can provide a valuable\ndistinction for clarity sake.\n\nThe Google Material documentation (3.7) also has a section on best practices\nfor formatting date and time.\n\nNow that you’ve got a better sense of the importance of documenting these\nseemingly small details, I hope you’re motivated to include formatting\nguidelines in your Digital Foundations.\n\n![](image/197.png)\n\n![](image/docs-foundations-21.png)\n\nFig 3.18 [digital-foundations.netlify.com/formatting/](https://digital-\nfoundations.netlify.com/formatting/)\n\n3.7 [material.io/design/communication/data-\nformats.html](https://material.io/design/communication/data-formats.html)\n\n\n68\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n68\n\nDon’t assume your international audience perceives everything the same way you\ndo.\n\n\nLaying the foundations 69\n\nAccessibility and inclusivity\n\nIdeally, your company should already understand the importance of\naccessibility in their digital products. If not, I recommend reading: Planning\nfor Accessibility (3.8) by Laura Kalbag (3.9), which outlines a number of\nconsiderations to ‘make the case for accessibility — to yourself, coworkers,\nbosses, and clients’. Laura has also written a book (3.10) on accessibility.\nAnd I put together a list (3.11) of accessibility resources and tools on this\nbook’s website that you may find useful. So now you have no excuses! ;)\n\nMaybe you’re not sure why accessibility and inclusivity are that big of a\ndeal? Well, consider that accessibility isn’t just about disabilities and\nimpairments, but also people of different ages (young and old), and people who\nspeak a different language. We’re talking about a potentially very large\naudience!\n\nThere are several business benefits to creating more accessible products. For\nexample:\n\nA more accessible e-commerce product will have fewer sales fall through, and\nfewer community support and help enquiries and complaints.\n\nYou could expand your reach to a larger audience, giving you a competitive\nedge over your competitors.\n\nIf nothing else, you probably care about not being sued for discrimination!\nDepending on the countries and/or industries you operate in, an accessible\nsite may be required by law. Think about shops providing disabled access via\nramps and lifts/elevators, as opposed to (or in addition to) steps… Your\nonline shop is not so different.\n\n3.8 [alistapart.com/article/planning-for-\naccessibility/](https://alistapart.com/article/planning-for-accessibility/)\n\n3.9 [laurakalbag.com](https://laurakalbag.com/)\n\n3.10 [abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-\neveryone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone)\n\n3.11\n[designsystemfoundations.com/resources/](https://designsystemfoundations.com/resources/)\n\n\n70\n\nSimple accessibility issues include:\n\nUse of colour. Think about colour blindness. The contrast between text and\nbackground colour can affect the legibility and visibility of text.\n\nHow do you distinguish links, warnings, and changes of state? If you’re\nrelying only on a change of colour to indicate something, be aware that some\npeople won’t see that change of colour. Instead, try more explicit states —\nand changes of state — like an underline, or a different weight/size/position.\n\nForm inputs should always have a label. Without a label, an input (on its own)\nis most likely meaningless to a screen reader.\n\nIf you use icons on their own, without an accompanying text label — what does\nthe icon mean? This is as much a user experience, cultural, and common sense\nthing, as it is an accessibility issue.\n\nThink about people who use screen readers, or navigate websites with a\nkeyboard, as opposed to a mouse or trackpad. Not everyone navigates and\nconsumes content the same way.\n\nDo you rely on sound to convey something important? Not everyone can hear.\n\nWhen we talk about accessibility and inclusivity, we’re not just talking about\ndesigning for disabilities and impairments, we’re talking about everyone.\n\nFor example, physical (and mental) attributes deteriorate as we age. Of course\nit depends on your business and target audience, but is excluding people above\na certain age wise for your business? As Don Norman (3.12) puts it in his\nexcellent article (3.13):\n\n3.12 [jnd.org](https://jnd.org/)\n\n3.13 [fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-book-on-user-friendly-design-what-\ni-see-today-horrifies-me](https://www.fastcompany.com/90338379/i-wrote-the-\nbook-on-user-friendly-design-what-i-see-today-horrifies-me)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 71\n\n“The number of active, healthy oldsters is large–and increasing. We are not a\nniche market. And businesses should take note: we are good customers often\nwith more free time and discretionary income than younger people.”\n\nEspecially when designing for touchscreens and mobile devices, we should\nconsider things like small text being harder to read, or small touchpoints\nand/or touch-sensitive interactions being difficult to action as eye-hand\ncoordination declines, or when people are on the move. Have you ever watched\nan older family-member try to perform a ‘force touch’ on a screen or trackpad…\nYeah, good luck explaining that interaction! “Press it, but don’t press hard —\njust a little bit… No, too hard!”.\n\n“Are elderly people handicapped? Maybe, but so is a young, athletic parent\nwhile carrying a baby on one arm and a bag of groceries in the other (and\nperhaps trying to open their car door).”\n\nIf you haven’t put any accessibility standards in place already, you should\nresearch what you can do, start a discussion with your team, review your\nproducts, and take steps to improve your product’s accessibility. It’s a\nfascinating subject, and you may be surprised at what you learn and how much\nof a difference you can make.\n\nUse your Digital Foundations to document your standards, raise awareness by\neducating your team on accessibility issues in digital design, and write\nguidelines for how to design for accessibility.\n\nMicrosoft has a comprehensive page (fig 3.19) in their digital design\nguidelines on their dedication to inclusive design, including their\nprinciples, resources, toolkits, and case studies.\n\nSmall changes can make a big difference. Consider making inclusive design a\npart of your team’s design and product thinking.\n\n\n72\n\nResponsive design\n\nHopefully, you and your design team are already working ‘responsively’, but if\nyou’re not sure what I mean by this, don’t worry — you’re not alone. I’ve\nworked on many teams where some of the designers weren’t sure\n\n![](image/241.png)\n\nFig 3.19\n[microsoft.com/design/inclusive/](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)\n\n![](image/docs-microsoft-1.png)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 73\n\nhow to design with different browser widths and/or devices in mind. If this\ndescribes you, or someone on your team, pause here to read — or recommend — my\narticle (3.14) on responsive web design, which covers best practices for\nincorporating responsive web design into your design process.\n\nIf you’re already designing with responsive layouts in mind, you should\ndocument any responsive grids you use in your products, and best practices for\ndesigning responsively.\n\nResponsive design is a problem area I’ve experienced at many companies. You\nmay be surprised how little some web designers know about responsive design —\ndon’t take anything for granted. Instead, use your Digital Foundations as a\nplatform to educate your team and get everyone on the same page about\ndesigning for all screen sizes and devices.\n\nGoogle Material (fig 3.20) does a great job of documenting the makeup of their\nresponsive layout grid by clearly defining the makeup and terminology of a\nresponsive grid.\n\nMaterial clearly documents what ‘columns’, ‘gutters’, and ‘margins’ are, and\nhow they work across different breakpoints. Their guidelines explain\npercentage width columns versus fixed pixel (px) values, and flexible columns\nversus fixed gutter widths.\n\nProcess\n\nDocument your design, engineering, and even interviewing processes so everyone\nknows what is expected. You might even document things like naming conventions\nfor files and folder structure, to keep things organised.\n\n3.14 [medium.com/owl-studios/responsive-design-\naf7a1f14b991](https://medium.com/owl-studios/responsive-design-af7a1f14b991)\n\n\n74\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\n74\n\n![](image/docs-material-5.png)\n\nFig 3.20 [material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-\ngrid.html](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html)\n\n![](image/docs-material-4.png)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 75\n\nHow does your team approach a design problem, and answer questions like:\n\nFrom design thinking, brainstorming, sketching, wireframing, initial ideas,\ndesign mockups, design critiques, to design hand-off… What do you do?\n\nWho is responsible for what?\n\nHow do designers and engineers work together?\n\nHow do you go from design to code?\n\nYou should have a clear process for making iterations or additions to a design\nsystem, so everyone knows things like:\n\nHow is it decided what your team works on?\n\nHow and where do you keep track of tasks, to-dos, and so on?\n\nHave you updated the design library, as well as the code?\n\nHave you updated the documentation with the latest change?\n\nIf you’re not sure of the answers to these questions, then that’s proof you\nneed to discuss these topics — and document the answers and processes you\nagree on (i.e. your Digital Foundations) — with your team. Anything you can do\nto align your team on process is a good thing. Think about the benefit to new\nteam members who need to rapidly familiarise themselves with your team’s\nprocesses, or how a source of truth will help align your team on design\nprocess and workflows.\n\nDesign systems\n\nYour Digital Foundations are guidelines for all the best practices that fall\noutside of — and dovetail into — your actual design system(s), such as brand\nidentity, tone of voice, process, etc. Relating to design systems, your\nDigital Foundations should be a source of truth and answer questions like:\n\nDoes your team follow a specific model or methodology for design systems? In\nthe next chapter, I’ll introduce you to a simple design system model. If you\nchoose to follow that model — or for whatever\n\n\n76\n\nmethodology you use — you should outline it in your Digital Foundations, so\neveryone is on the same page.\n\nDo you use specific terminology to describe different aspects of your design\nsystem?\n\nWhy are design systems valuable to different teams at your company? You could\nrepurpose any pitches you’ve used while ‘selling your design system’, as\nreferenced in the previous chapter, to empower other team members to advocate\nfor the adoption of design systems.\n\nYour company may have more than one design system (one for marketing websites,\none for mobile apps, one for employee-facing products, one for customer-facing\nproducts, etc.), so these guidelines should be general enough to set the\nfoundation for all your design systems. To unify them under one brand, and to\nensure when your teams collaborate across different products, teams, and\ndepartments, that they are speaking the same language — using the same\nvocabulary and methodologies. From these Digital Foundations for design\nsystems, you can also link to any design system documentation and resources,\nif applicable.\n\nHow are Digital Foundations different to design system documentation?\n\nAs stated earlier with the Dropbox example, some things are inherent\nthroughout all of a brand’s digital properties (across marketing websites,\nproducts, apps, and so on). Each property can be very different — visually and\nfunctionally — but Digital Foundations help to unify a brand across all its\ndigital experiences. A company can have Digital Foundations and a design\nsystem; some companies even have multiple design systems to cover different\nproducts, each with their own documentation.\n\nDigital Foundations are more all-encompassing, covering brand identity,\nformatting, and “a shared vocabulary for design”, as IBM (fig 3.21) put it.\nDesign system documentation is more specific — it covers components and\npatterns created using the Digital Foundations as a starting point, but is\nspecifically for use in a particular website or product.\n\n\nLaying the foundations 77\n\nFor example, IBM’s Carbon design system (fig 3.22) was built upon the\nfoundations of their “IBM Design Language” (fig 3.21) brand guidelines.\n\nOnce their “IBM Design Language” guidelines (or their version of Digital\nFoundations) were in place, they had a strong foundation on which to build\ntheir design system.\n\n![](image/256.png)\n\nFig 3.22 [carbondesignsystem.com](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)\n\n![](image/docs-ibm-2.png)\n\n![](image/docs-ibm-1.png)\n\nFig 3.21 [ibm.com/design/language/](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/)\n\n\n78\n\nMake it visible, make it count\n\nMost importantly, your team needs easy access to these Digital Foundations.\nThe more accessible they are, the more likely your team are to adopt,\nunderstand, and even — ideally — contribute to them.\n\nThe way you present or document these guidelines, values, and principles will\nhave a big impact on their adoption. It might be smart to brainstorm with your\nteam how to proceed. Get them involved and excited about it.\n\nIt doesn’t have to (just) be a website, digital document, or a wiki — it could\nbe something visual in the physical space.\n\nPercolate, a marketing platform in New York City, put up posters (fig 3.23)\naround their office as a reminder of their values.\n\n“Our mission and vision keep us aligned to a common goal. Each value is paired\nwith a question that anyone within Percolate could ask themselves, to help\nthem understand whether the decision they’re making is aligned with the\ncompany.”\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/brand-percolate.png)\n\nFig 3.23 [percolate.com/values](https://percolate.com/values)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 79\n\nYour brand, design, and engineering principles are the mantra that guide\neverything you do. They are the driving force and inspiration. With every\nfoundation, component, pattern, template, web page, or banner you design, and\nwith each header and paragraph you write, ask yourself: “Does this align to\nour brand principles?”\n\nFocus Lab, a design agency in the United States, created a series of posters\n(fig 3.24) highlighting their design standards and hung them prominently\naround their studio space.\n\n“We have a collection of standards that we strive to live up to each day. We\nreference them just about every week in one way or another. They’ve become\npart of our lexicon in the office.”\n\nIt’s an interesting idea: to present design values, principles, and standards\nin the physical world — not just digitally. We are very passive in our\n\n![](image/205.png)\n\n![](image/brand-focuslab-4.png)\n\nFig 3.24 [focuslabllc.com/standards](https://focuslabllc.com/standards)\n\n\n80\n\nconsumption of most things digital. It’s easy to forget a website, or never\nrevisit it.\n\nPresenting design guidelines in the real world — in poster form (fig 3.25), a\ndesktop calendar, a sketchbook, a coaster, a desktop/phone wallpaper, and so\non — might be a brilliant way of getting people to notice and remember.\n\nMy former colleague, Keaton Price (3.15) came up with a cool idea to reinforce\nour design team’s values — by presenting them as an award (fig 3.26). He\ndesigned a beautiful postcard, and distributed a limited number of these cards\nto each team member. The idea was: if you experienced a member of the team\nexemplifying one of the team’s core values, then you would tick the value(s)\nthey exhibited, write them a personal message, sign it, and present it to them\nas an award. I can tell you from the perspective of someone who both received\nand gave these\n\n![](image/269.png)\n\n![](image/brand-focuslab-2.png)\n\nFig 3.25 Posters reminding team of their design values\n\n\nLaying the foundations 81\n\nawards that it was a great feeling, and did wonders for team and personal\nmorale too! It put a smile on someone’s face, showed gratitude and team\nspirit, and reinforced our team’s values. Win-win!\n\nAnd it doesn’t just have to be stating standards and values. You could get\ncreative — presenting other foundations like brand colours, typography,\nformatting reminders, art direction, and so on.\n\nJust get it done!\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the presentation of things — sometimes, so much\nso that we delay or even don’t do the things we wanted to do! As designers, we\nwant to create something beautiful and memorable. As developers, we’re tempted\nto build everything ourselves. I faced this very\n\n![](image/273.png)\n\n![](image/wework-keaton-cards.png)\n\nFig 3.26 Design team values presented as awards\n\n3.15 [keaton.design](http://keaton.design/)\n\n\n82\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n82\n\nThe more accessible your Digital Foundations are, the more likely your team\nare to adopt, understand, and even (ideally) contribute to them.\n\n\nLaying the foundations 83\n\nproblem on both fronts (as a designer and developer) when I first set out to\ncreate Digital Foundations. I was tempted to design and build a website as a\nvehicle for the content — but the content was practically bursting out of me,\nwaiting to be written — so I decided it was daft to let design and code stand\nin the way of progress.\n\nMy solution seemed so simple, yet so effective. I just opened a new Google Doc\n(3.16), and started writing. The content flowed out, free from the distraction\nof design software or code editors. Plus, a Google Doc is easy to share with\nyour team; they can contribute, comment, suggest edits, and invite more team\nmembers to join. It’s easy to reference from anywhere, on any device, even\noffline. It does almost everything you need it to do!\n\nHere is a screenshot (fig 3.27) from the Digital Foundations I created, in a\nGoogle Doc:\n\nOf course, it’s hard to get excited about a Google Doc. So in the longer\n\n![](image/282.png)\n\n![](image/docs-foundations-6.png)\n\nFig 3.27 Digital Foundations in a Google Doc\n\n3.16 [google.com/docs/about/](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)\n\n\n84\n\nterm, the Digital Foundations evolved into a more visually compelling and\nengaging entity (as a website), but the Google Doc did its job well, for a\nlong time. It’s worth considering.\n\nAgain, don’t let technology or design ego stand in the way of getting your\nDigital Foundations produced and out there with your team. The longer they\nstay unwritten, the longer your product woes will persist.\n\nWe’ll talk more about Google Docs in the “Document everything!” chapter, later\nin this book.\n\nFlaunt it\n\nIt’s not uncommon for companies to make their Digital Foundations or design\nsystem documentation public. This may seem like a strange decision… It’s kinda\nlike putting an instruction manual online for everyone to see, for something\nonly you use. However, it actually has its advantages.\n\nDigital Foundations are the best and most idealistic representation of your\nbrand. They are what your company aspires to be, what it wants to look like,\nand how it wants to make people think or feel. Presented well, they can paint\na brand in a positive light. They can even paper over the cracks — and let’s\nbe honest, some tech companies need any good press they can get! Design can\noffer these companies a great opportunity to look good in the public domain.\n\nInternally, the objective should be to align your team(s) on how you design\nand build products.\n\nExternally, it’s showbiz. It’s a confident move. It says: ‘We’re proud of the\ngreat work our team does. We’re awesome. Come work with us!’ And it works!\nDigital Foundations can be a great recruiting tool, and they can be great for\npublic relations. They can be beautifully designed, sexy, colourful, loud, or\nanimated. They can make the company look awesome, and they’re a great talking\npoint on social media and in design case studies.\n\n\nLaying the foundations 85\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\nLaying the foundations 85\n\n![](image/brand-mailchimp.png)\n\nFig 3.29 [mailchimp.com/design/](https://mailchimp.com/design/)\n\nFig 3.28 [uber.design/case-studies/rebrand-2018](https://www.uber.design/case-\nstudies/rebrand-2018)\n\n![](image/brand-uber-1.png)\n\n\n86\n\nUber Design (3.17) hired outside help from a respected design agency, Ueno\n(3.18) to help create and publically showcase their brand guidelines. Together\nthey created a splashy website (fig 3.28) to really maximise their impact and\nreach.\n\nMailChimp Design (fig 3.29) opted for a simpler, one-page website to showcase\ntheir 2018 redesign/brand. It’s part business promotion, part flexing design\nmuscle, and part recruitment tool. This approach can cost very little to do if\nyou do it internally.\n\nAnother growing trend for highlighting design and engineering at tech\ncompanies is to showcase a limited amount of digital brand guidelines\nalongside articles and case studies. Some even offer free design resources,\ndownloads, podcasts, and interviews.\n\nAirbnb Design (fig 3.30) and Microsoft Design (fig 3.31) both do something\nlike this:\n\nDon’t lose sight of why you’re doing this...\n\nPublishing your Digital Foundations for the world to see is a choice. It can\nbe great for public relations, and it can be a great recruitment tool. But the\nmost important thing is that you lay these foundations internally at your\ncompany for the benefit of your team(s) and your product(s). Outside attention\nis not the core reason for doing them.\n\nAnd keep in mind that the public brand guidelines you see online may be more\nfor show than anything — so by all means use them for inspiration, but don’t\nlose sight of your team’s particular needs, or let your desire to create\nsomething flashy get in the way of creating something useful.\n\nWith your Digital Foundations laid, let’s look at creating a design system!\n\n3.17 [uber.design](https://www.uber.design/)\n\n3.18 [ueno.co/work/uber-design](https://ueno.co/work/uber-design)\n\n\nLaying the foundations 87\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\nLaying the foundations 87\n\nFig 3.31 [microsoft.com/design/](https://www.microsoft.com/design/)\n\n![](image/brand-microsoft.png)\n\n![](image/brand-airbnb.png)\n\nFig 3.30 [airbnb.design](https://airbnb.design/)\n\n\n88\n\nDesign system model\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n88\n\n04\n\n![](image/308.png)\n\nDesign system model\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nDesign system model 89\n\nThe previous chapter talked about laying strong foundations for digital\nproducts at a company by establishing digital brand guidelines. With those\nfoundations in place, we’re ready to start building an on-brand design system\nthat combines our brand and digital guidelines with the user and business\nneeds.\n\nLet’s start with the basics by defining some terminology and looking at a\nsimple model for creating design systems.\n\nSpeaking the same language\n\nThe Internet is flooded with information on design systems, and I encourage\nyou to read as much as you can. However, the more you read about design\nsystems, the more you realise that everyone uses different terminology to\ndescribe the same or similar things. This starts to get very confusing,\nespecially when you’re trying to get other people (aka stakeholders) on board\nwith the idea of creating a design system.\n\nSpeaking the same language is very important when working with teams.\nCommunication is hard enough without adding different definitions for\ndifferent design system terms to the mix. So at the very least, you need to\nalign on what terminology you’re all using.\n\nOne thing to always keep in mind: the less jargon you use, the better.\n\nCommunication made easy\n\nFollowing one design system model is a great way to keep your team on the same\npage as to what each part of the system represents. A simple model will also\nassist you in selling the concept of design systems to stakeholders.\n\nAlso, the simpler the language you use in your design system model, the easier\nit will be to communicate. As covered in the previous chapter, you should\ndefine the (design system) terms your team is using in your Digital\nFoundations, or at least in your design system documentation.\n\nFor example, you may have heard design system lingo like: foundation,\n\n\n90\n\ncomponent, pattern, atom, molecule, and organism. But the thing is: after\nyou’ve read a few articles and spoken to a few different people, you realise\nthat people draw their own conclusions as to what each term means based on\ntheir use in a variety of different contexts. With an industry the size of\ntech — spanning international borders, languages, and cultures — it’s easy for\nthe meaning of terms to diverge.\n\nThis confusion is unavoidable, industry-wide. But it is avoidable on your\nteam(s). It’s an inefficient use of time and a frustrating experience for all\nto have to continually explain terminology to people and then debate which\nterm is better, so it’s important your team(s) align on a model, and a shared\nlanguage. The same goes for any naming conventions used in the design and code\nof a design system.\n\nNot everyone knows what you know\n\nIt’s easy to recommend you create Digital Foundations (see previous chapter)\nand to define the terminology of this model as a source of truth that’s\naccessible by everyone on the team. But not everyone sees your documentation.\nNot everyone reads the same articles you do, attends the same conferences, or\nshares your experience. And as much as I’d like them to, not everyone will\nread this book (though by all means, buy them all a copy!).\n\nI’ve made the mistake a few times of dropping design system lingo into\nconversations where there wasn’t a shared understanding of terminology, and\nit’s caused confusion and frustration. The lesson I learned is not to assume\neveryone knows what you know. It’s a simple and somewhat obvious lesson, but\nwe’re all guilty of it in one way or another.\n\nHere’s a simple way I got my team using the same terminology: in presentations\nto department heads, product managers, and designers (referring back to the\n“Selling a Design System” chapter), I would often start by briefly introducing\nwhat design systems are, and the model and terminology I was proposing we use.\nIt’s no use launching into a pitch if the people you’re addressing don’t\nunderstand what you’re talking about.\n\nI made this mistake again, later, when I assumed the engineering team(s)\n\n\nDesign system model 91\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nDesign system model 91\n\nIt’s important your team aligns on a design system model and a shared language\nthat everybody understands. The less jargon you use, the better.\n\n\n92\n\nwould know all about design systems, and that they’d be totally on board with\nthe concept. I was wrong, at least about the knowing part.\n\nI remember having a productive and enthusiastic chat about our plans for\ncreating a design system with an Engineering Lead. He got it. Everything. We\nwe were on the same page. But I was somewhat surprised when the meeting ended\nwith him asking me to schedule a presentation to our engineering teams, which,\nat the time, was dozens of people scattered around the planet! He asked me to\nexplain to them what design systems are, to introduce them to the model and\nterminology, and to help them understand why we should invest time in any of\nit.\n\nThankfully the presentation went well. Aligning everyone on the same page got\nthem excited about the project, and helped me earn their support. I was also\nable to answer any questions, dispel any concerns, and gain a lot of momentum.\n\nAligning on a model and terminology\n\nBack in 2016, I became a ‘Design System Lead’ at a large company and was\ntasked with launching a department-wide system design initiative for teams\nthat hadn’t worked with design systems before. While researching a design\nsystem model and terminology to use, I was confused by the many different\nterms — and jargon — I found to describe and break down a design system. Call\nme stubborn, but since what I found was too complicated, I created my own! My\ngoal with creating this model was to give the team a set of easy-to-understand\nterms that we could all start using with as little friction as possible.\n\nThe Foundations Model\n\nPlease feel free to use this model at your company, but don’t be afraid to\nchange the terminology to suit your team’s preferences. The most important\nthing is that you all understand and feel comfortable with it!\n\n\nDesign system model 93\n\nBelow is the model I came up with. I call it the ‘Foundations Model’:\n\nI came across the term ‘foundations’ a few times in my research. Its use case\nwas a little different every time, but as I mentioned in the previous chapter,\nI thought it was a great analogy for how to approach system design. In\nconstruction, foundations are crucial to a building’s stability, quality, and\nlongevity — and the same applies to building digital products. To reiterate\nwhat I said earlier:\n\nA building built on sand will only stand for so long. You need to lay strong\nfoundations, before you build anything.\n\nI’ve already shared my love of using construction analogies, but I really\nthink it’s no coincidence we use terms like ‘building’ in digital design.\nThere are many parallels between the construction and tech industries — from\narchitecture and design, to engineering and development, to quality assurance,\ndeployment, marketing, and maintenance.\n\nIn line with keeping things simple and easy for people to understand, it’s\nhelpful to think in visual terms. You could look at the design system model\n(fig 4.1) as a building made up of building blocks. Each level expands upon,\nintegrates with, and is built upon the level below.\n\n![](image/322.png)\n\n![](image/model-1.png)\n\nFig 4.1 The Foundations Model\n\n\n94\n\nIt’s also important to consider: there are many other factors involved in the\nprocess of creating or iterating on a design system (fig 4.2). User\nexperience, data, accessibility, content strategy, localisation, user testing,\nand brand should all be interwoven in every level of your design system model.\nThey are the glue, the cement, the beams, and the pillars that hold the model\ntogether, and make it great.\n\nLet’s get into what each level of our design system model is:\n\nFoundations\n\nAs we covered in depth in the previous chapter, your Digital Foundations\nshould be the basis for every digital project you do, including your design\nsystem(s). Foundations are multifaceted and arguably more extensive than the\nother levels, which is why they warranted their own chapter. There’s a reason\nthe model is named after this foundational layer.\n\nTo review, Digital Foundations include the subjects that brand guidelines\ntypically cover, such as guidelines for the identity, typography, text styles,\ncolour, icons, photography, imagery, and illustration. They also cover less\nvisual aspects like brand tone of voice, formatting choices, and things like\n\n![](image/326.png)\n\n![](image/model-2.png)\n\nFig 4.2 Many other factors are involved in design systems\n\n\nDesign system model 95\n\nbrand values and design and engineering principles.\n\nDigital Foundations also go beyond brand to span design and code issues, with\nguidelines for calls to action and links, layout and spacing, formatting of\ndate, time, and currency, localisation, responsive grids, animation, and\naccessibility.\n\nFoundations can be extensive or brief, depending on the size and complexity of\nyour product suite. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, your Digital\nFoundations are guidelines for things (such as brand values, logo treatment,\nformatting, etc.) that cover all your digital properties. However, other\naspects of your foundations may only be specific to one digital property — for\nexample, your company’s marketing site may use a responsive grid, but your\ndesktop or mobile app/product may not. Or, it’s not uncommon for different\ndigital properties to use fonts unique to them (think back to the Dropbox\nexample in the previous chapter). In these cases, you may have foundations\nthat are unique to the design system created for each digital property. Be\nsure to include any property-specific guidelines — along with the company-wide\nDigital Foundations you’ve already created — in your design system\ndocumentation.\n\n![](image/331.png)\n\n![](image/foundations-text-style.png)\n\nFig 4.3 Foundations example: text styles\n\n\n96\n\nA simple example of property-specific foundations are a set of text styles for\na website, which are different to those used in a mobile app. Defining a\nlimited set of text styles for headers, copy, quotes, captions, and so on is\nwise for consistency and user experience, as well as a streamlined code base.\nThe example (fig 4.3) shows two responsive text styles designed specifically\nfor headers and subheaders.\n\nComponents\n\nThese are the smaller building blocks of a digital product. Components are\ndistinctive user interface (UI) elements that are used repetitively throughout\na product. For the most part, they are actionable or at least used to convey\nmeaning.\n\nExamples include: buttons, form inputs, selects, textareas, radio buttons,\ncheckboxes, range sliders, toggles, avatars, tooltips, and so on. The example\nbelow (fig 4.4) shows a text input component and all its states:\n\nIt’s good practice to not get too carried away with creating completely\nbespoke components — for the most part, there’s rarely a need to\n\n![](image/334.png)\n\n![](image/components.png)\n\nFig 4.4 Components example: a text input\n\n\nDesign system model 97\n\nreinvent the wheel with these. There’s a good reason why selects (i.e. a form\ninput with an arrow, which opens a dropdown menu on-click) look the same on\nmost websites: people can instantly identify their function. This commonality,\nconsistency, and familiarity in digital interfaces are important, not boring.\nUsing conventional components (that aren’t ‘overstyled’) makes sure that\ninputs and actionable items are instantly recognisable to users. It also makes\nit easier for developers to build an accessible and consistent solution that\nworks across a variety of devices and browsers which isn’t too complicated or\ncode heavy.\n\nTake the example below (fig 4.5):\n\nThe component on the left is unmistakably a select — we know that if we click\nthe input, or the arrow, we will see a dropdown with more options. The\ncomponent on the right, however, could be mistaken for a button, or it could\nbe overlooked entirely as a non-actionable, purely decorative element. If this\nwere an e-commerce website, can you afford for some users to miss this\ncomponent and leave without making a purchase?\n\nPatterns\n\nThese are the larger building blocks of a digital product. Patterns refer to\nrecurring or ever-present elements or practices throughout a product. A\npattern can often be comprised of established foundations and components — for\nexample, a card pattern may feature a header and a description, using a couple\nof different text styles (foundations), and a button (component).\n\n![](image/338.png)\n\n![](image/component-bad.png)\n\nFig 4.5 One of these is more identifiable than the other\n\n\n98\n\nExamples include: navigation, footer, modals, alerts, notifications, tables,\nfeed cards, product cards, image galleries, carousels, feature or masthead\nareas, pagination, breadcrumbs, and so on. The example below (fig 4.6) shows a\nresponsive image gallery pattern:\n\nEven specific layouts or content blocks can be patterns — for example, a\nsimple, repeatable lock-up of image and text, like the example pattern below\n(fig 4.7):\n\nPatterns can also refer to less tangible factors, such as your philosophy for\nhow pages and content should load, your use of error states and animations, or\nwhat happens with empty states, onboarding, and guiding\n\n![](image/342.png)\n\n![](image/pattern-5.png)\n\nFig 4.7 Patterns example: simple modular layout of image and text\n\n![](image/344.png)\n\n![](image/pattern-6.png)\n\nFig 4.6 Patterns example: image carousel\n\n\nDesign system model 99\n\ntips throughout a product.\n\nPatterns are often modular, meaning they’re designed to pair well with other\npatterns to tell marketing stories, sell products, present content, cross-\nsell, and so on.\n\nTemplates and Pages\n\nFoundations, components, and patterns make up the basis of this design system\nmodel, but their application is just as important as the elements themselves.\nIf foundations, components, and patterns are the building blocks, then you\nneed schematics to pull it all together, which is where the following\nadditional layers of the model come in.\n\nWhen designing a mainly content-driven website (as opposed to digital products\nor apps, which I’ll address shortly), I refer to these additional layers as\n‘templates’ and ‘pages’ (fig 4.8):\n\n![](image/349.png)\n\n![](image/model-3.png)\n\nFig 4.8 The Foundations Model applied to a website\n\n\n100\n\nLet’s look at these two new layers in depth:\n\nTemplates\n\nIn digital terms, a template is a consistent layout that is used multiple\ntimes throughout a website, and are populated with different content each time\nthey’re used. Common examples of templates include an article or a blog post.\n\nConsistency in web design is important for good user experience — not just for\nstyle, but also for the way content is presented. It’s good practice to have\nas few templates as possible, so people can familiarise themselves with the\ninterface as quickly as possible. If somebody needs to keep re-learning what’s\ngoing on — where to look or click for every new template they encounter —\nthey’re highly likely to get frustrated. And frustrated customers don’t stay\ncustomers very long!\n\nUsing fewer templates is also a consideration for development, maintenance,\nand scalability. The fewer templates you use, the easier and less expensive\nthe build and maintenance will be. For example, adding a new employee profile\npage using an existing template is significantly faster and easier than\nbuilding a bespoke page for each new person you hire. Making global, sweeping\nchanges to a website is easier when you update a single template, which\nautomatically updates multiple pages. Imagine what a nightmare it would be to\nmake a global change to the New York Times or BBC websites, if each of their\narticles had a bespoke page design, as opposed to using the same, or a limited\nnumber of template(s).\n\nPages\n\nPages are essentially the final application of the design system at work.\nThey’re what your audience ultimately sees.\n\nA page is either the application of a template, or a bespoke one-off web page.\nSometimes it’s good for certain pages to differentiate and not come from a\ntemplate, such as when you need them to communicate a bespoke message or\nperform a specific function. Pages like the home page or a\n\n\nDesign system model 101\n\ncontact page are good examples of bespoke pages.\n\nFor an example of the relationship between templates and pages, consider the\ndesign system I created for Club of the Waves (fig 4.9), a website featuring\nsurf artists and photographers, each of whom has their own unique profile page\non the site. The image below shows templates (only two) in the left column,\nand pages to the right:\n\nClub of the Waves has a bespoke home page, with no template applied to it — as\nseen in the first row of the image above.\n\nThe second row shows the template for an index of profiles, and two pages (to\nthe right of it) with that template applied to them. The third row shows the\ntemplate for individual profiles, and several pages (to the right of it)\n\n![](image/354.png)\n\n![](image/cotw-template-page.png)\n\nFig 4.9 Templates vs. pages (example:\n[clubofthewaves.com](https://clubofthewaves.com))\n\nPage\n\nTemplate\n\n\n102\n\nwith that template applied to them.\n\nIn Club of the Waves’ case, there are hundreds of pages running off the one\nprofile template. It would be unrealistic to design and build a bespoke page\nfor every creative profile, and a nightmare to make global changes to each\nunique page. But with all the pages running off the one template, you need\nonly update the one template to change every page — for example, if you wanted\nto add a comments section or social sharing links to all profile pages.\n\nThe same logic applies to all aspects of a design system. For example, if you\nupdate a system component like a button, the change would be applied\neverywhere that button is used in the system. This is much easier than the\nlengthy and hazardous task of digging for and updating all of the buttons. The\nsystem at work!\n\nDesign systems in product design\n\nAs I stated before, the model’s terminology is flexible. For example, where\nthe Foundations Model terminology we’ve covered thus far — foundations,\ncomponents, patterns, templates, and pages — works best for web design, the\nfollowing terminology is arguably more appropriate for product design (fig\n4.10).\n\n‘Templates’ and ‘pages’ can be applicable to products too, but ‘features’ and\n‘screens’ are arguably more applicable terms when designing a system for a\nmore complex or dynamic digital product or app.\n\n‘User journeys’ map out the often complex interactions within a product’s\nfeatures. And ‘screens’ are snapshots in time of a product in use (i.e. a step\nin the user journey). I’ll demonstrate this using a real product in a moment,\nbut first, consider this:\n\nWebsites are often about consuming content, and only include quite simple\ninteractions like clicking a button to go to a different page, submitting a\nform, filtering a list to make a selection, or opening an accordion. Products\nand apps, on the other hand, tend to be more multi-\n\n\nDesign system model 103\n\nlayered, with interactions that can go several layers (or steps) deep.\n\nFor example, a banking product might have a ‘screen’ dynamically created and\ntailored to a specific user account, user type, and preference settings. This\nalready sets it apart from a ‘page’, because the format and content of these\ndynamic screens might have dozens of possible outcomes and resulting feature\nsets. For example, a single screen in a banking product may include the\nability to transfer money between accounts, set up a wire transfer, pay a\nbill, view statements, download data, open a new account, and so on.\n\nWhere typical patterns or templates in web design are not so complicated, each\nof our banking example’s features may require more than one or two clicks to\nset in motion. Each feature can have a multi-step ‘user journey’ to perform\ncertain tasks. In a way, you could look at features as being ‘super patterns’,\nbut that name doesn’t hold much credibility. On the surface, a feature is an\nassortment of foundations, components, and patterns — pulled together to\nperform a specific task(s). But each interactive part of a feature can go\nseveral layers deep, creating more of a user journey.\n\nTo give a more specific example, let’s say a banking product has a feature\n\n![](image/326.png)\n\n![](image/model-4.png)\n\nFig 4.10 The Foundations Model applied to product design\n\n\n104\n\nthat enables you to get directions to your local bank branch. A potential user\njourney for this feature might be:\n\nThe user clicks a button that reads: “Find your nearest bank”\n\nA modal opens where the user is asked to enter their postal/zip code\n\nUpon submit, a map is revealed showing banks near their location\n\nThe user clicks on their desired pin on the map\n\nA tooltip opens with a link to directions\n\nThe user clicks the link and is directed off-site to Google Maps\n\nAnd finally, for each of the previous steps you could have multiple success\nstates, error states, helpful tips to guide the user, micro-interactions, and\nso on.\n\nThe bottom line is: digital products are complicated! It’s vital that your\nsystem include not just all of the elements involved in the example above\n(e.g. buttons, modals, maps, pins, tooltips, etc.), but that it also maps out\nhow a feature is used — showing all of the screens that add up to the user’s\njourney. (Doing this may also reveal some opportunities to simplify the\nexperience!).\n\nTo reiterate my earlier point, despite this complexity, you still need a\nsomewhat simple model that people can get on board with. If ‘features’,\n‘screens’, and ‘user journeys’ don’t resonate with you, then re-work the model\nto work for your product and team. The main thing is not to overlook the\nvarious parts of the system that make up your products.\n\n![](image/367.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-colours.png)\n\nFig 4.11 Foundation example: colour palette\n\n\nDesign system model 105\n\nA case study of a design system at work\n\nLet’s look at the design system I created for the Adobe Portfolio product as\nan example. This product has no pages to navigate. It’s a dynamic JavaScript-\nbased user interface, where the experience is made up of multiple features and\nnumerous potential user journeys.\n\nTo demonstrate, let’s break down the Adobe Portfolio product into a few system\nelements, mapped to our model:\n\nFoundation\n\nThe example (fig 4.11) shows the brand colour palette used in the product.\n\nComponent\n\nBelow are a few examples of components in the product (fig 4.12), including\ntext inputs, checkboxes, toggles, and buttons. This is only a very limited\nview of a few components, and not all their states are shown, but\n\n![](image/371.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-components.png)\n\nFig 4.12 Component examples: assorted form components and buttons\n\n\n106\n\nnotice the components also include things like placeholder states, hover\nstates, and error states. We’ll cover this extensively later in this book.\nAlso, notice the only colours used are the colours we’ve just seen in our\nfoundations example (fig 4.11).\n\nPattern\n\nSome of the previous component examples can be seen below (fig 4.13) in a\nmodal pattern. This example pattern is called a “Panel”, which is a modal —\ncomposed mostly of components like inputs, toggles, selects, and buttons —\nused throughout the product as a consistent vehicle for performing various\nactions. The example spec shows the makeup of\n\n![](image/375.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-pattern-panel.png)\n\nFig 4.13 Pattern example: a modal pattern called a “Panel”\n\n\nDesign system model 107\n\na Panel and a couple of variations of this pattern, including the “Basic\nPanel”, “Advanced Panel” (with navigation), and “Manage Panel” (a fixed height\npanel with scrolling content).\n\nNote: It’s good practice to name your patterns. For example, our Panel\npattern’s technical name is a “modal”, but you may find additional use cases\nfor using a modal throughout a product, such as for warnings or messaging.\nIt’s far more efficient to say “Basic Panel” or “Advanced Panel” in a product\ndiscussion, a GitHub Issue, or a conversation with a developer, than it is to\nattempt to describe it: “The modal”. “Which one?”. “The one with the\nnavigation”. Instead, give it a name, document it, and use that name going\nforward. Over time people on your team will identify patterns by name, and if\nnot, your documentation is where they look to find their answer. Don’t worry,\nwe’ll cover documentation later in this book.\n\nFeature\n\nThe big difference between a pattern and a feature is their complexity. A\npattern might perform one or two functions, and can be deployed in a number of\ndifferent ways as a reusable element. A feature can perform many functions or\none specific function, and may be comprised of multiple patterns.\n\nThe example below (fig 4.14) is a spec for the “Manage Content” feature from\nthe Adobe Portfolio product, which uses the “Manage Panel” pattern (fig 4.13)\nfrom our previous example. In this case, the feature is made up of\n\n![](image/344.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-manage-content.png)\n\nFig 4.14 Feature example: a spec for a feature called “Manage Content”\n\n\n108\n\nmany foundations and components, but is using just one pattern.\n\nInteraction wise, there are many things that can be done with this “Manage\nContent” feature. Contained within the “Panel” pattern, you can drag and drop\nelements, toggle things off and on, access menus, add content, delete content,\nedit content, and so on. These specifications (or — as I call them — ‘specs’\nfor short) map out those different interactions and states.\n\nNote: You’ve seen in the previous three examples — for features, patterns, and\ncomponents — that I’ve designed and created specifications for all the various\nstates and interactions. We will cover this extensively throughout this book,\nbut for now, some friendly words of advice:\n\nWeb and product designers often fail to mock up different states of components\nand patterns or to fully consider the interactions, pitfalls, and potential\nuser journeys of the products they design. For example, designers will often\nhand over mockups of a form without showing how an input should look if\nthere’s an error, or what the submit button looks like on-hover, or what\nhappens once the form has been submitted? I say this as a designer who’s\nworked with other designers who are guilty of this, and as a frustrated\ndeveloper who has built websites (that someone else designed) where these\nthings haven’t been considered or accounted for.\n\nDon’t assume the developers will figure it out. It’s not their job, it’s the\ndesigner’s job. And especially don’t leave it to chance, and risk later\nfinding out your customers are struggling to use your product. This ambiguity\nleads to frustration, confusion, and inconsistencies in the build and user\nexperience.\n\nScreen\n\nA “screen” really highlights the difference between designing a digital\nproduct and a website. Websites (often) have a definitive set of pages, and\n\n4.1 [roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/](https://roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/)\n\n\nDesign system model 109\n\nwe know what they will look like as they are either based on a template or are\na bespoke design. Products, on the other hand, can have dynamically created\ncontent, built up of features that are tailored to the user.\n\nThe Adobe Portfolio product (4.1) we’ve been reviewing in this case study has\nno “pages”. It’s a product that people use to build personal portfolio\nwebsites for their work. No two “screens” will ever look the same — they are\nunique to the person using the product. But from a product design perspective,\nit’s still valuable to visualise what those screens could look like in order\nto stress test and design for all variables; this also allows us to give the\ndevelopers a better idea of what they’re building (in addition to our design\nsystem elements and specs).\n\nA screen is the culmination of all your foundations, components, patterns, and\nfeatures coming together. It’s a snapshot in time of someone using your\nproduct, or a step in their user journey.\n\nThe image below (fig 4.15) is a design mockup simulating a feature in use — in\nthis case, a “Colour Picker” pattern is being used to edit a “Masthead”\nfeature of the product. This is different from a traditional mockup or\n\n![](image/282.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-editor-color-2.png)\n\nFig 4.15 Screen example: a product scenario mockup\n\n\n110\n\n“page” design in web design, as it’s only showing a pattern in the context of\none part of a user’s journey. Still, it’s a useful way of depicting how your\nsystem elements will come together in the product.\n\nUser journey\n\nA user journey, strictly speaking, is not part of our design system model.\nBut, as stated before, a good product designer should map out how a product —\nor a feature of the product — could be used. There are many ways you can\nvisually convey user journeys and the specific steps a user can take. You\ncould, for example:\n\nBuild a basic prototype you can test for real.\n\nSimulate interactions in an interactive prototype using design software.\n\nCreate a still image step-by-step simulation of the product in action.\n\nMap out all the potential actions a user could take in a decision tree diagram\nor flow chart.\n\nDesign a detailed, annotated specification showing all interactions and\nstates, similar to the examples shown here (fig 4.16 \\- 4.18).\n\nThe design mockup below (fig 4.16) maps out the user journey for the\n“Background Image” feature of the Adobe Portfolio product, which uses the\n“Basic Panel” pattern (fig 4.13) we saw in our earlier example.\n\nSimilarly, the following design mockup (fig 4.17) maps out the various steps\nto using the “Add Content” feature, which uses the “Manage Panel” pattern (fig\n4.13).\n\n![](image/389.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-image-background.png)\n\nFig 4.16 User journey example: a spec showing potential user steps\n\n\nDesign system model 111\n\nAnd finally, the design mockup below (fig 4.18) maps out the potential steps a\nuser could take while using a different feature of the product, this time\nusing the “Advanced Panel” pattern (fig 4.13).\n\n![](image/394.png)\n\nFig 4.17 Annotations help to identify what’s what\n\n![](image/portfolio-add-content.png)\n\n![](image/396.png)\n\n![](image/269.png)\n\nFig 4.18 Map out the interactions and steps a user could take\n\n![](image/portfolio-navigation.png)\n\n\n112\n\nIt’s my hope that seeing how the elements of the Foundations Model came\ntogether in the Adobe Portfolio product design gave you a sense for how you\ncan adapt the model to your project. Keep in mind, you can always adapt the\nmodel to make it yours, this is just a guide to get you started.\n\nAllow for flexibility\n\nA really great design system is flexible enough to have room for creativity,\nand be effectively applied to different scenarios. The more rigid the system,\nthe more likely designers are to introduce rogue elements. This is a slippery\nslope towards the system failing, and the surest path to designers and\ndevelopers falling out.\n\nIt’s also healthy to think of and use terminology like ‘guidelines’, as\nopposed to ‘rules’. Rules feel like laws that can’t be broken. Your average\ndesigner won’t like working under these constraints, so it’s important your\nsystem is adaptable and leaves room for creativity.\n\nHowever, some system elements do benefit from being more rigid for the sake of\nconsistency, ease of navigation, user experience, or to protect the brand. For\nexample, on most websites, patterns like a ‘global navigation’ or ‘footer’\nwill likely never change as you navigate page-to-page — nor should they, as it\ncan be disruptive to the user journey and experience. Similarly, a ‘related\nitems’ pattern in an e-commerce product, or ‘related posts’ in a blog will be\nthe same design on every page (only the content changes). And foundations\nwise, sticking to a set of defined text styles and colours will\n\n![](image/367.png)\n\n![](image/cotw-buttons.png)\n\nFig 4.19 Four variants of a button component\n\n\nDesign system model 113\n\nmake for a more coherent end product and experience.\n\nIt’s also beneficial for some system elements to be adaptable — or to have\nmultiple variations — to cover different scenarios. This flexibility or\nadaptability cuts down on the need to bypass the system or go rogue, adding\nnew elements.\n\nFor example, a component like a button could come in a small and large size,\nin multiple colours, or have a solid background versus a border outline to\ncommunicate different actions or hierarchy of importance. fig 4.19 is an\nexample of different buttons from the same design system. While different,\nthey clearly belong to the same (brand) family and share similar\nspecifications and foundational characteristics.\n\nSimilarly, a component like a select could have a multi-select variant to\ncover scenarios where the user can select one or multiple options, as\ndemonstrated in fig 4.20.\n\n![](image/405.png)\n\n![](image/plasma-select.png)\n\nFig 4.20 Two variants of a select component\n\n\n114\n\nDocument the why, when, and how\n\nWe’ll cover documentation more thoroughly later in this book, but for now,\nit’s important to state: you should document guidelines, specifications, and\nuse cases for all your foundations, components, patterns, templates, and\nfeatures.\n\nDesign system documentation acts as a source of truth. By documenting the\ndesign thinking behind each element, you leave nothing to assumption or\nmisinterpretation. Demonstrating use cases is also great for guidance, as well\nas on-boarding new team members. Seeing is believing, so lead by example and\nshow your team the thinking that went into your design choices.\n\nBetter together\n\nEverything we’ve covered in this chapter highlights the importance of\nteamwork, communication, and not designing or building anything in isolation —\nfrom the terminology we use, to creating and iterating on the system elements,\nto documenting how, when, and why they’re used.\n\nMy hope is that with the Foundations Model as a guide, you’ll now have a\nsimple framework to kickstart a great design system with your team.\n\nNow that we’re all on the same page regarding the model and terminology we’ll\nuse going forward, we’re (almost) ready to start creating a design system.\n\n\nDesign system model 115\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nDesign system model 115\n\nGround your work in reality. Design for all scenarios, not just the best case\nscenarios. Don’t try to fit the content to your design. Design for the\ncontent.\n\n\n116\n\nGetting started\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n116\n\n05\n\n![](image/418.png)\n\nGett—ing star—ted\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nGetting started 117\n\nBy now, hopefully, you should understand the importance of getting your whole\nteam excited about the value of a design system, and involving everyone in the\nprocess.\n\nWe’re not ready to jump into design just yet. First, you (and your team) need\nto be clear about what your goals for creating a design system are. By doing\nthis, you are further laying the strong foundations needed to build a\nsuccessful design system and product(s).\n\nStart by identifying the problems\n\nMuch of design is problem-solving. So, first things first, you and your team\nneed to investigate: what problems are you solving?\n\nAs tempting as it is to see design systems as a vanity project, your goal\nisn’t — or shouldn’t be, entirely — to create something beautiful. If you get\neverything else right, you will probably end up with something beautiful, but\ndon’t race to the finish line — it’s more of a marathon than a sprint.\nCreating a design system is a large investment of time, by a lot of people, so\nyou need a good set of reasons for doing it. And those reasons (or problems)\nwill help you identify a way forward, your priorities, and which approach to\ncreating a design system is best for your company, product, and team.\n\nConsider this quote from Nick Stamas (5.1), my former colleague I mentioned in\nthe “Selling a Design System” chapter of this book, as he reflected on the\nbeginning of a journey that led to creating a design system:\n\n“The first app I opened when we started wasn’t Sketch. It was Google Docs. You\nneed to clearly articulate the problems first. Be specific. Where are things\nbreaking down? Where are the biggest pain points? A design system doesn’t\nexist in a vacuum, it needs to solve problems for everyone.”\n\nStart by involving your whole team — designers, developers, and product\n\n\n118\n\nmanagers — in an open and frank discussion about where people feel the product\nor the team’s processes are going wrong. Depending on the size of your team,\nand locations of the people working on your product(s), you could get\neverybody together, or break into smaller groups, and have team leaders meet\nto discuss their findings. Document everything you discuss in a Google Doc (or\nsomething similar), so you can easily share it with the whole group.\n\nSystem design is a team effort, so work as a team. Make everyone feel like\ntheir opinion is important, and their voice is heard. The easiest way to get\npeople to believe in the system is to involve them.\n\nWhen you discuss your problems as a team, you’ll also have a better\nunderstanding of the extent of the work that needs to be done. You may find\nyou already have the basis of a design system that’s just gone a little astray\nover time, and it may not require much work to consolidate the design and\ncode, document it, and grow from there.\n\nA designer might look at a problem and think: “we’re screwed, let’s just start\nagain!”, but a developer might look at the same problem and think: “actually,\nif we do X then we’ll be okay”. And vice versa. This is why it’s valuable to\nget everyone’s perspective.\n\nThe goal here, ultimately, is to find the common pain points in everything\nfrom the product, design and build processes, team culture, and user feedback.\n\nFor example, some broader takeaways from this discussion could be things like:\n\nDevelopers hate it when designers reinvent the wheel.\n\nProduct managers want to ship updates and new features faster.\n\nDesigners are sick of the build not looking like their mockups.\n\nOur users are frustrated by X, Y, Z.\n\n5.1 [nickstamas.com](https://nickstamas.com/)\n\n\nGetting started 119\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nGetting started 119\n\nThe first app I opened when we started wasn’t Sketch. It was Google Docs. You\nneed to clearly articulate the problems you’re solving first.\n\n\n120\n\nYou’re probably familiar with at least one of these frustrations… It’s pretty\ncommon stuff, and all issues that design systems can help fix.\n\nMore specific takeaways could be things like:\n\nWhy do we have 13 different colours in the product?\n\nWe want to explore a better way of doing X.\n\nHow can we improve conversion on this form?\n\nWe need a consistent set of buttons.\n\nOur icons have no consistent style.\n\nWe want to clear time to refactor the code.\n\nWe want to introduce more animation in the product.\n\nWe need a consistent set of design components to work with.\n\nOnce you know what the problems are, you’re better prepared to come up with a\nplan of attack for solving them.\n\nNote: Much of the above pre-supposes you’re working on an existing product.\nBut even if you’re launching a brand new company or product, it’s still worth\nidentifying what you want to achieve, and the problems your product and design\nsystem aims to address. Also, identifying within your team the problems that\npeople have faced in the past — and the potential issues that could arise\ngoing forward — can provide valuable insights you can use to set your new work\nup for success.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nThe multi-million dollar question! There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Now\nyou’ve identified the problems, you have to decide what to do about them.\nChances are, if you’re having discussions like this in the first place, you’ve\nmore or less already decided — you’re going to create a design system. Now,\nthe harder part is deciding how to go about it.\n\nLooking at this simplistically , there are two approaches you can take:\n\n\nGetting started 121\n\nThe iterative approach\n\nThe wholesale approach\n\nThe next two chapters are dedicated to these approaches, but before we go into\ndetail about the process for each, I want to explain in brief what they are.\n\nThe iterative approach\n\nThe iterative approach is the process of gradually replacing what you have now\nwith a new system. Or, if this is a new product, it’s the process of launching\nthe product in stages (i.e. more of a soft launch, as opposed to a hard\nlaunch). If you are working on an existing product, this could mean\nconsolidating what you have currently, then gradually replacing what you have\nwith something new. This process happens iteratively — so foundation by\nfoundation, component by component, pattern by pattern, feature by feature,\ntemplate by template, and so on.\n\nRemember back in the chapter on “Laying the Foundations” when I talked about\ncreating a scaffolding and gradually remodeling, as opposed to demolishing\nwhat you have and starting from scratch? That’s what you’re doing with an\niterative approach.\n\nWith this approach, you start by conducting visual and code audits (we’ll\ncover this in the next chapter) to discover the problem areas, and iteratively\nfix them. You focus on small areas of the product at a time, gradually working\nyour way through the whole product — designing, building, and documenting a\ndesign system as you go.\n\nThis approach can be disruptive to the product’s user experience and\naesthetic, but less disruptive to your business and roadmap. It can also be a\nfrustrating process, as progress can be slow.\n\nThe advantage to the iterative approach is that you’re able to start small and\ntackle your biggest pain points first. This might bring some immediate relief\nto a more immediate problem, such as a user experience problem, a process\nproblem, or a sticking point for designers and developers on your team.\n\n\n122\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n122\n\nAn iterative approach might only bring small wins at first — but a small win\ncan make a huge difference to a product’s user experience, and your team\nculture.\n\n\nGetting started 123\n\nStarting with the iterative approach might only bring small wins at first —\nbut a small win can make a huge difference to a product’s user experience, and\nyour team culture. A positive start can have a profound impact on an\norganisation’s positivity towards — and belief in — a design system as a\nworthwhile investment of their time going forward. This proved effective at\nGitHub (5.2), who said of their design system process:\n\n“Tackling our biggest pain points and working on tasks that provided high\nvalue to designers and developers, helped us start to build recognition and\nshow the value of design systems.”\n\nWe’ll delve more into the iterative approach in the next chapter, but for now\nit’s worth considering if this might be the best way for your team to start\ncreating a design system. Alternatively, you could try:\n\nThe wholesale approach\n\nThe wholesale approach is essentially starting from scratch — either because\nyou’re designing a new product without any existing systems in place, or\nbecause you’ve decided to tear down what you have and start again.\n\nTaking a wrecking ball to your existing design is arguably a more extreme\noption, but it has its advantages. You avoid the potential ‘Frankenstein\nMonster problem’ of the iterative approach, which could protect your brand and\nuser experience. Changes will be widespread and coherent, as opposed to the\n‘bitty’ experience that can happen when things are tweaked iteratively. Also,\nyou’ll ultimately launch with a beautiful new product, which could be a great\nmarketing opportunity!\n\nHowever, a big undertaking like this could be more disruptive to your\nbusiness. It’s likely any roadmap of new feature releases or improvements will\nmore or less be put on hold while you undertake a redesign. This is why it’s\nimportant to involve product managers and other business stakeholders in\ndesign system talks, as well as designers and developers. For example, someone\noutside the design and development teams could easily say: “if it ain’t broke,\ndon’t fix it” — so to sell them on a wholesale\n\n\n124\n\nredesign, you’ll need to convince them of just how broken things are.\n\nIf you’re considering condemning your current design and building something\nnew, be prepared to answer the following questions:\n\nWill redesigning solve a business problem?\n\nHas your research shown that your users are unhappy?\n\nIs your product underperforming on certain metrics?\n\nAre you rebranding to reach a new audience?\n\nDoes your brand need to evolve in line with its growth?\n\nOr are your designers just bored? (Joking, not joking).\n\nBe smart about which approach you choose\n\nA totally new design might look great in your portfolio, a Medium article, or\na Dribbble post, but it might also have a negative affect on your business.\nYour customers come first, so don’t lose sight of what affect your new design\nsystem might have on their behaviour and their retention.\n\nThink about websites like Amazon, which has largely looked the same for years.\nGiven their enormous wealth, one would think they could easily afford a huge\nwholesale redesign. Instead, Amazon employs more of an iterative approach.\nThey refine and test different design changes over time. Their product and\ndesign system evolves, but the user doesn’t always notice. There’s a very good\nreason why companies like Amazon don’t take a wholesale approach, as the\nunknown factor of how their customers will respond to a radical redesign is\nfar too great a risk.\n\nA wholesale redesign is a gamble — it could make or break your business. Take\nSnapchat’s 2018 redesign, which Vanity Fair described as “cataclysmic” (5.3).\nMore than 1.25 million people signed a petition urging Snap to undo their\nupdate, they lost 2% of their daily active users (some 3 million users), and\ntheir stock price bombed! I can only imagine how bad\n\n5.2 [medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542](https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542)\n\n5.3 [vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/snapchat-publishers-discover-\nredesign](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/snapchat-publishers-\ndiscover-redesign)\n\n\nGetting started 125\n\nthose days were for their product teams.\n\nThe risk of taking the wholesale approach is especially high for e-commerce\nwebsites and digital consumer products that people frequently use; it’s less\nof an issue for marketing based websites or products with lower repeat\nvisitors. Humans are creatures of habit — we don’t always like change.\n\nAn iterative approach is less disruptive and therefore can be safer, but\nsometimes a wholesale brand refresh can have a positive effect — look at\nbrands like Airbnb, whose new design system and accompanying redesign (circa\n2016?) set a new standard for iOS app design, and helped them continue to grow\nas a successful business. You need to weigh up your options, and their\npotential risks and rewards.\n\nChoices, choices\n\nIt very much depends on the size and complexity of your product, team, and\naudience — as well as the nature of your brand — as to which approach is\nbetter, more expensive, disruptive, time-consuming, or worthwhile.\n\nBoth approaches divert from business-as-usual tasks. While an iterative\napproach can be undertaken largely under the radar and requires less\nstakeholder support, a wholesale approach will require more serious buy-in\nfrom multiple stakeholders, as it will suck up a lot of resources, and\narguably carries greater risk.\n\nAs you read through the following two chapters — delving more into each of the\niterative and wholesale approaches — you’ll no doubt conclude there are common\nelements to both, and you’d be correct. The word “holistic” is an important\ntheme and consideration in both approaches, which we’ll explore. The answer\nfor your company might not be to adopt one approach or the other, but to apply\nlessons from both approaches. In fact, I would recommend doing a mix of the\ntwo!\n\nLet’s start by looking at the iterative approach.\n\n\n126\n\nAn iterative approach\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n126\n\n06\n\n![](image/450.png)\n\nAniter—ative app—roach\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nAn iterative approach 127\n\nWith this approach, you start by conducting visual and code audits to discover\nthe problem areas. Next, focus on small areas of the product at a time,\ngradually working your way through the whole product — re-designing, building,\nand documenting a design system as you go.\n\nWhile this is more of a piecemeal approach, it is still important to not lose\nsight of the design holistically — to consider how everything will work\ntogether.\n\nFind your team\n\nYou’re not going to get far on your own. Find designers who are excited about\nmaking the best product! Find engineers who seem most excited about the idea\nof a system — or the front-end code — and make them your new best friends!\n\nIn 2017, at a design system meetup in New York City, I watched as Diana\nMounter (6.1) — a design system lead at GitHub — talked about how in the early\ndays of creating the Primer design system (6.2), they formed a small task\nforce who met regularly to discuss, discover, and plan to solve problem areas.\nThey reviewed code. They took action on making incremental improvements,\nconsolidating their system, and making the system more accessible to their\ndesign team.\n\nDiana’s article, Design Systems at GitHub (6.3), is an excellent insight into\ndesign systems:\n\n“There weren’t obvious underlying systems connecting all the pieces together.\nI knew things could be better and I was enthusiastic about making improvements\n— I quickly discovered I wasn’t the only one that felt this way. There were\nseveral folks working on efforts to improve things, but weren’t working\ntogether. With support from design leads, a group of us started to meet\nregularly to discuss improvements and prioritize work — this was the beginning\nof the design systems team.”\n\n\n128\n\nOnce you’ve found your team: a good way to get going is to conduct interface\naudits.\n\nInterface audits\n\n‘Interface audit’ is a term with potentially different definitions. So for the\nsake of clarity — in this book — consider that:\n\nAn ‘interface audit’ is a broad term for conducting audits on a digital\nproduct.\n\nA ‘visual audit’ is a design-based audit of what you can see in a digital\nproduct, focussed on foundations, components, and patterns.\n\nYou could focus the scope of a visual audit, and do only a ‘pattern audit’ or\na ‘component audit’.\n\nA ‘code audit’ is an audit of what you can’t see, but what makes everything\nwork behind the scenes: CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and so on.\n\nA ‘colour audit’ takes stock of colours used across all digital properties.\n\nA ‘content audit’ maps out what you’re communicating and where.\n\nEssentially, an ‘audit’ is whatever you need it to be. It’s an investigation,\nand a great starting point that leads to larger discussions, actions, or\nprojects.\n\nColour audits\n\nYou might be surprised by how many rogue colours you have in your product, but\nthe good news is, this is one of the simplest things to action.\n\nFirst, you need to do a colour audit of all websites and products at\n\n6.1 [broccolini.net](http://broccolini.net/)\n\n6.2 [primer.style](https://primer.style/css)/css\n\n6.3 [medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542](https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542)\n\n6.4 [uxdesign.cc/hipmunk-design-system-part-1-colors-ux-case-\nstudy-1ac99806aabd](https://uxdesign.cc/hipmunk-design-system-part-1-colors-\nux-case-study-1ac99806aabd)\n\n\nAn iterative approach 129\n\nyour company. Take note of every unique colour used for text, links,\nbackgrounds, form inputs, buttons, error states, borders, and so on. If you\nhave more than one website, create a different colour palette for each website\n— it might prove interesting to see the comparison.\n\nAs an extreme example, a colour audit conducted by Hipmunk (6.4) discovered an\nalarming amount of colours used in their product:\n\nTheir colour audit (fig 6.1) led to them creating a stripped-down, clearer,\nand on-brand semantic colour system (fig 6.2):\n\nNote the use of the number “500” (e.g. $hipred-500) in Hipmunk’s new colour\npalette (above). We’ll come back to what this means and why it’s important in\nthe “Systematising the Design” chapter, when we cover naming conventions and\ncreating colour systems.\n\n![](image/459.png)\n\nFig 6.2 Hipmunk’s new colour palette created post-audit\n\n![](image/hipmunk-3.png)\n\n![](image/461.png)\n\n![](image/hipmunk-2.png)\n\nFig 6.1 Colour audit of Hipmunk’s product\n\n\n130\n\nBelow (fig 6.3) is a small sample from a real colour audit I conducted at a\ncompany. The example colours shown here are to demonstrate the discrepancies,\nwhich in this case were very similar variants of the same colours:\n\nOnce you have your audit results — you need to get to the bottom of:\n\nWhy are we using each colour?\n\nWhat (if any) function does each colour provide?\n\nDo we need multiple variants of the same colour?\n\nWhich colours can we safely remove, and what do we replace them with?\n\nIt’s wise to take stock of why a colour is used. Consider whether the colours\nyou find in an audit were used intentionally (and serve an important\nfunction), or whether they were used unintentionally (and can be changed).\n\nWhen we clean our example up — removing the rogue colours — we end up with a\ncondensed, on-brand colour palette like so (fig 6.4):\n\n![](image/465.png)\n\nFig 6.3 Colour audit reveals very similar colours used\n\n![](image/audit-colour-1.png)\n\n![](image/467.png)\n\nFig 6.4 New on-brand colour palette removing unnecessary colours\n\n![](image/audit-colour-2.png)\n\n\nAn iterative approach 131\n\nNow you need to work with a front-end developer to make these changes in the\ncode. If you’re working with a website, this is the perfect opportunity to\nintroduce Sass variables for colours (work with a developer for this). Create\nSass variables for all the correct brand colours you’ve defined, paying\nattention to how you name the colours.\n\nWe’ll cover naming conventions and why replacing static hex values (e.g.\n#F00658) in your code with Sass variables is a good idea later in the\n“Systematising the Design” chapter.\n\nFinally, pair a designer with a developer and go through the website,\nreplacing all hex value colours with the correct Sass variable (colour). You\ncould do a ‘fast and dirty’ find and replace, but it’s probably safer to\n‘eyeball it’, going page-by-page and scenario-by-scenario.\n\nCode audits\n\nWe’re not going to go too deep into code audits in this book since we’re\nfocussed more on design, but suffice it to say they are important. The\nefficiency of the code is key to a design system’s success — and to the ease,\nspeed, efficiency, consistency, maintenance, and scalability of a digital\nproduct.\n\nSometimes, the code harbours many of the problems. If you’ve worked in-house\nat a company with any history of digital, you’ve no doubt come across the\nphrase ‘legacy problems’. This often refers to legacy (old) code that makes\nupdating something problematic (read: painful). The problems may stem from\ndesign — perhaps designers have gone rogue designing several variants of the\nsame thing — but the code holds the key to fixing them. Refactoring the code\n(reducing complexity) makes all the difference, and a code audit is a great\nway to kickstart that refactoring effort.\n\nAt GitHub, their designers and developers worked together to audit (6.5),\nrefactor, and consolidate their design system, focussing on their code:\n\n“We reduced the need for people to have to write new CSS. We made our\ncomponents easier to reuse in multiple locations. We\n\n\n132\n\nworked on consolidating patterns by reducing code repetition and removing\nunnecessary design variations. We defined global Sass variables for shared\nsystem styles. We introduced consistent and easy-to-internalize naming\nconventions.”\n\n“Sass” is a key word here. If you’re not already familiar with it, Google it.\nSpeak to your developers about it. It’s a way of writing and compiling CSS\nthat will make your code much easier to manage.\n\nBesides the code, I even introduced Sass naming conventions into the design\nand design documentation at a previous job — bridging the gap between design\nand engineering. Any way you can find to do this is a good idea. We’ll cover\nthis later in the “Systematising the Design” chapter.\n\nExperience has taught me that visual audits and their resulting plans of\naction, often dovetail into or spur subsequent code audits in the execution to\nfix the visual problem. Your teams might divide and conquer — running both\nvisual and code audits simultaneously — or start with one or the other, and\nwork from there. It very much depends on the nature of your teams and the\nproblems you’re solving.\n\nVisual audits\n\nA visual audit (aka ‘interface inventory’) is a means of finding\ninconsistencies in a digital product. You scan through a product and create an\ninventory of all aspects of the visual interface, identifying where the\nproblems are, and scoping out the extent of the problem.\n\nWith this information, you can plan to fix any smaller issues in the short\nterm, and formulate plans for fixing larger issues in the long term.\n\nThey also provide you with excellent material to sell your design system work\nto stakeholders — referring back to the “Selling a Design System”\n\n6.5 [medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542](https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542)\n\n\nAn iterative approach 133\n\nchapter — since they highlight why you need a design system!\n\nHow do you conduct a visual audit?\n\nThis can easily be a one-person job, but I would recommend using this as an\nawareness and ‘togetherness’ exercise by working as a group.\n\nCreate a small task force of people who care most about the front-end. The\nteam could all be designers, or you could involve developers and product\nmanagers as well (so long as they are more ‘visually oriented’ people — it’s\nimportant they take the audit seriously, so nothing slips through the cracks).\n\nCall a meeting and introduce the audit as an exercise to find inconsistencies\nin your product, which will ultimately help you to design and build a more\nconsistent product.\n\nStart by creating a list of every feature, page, screen, user journey, and\nscenario in your product. Then divide that list up amongst the group, with\neach person taking ownership for their part of the product(s)/audit.\n\nAgree on a place to store your findings. It should be accessible by everyone;\nI recommend a Google Doc or a design tool like Sketch, but there are a number\nof online collaboration tools you could use. You could also use something like\nKeynote. It will be easier if you agree on a consistent format for cataloguing\nand organising your findings. Ideally, create a template for your team to use.\n\nThe task of each auditor is to document what they see. So for every page,\nscreen, or user journey: take a screenshot of each button, header style, text\nstyle, link, form input, toggle, pagination, tooltip, quote, product card,\ntable, header, footer, navigation, and so on — and organise them by category\n(e.g. buttons, text links, header styles, etc.).\n\nThe goal here is not to capture (screenshot) every instance of an element, but\nto capture each unique variant of it. So, don’t capture 10 instances of the\nexact same header style. Instead, if you find that 4 of those 10 header styles\nare a different font family, weight, size, colour, sentence case versus\n\n\n134\n\ntitle case, all caps, or underlined — then capture each of those variants. Do\nthe same for all foundations, components, and patterns. Pay close attention to\nthings like size, spacing, colour, text styling, border-radius, drop-shadows,\nand icons. And don’t forget things like hover states and error states.\n\nOrganisation is key. For example, you want to end up with a view of how many\nbutton styles you have in your product, but it may also help to know where in\nthe product you found each button style, so you can go back and address it\nlater.\n\nYou should end up with a mass inventory of all existing foundations,\ncomponents, and patterns in your product, and all of their variations.\n\nFinally, schedule a time to meet again at a later date, as a group, to share\nand discuss what the team found.\n\nThe results may shock you\n\nIf you’re shocked, this is a good thing. The first step towards solving a\nproblem is admitting (or seeing) there is a problem. Chances are you’ve\nalready done that by forming this task force in the first place. You’re aware\nof the inconsistencies in your product, and you want to prove to others that\nthey exist. The audit(s) will uncover these inconsistencies — and that’s only\nthe surface layer, what lies beneath (aka the code) may well be a lot worse!\n\nSeeing the number of variations side-by-side is a powerful realisation of the\nstate of your product, and an indication of how much work lies ahead. A visual\naudit can help recruit people to your cause, convince stakeholders that\nsomething needs to be done, and acts as a blueprint to create a design system.\n\nWeb developer/designer, Brad Frost (6.6) puts it well:\n\n“It’s not to say that deviating from established patterns is always a bad\nidea, but it’s important to recognize the difference between intentional and\nunintentional deviation. An interface inventory\n\n\nAn iterative approach 135\n\nhelps expose unintentional inconsistencies and encourages consistent,\ndeliberate design decisions.”\n\nWhat now?\n\nNow, your team needs to plan what to do about the inconsistencies you’ve\nfound.\n\nInterface audits are a valuable addition to your pitch to stakeholders for why\nyou need to invest in a design system. As I said before, seeing is believing.\nYou can show your stakeholders the extent of the problem, and explain why\nthese inconsistencies matter, or you can take a more direct approach, and take\naction now.\n\nPrincipally you need to work with your task force to consolidate the\nvariations you found. By task force, I mean: designers and developers working\ntogether to fix the inconsistencies, and documenting the definitive solutions\nyou decide upon.\n\nThis is where it helps to include front-end developers in your task force, or\nat least bring them into the fold once you’ve completed the visual audit. You\nwon’t get far without developers, or at least not without access to the code\nto make the changes yourself (yes, I’m suggesting designers could write code).\n\nResearch, consolidate, and document\n\nA visual audit I was once a part of uncovered 26 different styles of buttons\nin a single product. A subsequent code audit revealed an array of different\nclasses, colour variations, and naming conventions for the same and similar\nbuttons. It was a mess.\n\nThe goal is not to just eradicate all the variations you find. You need to\nreplace them with something, and the answer might not be to replace 26\n\n6.6 [bradfrost.com](http://bradfrost.com/)\n\n\n136\n\nwith 1\\. In this case, we dug a little deeper into the audit, analysing the 26\nstyles of buttons; we asked ourselves:\n\nAre the variants random, or intentional?\n\nWhere, when, and how are they used?\n\nWhat are their different functions?\n\nChances are you’ll find more than one use of the component, but I’ll wager you\nwon’t find more than a few. Trending patterns will emerge. Actions like:\n‘Save’, ‘Submit’, ‘Get Started’, ‘Sign Up’, ‘Buy Now’, and ‘Subscribe’ may\ndiffer in function, prominence, or importance from actions like: ‘Edit’,\n‘Cancel’, ‘Read More’, and ‘Close’. Take stock of these different functions in\nyour audits and decision-making.\n\nYour visual audit helps you to uncover not only how many variants you have,\nbut potentially why you have those variations. Sometimes it’s just bad design,\nor proof for why you need a design system. Other times you’ll discover a\nlegitimate need for variations — like multiple button styles for different\nactions, or additional text styles to cover specific scenarios.\n\nNow that you’ve uncovered and debated these findings, you can consolidate\nthose 26 button styles into 1, 2, 3, or more styles that cover all the\nscenarios you’ve identified. Ending up with something like\n\nthis (fig 6.5).\n\nNote the naming conventions. Names like “Primary”, “Secondary”, and “Tertiary”\n(for example), make it easier to identify your defined system components —\nkeeping everyone on the same page and speaking the same language. Your naming\nconventions should be consistently used in the design, code, documentation,\nand any product discussions.\n\nThe documentation should also specify why you have these variations:\n\nHow, where, when, and why should you use each variant?\n\n\nAn iterative approach 137\n\nThe code should also be documented:\n\nHow does one apply each component, and their variants, in the code?\n\nDocumentation is a source of truth that reduces the chance of these multiple\nrogue variations happening in the first place. We’ll cover design system\ndocumentation in greater detail later in this book, but for now know it’s a\nkey step not to be overlooked.\n\nOnce you’ve consolidated, designed, and documented your component — work with\na developer to build your new component and all its variants. And once it’s\nbuilt you’ll need to work through the product and replace all the rogue\nvariants with your new, consistent component. Your audit might help you to do\nthis if you’ve already identified where they occur in the product.\n\n![](image/486.png)\n\n![](image/plasma-secondary-button.png)\n\n![](image/plasma-tertiary-button.png)\n\nPrimary button\n\nTertiary button\n\nSecondary button\n\n![](image/plasma-primary-button.png)\n\nFig 6.5 Different states of button components\n\n\n138\n\nManaging the workload\n\nNow, let’s not kid ourselves… The iterative approach will no doubt be executed\nover a great period of time — working in sprints — but, ultimately, it will be\nworth the wait.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with sprints: it’s common practice for in-house design\nand development teams to work in short pre-defined sprints, focussing on\ncompleting a limited (achievable) number of tasks in each sprint. Some\ncompanies even group their sprints by quarter (of the year), aiming to achieve\nspecific goals at key stages throughout the year. Sprint and quarterly\nachievements can be good for keeping tabs on, encouraging, and reporting the\nprogress of your design system, which helps to keep stakeholders happy.\n\nOne of the advantages of the iterative approach is that it can be done\nalongside business-as-usual tasks. I recommend advocating for allotting a\ncertain percentage of time in each sprint to focus on the design system. If\nyou’ve done a good job selling the system, advocating for its importance, and\ngaining support from product managers, developers, and designers, then this\nshould be no issue.\n\nThe order in which you approach the system — iteratively — is unique to your\nsituation.\n\nYou could focus by order of importance. For example, focus on a problem area\nbased on its affect on the user experience, the severity of the problem it’s\nsolving, or even its impact on your team’s happiness or productivity! Tackling\nthe system by order of importance can be smart, as you (or rather, your\nstakeholders) might see a more immediate impact — gaining your design system\nmore support and traction.\n\nOr you could focus by level of disruption. For example, introducing\nfoundational elements like colours and text styles will likely be less\ndisruptive than, say, introducing a new pattern that’s more noticeably\ndifferent from its surrounding patterns. I advise starting small with colours\nand text styles, then move up in scale and disruption (i.e. noticeability by\nthe user) to components like buttons and inputs, and\n\n\nAn iterative approach 139\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nAn iterative approach 139\n\nA jigsaw puzzle starts as a whole picture before it’s broken down into pieces.\nYou’d have a terrible puzzle if you designed the pieces first, then later\ndiscovered they don’t fit together!\n\n\n140\n\neventually to larger patterns like navigation, cards, galleries, footer, and\nso on.\n\nIn time your product will gradually morph into a new look product, powered by\na design system.\n\nThe Frankenstein monster effect\n\nWhile designing iteratively has many advantages, it’s easy to lose sight of\nthe product or brand as a whole. Without careful management, it can lead to an\nunfortunate ‘Frankenstein monster’ effect.\n\nLet’s step back for a second. It’s not as simple as just taking an ‘iterative’\nor a ‘wholesale’ approach. You must consider the design and brand as a whole,\ncoherent piece. A system without harmony isn’t much of a system.\n\nA jigsaw puzzle starts as a whole picture before it’s broken down into pieces.\nYou’d have a terrible puzzle if you designed the pieces first, then later\ndiscovered they don’t fit together!\n\nDon’t create design system elements in isolation, then attempt to fit them\ntogether in a product. Think about the product as a whole — as an experience.\n\nRefinement vs. exploration\n\nBased on a concept from the book, Sketching User Experiences by Bill Buxton —\nthe following graphic (fig 6.6) beautifully illustrates a good point to keep\nin mind when approaching a design system iteratively. Focussing on refining\nwhat you have now — or changing your current design one piece at a time — can\nblind you to the best solution.\n\nWhen we design holistically, exploring many alternative solutions, we’re\n\n6.7 [intercom.com/blog/two-product-principles-often-\nforgotten/](https://www.intercom.com/blog/two-product-principles-often-\nforgotten/)\n\n\nAn iterative approach 141\n\nmore likely to discover an optimal solution. Then we can refine from there.\n\nTo quote from an article (6.7) by Des Traynor, co-founder of Intercom:\n\n“Iterating until something is ‘not obviously broken’ doesn’t guarantee a good\nproduct. You can iterate your way to lots of places, including mediocrity.”\n\nThe iterative approach has many advantages, as we’ve covered in this chapter.\nHowever, if you take the iterative approach, don’t focus only on refinement,\nor work with too narrow a focus. Take time to explore each problem area first,\nthen refine. Don’t bypass the opportunity for design exploration altogether.\n\nThe wholesale approach centers more on design exploration and holistic design.\nLet’s look at this approach next.\n\n![](image/502.png)\n\n![](image/refine-explore.png)\n\nFig 6.6 Refinement vs. exploration\n\n\n142\n\nA wholesale approach\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n142\n\n07\n\n![](image/509.png)\n\nAwhole—sale app—roach\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nA wholesale approach 143\n\nThe wholesale approach ideally should start in a similar way to the iterative\napproach we covered earlier: by identifying the problems you’re trying to\nsolve. A little user and product research wouldn’t hurt either, but we can\nonly cover so much ground in this book! So, we’re going to assume that you’re\nclued up, you’ve identified that a redesign would be a good move for your\nbusiness, and you have a good idea of the problems you’re trying to solve.\n\nOkay, now you’re ready for design exploration!\n\nGround your work in reality\n\nIf you’re creating a design system for an existing product, then use real\nscenarios from that product(s). Don’t design with convenient content — for\nexample, don’t design using uniformly short names, or headlines that\nconveniently only use four words. Use real (or realistic) content, and use\nunruly content too! Let’s be honest, if you’ve been designing for awhile then\nyou know what some clients are capable of when it comes to content. Is your\nbeautiful, Dribbble-shot-perfect layout with a large font size and three-word\nheadline going to work when the client adds a 10-word headline? Use\nunreasonably long (and short) titles. Use awkwardly lengthy words that break\nthe width of content areas. Discover the pitfalls in your design and create\nsomething responsive that works in the real world, not just in your\nidealistic, perfect design mockup.\n\nDesign for all scenarios, not just the best case scenarios. Don’t try to fit\nthe content to your design. Design for the content.\n\nIf you’re creating a design system for a new product with no existing content,\nyou still have to design with content in mind. Use a close approximation, or\nwork with a content strategist, copywriter, or user experience expert to get\nas close as possible to the final content you’ll be using in the product.\n\nThe goal here is not to create the prettiest system, it’s to design a system\nthat best meets your product, user, and business needs. We do, of course, set\nout to create delightful products, but only because delight\n\n\n144\n\ncan enhance the user experience.\n\nHave fun with it\n\nGet your team together. Let your designers flex their muscles. Collaborate,\nbut let your designers express their individual creativity too — they’re on\nyour team for a reason, right? Go far and wide. Explore every angle, style,\nlayout, and approach for potential new design directions for your product. Be\ncreative. Chisel away and simplify until you discover the right style, form,\nand function.\n\nIf you’ve already established Digital Foundations — as we covered in an\nearlier chapter — or your company has brand guidelines — then use them as a\nNorth Star, so to speak. If your company has no brand guidelines of any\ndescription, then these design explorations will help you discover, flesh out,\nand document your brand!\n\nDesign process, systematisation, and documentation\n\nAs you discover, refine, and arrive at a style and voice that speaks to your\nbrand and solves problems for your product, a design system — or at least a\nconsistent visual language — will start to emerge.\n\nOnce this consistent visual language emerges, the task now is to document the\ndesign system elements you’ve created, accounting for all states and scenarios\n. Document your design thinking. How, where, when, and why should you apply\nthe foundations, components, and patterns you’ve created?\n\nEssentially, you’re creating a comprehensive style guide for your team to use.\nThink of it as a blueprint for designing products at your company.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the design exploration phase of the wholesale\n\n7.1 [medium.com/@andrewcouldwell/plasma-design-\nsystem-4d63fb6c1afc](https://medium.com/owl-studios/plasma-design-\nsystem-4d63fb6c1afc)\n\n7.2 [airbnb.design/building-a-visual-\nlanguage/](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)\n\n7.3 [karrisaarinen.com](https://karrisaarinen.com/)\n\n\nA wholesale approach 145\n\napproach and its progression towards a design system, you can read my case\nstudy (7.1), which gives a detailed account of the process described here.\n\nBuilding a visual language\n\nI recommend reading an article (7.2) by Karri Saarinen (7.3), a principal\ndesigner on the Airbnb design team, titled, Building a Visual Language.\n\nThere are three things worth noting about Airbnb’s approach. Firstly, and\ninterestingly: the Airbnb design team use terms like: “Design Visual Language”\nand “Design Language System,” instead of: “Design System”.\n\nA language is more than words, it’s about communication. Yes, “system” and\n“language” essentially mean the same thing in this case, but psychologically,\nperhaps the term ‘language’ is less intimidating to a designer than ‘system’?\nFor whatever reason, they’ve decided to use terminology that works best for\ntheir team.\n\nI think Airbnb’s philosophy is a healthy one. Anyone who’s travelled knows how\nimportant language is for communicating effectively and clearly, and how wrong\nit can go when we don’t speak the same language. This is a good philosophy to\nbring into system design thinking. Whatever terms and naming conventions you\ndecide to use — just make sure you’re using a language your team identifies\nwith. The more comfortable they are with it, the more successful it will be.\n\nSecondly, to quote from the Airbnb article (7.2):\n\n“We started by auditing and printing out many of our designs, both old and\nnew. Laying the flows side by side on a board, we could see where and how the\nexperiences were breaking, and where we needed to start making changes.”\n\nAn important thing to note here is that they focussed on product flows and the\nuser experience. They didn’t focus on small, siloed areas of\n\n\n146\n\nthe interface, or component parts that make up their products. They\ncontemplated their product as a whole, as an “experience”.\n\nAlso, they used real product scenarios. Grounding your work in reality, using\nreal data and scenarios is key. Don’t work with ideals, best case scenarios,\nand convenient content. Work with what you’ve got — and design a system that\nworks for it — but keep it flexible enough to evolve and account for more than\nyou have now.\n\nOur goal here is not to create the prettiest system. It’s to create a flexible\nsystem that solves problems, and also delivers a great user experience.\n\nThirdly: remember when we talked about Digital Foundations earlier in this\nbook? Well, Airbnb thinks about their brand and products in a similar way.\n\nPrior to their ‘Design Language System’ project, Airbnb’s design team had\nalready defined their equivalent of Digital Foundations by establishing\ncolour, typography, and spacing (fig 7.1). The exercise now was to build a\ndesign system upon those foundations:\n\n![](image/282.png)\n\n![](image/foundations-airbnb.png)\n\nFig 7.1 Airbnb’s foundations\n\n\nA wholesale approach 147\n\n“The foundation proved essential for guiding our work in a unified direction\nwhile allowing room for us to individually explore creative design solutions.\nThis way we felt that we were all working together, towards the same idea.”\n\nThis is great! Their foundations — remember: Digital Foundations are brand\nguidelines, not a design system in itself — helped them work better as a team,\nand their designers retained their individual creativity, which is very\nimportant to designers!\n\n“Reviewing our collective work at the end of each day, we began to see\npatterns emerge. We course-corrected when necessary, and started defining our\nstandardized components.”\n\nAirbnb took a holistic approach to create a visual language that worked for\ntheir product. They reviewed their work as a team, and their design\nexplorations gradually led to patterns and components emerging throughout the\nprocess — ultimately forming their design system.\n\nBuild and launch plans\n\nNow, the really tricky part. With your system effectively designed (with the\nwholesale approach), you have a hard decision to make:\n\nDo you build everything behind the scenes, and launch when it’s ready?\n\nOr do you build and introduce the system iteratively over time?\n\nBrands we associate with high standards for how their brand is executed — like\nNike or Apple — are more likely to take the first approach. It would be\ndamaging to their brand perception to release anything too short of the final\nproduct.\n\nOn the other hand, smaller businesses that aren’t under the microscope as much\nas bigger brands can afford a more iterative approach, since their\n\n\n148\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n148\n\nThe goal is not to create the prettiest system, get more likes on Dribbble, or\nimpress your friends — it’s to design a system that best meets your product,\nuser, and business needs.\n\n\nA wholesale approach 149\n\nchanges are more likely to go unnoticed, or at least, won’t light up Twitter!\n\nIt’s important to factor in whether your business can afford to — or if your\ncustomers/target audience are willing to — wait several months or a year\n(plus) for you to design, build, and launch a perfect end product. Time-\nsensitive companies like startups are less likely to have the luxury of doing\nmonths of design and build work followed by a big reveal, due to their limited\nfunds and need to prove themselves a worthwhile and profitable company in a\nvery short timespan. Often times — dependending on the product and industry —\nthe smart thing to do is to get something out there, test the water, and\niterate to find a market fit.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be perfect\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to how you build and launch a website or\ndigital product. You have to do what’s best for your product, team, and\nbusiness. And remember: it doesn’t have to be perfect.\n\nDesign is a process. It takes time. However, building the system (i.e.\ndevelopment) is the lion’s share of the work! If you spend too long perfecting\nthe system on the design side you’ll never launch anything!\n\nYou might not get it right the first time, so consider getting to an MVP\n(minimum viable product) — or a beta launch phase — as fast as possible. This\nway you can soft launch to a limited subset of people, discover any problems,\niterate, refine, and improve before launching to everybody. Let’s look at an\nexample:\n\nWholesale design, and an iterative build and launch\n\nEarlier I mentioned it isn’t always as simple as taking either the iterative\napproach or the wholesale approach; you can combine the two. For example, when\nI worked at Behance (7.4) on the Adobe Portfolio (7.5) product (fig 7.2) — we\ntook a wholesale approach to the design and (most of the) build of the\nproduct, but the launch (and the remainder of the build) was iterative.\n\n\n150\n\nFor context: the new Adobe Portfolio product was replacing an existing product\n(Behance ProSite). A decision had been made not to iteratively evolve the\nexisting product, but to start again with a new product (i.e. a wholesale\napproach). There was nothing iterative about this redesign; it was very much\nan ‘out with the old, in with the new’ wholesale approach. We were creating a\nnew code infrastructure, a new design, and a new brand.\n\nMonths of design exploration and system design work ensued before anything\nsubstantial was built. Once the design was reasonably progressed, I started\nfeeding the developers things to build as fast as I could — starting small\nwith system components, and working up to patterns and product features.\n\nBuilding and launching a product of this size and scope was never going to be\neasy. We knew what we were creating was ambitious, complicated,\n\n7.4 [behance.net](https://www.behance.net/)\n\n7.5 [roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/](https://roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/)\n\n![](image/282.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-panel.png)\n\nFig 7.2 Design mockup from the Adobe Portfolio product\n\n\nA wholesale approach 151\n\nand multifaceted. On the one hand, we had a potential target audience (of\nmillions of people) to impress and convert to paying customers. And on the\nother hand, we owed it to our existing product users to keep them happy while\n— as seamlessly as possible — transitioning them over to the new product.\n\nAchieving the above with a ‘hard launch’ would probably have proven futile,\nespecially for a company the size of Adobe. Instead, after months of build\nwork we arrived at an MVP (minimum viable product) version of the product. It\nwas basic, it didn’t include all the features, and it was a little buggy — but\nit was enough to start getting valuable feedback, user testing, and bug\nreports.\n\nWe did several phased Beta releases of the product over time. Each release\nopened up the product to more people, building towards an ‘official’ launch\nsome months later.\n\nWe learned a lot from this beta phase. We especially learned that people\ndidn’t always use the product the way we anticipated they would! But that’s\nokay. It was better to learn these things in a beta phase — with\nhundreds/thousands of users — than later with thousands/millions of users.\nPeople were also more forgiving about the limited feature set and bugs in the\nproduct because in our marketing we set the expectation that they were using a\n‘work in progress’ version of the product.\n\nThe disruption factor\n\nAn important factor you should consider when deciding whether to go for the\n‘big reveal’ approach to launching a new system — versus an iterative\ntransition — is the effect it will have on your users.\n\nFor example, think about digital productivity products you use on a daily\nbasis... I mean meticulously use — they’re mission-critical to your job. For\nsome professions, CRM (customer relationship management) products are a great\nexample of this kind of product. An experienced CRM product user could be so\nfamiliar with that product’s user interface, they could almost operate it in\ntheir sleep. Now consider what happens when they\n\n\n152\n\nlog in one morning, and — poof! — there’s a totally new-look product. Suddenly\ntheir day-to-day tasks aren’t so easy, fast, or efficient. You could go from a\nsatisfied user base to a frustrated one overnight (remember the Snapchat\nexample in the “Getting Started” chapter). You might even lose those customers\n— considering your product likely isn’t their only option.\n\nRolling out a design system, responsibly\n\nBig changes to products that are used daily — or frequently — can be hugely\ndisruptive to your customers’ lives and/or businesses. Not to mention the near\nimpossible task of managing anything that goes wrong with a large launch or\nupdate across so many touchpoints. The support requests alone would cripple\nsome community support and product teams.\n\nFor these kinds of products (or use cases), it might be better to take it\nslow.\n\nMinimise disruption to the user by subtly integrating foundations, components,\nand patterns in sprints. You can scale up, evolve, and improve the look and\nexperience of a product over time — building sustainably towards the full\ndesign system integration.\n\nAnother advantage of this is that you can manage user feedback more\nefficiently. Feedback inline with specific system updates allows you to refine\nand improve on the design system in more targeted and manageable sprints, as\nopposed to being overwhelmed by feedback on the system at large.\n\nThe disadvantage is it can be frustrating integrating a system in stages. From\na designer/developer perspective, you just want to see ‘your baby’ out in the\nworld. It can feel like an eternity watching your ugly duckling slowly evolve\ninto a swan.\n\nThe key is not to cause too much frustration at the user’s end. In any form of\ndesign: meeting people’s basic expectations will keep them satisfied, and\ndelighting them is an experience to strive for. It’s crucial to get the\n\n\nA wholesale approach 153\n\nbasics right. That’s what your users care most about. Keep this in mind when\nrolling out your design system.\n\nNow that you’ve learned the pros and cons of the wholesale and iterative\napproaches, you can make a more informed decision about the most suitable plan\nof attack for creating and deploying a design system at your company. Do you\ntake:\n\nA wholesale approach to the design, build, and launch?\n\nAn iterative approach to the design, build, and launch?\n\nA wholesale approach to the design, then iteratively build and launch?\n\nA wholesale approach to the design and build, then iteratively launch?\n\nWhichever path(s) you go down for creating your product(s) and brand’s visual\nlanguage, you don’t want all that hard work to go to waste. You need to\nsafeguard the design decisions you’ve made, and put systems and processes in\nplace to protect the brand and visual language you’ve created. The next couple\nof chapters teach you how to do just that. We’ll also cover how to level up as\ndesigners and design teams by systematising our designs, and creating robust,\nefficient, accessible, and scalable design systems!\n\n\n154\n\nSystematising the design\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n154\n\n08\n\n![](image/547.png)\n\nSys—temat—ising the design\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nSystematising the design 155\n\nDesigning and building a design system is all very well and good, but your\ndesign team’s continued adoption of the system is the key to its success.\n\nIt’s important your design team:\n\nCan easily access and design with it.\n\nUnderstand how to design with it.\n\nMaintain and iterate on it (i.e. the design and code stay in sync).\n\nWe’ll look at points 2 and 3 in later chapters. In this chapter, we’ll focus\non point 1: Ease of access and use.\n\nSet the system up for success\n\nAll the design exploration, pretty style guides, Digital Foundations,\ndocumentation, and goodwill in the world won’t help unless your design team\nactually uses your design system and doesn’t fight it.\n\nI’ve seen this first-hand: there’s a design system in place, yet individuals\non a design team continue to serve up new text styles, buttons, and inputs in\ntheir mockups. It’s frustrating. It creates unrest in the team. Developers get\nfrustrated that designers still aren’t using consistent components. And the\nsystem gradually falls into decay.\n\nSometimes, there are legitimate reasons to introduce new styles, or new\nvariants on existing foundations, components, patterns, templates, or\nfeatures. We call this ‘intentional design’, and it’s fine, as long as you\ndocument the system changes accordingly. But the problem I’m talking about\ncomes from ‘unintentional design’.\n\nLet’s give the designer who introduces new system elements the benefit of the\ndoubt. Perhaps they didn’t mean to create a new image gallery when there’s\nalready a perfectly good image gallery designed, built, and ready to deploy.\n\n\n156\n\nPerhaps they unintentionally deviated from the established pattern.\n\nPerhaps they’re proposing adding a conditional variation to the pattern.\n\nOr perhaps they are proposing a new and improved pattern.\n\nIf it’s the latter (2 or 3), you should discuss the proposed iteration as a\nteam. If it’s the former (1), then you have a problem. An avoidable problem.\n\nYou need a design system library\n\nIf your design system foundations, components, and patterns are easy to access\nand use, you’ll be less likely to have the problem of unintentional design.\nThink of this collection of design system assets as your ‘design library’.\n\nHere’s a quote from the Airbnb design team (8.1) talking about their design\nlibrary:\n\n“We collected them [design system components] in a master file called the\nlibrary, which we referred to throughout the design process. After a week or\ntwo, we began to see huge leaps in productivity by using the library when\niterating on designs. One day, while putting together a last-minute prototype,\nour team was able to create nearly 50 screens within just a few hours by using\nthe framework our library provided.”\n\nI’ve seen designers create buttons by drawing a rectangle, changing the\ncolour, adding a border-radius, adding some text, and styling the text how\nthey feel like it. They do the same for text input, selects, and so on. The\ndevelopers build the design mockup they’re given, creating new, one-off\ncomponents and non-reusable CSS each time. Is it any wonder some websites and\nproducts have so many different styles when designers work like this? There is\na better way.\n\n8.1 [airbnb.design/building-a-visual-\nlanguage/](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)\n\n\nSystematising the design 157\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nSystematising the design 157\n\nAfter a week or two we saw huge leaps in productivity by using the library\nwhen iterating on designs. One day our team was able to create nearly 50\nscreens within just a few hours.\n\n\n158\n\nIf this were a presentation, I’d now do a live demo. I’d open up a blank\nSketch canvas and create a simple form in a matter of seconds by using an\nexample library of design system components. Anytime I’ve done this it’s wowed\nthe audience. But this is no magic trick — it’s just good design system\nmanagement.\n\nBy creating a library of things like text styles, colours, form inputs, and\nbuttons — that anyone on your team can easily access and use in their designs\n— you reduce the likelihood of unintentional design.\n\nUltimately, your aim is to create a master design system (“library”) file — or\nsource of truth — that your whole team can easily access and sync any updates\nmade to it. This file (or whatever form it takes) becomes your design library.\n\nThe library should contain reusable elements from your design system that you\ncommonly use in your design mockups, such as text styles, form inputs, and\nbuttons. It should also include all their variations and states (e.g. a text\ninput’s placeholder, value, hover, error, and disabled states).\n\nIdeally, any changes you make to the master design library file should sync to\nyour design files, keeping your design mockups in sync with the system. It’s\nnot perfect, but you’re essentially trying to simulate a built environment\n(e.g. Sass, CSS, HTML, JS, React) in a design tool.\n\nThe idea is your design team can insert any of these elements into their\ndesign mockups. Of course these elements need to be editable, but within\nconsistent parameters. For example, if you have two buttons in your design\nsystem — a blue button and a green button — the designer should easily be able\nto choose between blue and green, but not make it pink. The data/text\ncontent/value also needs to be editable, which means your components need to\nbe responsive so they will work with variable amounts of content.\n\nConstraints are not a bad thing\n\nWhen we talk about using design libraries, we are essentially talking\n\n\nSystematising the design 159\n\nabout setting ‘constraints’ for designers, but this shouldn’t be viewed as a\nnegative.\n\nPre-made components and pre-defined text styles only help designers do their\njob. It’s important that designers on your team understand this, and don’t\nview design systems as taking away — or restricting — their creative freedom.\n\nFor example, you can design something like a form very quickly — even in\nseconds — using a library of pre-made components like inputs, selects, radio\nbuttons, and buttons. This is much faster than meticulously creating each\ncomponent from scratch (risking unintentional variations), or copying and\npasting components from one design file to another.\n\nThe constraints a design library puts in place help maintain consistency, and\nvastly increases speed and efficiency.\n\nFreeing designers from re-creating the same foundations, components, and\npatterns over and over again allows them to focus on more important things,\nlike creating or iterating on features, flows, and user experiences.\n\nTools for the job\n\nI stated at the start of this book that it would be futile to dive too much\ninto the technology side of design systems in print. Design tools evolve so\nfast that the words I freeze in time in this book may no longer apply by the\ntime you read this. With that said, I don’t want to leave you empty-handed, so\nI’ll talk a little about design tools to consider.\n\nWhere Photoshop was once the industry standard for web designers, the need for\na vector based, dynamic, and specialist user interface design tool became\nclear circa 2015(-ish). There are now a host of options out there! Below is a\nbrief introduction to just a few of them, and there are more up-to-date\nresources and links on this book’s website (8.2).\n\n8.2\n[designsystemfoundations.com/resources/](https://designsystemfoundations.com/resources/)\n\n\n160\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n160\n\nFreeing designers from re-creating the same design elements over and over\nagain allows them to focus on more important things, like iteration, new\nfeatures, and user experience.\n\n\nSystematising the design 161\n\nIn the beginning of this revolution of new design tools, Sketch (8.3) quickly\nrose to fame as the popular choice for web and product designers. Sketch’s\ntext styles and responsive, nested symbols (for editable, reusable components)\n— paired with Sketch Library (8.4) — are superb for working with and managing\na design library. This is the design toolset I’ve used since 2016 for web\ndesign and to create design systems that power large design teams and entire\nsuites of products, so I can speak first-hand to its excellent performance.\n\nI’ve also created a Skillshare class (8.5) showing how I currently (at the\ntime of this book’s publication) set up symbols in a design library in Sketch.\n\nWhile I have no experience using the following design tools, I’ve heard good\nthings:\n\nFramer X (8.6) is a design tool doing amazing things to bridge the gap between\ndesign and code. You can create interactive, animated, reusable components.\nYou can even design with React components from production (i.e. your real\nproduct).\n\nAdobe XD (8.7) is a design tool to keep an eye on. It’s been in a work in\nprogress for sometime now, but they have a great team working on it and its\nprogression is encouraging.\n\nFor something different, Figma (8.8) is a browser-based design tool (not\nsoftware) that allows multiple designers (and other stakeholders) to work\nsimultaneously on a design.\n\nAnd then there are designers who consider any code editor to be a design\n\n8.3 [sketch.com](https://www.sketch.com/)\n\n8.4 [sketch.com/docs/libraries/](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/)\n\n8.5 [skl.sh/2xWBObZ](http://skl.sh/2xWBObZ)\n\n8.6 [framer.com](https://www.framer.com/)\n\n8.7 [adobe.com/products/xd.html](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)\n\n8.8 [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/)\n\n\n162\n\ntool — using production code, ‘sandbox’ test environments, designing in the\nbrowser, and prototyping with ‘real’ (built) components. I count myself among\nthose designers — I love to iterate on responsive designs and animations live\nin the browser, to really hone the design and user experience.\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m not here to tell you what tools to use. They’re\njust tools. It’s up to you to discover which processes and tools work best for\nyour team’s preferences, comfort, skill sets, and aptitudes. And it’s probably\na good idea to agree on one tool, which your whole team uses — so you avoid\ndifferent versions of the same design system elements being created and used\nin different software!\n\nNaming conventions\n\nAs I’ve mentioned before, naming conventions are important in design systems.\nEach text style, colour, component, and pattern in your design system should\nhave a unique name, and it’s important that the name you use in your design\nlibrary, matches the code and the documentation.\n\nThe idea is this: if you state the name of a text style, colour, component, or\npattern in a design mockup — or in a product discussion — then the other\npeople on your team (designers, developers, and product managers) should\neither know exactly what you’re referring to, or be able to look it up in your\ndocumentation (aka the source of truth).\n\nIt helps to be systematic about your naming conventions. It seems boring, but\nfor example, naming text styles “Title 1” through “Title 5” (reducing in size\nthe larger the number) is a lot easier to understand than naming them\nsomething like “Daisy” or “Yosemite”. While it might be fun to come up with\nhumorous or descriptive names for system elements — your naming conventions\nneed to make sense to more people than just you and your friends on your team.\nThey need to resonate with the whole team, new people onboarding to the team,\nand semantically make sense in the code.\n\n\nSystematising the design 163\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nSystematising the design 163\n\nDon’t get caught up in the ‘which tool is better’ design saga. They’re just\ntools! Dicover which tools work best for your team’s preferences, comfort,\nskill sets, and aptitudes.\n\n\n164\n\n![](image/579.png)\n\n164\n\n![](image/naming-text-styles.png)\n\nFig 8.1 Text styles with semantic names from\n[clubofthewaves.com](https://clubofthewaves.com)\n\n\nSystematising the design 165\n\nThe example (fig 8.1) from the Club of the Waves website demonstrates simple\nand semantic naming conventions for foundational text styles.\n\nIt also helps if your naming conventions are scalable. As digital products\nevolve, new scenarios call for new foundational elements (like colours and\ntext styles), or new components and patterns. If you have a colour named\n“Ocean Blue”, what happens when you need to add a second blue, or a lighter\nshade of the same blue? Do you then have “Ocean Blue”, “Lighter Ocean Blue”,\n“Winter Blue”, “Sky Blue”, and so on? You need a more semantic (i.e. logical)\napproach to naming.\n\nFor example, following a colour audit of their website, Hipmunk (8.9)\ndiscovered they were not only using a wide array of colours for warnings and\nerrors, but the names they had given these colours were likely contributing to\nso many new colours being introduced. Below (fig 8.2) is a sample of what\ntheir audit discovered:\n\nA name like “Alert Red” works on its own — it’s clear to designers and\ndevelopers what the colour’s intent is. However, if you also have “Warning\nRed”, “Warning Pink”, and “Hip Error” — like Hipmunk do — then you have a\nproblem.\n\nLater in this chapter, we’ll look at how to create and name a system of\n\n![](image/583.png)\n\nFig 8.2 A colour audit reveals none semantic names and rogue colours\n\n![](image/hipmunk.png)\n\n8.9 [uxdesign.cc/hipmunk-design-system-part-1-colors-ux-case-\nstudy-1ac99806aabd](https://uxdesign.cc/hipmunk-design-system-part-1-colors-\nux-case-study-1ac99806aabd)\n\n\n166\n\ncolours using a similar approach to Google Material (8.10), who created a\nrange of colours based off one brand colour. Something like this (fig 8.3):\n\nNote their numeric naming conventions. The higher the number, the darker the\ncolour.\n\n“The Material Design color system uses an organized approach to applying color\nto your UI. Dark and light variants of each color can then be applied to your\nUI in different ways. The variants help create a color theme that is\nharmonious, ensuring accessible text, and distinguishing UI elements and\nsurfaces from one another.”\n\nYou don’t have to assign numeric values to make naming conventions\n\n![](image/588.png)\n\n![](image/docs-material-2.png)\n\nFig 8.3 Light and dark variants generated from a base colour\n\n\nSystematising the design 167\n\nwork, but you do need some logic in place. In stark contrast to Google\nMaterial, OpenTable (8.11) name their two primary brand colours “Early Girl”\nand “Blueberry” (fig 8.4):\n\nOn their own they are arguably confusing, but they make more sense when you\nsee them in the context of their secondary brand colours (fig 8.5). Their\nprimary brand colour, “Blueberry” is blue, but they also have two colours\nnamed “Blue” and “Teal” in their secondary palette.\n\nYou can certainly argue OpenTable are walking a fine line, semantically, but\nin this case, their use of a ‘human’ name for their brand primary colours is\nfitting to their brand ethos. It would get messy if they named all their\ncolours so randomly, but confining the quirky names to the primary\n\n![](image/205.png)\n\n![](image/docs-opentable-3.png)\n\nFig 8.4 OpenTable’s colour system documentation\n\n8.10 [material.io/design/color/the-color-\nsystem.html](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html)\n\n8.11 [brand.opentable.com/color/](http://brand.opentable.com/color/)\n\n\n168\n\nbrand colours, then using more distinctive naming conventions for their other\ncolours, creates just enough distinction for it to work.\n\nWe’ll cover the logic behind OpenTable’s use of colour more in the next\nchapter.\n\nColour system\n\nColour is tricky. It’s easy to say: “Our brand colours are X, Y, and Z. Only\nuse these colours.” But then, with such a limited colour palette, what do you\nuse for a hover state? What do you use to communicate an error? If you want to\ncreate a subtle differential in content using a background colour, what do you\nuse?\n\nA colour audit I conducted at a previous job uncovered several different\nshades of the ‘same’ colour. The actual brand colour had been lost over time.\n\nWe’ve all done it. You ‘need’ a new colour. You open up your colour picker and\ndrag the picker slightly up/down/left/right, picking the colour that\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\nFig 8.5 Primary and secondary colour palettes and their use cases\n\n![](image/docs-opentable-7.png)\n\n\nSystematising the design 169\n\nfeels right. This is ‘fine’ for one-off website projects, but not for a team\nof designers working on the same product(s). If other designers on your team\ndo the same — picking random colours, multiple times, in different scenarios —\nover time, this results in numerous hex values (e.g. #b85c35) in your CSS,\nused erratically and inconsistently throughout your product. Not very\nsystematic, is it?\n\nI advise you to look at colours as a system within a system. Think about these\nthings, relating to colour:\n\nYour brand identity: the core colours of your brand.\n\nHeaders and copy: typically dark text on a light background.\n\nScenarios like navigation, links, errors, and success states.\n\nBackgrounds and subtle deviations in background colours.\n\nTo combat designers picking random colours, I advise your design system\ninclude a range of colours to cover these brand and digital content scenarios.\nThis is where Sass — which we discussed briefly in the “Code Audits” section\nof “An Iterative Approach” chapter — can be a game-changer. For the non-\ndevelopers: think of Sass as an advanced form of CSS. It allows us to — among\nother things — systematically create new colours. We can take a base colour\nand darken it by 10%, lighten it by 10%, or adjust it by any percentage we\nlike.\n\nP.S. Don’t worry if you don’t know Sass. Work with a developer. It won’t be\nhard for a front-end developer to spin this up for you. You can also use an\nonline Sass colour generator (8.12) to get the color values you need. And if\nyou want to learn Sass, I recommend the book, Sass for Web Designers (8.13) by\nDan Cederholm (8.14). This is the book I bought and worked through when I\nfirst learned Sass.\n\n8.12 [scg.ar-ch.org](http://scg.ar-ch.org/)\n\n8.13 [abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-\ndesigners](https://abookapart.com/products/sass-for-web-designers)\n\n8.14 [simplebits.com](http://simplebits.com/)\n\n\n170\n\nDecide on a base colour for each (brand) colour in your system. For example,\nyour base colour for blue could be: #62a5d7. From that base colour, use Sass\nto create a range of colours based on that value, like so (fig 8.6):\n\nIn the example above, note the two base colours in the middle of both ranges:\n“$blue50” and “$red50”. For each base colour I’ve created three darker\nvariants by darkening the colour in 10% increments, and three lighter variants\nby lightening the colour in 10% increments.\n\nA colour system like this makes it easy to choose colours for different\nscenarios without the need to introduce new, rogue colours and code. For\nexample, from our colour system pictured above, you might choose $red50 as the\nbackground colour for a button, and choose $red60 as the hover state, like so\n(fig 8.7).\n\nThe great thing about this Sass colour system is its scalability. This process\ncan be applied to any brand colour, creating a versatile range of colours with\nminimal effort. Best of all: if you change a brand colour, you\n\n![](image/604.png)\n\n![](image/systematising-colour.png)\n\nFig 8.6 Sass generated colour sytsem\n\n\nSystematising the design 171\n\nneed only change the one base colour and all other colours in that range will\nupdate automatically in your Sass!\n\nNaming colours\n\nAs we discussed at the beginning of this chapter, the naming conventions you\nuse for colours should be the same in the design and code. If a designer says\nto use the “red30” colour, then the developer should know what they mean and\neasily be able to apply that colour.\n\nIt might seem extreme, but to avoid any conflict in this area, I like to name\ncolours (exactly) the same as they appear in the code, as Sass variables.\nAnything you can do to bridge the gap between design and engineering is a\npositive.\n\nLet’s break this naming convention down:\n\nFirstly: in the code, Sass variables are preceded by a “$”.\n\nSecondly: assigning a numeric value to each colour in your range — from light\nto dark — avoids any confusion around vague terminology like “darker” or\n“lighter”. I advise starting at something like 50 (or 100), to avoid negative\nnumbers. In our example:\n\n“50” is always the base colour.\n\n“60” is darker, “70” is darker still, then “80”.\n\n“40” is lighter, “30” is lighter still, then “20”.\n\nI use two digits, as opposed to one (e.g. 50 instead of 5), so you have the\n\n![](image/608.png)\n\n![](image/systematising-colour-buttons.png)\n\nFig 8.7 Colour system at work with different button states\n\n\n172\n\nflexibility to add as great a range of colours as you need. For example, you\ncould later decide to go in 5% increments — instead of 10% — like in the\nfollowing example (fig 8.8), adding a $blue55 between the $blue50 and $blue60\ncolours:\n\nI would recommend not having too great a range (of colour variants) in your\ncolour system. Remember the constraints we talked about earlier —\n\n![](image/612.png)\n\n![](image/systematising-colour-range.png)\n\nFig 8.8 Sass generated colour sytsem\n\n\nSystematising the design 173\n\nconstraints can be a good thing.\n\nTry it for yourself\n\nYou can access and edit the Sass colour system used in our example on CodePen\n(8.15). Access the CodePen link, then go ahead and change the hex value (e.g.\n#62a5d7) of one of the three Sass variables (e.g. $blue50) and see what\nhappens. You can also use this code to create your own colour system!\n\nGuidelines for colour\n\nAnother good point to consider when defining a colour palette for your brand\nare the use cases and intent of each colour. Rather than having a mass palette\nof colours that can be used in any number of ways, it’s smart to define colour\ngroups, like for example, ‘Primary’, ‘Secondary’, ‘Utility’, ‘Accent’,\n‘Tertiary’, and so on. Let’s unpack what I mean by this:\n\nPrimary brand colours\n\nPrimary brand colours are arguably the most important. They are typically the\ncore colours that make up your brand. For example, EE’s\n\n![](image/344.png)\n\nFig 8.9 Distinctive primary colours of two different brands\n\n![](image/colour-brands.png)\n\n8.15 [codepen.io/roomfive/pen/ybYQZP](https://codepen.io/roomfive/pen/ybYQZP)\n\n\n174\n\nprimary brand colours are aqua and yellow (fig 8.9), where Coca-Cola’s are red\nand white. Primary brand colours tend to be used for prominent elements like\ncalls to action and backgrounds. They may also be used for large headers, but\nare less likely to be used for copy (if only for their accessibility). For\nexample the yellow in EE’s brand (fig 8.9), used for copy text, wouldn’t be\nlegible on a white background.\n\nUtility colours\n\nUtility colours tend to be colours like black and shades of gray. They are\nused for copy and headers. They pair well and contrast with the primary\ncolours, to create distinction and hierarchy. Keep accessibility in mind when\ndefining utility colours, making sure any grayscale colours you use for copy\nare legible on a light background colour.\n\nSecondary, tertiary, or accent colours\n\nAny other colours in your palette — in addition to primary and utility — are\nmore of a ‘supporting cast’. Secondary, tertiary, accent — or whatever you\ncall them — colours should be used less frequently than your core primary and\nutility colours. These colours can be functional, like red for warnings or\ngreen for success. Or they can be complementary, giving you greater\nflexibility in your designs for things like background colours, for example.\n\nLimited text styles\n\nMoving on from colour. You should explore a wide variety of scenarios to\ndiscover the different text styles needed in your product. Aim to consistently\nuse a limited number of text styles, and only create new text styles when you\nneed them. You probably don’t need that many.\n\nI would aim for only a few header styles, and a few copy styles.\n\nDepending on your brand and use cases of your design system, you may want to\nkeep the application of these text styles flexible, or document\n\n8.16 [roomfive.net/plasma-design-system/](https://roomfive.net/plasma-design-\nsystem/)\n\n\nSystematising the design 175\n\nspecific use cases for each style. For example, a specific header style might\nbe so large and imposing that the documentation instructs limited and specific\nuse cases for it. Take the example below, from the Plasma design system\n(8.16). This particular text style is so large, it’s only intended (and\ndocumented) use cases are in the two patterns below (fig 8.10):\n\n![](image/241.png)\n\n![](image/plasma-hero.png)\n\nFig 8.10 Two patterns using the same text style\n\n![](image/plasma-alert-overlay.png)\n\n\n176\n\nSimilarly, a larger copy style might be intended only for opening paragraphs\nof copy or used to distinguish quotes. You might have a text style intended to\nbe the default text style for all body copy in articles, blog posts, web\npages, and so on. And a particularly small copy style might be limited to use\ncases like captions, footnotes, and warnings.\n\nImportantly, you should document any formatting guidelines for each text\nstyle. If your team doesn’t understand the significance of, or logic behind\neach text style, then how do you expect them to apply them correctly?\n\nTake the example above (fig 8.11). Looking only at three text styles from this\ndesign system, the following guidelines apply:\n\nHeaders should never end with a period (“.”).\n\nAll header styles except ‘Title 1’ should be sentence case (with the exception\nof names of places and people).\n\n![](image/628.png)\n\n![](image/text-styles.png)\n\nFig 8.11 Text styles from [clubofthewaves.com](https://clubofthewaves.com)\n\n\nSystematising the design 177\n\n‘Title 1’ should always be lowercase.\n\nEditable components\n\nEstablishing a shared library of editable components is key to unlocking the\nspeed, ease, and efficiency design systems can bring to the design process.\nI’m talking about designers being able to:\n\nEasily and quickly insert pre-made components into their designs.\n\nEdit the component’s content.\n\nSwitch between its different states (we’ll cover those next).\n\nSync any updates made to the component (we’ll cover this in the “Maintaining a\nDesign System” chapter).\n\nPerhaps most importantly, a library of editable components practically removes\nany chance of designers deviating from the established system components, as\nyou can control what is and isn’t editable about each component. So for a\nbutton: you want designers on your team to be able to edit the text on the\nbutton, but you don’t want them to edit the font family, font weight, font\nsize, font colour, background colour, border-radius, height, and so on.\n\nIt’s important to lock down the design of components in a shared library,\nhowever, if you do want to edit one instance of a component, some design tools\nmake it easy to do so. For example, Sketch symbols (8.17) allow you to set\noverrides for specific parts of a component (e.g. you can edit just the text,\nor the icon and the text).\n\nContinuing with our Sketch symbols example: as well as being editable, symbols\nare also responsive, and are intended to be reused multiple times in your\ndesign mockups. The idea is that you edit the master symbol in one place, and\nyour change is applied in every instance the symbol is used! This can be\nreally powerful in designs where a component is used\n\n8.17 [sketch.com/docs/symbols/](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/)\n\n\n178\n\ndozens of times in different mockups, artboards, and scenarios.\n\nThe screenshot below (fig 8.12) shows a symbol with the Overrides panel open\nto the right of the screen. The example shows that I can only edit the text\n(“View photographer”) and nothing else about this particular button component:\n\nI would love to show you how powerful a design library of system components\ncan be, but it’s hard to do so in print. So I’ve created a Skillshare class\n(8.18) showing how I currently (at the time of this book’s publication) set up\neditable, responsive, and syncable symbols in Sketch.\n\nCover all states of components\n\nYour design system and library should include all possible states for each\ncomponent. For example, a button might have a normal, hover, and\n\n![](image/326.png)\n\n![](image/screen-sketch-symbol.png)\n\nFig 8.12 Editable symbol with overrides in Sketch\n\n8.18 [skl.sh/2xWBObZ](http://skl.sh/2xWBObZ)\n\n\nSystematising the design 179\n\ndisabled state. The image above (fig 8.13) shows three states for the same\nbutton component — its normal, hover, and disabled states.\n\nAside from obvious states like a button’s hover state, or a text input’s\nplaceholder and value states — remember that all or most of your system\ncomponents will likely have different states to cover a wide variety of\nproduct interactions and scenarios. For example, components like radio buttons\nand checkboxes come in ‘checked’ and ‘unchecked’ states. They can also be\ngrouped by ‘fieldset’, requiring a ‘legend’ to make sense of what the options\nare (for accessibility and a good user experience).\n\nBelow (fig 8.14) is an example of design system documentation for radio\nbuttons, with a visual demonstrating the different states, and text\n\n![](image/641.png)\n\n![](image/docs-plasma-8.png)\n\nFig 8.14 [plasma.guide/form-specs/](http://plasma.guide/form-specs/)\n\n![](image/643.png)\n\n![](image/components-button-states.png)\n\nFig 8.13 Colour system at work with different button states\n\n\n180\n\nexplaining the what, why, where, and when of using this component. The\ncomponents seen in this visual (fig 8.14) are all easily accessible by the\nteam working with this design system — which the Skillshare class (8.18)\nmentioned earlier covers how to create and setup.\n\nProviding your designers with easy access to these different states, types,\nand groupings of components (plus documentation) is a real timesaver, and\nensures consistent systematic design. It also removes the guesswork for\ndevelopers; if you fail to define the styles for these alternate states, they\nmay go rogue and invent their own, sometimes with less than desirable results.\n\nPattern library\n\nCreating a library of established patterns can be as valuable as a component\nlibrary. For example, if you’re creating a new template (or page) for a\nwebsite, chances are that web page will use the same global footer (pattern)\nas the rest of your website. Creating an easily accessible (and insertable)\nfooter pattern will save your design team a lot of time, and avoid any\nconfusion on the development side.\n\nThe following image (fig 8.15) is an example of a responsive footer pattern —\nready and easily accessible to drop into any design mockups.\n\nResponsive design\n\nI’ve always tried to encourage responsive design with visual design teams I’ve\nworked with. Your design library can help with this. At the time of writing\nthis, design tools like Sketch are brilliant for creating responsive\ncomponents, but not so great for (some) responsive patterns. Patterns are more\nsusceptible to things like content wrapping, variable heights, and stacking of\ncontent (e.g. 3 columns on desktop become 1 column on mobile).\n\nIf the design tool you use can’t effectively achieve a responsive pattern,\nthen your design library should at least cover how the pattern appears at\ndifferent browser widths or device sizes. For example, see how the pattern\n\n\nSystematising the design 181\n\nbelow (fig 8.15) and the following example pattern (fig 8.16) respond at three\ndifferent browser widths:\n\nHaving responsive, established design system patterns like the example above,\ndesigned and ready to easily drop into future design mockups is a valuable\ntimesaver, and ensures your design team don’t recreate them — slightly\ndifferent each time — introducing unintentional amendments to the code, or\nrogue elements being introduced.\n\nDesign tokens and Sass variables\n\nThis is one of the rare points in this book where we’ll cover a more code-\nfocussed topic. While the execution of design tokens and Sass variables is\n\n![](image/648.png)\n\n![](image/systematising-patterns.png)\n\nFig 8.15 A responsive pattern ready to insert into design mockups\n\n\n182\n\na task for a developer, and very much a code-based thing, they are based on\nsystematic design decisions (made by designers). So let’s cover it — that way\nyou can sound super smart when you ask developers about it! ;)\n\nAs this is a project that requires designers and developers working\n\n![](image/241.png)\n\n![](image/systematising-patterns-2.png)\n\nFig 8.16 A responsive pattern from\n[clubofthewaves.com](https://clubofthewaves.com)\n\n\nSystematising the design 183\n\ntogether, my advice is to strike up a conversation with the developer(s) on\nyour team that cares most about the front-end, and ask them about creating\nSass variables and design tokens.\n\nWe talked about Sass variables relating to colour earlier in this chapter.\nSass variables are a valuable asset in design systems. They are snippets of\ncode used repeatedly throughout a code base, but controlled from one central\nsource. If you change a Sass variable or design token at the source, it will\nchange everywhere it is used!\n\nIn the words of Salesforce’s Lightning design system:\n\n![](image/648.png)\n\n![](image/docs-lightning-1.png)\n\nFig 8.17 [lightningdesignsystem.com/design-\ntokens/](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)\n\n\n184\n\n“Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system —\nspecifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We\nuse them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel\nvalues for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual\nsystem for UI development.”\n\nThe Lightning design system’s documentation has an entire page dedicated to\nits design tokens, categorised by their function. The screenshot (fig 8.17)\nshows their design tokens relating to colour.\n\nDesign tokens are very similar to Sass variables, in that they are\n(ultimately) snippets of code used repeatedly throughout a product, controlled\nfrom one central source. Sass variables and design tokens can work\nharmoniously together to give you a great deal of control over the system at\nlarge.\n\nThe difference between a Sass variable and a design token\n\nA Sass variable is a generic, reusable value — it can be applied in a great\nnumber of different scenarios. For example, it could be a brand colour, which\ncan be applied to anything from headers to copy, backgrounds, links, buttons,\nicons, and so on.\n\nA design token is a more specific value, but it’s also reusable. A design\ntoken can serve specific purposes, like specifying:\n\nSection colours\n\nBackground colours for use in specific scenarios or patterns\n\nSmall spacing, versus large spacing\n\nFont sizes\n\n5% opacity, versus 50% opacity\n\nGlobal states for ‘disabled’ and ‘active’\n\n\nSystematising the design 185\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nSystematising the design 185\n\nStrike up a conversation with the developer on your team that cares most about\nthe front-end, and ask them about creating Sass variables and design tokens.\n\n\n186\n\nDesign tokens essentially store design decisions — like colour, size, and\nspace — which can be systematically applied throughout a product.\n\nUse cases\n\nIf you only introduce Sass variables in your CSS, you’ll have made a big\nimprovement. But even Sass variables have their drawbacks, systematically\nspeaking. For example, take these two scenarios:\n\nOption 1 and Option 2. In both cases we want to apply a background colour to a\nwebsite (applying CSS to the body tag):\n\nOption 1 (design token)\n\nThe first option uses a design token (fig 8.18). We’ll use a real design token\nfrom the Lightning design system, called: $color-background-light. This design\ntoken is simply the colour white (#ffffff). Our design token and CSS look like\nthis:\n\nDesign token\n\n$color-background-light: #ffffff;\n\nThe design token can be applied in the CSS like so:\n\nbody {\n\nbackground-color: $color-background-light;\n\n}\n\nFig 8.18 Option 1: design token\n\nOption 2 (Sass variable)\n\nThe second option instead uses a Sass variable to apply the background colour\n(fig 8.19). Our Sass variable and CSS look like the following:\n\n\nSystematising the design 187\n\nSass variable:\n\n$white: #ffffff;\n\nThe Sass variable can be applied in the CSS like so:\n\nbody {\n\nbackground-color: $white;\n\n}\n\nFig 8.19 Option 2: Sass variable\n\nSo far so good. Both options look very similar, and both work fine!\n\nNow, consider this:\n\nThe Sass variable we used ($white) is incredibly generic, and is used in\ndozens of places throughout our website. It could be used for text colours,\nsvg colours, or any other object that is white.\n\nIn contrast, the design token we used ($color-background-light) is\nspecifically used as a background colour.\n\nScenario: we want to change our website’s background colour to be a slightly\noff-white colour (or any light colour).\n\nIn Option 1 (design token) we’d be okay, as we’d be making a global change to\na design token intended only for scenarios just like or similar to this one.\nChanging from white to a new colour will likely be fine.\n\nIn Option 2 (Sass variable) we have a problem. Our Sass variable is used in\nseveral places — changing the colour of the Sass variable to a new colour\ncould cause problems elsewhere in our website.\n\nIt’s complicated, I know. But you should consider these caveats when deciding\non design tokens and their use cases in your system.\n\n\n188\n\nBuzzFeed’s Solid design system uses design tokens for specific use cases of\ncolour in text (fig 8.20), links, and even SVG fill colours:\n\nNotice: Solid’s design token $text-green is intended to be used to make text\ngreen (obviously), but it’s not saying specifically what green colour.\nDesignating a token for a specific scenario is good, since you may use a\ndarker shade of green for text (for legibility purposes), and a lighter shade\n\n![](image/670.png)\n\n![](image/docs-solid-3.png)\n\nFig 8.20\n[solid.buzzfeed.com/colors.html](https://solid.buzzfeed.com/colors.html)\n\n\nSystematising the design 189\n\nof green for icons or background colours — in which case you could also have\ntokens like: $icon-green and $background-green.\n\nLonely Planet’s design system, Rizzo (fig 8.21), includes design token\ndocumentation for colour that are clearly and effectively presented and\norganised by function (e.g. “UI background and borders”, or “section\ncolours”). A really neat feature on this page is the ability to copy the hex\nvalue to your clipboard simply by clicking on the colour.\n\n![](image/674.png)\n\n![](image/docs-rizzo-1-cursor.png)\n\nFig 8.21 [rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/ui-\ncolours](https://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/ui-colours)\n\n\n190\n\nCombining Sass variables and design tokens, for the win\n\nIf you want to get really smart, you can combine the two together to form the\nmost efficient, scalable, and easily updatable system (fig 8.23):\n\nDesign token and Sass variable combined:\n\n$white: #ffffff;\n\n$color-background-light: $white;\n\nOur Option 1 and 2 scenario (from earlier) is now a little easier to solve:\n\n$white: #ffffff;\n\n$off-white: #f9f9f9;\n\n$color-background-light: $white;\n\n$color-background-light: $off-white;\n\nFig 8.23 Combining Sass variables with design tokens\n\n![](image/679.png)\n\n![](image/docs-vue-1.png)\n\nFig 8.22 [vueds.com/example/#/Design\nTokens](https://vueds.com/example/#/Design%20Tokens)\n\n\nSystematising the design 191\n\nNow for a full example! Don’t worry if you don’t know code, I’ve attempted to\nbreak down what’s happening to show Sass variables, design tokens, CSS, and\nHTML at work (fig 8.24):\n\nSass variable:\n\n$blue50: #62A5D7;\n\nDesign token, using the Sass variable:\n\n$brand-color-primary: $blue50;\n\nDesign token applied to a text style in the CSS:\n\n.primary-header {\n\ncolor: $brand-color-primary;\n\n}\n\nCSS applied to a header in the HTML:\n\n<h1 class=”primary-header”>Hello</h1>\n\nFig 8.24 Sass variables, design tokens, CSS, and HTML\n\nThe above code gives us this in the browser:\n\n![](image/hello-blue.png)\n\n\n192\n\nNow, to use our same example again. If we add a new Sass variable ($red50),\nthen change our $brand-primary design token to use $red50 instead of $blue50,\nthe change will ‘auto-magically’ take effect in the front-end (website). Like\nso (fig 8.25):\n\nSass variable:\n\n$blue50: #62A5D7;\n\n$red50: #b85c35;\n\nDesign token, using the Sass variable:\n\n$brand-color-primary: $blue50;\n\n$brand-color-primary: $red50;\n\nFig 8.25 Combining Sass variables with design tokens\n\nThe above code gives us this in the browser:\n\n![](image/hello-red.png)\n\nThis might seem like a simple change (in our example), but imagine these\ndesign tokens used in dozens or hundreds of places throughout a product! You\ncan see how powerful design tokens can be.\n\nNot just for colour!\n\nWe’ve only looked at colour so far, but Sass variables and design tokens can\nbe used for anything from font families to font sizes, line heights, spacing\n(margins and padding), radius, shadow, and so on. They can be\n\n\nSystematising the design 193\n\nused for anything that’s reused consistently throughout a product. For\nexample, the Vue design system documentation (fig 8.22) also includes design\ntokens for spacing.\n\nIt’s good practice to use consistent spacing in digital design, and chances\nare you’ve defined some logic for that spacing. If you’re obsessive like me,\nyou might like working with simple numbers that are divisible by 5 — something\nlike: 5px, 10px, 15px, 20px, 30px, 60px, 90px, 120px. Or if you’re using a\ngrid system — like the ‘8-point grid system’ — you would use: 8px, 16px, 24px,\n32px, 40px, 48px, 56px, and so on.\n\nGitHub’s Primer design system uses the 8-point grid system, and they’ve\nincluded a page (fig 8.26) in their documentation relating to their variables\nused for consistent spacing. Notice in their system: it’s smart that they’ve\nadditionally added a variable for 4px. A minimum spacing of 8px is a little\nlimiting.\n\n![](image/686.png)\n\n![](image/docs-primer-2.png)\n\nFig 8.26\n[primer.style/css/support/spacing](https://primer.style/css/support/spacing)\n\n\n194\n\nDesigner access to code\n\nI’d like to make an argument for granting designers (not just developers)\naccess to the code. This will scare some, and excite others. Developers can be\nvery protective of their code bases, with good reason. However, they also\ndon’t love getting ‘bugged’ by designers to make (seemingly) small updates to\nthe code. The easiest way to avoid this is for designers to gain access to the\ncode themselves. Design tokens make this process so much easier.\n\nEven if a designer only has access to the design tokens and Sass variables,\nthey can achieve a lot — quickly — without disturbing developers. If they want\nto change the colour blue used in X scenarios, they can. If they want to\nincrease the space between X and Y elements throughout the product, they can.\n\nDesigners that code\n\nWeb designers having even a little knowledge of code will go a long way. I\ncan’t recommend enough that designers get comfortable with — at least — CSS\nand HTML. It simply will make you a better web designer if you gain a deeper\nunderstanding of your craft. You may be surprised by how much you enjoy it.\nIt’s fun and very satisfying to bring your own creations to life, and iterate\non them in the browser!\n\nThat said, even if you’re not planning to build websites yourself, a little\nknowledge of code is all you need to update things like design tokens. I\nreally believe that anything that brings designers and developers closer\ntogether is a good thing. Speak to the developers on your team about gaining\naccess to the code.\n\nIf you want to go deeper into the realms of ‘the role of development in\ndesign’, check out this article (8.19) I wrote on responsive design.\n\n8.19 [medium.com/@andrewcouldwell/responsive-design-\naf7a1f14b991](https://medium.com/owl-studios/responsive-design-af7a1f14b991)\n\n8.20 [trello.com](https://trello.com/)\n\n8.21 [roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/](https://roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/)\n\n\nSystematising the design 195\n\nTracking and organising system tasks\n\nAs you may be realising, creating a design library is a lot of work! You’re\ngoing to need to get organised, keep track of ‘to-dos’, and know who’s doing\nwhat (on your team and/or across your different teams). Everyone has their\npreferences for tracking tasks and delegating. Some use tools like GitHub\nIssues, Basecamp, Dropbox Paper, Asana, or Jira. My tool of choice for\ntracking massive projects like product and system design is Trello (8.20).\n\nI love the simplicity of Trello. It allows you to create boards to track\nprojects, milestones, or sprints. Within each board, you can create cards to\nrepresent tasks. Within each card, you can describe the task, and create\nchecklists for everything that needs to happen to complete the task. You can\nsort the checklists by sub-headers, drag and drop everything to re-order and\nprioritise, set a due date, add attachments, assign cards to different team\nmembers, and your team can comment on tasks.\n\nThe example screenshot (fig 8.27) is of my Trello board from 2015/16, which I\nused while designing Adobe Portfolio (8.21):\n\n![](image/694.png)\n\n![](image/trello-portfolio-1.png)\n\nFig 8.27 My Trello borad from 2015 while designing Adobe Portfolio\n\n\n196\n\nThe columns (fig 8.27) are different boards I created to mark milestones and\ntrack tasks (cards) that needed to be completed. For context, all the green\nmarkers signify that I’d completed those tasks (bearing in mind this is an old\nTrello board!) — back in 2015/16, there would have been a sea of red markers\non this board, which I gradually turned to green over time!\n\nThis was a massive project spanning system design, product design, web design,\nmarketing, and brand. Organisation for so many tasks and deadlines was\ncrucial. This was my first real test of Trello, and it served me well! The\ntext is small, but perhaps you can make out (fig 8.27) that some of the tasks\nonly had one checklist item to complete the task, where others had 20+\nchecklist items.\n\n![](image/698.png)\n\nFig 8.28 Checklists to track to-dos and progress of tasks\n\n![](image/trello-wework-2.png)\n\n\nSystematising the design 197\n\nOne of my favourite features is when you ‘tick’ tasks off a checklist — or add\nmore tasks — a percentage complete bar dynamically fills to show your\nprogress. It’s painfully nerdy, I know, but there’s something very satisfying\nabout checking tasks off and seeing your progress. You can see in the next\nscreenshot (fig 8.28) that the first checklist is 100% complete, but the\nsecond checklist is only 82% complete.\n\nLook how far we’ve come!\n\nWe’ve covered a lot in this chapter, from creating a shared design system\nlibrary of editable components, to pattern libraries, responsive design,\nnaming conventions, working with colours, text styles, spacing, designers\nwriting code, and creating design tokens. My hope is that you now have a good\nidea of how to go about systematising your designs and working more\nefficiently as a team.\n\nNext we’re going to talk about a very important part of creating a design\nsystem: the documentation.\n\n\n198\n\nDocument everything!\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n198\n\n09\n\n![](image/83.png)\n\nDoc—ument every—thing!\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nDocument everything! 199\n\nDocumentation is fundamentally important for design systems. Don’t be fooled\nby this chapter appearing so late in this book — this isn’t an indication that\nyou should leave documentation until last. You shouldn’t. You should document\ndesign and code as you progress, as part of your process.\n\nMore than a style guide\n\nA system wouldn’t be a system without rules and guidelines, which is why\ndocumentation is one of the main things that distinguishes a design system\nfrom a simple style guide or a UI kit.\n\nA ‘UI kit’ needs less introduction than a style guide — you’ve probably seen\nUI kits on Dribbble and Behance, or as free downloads promoting a service or\nvendor. They look cool, but that’s all they are: just a random assortment of\ncool-looking design elements. They often deal with ideals, and can be put to\nuse any way you wish — because they didn’t (really) have a specific use case\nin the first place, as they’re often not based in reality, with real content,\nproblems, users, or businesses.\n\nWhere a UI kit could be applied to anything, a style guide is usually more\ncomprehensive and focussed on a real product. ‘Style guide’ might be one of\nthe most confusing terms in digital design. You might even disagree with my\ndefinition of it, but as we’ve covered in this book: speaking the same\nlanguage, or at least having a shared understanding is important. So, let’s\ndefine what style guides are...\n\nStyle guides are a valuable addition to web design projects; they’re something\nI almost always deliver to a client alongside responsive web page designs.\nThey single out foundations (e.g. text styles and colours) and components\n(e.g. buttons and inputs) from a design — identifying them as deliberate\ndesign decisions that are used consistently throughout a product. A style\nguide also covers things that aren’t obvious in design mockups — things like\nhover states, error states, and so on.\n\nA style guide is a form of documentation, but not necessarily a design system\n(in its simplest of forms). They are valuable for developers to\n\n\n200\n\nbuild from, and they keep designers in-check, but they lack depth. They\nshowcase design system elements, but they generally don’t explain why, where,\nwhen, and how to use any of those elements.\n\nA simple style guide is like a diagram of all the elements that make up a\npiece of IKEA furniture without the instructions telling you how to assemble\nthem. You might build something that resembles the picture on the box, or you\nmight create something entirely different.\n\nThe Disqus style guide (fig 9.1) is a good example of a simple style guide,\nwhich documents the basics like colour, typography, and brand, but\n\n![](image/714.png)\n\n![](image/docs-disqus.png)\n\nFig 9.1 [disqus.com/pages/style-guide/](https://disqus.com/pages/style-guide/)\n\n\nDocument everything! 201\n\ndoesn’t go into detail of how to use them. This can be useful, and it serves a\npurpose, but it leaves a lot to interpretation.\n\nAll this isn’t to say that if you don’t have documentation, you don’t have a\ndesign system. That’s not true, so long as you’ve been designing\nsystematically. It’s more to say that if you’re going to all the effort of\ndesigning and building a design system, then you should do everything possible\nto ensure people use it ‘properly’ and sustainably.\n\nThe basics\n\nDocumentation acts as a source of truth — a reference point. If you’re unsure\nhow to approach, do, write, format, design, or build something , the\ndocumentation is where you’ll find the answer! It benefits everyone, from the\nmost junior to the most senior members of your team, and it’s great for on-\nboarding new team members.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nDemystifies our design and code decisions.\n\nHelps to keep all people working with the system on the same page.\n\nHelps to onboard new team members.\n\nTracks revisions to the system, to keep everyone in the loop.\n\nIt makes your company look really smart! Helps recruit new talent.\n\nBetter together\n\nAs I’ve emphasised throughout this book, when creating a design system it’s\nimportant to be mindful that you won’t be the only person who works with it.\nWe make very deliberate design decisions when we design systematically,\nmeaning the decisions we make about font size, text styles, spacing, colour,\nand animation are made for a reason. These decisions are then applied\nrepetitively and consistently across multiple elements in the system.\n\n\n202\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n202\n\nA simple style guide is like a diagram of all the elements\n\nthat make up a\n\npiece of IKEA furniture without the instructions telling you how to assemble\nthem.\n\n\nDocument everything! 203\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nDocument everything! 203\n\nYou might build something that resembles the picture on the box,\n\nor you might create something entirely different. This is why you need\ndocumentation.\n\n\n204\n\nThe guidelines and decisions you make when designing a system are no good just\nin your head. They shouldn’t be communicated on a ‘need to know’ basis.\nEverybody needs to know.\n\nThe key is to make documentation part of your (design and build) process.\nDon’t leave documentation until the end, or as an afterthought. If you do, it\nmight never get done, or you’ll forget what you’re actually documenting.\n\nDon’t get caught up in how your documentation looks. Just get the reasoning\nbehind your design decisions out of your head and into some form of\ndocumentation. You can make it look pretty later. We’ll talk more about how to\nformat and present the documentation later in this chapter. First, a few\nfurther points to demonstrate why documenting design systems is important.\n\nDon’t leave documentation until last\n\nDocumentation should never be left to the end of a project. Don’t just take it\nfrom me — Airbnb (9.1) regretted not documenting sooner:\n\n“...This project required us to operate within a tight timeline, which caused\nus to overlook some of the documentation process. Lacking thorough\ndocumentation created some confusion that could have been avoided. Just like\nwith coding, documenting systems as they are created is paramount to the\nprocess. It has to be done sooner or later, and documenting throughout the\ncreation process allows for smoother decision-making.”\n\nTo put some of what we’ve covered thus far in this chapter into perspective,\nI’ll reflect on my experience back in 2014-16 when I was designing the Adobe\nPortfolio product (9.2) at Behance. I’ll be honest, I\n\n9.1 [airbnb.design/building-a-visual-\nlanguage/](https://airbnb.design/building-a-visual-language/)\n\n9.2 [roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/](https://roomfive.net/adobe-portfolio/)\n\n\nDocument everything! 205\n\ndidn’t progress the design system as far as I would have liked or should have.\nI defined the brand foundations, designed every component and pattern, and\ncreated product flows and prototypes for every feature. It was more than\nenough to get the product built and launched, but I didn’t write any\ndocumentation. I should have.\n\nNot to beat myself up too much; the annotated designs and style guides I\ncreated were very detailed. I even defined the CSS on them! But ‘red-line’\ndesign specs aren’t good enough. They’re a form of documentation — sure — but\nthey don’t go into enough detail. These specs were more than enough to get the\nproduct into development, but they left a lot to interpretation on the design\nside — which wasn’t enough for designers to work with in the future.\n\nTo demonstrate what I mean by ‘red-line’ design specs, below (fig 9.2) is a\nspec I created for a “Remote” (in the Adobe Portfolio product):\n\nI would describe the above — at best — as a style guide or spec for a design\nsystem pattern. It details every state and scenario. The text is tiny in the\npicture (as it’s presented in this book), but take it from me: the annotations\nclearly define the sizes, spacing, and specifications. However, it leaves many\nunanswered questions:\n\n![](image/730.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-pattern-remote.png)\n\nFig 9.2 Design spec from the Adobe Portfolio product\n\n\n206\n\nWhy does it look like it does?\n\nWhy a draggable remote versus a fixed menu item?\n\nWhat exactly does this pattern do?\n\nHow does it respond to X scenario in the live product?\n\nWhat happens when I click the links versus the toggles?\n\nWhat happens if the remote is dragged off-screen?\n\nNone of the answers are obvious from the design alone. The above questions\nabout logic, systematic design, and functionality don’t just help designers\nunderstand how to work with the system, they also help developers build it! In\nfact, some of the bullet points above were real questions I was asked by\ndevelopers working on this product with me.\n\nWithout documentation, we leave patterns like this open to interpretation. The\nnext designer (or team of designers) who iterates on this pattern are going to\nhave questions. With no answers to those questions, they will do their own\nthing, and the system that governed the original design will take a different\npath.\n\nSimilarly, the following image (fig 9.3) shows button components from the same\nproduct.\n\nThis style guide specifies everything needed to build the component, but no\ninformation as to:\n\nWhy are there different types of buttons?\n\nWhen and why should I use a blue button, versus a green button?\n\nWhen and why should I use a text link, versus a button?\n\nCan I pair the different colours and types of buttons together?\n\nCan we, and do we have guidelines for including icons in buttons?\n\nI can tell you that — in this design system — the meaning behind the colours\nis important, and there very definitely are guidelines for when to use each\ntype of button, and how they pair together. The logic for all of this should\nhave been documented, or the original intent could be lost.\n\n\nDocument everything! 207\n\nWe are talking somewhat in ideals here. In reality, things don’t always unfold\nas optimally as they should. For this particular project, time was very much a\nfactor. I make my excuses, but this experience taught me a valuable lesson.\nWhat I should have done was to document the design system as it was being\ndesigned — as part of the design process, rather than waiting until a\nconvenient time… Later… Or in this case never (I moved on from Adobe a couple\nmonths after this product’s launch). This\n\n![](image/612.png)\n\n![](image/portfolio-components-buttons.png)\n\nFig 9.3 A style guide for button components\n\n\n208\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n208\n\nThe guidelines and decisions you make when designing a system are no good just\nin your head. They’re not ‘need to know’. Everyone\n\non your team\n\nneeds to know.\n\n\nDocument everything! 209\n\nissue is, I’m sure, something most of you can relate to. Failing to document\nyour design decisions is sometimes genuinely unavoidable. But often times\nwe’re just making excuses, and it costs our teams, products, and users down\nthe road.\n\nDocument as you go\n\nA good way to approach documentation is to think about what questions someone\nmight have about what you (or your team) designed. There are no stupid\nquestions, really. What’s obvious to you might not be obvious to others. Get\nit all out of your head, and documented.\n\nWrite guidelines that act as a source of truth, or reference material.\n\nExplain what ‘it’ is.\n\nWhen, where, why, and how do you use it?\n\nDocument and/or demonstrate any functionality, animation, or conditional\nlogic.\n\nLead by example and show example use cases.\n\nInclude as much detail as is appropriate. You can even include the code!\n\nWhat should you document?\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list of everything you should document, but here\nare some basics to get you started:\n\nDo’s and don’ts\n\nThroughout your documentation, it can be useful to give example use cases of\nhow to do (or not do) something. As they say: ‘a picture is worth a thousand\nwords’. Seeing is believing. Showing an example scenario where your guidelines\napply can be key to helping people understand context and application.\n\n\n210\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\n210\n\nFig 9.5\n[material.io/design/components/tooltips.html](https://material.io/design/components/tooltips.html)\n\n![](image/docs-material-1.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-2.png)\n\nFig 9.4\n[bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/accordion](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/accordion)\n\n\nDocument everything! 211\n\nThe BBC example (fig 9.4) simply uses a wireframe to demonstrate the correct\nand incorrect way of designing an accordion. The Google Material example (fig\n9.5) goes into more detail, using real scenarios from a product to demonstrate\nhow tooltips should look and function.\n\nImportantly: in both cases, the example use case imagery is accompanied by\ntext explaining what’s wrong or right about each approach. Don’t assume your\naudience can identify right or wrong themselves — this is about education,\nit’s not a test.\n\nColour\n\nDon’t just output a colour palette and hope people use it correctly. A swatch\nof colours (alone) can be used in a limitless number of ways. Write guidelines\nfor:\n\nWhy did you choose these brand colours?\n\nWhat is their intent? When and why would you use X colour over Y colour?\n\nInclude useful information like its hex value (e.g. #b85c35) and its name.\n\nHow do you reference a colour in the code?\n\nShow example use cases.\n\nOpenTable specify each colour’s name, hex value, a list of acceptable use\ncases for each colour, and even give insight into their thinking behind the\ncolour. The more insight into the design decisions you give, the better the\nsystem’s adopters will understand and apply the system. Referencing the\nOpenTable example (fig 9.6):\n\n“Early Girl is our star for experiences targeting our diners: the primary\ncolor in our corporate identity. Early girl conveys the energy and passion we\ninvest in connecting our diners to new experiences and the warmth of great\nhospitality.”\n\n\n212\n\n“Blueberry is primarily used as a secondary action color. In our restaurant-\nfocused marketing efforts, we focus on efficient service and streamlined\nreservation tools, and our blue is a calming assurance of our loyalty to\nbusiness support.”\n\nIn contrast to OpenTable’s primary brand colours (fig 9.6) — and a more\nextensive secondary palette of equally bright colours — they also have a\nsimple “Neutrals” palette (fig 9.7), intended mainly for headers and copy.\n\nHere’s how they describe this ‘neutrals’ palette:\n\n“There are colors used for action and attention, while others are used for\nutility. These neutral colors are meant to pair well with the primary and\nsecondary action colors and provide balance within the larger palette.”\n\n![](image/349.png)\n\n![](image/docs-opentable-31.png)\n\nFig 9.6 Primary brand colour palette\n\n\nDocument everything! 213\n\nConsistent and intentional use of colour is not only good for reinforcing a\nbrand’s identity and message – it also aids the user experience. For example,\nit’s good practice to use prominent and consistent colours for calls to action\nin order to draw attention to them. If you use too many different colours for\nthings like buttons and links, it becomes unclear what is actionable, and what\nisn’t. OpenTable’s colour documentation defines acceptable use cases for each\ncolour:\n\nTheir secondary colour palette is only for use in background colours. Not\ncalls to action, headers, or copy.\n\nThe only colours used for calls to action (e.g. buttons and links) are their\ntwo primary colours.\n\nTheir neutrals palette is used primarily for headers and copy — clearly\ndistinguishing copy from calls to action.\n\n![](image/217.png)\n\n![](image/docs-opentable-6.png)\n\nFig 9.7 [brand.opentable.com/color/](http://brand.opentable.com/color/)\n\n\n214\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n214\n\nDon’t leave documentation until the end, or as an afterthought. If you do, it\nmight never get done. Make documentation part of your design and build\nprocess.\n\n\nDocument everything! 215\n\nBrand identity\n\nBranding and logos can be a big investment of time and money, so protect your\nbrand by documenting how it should be used. Some things to consider:\n\nAre there any guidelines for logo size?\n\nCan the logo overlay an image, or should it only be used on a plain\nbackground?\n\nCan the colours be changed? Can the logo be all white to use on a dark\nbackground, or all black to use on a light background?\n\nWhat should we use for a Twitter avatar?\n\nWhere do I find a vector download for this asset?\n\nTo use another example (fig 9.8) from OpenTable’s digital brand guidelines: a\nnice touch here is that they include a rationale for why the logo looks the\nway it does. This may seem trivial to some, but the ethos behind their brand\nidentity is core to the design of their companies\n\n![](image/159.png)\n\n![](image/docs-opentable-4.png)\n\nFig 9.8 [brand.opentable.com/logo/](http://brand.opentable.com/logo/)\n\n\n216\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n216\n\nFailing to document our design decisions is sometimes unavoidable. But often\ntimes we’re just making excuses, and it costs our teams, products, and users\ndown\n\nthe road.\n\n\nDocument everything! 217\n\nservices and products. Understanding this is key to working with their design\nsystem:\n\n“With just a few shapes, our logo says a lot. It symbolizes the connection we\nforge between restaurants and diners, the way we help diners find the perfect\nfit, and the fact that our customers are always our focus.”\n\nOpenTable’s documentation for their logo is comprehensive. In addition to\ntheir rationalisation of the logos’ design, they cover:\n\nGuidelines for the different ways it can be presented (“Lockups”).\n\nThe minimum size the various versions should be used.\n\nGuidelines on spacing.\n\nDo’s and don’ts.\n\nA download of the digital assets.\n\nAnd as seen below (fig 9.9): the “preferred treatment” of the logo, including\nwhat to do when that’s not an option.\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/docs-opentable-5.png)\n\nFig 9.9 Preferred treatments of logo (example use cases)\n\n\n218\n\nTypography\n\nUsing a consistent and limited set of text styles, font-families, and font-\nweights simplifies the complexity of a user interface and lowers the cognitive\nload for the user. It also reduces the page load time, makes the text more\nlegible, and reduces the amount of code required. As someone who’s built many\nwebsites designed by other designers, I can tell you with confidence: sticking\nto a consistent range of text styles is something many designers fail to do.\n\nFor typefaces and font-weights:\n\nLimit the number of typefaces and font-weights you use.\n\nNote that the more typefaces (and different weights of fonts) you use, the\nslower your page will load, particularly for users on mobile phone/cellular\nnetworks. So consider this: do you need to use semi-bold and bold font-\nweights? Pick one.\n\nDefine intent for each typeface. Why and when should you use typeface X over\nY? For example, do you use a serif to distinguish headers and a sans-serif for\ncopy?\n\nFor text styles:\n\nAim to create a broad range of text styles that cover different scenarios.\nDon’t just suggest a body text style and a headline text style, consider cases\nlike subheaders, leading paragraphs, blockquotes, bulleted lists, image\ncaptions, and so on.\n\nYou probably don’t need a header text style in 19px and 20px font-size. Pick\none.\n\nWhat does each text style look like?\n\nDocument, at a minimum, each style’s font-size, line-height, and letter-\nspacing.\n\nDo different header and copy styles have specific margins or padding?\n\n\nDocument everything! 219\n\nIf appropriate, provide some context as to when to use each text style. Do you\nhave a default size for copy? A particularly large or small text-size was\nlikely created for a specific use case. If so, document that intent.\n\nI like how Marvel’s typography documentation (fig 9.10) includes a little\nwrite-up on why they chose the typeface they did.\n\n“Marvel’s primary typeface is Fakt Soft Pro — a robust typeface with legible\nnumbers that renders well at all sizes. It is soft and friendly, yet plain\nenough to get out of the way and let the user’s designs shine.”\n\n![](image/588.png)\n\n![](image/docs-marvel-2.png)\n\nFig 9.10\n[marvelapp.com/styleguide/design/typography](https://marvelapp.com/styleguide/design/typography)\n\n\n220\n\nI like how BBC GEL document “Type in action” (fig 9.11) — showing how and\nwhere to use different typefaces and text styles with simple wireframe\nexamples.\n\n![](image/784.png)\n\nFig 9.11\n[bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/typography](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/typography)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-8.png)\n\n\nDocument everything! 221\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nDocument everything! 221\n\nUsing a consistent and limited set of text styles, font families, and font\nweights simplifies the complexity of a user interface and lowers the cognitive\nload for the user.\n\n\n222\n\nCopywriting\n\nYour brand likely has a tone of voice and a style to adhere to for\ncopywriting; these guidelines will apply for all copy across your digital\nbrand, whether it’s marketing copy, headers, labels, or error messages. If\neveryone on your team writes their own copy ‘as they speak’, your brand won’t\nhave a unified voice, and won’t communicate as effectively as it could. So be\nsure your documentation includes answers to questions such as:\n\nWhat is our brand’s tone of voice? Is it assertive, friendly, bold, etc.?\n\nWhat words do we use? Do we say “Hey!” or “Hello”? Do we say “employee” or\n“team member”?\n\nDo we use sentence case, or title case for headers?\n\nDo we include a period at the end of headers?\n\nHow do we format date, time, and currency? Do we write “June 24, 1982” or\n“24th June, 1982”?\n\nAre we concerned about localisation/internationalisation?\n\nFor more tips on documenting copywriting, take a look back at the “Brand Tone\nof Voice and Copywriting” section in the “Laying the Foundations” chapter in\nthis book.\n\nComponents\n\nComponents come in many sizes, shapes, colours, and types. Make sure you\ncapture them all, plus all their variations and states. Some basic\nconsiderations for your documentation to get you started:\n\nDemonstrate what the component looks like, including all its different states\n(e.g. placeholder, value, hover, error, disabled).\n\nProvide context as to why and when you would use the component.\n\nWhen should we use one type of button over another?\n\nDo form inputs need a placeholder?\n\nDo we hide or show labels above — or inline with — form inputs?\n\n\nDocument everything! 223\n\nThe Primer design system by GitHub has great documentation for their button\ncomponents (fig 9.12). They have example live components you can interact with\nto really get a feel for how they work. They also show how to apply them in\nthe code, and include a little write-up as to their use cases. This write-up\nis important, especially in cases like Primer where there are multiple types\nof buttons — as it provides context as to when to use each variant.\n\n![](image/794.png)\n\n![](image/docs-primer-3.png)\n\nFig 9.12\n[primer.style/css/components/buttons](https://primer.style/css/components/buttons)\n\n\n224\n\nThe following two images are examples of text input (fig 9.13) and button (fig\n9.14) component documentation I’ve created. Where the Primer documentation\n(fig 9.12) is a living style guide — using dynamic, interactive components\nfrom production — I like to use (static) visuals to demonstrate all the\ndifferent states of each component. This allows me to be more explicit as to\ntheir different states:\n\nWhile live, interactive components are great, they do leave a lot to\ninterpretation. With this in mind, perhaps it’s worth doing both (include a\nlive interactive component and a static mockup of all its states). Where\nstatic visuals require more work to maintain, they can be really valuable to\nfoster understanding of how the component works, as they allow you to clearly\ndemonstrate all the different states of the component (I’ll discuss the pros\nand cons of using dynamic examples in your documentation later in this\nchapter.)\n\nWhen documenting components, I also like to include the basic CSS; this\n\n![](image/798.png)\n\n![](image/docs-plasma-6.png)\n\nFig 9.13 [plasma.guide/form-specs/](http://plasma.guide/form-specs/)\n\n\nDocument everything! 225\n\nallows me to be even more explicit about the component’s makeup — plus I\nbelieve it’s healthy for designers to be exposed to CSS and get a sense for\nhow things are made (fig 9.13). I also include annotated breakdowns of the\ncomponent (fig 9.14 \\+ 9.15), and written guidelines of their makeup (e.g.\nspacing, sizes, and other specifications), and example use cases.\n\n![](image/803.png)\n\nFig 9.14 [plasma.guide/buttons/](http://plasma.guide/buttons/)\n\n![](image/docs-plasma-7.png)\n\n![](image/805.png)\n\nFig 9.15 Clear breakdowns of components\n\n![](image/rivendell-spec-input.png)\n\n\n226\n\nAtlassian do a nice job of annotating the makeup of their components (fig\n9.16) and patterns (fig 9.17):\n\n![](image/808.png)\n\n![](image/docs-atlassian-4.png)\n\nFig 9.17\n[atlassian.design/guidelines/product/patterns/forms](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/product/patterns/forms)\n\n![](image/docs-atlassian-1.png)\n\nFig 9.16 [atlassian.design/guidelines/product/components/text-\nfield](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/product/components/text-field)\n\n\nDocument everything! 227\n\nPatterns\n\nPatterns are the larger building blocks of a user interface that are used\nrepeatedly throughout a design. You should capture each of these patterns, and\nanswer questions such as:\n\nAre our patterns modular? How do they work together?\n\nWhat is the purpose of each pattern?\n\nWhat are some example use cases?\n\nHow does a pattern respond at different browser widths, and on different\ndevices?\n\nIs there any conditional logic, or variants to suit different content\nscenarios?\n\nBBC GEL does a really nice and very thorough job of documenting their design\npatterns (fig 9.18); they explain the makeup of the pattern (fig 9.19),\n\n![](image/405.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-pattern-1.png)\n\nFig 9.18 [bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/design-\npatterns](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/design-patterns)\n\n\n228\n\nwhat it is, when you could use it, any differences between iOS and Android\n(fig 9.20), and include any rules and variations.\n\nThey even include guidelines and designs for edge cases, such as:\n\nWhat happens if JavaScript is turned off? (fig 9.21)\n\nHow do patterns respond to long words in tight spaces? (fig 9.22) They use the\nWelsh language as an example, but you could use German, or any long words in\nany language! Remember: use realistic (and unruly) content when you design.\n\nBootstrap also does a nice job of documenting patterns (fig 9.23); they lead\nwith a description of the pattern (not seen in the screenshot, but visit the\nlink), several interactive example variants of the pattern, and great CSS and\nJavaScript documentation. Documenting the code and use cases makes it easy to\nintegrate the pattern into a project. Design system documentation is for your\nwhole team: designers and developers.\n\n![](image/817.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-pattern-2.png)\n\nFig 9.19 Breaking down the makeup and terminology of a pattern\n\n\nDocument everything! 229\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\nDocument everything! 229\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-pattern-5.png)\n\nFig 9.21 What happens when JavaScript is turned off?\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-pattern-4.png)\n\nFig 9.22 Do’s and don’ts for dealing with long words\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-pattern-3.png)\n\nFig 9.20 Pattern variants for iOS and Android\n\n\n230\n\nDon’t forget the small things\n\nThe obvious things to document are text styles, colours, buttons, and inputs —\nbut don’t forget components and patterns like avatars, pagination, tooltips,\npills, toggles, loading spinners, breadcrumbs, and so on.\n\nMarvel (not that Marvel) have a neat little section on how they present\navatars (fig 9.24). It’s smart that they have a fallback to the user’s\ninitials in the absence of an image. Empty states are an important thing to\ndesign for and document.\n\nDo you have a system philosophy covering how component and patterns are\nanimated and loaded, what border radius or drop-shadows to use, and so on? If\nyou do, document it. The Carbon design system by IBM has a section in their\ndocumentation on “Loading” (fig 9.25), including ‘skeleton states’ (load\nstates used to illustrate the overall architecture of the page while it’s\nloading), progressive loading, loading spinners, and so on.\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bootstrap.png)\n\nFig 9.23\n[getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/carousel/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/carousel/)\n\n\nDocument everything! 231\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\nDocument everything! 231\n\n![](image/docs-ibm-6.png)\n\nFig 9.25\n[carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading/)\n\n![](image/docs-marvel-3.png)\n\nFig 9.24\n[marvelapp.com/styleguide/components/avatars](https://marvelapp.com/styleguide/components/avatars)\n\n\n232\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n232\n\nIt’s all very well and good to design and document a mass of components and\npatterns, but\n\nthey’re effectively\n\na UI kit without some logic for how they work together.\n\n\nDocument everything! 233\n\nGrid, layout, and spacing\n\nIt’s all very well and good to design and document a mass of components and\npatterns, but they’re effectively a UI kit without some logic for how they\nwork together. Document the system accounting for things like:\n\nIs there consistent spacing in and around components and patterns?\n\nAre patterns designed to be modular?\n\nIs the design system responsive, or designed to a grid?\n\nHow does the layout respond at different browser widths?\n\nAre there any considerations for designing for different devices?\n\nBBC GEL do a great job of documenting their rationale and system thinking for\ngrid, spacing, and layout (fig 9.26 \\+ 9.27).\n\n![](image/842.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-9.png)\n\nFig 9.26\n[bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/grid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/grid)\n\n\n234\n\nLook back at the “Responsive Design” section of the “Laying the Foundations”\nchapter in this book for more on responsive design.\n\nDesign tokens\n\nWe covered what design tokens are in the previous chapter. Suffice to say, if\nyou have design tokens, your documentation definitely needs to include a\nsource of truth for what they are and how to use them!\n\n![](image/847.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-10.png)\n\nFig 9.27\n[bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/grid](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/grid)\n\n\nDocument everything! 235\n\nThe Lightning design system documentation (fig 9.28) does a good job of\nexplaining what each design token is for. Without this context, the design\ntokens could be misused, and you could lose the advantages that come with\ncreating them in the first place.\n\nHow do you document a design system?\n\nThis is probably the most contentious part of this chapter. There are a\nmultitude of ways you can do this, and there are dozens of tools and resources\ncreated specifically for this task! I won’t get too into the technological\ndepths of how to document a design system in this book, but you can find a\nlist of great tools and resources on the website (9.3).\n\n![](image/851.png)\n\n![](image/docs-lightning-11.png)\n\nFig 9.28 [lightningdesignsystem.com/design-\ntokens/](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)\n\n9.3\n[designsystemfoundations.com/resources/](https://designsystemfoundations.com/resources/)\n\n\n236\n\nSince there are so many options available to you, you should discuss amongst\nyour team what approach would be most effective for everyone. Developers are\nlikely going to be key to these discussions, as they are better placed to set\nup an environment to write, edit, share, maintain, and publish the\ndocumentation.\n\nThe basic factors you need to address are:\n\nIt needs to be accessible and editable by your team.\n\nIt needs to be easily shareable and visible to all stakeholders.\n\nIt can include text and images (visuals are important to aid understanding).\n\nIt’s likely going to be large, so it needs to be easy to navigate. And the\nnavigation needs to be scalable, to grow as you add more to the system.\n\nAnd the nice-to-haves are:\n\nAbility to include (or embed) live, interactive examples.\n\nAbility to include code snippets/examples.\n\nA changelog so you can track iterations to the system over time.\n\nAbility to search for content.\n\nGetting started, the easy way\n\nThere’s only one rule for how to document your design systems: don’t let\ntechnology or design bias stand in the way of progress.\n\nIt’s easy for a designer to get swept away in the presentation and styling of\nsomething, or get intimidated by technological barriers. Similarly, it’s easy\nfor a developer to get caught up in the most efficient or securest means of\ncontent managing, maintaining, and hosting the documentation. Both parties can\nbe highly opinionated. Don’t allow this friction to cause delay.\n\nI felt this friction the first time I approached design system documentation.\nAs a designer and a developer, I felt almost imprisoned by the multitude of\noptions available! My initial goal — having seen so many\n\n\nDocument everything! 237\n\nstellar examples online — was to create a custom branded website to document\nthe system. Thankfully, after a little research I quickly realised that the\ntime spent thinking about, researching, designing, and building this website\nwas only delaying me actually creating the documentation!\n\nSo to get started I simply created a new Google Doc (9.4) and started typing.\n\nAs the document grew, I realised Google Docs covered all the basics (from the\nlist earlier) of what we needed it to do.\n\nIt’s simple and fast to set up and write.\n\nIt’s easily accessible by your team.\n\nYou can control privacy by setting who does and doesn’t have access to it, and\nassign levels of access — such as read or comment only.\n\n![](image/201.png)\n\n![](image/docs-plasma-1.png)\n\nFig 9.29 A screenshot from documentation I’ve created in Google Docs\n\n9.4 [google.com/docs/about/](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)\n\n\n238\n\nYour team can comment inline, which is great for feedback and iteration.\n\nYou can insert images and tables for visuals and example use cases.\n\nThe ‘Document Outline’ feature — plus the ability to link/anchor to bookmarks\nand headings within the document — provides (good enough) navigation.\n\nA Google Doc might not be the most exciting means of documentation, but it\ndoes provide an effective and fast means of documenting everything from\nfoundations, such as copywriting, brand tone of voice, and formatting (fig\n9.30):\n\nTo documenting components (fig 9.31) and patterns (fig 9.32).\n\nNote: These Google Doc example screenshots are from the Plasma design system.\nIf you’re interested, I wrote a case study (9.5) about the design and\ndocumentation of this system.\n\n![](image/686.png)\n\n![](image/docs-plasma-3.png)\n\nFig 9.30 You can use tables to format content (e.g. do’s and don’ts)\n\n\nDocument everything! 239\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\nDocument everything! 239\n\n![](image/docs-plasma-2.png)\n\nFig 9.32 Documenting patterns\n\n![](image/docs-plasma-4.png)\n\nFig 9.31 Documenting components\n\n\n240\n\nGoogle Docs is a genuinely good tool for documentation, but it only takes you\nso far. Where the Plasma design system was concerned, we did experience\ngrowing pains:\n\nIt’s inefficient to quickly link to specific content within the document (e.g.\nfrom Slack or an email).\n\nSearching for content could be easier.\n\nYou can’t embed live, interactive examples of components and patterns.\n\nAnd despite your best efforts to format the content ‘nicely’, a Google Doc\nisn’t the most engaging way to present content (depending on your audience).\n\nFor what it’s worth, this particular Google Doc did its job for nearly a year\nwhile we focussed on more pressing tasks, like actually building and\nimplementing the system! Don’t lose sight of your priorities.\n\nIn time, opportunities arose to evolve the documentation into more of a\n‘living style guide’, which aimed to include live examples from production and\ncode snippets, along with a more accessible, user-friendly, and branded user\nexperience.\n\nLiving style guides\n\nOne of the bigger challenges of design systems is keeping the design, code,\nand documentation in sync. Consider these scenarios:\n\nA designer iterates on a button, the code and design library are updated, but\nthe designer forgets to update the image mockup of the button in the static\ndocumentation.\n\nSimilarly, if any code snippets (in the static documentation) are written as\nnon-dynamic text entries, then they won’t reflect any updates made to the\nproduction code, unless someone remembers to manually make the updates.\n\nIt’s an easy mistake to make, but the documentation isn’t of much use\n\n\nDocument everything! 241\n\nwhen it’s different to the actual design system.\n\nThe key difference between a living style guide and static documentation is\nthat a living style guide contains live design elements pulled directly from —\nor embedded from — the live source code. They are real and dynamic — not\n(only) an image or a mockup of a component. You can hover over a component and\ninteract with it. And perhaps most importantly, they (somewhat automatically)\nevolve as your system evolves.\n\nWith a living style guide, any changes you make to production will be\nreflected in the documentation, at least where the live examples and code are\nconcerned. Any write-up concerning the foundation, component, or pattern will\nstill need to be updated.\n\nRegardless of whether you choose to use static or dynamic documentation, the\nmost important takeaway is this: it should be part of your process to update\nanything in your documentation that’s not automated whenever you make changes\nto a design system.\n\nIf not a Google Doc, then what?\n\nIf you want to create more dynamic design system documentation — something\nmore than a Google Doc — then there are a multitude of ways you can do it.\nThere are also ways to generate living style guides directly from your code!\n\nMore and more tools and resources are being created all the time. As stated\nbefore; technology moves too fast for print, so rather than writing about them\nin this book — and risking tools becoming obsolete, or missing new tools post-\npublishing — I’ve linked to various tools and resources on this book’s website\n(9.6).\n\nSpinning up editable documentation and living style guides enters\n\n9.5 [medium.com/owl-studios/plasma-design-\nsystem-4d63fb6c1afc](https://medium.com/owl-studios/plasma-design-\nsystem-4d63fb6c1afc)\n\n9.6\n[designsystemfoundations.com/resources/](https://designsystemfoundations.com/resources/)\n\n\n242\n\ndeveloper territory — or at least an area where designers and developers\nshould converge. Since this is a design-focussed book, my advice is to speak\nto the developers on your team and tell them you want to create design system\ndocumentation (or the Digital Foundations we spoke about earlier in this\nbook). Don’t be afraid to ask. My experience has often been that experts will\nappreciate you seeking their help.\n\nTell the developers you need:\n\nA platform the whole team can contribute to and update on a regular basis.\n\nThe ability to write and format text and upload images.\n\nThe ability to add new pages and organise content by sections and subsections.\n\nA simple navigation which scales when you add new content.\n\nThe ability to pull in or embed real components and patterns from production\n(code) to demonstrate design system elements.\n\nTo publish the documentation online (publicly), or — if you prefer it be\nprivate — to make it password protected.\n\nNote: The above list isn’t comprehensive, it’s just to get you started. I\nadvise that you get together with your team to discuss the best solutions to\nbenefit all parties.\n\nFor what it’s worth, in the Plasma design system example earlier — where we\nmoved from static documentation in Google Docs to a more dynamic solution — we\nused a tool called GitBook (9.7).\n\nThe basic premise of GitBook is this: you write your documentation in markdown\n(9.8) (a simple formatting language) in GitHub (9.9), then GitBook weaves its\nmagic to convert it into a website. Full disclosure: I’m a front-end developer\nand I still struggled to get this set up on my\n\n9.7 [gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/)\n\n9.8 [wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)\n\n9.9 [github.com](https://github.com/)\n\n\nDocument everything! 243\n\nown, so I worked with developers on our team to get it all running — I advise\nyou to do the same. Once it was set up, it was easy to write the documentation\nin markdown (once you get used to it), and you need only a basic understanding\nof HTML and CSS to customise the style of the site and tailor the\ndocumentation to your brand.\n\nDon’t worry if creating a dynamic documentation website sounds too challenging\nfor now! As I said, using a simple tool like Google Docs for your design\nsystem documentation will take you far, and is much better than not\ndocumenting at all.\n\nWe’ve covered a lot in this chapter! Let’s take the foot off the pedal and\nlook at some inspiration for documenting design systems in the next chapter.\n\n\n244\n\nGallery\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n244\n\n10\n\n![](image/886.png)\n\nGall—ery\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nGallery 245\n\nIn the “Laying the Foundations” chapter of this book, we talked about\ncompanies building public websites to show off their digital brand guidelines.\nMore and more, it’s becoming common practice for companies to make their brand\nguidelines and design system documentation public. Designers and developers\nare publicly opening up about their code, processes, and design thinking.\n\nThe great thing about these companies sharing their documentation publicly is\nthat we can learn from them! Building on the examples I’ve included throughout\nthis book, this chapter is a curation of great examples for you to explore,\nand includes a little insight into what makes them such good examples.\n\nHow a company presents its Digital Foundations and/or design system\ndocumentation in public — and the insights they provide into their design and\nengineering practices — says a lot about their culture. This in itself is a\nbig part of the reason why presenting your work in the open is good — if\nnothing else, it helps you recruit the best talent.\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/brand-basic-2.png)\n\nFig 10.1 culture.basicagency.com\n\n\n246\n\nBasic Culture\n\nThe Basic Culture Manual website (fig 10.1) is a first-class example of a\ncompany flexing its muscles, giving an insight into their culture (quite\nliterally in this case), and sending a firm message that: ‘We make cool shit!\nHire us. Work with us.’\n\nWe looked at Basic’s website earlier in this book as a great example of\ndocumenting mission, values, and principles in the “Laying the Foundations”\nchapter. Their website is well worth a visit — if only to admire the design\nand animation — and be inspired by their values and design philosophies (fig\n10.2). There’s something in here for everybody.\n\nBBC GEL (Global Experience Language)\n\nIf you only look at one website for inspiration, look at the BBC GEL website\n(10.1). It includes more or less everything we covered in the “Document\nEverything” and “Laying the Foundations” chapters. GEL is a collection of\ndigital brand guidelines, design system documentation, and articles on\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/brand-basic-61.png)\n\nFig 10.2 [culture.basicagency.com/our-\nway](https://culture.basicagency.com/our-way/)\n\n\nGallery 247\n\neverything from “How to design for the (responsive) web”, to interviews with\ntheir creative teams. It’s even built into the chrome of the core BBC website;\nit’s not a standalone website, so it all feels very inclusive and well-thought\nout.\n\nTheir “Foundations” section covers things like typography, grid, layout,\nspacing, and iconography. Their “Design Patterns” section (fig 10.3) has\ndetailed breakdowns of established patterns (like accordions, cards, and\ncarousels) used throughout their digital properties, filtered by ‘Web’ and\n‘App’. Note: notice how each pattern shows whether there’s a recent update to\na pattern, and the date it was last updated:\n\n![](image/898.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-1.png)\n\nFig 10.3 [bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/design-\npatterns](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/design-patterns)\n\n\n248\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\n248\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-5.png)\n\nFig 10.4\n[bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/foundations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/foundations)\n\n\nGallery 249\n\nOne of the things I love most about GEL is how all of their documentation\nreads more like an article than documentation (fig 10.4). It’s well laid out\nand presented, and the content is inviting, easy to navigate and consume. Each\npage — whether it’s a “how-to” article, or documentation governing typography\nor patterns — is clearly introduced with an easy to digest overview, the\nlatest update, and the team that contributed to the system element or\neditorial. Any relevant downloads or links to the code are clearly visible,\nand each page has a sub-navigation, which is fixed on-scroll allowing you to\nskip-to important content, so you can find what you’re looking for quickly.\n\nWhat I find particularly great is their section of “How-to” articles (fig\n10.5). This clearly demonstrates a level of care and responsibility that all\ndesigners and engineers should aspire to. To quote from their “How to Design\nfor Accessibility” article (10.2):\n\n“We want the things we make to work for the whole audience, because the BBC\nbelieves everyone deserves the best. Our audience is diverse, not only in\ngender, age, and culture, but also in the ways they interact with us and the\nabilities they have to do so. To deliver an inclusive experience,\naccessibility must be an integral part of the user experience design. It must\nalso be integral to development and testing.”\n\nThe BBC’s design system documentation and digital brand guidelines are not\njust a technical blueprint, they are also thoughtful and inspirational, and\ngive their teams a mission.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the entire BBC GEL website is black and white.\nColour is seldom used. Even the visuals focus heavily on wireframes to\ndemonstrate their design system patterns — like the following example\nscreenshot (fig 10.6) showing a variant on their “Cards” pattern.\n\n10.1 [bbc.co.uk/gel/](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/)\n\n10.2 [bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/how-to-design-for-\naccessibility](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/how-to-design-for-\naccessibility)\n\n\n250\n\nThis is worth noting because by focusing more on structure than style, they\nare highlighting that their system foundations and patterns are really just a\nvehicle for their content. As we covered earlier in this book: design for the\ncontent, don’t fit the content to the design.\n\n![](image/184.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-6.png)\n\nFig 10.6 Visuals focus on the makeup of the pattern, not visual design\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-4.png)\n\nFig 10.5 [bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/how-\nto](https://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/category/how-to)\n\n\nGallery 251\n\nThe BBC’s patterns make no assumptions about the content. Given the abundance\nand wide range of content the BBC’s various digital properties cover, it’s\nimperative that their patterns are designed to work with any content, not just\nbest case scenarios. And their documentation is a testament to that. They\ndon’t rely on ‘pretty’ visuals for them to work. They include long headlines,\nas opposed to convenient character counts. Patterns have variants to cover\ndifferent scenarios, media, and content (fig 10.7). And they are all designed\nwith accessibility in mind.\n\nThe BBC’s documentation shares more or less everything related to the design\nof their systems, even including some code. In contrast, Airbnb takes a very\ndifferent approach.\n\nAirbnb Design\n\nAirbnb’s public design system content shows that you can create buzz\n\n![](image/405.png)\n\n![](image/docs-bbc-7.png)\n\nFig 10.7 Documenting example use cases for pattern variants\n\n\n252\n\naround your design system without actually making your system or its\ndocumentation public. Their “Airbnb Design” website (fig 10.8) clearly\ndemonstrates their strong design and engineering cultures, and the work that\ngoes into creating their design systems. Their website features designers and\nengineers giving insight into their design process via articles, events, and\ncase studies. It doesn’t give much away in terms of the system or\ndocumentation itself, but it’s an interesting insight into how they think\nabout and design products and systems.\n\n![](image/163.png)\n\n![](image/docs-airbnb.png)\n\nFig 10.8 [airbnb.design](https://airbnb.design/)\n\n\nGallery 253\n\nLightning design system (Salesforce)\n\nThe Lightning design system documentation (fig 10.9) is a treasure trove of\nknowledge. They even have a download section (10.3) where you can download a\ncomprehensive Sketch file of all the components and icons they use, and they\neven offer their pre-built CSS framework!\n\nThe Lightning documentation is very much a ‘living style guide’; much of what\nyou see is pulled directly from source, so you can interact with the system\ncomponents and patterns.\n\nTheir system relies heavily on design tokens, which is reinforced throughout\ntheir documentation. They also include notes on the accessibility features of\ncertain components, which is a nice touch — both because it educates us, and\nshows they care about all their users! Code is also featured throughout,\nincluding release notes, giving you in-depth insight into how to design and\nbuild with the system.\n\n![](image/167.png)\n\n![](image/docs-lightning-4.png)\n\nFig 10.9 [lightningdesignsystem.com](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/)\n\n10.3\n[lightningdesignsystem.com/downloads/](https://lightningdesignsystem.com/downloads/)\n\n\n254\n\nWhere some documentation is aimed solely at designers, Lightning is very much\naimed at designers and developers, or designer-developer hybrids.\n\nWhere Salesforce’s Lightning documentation is very much a living style guide,\nin contrast, the Nachos design system is more of a static style guide.\n\nNachos design system (Trello)\n\nI like how simple and on-point the Nachos documentation website is. Trello’s\ndesign documentation uses static images to showcase components, and that’s\nfine, so long as the team responsible for maintaining the documentation\nupdates those images when any changes are made to their appearance.\nDocumenting systems in this way also requires less development support, so is\narguably a more designer-friendly approach.\n\nI love how detailed Trello gets with their image specs; this (for me) is\nsomething that makes (some) static documentation websites better than\n\n![](image/159.png)\n\nFig 10.10 Technical, code-focussed documentation\n\n![](image/docs-lightning-5.png)\n\n\nGallery 255\n\n(some) living style guides. Interactive components are great, but I would\nstill advise including some kind of specs to really highlight what goes into\nthe creation of components and patterns. This way, designers learn how it’s\nmade, and don’t just see the end result.\n\nBreaking down the anatomy of how a button is designed (fig 10.11) — or how\nicons are created and what size they should be (fig 10.12) — is both\ninteresting and insightful, whether you’re a member of the team using the\ndesign system, or an outsider admiring their work. Remember the note earlier\non insight into culture… Well, the attention to detail Trello’s documentation\ndemonstrates is inspiring.\n\nI also like that Trello have included their design principles (fig 10.13) in\nwith their documentation. In an ideal world, these things are inseparable.\nIt’s arguably ‘odd’ that so many design system documentation websites leave\nprinciples out (or don’t have any).\n\n![](image/932.png)\n\n![](image/docs-trello-2.png)\n\nFig 10.11 RIP Nachos website (formerly at: design.trello.com)\n\n\n256\n\n![](image/145.png)\n\n256\n\n![](image/docs-trello-1.png)\n\nFig 10.13 Design principles and design systems go hand-in-hand\n\nFig 10.12 Documenting the anatomy of design elements\n\n![](image/docs-trello-3.png)\n\n\nGallery 257\n\nMarvel design system\n\nDare I say it... Some design system documentation is plain ugly! Marvel’s\ndocumentation (fig 10.14) is a breath of fresh air with its clean and simple\ninterface and presentation. Their documentation home page is inviting and\nclear as to what you’re looking at; it also includes its purpose and mission:\n\n“We created this style guide to act as a central location where we house a\nlive inventory of UI components, brand guidelines, brand assets, code\nsnippets, developer guidelines, and more. Anyone working on the Marvel product\nis encouraged to stay familiar with this style guide and help ensure that it\nis kept up-to-date.”\n\nNotice the orange “We’re hiring” prompt above their logo (fig 10.14)…\nRecruitment is a key motivation for publicising a good deal of documentation\nwebsites — so why not make it obvious? If I was looking for a job with a\ncompany that cared about system design, I’d click that link:\n\n![](image/686.png)\n\n![](image/docs-marvel-1.png)\n\nFig 10.14\n[marvelapp.com/styleguide/](https://marvelapp.com/styleguide/overview/introduction)\n\n\n258\n\nTalking of ‘pretty websites’ (and flagging that we’re hiring)... Damn, Primer,\nlook at you (fig 10.15):\n\nPrimer design system (GitHub)\n\nSimilar to Marvel — only more pronounced this time — is GitHub’s reference to\nrecruitment, proudly and prominently presented in this beautifully designed\ngateway page to their design system documentation. Sexy design is certainly\nnot the objective of design system documentation — don’t get me wrong — but if\nyou’re going to all the trouble of creating this documentation, why not also\nmake it look great. The better it’s designed and the easier the content is to\nnavigate, the more likely your team is to engage with it!\n\n![](image/932.png)\n\n![](image/docs-primer-1.png)\n\nFig 10.15 [primer.style](https://primer.style/)\n\n\nGallery 259\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nGallery 259\n\nThe better your documentation is designed and the easier the content is to\nnavigate, the more likely your team is to engage with it! Especially\ndesigners.\n\n\n260\n\nCarbon design system (IBM)\n\nI like how Carbon splits its documentation of components into “Usage” (fig\n10.16) and “Code” (fig 10.17). It’s interesting to note their specificity over\nhow and when to use a link or a button, and the limit for how many times a\nprimary button should be used on a page. I particularly like their breakdown\nof each button types’ purpose:\n\n“Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include Add, Save,\nDelete, Sign up. Do not use Buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use\nLinks because it takes the user to a new page and is not associated with an\naction. Each page may have one to two primary buttons. Any remaining calls-to-\naction are represented as secondary buttons.”\n\n![](image/197.png)\n\n![](image/docs-ibm-3.png)\n\nFig 10.16\n[carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage)\n\n\nGallery 261\n\nIt’s also helpful that, alongside their code documentation for each component,\nthey include a link out to CodePen (fig 10.18) where you\n\n![](image/273.png)\n\nFig 10.17\n[carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/code](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/code)\n\n![](image/docs-ibm-4.png)\n\n![](image/679.png)\n\n![](image/docs-ibm-5.png)\n\nFig 10.18 Documentation linking to [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/#) examples\n\n\n262\n\ncan view and edit the code. I think this is a great idea, as it gives you the\nopportunity to play with the code so you can really understand how it works.\nThis also helps to bridge the gap between design and development.\n\nSeeds (Sprout Social)\n\nI really like how Sprout Social presents their brand guidelines and design\nsystem documentation in one central hub (fig 10.19). I’ve stressed the\nimportance of having a source of truth, and utilising digital brand guidelines\nas the foundations of products and design systems. Keeping everything together\nmakes perfect sense. They should work together, so why separate them?\n\nSeed’s home page introduces what their “Creative Hub” is and why it’s\nimportant, and a simple navigation at the top breaks the content into “Brand”,\n“Product”, “Visual”, and “Writing”. Love it. It also has a page with\ndownloads, so their brand assets are easily accessible.\n\n“A distinct and consistent brand presence sets us apart from competitors,\nbuilds trust and familiarity with our customers, and eventually leads to long-\nterm brand value.”\n\n![](image/679.png)\n\n![](image/docs-seeds-1.png)\n\nFig 10.19 [sproutsocial.com/seeds/](https://sproutsocial.com/seeds/)\n\n\nGallery 263\n\nI’m glad I found an example of a company who has chosen to protect some of\nit’s design system content (fig 10.21). Not everything needs to be for the\npublic’s eyes — some content is sensitive, or you may just prefer not to share\nit so openly. That’s totally fine, but you want to be sure you’re\n\n![](image/282.png)\n\n![](image/docs-seeds-2.png)\n\nFig 10.20 Brand, system, and product all documented in one place\n\n![](image/971.png)\n\n![](image/docs-seeds-3.png)\n\nfig 10.21 Password protecting content not for public eyes\n\n\n264\n\nmaintaining your single source of truth, rather than have public content\n‘here’ and private content ‘there’. Password protecting content that’s for\npersonnel eyes only is a simple solution.\n\nSolid design system (BuzzFeed)\n\nIt’s a good idea to keep your team informed about any changes being made to\nthe design system they’re working with. This is often referred to as a\n“Changelog”, but in our example (fig 10.22), BuzzFeed has a page called\n“Release Notes”. This is where they document any updates: from changes to\ncolour hex codes to pixel value changes to a border-radius, the addition of a\nnew design token, or an update to a CSS class name or Sass variable, and so\non.\n\nThumbprint design system (Thumbtack)\n\nThumbprint has a great “Guidelines” section in their documentation; it makes\neverything a little clearer for the system’s adopters. Within\n\n![](image/282.png)\n\n![](image/docs-solid-1.png)\n\nFig 10.22 [solid.buzzfeed.com/release-\nnotes.html](https://solid.buzzfeed.com/release-notes.html)\n\n\nGallery 265\n\n‘Guidelines’ there is a section on colour (fig 10.23), which has nice do’s and\ndon’ts for each colour:\n\nIt’s my hope that the examples in this chapter have given you a sense of the\nrange of possibilities and best practices for presenting Digital Foundations\nand design system documentation, or even giving insight into your company’s\ndesign and engineering cultures.\n\nI’ve done my best to curate the finest examples being shared today. However,\nthere are so many more great examples out there, and new design system and\ndocumentation websites are popping up all the time — so be sure to check out\nthis book’s website (10.4) to get even more inspiration! And please share\n(10.5) any great examples you find.\n\nNext up, we’ll talk about one of the most difficult — but arguably most vital\n— parts of design system work: maintaining a design system.\n\n![](image/282.png)\n\n![](image/docs-thumbprint-1.png)\n\nFig 10.23\n[thumbprint.design/guide/product/color/](https://thumbprint.design/guide/product/color/)\n\n10.4\n[designsystemfoundations.com/resources/](https://designsystemfoundations.com/resources/)\n\n10.5 [@andrewcouldwell](http://twitter.com/andrewcouldwell)\n\n\n266\n\nMaintaining a design system\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n266\n\n11\n\n![](image/418.png)\n\nMain—tain—ing a design system\n\nLaying the Foundations\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 267\n\nCongratulations, you’ve designed, documented, built, and integrated a design\nsystem! (Or let’s assume you have). Now for the bad news: that was the easy\npart! Keeping the design, code, and documentation in sync is arguably the most\nchallenging part of working with design systems.\n\nThe following scenarios all lead to a design system’s demise:\n\nDesigners update their mockups, style guides, library, etc., but for whatever\nreason, the developers miss the changes — or they never get around to them —\nand the design changes don’t get implemented in the code.\n\nTeam members save work on their desktop or personal computers, as opposed to a\nshared team drive/location.\n\nDesigners use their own personal set of foundations, components, and patterns,\nas opposed to a shared team library.\n\nThe design and code is updated, but the documentation isn’t.\n\nTeam members use different (incompatible) tools and/or software.\n\nTeams aren’t kept in the loop about changes to the design system.\n\nTeam members feel excluded when they don’t feel involved in — or have any\nopportunities to influence — the design or evolution of the system.\n\nAll of the above scenarios lead to the same outcome: designers work with one\nor more alternate versions of the design system, while developers work with\nthe actual live version of the design system. This is frustrating for all\nparties — it’s also completely avoidable.\n\nMaintaining a design system requires communication, process, teamwork,\ndiscipline, and stewardship. In the sections to follow, we’re going to look at\nhow to achieve this, and solutions to all of the problem scenarios listed\nabove.\n\nWork with shared design assets\n\nWe covered the importance of setting up editable and responsive components,\npatterns, and foundations in the “Systematising the Design” chapter. We talked\nbriefly about having them be easily accessible by\n\n\n268\n\nyour whole team. In this section I want to build on this and stress the\nimportance of having a shared library of assets that your design team can\nsimply insert into their designs. They should also be made aware of — and able\nto sync — any changes made to those assets.\n\nWhen design teams work with shared assets, it ensures consistency and cuts\ndown on unintentional design discrepancies. I think a shared library of design\nassets is the real game changer part of design systems — it’s where much of\nthe speed, ease, and efficiency comes in (at least on the design side of\nthings).\n\nI’m going to break my own rule concerning talking about tools in this book and\nrecommend Sketch (11.1) for web and product designers working with teams of\nother designers. This is only going on my experience. I also recommend you try\nother tools and see what works best for your team. I’ve linked to some of\nthese tools on this book’s website (11.2). But as a working example in this\nbook, I’ll use Sketch for demonstration purposes.\n\nUsing Sketch Library (11.3), you can create a master design system file\ncontaining all design system foundations, components (fig 11.1 \\+ 11.2), and\npatterns and save it somewhere accessible by all your team. It needs to be\nsomewhere that will automatically sync any changes (e.g. Dropbox 11.4).\n\nWith your master design system file in a shared location, designers on your\nteam can very simply and quickly insert assets from the master file into their\nown design files. Then, any updates made to the master file will sync to any\ndesign files using its assets.\n\nDon’t worry if this sounds difficult — it’s not — it’s actually really fast\nand easy to set up! I’ve created a Skillshare class (11.5) demonstrating how\nto set up editable design system components and a Sketch Library.\n\n11.1 [sketch.com](https://www.sketch.com/)\n\n11.2\n[designsystemfoundations.com/resources/](https://designsystemfoundations.com/resources/)\n\n11.3 [sketch.com/docs/libraries/](https://www.sketch.com/docs/libraries/)\n\n11.4 [dropbox.com](https://www.dropbox.com/)\n\n11.5 [skl.sh/2xWBObZ](http://skl.sh/2xWBObZ)\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 269\n\nIf your team decides to change the colour of a button, it would be as simple\nas updating the button symbol in the master design system library file. In\nSketch, the next time a member of your team is working on a design mockup,\nwhich uses this button they will see a “Library Updates Available” prompt to\nthe top-right of their screen (fig 11.3) letting them\n\n![](image/241.png)\n\n![](image/screen-library-2.png)\n\nfig 11.2 Zoomed in on the same Sketch file as above\n\n![](image/screen-library-1.png)\n\nfig 11.1 A Sketch file containing all system components\n\n\n270\n\nknow there’s been an update to a design asset they are using.\n\nClicking the “Library Updates Available” prompt opens up a convenient before\nand after (“Old” and “New”) view of everything that has an update (fig 11.4).\nIt might not always be appropriate to update, so it’s good you get the choice\nso you can visually compare the change to measure what impact it will have on\nyour design.\n\n![](image/1001.png)\n\n![](image/screen-sketch-library-2.png)\n\nfig 11.4 Before and after view to compare what the updates are\n\n![](image/screen-sketch-library-1.png)\n\nfig 11.3 A prompt (top-right) informs you of a library update\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 271\n\nWorking with patterns\n\nWhile Sketch symbols and Sketch Library work very well for things like\ncomponents, they don’t (always) work so well for more complex elements like\npatterns. (At least, not yet — I’m sure as design tools continue to evolve,\nthey will handle more complex patterns and responsive design better).\n\nFor patterns which are too complex to work as editable (Sketch) symbols\naccessed via Sketch Library, I recommend creating individual design files for\neach pattern and saving them somewhere easily accessible by your team. Again,\nthis needs to be somewhere your team can easily sync updates or access the\nlatest version of the file. In the below example’s case (fig 11.5), I stored\npattern files in a folder on Dropbox:\n\nEach pattern’s design file contains an up-to-date version of the pattern. If\nyou’re designing for the web, it helps to include responsive ‘versions’ of the\npattern showing how it appears at different breakpoints. Setting up your\npatterns like this — ready to copy and paste into your designs — allows for\nrapid prototyping, and acts as a good source of truth for working with design\nsystem patterns.\n\n![](image/109.png)\n\n![](image/screen-folder.png)\n\nFig 11,5 A folder of design files, accessible by the whole team\n\n\n272\n\nThe below screenshot (fig 11.6) shows a responsive pattern in Sketch. You can\nsee the desktop version of the pattern to the left, and to the right you see a\nhint of how the pattern appears at different breakpoints (e.g. tablet and\nmobile):\n\nDesigners can also refer to the documentation for the pattern to see visuals,\na write-up, guidelines, and use cases (fig 11.7). Documentation can play a key\nrole in maintaining a design system, as it provides a ‘system of record’ for\nhow system elements are intended to be used.\n\nKeep documentation up to date\n\nWe’ve covered documenting design systems extensively in this book, but for the\nsake of this chapter it’s worth reiterating the importance of keeping your\ndocumentation up to date. Your documentation isn’t of much use if it’s\nrecording a previous state or version of the design and/or code.\n\nYour documentation should be a source of truth. When your team debates how\nsomething should look or work, the documentation is the place they will look\nfor the answer — assuming you did due diligence and documented your design\nthinking when you designed the foundation, component, or pattern in question.\n\n![](image/1010.png)\n\n![](image/screen-sketch-pattern.png)\n\nfig 11.6 A pattern in Sketch, designed for each breakpoint’s grid\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 273\n\nMake it a part of your process to update design and code documentation when\nyou create new — or update existing — system elements.\n\nWhile design documentation updates are more of a manual process, it is\npossible to (at least somewhat) automate the process of code documentation.\nYou can use dynamic documentation or living style guides that pull-in code\nfrom production, or documentation that’s generated directly from the code\n(with varying degrees of success).\n\nAs this is a design-focussed book — and code documentation is outside my area\nof expertise — I’ll leave the documentation of code to the experts (i.e. your\nengineering team). There are also links to some design system documentation\ntools and resources on this book’s website (11.6).\n\n![](image/798.png)\n\n![](image/pattern-3.png)\n\nfig 11.7 Documentation for each pattern in the design system\n\n11.6\n[designsystemfoundations.com/resources/](https://designsystemfoundations.com/resources/)\n\n\n274\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n274\n\nMake it part of your process to update design libraries and any documentation\nwhen you create new, or update existing design system elements.\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 275\n\nKeeping the design and code in sync\n\nA problem every team faces with design systems is keeping the design and code\nin sync. It’s difficult! When your team is designing with components that\ndon’t exist in your live product, it’s easy for design systems to split into\ntwo versions:\n\nThe version designers work with.\n\nThe (real) version that the public sees, and that the developers work with.\n\nFrustrated by having to keep Sketch files up to date and in-sync with the live\nversion of their design system components, Airbnb sought to bridge the gap\nbetween design and code. They did this by experimenting with — and creating —\nan open-source library that allows you to write React (11.7) components that\nrender to Sketch documents. This effectively allows designers and engineers to\n‘design in the browser’, working with real data, APIs, and Flexbox (11.8).\n\n“In Sketch, we use symbols and overrides. In React, we use components and\nproperties. The concepts are so similar that it seemed silly not to unify\nthem.”\n\nSee Airbnb’s Painting with Code article (11.9) by Design Technologist, Jon\nGold (11.10) for more about this experiment.\n\nOf course, methods like Airbnb’s require designers on your team to have at\nleast a basic understanding of coding languages like React and CSS, which is\nunderstandably a barrier to entry for most design teams.\n\nMore realistically speaking: keeping the design and code in sync comes down to\nprocess and discipline.\n\n11.7 [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)\n\n11.8 [css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-\ntricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)\n\n11.9 [airbnb.design/painting-with-code/](https://airbnb.design/painting-with-\ncode/)\n\n11.10 [jon.gold](https://jon.gold/)\n\n\n276\n\nHere’s the process — if you update the design of an existing system element,\nor add a new one, you should:\n\nUpdate the library, style guide(s), or whatever design file(s) your team uses\nto share design assets.\n\nMake sure the update is effectively tracked and queued for a developer to\nupdate the code, (for example, by creating a Github Issue).\n\nUpdate any documentation.\n\nInform your team about the change. Ideally, they should be aware of the change\nbefore it’s been made. If you include them in the process of figuring out why\nthe change is needed and what the change should be, you will avoid any\nconflicts or repetition of work.\n\nIt’s advisable to assign responsibilities within your team to make sure the\nabove process is adhered to. We’ll talk about design system guardians,\nambassadors, teams, and leaders later in this chapter.\n\nCode as a design tool\n\nThe line between traditional design tools and code is becoming blurred. A good\nnumber of design tools output CSS code of variable quality, and some design\ntools even allow you to insert React components from production into your\ndesigns. I’m sure this line will continue to blur as design tools become more\nadvanced.\n\nAirbnb’s Head of Design, Alex Schleifer (11.11) comments:\n\n“We’re investing in code as a design tool. Moving closer to working with\nassets that don’t only include layout and design, but also logic and data.\nThis helps bridge the gap between engineers and designers, thus reducing the\nneed for design specs – or redlines – and the steps between vision and\nreality.”\n\nGranting designers access to code may seem like a scary proposition to some.\nBut consider the time designers spend waiting for developers to\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 277\n\nmake changes, or the distraction developers feel when designers regularly want\nto make small tweaks. Maybe it’s not such a crazy notion that designers could\njust work directly in the code?\n\nThe line between designer and developer is blurred at GitHub (11.12), which is\nhardly surprising given the nature of their business. Diana Mounter (11.13), a\ndesign system leader at GitHub, explains the benefit of designers writing\ncode:\n\n“Product designers and web designers at GitHub contribute production code and\noften assist in implementing their own designs. Some designers get deeper into\nthe stack, but every product and web designer writes CSS. This means designers\nare primary users of Primer, our design system, and are often the first to\nnotice when there are problems with styles or gaps in documentation.”\n\nKeep your team in the loop\n\nWhen you make updates to a design system, or even just while you are\ndeliberating about updates, it’s good practice to involve your team. This can\nmean a few things:\n\nMeet as a team to discuss proposed changes to the system, as opposed to having\nindividuals make updates that the team might not agree with, or aren’t aware\nof.\n\nKeep a changelog so team members can see what’s been updated, why the change\nwas made, and when it changed.\n\nUpdate the team when changes are made so people are kept in-the-know. A\nmeeting is good, but people can be absent from meetings,\n\n11.11 [twitter.com/alexoid](https://twitter.com/alexoid)\n\n11.12 [medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542](https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-\ngithub-c8e5378d2542)\n\n11.13 [broccolini.net](http://broccolini.net/)\n\n\n278\n\nand meetings don’t always work well for remote teams, so consider something\nmore inclusive — like sending an email, or writing a journal, post, or log of\nrelease notes — that detail the changes.\n\nYou could have a Slack channel dedicated to questions and updates related to\nthe design system.\n\nYou could hold ‘office hours’, where members of the team — or a design system\nlead — are available to anybody who wishes to discuss anything about the\nsystem.\n\nUse a task tracking tool like GitHub Issues, Trello, or Jira so people can\npost requests and bugs, or ask questions.\n\nTo quote from the same GitHub article as earlier:\n\n“We started using team posts to tell people about new Primer [design system]\nupdates, to give people a heads up when we shipped large code changes, and\nshare more information behind our decisions.”\n\nIt’s interesting to note that GitHub wanted to “share more information behind\nour decisions”. Providing context is always important in design systems.\nContext helps to prevent repeated tweaks of elements, which previous\niterations have already addressed. When making a change, be sure to note:\n\nWhy was the element updated?\n\nWhat problem is the update attempting to solve?\n\nWhat’s improved about it?\n\nIn addition to keeping your team apprised of changes, it’s useful to appoint a\nperson (or a rotation of people) who can answer questions about the design\nsystem, or make updates to code, files, and documentation as needed. GitHub\nagain has an answer for this with their ‘office hours’ system, as well as what\nthey call ‘First Responders’:\n\n“Most teams at GitHub have an on-call duty rotation that we call\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 279\n\nFirst Responder. Whoever is on call is responsible for triaging issues (assign\ndegrees of urgency) and responding to requests for help or code review. Having\nsomeone on call means the rest of the team can stay focused on deep work. In\naddition to First Responder, we started doing office hours 3 days per week to\ngive people a regular time to ask us questions in person. This is used for\npairing on code, talking through product updates that need our support, and\nresponding to general questions.”\n\nWhether you appoint ‘first responders’, set up office hours, or use a Slack\nchannel to field requests and address issues, it’s vital to the longevity and\nhealth of your design system that you keep the whole team in the loop and\nengaged with the system’s evolution.\n\nGuardians, ambassadors, and leaders\n\nProcess, responsibility, and accountability are hard to maintain in large\norganisations. It’s even harder when you have more than one product team\nworking with a design system, or when teams are based in different locations.\n\nWe’re human. We forget things from time-to-time. Things slip through the\ncracks. And then — to put it bluntly — you have some people who resist\nadopting the system, for whatever reason.\n\nYou need someone — or a team of people — responsible for making sure the\ndesign system is adopted and maintained, and that all stakeholders are\nsuitably educated and involved. This doesn’t mean you have to adopt an\noverlord mentality; just that you need to be realistic about the system’s\nchances of running smoothly — and evolving — without some level of oversight\nand management.\n\nDesign systems require leadership — whether it comes from a concerted,\ncollective effort by designers at your company, a dedicated design systems\nteam, and/or a ‘design system lead’.\n\n\n280\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n280\n\nYou need to be realistic about the design system’s chances of running\nsmoothly, and evolving, without some level of oversight and management.\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 281\n\nAnd keep-in-mind: the goal is to educate, not enforce. People don’t generally\nrespond well to orders. Approach the management of a design system from a\nteaching and collaborating perspective, not as the ruling authority.\n\nWith that said, let’s look at a few different strategies for establishing\ndesign system leadership on your team:\n\nAppoint a design system lead\n\nA design system lead’s key responsibilities are to:\n\nAdvocate for the system.\n\nEstablish design system processes.\n\nEnsure that any processes for updates and maintenance are upheld.\n\nEducate designers on system design best practices.\n\nResearch and discover new and improved ways to manage and maintain the system\n— whether it’s technology, processes, or design tools that could help the\nteam.\n\nPromote and seek opportunities for designers and developers to work together.\n\nKeep everyone up-to-date and engaged with the system.\n\nDeal with any resistance to the system.\n\nIf applicable, recruit design system specialists to the team.\n\nAppointing a ‘design system lead’ can help to keep things running smoothly.\nThey advocate (and, when necessary, go to battle) for the system so your team\n(and design system) can thrive.\n\nForm a design systems team\n\nA dedicated design systems team has the advantage of being freed from\nbusiness-as-usual tasks and product roadmaps, and instead can focus their time\non design system tasks. These teams are generally staffed with people who have\na broad set of skills, potentially including designer-\n\n\n282\n\ndeveloper hybrids, front-end engineers, and even roles like copywriters and\nanimation specialists. These teams work on creating design system library\nassets, documentation, pattern libraries, and even specialist tools that\nfacilitate the work of product teams.\n\nWhere designers on product teams can have a narrow vision of design at their\ncompany (i.e. they generally only see what their team works on — they don’t\nsee what every team is working on), the design systems team should have\ngreater oversight of design across all product teams. This awareness helps to\nidentify patterns and components that can be shared across teams — avoiding\nteams overlapping and needlessly creating the same elements twice.\n\nAmbassadors and guardians\n\nFor organisations with multiple product teams and/or locations, it’s somewhat\nunrealistic to expect a single design system lead — or even a design systems\nteam — to manage everything. They can’t be everywhere at once. And perhaps\nmost importantly, they can’t be expected to know all the intricacies and edge\ncases of each product team’s work, and the user and business problems they are\nsolving (which is vital knowledge for creating things like design system\npatterns).\n\nAppointing a design system ambassador on each product team alleviates some of\nthis pressure, ensuring every team has a design system voice and guardian\npresent in design critiques, sprints, and product discussions. These\nambassadors report back to the design system team — or lead — creating a\nvaluable feedback loop, and facilitating well-informed decisions.\n\nSprout Social (11.14) have successfully adopted this ambassador approach:\n\n“Our design system ambassadors are designers from across the organization that\nact as liaisons between their embedded teams and the design systems team. They\nare our eyes, ears, and voice across the company. Design system ambassadors\nnot only define and document their team’s design patterns and components,\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 283\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\nMaintaining a design system 283\n\nThe goal is to educate, not enforce. Approach the management of a design\nsystem from a teaching and collaborating perspective, not as the ruling\nauthority.\n\n\n284\n\nbut they also take ownership of them, keep their team synced on design system\ninitiatives, and uncover ways to include design system work on their team’s\nroadmaps.”\n\nSprout Social’s Design Systems Team Lead, Ben Lister (11.15) continues:\n\n“When looking for ambassadors, we seek out people who are not only passionate\nabout design systems but also those who are systems thinkers, willing to stand\nup for good design and advocate for best practices.”\n\nThe great thing about this approach is — even if you’re not empowered to hire\na design system lead or create a separate team — you can suggest that you or\nother members of your team take on a “design system guardian” role. As a\nguardian, you and system-minded designers from other product teams meet to\ncollaborate on creating and maintaining your system.\n\nWhatever approach you choose, be mindful that a design system is unlikely to\ntake-off — or survive after the fact — without leadership. Be proactive in\nhelping your team and design system thrive. You can create a team and appoint\nleaders at the outset of a design system project, or introduce them as the\nproject matures and gains trust (and a budget).\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nA design system is a marathon, not a sprint. They’re never finished. A good\ndesign system is flexible and open to change. You will grow and develop your\nfoundations, components, and patterns as you learn more about your user’s\nneeds and behaviour, and as your brand and business evolve.\n\n11.14 [link.medium.com/e6xYd06HGX](https://medium.com/sprout-social-\ndesign/design-system-ambassadors-c240e480baf6)\n\n11.15 [benlister.net](https://benlister.net/)\n\n11.16 [twitter.com/taptodismiss](https://twitter.com/taptodismiss)\n\n11.17 [medium.com/tap-to-dismiss/art-of-\ndiplomacy-2ad1e2cac795](https://medium.com/tap-to-dismiss/art-of-\ndiplomacy-2ad1e2cac795)\n\n\nMaintaining a design system 285\n\nUltimately, the goal is for design systems to become integral to how your\ncompany designs and builds products. To achieve this you need to approach\nsystem design not just from a technical stance, but also from a position of\ncooperation. Diplomacy and communication are as important as the pixels you\ncraft and the code you write.\n\nLinzi Berry (11.16), the Design Systems Lead at Lyft, wrote an excellent\narticle (11.17) on approaching design systems in a human-centered way. To\nquote from her article:\n\n“Systems design is not only scientific and meticulous, it’s the mastery of\ninteracting with people in a sensitive and effective way. The system is an\ninternal tool and our coworkers are its users. They’re human, just like us,\nand they want to do a good job. By empathizing, reassuring, educating,\nremaining flexible, sharing, communicating, and staying positive — we’ve\novercome many hurdles and are excited to take on new challenges in the\nfuture.”\n\nThe designs we create can shape our world in positive ways. When we design\nsystematically, we are able to efficiently create better experiences for our\nusers — but design systems also empower us to work better together.\n\nMy hope is that by reading this book, you are inspired and empowered — not\njust to lay strong foundations for the work you do, but also for the\nrelationships you build. Perhaps the most powerful advantage design systems\nhave is that they allow us to create better work together.\n\nI sincerely hope you enjoyed this book, and that it helps you and your team.\n\nGood luck :)\n\n\n286\n\n![](image/1053.png)\n\nAbout the author\n\n— [Andrew Couldwell](https://roomfive.net)\n\nAbout the author\n\n\nAbout the author 287\n\nAndrew is a web designer and developer, born and raised in Yorkshire, in the\nNorth of England. He started building websites in 2001, back when websites\nwere made of table-based HTML and Flash movies.\n\nHe started his career at various agencies, where he was employed as a web\ndeveloper, a web designer, and a product designer, respectively. Frustrated by\nthe limited scope and challenges of the agency world, he left to pursue a new\nlife of remote working from Cornwall, Spain, and London. During this period he\ndid freelance design and web development for brands like NASA, Red Bull, MTV,\nNike, Harvey Nichols, and Foursquare.\n\nWhen not working on client projects, Andrew focusses on his long-time passion\nproject: a website called Club of the Waves (01). First launched in 2006, the\nsite is an international showcase of artists and photographers whose work\nfocusses on surfing and surf culture.\n\nIn 2014, he moved overseas to New York City to be the lead product designer of\na new Adobe product. Working with a team of developers at Behance, together\nthey launched Adobe Portfolio, a tool that helps creatives share their work\nonline. In 2016, he moved onto a new challenge at WeWork as the system design\nlead, where he initiated, designed, and documented their digital brand\nguidelines, and two design systems.\n\nIn 2018, he returned to freelance design and development, working remotely for\nclients all around the world.\n\nAndrew does his best work when he’s designing impactful, meaningful digital\nproducts, and working with creative people who want to help people and make\nthe world a better place. He also loves to build what he designs.\n\nCurrently based in Los Angeles, California, Andrew lives with his wife,\nMeagan, and their three cats. And they’re expecting their first child twins in\n2020!\n\nSee Andrew’s portfolio at [roomfive.net](https://roomfive.net) and say hello\n[@andrewcouldwell](http://twiter.com/andrewcouldwell)\n\n01 [clubofthewaves.com](https://clubofthewaves.com)\n\n\n288\n\n![](image/_texture3.png)\n\n288\n\nOwl Studios\n\nThis book is a product of Owl Studios, who are a small but dedicated design\nand development studio. It was written and designed by Andrew Couldwell, and\nedited by Meagan Fisher.\n\nWe’re wise — and often nocturnal — designers who code; together we have over\n30 years of practice creating web experiences. We take on projects of all\nsizes, from web design and build, to product, branding, and system design. We\nalso travel to do workshops and talk at design events, internationally.\n\nIf you want to work with us; reach out and say hello!

Writing and publishing a book was\nonly ever going to cost money, not make money. I had to take time out of paid\nwork to do it. She only ever encouraged me to do this, and that’s pretty\namazing! Meagan also did a brilliant job editing this book — it simply\nwouldn’t be what it is without her. Her patience, input, revisions, and\ncontributions (as a web designer herself) made the content so much better —\nall for which I’m very grateful.\n\nAlso, thanks to our little family of cats! Fluffy, Theo, and Junior. I most\ncertainly wrote some of this book with Fluffy on my lap, Theo pressed into me\nby my side, or attempting to type while Junior, Fluffy, or Theo tried to sit\non the keyboard. Our little family of cats and my wife make me a happier\nperson. A happy, healthy mind helps you do your best work.\n\nI’d like to thank my amazing family: Mum, Ian, grandparents, uncles, aunties,\ncousins... everyone. Though I may live on a different continent to them now,\nthey shaped who I am — and have always been supportive in my crazy endeavours\nto live and work abroad. And thank you to my ‘new’ family in the United States\nwho have made me feel so welcome. I love you all.\n\nThanks to all my friends, internationally. Once upon a time, I virtually lived\nto work. It got me a long way in my career, but it never made me happy. One of\nthe most important lessons I’ve learned is to strike a good work/life balance.\nThe friends I’ve made along the way, in Yorkshire, Cornwall, London, and New\nYork have made me a happier, healthier, and stronger person. Though my liver\nmight not share the same view!\n\nProfessionally, almost everyone I’ve worked with has in some small or large\nway informed much of what I cover in this book. Good and bad, thank you for\nthe learning experiences.\n\nI’d like to specifically thank a few former work colleagues. Nick Stamas (03)\nis one of the rare people I’ve worked with whose talent and experimental\nnature pushed me to be better, learn, and grow. Working with Nick on\n\n\nAcknowledgments 291\n\ndesign systems informed a good deal of the content of this book — and for\nthat, he deserves huge credit and thanks. Also, thanks to Keaton Price (04),\nwho’s patient, systematic, and iterative approach to design problems (and\noffice politics) is inspiring — and something I held in mind a good few times\nwhile writing this book. And finally, Bobby Ghoshal (05), who set me on the\npath to discovering the Foundations Model and the idea of Digital Foundations.\nHe didn’t tell me what to do or how to do it. Instead, he freed me from the\nchains of my daily routine and encouraged me to do what would ultimately be\nsome of my best and most influential work to date.\n\nI’d like to thank Shane Mielke (06). The only part of this book process I knew\nhow to do was write. The rest was a mystery to me. Shane shared with me his\nstory of how he self-published his book, Launch It, and everything he’d\nlearned doing it.\n\nThank you to my good friend, Paul Davies (07). Paul took a chance on me early\nin my career, which proved to be a big turning point for me (08). 11 years\nlater, he kindly volunteered to proof-read this book, which I graciously\naccepted. It’s just a shame he hated it! Only joking :)\n\nAnd finally, thank you! It means a lot to me that you read my book. I hope you\nenjoyed it. If you found this book useful, I’d really appreciate it if you’d\nrecommend it to your friends, colleagues, and followers.\n\nIf I forgot you, I’m sorry, and thank you :)\n\n02 [owltastic.com](https://owltastic.com)\n\n03 [nickstamas.com](https://nickstamas.com/)\n\n04 [keaton.design](http://keaton.design/)\n\n05 [twitter.com/ghoshal](https://twitter.com/ghoshal)\n\n06 [shanemielke.com](http://shanemielke.com/)\n\n07 [bhvr.co.uk](http://www.bhvr.co.uk/)\n\n08 [medium.com/@andrewcouldwell/i-nearly-\nquit-42c246c15b74](https://medium.com/@andrewcouldwell/i-nearly-\nquit-42c246c15b74)\n\n\n292\n\nFor you, Dad\n\nI would like to dedicate this book to my dad, Michael Couldwell. I lost my dad\nto a short battle with cancer before my 30th birthday. It knocked me sideways.\nHe raised me to be competitive — for better or for worse. Much of my teen\nyears and young adulthood were spent trying to make my Dad proud. He never saw\nme leave England’s shores to live and work in New York City. He only caught a\nglimpse of my career taking off before that. He never got to meet my wife, or\nmy future kid. I often wonder how he’d feel about much of what I’ve done since\nhe left. I wrote a book! I’m proud of that. I think he would be too.\n\nSo this book’s for him. I love you, Dad.\n\n\nFin 293\n\nFin\n\n\n## Contents\n\n  1.
