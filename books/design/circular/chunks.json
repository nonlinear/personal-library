Since then the \ntypical response to industrial destruction has been to find a less \nbad approach. This approach has its own vocabulary, with \nwhich most of us are familiar: reduce, avoid, minimize, sustain, \nlimit, halt. These terms have long been centraJ to environmen-\ntal agendas, and they have become central to most of the envi-\nronmental agendas taken up by industry today. \nOne early dark messenger was Thomas Malthus, who \nwarned at the end of the eighteenth century that humans would \nreproduce exponentially, with devastating consequences for hu-\nmankind. Malthus's position was unpopular during the explo-\nsive excitement of early industry, when much was made of \nhumanity's potential for good, when its increasing ability to \nmold the earth to its own purposes was seen as largely con-\nstructive; and when even populati on growth was viewed as a \nboon. Malthus envisioned not great, gleaming advancement but \ndarkness, scarcity, pove1ty, and famine.

Coal, iron ore, rubber, and sand were brought in \non barges from the Great Lakes. Blast furnaces, smelters, and \nrolling and stamping mi lls worked around the clock to \nproduce the necessary materials. Working with Albert Kahn, \nhis architect, Ford oversaw the design of powerhouses, body \nshops, assembly buildings, tool and die shops, an array of \nstockpiles, warehouses, factories, and associated infrastruc-\nture. \n\"The Rouge\" was heralded as a marvel of manufacturing \nengineering and scale, and an emblem of modern industry. \nDuring the Depression, the factory even took on the job of tak-\ning apart used cars.

Did Bill think they \ncould apply the principles they'd been discussing to that \nplace-\nto go beyond recycling and \"efficiency\" to something \ntruly new and inspiring? In May, Ford publicly asked Bill to \nlead the redesign of the River Rouge, from the ground up. \nThe first step was to create a \"Rouge Room\" in the base-\nment of the company's headquarters, where the design learn-\nwhich included representatives of all sectors of the company, \nalong with outsiders like chemists, toxicologists, biologists, reg-\nulatory specialists, and union representatives-could come \ntogether. Their primary agenda was to create a set of goals, \nstrategies, and ways of measuring progress, but they also just \nneeded a setting that rendered visible their thinking process \nand encouraged them to raise the difficult questions.

We are wise to beware of our own motivations when \nchoosing materials, and we also can look for materials whose \n\"advertising\" matches t.heir insides, again as indicative of a \nbroader commitment to the issues that concern us. \nPrefer delight, celebration, and fun. Anot·her element we can at-\ntempt to assess-and perhaps the most readily apparent-\nis \npleasure or delight. It's very important for ecologically intelli-\ngent products to be at the forefront of human expression. They \ncan express the best of design creativity, adding pleasure and \ndelight to life. Certainly they can accomplish more than simply \nmaking the customer feel guilty or bad in some way while irn-\nrnediate decisions are being made. \nStep 3.

In the simplest terms, it is the most impor-\ntant issue of our times. How we systematically reverse the tide of wasteful-\nness and reduce carbon emissions must be at the forefront of our collective \nthinking as individuals, organizations, and institutions. For my part, I am \nconvinced the circular transformation is a sustainable path in decoupling \neconomic development from unsustainable resource consumption.\nSix years ago, Philips made a strategic decision to embed circular think-\ning throughout our business, as a competitive necessity, and with the con-\nviction that companies solving the problem of resource constraints will gain \nan advantage. The misconception is that circularity adds costs. My experi-\nence is that circular innovation unlocks new value by increasing customer \npreference and generating superior margins. Moreover, by ingraining green \nthinking with a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to meaning-\nful innovation, the culture and attractiveness of Philips as an employer and \npartner have benefitted immeasurably.\nIn many respects, the fundamental challenge remains. How do we embed \ncircularity in everything we do, while also bringing employees, customers \nand suppliers with us on this vital transformation? We set firm goals and \nambitious targets designed to stretch the boundaries of what we can achieve. \nIt is our objective to “close-the-loop” on all large medical equipment by \n2020. We will extend this to all medical equipment by 2025 and embed this \napproach throughout our consumer businesses.\n",

It has captured the imagination of business lead-\ners, emerging innovators, governments and cities, designers and academ-\nics around the world. The attractiveness of the idea is perhaps due to the \ncompelling inherent logic and economic rationale of the circular economy, \nas well as its value-creation possibilities and competitive advantages. At the \nsame time, the adverse impacts of the one-way, take-make-waste linear sys-\ntem are becoming starkly apparent. By 2050, the size of the global economy \nis projected to quadruple, and the world population is expected to increase \nto over 10 billion, with emerging markets accounting for two-thirds of \nglobal consumption. We now know that the negative impacts of the linear \neconomy in terms of waste, pollution, finite resource depletion, natural sys-\ntems degradation and climate change will, on current trend, be catastrophic.\nThe dire outlook of the linear economy in contrast to the opportunity \noffered by the circular economy has been clearly demonstrated through \nresearch by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and many others. The publi-\ncation of Waste to Wealth in 2015 provided important evidence of the value \ncreation potential, conservatively estimating this as a $4.5 trillion opportu-\nnity by 2030, through the adoption and scale-up across five key business \nmodels.

Fortunately, today we see a multitude of \nbusiness and social leaders embracing the aspirations of the Cradle to Cradle \ncircular economy, applying its principles to go beyond merely reducing, \nminimizing, and avoiding waste to approach the state of natural systems in \nwhich there is no waste at all.\nBefore the publication of Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make \nThings, in 2002, I had the privilege of working with companies who were \npioneers in this thinking, including furniture manufacturer Herman Miller \n(beginning in 1994) and flooring company Shaw Industries Group (1999). \nWe worked together on rethinking and, ultimately, redesigning products, \npractices, and even corporate visions and goals, setting a new standard for \nwhat was to come. From 2014 to 2016, I served as the inaugural chair of \nthe Global Meta-Council on the Circular Economy for the World Economic \nForum, which allowed me to see firsthand, and play a role, in the movement \ntoward wide-scale implementation of circular economy practices.\nThere has been amazing progress made over the past 25 years. Yet, if we \nconsider how most products are conceived and marketed today, it is clear \nthat we still have a long way to go. For example, companies and regulators \noften refer to a product’s “lifecycle” and its “end of life” to signal environ-\nmental responsibility. In fact, the “life” of a product is often a very short \nstory about sophisticated birth—attended by global supply chains—and \ncrude, even hazardous death in refuse piles; burial on land, in rivers, and \nat sea; or cremation in burn piles and toxic “waste to energy”’ plants.

They \nrepresent a fundamental shift in the first principle underlying the terms of \ncommerce itself. They move us beyond the simplistic, self-centered ques-\ntion, “How much can I get for how little I give?”—the quantification of eco-\nnomic value in a shrinking world of limits and fear—and instead put first \nthe richly informed and generous question, “How much can we give for \nall that we get?”—a new commercial qualification of human values in an \never-expanding world of abundance and hope.\nFrom my perspective, The Circular Economy Handbook: Realizing the \nCircular Advantage is an incredibly valuable tool.

By 2030, global demand \nis expected to increase 35% for food, 40% for water, and 50% for energy.3 \nThis competition for resources is set against a backdrop of persistent eco-\nnomic inequality and intensifying geopolitical tensions.4\nEven as we have become more efficient at extracting value from raw mate-\nrials, those improvements have not kept pace with the rise in consump-\ntion. The hard truth is this: We are now consuming about 1.75 times the \nearth’s carrying capacity, meaning we are using 75% more natural resources \nthan we are regenerating each year. This appetite for scarce resources is only \nexpected to grow in coming decades.5 For example, the production of mined \nmetal commodities is expected to jump 250% by 2030 to satisfy demand \nand other commodities are under similar pressure.6\nThis does not bode well, especially for two of our most precious \nresources: clean water and fresh air. According to the World Health \nOrganization (WHO), 785 million people currently lack access to drink-\ning water and, by 2025, fully half of the world’s population will be living in \na water-stressed area.7 Already about four billion people suffer from severe \nwater scarcity at least one month a year. The number of people at risk of \nfloods is predicted to rise from around 1.2 billion today to 1.6 billion in \n2050.8,9 In addition, ocean pollution is headed toward levels which until \nrecently were thought unimaginable by most of us: By 2050, there will be \nmore plastics (by weight) in the oceans than fish.10 The air we breathe is also \nunder assault. Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people a year, \na number equivalent to that of smoking tobacco, and air pollution-related \nmortality is escalating in most parts of the world.11,12\nWe’re also witnessing a devastating loss of biodiversity and habitat. Since \n1970, human activities have wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish, and \nreptiles, one-fifth of the world’s coral reefs, and 13 million hectares of \nforest.13,14 This loss could threaten the global food supply, with already \nabout one-fifth of the earth’s vegetated surface becoming less productive over \nthe past two decades.15 In 2017 alone, 39 million acres of tree cover was \nlost in the tropics. This is an area the size of Bangladesh, representing 40 \nfootball fields of trees every minute for the entire year.16 And in 2018, fires \nwere deliberately set in Indonesia to clear land for agriculture, resulting in \nthe destruction of over 10,000 square miles of forests, a blanket of toxic haze \nover large parts of Southeast Asia that lasted for weeks, illnesses of hundreds \nof thousands (and over 100,000 estimated deaths), and $30 billion in eco-\nnomic losses.17\nThen we come to climate change. Perhaps the most overarching and inter-\nlinked challenge with far-reaching social and environmental implications \n",

In October 2018, \na report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pre-\nsented details of a dire scenario: If global warming continues at the cur-\nrent rate, temperatures will likely increase by 1.5 °C between 2030 and \n2052, and the planet could potentially be three to five degrees warmer by \n2100.18,19 Unfortunately, there’s only about 12 years left to keep ­warming \nto even the 1.5 °C level. Any increase above that significantly raises the \nrisks of droughts, floods, extreme weather events, and poverty for hun-\ndreds of millions of people. According to an IPCC study, the estimated eco-\nnomic impact for a warming of 1.5 °C by 2100 would be $54 trillion. For a \nwarming of 2 °C, it would be $69 trillion.20 The bottom line is that urgent \nchanges are necessary to head off disaster.\nAnother core macro-trend which has a ripple effect across all other trends, \nis the unprecedented technological change we have witnessed in the Fourth \nIndustrial Revolution (4IR), characterized by various technologies such \nas machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), that are disrupting just \nabout every industry across the globe. 4IR is unlike past industrial revolu-\ntions because of the breadth, pace, and scale of new technologies that have \nthe potential to decouple growth from resource use. Disruptive technologies, \nas we explore in this book, play a key role as an amplifier in scaling and \nmaking circular business models more effective and efficient. However, to \nachieve these benefits, the technologies must be deployed with intent and \nmanaged properly to minimize any unintended consequences, including \nadverse environmental impacts, the displacement of employees, the risks of \ncyberthreats, and ethical concerns.\nHeeding the Call to Action\nThe scale of the challenge is undeniable, but the outlook isn’t all bleak. In \nthe past few years, we have reached an inflection point on climate change, \nfor instance. Around the world, organizations and individuals are waking \nup to the fact that we are heading toward irreparable damage. Fortunately, \nthere is now growing recognition that climate action is critical to long-\nterm socio-economic success, and many governments have been heeding \nthe call to action. To date, 185 parties have ratified the Paris Agreement, \nwhich aims to keep global warming this century to well below 2 °C above \nthe pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature \nincrease further to 1.5 °C.21 In addition, businesses have been joining the \nbattle, with many of the world’s largest and most influential companies \n",

The fossil-fuels divestment campaign has grown \nfrom $50 billion worth of assets (from 181 institutions) in 2014 to nearly \n$8 trillion (from more than 1000 institutions) at the end of 2018.23 Public \nactivism has also been on the rise, especially among the young. Almost half \nof 18- to 24-year-olds identified environmental issues as one of our three \nmost pressing concerns, compared with 27% of the general population.24 In \n2019, hundreds of thousands of students in more than 1600 cities joined a \nclassroom strike to bring attention to climate change issues.25\nBroadening Beyond Climate\nAs concern over climate change has intensified, the focus has spread toward \nbroader issues of sustainability and resource usage. While it’s critical to focus \non reducing carbon emissions through means such as energy ­efficiency, \nzero-carbon production, and renewable energy, focusing only on the pro-\nduction and consumption of energy solves for just half of global green-\nhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, it is equally important to address \nhow we manufacture and use products, which comprises the remaining \nhalf (approximately) of GHG emissions.26,27 That calls for a transformation \nacross the entire economic system. Nothing less will meet the urgency of \nthe moment, if the world is to achieve the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) by 2030 and stay within the boundaries underlined by the \nParis Agreement.28 Promisingly, various stakeholder groups are increasing \nfocus on the health and well-being of our planet and its inhabitants. There \nhas been particular concern about the volume and rate of extraction of natu-\nral resources, and the irresponsible usage (overconsumption) and disposal of \nproducts and materials.

Wrong. These are business \nissues both directly and indirectly. Turning from the macro-trends, we look \nat the microeconomics and the business strategies available to leaders. We \nknow that achieving such ambitious goals will not be easy. But the flip side \nof every challenge is an opportunity. The global economy depends on busi-\nness stepping up in the face of global pressures, with new forms of inno-\nvation and value creation. The “circular” economy offers a powerful way \nforward: a massive transformation from the traditional “linear” ways of \ndoing business to new principles of circularity (see “The Linear Versus the \nCircular Economy”). In essence, companies must reject the “take, make, \nwaste” approach in favor of keeping products and resources in use for as \nlong as possible and, at end of use, cycling (or “looping”) their components \nand materials back into the system in zero-waste value chains. In other \nwords, a circular economy eliminates the concept of waste altogether, fun-\ndamentally changing the way we produce and consume, creating a healthier, \nthriving ecosystem that circulates value throughout the economy and soci-\nety. In doing so, it fundamentally decouples economic growth from resource \nusage and recouples economic growth with societal progress—presenting a \nmuch-needed solutions framework for tackling our global challenges.\n  The Linear Versus the Circular Economy\nA linear economy refers to the traditional industrial model that follows a \n“take, make, waste” process in which raw materials are extracted, turned into \nproducts, and after being used or consumed, the products are typically thrown \naway as non-recyclable waste (or at most, they are recycled or downcycled). \nThis is our mainstream economic model today.\nIn a circular economy, growth is decoupled from the consumption of scarce \nresources. Products and materials are kept within productive use for as long \nas possible, and when they reach end of use, they are effectively cycled (or \nlooped) back into the system. Arriving at true circularity means rethinking and \n",

The circular and continuous flow of \nboth technical and biological materials through “value circles” is illustrated by \nThe Circular Economy Systems Diagram (see Fig. 1.1).\nFig. 1.1  Circular economy systems diagram34 (Source Ellen MacArthur \nFoundation, SUN, and McKinsey Center for Business and Environment; Drawing \nfrom Braungart & McDonough, Cradle to Cradle [C2C])\nMoving to a circular economy has the potential to do more than deliver the \ndisruptive changes needed to secure a sustainable future. It will also open excit-\ning new possibilities for businesses to enter new markets with innovative prod-\nucts and services, clearing the path to long-term growth. Equally important, it \nis an opportunity for companies to rethink the resource use of their operations \nand supply chains and the associated contribution to their cost base. Further \nbenefits include the impact on brand, trust, and reputation that comes with \nclarity of purpose in attracting talent or delighting consumers. In short, the \ncircular economy can help protect the environment and address societal chal-\nlenges while also enabling organizations to achieve competitive advantage.\nThat advantage will be based on finding ways to not just balance but pos-\nitively connect and reinforce the three foundational components of the new \nframework of competitive agility as defined by Accenture: growth and cus-\ntomers, profitability, and sustainability and trust (see Fig. 1.2).33\n",

But competitive advantage is about fundamentally reengi-\nneering the business. More must be done to reach the full value potential \nof the circular economy.\nSo, what’s needed? We found that true impact and scale will only be deliv-\nered when companies deploy circular business models and Fourth Industrial \nRevolution (4IR) technologies in a holistic manner to capture new growth \nopportunities while also strengthening their core business (see “What is the \nFourth Industrial Revolution?”). We refer to this as a “wise pivot”—a term \nthat our colleagues Omar Abbosh, Paul Nunes, and Larry Downes have \nwritten extensively about in the context of digital transformation in particu-\nlar.36 To accomplish that pivot within the circular context, companies must \ndo three things simultaneously: (1) transform the existing value chain to \nremove waste and increase efficiencies to drive up investment capacity, (2) \ngrow the core business organically by embedding circular offerings to sustain \nthe fuel for investments, and (3) invest in and scale entirely new, disruptive \ncircular businesses.\n  What Is the Fourth Industrial Revolution?\nThe First Industrial Revolution used water and steam power to mechanize \nproduction. The Second Industrial Revolution relied on electric power to cre-\nate mass production. The Third Industrial Revolution deployed electronics \nand information technology to automate production. Now a Fourth Industrial \nRevolution is building on the third, the digital revolution that has been occur-\nring since the middle of the last century. It is characterized by a fusion of tech-\nnologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological \nspheres. The diversity and combinatorial potential of these technologies has \nthe power to bring about constant, exponential change to businesses and to \nsocieties around the world.37\nOf course, we recognize this is not simple nor straightforward, but the \nstakes couldn’t be higher. Not only are we talking about the creation of \nan economic system that puts people and nature first, we are also refer-\nring to enormous economic value at risk of not being captured. In Waste \nto Wealth, Accenture estimated this value at $4.5 trillion by 2030. This \nis between 4 and 5% of the projected global Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP), more than the entire German economy today (the world’s fourth \n",

In fact, this estimate is probably fairly conservative. \nIt assumes that we have until 2050 to get to a “one-planet economy”; it \nexpects that we can continue to become more efficient at extracting value \nfrom resources; and it does not account for the likely cascading effects that \nresource shortages would have on the global economy.\nBased on our experience, our extensive research, and our close work with \nour partners at the World Economic Forum, we know that the opportunity \nis not only huge but entirely within reach. The bottom line is that we have \njust a decade to make substantial progress toward a circular transition, much \nof which must be pioneered by the private sector. Considerable investments \nare needed to implement and scale circular solutions, and the time to act is \nnow. But how, exactly, should companies proceed?\nThe Way Forward\nGiven the seriousness of these challenges, there’s been no shortage of pro-\nposed solutions and approaches, leading to considerable confusion for many \ncompanies. Do businesses need to completely overhaul themselves, revamp \neverything from top to bottom, or would less drastic changes suffice? We \nbelieve both transformation and incremental change will need to happen \nin parallel, given that some organizations are ready to disrupt and move fast \nwhile others need to move more slowly. The purpose of The Circular Economy \nHandbook is not to advise companies where on the spectrum they should fall, \nbut to bring a deep level of pragmatism to all organizations, regardless of their \nstarting point. The book, therefore, is designed as a practical guide to support \nexecutives with useful strategies and actionable insights through illustration of \nour key learnings and numerous case studies. The goal is for readers to learn \nhow to scale the circular economy within their organizations and drive com-\npetitive advantage throughout their value chains. For easy referral, we have \norganized The Circular Economy Handbook in three major sections:\nPart I.

We also identify the \nfive key enablers that are crucial to accelerate adoption: consumer engage-\nment, design, reverse logistics, disruptive technologies, and ecosystems. \nWe then highlight the disruptive technologies of the Fourth Industrial \nRevolution that are essential for circular impact. These technologies fall \ninto three categories—digital, physical, and biological—and can enable the \ncircular business models through increased efficiency, greater innovation, \nenhanced information transparency, and reduced reliance on resource-inten-\nsive materials, especially when the technologies are used in combination.\nPart II. Where Do We Need to Be?—Scaling  \nIndustry Impact\nThe circular economy cuts across our entire economic system, but each indus-\ntry has unique challenges and will experience the transition differently. In this \nsection, we provide a profile on 10 major industries, identifying their big-\ngest waste pools and challenges, along with the areas that present the greatest \nopportunities. We also highlight examples of enabling technologies and obsta-\ncles for players in the industry to overcome in their circular journey. In addi-\ntion, we examine strategies for how leading companies can realize the value in \ntheir bottom line with a set of initiatives to illustrate the scale of impact that \ncan be attained by incorporating circularity within an industry value chain. \nWe hope that by providing profiles on a range of industries, one can learn \nleading practices that cut across different sectors of the economy.\nPart III. How Do We Get There?—Making the Pivot\nCompanies need to learn how to implement and scale circular initiatives. \nThis requires the transformation and growth of the core business, while scal-\ning new initiatives in parallel. To accomplish that, organizations must imple-\nment a “wise pivot” and they need to advance their circular maturity across \nfour dimensions:36\n•\t Operations: Addressing the value lost through operations and by-products \nof business processes with respect to energy, emissions, water, and waste.\n•\t Products & Services: Rethinking the design, lifecycle, and end of use of a \nproduct or service to optimize its usage, eliminate waste, and close prod-\nuct loops.\n",

Essentially, the models \ncover the full value chain of circularity. Circular Inputs focus on the “ingre-\ndients” that go into products at the design, sourcing, and manufacturing \nstages. These inputs, such as renewable resources, aim to eliminate wasted \nresources (including toxic and single-use materials) and are a stepping stone \nfor all other models. In some of the more advanced examples, Circular \nInputs can go beyond zero-waste to be resource-additive (e.g., where waste \nstreams are processed into material streams). Product Use Extension focuses \non maximizing the use of a product. To do so, companies must start from \nthe very beginning (specifically, product design and responsible sourcing) \nin order to avoid wasted lifecycles and keep products in use for as long as \npossible. In addition, Product Use Extension plays an important role in ena-\nbling the Product as a Service and Sharing Platforms models. The latter two \ngo further by reinventing “product utility” in entirely new ways (e.g., buy-\ning a function or service, like mobility, rather than the product itself—a \nvehicle). This in turn incentivizes companies to derive the maximum value \nand utilization out of products, addressing wasted capacity and wasted \n­lifecycles. Once a product reaches end of use, the role of Resource Recovery is \nto return the embedded materials or energy back into the production cycle, \nthereby “closing the loop” of the product from sourcing to usage and back \nto sourcing.\nAs discussed in the Introduction, the ultimate goal of the circular econ-\nomy is a holistic closure of the entire “take, make, waste” cycle. Obviously, \nachieving that ambitious target will require a long-term massive shift in the \ncurrent way of doing business, but significant progress can be made over the \nshort term by focusing on multiple localized value pools. Specifically, within \nany circular value chain “loop”, companies can focus on closing multiple \n“mini-loops” (see Fig. 2.2); for example, a waste stream from one produc-\ntion step could be re-processed into a useful by-product, or the feedstock for \nanother process could come from a secondary material source. Consider the \ngrowing use of food production waste as a source of energy for the facility in \nwhich it is produced. Downstream, there are additional marketplace-related \nmini-loops that help consumers resell used products, from toys and clothing \nto boats and semi-tractors. These loops can cross-industry boundaries (one \nindustry using the waste of another industry as an input) and geographies, \npresenting numerous opportunities for the adoption of the five circular busi-\nness models across the global economy.\nTo tap into those opportunities, executives need to understand the five \ncircular business models in greater detail.

To implement it, an organization must replace a “linear” type \nof resource in its supply chain with a “circular” alternative. These solutions \ncan be broadly categorized into three groups:\n•\t Renewable resources: Inputs that replenish naturally and can be used \nrepeatedly, e.g., water from rain harvesting or desalination processes, wind \nand solar energy, hydrogen fuel from excess renewable energy, etc.\n•\t Renewable bio-based materials: Materials such as bioplastics and micro-\nbial agrochemical solutions that are developed from chemistry derived \nfrom living organisms.\n•\t Renewable man-made materials: Engineered materials based on non-or-\nganic chemistry that can be recycled infinitely without a substantial loss \nof quality or physical properties.\nIn the short to medium term, a company should identify, prioritize, and \nimplement the substitution of production inputs with circular alternatives \nwhere operationally and commercially viable. In the long term though, the \ngoal is to close and dematerialize resource loops completely, thereby elim-\ninating waste, in a continuous collaboration with a broad spectrum of \ncross-industry and cross-sector stakeholders. In other words, the first part of \nthe Circular Inputs journey is about phasing out the use of “linear” resources \n(and waste), whereas the second stage tosses out the concept of waste alto-\ngether as part of a holistic change to production systems.\nTo date, the adoption of Circular Inputs has largely been driven by the \nreplacement of linear feedstocks, such as non-renewable or recyclable \nresources, with alternatives that have a lesser environmental impact. Amid \nthat activity, legislation and subsidies aimed at “greening” the economy have \nemerged and become mainstream, with the growing prominence of environ-\nmental sustainability in the public dialogue (e.g., the EU’s ban of single-use \nplastics and bee-harming pesticides).2 Below we discuss two areas that have \n",

As a result, renewables will be the fastest-growing energy \nsource in the electricity sector, forecasted to make up over 70% of global \nelectricity generation growth from 2017 to 2023.3 That progress aside, we \nneed to reduce or eliminate our reliance on carbon-intensive sources such as \nfossil fuels at a much faster pace. Unfortunately, several barriers, including \ntechnological and financial limitations, inhibit the deployment of renewable \nenergy in new markets, while integrating renewable generation into the grid \ncontinues to be an obstacle in established markets.4 Multinational organi-\nzations with heavy energy footprints can lead the way and should consider \nscaling investments in renewable energy capacity as part of their long-term \nenergy strategies.\nMaterial Innovation\nFor years, formal and informal media sources have been exposing the envi-\nronmental damage caused by various material streams—from chlorofluor-\nocarbons in the 1990s to microplastic pollution more recently—leading \nto heightened public concerns and an awareness of the need for regulatory \naction. At the same time, resource scarcity has impacted most sectors, from \ncotton to gold to rare earth minerals. The result has been a tangible increase \nin research and development activity in the search for alternative solutions, \nas well as a push by established companies to patent and commercialize new \ncircular materials for inclusion in their future production.5 Take, for exam-\nple, Sulapac, a Finnish packaging material manufacturing company, and its \nbiodegradable packaging solution made from wood chips and natural bind-\ners as an alternative to traditional single-use packaging made from petrole-\num-based plastic.6\nUltimately, to be successful, a material innovation must be more than \njust circular; it also needs to satisfy other criteria, including quality stand-\nards and cost parity. As such, when considering a new material, companies \nshould focus on functionality, usability, and reusability, and the volume \nrequirements needed to help achieve cost parity.

To help \nin that analysis, innovations such as the so-called material passports can \n­provide information about materials throughout the lifecycle, facilitating \nrecovery at end of use.7 A material passport contains data associated with \na specific product, including the characteristics of that item’s materials, \nthat facilitate the recovery, recycling, or reuse of those resources. To further \naccelerate the transition to more circular inputs, organizations need to look \nbeyond organizational borders, assessing systemic material flows, opportu-\nnities, and barriers. For example, TriCiclos, a circular economy engineering \ncompany, through its waste management divisions in Latin America, lever-\naged its recycling infrastructure network to analyze waste, and that informa-\ntion has helped companies like PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company to \nredesign their packaging and to develop new materials.8 Engaging with the \ncircular economy at this level requires a culture of collaboration with suppli-\ners, peers, partners, and customers. We will describe this in greater detail in \nthe subsequent chapters on organizational culture and ecosystems.\n  Case Study: Nike \nNike, a multinational footwear and apparel company, has achieved a \nnumber of successes in material innovation with its own Nike Grind \nmaterials, which generate inputs for new footwear, apparel, and surfaces in sport \nfacilities.9 Using a collection of “waste” materials (recycled athletic footwear \nand surplus manufacturing scraps), the company has been able to develop new \nhigh-performance products. Roughly, 73% of all Nike shoes and apparel contain \nsome recycled material, while 98.2% of manufacturing waste is diverted from \nlandfills.10 Nike’s Flyleather material, for example, is made with at least 50% recy-\ncled natural leather fiber from leather scraps, with a similar look, feel, and even \nsmell of virgin leather.11 Moreover, the material allows for a more efficient cut-\nting process, generating less waste compared with traditional leather. Even more \nimpressive, 100% of the polyester fibers in Flyknit yarn is recycled.12\n  Sharing Platforms\nThe utilization rates of products and assets are optimized through shared owner-\nship, access, and usage typically enabled by digital technologies.\nA Sharing Platform enables owners to maximize how assets are used, while \nbuilding a community and providing customers with affordable and conven-\nient access to products and services.

Getting consensus on the strategy, format, functionality, \nand business model demands a good amount of exploration and finetun-\ning, especially for more risk-averse, established businesses. Consequently, \nmultinational corporations are slower to embrace this model. Instead, start-\nups have led the way, radically disrupting their respective industries in the \nbusiness-to-consumer (B2C) market (e.g., home and ride-sharing platforms \nlike Airbnb, Lyft, and ZipCar) and local small businesses. Over the last few \nyears, though, Sharing Platforms have begun to make inroads with big mul-\ntinationals as well. Marriott, one of the world’s largest hotel chains, recently \nlaunched Homes & Villas, an Airbnb competitor for premium home-share \nrentals, while a number of the established rent-a-car companies, including \nAvis and Enterprise, currently offer “car sharing.”14,15,16 At present, Sharing \nPlatforms have proliferated throughout numerous industries, from fash-\nion and accessories to shared workspaces, tools, and machinery, including \nmany examples in the business-to-business space (B2B). In fact, B2B sharing \nmight present the most promising opportunities for large corporations, espe-\ncially for businesses which maintain high-cost assets that have low utilization \nrates. For example, Cohealo is a platform for hospitals to share and maxi-\nmize the efficient use of medical equipment.17\nIn emerging markets, the increased penetration of smartphones has cre-\nated a strong launchpad for sharing services. India and China, for example, \nhave seen a surge of Sharing Platforms with companies like RentSher and \nDidi Chuxing Technology.19,20 Smart Factory Kunshan (SFK), a joint ven-\nture between a local government in Jiangsu Province and a German firm, \nhelps around 30 early-stage companies access shared production and assem-\nbly facilities in their start-up factory, demonstrating adoption rates that, in \nsome cases, are higher than in developed economies.21,22 This isn’t surpris-\ning, considering that much of the dramatic expansion in the global middle \nclass over the next several years will occur in Asia.23 Consumers in these \neconomies increasingly desire services that offer convenience, customization, \nand cost-savviness, resulting in the growing adoption of Sharing Platforms. \nAccelerating urbanization—characterized by high population density, \n",

The platform enables custom-\ners to rent out and manage different types of equipment aggregated nationally \nthrough one digital channel, matching idle assets with new demand and improving \nthe productivity of less efficient industry processes (e.g., booking equipment with \nrental depots over the phone). The service, which includes heavy-duty equipment \nas well as smaller handheld tools, is a one-stop shop for entire construction sites. \nOn average, eRENT customers save 20% on equipment and machinery costs, thanks \nto various technologies including Internet of Things (IoT) tracking.18\n  Product as a Service\nCompanies retain ownership of a product and sell its benefits on a service basis while \nremaining responsible for the good’s maintenance and treatment at end of use.\nWith the Product as a Service business model, products are used by one or \nmore customers through a lease or pay-for-use arrangement. This approach \nturns the incentive for product durability and upgrading upside-down, \nshifting companies’ focus from volume (i.e., selling “widgets”) to perfor-\nmance (i.e., selling the function of that widget). Popular examples include \ntire company Michelin’s pay-by-the-mile model for cargo fleets and lighting \ncompany Signify’s offering, Light-as-a-Service (LaaS).25 Product as a Service \nmodels are based on the premise that companies can generate additional \nvalue from their products by developing long-term relationships with cus-\ntomers, selling additional services (cross-selling or upselling), monetizing \nusage data, or extracting material value at the end-of-use stage.\nDespite the increased potential for value generation, the uptake of the \nProduct as a Service model at scale remains limited. Certainly, the shift from \nselling a product to selling a service is a fundamental change in a compa-\nny’s value proposition that introduces a host of complexities. For one \nthing, the “servitization” of a product involves the design, planning, and \nroll-out of multiple additional capabilities, from customer-service desks \nand account managers to the collection and reverse logistics systems, at the \nvery least. Accordingly, companies need to invest in building out those key \ncapabilities, and the potential costs associated with those efforts need to be \n",

In addition, data own-\nership concerns can act as a deterrent for potential customers, especially in \nthe business-to-business space, where operational data can offer a significant \ncompetitive advantage.\nFor these reasons, early-stage firms are currently better placed to imple-\nment a Product as a Service model as they tend to be more agile, less risk-\naverse, and better positioned to more quickly engage customers and tailor \ntheir branding. A critical success factor is developing accounting models that \nbetter align to products which are used as a service by several customers, \nrather than a one-time purchase by a single customer. Such models require \na firm to adjust traditional financial expectations to account for longer \nlifecycles, product ownership and depreciation, takeback, servicing, and \nevaluation of how the residual value of an asset at the end of its life is inte-\ngrated into business accounting records. In some cases, it may even warrant \nthe establishment of a new venture and product range designed with the \nbusiness model in mind.\nThe subscription model is a clear disrupter within Product as a Service. \nSpurred by the success of subscription-based services in the entertainment \nindustry, adoption has now shifted to fashion, food, and grooming products. \nOverall, subscription-based services are growing at a rate of 200% annually \nsince 2011, supported by an explosion in product variety and a more seamless \nexperience unleashed by digital technologies.26 The model works particularly \nwell for premium goods that are highly desirable but not easily affordable, \nespecially where product obsolescence is a significant factor. Consumer elec-\ntronics are a prime example of such market dynamics, leading to the emer-\ngence of companies such as Grover, which rents cell phones, drones, gaming \ngear, and other electronics devices.27 While the subscription model raises \nquestions about over-consumption and excess choice, we believe models that \nappropriately handle returns, use-extension and next-use will be the winners \nin balancing consumer demand, affordability, and environmental impact.\nProduct as a Service models at scale remain a challenge for traditional \nbusinesses and companies focused on quarterly and annual financial perfor-\nmance. Compelling business case evidence would help organizations bet-\nter understand the model’s benefits (both tangible and intangible) and the \nfinancial re-engineering required (e.g., the change in cash flows, balance \nsheet extensions, credit risk considerations, and long-term uncertainty). \nExternally, engagement with customers and close collaboration in the service \ndevelopment is crucial.\n",

Rent  \nthe Runway also offers subscription plans, where consumers pay a monthly fee \nto continuously refresh their wardrobe, and the plans include free shipping, \ndry cleaning, and rental insurance.

Consider, \nfor example, how often a mobile phone is replaced for an upgraded model, \nwhen all that’s really needed is an update to a core feature like the camera or \nbattery. Product Use Extension is applied during or at the end of the product’s \nfirst use. Instead of being disposed of, landfilled, or at best recycled, the item is \nrepaired/reconditioned/updated to extend its use, or it is given a second use in \na marketplace for used products. The business model encompasses a number \nof activities—from repairing, refurbishing, and upgrading, to trading in and \nreselling—some of which can be viewed as business models in their own right.\nAn advantage of Product Use Extension is that it does not require a wholesale \nchange to a company’s existing business model but rather an extension of busi-\nness capabilities or market channels so that, for example, new revenue streams \ncan be generated through resale. Importantly, by engaging people to extend \nthe use of products they own, companies are able to create additional touch \npoints with their customer base. This enhances customer centricity, develops \nbrand loyalty, and supports the acquisition of additional product feedback. \nAccording to Rick Ridgeway, Patagonia’s VP of Public Engagement, “Our \nrepair facility is the largest in North America, completing more than 70,000 \nrepairs in 2018 alone.” Furthermore, adds Ridgeway, “The Worn Wear plat-\nform has attracted new customers to buy Patagonia clothing at a reduced price \nand strengthened our brand through stronger ties to existing customers.

Take Vitsoe, for example, a furniture design company \nthat sells a “Universal Shelving System,” a modular and upgradeable shelving \nsystem that is designed to be long-lasting and upgradeable with new shelves, \ndrawers, and other additions and can be easily dismantled and re-built.31\nOther innovations are emerging across a variety of industries, including \nelectronics, fashion, and furniture. In the fashion industry, adoption has \nlargely been driven by premium brands or by companies like clothing retail \ncompany H&M that is implementing models that shift the design criteria \nfor clothing to focus more on quality, longevity, and the resale of used items \nto environmentally conscious consumers—for example, H&M launched a \npilot in Sweden to sell second-hand clothing.32 As a result, the fashion resale \nmarket is estimated to be growing 24 times faster than traditional retail.33 \nThe world’s biggest producer of affordable design furniture, IKEA, is also \nmaking strides with Product Use Extension models. In France and Belgium, \nthe company’s “Second Life for Furniture” initiative lets customers exchange \nold items for a store voucher.34 IKEA also leases office furniture to enterprise \nclients in Switzerland and is piloting the sale of used furniture in the UK. \nThe leasing scheme will be expanded to many more countries by 2020.35\n  Case Study: Schneider Electric \nThe French multinational energy management company Schneider \nElectric extends the use of its switchboards by replacing switchgear \ncomponents at the customer site to renew, upgrade, or add new functionalities. \nExtending the usefulness of equipment can save up to 65% of the cost of new \ninstallations. Returned switchboards and accessories can be reused and obsolete \ncomponents can be refurbished, repaired, or recycled to minimize waste. For \nexample, the switchgear housing, plugs, lights, switches, and extra cabinets can \nbe reused, and cables and wires can be kept for future use. This results in the \nprevention of carbon dioxide emissions (40 tonnes, equivalent to 8 cars traveling \naround the world) and a reduction in water (389 kiloliters, equivalent to 7 years \nof water consumption for an average European consumer) and energy intensity \n(750,000 megajoules, equivalent to 135 barrels of oil).36\n",

Companies are recovering everything from \nvaluable metal from electronic waste, to plastic from packaging and even \ncigarette butts, in the pursuit of generating value from waste streams and \nmanufacturing by-products. Given that most organizations have some form \nof a waste management strategy, this model requires minimal adaptation of \nexisting business structures and is less disruptive than others.\nEven so, the untapped potential for scaling existing solutions is still con-\nsiderable, from increasing the quantity of collected and processed waste to \nimproving the quality of the recycled output or by-products. In general, the \npresent-day economics and technological capabilities (e.g., for sorting or dis-\nassembly) have limited the amount and type of resources that can be recov-\nered under business-as-usual operations. Collection and separation remain \ncostly, and the existing waste-related infrastructure is often ill-equipped \nto serve the quantity or quality requirements of buyers. But as technology \nimproves (and costs fall), as data become more abundant, and as new inno-\nvative solutions automate what previously was labor intensive, organizations \nwill be looking into recovering (and obtaining a greater value of) increas-\ning volumes of wasted resources. Resource Recovery models will also gain \nwider adoption thanks to resource shortages and regulatory changes, such \nas Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) levies that require companies to \nbe responsible for the treatment and disposal of their products, as well as \nincreasing consumer pressure to address waste issues. For their part, busi-\nnesses need to provide incentives to engage consumers, encourage product \nreturns, and foster long-term behavioral change. The incentives could be \nfinancial, such as technology company Apple’s GiveBack program (for elec-\ntronics products) and the reGAIN App (for clothing), through which cus-\ntomers can turn in their used products for credit and discount vouchers that \ncan be applied against future purchases.37,38\n  Case Study: Veolia \nVeolia, a water, waste, and energy management solutions company, \nhelps its clients to better manage their waste and to recover valua-\nble resources at end of use.

As part of that project, Veolia engineered a way to recycle fibers from \nused coffee cups so that the resulting material could be used as the main input \nfor the production of the store’s classic yellow bags, tripling recycling rates \nfrom 15% to 55% and delivering 100% diversion from landfill.39\nAccelerating the Transition\nAs highlighted in the previous section, the five business models are being \ndeployed by companies, but numerous barriers are impeding the rate and \nscale of that adoption. To overcome those obstacles, companies must devote \ntime and attention to the following five key enablers.\nConsumer Engagement: Re-Shape What It Means \nto Consume\n“People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch \nhole!” This widely quoted statement, from Theodore Levitt of the Harvard \nBusiness School, highlights that it isn’t the products themselves that cus-\ntomers need, but the service or experience they provide. In other words, \nproducts, in many cases, are merely the delivery mechanism for a desired \nfunction or outcome. New, need-based business models such as Sharing \nPlatforms and Product as a Service support this transition from ownership to \naccess. This shift will become increasingly important for many businesses, as \nmore and more consumers begin seeking products and services that they can \naccess at the tap of a finger.\nAnother consideration is shifting demand preferences, with 66% of con-\nsumers globally stating they are willing to pay more for sustainable brands.40 \nIndeed, over the past few years, there has been a growing public awareness \nof global climate and waste challenges. Accelerated by international dia-\nlogues, extreme weather events, and mainstream media coverage, awareness \ncampaigns around waste production, disposal, and carbon dioxide emissions \nhave become commonplace across multiple industries. This has had a large \nimpact on the consciousness of a growing number of consumers, leading to \nvarious actions such as the banning of single-use plastic bags at supermar-\nkets. It is worth noting though that consumer interest or intent does not \nalways lead to changes in purchasing behavior, as cost and quality remain \nkey factors for consumer purchasing decisions.\n",

Lacy et al.\nMoreover, the environmental impact of a company’s choices is not \nalways easy to understand, requiring organizations to raise levels of trans-\nparency and communication. Adam Lowry, Co-Founder of Ripple Foods, \nthe dairy alternatives company, explains that, although there is growing \nawareness around topics like plastic waste, there is little understanding \naround the details. “A lot of biodegradable packaging is simply litter, but \nconsumer perception is that plastic is evil,” says Lowry. “There is a mis-\nmatch in understanding what the best circular materials are, and it’s a chal-\nlenge to change consumer perception.” The approach at Ripple Foods is to \nbe completely transparent with how the company makes decisions from \na circular economy standpoint and to create feedback loops to improve \nover time. According to Lowry, “This is a different approach from other \nbrands that simply add a label. Sometimes, branding can create a false \nsense of understanding with consumers. We try to float indicators of how \nwe’ve made responsible choices, referencing primary scientific research, and \nwe invite consumers to examine how we’ve made choices.” As companies \nlike Ripple demonstrate, educating consumers is important from a corpo-\nrate responsibility perspective and can also help increase brand trust and \nengagement.\nDesign: Plan for Product Circularity\nUntil recently, product designs have typically failed to consider end-of-use \nscenarios as a key input. Since design sits at the start of a product’s lifecycle— \nand circularity, for many, has focused on end of use—it has been a bar-\nrier, preventing the efficient use of products and hindering the recovery \nof their embedded materials at high quality. The majority of low-to-mid \nvalue products are designed for short-term use only, often with built-in \nobsolescence. Take, for instance, a simple cleaning spray bottle. The prod-\nuct might be labeled to indicate that it can be recycled, but the body of \nthe bottle might be made of multiple polymer structures that are unfeasi-\nble to separate, and the metallic spring inside the bottle cannot be easily \nremoved for reuse or recycling. Obsolescence is also an issue for high-value \nproducts, such as consumer electronics, where design features like seam-\nless edges make disassembly particularly difficult. Given the rapid pace of \ntechnology changes, obsolescence is likely to remain a considerable chal-\nlenge in the coming years, highlighting the need for more circular design \n­practices (see Table 2.1).\n",

We are always seeking ways to make \nour products easy to repair and disassemble, and that starts with design.” In \ncontrast, few mass-produced, retail-distributed products are designed with \ncircular and disassembly considerations. With increasing Extended Producer \nResponsibility (EPR) legislation, however, such products are slowly gaining \nthe attention of designers and innovation departments at leading organiza-\ntions. Still, for the majority of those items, current marketplace econom-\nics do not yet encourage circular designs. What’s needed is a systemic shift \nacross the product value spectrum.\nOnce design has been adapted for the disassembly and reuse of products, \nengaging in Resource Recovery activities can become an attractive business \nopportunity. To give an example, Scandinavian industrial group Moelven \noffers building walls as part of interior solutions that can be taken apart and \nre-assembled for a different design without requiring any new materials.42 \nGiven the increasing global volume of waste streams, the use of secondary \nmaterials poses a significant sourcing opportunity. Consider the following: \n40% of the plastics produced is packaging, used only once and then dis-\ncarded.43 If such waste streams can be turned into secondary materials, then \nalternative sourcing channels could become strategically relevant. Sony’s \nelectronics products & solutions segment, for instance, uses up to 99% of \nrecycled plastics in its electronics. An advantage of incorporating these fea-\ntures into design is that plastics can easily be used multiple times which, \nin turn, has the added benefit of lowering the carbon dioxide emissions in \nSony’s TV production by 80%.44\nReverse Logistics: Create Takeback Loops\nTackling infrastructure gaps so that manufacturers can receive idle, \nunwanted, damaged, underutilized, or end-of-use products is a priority for \nscaling circular economy models. Reverse logistics present a key capability, \nimportant for nearly all circular business models, particularly Product as a \nService, Sharing Platforms, Product Use Extension, and Resource Recovery. This \nis not limited to the collection and aggregation of products and material, \nbut extends to value-adding activities such as sorting, separating, reprocess-\ning, and remarketing. It also includes links to requirements such as value \nchain tracing capability (to identify and document specific material content) \nand relevant waste regulations such as cross-border waste handling and EPR \nlegislation.\n",

It hosts the same set of challenges as forward logistics, e.g., informa-\ntion, infrastructure, and capacity constraints; high warehousing and inventory \ncosts; last-mile optimization challenges; and rising customer expectations on \ndelivery speed. In addition, it presents an entirely different layer of complex-\nity linked to the unpredictability of supply (both quantity and quality), the \nmechanisms to incentivize returns, and often the inadequate national and \ninternational networks for resource recovery. To address such issues, logistics \ncompany DHL partnered with Cranfield University in the UK and the Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation, a charity focused on supporting the transition to the \ncircular economy, to develop the Reverse Logistics Maturity Model which \nstructures key problem categories and potential solution approaches into \nthree product-based archetypes: low-value Extended Producer Responsibility, \nservice parts logistics, and advanced industrial products.46 Such free practical \nguides spark further adoption of circular business models.\nAnother approach could be the use of a “white label” solution that sup-\nports a company with logistics, storage, and resale. Consider re-commerce \ncompany Yerdle, which handles the collection, logistics, repair, storage, and \nweb development of fashion industry clients’ secondary markets.47\nDisruptive Technologies: Accelerate with 4IR Innovations\nFourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies enable the smart use of \nresources and create new opportunities for the circular economy.

Reverse logistics is the process that \nenables the circular loop (and associated “mini loops”) to be closed. Managing \nthe return and recovery of products from the consumer back into the value \nchain is a key tenet of the circular economy that enables products and materi-\nals to be recycled, reused, remanufactured, and so on.\n",

Such technologies also allow \ncompanies to track and monitor details of their assets’ usability and func-\ntionality in real time, resulting in improved efficiencies and long-term value \ngeneration (Product Use Extension ). The service provider Dirkzwager, for \nexample, offers the remote monitoring and management of offshore assets \nlike oil rigs throughout their use cycles.48 This capability not only helps \nprotect those valuable assets; it also improves the safety of shipping in con-\ngested waters, detects early oil spills, and otherwise prevents environmental \npollution.\n  What Are 4IR Technologies?\n4IR technologies refer to the array of digital, physical, and biological technol-\nogies that are enabling the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).

Consider AMP Robotics, a start-up that has developed a new kind \nof sorting technology for recycling facilities: the Cortex robot. Powered by \nadvanced artificial intelligence (AI), Cortex can automate the separation of \ncommodities with practically no retrofit or change to existing operations, \nthereby fundamentally changing the costs of recovering resources from \nwaste. Other technological developments have come from different fields. \nCambrian Innovation, a commercial provider of distributed wastewater \nand resource recovery solutions, has harnessed proprietary bioelectrochem-\nical technologies to convert wastewater into clean water and energy.50 The \nmodel helps industrial manufacturers become more circular. “We take a \nvery data-centric approach, using a combination of proprietary biological \ntreatment technologies and an analytics platform to monitor our plants,” \nexplains Matthew Silver, Founder and CEO of Cambrian Innovation. \nIndeed, digital, physical, and biological technologies have been at the core of \nsolving for circularity and will be explored in greater depth in the following \nchapter.\n",

Indeed, industries have been converging, while old, “linear” \nrelationships are being redrawn into web-like expansive ecosystems. Four \nmajor factors have been driving this trend: policy and legislation, invest-\nment, knowledge sharing, and practical collaboration—all of which will be \nexplored in more detail in the Ecosystem chapter.\nOrganizations must thoughtfully consider how they engage with and \ninfluence the various forces outside their direct value chains. Consider leg-\nislation, such as the industry-specific regulations to extend producer respon-\nsibility for the added environmental or social costs incurred over a product’s \nuse. Such policies are a strong incentive for manufacturers to incorporate \ncircular design principles and to facilitate sustainable approaches at the end-\nof-use phase (Resource Recovery ). Between 1970 and 2015, 400 EPR meas-\nures were implemented, with a majority focused on the electronics industry, \nmostly within Europe.51 Other policies have focused on consumers. Sweden \nhas significantly reduced the VAT for repairs, encouraging the longer use of \neverything from bicycles to washing machines and other appliances (Product \nUse Extension ).52 Policy and regulatory-driven inflection points are critical \nfor the adoption of circular business models, and as such, we will discuss \nthem in greater detail in the Role of Policymakers chapter.\nThe Combinatorial Power of Business Models\nTo tap into the full potential of circular business models, the models should \nbe considered in combination to enable a multiplier effect in value genera-\ntion.

On the other hand, for a Product Use Extension model, \nit may be enough to design for easy maintenance and recycling. The com-\nbinatorial power of the five models can drive competitiveness and, perhaps \nmost importantly, “future proof” organizations for an uncertain, rapidly \nchanging global marketplace. Consider Nike which started with the incre-\nmental implementation of Circular Inputs and Resource Recovery from pre- \nand post-consumer waste streams. The company then developed its branded \nby-product under the Nike Grind label and continues its circular ascent \nthrough its children shoe-subscription start-up Adventure Club.9,53\n  Case Study: Dell\nDell offers “PC-as-a-Service” by combining hardware, software, and lifecycle ser-\nvices in exchange for monthly fees. In parallel, an asset resale and recycling initia-\ntive allows the company to take back, resell, recycle, or return to lease any excess \nhardware in an environmentally conscious manner at the end of use. With Dell \nReconnect, a partnership with Goodwill in the United States that accepts any brand \nor type of computer for free, working assets are responsibly refurbished, and oth-\ners are recycled. Also, a buyback option is offered in some regions for customers to \ntrade in eligible devices from any manufacturer in exchange for payment. When it \ncomes to recovery, the returned plastics are shredded at the manufacturing facil-\nities, melted, and blended. Currently, about 35% of this content is recycled and \nmolded into new parts. As of June 2017, these so-called closed-loop plastics were \nbeing used in parts for more than 90 different Dell products. The net benefits of \nthese recycling efforts are estimated at $2 million in savings so far.54\nThroughout this chapter, we have discussed how the five circular business models \nhave evolved and been adopted. We’ve shown how they have helped companies \ntransform their traditional, linear ways of doing business into circular approaches \nthat minimize waste, increase efficiencies, and provide platforms for innovation. \nBut how, specifically, have organizations been able to leverage technology to \nimplement and scale those models?

From \nsteam engines to the internal combustion engine to computers and the \nInternet, technological innovations have enabled businesses to attain \nunprecedented increases in performance. The Fourth Industrial Revolution \n(4IR) is no exception and is characterized by various technologies disrupt-\ning just about every industry across the globe. “Much of the technology \nwe need to build a circular economy is already here, and it’s rapidly getting \nbetter,” says Doug Baker, Chairman and CEO of Ecolab. “In the coming \nyears we’ll see amazing innovations in big data and machine learning, \nbio-industrial products, reuse of captured carbon and a host of other \nadvanced technologies.”\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed how five dominant business models \nare driving the transition from a linear to a circular economy. In this chap-\nter, and throughout the book, we explore the role 4IR innovations are play-\ning in enabling circular business models and in accelerating the transition to \na circular economy.\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution\nThe 4IR is unlike any of the past industrial revolutions.

Lacy et al.\nIn the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it’s not just a handful of technical \ninventions; an array of technologies and combinations of them are spark-\ning transformational change across global value chains.1 The range of these \ninnovations across the digital, physical, and biological worlds is breathtak-\ning: everything from artificial intelligence to nanotechnology to cellular and \ntissue engineering. Along with the range of technologies, the pace at which \nthese new innovations are being developed and scaled is much greater than \nthat of previous industrial revolutions. As Dominic Waughray, Managing \nDirector at the World Economic Forum Centre for Global Public Goods, \nput it, “The Fourth Industrial Revolution will enable positive transforma-\ntions towards the circular economy. For example, many technology and \nvalue chain innovations are available to transform value chains like electron-\nics, plastics and fashion – from shaping provenance tools, to product pass-\nports and an internet of materials. These possibilities have yet to be fully \nleveraged. Multilateral collaboration is necessary to help unlock the potential \nof 4IR innovation around the world to help accelerate the circular economy \ntransformation.”\nSince the First Industrial Revolution, the relationship between economic \ngrowth and the use of natural resources has been around 1:1. In other \nwords, as our economy has grown, so has the use of land, water, materials, \nand other natural resources. This has subjected the environment and the \nearth’s resources to tremendous strain that is not currently sustainable with \ncontinued global growth.\n4IR technologies are a game changer in the sustainability revolution \nbecause they make it possible for business, for the first time, to decouple \nproduction and growth from the use of natural resources. To accomplish this, \nthese technologies provide four important capabilities. First, they ­enable \ngreater efficiencies and thus reduced wastage. Second, they help drive \ninnovation by allowing new entrants to disrupt existing markets while \nchallenging incumbent companies to pivot into new business models and \nnew markets. Third, 4IR technologies increase information transparency, \nallowing companies to gather and analyze data quickly to obtain valuable \ninsights through new levels of visibility (into equipment usage and prod-\nuct, energy, and material flows), connectivity (between machines, cus-\ntomers, and decision-makers), and flexibility (the capability to modify or \nadapt a device, function, or process) that are key to deploying circular busi-\nness models. Finally, biological 4IR technologies, in particular, enable us \nto move away from the use of traditional limited or resource-intensive \nmaterials.\n",

Lacy et al.\nThe 27 technologies fall into three broad categories of continuing \nadvancements and breakthroughs in the use of science and engineering: digi-\ntal, physical, and biological (see Fig. 3.1).\nAlthough all of these 27 4IR technologies are being used in applica-\ntions today, not all are being deployed at the same rate or scale. In general, \ncompanies have adopted digital innovations more widely than physical or \nbiological technologies. As one proof point, 59% of the 1500 circular com-\npanies we analyzed over the last five years via The Circulars award initiative \nhave deployed digital technologies (compared with a 28 and 13% deploy-\nment rate for physical and biological technologies, respectively).32\nThe big gap in adoption is correlated with technology maturity and is \nreflected in substantial differences in investments. In the United States and \nEurope, investments in the digital industry are about double that of bio-\ntech.33 Thanks to such investments, digital technologies are becoming \ncheaper and are scaling quickly. Between 2004 and 2014, for example, the \ncost of IoT sensors plunged by more than half. Such dramatic price drops \nhave resulted in electronic devices that harness digital technologies (laptop \ncomputers, tablets, smartphones, and other consumer electronics products) \nbecoming ubiquitous in many regions.34 Moreover, these devices rely on a \nvirtual world that is less dependent on physical resources to generate and \nmaintain value. As a result, companies have found it relatively easier to imple-\nment or retrofit digital technologies into existing processes and operations.\nIn contrast, many physical and biological technologies are less mature and \nhave not yet been proven or deployed at scale.

Moreover, those solutions tend to be \nproprietary, may require significant operational changes for widespread imple-\nmentation, or necessitate investigation into ethical and regulatory considera-\ntions.

IoT technology enables \nPhilips to monitor those products remotely, thereby facilitating predictive \nmaintenance and product life extension. This has allowed Philips to deploy a \nProduct as a Service model, in which the company sells the services of those \nmedical devices while retaining product ownership. When a customer has \nended its use of a device, the product is returned to Philips for repair, refur-\nbishment, and reuse or recovery. At the beginning of 2018, Philips pledged \nto take back and repurpose all of the large medical systems equipment (e.g., \nmagnetic resonance imaging or MRI, and computed tomography, CT, scan-\nners) that its customers were prepared to return to the company and to \nextend those practices across its professional portfolio by 2025. In 2018, \nafter pilot projects in Italy and Greece, Philips successfully launched the \nroll-out of a global program to achieve its ambitious circular economy goal, \ntogether with metrics to monitor progress.36\nAccenture estimates that the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) could \nadd about $14.2 trillion to the global economy by 2030.37 As companies \ncontinue to deploy IoT technologies, they should consider measures to man-\nage cybersecurity risks, interoperability, and data privacy.

The technology, which often relies on \nneural networks, can be a tremendous aid in improving the decision-mak-\ning of even human experts. This is largely due to the vast (and exponentially \ngrowing) amounts of data that the technology can analyze with tremendous \nspeed and accuracy. Machine learning can help organizations design cir-\ncular products, components, and materials through iterative self-learning \nalgorithms that allow rapid prototyping and testing. It can also be used to \nminimize waste, resource use, and emissions through the deployment of pre-\ndictive analytics for more precise demand-planning or for analyzing usage \npatterns to optimize asset management.\n",

Thanks to sophisticated neural networks, Siemens \nhas been able to achieve impressive results, even surpassing the performance \nof human experts. In a series of tests, after a human expert had set the tur-\nbine controls manually, the machine-learning system was able to further \nreduce the emissions of nitrogen oxide by an additional 20%.39\nMachine learning has tremendous potential, with the market expected \nto surpass $23 billion by 2023.40 To unlock that value, though, compa-\nnies must overcome various technical challenges. Applications like the \nSiemens turbine-control system require copious amounts of data for the \nmachine-learning application to yield useful results. While large corpora-\ntions might possess virtual treasure troves of data, not all of that informa-\ntion might be readily usable. Most of it might need to be “cleaned” first, \nand much of it might be locked in different formats in the separate stor-\nage and processing systems of business-unit siloes. As such, data aggregation \nand integration can be a very difficult but foundational task for companies \nlooking to apply machine learning to their own processes.41,42 Additionally, \nethical challenges should be carefully managed to ensure algorithmic bias is \navoided and data is used appropriately and transparently.\nPhysical: Robotics\nRobotics is especially well suited for automating processes that are repetitive \nand rules-based. When combined with machine learning, the technology can \nbe trained to perform a complex series of actions.

Two lines of the advanced robot can take apart 2.4 million phones a \nyear, enabling Apple to recover high-quality components and materials \nthat would typically go to waste under traditional recycling techniques. For \nevery 100,000 devices, Liam can recover considerable amounts of aluminum \n(1900 kilograms), copper (800 kilograms), tin (55 kilograms), rare-earth ele-\nments (24 kilograms), tungsten (3.5 kilograms), tantalum (2.5 kilograms), \n",

Specifically, recaptured aluminum is re-melted and \nused to make Macintosh minicomputers in the company’s final-assembly \nfacilities.45 According to Apple, Daisy (Liam’s successor) can disassemble up \nto 200 iPhones an hour (equaling approximately 1.8 million a year), separat-\ning parts and removing certain components as it works.46\nWhen deploying robotics, companies need to consider several factors, \nincluding capital expenditure and returns and the social impact of work-\nforce displacement. A careful assessment of the efficiency gains delivered \nby harnessing robotics should be undertaken and considered against the \ninitial investment costs of applying the technology. In this analysis, compa-\nnies should also evaluate the investments needed to re-train and re-position \npotentially displaced employees.\nPhysical: Energy Harvesting\nEnergy harvesting is the use of specialized materials or equipment to capture, \nstore, and supply energy that would otherwise be lost as heat, light, sound, \nvibration, or movement. Deployment has been somewhat constrained to \ndate (due to conversion efficiencies, source stability, and power-storage \ncapacities), but the technology is advancing, and the global energy-harvest-\ning market is expected to surpass $1 billion by 2025.47 Applications run the \ngamut and reflect no shortage of ingenuity: IoT sensors that harvest sunlight \nto power themselves, antennas that scavenge for radio-frequency energy that \nis then converted to DC (direct current) electricity, a new type of incandes-\ncent light bulb that self-recycles the heat it generates, and so on. Two leading \ntechnology institutes in the United States and China have created a “nano-\ngenerator” that simultaneously harnesses wind and solar energy and can be \ninstalled on the roof of a home, powering energy-efficient light-emitting \ndiode (LED) lights inside as well as a temperature sensor.48\nThe technology is expected to be even more critical in the future, espe-\ncially for smaller and low-energy-consumption devices. IoT applications and \nconsumer electronics will drive innovation in this space, using sensors and \nother electronic devices in environments where the costs associated with pro-\nviding power have made certain applications difficult.49,50 Buildings, repre-\nsenting almost 30% of energy worldwide, offer a huge area of opportunity.51 \nIf companies could harvest the excess energy wasted within a building, it \ncould be used to power devices that would slash overall building energy con-\nsumption and deliver substantial economic value to building owners.\n",

Lacy et al.\nBiological: Bio-Based Materials\nThis technology includes plant-based compostable and recyclable materials \nthat are increasingly being used as substitutes for less-sustainable resources. \nBio-based materials can be made from biopolymers and from other nat-\nural fibers created partially or wholly through the use of plant feedstock. \nAs mentioned above, Japanese automaker Mazda is a case in point. Instead \nof using traditional plastics and other environmentally challenging materials \nfor its car interiors, the company has been switching to bio-based plastics.52 \nWorking with Mitsubishi Chemical Corp., the industrial products arm of the \nJapanese corporation Mitsubishi, Mazda has developed a new plastic that is \nnot only produced from plant-derived materials but also can be dyed instead \nof painted, thus reducing the need for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). \nThe automaker also uses bio-fabrics, manufactured entirely from plant-derived \nfiber, for the upholstery of its vehicle seats, and it has started deploying high-\nstrength, durable bio-plastics for exterior vehicle parts as well.52 Over the next \n20 years, global plastic production is expected to double, and much of that \ncould instead be sourced from new materials that are bio-based as well as from \nmaterials and chemicals derived from renewable biological resources.53\nCompanies that intend to develop and scale use of this technology need \nto consider several factors, including full environmental impact and product \nrecyclability. First, they must understand the provenance of a material being \nconsidered. For example, does the feedstock used to create the bio-based \nmaterial come from a waste stream or from growing a crop on otherwise \nproductive land? Second, bio-based materials are circular only if the appro-\npriate waste management systems are available to recycle them back into the \nvalue chain or re-absorb them back into the environment. By weighing these \nand other factors, a company might discover that the use of a particular bio-\nbased material might not necessarily be more environmentally efficient than \nan oil-derived alternative.54,55\nBiological: Bio-Energy\nBio-energy technology is used to convert natural and organic matter such \nas plants, waste, and alcohol fuels into energy. One approach is to extract \nenergy from wastewater through electromethanogenesis (a form of electro-\nfuel production where methane is produced by direct biological conversion \nfrom electrical current and carbon dioxide), anaerobic digestion, or other \nbiological or biochemical processes.

Through such applications, bio-energy technologies can provide the \nfoundation for efficient resource recovery, with the global bio-energy market \nexpected to grow by $54 billion from 2018 to 2022.56\nConsider Enerkem, a Montreal start-up that has developed technology for \nconverting municipal non-recyclable garbage into transportation fuels and \nother renewable chemicals that can then be used across different industries. \nAt a plant in Rotterdam, Enerkem has plans to gasify 300,000 tons of waste \nannually to produce more than 200,000 tons of methanol. Without that pro-\ncessing plant, the waste would have been headed for incineration elsewhere, \npotentially resulting in the release of 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide.57\nAlthough technologies like Enerkem’s offer win-win solutions—not only \nextracting biofuel from waste but also avoiding the release of greenhouse \ngases—scaling them beyond their early maturity calls for incentives and \ninvestments in infrastructure. Additionally, it is important to note that con-\nverting resources into energy should most often be the last resort in an ideal \ncircular system, only when all other options, such as re-using and recycling, \nare exhausted. Furthermore, health impacts from the burning of matter as \nwell as GHG emissions must be considered, which can vary depending on \nthe feedstock and technology used. Another key risk of bio-energy produc-\ntion is drawing from virgin resources, such as biofuel crops that are grown \non farmland as opposed to marginal land unsuitable for food production, \nsparking a debate over the wisdom of diverting crops or farmland for energy \nproduction. Because of such issues, the successful and responsible applica-\ntion of bio-energy technology is highly dependent on location, local policy, \nand available feedstock.58,59\nCombinatorial Effects\nWhile 4IR technologies possess powerful capabilities, there’s no one-size-\nfits-all solution for creating circular value. Technologies can be deployed in \nvarious ways depending on the industry, scale, waste stream, and challenges \ninvolved. Our analysis, though, uncovered a common thread: the most com-\npetitive businesses tended to deploy combinations of technologies to achieve \nthe best performance. Of the 27 technologies, a few combinations seemed \nparticularly promising in terms of their potential to disrupt the linear econ-\nomy and accelerate circular businesses.\nMost often we found that companies achieved synergies in the same given \narea, such as a digital technology combined with other digital technologies. \n",

The analysis could, for instance, help deter-\nmine whether any returned products should be refurbished for resale or \ninstead have their parts harvested to obtain the highest value. In one exam-\nple, Winnow, a technology company working in the hospitality sector, \ndevelops artificial intelligence tools to help chefs run more profitable and \nsustainable kitchens by cutting food waste in half. Using computer vision, \nthe system harvests large volumes of food waste images which are used to \ntrain a predictive model. Chefs benefit from accurate analytics which pin-\npoint where waste occurs in their kitchens helping them cut food costs by \n3–8% (ROI of up to 10 times in year one). Clients like IKEA and IHG have \nalready begun rolling out the technology at scale.60\nSome of the most interesting and powerful combinations, however, \nemerge from solutions that transcend boundaries between the digital, phys-\nical, and biological worlds. Specifically, digital technologies are frequently \nused as a multiplier to scale an application and accelerate its impact, for \nexample, the use of machine vision and AI to improve the performance of \nphysical technologies, such as robots. Our data indicates that deployment \nof such digital-physical applications is the most common type of cross-field \ncombination. In contrast, digital-biological combinations currently repre-\nsent just 8% of circular deployments. That said, digital-biological combina-\ntions possess tremendous potential. Consider, for example, indoor farming \nleader AeroFarms’ use of aeroponics and predictive analytics for superior \nand consistent agricultural productivity that reduces resource consumption \nand waste generation, while increasing quality output. Similarly, the team \nat LanzaTech, made up of biologists, chemists, engineers, and computa-\ntional biologists, leverages technology to amplify impact by combining dis-\nciplines. LanzaTech generates a great deal of data in its global facilities that \nneeds to be digitally modeled to improve next-generation products. “It is \nthanks to this marriage of biology and AI that we are able to predict design \nflows and accelerate the production of new sustainable chemicals that can be \nbrought into the circular supply chain,” explains Jennifer Holmgren, CEO \nof LanzaTech.\nIn the future, we believe the greatest impact will come from solutions \nthat fuse all three (digital, physical, and biological) types of technologies. \nAn apt example is tire company Goodyear’s new concept tire, Oxygene. In \nthis innovative product, moss would grow within the sidewall of the tire by \nabsorbing moisture from the road, and this would improve traction with \nthe moss also helping to remove carbon dioxide from the air.61 For a city \n",

At the same time, companies need \nto be cognizant of the potential unintended consequences that can arise \nfrom transforming their core businesses with these disruptive new innova-\ntions.

For instance, \nstudies show that the supply of biomass is under pressure to meet future \ndemand in a sustainable manner.64 As such, businesses aiming to integrate \nbio-based materials, bio-chemicals, and bio-fuels as raw material in their \nsupply chain should be aware of the production and environmental foot-\nprint of those resources and target more sustainable alternatives where pos-\nsible. Tetra Pak, the global food-processing and packaging company, has \nelected to use versatile crops, such as sugarcane bagasse and to rely on sus-\ntainably managed forests to derive its bio-based packaging material. Today, \nTetra Pak sources 100% of its paperboard from forests that have been cer-\ntified by the Forest Stewardship Council, and the company works with \nsuppliers, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to pro-\nmote responsible forest management and to strengthen product traceability \nthrough certification and labeling.65,66\nIn our research, the potential unintended consequence companies most \noften share with us concerns the full environmental footprint of these new \ncircular innovations, that is, that the newer innovations might actually \n",

Water technology \ncompany Xylem, for example, developed a digital twin of the city of South \nBend, Indiana’s sewer system and used AI to analyze and optimize storm \nwater surges to avoid combined sewer overflows that pollute local water-\nways—preventing more than 1 billion gallons of storm and sewer water \nfrom entering the St. Joseph River every year. This helped the city reduce \nits construction budget by $500 million that would have otherwise been \nneeded to build more underground tunnels to hold excess storm water, con-\nserving energy and lessening human impact on the environment. The solu-\ntion is also helping protect waterways connected to the river, such as Lake \nMichigan, which is a critical source for water treatment plants that supply \ndrinking water to Chicago, Grand Rapids, and the region.67\nBlockchain and cryptographic anchors.  Blockchain technology can help \nensure a product’s authenticity, tracing it from its point of origin to the \nend user on a secure, immutable distributed ledger. Cryptographic anchors \nare tamper-proof “digital fingerprints” that can be embedded into prod-\nucts, or parts of products, allowing physical goods to have a traceable dig-\nital identity that can be stored on a blockchain, facilitating asset tracking \nand value recovery at end of use. Blockchain-based communication com-\npany, Circularise, for example, developed an open, distributed, and secure \ncommunication protocol for the circular economy in combination with \ncryptographic anchors.

Robotics is being further \nequipped with machine vision and powered by machine learning to improve \ntheir capabilities and intelligence for circular applications. AMP Robotics, \nfor example, is using machine vision to sort waste, and the accuracy of the \nsystem has improved over time to 99%.69\nBreakthroughs in physical and biological technologies.  Driven by invest-\nments and start-up activity, growth in physical and biological technologies \nhas been steady and promising. “Food tech” is one area with a constant \nstream of innovation that we expect to continue to spur transformation. \nSpecifically, advances in technologies like robotics, drones, and sensors \nwill continue to shape the next generation of farms while reducing labor, \nenergy, and resource intensity, and we are also on the brink of a revolution \nin bio-based technologies. Food tech start-up Apeel Sciences, for example, \nuses plant extracts derived from discarded agricultural by-products to cre-\nate invisible tasteless coatings that extend the shelf life of fresh products \nby two to five times.70 The technology can help grocers reduce waste while \nimproving the appearance and nutritional content of their fruits and vege-\ntables. Lab-grown food could further remove farm dependency altogether, \ncreating food quickly with highly controlled inputs. Consider Memphis \nMeats, a food technology company, which produces animal cells in the \nlab to create cell-based meat. The start-up has received over $20 million \nin funding, with investment from large food corporations like Tyson and \nCargill, and, as prices fall, products could be launched commercially within \nthe next few years.71 Agricultural processes will evolve more broadly as well. \nRestorative agriculture, a farming technique that aims to increase biodiver-\nsity, enrich soils, and enhance ecosystem services, is quickly gaining ground, \nfor instance. Meanwhile, companies like Lystek, a Canadian waste treatment \ntechnology company, are taking organic waste from cities and converting it \ninto regenerative soil enhancers.72\nThe fashion industry is embracing a host of emerging and potentially \ngame-changing biological innovations.

Today, instead of distinct \ntechnological revolutions, we are experiencing constant progress, with new \nwaves of innovation continually making existing technologies obsolete. This \nhas placed relentless demands on companies to stay up to date, but it has \nalso unlocked new opportunities at an exponential rate in ever-shorter time \nspans. As John Atechson, CEO of Stuffstr, a recirculation platform that aims \nto accelerate the transition to a circular economy, puts it, “We are constantly \nimproving our algorithm to increase the insights we can attain from data \nand improve accuracy. Our ability to harness data, which is growing at an \nepic scale, leads to more recirculation opportunities, ultimately changing \nconsumers’ mindset about the linear system.”\nWithout a doubt, 4IR innovations have provided a rich platform for \nfirms to gain considerable competitive advantages in deploying the five cir-\ncular business models. To unlock the full potential of these technologies, \nthough, companies must implement them holistically across all operat-\ning groups and function areas. The technologies must also be channeled \npurposefully in ways that tap into their nascent synergies and managed \nproperly to minimize unintended consequences, including adverse environ-\nmental impacts, displacement of employees, risk of cyberthreats, and ethi-\ncal concerns. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss these and other implications \nfor specific industries.\n",

Staying at the forefront of emerging technologies may also \naccelerate progress toward regenerative and restorative processes that are \nadditive to natural resources.\n•\t To achieve these benefits, the technologies must be woven holistically into \nthe fabric of the organization, deployed with intent, and managed properly \nto minimize any unintended consequences.\nNotes\n\t 1.\t Kalus Schwab, “The Fourth Industrial Revolution: What It Means, How to \nRespond,” World Economic Forum, January 14, 2016, https://www.wefo-\nrum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-\nand-how-to-respond/ (accessed August 9, 2019).\n\t 2.\t Noodle.ai, “NFI Industries Teams Up with Noodle.Ai to Bring World-Class \nArtificial Intelligence to the Transportation and Distribution Industries,” \n2019, https://noodle.ai/case-studies/nfi (accessed August 9, 2019).\n\t 3.\t Topolytics, “About—Topolytics,” http://topolytics.com/about/ (accessed \nAugust 17, 2019).\n\t 4.\t Rubicon Global, “About Us,” https://www.rubiconglobal.com/about/ \n(accessed August 17, 2019).\n\t 5.\t Cognex, “Cognex—The Leader in Machine Vision,” https://www.cognex.\ncom/en-gb/company (accessed August 17, 2019).\n\t 6.\t Alstom, “Alstom Launches HealthHub, an Innovative Tool for Predictive \nMaintenance,” September 23, 2014, https://www.alstom.com/press-releas-\nes-news/2014/9/innotrans2014-alstom-launches-healthhub-an-innova-\ntive-tool-for-predictive-maintenance- (accessed August 17, 2019).\n\t 7.\t SKF, “SKF Insight,” https://www.skf.com/uk/products/condition-monitor-\ning/skfinsight.html (accessed August 17, 2019).\n",

Now we will explore what this shift means \nacross specific industries. We will examine the role that 10 different indus-\ntries can play in the circular transition and how they can realize significant \nvalue through large-scale adoption of circular principles.\nThere are countless ways to segment industries, and today’s digital econ-\nomy challenges traditional definitions. For this reason, we segmented the \nindustries based on product types and characteristics and the raw materials \nthat are affected by their production and consumption. For example, rather \nthan looking at retail, we considered the various types of products consum-\ners purchase: consumables, clothes, household appliances, information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) devices, etc. Each of these differs in terms \nof the raw materials used, waste streams, useful life, typical price point, and \ncustomers’ emotional attachment.\nWhat’s Driving the Industry Shift to Circularity?\nThe types and volume of industry-level circular activity vary widely. In \ngeneral, consumer-facing industries have seen the largest volumes of circu-\nlar activity, often driven by demands from consumers, governments, and \nemployees. Specifically, the leading players in fast-moving consumer goods \n(FMCG) have set ambitious circular economy goals, often with a focus on \npackaging and input waste reduction.

For \nthese industries, rising consumer demand and expectations is a clear driver. \nAccording to a 2019 Accenture survey, nearly three-quarters of consumers \n(72%) say they buy more “environmentally friendly products” today than \nfive years ago. Growing public discourse on issues such as plastics and “dis-\nposable” fashion is spurring the “call to action” for brands in these sectors. \nMore recently, however, business-to-business (B2B) industries that are less \nvisible to consumers, such as chemical, and metals and mining companies, \nare starting to see a push from customers (or from the customers of cus-\ntomers). Indeed, a majority of consumers (83%) believe it is important for \ncompanies to design products that are meant to be reused or recycled, and \nabout half (49%) believe that the chemical industry, for example, is the least \nconcerned about the impact it has on the environment compared with eight \nother sectors.1\nOther industries feel the pressure of regulatory drivers. In the household \nappliances sector, for instance, increasing regulations on responsible treat-\nment of products at end of use are pushing companies to focus on greater \nrecovery of used machines. In the United States, Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) regulations require technicians who service refrigeration and \nair-conditioning equipment to follow specific practices to maximize recovery \nand recycling.2 The topic of regulation and the implications for businesses \nwill be covered in depth in our section on policy (see Part III, “Policy—The \nRole of Policymakers”).\nIn some cases, circular economy principles naturally align with how indus-\ntries have long managed their businesses, such as the focus on multi-decade \nproduct lifecycles for machinery and industrial equipment (M&IE) and \nautomotive companies. These industries often have strong after-sales main-\ntenance and services baked into their business models. Therefore, the transi-\ntion to circularity is a natural extension of business-as-usual.\nUptake of the Circular Business Models\nAcross industries, a compelling financial case is emerging for the move from \nlinear to circular models of production and consumption. To capture circu-\nlar value and pivot to new growth areas, most industries adopt a dual focus: \napplying circular models to their existing value chains, while also incremen-\ntally altering the way they do things today. An example is driving efficien-\ncies within operations while experimenting with Product as a Service business \nmodels. The typical mix of opportunities across industries includes a change \n",

We are seeing used \nshoes recycled into sports flooring or car interiors, unwanted plastics trans-\nformed into superior road surfaces, and wastewater becoming fuel for public \nfleets. Although the crossover of Circular Inputs is still limited by technical \nfeasibility, inadequate infrastructures, and unintended impacts, the potential \nis huge. We’ll explore this further in later chapters.\nCircular opportunities may also blur industry lines. Many businesses are \nfinding opportunities by enabling circularity for other sectors. Oil and gas \ncompanies are getting into the electricity and e-mobility sectors, and chemi-\ncal companies are embracing their role in textiles and food component inno-\nvation. Take, for example, American chemical company Eastman Chemical’s \ncircular recycling technology that has the potential to break down polyes-\nter-based products into “building blocks” which can, in turn, be used in new \nproducts, ultimately helping to solve the textile recycling challenge.3\nThe Barriers and Enablers\nOn their journeys to close the loop—within an organization, across the \nindustry, and throughout an ecosystem—we see common barriers and ena-\nblers. Companies across all industries need to scale innovation, build part-\nnerships, focus on broader supply chain circularity, and support enabling \npolicies and regulations. While circular opportunities will generally address \nthe four types of linear waste covered in Chapter 2 (i.e., wasted resources, \nwasted capacity, wasted lifecycles, and wasted embedded values), the balance \nbetween them will differ.\nResource-intensive production industries like oil and gas refining, metals \nand mining, or equipment manufacturing need to focus on reducing wasted \nresources as well as machine downtime (wasted capacity). This means look-\ning at circular and renewable inputs and focusing on efficiencies, utilization, \nand the foundational reduction and reuse of natural resources, such as water. \nIn more consumption-focused industries, such as consumer electronics and \ngoods, a significant part of the waste profile occurs during product use (wasted \ncapacity) and premature disposal (wasted lifecycles).

Lacy et al.\nreducing waste during manufacturing processes, these companies can capture \nvalue through service-based models that extend product lives or through the \nrecovery of useful material at end of use (wasted embedded values).\nIt’s also important to note that customer demand and appetite for different \nmodels will vary by industry. Although there’s a general shift toward more sim-\nplicity and less consumption, consumer readiness to shift to renting or sharing \nmodels for goods or services depends on the perceived value of the product. \nResearch suggests such models are generally easier with goods that are more \nfunctional and less sentimental (a lawn mower versus a wedding dress), lower \nvalue versus hyper valuable (a stroller versus a piece of art), or those that lack \nhygienic factors when it comes to reuse (a book versus a toothbrush).4 When \nit comes to willingness to pay, consumers are also most likely to pay a pre-\nmium for food and beverage packaging (containers or wrappers), electronics \nproducts (computers, TVs, stereos, etc.) and children’s toys that are designed to \nbe reused or recycled, with over 55% willing to pay at least a 10% premium.5\nJust as existing industry dynamics can be conducive to circular economy \npractices (e.g., the focus on servicing in M&IE), they can also complicate \nthe transition. In the ICT and fashion industries, consumers have become \naccustomed to having access to the latest products at the lowest possi-\nble costs, either on-demand or delivered within days. This drives the rela-\ntively short lifespan for previously longer-lasting devices and clothing. Even \nproducts that are durable and have long useful lives become outdated or \nunwanted prematurely. For instance, mobile phones might technically last \nfor four to five years, but the demand for a quicker refresh of these products \nlimits their ability to generate enough value through disassembly and upcy-\ncling versus reselling on secondary markets.\nLastly, although sophisticated advancements are happening across indus-\ntries, such as AI tools leveraging machine vision to reduce food waste in \nkitchens or pressurized CO2 helping to completely eliminate water and \nchemicals from textile dyeing processes, the opportunities and barriers \nrelated to technology and infrastructure have not been uniform, even within \na single industry. Moreover, the maturity of technologies and infrastructures \nhas not been uniform across industries. The fashion industry is struggling \nwith the quality and performance of recycled textiles, for example. In oil and \ngas, greater carbon circularity relies on carbon capture technologies that have \nyet to prove scalable at a reasonable cost. When it comes to collection at end \nof use, the FMCG industry is encouraging customers to return their product \npackaging but because packaging is currently so low-value, companies have \nbeen focusing on building out very localized collection and recycling sys-\ntems. In contrast, ICT devices have very valuable components that require \nglobal shipping to centralized locations.\n",

For each industry, we highlight one key circular value \narea that companies can pursue over the short and medium term. We deter-\nmined a key circular theme to help identify a set of tangible opportuni-\nties, for example, packaging in FMCG. The opportunity set is then used \nto determine specific drivers of value grounded in case studies that illumi-\nnate the potential scale of the opportunity for individual companies and the \nindustry as a whole.\nIt is important to note, however, that this is not the only way the industry \ncan create value from the circular economy. For example, we recognize that \nthe potential value opportunities for FMCG companies stretch far beyond \noptimization of packaging. These value calculations could never hope to be \ncomprehensive and are estimates based on the best currently available infor-\nmation. But they do point to the magnitude of the opportunities available \nand the imperative for action.\nFigure 4.1 summarizes the industries we will cover and the areas of circu-\nlar value opportunity we will explore in more depth.\nTo assess the potential scale of any given opportunity, we calculated the \nimpact on operating profit (see Fig. 4.2).5 It quickly became apparent that \nthese opportunities could generate value in three ways:\n1.\tValue addition through new sources of revenue,\n2.\tValue addition through reducing costs, and\n3.\tRevenue generated for a specific company through value migration.\nValue addition is the creation of profit pools where none existed before. \nThis evident in the majority of cases examined. Value migration refers to \nprofit shifting between industry participants or from one type of product/\nservice to another. This measures a shift in value rather than new value \nadded to the industry value chain. For example, Company A’s circular prod-\nuct resonates with consumers better than Company B’s linear equivalent \nand therefore people switch from B to A. Sometimes value migration occurs \nbetween industries as they converge, but this is less common.\nThe analysis in this study shows that the cost reduction side of the equa-\ntion offers tremendous value potential: about $500 billion in aggregate for \nthe eight industries for which we quantified value.

Our analysis esti-\nmates that value addition for new revenue generation equates to around \n10% of the total value at stake, roughly $100 billion. The difficulty in \nnew revenue generation could be due to a number of factors, for exam-\nple: (a) circularity as a theme on its own may not generate additional \ndemand for products and services; (b) consumers in most industries \nmay be unwilling to pay a price premium for circular products; and (c) \ncompetition from new players in adjacent industries can erode growth \nopportunities, e.g., automotive companies offering on-demand mobility \nservices must compete against pure-play on-demand mobility providers \nsuch as Uber.\nNevertheless, the value at stake in terms of migration between industry \nplayers can be much larger, as much as $400 billion. A couple of factors \nare at play here.

Demand for primary materials will continue to escalate, driven \nby rising global population, rapid urbanization, spread of digital technolo-\ngies, and economic growth. According to the international financial insti-\ntution the World Bank, the transition to a low-carbon economy will result \nin increased primary demand for aluminum, cobalt, lithium, silver, nickel, \nlead, zinc, and other metals. Glencore, a British-Swiss commodity trading \nand mining company, has found that meeting the Clean Energy Ministerial \ntarget of 30 million EV sales by 2030 would require 314 kilotons of cobalt \nper year by 2030—more than triple the demand in 2017.8 However, current \ncobalt reserves are only predicted to last for 23 years, so innovative alterna-\ntives are needed to satisfy demand.9 While some resources, such as cobalt, \nare scarce, others are still abundant. Iron, for instance, is plentiful with 5.6% \nof earth’s crust made of iron.10 Where the supply-side risks are low, demand-\ndriven commodity price fluctuations tend to sway the balance between sec-\nondary and primary metal usage. As the price of primary feedstock rises on \nthe back of strong demand,11 the industry will experience higher recycling \nrates, the supply and use of secondary raw materials, investments in recy-\ncling, and more sophisticated purification technologies.\nTo date, circular economy innovation has focused on operational \nimprovements. Mining leaders have started to connect efficiency initi-\natives and the circular economy more explicitly, especially in the domains \nof energy, water use, and carbon-neutral operations. Downstream circular-\nity is also evolving, driven by two major factors: supply risk and visibility \nthroughout the value chain, and customer pull by manufacturers that have \nembedded increasing levels of material sustainability in their products. For \nexample, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-led shift in the auto-\nmotive industry toward greater circularity in both design and use of sec-\nondary materials is already having an impact on mining companies. The \nautomobile maker Renault is collaborating with large players in the met-\nals recycling value chain (e.g., Suez) to enhance recycling capabilities and \ndevelop mutually beneficial programs. Using its experience as a manufac-\nturer, Renault provides valuable insights about end-of-use resources for car \ndismantling.12\n",

Mining and metal \n­production operations consume about 7.5% of the global energy supply \n(IEA 2016) and account for about a tenth of global energy consumption \ntoday.13,14\nThe second is wasted embedded value. The most relevant waste category \nhere is waste from operations, both mineral (tailings) and non-mineral waste \n(overburden or waste rock). Production of one ton of copper, for example, \ngenerates about 110 tons of tailings and roughly 200 tons of overburden.4 \nThe average ore grade has declined by about 25% in a span of 10 years, \nresulting in higher levels of overburden.15 Non-hazardous mineral and \nnon-mineral waste, as well as slag from smelting, are valuable resources that \ncan have multiple applications, such as landscaping material, aggregate in \nconstruction, or feedstock for cement and concrete.16\nThe third major area of waste comes from sub-optimal management and \nprocurement of equipment. According to recent research, equipment utili-\nzation rates for mine operators are around 30–50%, suggesting that min-\ning organizations could benefit from more flexible ownership models for \nmachinery, including as-a-service agreements.17\n  Waste to Wealth Opportunities\nThe mining industry has three broad areas of opportunity (see Table 5.2). \nThe first has to do with renewable inputs. In general, the uptake of renewa-\nble energy by the mining industry has been relatively slow, but the improved \neconomics of solar and wind, together with the threat of potential carbon \npricing, are now driving organizations to actively strike deals with local util-\nity companies for the supply of renewable energy.18 Chile, where mining \nenergy requirements are typically higher because of the challenging topogra-\nphy, has been a global leader with as many as nine different mining compa-\nnies having installed renewable capacity to date.19\nThe second area involves upstream waste. Industry leaders are already roll-\ning out zero-waste-to-landfill initiatives and innovative solutions, such as \nthe recycling of quartz from iron-ore mining waste for producing synthetic \nquartz, used in kitchen and bathroom countertops.24 Best practice indicates \nthat a successful waste strategy starts with a detailed mapping and quanti-\nfication of all waste streams. Waste management partners then identify, or \ndevelop, optimal waste solutions and applications for by-products. Mine clo-\nsure and land rehabilitation present a new frontier for circularity, as compa-\nnies begin to extend the lifecycle of mines. This could be based on top-soil \n",

This typi-\ncally focuses on material stewardship practices and materials recovery. One \nstudy has estimated that recovering gold, copper, and other metals from dis-\ncarded electronics is 13 times cheaper than mining for virgin equivalents.26 \nCompanies could also develop and maintain a marketplace platform for \ntrading secondary metals, waste by-products, idle equipment, or end-of-use \nassets.

Umicore buys sus-\ntainably mined cobalt raw materials to manufacture materials for rechargea-\nble batteries that power EVs. When the batteries are no longer useful, they \nrecycle them to recover the cobalt.27 The cobalt is then used to make new \nbattery materials, and the same happens with nickel.

The technology has \npotential application beyond diamonds.33\n  Obstacles to Overcome\nThe most significant challenge in the metals and mining industry is that the \nprimary demand for minerals and metals will continue to rise in the near \nterm; therefore, the total resource demand is unlikely to be fulfilled by sec-\nondary supplies, as there simply isn’t enough accessible scrap or used mate-\nrial. Moreover, complex alloys and engineered metals require very high \npurity and quality, and the current ability of secondary market systems to \nprovide product to such standards is limited.\nTo overcome the barriers to the circular transition, a number of factors are \nkey. Technology innovation to improve accessibility and purity of recycled \nmetals is vital. In addition, traditional mining companies must explore new \nbusiness models and capabilities that support circularity within upstream \noperations, and downstream with cutting-edge customer offerings. As Mark \nCutifani, CEO of Anglo American emphasizes, “A shift toward a more cir-\ncular economy presents a significant opportunity for mining companies that \nare willing to embrace it by re-imagining their business and partnering with \nthe intermediate and end users of the essential metals and minerals they \nproduce; for Anglo American, as a leading producer of many of the mate-\nrials critical to a cleaner, more electrified and consumer-driven world, this \ngoes to the heart of our purpose and is a challenge we are addressing directly \nthrough our FutureSmart Mining approach - coupling step change innova-\ntions in technology and sustainability to change the future footprint of min-\ning across the entire value chain.”\n",

It includes upstream \nactivities (exploration and production), midstream (transportation, storage, \nand processing), and downstream (purification, refining, logistics/transport, \nand retail). Companies face significant price volatility, as shifting geopoliti-\ncal, market, and technology dynamics affect the balance between supply and \ndemand. The industry has already started to move away from oil and toward \nless carbon-intensive natural gas, commonly positioned as a “bridge fuel,” \ndue in large part to the shale gas/oil revolution enabled by horizontal drill-\ning technology.\nFor the larger energy transition, with increasing environmental regu-\nlations and investor pressures, companies are shifting their portfolios in \nfavor of low-carbon businesses. Industry leaders have diversified, investing \nin alternative energies and the associated technological infrastructure (solar, \nwind, hydrogen, battery storage) and in new segments of the energy value \nchains (EV charging, retail energy, utilities). In addition, the industry has \nalso invested in partnerships and acquisitions to drive efficiency and reduce \nthe environmental footprint of the current hydrocarbon value chain. Such \na move is critical, given that the share of fossil fuels in the total primary \nenergy supply has remained stable at about 81% for the past three dec-\nades.5 Indeed, petrochemicals are expected to be the largest growing demand \nsegment for the O&G industry. According to the International Energy \nAssociation (IEA), petrochemicals are set to account for more than a third of \nthe growth in world oil demand up to 2030 and nearly 50% of the growth \nto 2050.6\n  Waste to Wealth Challenges\nO&G companies have some of the largest energy and carbon footprints in \nthe world, with production and use accounting for over 50% of global GHG \nemissions associated with energy consumption.7 Companies can begin to \ntackle this challenge by addressing three key areas of waste (see Fig. 6.1).\nThe first is waste from energy-intensive activities up- and midstream \nin the value chain. Extraction is becoming more energy intensive as fields \nmature. This expands use of secondary and enhanced recovery methods that \nrequire water and gas injection, and chemical or thermal (steam) flooding \nto boost production. Further downstream, refining is still the most energy- \nand emissions-intensive stage of production, using significant amounts of \n",

Given the vast amounts of heat required \nfor multiple refining stages, refining accounts for about half of all the energy \nconsumed by the industry.\nThe second area is waste from operations (methane leakages alone cost \nthe industry about $30 billion a year) and unrealized value from potential \nby-products across the value chain.8 There is potential, for example, to cap-\nture carbon for use in CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in which the CO2 \nreduces the oil’s viscosity and increase its flow to the well.\nFig. 6.1  Waste analysis diagram\n",

Lacy et al.\nThe third major area is waste that results from underutilized equipment. \nWith extended use of renewable energy and electrification, utilization rates \nof O&G equipment could decline, and equipment could be retired early. \nCompanies have been exploring options to maximize the end-of-use value \nfrom these assets, for example, by creating an offshore pipeline for carbon \ncapture.\n  Waste to Wealth Opportunities\nOur research has identified three areas of opportunity (see Table 6.2). The \nfirst involves improving the utilization, efficiency, and performance of assets \nand plants in operation today. The Malaysian O&G company Petronas, for \nexample, has gone so far as to create a platform for other companies to use \nits idle tankers.9\nThe second area of opportunity lies with reducing operational waste and \nleakages. Some energy companies are seizing opportunities to reuse and \n­recycle energy, solid waste, and water in their operations and beyond. Shell’s \ngas-to-liquids plant in Qatar, for example, runs on reused water.13 In oil-\nfield services, Halliburton is working with Nuverra, an environmental solu-\ntions provider to handle drilling solids and treat and recycle frac water.14  \nThe Italian oil and gas company Eni, for instance, reutilizes flare gas for \npower generation to benefit local populations in the Congo and Nigeria.15 \nIn addition, key opportunities downstream are enabling circularity by max-\nimizing utility in the end use (e.g., increased petrochemical plastics quality \nand durability) and the increased use of molecule-circulating loops.16\nThe third opportunity focuses on sustainable energy and fuels. In 2018, \nthe top O&G companies jointly spent around 1% of their budgets on \nclean energy, with many investments going into business acquisitions.17 \nWhile not a high percentage, it indicates that leaders in the industry are \nshifting their strategies. Consider the petroleum refining company Total \nS.A., which has been expanding into electricity through a number of \nacquisitions over the past five years, including acquiring Direct Energie \n(the French electric utility company) for more than $1.7 billion in 2018. \nThe company has also been growing its stake in the EV charging business \nthrough deals with ChargePoint, G2mobility, and others.18 Other major \nplayers, such as Chevron, BP, and Shell, are also starting to enter or scale \npresence in these spaces (e.g., Shell has already bought First Utility in the \nUK and is the main candidate to acquire the Netherlands-based Eneco \nHolding N.V.).19,20,21,22\n",

One company scaling CCUS \nis LanzaTech, which has innovated a biological catalyst (a bacteria) that \nconverts a variety of waste carbon pollution (such as industrial emis-\nsions and unsorted, unrecyclable plastic waste) into fuels and other prod-\nucts. Freya Burton, LanzaTech’s Chief Sustainability and People Officer, \ndescribes their approach as, “giving carbon a new lease on life by locking \nit into a material cycle.”\n•\t Schlumberger, one of the world’s largest oilfield services company, is \npiloting the use of customized smart glasses that provide real-time infor-\nmation, including live gauge readings, inspection and safety check-\nlists, inventory checks, and step-by-step procedure videos. The glasses \ncould help workers save time on routine tasks and improve equipment \nmaintenance.23\n•\t Oil and gas exploration and production company Apache Corporation \nhas gone a step further, using predictive analytics to anticipate the failure \nof critical pumping equipment.24\n•\t Researchers from Penn State University have found that industrial and \ndomestic waste could become a viable alternative source for engineering \nhigh-performance ceramic proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing.25\n  Obstacles to Overcome\nThe O&G industry is balancing the need to continue investments in opti-\nmizing the hydrocarbon value chain, while also simultaneously investing in \na low-carbon transition for a more sustainable, circular future.

Lacy et al.\n  Industry Status\nThe chemical industry is one of the largest and most diversified manufac-\nturing industries, producing intermediary and end products that are used \nby almost all other industries. Spurred to action by dwindling non-renew-\nable resources and stringent environmental regulations, the industry has \nstarted making progress toward circularity. This includes creating products \nwith renewable/sustainable inputs, making the transition from single use to \nmultiple uses (thus reducing total polymer demand), and minimizing haz-\nardous content leaking into the environment. “When it comes to business \ngrowth, the last decade was about volumes, but this decade is about a more \ninclusive definition of value and resource efficiency and effectiveness,” says \nSaori Dubourg, Board of Executive Directors, BASF, a German chemical \ncompany. “Across our entire portfolio, it was clear that circularity could help \nus minimize risks and capitalize on opportunities by changing our business \nmodels.”\n  Waste to Wealth Challenges\nChemical companies must address three major waste streams (see Fig. 7.1). \nThe first is the use of non-renewable resources as feedstock and as sources of \nenergy. About 8% of the world’s oil production is used to manufacture plas-\ntic, a number projected to rise to about 20% by 2050.7 Moreover, the chem-\nical industry is the world’s largest industrial energy consumer.8\nThe second major stream involves waste generated from the manufac-\nturing of chemicals, including process residues, spent catalysts or solvents, \nspilled oil, sludge, and contaminated chemical containers. The industry is \nresponsible for close to 200 of the world’s most polluted sites, potentially \nputting approximately three million people at the risk of exposure.9\nThe third large stream consists of waste generated from consumer prod-\nucts. Chemicals are the building blocks for many consumer goods—a typ-\nical car today contains approximately 250 kilograms of chemical content.2 \nPolymers, principally used to make plastic goods, constitute about 80% of \nthe chemical industry’s production output.10 According to a 2016 report \nby the World Economic Forum (WEF), about 95% of the value of plastic \npackaging material ($80 billion to $120 billion in economic value) is lost \nannually.11\n",

A number of technolo-\ngies are available today for producing chemicals out of renewable or diver-\nsified feedstock, and the renewable chemicals market alone is estimated to \nreach around $84.3 billion by 2020.16 DSM’s Decovery®, a plant-based, eco-\nfriendly resin, is one example of a recent innovation in this space. “We are \nscaling this innovation by engaging our value chain partners, from suppliers \nto customers and beyond, in order to accelerate the transition to bio/plant-\nbased paints & coatings,” says Feike Sijbesma, CEO of DSM.\nAnother significant opportunity is through reuse and recycling. In terms \nof reuse, technologically proven solutions for polyethylene terephthalate \n(PET) bottles and plastic shopping bags have been available for some time. \nThose approaches could conceivably be extended to other products like \nautomotive parts, components of electronic products, and white goods. In \nterms of recycling, the process can be either mechanical (collecting and pro-\ncessing used end products and then reinserting their intact molecules back \ninto the value chain further upstream without modifying their chemical \nbonds) or chemical (breaking up long-chain hydrocarbons into precursors). \nAn example of a mechanical recycling process is VinyLoop, a patented pro-\ncess developed by the Solvay Group, the Belgian chemicals company. The \nprocess separates PVC from other materials through the process of dissolu-\ntion filtration and separation of contaminants.17\nLastly, companies can enable the circular economy and digitization in \ndownstream industries—for example, more fuel-efficient cars require lighter \nmaterials, and more energy-efficient houses depend on better insulation. \nFor chemical companies, the opportunity lies in creating new ways to retain \na stake in the value of the molecule, with substantial potential payback. \nSuccessfully enabling circularity downstream is projected to drive additional \nand new demand for more sustainable chemicals, resulting in a potential \nincrease of 26% (from 2015 levels to 2030).18\n  Technology Amplifiers\nA range of advances in materials science, digital technologies, and other \nfields have unlocked various areas of opportunity:\n",

Lacy et al.\n  Industry Status\nThe electricity industry includes power generation and transmission and \ndistribution, serving customers from retail to commercial or residential. \nHeavily reliant on fossil fuels, the industry has been undergoing signifi-\ncant disruption with the emergence of clean fuels across its value chain. The \nglobal renewable energy market, which was valued at approximately $928 \nbillion in 2017, is projected to reach over $1.5 trillion by 2025.5 This is \nbeing driven by the rapid reduction in the cost of clean generation technol-\nogy, the digitization and decentralization of all aspects of the grid, and gov-\nernment policies aimed at promoting private-sector investments.\nIn 2017, global energy-related emissions reached a historic high and \nmany European countries have since begun to experience declines. This is \ndriven by a combination of factors, including the development of increas-\ningly cost-effective methods for capturing and sequestering carbon.6 \nAccording to one estimate, the global CCS market is expected to grow from \n$2.2 billion in 2016 to about $4.2 billion by 2022.7\n  Waste to Wealth Challenges\nThe industry has four major waste areas (see Fig. 8.1). The first is the use of \nnon-renewable resources with large carbon footprints for power generation. \nDespite industry attempts to decarbonize, coal consumption for electricity \ngeneration is growing almost at the same rate as that of electricity consump-\ntion: about 3% annually between 2000 and 2017.8\nThe second area is waste generated from plant operations. All fossil fuel \npower plants produce operational waste along with the significant quanti-\nties of GHG and air pollutants. In the United States, the electricity sector is \nresponsible for roughly 27.5% of the total GHG emissions, and coal com-\nbustion residues are the second most abundant waste material after house-\nhold waste.9,10\nThe third major area of waste is from energy losses. For electricity gen-\neration through steam turbines, 65% of the energy is wasted as heat.11 \nAdditional losses of about 8% occur through transmission and distribution \nbecause of technical inefficiencies and pilferage.12\nFinally, there is waste generated from the premature retirement of \nequipment and components. Plant lifetimes typically range from 30 to \n45 years for natural gas plants to 30–60 years for coal and nuclear plants.10  \n",

Companies could, for example, work with industrial \nequipment partners to offload end-of-use equipment and infrastructure \nto be repurposed, reutilized, or recycled. The value of scrap metal in used \nequipment can, in some cases, be high enough to fully offset the cost of \ndemolition.10 “We are using eco-design principles to collaborate with suppli-\ners in order to increase our use of easy-to-recover materials,” says Jean-Pascal \nTricoire, Chairman and CEO, Schneider Electric, a French multinational \ncorporation.\nIntelligent operations for electricity generation, transmission, distri-\nbution, and consumption illustrate the third area of opportunity. This \nincludes demand-supply forecasting, intelligent grids, smart meters, decen-\ntralized energy generation, and smart network management and consump-\ntion. With increased use of analytics, for example, companies could more \naccurately forecast demand and supply to minimize waste and maximize \nasset utility. Furthermore, electrical grids could be enabled for bidirectional \npower flows for “prosumers,” consumers who would sell excess energy from \ntheir rooftop solar or mini-wind systems. In total, these types of intelligent \nsystems across the supply chain have the potential to add about 5% of sales \nin EBITDA.19\n  Technology Amplifiers\nIn the future, a number of emerging innovations could play a prominent \nrole in helping companies to close the circular loop:\n•\t The city of Helsinki’s fully owned energy company “Helen” provides \nsolar technology for different properties that are then able to feed their \nexcessive solar power to a grid. The company is also developing solutions \nto recover waste heat from properties, as well as new geothermal energy \ntechnologies.20\n",

First, they must address the lack \nof policy support and government incentives that has inhibited the shift \nto circular opportunities. Even in countries where power production and \nsupply are completely privatized, government commitments to renewable \nenergy, tax structures, financial incentives, and trade policies will strongly \ndetermine the pace of the shift toward renewables and the level of customer \nparticipation. This is especially true in emerging markets where consumer \nawareness of (and thus demand for) cleaner alternative energy sources is \nlower.\nAnother major challenge is access to financing. Electric power genera-\ntion and distribution are among the most capital-intensive industries, and \nconsiderable funding is needed for any major initiative. For example, intel-\nligent grids equipped with smart meters and sensors have immense potential \nthat could be implemented at scale. Unfortunately, though, many regions \nlack the last-mile connectivity, data security protocols, and operational \ncapabilities necessary, and building that infrastructure will require sizable \ninvestments.\n",

The first \noccurs in manufacturing, which contributes large amounts of pollution \nthrough processes like casting, forging, machining, and welding.\nThe second major area of waste is with respect to capacity. It has been \nestimated that idle times in construction machinery can be attributed to \n40–60% of total running times.2\nThe third area is wasted valuable metals. Although metal recycling has \nbeen a success story when compared to other materials, there is still much \nthat can be done. Despite being the world’s most recycled material, only \n40% of global steel is produced using recycled input.8 Moreover, along with \nmetallic ores, virgin materials such as coal are still widely used across the \nindustry.\n  Waste to Wealth Opportunities\nAcross industries, M&IE has one of the largest opportunities in the cir-\ncular economy (see Table 9.2). M&IE customers find value in purchasing \nenergy- and material-efficient products that last longer, and they are willing \nto pay an upfront premium for longer-term savings. Major manufacturers \nlike Caterpillar, Toyota, and Okuma currently offer premium models, which \nthey could grow by incorporating a circular value proposition. In total, we \nexpect 5% of sales to be transferred from other products to premium circu-\nlar brands.\nAnother huge area of opportunity is circular business models that capital-\nize on long and costly product development times, combined with the value \nof materials used and relatively long lifecycles.

First, companies could extend \nequipment lifecycles and increase their utilization with service-oriented \n(as opposed to ownership) models that focus on repair, maintenance, and \nupgrades. To that end, designing for repairability/modularity and embed-\nding sensors in equipment can help enable cost-efficient maintenance, \nrepair, and upgrades.

And third, companies could also recover and reuse val-\nuable parts and metals at end of use, when repair and resale are no longer \neconomically feasible.\n  Technology Amplifiers\nIntensifying global competition and increasing commoditization are shift-\ning value pools from machinery products to software and services. Since \nhardware-driven growth is limited, M&IE companies are starting to move \ntoward digital solutions. These technologies have enabled companies to \ntap into new opportunities and develop platforms for implementation, for \nexample:\n•\t AMP Robotics  is using AI and robotics to fundamentally change the cost \nof recycling. AMP has successfully developed a new kind of sorting tech-\nnology for recycling facilities: the Cortex robot. It is capable of automat-\ning the separation of commodities with practically no retrofit or change \nto existing operations.13 Cortex robots are powered by Neuron—AI that \nperceives material in the dirty, commingled conditions found in facilities \ntoday.13\n•\t The tire company Michelin Solutions is focused on digital solutions for \ntheir customers, such as EFFIFUEL™—an ecosystem that uses sensors \ninside vehicles to collect data, like fuel consumption, tire pressure, tem-\nperature, speed, and location. This offering serves Michelin’s strong circu-\nlar vision and ambitions, so that customers can reduce carbon emissions \nwhile improving performance.14\n•\t Researchers at the Swedish Chalmers University of Technology developed \na new optimization algorithm for industrial equipment. By tweaking the \nacceleration in the movement of industrial robots, energy consumption \ncan be sliced by 40% while retaining the given production time.15\n  Obstacles to Overcome\nThe M&IE industry faces a number of challenges in moving toward cir-\ncularity.

That calls for strategic changes to better \nintegrate those functions, with the growing importance of sales and after-\nsales. Moreover, new sales strategies and operational changes would help \nscale customer interest and participation in new business models. This might \ninclude improving the infrastructure to handle remanufactured products, \nintegrating recovery into the sales model, and also scaling reverse logistics \nfor remanufacturing, which can be a significant barrier given the widespread \nglobal nature of delivery networks.\nPolicy and regulation changes will also be crucial to drive the market \nacceptance and pricing parity of remanufactured products (see Part III, \n“Policy—The Role of Policymakers”). Currently, remanufactured compo-\nnents are regarded as “used” products and cannot be sold or used in some \ncountries, despite having “as good as new” warranties by the OEM.16 With \nthe appropriate changes, reused/remanufactured components and products \nwill be considered equivalent to those made from virgin material, paving the \nway for their general acceptance.\n  Chapter Takeaways\nCircular business models can significantly address waste pools and unlock value \nbut will rely on changes to the current operating model.\nOpportunities\n•\t Rental, sharing, repair, and other models that increase equipment utiliza-\ntion and prolong lifecycles\n•\t Models that enable multiple product lifecycles via resale to second-use \nmarkets\n•\t Recovery models that enable valuable parts and metals to be reused\nTechnology amplifiers\n•\t Existing technologies like GPS and robotic systems can enable better moni-\ntoring and maintenance of equipment, which can then enable circular mod-\nels for machine in-use and parts recovery\nObstacles to overcome\n•\t Separation of sales and service (after-sales) teams limits customer interest \nand participation in new models for use and return\n•\t Due to the global spread of manufacturing, localized models are needed to \nenable reverse flows\n•\t Policies and regulations hinder market acceptance and pricing parity for \nremanufactured products\n",

Infrastructure needs will mount as advancements, such \nas artificial intelligence (AI), demand greater computational power, stor-\nage, and Internet speeds. In parallel, next-generation 5G wireless networks \nrequire hardware and software upgrades in global network infrastructure. \nMoreover, the transition to a low-carbon economy coupled with trends for \nenhanced user experience will drive the growing volume of electronics, such \nas those in smart appliances, vehicles, and wind- and solar-power generation \nsystems. This will lead to higher demand and price for key raw materials \nsuch as cobalt, copper, and rare earth metals.\nValue chains in this industry tend to stretch across the globe and, there-\nfore, are complex to disrupt from a circular perspective. This presents \nend-of-use challenges as the points of production and resource recovery \nare geographically dispersed.

On the enterprise technology \nside, servers are replaced every three to five years, on average.7 This tendency \nto prematurely replace existing products with newer models leads to two \nmajor pools of waste (see Fig. 10.1).\nThe first is wasted lifecycles. Because of soaring demand for the latest \ntechnologies, perfectly functioning devices and hardware are often replaced. \nOn average, people use their smartphones for only 22 months, even though \npotential use of those devices is much longer (around 4.7 years, as of \n2015).8\nThe second large waste pool is embedded value. Most ICT devices, \nenterprise technology equipment, and network infrastructure hardware \ncontain valuable materials currently not being recovered. In 2016, 44.7 \nmillion tons of e-waste were generated globally (of which only about 20% \nis currently documented to be collected and recycled).9 For that year, the \nvalue of raw materials alone in global e-waste streams was estimated at \n55 billion euros.9\n",

Accenture analysis concluded that shifting to a rental \nmodel of routers led to an 80% reduction in material losses and 45% reduc-\ntion in CO2 emissions compared to the linear model due to superior recov-\nery and collection rates. Furthermore, reusing recovered routers led to a \n35% cost savings, demonstrating the multi-tiered value opportunities of new \nbusiness models.15\nRecovery of valuable materials from ICT devices at end of use presents \nthe second area of opportunity. A typical iPhone contains an estimated 25 \ngrams of aluminum and 15 grams of copper, as well as much smaller but \nsignificant amounts of valuable metals like gold, silver, and platinum.16 \nRecycling end-of-use consumer devices and reselling embedded materials \nsuch as glass, plastics, and metal can deliver an estimated $2.5–5 billion of \nincremental revenue.17\nRedesigning for less material use is the third area of opportunity. Smarter \ndesigns could reduce material use in parts like casings for consumer devices \nand product packaging, enabling the industry to realize an estimated $10–\n20 billion value opportunity through reduced cost of materials and pack-\naging. Circular design principles can also cost-effectively extend use of a \nproduct. The abovementioned Accenture analysis on routers found that \ncertain design choices (e.g., using scratch-resistant materials) can reduce \nrefurbishment costs by about 50%. At Cisco, the goal is to enable product \ndesigners to consider different ways to extend a product’s use, to make disas-\nsembly easier, and to incorporate other circular principles. “We want to get \nto a place where a Circular Design decision is the default choice, as long as \nit has equivalent cost and performance,” says John Kern, Cisco’s Senior Vice \nPresident of Supply Chain Operations.\n  Technology Amplifiers\nCompanies are developing innovative ways to create cost efficiencies \nthroughout the ICT value chain, leveraging technology to enable circular \nsolutions.

In response, companies must address two key \nchallenges.\nThe first is collection at end of use. Consumers often do not return \ntheir unwanted ICT devices after upgrading to a newer model. One \nsolution would be new business models that allow companies to provide \naccess to products while retaining ownership, thus facilitating controlled \ntakeback at end of use. Another solution is to offer customers product \ntakeback incentives. According to an Accenture consumer survey, 74% \nof consumers are most encouraged to participate in a product takeback \nprogram that provides convenient returns or incentives, like discounts or \nreward points.21 Apple’s trade-in program, for example, offers custom-\ners credit for eligible devices, regardless of the model or condition, along \nwith convenient return options via prepaid return shipping or at any store \nlocation.22\nThe other challenge is e-waste.

It is important to distinguish between indirect and direct \ncircularity in this industry. Specifically, macrotrends such as vehicle sharing, \nalternative drivetrains (moving away from internal combustion engines), \nand autonomous vehicles are separate from the “pure play” (or direct) cir-\ncular economy transformations. With these macrotrends, inefficiencies such \nas indirect emissions remain unaddressed, with an unintended net negative \nimpact on the environment—if car travel becomes more convenient, then \nthe total distance traveled by vehicles will likely increase, resulting in more \nvehicles being manufactured and energy being consumed.12 Direct circular \nuptake, on the other hand, targets resource utilization inefficiencies head-on, \ni.e., decreasing energy and material intensity in manufacturing.\nGiven this distinction, the industry has taken significant but “indirect” \nsteps toward circularity, with the greatest progress in fuel efficiency and tail-\npipe emissions reduction. Jaguar Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and \nother automakers have already committed to partial or full-fleet electrifi-\ncation in the next five to ten years. Vehicle sharing and pooling highlight \nanother disruption, illustrated by the popularity of DriveNow and ZipCar. \nBy 2030, one in 10 cars is expected to be a shared vehicle.13 Despite these \nareas of notable progress, manufacturing remains heavily resource intensive, \nand end-of-use vehicles generate millions of tons of waste every year.\n  Waste to Wealth Challenges\nThe personal mobility industry incurs four major areas of waste (see \nFig. 11.1). The first lies in manufacturing: 20% of total GHG emissions for \ninternal combustion engine vehicles and as much as 47% for battery EVs \nare generated during the production phase.14 In addition, around 110 kilo-\ngrams of waste is generated in manufacturing a vehicle.5 The second area is \nwasted capacity. On average, automobiles have low utilization rates—typi-\ncally 5 to 10%—leaving $7 trillion worth of passenger cars unused at any \none time.1,15 The “use phase” also has a high waste footprint. This includes \ncarbon (road transport accounting for 17% of global GHG emissions), \nin addition to other wastes such as microplastics shed from tires, precious \nmetals particles emitted by catalytic converters, wasted embedded value \n",

In Europe, privately \nowned cars have an estimated average age of 9.7 years with 12 million vehi-\ncles being taken off the road every year.19,20 This equates to millions of tons \nof potentially valuable waste from end-of-use vehicles.21\nFig. 11.1  Waste analysis diagram\n",

Lacy et al.\n  Waste to Wealth Opportunities\nThere are three big areas of opportunity in this industry (see Table 11.2). \nThe first comes from the large shift to alternative drivetrains. EVs alone had \na global share of 4.6% of new sales in 2018, nearly doubling since 2017.22 \nThis shift highlights an opportunity to greatly reduce mobility emissions in \nthe use phase.\nVehicle and ride sharing present another intriguing area of opportu-\nnity. Through 2030, we expect 11% of car sales to migrate to the sharing \neconomy (as a new consumption model), putting automakers on notice to \ninnovate their business models to stay competitive.28 The IT products and \nservices company Fujitsu America expects use of shared cars to increase \nover 50% by 2030.29 Sale and reuse of remanufactured components via \nafter-markets is the third area of opportunity. Currently, remanufactured \nparts are sold at 50–70% of their original price, with hefty environmental \nsavings (up to 80% less energy, 88% less water, 92% fewer chemical prod-\nucts, and 70% less waste production).20\nReducing the resource intensity of manufacturing vehicles and waste \nresulting from production processes opens another window of opportunity. \nSmart manufacturing and technologies such as Industrial IoT, data analyt-\nics, and robotics can make production more efficient, resulting in leaner \noperations while also reducing recall rates from faulty parts. According to \nthe European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) in 2018, the \nCO2 emissions from vehicle manufacturing in Europe have fallen by more \nthan a fifth since 2008.31\n  Technology Amplifiers\nAdvances in materials science, AI, big data analytics, and other technologies \nhave meant that companies can seize some of the circular value of EVs and \nride sharing. In the future, emerging innovations could stimulate further \nadvances. Among the more interesting examples:\n•\t AI-based generative design technology: The American automotive com-\npany General Motors, for instance, has partnered with software company \nAutodesk to rapidly explore multiple permutations of a part’s design, \npotentially resulting in cars with smaller environmental footprints.32\n",

No metal or traditional \nplastics were used for the structural parts of the vehicle.35\n•\t The combination of hardware and software technologies has led to the \ndevelopment of autonomous driving, with better fuel efficiency and \nenergy utilization. The start of 2018 heralded a wave of hype for auton-\nomous vehicles, with Alphabet’s Waymo well on its way to launching a \ndriverless taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, and Uber’s efforts to log mil-\nlions of test miles with its fleet of self-driving vehicles.36\n•\t Telematics allows vehicles to share data with the outside world. Predictive \nmaintenance based on telematics data and forward-looking projections is \nbecoming more intelligent.37 The ability to predict a service event could \npotentially result in considerable material and energy savings, especially \nfor cargo vehicles and larger fleet operators.\n  Obstacles to Overcome\nAt the current rate of adoption, an estimated 11 million tons of spent lith-\nium-ion batteries from EVs will need to be recycled by 2030.38 Many of \nthose “spent” batteries still have up to 70% capacity left, and automakers \nlike Tesla, Nissan, and BMW have been working on second-use options, \nsuch as using the batteries as stationary power sources.38,39 Tesla, a leader in \nthis area, introduced stationary energy storage products in 2015.40 In 2018, \nNissan used 148 Leaf batteries (both new and used) to power Amsterdam’s \nsoccer stadium.39,41\nSecond-use options would also mitigate increased supply risks, as electrifi-\ncation and digitization of vehicles have created a surge in demand for metals \nand minerals. Demand for lithium chemicals, most of which are destined for \nbatteries, rose by nearly a third in 2018 from the previous year.42 Similarly, \nthe global demand for refined cobalt, another key input in batteries, almost \ntripled from 2000 to 2016.43\n",

In developing coun-\ntries, the required infrastructure for managed vehicle end-of-use process-\ning is largely non-existent, with fragmented and largely informal recycling \nindustries.44 In developed economies, in contrast, most cars are retired \nbefore the end of their full use potential. Although vehicle recycling rates \nare high in these geographies, most of the resultant material streams are \ngenerally of low quality and therefore find application in lower-value goods \nand industries, such as construction. There are, however, technical oppor-\ntunities for innovation to address this and convert today’s downcycling to \nfuture upcycling, particularly for metals and some plastics.45 In Europe, the \nEnd of Life Vehicles Directive stipulates that the industry must ensure that \n95% of a vehicle by weight is reused, recycled, or recovered; future regula-\ntions could address the need for upcycling. European-based manufacturers \nseized the opportunity to demonstrate that such high recovery levels can be \nachieved profitably.9 Renault, for example, set up its ICARRE95 project col-\nlaboration to increase the recycling rate of end-of-use vehicles by developing \ntechnological and economic structures for the recycling of their materials.46 \nToday, more than a third of the total mass of Renault vehicles manufactured \nin Europe comes from recycled materials.47\n  Chapter Takeaways\nCircular economy initiatives can address waste pools and unlock significant \nvalue. A key focus area is increasing visibility into material flows across the \ncomplex global supply chain.\nOpportunities\n•\t Shift toward EVs, reducing the environmental impact of cars during the use \nphase\n•\t Car-sharing and rental business models, increasing the utilization of vehicles\n•\t Reuse and remanufacturing of components, recovering valuable resources \nfrom vehicles\n•\t Increasing efficiency and reducing waste during manufacturing, allowing \nfor leaner operations and reducing recall rates from faulty parts\nTechnology amplifiers\n•\t Robotics for disassembly, which can enable recovery and remanufacturing\n•\t Digital platforms for car-sharing models\n•\t Predictive maintenance\nObstacles to overcome\n•\t Lack of adequate infrastructure for end-of-use management\n•\t Increased supply risk due to surging demand for metals such as lithium for \nbatteries\n•\t E-waste from lithium batteries\n",

Lacy et al.\n  Industry Status\nHousehold products such as furniture, white goods, and appliances typi-\ncally have long-term use and tend to be relatively expensive purchases. But \nincreasing demand for cheaper, more accessible items—associated with the \ngrowing middle-class population and product innovation—has led to use \nof low-quality materials and poor design standards that don’t consider reuse \nand use extension.\nWith a few notable exceptions, the industry has been slow to adopt circu-\nlar principles, and recycling remains a challenge. In the EU, more than 80% \nof furniture is either incinerated or sent to landfill.8 On the appliance side, \nmore than 80% of all e-waste isn’t properly recycled, and about 60% (by \nweight) comes from large and small kitchen, bathroom, and laundry appli-\nances.9 In the United States, 38% of the white goods or major appliances \nwere landfilled in 2015 (EPA).10\nThat said, various drivers are pushing the boundaries of the industry’s lin-\near economics. The supply of raw inputs is now becoming volatile, spark-\ning price increases in several markets.11 Demand has also shifted toward \n“sustainable modern living,” with eco-conscious and technology-savvy con-\nsumers buying products that are energy efficient, environmentally friendly, \nergonomic, digitally enabled, high quality, and durable. A 2013 study found \nthat 71% of households say energy efficiency is very important to them, \nwith a more recent survey revealing that 76% are planning to increase their \nhome’s energy efficiency.12\n  Waste to Wealth Challenges\nThere are three major areas of waste (see Fig. 12.1). The first occurs during \nthe resource-intensive manufacturing process. In the EU, nearly one billion \nsmall and large home appliances are purchased every year, requiring about \nsix million tons of raw materials.13 Additionally, the manufacturing process \nuses toxic chemicals including flame retardants, mercury, lead, hydrofluoro-\ncarbons (HFCs), and phthalates.\nThe second major waste area occurs during product usage. For the aver-\nage household in the United States, home appliances account for 40% of \ntotal energy consumption and laundry accounts for 40% of water consump-\ntion.14,15 Microwave ovens alone have been estimated to emit 7.7 million tons \nof CO2 per year in the EU, an amount equivalent to auto emissions.16\n",

On average, home appliances have a useful \nlife of 8–10 years yet they are often replaced sooner, presenting companies \nwith a potentially lucrative area of opportunity.17 “At Philips, we are already \ninvesting in sustainable products which do no harm to the environment. \nHowever, when these products come to the end of their use cycle you need \nto think about how to ‘close the loop’ for those products that you have sold \nFig. 12.1  Waste analysis diagram\n",

Therefore, we work with our suppliers to avoid \ntoxic materials in the first place and are developing a reverse-supply-chain \ncollaboration to recapture components at the highest possible level,” says \nFrans van Houten, CEO of Philips, a Dutch multinational conglomerate.\n  Waste to Wealth Opportunities\nWe estimate the total value at stake for the household industry at $5–$10 \nbillion (EBITDA addition) or 1–3% of sales in 2030 (market size: \n$310 billion).18 There are three main areas of opportunity (see Table 12.2).\nCircular materials as inputs in manufacturing showcase the first opportu-\nnity. Circular materials in furniture production can slice resource consump-\ntion by 50% and environmental impact by 30% versus linear models.22 To \nthat end, Steelcase, the world’s leading manufacturer of office furniture and \na circular economy industry pioneer, has 50+ Cradle to Cradle Certified™ \nproducts and a continuous focus on improvement in design.23 The company \nworks with its suppliers to optimize the chemical profiles of the materials \nused, to increase the reuse of its products, among other innovations.\nThe second area of opportunity is charging premium prices for products \nthat feature increased efficiency, greater durability, and reduced environ-\nmental footprint. Unlike other industries, circular household products can \ncommand a premium because consumers find value in purchasing efficient, \nlonger-lasting appliances, and other items.24 The German automation com-\npany Siemens’ energy-efficient appliances command a 27% price premium, \naccording to Accenture analysis. In addition, advanced circular products can \ngenerate new revenue streams through enhanced customer experiences for \nbrands with experience-based consumption models.\nNew business models for repair, reuse, recovery, and product as a ser-\nvice represent the third area of opportunity. In 2018, IKEA, the world’s \nbiggest producer of affordable design furniture, received more than one \nmillion orders for spare parts from customers who were able to per-\nform do-it-yourself repairs, thanks to the company’s modular product \ndesigns.25 In Northern Europe, the Swedish home appliance manufacturer \nElectrolux is installing its high-quality washing machines in customer \nhomes, with the appliances connected to a dedicated measuring device \nthat enables the company to track not only the number of washing cycles \nbut also the settings used (e.g., cold versus hot wash). Through this smart \nmetering system, Electrolux is able to offer customers a “pay per-wash” \nservice.26\n",

For example:\n•\t In China, Haier Group, the manufacturing owner of GE Appliances, uses \nIoT to remotely monitor water quality in its washing machines. The data \nis then fed into a software that adapts the washing program to ensure \noptimal results.27\n•\t Modular designs have allowed IKEA to implement a Product Use \nExtension model, and 3D printing has given rise to the possibility of \nfaster prototyping and production on demand, shortening the design and \ndevelopment cycle of furniture pieces.28\n•\t Oak Ridge National Laboratory and General Electric are developing a \nnew type of dryer that uses a heat pump cycle to generate hot air for dry-\ning. The resulting, more efficient dryer has the potential to reduce energy \nconsumption by 60% compared to conventional models.29\n•\t Bundles, a Netherlands-based company, designs technology to offer appli-\nances on a pay-per-use basis. The company uses IoT technology to mon-\nitor products and reduce energy, water, and detergent use and provides \nmaintenance and refurbishment service to prolong product use.30\n  Obstacles to Overcome\nA huge challenge for the household industry is the need for a more estab-\nlished reverse logistics, collection, and recycling infrastructure. Producers \ncurrently lack incentives to make the necessary investments, and the costs \nwould offset any benefits to be gained from material recovery or recycling of \nhousehold appliances. Today, only about 10% of furniture and roughly 20% \nof e-waste are being recycled.8,31\nAnother considerable barrier is limited customer awareness and demand. \nDespite burgeoning interest in circular household products, widespread \nawareness is still lacking. Instead, the furniture market has been experi-\nencing the growth of a fast-moving, low-cost, and low-quality segment. \nFurthermore, customers are rarely given proper guidance on how to main-\ntain, repair, or responsibly recycle home goods. Companies can do a great \ndeal to help consumers overcome this obstacle.\n",

Driven by rising concern for reducing \nplastic consumption, companies have launched initiatives to use less packaging \nor design packaging for easier reuse, recycling, or composting. FMCG com-\npanies like Unilever, Nestlé, and Danone have all set targets for 100% of their \nplastic packaging to be fully reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025.7\n  Waste to Wealth Challenges\nThe industry faces three major areas of waste (see Fig. 13.1). The first is raw \nmaterials. The choice of ingredients or input materials has a big impact on \na product’s footprint, from the caloric efficiency and resource use of food \nand beverages to the chemical toxicity in beauty and skincare items. With \nfood products, for example, meat and dairy require significant inputs for \nrelatively little caloric gain due to their high feed conversion ratios—for \ninstance, producing one kilogram of beef requires over 15,000 liters of \nwater.8 Globally, agriculture uses 70% of the planet’s freshwater supply.9\nThe second area of waste occurs in production and handling. The indus-\ntry relies heavily on agriculture, which accounts for most freshwater con-\nsumption and tropical/subtropical deforestation, erosion, and pesticide \nuse. Current agricultural practices generate a range of pollutants that often \nrunoff into water environments with a range of associated risks to human \nand ecosystem health.10 Moreover, food systems account for 20–30% of \nall human-caused greenhouse gas emissions globally.11 Studies have shown \nthat everyday consumer products are responsible for over one-third of air \npollutants.12\nThe third major area is material and packaging waste across the value \nchain. Globally, one-third of food ($1 trillion in retail value) is lost or \nwasted due to overproduction, product and packaging damage, and/or tech-\nnical malfunctions.2 Toast Ale brews award-winning craft beer using fresh, \nsurplus bread from bakeries and sandwich makers that would otherwise go \nto waste.13 The bread replaces one-third of the virgin malted barley required \nin brewing, and the company has been aggressively scaling its business \nthrough contracting and licensing, from over 11 tons of bread to a 2020 \n",

Lacy et al.\n  Waste to Wealth Opportunities\nEnormous opportunities exist for FMCG companies to differentiate, espe-\ncially by appealing to more selective consumers. Millennial and Gen Z \nconsumers are increasingly expecting companies to be sustainable and are \nmigrating to smaller, more purpose-driven brands. We predict a 4% migra-\ntion in sales per annum to products with more sustainable packaging.15 \nOverall, the total value at stake for the industry from circular packaging \nopportunities is estimated at $30 billion to $110 billion (EBITDA addition) \nor 1–4% of sales in 2030 (market size: $3.2 trillion).15 More broadly across \nthe value chain, companies should pay attention to the following three areas \nof opportunity (see Table 13.2).\nThe first is improving efficiency and reducing inputs and waste along the \nproduction stages of the value chain, starting with substitute raw material \ninputs. Consider the plant-based protein movement. Given the massive \nburden that meat and dairy production places on natural resources, alter-\nnative protein sources can alleviate pressure on finite resources, freeing up \nvast amounts of land currently used for crops and livestock. Plant-based pro-\ntein is increasingly popular, with pioneering companies such as Impossible \nFoods offering their signature Impossible Burger at more than 7000 restau-\nrants globally.20 Companies such as Tyson Foods and Nestlé are also invest-\ning heavily in this space.\nThe second area of opportunity is designing products that require less \nmaterial, are less toxic, or are made from recycled or recyclable material. \n“Our responsibility for our product goes beyond the last sip. We are com-\nmitted to having 100 percent of our product in packaging that is returnable \nor made from majority recycled content by 2025. Closing the loop and reus-\ning materials is good for the planet and good for our business,” says Tony \nMilikin from AB InBev.\nNew models to increase recovery and recycling present a third major area \nof opportunity. Loop, TerraCycle’s recently launched “milkman model reim-\nagined,” is a circular shopping platform that focuses on the packaging of \neveryday essentials like shampoos and toothpaste, transforming them from \nsingle-use disposables to durable, refillable, and feature-packed designs. \n“Loop arose to shift single-use goods to multi-use,” explains Tom Szaky, \nCEO of TerraCycle. “We quickly discovered that moving from disposable to \ndurable designs enables new types of relationships between consumers, busi-\nnesses, and products.”\n",

Innovative examples include:\n•\t Product tracking technologies—from blockchain to graphene labels that \ncan be “tattooed” directly on the skins of certain foods—offer new ways \nto reduce food that gets lost or wasted.21 Researchers in Genoa, Italy, have \ndiscovered a way to add electronic components to temporary tattoos, pav-\ning the way for “smart” electronics that could be transferred onto food \nor pills.21 This breakthrough technology could monitor food supply and \neven track what’s going on in our bodies.\n•\t A revolution in bio-based technologies offers other promising possibili-\nties. The food tech startup Apeel Sciences is using plant extracts derived \nfrom discarded agricultural by-products to create invisible tasteless coat-\nings that extend the shelf life of fresh products by five times for some \nproduct varieties.22\n•\t Bite Toothpaste has developed tablets that could displace the one billion \ntoothpaste tubes that are thrown away annually.23 Such technical innova-\ntions in packaging have been transforming the industry, with innovative \nbrands reimagining staple products in ways that eliminate the need for \npackaging altogether.\n•\t Indian conglomerate ITC has launched an initiative that leverages IT to \nvirtually connect value chain participants in agriculture.

In production, regenerative agri-\nculture, and healthier eating habits are gaining traction, with $5.7 trillion \na year spent globally on health, environmental, and economic costs of food \nproduction.25 FMCGs like Danone have been looking at how circular prin-\nciples can transform the food system from farm to fork, for instance by tran-\nsitioning toward production models that renew soil health and regenerate \nnatural systems.26 Eric Soubeiran, VP for Nature and Water Cycles stated: \n“Agriculture is at the center of many of the challenges we face today, from \nclimate change to biodiversity loss. By transforming farming practices, \nagriculture can be part of the solution. At Danone, we are working with a \nrange of partners to develop and promote regenerative agriculture practices \nthat reduce GHG emissions and sequestrate more carbon in the soil, pre-\nserve water resources and enhance biodiversity. All of this while empowering \nfarmers and protecting animal welfare.”\nOn the other side of the supply chain, current consumption patterns face \nmultiple challenges. In cities, for example, less than 2% of nutrients in food \nand organic wastes (excluding manure) are re-inserted back into nutrient \ncycles, losing potential value, and adding to future environmental costs.27 \nSome companies are approaching the food waste challenge in novel ways. \nOddbox, a social enterprise tackling food waste, for example, is changing the \nperception of edible fruits and vegetable that do not make it onto super-\nmarkets’ shelves due to aesthetic standards and sells boxes of “wonky veg \nand freaky fruit,” reducing food waste and providing customers with a local, \nseasonal, and cheaper food source. To date the company has given value to \nnearly 1 m kgs of food produce that would have otherwise gone to waste \nand saved nearly 1.5 m kgs of CO2e.28\nConsumer awareness is another challenge. Companies can harness the \npower of advertising to shape a new consumer culture that embraces circu-\nlarity instead of promoting excessive consumption. By engaging consum-\ners, companies can be more agile in testing concepts while reducing waste. \nP&G, for example, turned to crowdfunding platform Indiegogo to test \na prototype of their recent razor innovation for the Gillette brand before \nreaching the production phase. This enabled them to raise awareness, gauge \ninterest, and solicit direct consumer feedback.29\nFinally, policymakers have an important role to play. Government sup-\nport will be critical to building out the needed infrastructure. Tightening \nregulations on materials and products, such as laws that incentivize returns \nand bans on use of specific materials, will help fuel an industry-wide tran-\nsition.

Moreover, over the last two decades, \nfast retailing has transformed the market, with many customers now treat-\ning clothing as nearly disposable. The typical consumer wears a clothing \nitem only for a fraction of its useful life before disposing it, contributing \nto a doubling in clothing production over the past 15 years.6 The current \nlinear operating model is under the microscope as environmental and social \nstresses continue to mount around the world.7\nThese industry dynamics have led to growing interest in circular solutions. \nMany companies have had some success in addressing waste in their most \ndirect operations. Some firms have also begun to work with Tier 1 factory \nsuppliers on waste in manufacturing. These efforts, however, represent rela-\ntively small parts of the value chain. The bottom line is that closing the loop \nis going to take a great deal more effort.\n  Waste to Wealth Challenges\nThe current linear value chain is heavily reliant on virgin materials from \nnon-renewable sources. This includes fertilizers to grow cotton, oil to man-\nufacture synthetic fibers, various chemicals to produce dye, and so on. That, \nalong with clothing increasingly being treated as disposable, has led to waste \nchallenges across the entire value chain (see Fig. 14.1).\nThe first thing to consider is the material mix. The choice of materi-\nals has a large impact on the overall footprint of clothing from cultivation \n(land, fertilizer, water use) to processing (energy, chemical and water use) \nto use (microplastics pollution) and ultimately recyclability at end of use. \nConventional cotton, for example, consumes significant amounts of inputs. In \nfact, it takes 20,000 liters of water to produce a single T-shirt and pair of jeans.8\nResource-intensive production is another large waste area. The industry’s \ncarbon emissions are expected to more than double by 2025.6 Moreover, the \nprocessing stage consumes considerable energy, and the spinning and rinsing \nof fibers can also be chemical and water intensive, with water pollution an \nissue of growing concern.\nThe third waste area is product disposability. The lack of an infrastructure \nfor collection and recycling means that an excessive amount of clothing ends \nup in landfills. Globally, just 20% of clothing is reused or recycled.9\n",

When done effectively, oversupplies and \nwaste are reduced, ultimately helping to decouple input use from processes.\nThe third area of opportunity is new business models, including re-com-\nmerce, rental, and repair. These can give consumers access to high-quality \nfashion without the commitment and cost of ownership, while also encour-\naging companies to design for longevity/multiple uses and to ensure end-of-\nuse garment collection. The successful launch of businesses such as Rent the \nRunway has shown there is a market for a new type of ownership based on \nsubscription, especially among millennial consumers.15 A recent Accenture \nand Fashion for Good research collaboration suggested that these new busi-\nness models could be economically viable across a range of categories, from \nmid-market to luxury.16 But getting these complex models right will require \ncollaboration between disruptive start-ups, traditional retailers, and emerg-\ning software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers. As well as subscription rental \nservices, incumbent fashion retailers are also increasingly looking to realize \nvalue from the secondary market, based on the success of businesses such as \nthe RealReal in the United States.17\n  Technology Amplifiers\nWe see a number of promising innovations on the horizon in the fashion \nindustry, including the following:\n•\t Innovation in materials science is increasing the availability of alternative \nsustainable materials, including a flood of promising bio-based alternatives \nand materials derived from waste by-products. PrimaLoft, which makes the \nmicrofiber insulation that fills jackets made by brands like L.L. Bean, has \nspent five years innovating a new insulation made from 100% recycled pol-\nyester, which they aim to biodegrade if it ends up in landfill or oceans.18\n",

Yet, \ndespite a shift in consumer attitudes in certain markets, production continues \nto rise. “We are still only ‘managing harm’ and not really environmentally posi-\ntive,” notes Rick Ridgeway, Patagonia’s VP of Public Engagement.\nScalable solutions will be essential to address the waste problems in any \nmeaningful way.

However, what cuts \nacross these three (and arguably, all industries) is the role of e-commerce.\nThe E-Commerce Boom\nOver the last two decades, online and mobile technologies have dramatically \ntransformed the retail industry. Today, the world’s largest retailers are mas-\nsive omnichannel conglomerates with complex value chains, making them \nkey figures in any move toward greater circularity. To appreciate the central \nrole these companies can play, we first need to understand the basic dynam-\nics of the industry.\nIn 1995, when the global e-commerce conglomerate Amazon first began \nselling books, online shopping was a new phenomenon. By 2019, total \nonline sales were higher than in-store sales of general merchandise in the \nUnited States.1 E-commerce has taken off, thanks to its ability to meet soci-\nety’s growing demand for just-in-time products at the same or even less cost \nthan traditional stores. The combination of reduced transactional costs, the \nubiquity of devices, and the growing sophistication of AI and tremendous \nincreases in electronic data has made e-commerce attractive for just about \nevery industry. Online retailers now sell everything from garments and \nconsumer electronics to vehicles, logistics, web services, financial products, \nhome services, and mortgages.\n15\nE-Commerce Meets the Circular Economy\n© The Author(s) 2020 \nP.

This has been most visible in China \nwhere nearly 400 million people are now considered to be middle class and, \ntherefore, have more spending capacity.2 The resulting sales figures are stag-\ngering: Online shopping makes up one in seven retail purchases worldwide, \naccounting for about $3.5 trillion in 2019.3 Accenture research found that \nonline channels, which used to be the least productive conduit to sales, are \nexhibiting an annual growth rate of 8.8% that far exceeds growth rates of \nother channels. Sales in traditional large-format stores, for example, are \ngrowing by just 2.7%.4\nThe explosion of global connectivity, contract manufacturing, and turn-\nkey pack-and-ship logistics has enabled even individual entrepreneurs to go \nfrom an idea to scaling a multimillion-dollar business from anywhere in the \nworld within weeks. Amazon’s Fulfilment by Amazon business program, for \nexample, enables small businesses to leverage its platform, infrastructure, and \nwide distribution network to sell their products. According to the company, \nmore than one million small businesses in the United States (and over two \nmillion globally) utilize the online marketplace to sell products. Using this \nservice, the businesses get access to Amazon Prime’s free two-day shipping, as \nwell as the company’s customer service and returns.5 Similarly, online mar-\nketplaces such as Alibaba, Etsy, eBay, and others have also provided small \nbusinesses with the platform and tools to reach millions of customers.\nA More Sustainable Option?\nThere is no clear consensus on whether e-commerce channels or brick and \nmortar stores have more substantial environmental footprints.6,7 The ongo-\ning technological transformation of the retail industry has, from a sus-\ntainability and circular economy perspective, been both promising and \nchallenging. On the one hand, it offers an unprecedented opportunity for \nsustainable optimization of the retail value chain through, for example, more \nefficient sourcing, production, warehousing, and distribution. On the other \nhand, it has been an engine for fueling unsustainable consumption levels \nand habits—larger quantities of both higher- and lower-value items, more \nfrequent orders, faster (even same-day) deliveries, with more return options \n(e.g., allowing consumers to buy multiple sizes of garments in ­different \ncolors to try at home and then return). Global retail leaders will need to \ndevelop better, more sophisticated, strategies for balancing growth with \nenvironmental impact.\n",

By applying circular principles, companies can increase their \ncompetitiveness and develop stronger, longer-lasting connections with cus-\ntomers. Walmart, a US multinational retail corporation, for example, has \nstarted to embrace circularity and has committed to achieving zero waste \nto landfill from operations in the United States, UK, Canada, and Japan by \n2025.8 In 2017, the company published a study on the emissions implica-\ntions of different retail channels, as part of the conversation about the retail \nindustry and its potential to reduce the carbon emissions associated with the \ndelivery of products.9\nFaced with growing concerns over product and packaging waste, Amazon \ninvested $10 million in recycling solutions in partnership with the Closed \nLoop Fund in 2018, making it easier for customers and communities to \nrecycle.10 The online retailer has also launched Amazon Second Chance: \na “one-stop shop for Amazon customers to learn how to minimize their \nimpact on the environment through reuse, refurbishing, and recycling.”11 \nIn China, where the e-commerce retail market transaction size in 2017 \nexceeded that of France, Germany, the UK, Japan, and the United States \ncombined, Tencent and Alibaba, two major players in China’s e-commerce \nlandscape, have made considerable investments in the circular economy.12 \nFor example, Alibaba, the world’s largest online retailer, invested in a sec-\nond-hand electronics recycling platform, a consumer electronic rental plat-\nform, a sharing platform for clothes, as well as a consumer-to-business \n(C2B) recycling business that offers ATM machines where users can recycle \ntheir mobile phones and get paid.13 One online store has gone a step fur-\nther to support the circular economy by creating a hub where people can \neasily find sustainable products—the Cradle to Cradle Marketplace is a \nUK-based start-up that only sells Cradle to Cradle Certified™ eco-friendly \nproducts.14\nThe global retail industry has the opportunity to be a positive force for \nchange, helping to make consumption more circular. Some progress has \nbeen made by industry leaders, but to maintain momentum and go further \nthe industry needs to scale its uptake of circularity. It should integrate cir-\ncular economy principles at the heart of the decision-making process when \ndetermining the optimal distribution channel mix. Last-mile delivery mod-\nels, the final step of the delivery process from a distribution facility to the \nend user is regarded as a major challenge for e-commerce players and could \nbe leveraged to launch reverse logistics businesses.

Leading companies across indus-\ntries show clear progress, but they are just scratching the surface in terms of \nunlocking the full potential of circular business models and technologies. So, \nwhat’s needed to accelerate that transition?\nAchieving growth and profitability while deploying circular initiatives and \ntechnology solutions is no small task. Such undertakings have inherent risks and \nrequire substantial investments in resources and capabilities. In our research, we \nhave found that organizations successful in getting such major initiatives under-\nway did three things simultaneously: (1) they transformed the existing value \nchain to remove waste, reduce value erosion, and drive up investment capacity; \n(2) they grew the core business organically with circular offerings embedded to \nsustain fuel for investments; and (3) they invested in disruptive growth oppor-\ntunities that would take their journey to circularity to the next level.\nJumping feet first into all three actions at once—what Accenture calls a \n“wise pivot” (see Fig. 16.1)—requires thoughtful and deliberate coordi-\nnation across and outside the organization.1 The wise pivot is a pragmatic \napproach for a company to continuously reinvent itself in an age of disrup-\ntion, a roadmap that can hasten the transition from a linear to a circular \nbusiness. Without such an enterprise-wide effort, companies will find it hard \nto scale their circular efforts and gain competitive advantage.\nThe need to manage transformation and reinvention is not new, but the busi-\nness environment has changed.

It requires quicker responses, cross-functional solutions, and often \nentirely new business models and processes. Companies must know not just what \nand where to change but also how to pivot to new business models and technol-\nogies when implementing a circular strategy. And, as many executives now rec-\nognize, participating in the circular economy has become the new imperative for \norganizations to grow sustainably. So, it’s not a matter of “should we go circular?” \nbut “which models make the most sense for my business and how do I get there \nwhile remaining competitive?” In other words, transitioning to circular business \nmodels is essential for any business to grow and remain competitive in today’s \nenvironment. “This is imperative for our survival,” says Christopher Davis, \nInternational Director of Corporate Social Responsibility and Campaigns at The \nBody Shop International, a cosmetics skincare and perfume company. “If you \nthink about starting a business today, designing a business around a circular econ-\nomy philosophy, ultimately it’s going to give you better returns in the long run.”1\nFour Dimensions of a Successful Transformation\nSo how, exactly, do companies successfully implement a wise pivot to circularity? \nFirst, firms must mature across four fundamental dimensions (see Fig. 16.2):\nFig. 16.1  The wise pivot (Source Accenture, “Make Your Wise Pivot to the New,” June 14, \n2018, https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/insights/consulting/wise-pivot [accessed August \n20, 2019])\n",

Lacy et al.\nhowever, is that all four areas are interdependent and need to be addressed \ntogether, though not necessarily with equal emphasis, to gain the greatest \ntraction for circular economy initiatives. For instance, for companies to be \ncircular, they must tackle both their operations (gain control over and con-\ntain all waste in their system) and their core products and services portfolio \n(stop the continuous flow of more materials that turn into waste and rein-\nvent their portfolios to be indefinitely reused and recycled). And to optimize \nthese initiatives for success, well-functioning cultures and ecosystems are \nessential to embed the right behavior shifts that underly the economics of \ncircular initiatives.\nWhile an “ideal” circular journey might tackle all of these dimensions \nin parallel, most organizations are at different levels of maturity across \nthese four areas. Consider the technology sector. Many companies in the \nhigh-tech industry have been focusing their resources on reducing waste \nin their Operations, especially in energy- and water-intensive data centers. \nAs they gain efficiencies and cut costs in their internal operations, some of \nthese firms have turned their attention to waste in their Product & Service \nportfolios, including some encouraging initiatives focused on design for \ncircularity and product takeback. Other players have been focusing on \nenhancing their Culture & Organization first, as the backbone of their \ntransition, making circularity core to their corporate strategy, mission, \nand ethos. For those companies, the priority has been transitioning the \nworkforce and creating the policies and procedures to support their circu-\nlar objectives. Finally, some organizations want to learn from others and \nsupport broader industry challenges by engaging with the Ecosystem, for \nexample, by joining e-waste consortiums in relevant geographies.\nA Holistic View\nCircular value chains are complex, and the trick is to take a holistic per-\nspective in identifying the right mix of high-value initiatives across the four \ndimensions to maximize return on investment. Generally, although a pleth-\nora of circularity options exists across each of the areas, leaders need to iden-\ntify and prioritize initiatives according to their organization’s needs, growth \nappetite, place in the market, and current maturity. Companies typically do \na broad scan to identify the potential circular economy opportunities across \nthe four dimensions, and then down-select the highest-value opportunities, \ni.e., those that will tackle the biggest areas of waste while maximizing eco-\nnomic returns (as described in Part 2).\n",

We \ntypically suggest companies start broad and brainstorm a long list of ideas—\ndrawing from best practice, leading case studies, internal and external inter-\nviews, etc.—to identify opportunities to build upon current initiatives with \na circular lens and investigate new business models or ventures. The crea-\ntive free flow of ideas is a useful approach to define the “art of the possible” \nfor how circularity can bring additional value to an existing business, and \nhow it can help shift legacy businesses to new ways of working. For exam-\nple, German car manufacturer BMW operates a Co‐Creation Lab, an open \ninnovation platform where the public can share ideas on the future of cars \nand co‐create products and services. Using this approach, BMW can better \nunderstand customers’ requirements, while gaining insight into a range of \npossible concepts at the same time.2\nStep 2—Value analysis: Once a breadth of ideas has been captured, exec-\nutives should perform a funneling exercise to focus on the potential oppor-\ntunities of highest value. As an example, that process might look something \nlike the following:\n1.\tInitial “pass/fail” filters are applied first to weed out the ideas and con-\ncepts that are not viable for the organization, such as not being a fit with \nthe industry, or pose potential legal or safety risks.\n2.\tUsing the shorter list of ideas that made the cut, executives should then \ngo through a qualitative prioritization exercise to identify the high-\nest-value opportunities for the near, medium, and longer term. This \ninvolves defining a set of assessment criteria, typically measuring the \nopportunities against internal metrics, i.e., their ability to achieve busi-\nness goals (e.g., strategic fit with core competencies, ability to create or \nenable value through growth or differentiation, cost reduction, brand \nenhancing, etc.), and the ease of implementation (e.g., technical viability, \nmaturity barriers, stakeholders, cost, and time), as well as external driv-\ners, such as the potential to have an impact on the organization’s broader \necosystem.\n3.\tThe next stage of prioritization should focus on a quantitative assess-\nment to develop a business case for the narrowed list of opportunities, \nlooking across the traditional financial value drivers (e.g., revenue gener-\nation or cost reduction) as well as the environmental and social costs or \nopportunities (e.g., carbon saved or jobs gained/lost), see Fig. 16.3 for an \noverview of the typical value drivers.\n",

Often, companies will \nstart their journey with circular initiatives that have more attractive econom-\nics to help build momentum and fund future higher-risk or slower-return \nprograms. When structuring the roadmap, executives should remember \nthat, in building a true circular strategy, the highest-value initiatives (such as \nunlocking value through service-based models) often rely on initiatives that \nare “enablers.” These might include integrating circular principles in upfront \ndesign, redesigning processes, and setting up ecosystem partnerships. \nTherefore, it’s essential to have a more comprehensive, enterprise-wide view \nwhen setting up circular programs and strategies. “We take a holistic view of \ncircularity, looking at five areas: usage and choice of materials, production \nprocesses, product design, product use, and product end-of-use,” says CEO \nof H&M Group, Karl-Johan Persson. “We are progressing on each of these \nfronts, noting that the areas are in different stages of maturity.”\n  The Maturity Journey\nFor organizations to simplify how they can improve each focus dimension \nand choose the right mix of initiatives for their business, they must under-\nstand their current stage of maturity. Each stage has its own considerations \nand issues, affecting where an organization should focus its efforts, with the \ngoal of becoming a “leading,” or ideally “ultimate” circular company.\n  Emerging  companies are just starting out on their circular journey \nand are likely to have a stronger tie between their growth and use of natural \nresources. These businesses should first conduct a broad assessment of their \ninternal operations and current ways of working to identify quick wins to \nreduce waste and support their shift to circularity. Efforts tend to focus on \ndriving internal efficiencies and improvements (e.g., in areas like reducing \nwaste to landfill) or increasing their use of renewable energy.\n  Established  companies are part-way through their circular journey \nand have realized some substantial wins around operational efficiency and \nwaste, and have likely seen successes within their product portfolio. These \ncompanies should take their learnings and focus on the “hard spots” in their \norganizations to close the loop, pushing the envelope on traditionally chal-\nlenging parts of the business (i.e., by engaging product design, partners, \n",

They dedicate \nmore time and attention to their role in the broader ecosystem, operating \nwith both public and private sectors to transform their environment and \novercome key obstacles for their industries. This includes playing a role in \nshaping and influencing policy agendas, sharing learnings, and working with \npartners, third parties, and competitors.

This \nultimate state goes beyond eliminating waste to completely transforming \nvalue chains so that the company has a net positive environmental impact, \nwith indefinite circulation of resources, materials, products, and services. \nFor example, the ultimate circular company would go beyond carbon neu-\ntrality and zero waste to being additive, regenerative, and restorative.

But that’s only the \nbeginning. Eventually, organizations ambitious about circularity must undertake \na transition to renewable sources of raw materials and energy, while considering \nways to reuse waste within their organizational boundaries or solutions to con-\nvert waste into useful by-products for other businesses and industries.\n  Four Areas of Focus\nOperational initiatives are often more straightforward to pursue as a starting \npoint in comparison with the three other maturity dimensions (Products & \nServices, Culture & Organization, and Ecosystem).

However, even within the same \nindustry, different firms can have widely differing strategies. Much will \ndepend on whether a company is at the start of its circular journey (emerg-\ning), in the middle of it (established) or toward the end (leading to ulti-\nmate)—see Table 17.2 for a view of the full spectrum.\nA Circular Journey: Water\nLet’s take the focus area of water as an example. An emerging circular economy \ncompany (just beginning its efforts toward circularity) might start by conduct-\ning a water risk analysis and then implement initiatives to reduce its water \nconsumption and eliminate contamination, whereas a leading company (more \nadvanced in its circularity journey) might instead be focusing on significant \nwater reuse, or even water restoration/regeneration across its entire value chain.\nCompanies could also consider two types of water initiatives as a starting \npoint, with the goal to reduce or eliminate total water consumption. The \nfirst is to reduce water abstraction, which is the process of taking or extract-\ning water from a natural source (such as a river, lake, or groundwater aqui-\nfer) for irrigation, industrial applications, or other operational uses. In an \ninteresting application, the Changi Airport system collects and treats rainwa-\nter, which accounts for 28–33% of its total water used, resulting in savings \nof approximately $280,000 per annum.8 The second type of initiative is to \nreduce water consumption. In 2015, apparel company Levi Strauss conducted \na comprehensive lifecycle assessment of its core products and found that a \nsingle pair of the popular 501 jeans used 3781 liters of water over its full \ncycle. Levi Strauss then developed a new finishing technique that saves up to \n96% of water in the denim finishing process.9\nUltimately, companies should be making substantial progress across both \nabstraction and consumption, moving toward water positivity (generating \nmore water than consumed), with the goal of replenishing and returning more \nwater to the environment than they use.10 A host of emerging technologies \nwill help companies reach such ambitious targets. One steelmaker in India, \nfor example, leveraged Ecolab’s IoT technology to reuse and recycle water, sav-\ning the equivalent of the annual drinking water needs of Kolkata and Pune \n",

It’s good for business \nand for the planet,” states Doug Baker, Chairman and CEO, Ecolab.\n  Top Tip: Circularity as a Sustainability Accelerator\nAs mentioned earlier, many companies already have sustainability initia-\ntives underway, such as programs for waste and carbon emissions reductions. \nBusinesses can use those efforts as stepping-stones to make the transition \ntoward true circularity. It’s important for executives to understand what the \ncircular economy means for their current sustainability initiatives and goals, \nwhich often include energy, emissions, water, and waste targets and how it is \nadditive. The circular economy brings further advantages in two specific ways. \nFirst, it is focused on driving waste entirely out of a system, not just reducing \nor redirecting it. To accomplish that, companies might need to change funda-\nmental ways in which they operate, for instance, by sourcing only renewable \ninputs or by producing energy through the production process itself. Second, \nthe circular economy is focused on maximizing business impact alongside \nresource impact. Solutions for addressing waste streams should both realize \nenvironmental benefits and contribute positively to the company’s financials, \nsuch as through new revenue streams from the sale of waste by-product as \nfeedstock or through reduced operating costs.\nThe question naturally arises: Should companies manage their sustainability \nand circular efforts separately? The answer is no. Integration is key. From the \nstart, sustainability has been changing the boundaries of corporate strategy \nby becoming a source of innovation and competitive advantage for industry \nleaders.13 And over time, the whole notion of a responsible, trusted organi-\nzation, once seemingly disconnected from the value-generation imperative, \nhas evolved away from “do no harm” toward “doing well by doing good.” \nSustainability strategy is the mechanism to achieve that, playing at both the \noperational and marketplace levels through practices that are both “common” \n(what all peers do) and “strategic” (what competitors cannot easily match). \nJust as the boundaries between industries and sectors blur to give rise to eco-\nsystems enabled by technology advances and free markets, internal organi-\nzational functions become increasingly porous and interlinked with strategy, \nsustainability, and circularity, all nesting within each other. Consequently, \ncertain operations-focused circular practices that target cost efficiencies will \nbe within the purview of operational improvement teams. Other initiatives \nfocused on the adoption of circular business models will likely be spearheaded \nby strategy, R&D, and marketing departments. To balance these different \nefforts well, companies must take a holistic enterprise-wide view, with the \nconnective tissue linking the various initiatives to sustainability objectives and \nthe corporate circular strategy. Without that integration, different parts of the \norganization could not only miss opportunities for synergistic collaboration; \nthey could easily end up working at odds with each other.\n",

Other common objectives include risk mitigation, revenue gen-\neration, and sustainability-related brand enhancement. Let’s explore each of \nthese value drivers in more detail.\n  Revenue Generation:  Some of the most compelling opportunities \nfor operational circularity are in revenue generation, especially for compa-\nnies that have found ways to sell their operational waste streams to other \nindustries as inputs. Consider Metsä Group, a Finnish forest-industry coop-\nerative that manufactures products from renewable wood sources. Metsä \nworks with a network of companies to utilize every production side stream \nat its highest possible value. One tree can be used to produce sawn timber, \nplywood, paperboard, and pulp, as well as in the food industry for concen-\ntrate in juices and ice creams. Currently, 92% of the Metsä Group’s produc-\ntion side streams are directed into reuse as materials (e.g. pulp-based textiles \nor bio-composites) or energy. The cooperative is responsible for 15% of \nFinland’s renewable energy.14\n  Cost Savings:  Working toward operational circularity often brings \ncost savings through increased efficiencies (greater productivity of existing \nassets and equipment), reduced inputs (lower consumption of energy, water, \nand material inputs) and reduced disposal costs. Companies can achieve \nimpressive results even by focusing on just one area. Google and DeepMind \nTechnologies, for example, have been using artificial intelligence (AI) to \nimprove the energy efficiency of data centers. In the system, sensors within \nand outside of a data center track how various environmental factors affect \nits performance, and AI predicts the impact those variables may have on the \nsite’s future energy consumption. When Google deployed the system at a \nlive data center, the company was reportedly able to attain a 40% decrease in \nthe amount of energy needed to cool the facility.15\n  Risk Reduction:  As resources become scarcer (and price fluctuations \nbecome increasingly commonplace), operational circularity has clear risk-re-\nduction benefits. That’s one of the reasons why automotive company Ford \ndeveloped a closed-loop recycling system to reuse aluminum scrap leftover \nfrom the production of the Ford F-150, its best-selling vehicle in the United \n",

The system can recover 20 million pounds of aluminum per month, \nenough for more than 37,000 F-series truck bodies.16 Ford’s closed-loop sys-\ntem helps reduce the company’s dependency on virgin materials and lessens \nits vulnerability to volatile commodity markets. Moreover, reprocessing recy-\ncled aluminum requires 90% less energy and a fraction of the water com-\npared with the mining of new aluminum supplies.17\n  Brand Enhancement:  Finally, an often-overlooked benefit of \nachieving greater circularity in operations is its significant impact on \nbrand building and reputational value. According to a recent global con-\nsumer survey, 81% of respondents across generations and genders believe \nthat companies should help the environment.18 Given such consumer \nsentiment, companies that make bold commitments to circularity can \nbuild their brand value to gain competitive advantage. This is one reason \nwhy many corporations have been very publicly proclaiming such plans. \nConsumer brand Colgate, for instance, launched a social media campaign \n(#EveryDropCounts) that included a 30-second video clip showing that \nalmost four gallons of water get wasted when people keep the faucet run-\nning while brushing.19 The ad campaign went viral, garnering more than \n10 million views on YouTube.20\n  Case Study: Anheuser-Busch InBev\nAnheuser-Busch InBev is an example of a company that is progressing along \na maturity journey in operational circularity. Initially, the multinational bever-\nage company focused on cost savings through reductions in energy and water \nusage. Specifically, from 2013 to 2017, AB InBev saved $60 million through effi-\nciency improvements, largely attributed to on-site water efficiency and risk \nmanagement as well as energy-efficient LED lighting and energy-saving con-\ntrollers.21 Next, the company shifted toward sourcing all purchased electricity \nfrom renewable sources by 2025, which would be the equivalent of removing \n500,000 cars from the road. To date, AB InBev has contracted 50% of its renew-\nable electricity needs, including 100% contracts that will provide renewable \nelectricity for 100% of operations in North America.22 And now, AB InBev is \nnot only approaching “grid independent” for brewing beer; the company is, \nlike other circular leaders, also beginning to generate additional revenues by \nselling excess energy back to the grid. Moreover, AB InBev has also begun to \nlink these initiatives to its products and brand. By 2025, all of the company’s \nBudweiser beer around the world will be brewed using 100% renewable elec-\ntricity sources, and these products will have a symbol that will enable consum-\ners to make better-informed purchasing decisions.23\n",

Technology is a powerful enabler of operational efficiencies, especially \nin continuously monitoring and improving daily operations to cut resource \nconsumption. Digital technologies are a case in point. Thanks to the IoT \nand other digital innovations, Enevo, a US waste management company, \nhas been able to optimize waste pickup and provide “waste technology as \na service.” The company measures its customers’ energy, water, and waste \nindicators and then feeds the data into machine-learning models to iden-\ntify solutions for decreasing costs and increasing sustainability over time.24 \nIn a similar application, SKF, a Swedish bearing and seal manufacturer, has \noptimized the maintenance of industrial machinery by analyzing IoT data \non the equipment’s operating conditions to better predict when failures \nmight occur or replacements are needed, reducing equipment downtime.25 \nMachine learning can also detect previously unnoticed patterns throughout \nthe supply chain in order to predict demand with better accuracy.\nAn array of biological and physical technologies—including bio-en-\nergy, materials science, 3D printing, and hydroponics—can also help \ncompanies use fewer resources, swap in alternative renewable inputs, and \nenhance productivity, in essence, to do more or better with less. DyeCoo, \na textile company, is a good example of that. DyeCoo’s technology elimi-\nnates water and chemicals completely from the fabric dyeing process and \ninstead uses supercritical carbon dioxide to dye fabrics at the same quality \nor better. Just one DyeCoo dyeing machine can help save 32 million lit-\ners of water and 160,000 kilograms of processing chemicals per year. The \ntechnology is extremely efficient and fully circular: The carbon dioxide is a \nby-product of other industrial processes and is recycled for use in the next \nbatch.26\nIn other applications, technology is playing a critical role in energy \nharvesting and in capturing and reprocessing waste for alternative uses. \nCarbon Engineering, a Canadian clean energy company, has developed \ndirect air capture (DAC) technology that converts atmospheric carbon \ndioxide into low-carbon fuels for transport and for use in enhanced oil \nrecovery. According to the company, the technology can scale up to capture \none million tons of carbon dioxide per year with each commercial facil-\nity. That quantity is equivalent to the annual emissions of 250,000 average \ncars.27\n",

Lacy et al.\nLeading Practices to Drive Transformation\nWhat accounts for the success of companies like Levi Strauss, Ford, and \nAB InBev in driving the circular economy in their organizations? In our \nresearch, we uncovered several common leading practices.\nMove Forward with Renewables at Scale\n“Going big” on renewable energy emerged as a common theme. \nMultinational technology company Microsoft has succeeded in re-prioritizing \nenergy as a C-suite issue and has improved its energy efficiency, while \nincreasing the proportion of renewables in its overall energy mix. In 2011, \ncompany leaders commissioned an evaluation into risk exposure regarding \nMicrosoft’s current energy position. The report concluded that the firm \nfaced significant risk from carbon regulations, pricing, and availability. To \nmitigate this risk, Microsoft compiled a team of 14 experts in renewable \nenergy, electricity markets, battery storage, and local energy generation (or \n“distributed energy”) to develop and execute a central energy strategy for the \nfirm.28 Microsoft’s CFO and President played a strong role in devising this \ncomprehensive roadmap. The company then set ambitious targets to source \n50% of energy for its data centers from wind, solar, and hydroelectric power \nby 2018. By the early 2020s, Microsoft seeks to increase this to 60%.28 To \nmeet those targets, business units are charged internally for carbon emis-\nsions, with funds reinvested into renewable energy programs.28\nMeasure Resource Inputs and Outputs to Incentivize \nChange\nMany companies measure their energy consumption. To attain operational \ncircularity, however, they must also quantify their usage of water and other \nresources, and they need a data-generated view of the waste streams they \nproduce. Only with such detailed information can organizations properly \nmanage and control those quantities in the most efficient ways, and they \ncan also begin to implement programs to incentivize change. “Zero-waste” \ninitiatives are a good place to start. The platinum division of mining com-\npany Anglo American is on track to meet its goal of sending zero waste to \nlandfill by 2020, thanks to a partnership with waste specialists to analyze \nwaste streams at each site and explore opportunities to develop cost-effective \nreuse and recycling business ventures with community members.29 Internal \n",

Mahindra & Mahindra, an Indian automotive and farm equipment \ncompany, set an internal carbon price of $10 per ton that was so effective \nthat the firm plans to extend the pricing to its other businesses along its sup-\nply chain.30\nEmbed Circularity into Closed-Loop Operational Systems\nA circular pivot must be led from the top of the organization, but, critically, \nit also needs to be embedded into the everyday operational decision-making \nlevel, moving beyond the borders of the facilities to include new partners \nand systems. When global brewer Heineken was planning a new brewery \nin Mexico, the company designed the facility for circularity throughout its \noperations.31 At the site, half of the thermal energy required for brewing will \nbe obtained by recovering waste heat from an adjacent glass factory (which \nin turn will use in its products the residual glass it receives from Heineken). \nAs the new plant runs, it will produce biogas that will be used for heat in \nthe brewing process. In addition, a water-treatment plant will purify the \nwater used in production so that 30% of it can be reused in other pro-\ncesses; by-product sludge will be used by nearby farms to improve the soil; \nand spent grains (also a by-product of beer production) will be used as cattle \nfeed. Lastly, on-site solar panels will provide some of the brewery’s electricity, \nwith the rest powered by off-site wind and solar power.\nThink “Outside the Box” to Maximize Value\nOperational leaders in the circular economy shared another commonality: \n“outside the box” thinking to create additional value from circular initiatives \nwhich can provide commercial opportunities for the business, but also ben-\nefit consumers and communities. Many of these new business models have \ningeniously turned spare capacity into revenue streams. Coyote, a third-\nparty logistics provider acquired by UPS, is helping to fill the spare capacity \nof empty trucks that are making a return trip. Coyote matches those vehi-\ncles with businesses that need their freight transported, thus reducing empty \nreturn-truck miles, also known as “deadheading” in the industry.32 Using \nCoyote’s service, one large US brewing company was able to fill 900,000 \nempty miles of its fleet of trucks in 2018 alone, generating considerable \nadditional revenues.33\n",

Thanks to \nan alliance with conservationists, rice farmers in California, a water-stressed \nregion, have been renting their fallow fields as “pop-up wetlands.” Over the \nyears, agricultural expansion in California has replaced 90% of wetlands, \nresulting in a drastic plunge in the numbers of annual visits by waterfowl \nand shorebirds.34 In response, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a charitable \nenvironmental organization, used a massive database of crowdsourced infor-\nmation from amateur birdwatchers to predict when and where birds would \nneed a habitat area in California. TNC then contracted with farmers to tem-\nporarily rent their fallow agricultural fields in those areas (shorebirds need \nland only for a few weeks a year).34 The results have been impressive: a five-\nfold increase in the number of shorebirds over February into March, with \nthe rented fields averaging 20 times the shorebird density compared with \ncontrol fields.34\nAnother example is method’s factory in Chicago, which fuses circular \neconomy principles with an urban development perspective to maximize \nbenefits to business, society, and the environment. Method established the \nfactory on the south side of Chicago, the first new facility in over 30 years \nin an area that’s experienced major disinvestment. “We decided to invest and \ndevelop an area where infrastructure is dated and people need jobs,” explains \nAdam Lowry, Co-Founder of method. “With more urbanization, it is also \nbetter from an energy and water standpoint to invest in a city.” The factory \ngenerates renewable energy on-site and is water neutral. The company also \ninvested $1 million to reinforce the factory’s roof. This investment is gener-\nating additional revenue and providing fresh produce to the area through a \nrental agreement with urban farm, Gotham Greens.\n  Chapter Takeaways\n•\t Operations can be a good place to start circular economy efforts, given the \norganizational control, opportunities to build on existing sustainability initi-\natives, and relatively quick returns and cost savings.\n•\t Companies should use circularity as a way to boost or build upon existing \nsustainability efforts to address the biggest areas of waste across energy, \nemissions, water, and material inputs in their operations.\n•\t The value of circular operations is not limited to cost reduction. Companies \nmust get creative in thinking about new ways to eliminate and mone-\ntize waste, such as through selling waste streams to parallel industries or \nthrough renting out their excess production, storage, or logistics capacity \nvia supply-chain-as-a-service models.\n",

It’s how they \nare best known by consumers, employees, and investors; it’s often how busi-\nnesses are organized internally; and it’s how corporate performance is usually \nmeasured. As a result, transforming those offerings, especially legacy prod-\nucts, to incorporate circularity can be quite complex.\nWhat does it actually mean to bring circularity into an organization’s \nportfolio of offerings? It requires companies to design and develop products \nand services with no waste. Ideally, a circular product would be (1) designed \nfor indefinite reuse, (2) created only with circular or sustainable materials, \n(3) kept in useful life for as long as possible, and (4) able to be disassem-\nbled into materials or components that could be brought back into a value \nchain (either its own or another’s) at the end of use at the highest possible \nvalue (e.g., returned to feedstock instead of used for energy). Simply put, in \ntrue circularity, products and materials are indefinitely used and recirculated \nin a closed-loop system. While simple in concept, though, accomplishing \ntrue circularity is an enormous undertaking, requiring a complete shift away \nfrom the current linear consumption model.\n  Four Areas of Focus\nTaking the steps to create circular products and services can, at first, seem \nlike an overwhelming task. But we can break the process down into more \nmanageable pieces by considering the four key stages of a product’s lifecycle: \ndesign, use, use extension, and end of use (see Table 18.1).\n18\n  Products & Services\n© The Author(s) 2020 \nP.

Further, increasing the recoverability of end of \nuse might be achieved through a Product as a Service business model that \nwill affect the use and ownership of those products.\nThinking holistically across these four stages will enable companies to \nmove beyond “products with circular attributes” to truly “circular products” \nand that transformation will involve either an open- or closed-loop system \n(see “Open Versus Closed Loop”). In addition, leaders need to think about \ntheir products relative to the other three circular dimensions (Operations, \nCulture & Organization, and Ecosystem) that are described in this book. \nFor example, once companies have tackled operations, they tend to shift \ntheir focus toward their product portfolios. But products and services could \nalso be a starting point for multi-category and consumer-facing firms, \nsuch as general retailers, that are looking to engage consumers and test the \ndemand for and business value of circular concepts.\n  Open Versus Closed Loops\nCircular pathways for products and materials can either be “closed loop” (in \nwhich the waste from one product is collected and recycled into the same new \nproduct, e.g., aluminum cans that are recycled directly back into new cans, \nover and over again) or “open loop” (in which one industry’s waste becomes \nthe raw input to another, e.g., US coffee company Starbucks’ spent coffee \nbeing used as fertilizer).5 We are often asked whether closed-loop applications \nare inherently better than open-loop ones. The answer is, it depends.\nClosed-loop applications are perceived as inherently better than open-loop \nones. If materials or components are indefinitely brought back into a value \nchain, then it should reduce product costs, reduce or eliminate non-renewable \nresource use, and protect against potential supply shortages. However, with \na closed loop, companies might be more limited with respect to the products, \nparts, or materials that can actually be fed back into the same product. Bringing \nproducts and materials back into systems at scale requires the right econom-\nics, collection infrastructure, consumer incentives, and technical capability. As \nwe saw in the industry profiles, most industries are still working to overcome \nthese barriers, and as a result, there are few examples of closed-loop products \nor materials today. For instance, not one product currently meets the Cradle to \nCradle™ Platinum certification requirement—a system that evaluates products \nacross five quality categories (material health, materials reutilization, renewable \nenergy and carbon management, water stewardship, and social fairness).6\nWith an open loop, companies might be able to find feasible applications of \ntheir “waste,” as it becomes a valuable feedstock for another system. However, \nthe downside is that most open-loop applications today involve downgrading \n",

That said, we believe that open-loop applications could be \n“as good” and potentially even more impactful than closed-loop applications, \nbut the entire system has to be made “closed.” This would require suppliers of \ncircular inputs as well as customers to have circular ecosystems also designed to \ncollect and reuse products in a circular way. In this respect, creating an effective \nopen-loop ecosystem is much more complex, but can be more rewarding in its \nspillover impact to other companies and industries.\nConsider waste-to-resource company Continuus Materials, for example, \nwhich has developed a proprietary system to process municipal and post-in-\ndustrial waste streams into a fully recyclable product. EVERBOARD™ is an \nextremely durable, moisture, and mold-resistant building panel that is superior \nin performance compared to conventional building materials, yet is priced at \nparity. By utilizing end-of-use materials and producing the upcycled board in \nthe same location, the company created a truly circular ecosystem that con-\nverts locally collected waste into locally distributed, high-performance build-\ning materials. Continuus Materials’ CEO, Chris Riley, speaks to the potential for \necosystem-level impact: “Our solutions bring together two of the largest mate-\nrial industries out there, waste and building materials. The building materials \nindustry is one of the few that has the capacity to absorb a significant portion \nof the waste being generated” (Fig. 18.1).\nFig. 18.1  An illustrative closed-loop product\n",

Numerous factors must be considered, including \nmarket trends, customer readiness, and broader strategic priorities. A com-\npany facing increased competition and heightened consumer scrutiny, for \nexample, may choose to prioritize initiatives that will enhance the value \nproposition for customer acquisition and retention, such as through circu-\nlar products or models that link to loyalty programs. Take, for example, the \nheightened public focus on single-use plastics. Companies in the FMCG, \nretail, or food services industries may put at the top of the list initiatives \nwith the greatest exposure to a downstream consumer audience, such as piv-\noting to plastics-free or circular packaging. To that end, German chemical \nand consumer goods company Henkel is aiming for 100% of its packaging \nto be recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025.7 On the other hand, a \nfirm that is focused on cost reduction may prioritize circular initiatives that \nreduce the costs of goods sold, such as through minimizing the amount of \nmaterial in a product.\nTwo other crucial factors are the available technologies and infrastructure \nmaturity essential to circularity, and both affect the phasing of near-term ini-\ntiatives versus longer-term, strategic investments. Some opportunities, such \nas substituting a recycled or alternative input into a product, may be rela-\ntively easy to scale across the existing value chain. Contrast that with larger \ntransitions to entirely new business models and product portfolios. Those \napproaches may demand substantial investments in technology and infra-\nstructure, but they can also open doors to considerable future growth. Essity, \na global hygiene and health company that is one of the world’s largest tis-\nsue manufacturers, is investing approximately $40 million in the technology \nto produce pulp from alternative fiber that comes from plant-based agri-\ncultural by-products instead of conventional wood-based pulp. The process \nwill enable a reduction in the use of water, energy, and chemicals, while the \nby-product of the integrated pulping process can be further refined to serve \nas a substitute for oil-based chemicals.8\nThe scale and size of an organization will further affect how it can (and \nshould) roll out circular initiatives. A large organization may choose to start \nwith a particular region, product line, or brand to pilot initiatives, targeting \nsegments that are most likely to value circular models. For example, auto-\nmakers have typically focused on the appeal of their EV models to already \n",

But organizations shouldn’t stop there. \nOnce they have successfully “proven” their circular products and services, \nthey can then focus on value chain efficiencies to enable broader portfolio \ntransition.\nA Circular Journey: Use Extension\nIn general, companies tend to advance through several steps of maturity \nwhen building circular portfolios: first taking stock of their existing prod-\nucts and services (see “Taking Stock”), then identifying and piloting oppor-\ntunities, and eventually transforming the entire business and portfolio \nto be circular. The journey may involve a dramatic change in how a com-\npany operates. “We are transforming our business model, for example in \nswitching technology, from ‘we sell you a box, then we come back in three \nyears and try to sell you an upgrade’ to ‘we sell you technology in a sub-\nscription model and enable you to maximize the value to your business’. In \nthis model, the physical product will have a significantly longer lifecycle,” \nexplains John Kern, Senior Vice President of Supply Chain Operations at \nCisco.\nProducts & Services initiatives get to the heart of circularity, cutting \nacross the value chain—from rethinking design and material development, \nto reuse, and finally to recycling back into the system at end of use (see \nTable 18.2). And they also depend on whether a company is beginning its \njourney or is well along the path toward circularity. As just one example, \nconsider the focus area of use extension, which has two major types of ini-\ntiatives that companies can pursue. The first is to extend product use through \nrepair or maintenance activities. This can be accomplished by raising aware-\nness and by providing product support services that will increase customer \nvalue and loyalty, improve the brand, and generate additional sources of \nrevenue. Patagonia, for instance, through its “anti-growth” approach and \nefforts like the “Don’t Buy This Jacket” campaign, informs consumers on the \neffects of their purchases. The US clothing company designs products specif-\nically using high-quality materials, which in turn enable effective repair and \nreuse. And this ultimately has helped Patagonia gain deeper knowledge of its \ncustomer needs. “Our focus on repairability has helped us understand the \nhidden challenges in fixing an issue, which we have shared with the design \nteam to ensure new garments are designed with repairability in mind, hence \nclosing the feedback loop,” says Rick Ridgeway, Patagonia’s VP of Public \nEngagement.\n",

An example would be equipment manufacturer \nKomatsu’s program for retrofitting and reselling used mining and construc-\ntion machinery (see Chapter 9 for more detail).9 In another example, JCB \nIndia Ltd., a manufacturer and supplier of heavy construction machines, \nextends product uses through its “Recon Care” engine recovery and recy-\ncling program.10\nUsing either approach, the goal is to ultimately extend use across all prod-\nucts and services. In doing so, companies need to facilitate the extended use \nof products and collection for reselling via technology enablement, collec-\ntion programs, and resale platforms.\n  Top Tip: Taking Stock\nTo better manage the circular transformation of a product portfolio, most \ncompanies start off with a prioritization exercise that zeroes in on the offer-\nings and business models to focus on first. This process could be embedded \nwithin the broader circular opportunity assessment and strategy (discussed in \nPart III, “How to Make a Circular Pivot”), or it could be conducted as a separate \nanalysis that specifically looks closely at Products & Services. The exercise may \ncontain the following four basic steps:\n1. Conduct a product inventory: Assess your current portfolio and truly under-\nstand all of the materials being used in its creation and service, including \nwater, energy, feedstock, etc. The goal is to identify where there are areas \nof greatest resource intensity and waste leakage and to be aware of the \nlifecycles of the materials used. A baseline analysis can help determine \nwhere your biggest needs and opportunities are—for example, products \nthat have significant water footprints, that rely on single-use plastics, that \nare highly underutilized, that tend to be discarded prematurely, or that \nhave valuable materials that have ended up in a landfill. The analysis can \nlead to the redesign, re-formulation, or discarding of a product altogether. \nWhen Unilever conducted a full portfolio assessment in 2017, the company \nfound that its “Sustainable Living Brands” grew 50% faster than the rest of \nthe business and that some of its least sustainable products were actually \nperforming the worst financially. Insights like these drive portfolio growth \nand rationalization decisions, not only identifying items to discontinue but \nalso uncovering opportunities to double down on products and processes \nthat may unknowingly already be sustainable. Just a year later, Unilever’s \nSustainable Living Brands were delivering 75% of the company’s growth.11\n2. Map products and models to circular opportunities: Once the initial inven-\ntory is completed, you can then begin identifying and mapping circular \nmaterials, business models, and services against the current portfolio. IKEA, \nfor instance, took products like a sofa as a starting point, identified wasted \n",

EkoPlaza, a Dutch super-\nmarket chain, has been able to use alternative biodegradable packaging to \nhelp eliminate the use of plastics in more than 700 items, including yogurts, \nsnacks, fresh fruit, and vegetables.12 Other products might be better suited \nfor service models. Case in point: automobiles, which have a long useful life \nbut low utilization rate.\n3. Assess and prioritize opportunities: After the portfolio mapping has been \ncompleted, you should assess your opportunities against a set of criteria. \nThese will typically be some mix of strategic, organizational, and market \nfactors, such as:\n•\t Urgency—How important is it to change the consumption model for this \nproduct and what are the impacts of its material and/or resource inputs?\n•\t Strategic fit—Does the opportunity align with your strategic direction \nand competitive differentiators?\n•\t Capability fit—Do you have the required skills, systems, and processes \nnecessary to pursue the opportunity?\n•\t Technical feasibility—Do the technologies and infrastructure exist that \nwill enable you to pursue the opportunity at scale and cost-effectively?\n•\t Customer demand—Do customers’ value owning the product or do they \nvalue the utility of the product?\nSome opportunities might be prioritized as quick wins if they are technically \nfeasible and on trend with customer preferences and interests (e.g., subscrip-\ntion services for fashion). Other opportunities might currently be less feasible \nbut could warrant strategic long-term investments in new supply chains and \necosystems (e.g., the mining of returned appliances and electronics).\n4. Develop the business case: You now need to develop a viable business \ncase, which should include specifics of the customer value proposition and \ntargeted customer segments. You should develop your concept for the \nnew product, service, or business model in detail in order to calculate the \ninvestment needs (e.g., for people, R&D, etc.), operational costs (added \ncosts or savings), and expected revenues (e.g., from recurring service rev-\nenue, resale, or premium potential). A valuation of the circular initiatives \nwill inform their sequencing and prioritization and enable the tracking of \nfinancial, social, and environmental benefits (e.g., landfill diversion, emis-\nsions reduction, or job creation). Ecolab, which provides water, hygiene and \nenergy solutions to the food, energy, healthcare, industrial and hospitality \nmarkets, has worked with paper clients to reuse recycled fiber without com-\npromising strength and quality for the papermaker. Ecolab Chairman and \nCEO Doug Baker speaks to financial return as a driver: “The best results \nhave the lowest total operating costs, and must have high returns for the \nbusiness as well as the environment.”\n",

Lacy et al.\nThe Value Drivers\nTransforming your product and service portfolio to circularity is crucial \nto remain competitive in a consumer-conscious and resource-constrained \nworld. As we discussed in the previous chapter, circularity will help a busi-\nness effectively manage and utilize the materials and resources it needs \nwithin its operations. But circular products and services go one step further: \nBuilding a circular portfolio will ultimately reduce a company’s exposure to \nrisk and drive long-term growth and profitability. Simply put, circular prod-\nucts and services allow nearly limitless consumption, as growth is no longer \nconstrained by resource availability or environmental impact.\n  Revenue Generation:  Shifting to circular products and services can \noffer tremendous opportunities for revenue growth. For instance, the Dutch \nmultinational Philips has been able to create value from moving toward a \ncircular portfolio for revenue growth. In 2018, green and circular revenues \namounted to 64 and 12% of the company’s sales, respectively.13 Philips’ ini-\ntiatives included the following: SmartPath, an economical way to upgrade \nexisting Philips systems to current standards while enhancing capacities; \nthe Diamond Select portfolio of refurbished healthcare systems, which pro-\nvides customers with state-of-the-art technology at more affordable prices; \nand Lumify, a flexible subscription service that provides access to ultrasound \ntransducers, apps, and an online ecosystem, all at reduced upfront costs to \ncustomers. Philips believes a shift to circular business models has the poten-\ntial to generate significant value, both for customers and for the company \nitself. Long-term partnership with customers creates win-win situations in \nwhich the customers get better service and outcomes, while the company \nhas a longer-lasting and thus more predictable revenue stream.\n  Cost Savings:  Circularity can also drive waste out of the product \ndesign and production stages to make leaner products, reducing raw material \ncosts. And some companies have obtained additional savings by using their \nown recycled materials as raw input. Over half of the recycled plastic that Dell \nis using in its products is coming from the company’s own closed-loop sup-\nply chain, which amounts to 13.7 million pounds of recycled plastics. John \nPflueger, Principal Environmental Strategist at Dell, explains: “We decided to \nclose the loop on plastics versus selling it back to the market and that resulted \nin $2 million in cost savings so far. It also boosted our brand recognition, \n",

Under Waste \nElectrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations in the UK, retail-\ners must now provide a free method for customers to dispose of their old \nhousehold electronic equipment whenever they sell a new version of that \nproduct. If a company doesn’t have its own takeback service, it must join the \nDistributor Takeback Scheme.14 And it’s not just electronics products that \nare being regulated. EPR policies, which we’ll explore more in the “Role of \nPolicymakers” section, are also being introduced for lower-value items like \nplastic bottles, potentially holding manufacturers responsible for preventing \nplastic waste from entering landfills and the natural environment. Industries \nacross the board are feeling the pressure toward circularity. For instance, \nthe EU has banned more than 1300 chemicals from cosmetic products that \nare known or suspected to be hazardous to health.15 In addition, the EU \nCosmetics Directive requires the pre-market safety assessments of cosmetics, \nmandatory registration of cosmetic products, and government authoriza-\ntion for the use of nanomaterials. It has also prohibited animal testing for \ncosmetic purposes.15 We expect these types of regulations to become more \nwidespread in the future, given recent trends.\nAnother huge concern is the availability of resources. As discussed in \nChapter 1, we are already using more resources than the earth is able to \nregenerate. Because circularity can potentially help a company establish an \nindefinite supply of raw inputs, it can safeguard against the risk of a resource \n“running out” and protect against commodity price volatility (most com-\nmodity prices spiked in the first quarter of 2019).\n  Brand Enhancement:  Circularity will also protect against market \nloss as consumers continue to care more about the environment and change \ntheir purchasing behaviors accordingly. Across the board, we are seeing an \nincreased customer preference not only for greater sustainability, but also \nfor circular products and materials, which will drive brand value and pro-\ntect market share. In fact, a recent Accenture survey indicated that 75% of \nconsumers want to buy more environmentally friendly products.16 And the \nsame survey found that 83% believe it’s important or extremely important \nfor companies to design products that are meant to be reused or recycled.12\n",

Lacy et al.\n  Case Study: IKEA\nIKEA is trialling strategies to fundamentally transition its model to be more \ncircular and shift the consumption model for how consumers buy and use fur-\nniture. IKEA has progressed from designing for recyclability to enabling a cir-\ncular flow of materials to fostering a culture of recycling among its customers. \nThroughout this ongoing journey, the company has evolved from an emerging \ncircular company to a leading organization. Early on that journey, IKEA devel-\noped an approach for identifying and prioritizing materials that were of the \nmost value for recycling from an environmental perspective and that effort \nresulted in the selection of a total of over 25 materials as suitable for circular \nresource chains.17\nNext, the company incentivized customers to return old IKEA furniture and \ntextiles via reward mechanisms and set up the collection infrastructure to ena-\nble the reverse flow of its products. For instance, customers can email pho-\ntos of their old IKEA furniture so that it can be assessed for recyclability. They \ncan then drop off their used or broken damaged IKEA furniture at the store \nand receive a voucher for the value of the old furniture in return. IKEA then \nre-sells these used products at a fraction of the original price. In 2018, dedi-\ncated “Recovery” teams at IKEA franchisee Ingka Group repaired and repacked \n8.7 million damaged products to be re-sold instead of going to waste.18 Given \nIKEA’s scale, if concepts such as these are extended across the business, they \ncould have an enormous impact via reducing end-of-use waste.\nMore recently, IKEA announced it will begin leasing furniture-as-a-service, \nrepresenting a significant shift from the traditional model, which could pro-\nlong the product lifespan. This year, the company also launched a new circu-\nlar store, which includes learning dedicated space for customers to learn about \nproduct use extension, upcycling and reducing waste. Through such efforts, \nIKEA is bringing customers on their journey to becoming a circular and climate \npositive business.\n  Technology as an Enabler\nTechnological innovations have been a linchpin in the circular economy, \nand perhaps nowhere is that more evident than in the products and services \nthey’ve enabled. The examples are as varied as they are numerous.\nIn the design stage, circular inputs are made possible by breakthroughs \nin physical and biological technologies, such as via material innovation \n(e.g., plant-based coatings that extend product use or bio-based materials \nthat are compostable at end-of-life) and process innovation (e.g., 3D print-\ning technologies that can create modular products, use fewer materials, and \nresult in less waste, or biological technologies that enable waterless dying). \nTarkett, a flooring solutions company, for instance, has developed a modu-\nlar carpet tile that uses recycled material from waste windshields and safety \nglass.19 Advances in materials science have also opened up new possibilities \n",

Henkel is working with its supplier Ampacet \nCorporation to develop an innovative solution for black plastic packaging \nthat is fully recyclable. While black plastic has long been unrecyclable (due \nto the carbon black pigment), the new packaging material will use an alter-\nnative carbon-free black color, enabling used bottles to be integrated back \ninto the value chain.20\nIoT, advanced analytics, and various other digital technologies can also \nhelp companies optimize product lifetime performance, reduce negative \nenvironmental externalities, and enable new business models for product use \nextension. For example, digital direct-to-consumer technologies are extend-\ning the life of products by enabling rental models, sharing platforms, and \nmarketplaces. For example, Stuffstr offers a platform for people to instantly \nsell back any item purchased from participating retailers. Using the retailer’s \napp or website, the customer is presented with an instant buy-back price on \nevery item and can sell items back simply by tapping a button. When the \ncustomer is ready, Stuffstr provides free, same-day pickup and pays the cus-\ntomer using store credit the moment the items are received. An important \nelement of the model is Stuffstr’s algorithm for calculating the offer prices, \nwhich uses artificial intelligence to project the items’ resale value and then \nestimates the costs of collecting and processing the items.21\nTo further capture product end-of-use opportunities, companies have \nembraced a host of digital, physical, and biological technologies. For exam-\nple, robotics can automate the sorting and disassembly of products, while \nadvanced analytics and backbone data engines can help track and optimize \nthe valuation and direction of reverse product and material flows. IoT can \nalso be deployed to increase product recovery and recycling. Information \ncompany Hewlett-Packard Inc. (HP), for example, has deployed a Product \nas a Service business model with connected printers that automatically \nrequests replacement ink cartridges before customers need them. The used \ncartridges are then mailed to HP for refilling as part of a closed-loop system \nof recycling, and the subscription service charges a monthly fee for perfor-\nmance (number of pages printed) rather than for the amount of ink used.22\nLeading Practices to Drive Transformation\nIn our research, we encountered a number of companies that have made sig-\nnificant progress in their journey toward creating and growing circular prod-\nuct portfolios. We collated our learnings from those leading firms to glean \ninsights into how they achieved their success.\n",

Supplier engagement is a key starting point, \nand leading companies tend to collaborate closely with their suppliers \nto develop and source ideas that will enable the reengineering of circular \nproducts.\nIt’s not just an issue of selecting the right partners. It’s also a matter of \nestablishing the right dependencies and enabling more open communica-\ntion among them. As John Kern from Cisco explains, “We need to have \nenough suppliers that can reprocess and find renewable inputs. Industry \nmarketplaces can be game-changing for taking one industry’s waste and \nputting it into another’s material flow.” A case in point is GemChina, \nwhich focuses on the large amounts of battery and e-waste being cre-\nated by the electronics and electric vehicle (EV) markets. The company’s \ntechnology enables the recycling of scrapped lithium batteries from EVs, \nextracting the nickel, cobalt, and other important resources, transform-\ning them into materials that can then be fed back into the supply chains \nof battery producers like Samsung SDI and Ecopro Co Ltd.23 To date, \nGemChina has the highest used-battery recycling capacity in China, pro-\ncessing more than 10% of the total waste battery, or about 300,000 tons, \nper year.24\nEstablishing a new supply chain is one thing; getting it to scale is more \ndaunting. The use of a shared infrastructure can help. Loop, a new zero-\nwaste platform for consumer products launched by TerraCycle, enables cir-\ncular flows between brands and consumers. The recently launched initiative \nalready offers about 300 items—from Tide detergent to Pantene shampoo \nand Häagen-Dazs ice cream to Crest mouthwash—all in reusable pack-\naging. After using the products, customers put the empty containers in a \nLoop tote on their doorstep. The tote is then picked up by a delivery ser-\nvice and sent back to Loop where the containers are cleaned, sent to the \nmanufacturer to be refilled, and shipped out to consumers again. “Loop \nechoes the convenience of disposability while solving for the negatives: \nwaste disposal and degrading packaging quality,” says Tom Szaky, CEO of \nTerraCycle. Loop is providing the infrastructure to enable the ambitions \nof major brands, such as Unilever. “We believe Loop will complement our \nexisting efforts to create a plastic system that works and a packaging sys-\ntem that is truly circular by design,” says David Blanchard, Unilever’s Chief \nR&D Officer.25\n",

Even the mere presence of the targets will help signal positive change \nto employees, suppliers, and the market. Establishing targets for circular \nportfolios and materials can take a number of different forms. Some goals, \nfor example, may pertain to the use of circular materials. H&M Group set \nthe target to use 100% recycled or other sustainably sourced materials for \nall its products by 2030, as part of its mission to become a fully circular \nand climate positive business.26 Other goals are specific to a firm’s product \nportfolio. As part of its commitments to reach zero waste in operations and \nuse sustainable materials in core products and packaging by 2030, Danish \ntoymaker Lego is focusing on developing fully bio-based materials. Another \napproach is to set goals for revenue growth through circular products and \nportfolios. Veolia has a 2020 target to generate more than €3.8 billion in \nrevenue in the circular economy.27 A number of companies have gone a step \nfurther by setting goals at the product level. According to James Quincey, \nChairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, “It goes up and down the \nchain. When we set targets, we don’t set them just for the company, we set \nthem for the products that are an ecosystem of many companies.”\nWhile setting any type of product target, companies should consider the \nfollowing: (a) potential barriers and requirements to achieving those goals, \ne.g., the required collection infrastructure or recycling technologies, and (b) \npotential unintended consequences and considerations of solution-specific \ngoals. For instance, if a company intends to double down on the use of bio-\nplastics, it needs to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure and processes \nare in place to avoid contamination of recycling streams.\nFocus on Customer Centricity\nLeading circular companies are adept at engaging the consumer in the circu-\nlar experience and value proposition. The public has a heightened sensitiv-\nity toward sustainability, climate change, and general social awareness that \nprovides brands with an opportunity to differentiate on environmental and \nsocial performance. However, that may not always be the case, as customers \nare not yet broadly basing purchasing decisions on circular economy ideals, \nso it is important to shape circular propositions that appeal to conventional \n",

For instance, US women’s clothing retailer Ascena Retail \nGroup has partnered with Give Back Box to allow customers to print a free \nshipping label from its website to donate clothing and accessories. As of \n2017, customers and associates have donated more than 6000 boxes to char-\nities such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army.28\nDesign Innovatively\nLeading companies agree that one of the most important—and challeng-\ning—tasks is to integrate circular economy principles into portfolio plan-\nning and design from the outset. Indeed, from material and ingredient \nchoice to design specifications that extend product use and enhance recov-\nerability, circular thinking must be incorporated way upstream to achieve \nthe best outcomes. International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF), for example, \nhas been innovating to build a circular fragrance in accordance withCradle \nto Cradle™ certification criteria (which can be a useful framework to struc-\nture design principles and aspire toward external certification). These criteria \napply to fragrance properties (e.g., no eco-toxins), manufacturing processes \n(e.g., the use of renewable feedstock), and design for end of use (e.g., biode-\ngradable). To develop a circular fragrance, IFF went through its entire cat-\nalog of ingredients and screened them against the criteria to facilitate the \ndesign process.29\nOftentimes, small- and medium-size firms that have incorporated circu-\nlarity as part of their core ethos are better positioned for circular innova-\ntion. Ripple Foods, for instance, has innovated a portfolio of nondairy milk \n",

According to founder and CEO, Adam Lowry, Ripple’s goal from the \nstart was to “design a non-dairy product with the best environmental and \nnutritional benefit.” While many nut-based milk substitutes require large \namounts of imported water and come in formats that lack protein, at its \noutset Ripple sought to solve the question: How do you create a nutritious \nproduct with a better environmental impact? They chose legumes since they \ndon’t require any nitrogen fertilizer (they are actually nitrogen fixers), and \nthey are rotational crops (they grow where it rains). To top it off, the Ripple \nproduct has eight times the protein of almond milk.\nAnother example is feminine hygiene disruptor THINX, which has cre-\nated “period-proof,” absorbent and washable underwear and reusable tam-\npons. By innovating the functionality of the product itself, THINX offers \na solution that could virtually eliminate the need for single-use sanitary \nproducts, all of which go to landfill today (the company estimates that an \nindividual uses nearly 20 sanitary products on average per cycle, equating to \napproximately 250–300 pounds of waste in a lifetime).30\nDevelop a Robust Reverse Logistics Capability\nTo close their loops, leading companies have either set up their own reverse \nlogistics infrastructure or have collaborated with partners to provide that \ncapability. H&M chose the first approach and introduced a full-scale gar-\nment-collection initiative across all its stores around the world. Thanks to \nthat effort, the retailer was able to collect over 20,000 tons of textiles for \nreuse and recycling in 2018—the equivalent of 103 million T-shirts.31 An \nexample of the second approach (working with partners) is the “Collective \nRecycling Project,” which has established a recycling network in Chile that \naims to reduce waste and boost responsible disposal. The project started as \na joint collaboration between Walmart Chile, Coca-Cola Chile, PepsiCo, \nNestlé, and Unilever, with a goal to recycle 1200 metric tons of waste annu-\nally through five recycling centers in Santiago. That operation has now \nscaled to 15 centers managed by TriCiclos, which provides the companies \nwith a monthly report with data on the waste collected. The companies, in \nturn, can use the information to redesign and improve their products and \npackaging.32\nCollecting end-of-use products is a good first step, but it’s also impor-\ntant to optimize the value of that return flow.

It’s important to note that, while waste \nstrategies typically focus on a waste hierarchy (see Part I, “The Circular \nBusiness Models”), the highest value disposition may vary given inter-\nnal (e.g., inventory levels) and external (e.g., market demand) conditions. \nRobust and dynamic return logistics systems can help optimize the flows of \nreturned product to the right channels.\n  Chapter Takeaways\n•\t Companies can build circular product and service portfolios by focusing on \ninitiatives across four key areas: design, use, use extension, and end of use.\n•\t The initiative areas are closely interlinked and require holistic strategies \nacross all four in order to ultimately create truly circular products that are \nused indefinitely with a zero (or ideally a net positive) impact.\n•\t The journey to true circularity of products and services is complex. It \nmay require setting up entirely new supply chains and completely new \napproaches to upfront product design and development.\n•\t It also offers the greatest potential rewards as a driver of strategic growth, \nbrand value, and customer engagement, as well as long-term competitive-\nness by lowering costs and ensuring an indefinite supply of raw inputs.\n•\t Companies can take a stepped approach to prioritizing their circular prod-\nuct and services initiatives, focusing first on the opportunities with greatest \nstrategic fit, market demand, and technical readiness.\n•\t Achieving product circularity is enormously challenging and complex. It \nrequires leadership, innovation, strong cross-functional alignment, and the \ncreation of supporting ecosystems of suppliers and partners (discussed in \ndetail in the next two chapters).\nTransforming a company’s product portfolio toward circularity is a massive \nundertaking. To increase the odds of success, executives need to conduct an \nhonest assessment to gauge important factors in the organization’s readi-\nness for that transformation. The enterprise-wide survey should help identify \nthe key areas of focus and determine the important technologies that will be \nrequired. The following checklist can help in that assessment.\n",

That \nis, efforts to embed circular principles in the organizational culture should \nbe managed in coordination with the company’s ongoing circular initia-\ntives in the three other dimensions (Operations, Products & Services, and \nthe Ecosystem). A shared language and common goals toward circularity \nhelp avoid confusion. Once qualifying initiatives have been selected, pilot \nprojects should take place across various parts of the organization, encom-\npassing different business units and functions over time to create a strong \nfoundation for more inclusive enterprise-wide change.\nWhen prioritizing circular projects, leaders must assess which business \nfunctions are critical for success (and which are complementary), and they \nmust identify where changes to the traditional ways of working may be most \nneeded. Consider a company that’s implementing a new initiative for prod-\nuct circularity. Their plan is to increase product takeback and redirect those \nreturns to the highest value of second use by sending them to functions that \nhandle refurbished resale, services delivery, or parts recovery. Although this \ninitiative may be driven by logistics teams, it requires the engagement of \nsales teams in communicating and enforcing takeback policies and incen-\ntives, such as discounts to encourage customers to return products at end of \nuse. This can be a big challenge in a company where sales teams are used to \nlongstanding legacy incentives that must then be modified to accommodate \nthe new business model.\nTable 19.1  (continued)\nFocus area\nThe toolbox\nCulture & Organization in action\nGovernance\nRecognizing that the established \ninternal ways of doing business \nare likely to impede circular \ndecision-making at speed and \nbe a barrier for further uptake; \nmaking the circular economy a \ncore element in the company’s \nways of working and structure by \nembedding circularity in policies, \nprocesses, and procedures; and \nfocusing on accountability and \nagile decision-making enable-\nment from the “shop floor to the \ncorporate headquarters”\nGeneral Mills, the consumer \nfood company, has committed \nto 100% sustainable sourcing \nof 10 prioritized commodities, \nincluding oats, wheat, and corn \nby 2020.

Lacy et al.\nSimilarly, when integrating circularity into product designs, it can be a signif-\nicant shift for teams of engineers, designers, and technicians that have tradition-\nally been focused on cost or performance and that now need to adopt a new \nway of thinking to incorporate new, and often disruptive, principles. Questions \narise, such as, what kind of materials should they select? How can they avoid \ndesigning single-use products? In what ways can they increase product dura-\nbility? For operational initiatives, the challenge is usually not as great as with \nproduct initiatives because an organization’s sustainability targets are typically \ntied to operations, such as energy efficiency, water reduction, and waste elimi-\nnation. Teams within operational functions will likely be familiar with circular \nprinciples since they tend to have more experience with sustainability projects.\nBut, regardless of familiarity and comfort, executives should not rest until \nthe entire organization is aligned to circularity. Circularity should not feel \nlike something “extracurricular” for the workforce, it should be embedded \ninto employees’ tasks and functions just as any other facets of their roles. \nMoreover, companies need to have comprehensive and pervasive communi-\ncation and engagement activities as they progress along their circular jour-\nney. The goal is to promote awareness and to remove any tension between \nthose teams championing change and those that might be resistant. This \nenterprise-wide effort should be conducted in addition to more targeted \nefforts that bring together certain groups and functions that are key to \nimplementing specific initiatives (e.g., bringing together devices, sales, and \nlogistics in the example above).\nA Circular Journey: Vision and People\nDifferent companies will have different goals depending on their level \nof maturity. Table 19.2 summarizes the various characteristics of com-\npanies as they advance in their circular journey. Initiatives across the four \nareas of focus—vision, innovation, people, and governance—can range \nwidely, depending on the maturity of an organization. It’s important to \nnote that the initiatives across the four focus areas are closely interrelated. \nConsequently, companies must take a holistic approach to transforming \ntheir organizational culture, as the success of one initiative will hinge on the \nothers. Therefore, let’s examine the vision and people focus areas in parallel.\nA company can start by setting a circular goal for a specific business \nunit, perhaps the facilities or operations team. As the organization becomes \nmore mature in its circular journey, it would look to set an ambitious, long-\nterm goal that puts circularity at the heart of its mission statement to lead \na circular revolution in the wider value chain and ecosystem.

Specifically, they must raise awareness and educate internal stakeholders \non what the circular economy is, what it means for the company and strat-\negy, and how it will affect people’s roles and responsibilities. “It is important \nto be humble when we talk about circularity as it is a new concept that needs \nexplaining,” says Virginie Helias, Chief Sustainability Officer at global con-\nsumer goods company, P&G. This is echoed by Marc Delaye, Senior Executive \nVice President of Development, Innovation and Markets at water, waste, and \nenergy management solutions company Veolia, “The cultural transformation \ntowards the circular economy requires real commitment from leadership to \ntake action and raise awareness of what the circular economy means for us.”\nFor one thing, the circular economy could have different interpretations. \nBASF, the German chemical company, did a detailed analysis of more than \n9000 interviews with consumers, subject-matter experts, politicians, and \ntechnologists to understand industry trends across regions. The study uncov-\nered that “circular doesn’t equal circular”—that is, the term could mean \ndifferent things within and across industries. In addition, people are often \nconfused as to how circularity differs from broader sustainability initiatives \nand how it might help drive business value.\nAccording to Lisa Brady, Director of Supply Chain Sustainability and \nCircular Economy at technology conglomerate Cisco, it’s hard to make cir-\ncularity “real” for people. “They understand it’s the right thing to do, but \nthat doesn’t create behavioral change,” Brady explains. “It’s not intuitive that \nthe circular economy is a business imperative.” Therefore, in addition to \nbroad education, it often helps to socialize successful, circular “lighthouse” \nprojects within the company that bring the concept to life. As John Pflueger, \nPrinciple Environmental Strategist at Dell puts it, “With every pilot we \ncomplete and every successful use of recovered materials, we learn a little \nmore about what it takes to find success. A big piece of the transformation \nis in these learning cycles and communicating both what we’ve learned and \nwhat we know about existing opportunities within our business.”\nIn addition, a core set of tangible circular economy principles underpinning \nthe circular goal can help business units or brands prioritize and track their \n",

One effective \napproach is to select a team or business unit that’s already closely aligned \nto circular principles and then designate that group to drive the implemen-\ntation of the circular vision and strategies throughout the organization. \nAnother approach to creating organizational principles that resonate with \nthe workforce is to involve people in the process. For example, in 2017, \ntransportation network company Uber’s newly appointed CEO had employ-\nees submit and vote on cultural values for the workplace. This refresh was \nmeant to address issues that led to an investigation into Uber’s corporate \nculture. The results: 1200 submissions, 22,000 votes, and a set of eight new \ncultural norms.7\nAnother key aspect for success is to provide internal stakeholders with \nresources that allow for upskilling the workforce on circular economy prac-\ntices and principles. A company could start by delivering introductory \n“Circular Economy 101” training to targeted areas of the business, after \nwhich it can launch an expanded program to a wider pool of participants. \nUltimately, executives can scale a comprehensive company-wide training \nprogram, leveraging e-learning solutions for wider engagement. Educating \nthe workforce can be a challenging task—here, a company can partner \nwith an organization that can provide such expertise. Google’s partnership \nwith the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, for example, has helped embed \ncircular economy principles into the fabric of Google’s organization and \nculture.8\nFinally, to transform the corporate culture and enable a vision of circu-\nlarity across the board, an organization needs to establish the appropriate \nincentives that encourage circular thinking among its people. After setting \na long-term vision, executives might start by launching a circular incen-\ntive program within the sustainability team, outlining the right behaviors, \nprinciples, and criteria to be rewarded. The company can then expand the \nprogram across a wider range of business units, adapting it to the needs of \neach unit and ultimately scaling it across the entire organization and lead-\nership hierarchy. Recognizing the importance of incentives, global food \nand beverage company Danone implemented an incentive program for its \ntop management whereby a portion of long-term incentives is based on \nthe climate performance score attributed to the company by the CDP, a \nglobal nonprofit which ranks companies on their environmental progress. \nThe CDP score provides a way to encourage and reward progress toward \nDanone’s commitment to achieve carbon neutrality on its full value chain \nby 2050.9\n",

Although circular-driven change won’t happen overnight, it \ndoes have potential to generate substantial value over time. Let’s explore how \nCulture & Organization drives value across our four levers:\n  Revenue Generation:  By fostering a culture of innovation, organiza-\ntions can create new products and services and unlock new revenue streams. \nIn the previous chapter, Products & Services, we discussed the dramatic \ntransformation that Philips is undergoing, as the multinational corporation \nshifts toward circular business models. In 2018, green and circular revenues \namounted to 64 and 12% of the company’s sales, respectively.10 That type of \ntransformation would not have been possible without a focus on corporate \nculture. “It’s a mindset change,” explains Frans van Houten, CEO of Philips. \n“The challenge is now to scale up and embed circular in all processes, and \nmake circular thinking the new normal.”\n  Cost Savings:  A circular organizational culture can help gener-\nate significant employee value by increasing a company’s ability to attract \nand retain top talent, as purpose-driven business practices, sustainabil-\nity, and circular themes are increasingly important to the current work-\nforce, as well as to job seekers. This is key in reducing recruitment costs, \ngiven the average cost-per-hire for a company is over $4000, according to \na report by the Society for Human Resource Management.11 A recent Cone \nCommunications study revealed the following about millennial job seekers: \n76% consider a company’s social and environmental commitments before \ndeciding where to work; 64% won’t take a job if a potential employer doesn’t \nhave strong corporate responsibility practices; and 75% would take a pay cut \nto work for a socially responsible company.12 As David Rosenberg, CEO and \nCo-Founder of urban agriculture company AeroFarms states, “We receive \nover 2000 applications every month from job seekers. For a company with \nless than 100 employees, our ability to attract top talent is largely due to our \ncircular ethos. We see this as a real competitive advantage.”\n  Risk Reduction:  A circular culture not only supports a company’s \nemployee recruitment and retention efforts, but it also helps keep workers \nengaged.

As such, it holds the poten-\ntial to open new markets and customer segments. That’s one reason why \nmany companies have actively touted their circular initiatives and organi-\nzational culture to the outside world. “We are a purpose-driven company. \n‘Brewing for a better today and tomorrow’ is used both internally and exter-\nnally to remind ourselves about our unique purpose and to share it with the \nworld,” says Flemming Besenbacher, Chairman of Carlsberg Group and the \nCarlsberg Foundation.\n  Case Study: Danone\nDanone provides a good example of a global corporation that has taken a \nholistic approach to developing a circular culture.14 The company’s journey \nillustrates the different stages of cultural maturity depicted in our table.\nIn the emerging stage, Danone decided to embed circular principles in its \noperations and organizational design. Specifically, Danone organized its pro-\ncurement function around three key strategic resource “cycles”—water, milk, \nand plastic. This was intended to break up traditional linear silos by regroup-\ning procurement, research and innovation, and sustainability under the same \nleadership. To lead its strategic resources unit, Danone created the position of \nChief Cycles and Procurement Officer, currently held by Katharina Stenholm. \nKatharina described the impact of the cycles organization: “The cycles are \nensuring that circularity is embedded within Danone’s procurement strategy. \nIt has been a catalyst in transforming how we work, allowing us to leverage \ncapabilities cross-functionally and anchor change in the way Danone operates.”\nBuilding on this momentum, Danone took a series of defining decisions. \nThe company launched a new company vision—“One Planet. One Health”—to \nreflect the company’s belief that the planet’s health and people’s health are \ninterconnected. It became a global leader in plant-based and organic food and \nbeverages through a strategic acquisition. And the company set carbon reduc-\ntion targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, as part of its jour-\nney toward zero net emissions across its entire value chain by 2050.\nAs Danone advanced to the leading stage of maturity, Danone committed \nto becoming one of the first multi-nationals to be certified as a B Corp. As of \n2019, more than 30% of Danone’s sales are now covered by B Corp certifica-\ntion, and Danone North America is the largest B Corp in the world.

Responding to environmental challenges by “pre-\nserving and renewing the planet’s resources” is a key component of this vision. \nIt signals Danone’s ambition to have a positive impact on the planet (rather \nthan a “do no harm” approach), in line with circular economy principles.\n  Technology as an Enabler: Deep Dive on the \nChief Technology and Information Officer’s Role \nin a Circular Journey\nTechnology is a critical enabler of the circular economy. It helps drive the \nadoption of sustainable innovations, embed circular processes, provide \ntraceability, perform advanced analytics, and scale solutions, among many \nother benefits. As we have discussed in Chapter 2 and elsewhere, lead-\ning companies have been applying technology in previously unimaginable \nways to drive circular value and revamp entire businesses. All this, of course, \nrequires the right leadership from and mindset of the Chief Technology and \nInformation Officer (CTIO).\nThe CTIO is in a unique position to see horizontally across the com-\npany and understand the overall technological needs of the organization, \nespecially across functions that are often siloed. In a 4IR-enabled circu-\nlar world, the role of the CTIO becomes even more important. Not only \nmust the CTIO position span across the IT department, engineering, R&D, \nand product development, it must also possess a broad understanding of \ntechnologies across the digital, physical, and biological domains, as well as \nknowledge of how to integrate these rapidly changing technologies across \nlegacy functions. In a circular economy, the role of CTIO evolves to be \neven more of a corporate change agent, responsible for driving automation, \ninsights, and circular innovations across the organization. In other words, \nthe CTIO office is where the proverbial rubber hits the road as a company \nimplements circular initiatives. So, then, how should CTIOs get started to \nassume that role?\nThe Circular CTIO Imperatives\nThe circular CTIO’s first imperative is often to address resource efficiency. \nThis means examining the various waste pools generated by the company in \n",

The analysis should take into account a number of variables \nsuch as energy/water/waste management, inventory management, facilities \noperational efficiency, data center efficiency, fleet management, and logis-\ntics efficiency. CTIOs should be on the lookout for any potential “quick \nwins”: opportunities for minimizing existing waste streams or for generating \nvalue out of waste and by-products that can be pursued within an existing \nbusiness without requiring considerable investments. For example, a CTIO \nmight work in collaboration with the operations function to drive out \nwasted energy and resources used to power manufacturing plants, leveraging \na combination of analytics, automation, and process optimization.\nTo be effective in implementing circular applications, CTIOs must \ndevelop the ability to identify, assess, and monitor resource usage and \nefficiency across the core business value chain. This requires tools for pro-\nviding visibility across the supply chain, sensors for testing the performance \n(including resource use) of production facilities and data centers, and sys-\ntems for gathering performance data to build an analytics capability that \ncan provide insights into efficiency gains, including predictive maintenance. \nWith these capabilities, CTIOs will be able to obtain an in-depth, data-in-\nformed understanding of the technology and process changes needed to shift \ntheir company from linear to circular. A notable example of a technology \nthat can deliver both circular and economic “quick wins” is cloud comput-\ning. The technology delivers multiple efficiencies and economies of scale that \ncan help an organization’s operations run in a more cost-effective and flexi-\nble manner, as well as contribute to energy and emissions savings. A study \nby Microsoft and professional services firm WSP found that the Microsoft \ncloud is up to 93% more energy efficient (and up to 98% more carbon-ef-\nficient) than on-site solutions. By 2030, the electricity consumption of data \ncenters in the United States is expected to grow to 73 billion kilowatt-hours \nannually, the equivalent of the energy consumed by six million homes. This \nfigure would be much higher without the efficiencies realized in commercial \ncloud data centers.15\nWith an understanding of resource usage and waste pools across the \norganization, CTIOs can better identify opportunities to reuse, refur-\nbish, remanufacture, or recycle non-virgin resources back into the value \nchain. For many industries, this first involves closing the loop within opera-\ntions and manufacturing: putting wasted materials on-site (e.g., production \nby-products, unprocessed water, etc.) back into the company’s own internal \nvalue chain, often as raw inputs or energy. For some industries, this may \nalso involve taking materials back from the end consumer—both products \n",

By harnessing 4IR \ntechnologies, such as artificial intelligence to provide logistics insights for \nproduct retrieval or mobile devices to enable consumer returns, reverse logis-\ntics can be made more cost-effective and companies can engage customers in \ntheir wider circular journey.\nCTIOs are also responsible for developing and testing technological \nsolutions that could enable the company’s journey from linear to circular \nmodels of production and consumption. As mentioned earlier, this could \ninvolve solutions across the wider range of 4IR digital, physical, and bio-\nlogical technologies. AMP Robotics, for example, developed a solution that \nleverages digital and physical innovations to revolutionize recycling. The \ncompany uses AI (machine vision and deep learning) and robotics to cre-\nate an intelligent, extremely efficient sorting system. AMP Robotics also uses \nthe cloud to digitize the material stream and optimize operations. This type \nof solution could be widely applicable for any organization looking to tackle \nwaste recovery.\nTo identify which 4IR solutions are most appropriate to drive circular-\nity, the CTIO will need to understand the value behind the product that is \nbeing sold and identify alternative ways to deliver that same value with less \nresource use, for example, automakers delivering personal mobility through \ncar sharing versus ownership.\nThe final imperative for CTIOs is to regenerate and restore. Specifically, \nCTIOs must work closely with R&D and product design teams to help find \nalternative materials, processes, and technologies to regenerate resources in \nperpetuity with no (or minimal) loss of energy and resources. The goal is a \nfully closed-loop system that can upcycle resources infinitely.\nIn summary, CTIOs need to shape their organization’s circular agenda by:\n•\t Leading the way: CTIOs will be central in the circular economy tran-\nsition and, in most cases, will need to drive those initiatives themselves, \nincluding staying up to date with trends and working to understand the \ncircular potential of their organizations.\n•\t Embedding circular innovation: CTIOs must help foster an innovation \nculture targeted at circular value by raising internal awareness, by setting \nup innovation hubs, and/or by assigning specific roles for the discovery \nand assessment of technologies of circular value.\n•\t Enabling agility: CTIOs need to build the foundations for a flexible \noperating model to enable the testing and pivoting of new technologies \nand/or business models.\n",

But a num-\nber of firms have made significant progress toward achieving a circular cul-\nture. Our study of those organizations has revealed a number of leading \npractices.\nLead from the Top-Down with Flexibility\nOne thing that leading companies all agree on is that cultural change must \nhave sponsorship and active participation from the top of the organization. \nAccording to Flemming Besenbacher, Chairman of Carlsberg Group and the \nCarlsberg Foundation, “Senior leaders need to drive the process, with a full \ncommitment from the management and board. At Carlsberg, the compa-\nny’s leadership team co-created its sustainability program and 2030 ambi-\ntions, which are strongly supported by the CEO and board.” To help that \ntrickle flow down through the organizational hierarchy, reporting lines and \naccountability are crucial. At Nike, management collaborates with teams \nto determine the appropriate goals, and senior executives are given regular \nupdates of the company’s progress toward those goals.\nWhile reporting lines and accountability are important, executives must \nalso lead with flexibility. The circular economy fundamentally changes the \nway that companies have traditionally done business, which can lead to \nconsiderable uncertainty and anxiety among employees. “Driving circular-\nity is about leadership: you need to have the vision and courage to work \nin a totally unchartered territory, and you sometimes need to take a leap \nof faith,” remarks Virginie Helias, Chief Sustainability Officer at P&G. \nBecause of that uncertainty, executives need to maintain open communi-\ncations with their teams to figure out what’s working (or what’s not) and \nthen to adapt accordingly. “It can be challenging to bring different func-\ntions together to align on circular economy when they each have their own \n",

To address those issues, Cisco \nset up an Executive Change Network that helped to break down functional \nsiloes and get everyone aligned to tackle circularity as a business imperative. \n“You have to look holistically to tie the parts together,” says Brady. Because \ncircular initiatives generally require companies to go outside their com-\nfort zones, such flexibility can often be the difference between failure and \nsuccess.\nBring Innovation to the Core\nFor large multinational corporations, transforming an existing culture to \nencompass circularity can be a daunting task. In contrast, start-ups and \nSMEs that are founded on a circular and sustainable ethos have an advan-\ntage in that they build their cultures from the ground up. Can anything be \nlearned from these smaller, purpose-driven firms? We believe that an impor-\ntant lesson is for companies to avoid “half-measures” and to embrace circu-\nlarity wholeheartedly. Consider cleaning products company method, which \nhas a very straightforward, ambitious vision (“to create a new sector of the \neconomy that uses the power of business to solve social and environmen-\ntal problems”) and Seventh Generation, a Vermont startup acquired by \nUnilever that took its name and guiding principle (“in our every delibera-\ntion, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven genera-\ntions”) from The Great Law of the Iroquois philosophy that the decisions we \nmake today should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the \nfuture.\nTo move from such lofty corporate visions to concrete actions, manage-\nment should consider establishing guiding principles and metrics, such as \nby mandating that a certain percentage of the product development team’s \nbudget be applied to a pilot project for circular innovation. In addition, \nexecutives should encourage a “test and learn” entrepreneurial mindset by \nimplementing incentives that reward innovative thinking, and by allocating \nsufficient financial and human resources to circular R&D. At P&G, man-\nagement had purposefully targeted a low success rate in order to boost over-\nall innovation, all in line with the “fail faster to succeed sooner” approach \nto R&D. According to A. G.

Consider \nZX Ventures, a global growth and innovation group within AB InBev. ZX \nVentures invests in and develops new products and businesses that meet \nemerging consumer needs. In addition, AB InBev has also established its \nGlobal Innovation and Technology Center, which brings together diverse \nteams from packaging, product, and process development.17 “We are con-\ntinually innovating to bring the best possible products to consumers with \nthe lowest impact on the planet. We know we cannot accomplish our ambi-\ntious sustainability goals alone. As a global brewer operating in more than \n50 countries, we are supporting entrepreneurs from around the world who \nhave the bold ideas to deliver a sustainable future,” states Tony Milikin, \nChief Sustainability and Procurement Officer at AB InBev.\nBuild the Necessary Structures and Capabilities\nAs companies advance toward greater maturity, they will need to build foun-\ndational structures to operationalize their circular initiatives and entrench \ncircular principles within the organizational culture. Developing the right \nmechanisms to support circular initiatives is key to realizing the potential of \ncircular initiatives in terms of potential revenues, customer engagement, cost \nsavings, and so on.\nAs part of that infrastructure, companies need to invest in their data \narchitectures to optimize the flows of circular information and to embed the \ncircular economy across functions. “We are digitizing a lot of the interaction \nbetween supply chain and engineering, which helps embed the right mate-\nrials and circular design into their work process,” says Lisa Brady of Cisco. \nIn setting up that infrastructure, companies have to think holistically in cre-\nating new linkages across the organization. If, for instance, the firm is plan-\nning to implement a business model for product use extension, then it needs \nto connect all the necessary functions to accomplish that. Doing so would \nrequire blueprints for digitizing the interactions between those functions in \norder to establish common workflows and to make the right tools accessible \nto those who need them.\n",

Such \nwas the case with Winnow Solutions, which offers an AI tool that helps \ncommercial kitchens reduce their waste. The company’s application uses \ncameras and digital scales to automatically track food that’s thrown out, and \nAI technology helps pinpoint the areas of greatest waste (e.g., dishes with \ntoo-large portions). According to Winnow founder Marc Zornes, any tech-\nnology won’t by itself necessarily result in the desired change, but it can \nempower employees to drive that change from the front lines of the organ-\nization. “All chefs abhor food waste,” says Zornes. “Winnow brings every-\nbody together around this problem, gives people a sense of purpose in the \nkitchen, and builds a teamwork mentality. People who see the waste are not \nalways the people who make decisions. Winnow can make that connection \nto empower the staff to make suggestions and drive change.”\nFoster a Mindset Shift\nChanging the organizational culture typically requires a big shift in mind-\nset, and management needs to impress that on associates across the entire \ncompany. American clothing company Patagonia has long been a trailblazer \nin establishing a culture of corporate responsibility, as evidenced by its cur-\nrent mission statement: “We’re in business to save our home planet.” And \nthe company doesn’t just talk the talk; it walks the walk by actively taking a \nstand on issues that are central to its core values. Founder Yvon Chouinard \nhas said that, all things being equal, Patagonia always looks to fill a job \nopening with the person who’s committed to save the planet, regardless of \nthe position.18 At Philips, the electronics multinational, the required trans-\nformation in mindset is also being actively pursued with customers. The \nDutch corporation is increasingly getting questions from hospitals on how \nPhilips offerings can contribute to the sustainability ambitions of those \ncustomers. “Obviously, this often requires a mindset change for customers \nwell,” says Frans van Houten, CEO of Philips. “Especially in procurement \ndepartments, where people are used to purchase new equipment (and get rid \nof old machinery) over typical cycles of five to 10 years, rather than upgrade \nthem or move over to different ownership models in which the customer \npays for access rather than ownership. We can help them with our expertise.”\nAnother aspect of the shift in mindset involves the recognition that ambi-\ntious circular targets and successful delivery require a longer-term time hori-\nzon.

It is one of \nthe most critical enabling levers to creating a circular economy within a \ncompany’s operations, across its products and services, and throughout its \necosystem.\n•\t A circular pivot needs ambition (big targets), prioritization (embedded \nin corporate strategy), scale across the business (employee buy-in), and a \nlonger time horizon to support successful delivery.\n•\t Companies should establish what the circular economy means for them \nearly on and educate people on the case for change by demonstrating how \nthe transition will impact their roles and day-to-day responsibilities. It is cru-\ncial to get everyone in the company engaged and to encourage people to \ncontribute to building a circular company.\n•\t A circular journey involves weaving circular principles into the core vision, \nmission, and culture of a company, such that the organizational structure \nincentivizes people to embrace innovation around circular operations and \ndeliver circular products and services.\nTo implement a shift in a company’s culture and organization, leaders should \nfirst conduct an assessment to understand their company’s readiness for a cul-\ntural transformation. The assessment should help identify key areas of focus \nand determine the best strategies to launch a circular journey. The following \nconsiderations can help in that assessment.\nSample Questions to Answer\nShaping a circular vision\n□ What does our company wish to be in the future, and how can it drive cir-\ncular impact?\n□ What circular principles can become central to our company’s way of doing \nbusiness?\n□ How do we create a circular vision that resonates with people across the \nvalue chain, and drives the entire industry forward?\n□ How does a circular vision align with our existing business and innovation \nstrategies?\n",

We \nview ecosystem engagement as a key stepping stone for companies to not \nonly contribute to circularity in the wider business environment, but also \nto build the foundation for an effective wise pivot. The ultimate goal is a \nfully connected organization with suppliers, logistics partners, and technol-\nogies enabling material circularity, underpinned by engaged consumers, and \nsupporting policies. According to Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO \nof Schneider Electric, a French multinational energy management company, \n“The biggest impact for us has been making sure we rethink everything we \ndo in a more circular way – within Schneider Electric and the ecosystem \naround us, including a full-lifecycle relationship with our customers, our \nsuppliers, partners, and integrators of our technology. There is tangible busi-\nness value from circularity, especially when you bring the right stakeholders \ntogether to create system-level change.”\nGenerally speaking, ecosystem leadership has often been viewed as a \n“final” step once the other dimensions of the circular pivot (Operations, \nProducts & Services, and Culture & Organization) have been tackled. \nCompanies have tended to focus first on “getting their own house in order,” \nthat is, they often want to demonstrate their proven circular capabilities \nbefore actively participating in broader movements. That’s because ecosys-\ntems are typically more removed from the direct supply chain of an organ-\nization and, in many cases, they require an additional level of trust and \nopenness, especially when working with new partners and peers.\nUnfortunately, though, companies can no longer treat their ecosystems as \na “backburner” issue. Today, ecosystems must be considered as a precursor \nto achieving scale and impact, especially given the massive challenges that \nmany industries and regions face. Consider, for example, building the col-\nlection infrastructure for product takeback or setting up robust alternative \nsupply chains to support an industry transition to circular business models. \nSuch tasks would be a huge undertaking for any single company. Plus, the \neconomic case for change might not be attractive without the support of the \nfull spectrum of partners crucial to success. That’s why we believe it’s nearly \nimpossible to unlock the circular economy’s full potential without consider-\ning a company or industry’s broader ecosystem. The Coca-Cola Company, \nfor instance, recognized that in order to achieve its own circular economy \ntargets, it needed to work within both its direct value chain and with com-\npetitors to move the entire industry forward. The company announced \nthat, by 2030, it would collect a bottle or can for each one that it put in \nthe market. To reach that ambitious goal, The Coca-Cola Company knew \n",

Moreover, the two parties have \nagreed on an ongoing contract that guarantees and incentivizes Veolia to \ncommit to performance improvements.6 According to Marc Delaye, Senior \nExecutive Vice President, Development, Innovation, and Markets at Veolia, \n“Both the form and the goals of this alliance make it a truly unique initiative \nin creating economic, social and environmental value.”5\nThe second type of collaboration initiative is to create multilateral solutions \nby convening with multiple stakeholders to address a shared circular challenge. \nConsider the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), hosted \nby the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the World Resources Institute, \nwhich includes more than 50 members ranging from leading CEOs to gov-\nernment ministers to heads of international organizations. PACE acts as a pro-\nject accelerator for business models and markets in various areas. The goal is to \ndevelop blended financing models for circular economy projects, to support \nenabling policy frameworks, to address specific barriers to advancing the cir-\ncular economy, and to encourage public-private collaborations to scale impact \naround circular initiatives. One specific PACE initiative, the “New Vision for \nElectronics,” brought together all relevant UN bodies with the support of the \nWEF and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development to co-cre-\nate a new shared vision of a circular electronics industry.7\nTo be effective, collaborations within and between organizations should \nrely heavily on the sharing of unique knowledge and capabilities. A prime \nexample was the successful collaboration between global confectionary man-\nufacturer Mars, multinational IT company IBM, and the US Department of \nAgriculture (USDA), which worked together to map the cocoa genome for \nthe benefit of the wider industry. Mars contributed its scientific leadership and \nknowledge of the cocoa supply chain; IBM shared its expertise in computa-\ntional biology as well as the Blue Gene supercomputer; and the USDA offered \nits knowledge of the agricultural sector and policy. Pooling these unique capa-\nbilities and expertise allowed the collaboration to research and map the cocoa \ngenome to improve crop quality and sustain the supply of cocoa.8\nUltimately, the goal across both types of collaborations (bilateral and mul-\ntilateral) is to foster effective knowledge sharing, while propelling action to \ntackle industry (and global) issues.

The primary aim was \nto improve responsible water use throughout H&M’s entire supply chain, \ngoing beyond factory lines. The partnership has led to a number of concrete \noutcomes for H&M, such as water training for 70,000 employees, as well as \nhigher standards for better water and chemical management at more than 500 \nsuppliers. The positive results have inspired further collective action, bringing \ntogether other companies, policymakers, and the public to contribute to sus-\ntainable water management in targeted areas. In China, for example, the first \nwater stewardship guidelines for the textile industry were introduced. Based \non such successes, the partnership was further expanded in 2016 to encom-\npass climate action and a dialogue on strategic issues related to the fashion \nindustry, including the co-creation of tools that would help H&M teams \nmove toward a circular approach when creating new products.9,10\nThe Value Drivers\nIn the previous chapters, we discussed the various ways that value can be \ngenerated within an organization. While Operations, Products & Services, \nand Culture & Organization mobilize the circular value a company can cap-\nture within their own enterprise-wide boundaries, a circular ecosystem is \ncritical in supporting and scaling initiatives outside the organization, which \ncan, in turn, have a positive impact on the internal operations of a company \nin the following ways:\n  Revenue Generation:  Sometimes a collaboration is needed to com-\nmercialize a unique circular product offering. One example is Southwest \nAirlines, a US airline that is using circular economy principles to grow rev-\nenues and enhance its brand reputation. Rather than dispose of 80,000 \nleather aircraft seats it removed during a fleet refit earlier this year, for exam-\nple, the airline gave the leather to US “upcycler” Looptworks, that identifies \nmarketing opportunities for waste materials by converting them into fash-\nionable leather items.11\n  Cost Savings:  Collaborations can also be particularly effective for \nreducing costs. When British automotive company Jaguar Land Rover \nwanted to decrease the use of virgin aluminum in the production process, \nit collaborated with Novelis, its material supplier, as well as with Innovate \nUK, an innovation agency in the UK. The partnership led to REALCAR, \n",

This can help \ndifferentiate a company from its competitors in the industry, not just among \ncustomers but also with shareholders, investors, the media, and prospec-\ntive employees. Many of the world’s leading brands are members of major \ncircular ecosystem enablers, such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the \nAlliance to End Plastic Waste, and the Platform for Accelerating the Circular \nEconomy initiative. By collaborating with such ecosystem-building organi-\nzations, companies can link their brand to the wider circular economy mis-\nsion, signaling that commitment to customers, employees, investors, and \nother stakeholders.\n  Technology as a Key Enabler\nIn several ways, technology can play a central role in enabling ecosystems. \nFor one thing, digital platforms allow companies and industries to more \neasily share resources. These platforms drive resource efficiency by helping \nto extend the use of products and by providing marketplaces for waste. The \naim is that the excess capacity or waste of one business (or industry) can \nbecome the input for another business (or industry). That was the think-\ning behind Austin Materials Marketplace, an online platform for businesses \n",

Since its launch in 2014, the platform \nhas diverted over 55,000 cubic feet from landfill, generated over $600,000 \nin cost savings and value creation, and avoided 900 metric tons of carbon \nemissions.13\nOnline platforms are also a powerful tool for enabling knowledge shar-\ning and open innovation, as participants can easily exchange ideas, share \ninsights, and co-create solutions for overcoming circular challenges. The \nopen access innovation platform Circle Lab acts as a “Wikipedia for circular-\nity”: an online space for individuals, businesses, organizations, and cities to \ndiscover, discuss, and share circular business practices and strategies to tackle \nboth local and global challenges. During a “Circular Economy Mapping \nWeek,” an event organized by a partnership between the Circular Economy \nClub and Circle Economy, 3000 circular initiatives were documented.14\nIn addition to digital platforms, other innovations can enable compa-\nnies to more easily share the same value chain or connect different ones. \nSpecifically, advanced analytics and tracking technologies can allow different \nbusinesses to use the same logistics infrastructure for route optimization. In \nBelgium, Nestlé and PepsiCo have partnered to combine their truck fleets \nand routes for delivering fresh, chilled products to stores. According to the \nWorld Economic Forum, the partnership has cut transportation costs by \n44% and reduced carbon emissions by 55%. To maintain proprietary infor-\nmation between the two companies (and to avoid any antitrust complaints), \na third party handles the intricate logistics of the operation.\nLeading Practices to Drive Transformation\nA number of companies have had considerable success through participation \nin circular ecosystems. How were they able to achieve that? Studying those \nbusinesses, we can highlight the following key lessons and best practices.\nRe-define Value Chain Engagement\nIn the circular economy, no single company can do it alone. Although busi-\nnesses can make significant strides to improve their own operations and \nprovide circular products and services, they will eventually need a systems \napproach to expand and unlock the full potential of circularity. This applies \neven to large multinationals like Procter & Gamble. Having exhausted the \n",

Indeed, even a subset of the overall problem might be too enormous \nfor any one company to tackle alone. Consider food waste. “We are try-\ning to solve a trillion-dollar problem and we can’t do it alone,” notes Marc \nZornes from Winnow. “We need a plethora of organizations to solve it in \ndifferent ways.”\nAs industry lines become more blurred and value chains compressed, the \ncircular economy opens up a multitude of possibilities for companies to \nrethink how they interact up and down their entire value chains with cus-\ntomers, suppliers, communities, and partners. Many of those possibilities \nwill include invaluable opportunities for collaborations. Cisco has always \ntried to foster an open and collaborative environment with their suppliers \nand partners. From those partnerships, Cisco is constantly receiving valuable \nideas for how to re-engineer its products. “We’re not just dictating policy to \nour suppliers about what materials they can and can’t use,” says John Kern, \nSenior Vice President of Supply Chain Operations at Cisco. “We want them \nto be part of a collaborative process. We need their ideas.”\nThat said, significant challenges remain in evolving ecosystems to full \ncircularity. A supply chain that is more forward-flow focused, for instance, \ninherently creates barriers for moving into recycled content, presenting pro-\ncess challenges for remanufacturing. To overcome those obstacles, compa-\nnies will need to collaborate closely with their suppliers and other ecosystem \nactors to optimize reverse flows. This means putting functions in place that \ncan reprocess materials and match supply with demand so that the waste \nfrom one flow can become the raw input to another, leading to substantial \nbusiness value.\nThe effort required to set up a holistic circular ecosystem should not be \nunderestimated, but it is achievable even for a complex, large-scale network \nof different parties. A good example of that is the Port of Amsterdam, intent \non harnessing systems in a common aim to connect and monetize opera-\ntional waste streams across industries. The port has become a hub for cir-\ncular and bio-based growth, surrounded by a cluster of circular companies \nthat include bioplastics and biodiesel producers. The goal is to replace fos-\nsil fuel cargo with biomass and to convert organic waste, all while creating \njobs and spurring economic growth. “The Port of Amsterdam has ambi-\ntious goals when it comes to the circular economy,” notes Micha Hes, the \nPort of Amsterdam’s Business Development Manager, Circular Economy. \n",

Already, 6% of \nits turnover is circular based, and the goal is to grow that number to 10% by \n2021.15\nLeverage (Disruptive) Partners  \nto Develop and Deploy New Solutions\nAs discussed throughout this book, technology is a key enabler for circu-\nlar initiatives, especially as companies begin to scale their circular solu-\ntions beyond their boundaries. Consequently, executives need to be on \nthe constant lookout for new innovations, and ways in which their eco-\nsystems can help develop those emerging technologies and accelerate their \nbroad adoption to achieve scale. That was the strategy behind Procter & \nGamble’s collaboration with PureCycle Technologies to speed the adoption \nof P&G’s innovative plastic-recycling method, in which plastics are sep-\narated from other waste, delivering an ultrapure recycled polypropylene. \nP&G has licensed the patented technology to PureCycle, which recently \npartnered with Nestlé and other companies to help spread adoption of the \ntechnology.16,17 In the fashion industry, Ferragamo, an Italian luxury goods \ncompany, has joined with Orange Fiber, a company that manufactures \nthe first fabric made from by-products of citrus juice production. The col-\nlaboration has led to a new collection of goods, enhanced by prints by an \naward-winning designer.18,19\nFor such partnerships to succeed, an organization must forge the capa-\nbility to understand the value delivered, analyze the scalability of projects, \nfunnel and prioritize partners, and determine compatibility with its existing \noperating model and processes. Large corporations can offer tremendous \nresources and capabilities as a partner, but they are often limited in how \nmuch risk the core business can take on. From that perspective, partnerships \nwith innovative smaller firms are often necessary.\nInvest for the Long Term (and Get “Buy In” \nfrom Shareholders and Investors)\nExecutives and policymakers should be committed to supporting circular \necosystems as long-term investments, and finance departments and financial \n",

Indeed, investment in organizations, business models, \nproducts, technologies, or non-commercial third parties is the crucial step-\nping stone for practical circular solutions to unfold within an industry or \nregion. The Danish government learned that long-term investments in inno-\nvations like wind farms were critical to allow such technologies to mature, \neventually enabling them to become commercialized without the need for \nadditional subsidies. According to BASF, the German chemical company, \nlarge shareholders are starting to adopt long-term thinking, but investment \nmanagers need to catch up with that mindset. “There is still uncertainty \nand lack of cohesiveness on how you measure circular solutions – they don’t \nknow what to look for yet,” notes Saori Dubourg, Member of the Executive \nBoard at BASF. As such, organizations must help educate shareholders and \ninvestors on the value of circularity (and demonstrate it with strong business \ncases), so that new systems for measurement and management that support \na circular economy can be adopted. According to Dubourg, “We need to \nreframe how we measure success in business and move away from focusing \nsolely on profits to creating profit, human capital, and environmental good. \nIt is key to report on all three elements and link decision-making and incen-\ntives to the triple bottom line.”\nWork Proactively with Policymakers\nAs a company becomes increasingly engaged with its ecosystem, the regula-\ntory environment can be a key enabler—or a major obstacle (see “Policy—\nThe Role of Policymakers”). Executives are therefore encouraged to work \nwith the public sector and cross-industry peers to co-create smarter poli-\ncies that will allow a systemic step change in the circular economy. As Luca \nMeini, Head of Circular Economy at Enel, an Italian energy company, \npoints out, “Legislation can represent a limiting factor in some countries – \none of the biggest barriers to success. Legislative silos between sectors should \nbe overcome to enable circular solutions.” In many cases, policymakers are \nwilling to support the circular economy, but they often lack a more com-\nprehensive view of what is needed to foster that transition. That is one of \nthe situations where companies can step in, engaging with the public policy \ncommunity to help shape policy that curbs irresponsible competitors, raises \ncollective standards, and enables innovation.

Lacy et al.\nlikely business models, companies have been increasingly willing to share \ntheir ideas and expertise to support the wider transition.\nThis is the strategy deployed by Carlsberg and the Danish government. \nFlemming Besenbacher, Chairman of Carlsberg Group and the Carlsberg \nFoundation, drafted a report for the Danish government to inspire its work \ntoward the circular economy, suggesting 27 initiatives that might promote \ncircular economy in Danish society and the business world. The issue is of \ncrucial importance to society and to Carlsberg Group because it operates in \n98 Danish municipalities that all treat waste differently today. “We are try-\ning to adjust regulation to achieve collective impact, but it takes time and \npatience to get there,” says Besenbacher. “We cannot expect governments to \nact alone. Partnering with business is key to move the needle and Carlsberg \nGroup is already leading this development.”\nAnd sometimes, not only should a company collaborate with govern-\nments to enact the appropriate regulations to encourage circularity, it needs \nto be one step ahead and assume the reins in that effort. That is, before \nbeing required to do so, a business could move ahead of the curve by adopt-\ning new standards for circular practices, such as a minimum level of recy-\ncled content in its products. In Denmark in 2013, multiple associations and \ncompanies in the electronics industry entered the “Voluntary Agreement on \nWEEE (Waste and Electronic Equipment)” jointly with the Ministry for the \nEnvironment. The aim was to promote the eco-design of electrical and elec-\ntronic equipment and to create incentives for better and more separation, \nreuse, and recycling of used electronics. The results of the agreement, which \nran from 2014 to 2016, confirmed the large potential for circular solutions \nthrough eco-design.20 Recently, companies and industry associations have \ntaken a similar approach in addressing the plastics waste problem, which \noffers the dual benefit of tackling a serious environmental problem and cap-\nturing considerable business benefits. The European Strategy for Plastics \ncalled on stakeholders to make voluntary pledges to use or produce more \nrecycled plastics and, by the end of 2018, 70 companies and business associ-\nations had done so.21\nWhen companies do this together with industry peers or partners along \nthe supply chain, it raises the playing field for all, paving the way to engage \nwith policymakers to turn voluntary arrangements into policy. “When \nindustry takes the lead, it is easier to have a productive dialogue and act in \nconcert with government,” explains Michael Goltzman from The Coca-Cola \nCompany. “The bigger challenge is when industry does not take the lead and \nwhen public opinion and other pressures drive the need for government to \nact first.”\n",

Currently, the capital that \nwill underpin the shift to new circular business models far outweighs what \nis readily available and accessible. Through 2050, an estimated $3.5 trillion \nper year in investments is needed just to build required clean energy infra-\nstructure.1 That clearly won’t be enough. UNCTAD, a UN body dealing \nwith trade, investment, and development, estimates that $3.9 trillion a year \nis needed in developing countries alone from 2015 to 2030 to fully meet the \n17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.2 Consequently, it’s incumbent on \nfinancial institutions to recognize their role in a circular economy ecosys-\ntem and provide the necessary investments and tools to drive the move from \nlinear to circular. In doing so, they can gain competitive advantage in three \nimportant ways:\n•\t Growth: During the last decade, the financial industry has begun to \nappreciate the potential of long-term sustainable business practices and, \nas that mindset has evolved, more investments have begun to flow. Green \nbonds, which cover several key elements of the circular economy, for \ninstance, increased over three-hundredfold, from less than $500 million \nin 2008 to $163 billion in 2017, with a cumulative figure of $580 bil-\nlion of green bonds sold up to 2018.3,4 In addition, companies can now \nissue “transition bonds” to finance technologies or new business models \nthat support the transition to low-carbon intensive alternatives.1 Growth \n21\n  Ecosystem Deep Dive #1:  \nInvestment—The Role of Financial Services\n© The Author(s) 2020 \nP.

We have seen an increase in appetite within ING to \nfinance circular propositions and clients.”\n•\t Differentiation: Financial services companies that emerge as pioneers in \nscaling the circular economy will establish a leadership position, gaining \nsignificant advantage over their peers. Says Massimiano Tellini, Global \nHead Circular Economy at Intesa Sanpaolo, an Italian banking group, \n“The financial service industry doesn’t yet understand that there is a huge \nopportunity in being a pioneer, leading the way and creating demand for \nthe circular economy. We need to be proactive and not just responsive.”\n•\t License to operate and risk mitigation: As governments and other stake-\nholder groups become more aware of the importance of transitioning to a \ncircular economy, they will begin exerting increasing pressure on industries \nto support the shift. For the heavily regulated financial industry, invest-\nments in circular businesses now should help mitigate those risks and ena-\nble companies to secure a license to operate. Moreover, a huge advantage \nof transitioning to the circular economy that few financial institutions are \ntaking into account is the mitigation of risks that will become increasingly \nprevalent in the future; these include the risk of virgin material depend-\nency, the associated price fluctuations, shifting consumer demands, and \nthe impact of stricter environmental legislation.5,6 As Leon Wijnands from \nING puts it: “Maintaining business-as-usual might in the end be riskier \nthan transitioning to circular business models. Failure to assess the risks \nand adapt accordingly will cause linear risks to build up in portfolios and \nloan books, potentially leading to significant consequences.”\nFour Sources of Finance\nThe financial services sector and other capital providers can support the cir-\ncular economy by improving access to essential credit, creating innovative \nproducts to provide those funds and providing incentives to encourage busi-\nnesses to implement circular initiatives. The kind of help offered will gener-\nally depend on the type of finance provider:\n•\t Banks and lenders: can provide credit instruments such as bonds or \nloans that link outcomes to the cost of lending: For example, if sustain-\nability performance improves, the net interest rate decreases.

In 2017, for instance, ING issued a \n€1 billion loan to Philips with an interest rate that’s coupled to the client’s \nsustainability performance and rating.7 Italian bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, is \nalso working to provide innovative offerings to clients, launching a €5 bil-\nlion credit facility in 2018 to support businesses adopting circular busi-\nness models.8 Intesa Sanpaolo has also established an innovation center, \nwhich helps fledgling start-ups connect with more than 10,000 investors, \ncompanies, and other players in the innovation ecosystem.9 “Circularity \nmeans de-risking the banking sector, making it more resistant to external \nshocks,” says Massimiano Tellini of Intesa Sanpaolo.\n•\t Commercial investors: may have longer-term investment horizons, \npotentially making them better suited to financing disruptive circu-\nlar businesses. A case in point is Circularity Capital, a specialist private \nequity firm, which invests in small-to-medium-sized circular businesses \nat a critical phase in their development. “We are constantly being told \nhow important it is to have investors who really understand these types \nof business models and also to have the right network to add value to \ninvestee businesses – for example, through business development with \nkey corporates,” notes Jamie Butterworth, Partner at Circularity Capital. \nAnother example is Closed Loop Partners (CLP), which focuses on infra-\nstructure projects that accelerate the development of circular supply \nchains and on catalytic technologies to drive circularity across a range of \nmaterial categories. Since 2015, CLP has invested over $44 million across \n30 initiatives, which has helped to unlock an additional $105 million in \nco-investments.10\n•\t Non-commercial capital providers: such as development institutions \nor private philanthropies can provide co-funding through grants, public \ncapital, or government-backed vehicles that generally have less stringent \nrequirements to generate short- or medium-term returns compared with \nfinancial instruments from commercial investors. Take, for example, the \nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB), the largest multilateral development \nbank that makes long-term financing available for initiatives that con-\ntribute toward EU policy goals. EIB typically finances 30–50% of the \ntotal investment in circular businesses, with the goal of attracting addi-\ntional financing from other public and private sources as the initiatives \nmature. In other words, EIB absorbs the early risks in worthwhile projects \nwith the aim of making them more bankable and attractive to financi-\ners over the long term. Over the last five years, EIB has provided €2.1 \nbillion in co-financing to more than 100 circular projects in a variety of \nareas including water management, agriculture, and the bio-economy.11 \n",

Corporate venturing efforts help \nlarge companies boost innovation and potentially secure early investment \naccess to promising businesses. In some cases, corporate ventures can \nact as an accelerator, providing a platform for start-ups to develop their \noffering and bring it to market.

The Dutch bank’s \npath toward greater ecosystem maturity highlights a few of the steps along \nthat journey.\nIn the emerging stage, ABN AMRO published a circular economy guide in \n2016 that explained basic circular principles and provided a five-step process \nfor preparing a circular business case.16 The company also released a suite of \ntools that would help ease the transition to those new business models.

These guidelines describe the new forms of capital needed and \nexplain the financial fundamentals of circular business models, such as pay-\nper-use payment structures and value creation in second-hand markets. With \nthis information, executives will be better able to select and finance propos-\nals for new businesses based on circular models. The goal is to help accelerate \nthe funding of circular initiatives by providing a useful framework for their \nevaluation.18\nOvercoming Obstacles\nFor a number of reasons, current, or traditional, financing mechanisms and \nsystems are often not well-suited for a transition to the circular economy, for \nexample:\n•\t Banks are typically averse to circular risk, as it is perceived to incur greater \nrisks than conventional or more “proven” investments\n•\t The bond market requires a certain level of business maturity in order to \nscale and have a wider impact on the economy\n•\t Venture capital and private equity favor short payback periods\n•\t Crowdfunding has trouble mobilizing the volume of capital needed for \nasset-intensive circular business models\n•\t Standards to define circular companies, products or initiatives are still \nbeing defined, so investors may struggle to find investable businesses that \nare both financially and environmentally attractive\nBecause of these and other obstacles, the size and prevalence of funding \nfor circular initiatives are still exceptionally small, with only a handful of \nfinancial organizations having distinct circular strategies or programs. As \nKatherine Garrett-Cox, CEO of Gulf International Bank (UK), points out, \n“Circular business models are not yet widely understood within the finan-\ncial services sector, and the traditional corporate finance toolkit has not been \nsufficiently adapted.” Shiva Dustdar, the Head of Innovation Finance in the \n",

Lacy et al.\nAdvisory Services Department at the EIB, confirms the trend, stating that, \n“Five years ago, the term circular economy was barely known in the finan-\ncial services community. For instance, only in the past year or two have we \nseen mainstream financial outlets cover the circular economy as an emerging \ninvestment opportunity.” Although there is still a ways to go to drive the cir-\ncular transition within the financial services industry, there are a number of \nmeasures that can help overcome these challenges.\nOne solution to unlocking more financing is to find partners to max-\nimize the impact of circular propositions, with the added benefit of shar-\ning the risk. That’s the idea behind the Circular Supply Chain Accelerator \n(CiSCA) which ING developed together with Accenture Strategy and \nCircle Economy, all as members of the World Economic Forum’s Platform \nfor Accelerating Circular Economy. CiSCA supports large multinationals \nand their small- and medium-sized suppliers shift to circular business mod-\nels. In 2018, CiSCA announced the first round of the accelerator would \nbe focused on the building and construction sector, given the material and \nenergy intensity of the industry.19 Another example is the Circular Economy \nFramework Loan, the largest credit line (€1 billion) for circular initiatives in \nEurope and the first of its kind in the Italian market.20 Through the collabo-\nration, Intesa Sanpaolo and EIB have been able to provide new resources to \nmid-cap companies and innovative SMEs, with a particular focus on invest-\nments in projects related to the circular economy in the manufacturing, agri-\nculture, energy, and waste management sectors.20\nAnother obstacle to overcome is the way in which financial institutions \nassess circular initiatives: Traditional financial measures are used to evaluate \nthe new types of business models because of a lack of an appropriate frame-\nwork. But those conventional measures overlook various important factors, \nsuch as the environmental and social benefits of a circular initiative and the \ndifferent ways in which value is generated. For example, circular business \nmodels could be regarded as highly risky based on traditional financial risk \nmodels, due to their limited track record, novel product offerings, or new \nways of serving consumers. Financial risk modeling will need to adapt to \nappropriately evaluate the residual value of assets that are plugged back into \nthe value chain and other benefits such as the higher customer retention of \nservice-oriented businesses. It is also important for financial institutions to \nfactor in the risks of linear models in an increasingly resource-scarce world.\n“The financial services sector needs to develop better risk assessment \nand valuation models in order to be able to assess correctly the risks and \nopportunities associated with circular business models.

There is a need to develop new approaches to meas-\nuring and monitoring initiatives within the circular economy. A common \ntaxonomy helps ensure investors and investees speak a common language,” \nemphasizes Katherine Garrett-Cox of Gulf International Bank (UK). The \nguidelines developed by ING, ABN AMRO, and others that were men-\ntioned earlier provide a good first step in that direction, but much more \nwork is needed.\nIt’s also important to note here that, although the current risk models and \nfinancial approaches tend to be conservative, multinational companies have \ntremendous potential to effect changes to these models and approaches and \ninfluence the sectoral shift. After all, these large corporations are the major \nclients of financial institutions. They can work to educate their financial ser-\nvices providers on the benefits of the circular economy and collaborate to \ndevelop the appropriate financial instruments. As a way to seize this oppor-\ntunity, in February 2018, Danone amended its €2 billion syndicated credit \nfacility in order to integrate environmental and social criteria into the mar-\ngin payable to its banks.21 The criteria are based on the scores provided by \ntwo independent ESG agencies as well as the percentage of Danone’s consol-\nidated sales covered by B Corp certification. The project was supported by \nBNP Paribas, a French international banking group acting as the sustaina-\nbility coordinator for a pool of relationship banks.22 BNP Paribas has devel-\noped this concept further by launching additional Positive Incentive Loan \nschemes with Solvay, L&Q, Thames Water, and Deutsche Börse Group, in \nthe latter case financing a €750 million credit consortium in partnership \nwith Commerzbank.23\n  Chapter Takeaways\n•\t By investing in circular initiatives, financial services companies can gain com-\npetitive advantage in three important ways: achieving growth; differentiat-\ning from competitors; and securing license to operate and risk mitigation.\n•\t New types of financial metrics and instruments are needed to properly eval-\nuate and fund circular initiatives. Financial institutions should find better \nways to evaluate risk and use blended financial models to mitigate risk.\n•\t Banks and lenders should collaborate with their clients to help them \ndevelop the business case for circular projects and better identify and quan-\ntify costs and benefits.\n",

In addition to developing, \nconsidering, and instituting policy measures and channeling public invest-\nment toward a circular economy, they can activate other actors to develop \nand scale circular economy practices which are beneficial to businesses and \nsocieties. To deploy that power in constructive ways, public policies should \ncreate a conducive environment for companies to develop and scale circular \nbusiness models, with the ultimate goal of enabling citizens to thrive in a \nhealthier, prosperous, and more equitable society. According to Erika Chan \nfrom Dell, a multinational technology company, “Policymakers have a sig-\nnificant role to play in driving the development of the circular economy.

Best practice pilots or initiatives, such \nas creation of zero waste city pilots or circular industrial parks, are then \nneeded locally to bring these policies to life and demonstrate the advan-\ntages of going circular.”\nRegulations and bans are used to address waste management and resource \nuse practices with direct negative effect on the environment, human health, \nand/or the economy. Some of the first environmental policies involved the \nbanning or regulation of harmful chemicals (e.g., certain pesticides), and \nrecently the approach has been used to address waste problems, most promi-\nnently plastics waste.\n•\t Regulations prescribing the handling and disposal of hazardous waste \nare common. In the United States, electronics that are hazardous must \nfollow the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and be managed \naccordingly. In Chin a, which generates the highest e-waste quantity \nglobally (7.2 million tons), national laws regulate the collection and \ntreatment of TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, and \ncomputers. However, informal waste-processing practices and illegal dis-\nposal are highly lucrative and continue to play an important role in the \nmanagement of electronic waste in China, despite increased government \nattention.4\n•\t Policymakers and regulators around the world have been introducing \nbans on the use of different types of plastic products, reacting to grow-\ning concern about plastics waste. Bans of different types of plastics prod-\nucts, mostly single-use items like shopping bags or cutlery, have been \nannounced or are in place in the majority of African countries, the \nEuropean Union, all major Asian countries, and numerous US states and \ncities, among others.\n•\t For developing countries, a major issue has been the illegal dumping \nof plastic waste. China’s withdrawal as the world’s repository for plas-\ntic waste has thrown global markets into turmoil, resulting in a surge of \nimported plastic trash to Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. \nMalaysia, for one, has recently introduced regulations to curb the import \nof plastic waste, and other countries could soon follow suit.5\n",

They have evolved to \nset requirements on the minimal levels of sustainable content (e.g., recycled \ncontent) and performance (e.g., energy efficiency).\n•\t The EU Eco-design Directive (Directive 2009/125/EC) provides \nEU-wide rules for improving the environmental performance of products. \nIt sets minimum mandatory requirements especially in terms of energy \nuse. The goal is to eliminate poor-performing products from the market \nand stimulate industrial competitiveness and innovation.6\n•\t California is one of the first jurisdictions using product standards for \nrecycled content. The Rigid Plastic Packaging Container Law, which was \nenacted to help decrease the amount of plastics thrown into California’s \nlandfills, stipulates that plastic containers need to be made from at least \n25% recycled materials.7 The state has also introduced recycled content \nrequirements for plastic bags.\n•\t Members of the G7 Oceans Plastic Charter have adopted an aspirational \ngoal of “working with industry towards increasing recycled content by at \nleast 50% in plastic products” by 2030.8\nTaxes and incentives are used to price practices that are harmful (waste \ngeneration, unsustainable waste disposal, etc.) and reward practices that are \nbeneficial.\n•\t Incentives include subsidies for investment in circular economy solutions \nor for their use, as well as tax benefits, such as the UK Capital Allowances \nscheme, which allows for accelerated depreciation of investments in \nenergy-saving systems.9 In Sweden, there is a reduced value-added tax \n(VAT) rate for repair shops, for instance.10\n•\t Taxation or pricing of negative effects of practices or products involves \nmaking polluters pay for the harmful effects of their activities. Examples \ninclude waste disposal fees, direct taxation of waste generation (for \ninstance, through a plastic bag levy), and a carbon tax. By assigning a \nprice to carbon through a market or tax, governments seek to encourage \nlow-carbon solutions. Similarly, France has recently introduced a penalty \nsystem that taxes non-recycled packaging material.11 The revenues raised \nby taxing harmful practices can then be used to invest in infrastructure or \nto provide subsidies for solutions.\n",

The costs of negative environmental impacts, so-called externali-\nties, have traditionally not been included in the price of products and services, \nand this has been a significant barrier to the progress of the circular economy.\nIn recent years, leading circular businesses have become strong advocates of \nintegrating the costs of negative environmental impacts, for instance, calling for \ngovernments to put a price on carbon emissions. This would strengthen their \ncase for investing in emissions reduction measures in their business and stimulate \nconsumers to choose their low-carbon products over alternatives. “With pricing \nexternalities, the value of the secondary market will be even higher, because con-\nsumers will realize the real value of products and the remaining value after end-\nof-life,” says John Atcheson of Stuffstr, a recirculation platform company.\nPricing externalities would also help provide a more accurate picture of the \nenvironmental costs involved. When considering the water pollution caused \nby the traditional dyeing process in the textile industry, DyeCoo, a supplier of \nindustrial CO2 dyeing equipment, believes that policies that make businesses \npay the price of pollution would result in circular processes becoming more \nfavorable. “Once legislation is enforced where companies have to purify their \nwastewater to a higher level and pay for pollution, then circular solutions will \nbecome cost competitive,” asserts Reinier Mommaal, Co-Founder of DyeCoo.\n•\t Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies are a comprehensive \npolicy approach for waste management and recycling through pricing \nand rewards. EU member states have introduced EPR schemes to regu-\nlate the collection, recycling, and recovery of e-waste, as specified by the \nWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive.12 The \n2018 Revised Waste legislations also introduced minimum requirements \nfor EPR schemes. Under these policies, businesses are responsible for \nbearing the costs of collecting e-waste, but fees can be used to stimulate \nthe return of electronics products at end of use. French consumers, for \ninstance, must pay an “eco-fee” when they purchase a new electrical or \nelectronic appliance.13 That fee is then paid to a takeback organization \n(accredited by the government) that recovers used appliances to decon-\ntaminate and recycle them. EPR policies have become increasingly com-\nmon around the world. India has been a pioneer of EPR in Asia, and \nEPR schemes are under discussion in China, with the aim to introduce \nthese in 2025 for electronics, automobiles, lead–acid batteries, and pack-\ning products.14,15 In Latin America, Chile was the first country to intro-\nduce an EPR scheme in 2016, and now 10 countries in the region have \nEPR policies in place.16 Countries that have introduced EPR policies \nhave generally seen recycling rates rise, provided that the fees are sufficient \n",

Most \ncountries have policies to stimulate recycling, but rates have thus far \nbeen low and the quality of material poor. In the EU, 23% of munici-\npal waste was still sent to a landfill in 2017, and in seven member states \nit exceeds 60%.18 EU Member States will have to increase targets for \nreuse and recycling of municipal waste from 55% by 2025 to 65% by \n2035. In other countries, landfilling rates are typically above 50%. Lack \nof infrastructure and capacity are key challenges for increasing recycling, \nespecially for waste separation, collection, and sorting systems. Waste \nseparation is most effective when done at the source, that is, by the pub-\nlic, which is why government policies focus on consumer awareness and \neducation to ensure that incentives in the collection process (fines and \nreverse collection) can be effective. New technologies, such as autono-\nmous robots, offer enormous potential for improving waste sorting. \nPolicymakers can invest in R&D to accelerate the development of these \ntechnologies and offer financial benefits to stimulate their deployment.\n•\t Developing countries, in particular, suffer from limitations in waste collection \nand treatment infrastructure and capacity. Problems include underfunding so \nthat waste collection only reaches part of the population, a lack of disposal \ninfrastructure that leads to illegal dumping activity, and insufficient capacity \nto enforce legislation and collect waste fees that, in turn, exacerbate shortages \nin funding. The World Bank has helped finance projects for strengthening \nwaste management infrastructures and capacities around the world, working \nwith local governments and international partners. This includes investments \nin the rehabilitation of existing waste disposal sites (e.g., in Indonesia, Bosnia \nHerzegovina, and Azerbaijan), projects for increasing consumer awareness \nand engagement (e.g., in Morocco, Jamaica, and China), and investments in \nwaste collection capabilities (e.g., in Nepal and Liberia).19\n•\t Use of recycled materials can only improve when manufacturers have \nreliable data about the composition and quality of these materials. This \nrequires investment in a digital infrastructure for collecting and tracking \nthe relevant data. In the United States, the Environmental Protection \nAgency has recently set up a national system to track hazardous waste \nshipments, and this new “e-manifest” will affect companies across all \n",

They will \nno longer be businesses at the end of the value chain managing one-way dis-\nposal; they will become players connecting the value chain’s beginning and end, \nresponsible for upgrading resource streams and finding the highest value of \nrecycled materials. Governments can support this closing of the loop by incen-\ntivizing or contributing to investment in infrastructures for reverse logistics.\nCollaboration and cross-sector partnerships can be facilitated by govern-\nments to stimulate comprehensive circular solutions across the value chain.\n•\t Along with initiating policy, governments can play a key role to help stim-\nulate and coordinate action by businesses and other groups. Their power \nand perspective make them ideally placed to convene players from differ-\nent sectors to encourage comprehensive solutions. When policymakers are \nengaged in business partnerships, they can more readily address regulatory \nbarriers that prevent new partnerships and practices. On a local level, gov-\nernments can stimulate cross-sector collaboration and industrial symbiosis \nin business parks and industry centers. China, for instance, operates multi-\nple certified industrial parks that use the principles of circular economy—\nprimarily reusing and recycling common materials including plastics—in \nmanaging their supply chains. The country’s 13th Five-Year Plan aims for \nover 75% of national industrial parks and more than 50 provincial indus-\ntrial parks to be practicing complete circular strategies by 2020.2 Similarly, \nin country Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and Special Economic Zones \n(SEZs) can be restructured as centers of excellence for developing, testing, \nand scaling circular solutions, increasing the appeal of such zones for mul-\ntinational companies and their suppliers.\n•\t Governments also need to address barriers that prevent companies from \ndeveloping joint circular business practices. Competition regulation can \ndiscourage collaboration, especially for businesses operating in the same \nsector. Policymakers can remove such obstacles by defining the conditions \nunder which cooperation is allowed, thereby ensuring both fair compe-\ntition and consumer protections. Arrangements for data sharing and \nintellectual property present additional hurdles for any type of ecosystem \ninnovation. Companies are more likely to enter innovation partnerships \n",

Lacy et al.\n  AFRICA: building up waste management capacity, while addressing \ndirect negative impacts of plastics and electronic waste to the environment and \nhuman health\n•\t Many African countries have waste laws in place, generally prescrib-\ning collection and treatment of waste, and sometimes setting targets for \nrecycling. Implementation and enforcement are often difficult, however, \ndue to a lack of resources and capacity at the local government level. \nCountries have therefore introduced mechanisms to finance the formal \nwaste sectors through waste management fees or taxes. Additionally, they \nare building capacity by integrating informal waste workers into the for-\nmal waste management system. Morocco, for example, has worked with \nthe World Bank to formalize the roles of 20,000 waste workers.26\n•\t African countries have led the way in addressing plastic waste; more than \n30 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have either banned plastic bags or \nimposed taxes on their use. As one of the most extreme examples, Kenya’s \nban includes possible jail time or a hefty fine.27\n•\t African countries have long been a destination for discarded hazard-\nous electronics, often resulting in harm to the environment and human \nhealth, as open dumping, burning, and landfilling are the predominant \ndisposal methods being used. The Bamako Convention (1998) aimed to \naddress this by banning the import of hazardous and radioactive waste \ninto Africa from other countries. But the dumping of e-waste is still \noccurring because of a lack of follow-up at the national level. An investi-\ngation by the Basel Action Network suggests that hundreds of metric tons \nof electronic waste from European countries are still being exported to \ndeveloping countries each year, despite European regulation banning the \npractice.28\n•\t Recent years have seen the emergence of supranational initiatives for \ndriving economic development through the circular economy. Rwanda, \nSouth Africa, and Nigeria, for instance, are working with the United \nNations (UN) Environment Program and the World Economic Forum \nto develop a continent-wide alliance to spur Africa’s transformation to a \ncircular economy, with a focus on e-waste.29 As Peter Desmond, Founder \nof the African Circular Economy Network, emphasizes, “The implemen-\ntation of circular policies in Africa has the potential to open up a better \ndevelopment path, building on the defining characteristics of resilience \nand resourcefulness, and enabling Africa to leapfrog to a sustainable, equi-\ntable, prosperous and circular economy.”\n",

A framework was provided for the environ-\nmental management of products, including voluntary, co-regulatory, and \nmandatory stewardship.30\n•\t New Zealand has established accelerator programs and funds for ini-\ntiatives that will spur the country’s circular transition. The Waste \nMinimisation Fund supports projects that promote or achieve waste min-\nimization, resource efficiency, reuse, recovery, and recycling.31\n•\t New Zealand has issued a nationwide ban on single-use plastic bags, start-\ning in July 2019. Similarly, single-use plastic bags of certain thicknesses \nhave been banned in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, \nTasmania, ACT, and the NT, with Victoria set to follow in November \n2019.32,33\n  NORTH AMERICA: establishing state and regional leadership in public– \nprivate circular collaborations\n•\t In Canada, circular economy policy is created at the provincial and local \nlevel. Ontario initiated a “Strategy for a Waste Free Ontario: Building the \nCircular Economy” in 2015, and multiple provinces have adopted recy-\ncling targets.34 The City of Toronto aims to achieve zero waste, starting \nwith diverting 70% of waste produced from landfill, as set out in its 2016 \nLong Term Waste Management Strategy.35\n•\t Canada is a frontrunner in promoting public–private circular partner-\nships, such as the Circular Economy Lab.36 In addition, the National \nZero Waste Council has been bringing together governments, businesses, \nand NGOs to advance waste prevention.37\n•\t In the United States, circularity is gaining traction in the business com-\nmunity, with strong momentum in supporting the circular economy at \nthe state and local level.38 More than 20 states have introduced EPR reg-\nulations for electronic waste, and states like California, Colorado, and \nWashington have set targets for waste minimization and resource effi-\nciency. New York City is committed to becoming a worldwide leader in \nsolid-waste management by achieving the goal of zero waste by 2030.39\n",

    "chunk_full": "22  Ecosystem Deep Dive #2: Policy—The Role of Policymakers        323\nWhat’s Next for Policymakers\nAlthough new and updated policies and regulations have encouraged the \nadoption of circular business models, this in turn has led to a range of new \npolicy questions. As we move forward, policymakers should address the fol-\nlowing five areas:\n•\t Waste definitions. Waste regulation typically defines when materials are \nconsidered waste, secondary material, or by-product. These classifications \ndetermine the value of a material, as well as whether it can be exported. \nFor instance, discarded electronic equipment classified as waste may face \nexport limitations, even if it could serve as a source of secondary mate-\nrial abroad. To address such barriers, policymakers should review all waste \nclassifications and restrictions in light of the new circular economy policy \ntargets and latest technological possibilities.\n•\t Application of material use and waste hierarchies. Policymakers should \nsteer regulations toward practices that yield the highest value use of scarce \nmaterials and waste. Consistent application of priority frameworks, like \nthe waste hierarchy of “reduce, reuse, repair, recycle, recover, dispose,” \nwill help ensure coherent policy measures and settle potential conflicts \nbetween policy objectives (e.g., between circular economy objectives and \nclimate policy).\n•\t Taxation changes to incentivize circular behavior. Existing taxation \ndesigned to achieve other objectives (e.g., job creation or economic growth) \nmay discourage the efficient use of resources. Policymakers should thus \nreview the impacts of taxation on resource efficiency and, when possi-\nble, consider shifting taxation toward resource use. To prevent the total \ntax burden from rising, increases in taxes on the use of materials can be \naccompanied by reductions in the taxation of labor, stimulating new, cir-\ncular activities that create jobs and contribute to more inclusive economic \ngrowth.\n•\t Product quality and safety regulation. These types of regulations typ-\nically place limits on how products can be used after disposal. They can \nrestrict secondary use altogether (e.g., donations of food waste even when \nstill edible) or decrease the value of the secondary product. Policymakers \ncan reduce this barrier by clarifying when secondary resources can be used \nwhile also continuing to guarantee quality and safety. The presence of \nhazardous chemicals is an area of particular concern, and it is important \n",

Lacy et al.\nthat policymakers and regulators take a prudent approach to reviewing \nthe applicability of product safety regulations to recycled material, espe-\ncially those that contain hazardous substances.\n•\t Infrastructure investment. One of the biggest challenges we hear from \nlocal businesses is the lack of infrastructure for collection, sorting, recy-\ncling, composting, and so on. It remains critical to free up and direct \nfunds to develop, strengthen, and expand waste infrastructure, and new \ninfrastructure is needed so that recovered and recycled materials can be \nintegrated back into production processes. As policymakers recognize the \npotential of the circular economy for development and economic growth, \nthey should take a more active role in prioritizing and facilitating invest-\nment in circular economy infrastructure, as they would for other critical \ninfrastructure.\nGiven the continual innovation in circular initiatives, additional changes \nin government regulations and laws will more than likely be needed in the \nfuture. To spur continued growth of the circular economy, businesses should \ncontinually engage with policymakers, and help identify gaps and barriers \nin current legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as share information \nabout the potential and implications of new circular economy practices and \nsolutions.\n  Chapter Takeaways\n•\t Governments have a crucial role in accelerating the transition to a circular \neconomy through policy measures and public investment and by convening \nother actors to develop and scale circular practices.\n•\t Policies for accelerating the circular economy should start with a vision and \nclear targets, supported by a mix of measures involving regulation, financ-\ning and taxation, public investment, and actions to facilitate cooperation.\n•\t The circular economy is on the agenda of policymakers around the world, \nbut the implementation and effectiveness of circular economy policies vary \nacross regions.\n•\t To facilitate circular initiatives, policymakers should address the following \nfive areas: waste definitions, waste hierarchies, taxation, product quality \nand safety, and infrastructure investment.\n",

This has \ninvolved six steps:\n1.\t\u0007Forecast global population and global GDP\nThe model is predicated on understanding the potential impact of resource \nimbalances to future GDP. This requires a Global GDP forecast to 2050, \nbased on three things:\n\t i.\t \u0007OECD historical data and projections of global population,1\n\tii.\t \u0007Historical GDP (at USD 1990 PPP) from Total Economy Database,2\n\tiii.\t \u0007Projected GDP (converted to USD 1990 PPP) based OECD and \nHSBC forecasts.3,4\nThis provides a consistent view of Global GDP and GDP per capita from \n1970 to 2050.\n",

This is based on a dataset collected by the \nUN Environment Programme that tracks Domestic Material Consumption \n(DMC) across four categories of materials (measured in metric tonnes):\n•\t Biomass,\n•\t Fossil energy carriers,\n•\t Ores and industrial minerals,\n•\t Construction minerals.\nIn 1970, the world consumed a total of 26.54 bn tonnes of materials. By \n2017, that total had risen to 41.66 bn tonnes.\nUsing this data, it is possible to determine the relationship between DMC \nand GDP as a ratio. For every ton of material extracted, how much GDP is \ngenerated? As technology improves, humanity has become more efficient at \nextracting value from resources. In 1970, 1.95 kg of materials were required \nper dollar of GDP. By 2017, that ratio had dropped to 1.08 kg per dollar.\n3.\t\u0007Forecast resource demand\nHistorical data illustrates the rate of improvement in this material input to \neconomic output ratio. The model calculates these rates of change for each \nof the four material categories on decade-by-decade bases, weights the rate \nof change in favor of more recent decades, and determines four potential \nscenarios:\na.\t\u0007No change: This assumes that the ability to improve how much value can \nbe extracted from a single unit has peaked and that there will be no addi-\ntional improvements.\nb.\t\u0007Baseline: The improvement in the input/output ratio will continue at the \nhistorical weighted average.\nc.\t\u0007Pessimistic: The improvement in the input/output ratio will continue, \nbut at lowest end of the range of historical weighted averages.\nd.\t\u0007Optimistic: The improvement in the input/output ratio will continue, \nbut at highest end of the range of historical weighted averages.\n",

This is because these \nresources, such as sand, are abundantly available and therefore not subject to \nthe same scarcity dynamics.\n4.\t\u0007Forecast resource supply\nHaving understood historical and project resource demand, the next step \nwas to determine the availability of resources. This was done in a top-down \nfashion, based on three core elements:\n\t i.\t \u0007Biocapacity: An estimate by the Global Footprint Network of the total \nnumber of hectares of productive land the world has. This is currently \n12.2bn hectares. The model assumes that number is fixed until 2050.5\n\tii.\t \u0007Footprint: The Global Footprint Network also estimates the hectares \nthat current human activity requires per year.6\n\tiii.\t \u0007Footprint Intensity: Finally, it is possible to convert footprint (in hec-\ntares) into “DMC allowance” (in tonnes) through understanding the \nhistorical footprint intensity ratio. This determines how many hectares \nwere required to support one tonne of material consumption. In 1970, \nthis figure was 0.55 hectares per tonne. By 2014 (last available date), it \nwas 0.43 hectares per tonne.\nWith these three elements, it is possible to project future resource supply. \nThis requires two further critical sets of assumptions.\nThe first is that the world will eventually need to return to a state in which \nannual ecological footprint does not exceed biocapacity. This is referred \nto as a being a “one-planet economy.” Today, ecological footprint is \n",

The model assumes, in line with \nall UN agencies, that the point of parity must be reached by 2050. It also \nassumes there will need to be a transitionary period. This is modeled as a \nlinear progression from 1.7× to 1.0× in two stages. By 2030, the world \nwill be 20% of the way to the target, and by 2050, it will have achieved \nthe goal.\nThe second key component is forecasted footprint intensity. Again, this is \ndone using scenarios. The baseline scenario assumes that the improvements \nin the hectares to tonnes ratio continue based on weighted average historical \nrate of change (0.6% per annum). The high and low scenarios rely on data \nfrom the IPCC. These projections of global CO2 emission can be used to \ncreate a view of emissions per tonne of DMC per capita. The pessimistic sce-\nnario (RCP 2) assumes no improvement in the ratio whereas the optimistic \nscenario (RCP 1) assumes a rapid improvement (1.5% per annum).\nGiven all five of these components, it is possible to understand global \nresource supply (or allowance) based on each of the scenario (defined in sec-\ntion #3 above). This can be expressed in billions of tonnes. The result for \neach scenario is:\nScenario\nTotal resource allowance (bn tonnes 2030)\nNo change\n48.4\nBaseline\n44.3\nPessimistic\n42.4\nOptimistic\n53.5\n5.\t\u0007Determine resource imbalance\nHaving computed the total resource demand (implied by GDP) and the \ntotal resource allowance (implied by a transition to a “one-planet econ-\nomy”), it is possible to determine the total resource imbalance for each sce-\nnario in any given year. This analysis looks at 2030 as the target year. Once \nthe total demand figures are discounted due to the abundance of construc-\ntion materials, the supply imbalance implied for each scenario is as follows:\nScenario\nTotal resource allowance (bn tonnes 2030)\nNo Change\n24.1\nBaseline\n7.0\nPessimistic\n18.7\nOptimistic\nNil\n",

To do this, the model uses the production function produced by the \nWorld Bank and determines the per unit change in GDP per unit change of \nresources.7 This is done at four key thresholds:\nReduction in resources of (%)\nPer unit change in GDP (%)\n<20\n−0.33\n20–50\n−0.37\n50–75\n−0.43\n75–92\n−0.55\nThese multipliers have been applied to each scenario to produce an estimate \nof total impact on world GDP (in % terms) in 2030 and the corresponding \nUSD$ value.\nFinally, a weighted average of the two most likely scenarios (baseline and \noptimistic) was taken to find a single overall estimate. Given the significant \ntechnological and societal changes required to deliver the optimistic sce-\nnario, it is weighted at a 10% likelihood. This is in line with the upper end \nof IPCC estimates.\nLimitations\n•\t This assessment is entirely reliant on the assumption that humanity must \nstop unsustainably consuming resources.\n•\t While this position can be rationalized, it is important to recognize that \nit would also represent a marked change from the historical trend of \never-increasing annual consumption.\n•\t It is also not likely that this change will be necessitated by physical scar-\ncity in most cases and will, instead, need to be driven by changing social, \npolitical, and regulatory expectation.\n•\t This is a top-down analysis, focusing on the relationship between GDP \nand resource consumption, and it does not attempt to examine the cur-\nrent or future contribution of the circular economy to economic output.\n•\t It does not have any direct relationship to any of the models performed \nelsewhere in The Circular Economy Handbook (e.g., industry-level oppor-\ntunity assessments).\n•\t No assessment has been made of the maturity of circular economy tech-\nnologies or business models or their readiness to address this future gap in \nGDP growth.\n",

This makes the decision to revise and update\nthis volume quite obvious but also necessary. In the world of commodities and\nmaterials, the end of the credit expansion which fuelled the huge development\nof infrastructure and real estate in China from 2009-2012 has tailed off. The\ndecline in prices that followed, illustrates the widespread expectation of\nvolatility. It was time to update some graphs and commentary. The sustained\ndrop in prices did not result in a significant rebound in economic growth,\nsome further reflection was necessary. It seems the world has entered a period\nwhere there is a strong possibility of continuing stagnation, despite the very\nlarge monetary stimulus provided since 2008. Perhaps the idea of a circular\neconomy, writ large, is needed more than ever.\n\nWhatever the possibilities, it has become clear that the impetus towards this\ntransition will be translated and enabled by the rapid convergence of\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT). Some examples stand out. In\n2013 there was hardly any expectation of autonomous cars making the streets\ncommercially for some considerable time, but ‘robotaxis’ have entered service\nin Pittsburgh and Singapore, and with them a re-imagination of mobility. The\nflip side, however, is employment. Digital has the potential to remove labour\nor further casualise it, perhaps both. This further aggravates the challenges\nof creating lasting prosperity.\n\nWhat are the implications for business? This ICT revolution makes the feedback\nloops of the circular economy sing with potential, as we are able to\nincreasingly track products, their operation, and make assets accessible. This\nrevised volume therefore contains one entirely new chapter, expanding on the\nrole of digital; on how we see the world; how the economy really works and how\nwe can act within it. There is an important symmetry here. The other major\nrevision is in rewriting the final chapter, as it becomes obvious that current\nsocial tensions and the rise of populist political parties means that the\nevolution of an attractive economic model, one which is both practical and\nstarts from a different worldview, is no longer just a desirable development,\nbut a matter of some urgency if we are to hold onto both democracy and the\nmeans of widespread prosperity.\n\nI hope that this book will be part of the debate.\n\nKen Webster\n\nCowes, Oct 2016\n\nForeword\n\n“What is our goal?” was the question I asked myself a lot in the period\nbuilding up to the creation of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. There was so\nmuch out there, but so much was about efficiency and buying ourselves time.\nDeep inside I had an uneasy feeling that incremental change wasn’t going to\nwork in an economy which was driven by using resources in a linear way.\n\nI repeatedly felt like something wasn’t right as I could only see part of the\npicture – that was until I met Ken Webster. Over 20 years he had been\ncarefully inserting the pieces in the puzzle to build it until he understood\nit, reaching the point where he could see the economy running as a system. My\ninquisitive mind found immediate answers and great excitement in his work.\nHe’d connected complementary schools of thought and shaped a coherent\nframework which, when applied to the economy, provided a sense of direction.\n\nIt was perhaps no surprise that just weeks after our first meeting Ken joined\nthe original small team with which we launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\nThe Circular Economy: a Wealth of Flows elaborates on the fundamental ideas\nthat structure the circular economy and helps define the concept of a\nregenerative model, able to decouple economic development from the consumption\nof finite resources.\n\nCrucially, Ken’s understanding of framing and his ability to consistently\nrefer to the ‘big picture’ allows him to break down silos and to provide a\ncomprehensive narrative that addresses a variety of issues including societal\nimplications, the role of finance, regenerative agriculture and education – to\nname but a few.\n\nThe circular economy gives us the opportunity to build a system that can run\nin the long term, and the time is right for it to reach scale, Ken’s book\nargues… Big ideas don’t simply pop up in a vacuum, and when real system-\nchanging perspectives meet the right context, the resulting wave of\ntransformation can seldom be resisted.\n\nEllen MacArthur\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n“ Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But since no one was\nlistening, everything must be said again.”  \n\nAndré Gide\n\n![](image92.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“When you run out of red , use blue! ”\n\nPablo Picasso\n\nPower, it is said, resides in the creation and maintenance of scarcity. The\nstudy of scarcity apparently belongs to economics, which claims that\nhumankind’s wants are limitless and its resources finite. It seems there will\nalways be disappointment.\n\nMainstream Economics 101 assumes we are selfish, perfectly calculating about\nour wants, and rational decision makers. To the best operators go the prizes,\nit’s a competitive world out there and markets – places and spaces where\nbuyers and sellers meet and prices are determined – provide the best mechanism\nfor allocating resources. Through the operation of markets the most efficient\noutcome – the lowest cost and best value – can be enjoyed all round. It\ncreates just enough surplus which in turn allows for new investment and\neconomic growth. An individual’s choices benefit the economy as a whole: self-\ninterest becomes the general interest. And that which may be placed outside\nthe market, like forms of welfare, education and infrastructure, can then be\nafforded.\n\nAs a palliative to the story of disappointment is the story of economic growth\nwhich paradoxically is assumed to be limitless, based on new technologies, new\nsources of cheap energy and disruptive innovation, thus offering a promise of\nbetter times for all. ‘A rising tide floats all boats’, it is said,\n‘eventually’. It sounds so much better than wealth ‘trickling down’.\n\nIn a roundabout way this caricature of an economy and of how humans really\nmake decisions sort of worked as a story. For 150 years, from around 1830,\nrising living standards inthe West, decade upon decade, showed the broad\nbenefits of what is very much an economic machine which takes in resources,\nespecially cheap energy and materials, and uses them to create and feed a mass\nproduction and consumption (and throwaway) society.\n\nA linear economy, with its kickstarting money cycle, is massively wasteful of\nboth raw materials and finished products. Elements and consequences outside\nthe money-valued cycle are costs loaded onto the environment and society at\nlarge. The solution to this downside is the idea that increasing economic\ngrowth would allow enough surplus to clean up the mess and heal the sick – the\ncure was hiding inside the problem. Like medicine, economic growth might taste\na bit rough but the outcome is, apparently, admirable.\n\nThis general story is very much still current. Since many in developed\ncountries would like to extend a modern world to those not yet benefitting, it\nmight seem mischievous to suggest another story, but this book is based on\nexactly that. Imagine the economy as circular, a place where ‘roundput’ not\n‘throughput’ dominates, where everything is food for the cycles of materials,\nwhere resources are used but not used up, where the feedback – it is built on\nfeedback – restores capital and enables additional flows of goods and\nservices. In such a circular economy money and finance, a key information\nflow, is constantly recirculated and reaches all parts of the economy to\nfacilitate exchange. It is a better story because it engages with the changing\nfacts on the ground – the exhaustion of cheap energy, easy-to-get minerals,\nmaterials and productive credit.\n\nIt also closely reflects recent trends and developments in scientific\nthinking. The economy, we are told by the likes of Paul Ormerod1 and Eric\nBeinhocker,2 is a complex adaptive system – much more a metabolism than a\nmachine. It is also a story about the possibilities of abundance, of meeting\npeople’s needs by designing out waste and recreating the kind of elegant\nabundance so evident in living systems. That is economic growth, but not as we\ndefine it today. It has much more in it about a quality of life than mere\nthroughput; it’s the connections, the relationships not the stuff that is the\nfocus.\n\n![simpleComplex](image112.jpg)\n\nThe 21st century is yielding a second Enlightenment. The narrative it offers\nabout what makes us tick, individually and collectively, is infinitely more\nsophisticated than we previously thought. Across many fields the above changes\nhave occurred since the 1960s.\n\nAdapted from Hanauer and Liu 3  \n\nThe reasoning is practical at its heart: that the constellation of factors\nwhich made a linear throughput economy so successful, for so many and for so\nlong (at considerable cost to others and the general fabric of the environment\nit has to be said) has shifted. It’s simply not doing what it has hitherto\nalways promised. To add to this, science has indeed moved on a long way from\nthe mechanistic discipline that historically has informed a mechanistic view\nof economics and of the way humans think and behave. The assumptions\nunderlying the old narrative have begun to fall away as well.\n\nThe old story increasingly doesn’t work and it’s no longer a convincing\nnarrative.  \n\nSome people really do not care for narratives, or philosophy. Perhaps they do\nnot think they are affected by them. As practical people they want to work\nwhatever system is in place, to look for the business opportunity. The\ncircular economy can be approached that way since a combination of factors:\ndigital disruption, resource and energy transformations and changing\ndemographics all suggest change, the point being that it does not necessarily\ntake a shift in values to get involved. It just makes more sense all round if\nthe basic ideas, the practical action and the system conditions, the\nregulatory and fiscal structures are pointing in the same direction. In his\nrecent book Reinventing Fire – a sophisticated approach to moving away from a\nfossil fuel-dominated economy4 – Amory Lovins claims that:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n“ Whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or\nnational security, or environmental stewardship and climate protection and\npublic health, Reinventing Fire makes sense and makes money. ”\n\nAmory Lovins is the founder of Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in Colorado,\nUSA. He is keen on the abundance theme and has even trade-marked ‘Abundance by\nDesign’. A major point in Reinventing Fire is that a shift to optimising the\nwhole system, rather than focus ing on a part, brings a series of reinforcing\nbenefits – a spiral or ‘upcycle’ as William McDonough and Michael Braungart\nsay.\n\nIn Natural Capitalism ,5 Amory Lovins, Hunter Lovins and Paul Hawken explore\nhow this abundance can be built by implementing four reinforcing shifts, not\njust one, but all four, to create a positive cycle. In this book all four are\nlikewise considered part of a circular economy.\n\nShift 1: implement resource efficiency – actually ‘radical resource\nefficiency’ not the few per cent kind from the picking of a few low-hanging\nfruits around the business.\n\nResource efficiency is a big favourite, as we shall see: design to recover\nmaterials; design for disassembly; design for cleaner material flows and\nshared standards; and design for remanufacturing. They can all cut energy use,\nmaintain product quality and cut waste.  \n\nBut the other three shifts are needed too, if the aim is a win-win ‘upcycle’.\nThis sense of the whole system being optimised sets a circular economy aside\nfrom a lot of waste minimisation approaches which do not question the\nthroughput character of the economy and just seek to ameliorate its effects\nand carve out a little extra on the bottom line. Simple recycling for example\ndoes not challenge a throughput economy because it is always an incomplete\nloop where leakage is very high, especially for low value, short cycle items.\nEven 90% recycling for a product such as aluminium cans means losses are\nquickly compounded if the cycle is a few weeks or months from foundry to\nrecycling bin.\n\n![WhyResourceBox](image133.jpg)\n\nShift 2: move to biomimetic modes of production. Use the ‘everything is food’\nnotion to redesign, and design out waste. Some commentators like Janine Benyus\nadvance an overall shift to a largely ‘bio based’ materials economy, using\nliving systems as ‘model, mentor and measure’.\n\nShift 3: move to providing services rather than goods. There are various\nelements to this – the performance economy, other product-service systems and\nmore recently the explosion of interest in how information technology can\nfurnish access to products and assets for short periods of time with low\ntransaction costs. ZipCar, Lyft and AirBnB are examples.\n\nShift 4: reinvest in natural capital. To create additional flows of materials\nand energy from rebuilt or restored/maintained capital stocks over time. To\nsupport diversity and hence creativity and resilience (two vital functions).\nOthers add ‘social capital,’ the ability of individuals and communities to add\nvalue in what they do for each other – this is an oft-cited feature of the so-\ncalled ‘sharing economy.’\n\nMcDonough and Braungart’s ‘Cradle to Cradle’, as a design philosophy – the\nseminal book of the same name is at the heart of a circular economy – is also\na very practical approach to improving quality, from urban planning to\nproducts and materials science. Their core principles again emphasise the big\npicture and draw insights from living systems for their strength.\n\nKey ‘Cradle to Cradle’ principles include:\n\n​• ​ All materials flow in one of two cycles: biological (can be safely\ndecomposed through the biosphere) or technical (non biodegradable, kept at\nhigh quality and away from the biosphere in their own industrial cycle)\n\n​• ​ Everything is food (sometimes described as waste = food)\n\n​• ​ Shift towards clean energy, essentially renewable\n\n​• ​ Celebrate diversity (since it is a source of both creativity and\nresilience in systems)  \n\nHundreds of products have been redesigned to reflect a Cradle to Cradle\napproach,7 and where it succeeds the advantage is not only manifest in the\nreturns to the business but also more widely. In recent years McDonough and\nBraungart have elaborated their criteria to include five categories for\nproducts: material health, material reutilisation, renewable energy and carbon\nmanagement, water stewardship and social fairness.\n\nThis notion of ‘more widely’ is an important element of a circular economy. It\nis about the economy writ large and, to return to the overall story, is about\nan economy that will work long term and add, not detract, from social and\nenvironmental capital and flows. It does this by being an effective\ncirculatory system, optimised, yet dynamic. The prosperity principle behind it\nis ‘we’re all better off when we are all better off,’8 or, to use living\nsystems insights, ‘healthy trees are found in healthy forests’. Context\nmatters since context brings meaning, as Bill McDonough asks:”What is our\nintention?”\n\nThe Ellen Macarthur Foundation’s take on the circular economy is clear on\nintention, the processes involved and dependence on suitable ‘system\nconditions’ set by governments. Complexity economist Eric Beinhocker describes\nthis important role for governance as ‘shaping the fitness environment’.  \n\nA circular economy is one that is restorative by design, and which aims to\nkeep products, components and materials at their highest utility and value, at\nall times.\n\n1 The circular economy is a global economic model that progressively decouples\neconomic growth and development from the consumption of finite resources;\n\n2 It distinguishes between and separates technical and biological materials,\nkeeping them at their highest value at all times;\n\n3 It focuses on effective design and use of materials to optimise their flow\nand maintain or increase technical and natural resource stocks;\n\n4 It provides new opportunities for innovation across fields such as product\ndesign, service and business models, food, farming, biological feedstocks and\nproducts;\n\n5 and it establishes a framework and building blocks for a resilient system\nable to work in the longer term.\n\nSource: Ellen MacArthur Foundation\n\nThe linear economy is the central flow downwards on the circular economy\ndiagram. The feedback loops of a circular economy are identified following the\nconvention of biological and technical materials flows.\n\nWhat follows in this book is an elaboration of what a circular economy might\nmean for some of the key relationships in an economy. There are several\nchapters which make the business case, including a chapter from Walter Stahel,\nthe instigator of the Cradle to Cradle concept at the end of the 1970s. The\nbook is not comprehensive in the strict sense, as the boundaries of a circular\neconomy are not defined, nor are they ever likely to be. It is more of an\nexploration and reiteration of the salient characteristics; after all – to\npick up on Picasso’s aphorism at the start of the introduction – learning to\npaint in blue when you want red and it’s just run out is quite a challenge.\nBut it’s more a challenge to the imagination than anything else. After all,\nMarcel Proust reminds us:\n\n“The voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new horizons, but in seeing with\nnew eyes.”\n\n![butterflyDiagram](image167.jpg)\n\nDiagram as found in the report Towards a Circular Economy by the Ellen\nMacArthur Foundation created with the support of McKinsey and Company.\n\n1 Hunting and shing\n\n2 Can take both post-harvest and post-consumer waste as an input\n\nSOURCE: Ellen MacArthur Foundation – Adapted from the Cradle to Cradle Design\nProtocol by Braungart & McDonough\n\nA circular economy summarised\n\nAn economy – built on the endless flow of energy from the sun ( energy in\nsurplus ) – which transforms materials into useful goods and services\nendlessly ( waste = food ) .\n\nIt builds capital and maintains it.\n\nMoney is alchemical: it is information which stimulates and co-ordinates the\nexchange of all things at all levels and, as if by magic, our prima materia is\ntransformed ( money as a medium of exchange ) . To do this, prices act as\nmessages and – just as materials need to flow cleanly, uncontaminated, to\nbecome food for new cycles – prices need to reflect the full costs to do their\njob.\n\nLike all living systems, a circular economy is dynamic but adaptive and, if\nenduring, it will be effective , neither courting disaster by over-extending\nefficiency ( brittleness ) or becoming too resistant to change ( stagnation )\n.\n\nIt celebrates diversity – of scale, culture, place, connection and time –\nbecause a dynamic system is full of change, by definition. And thriving in\nsuch an environment requires diversity as a fount of creative adaption , a\nmeans of resilience , a source of redundancy or back-up.\n\nA circular economy is led by business for a profit within the ‘rules of the\ngame’ decided by an active citizenship in a flourishing democracy .\n\nA collection of key relationships – or the story within the story\n\nEnergy in surplus is a precondition, eventually mostly renewables (using flows\nnot stocks)\n\nWaste = food (everything is ‘food’). An upcycle, it (re) builds natural and\nsocial capital and maintains it\n\nMoney as a medium of exchange (as credit, it leads the cycle)\n\nMarkets work if prices act as messages and reflect the full costs\n\nEffective flows not just efficient (optimise thewhole not the part)\n\nCelebrates diversity for reasons of creativity and resilience (to keep a\ndynamic system ‘up’ but adaptive)\n\nLed by business for a profit but within rules set by an active citizenship in\na flourishing democracy. Democracy requires relative abundance not scarcity in\norder to thrive.\n\n“Thinking in systems and cycles, we become metabolists”\n\nGunter Pauli\n\nAt the moment we live in an economy which is overwhelmingly linear. It is a\ntake-make-and-dispose system powered by fossil fuels. It is like a machine:\nthe bigger it is and the faster it runs, the more efficiently it runs, and the\nmore it produces – so long as there are resources to transform and sinks for\nthe wastes, credit for investment and enough economic growth to pay for it\nall. That is what has created the modern world and its comforts. That is also\nwhy we need to think it through afresh. Resources are expensive to extract and\ngetting more so, waste sinks are full, credit for individuals limited and\neconomic growth stumbling. Meanwhile, three billion new middle-class consumers\nare waiting in the wings, expectantly.\n\n\n1 ALL THE FLOWS, HISTORY TOO\n\n![](image211.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\nThere is an arc to change, a time when often disparate forces align and the\nlong-mooted but hesitant becomes possible, or indeed necessary. It is\nreasonable to start in many places and many times to begin to track these\nforces – say the USA and Europe at the end of the post-war boom, or the shock\nof the fall of the Berlin Wall (and the end to one form of bipolar political\nworld), or perhaps the birth of the computer age and the emergence of a truly\nglobal economy. Conventionally, however, the story starts with a reminder\nabout materials and energy use, seeing as how the economy is embedded in\nmaterials, energy and information flows. That truism, that passing assumption,\nis important. At one stage, at the turn of the 20th century, the economy\nbecame ‘disconnected’ from its resource base and it was assumed that it was\nabout a circular flow of income and an accumulation of wealth driven by the\nidealised decision-making of individuals and businesses seeking maximum\n‘utility’ or satisfaction from moment to moment – the neoclassical consensus.\nTo get a representation of what this implies, take a look at the diagram\nopposite, and imagine the two elements highlighted (in outer blue circles) are\nout of the equation – energy was boundless and cheap, materials endless if\nenough energy, technology and human ingenuity was applied. Money was the\neconomy’s measure, the arbiter too of what was included, and therefore\nimportant, or excluded, and not important. Money oiled the machinery too.\n\nNatural and social capital, the reservoirs of resources for production became\nan incidental part of the economic playbook rather than the economy being\nnested within the environment and what society demanded of the economy.\n\nIt’s best to lay this narrow focus to one side early on – the economy\ndiscussed in this book is assumed to have an intimate connection with energy\nand ‘stuff’ and how it all flows. The economy is embedded. The inescapable\nlaws of thermodynamics apply to it as much as anything else. It feels rather\nstrange having to make this point, but the level of disconnection that has\nbeen reached in our mental representation of the economic system is such that\nit is necessary to emphasise it.\n\nFLOWS WITHIN AN ECONOMY\n\n![EMF CE Diagram 2e WHITE.ai](image222.jpg)\n\nAdapted from: Joël de Rosnay, The Macroscope (1979)\n\nWe may be close to a time of pervasive change. The cost of extracting both\nenergy and materials increases as the quality and accessibility of the\nremaining stocks declines, putting a kind of floor on prices from the supply\nside yet rising costs do not feed through into higher prices for very long\nbefore triggering demand destruction. It seems oil much above $100 a barrel is\nsuch a trigger. This see-saw effect between supply and demand is extremely\nproblematic since economic growth appears to depend on cheap and plentiful\nenergy to underwrite increasing productivity. Mining takes between 5 and 10%\nof global energy production. An indirect, but hugely significant effect comes\nfrom credit. The big price rises of the period 2004-08 and 2009-12 coincide\nwith huge expansions of private credit, especially in the developed world - in\nthe former case and then China, in the latter. Prices are not just about\ndigging stuff up and processing it with customers having to pay whatever it\ncosts whatever the circumstances. Wild credit fuelled expansions in real\nestate and infrastructure can do the same thing, and when these forces subside\nso do the energy and commodity markets. The Commodity Price Index diagram\ncharts some of the changes in prices, note the end of an overall fall in\nduring much of the 20th century.\n\nThe rising demand from the new middle classes, especially in Asia is\nsignificant too (even if middle class merely means those earning anywhere\nbetween $10 and $100 a day). This stresses resources such as water and energy\nas well as through more housing, changing food choices, ‘consumer’ products\nand services.\n\nOther measures of natural capital show declines: fisheries’ stocks, forests,\nand significantly soil losses, which amount to nearly 4 tonnes per person per\nyear.1 All of these tightening natural resource supply chains invite\nspeculative activity, leading to very damaging volatility and turning already\ndifficult trading for manufacturers, who need to plan ahead, into potential\nmayhem. It is easy to see that this emerging configuration leads to short-\ntermism, and that, as a result, the current global economy can arguably be\nseen as not much more than a race for the remaining resources.2  \n\nThere are the wastes too, and the toxicity, a panoply of endocrine disruption\nat one end to the dismal life-shortening smogs of a Mexico City, Tehran or\nBeijing at another. The surplus of carbon in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide\nis disrupting weather patterns and crop yields, for example, and bringing\nadditional extreme weather events and rapid changes in the ice caps.\n\nGrouping several significant trends, the New Scientist published this\ngraphic.3 While it presents a somewhat disturbing view of our world, it can\nalso prompt the thought that we are looking at big picture systems-wide change\nhere. That is where the solutions will also be found.  \n\nA few illustrations here will serve to reinforce the point and the detail can\nbe found in any number of what has become a cascade of books and information\nin recent years, among them Bankrupting Nature , by Anders Wijkman and Johan\nRockström, The Future, by Al Gore, and the Worldwatch Institute series State\nof the World and Vital Signs. 4\n\n![theGlobalCommod](image235.jpg)\n\n![coppervitalsigns](image239.jpg)\n\nOne example is the concentration of ore in mining operations. Copper is the\ncommodity illustrated in this graphic. Ore concentrations continue to fall\nprompting more expenditure, especially in innovations in material recovery,\nand the need for high and rising prices to compensate.5\n\nThe case of the critical materials ‘panic’ is another challenge, and a far\nmore complex one.\n\nThe volatility of the prices for so-called rare earths was noted in a previous\nedition of this book (a section prepared in 2014) but since then the situation\nlooks rather different. Much of the rare earth production is based in China\nand the Commodity Price Index diagram shows what happened to prices.\n\nDemand and prices rose, no doubt fuelled by credit and speculation as well as\npart of the need for the likes of neodymium or indium, while supply was\nlagging. Several US mines had shut due to competition from China and low\nprices. But this situation soon changed. The demand shifted somewhat as\nproducers of electronics became more efficient or found substitutes6 , old\nmines were opened and existing ones upped production. China also began to\nunblock some of its controls on exports. The period coincided with a fall in\nthe rate of increase of credit in China. Materials prices are now relatively\nlow and quite stable, some new mines opened in the USA that have closed again\nas quickly in bankruptcy. Yes, a price spike was an example of volatility but\nfew expected prices to fall so much and for so long while the output of\nelectronics, hybrid cars and wind turbines continues as before. It has in fact\nincreased.\n\nThe lesson may be that looking to materials supply issues alone is narrow.\nThese materials are not running out, the challenge may be to redesign business\nmodels and logistics so that the risks of being caught by the next price spike\nare mitigated or even removed by ‘circularity’: continuous reutilisation. This\nis a major task and the tendency might be to stay with what we know: tweak\nefficiency and materials substitution or wait for better materials recovery\ntechniques to mature, especially if the price and supply pressure is off for\nthe moment. There is something of the perennial interplay between short and\nlong term here.\n\n![productioRates](image249.jpg)\n\nAn extract from an interview with Chris Nelder in 2012, an energy analyst and\nconsultant in the Washington Post :\n\n“In 2005, we reached 73 million barrels per day. Then, to increase production\nbeyond that, the world had to double spending on oil production. In 2012,\nwe’re now spending USD 600 billion. The price of oil has tripled. And yet, for\nall that additional expenditure, we’ve only raised production 3 percent to 75\nmillion barrels per day [since 2005].\n\nAt some point, you wind up investing so much energy to produce more energy\nthat you start losing the race. It becomes non-useful or ineffective to keep\ntrying to produce more energy.\n\nAnd there’s a turning point on this – it’s called the ‘the net energy cliff’.\nWhen the ratio of energy output to energy input gets down to about 6 to 1,\nthen you fall off this cliff, and it’s just not worth doing. In the early days\nof oil production, that ratio was about 100 to 1. 7 Globally, right now, it’s\napproaching 11 to 1. And it’s even lower for some newer sources. The return on\ninvestment for heavy oil from the Kern River field in California is about 4 to\n1.\n\nThe point is that the net energy available to society has been declining\nradically. If you want to run a society, your net energy for oil production\nhas to be at least 5 to 1. And if you want to run a modern complex society,\nwith televisions, iPads, highly advanced medicine, etc., then you probably\nneed an Energy Return On Investment (EROI) closer to 10 to 1. So it’s reaching\nthe point where we’re in the danger zone.\n\nThe upshot is that we need to prepare for the day when oil is going to leave\nus. The sooner we commit to an energy transition, to renewable energy, the\nbetter off we’ll be in every respect. You can make that argument just on the\nbasis of production rates and price. And that’s not even considering carbon\nemissions and climate change, which is another great reason. Let alone what\noil is doing to the global economy.”\n\nChris Nelder 8\n\nOur current linear economy is substantially built on the premise of the\nsurplus which cheap energy provides. Research by James Murray and Jim Hansen 9\npoints to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data proving a historically\n“strong correlation between global economic growth (measured by an average of\ngross domestic product (GDP)) and oil production.” They note that out of\neleven recessions in the United States since World War 2, ten were preceded by\noil price spikes.\n\nTo many businesses these energy and materials concerns demand a response,\nsince any business built on cheap energy and materials and mass consumption\nmay well struggle if materials and energy are no longer cheap. Since the\nfinancial collapse of 2007/8 and the bumpy fitful state of the economy which\nhas followed, it is clear that the last of the trinity – credit for\nconsumption – is also deeply problematic for business. The debt overhang – the\nneed to repay debts and the effect that this has on money available for other\nthings like consumer purchases – is cramping both the demand for, and supply\nof, credit to Main Street.\n\nAs noted earlier, the economy is not only embedded in these energy and\nmaterials flows, we must also consider information flows through the systems.\nThere is change now of the most profound kind associated with information\ntechnology. Changes include the rise in labour productivity – so much more is\nproduced with less in ever more automated factories and streamlined\ndistribution systems (see chapter 9). One downside is the parallel expansion\nof a ‘gig’ economy. This is the labour side of an on-demand service economy –\nthe on-demand worker, paid what used to be called “piecework” in the factory\nera - payment per item produced. Now it might be payment for each takeaway\ndropped off or for each lecture provided online. The variations are becoming\nendless. For others it is the flexibility they require through a portfolio of\nwork. Information technology has also opened up new possibilities and markets,\nwhether for local producers and customers in France connected to La Ruche\n(Food Assemblies is the English version of the initiative) or for dairy\nfarmers in India bypassing the middlemen, or the eBay phenomenon, or the\nconnection of the world via the Internet and especially mobile telephony where\nthere are now more mobile phones than conventional toilets. Information\ntechnology allows access to information and each other: it has already\ncompletely changed the financial industry and the music and creative\nindustries, news and publishing and transformed travel - everyone now being\ntheir own travel agent - and it is beginning to disrupt education and training\nin an equally profound way.\n\nNone of these IT trends might make the flow of materials and energy more\nbenign, in fact they could even worsen the situation with more poorly designed\nproducts circulating ever more widely and quickly.\n\nEverywhere information technology can be applied to assets (financial products\nof course but also infrastructure, houses, vehicles, tools, materials, people)\nand the tracking of assets. With the creation of an ‘internet of things’, when\nappliances communicate with each other and associated energy systems, there\nfollows what can only be described as seismic shifts in the business models of\na technical civilisation.\n\nInformation technology potentially allows the tools of the economy, the\nmedium- and long-life durable products, to become the basis for a market in\nthe services they provide, rather than just selling the product itself. With\nappropriate maintenance, value is added by product-life extension; after that,\nthe materials can be recovered as valuable components and sub-assemblies,\nwhich can, in turn, be refurbished and reused and improved. Information\ntechnology allows easy administration and the billing for a thousand small\ntransactions. It even allows the creation of designer currencies to reach the\nparts of the economy not served by the conventional currency monocultures (see\nChapter 6).\n\nThe circular economy, if it is to come, will be the product of many forces:\nthe realities of materials and energy supply and price interactions; the\ngrowth of demand worldwide from new consumers; and the pressures of uncosted\nexternalities on societies and governments and the economy – there is no\n‘away’ for waste to go. But arguably the central catalyst will be the\npossibilities that information technology offers for business models which\nwill stimulate entrepreneur and established business alike and transform our\nrelationships with the industrial economy.\n\nThe economy, however, is not a shiny object, made only of energy, materials,\ninformation and knowledge. It is also part of a system with its own history,\nconstraints and consequences. Where we are now needs understanding more\nbroadly and the next chapter revisits the evolution of the global economy\nsince World War 2 and points out more of the challenges which need to be\novercome before a circular economy can emerge.\n\n\n2 THE NECESSITY OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY?\n\n![](image277.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“All things happen through strife and necessity”\n\nHeraclitus (c600 BC)\n\nWhat if a circular economy went from being a promising innovation platform for\nentrepreneurs and established businesses looking for new profit streams in\nturbulent times to the category of necessity?\n\nHeraclitus, the first philosopher of change, had it right. There is the\nstruggle, there is what we choose, and there is a bigger necessity that we\ncannot resist. Throwing a ball higher than someone else is the ‘strife’ and\nseeing all of these balls fall under gravity is the necessity.\n\nThis chapter makes the case for the necessity of a circular economy from an\nhistorical perspective. It’s a look at the recent history of the Western\neconomies and some of the consequences of the existing economic arrangements,\nas well as what may be emerging as a result.\n\nSomething quite profound happened in the mid to late 1970s. The average wage\nfor employees lost touch with economic growth. Every decade for the previous\n150 years had seen rising living standards in the USA, and it was much the\nsame across Europe. Wages, now stagnated as a proportion of the economic pie\nand inflation-adjusted, have not risen significantly since. Profitability\nincreased markedly across the board however, as productivity kept rising, as\ndid inequality of income. Economic growth has largely become jobless growth\nbackfilled with increasing numbers of part-time, short-contract and low-paid\nworkers. These workers do not make confident consumers.\n\n![compensationWorkers](image295.jpg)\n\nThere are several reasons for this wage stagnation, including: offshoring;\nincreasing labour productivity; the presence of many more women in the labour\nforce; more part-time workers; new technologies – especially the lead-up to\nthe digital revolution; deregulation and growth of the financial sector; and\nthe breakdown of the social contract – especially after the end of the Cold\nWar in the mid to late 1980s. The focus for now is on the proportions of the\neconomic pie and where they go.\n\nSufficient wages overall, however, are needed to buy all the products being\nproduced and if there are more goods but less spending power, even if cheaper\ngoods arrive from abroad, it’s a problem.\n\nIn recent times, credit has been needed to bridge the gap since wages did not\nsuffice. It was a necessity if the economy was not to fall into recession and\nworse. The economy has two main modes: expansion and contraction, and each has\nits reinforcing feedback mechanisms. Growth soon switches into its evil twin\nif the flow of goods and services produced is out of balance with available\npurchasing power. Hence credit for, well, everyone as far as possible. Credit\nprovision also made sense as a way of using the additional profits from\nbusiness very profitably. Mass production requires mass consumption, which in\nturn requires credit, both secured and unsecured, for producer and consumer.\nSeveral car companies, and GM is the prime example, had long used credit\nsubsidiaries to supply consumers with the means to purchase the company’s own\ncars. Very often, these ‘banks’ were far more profitable than the unit selling\nvehicles and extended their operations into real estate and insurance – at\nleast until the financial crash of 2007–08.\n\nDebt is a claim on future wealth. Debts sits more lightly if there is growth,\nif these payments are not to become an ever bigger part of the economic pie\nand prompt a downward spiral – less spending, less production, less work and\nso on.\n\nCredit creation, if done prudently, requires some assets as collateral and\nclassically this means property, usually real estate or stocks and shares or\nbonds. The expansion of credit tends to increase the price of these assets and\nthere is a pressure upwards that can accelerate and lead to a bubble\nphenomenon. This happened in the USA several times after the 1980s – the\nSavings and Loans crisis, the stock market Internet stocks bubble of 1999, and\nfinally the real estate bubble of 2003–08. With the collapse of the last, and\ndespite the injection of more liquidity than the USA spent on World War 2, the\nMarshall Plan, Vietnam and the wars in the Middle East combined, the USA and\nmost other OECD economies remain relatively lifeless six years on – outside of\nstock markets and financials, unsurprisingly.  \n\nAsia is an exception to an extent, but signs of an overheated real-estate boom\nin China and India and slowing economic growth are present there as well.\nGrowth continues to be led by substantial credit expansion and infrastructure\nbuilding and this is the main source of the real estate booms. As oversupply\ntook hold in production of all kinds and sales in Europe and the USA edged\ndown the threat to the main street (non financial) economy is now falling\nprices, demand and incomes.\n\n![boostingDemand](image305.jpg)\n\nOther social trends add to a worrying picture: increasingly ageing populations\nand rising unemployment – particularly among the under 25s – are calling on\nmore public provision just as public funds are strained in the aftermath of\nrescuing the financial sector. The overhang of private debt (household,\ncorporate and financial) is huge and the public sector debt, while smaller, is\nstill significant. The debt in the private sector means that income is\nincreasingly going to paying it down and thus not to new consumption or\ninvestment in productive goods. In the public sector high debt levels,\nparticularly after 2008, also restrict expenditure or force public spending\ncuts, often described by the term ‘austerity’.\n\nThe industrial era of prosperity began to move out of focus in the 1970s as\nproductivity parted company with median wage levels and was shocked to a\nstandstill in the year 2008. If this linear economy can be characterised as\nthroughput- and efficiency-led, based on cheap energy and materials\n(substituting for labour), supported by easy credit – which was in turn held\nup by economic growth – then truly it has run out of steam.\n\nWe have surplus goods, surplus in that there is insufficient effective demand\nfor these goods, leading to factories running under capacity, expensive to get\nenergy, difficult credit conditions, and poor growth/stagnation. All this\ntends to undermine health, education, savings and pensions, and what remains\nof the weakening contract between state and society. Declining environmental\nconditions were noted in the New Scientist graph in Chapter 1. For the sake of\ncompleteness a little needs to be said about rising inequality. It is long\nestablished that the rich do not spend all that they receive and often make\ninvestments in assets from the surplus – usually stocks, bonds and real\nestate. This then creates inflation in asset prices if there is a continual\nsupply of bank credit. In turn this lifts housing costs – rents and mortgages\n- and dampens other expenditure, so discouraging investment in the productive\neconomy.\n\nThe disturbing part of all of this is quite how easily it can be pieced\ntogether as the consequences of a set of inappropriate ‘rules of the game’.\nWhat was a very effective economic machine in a context of cheap and\naccessible energy and materials has to make way for another operating system,\nfit for the 21st-century globalised reality. In a few words, we need different\nrules of the game, if the economy is still to allow us to be ‘at home in the\nmodern world’.\n\nSeen in this perspective, the golden generations of those in adulthood in\nEurope between 1947 and 1979 and in the credit expansion phase 1979–2008 were\nenjoying a linear economy as good as it (ever) gets.\n\nBut what if there was another way of seeing the world, one based in the\nscience of our times, one which entrained systems in a virtuous cycle of\ncapital building rather than in a vicious one where human, social,\nmanufactured and natural capital are transformed into financial capital? All\nsystems have histories and all systems tend to entrain, to draw in and shape\nrelationships and material within their orbit. The linear throughput economy\nentrains by translating materials into manufactures, or soils into food, via\ncheap energy, or fisheries into fish fingers. Could we change the rules of the\ngame? Yes we can, and it is in fact fairly intuitive. It is not a new idea,\nand has been rolling around in different forms for more than 30 years1 but\nwhat is different now is that it has been refined and has begun to engage\nbusiness in a way that business recognises. More importantly, it is core to\nunderstanding where prosperity might come from in a changing world.\n\nIt may be the case of ‘come the necessity comes the invention’, even if people\nlike Walter Stahel have been advocating it since the late 1970s (see Chapter\n5). The timing needed to be right. Much has changed which makes this decade\nthe gateway to the transition to a circular economy, It would be wrong to say\nthat humans have come to their senses, it may be that only now do the\nadvantages seem so clear.\n\nOrdered, complex, intertwined mutually interdependent systems are the new\nnormal. That is where the economy and business exists, and hence the notion\nthat a circular economy is an expression of systems thinking: an opportunity\nto upgrade our economics and business to match an expanded, richer vision.\n\n\n3 FROM LINEAR TO CIRCULAR\n\n![linear to circular.eps](image322.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Colin Webster\n\nThis chapter comes from Towards the Circular Economy – economic and business\nrationale for an accelerated transition (2012)\n\nTHE CIRCULAR ECONOMY FRAMEWORK\n\nThe circular economy refers to an industrial economy that is restorative by\nintention; aims to rely on renewable energy; minimises, tracks, and hopefully\neliminates the use of toxic chemicals; and eradicates waste through careful\ndesign. The term goes beyond the mechanics of production and consumption of\ngoods and services, in the areas that it seeks to redefine (examples include\nrebuilding capital including social and natural, and the shift from consumer\nto user). The concept of the circular economy is grounded in the study of non-\nlinear, particularly living systems.\n\nA major outcome of taking insights from living systems is the notion of\noptimising systems rather than components, which can also be referred to as\n‘design to fit’ – by analogy, the tree is nothing without the forest. It\ninvolves a careful management of materials flows, which in the circular\neconomy are of two types as described by McDonough and Braungart (Cradle to\nCradle: Remaking the way we make things ): biological nutrients, designed to\nre-enter the biosphere safely and build natural capital, and technical\nnutrients, which are designed to circulate at high quality without entering\nthe biosphere.\n\nAs a result, the circular economy draws a sharp distinction between the\nconsumption and use of materials: circular economy advocates the need for a\n‘functional service’ model in which manufacturers or retailers increasingly\nretain the ownership of their products and, where possible, act as service\nproviders – selling the use of products, not their one-way consumption. This\nshift has direct implications for the development of efficient and effective\ntake-back systems and the proliferation of product- and business model design\npractices that generate more durable products, facilitate disassembly and\nrefurbishment and, where appropriate, consider product/service shifts. As\ncircular economy pioneer Walter Stahel explains:\n\n“The linear model turned services into products that can be sold, but this\nthroughput approach is a wasteful one. In the past, reuse and service-life\nextension were often strategies in situations of scarcity” or poverty and led\nto products of inferior quality. Today, they are signs of good resource\nhusbandry and smart management.”\n\nWalter Stahel, London, November 2012\n\nThe linear ‘make-take-and-dispose’ model relies on large quantities of easily\naccessible resources and energy, and as such is increasingly unfit for the\nreality in which it operates. Working towards efficiency – a reduction of\nresources and fossil energy consumed per unit of manufacturing output – will\nnot alter the finite nature of their stocks but can only delay the inevitable.\nA change of the entire operating system seems necessary.\n\n![DesignForLife](image342.jpg)\n\nThe circular economy is based on a few simple principles:\n\nDESIGN OUT WASTE\n\nWaste does not exist when the biological and technical components (or\n‘materials’) of a product are designed by intention to fit within a biological\nor technical materials cycle, designed for disassembly and re-purposing. The\nbiological materials are non-toxic and can be simply composted. Technical\nmaterials – polymers, alloys and other man-made materials – are designed to be\nused again with minimal energy and highest quality retention (whereas\nrecycling as commonly understood results in a reduction in quality and feeds\nback into the process as a crude feedstock). Coined by Braungart and\nMcDonough, the phrase “waste is food” summarises the circular philosophy –\nthough as Braungart himself would say today, “the word waste should not even\nbe in there, there is no such thing, everything should be food.”\n\nBUILD RESILIENCE THROUGH DIVERSITY\n\nModularity, versatility, and adaptivity are prized features that need to be\nprioritised in an uncertain and fast-evolving world. Diverse systems with many\nconnections and scales are more resilient in the face of external shocks than\nsystems built simply for efficiency – throughput maximisation driven to the\nextreme results in fragility.\n\nWORK TOWARDS USING ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES\n\nSystems should ultimately aim to run on renewable sources. As Vestas, the wind\nenergy company, puts it: “Any circular story should start by looking into the\nenergy involved in the production process”. Systems should ultimately aim to\nrun on renewable energy – enabled by the reduced threshold energy levels\nrequired by a restorative, circular economy. The agricultural production\nsystem solely runs on current solar income but significant amounts of fossil\nfuels are used in fertilisers, farm machinery, processing and through the\nsupply chain. More integrated food and farming systems would reduce the need\nfor fossil-fuel based inputs and capture more of the energy value of by-\nproducts and manures. They would also increase the demand for human labour –\nwhich Walter Stahel has argued should be an integral part of this evolution:\n“Shifting taxation from labour to energy and material consumption would fast-\ntrack adoption of more circular business models; it would also make sure that\nwe are putting the efficiency pressure on the true bottleneck of our resource-\nconsuming society/economy – there is no shortage of labour and (renewable)\nenergy in the long term.”\n\nTHINK IN ‘SYSTEMS’\n\nThe ability to understand how parts influence one another within a whole, and\nthe relationship of the whole to the parts, is crucial. Elements are\nconsidered in relation to their environmental and social contexts. While a\nmachine is also a system, it is clearly narrowly bounded and assumed to be\ndeterministic. Systems thinking usually refers to the overwhelming majority of\nreal-world systems: these are non-linear, feedback-rich, and interdependent.\nIn such systems, imprecise starting conditions combined with feedback lead to\noften surprising consequences, and to outcomes that are frequently not\nproportional to the input (runaway or ‘undamped’ feedback). Such systems\ncannot be managed in the conventional ‘linear’ sense, requiring instead more\nflexibility and more frequent adaptation to changing circumstances.\n\nSystems thinking emphasises stocks and flows. The maintenance or replenishment\nof stock is inherent in feedback-rich systems, which are assumed to have some\nlongevity, and has the potential to encompass regeneration and even evolution\nin living systems. In a business context, their modular and adaptive\nproperties mean more leeway for innovation and the development of diversified\nvalue chains, as well as less dependence on purely short-term strategies.\nUnderstanding flows in complex systems also tells us something more about the\ntrade-off between efficiency and resilience. Systems that are increasingly\nefficient have fewer nodes, fewer connections, and greater throughput but also\nbecome increasingly brittle or, to use Nassim Taleb’s term, ‘fragile’. This\nmakes them vulnerable to the effects of shocks, like price volatility or\ninterruption of supply. Systems with many nodes and connections are more\nresilient, but can become sclerotic – slow to change (at the extreme), and\nthus ineffective.\n\nEffectiveness is the sweet spot where resilience and efficiency interplay:\nefficiency (doing things right) is welcome, but in the service of\neffectiveness (doing the right thing), with the prime objective of ensuring\nthe business fits the economy. This is a way of thinking about the idea of\nsystems optimisation. Because more of the flows of materials, goods and\nservices are valorised in a circular economy and because risk is reduced, the\nfirm is compensated for the reduced upside of efficiency with lower costs,\nadditional cash flows and – in many cases – fewer regulatory concerns (as\nwastes are eliminated, or are now benign flows).\n\nTHINK IN CASCADES\n\nFor biological materials, the essence of value creation lies in the\nopportunity to extract additional value from products and materials by\ncascading them through other applications. In biological decomposition, be it\nnatural or in controlled fermentation processes, material is broken down in\nstages by microorganisms like bacteria and fungi that extract energy and\nnutrients from the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins found in the material.\nFor instance, going from tree to furnace forgoes the value that could be\nharnessed via staged decomposition through successive uses as timber and\ntimber products before decay and eventual incineration.  \n\nThe complete biological entity should be considered. Mycelium packaging, an\ninnovation based on the bonding properties of mushroom ‘roots’, uses the\nentire ‘living polymer’, as well as the organic waste system on which it\ngrows. A holistic, cascade-based relationship with coffee would consider the\nentire fruit (the cherry) and the whole coffee-growing protocol. The entire\nshrub in its context also needs integrating: as a shade-loving plant, it may\nwell be positioned adjacent to other trees. In addition, coffee production\ngenerates 12 million tonnes of agricultural waste per year. This waste could\nbe used to replace hardwoods traditionally used as growth media to farm high-\nvalue tropical mushrooms, a market with double-digit growth (currently USD 17\nbillion globally). Coffee waste is in fact a superior medium, as it shortens\nthe production period. The residue (after being used as a growth medium) can\nbe reused as livestock feed, as it contains valuable enzymes, and can be\nreturned to the soil in the form of animal manure.\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE MAIN SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT\n\nThe circular economy concept has deep-rooted origins and cannot be traced back\nto one single date or author. Its practical applications to modern economic\nsystems and industrial processes, however, have gained momentum since the late\n1970s led by a small number of academics, thought-leaders and businesses.\n\nThe generic concept has been refined and developed by the following schools of\nthought:\n\nREGENERATIVE DESIGN\n\nIn the US, John T Lyle started developing ideas on regenerative design that\ncould be applied to all systems, i.e., beyond agriculture, for which the\nconcept of regeneration had already been formulated earlier. Arguably, he laid\nthe foundations of the circular economy framework, which notably developed and\ngained prominence thanks to McDonough (who had studied with Lyle), Braungart\nand Stahel. Today, the Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies offers courses on\nthe subject.  \n\nPERFORMANCE ECONOMY\n\nWalter Stahel, architect and economist, sketched in his 1976 research report\nto the European Commission The Potential for Substituting Manpower for Energy\n, co-authored with Genevieve Reday, the vision of an economy in loops (or\ncircular economy) and its impact on job creation, economic competitiveness,\nresource savings, and waste prevention. Credited with having coined the\nexpression ‘Cradle to Cradle’ in the late 1970s, Stahel worked at developing a\n‘closed loop’ approach to production processes and created the Product-Life\nInstitute in Geneva more than 25 years ago. It pursues four main goals:\nproduct-life extension, long-life goods, reconditioning activities, and waste\nprevention. It also insists on the importance of selling services rather than\nproducts, an idea referred to as the ‘functional service economy’, now more\nwidely subsumed into the notion of ‘performance economy’. Stahel argues that\nthe circular economy should be considered a framework: as a generic notion,\nthe circular economy draws on several more specific approaches that gravitate\naround a set of basic principles.\n\nCRADLE TO CRADLE\n\nGerman chemist and visionary Michael Braungart went on to develop, together\nwith American architect Bill McDonough, the Cradle to Cradle™ concept and\ncertification process. This design philosophy considers all material involved\nin industrial and commercial processes to be nutrients, of which there are two\nmain categories: technical and biological. The Cradle to Cradle framework\nfocuses on design for effectiveness in terms of products with positive impact\nand reducing the negative impacts of commerce through efficiency.\n\nCradle to Cradle design perceives the safe and productive processes of\nnature’s ‘biological metabolism’ as a model for developing a ‘technical\nmetabolism’ flow of industrial materials. Product components can be designed\nfor continuous recovery and reutilisation as biological and technical\nnutrients within these metabolisms. The Cradle to Cradle framework addresses\nenergy and water inputs:\n\n​• ​ Eliminate the concept of waste. “Waste equals food.” Design products and\nmaterials with life cycles that are safe for human health and the environment\nand that can be reused perpetually through biological and technical\nmetabolisms. Create and participate in systems to collect and recover the\nvalue of these materials following their use.\n\n​• ​ Power with renewable energy. “Use current solar income.” Maximise the use\nof renewable energy.  \n\n​• ​ “Celebrate diversity”. Manage water use to maximise quality, promote\nhealthy ecosystems and respect local impacts. Guide operations and stakeholder\nrelationships using social responsibility.\n\nINDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY\n\nIndustrial ecology is the study of material and energy flows through\nindustrial systems. Focusing on connections between operators within the\n‘industrial ecosystem’, this approach aims at creating closed-loop processes\nin which waste serves as an input, thus eliminating the notion of an\nundesirable by-product. Industrial ecology adopts a systemic point of view,\ndesigning production processes in accordance with local ecological constraints\nwhilst looking at their global impact from the outset, and attempting to shape\nthem so they perform as close to living systems as possible. This framework is\nsometimes referred to as the ‘science of sustainability’, given its\ninterdisciplinary nature, and its principles can also be applied in the\nservices sector. With an emphasis on natural capital restoration, industrial\necology also focuses on social wellbeing.\n\nBIOMIMICRY\n\nJanine Benyus, author of Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature, defines\nher approach as “a new discipline that studies nature’s best ideas and then\nimitates these designs and processes to solve human problems”. Studying a leaf\nto invent a better solar cell is an example. She thinks of it as ‘innovation\ninspired by nature’. Biomimicry relies on three key principles:  \n\n​• ​ Nature as model: Study nature’s models and emulate these forms,\nprocesses, systems, and strategies to solve human problems.\n\n​• ​ Nature as measure: Use an ecological standard to judge the sustainability\nof our innovations.\n\n​• ​ Nature as mentor: View and value nature not based on what we can extract\nfrom the natural world, but what we can learn from it.\n\nBLUE ECONOMY\n\nInitiated by former Ecover CEO and Belgian businessman Gunter Pauli, the Blue\nEconomy is an open-source movement bringing together concrete case studies,\ninitially compiled in an eponymous report handed over to the Club of Rome. As\nthe official manifesto states, “using the resources available in cascading\nsystems, (...) the waste of one product becomes the input to create a new cash\nflow”. Based on 21 founding principles, the Blue Economy insists on solutions\nbeing determined by their local environment and physical/ecological\ncharacteristics, putting the emphasis on gravity as the primary source of\nenergy. The report, which doubles up as the movement’s manifesto, describes\n“100 innovations that can create 100 million jobs within the next 10 years”,\nand provides many examples of winning South-South collaborative projects –\nanother original feature of this approach intent on promoting its hands-on\nfocus.\n\nHis focus is most often grass roots entrepreneurship, “substituting something\nwith nothing” and “creating prosperity with what you didn’t know you already\nhad”. It echoes Amory Lovins when he talks about the main barriers to change\nbeing in our heads. Like Lovins and Marcin Jakubowski from the Global Village\nConstruction Set Gunter Pauli believes scarcity is artificial.\n\nThe blue economy, akin to Jakubowski’s ‘open source economy’, is a serious\ninitiative around rethinking the economy from the basics and encouraging\nentrepreneurship at the grass roots level. In passing, Gunter uses the term\nblue economy as a way of challenging advocates of a command economy (red) and\na green economy (only for the well-off consumer). As ‘blue’ is the colour of\nthe planet seen from space, it is meant to convey a big picture significance.\n\nPERMACULTURE\n\nAustralian ecologists Bill Mollison and David Holmgren coined the term\n‘permaculture’ in the late 1970s, defining it as “the conscious design and\nmaintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems, which have the diversity,\nstability and resilience of natural ecosystems”. Considerable interest in the\nconcept exists around the globe, propelled by thinkers and practitioners like\nMasanobu Fukuoka in Japan and Sepp Holzer in Austria. Permaculture draws\nelements from both traditional sustainable agriculture and modern innovations\nand principles. Permaculture systems improve yields and diets while reducing\nwater consumption, improving soil quality and restoring biodiversity.\nPermaculture integrates elements from agroforestry (forest farming, alley\ncropping, windbreaks), conservation agriculture (fertiliser trees, no till and\nuncompacted soils, permanent soil cover), organic agriculture (organic inputs\nand on-site nutrient recycling), and traditional agriculture (rainwater\nharvesting and water infiltration, including key-line design and tied contour\nbunds). Further aspects it covers are sustainable livestock management\n(integrated crop-livestock systems) for subsistence smallholders and\ncommercial operations, and agro-ecology (the optimal selection of system\nelements originating in different times and places). It deploys methods that\nare compatible with the sustained intensification of production. In the public\nperception it is associated with local and/or small-scale operations which\nrequire extensive knowledge and application to succeed.\n\nThis table contrasts linear and circular modes for the general elucidation of\nthe idea that systems entrain and the consequences are much less a matter of\nchoice at an individual level than might be supposed. If extending and\nexploiting circularity in business is one key aim, we need to know how a\nsubtle change of the rules of the game might have far-reaching consequences\nover time. There is nothing here about explicit social policy or political\nsystems. A circular economy can be made to work under a range of value systems\nwhich is both an advantage and a risk. However its broad systems orientation\nsuggests an inclusive, all scales prosperity.\n\n![table1](image399.jpg)\n\n![table2](image402.jpg)\n\n\n4 THROUGH THE MACROSCOPE\n\n![](image411.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“The key to complexity is systems thinking. The key to systems thinking is\nPatterns; and, the key to using Patterns is to form them into a language.”\n\nChristopher Alexander\n\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, scientific method was developed\naround the worldview that everything was mechanical in character, it was\n‘machine-like’.\n\nThis ‘world as machine’ was a fine idea and was used to search for the\nbuilding blocks and then the mechanisms in every one of the emerging\ndisciplines: in physics, chemistry, medicine, engineering, biology (where\nDarwin had such an influence at a later date). It had application and was just\na better way of getting things done: it had consequences and the industrial\nrevolution was just one. The idea applied as much in the social realm through\nthe new studies of psychology, sociology and of course in that branch of\nnatural philosophy called economics, all of which soon wanted to be\nquantitative sciences. In economics the market became the mechanism for\ndeciding resource allocation, and the individual as consumer and as business\n(producer) or worker was best served by a free exchange, open information,\nmany buyers and sellers and the rational, welfare-maximising ‘homo\neconomicus’. Anything less would restrict the market mechanism.\n\nMore broadly, the individual as the ‘atom of society’ was not only able to\nmake her own approach to the Divine, rather than through the priest, by being\nable to read the Bible in her own language, but she was also to begin shaking\noff irrational arrangements in all else, from social duties to business, to\ndenounce them, as in the example above, a hindrance on trade – the rationale\nof trade being the market. It became commonplace to point to the individual,\nor the individual business (when they became legal entities as corporations)\nas the rational focus for all economic choices and benefits deployed through\nthe market. Welcome to the modern world. And it worked. For a time it was\nalmost deified as ‘Progress’ with a capital ‘P’.\n\nThe modern world became the expression of an idea or framework, and in common\nwith all abstract ideas – these grand metanarratives – it used a self-\nreferencing set of metaphors to express its meaning. This is the ‘world as\nmachine’ metaphor, unsurprisingly. Thus, so often is largeness and scale\ncelebrated, because this is meant to be efficiency deployed in a grand manner.\nIt was an era of mass production and mass consumption. And in resource and\nenergy terms the economy was a machine for turning materials and energy into\nproducer and consumer goods and services. Since resources and resourcefulness\nwere as endless as the oil gushing from the wells of West Texas and Persia,\nmore and faster and more efficiently were the keys to surplus which in turn\nmade everyone richer. A machine world, manufacturing prosperity endlessly …\n\nIn general, Enlightenment 1.0, as sketched above, is quite a long story and a\nsuccessful one. It enabled artillery shells and moonshots, the Model T Ford,\nthe elimination of many diseases, the creation of atomic bombs, and the\nfeeding of some billion more people who could not subsist otherwise. It’s all\naround us.\n\nHowever it is not the full story, it is not a case of carry on regardless.\nThis mechanistic worldview, and thus the economy built on it, is inadequate,\nor incomplete.\n\nJoël de Rosnay takes up the story. 1 … He suggests that the classical thought\ndetailed above has an over-emphasis on analysis and that this should be\nbalanced by synthesis, and more.\n\n“To the opposition of analytic and systemic we must add the opposition of\nstatic vision and dynamic vision. Our knowledge of nature and the major\nscientific laws rests on what I shall call ‘classic thought’, which has three\nmain characteristics. Its concepts have been shaped in the image of a ‘solid’\n(conservation of form, preservation of volume, effects of force, spatial\nrelations, hardness, solidity).\n\nIrreversible time, that of life’s duration, of the non-determined, of chance\nevents is never taken into account. All that counts is physical time and\nreversible phenomena. T can be changed to -T without modifying the phenomena\nunder study.\n\nThe only form of explanation of phenomena is linear causality; that is, the\nmethod of explanation relies on a logical sequence of cause and effect that\nextends for its full dimension along the arrow of time.”\n\nAre you ready to be discomforted?\n\nAbout forty-five years ago a number of Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nstaff and alumni, including Joël de Rosnay (a Mauritian-born French science\nwriter, futurist and molecular biologist), began to compare our usual means of\nseeing: the microscope, for detail, the infinitely small, and the telescope\nfor distance, the infinitely great, with what the emerging science around\nsystems was demanding – a macroscope. A device that dropped the detail and\nrevealed the big picture, the overview, the infinitely complex, the pattern.\n\n“To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new\nangle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science.”\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nIn present modes of thought, influenced by the systemic approach, the concept\nof the fluid replaces that of the solid. Movement replaces permanence.\nFlexibility and adaptability replace rigidity and stability.\n\nThe concepts of flow and flow equilibrium are added to those of force and\nforce equilibrium. Duration and irreversibility enter as basic dimensions in\nthe nature of phenomena. Causality becomes circular and opens up to finality.\nThe dynamics of systems shatters the static vision of organisations and\nstructures; by integrating time it makes manifest relatedness and development\n. Another table may help to enlighten and enrich the most important concepts\nrelated to classic thought and systemic thought.\n\nThe following table compares, one by one, the traits of the two approaches,\nsee also figure p10.  \n\n![analyticalApproach](image443.jpg)\n\n![systemicApproach](image446.jpg)\n\nHence the need for the macroscope and, with it, the understanding of dynamic\nsystems, systems with feedback but uncertainty.2 Hence too the need for the\nskills of seeing the big picture, of being empathetic, seeing from another’s\npoint of view, since one of the lessons of feedback and interdependence is\nthat of unforeseen or unexpected outcomes in both near but also distant parts\nof the system.\n\nNor is this rebalancing of the activities of the mind just a special pleading.\nFar from it. The diagram below illustrates the distribution of different types\nof system and how we might deal with it. It shows the mechanical (linear) and\nstatistical (disordered complexity) as very much in the tails of the\ndistribution of systems overall. The conclusion is obvious, the complex\niterative system is the general case, often termed ‘ordered complexity’.\n\n![simplelinear](image453.jpg)\n\nThe shock for some, for many actually, is the flipping of what appears to\nmatter most. Many people, adults as well as the young, still believe that the\nworld is basically ordered in a way which makes the ‘linear’ model dominant,\nthe common sense general case , and that there are exceptions and, yes,\nuncertainties. But people believe these can be taken ‘on advisement’,\nsomething to be conscious of but little more, the special case . Where there\nis order it is approximately mechanical, and statistics can be used if the\ndisordered must be looked at.\n\nThe graphic (see previous page) shows that the mechanical and the completely\ndisordered are in fact quite unusual, limited cases of real world systems, and\neven the graphic does too much to honour the tails (it’s illustrative only).\nAlmost all real world systems are ordered complexity: they are the bound-up,\nfeedback-rich, deeply interdependent systems that systems thinking tries to\nassist with.\n\nThis is an enormous challenge. In the real world an economics which has\naspirations to be a science will be based around the notions of non-linear\nsystems, will be embedded in flows of materials, energy and information (not\njust income and capital flows), will be managed not by crude levers or assumed\nto work perfectly – if only it were left uncluttered.\n\nThe economy, like all non-linear examples of ordered complexity, can be\ninfluenced, and because iterations, those feedback loops, have such a powerful\neffect it is more a matter of ‘setting the rules of the game’ and watching\ncarefully the many consequences, then adjusting variables, not one at a time\nbut simultaneously. And, of course, due attention to the ‘systemic’ column of\nthe table (in this chapter) makes a lot of sense in management science too,\nthough its application there is limited at present.  \n\n![ocean 2.jpg](image461.jpg)\n\nVisualisation shows ocean surface currents around the Gulf of Mexico and the\nCaribbean Sea during the period from June 2005 through December 2007. Source:\nNASA Goddard Centre.\n\nElsewhere in the book is a debate about efficiency (See Chapter 5): surely,\nmore efficiency is good when it comes to using fewer materials or less energy,\nbut a single focus on efficiency rather than on optimising the whole can have\nconsequences which are self-defeating. If overall efficiency brings falling\ncosts and prices as a result, a result, demand goes up or spending is\nliberated for other areas – the story of silver and its use in photography is\na case in point.\n\nDigital photography has taken over from photography based on film in the past\n15 years. The film was made using silver compounds and the demand for silver\nfor this purpose was 25% of the total demand at its peak in 2000. It is now\naround 9% and falling. This could be seen as a way of the photography industry\ngetting materials efficiency by substituting digits for silver. So what\nhappened to silver production and prices? The graph below is instructive.\nSilver prices and production went up despite this, much of it becoming coins\nand ‘investment’– hoarding bullion bars.\n\n![thePriceOfSilver](image468.jpg)\n\nA circular economy is surely to be discussed in a way which acknowledges the\nnotion of complex interactions, iteration (feedback) and uncertainty, and not\ndiscussed, say, on the basis of ‘recovering useful material from waste\nstreams’ or ‘recycling’ because it assumes these can be pretty self-contained\ncategories, i.e. it slips back into too narrow a conceptualisation.\n\nDesign is key to a circular economy, we are told. According to Nigel Cross, a\nleader in design thinking:  \n\n“Scientific problem solving is done by analysis, while designers problem solve\nthrough synthesis.”\n\nThis fits very well with a systems perspective.\n\nIf it’s a feedback-rich systems perspective it’s about the whole cycle and a\nkey question is whether interventions are enriching or depleting the overall\nsystem. A positive regenerative cycle is sought, without doubt.\n\n![mainLoops](image479.jpg)\n\nA little more about systems thinking basics. In short, it’s about iteration,\nwhich means feedback loops and their effect. There are two types of feedback,\nreinforcing (sometimes called positive feedback) and balancing (sometimes\ncalled negative feedback), coupled to uncertain starting positions and many\ninterrelated cycles at different scales. Fractals are the result of iterating\nwith positive and negative feedback at many scales with built-in uncertainty.\n\nThe result of iterations can be a durable system; it has coherence and\ncontinuity but in a wholly dynamic way. A machine might come to rest but a\ndynamic system can boom, bust or achieve a dynamic balance. It is never at\nrest. It need not be complicated: imagine a person standing on a plank over a\nlog, constantly adjusting to maintain their balance.\n\nDe Rosnay summarises:\n\n“A complex system is made up of a large variety of components or elements that\npossess specialised functions. These elements are organised in internal\nhierarchical levels (in the human body, for example, cells, organs, and\nsystems of organs). The different levels and individual elements are linked by\na great variety of bonds . Consequently there is a high concentration of\ninterconnections. The interactions between the elements of a complex system\nare of a particular type; they are nonlinear interactions.”\n\nDe Rosnay provided a number of diagrams in his book The Macroscope to\nillustrate different types of feedback:\n\n![aLinearProgression](image488.jpg)\n\nThe exponential curve (chart B), shows feedback in the form familiar in\ncompound interest, where the interest is rolled into the amount after each\ninterval and interest applied to the whole. Chart A, balancing feedback or\nchanging conditions – approaching limits – constrain or reduce the rate of\nincrease, e.g. world population in recent years is increasing at a decreasing\nrate.\n\nThe feedback graph below right shows this exponential reinforcing feedback.\nEvery iteration reinforces the trajectory, either towards explosion (boom!) or\ncollapse (bust). Think of bacteria in a petri dish, booming until there is no\nmore easy food and then eventually collapsing as food runs out.\n\nTo the left is the balancing or negative feedback. The starting position is\nvaried, either above or below a desired equilibrium, and the feedback moves it\ntowards the equilibrium – the thermostat might record that the room\ntemperature is below the set level and turn on the furnace. But only when the\nequilibrium is reached does the thermostat shut off the furnace and there is a\nlag in the system with some heat coming through, so the measure overshoots,\nand the process works in reverse; in turn, this overshoots and then recovers.\nA tendency towards the equilibrium is the result. But neither of these\nsimplifications is enough since starting conditions are not fixed in real\nsystems, and the interplay between positive and negative feedbacks is complex.\nThis uncertainty creates a topography, the pattern of a system’s activity over\ntime (see the Lorenz attractor drawing overleaf).\n\n![negativeFeedback](image495.jpg)\n\n![101769937-2 AW](image498.jpg)\n\nA topography – the Lorenz attractor. Photos: Thinkstock\n\n“It appears to be a general principle that pulsing systems prevail in the long\nrun, perhaps because they generate more productivity, power, and performance\nthan steady states or those that boom and bust... Operations that pulse\ntransform more energy than those at steady state.”\n\nIn observing living systems Odum and Odum3 in the above quote talk about the\ncycle of growth, maturity, decay and reordering as very dynamic, as a pulse,\nand that this is indeed a very effective arrangement.\n\nDe Rosnay wrote before the major developments around visualising ordered\ncomplexity which have followed the work of meteorologist Edward Lorenz and\nmathematician Benoit Mandlebrot, and the initial enthusiasm around ‘chaos\ntheory’, but after the use of early computer modelling, which had produced the\nseminal Club of Rome report The Limits to Growth . This publication set off\nthe debate around global resources, the effects of which are still playing out\ntoday. Complex global systems require modelling to draw out significance and\nthe results of systems iterating over time are patterns; they do not\nconstitute a result since none exists in the naïve sense, but over time\ntopographies or landscapes of states of the system do develop. It is\ninteresting to think that more powerful computing allowed us to see the\ndynamic world in a way we had not fully explored hitherto, yet it had been\nstaring us in the face all of the time. But even so… the classical thought\nstill seems to dominate. The weather forecast is still complained about\nbecause it is not accurate, yet it is helpful; it is giving a context and some\npossibilities. That is what’s possible. The government is supposed to be in\ncontrol of the economy so gets the blame when it doesn’t work out. But the\neconomy is not a machine and the effects of “leverage” are barely understood.\nthe government influences but is not in control. The events of 2007/8 in the\nfinancial markets were not supposed to happen because the risks had been\ncovered – a failure to understand that iterated systems will always experience\nunusual events, disproportionate events: propping up a bank’s insurance cover\nfor USD 300 million of risk is nothing if the liability looks like USD 300\nbillion.\n\nThe famous butterfly effect, where a butterfly’s wing disturbs an airflow in\nBishkek and this disturbance is for once iterated through a system so that\neventually it becomes a tornado in Japan, has been portrayed in recent\nadvertising as a series of escalating consequences, of mishaps in a\nneighbourhood which include - bizarrely - squirrels, cars and boats. This is a\nlinear sequence of events and nothing to do with a butterfly effect, which is\nwithin one system, the weather system. Regardless of the advertiser’s\nunderstanding or intention, this portrayal points to and perpetuates a deep\npopular misunderstanding.4\n\nHere is another useful diagram around different modes of thought. It is\nimportant to remember from de Rosnay that that it is not an ‘either/or’, just\na call for including them all, and understanding their value.\n\n![StaticVision](image510.jpg)\n\nAnd what value does it have for a revised economy, for a business, say?\n\nThe analytical, the reductionist, and ‘can do’ attitude often assumes the ends\nare given.\n\nThe role of the firm is to maximise return for its shareholders or, to be more\nrealistic, to maximise the opportunities for remuneration for its controlling\nmanagers. This relates to metrics like market share or sales as much as\nprofit. But, as this book seeks to show, the ‘smash and grab’ and ‘be the\nbiggest’, which work so well in a planet with effectively endless resources of\nmaterial and energy, and huge opportunities for labour productivity, simply do\nnot work when the easy surplus has gone. Prosperity requires a different\nemphasis: more co-operation, more symbiosis perhaps. A systems approach can\nhelp, as the requisites in such uncertain, game-changing times are innovation\nand creativity. In fact, a systems understanding reminds us that survival of\nthe fittest means the firm which fits best into its context – and context is\ninescapable. The strongest trees are in the healthiest forest.\n\n“The systemic approach catalyses imagination, creativity, and invention. It is\nthe foundation of inventive thought (where the analytical approach is the\nfoundation of knowledgeable thought). Tolerant and pragmatic, systemic thought\nis open to analogy, metaphor, and model – all formerly excluded from ‘the\nscientific method’ and now rehabilitated. Everything that unlocks knowledge\nand frees imagination is welcomed by the systemic approach; it will remain\nopen, like the systems it studies.”\n\nJoël de Rosnay\n\nThe use of the macroscope and the application of systems approaches, not least\nthe interplay between efficiency and resilience, between the risks of\nbrittleness (too much efficiency) and stagnation (too little, or too slow a\nflow) are becoming tools in themselves.\n\nSpeaking in 2009, Andy Haldane, the executive director for financial stability\nat the Bank of England, remarked: “Seizures in the electricity grid,\ndegradation of ecosystems, the spread of epidemics and the disintegration of\nthe financial system – each is essentially a different branch of the same\nnetwork family tree… Theoretical developments in statistical physics and\ncomplex systems may be able to help.”5  \n\nThere is a long way to go before the impacts of systems insights are fully\ndeveloped and the implications for education and training in this context are\nhuge. Progress is slow however. Over twenty years ago, educationalist Bela\nBenathy wrote:\n\n“Much of the learning we offer today is still grounded in the perceptions and\npractices of the bygone industrial age. In order to free education from the\nbondage of the past a major shift has to take place, not only in the way we\nperceive the role and function of education but also in the learning\nexperiences we should offer”6\n\nIt is freeing education from the bondage of the past and it is, by stages,\nsurely freeing business and industry, or even government from the bygone age\ntoo, the one dominated by the linear economy and a one-sided reductionist,\nlinear mindset. The two are profoundly interlinked and it will be fruitless to\nexpect business to lead on the basis of new opportunities and new business\nmodels if the vitality of its young intakes – from what is an ever more\nexpensive and extended education process – is still restricted by the residual\nprejudices and practices of Enlightenment 1.0.\n\nIt is for reasons like this that such an emphasis is laid on the shift from a\nlinear economy being part of a more general rethinking, be it prompted by\nmaterials and energy, price volatility and supply issues or not, and it is\nsomething which has been in process since the early cybernetics and systems\napproaches in MIT after World War 2. The rehabilitation of the systemic\nalongside the analytic is nothing less than an imperative, a consequence of\nhaving a civilisation built, so we are told, on science and reason and made\nvalid – lest we forget that some forms of political activity are more\nfeedback-driven than others – by active citizenship in a democracy. Systems\nthinking indicates that all participation matters.\n\n“A pattern is essentially a morphological law, a relationship among parts\nwithin a particular context. Specifically, a pattern expresses a relationship\namong parts that resolves problems that would exist if the relationship were\nmissing. As patterns express these relationships, they are not formulae or\nalgorithms, but rather loose rules of thumb or heuristics.” 7\n\nTo return to the first two of the short statements about systems: the key to\nunderstanding complexity is systems thinking (see Christopher Alexander quote\nChapter4). And the key to systems thinking is Pattern. Almost all real world\nsystems are ordered complexity and the results of ordered complexity are\nvisible everywhere in patterns, self-similarity at every level, nested\nsystems, fractals and these in turn have strong mathematical roots, and\nmodelling is essential to the unfoldment of meaning: the search for stable and\nunstable patterns, and the search for the periodicity of key events and cycles\nis important.\n\nThe third key to understanding patterns, according to Christopher Alexander,\nis in developing a language and this is often perceived as the hardest part.\nIt is true in music and economics and business as much as physics or maths.\nUnfamiliar terms abound but visually it is becoming easier to recognise:\nuncertain starting conditions, iteration, an interplay between reinforcing and\nbalancing feedback loops, bifurcation points and normal and strange\nattractors, topographies and entailment, emergent behaviour, the adaptive\ncycle. Equally the human is a pattern-seeking animal who can make judgements\nand ‘read’ buildings, spaces, streets and their relationship to one another\nintuitively and sense what ‘feels right’. It is perhaps no surprise that one\nof the greatest exponents of the role of this skill, of making explicit\npattern language, is an architect, Christopher Alexander, whose works A\nTimeless Way of Building and A Pattern Language have found a resonance and\nvalue with object-orientated computer programmers, educators and online\ncommunity developers.  \n\n“integrity is the essence of everything successful.”\n\nBuckminster Fuller\n\n![metalGlobe](image535.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Thinkstock\n\n\n5 CONSUMER TO USER\n\n“A fully referenced version of this chapter can be found in A New Dynamic:\nEffective Business in a Circular Economy (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013).\nIt is reprinted in this slightly amended form with the kind permission of\nWalter Stahel.”\n\nWritten by Walter R Stahel\n\n![](image550.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“ The business angle of a circular economy – higher competitiveness, higher\nresource security and material efficiency.”\n\nWalter R Stahel\n\n“Previous patterns of growth have brought increased prosperity, but through\nintensive and often inefficient use of resources. The role of biodiversity,\necosystems and their services is largely undervalued, the costs of waste are\noften not reflected in prices, current markets and public policies cannot\nfully deal with competing demands on strategic resources such as minerals,\nland, water and biomass. This calls for a coherent and integrated response\nover a wide range of policies in order to deal with expected resource\nconstraints and to sustain our prosperity in the long run.”\n\nThis statement by the European Commission (2011) analyses today’s resource\nefficiency and policy shortcomings. But it does not give solutions, it does\nnot address labour as a resource and it leaves out a number of other\nchallenges.\n\nEconomic actors in the circular economy have started to tackle many of these\nissues in a bottom-up approach by introducing new private sector business\nmodels of the circular economy, such as ‘reuse, repair and remanufacture\ninstead of replace’, and ‘selling goods as services’.\n\nThis includes an efficient use of labour as a renewable resource with a\nqualitative edge and “an economy as if people mattered” (E F Schumacher).\n\nThe multiple advantages of a circular economy were described decades ago by\nStahel and Reday, and have started to transcend into policy making, as for\ninstance in the 2008 EU waste directive. However, politicians’ reflexes are\nstill geared to overcome economic problems by promoting growth in the\nindustrial production economy – witness the ‘cash for clunkers’ initiatives in\n22 countries in 2010 – or by focusing on singular issues, such as\nenvironmental solutions. The quest for sustainable (holistic) solutions, which\nwould simultaneously address economic, social and environmental issues, is\njeopardised by the ‘silo’ structures of public administrations, academia and\nmany corporations. Stahel showed that most sustainable solutions are\nintersectoral and interdisciplinary and thus contradict existing regulations,\ndo not fit into academic career structures and demand a ‘new think’.\n\nThis chapter shows the advantages inherent in the circular economy and argues\nthat the shift to a circular economy can be accelerated by one simple shift in\npublic policy – adapting the tax system to the principles of sustainability by\nnot taxing renewable resources, including work. This will bring about a rapid\nexpansion not only of the circular economy for manufactured capital\n(infrastructure, equipment and goods) but equally of all other economic\nactivities based on stock optimisation and ‘caring’, such as health services,\neducation, organic agriculture, producing goods from such locally available\nrenewable materials as leather, wood and wool. Caring is also the foundation\nfor maintaining our cultural heritage.\n\n“The goods of today are the resources of tomorrow at yesterday’s prices.”\n\nWalter R Stahel\n\nA circular economy is about economics and profit maximisation\n\nThis section details the circular economy, its focus on stock optimisation,\nand its structure of three loops of different nature, and its five principles.\nIt explains why reuse and service-life extension of goods are the most\nprofitable and resource-efficient business models of the circular economy.\nFrom an economics view, maintaining value and performance of stock replaces\nvalue added of flow, and utilisation value replaces exchange value as the\ncentral notion of economic value.\n\nBefore 2012, few studies existed which analysed the economic benefits of a\ncircular economy on a national or supranational level. In time for the World\nEconomic Forum 2012 in Davos, the UK-based Ellen MacArthur Foundation\npublished a report which calculates that a circular economy (better design and\nmore efficient use of material) could save European manufacturers USD 630\nbillion a year by 2025. The report, produced by consultancy McKinsey, only\ncovers five sectors that represent a little less than half of the GDP\ncontribution of EU manufacturing, but still calculates that greater resource\nefficiency could deliver multi-billion Euro savings equivalent to 23 percent\nof current spending on manufacturing inputs.\n\nThe following abstract of The Product-Life Factor for the Mitchell Prize\nCompetition 1982 on ‘The role of the private sector in a sustainable society’\nis still an excellent summary of the circular economy:\n\n“The extension of the use-life of goods is, first, a sensible point at which\nto start a gradual transition towards a sustainable society in which progress\nis made consistent with the world’s finite resource base and, second, a\nstrategy consistent with an active and independent role for the private\nsector. Product-life, or the period over which products and goods are used,\ngoverns their replacement speed and thus the consumption of natural resources\nrequired for their manufacture and the amount of waste they create. Shortening\nproduct-life increases demand for replacement goods where these can be\nafforded. Extending product-life optimises the total life-span of goods and\nreduces depletion of natural resources and consequently waste; it builds on\nand increases wealth. Compared to fast-replacement, product-life extension is\na substitution of service activities for extractive and manufacturing\nIndustries, and a replacement of large-scale capital-intensive companies by\nsmaller, labour-intensive, locally integrated work units. The private sector,\nwhether R&D, manufacturing or finance, will find innumerable business\nopportunities in product-life extension activities – reuse, repair,\nreconditioning and recycling. Indeed, while increasing the number of skilled\njobs available and reducing our dependence on strategic materials, such\nactivities will provide the private sector with fresh impetus to make cheaper\ngoods available as part of a self-replenishing economy built on a closed-loop\npattern which allows a substitution of manpower for energy. In this way,\nunemployment and poverty which certainly aggravate the fundamental instability\nof the world economy might be substantially reduced. The private sector has,\nmoreover, resources and skills that uniquely qualify it to initiate this\ntransition towards a sustainable society where a balanced use of resources and\nother societal goals are achieved. Potential disincentives and obstacles can,\nwe believe, be overcome with appropriate education and fiscal and policy\nmeasures.”\n\nA circular economy is about stock optimisation. New metrics to measure changes\nin the quantity and quality of stock – wealth in the form of manufactured\ncapital stock, but also of health, education and skills – are needed to manage\nstock. We know how much money governments spend on building schools and\nemploying teachers, but we do not know if as a result the students are better\nprepared for life. The stock of buildings in a given country and their\nqualitative conditions (thermal insulation, annual energy consumption) are not\nknown, nor the residual service-life of infrastructure or technical equipment\n– which makes the evaluation of a national stock, and thus wealth management,\ndifficult.\n\nTurning the linear industrial economy into a loop or circular economy is, by\ndefinition, reducing the economic importance of resource extraction and waste\nmanagement, and also reducing the environmental impairment caused by these\nindustrial sectors. This change of focus from a linear throughput to a stock\nmanagement opens opportunities in three loops of different characteristics,\nwhich are described in this section and shown graphically in the figure on\npage 96:\n\n(a) a reuse and remarketing loop for goods,\n\n(b) a loop of product-life extension activities of goods, and\n\n(c) a recycling loop for molecules (secondary resources).\n\n![Rolls royce engine__highresimageTrent 1000 6_tcm239-18736.eps](image583.jpg)\n\nBuying performance - Rolls Royce engine and ‘power by the hour’. Photo: Rolls\nRoyce\n\nA circular economy is characterised by a number of principles which do not\nexist in the linear industrial economy, with the exception of principle 5.\nPolicymakers and economic actors of the manufacturing economy therefore do not\nrecognise them, nor their impact on the economy:\n\n![5Principles](image591.jpg)\n\nA circular economy is about material and resource sufficiency and efficiency\n\nThis section presents new metrics to measure material efficiency, and\nquantifies the reductions in material consumption and emissions that can be\nachieved in the circular economy.\n\nStahel showed that many different types of innovation to increase material\nefficiency exist in the circular economy, including technical, commercial and\n‘utilisation’ innovation. Technical innovation includes systems solution\ninstead of product innovation (e.g. Plane Transport Systems).\n\nA longer utilisation – long-life products, reuse and service-life extension of\ngoods and components – are one option. A more intensive use of goods is\nanother utilisation innovation to achieve a higher material efficiency, for\ninstance through shared utilisation (together: public transport) or serial\nutilisation of goods (one after another: washing machines in laundromats and\nrental cars). These options need a ‘new relationship with goods’; they were\nextensively discussed in the early 1990s but are only now finding a real\ninterest on both the supply and demand side, for example in car-sharing\ninitiatives.\n\nTwo distinctively different types of resource efficiency govern the circular\neconomy: loop 1 in the graphic opposite is about resource sufficiency in the\nreuse and service-life extension of manufactured capital, loop 2 is about\nmaterial efficiency in recycling materials (molecules).\n\nThe strategies of loop 1 are product specific – re-refining engine oil,\nsolvents and other products with a catalytic function need a different\napproach from the service-life extension activities for buildings or mobile\ndurable goods. The latter’s resource efficiency can be improved by modular\nsystem design, component standardisation and other eco-design (design for\nenvironment) approaches which are now known and well documented.\n\nThe strategies of loop 2 are material specific – metals, ceramic materials and\nplastic use processes of physical and chemical recycling often derived from\nmanufacturing processes, as well as new processes such as the depolymerisation\nof polymers. Materials with a low price/weight ratio, such as brick and\nconcrete waste from demolishing buildings, are best crushed, using mobile\nequipment, for reuse as recycled concrete on-site for new constructions.\n\nAll materials come with a multiple backpack (rucksack) of mining waste and\nenvironmental impairment. These backpacks differ for each material and are\nhighest for rare metals such as gold (with a backpack of 500,000), lowest for\nplastics (with a backpack of 0.1). Manufactured capital in the form of\ninfrastructure, buildings, goods and components has individual accumulated\nbackpacks of all the materials and energies they embed, which have to be\ncalculated individually in a circular economy.\n\nManufactured capital contains, in addition to the backpacks of the materials\nit is made of, the sum of the embodied energy and greenhouse gases (GHG)\nemissions as well as the (virtual) water of the manufacturing steps from basic\nmaterials into finished goods and up to the point of sale.\n\nThe reuse, remarketing and service-life extension activities in a circular\neconomy preserve the mining backpacks of water and energy inputs and related\nGHG emissions in the manufacturing chain up to the point of sale, which are\nembodied in the finished goods. In addition, they also prevent the\nenvironmental impairment of the material recycling and/or waste management\nprocesses.\n\nHigher resource efficiency also means reduced costs for material and energy\nprocurement, as well as for waste disposal, waste water treatment and\nemissions.  \n\nA circular economy is about an intelligent use of human labour– job creation\nin a regional economy\n\nThis section explains why human labour – work – is different from the other\nrenewable resources: creative, versatile and adaptable, able to be educated\nbut perishable if unused. The circular economy needs workers familiar with\npast technologies and thus offers jobs for ‘silver workers’.\n\n“Roughly three-quarters of all industrial energy consumption is associated\nwith the extraction or production of basic materials like steel and cement,\nwhile only about one-quarter is used in the transformation of raw material\ninto finished goods such as machines and buildings. The converse is true of\nlabour, about three times as much being used in the conversion of materials to\nfinished products as is required in the production of material.”\n\nCompared to the traditional manufacturing process, the labour input of the\ncircular economy is higher as (a) its economies of scale are limited in\ngeographic and volume terms, and (b) remanufacturing comprises additional\nsteps of dismantling, cleaning and quality control, which are absent in\nmanufacturing.\n\nNo estimations exist on the impact of a circular economy on a national labour\nmarket. Yet, employment is at the heart of the social pillar of\nsustainability.\n\nFurthermore, substituting labour for other resources is also an intelligent\nsolution for reasons which are inherent in human labour – it is the only\nrenewable resource with a qualitative characteristic. Work is the most\nversatile and adaptable of all resources, with a strong but perishable\nqualitative edge: (a) it is the only resource capable of creativity and with\nthe capacity to produce innovative solutions, and (b) human skills deteriorate\nif unused – continuity of work and continued learning are necessary to\nmaintain skills and upgrade capabilities. A person who has been unemployed for\na few years risks becoming unemployable.\n\nGovernments should give priority to human labour in resource use because a\nbarrel of oil or a ton of coal left in the ground for another decade will not\ndeteriorate, nor will it demand social welfare, and not taxing labour reduces\nincentives for black labour in the shadow economy and thus reduces the costs\nfor governments to monitor and punish abuses.\n\nOne of the objectives of a circular economy is to preserve the quality,\nperformance and value of the existing stock, wealth and welfare. This\ncertainly concerns manufactured capital, such as business, infrastructure,\nequipment and goods, and is a key criterion if selling performance (goods as\nservices).\n\nStock management needs statistics and metrics to measure the variations of\nwealth due to variations in the quality of stock. GDP is a flow metric,\nignoring whether our wealth – the stock – has increased as a result of the\nflow. This situation has been compared to a bath tub where only the inflow of\nhot and cold water is measured, but the outflow and the water level are\nignored.\n\nStock management includes people’s skills, education and health, knowledge and\nknow-how. Preserving culture is also linked to stock, not flow management;\nmaintaining UNESCO world heritage sites, museums and examples of technological\nachievements will all profit from the shift in taxation towards the non-\ntaxation of renewable resources. And caring is important in a high-quality\nworld: Stradivari instruments and expensive watches do not live forever by\ndesign, but through periodic remanufacturing, motivated by caring.\n\nCaring is a key characteristic of managing stock – caring for keeping up\nexisting values and qualities. Most car owners will credit the manufacturer of\ntheir vehicle for its continued reliable functioning, rather than their\nmechanic who provides the maintenance and repair services. A change in popular\nvalues and beliefs would multiply the perception of caring as a pillar of the\n(circular) economy. The fleet of vintage and old-timer cars in the UK could be\na point in case.\n\nRetained ownership of goods and embodied material provides future resource\nsecurity\n\nThis section looks at why selling goods as service, or performance, is the\nmost profitable and resource-efficient business model of the circular economy.\nBy focusing on systems solutions, it internalises the cost of risk and of\nwaste; by retaining the ownership of goods and the embodied resources, it\ncreates a corporate and national resource security for the future.\n\nMany economists have a problem accepting that this is a discontinuity in\ntraditional economic business models, and look at the sale of performance as\nan extension of the aftermarket.\n\nEconomic actors retaining material ownership over the full life of their\nproducts gain a future resource security but accept a liability for the\nperformance of their goods. Such a performance economy is based on the triple\nobjectives of more growth and more jobs in combination with substantially\nreduced resource consumption. This triple objective can be achieved through\nthree new business models: producing performance, selling performance and\nmaintaining performance over time.\n\nSuccess is measured using two new metrics in the form of absolute decoupling\nindicators: value per weight (USD/kg) and labour-input per weight (man-\nhours/kg).\n\nIn the performance economy, providing materials services can be achieved, for\ninstance, by building residential housing without capital. The developer rents\nall material and equipment from the manufacturers, say over a period of 50\nyears, who in return receive a yearly rent, financed by the rental income from\nthe apartments. As the manufacturers have to give a 50-year guarantee for\ntheir material, they will make sure that the most appropriate material is used\nand applied correctly.\n\nSelling performance differs according to the characteristics of products and\nis widely present in today’s economy: selling goods as services by operating\nprivate and public networks (railways, telecom, motorways, airports); chemical\nmanagement services and rent-a-molecule; energy management and integrated crop\nmanagement services; rental and operational leasing of real estate; selling\ncustom-made indoor climate for energy companies; private finance initiatives\n(known as PFIs) as a strategy to sell the utilisation of infrastructure\naccording to the ‘consumer pays principle’, such as the French and Italian\ntoll motorways; facility management of real estate and industrial plants;\ntextile leasing (professional attire, hotel and hospital linen). These are but\na few examples of the business model of selling performance, which also\ninclude rent-a-wash and chemical leasing, as well as renting fashionable\nconsumer goods (taking the waste out of fashion, see websites to rent ladies’\nhandbags).\n\nSelling performance is the most profitable and most material-efficient\nbusiness model of the circular economy, as it is built on exploiting the small\nloops. It focuses on utilisation optimisation and exploits resource efficiency\nas well as sufficiency and prevention options to gain financial advantages and\nhigher competitiveness. And it can be applied to all types of goods, see the\ntable on the next page.\n\nWater and energy savings, as well as waste prevention, now become profitable\nactivities that positively impact the financial bottom line of corporations.\nWhereas in the industrial economy, sufficiency and prevention options during\nthe utilisation phase of goods present a loss of income, and are thus\nundesirable.\n\nSelling performance, results, utilisation, services instead of goods means\nthat economic actors:\n\na) retain the ownership of goods and embodied resources; and,\n\nb) internalise the cost of risk and of waste.\n\nBy comparison, the industrial economy currently maximises its profit by\nexternalising the cost of risk and of waste. After the point of sale, it\noffers a warranty for a limited period of time and limited to manufacturing\ndefects.\n\nBy internalising the cost of risk and the cost of waste, economic actors\nselling performance have an economic incentive to prevent any future liability\nafter the point of sale.\n\n![KeyBusStrats](image636.jpg)\n\nRetaining ownership of their goods and embodied resources over the full life\nof their products gives corporations in times of rising resource prices (see\nnext section) a high future resource security and resource price guarantee as\nwell as a competitive cost advantage against throughput-based competitors,\nalong the lines of: “The goods of today are the resources of tomorrow at\nyesterday’s prices”.\n\nBuying performance is the demand-side strategy equivalent to selling\nperformance. Buying goods as services creates the same resource efficiency\nadvantages and can be regarded as a new green public procurement policy.\nBuying services instead of hardware is the preferred procurement option of\nparts of the US administration, such as NASA and the Pentagon, and has sparked\na number of innovative start-up companies. NASA now buys exclusively orbital\nservices from companies such as Space-X; the space shuttle was the last NASA-\nowned and -operated hardware to provide Earth orbit services.\n\nMichelin provides tyre-use services to all parts of the US armed forces: for\naircraft tyres, a fee per landing is charged; vehicle tyres are leased on a\nfixed fee per 100 miles. This service of ‘pay by the mile’ is now also offered\nto French and US fleet managers of lorries, using a business model of mobile\ntyre service workshops to make tyres last as long as safely possible.\n<http://www.michelintruck.com/michelintruck/services/MichelinFleetSolutions.jsp>\n\nPolicy for material efficiency: the role of sustainable taxation and\nsustainable framework conditions\n\nSustainable framework conditions should treat the circular economy on its own\nmerits, by:\n\na) Not taxing work – human labour as a zero-carbon renewable resource.\n\nb) Not charging VAT on such value-preservation activities as reuse, repair and\nremanufacturing, with the possible exception of technologic upgrading\nactivities. Major re-marketing activities, such as flea markets and eBay, are\nalready de facto exempt from VAT.\n\nc) Giving carbon credits for the prevention of GHG emissions, not only for\ntheir reduction. The small loops (graphic on page 96) constitute a prevention\nof GHG emissions (and waste) but receive no carbon credits under any of the\nexisting or planned GHG emission programmes, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which\nare based on the linear thinking of the industrial economy: first pollute,\nthen reduce pollution to receive carbon credits.\n\nSustainable politics should build on simple and convincing principles, such\nas: do not tax what you want to foster, punish unwanted effects instead. Also,\nit should promote sustainable solutions. Ideally, sustainable solutions create\nself-reinforcing virtuous circles, which guarantee their longevity.\n\nNot taxing renewable resources, including work, and taxing non-renewable ones\ninstead, creates virtuous self-reinforcing circles, by creating incentives to\nwork more (no penalty for higher income) and by creating more wealth from less\nnew resource input (increasing caring in resource use, including long-term\nresource ownership).\n\nSustainable taxation should reward desired developments and discourage\nunwanted effects of activities. In a sustainable economy, taxes on renewable\nresources, including work – human labour – are counterproductive and should be\nabandoned. The resulting loss of state revenue could be compensated by taxing\nthe consumption of non-renewable resources in the form of materials and\nenergies, and of undesired wastes and emissions. Such a shift in taxation\nwould promote and reward a circular economy with its local low-carbon and low-\nresource solutions. These are inherently more labour-intensive than\nmanufacturing because economies of scale in a circular economy are limited.\nTaxes on non-renewable resources could be charged in a similar way to today’s\nValue Added Tax (VAT), and also applied to imported goods.\n\nThe intelligent use of human labour has traditionally been discouraged through\ntaxation, whereas the waste of it has been ‘encouraged’ in some industrialised\ncountries through generous welfare. This shows that the role of work as a\nrenewable resource in the economy has been misunderstood by policymakers.  \n\nSummary\n\nThe linear industrial economy is best in overcoming situations of scarcity of\nfood, goods, shelter. But in a situation of saturated markets, a circular\neconomy is best suited to manage existing stock. In 1980, the market\npenetration for durable household goods in France was already above 90 percent\nfor all social classes. In Germany, since 1995, the number of cars scrapped\neach year has been roughly the same as the number of cars newly registered.\nContinued production in saturated markets constitutes a substitution of, not\nan addition to, wealth, at the cost of “intensive and often inefficient use of\nresources”.\n\nFor the last 100 years, resource prices for energy and material constantly\ndecreased; maintaining ownership of materials to assure access to future\nresources made little sense. At the beginning of the 21st century, this trend\nchanged, and it is expected that resource prices in the 21st century will\nconstantly increase – a theory formulated by experts at the European\nCommission and prominently by the asset manager Jeremy Grantham who called it\n“the big paradigm shift”. Resource security could, therefore, become a major\npolitical bone of contention; and economic actors maintaining resource\nownership will enjoy a certain guarantee of resource availability and price in\nthe future, at the same time providing resource security for nations.\n\nA sustainable tax policy of not taxing renewable resources, including work,\nconstitutes a very powerful lever to accelerate, boost and generalise the\ncircular economy and its positive impacts on resource security and regional\njob creation, while simultaneously reducing GHG emissions, as summarised in\nthe figure below.\n\n![resourcePriceParadigm](image657.jpg)\n\nSustainable taxation will promote the circular economy which in turn boosts\nresource security, regional job creation and the prevention of GHG emissions\n\nSource: W R Stahel (2011)  \n\n\n6 SOCIAL CAPITAL, MARKETS AND MONEY IN A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\n![](image669.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“The problems standing in the way of prosperity are an unsound … money system\nand a lack of understanding of the physical reality underlying economics. What\nnormally passes for economics is really the study of chrematistics.\nChrematistics is the study of commerce, of wants and demands and of how they\nexchange for one another. Or simply put, the study of buying and selling.”\n\nFrederick Soddy Wealth, Virtual Wealth, and Debt: The Solution of the Economic\nParadox (1926)\n\nFrederick Soddy was writing in the 1920s, a Nobel laureate in chemistry who\nturned his attention to economics. He was the first to really try and embed\nthe economy in materials and energy flows and understand what money is, as\nopposed to just what it does.\n\nHis characterisation of chrematistics – it never caught on as a word,\nunsurprisingly – as a description of just one part of the economy still seems\nvery useful. A study of circular economy is a study of the whole economy\nincluding the money system and the energetic and material resources upon which\nit is built. It is also a study of buying and selling, and so long as commerce\nis not confused with the economy, or the circular economy reduced to that\nstate, then conversations will be systemic. If what has been said about\nsystems is reasonable, then this will be ‘a good thing’.\n\nOne of the suggested criteria for a functioning circular economy is that of\neffective markets allocating resources between competing ends. Economies are a\ncomplex interplay of materials, energy and information. Effective markets are\nkey in the informational context. It is assumed that the rules under which\nmarkets operate are a social agreement of some kind and that thereafter\nfreedom to make contracts, to have access to or leave these markets and the\nfair enforcement of the rules within the agreement, is appropriate.\n\nIf prices are messages between buyers and sellers, public and private, then\nideally they should reveal the full costs of resources if they, and the\nmarkets of which they are an expression, are to be effective. Markets are very\nmuch seen as arbiters in decisions about resources and the argument is that if\nthey are not honest then they do not allocate resources rationally and their\nstatus is much diminished.\n\nUnfortunately, distortions in markets are all too common, in fact the norm,\nand their ability to tell the truth is often compromised. Examined from the\npoint of view of the circular economy – which emphasises the importance of\neffective (unhindered and adequate) flows for the ‘health’ of the whole system\n– two problem areas particularly stand out. Firstly, the effect of taxes on\nwages and salaries acting as a disincentive to using labour. The throughput\neconomy supports the replacement of labour by technology (and cheap energy) by\ntaxing income and writing off much capital depreciation in tax terms. But\nlabour is a plentiful renewable resource: indeed, if not used, labour skills\nand confidence decline, and labour overpriced in this way slows the transition\nto a circular economy. Increasing employment and the substitution of capital\nby labour is often listed as a regionally significant benefit to a circular\neconomy. Walter Stahel claims that a shift in taxation to non-renewables and\nwaste is one of the key drivers for change (See Chapter 5).\n\nTaxes could focus on the non-renewable, on unearned income and on waste\nstreams.\n\nA second problem is so-called perverse subsidies. This is where non-renewables\nand stocks of natural capital (soils, fisheries, groundwater, forests) are\nexploited at prices which are below market levels and which probably already\ninadequately reflect the true value of the resources. The size of these\nsubsidies is very significant globally. They are estimated at up to USD 1.1\ntrillion each year for resource consumption.1 (This estimate refers only to\ndirect cash payments to producers and so doesn’t take into account other\nindirect support mechanisms including tax measures and other government\ninterventions on prices received by producers and paid by consumers.) These\nsubsidies encourage the wasteful use of resources while reducing the savings\nfrom investments to use the resources more efficiently. Simply eliminating the\nsubsidies applied to the exploitation of many primary resources – in fossil\nfuels, mining, forestry, agriculture, fishing and banking – would enable\nprices better to reveal full costs.\n\nOther distorting factors in the ‘information’ space include regulation and\nlegislation which, for example, designate some materials ‘waste’ and deny\naccess to them for some more positive potential uses (see opposite).\n\nMore significantly, in the economy as a whole, there is the need to create\nadequate returns for short-term financing or short-term shareholder interests.\nOne paradox of the very successful linear economy has been increasing the\nshare of the economic pie going to unearned income (economic rents) which in\nturn are in search of good returns on onward investment. The amounts involved\nare huge and the funds are volatile, always looking for that slightly better\nmargin, which because of the large amounts involved is significant at\nfractions of a percentage point. Other examples of short-term activity include\nthe volumes traded on the stock exchange and foreign exchange markets per day.\n\nThe opportunities for investment and financing in a circular economy will need\nto be visible: the existence of appreciating material assets (long-term trend)\nand rising energy prices (resource-conserving activity) is indicative of the\nbenefits of maintaining capital(s) long term. This would then point to the use\nof novel financial (informational) instruments which are consonant with the\nrebuilding and maintenance of productive capital. Peripheral change in this\ndirection is the peer-to- peer lending like Zopa where lending on something\nwhich is less than ‘optimal’ from the traditional lender’s perspective is\nquite acceptable. Crowd funding through the web-based Kickstarter and\nIndiegogo is another direct funding relationship.\n\nSystem barriers, an example\n\nBBC Newsnight Investigation, 21 August 2013\n\nBBC 21 August 2013.

Man creates waste; pig eats waste and turns it into food\nthat we eat again. It is a perfect circle which means food has a use.\n\nFeeding catering waste to pigs has been banned across the European Union since\n2003.”\n\nAlmost all existing money flows are based on a kind of monetary monoculture –\nwith the interchangeability of euros, US dollars, pounds, yen and Swiss Francs\nfor example – and if the major operators in these currencies are disinclined\nto get involved in the physical processes of restoring capital and working on\nthe longer term then change seems overdue. Or put another way, if financial\neconomics work in one direction and a putative circular economy works in the\nopposite what results? If it is true that the financial system had a lot to do\nwith the building of the economy – by creating and advancing credit before\nproduction takes place – then it is a parent of the economy. Money is an\nactive part of the economic model rather than outside of it.\n\nWhat an injection of credit started can quickly go into reverse if economic\ngrowth – the means to pay off loans and interest – falters or shows. Therefore\nin a responsible role it would be a self-interested position for the financial\nsystem to channel significant investment into the transition towards the\ncircular economy if that is the best chance to maintain economic growth. The\nfinancial system then becomes the icing on the cake of the economy writ large\n(see diagram below).\n\n![cake](image704.jpg)\n\nThe financial system needs the productive economy to underwrite its existence\nand, in turn the productive economy rests on the societal (informal) economy\nand, finally, a resource and ecosystems services base. Optimising the system\nmeans recognising and working with these interdependencie.\n\nAnother complementary approach is to get some diversity into the financial\nmoney system. Money circuits are all pretty much short term and detached from\nthe productive side of the economy except that underlying asset values are\npumped up and firms become concerned about share prices and quarterly results\n– and governments about debt. There is a money shortage in effect.\n\nThis does not help the circular economy which is looking longer term to\nrebuild capital (natural and social) in order to design out waste and make\nmany more, and more varied, productive flows ‘work’ for enterprise. These are\nnot flows which typically attract financial capital and are hard to make work\nwhen demands for returns are short term and at interest.  \n\nThe lack of adequate ‘monocultural’ money flows clearly applies to some\ncategories of materials, particularly low-value ‘waste’ streams. Since the\ncurrent money monoculture is not serving circularity particularly well, one\nanswer is to sidestep it and create other money circuits. It is invoking the\ncircular economy principle that diversity = strength so the use of, for\nexample, complementary business-to-business currencies can be seen as a way of\nunblocking flows or extending them.\n\nA so-called ‘complementary currency’ sits alongside the official currency; it\nis a pure means of exchange and is not subject to the same speculation,\ninterest rates etc as official currencies. Specific complementary currencies\ncan energise circuits in materials flows which are circular but not\nnecessarily properly valorised or enabled using the monoculture currency. In\nthis way circularity is enhanced markedly, especially if positive interest is\navoided and taxes can be paid in this currency. The fit between innovations in\ncurrencies and funding, the need to give value to hitherto neglected materials\nflows and to invest in resources longer term, which so much characterises the\ncircular economy, is another welcome synergy.\n\nComplementary currencies can be tied to activities at many scales for example\ncommunity gardening and food production (see the Torekes2 in Ghent) or to\nspent brewery grains, chicken manure, or more generally, as is the case with\nthe Bristol Pound3 .  \n\nPeer-to-peer payments between mobiles are becoming commonplace in a few\ncountries – the M Pesa in Kenya is an example. Sixty per cent of Kenyans now\nuse their mobile phone for banking transactions and 64% of Kenyans send or\nreceive money locally through their mobile phones, according to a study by the\nKenya Bankers Association.5 In Afghanistan a peer-to-peer payment of police\nsalaries revealed huge corruption in the earlier system of cash payments and\nhelped rebuild confidence – a form of social capital of course.\n\n“ The potential and adaptability of social currency innovations are part of\nthe shift from the Industrial Age to a Post-Industrial or Information Age.\nMost of them would not have appeared without cheap computing power becoming\navailable. This also explains the impressive growth from a handful to\nthousands of such currency systems worldwide in the past two decades. Mounting\nevidence from these practical experiments in diverse communities around the\nglobe demonstrates that complementary currencies can have significant positive\nimpacts on communities that use them. 4 ”\n\nBUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS COMPLEMENTARY CURRENCY\n\nImagine grain is sold in the normal way to a brewery. It makes use of the\ngrain but 80% of the physical material is still existent at the end of the\nbrewing process, but this has a low value conventionally speaking.\n\nIntroduce a brewery feedstock waste currency. The brewery now has a product\nfor sale in, let’s call it, ‘Points’. A mushroom grower buys the spent grains\nwith Points and knows that the bio-substrate left after mushroom growing on it\ncan also be sold, in ‘Points’ (the mushrooms are sold conventionally). Then\nthe substrate is used by another farmer as a soil improver to fertilise and\nrebuild soils. The burying of such bio-substrate in excess of what this other\nfarmer needs to produce a crop like last year (the capital formation) can be\noffset against taxes. All along the chain, taxes can be paid in Points to some\ndegree so that the creation of the ‘Points’ is extinguished ready for another\ncycle. Thus a business-to-business complementary currency eases and encourages\nthese material flows, and its circulation is ensuring that the soils are\nrebuilt – rebuilding natural capital.\n\nPerson-to-person loans or crowd funding through the web-based Kickstarter or\nIndiegogo are doing the job of bringing the economy down to the individual and\ncommunity once more by lowering barriers to access. Surely it matters what the\nproject is about if it is a part of a circular economy. But a circular economy\nis a description of a more free-flowing, effective economy where materials\nenergy and information are more abundant. Finance is a part of that, as is\ninnovation, as is working at multiple scales. A linear economy has\ncentralising characteristics – a circular economy has distributive ones – at\nleast that is the aspiration. And with all this access to tools, to materials,\nto each other and the freeing up of education, money and finance, this\nabundance succours participation and it succours democracy. A circular economy\nis not primarily about technical materials and recycling/recovering them while\nmoving to renewables. It is a different way to see the economy which includes\nthe material but is not limited by it.\n\nIn a circular economy materials can cycle in either pathway – biological or\ntechnical – and will return to increase, or at least maintain, the natural and\nperhaps social capital upon which long-term prosperity depends. It is that\n‘perhaps’ which exercises some people most. What does the circular economy\nimply for the social capital side of the economy?\n\nSocial capital is a representation of what resources reside in the\nrelationships between people in various communities. Social capital is those\nnon-money exchanges and mutualities which so enrich our lives and weave some\nof the fabric of what we term civilisation. Civilisation is based, after all,\non the word ‘civis’ or citizen, but set in a collective context of other\ncitizens. We create civilisation by participating and routinely contrast it\nwith anarchy (no order) or tyranny (no freedom). Civilisation is a form of\nordered complexity. It is what we value the most and yet find so easy to\ndestroy.\n\nA circular economy, drawing from living system analogies for its rationale,\ncreates wealth by creating effective flows and maintaining or increasing\ncapital. These flows are distributed across the scale because it is a\ncondition of being resilient: too much efficiency brings brittleness, and too\nlittle, stagnation. This increased wealth that has been created may well\ntranslate into more employment in some sectors – although the effects of the\ndrive for efficiency continue to dislodge employment elsewhere. But other\nchanges are in play and these relate to the use of assets and the general\ntrend towards a devolved economy. As described in Chapter 8, information\ntechnology, which has enabled both sharing and circular materials flows, has\nbeen a key to building social capital in new guises.  \n\nA circular economy sits well with the performance economy and as Walter Stahel\nhas pointed out extended product-life and the loops of maintenance, repair,\nrefurbishment etc. are potentially profitable activities. As Chapter 7\nillustrates, the sharing economy is about putting users and assets into a more\neffective relationship. So many assets are underused and so many new\nrelationships can be and have been created amongst people through social\nnetworks like eBay, Freecycle, Airbnb or couch surfing. This rebuilding of\nsocial relationship is said to be a prime motivator for many people involved\nin these IT-based networks.\n\nEconomies are in transition, and young people bridge the traditional and\nmodern while bringing their own distinctive perceptions but it is access to a\nglobal communications, not just physical resources, that will accelerate\ntransition quickly and play a role in enhancing social capital.\n\nInformation technology is central to finding markets for niche and local\nproducts or materials, aggregating small suppliers to meet demand and\ncontrolling variables – in food growing, in manufacturing and distribution. It\nis enabling small-scale businesses with a global presence, small-scale\nrenewables with better returns, accessing assets, enabling sharing and\nrebuilding community relationships. IT is also enabling exchange and new\nfunding sources. Social capital is built through interaction and these tools\ncreate networks in novel ways.  \n\nSo there is a part of what a full circular economy is about which speaks to\nthe notion of the value, and perhaps inevitability, of a more devolved economy\nthat builds social capital – a thriving, regenerative economy that literally\nrevitalises the underemployed resources, networks and poor neighbourhoods. It\nachieves this by emphasising tighter loops – maintenance, refurbishment,\nrepair, a shift to services (customer/user care) – as well as the provision of\naccess to assets on a use, not ownership, basis. It sounds contemporary but it\nisn’t – allotments were always a great idea, but belonged to a more communal\nera – now, with added self-created spending power (complementary currencies)\nand more emphasis on capturing waste as food and thinking creatively and\nentrepreneurially it’s a different world. It all used to be a lot easier when\nexisting social capital was based on shared factories, walkable and shared\npublic spaces and extended families but, after their decline, it may fall to\ninformation technology and human ingenuity and imagination to be the most\nimportant tools for rebuilding social capital.\n\nThe circular economy is a model for a different economy, but it has no obvious\npolitical caucus: it does not promise an end to poverty through\nredistribution, on the one side nor does it assume that market liberalism is\nkey. As economist Eric Beinhocker and Nick Hanauer noted.5\n\n“For decades we’ve been told there are only two choices: free market\nneoliberalism, or redistributive socialism. In crude terms we can have growth\nor fairness, but not both… We believe this is a false choice and neither is a\ngood description of either how economies actually work, nor how they should\nwork.”\n\nThis is different answer to ‘how’ begs a wider reflection on what might be\npossible. What the model of the circular economy implies is that increased\nprosperity can come from circularity, stock maintenance and additional flows.\nEven that makes it sound rather rigid. Its base is more evolutionary than\nmechanistic. It is an economy which is assuming that being more productive and\nenabling more production – so long as it fits the system – matches Braungart\nand McDonough’s aspirations to ‘do good’, rather than ‘ do less harm’.\nEncompassing the idea of prospering long term and taking insights from living\nsystems this is also an economy which works at all scales. It is highly\nparticipative and provides multiple benefits. Even the word ‘prosperity’ would\nneed to be rewritten to better match the desired outcome of people’s access to\nsolutions not objects. Beinhocker and Hanauer put it like this:\n\n“We… develop a view of the economy as an evolutionary system of cooperative\nproblem solving (…). We define prosperity as ‘solutions to human problems’ and\nargue that cooperation is the key to solving more and more complex problems\nthus increasing prosperity.\n\nFor them the debate is about a productive regenerative economy which is\ninclusive - accessible. Our political efforts should be about debating the\nbest ways to give people the capabilities to be included in the economy and\nthen how to include them.”\n\n![](image735.jpg)\n\nHyde Park tollgate\n\nThe IT revolution is enabling circularity and the rethinking of materials,\nenergy and credit flows. It is also one key to rebuilding social capital,\nsocial networks. It has lowered barriers to access to the tools of self-\nreliance and community building and has opened up new possibilities for\noperating on a variety of scales and in new competitive or collaborative\ncombinations. In money and finance, energy, manufacturing, materials use,\ndesign, education, creative arts, communications, urban food production: it’s\nall changing. The net result can be lowered energy thresholds, effective\nmaterials flows, easy and affordable access to assets and tools of all kinds.\nThe promise is of abundance not scarcity. It is not so much a case of\nchallenging existing linear businesses – like centralised large-scale fossil\nfuel-based utilities – as doing an end run around them and growing from there.\n\nAll is not necessarily rosy. Rescuing underutilised renewable resources,\nespecially labour, can be counterpointed with the use of information\ntechnologies to control a flow and extract rent from it. An analogy is the\ntollbooth, where traditionally access to a road was controlled and charged in\nexcess of that required to maintain the asset. ‘Rent-seeking’ opportunities\ncould arise if certain materials were able to be tracked and recovered and the\nmarket dominated by few suppliers. Such materials would become a new asset\nclass. Other examples include restricted access to certain professions in\norder to keep income high, excessive copyright and IP restrictions or keeping\nbuildings unused to protect rental values.\n\nA circular economy may be an economy that favours the ‘makers’ not the\n‘takers’, based on Michael Lind’s observations7 about the USA where he sees\nthat the existing situation favours rent seekers (takers) rather than profit-\nseeking entrepreneurs in the industrial economy (makers).\n\nIn contrast to the tollbooth analogy, a circular economy has more of the\nlighthouse about it – the asset is available and at no or low cost to the\nuser. An iconic example of course, but one that has a useful resonance even in\nthe era of global positioning systems.  \n\n\n7 THE SHARING ECONOMY\n\n![](image751.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“Sharing economy business models emerge from our oldest instincts as humans –\ncooperation, sharing, generosity, individual choice and flexibility. Models\ninclude renting, bartering, loaning, gifting, swapping and forms of shared\nownership such as cooperative structures. Many of the most popular models are\nbased on what is called a ‘two-sided market’ which is a market where an\ninformation technology-enabled platform is developed, built and maintained by\na third party but the function of the platform is to enable sharing economy\nactivities. Most sharing economy structures are enabled by new technologies of\nconnection.”\n\nWikipedia: Collaborative Consumption\n\nIn the last part of Chapter 6 the key to the rise of the circular economy was\nsaid to turn on the coming together of a number of technologies and trends.\n\nSome are opportunities, some are threats. In the economy writ large – and by\nthat is meant the economy as it relates to energy, materials and information,\nnot just financials – The main trend is price volatility. Materials and energy\ncosts rose rapidly after 2004 to peak in 2008 and then after a sharp slump\nrose towards 2012 before sinking down again, back to prices seen in the period\naround 2004/05. It is unlikely to be permanently lower due to increasing\npopulation and continuing industrialisation and price spikes can be expected.\nThe graphs show the volatility of the prices movement for crude oil and\ncopper.\n\n![oilPriceGraphs](image761.jpg)\n\nThe third trend is the end of cheap and easy credit. Since the mid-1970s wages\nand salaries as a share of the economic pie (see chapter 2) in the developed\nworld have been pretty fixed while productivity soared. The results of this\nstagnation were that not all that was produced was able to be bought by\nworkers with declining savings without the liberal availability of credit.\nEven so, the returns to manufacturing per se declined as overproduction took\nhold. The problem was no longer how much it cost to make sports shoes, but how\nmuch it cost to market them successfully in saturated consumed-out markets\ndemanding novelty, brand and shopping experience. As we know, this credit\nexpansion was curtailed in 2007/8 and the consequences of this downturn have\nnot been resolved despite upticks in financials and assets in the last few\nyears.\n\nOverproduction, inadequate credit, expensive materials and energy, rising\nunemployment and falling public spending (not to mention massive increases in\nthe middle class in Asia) spell change. Business as usual looks like a\nradical’s manifesto. It is also a part answer to those who ask ‘why would I\nvote for a sharing or circular economy?’ – Why would you vote for a linear\none?\n\nMeanwhile, information technology enables us to increasingly track ‘stuff’ and\nits use. This might be raw materials but it might be infrastructure. It might\nbe buses and trains and taxis or it might be the legacy of a hundred-odd years\nof stuff, the assets on the ground and under the ground, in our cities and\ntowns and suburbs. IT also allows us to track each other, since there are more\nmobile phone accounts than toilets on the planet. Not only is stuff now\nconnected to us – there is an app for that! – it is increasingly connected to\nother stuff, the internet of things: where fridges adjust their cycling to\nenergy price information, where aero engines monitor themselves and schedule\ntheir own maintenance1 and where (electric) cars store electricity from the\ngrid in their lithium batteries. And connection is increasingly about now :\nwhere fishing catches are sold as they are hauled up from the sea or where\nUber lets you summon a classy taxi ride from your smartphone on the street\ncorner with the press of a button. All paperwork waived.\n\nIn finance, there is the crowd funding, the Kickstarter and Indiegogo, plus\nthe Zopa peer-to-peer lending (see also Chapter 6). In design there are the\nopen-source arrangements and crowd sourcing and collaborative everything, even\nmanufacturing, from rapid prototyping through 3D printing, laser and water\ncutters, to hacking of components and subassemblies for repurpose (see Chapter\n8). In the industrialised world it feels as if mass production was so very\nlinear-economy, so very much of its time. All the rest is bound for the\ncircular where custom experiences, quality of life and access over ownership\nis not only acceptable but desirable, easier and could be cheaper. And\nprofitable. Perhaps even necessary post-2008 and the Great Recession.\n\nThe human and business energy behind the information technology-driven\n‘sharing economy’ helps save money, helps create new income flows from assets\nheavily underutilised and provides a speculative bubble all of its own in\nsocieties with too much money chasing too few returns. However, the sharing\neconomy has to do much more. It has to fit seamlessly with the physical and\nenergetic ‘rules of the game’ of the circular economy so as to create a\npositive cycle of development which restores natural capital as well as social\ncapital. In doing both of these, the sharing economy stands a chance of\nthriving in the long term.\n\nThe basics of circularity are very easy. Materials are of two types ideally:\nthose which are consumed and rebuilt through the biosphere safely – biological\nmaterials or ‘nutrients’, and those which cycle at high quality for longer in\nthe technical nutrients cycle (as products primarily, providing services, the\nmain focus for ‘access over ownership’ of course). What point is there in\nhaving complex plastics or alloys, however ‘shared’, if they are only capable\nof downcycling – detouring to the dump through reduced quality – or being\ncompletely trashed as not worth the reprocessing? The sharing economy is not\nfor the long term if materials losses are ignored and merely pushed off into\nthe future. So the emphasis is on design, as always. The sharing economy must\nfit a circular economy by intention, not happenstance. It needs to address\ndesign for disassembly (which also means easy repair, upgrade, and finally\ndisposal). The sharing economy must also consider design for waste = food\nmaterials pathways, so that new income streams and ingenuity can apply here\ntoo, and less new material is required. In the producer value chain, the\nhighest energy and materials costs are in mining and manufacturing so the\nsharing economy gets a plus for contributing to extended product use. With\neffective materials cycles, energy costs keep falling and the threshold to\nusing renewables becomes lower – and being more localised and labour\nintensive, additional jobs are created. At least for a time.\n\nMany proponents of the sharing economy point out that it is building, or\nrebuilding, a sense of community. It is therefore rebuilding social capital\nand encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. But if it can also work on\nthe biological materials side, particularly, to rebuild natural capital\n(soils, forests, fisheries and associated ecosystem services) then it will\nallow more production and consumption overall. Increased natural capital then\nleads to increased flows.\n\nLANDSHARE\n\nIt began with the tiny seed of an idea – and it’s growing and growing.\n\nLandshare brings together people who have a passion for home-grown food,\nconnecting those who have land to share with those who need land for\ncultivating food. Since its launch through River Cottage in 2009 it has grown\ninto a thriving community of more than 55,000 growers, sharers and helpers.\n\nIt’s for people who:\n\n​• ​ Want to grow their own fruit and veg but don’t have anywhere to do it\n\n​• ​ Have a spare bit of land they’re prepared to share\n\n​• ​ Can help in some way – from sharing knowledge and lending tools to\nhelping out on the plot itself\n\n​• ​ Support the idea of freeing up more land for growing\n\n​• ​ Bangladeshi women teach a community group in Bradford (UK) about\nvegetable growing Photo: Photofusion/Rex\n\nIt will be noticeable that the idea of limiting consumption and production as\nan aesthetic does not feature in a circular economy model per se , since if\nall production and consumption is ‘doing good’ rather than an exercise in\n‘doing less harm’ – and it is increasingly powered by renewables – then stuff\nis not a problem. Discussing ‘stuff’ doesn’t need to come from some kind of\nmoral standpoint. However, GDP – as we measure it now – could be undermined as\nwe do more for ourselves and enjoy extended use periods and fuller use of\nassets and begin to eradicate waste. This really says more about the bias in\nthe measure of GDP towards throughput than anything more profound. It would be\nabsurd to adjust the economy to an increasingly inadequate metric. If polity\nand the public are fixated on GDP going up, then a sharing and circular\neconomy could bring slower growth in the traditional sense or even falls, but\nif the measure of progress integrates ‘well-being’ or something more\nconsidered then the picture brightens considerably.\n\n![growthInEconomy](image786.jpg)\n\nSource: Centre for Sustainable Economy\n\nThe harnessing of these materials flows across the various scales of the\neconomy means that a sharing economy at the local and small scale could become\nmore profitable not only due to the use of information and communications\ntechnology but as a consequence of the impacts on reduced transport,\nindustrial (fossil fuel-based) agriculture and on centralised food processing.\nThis then doubly reinforces the value of local or regional production and\nconsumption. An example is the rise of urban agriculture including rooftop and\ndaylight-less interior hydroponic systems, as well as the more traditional\nallotments. Small players are beginning to access their potential customers\ndirectly or by using aggregators (people who bring together small-scale\nproducers and products and deliver sufficient scale for the bigger players).\nNo doubt there are several apps for this already.\n\n“Last night 40,000 people rented accommodation from a service that offers\n250,000 rooms in 30,000 cities in 192 countries.”\n\nThe sharing economy also brings into focus the more complete valuing of\nmaterials, products or what were formerly simply waste streams. From Freecycle\nto eBay, this stuff can find a market now at low transaction costs. But, as\nBartercard and other various complementary currencies have shown, this market\ncan be creatively extended . As we saw in Chapter 6, money is primarily a\nmatter of social agreement: it’s one of our greatest inventions. Money is\nneeded to facilitate exchange primarily and there is no need for a\nmonopolistic money system, nor to have banks as the only lending institution.\nThis is evidenced by the rise in complementary currencies and in peer-to-peer\nlending. Sharing in a circular economy? Well, the clue is of course in the\nname. Alongside rebuilt capital, in a circular economy there need to be\neffective flows and the use of complementary currencies can be directed at\nfreeing up blockages in the flow of materials, products or services not well\nserved by existing arrangements. It could be complementary currency for\nbrewers’ spent grains (see chapter 6) or for education: the principle is one\nof enabling effective exchange and therefore flows. To have a flow requires\ncapital and in the monetary sphere this is credit. The aim, as always, is\nabundance not shortage.\n\nON THE INTERNET, EVERYTHING IS FOR HIRE\n\nLast night 40,000 people rented accommodation from a service that offers\n250,000 rooms in 30,000 cities in 192 countries. They chose their rooms and\npaid for everything online. But their beds were provided by private\nindividuals, rather than a hotel chain. Hosts and guests were matched up by\nAirbnb, a firm based in San Francisco. Since its launch in 2008 more than 4m\npeople have used it – 2.5m of them in 2012 alone. It is the most prominent\nexample of a huge new sharing economy, in which people rent beds, cars, boats\nand other assets directly from each other, coordinated via the internet.\n\nYou might think this is no different from running a bed-and-breakfast, owning\na timeshare or participating in a car pool. But technology has reduced\ntransaction costs, making sharing assets cheaper and easier than ever – and\ntherefore possible on a much larger scale. The big change is the availability\nof more data about people and things, which allows physical assets to be\ndisaggregated and consumed as services. Before the Internet, renting a\nsurfboard, a power tool or a parking space from someone else was feasible, but\nwas usually more trouble than it was worth. Now websites such as Airbnb,\nRelayRides and SnapGoods match up owners and renters; smartphones with GPS let\npeople see where the nearest rentable car is parked; social networks provide a\nway to check up on people and build trust; and online payment systems handle\nthe billing.\n\nJust as peer-to-peer businesses like eBay allow anyone to become a retailer,\nsharing sites let individuals act as an ad hoc taxi service, car-hire firm or\nboutique hotel as and when it suits them. Just go online or download an app.\nThe model works for items that are expensive to buy and are widely owned by\npeople who do not make full use of them. Bedrooms and cars are the most\nobvious examples, but you can also rent camping spaces in Sweden, fields in\nAustralia and washing machines in France. As proponents of the sharing economy\nlike to put it, access trumps ownership.\n\nRachel Botsman, the author of a book on the subject, says the consumer peer-\nto-peer rental market alone is worth USD 26 billion. Broader definitions of\nthe sharing economy include peer-to-peer lending (though cash is hardly a\nspare fixed asset) or putting a solar panel on your roof and selling power\nback to the grid (though that looks a bit like becoming a utility). And it is\nnot just individuals: the web makes it easier for companies to rent out spare\noffices and idle machines, too. But the core of the sharing economy is people\nrenting things from each other.\n\n….this ‘collaborative consumption’ is a good thing for several reasons. Owners\nmake money from underused assets. Airbnb says hosts in San Francisco who rent\nout their homes do so for an average of 58 nights a year, making USD 9,300.\nCar owners who rent their vehicles to others using RelayRides make an average\nof USD 250 a month; some make more than USD 1,000. Renters, meanwhile, pay\nless than they would if they bought the item themselves, or turned to a\ntraditional provider such as a hotel or car-hire firm. (It is not surprising\nthat many sharing firms got going during the financial crisis.) And there are\nenvironmental benefits, too: renting a car when you need it, rather than\nowning one, means fewer cars are required and fewer resources must be devoted\nto making them.\n\nFor sociable souls, meeting new people by staying in their homes is part of\nthe charm. Curmudgeons who imagine that every renter is Norman Bates can still\nstay at conventional hotels. For others, the web fosters trust. As well as the\nbackground checks carried out by platform owners, online reviews and ratings\nare usually posted by both parties to each transaction, which makes it easy to\nspot lousy drivers, bathrobe-pilferers and surfboard-wreckers. …\n\nPeering into the future\n\nThe sharing economy is a little like online shopping, which started in America\n15 years ago. At first, people were worried about security. But having made a\nsuccessful purchase from, say, Amazon, they felt safe buying elsewhere.\nSimilarly, using Airbnb or a car-hire service for the first time encourages\npeople to try other offerings. Next, consider eBay. Having started out as a\npeer-to-peer marketplace, it is now dominated by professional power sellers\n(many of whom started out as ordinary eBay users). The same may happen with\nthe sharing economy, which also provides new opportunities for enterprise.\nSome people have bought cars solely to rent them out, for example.\n\nIncumbents are getting involved too. Avis, a car-hire firm, bought a share in\nZipCar, a car sharing rival. So do GM and Daimler, two carmakers. In the\nfuture, companies may develop hybrid models, listing excess capacity (whether\nvehicles, equipment or office space) on peer-to-peer rental sites. In the\npast, new ways of doing things online have not displaced the old ways\nentirely. But they have often changed them. Just as internet shopping forced\nWalmart and Tesco to adapt, so online sharing will shake up transport,\ntourism, equipment-hire and more.\n\nA major worry is regulatory uncertainty… Will room-renters be subject to hotel\ntaxes, for example? In Amsterdam officials are using Airbnb listings to track\ndown unlicensed hotels. In some American cities, peer-to-peer taxi services\nhave been banned after lobbying by traditional taxi firms. The danger is that\nalthough some rules need to be updated to protect consumers from harm,\nincumbents will try to destroy competition. People who rent out rooms should\npay tax, of course, but they should not be regulated like a Ritz-Carlton\nhotel. The lighter rules that typically govern bed-and-breakfast\nestablishments, it is argued, are more than adequate.\n\nThe sharing economy is the latest example of the internet’s value to\nconsumers. This emerging model is now big and disruptive enough for regulators\nand companies to have woken up to it. That is a sign of its immense potential.\nIt is time to start caring about sharing.\n\n© The Economist Newspaper Limited, London (2013) 1\n\nThe general sense of rebuilding capitals (social, natural and financial),\nmaking effective flows of services or cascading materials through the systems\nto provide value at all scales, benefits from at least one fairly recent\ndevelopment which is valued by many advocates of circular and sharing alike.\nThis is a systems worldview. The emphasis on feedback, access over ownership,\nthe interaction of the parts not the parts themselves, the multiple and\ncomplex interdependencies, the valuing of all flows, the notions of open\nsource, crowd funding, social networks, even the idea of ‘pop-up’ stores and\nother transient events speaks of fluidity and feedback within a complex and\ndynamic system. The sharing economy for many is primarily a revival in a new\nguise of the social capital building of neighbourhood and community.\n\nThe earlier Enlightenment 1.0 view was of a machine-like world of fixed\nrelationships, of understand, predict and control. With it came\nstandardisation, mass societies, mass production and individual ownership, of\nbroadcast media and schooling by transmission (“sit up, lad, and listen”).\nThis is being overthrown – intellectually by the recognition in the age of\ncomputing that most real world systems are non-linear, full of feedback. These\nsystems reveal ordered complexity, not predictable results, that in human\nterms everyone contributes to and everyone can and does have an effect on\nthem.\n\nPerhaps through the sharing economy we are beginning to accept uncertainty,\nmake arrangements based on transience and travelling light. Perhaps this in\nturn just mirrors the economic uncertainties, a way of adapting in a world\nwhere the prospect of regular, full-time, well-compensated, long-term work is\nfading for the majority.\n\nIn the complementarity of sharing and circular there exists this overarching\nsense of the dynamic system in its contemporary understanding – systems\nthinking. It brings both comfort and inspiration. This IS the way things work.\nIn the circular economy the notion of insights from living systems is\nparticularly important as they are perhaps the most refined of all non-linear\nsystems groups.\n\nOne thing about systems approaches is that they are not grounded in direct,\ndetailed interference. Yes, some products or materials might be arbitrarily\nprohibited or highly regulated – narcotics or fissile materials come to mind –\nbut William McDonough argues that regulation is often just an attempt to\ncompensate for, or limit the consequences of, poor and inadequate design.\n\nInstead think of products embedded in enabling systems, where ‘everything is\nfood.’ An analogy is a garden where nurturing, weeding and seeding might be\nthe essential activities but the basic rules around the interaction of the\nparts, the rules of the game, if you like, are the real enablers.\n\nWhether a large established firm or an insurgent start-up based in the agile\ndigital domain, changing the business models appears to be the key. Adapting a\nbusiness to ‘roundput’ is the touchstone for success even while the\nenvironment is unsettled, possibly hostile to it. Its success might also be\npart of rising expectations that more people can find a productive place in a\ncircular economy than a linear. More people can participate not least because\na sharing economy and designing for the full cycle of product and materials\nlife means cooperation as well as competition. If there is no ‘away’ in\ncircular economy – as in throwing things away – there is no exclusion either.\n\nJocelyn Blériot adds a note of caution: the whole model of sharing/renting –\nwith communications channels included – makes a lot of sense. One can see its\npotential … provided it’s taken seriously enough to reach critical mass and\nbecome a second nature for wrongly named ‘consumers’. To put things a bit\nbluntly, passing on a disused hair dryer on Freecycle and subsequently\nboasting about having embraced the ‘collaborative consumption’ philosophy at a\ndinner party simply will not do. Also, despite the obvious logic of that model\nthere are psychological hurdles linked to ownership that need to be dealt\nwith. Our relationship with objects is not always merely a utilitarian one,\nand as philosopher Jean Baudrillard pointed out in The system of objects\n(published in 1968) there is a strong symbolism to be taken into account as\nwell. Developing this idea, he went on to examine our model in The consumer\nsociety: myths and structure in 1970 – his analysis was groundbreaking at the\ntime, and a lot of his observations still stand today.\n\nCollaborative consumption is a fast-developing movement offering tangible\npositive perspectives. But for it to really make a difference we must all\nchallenge our own preconceptions and sometimes force our nature, because there\nare specific objects we’re not ready to let go of. Some of these objects act\nas flags, they place us socially and send out messages about our personality,\nset of values and priorities. Or we hold on simply because we have a strong\nbond with them. But there are ways around this obstacle, which has to be taken\ninto account but not seen as a brick wall. Granted, collaborative consumption\ndoes not mean that we should not own anything, but let’s try and maximise its\nimpact – as an individual, that could well mean determining a strict list of\n‘ring-fenced possessions’. By doing so, it’s quite easy to identify the\nsuperfluous purchases in our lives – the word ‘purchases’ is crucial here,\nbecause the idea is not to move towards an austere lifestyle but to switch\nfrom owning goods to benefiting from the service they provide.\n\nIn that capacity, collaborative consumption and take-back systems seem to form\na very effective combination: what I can live without on a daily basis I can\nsource from collaborative networks when the need arises; and what I have to\nhave (say a fridge, computer, a bicycle for the ones who cycle to work…) can\nbe owned by the manufacturer. Both models work towards reducing or eradicating\nwaste and safeguarding precious materials. It’s easy to see the benefits of\ntheir large-scale implementation but it will not be without a conscious effort\non the part of us ‘consumers’ notably because – and it would be intellectually\ndishonest to overlook this issue – the current market efforts are directed\ntowards making sure we remain buyers. As Jean Baudrillard would have put it,\nthe “ideological genesis of needs” is the driving force, which manifests\nitself in the form of TV advertising, marketing or credit… There is a lot of\npotential in the collaborative consumption idea, but it will have to avoid the\ntrap into which ‘traditional’ recycling fell – in other words, becoming an\nalibi to carry on doing business as usual with a lighter conscience.\n\n\n8 DEVOLVED, DIGITAL AND OPEN SOURCE MANUFACTURING AND THE RISE OF URBAN MINING\n\n![Berlin mur detail.eps](image829.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Berlin Wall. Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“Three-dimensional printing makes it as cheap to create single items as it is\nto produce thousands and thus undermines economies of scale. It may have as\nprofound an impact on the world as the coming of the factory did ... Just as\nnobody could have predicted the impact of the steam engine in 1750 – or the\nprinting press in 1450, or the transistor in 1950 – it is impossible to\nforesee the long-term impact of 3D printing. But the technology is coming, and\nit is likely to disrupt every field it touches.”\n\nThe Economist (10 February 2011)\n\nReimagining the world of materials and products. What if it was based less on\nthroughput and huge economies of scale, but more on carefully chosen\nmaterials, which are produced, used and re-made in more devolved regional and\nlocal economies?\n\nRecycling, the recovery of materials at the end of life, can act as\nreinforcement for a linear economy because it is the only one of the four ‘Rs’\n(Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to have no real effect on existing\nconsumption patterns. Recycling is also wasteful as it usually involves the\nloss of embedded energy and quality. In a circular economy, this might not be\na problem if materials are designed well – to fit biological or technical\nmaterial pathways – and the recovery of the technical materials is approaching\n100%. It’s a tough call though progress is being made. 1\n\nIt is not just the end of life where losses occur. Most waste in the overall\nproduction process – in excess of 70% – happens before the end users gets\ntheir hands on materials or products. Production is very often subtractive,\nmaterial is cut away to provide shape and form, and hence function. It’s a\n‘heat, beat and treat’ energy-intensive world too. What if production was\nadditive, and materials were designed to ‘fit’ a circular economy?\n\n“What is Direct Digital Manufacturing (DDM)?\n\nDDM is the fabrication of components in a seamless manner from computer design\nto actual part in hand. Also know as ‘3D printing’ or ‘additive,’ ‘rapid,’\n‘instant,’ ‘on-demand’ manufacturing, DDM uses 3D computer-aided design files\nto drive the computer-controlled fabrication of parts. Unlike traditional\nmachining methods, which involve working from arough mold and then cutting\naway to achieve the desired complex shape, direct digital manufacturing\ncreates the shape precisely and instantly, using additive fabrication. DDM is\ncommonly explained through the example of creating a coffee cup. An old-style\ncraftsman might slowly shape a piece of clay by hand into a handmade mug.\nDesigners and machinists in a factory would build a series of metallic molds\nand then create a series of tools to mill metal into the key components of the\ncup (handle, bottom, etc.), which would then be assembled on a production\nline, often through welding. By contrast, a DDM designer would create a\ndigital 3D model of the cup, then turn production over to the computer, which\nwould digitally slice it into a stack of wafer-thin layers, print them out,\nand fuse them together.”\n\n[http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2011/10/ 10-digital-manufacturing-\nsinger](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2011/10/%2010-digital-\nmanufacturing-singer)  \n\nAccording to Mark Boyer, DDM is one of today’s most exciting emerging\ntechnologies – few other developments have as much potential to shape the way\nwe make things and the world as we know it. DDM is additive manufacturing,\nbuilding up objects towards their final form and function rather than\nsubtractive manufacturing so it has the immediate potential for being less\nwasteful, especially if the materials it builds from are carefully designed\nand chosen.\n\n![](image847.jpg)\n\nClosed sunflower Photo: Shutterstock\n\nJust examining a catalogue for machine tools shows how much effort we\ncurrently put into the subtractive process. There is the energy required too.\nManufacturing as ‘heat, beat and treat’ is crude and wasteful and the\ninvestment in large plants to benefit from economies of scale in this exercise\nalso means shipping and other distribution costs. How much more elegant for\nthe designs to criss-cross the globe digitally than the objects or the\nmaterials. Materials are key. Currently the choice of DDM materials is far\nfrom being local, abundant, safe or digestible: 3D printers are using the same\nold fossil fuel-based polymers and resins that end up in landfill or\nincinerators. Although the technology is young and materials will become more\nsophisticated and varied, Janine Benyus cautions against such an assumption.\nJanine is most famous for her book Biomimicry 2 and the establishment of\nBiomimicry 3.8, a hub for developing the understanding of what insights from\nliving systems – rather than Nature as a resource – can teach us. She has a\nvery different message: we need a DDM revolution developing printing processes\nmodelled on the way nature builds living organisms.\n\nMark Boyer3 takes up the story in a report for Inhabitat from a Global\nBiomimicry Conference held in June 2013:\n\n“…complex materials can be simplified, Benyus argues, and the key to making 3D\nprinting more sustainable can be found in the natural systems all around us.\nNature relies on a very small set of ‘feedstocks,’ or raw materials; a set of\njust five polymers make up most biomaterials found in nature, and 3D printing\nshould adopt a similar five-polymer system so that materials can be fed back\ninto a printer for reuse when they are no longer needed.\n\nAs an example of the divide that exists between complex manmade objects and\nsimple materials found in nature, Benyus compares a beetle’s shell with a bag\nof potato chips. Both serve several crucial functions; the beetle’s shell\nprovides strength, breathability and waterproofing, while the chip bag is\nwaterproof, airtight, and has labels printed on it. But in contrast to the\nshell, which is made of only one polymer – chitin – the chip bag contains\ndifferent materials for each function. After the beetle dies, the shell\nbiodegrades, but the chip bag is difficult to recycle.\n\n![](image855.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Thinkstock\n\nIn order to be more like the beetle shell and less like the chip bag, Benyus\nargues that 3D printing must conform to three basic principles:\n\n1\\. The materials must be made from a small set of locally sourced, non-toxic\nand recyclable polymer feedstocks.\n\n2\\. The structural designs used in 3D printing must mimic those found in\nnature, imparting strength and flexibility.\n\n3\\. A ‘take-back’ system must be instituted that will enable products to be\nreconfigured as feedstock.\n\nOne of the most exciting things about 3D printing is that it has the potential\nto put the means of production in the hands of consumers. But that can only be\nrealised if the materials used are greatly simplified so that source materials\nare, in Benyus’ words, “common, abundant, and local”. In addition to\ndemocratising the manufacture of products, 3D printing has the potential to\nblossom into a truly innovative … system by mimicking the circular flow of\nmaterials in the natural world.”\n\nIn the inner circles of the technical cycle in a circular economy, instead of\nrecycling materials, the challenge is around creating easier pathways to\nextending use – repair, refurbishment etc – and upgrading and generally\nincreasing access (more use of the asset in a particular time period). Just as\nthe (ongoing) digital revolution has created the means to track stuff, and\nmonitor the functioning of appliances and charge per use, DDM has also begun\nto have an impact on how and when and where and for what purpose manufacturing\nis undertaken. DDM feels heaven-sent for a circular economy which is in need\nof regional or local access to achieve repair and refurbishment of smaller\nflows of more intensively used assets over longer periods – whether machines\nor buildings or apple orchards. It is important to recognise that DDM is not\nthe same as returning ‘back to the 1950s’ approach when motorbikes or\nhousehold appliances, for example, might have lasted a long time (in theory)\nbut were unsophisticated, needed regular routine maintenance, and were\ninefficient in energy and materials and often very expensive – and\nimportantly, unavailable to the majority.\n\nDisruptive Manufacturing according to The Economist:\n\n“Everything in the factories of the future will be run by smarter software.\nDigitisation in manufacturing will have a disruptive effect every bit as big\nas in other industries that have gone digital, such as office equipment,\ntelecoms, photography, music, publishing and films. And the effects will not\nbe confined to large manufacturers; indeed, they will need to watch out\nbecause much of what is coming will empower small and medium-sized firms and\nindividual entrepreneurs. Launching novel products will become easier and\ncheaper. Communities offering 3D printing and other production services that\nare a bit like Facebook are already forming online – a new phenomenon which\nmight be called social manufacturing.\n\nThe consequences of all these changes amount to a third industrial revolution.\nThe first began in Britain in the late 18th century with the mechanisation of\nthe textile industry. In the following decades the use of machines to make\nthings, instead of crafting them by hand, spread around the world. The second\nindustrial revolution began in America in the early 20th century with the\nassembly line, which ushered in the era of mass production.\n\nAs manufacturing goes digital, a third great change is now gathering pace. It\nwill allow things to be made economically in much smaller numbers, more\nflexibly and with a much lower input of labour, thanks to new materials,\ncompletely new processes such as 3D printing, easy-to-use robots and new\ncollaborative manufacturing services available online. The wheel is almost\ncoming full circle, turning away from mass manufacturing and towards much more\nindividualised production. And that in turn could bring some of the jobs back\nto rich countries that long ago lost them to the emerging world.”\n\n![](image876.jpg)\n\n© The Economist Newspaper Limited, London 2012\n\nIt is a triangular, reinforcing arrangement:  \n\n​• ​ the circular economy of well-designed products designed for the full\ncycle and disassembly using ‘clean’ materials (with a shift towards renewables\nand needing energy lower thresholds as a result);  \n\n​• ​ meets a sharing economy which is independently about finding access to\nassets rather than ownership fired up by information technology advances;\n\n​• ​ meets digital manufacturing with its 3D printers, rapid prototyping and\ncustomisation, its laser cutters and precise CNC (Computer Numerical Control)\nrouters.\n\nPlus a happy ethos of shared working amongst artisans – in the MakerLabs or\nFab Lab style! Additionally, attention might shift to DDM processes, which are\noften less wasteful than subtractive manufacturing and excitingly allow us\npotential access to the lessons living systems provide where the use of\nstructure is much more important and the palette of materials is more\nrestrictive.\n\nHere is the key to that repair and refurbish and repurposing possibility which\nhad all but disappeared in the era of global supply chains based on mass\nproduction and the ‘easier to buy a new one than fix it’ approach. Scatter a\npocketful of instructional YouTube videos on iFixit4 e.g. on how to make a new\nceramic part for your Panasonic breadmaker or the latest modification to get\naround a design flaw in a petrol garden strimmer or post on Facebook or\nTwitter about the next pop-up repair café in your town. Then garnish with the\nglobal eBay network which means you can buy what you are missing for even the\nmost obscure item. No wonder car boot sales are a treasure trove these days.\nAdd in the open-source design movement and crowd-funding innovations which can\nback the outsider to win, and it becomes a very, very potent mix. It’s an\nideal scenario for the insurgents, the new businesses on the block looking for\nthe cracks in the pavement and very challenging for the incumbents, the\nestablished businesses, if only because the situation is so fluid.\n\nAn example of a combination of these forces in action is the Global Village\nConstruction Set (GVCS)5 which comprises “an advanced industrial economy-in-a-\nbox that can be replicated inexpensively anywhere in the world. The GVCS is\nlike a Lego set of modular building blocks that work together – creating\nsustainable, regenerative, resilient communities.”\n\nIt is striking how this project clearly has a ‘big picture’ sense of what it\nwants to achieve, using some of the best creative and collaborative tools to\ncome out of the digital age. In its own words it “combines appropriate\ntechnology, high technology, resilient community development, sustainable\nliving, economic development, automation, open-source product development,\ncommunity construction, open-source economic development, and livelihood\ntopics.”\n\nPerhaps it is the audacity of the whole thing and its clear references to\nradical designers like Buckminster Fuller which also appeals. As a retake on\nhow to create abundance by “questioning everything you thought you knew about\nbuilding communities”, while adding a sense of fun and engagement, it is a\nfantastic talking point, truly educational.\n\nIs this putative ‘open-source economy’ part of a ‘circular economy’? It could\nbe argued that it looks more like a social enterprise providing people with\ntools – and the means for their use and maintenance – a sort of ‘post oil’\ncommunity building … but just a moment – a circular economy requires,\nabsolutely requires, a way of restoring and rebuilding social and natural\ncapital. It also requires us to rebuild economies in a way that gives people\nopportunities to work at a wide range of scales and meet more of their own\nneeds. The GVCS machines are also claimed to be much cheaper than commercial\ntools and make much use of standardised components. It’s affordable.\n\nThe sharing economy practitioners describe a shift from a job for life, to a\nseries of careers, to several jobs at once, so it’s very contemporary. It is\nstill vitally important for waste to be food and there to be technical and\nbiological cycles. The GVCS tools are designed to be fixable, repairable,\nreusable and they hardly consist of the sort of kit which would end up in\nlandfill.\n\nThis is why the GVCS is such an interesting concept; it is creative and\nchallenging. Circular economy, sharing economy/performance economy, digital\nmanufacturing and perhaps, lastly, a devolved economy too. In these days when\ntools and ideas and energy are being decentralised to communities of many\nkinds and spread at digital speed, it is the institutions, most of which have\na reluctance or inability to adapt, who may be most surprised by this\ninnovation. These developments that spring up all over the place and find\ntraction may simply bypass traditional structures.\n\nTHE GLOBAL VILLAGE CONSTRUCTION SET\n\nKey features include a proposed set of 50 cheap but modern tools providing\npeople with technology to do more with less, open-source development so that a\nglobal community can contribute and share the development and the benefits, a\nwide range of interchangeable parts, and new approaches to familiar problems.\n\nThe tools include a microhouse, bulldozer, tractor, dairy milker, bakery oven\nand well-drilling rig through to a 3D scanner and 3D printer, power cube and\nplasma cutter.\n\nThe creators of the set, Open Source Ecology,\n\nfreely publish their 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos, budgets,\nand product manuals on an open-source wiki. Users can produce and modify the\ntool set.\n\nThey claim that the cost of making or buying their machines is, on average,\neight times cheaper than buying from an industrial manufacturer, including an\naverage labor cost of USD 25 per hour for a GVCS fabricator. For example the\ntractor comes in at under USD 5,000 compared to USD 20,000 or more for one\nproduced by an industrial brand, while a skid loader costs just a few hundred\ndollars rather than USD 20,000. As well as designing some parts to be\ninterchangeable, tools are designed for disassembly enabling the user to take\napart, maintain, and fix them readily.\n\nFAB LAB MANCHESTER\n\n![fab lab manchester_JCF1597.jpg](image902.jpg)\n\nThe UK’s first Fab Lab opened in Manchester in March 2010. It is owned by The\nManufacturing Institute and managed by its staff. It is located in the Chips\nbuilding in New Islington, Manchester.\n\nAt the heart of Fab Lab Manchester is digital manufacturing technology\nincluding laser and vinyl cutters, CNC routers, vacuum former and an\nembroidery machine. The Lab can produce a single unique product from a digital\ndesign in a matter of minutes and at a very low cost in comparison to\ntraditional tooling methods.\n\nTo date, 3,000 small manufacturers, inventors, schools and community groups\nhave used Fab Lab Manchester with a wide range of products having been\nconceived, developed and prototyped there.\n\nFinally, Jocelyn Blériot on the rise of urban mining...\n\nTrapped between high hopes placed on the potential of materials that have yet\nto be invented and the growing concern generated by the need to mine more\nstuff, we often seem to overlook the wealth of resources already in\ncirculation – yet the heritage of the industrial era is such that mature\nmarkets are a world where a considerable amount of the extraction/production\nwork has already been done.\n\nAnd if the ambition is to create an economy based on effective, carefully\nmanaged and pure material flows, then including these ‘overground resources’\nin the master plan is fundamental: the current economic context confirms, on a\ndaily basis, that what fuelled prosperity until the dawn of the 21st century\ncannot be relied upon any more. So, rather than focus on reductionist tactics,\nwe should start considering making better use of the existing assets. As\nThomas E Graedel (Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Science) puts it:  \n\n“A half century ago, the visionary urbanist Jane Jacobs (1961) proclaimed that\n\n“Cities are the mines of the future.”\n\nThis prediction was based on some hard facts that are more evident today than\nthey were when Jacobs penned her words.” 6\n\nWhat Professor Graedel refers to when he talks about urban mining naturally\ngoes way beyond what the expression evokes on a superficial level – images of\ndisorganised scavenging may spring to mind.\n\nYet the reality of the concept as it stands today involves careful stock\nassessment, periodic tables and timelines recapitulating materials\navailability.\n\nJesse Stallone, co-founder of urbanmining.org, describes this idea as “the\nprocess of reclaiming compounds and elements from products, building and waste\n(…) [It goes] beyond ‘Dumpster Diving’, [and] requires a systems approach that\nutilises industrial ecology when viewing our end-of-pipe activities for\nmaterial recovery.” The expression is often used to describe the recovery\nprocess of precious metals from old electronic devices, and with roughly 30\ntimes more gold in mobile phone circuitry than in ore as processed in mines on\na tonne to tonne basis, the potential seems striking.7 But urban mining is not\nlimited to delicate retrieval operations to salvage metals that are sought-\nafter by jewellers. It also applies to large-scale materials pools we too\noften neglect.  \n\nAs Professor Graedel explains:\n\n“The energy used for primary production is embodied, to a large extent, in the\nmetal and, consequently, in the building too. Today’s buildings and their\ncontents therefore present large ‘urban mines’ of around 400 million tonnes of\naluminium metal 8 that can be extracted and recycled by future generations\nthrough the use of only 5% of the originally used energy, not just once but\nrepeatedly.”\n\nTo deliberately simplify things, imagine a young boy in his playroom, his mind\nset on building a new house with Lego bricks, because his previous creation –\nstill standing – does not satisfy the needs of the new generation of Lego\npeople that have just arrived in the region. To his left stands the previous\ndwelling, disused but made of carefully selected bricks, to his right a boxful\nof muddled-up individual components (let’s consider that the selection process\nrepresents, by analogy, the raw materials transformation which happens in the\n‘real world’). Where would you, in his place, source your materials from? Time\nand energy are the most two obvious savings to be within reach in this\nanalogy, and in a real-world scenario one would need to add on top of those a\nfinancial gain and a reduction of negative impacts (due to mining and\nproduction, and transport).\n\nDepending on their scarcity level, ease of recovery, ability to be reprocessed\netc., materials have to be plotted into a ‘periodic table of recyclability’\nand classified according to the nature of their stock. Graedel makes a clear\ndistinction between ‘abandoned’ (i.e. very hard or impossible to recover),\n‘comatose’ (recovery is unlikely) and ‘hibernating’ (currently not performing\na useful service) stocks. For certain metals, such as copper, the fact that a\npotential 95% saving in terms of energy can be achieved opens up the\ndiscussion on to new horizons from a systems perspective. Placing that energy\nfactor in the wider debate about changing our linear model actually addresses\nsome of the issues usually raised when it comes to moving towards renewable\nenergy: urban mining rolled out at scale could potentially play an important\nrole in achieving threshold efficiency.\n\nTechnologies and economics often combine in new and unexpected ways and it is\nperhaps no surprise to see additive manufacture, relocalisation of production\nand recovery of materials all being a part of a different energy demand and\nsupply mix. The barriers to change are mostly in our head. Seeing renewables\nas a swap out for big-box one-way fossil fuel energy systems based on\nthroughput linear economies is naïve. It was never going to happen. But as\npart of a much smarter industrial system, with effective extended product-\nlife, good design, effective materials recovery and the possibilities of\nsharing and collaborative consumption, it looks very different.\n\nPLASTIC AND STONE PAPER\n\nThe first edition of Bill McDonough’s and Michael Braungart’s book Cradle to\nCradle was printed on Mechcher Media DuraBooks synthetic paper made from\ninorganic fillers and plastic resins. The DuraBook is a technical nutrient or\nmaterial i.e. it can be processed back into the raw material for a new book\nmore rapidly and at lower cost – in terms of energy and materials as well as\nthe level of toxicity engendered by many recycled paper de-inking processes.\nYes, it costs more, almost anything done on a limited scale compared to a very\nlarge scale can be financially more expensive. But as Pauli has noted,9 just\nfocusing on the one valuable element rather than the potential from multiple\ncash flows or perhaps other positive consequences can often be accompanied by\nthe sound and effect of unmet costs being ladled overboard from the business:\nthe ‘externalities’ problem.\n\nThe point being made about the book as a material is that the plastic once in\na plastic cycle can stay there – if the materials system to deal with these\nbooks is in place of course. A BIG ‘if’. It’s the scale question in part. Just\nlike a biodegradable plastic bottle appearing in the massive PET plant, the\nplastic book is a contaminant – something the system cannot deal with easily.\nBut sufficient ‘contaminant’ objects warrants a process to filter them out;\nand an avalanche of them demands a new business. A diversity of routes through\nto material recovery could be envisaged, but again a narrow definition of\nefficiency supported by financial incentives around displacing labour and\nusing more capital and energy makes this more nuanced approach more difficult.\nTo work it requires a good material in an amenable materials system but one\nthat also makes sense economically.\n\nThis brings us to stone paper... about 80% rock and 20% plastic and pretty\nmuch recyclable for ever.\n\nAll rock waste can be converted to stone paper, here is Pauli’s riff on the\npossibilities:\n\n“Producing paper from pulverized rocks offers an opportunity to produce tree-\nfree paper, manufactured without any water and is 100% recyclable forever.\nThis means that over time the vast swathes of land reserved for forests could\nbe substituted by a permanent stock of paper. The cost is now converted into\nan asset, very much like aluminum cans have ended up on balance sheets instead\nof mere costs of packaging. The substitution of pulp with stone (and a small\npercentage of recycled plastics) will free up millions of hectares of land and\nputs our drive towards food security in another dimension. Mining that\nsupports agriculture seems far fetched indeed, but is a reality once we\nconsider the whole system.”\n\nThis discussion is important, quite apart from whether stone paper could\nrelease land for other purposes. It is a reminder that communities are driven\nby adding value, not by having cheaper products. Mining and agriculture look\nquaint in economies dominated by services and eventually financial services –\nthe latter mainly in the digital realm. But if the mining and agriculture\nsectors fail to provide a means of adding value for communities, then\nadditional efficiencies, leading to labour displacement, will only serve up\nmore jobless growth and increased demand for, and dependency on, government\nsupport to the very poorest – paid for by taxes and deficit spending. A means\nof adding value which could well mean a revival of both primary and secondary\nproduction is not at all far-fetched.\n\n![StonePaperAtributes](image940.jpg)\n\n\n9 THE REGENERATIVE BIOLOGICAL CYCLE – AT SCALE\n\n![](image950.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Jocelyn Blériot\n\n“If we were to change the philosophy, as we propose, into one that believes\nthat instead of cutting costs you should generate more value with what you\nhave, then you have a completely different approach to business!”\n\nGunter Pauli\n\nThere is much flag waving for the idea of an ‘upcycle’, a positive cycle where\na circular economy is not just enduring but restorative or regenerative. More\na spiral than a circle of course. Needless to say, this is a tough call in a\nworld of take-make-and-dispose where food from South Africa is consumed in\nRussia or where 70% of the world’s production of children’s toys takes place\nin China but their use clearly does not. Any naïve idea of ‘loop closing’ on\nthis sort of geographical scale is not going to happen, except as downcycling\nperhaps. The restorative and regenerative notion is energising, however: to\nrebuild natural (and social) capital in order to produce more and better goods\nand services and in the longer term. In Chapter 5 attention shifted to what\ncan be achieved by better understanding stocks and flows.\n\nOver the last 50 years, global consumption of agricultural inputs has\nincreased sometimes rapidly\n\n![globalFertillizers](image962.jpg)\n\nHowever growth in agricultural yield has not kept pace with food production  \n\n![growthinAgri](image968.jpg)\n\n1 Includes cereals, citrus fruit, coarse grain, primary fibre crops, fruit,\nprimary oil crops, pulses, roots and tubers, tree nuts, vegetables\n\n2 Weighted average of the above agricultural products  \n\nSource: FAO; Zhang, Jiang and Ou, (2011)\n\nThis chapter goes in search of some of the keys to large-scale examples of how\na regenerative economy might be observed and developed. It finds them in the\nsemi-arid grasslands, in the tropical food crop areas and in the rice paddies.\nThe key was knowledge, but a systems perspective kind of knowledge, and one\nwhich had to be established – or better, rediscovered and fought for – against\na backdrop of inertia, conventional wisdom and failure.\n\nIn the idealised schematic of a circular economy (see introduction) the loop\nis eventually closed on the biological side and on land via the agency of\nsunlight, fungi and bacteria and the other communities of life in the soil.\nHere, then, soil is a simplified notion of natural capital in agricultural\nsystems. As in the case of technical materials flows, it is easy to\ndemonstrate the extractive and capital-reducing qualities of the existing\nlinear system which has successfully substituted fossil fuel derived\nfertilisers, new crop and livestock configurations and machinery for labour in\nreturn for increased thoughput.1\n\n“Today’s agriculture does not allow the soil to enrich itself, but depends on\nchemical fertilisers that don’t replace the wide variety of nutrients plants\nand humans need” says Dr Tim Lobstein, the UK’s Food Commission director. Land\ndegradation costs an estimated USD 40 billion annually worldwide, without\ntaking into account the costs of increased fertiliser use, loss of\nbiodiversity, and loss of unique landscapes.2\n\nSoil degradation is estimated to extend to some 25–35% of the 1.5 billion\nhectares of land under cultivation. Degraded soil is less fertile, less able\nto retain water, less able to fend off pests, and more prone to erosion. Loss\nof soil carbon is problematic given the role of this carbon in several\ndeveloping and maintaining factors that are critical to plant growth, such as\nsoil texture, water retention and nutrient delivery to the roots of plants. In\nEurope, around 45% of soils have low or very low organic matter content, 45%\nhave medium content.3\n\nThe maps overleaf remind us of the extent and importance of agriculture as it\nrelates to human welfare across large swathes of the world: in the savannah\ngrasslands (cattle), sugar cane growing (crop monocultures) and paddy rice\nareas.\n\nBetween these three modes of agriculture it is possible to capture an\nexcellent spread around some of the challenges of falling carbon content,\ndeteriorating soil structure, desertification and excessive use of artificial\nfertiliser and pesticides and their ‘downstream’ externalities.\n\nGunter Pauli, in a 2013 interview with consultancy EMG describes how his\ninnovation in the use of palm oil as a detergent base didn’t work as expected:\n“I created the Ecover factory around 20 years ago, and all that time it has\nrelied on palm oil to create many of its products; the same palm oil that is\ncontinuing to destroy rainforests. So I have to look at myself and consider\nthe mistakes that I have made. In those days, I did not see that I was\ndestroying the rainforest. But now I know!”\n\nHis failure was in a lack of systems thinking. In this example, the Ecover\ndetergent was designed to keep the quality of water in European rivers but led\nto accelerated rainforest destruction in Indonesia. After the experience, the\nlearning.\n\nIt was a similar experience for Alan Savory who now heads research into\nholistic cattle grazing systems at the Savory Institute, USA. He was once\nresponsible for the decision in what was Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) to cull thousands\nof African elephants in the belief that reduced grazing would slow down or\nreverse the decline in the savannah grasslands. He bitterly regrets this\ndecision and admits that he was completely wrong. He had failed to understand\nthe system, the way these grasslands had evolved and the place of grazing,\nplant-eating animals.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that reduced grazing is better – it sounds right.\nMore herbivores, such as elephants or cattle, means more stress on the\nvegetation and less output and falling soil quality. But this is a partial\nunderstanding. Alan Savory came to realise that, in evolutionary terms, the\ngrasslands developed in the presence of very large herds of herbivores and\nthat this characteristic – of a large herd grazing everything, churning up the\nsoil with their hooves and depositing faeces and urine and slobber before\nmoving on – had a particular relevance to how the grassland worked as a\nsystem.\n\nTaking it to the other extreme, Savory found evidence that leaving a semi-arid\ngrassland without cattle or other herbivores means it doesn’t thrive, it\nbecomes ‘stagnant’ – sub-optimal but reasonably stable. Nutrients are not\nreturning to the soil as they are locked up in the dead stalks and stems of\nthe earlier years, since rainfall is low and bacteria and fungi cannot get to\nwork as they would prefer. Moreover sun-baked, bare earth develops a crust so\nthat rain runs off more easily, land erodes and water which runs off is not\navailable for plants – and brings flooding downstream. Some woody perennial\nplants begin to dominate and species diversity in the system declines.\n\n![savanahs](image986.jpg)\n\nSource: NASA. Indicative only\n\n![sugarCane](image990.jpg)\n\nSource: NASA. Indicative only\n\n![PaddyRice](image994.jpg)\n\nSource: NASA. Indicative only\n\nIn savannah that is intensely grazed by herds which then move on, the\nsituation is very different. The stomachs of the cattle act as bioreactors.\nThe water needed by bacteria and the bacteria themselves are active in the\ncattle stomachs and the resulting manures and urine are rich in minerals. In\naddition, the cattle hooves break up the soil surface and the non-\ndiscriminatory grazing leaves spaces for plants which would lose out in the\nungrazed regime – particularly annual grasses.\n\nIt is the way the grasses react which is most interesting. Once heavily\ngrazed, the grasses adapt their root structure to the needs of regrowth,\neffectively ‘dropping’ some roots since the structure above ground is much\nreduced: as the plant grows again the roots will regrow. This process ‘pulses’\ncarbon into the soils, but the key is that the new plant growth isn’t grazed\ntoo soon. That herd needs to be long gone and for quite a while. In\nconventional cattle grazing the interval between grazing periods is too short\nand the pressure on the habitat limits diverse plant species regowth – the\nanimals are choosy eaters if they can be and the energy of the grasses is\nnever fully rebuilt.  \n\nThe two diagrams below show how Savory believes the cycle of carbon loss from\nconventional and what he terms holistic grazing can be illustrated. In the\nholistic system at Savory Institute cattle grazing is established to mimic the\ngrazing patterns of herbivores in natural savannah ecosystems – this ensures\nmore effective nutrient cycling and build-up of soil organic matter, resulting\nin enhanced vegetation growth and cattle grazing land.\n\n![holisticLand](image1002.jpg)\n\n![conventionalLand](image1005.jpg)\n\nThe photo below of cattle grazing lush ranchland4 gives some clue to what a\nrestorative biological cycle means: in this case better water retention as\ncarbon levels are built up in vegetation and soil systems, leading to more\nresilience during drought periods; better output in terms of cattle per\nhectare; less soil erosion and greater biodiversity. Better flood control is a\nby-product for land downstream. All these benefits really need to be accounted\nfor, but most are not. If a shallower focus is allowed, the plus is just more\ncattle. It sounds rather mean-spirited.\n\n![cow grazing on prairie_Rex_1199709J \\(3\\).eps](image1009.jpg)\n\nCattle ranch in Oregon, USA.

Often the objections run deeper. It is\njust not how we do things – focusing down on core competencies, defined\noutcomes feels like work and being in charge, whereas looking up to system\nlevel and waiting on the return of a certain fungus feels ‘woolly’ or\nimprecise. Which of course it is, these being complex adaptive systems with\nhistories! The choice here of the work of the Savory Institute was made not\nleast because something positive is happening as far as its practitioners are\nconcerned and at scale. It is the same with the next case study, from the\nworld of monocultures.  \n\nCASE STUDY 1\n\nLeo ntino Balbo supplies over a third of all organic sugar on the world\nmarket. His aim is to obtain great returns in terms of output but by restoring\nthe quality of the soil. This from an interview in Wired Magazine:\n\n“Soil is not just a container,” he says, “it’s also the content of the\necosystem. It holds the biodiversity, both living and mineral, that’s\nessential for life. If the soil loses this function, all other things are\ncompromised.” According to Balbo, modern agriculture damages soil in three\nways. Farm machinery compresses it, making it less able to hold water;\nfertilisers upset its natural chemical balance; and monocrops reduce its\nbiodiversity, which he sees as essential for healthy plants. “So much soil\nused for agriculture is dead… we need to revitalise it, to restore the energy\nof its ecosystem,” he says.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable characteristic of his work over nearly 30 years is\njust that: how long it took to solve some of the puzzle – and it’s not over\nyet.  \n\n“All along it has been like I have been doing a 10,000-piece jigsaw puzzle and\nnow I have about 100 pieces to go. We will be able to produce cane sugar at\nhalf the cost of conventional production today, providing all those\nenvironmental benefits and using a third of the resources. That’s what makes\nme so enthusiastic.” 5\n\n![](image1024.jpg)\n\nLeotino Balbo Junior inspects his sugar cane fields. Photo: Matthew\nMahon/Redux\n\nBalbo’s family business is doing well, producing 75,000 tonnes of organic\nsugar – 34% of the world market and a figure he is planning to raise as demand\nincreases – and 55,000m3 of organic ethanol each year from a crop of about 1.2\nmillion tonnes of cane. His sugar is used in about 120 high-profile products\nfrom Green & Black’s chocolate to Yeo Valley yoghurt. On the farm, energy use\nhas fallen by half and, when the introduction of green-cane harvesting\nthreatened the jobs of the manual labourers who had previously cut the crop,\nhe ensured that they were retrained and found work elsewhere on the\nplantation. All Balbo employees now have access to welfare, medical and sports\nfacilities, and low-cost housing.\n\nRicardo Abramovay, professor of economics at the University of São Paulo, who\nresearches large-scale agriculture concludes: “He has achieved what many\nconsider impossible; a large continuous area occupied by a single product that\nstill provides exceptionally favourable conditions not only for agriculture\nbut also for wildlife.”\n\nCASE STUDY 2  \n\nThe last example is from the paddy rice fields. Once more the challenge is in\nunderstanding the inter-relationships in the system to create multiple\nbenefits, multiple cash flows and a positive cycle. Perhaps it is the other\nway around. Understand the positive cycle and see what can be harvested from\nit. Build the capital and then draw down the appropriate income.\n\nTakao Furono is a farmer from southern Japan who has experimented extensively\nwith the design and development of duck/rice/fish farming systems. Rather than\ngrow rice as a monoculture crop that depends on fossil fuel fertilisers and\npesticides to achieve high crop yields, Furono has developed a complex,\nspecies-rich system that has increased his farm’s rice yields whilst producing\na wide range of other food products – without depending on any outside crop\ninputs.Frederick Kirschenmann from Iowa State University has studied how this\nparticular farm system works:  \n\n“...after Mr Furono sets his rice seedlings out into his flooded rice paddies,\nhe puts a gaggle of young ducklings into the paddies. The ducklings\nimmediately start to feed on insects that normally attack young rice plants.\nMr Furono then introduces loaches, a variety of fish that is easily cultivated\nand produces a delicious meat product. He also introduces azolla, normally\nconsidered a ‘paddy weed’. The azolla fixes nitrogen but also serves as food\nfor the fish and the ducks. In this way Mr Furono has developed a highly\nsynergistic farming system. The ducks feed on the insects and, later, the\ngolden snails that attack rice plants. Since the ducks and fish feed on the\nazolla, its growth is kept sufficiently under control so it does not compete\nwith the growing rice, but serves as a source of nitrogen. The nitrogen from\nthe azolla, plus the droppings from the ducks and fish, provides all the\nnutrients needed for the rice.” 6\n\n![ducks in rice paddy_Rex_3791588A \\(2\\).eps](image1038.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Imagine China/Rex\n\nThe ducks also eat the seeds and seedlings of weeds, using their feet to dig\nup the weed seedlings, thus oxygenating the water and encouraging the roots of\nthe rice plants to grow. The ducks are so effective at weeding that farmers\nwho have adopted this farming system avoid an estimated 240 person hours per\nhectare in manual weeding every year.7 The ducks are completely free ranging\non the farm until the rice plants form ears of grain in the field. At that\nstage, the ducks have to be rounded up otherwise they will eat the rice\ngrains. They are then confined in a shed and fed exclusively on waste rice\ngrain.\n\nIn addition, Furono grows figs on the edges of his rice paddy fields,\nsupplying him with fruit. He then rotates his integrated rice/duck crop with a\ncrop of vegetables and wheat so as to prevent the build-up of pests in the\nfarm soil. He also harvests duck eggs that he markets along with the rice,\nfish and duck meat, vegetables, wheat and figs. His cash flows from the farm\nare also enhanced by the fact that his rice yields in this system exceed the\nrice yields of industrial rice systems by 20–50%.8 This farm design modelled\non complex dynamic living systems makes Furono’s farm in Japan extremely\nproductive in international terms. According to conversations he has had with\nmodern monoculture rice growers in Texas, the gross income from Furono’s\n6-acre farm in Japan slightly exceeds the gross income of a typical 600-acre\nrice farm in Texas.\n\nTakao Furono has successfully marketed his rice which now sells at a 20–30%\npremium over conventionally grown rice in Japan and other countries. Today,\nhis small farm gives him an income of USD 160,000 a year from producing rice,\norganic vegetables and fruit, eggs and ducklings. After demonstrating small-\nscale organic farming systems can be highly productive, he is disseminating\nhis ideas. A film of his work has been produced9 and through writing, lectures\nand cooperation with agricultural organisations and governments, his methods\nhave spread to more than 75,000 small-scale farmers in Japan as well as South\nKorea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, China, Taiwan,\nIndia, Cuba and Bangladesh.  \n\nThis example is quite well established in the literature but the question\nmight arise as to why, if it works, it is still a niche activity? While\ncheap(ish) fertilisers and simplified systems predominate (they have a\ncomparatively low knowledge threshold), while costs are externalised and\nperhaps also while subsidiary markets for the other products of the duck–rice\nsystem are underdeveloped, the obvious answer is ‘why bother?’ As Frederick\nKirschenmann points out, these highly productive, redesigned farming systems\nthat mimic complex dynamic living ecosystems (in this case tropical freshwater\nwetland ecosystems) are most compatible with smaller scale, independently\nowned farms. Such complex systems do not seem to lend themselves well to\nlarge-scale centralised operations where farmers are not usually involved with\nthe complex ecology of their farms.\n\nParadoxically, the political call in these times is for a knowledge economy to\nmeet demands for jobs and better incomes. Understanding the potential for\nadding value by understanding complex and dynamic systems with an upcycle\npotential seems to be a no brainer for jobs and income. Yet the education, or\nrather schooling, system is set in quite another direction, one entrained by\nthe understanding that the world was a machine-like affair and knowledge means\nspecialism and more knowledge, even more of it.\n\n\n10 EDUCATION IN A CHANGING WORLD\n\n![](image1055.jpg)\n\nPhoto: Thinkstock\n\n“We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education, a\nmanufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching\npeople. We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of\nagriculture. We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical\nprocess; it’s an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human\ndevelopment. All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under\nwhich they will begin to flourish.”\n\nKen Robinson\n\nSir Ken Robinson is not the first person to point out the parallels between\nschooling as we know it and the linear industrial production lines which so\ncharacterised the traditional manufacturing plants of the 19th century and\nafterwards. Nor is he alone in using the metaphor of gardening to illustrate\nhis version of “setting the system conditions and allowing iteration”: Nick\nHanauer and Eric Liu write of the ‘Gardens of Democracy’ in exactly the same\nway. But, mainstream it is not. We are in thrall to the past.\n\nIt comes as a surprise to many, however, to realise that the conformity, the\nstandardisation, the isolation from the wider community, the examination of a\nnarrow set of knowledge and skills was all intended to mould pupils and\nstudents for just that sort of 19th-century urbanising factory-dominated\neconomy. It was schooling, not education, since schooling accepts the ends as\ngiven while education does not.\n\nA broader, more stimulating, open-ended curriculum was reserved for the\nuniversities and the elites who were assumed to enter them. The sop was that\nin a growing economy many more able young people would be needed and that\nsocial progress or elevation through meritocratic success was possible. The\npay off was ‘Jam tomorrow’ for the hard working, but in any event ‘employment\nfor all’ was the prospect for the rest - despite schools’ often uneven\nquality. This preparation for, variously, leadership, citizenship and for the\nmarketplace was rooted in the nation-building intentions of Germany in the\nmid-19th century – it was often described as the Prussian system – and spread\nwidely across the world.\n\nWe got the kind of schooling that reinforced the dominant economic ideas of\nthe time. We got the kind of economic ideas that reflected the dominant\nscientific ideas of the time. We still do, or perhaps it is better to say that\nwe always did. Except that the rate of change has been so great in both our\nscientific understanding and in the economy that schooling has suffered major\ndislocation. Since the 1980s, ‘employment for all’ has an increasingly hollow\nring to it in the developed world, since the factories have gone abroad or are\ninhabited by robots and computers, and the part-time and service jobs which\nare available seem to barely require any schooling, let alone upwards of 12\nyears of it.\n\nThe expansion of university, or more broadly tertiary education was supposed\nto be a response, to emphasise the role of a burgeoning knowledge and skills\neconomy, coupled to the new job opportunities created by whole new industries\nspawned by technological change and increasing productivity. This would take\nup the slack. It did for a time, but two trends are evident now. On the one\nhand increasing numbers of graduates means increasing competition for the\nfalling percentage of full-time permanent jobs in the professions and\nbusiness, which reflects the falling number of permanent full time jobs in the\neconomy as a whole. It has lowered the rewards and has driven up the barriers\nto entry: what once required a degree now requires a further degree, and, some\nwould add, a suitable internship and an introduction. On the other hand the\nrising costs of extended study and the shift away from free education, in the\nAnglo-Saxon world at least, has reduced the monetary advantage of graduate\nemployment. Indeed, a recent UK report suggested that 40% of graduates in the\nUK were not even in jobs which required a graduate.1\n\nParadoxically, in an era in which so much information, most knowledge and even\na little wisdom is available at no or low cost across the connected globe,\nnever has the cost of a suitable accreditation from a leading university been\nso much, or risen so quickly. This highlights the often-heard contention that\nthe schooling/education system is not primarily about learning, but about\npositioning for resources, access to the institutions, the centres of power\nand influence. Rising education costs outstrip other costs in the USA, where\nthere is upward of USD 1.1 trillion of student debt in play.2 Higher education\nmay be just the latest in a number of asset bubbles but it does not make it\nany the less real for those involved, or any the less puzzling when the\nmismatch is scrutinised between what is required for transition to a circular\neconomy and what is available.\n\nThe challenge for schooling/training and education is at many levels all at\nthe same time. At the top level we know that the real world is full of non-\nlinear dynamic systems, of which the economy is only one, but one that is\nembedded in flows of energy, materials and information. This is the scientific\nchallenge: to discuss these resource issues with the tools of today and\ntomorrow rather than those of yesterday and the 19th century. An associated\nchallenge is that schools, for example, hardly teach any economics at all and\nwhere they do, it is largely the formalism of the world as equilibrium-seeking\nmechanism. At university level it is notorious that of nine economic schools\nof thought outlined by Cambridge University don Ha Joon Chang, in his book\nEconomics: A User’s Guide , only one – neo-classical economics – dominates\nuniversity departments, to the extent that worldwide there have been protests\nand student boycotts against this extraordinary lack of pluralism. If the\nstate of, and prospects for the economy are of central concern to young people\n(to everyone!) then it seems odd that it is not a concern of schooling in\ngeneral. And similarly, at university level it is strange that only one (neo-\nclassical) story is taught; particularly when we reflect on the role of\nuniversities and institutions in reproducing ideas which are used politically.\n\nThis is not a hopeless situation but the siloing of schooling along\ntraditional subject boundaries undermines the attempts at making a systems\nperspective, which includes economics, the dominant approach, not a special\ncase for occasional consideration. The circular economy becomes a minor part\nof something minor right from the get go. This will not assist its rapid\nuptake.\n\nBuckminster Fuller noted that\n\n“A designer is an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective\neconomist and evolutionary strategist.”\n\nSo where will Buckminster kind of people come from? As now, perhaps, from the\neccentrics and misfits and those too young to be intimidated, but reserving\nfor these people some sort of against-the-odds-hero status is perverse in the\nextreme.\n\nOutside a case for integrating some case studies and details of new business\nmodels in business education, the circular economy represents a part of a\nchanging mindset, not a bit of content. It’s hard to escape the big picture\ndemands of the circular economy in worldview, pedagogy, skills and aptitudes\nas well as new knowledge (see diagram on chapter 10 for the mutually\nreinforcing feedback around how we understand the world, learning and the\neconomy).\n\nThe essence of the discussion in this book is how the systems conditions in\nthe economy either reinforce a vicious cycle of accelerating throughput with\nall its downsides growing inexorably and outweighing the gains (or restricting\nthem to small and shrinking sectors of the population), or how the conditions\nmight reinforce a more virtuous cycle where significant advantages compound\nthrough time to more sectors as it becomes more complete. But where in the\nschooling context do we get a chance to compare different narratives about the\neconomy, with their resonant and profound differences and consequences?\nNeither is this a recent concern. Thomas Berry wrote in 1978:  \n\n“It’s all a question of story. We are in trouble just now because we do not\nhave a good story. We are in between stories. The Old Story is not functioning\nproperly and we have not learned the New Story.” 3\n\nA REFLECTION ON EDUCATION AND CHANGING MINDSETS\n\nIn the absence of very much in the way of economic literacy in schools the\ndefault mindset so often associated with phrases like ‘resource constraints’\nor ‘sustainable development’, has been in practice a focus on just three\nthings, the individual, consumption and guilt.\n\nSchools deal with individuals: individuals being schooled to be good citizens.\nIndividuals as key to the economy through their purchases and choices. Thus\nchange is often treated primarily as a question of modifying individual\nbehaviour and hoping that this in aggregate will ‘make a difference’. Not\nchanging behaviours is subject to a degree of self-imposed or institutionally\nsponsored ‘guilt’. ‘Oh dear, it’s a mess and we created it.’ Guilt, as we\nknow, is singularly demotivating.\n\nMany institutions have usefully made resource saving a feature of the campus\ngenerally. The ‘debate’ falls out then around individual behaviour and campus\nactivities – changed light bulbs, new boilers and the like. Practical stuff.\nBut in the realm of ideas, economics is dealt with very unsteadily. As an\nexample, one idea often introduced to students is of reducing overall\nconsumption in the richer nations, so as to take the pressure off pollution\nand waste, and/or to allow more resources for emerging economies. But there is\nno attendant discussion on the question, for example, about how this will work\nwithout bringing recession and lower living standards and how this would then\nleave the developing nations if we were not buying their products in the same\nquantity.\n\nThe suggestion to learners might also reasonably be made to consider life with\nless in a different and ‘simpler’ society: localised, low-energy, frugal with\nresources and closer to the land. It could almost appear to liberate the\nindividual from the ‘temptation and greed’ built into our modern lifestyles –\nit could build social capital (interdependence) and substitute for those\nbusinesses that have been selling ‘excess’ and frippery. Austerity, by choice,\nas a means of atonement for our profligacy? It is really quite a romantic\nsuggestion overlaid with morality. For some sections of society – often it\nshould be said, professionals, who love the idea of the craft bakery and the\ndignity of a decent day’s ‘hands on’ work – this may sound attractive (if only\nin the mind or following a successful career in IT or after settling in an\nexpensive rural village).\n\nThe three columns of the table represent different categories of thinking\nabout the future. The question is ‘which way out?’ The top row of orange boxes\noffers three ‘solutions’ that might be reached without holding the linear or\nmechanistic worldview up for scrutiny. The bottom row offers options with a\nsystems perspective. The earlier discussion about schools, for example, fits\nwhat is a moderation of the linear perspective by changed values or choosing a\nsystems approach, picking a pre-industrial ‘craft’ bias (illustrated in the\ncentre column).  \n\nThe progression left to right in the boxes is from – laagers and lifeboats\n(top left and bottom left), through changed values and behaviour change –\nvoluntary simplicity (top centre) and live close to the land (bottom centre) –\nto ‘green after gold’ (top right) where innovation and economic growth enable\nproblems to be solved. Geo-engineering might exemplify this ‘we are in charge\nand we can fix it’ theme.\n\n![whichWayOut](image1088.jpg)\n\nBottom right in the red box would fit the logic of the circular economy:\nchanged worldview, working with the flow, decoupling as well as redefining the\nvalue creation mechanisms, and their relationship to materials. Shifting to\nrenewables. We are not in charge but we do have influence.  \n\nTo return to the example in the schooling setting and given the emphasis on\nbehaviour and values, it’s hard to expect discussion to be elsewhere on this\ngrid than the tension between behaviour change and the green after gold\neconomic growth will fix everything.. There is little ‘room’ for it. But to\nget to a basic circular economy (bottom centre) for all, by assuming away\nmodernity, seems a massive price to pay to maintain even a foothold on moral\nhigh ground. Choose less and/or live differently. Some choice, and that just\nfor the committed. It probably won’t work except as a niche solution. It is\nhard to think that young people would go for either. Why should they? In a\nbasically unreformed linear economy, reducing total consumption boomerangs on\nthe economy and in that boomerang the political legitimacy of the simpler life\nsimply dissolves.  \n\nHow we think and how we learn\n\nThe way we think is undoubtedly a crucial starting point. Cognitive scientists\nGeorge Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s work4 on metaphor looks productive. They\nclaim that cognitive science points to most thought being unconscious and that\nabstract thought is largely metaphorical. We do not see the world as it is but\ninterpret it through frameworks which reflect ‘worldviews.’ These world views\nas the name suggests are based on metaphor, groupings of reinforcing metaphors\nwhich create a framework. Do we see the world as ‘machine-like’ or as a given\nDivine order, or ‘random’, or as a dynamic self-regulating system: do we see\nthe nation as a family and what kind of family – one which is strict and\nhierarchical, or more inclusive and nurturing? The wash-up is that changing\none’s mind means being willing to engage with another framework or at least to\nuse it more often. This then has many spin-offs. It suggests that just\nrehearsing facts has little impact if the facts don’t fit a framework. It\nsuggests that we do not make up our own mind, and that understanding one’s own\nvalues, as they are represented through a worldview, is crucial. And in\neducation it means that context matters. The idea of neutral knowledge\ntransmission or contextless skills development is false: knowledge and skills\nwill always and forever be embedded in some framework or other. As an\napproach, Lakoff and Johnson’s work is called embodied realism. It also points\nto arch designer and provocateur Buckminster Fuller being on the mark when he\nsaid:\n\n“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change\nsomething, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”\n\nAnd on a related theme…\n\n“If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don’t bother trying to\nteach them. Instead, give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways\nof thinking.”\n\n![circlesLearn](image1101.jpg)\n\nThe puzzle must be that individual responsibility and guilt are weapons\ndeployed in ostensibly economic discussions at all. They feel like a reaction\nagainst modernity of the most irrational sort. An exercise in feeling better,\nperhaps? It would be hard to imagine pre-industrial methods feeding existing\nurban world populations or holding up the infrastructure. If the context were\na post-carbon crash, then it’s an end to modernity anyway.\n\nThe educational discussion needs to be broad and it needs to include the\nsystemic. It is the system conditions we choose which may be the key to either\ntransitioning to a circular economy for an urban, populous and modern world or\na much diminished economy built, by default, on the ‘best of the rest’ – what\nwe can get from continuing a linear mode and trusting to technology and\ninnovation.\n\nPerhaps no moral high ground is needed, merely an observation that were system\nconditions changed, by intention or circumstance, there would be an organic\nand adaptive shift in behaviour, as people adjusted to a different pattern of\nopportunities and incentives.\n\nUnderstanding the ‘bigger picture’, seeing the connections and context, will\nremain a prerequisite of success but that context is now much wider. The\nfittest will be those who fit the system best, not those who aim to be last\nman or woman standing. To that degree, if the empathetic circuitry in the\nbrain, the sense of other and context, is as important as cognitive science\nreports that it is (see previous page) – every bit as important as the\ncompetitive, egocentric and individualistic drive – then what will result is\nthe chance of a more cognitively balanced individual.\n\nBeing in favour of more cognitively rounded individuals in a restorative\neconomy could be described as taking a position about what is right and good.\nSo maybe we are stuck with morals somewhere but at least the focus is shifted\noutwards – from ‘what is good for me and mine’ to ‘what is good for us and\nalso me?’ Please note the question mark.\n\nThe way to start, if we are talking education and particularly schools, is\nsurely not to assume it is always (or even mostly) about changing individual\nbehaviour in the frame of a moral or health programme – ‘wash your hands,\ndear, and pick up that litter’. Instead it needs to be an education which, as\nthe root of the word suggests, draws out or opens up a world of possibilities,\nto see the world through different frames and to focus its attention as much\non the context and the bigger picture, its connections and flow as it now\nspends on knowledge, detail and utility/vocation (or to be less generous –\ngetting a good job).\n\nOut of this kind of dynamic tension comes creativity just as it leads to\ninnovation in the economy. A circular economy reflected in education is thus\npart of the search for a way of reinventing progress, to be a part of 21st-\ncentury Enlightenment in line with our evolving understanding of science and\nlearning and of the interplay between the economy and its contexts.  \n\nIt’s tempting to suggest that there is some new knowledge needed here, or\nrather knowledge that students don’t usually encounter. True enough, so that\nwould be ‘content’... It’s clear that there is something about participative\nlearning too, with our keen interest in the role of feedback, so ‘skills’\nthen.\n\nAdd in some explorations about bringing this together so it gets around the\ntrap of specialisms and siloing of knowledge, and that is a programme and a\nhalf of work already.  \n\nRecent studies by educationalists Bill Lucas and Guy Claxton seem in tune with\nthis changing world. They advocate ‘reframing discussion on skills in terms of\ndeveloping dispositions and habits of mind’.5 This connects with the thinking\nof Howard Gardner around ‘multiple intelligences’ and our learning\npreferences. It also connects with leading intellectual and business advisor\nNassim Taleb who writes: ‘Solutions can only come from simple heuristics.\nThat’s what we have been doing since civilisation began ...’ The underlying\nsense in the term ‘circular economy’ is an attempt at such a heuristic, a\nframework for thinking about resources and our relationship to them.\n\nThe education system, if it remains true to the rationale of mirroring the\nscientific state of play and the economic concerns of dominant nation-states\nand leading institutions within them, will want to evolve to enable learners\nto grasp the ‘habits of mind’, the ‘simple heuristics’ and the ‘dispositions’\nthat enable effective ‘whole systems’ design. Why? Because then the evolved\neducation system reflects the economic advantages of the approach and as a\nconsequence has utility. This spans systems, products, technologies,\nmolecules, materials and energy flows, and perhaps makes explicit those links\nbetween the subject specialties that are chronically underplayed at the\npresent time.\n\nHowever, if schooling is a reflection of a machine age, the influence of which\nis still prevalent in today’s world, it is doing its work rather badly –\ngenerating vast quantities of waste in the form of the underqualified and\nuninterested as well as the overqualified and frustrated. The challenge is\nthat we now need creativity and its precursor, imagination, coupled to\ncommitment and passion.\n\nIn any event, to reference back to the world of consumerist disengagement and\ndistraction, education needs to help young people find meaning in what they\ndo. Whether it can afford, let alone justify, doing this through large\ninstitutional arrangements conceived in Victorian times and now at the tail\nend of an era of cheap energy remains to be seen. Perhaps it will be found in\ninformal channels, or truly novel educational arrangements.\n\nWhat is important is that we do not imagine that the education which served\nthe linear economy will serve us now with a couple of tweaks and new bells and\nwhistles tagged on. It calls for the same creativity to match the demands that\nchanging circumstances are and will be making on business and industry. Within\nwhatever arrangement emerges, there is likely to be rebalancing, one which\ndoes not lose the importance of specialism and analysis and the detail but,\nlike the idea of a mechanical, linear world, this has become a special case –\nthe general case is firmly in the non-linear and systems arena.\n\nThe chart on page 189 summarises some of the dimensions of education and\ntraining that need to be rebalanced. It will look familiar as it has the same\nroots as the tables on pages 68 and 69. The headings in the left-hand column\ncharacterise the main approaches of the 20th century. The right-hand column\nindicates the directions in which we need to travel if we are to develop the\ninnovative and adaptable school leaver who is able to acquire new ‘habits of\nmind’.\n\nSystems thinking emphasises that skills have to be broadly understood. Even\nsomething as laudable as ‘problem solving’ carries with it an assumption that\na problem is capable of being fixed. This can be true but often it is not:\nproblem contextualising and intervention might be more appropriate: looking\nfor the systems and how to adjust system conditions.  \n\nExamples of rebalancing teaching and learning\n\nIn dynamic systems, there is no fix, just intervention and review, an\niterative process. As a consequence, since most real-life problems are\ncontingent, ‘solving’ them is much more likely to be a cross-disciplinary\neffort – in business it would be decision-making units working as a team. In\nteaching and learning, the emphasis would be on opportunities for\nparticipatory learning and creative and critical thinking, above all.\n\nTo conclude this chapter here is a short summary from the Ellen MacArthur\nFoundation’s contribution to an Aldersgate Group report6 which reflected on\nthe kinds of skills needed for the future. The chapter is Leadership for a\nCircular Economy:\n\n“Below we lay out our future vision as to what skills development will look\nlike as we move towards a circular economy, to ensure the leaders of the\nfuture are skilled appropriately. We need to support the learners of today to\nbecome:\n\nSystems thinkers – At present much learning and training is specialist. Whilst\nspecialist knowledge and technical skills will always be important it is\nessential to see the wood for the trees. Systems thinking at all levels\nenables people to take a broad, holistic view thus enabling them to make\nconnections and see possibilities, to adapt in response to feedback.\n\nPro-active, independent enquirers – Small children are naturally inquisitive.\nAs they progress through formal education and training this curiosity is\nburnished and encouraged. Learners and their teachers are rewarded for taking\nrisks, for exploring issues from different perspectives, for making reasoned\njudgements.\n\nSelf-managers – Learners organise their own time, establish their own\npriorities and are able and willing to change in the light of feedback. They\nlook actively for fresh opportunities, and manage their own learning to be\nable to rise to new challenges.  \n\nCreative innovators – No one has the monopoly of wisdom. As we explore the era\npost cheap oil and materials with its new and challenging predicaments,\neducation and training aim to develop creative people who can reframe the way\nwe think, come up with novel ways of optimising systems and creating multiple\nbenefits for a wide range of stakeholders including those as yet unborn.\n\nTeam workers, effective participators and empathetic colleagues – People are\nsocial beings and formal education empowers learners to be empathetic, to\nrespect the views of others and to contribute their own views, knowledge and\nskills clearly and with confidence. For this they need mastery of language and\nmathematics. They are able to work collaboratively and resolve disputes in\nwhich they are themselves a party.\n\nReflective practitioners committed to lifelong learning – Systems without\nfeedback are stupid, by definition, so feedback loops are essential to all\nmeaningful learning. Learners develop the habits of self-monitoring and\nreflection, listening to and offering constructive criticism, and making\nchanges. This never stops and formal education feeds into the greater project:\nlifelong learning.”\n\nREBALANCING THE SKILLS MIX\n\n![rebalanceSkills](image1132.jpg)\n\n\n11 THE GOLDEN THREAD: SYSTEMS, DIGITAL AND A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\n“So, in short, Tesla’s Master Plan, Part Deux is: Create stunning solar roofs\nwith seamlessly integrated battery storage.\n\nExpand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments.\n\nDevelop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive\nfleet learning. Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using\nit”\n\nElon Musk\n\nTesla’s success to date and their ambitious plans might have intrigued Kenneth\nBoulding as evidence of transition towards the ‘new technology’ he wanted:\n“... if the society toward which we are developing is not to be a nightmare of\nexhaustion, we must use the interlude of the present era to develop a new\ntechnology which is based on a circular flow of materials such that the only\nsources of man’s provisions will be his own waste products.” 1\n\nWhat Elon Musk is proposing is not primarily about vehicles, but mobility and\nabout harnessing the power of the sun and 100% recovery of the lithium in the\nbatteries. In some ways Elon’s proposals would have been incomprehensible in\n1970, the year Boulding published Economics as a Science. In other ways,\nBoulding was certainly an early systems thinker and wrote on the subject with\nsome passion. He was, to use the cliché, ahead of his time: an economist\nattracted to interdisciplinary work, much more attached to Darwin and\nevolution – open systems - than Newton and mechanism, which assumed closed\nsystems. Boulding also considered the importance of computing for revealing\nsomething of the patterns of systems dominated by feedback and presenting them\nas part of the evolution of our own consciousness. He perceived that a new\n“mindset” was crucial, perhaps even a pre-requisite. The link between Musk and\nBoulding becomes clearer as the story of the interaction of knowledge,\nmaterials and energy unfolds, and along it can be seen the golden thread of\ndigital. Digital created the modern, nuanced perception we call systems\nthinking or complexity science and in turn digital is making this world\npossible, in line with its own image. Perhaps our mindset is co-evolving. That\nwould be something both men would understand.\n\nThe circular economy is built on a feedback-rich systems perspective that came\nfully into focus after World War Two. The new technology of computing allowed\nus to really begin to show what happens in feedback-rich systems e.g. in\nweather and climate, in fluids; in ecosystems; in the economy. Previously,\ndreary and difficult manual calculation of what happens when the output of\ndynamic equations is fed back in as new input time after time meant the\nprocess did not usually go very far and the results were of limited use. We\nalready had the non-linear equations, just not the means to iterate them\nhundreds and thousands of times and to display the output meaningfully. The\nfirst modelling of real world systems emerged, modelling that is, which hadn’t\nbeen reduced to some oversimplified clockwork or ‘pipework’. It was not only a\ngenuinely new way of seeing the world but it became a new way of acting within\nit.\n\nIn the late sixties, this new worldview brought the first ‘big picture’ take\non the world of material resources, energy, population and economic growth,\nthe Limits to Growth (published in 1972). Like the image of the earth coming\nback from the moon, this report was mind changing for many. And how expensive\nan exercise it was then – this model was not revised for 30 years! Computing\nand what was increasingly called the information and communications technology\n(ICT) revolution soon got cheaper, of course, and more able to handle\ncomplexity, but it was still about feedback and what feedback does. A whole\nnew landscape appeared, and by the late 1970s, so did a whole new language\ntoo: of tipping points, fractals, attractors, ‘power-law’ relationships,\ntopographies and the ‘butterfly effect’.\n\nThe ‘circular’ in circular economy is a cipher for feedback, for closing the\nloop, but revealed in the light of the economy being part of an open system –\nbathed in the energy from the sun – and where decay and disorder are every bit\na reality as regeneration and restoration. Its order and its ability to endure\nare understood in that dynamic way, as an interplay between positive and\nbalancing feedbacks. It is not seen as an equilibrium that is disturbed and\nwill come back if it is allowed to, but as something which requires a system\nwide appreciation and sensitivity. Trying to influence the actions of a herd\nof wild horses is a useful analogy. This contrasts with the linear resources\neconomy. As we have seen, this is a system without much feedback if ever there\nwas one, since ‘stuff’ and energy flows through. A linear resources economy is\nrelieved only by largely mechanistic (closed system) models of the circular\nflows of income and expenditure, around the production and consumption of\ngoods and services. This conception of an economy is very much about assuming\na long run equilibrium. It can be disturbed but it settles back over time.\nAndy Haldane from the Bank of England is fond of using the analogy of the\nrocking horse. A rocking horse will come to rest after it has been knocked and\nso all will be well, the sum of individual decision-making will, in the right\nconditions, give the optimal outcome. Even this aspiration is usually very\nnarrow, very partial; focussing only on the monetised flows in the economy and\nexcludes those other social, non-monetary exchanges that are vital to human\neconomics.\n\nICT and the circular economy have a very deep relationship quite apart from\nthis big picture/different system orientation. The very means through which we\ncan imagine prosperity in a circular economy is through the ICT/systems\nperspective.\n\nThe additional materials and energy related feedback loops illustrated so\noften in the circular economy “butterfly” diagram can be seen as a reflection\nof the possibilities emerging from this digital revolution. The feedback\nloops, it might be argued, have always been there, and yet before the digital\nrevolution they were relatively underdeveloped in a modern economy, swamped by\n“throughput.” These loops are now revitalised, perhaps even transformed (or\nthey will be!) If Bill Clinton once insisted that ‘It’s the economy, stupid’,\nthen a new prosperity or direction looks like this: ‘It’s in the feedback,\nstupid.’\n\nAs described earlier, the potential for business models around products of\nservice, the sharing economy; product life extension; reuse, repair, reverse\nsupply chains, lies with what digital feedback does to disrupt the old\nrelationships. If we know what is happening during all stages of the creation,\nthe use of a product, its next use, the relationship with consumers and users\nin ways which were not possible before, then Elon Musk’s approach to Tesla is\nno surprise since it is more like software-with-wheels embedded in a\nnavigation system than anything ‘automotive’. The car for the individual, is\nmorphing into an intelligent multifaceted energy and mobility service for the\nindividual but spinning off social and environmental benefits. This is as far\nas you can get from naïve ‘drive less - conserve resources’ thinking. Many\npeople used to think that a circular economy shift was about materials and\nenergy prices and availability, but in the future it will seem as if resources\nprice spikes were just the prompt to accelerate the application of ICT and a\nsystems perspective more broadly.\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s work Growth Within outlined a vision for\ncircular economy in Europe in 2030, and it is notable that the lion’s share of\nthe economic opportunity highlighted in the report is directly linked to\ntechnological advances. Tracking systems and mobile apps, whether as a key\ndriver or a convenience factor, allow for a considerable jump in asset\nutilisation rates as well as material flows optimisation, the benefits of\nwhich add up to € 1.2 trillion - 2/3 of the overall potential. Taking a more\ndetailed look at technology as a key enabler of circularity, the Foundation\nsubsequently released its Intelligent Assets report, presenting early-stage\napplications in manufacturing, energy and utilities, built environment and\ninfrastructure, logistics and waste management, and agriculture and fishing.\n\nAuthor and digital pioneer Kevin Kelly considers that in the future\n“everything which can be shared, will be shared”. He is anticipating a very\ndifferent relationship; one of decentralised on demand services.\n\n“Moving from products to service is part of a broader trend, a shift to this\nnew world where things are liquid. This liquidity is something that shapes and\ninforms\n\nall the other trends. We have things that are flowing, we have the ability to\ndecentralise things, we have the sense that things are always moving, in\nflux.”\n\nKevin Kelly, founding executive of Wired magazine.\n\nI hear the sound of wild horses… It is about the connection, the flow within\nan optimised system over time – whatever that means, given that we are not\ndealing with a rocking horse economy. It is this optimisation question which\nbrings us back to the idea of stocks as well as flows. How does the\nsystemic/ICT interplay work out here? If transferred to the standard two cycle\ncircular economy diagram, there are clearly two kinds of capital illustrated:\n\n\\- On the biosphere side is natural capital and the focus here is to grasp and\nimplement the systemic sort of thinking which points to regenerative\nagriculture as absolutely key. This can be added to a complementary system\nwhere materials cascade, from coherence to dissolution. It is the consumption\ncycle after all, heading for regeneration through the soils, in the oceans and\nso on.\n\n\\- On the other side is the user cycle. If it’s not meant for use but\ndestruction, it belongs in the other materials pathway. In the use pathway,\nthe technosphere, it is maintenance of capital which is the key proposition,\nas Walter Stahel noted long ago. But here is also where the ICT and digital\neffects can be greatest. In redesigning on the basis of the user experience,\nthe service for the user, since by definition the bulk of the materials here\nare directed to products which are used to provide services but are not used\nup \\- or at least can be kept in service as long as it is appropriate to their\nuse cycle.\n\nWhatever happened to the classifieds?\n\n![Chapter 11 fig 1](image1167.jpg)\n\nExample of startups based on digital challenging the conventional everyday\nlives of New York City\n\nIn that sense Kevin Kelly’s intuition seems to be a real direction of travel,\nat least for all the physical tools we use every day: the major white goods,\ntelecoms, transport, buildings, offices, equipment. It is a perfect match for\nthe eco-systemic thinking on the biosphere side to see ICT focussed on\ncreating easy convenient access to products and assets. Overall it helps\ndesign out the throw away society by shifting part of it, the consumption\nelement to being a contribution to a regenerative cycle and the rest, the\ndurables, to an emphasis on use not consumption – while accepting that a\ncascade applies here too: from order to (eventual) disorder. The end point in\nthe technosphere is clean molecules, ready for rebuilding products and\ninfrastructure.\n\nSo, digital can be good news for knowledge, materials and energy… shall we\ncarry on the acceleration of its deployment? - it would be impossible to stop\nit. Perhaps this mix of convergent technologies, an associated worldview, a\nrefreshed economic lens is some sort of sign of a renaissance for our times.\nIt seems there is much more at stake than physical resources.\n\nEqually, a new prosperity, enabled by digital, is not an inevitable outcome.\nThere is no reason why it should be, and this is why creating the adapted\nsystem conditions is crucial to bring the potential positive impacts to life.\n\nIn a penetrating article2 Robin Chase describes two scenarios as a result of\nthe imminent deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In the first one that\nshe describes as “hell” she explains:\n\n“Simply eliminating the drivers from cars, and keeping everything else about\nour system the same, will be a disaster. Picture zombie cars — those with no\none in them — clogging our cities and our roads, because it will be cheaper to\nkeep them moving than to pay for expensive urban parking, and cheaper to bring\nretail to a customer than to pay rent on a retail store. While the number of\nvehicle miles driven skyrockets, our transportation infrastructure revenues,\ndependent on the gas tax, parking, fees, and fines will disappear.\nUnemployment will spike, as professional drivers will be laid off in droves.\nIt will be a nightmare of pollution, congestion, and social unrest.”\n\nTechnology is never neutral, it seems trite to repeat this phrase but with a\nsystem wide impact the effort which goes into making autonomous vehicles work\nfor us, for cities, will be tremendous, but so are the potential results. In\nher second scenario, Robin Chase outlines contrasting positive reinforcing\ncycles of change.\n\n“Instead, cities and countries must actively shape the introduction of AVs. We\nare getting access to this technical marvel at the precise moment when cities\nare full and bursting from the urbanizing of our planet, when we absolutely\nneed to transition rapidly from fossil fuels, and when it is imperative to\nimprove people’s access to opportunity: jobs, education, health services. We\nhave the ability to eliminate congestion, transform the liveability of cities,\nmake it possible to travel quickly and safely from A to B for the price of a\nbus ticket, improve the quality of our air, and make a significant dent in\nreducing CO2 emissions.”\n\nIf taxation under the existing system will fall away, how about the\ninfrastructure use fees instead? There would be many fewer accidents and many\nfewer hospital admissions from air pollution, and the street would be quieter.\nFor the users there would be some additional economic benefits: lowered costs\nof travel, up to 90% fewer vehicles perhaps3 . However large swathes of\nemployment are connected to car production and maintenance, healthcare,\ndriving, parking and administration. In New York alone there are 90,000\nlicensed taxi drivers. It was (too) easy to imagine that AVs were just new\ncars without drivers and that efficiencies of resource use would leave\neverything else unchanged. How short sighted! Of course answering the\nquestion: cui bono? (who benefits?) from shedding labour or reducing costs in\nthis new productivity surge is of great interest to Robin Chase. In her\narticle, something which starts off being about new technologies and mobility\nends up discussing ideas like a universal basic income to keep up spending\npower amongst citizens\n\nSimilarly, Doug Rushkoff, another early digital pioneer, has long called for a\nmore distributed, digitally enabled future. He believes that digital is\ncurrently being used to put ‘industrialism on steroids’, accentuating the\nextractive character so evident in the present. A comment in an online blog by\nGuy Wroble put this very well: “An economic model that is based on workers\nproviding the capital for their own tools and bearing the risk of individual\nbusiness failure while delivering profits to the owners of an algorithm is as\na sure a method returning income distribution to the feudal age as anyone\ncould devise.”\n\nRushkoff is keen that digital helps create and circulate value, not just find\nand extract it ever more comprehensively. His support for platform\ncooperatives is just one example (see box below). Since the tools are\nincreasingly within reach of everyone, why not use them? Rushkoff is also\ninterested in how we distil the logic and potential implications of what he\nsees as a digitally enabled renaissance. Renaissance is the rediscovery of old\nforms, often repressed, and their evolution and reinvigoration. It’s a big\nbold idea.\n\n“When you look at the original Renaissance, the capital-R Renaissance, you got\nperspective painting and the beginnings of calculus; you circumnavigated the\nglobe; you got the invention of the individual and a society that re-birthed\nthe old forms of ancient Rome and Greece.\n\nI believe we are also passing through a renaissance; but it’s a different one.\n\nInstead of perspective painting, we get the hologram or the fractal. Instead\nof calculus, we get chaos math and new physics. Instead of circumnavigating\nthe globe, we get orbiting the globe and seeing it as a single biome from\nabove. Instead of the birth of the individual in literature, we get the birth\nof the collective and an understanding of ourselves as a single organism.”\n\n“Platform cooperativism, is about cloning the technological heart of online\nplatforms and puts it to work with a cooperative model, one that puts workers,\nowners, communities, and cities in solidarity...”\n\nTrebor Scholtz\n\nSome examples:\n\n![cityOwned](image1190.jpg)\n\nThis is probably too much for most people who do not feel connected so much as\nexperience life as fragmented and uncertain, but there is consistency of\ndirection emerging from discussions of what digital can mean. It is not far to\ngo from this general notion of circularity, flow and an enhanced system as a\nwhole (one which is regenerative and restorative) – to looking at the aims of\nbusiness very differently. Rushkoff again:\n\n“It’s pretty simple. From the beginning you have to decide: do you want to run\na business or do you want to sell a business?\n\nIf you are developing a company in order to sell it — if you are playing ‘flip\nthis house’ — then you adopt a scorched earth, monopolistic, extractive\napproach to your market. You don’t want to have a good business; you just want\nto dominate a vertical...\n\nIf you decide you want to run a profitable business, then you start looking at\nthings like revenue or the health of your marketplace. You want to grow a\nmarket for your product and service, and you want that market to be {made} of\npeople who are healthy and wealthy — and ideally getting wealthier as they use\nyour product, as they use your service.\n\nYou want to have workers who (…) want to work at your company.”\n\nPerhaps this is why some commentators and circular economy agencies are keen\nto say that circularity is going well beyond resource efficiency as a “meme”\nor a shareable idea. Here is an example from Circular-IQ, based in Holland.\n\nIteration means ‘the process of doing something again and again, usually to\nimprove it’. It is feedback, the heart of systems thinking and if the economy\nbased on extraction is now undermining itself, then Rushkoff and others may\nhave built out the golden thread upon which the economy of the 21st century\nwill be spun: if the meme is ‘circularity’ then it implies stocks & flow,\nconnection, participation, ‘food’ for the system, regeneration, rather than\n‘linearity’ which is extraction, exclusion, ownership, waste, degradation of\ncapitals.\n\nIt may well be a renaissance in its profound implications – hold the capital R\nfor now - but it will not just fall into place. These things never do. One\nexample also shared by Robin Chase is the huge need to create and extend\nprotections for the user and the ‘gig’ (on demand) economy worker, if so much\nis going to hinge on shifting from ‘possession to access.’ The trade off\nshould not be one where a better service and elegant resource use comes with\nhaving to trust the supplier to maintain supply, or maintain low prices, even\nif they are a quasi monopoly. It probably means low prices which are the\nresult of genuine efficiencies not bought through the casualization of the\nworkforce. This dual protection encourages the access over ownership shift and\ncomplements and takes us beyond the levels of consumer and employment\nprotection some already enjoy (and which built up in times perhaps less\nfrenetic than our own). It is the users’ and workers’ data after all; it is\nthe user or worker as a citizen not slave, freedoms will have to extend beyond\nthe choice of service, it is going to have to be better, for example, than the\nwell known and long held associations between ownership (property) and\ndemocracy if we are expecting access over ownership to be the component of a\ncircular economy it needs to be.\n\nEarlier, drawing on Heraclitus’ comment that “All things come through strife\nand necessity” we came to the essence of change in dynamic systems- that there\nis both ‘revolt’ and ‘remember’ (a shock and a degree of resilience).\nDigitally enabled ‘access’ has to do the job better, provide real benefits\nwhich are identifiable, yet ‘ownership’ remains the default position. We might\nstrive but the system conditions, it’s path dependency create a necessity\nwhich takes time, sometimes a very long time, to overcome. Perhaps we are now\nseeing these two tracks running side by side. Author and economics commentator\nPaul Mason, like Jeremy Rifkin, articulates a sense of this happening as\ndigital becomes cheaper and more ubiquitous and the existing system becomes\nincreasingly dysfunctional year by year - or is that month-by-month? He\nwrites:\n\nToday the terrain of capitalism has changed: it is global, fragmentary, geared\nto small-scale choices, temporary work and multiple skill-sets. Consumption\nhas become a form of self-expression – and millions of people have a stake in\nthe finance system that they did not have before. With the new terrain, the\nold path is lost. But a different path has opened up. Collaborative\nproduction, using network technology to produce goods and services that work\nonly when they are free, or shared, defines the route beyond the market\nsystem. It will need the state to create the framework, and the post\ncapitalist sector might coexist with the market sector for decades. But it is\nhappening.” 4\n\n\n12 REASON IN AN AGE OF UNREASON\n\n![](image1209.jpg)\n\nComplex systems rise, maintain themselves, or fall through iteration. Feedback\nrules. It is time, now the end of this book is in sight, to look forward to\nthe next iteration, by first looking back. As we know the basics of a circular\neconomy are decades old at least, if conceived of as an economy which might\nenable us to become ‘at home in the modern world.’ It is not a rejection of\nindustrialisation - far from it - but a reconnection and a recontextualisation\nof it. John Lyle wrote cogently on this many years ago when he made the\ndistinction between what he called ‘degenerative and regenerative economies’:\n\n“Industrial systems are the products of recent western technology in its\npurest form, shaped by engineering criteria that seek high levels of\nproductivity and operational efficiency to the virtual exclusion all other\nconcerns. Therein lies their utility and occasional grandiose beauty - and\ntheir incipient failure.\n\nRegenerative systems, by contrast, are enmeshed in natural and social\nprocesses in ways that make their purpose far more complex. While technology\nremains the means for augmenting nature, it ideally becomes a factor within\nthe larger social and ecological context, rather than the engine driving that\ncomplex.\n\nFurthermore, with the need to interrelate technology with society and nature,\na broad and disparate knowledge enters the process.”\n\nJohn T Lyle, Regenerative Design, 1994\n\n“I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of\nthe old ones”\n\nJohn Cage, musician\n\nIn this book the case is made that a circular economy has its roots in the\nupdating of our scientific understanding, to acknowledge ordered complexity as\nthe heart of almost all real world systems and relocate the linear as a\nlimited case, not the general case. It is a new ‘lens’ through which to view\nthe economy, especially as it relates to resources, energy and information\nflows. Lyle’s ‘broad and disparate knowledge’ enters the process and speaks to\nnew ‘habits of thought’ orientated towards systems thinking, with its big\npicture, longer term, pattern seeking concerns. At its best a circular economy\nis capable of rebuilding capitals, optimising flows and evolving, not merely\nenduring.\n\nIteration can work negatively too, slowing down change.\n\nAlthough Lyle and de Rosnay, for example, locate the systems thinking or\n‘complexity’ revolution in the advent of computer modelling at MIT after World\nWar II, it is significant that in many respects it has been very slow\nprogress. Even after a flurry of interest in business circles in the early\n1990s – paralleling the rise of complexity science after the desk top\ncomputing revolution of the period - interest has subsided through to the\npresent day, gone underground or to the ‘geeks’ in finance and digital. The\ngeeks have had something of a better time of in recent years as the phenomenal\nrise of Google, Facebook, and Uber shows: the very essence of systems thinking\n- pattern recognition - is their stock in trade. It is still not widely\naccepted as anything more than a tool, much less evidence of Rushkoff’s\nrenaissance (see chapter 11). This lack of change is a systems artefact too. A\ndominant worldview is just that: dominant everywhere. It is much the same in\nschool education, where creative and critical thinking – tapping the higher\norder skills of analysis, evaluation, synthesis and creativity is undervalued\nin practice, swamped by assessments and attempts to lift achievement scores in\nhighly formalised structures. Perhaps the interest in these skills was never\ngoing to be mainstream, at least if it is schooling rather than education\nwhich is at question. This echoes so much the discussion in this book around\nthe tension between established hierarchy and the new autonomy promised by the\ndevolved and devolving of digital tools:\n\n“Public school systems have always had two primary purposes, and critical\nthinking is not one of them. The schools are designed to prepare students for\nthe marketplace and to make them loyal citizens. The marketplace is most often\na top-down, authoritarian world and loyalty comes from myth-making and\nemotional bonds. In both cases, really effective critical thinking might well\nbe incompatible with the desired end.”\n\nLawrence Davidson 1\n\nSo, traditional subject boundaries remain pretty much intact and there has\nbeen the impact of ‘back to basics’ and a knowledge focus which carries a\nretrenchment into the linear model. In times of uncertainty there is always a\ntendency to conservatism and fundamentalism. It is paradoxical that in these\ntimes of uncertainty, the higher order skills and the people deploying them\nare evidently most valuable to a society, as it tries to remake itself.\n\nWhen will the walls of Jericho fall?\n\nIn the current dislocated and distracted era it is unsettling to think that\nScience (with a capital S) as the arbiter of worthwhile knowledge is treated\nwith suspicion or roundly ignored in preference to opinion and prejudice, with\nvery little remaining in the way of general social sanction. Where once we\nlooked to experts – and grumbled at their patronising manner - we now have\nblogs and twitter to amplify the noise from the street. It’s the persistent\ntinnitus of modern life. Instead of being a laughing stock, the unreasonable\nbecomes acceptable by repetition and punditry as evidenced all over the world\nin elections after the financial crash brought the Great Recession. A society\nmade to believe that it is composed of self-interested sovereign consumers\nsoon assumes that, deciding the merits of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR)\nvaccine, or what a changing climate entails, is as much within its remit as\nwhat to have on a family meal out. And if extreme politicians raise a\npopulist, simplistic banner, then that is just fine too. Now it is acceptable\nto declare prejudice and ignorance under the guise of self-expression. This is\nnot a favourable climate in which to say that the economy resembles a herd of\nwild horses which we propose to influence and ‘nudge’ in the direction we\ndesire, rather than a good old machine with levers, or to continue the\nanalogy, something like a rocking horse which will always come right in the\nend, if only we follow strict market rules. But that is the challenge of being\ncaught between two narratives about the world, as we are now.\n\nAt the front end of the book, the early summary of a circular economy made a\nplay for the role of active citizens in a thriving democracy. Almost everyone\nwould say that, surely? It sounds like a throwaway line. Actually it is\nneither cheap nor obvious. According to Herman Daly, abundance and excess\ncapacity is a pre-requisite for freedom and democracy. Scarcity and the\nstruggle for resources breed authoritarianism. It seems that if we value\nfreedom and democracy, the circular economy has to deliver and it has to\ndeliver access and abundance. It has to be a route to widespread prosperity,\nalbeit of a different character than we know now. It is this dual aspiration\nwhich marks the circular economy out – designed to promote a regenerative and\nrestorative relationship with the environment as a source of all resources,\nwhile enabling sufficient abundance for democratic approaches to find\ntraction. If anyone thought that all this was just a question of finite\ncritical materials, dirty fossil fuels and oceans turning to plastic soup,\nthey are missing a great deal. Daly warns of working right up to the limits of\nnatural capital, even if we could.\n\n‘Excess carrying capacity is a necessary condition for freedom and democracy.\nLiving close to the limit of carrying capacity, as on a submarine or\nspaceship, requires very strict discipline. On submarines we have a captain\nwith absolute authority, not a democracy. If we want democracy, we better not\ngrow up to the limit of carrying capacity — better to leave some slack, some\nmargin for tolerance of the disagreements and errors that freedom entails.\n\nThe more obvious political cost of growth is war for access to rival resources\n- minerals, water, agricultural land, and the remaining commons. The hope that\neconomic growth would mean ever more things for ever more people, and would\ntherefore keep the hounds of war at bay, may have been temporarily credible in\nyesterday’s empty world, but not in today’s full world.’2\n\nA circular economy operated at the limits might be so complex as to be\nunmanageable within an acceptable political system, it might be an economy\nwhich breeds conflict and perhaps ‘uneconomic growth’ (its social costs\ngreater than its economic and environmental benefits). This, says Joseph\nTainter, is the fate of all complex civilisations3 . On the other hand, if\nAmory Lovins and others are right, there is so much slack in the economy, so\nmuch waste, so much depleted capital that could be rebuilt, that the danger of\nrunning to the notional limits is small, at least for now. And if we think\nvery differently, not least about what growth means and how it works out for\nthe wider polity… Here is entrepreneur Nick Hanauer on prosperity and wealth:\n\n“Prosperity in human societies can’t be properly understood by just looking at\nmonetary measures of income or wealth. Prosperity in a society is the\naccumulation of solutions to human problems.\n\nThese solutions run from the prosaic, like a crunchier potato chip, to the\nprofound, like cures for deadly diseases. Ultimately, the measure of a\nsociety’s wealth is the range of human problems that it has found a way to\nsolve and how available it has made those solutions to its citizens.”\n\nAmory Lovins is a world-class thinker in the rational tradition, but many of\nhis ideas do require an appreciation of systems complexity and how important\nit might be to rethink existing infrastructure. An informed citizenry is\nrequired and one relaxed enough and prosperous enough to want to explore the\nnew, to try some things out via private business or pubic investment (as with\nmost important infrastructure).\n\nInstead, the middle classes in many countries are struggling to hold onto the\nadvantages gained in an era of linear economics characterized by cheap energy,\nmaterials and available credit, free education and low cost health and\nwelfare. It is now often wary of science and ‘ideas’ in general. In an era of\njobless growth, conformity and emotional bonds pay more dividends year in year\nout. The task is to find a way into the winner’s enclosure for themselves and\ntheir children, and fast. Below them, is an increasingly casualised labour\nforce with little time or inclination and even less of a toehold in the\nsystem. What prospects then for circularity?\n\nIn a stubbornly irrational world where scarcity, indebtedness and lack of\nopportunity is assumed and power wielded accordingly, there would be little to\nsay about ‘circularity’. At best it would be a tool to alleviate decline to\neke out some additional revenue on the way down: a miserable outcome.\n\nThe era of computing first showed us the patterns of our complex real world\nsystems, then it began to show us how to work with them. Right now we have\nseen the possibilities, the very edges of what is possible. The economy, as\nPaul Mason and Jeremy Rifkin and many others assert, is faced with the falling\nmarginal cost of everything; there is a real possibility of both access and\nabundance. The tools for this are not and need not be separated from the\npeople who wish to use them. Mason calls it social production, and for sure\nit’s not for everything we need, but the economy has to be able to work at all\nlevels and previously, the industrial era solved this by increasing scale and\nefficiency. “Go big, go really big and get the variable costs down, so making\nworkers productive, and prices low.” It rolled over so many of the small\nproducers that it almost feels like they are folk memories outside the\nexperience of today’s consumers. It worked of course, and might be seen as\ninevitable once fossil fuels were tapped. It also had the usual downsides of\nhaving to market the hell out of the product, to provide credit if workers\ncould not immediately afford, create built-in obsolescence, to transfer costs\nto society and environment. Now, through better design and different business\nmodels and ubiquitous feedback from the digital revolution, there is the\npossibility of working on somewhat smaller scales, with a shift to products of\nservice, with custom short run production based on additive manufacture. And\nso a system overwhelmingly based on scale and selling can be outcompeted in\nmany, many segments by medium and small scale operations leveraging both the\navailable feedback about products, components and materials, but also the\ndistributed energy grids, the network understanding and the vast numbers of\nbright young people who have no real chance of joining the traditional\ncorporations or public service. They will not remain idle, they will catalyse\nchange. This spins off so much in the way of using resources better.\nExternalities become internalised as benefits.\n\nThe role of enabling conditions remains as crucial as it is disabling at\npresent. The notion of ‘circularity’ that assumes that loops are closed, that\nthe big transformative identities4 of the economic world are indeed just\ndifferent descriptions of one continuous set of processes, need to be front\nand centre. As Braungart and others asserted decades ago: the aim is\neffectiveness not just efficiency, that in the final wash up the benefits of\neffective flows and rebuilt capitals are so far and away bigger, better and\nmore enduring than a linear system that it becomes a no-brainer. We can\nincreasingly modify and often undermine the only thing which efficiency really\nhad which was scale and selling at an artificially low price – a price which\ndid not reflect full costs. In this new model the economic identities are (by\nnow familiar): waste becomes food, indeed everything is food - by design not\naccident; Income equals expenditure - the circular flow working well not\nsnagged up, since customers create wealth by their expenditure and income is\nrequired to meet the needs of every human in the modern world. Customers are\nwhat enterprise and capitalism needs just as much. Money equals ‘stuff’,\nprimarily it is a medium of exchange but it is no longer seen as oil for the\nmachinery or rather, it is that but also it is a kind of rocket fuel if\nprovided as credit to bring forward production and consumption. It is part of\nthe model. The other side of an enabling government role is in tax shifting\naway from people (and other renewables) to resource use fees on all non-\nrenewables. It is hardly new but it fits completely the idea of creating\neffective cycles and with it spendable income and Hanauer’s accessible and\nvaried solutions, as well as excellent resource efficiency and worthwhile\nmaterials recovery.\n\nTo be truly disruptive, the acceleration of a transition towards a circular\neconomy encompasses the logic of a systems perspective, and works as well at\nthe micro as the macro scale. It is a nested (fractal) arrangement after all.\nIf combined, the strands of a devolved (empowering) and sharing (social\ncapital building) economy, collaborative use and new kinds of abundance from\ncircularity (effective materials and energy flows) can fuel the interests of\nthe winners to push for revised “rules of the game” (tax shifting) to create a\nnew and truly level playing field. Further capitalisation on knowledge,\nsupercharged by the digital revolution, in order to find progressively more\nnuanced and elegant solutions, will accelerate change in a positive\nreinforcing cycle. It’s all of the above, synergistically related which makes\nthe difference.\n\n“The economy is society’s metabolism”\n\nHeun, et al 5\n\nThe circularity narrative – a story based on metaphor, as well as being a\ntoolkit of how to achieve it - could bring a new widespread prosperity by\neventually outcompeting the old.\n\nWith more widespread economic participation, comes a revival in democratic\nprocesses and the valuing of scientifically based debate. People do value\nresults. The use of the science of complexity – to provide the rationale which\nenables optimised systems, multiple cash flows, cascaded materials and closed\nloops, will be acknowledged as the roots of how enduring economic prosperity\ncan be delivered. With that broad spectrum success, the new business, social\nand political leaderships who gain from it then enshrine and entrain these\nideas in new iterations of the education system, economics, culture and\ntechnology, just as surely as the beneficiaries of the ideas of an earlier\nEnlightenment did two hundred years ago … because they worked.\n\nA REGENERATIVE CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\ncan be seen as the effective flow of materials, energy and information in\nrelation to maintenance or increase of stocks of capital: ECONOMIC, SOCIAL,\nHUMAN AND NATURAL.  \n\n​• ​ It uses insights from the functioning of non-linear systems – feedback-\nrich systems, and especially living systems – as a framework for thinking.\n\n​• ​ Its study is likely to have in mind nested systems (fractal scale,\ndiverse periodicities) with histories and entrainment but also emergent\nproperties and the possibility of evolution.\n\n​• ​ Characterisation: the bigger picture, the longer term and by intention\n(design).\n\n​• ​ The circular economy can be explored through a number of identities and\none related shift. In a circular (feedback-rich) system the endless\ntransformation means that one side of the equation has an intimate\nrelationship with the other if it is to ‘work’ optimally as a system.\n\n​• ​ Using the three categories of materials, energy and information and\ninformed by systems thinking, the four identities fall into place.\n\nMATERIALS\n\nWASTE = FOOD\n\nMaterials flows are ideally in either biological or technical cycles\n\nWASTE = FOOD BIOLOGICAL\n\nThis is a consumer pathway\n\nBiological materials cascade\n\nValue is extracted in stages towards the final decomposition and reuse in the\nsystem.\n\nEliminate toxics.\n\nWASTE = FOOD TECHNICAL\n\nThis is a user pathway.\n\nTechnical materials can cascade\n\nValue is related to maintenance of quality and embedded energy for defined use\nperiods.\n\nUpcycling (adding quality or upgrading) is possible with sufficient surplus\nenergy\n\nENERGY\n\nSHIFT > RENEWABLES\n\nA progressive shift towards renewables over time, Assisted by lowered energy\nthresholds via the impacts of better design and remarketing, reuse,\nrefurbishment, repair and remanufacturing and the continuing fall in price for\nrenewables.\n\nUse of current solar income not stored (i.e. fossil fuels)  \n\nINFORMATION\n\nPRICES = FULL COSTS\n\nMONEY = MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE  \n\nPRICES = FULL COSTS\n\nDIVERSITY = STRENGTH\n\nMarkets are effective arbiters of resource allocation when rational decision-\nmaking is possible.\n\nPrices are messages and therefore need to accurately reflect all costs.  \n\nMONEY = MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE\n\nMaterials and service flows require appropriate and sufficient medium of\nexchange to be effective - includes complementary currencies.  \n\nDIVERSITY = STRENGTH\n\nA dynamic relationship between efficiency and resilience.\n\nThe role of diversity in feedback–rich systems is to provide both resilience\nand innovation (creativity and its application) in response to change.\n\n\nNotes and references\n\nI NTRODUCTION\n\n1 Paul Ormerod, Butterfly Economics, A New General Theory of Social and\nEconomic Behaviour (Basic Books, 1998).\n\n2 Eric Beinhocker, The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity and the Radical\nRemaking of Economics (Random House, 2007).\n\n3 Nick Hanauer and Eric Liu, Gardens of Democracy: A New American Story of\nCitizenship, the Economy, and the Role of Government (Sasquatch Books, 2011).\n\n4 Amory Lovins, Reinventing Fire http://www.rmi.org/ReinventingFire\n\n5 see http://www.natcap.org/images/other/NCsynopsis.pdf\n\n6 From the Preface to Amory Lovins, Hunter Lovins and Paul Hawken, Natural\nCapitalism: Creating the next Industrial Revolution (Earthscan, 1999).\n\n7 http://www.c2ccertified.org/\n\n8 Hanauer and Liu, op. cit.\n\nCHAPTER 1 ALL THE FLOWS, HISTORY TOO\n\n1 http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fenrg.2013.00009/full\n\n2 http://www.unccd.int/en/media-center/Press-Releases/Pages/Press-Release-\nDetail.aspx?PRId=44\n\n3 ‘All together now and picking up pace?’, New Scientist (2008).\n\n4 Bankrupting Nature, by Anders Wijkman and Johan Rockström, The Future by Al\nGore, and the Worldwatch Institute series State of the World and Vital Signs\nhttp://www.worldwatch.org/\n\n5 http://www.gmo.com/websitecontent/GMO_QtlyLetter_ALL_4Q2013.pdf\n\n6 http://uk.businessinsider.com/jeremy-grantham-on-oil-economic-growth-2014-11\n\n7 A new oil strike can be a ‘gusher’, requiring little additional energy to\nproduce the oil – a ratio of 100:1 indicates 1 barrel of oil is required to\nextract 100 barrels of oil.

Since its creation the\ncharity has emerged as a global thought leader, establishing circular economy\non the agenda of decision makers across business, government and academia. The\ncharity’s work focuses on four interlinking areas:  \n\nEDUCATION\n\nInspiring learners to re-think the future through the circular economy\nframework\n\nWe’re creating a global teaching and learning platform built around the\ncircular economy framework, working in both formal and informal education.\nWith an emphasis on online learning, the Foundation provides cutting edge\ninsights and content to support circular economy education and the systems\nthinking required to accelerate a transition.\n\nOur formal education work includes comprehensive Higher Education programmes\nwith partners in Europe, the US, India, China and South America, international\ncurriculum development with schools and colleges, and corporate capacity\nbuilding programmes. In the informal education arena our work includes Re-\nthinking Progress, an open house educational event, and the Disruptive\nInnovation Festival, a global online and face-to-face opportunity to explore\nthe changing economy and how best to respond to it.\n\nBusiness and government\n\nCatalysing circular innovation and creating the conditions for it to flourish\n\nSince launch, we’ve emphasised the real-world relevance of our activities and\nunderstand that business innovation sits at the heart of any transition to the\ncircular economy. The Foundation works with Global Partners (Cisco, Google,\nH&M, Intesa Sanpaolo, Kingfisher, NIKE Inc., Philips, Renault, and Unilever)\nto develop circular business initiatives and to address challenges to\nimplementing them.\n\nIn 2013, with the support of our Global Partners, we created the first\ndedicatedcircular economy innovation programme, the Circular Economy 100.\nProgramme members comprise industry leading corporations, emerging innovators\n(SMEs), affiliate networks, government authorities, regions and cities. The\nCE100 provides a unique forum for building circular capabilities, addressing\ncommon barriers to progress, understanding the necessary enabling conditions,\nand piloting circular practices in a collaborative environment.\n\nInsight and Analysis\n\nProviding robust evidence about the benefits of the transition\n\nWe work to quantify the economic potential of the circular model and develop\napproaches for capturing this value. Our insight and analysis feeds into a\ngrowing body of economic reports highlighting the rationale for an accelerated\ntransition towards the circular economy, and exploring the potential benefits\nacross different stakeholders and sectors.\n\nThe Foundation believes the circular economy is an evolving framework, and\ncontinues to widen its understanding by working with international experts\nincluding key thinkers and leading academics.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nENGAGING A GLOBAL AUDIANCE AROUND THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nThe Foundation communicates cutting edge ideas and insight through its\ncircular economy research, reports, case studies and books disseminated\nthrough our publications arm. We utilise new and relevant digital media to\nreach audiences who can accelerate the transition, globally. In addition, we\naggregate, curate, and make knowledge accessible through Circulate, an online\nlocation dedicated to providing up to date news and unique insight on the\ncircular economy and related subjects.\n\n[www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org](http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org)\n\n\n“A Wealth of Flows is a huge addition helping to make circular economy a\nreality. The book creates a clear and vivid overview of how a circular economy\ncan look like and what kind of changes we have to make. This way, more and\nmore people understand what it exactly means in practice, and how brilliant\nour future can be.”\n\nProf. Dr. Michael Braungart , founder and CEO of EPEA Internationale\nUmweltforschung GmbH.\n\n“Ken Webster has provided a compelling overview of one of the big ideas – and\nimperatives – of our time: how to convert our linear economy, that excels in\nmaking waste out of natural resources, into a circular economy that cycles and\nrecycles resources to the benefit of humans and the environment. This book\nneeds to be very widely read.”\n\nPaul Ekins , Pr. of Resources and Environmental Policy and Director of the UCL\nInstitute for Sustainable Resources.\n\n“Ken Webster shows us how the circular economy moves us beyond our current\nworld of limits based on “less is more” and shows us a world of recurrent\nabundance based on “endless is more”. The circular economy is rich with growth\nopportunities for all generations; it is going to take us all, and it is going\nto take forever... and that is the point.”\n\nBill McDonough , founding principal of William McDonough & Partners, co-\nfounder of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry (MBDC).\n\n“Ken Webster’s book is more than a message of hope for a better path forward.\nIt is a vivid and colorful illustration of how the circular economy is growing\nto challenge and ultimately replace the polluting and wasteful manufacturing\nindustries of past centuries.”\n\nWendy Schmidt , Founder of The Schmidt Family Foundation, The Schmidt Ocean\nInstitute\n\n“Ken Webster offers a comprehensive solutions set to today’s economic and\nenvironmental challenges. The Circular Economy: A Wealth of Flows provides\ninspiration, and details a future state for our economy that is balanced,\nrestorative and beneficial - for all.”\n\nMarty Neese , Chief Operating Officer of SunPower\n\n“Thorough, yet lively and often intriguing, Webster’s book gives the\ninterested reader an in-depth understanding of the key concepts behind the\ncircular economy, backed with a multitude of real-world case histories,\nrelevant quotes and extracts, and examples that demonstrate why the CE should\nbe the wave of the future. This book is a terrific resource and highly\nrecommend to anyone interested in circular economy and resource efficiency.”\n\nNabil Nasr , Ph.D. Associate Provost for Academic Affairs & Director, Golisano\nInstitute for Sustainability, Rochester Institute of Technology  \n\n\nEllen MacArthur Foundation Publishing\n\nThe Sail Loft\n\n42 Medina Road\n\nCowes\n\nIsle of Wight PO31 7BX\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nwww.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org\n\nCopyright © Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2016\n\nISBN 978-0-9927784-5-3\n\n2nd edition Ellen MacArthur Foundation Publishing\n\nA catalogue record for this book is available from the British Library.
