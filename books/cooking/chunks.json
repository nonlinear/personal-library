If your yeast doesn\u2019t activate then throw it away and use some fresh yeast.  2.Once your yeast has been activated your can move onto the next step which is adding all the wet ingredients to a standing mixer. Combine the activated yeast, sugar, the rest of the water, and the eggs until every kind of comes together.  3.Then in another bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually mix the flour mixture into wet ingredients. Once the dough comes together let dough rest for 20 minutes. 4.Once your wet ingredients has absorbed your flour, slowly throw in your butter pieces by piece until all the butter is incorporated into the dough.  5.Knead the dough in the mixer for about 10 minutes more or until you get a smooth, elastic, and supple dough.  6.Take the dough out and knead for another 2 - 3 minutes just to shape it a bit more and to form it into a ball. Then set it in a grease proofed bowl. Let it rise for about 1 \u00bd hours or until it doubles in size. The timing on this varies from room to room. Say your kitchen is very cold, it will take longer so it would be best to leave it in the oven with the light on. With four of the pieces, roll them into tight balls, stamp them with the kaiser roll stamper. 7.Once the dough has proofed, knock out the air and pat it into a rectangle. From the side furthest away from you pinch it and roll in towards you to create a log shape. Roll outwards from the center.  8.Cut out 6 pieces lengthwise (about 177 grams each) and braid into a 6 braided challah. You can check out my video to see how I did that here.  9.Place the braided challah onto a parchment lined baking tray and let the dough rise for another 1 - 1 \u00bd hours or until the dough has doubled in size.  10.Preheat your oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit and egg wash your challah bread.  11.Lastly sprinkle on some poppy seeds and bake for 35 minutes!",

Ingredients: \u2022\u00bc cup of wheat berries  \u20222 tablespoons of sunflower seeds  \u20222 tablespoons of flax seeds  \u20222 tablespoons of pumpkin seeds  \u2022500 grams of water \u2022350 grams rye flour  \u2022350 grams whole wheat  \u2022130 grams of starter  \u20221 tablespoon of molasses \u202215 grams of fine salt Instructions: 1.The night before place \u00bc cup of wheat berries, 2 tbsp of sunflower seeds, 2 tbsp of flax seeds, and 2 tbsp of pumpkin seeds in a mason jar and add enough water to cover. Let them hydrate overnight. 2.In a large bowl add 350 grams rye flour, 350 grams whole wheat, and 500 grams of water and mix with a danish whisk to combine. Let it autolyse for about 30 minutes. In the meantime drain your hydrated seeds and set aside. 3.Once your bread has rested add in 130 grams of starter, 1 tablespoon of molasses, 15 grams of fine salt, and the hydrated seeds. Fold everything into your dough until it is incorporated and let it rest for 1 hour.  4.After the hour is up give it a stretch and fold. It will be a bit hard to do since there isn\u2019t much gluten in the dough. Do the best you can and then give it a rest for 30 minutes. Repeat this step three more times for a total of four stretch and folds. 5.After all the stretch and folds are done, place the dough into the fridge overnight for its bulk ferment.  6.In the morning, shape it into a tight log and place it into your greased pullman loaf pan. Let it rise for about 3 hours on your counter. Once you notice that it has risen, give it a couple of scores and close up your pullman loaf pan.   7.Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes are up, take off the pullman loaf lid and bake for an additional 20 minutes. Let your rye wheat bread cool off until you are able to handle it.",
