These books aim to serve as a go-to resource for think­\ning on specific texts and series and for prompting further inquiry. Each \nbook will be less than 30,000 words and structured similarly to facilitate \nclassroom use. Focusing specifically on literature, the books will also \naddress film and TV adaptations of the texts as relevant. Beginning with \nbackground and context on the text’s place in the field, the author and \nhow this text fits in their oeuvre, and the socio-historical reception of the \ntext, the books will provide an understanding of how students, readers, \nand scholars can think dynamically about a given text. Each book will \ndescribe the major approaches to the text and how the critical engage­\nments with the text have shaped SFF. Engaging with classic works as well \nas recent books that have been taken up by SFF fans and scholars, the goal \nof the series is not to be the arbiters of canonical importance, but to show \nhow sustained critical analysis of these texts might bring about a new \ncanon. In addition to their suitability for undergraduate courses, the books \nwill appeal to fans of SFF.\n",

Speculative fic­\ntion in all its forms has been considered a genre, a medium, a mode, a \npractice, a compilation of themes, or a web of assertions. With this in \nmind, “Palgrave Science Fiction and Fantasy: A New Canon” offers an \nexpansive and dynamic approach to thinking SFF, destabilizing notions of \nthe canon, so long associated with privilege, power, class, and hegemony. \nWe take canon not as a singular and unchallenged authority but as shifting \nand thoughtful consensus among an always-growing collective of readers, \nscholars, and writers.\nThe cultural practice and production of speculation have encompassed \nnovels, stories, plays, games, music, comics, and other media, with a lin­\neage dating back at least to the nineteenth-century precursors through to \nthe most recent publications. Existing scholarship has considered some of \nthese media extensively, often with particular focus on film and TV. It is \nfor this reason that “Palgrave Science Fiction and Fantasy” will forgo the \ncinematic and televisual, aspiring to direct critical attention at the other \nnodes of SFF expression.\nEach volume in the series introduces, contextualizes, and analyzes a \nsingle work of SFF that ranges from the acknowledged “classic” to the \nshould-be-classic, and asks two basic, but provocative questions: Why does \nthis text matter to SFF? and Why does (or should) this text matter to SFF \nreaders, scholars, and fans? Thus, the series joins into conversation both \nwith scholars and with students of the field to examine the parameters of \nSeries Preface\n",

A Wizard of \nEarthsea debuted in 1968, a year that proved pivotal in the history of the \nstill nascent fantasy genre and a turning point in Le Guin’s own literary \ncareer as well. While the book was neither the author’s first published \nnovel nor even her first published story set on the fictional archipelago of \nEarthsea, the immediate success of A Wizard of Earthsea set her on the \npath to becoming the towering presence across multiple literary genres \nthat she quickly became, and indeed ultimately the second woman to \nreceive, in 2003, the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award from \nthe Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Early in her own \ncareer, she tasked herself with the challenge of imagining the early career \nof greatness, the boyhood of a Merlin or a Gandalf, those wizened fonts of \narcane knowledges and hard-earned wisdom, as she explains in her 2012 \nafterword to the novel: “Well, Merlin and Gandalf must have been young \nonce, right? And when they were young, when they were fool kids, how \ndid they learn to be wizards? And there was my book” (“Afterword” \n129).2 To imagine a “portrait of the wizard as a young man” as A Wizard \nof Earthsea does was still a novel concept in the 1960s, although in the \ndecades since the school for wizards has effectively become a genre cate­\ngory unto itself, particularly in the YA sphere.3 Only two chapters of A \nWizard of Earthsea take the form of a school story, however, and the \neducation of Ged, her young wizard, takes place across many of the islands \nof Earthsea and within himself, culminating in, as Le Guin puts it, “the \nkind of victory that isn’t the end of a battle but the beginning of a life” \n(“Afterword” 130). Ged’s long struggle to recognize, acknowledge, and \ncome to terms with his own “shadow” self has generated a substantial his­\ntory of critical interpretations that range in character from the psychologi­\ncal to the theological to the ethical and more.\n2 Unless otherwise noted, all references to Le Guin’s Earthsea novels and stories are taken \nfrom the 2018 omnibus edition The Books of Earthsea, which also collects the author’s 2012 \nafterwords and her important 1993 essay “Earthsea Revisioned.”\n3 Later fantasies concerned with magical pedagogy include the Chrestomanci books by \nDianna Wynne Jones (1977–2006), Neil Gaiman’s comic miniseries The Books of Magic \n(1990–1991), and J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter heptalogy (1997–2007), among many others.\n \nT. S. MILLER\n",

While Le Guin wrote \nthe first two sequels very rapidly after the breakout success of \nWizard—1970’s The Tombs of Atuan and 1972’s The Farthest Shore—she \nwould return again and again to this secondary world at different points in \nher life and literary career until the final posthumous publication of a last \nEarthsea short story in a venue as prestigious as The Paris Review, of all \nthe once unthinkable places to conclude a series begun in the rather pulpy \ngenre magazine Fantastic Stories of Imagination (with the 1964 story \n“The Word of Unbinding”). That valedictory story, “Firelight,” itself \nlooks back with special fondness and wistfulness on the events and settings \ndescribed in A Wizard of Earthsea: “He lost the thread of his thoughts in \na surge of slow, bodily memories of his childhood in that steep village, the \ndank bedding, the smell of woodsmoke in the dark house in the bitter \nwinter cold” (972). Today A Wizard of Earthsea continues to lie at the \nnexus of several overlapping issues in fantasy studies related to young adult \nliterature, gender, race, adaptation, and theoretical considerations of what \nfantasy and fantasy worlds “mean” and how the genre should be read and \nunderstood, almost as firmly lodged in the center of that “fuzzy set” Brian \nAttebery proposes as a framework for defining fantasy as Tolkien’s The \nLord of the Rings.4\n4 See Strategies of Fantasy 12–14, in which Attebery argues that “[g]enres may be \napproached as ‘fuzzy sets,’ meaning that they are defined not by boundaries but by a center” \n(12). In his own informal poll of fantasy scholars—which asked respondents to assess various \ntitles on a scale of 1–7, 1 meaning “quintessentially fantasy”—Attebery reports that “Le \nGuin’s Earthsea trilogy scored 1.3,” only referencing one title with a lower score, Tolkien’s \nopus itself at 1.07 (14).\n1  THE BOY WIZARD AND THE YOUNG GRAND MASTER \n",

In the next decade, her \nheterogeneous 1987 collection Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences \nand 1985’s Always Coming Home, the latter a candidate for her magnum \nopus, also echo Indigenous American epistemologies that assume the \nubiquity of nonhuman personhood: “[R]ealistic fiction is drawn towards \nanthropocentrism, fantasy away from it,” she writes (“Critics” 87). But \neven in Wizard, this early novel for young adults, the protagonist Ged \nsimilarly pauses to reflect on the nonhuman world after his animal com­\npanion seems to bring him back from the brink of death with its mere \npresence: “From that time forth he believed that the wise man is one who \nnever sets himself apart from other living things, whether they have speech \nor not, and in later years he strove long to learn what can be learned, in \nsilence, from the eyes of animals, the flight of birds, the great slow gestures \nof trees” (58).6\nWe encounter most of Le Guin’s later themes in at least germinal form \nin A Wizard of Earthsea, despite the many ways in which the novel—and \nto a large extent the entire original trilogy—does remain anchored to a \nnarrower view of fantasy as fundamentally masculinist and feudal in char­\nacter: wizards are men, and in the third book a king must return to right \nthe ship of state. For the most notable exception, then, to the statement \nthat Wizard engages most of Le Guin’s lifelong concerns, we must turn to \ngender identity and gender politics, which only the latter books of Earthsea \nwould center. In the twenty-first century, Wizard can feel limited but \nnever quite hidebound on gender issues; consider the infamous passage \nfrom early in the novel contrasting women’s and men’s magic, which \nleaves some space for ambiguity: “There is a saying on Gont, Weak as \n5 In an afterword to The Other Wind, the final Earthsea book, Le Guin explains that what \nshe was able then to perceive as the central theme of the books collectively had evolved in \nways she could not have fully anticipated in 1968, referring specifically to the “misunder­\nstanding of the uses of power, the desire for control, and the nature of death”: “This was my \ngreat theme” (894).\n6 When Le Guin speaks in Rocannon’s World of “the different shapes minds come in” (30), \nit is clear she has other than human modalities of cognition already in mind.\n \nT.

Le Guin’s narrator does not endorse this view but also fails to refute \nit, and later books investigate the potential gap between such a perception \nof women’s magic and its reality. “How much of that was truth, how \nmuch was fear?,” Ged wonders about the old saying in “Firelight” (971). \nOf the three women characters with any significant role in Wizard, how­\never, two do demonstrate a mean, self-serving kind of magic and attempt \nto use it to ensnare Ged. While the third, his mage friend Vetch’s younger \nsister Yarrow, remains a much more positive character, she nevertheless \nbecomes emblematic of conventional domesticity and a particular limited \nsphere appropriate for women; Chap. 5 will examine these characters \nmuch more closely and gesture to Le Guin’s reconsideration of gender in \nand with Earthsea in the later books. But, in his 1985 NovaCon talk, \nTerry Pratchett was certainly correct to include Le Guin—“Can you imag­\nine a girl trying to get a place at the University of Gont?”—in his critique \nof the gendered way he perceived magic to be represented in genre fan­\ntasy: “[M]agic done by women is usually of poor quality, third-­rate, nega­\ntive stuff, while the wizards are usually cerebral, clever, powerful, and \nwise” (“Why Gandalf Never Married”). Le Guin herself became only too \naware of how she had unconsciously cleaved to a history of anti-­feminist \nrepresentations of women using magic, in later works choosing not to \nannihilate distinctions between gendered kinds of magic in Earthsea, but \ndramatically reframing those distinctions and their significance. In \n“Firelight,” Ged reflects on his aunt—in Wizard cast as a selfish, ignorant, \nand cowardly witch—in a way that insists on the centrality of women to \nGed, to Earthsea, and to fantasy: “But after all, it was a woman who first \ntaught me, too, he thought, and the thought had a little gleam of revela­\ntion in it” (971).

Long before the novel that would become Malafrena \nmade it to print, 1966 saw the publication of her science fantasy Rocannon’s \nWorld, an Ace double stitched in the tête-bêche format to Avram \nDavidson’s The Kar-Chee Reign, and the first novel-length work in her \ncelebrated Hainish Cycle. A Wizard of Earthsea departed from the early \nHainish novels in its more committed high fantasy setting, but did have \nsome precedent in Le Guin’s work in that it followed on two fantasy short \nstories very different in tone but belonging in an embryonic way to the \nsame setting, “The Word of Unbinding” and “The Rule of Names” \n(1964). Despite those initial “literary” aspirations, and unlike some writ­\ners who sought to escape from the potentially limiting label of genre fic­\ntion, Le Guin fiercely defended fantasy and science fiction against aesthetic \nsnobbery while simultaneously earning early recognition herself within \nthat so-called literary mainstream. She eventually received the high literary \nimprimatur of several Library of America editions of her works, but also \npublished poetry throughout her career in prestigious literary magazines \nsuch as The Kenyon Review (including six poems in the Autumn 1979 \nissue such as “Wordhoard,” and in the Spring 1987 issue the poem “In \nthat Ohio”), and multiple short stories in The New Yorker (the first being \nher 1979 story “Two Delays on the Northern Line”). We can contrast Le \nGuin’s embrace of a pluralistic identity as a genre writer and more with the \nperspective of an author such as Kurt Vonnegut, known for dismay at the \nlabeling of his first novel Player Piano as science fiction and its conse­\nquences for his early career: “I have been a soreheaded occupant of a file \ndrawer labeled ‘science fiction’ ever since, and I would like out, particu­\nlarly since so many serious critics regularly mistake the drawer for a urinal” \n(1). Le Guin was far more interested in what these drawers designated \n“science fiction” or “fantasy” could accomplish rather than trying to \nescape them.7\n7 By the late 1970s Le Guin had published a string of book-length works of realism—\nOrsinian Tales, Malafrena, the short YA novel Very Far Away from Anywhere Else (1976)—\nsuch that in 1980 John Updike praised her new reputation in the literary mainstream, writing \nin his New Yorker review of her 1980 metafantasy The Beginning Place that “only recently has \nher reputation, passing through the same cultural space-warp utilized by Ray Bradbury and \nKurt Vonnegut, entered what is hailed from the other side as ‘mainstream fiction’” (283). \nThis turn to realism, if it can be called a turn, was obviously short-lived. As we might expect, \nUpdike praises Le Guin at the expense of other genre writers and indeed genre fiction itself, \nhighlighting the “mainstream tact, color, and intelligence” of her earlier speculative fic­\ntion (283).\n \nT.

In an America where our reality may \nseem degraded to posturing patriotism and self-righteous brutality, imagina­\ntive literature continues to question what heroism is, to examine the roots \nof power, and to offer moral alternatives. Imagination is the instrument of \nethics. There are many metaphors beside battle, many choices besides war, \nand most ways of doing good do not, in fact, involve killing anybody. \nFantasy is good at thinking about those other ways.

Le Guin’s \nnovel was thus invited by Herman Schein of Berkeley’s Parnassus Press at \na time when both genre fantasy and YA fiction were relatively new, “the \nnext big thing” a small press might gamble on: “He wanted to begin \ndoing novels for older kids. When I said, ‘Oh no!’ he just said, ‘Well, think \nabout it. Fantasy, maybe—whatever you like’” (“Afterword” 127). Le \nGuin did deliver a made-to-­order fantasy aimed at young adults, but also \na first step towards much more.\nAlthough it remains a groundbreaking work of early fantasy fiction, A \nWizard of Earthsea did not of course emerge from nor enter into a void. \nOn the contrary, in 1968 dragons and unicorns were in the very air: the \nsame year also saw the original publication of Peter S. Beagle’s classic fan­\ntasy novel The Last Unicorn as well as Anne McCaffrey’s saga-spawning \nscience fantasy Dragonflight, the first entry in the long-running \nDragonriders of Pern series. In the same year, Lloyd Alexander’s The High \nKing provided the conclusion to his Chronicles of Prydain series (aimed \nat a slightly younger age range), and fantastical traditions in other hemi­\nspheres also continued to flourish and develop in new directions, exempli­\nfied by Gabriel García Márquez’s own famous 1968 “Tale for Children,” \nthe emblematic magical realist short story “A Very Old Man with \nEnormous Wings.” The English translation of Italo Calvino’s complete \ncollection of science fables Cosmicomics also appeared in 1968, and the \nBallantine Adult Fantasy line would launch in the following year, with the \nunicorn—already firmly enshrined by Beagle as emblem for fantasy—\nbecoming the original colophon for the series.\n10 The division of the American Library Association now known as the Young Adult \nLibrary Services Association began in 1957, and the decade that followed witnessed an \nincreasing number of books written for teenagers rather than younger children, including \ntouchstone works such as Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time (1962) and S. E.

If, conversely, any of Le Guin’s characters demonstrate a \n“right” to power, they demonstrate it precisely by knowing not to exercise \nit, one of the most difficult lessons for Ged to master despite the excellent \nexample his first mentor Ogion provides. The word “power” and its varia­\ntions appear well over one hundred times in A Wizard of Earthsea, and Le \nGuin’s understanding of power owes much to her own lifelong Daoist \ncommitments, as Chap. 4 will explore at length. As Robert Steed argues, \nmany of Le Guin’s interpretations of Daoist thought find their most obvi­\nous expression in Earthsea, including a complex philosophy of non-action: \n“Several of the masters of Roke as well as a few other characters express \nideas of the kind of (non) action that flows from respecting the \nEquilibrium” (188).\nLe Guin’s interest in Daoism originated in her father’s study of Lao \nTzu, and her parents were both enormously significant writers and intel­\nlectual figures in their own right. Born in 1929 in Berkeley, California to \ncelebrity anthropologists Alfred L. Kroeber and Theodora Kroeber, Le \nGuin was exposed to anthropological modes of thinking and her parents’ \n11 In an article first published in 2003 in The Mail on Sunday, Tolkien’s grandson Simon \nTolkien recalls his grandfather persisting in giving the Latin responses during mass: “I vividly \nremember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and \nit was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My Grandfather \nobviously didn’t agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest \nof the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, \nbut My Grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right” (“My \nGrandfather”).\n12 The scholarly commentary on Tolkien’s Catholicism is extensive, but only recently has \nthe “Jewishness” of Beagle’s The Last Unicorn begun to attract a critical mass of interest. See, \nfor instance, Michael Weingrad’s 2019 essay “The Best Unicorn” and Adam Roberts on \n“Jewish Fantasy.”\n1  THE BOY WIZARD AND THE YOUNG GRAND MASTER \n",

In \n1964 Le Guin’s mother published a book for young people about Ishi \nwith Parnassus Press, the same local Berkeley publisher that would invite \nand inspire Le Guin to write her fantasy novel for teenagers. Not by chance \ndoes Le Guin choose to describe Ged’s ethnicity in ways that might sug­\ngest a physical resemblance with some Native groups, such that Ruth \nRobbins, the original illustrator and cover artist for both Theodora \nKroeber’s Ishi: Last of His Tribe (1964) and the Parnassus edition of \nWizard, depicts Ishi and Ged quite similarly in appearance, as Chap. 3 will \ndiscuss in greater contextual detail.\n­\n­\n­\n13\n13 For contemporary reporting on the renaming, see Gomez, “UC Berkeley removes \nKroeber Hall name,” or the fuller account presented on the university’s website (Kell).

Ishi’s \nhistory informed all of Le Guin’s greatest literary works of the 1960s and 1970s: Planet of \nExile, City of Illusions, The Word for World Is Forest, The Dispossessed, and her masterpiece, The \nLeft Hand of Darkness” (“On the Renaming”). While Scheper-Hughes may overstate the \nspecific connections between Ishi (d. 1916) and Le Guin’s work, the omission of A Wizard \nof Earthsea, published during this same period, seems odd. Scheper-Hughes contributed to \nthe 2021 AAA session as well, individual paper abstracts from which remain available here: \nhttps://easaonline.org/downloads/networks/hoan/HOAN_Newsletter_20f-­202111_\nKroeber_AAA_Session.pdf.\n \nT.

Theodora Kroeber’s first book was \nin fact a set of retold Native stories titled The Inland Whale: Nine Stories Retold from \nCalifornia Indian Legends (1959). On the possible influence of Native ideas on Earthsea’s \nnaming conventions, see Barrow and Barrow, “Voyages,” 22–24, but we should also heed \nthe cautionary note about Le Guin’s engagements with indigeneity in Stone et al., “The \nLanguage of the Dusk.” We can find discomfort about and important critical reflections on \nLe Guin’s engagement with Native cultures in the scholarly tradition dating back to at least \nElyce Rae Helford’s 1997 article “Going ‘Native.’”\n1  THE BOY WIZARD AND THE YOUNG GRAND MASTER \n",

While she had not read \nany Jung at the time of writing Wizard, Le Guin herself would go on to \nexplore Jungian thinking and more general reflections on archetypes and \ncross-cultural narratives as a way of reexamining her own works.18\nAlthough Le Guin did become one of the most prolific critics on her \nown writing, wider academic interest in Earthsea developed early, yielding \nnow more than a half century of scholarship on Wizard, and scholarship \nthat has shifted in direction and emphasis many times over the decades, \njust as surely as Le Guin frequently adjusted her own sails when compos­\ning later works set in the fantasy world. Amy J. Ransom has incomparably \nsummarized the tremendous range of responses that Le Guin’s work has \ngarnered from both general and academic audiences: “Le Guin has been \nlabeled a man-hating feminist and not feminist enough, a utopian thinker \nand an anti-utopian critic, a radical anarchist and a conservative realist” \n(144). The Earthsea books in particular became a kind of testing ground \nfor new developments in literary studies and fantasy studies, as we will see \nmore clearly in Chap. 4. Above all, the multiple generations of readers, \nwriters, and scholars that A Wizard of Earthsea has engaged in so many \nrich and varied ways show why this “old text” nevertheless belongs in a \n“new canon.” It is not only a key novel in the author’s career and the \ngenre in which it participates, but one that at once looks back to Tolkien \nand his own antecedents in masculinist early fantasy; looks forward to Le \nGuin’s own continuing feminist and progressive education; and antici­\npates and indeed helped to shape young adult literature in its contempo­\nrary form.

This chapter will think through such literary \nantecedents for and influences on Wizard as well as the many ways in \nwhich Le Guin diverges from her forebears and strikes out to map new \nterritories of psychological and philosophical complexity in the genre \nusing familiar fantasy and folkloric patterns, emphasizing Le Guin’s ambi­\ntions to use old stories to teach new lessons.\n4\n­\n­\n3 “[T]he tale is not really about Power and Dominion,” writes Tolkien: these glosses \nappear in a 1957 letter first published in 1975 with commentary by Glen GoodKnight (19). \nThe particular thematic conjunction of death and the moral education of a young adult will \nalso recall a line from Tolkien’s “On Fairy-stories”: “[I]t is one of the lessons of fairy-stories \n(if we can speak of the lessons of things that do not lecture) that on callow, lumpish, and \nselfish youth peril, sorrow, and the shadow of death can bestow dignity, and even sometimes \nwisdom” (58).\n4 Garth, a noted Tolkien scholar, argues that the word “tolk” itself occupies an unusually \nprominent place in the Earthsea books, suggesting that the Tolkien/Earthsea conjunction \n“could directly point to Tolkien as a major part of the bedrock of inspiration for Earthsea” \n(“Ursula Le Guin”). In the blog post, Garth also documents many of the places where Le \nGuin praises Tolkien in her nonfiction.\n2  BETWEEN CHILDREN’S LITERATURE AND “ADULT FANTASY”… \n",

So \nKurremkarmerruk had said to them, once, their first night in the Tower; \nhe never repeated it, but Ged did not forget his words. ‘Many a mage of \ngreat power,’ he had said, ‘has spent his whole life to find out the name of \none single thing—one single lost or hidden name” (36).6 Indeed, the nov­\nel’s most Tolkienian narrative episode is likely Ged’s verbal sparring with \nthe Dragon of Pendor, a crafty foe colored with shades of Smaug, though \nnot in the end pierced by an arrow, but rather laid low by linguistic knowl­\nedge. Ged knows the dragon’s true name, even when he cannot yet name \nhis own shadow-self. That latter challenge remains before him: Ged utters \nthe dragon’s name and so nullifies its capacity to do harm at approximately \nthe midpoint of the novel. “You never think of going on past the dragon,” \nmuses a character in Le Guin’s 1980 novel The Beginning Place: “You only \nthink about getting to it. But what happens afterwards?” (191). A Wizard \nof Earthsea and indeed the entire series of novels turns on repetitions of \nthis same narrative structure, the defeat of a “dragon” followed by an \nexploration of what comes after—“[I]t was hard to turn from the bright \ndanger of the dragons to that formless, hopeless horror” (67)—the life \nthat even a dragonlord must continue to lead day in and day out, “the \nkind of victory that isn’t the end of a battle but the beginning of a life” \n(“Afterword” 130).7 In this approach, too, Le Guin may follow Tolkien \n5 Le Guin credits such strategies to Tolkien’s teaching: “I learned the trick of hinting at a \nwhole background with a few names, so you’d feel situated in a real world, not a fantasy \nbubble” (Jaggi).\n6 Williamson likewise describes how “the quasi-historical depth of the canvas, with its allu­\nsions to traditional myths and legends, echoes Tolkien,” but concludes that it is rather “the \nfurther development of a metaphysical structure underscoring magic” that most “moves \nEarthsea into (then) quite original territory” (193). Like Ged working his first great magic, \nthe young Le Guin “had the strength to turn the spell to [her] own ends” (Wizard 13).\n7 The narrator of Le Guin’s realist YA novel Very Far Away from Anywhere Else concludes \nwith just such a gesture towards the ongoing nature of story and life: “There is more, of \ncourse, but that seems to be all of this thing I wanted to tell. The ‘more’ is just what hap­\npened next and keeps on happening—each day’s new gorilla nest” (129).\n \nT. S. MILLER\n",

Near his jour­\nney’s end Ged’s old friend corroborates this view—“Wizards do not meet \nby chance, lad” (108)—but we see Le Guin at her most Arthurian describ­\ning the relationship between chance and design once Ged has arrived at \nthe Court of the Terrenon: “He had come to this tower-keep by chance, \nand yet the chance was all design; or he had come by design and yet all the \ndesign had merely chanced to come about” (79).14 Ged senses that he has \nbeen trapped—“this was no place one came to by chance; even in the dull­\nness of his thoughts he began to see that” (79)—but also that apparent \nchance and some higher fate may be linked on some level below percep­\ntion, and this seventh chapter, “The Hawk’s Flight,” should not be dis­\nmissed as one interchangeable or random episode among many. While it \nmay read like a self-contained interlude, or even a distraction from the \nmain narrative, recalling the unexpected stopover in Beorn’s fairytale \nhomestead in the seventh chapter of The Hobbit, Ged’s own time spent in \n“queer lodgings” proves pivotal. Ged’s resistance of the multiple tempta­\ntions in the tower results in a reorientation of his life and a reunion with \nOgion, pointing him towards instead of away from his shadow. After all, \nLe Guin chooses to highlight the image of “the hawk’s flight” in the nov­\nel’s enigmatic in-universe epigraph from The Creation of Éa (5).15 Ged’s \nliteral flight from the Court of the Terrenon in a raptor’s shape has clearly \nbeen preordained and foreshadowed to be suffused with meaning; Vetch \neven sings the creation song and repeats the phrase about the hawk’s flight \nafter Ged’s climactic reintegration of his shadow, bracketing the entire \nnarrative with this image (125).\nLe Guin thus allows a carefully ordered “chance” to arrange and lend \nmeaning to Ged’s adventures, and, while our hero does not belong to any \nnoble knightly lineage, we learn early in the novel that this blacksmith’s \nson is cut from archetypal fairytale cloth nevertheless, a seventh son whose \n14 Timothy Newman’s master’s thesis traces various “Arthurian Quest Motifs” across Le \nGuin’s fiction, and for example observes the parallel in the narrative situations of Sir Gawain \nand the Green Knight and the episode at the Court of the Terrenon (62).\n15 The excerpt reads, “Only in silence the word, / only in dark the light, / only in dying \nlife: / bright the hawk’s flight / on the empty sky” (5). In her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, \nDiana Wynne Jones would skewer the trend in genre fantasy that Le Guin again herself \nhelped establish with this epigraph, noting that the obligatory fantasy map “will be followed \nby a short piece of prose that says When the night of the wolf waxes strong in the morning, the \nwise man is wary of a false dawn. Ka’a Orto’o, Gnomic Utterances, VI ii” (“How to Use \nThis Book”).\n2  BETWEEN CHILDREN’S LITERATURE AND “ADULT FANTASY”… \n",

The version of “The Master \nand His Pupil” included in the nineteenth-century collection of English \nFairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs provides a representative example of this \nimportant pre-text, and resonates with Le Guin’s framework in many \nways, beginning as follows:\nThere was once a very learned man in the north-country who knew all the \nlanguages under the sun, and who was acquainted with all the mysteries of \ncreation. He had one big book bound in black calf and clasped with iron, \nand with iron corners, and chained to a table which was made fast to the \nfloor; and when he read out of this book, he unlocked it with an iron key, \nand none but he read from it, for it contained all the secrets of the spiritual \nworld. It told how many angels there were in heaven, and how they marched \nin their ranks, and sang in their quires, and what were their several functions, \nand what was the name of each great angel of might. And it told of the \ndemons, how many of them there were, and what were their several powers, \nand their labours, and their names, and how they might be summoned, and \nhow tasks might be imposed on them, and how they might be chained to be \nas slaves to man. (73–74)\nJust such a book of lore containing true names that promise to grant a \nstudent mastery over arcane powers tempts Ged one fateful day in Ogion’s \ncottage: “Now the master had a pupil who was but a foolish lad, and he \nacted as servant to the great master, but never was he suffered to look into \nthe black book, hardly to enter the private room. One day the master was \nout, and then the lad, as curious as could be, hurried to the chamber…” \n(74). The illustration by John D. Batten in the Jacobs edition depicts the \nboy cowering in front of a grimoire open to Latin incantations with a \nnonsense language on the facing page—“Kimo Kari Kimo”—and closely \nanticipates Le Guin’s staging of the same scene by rendering the demon \nthat the pupil summons as a complete blackness, like a shadow (73). \nOgion returns to banish this intimation of the shadow that will later pur­\nsue Ged—“a shapeless clot of shadow darker than the darkness” (21)—\nbefore it can cause harm, just as the master saves the pupil from the \ndemon’s enthusiasm for the task it has been set: “But the master remem­\nbered on his journey that he had not locked his book, and therefore \n \nT.

Lewis and Le Guin seem \nto apprehend the appeal of the school story for young people but also its \ninherent limitations, and Ged’s own educational progress in Wizard in fact \ncomes to depend on his recognition that leaving Ogion’s tutelage for the \nSchool on Roke represented a mistake: “I have walked with great wizards \nand lived on the Isle of the Wise, but you are my true master, Ogion” \n(90). At the same time, Le Guin implies that leaving Ogion only to return \nand acknowledge him as true teacher was a necessary part of Ged’s educa­\ntion, one return journey among many in Wizard and in her fiction that has \nresulted in the beginnings of a hard-earned Socratic wisdom for her hero: \n“I have come back to you as I left: a fool” (88).

In his mind all the Masters of Roke gathered, Gensher the Archmage frowning in their \nmidst, and Nemmerle was with them, and Ogion, and even the witch who had taught him \nhis first spell; all of them gazed at him and he knew he had failed their trust in him” (79).\n \nT.

The laughter and delight of the child \nreflect a child’s innocence, but the scene also warns of the temptation and \ndanger inherent in such power and domination over nature. When Duny/\nGed remains a child, the capacity of this perspective to do harm likewise \nremains limited: “At first all his pleasure in the art-magic was, childlike, \nthe power it gave him over bird and beast” (11).19 But this “childlike” \nview persists into young adulthood, souring Ged’s early days with Ogion, \nand evolving finally into the dangerous state of mind that leads him to \nloose the shadow on Roke Knoll: “The more he learned, the less he would \nhave to fear, until finally in his full power as Wizard he needed fear nothing \nin the world, nothing at all” (41). There is no question that such a per­\nspective would be incompatible with Ogion’s contemplative approach, \nand the friction between student and teacher arises almost immediately:\nThough a very silent man he was so mild and calm that Ged soon lost his \nawe of him, and in a day or two more he was bold enough to ask his master, \n“When will my apprenticeship begin, Sir?”\n“It has begun,” said Ogion.\nThere was a silence, as if Ged was keeping back something he had to say. \nThen he said it: “But I haven’t learned anything yet!”\n“Because you haven’t found out what I am teaching,” replied the \nmage. (17)\nOgion undoubtedly asks much from his young student, but seems con­\ncerned to reorient Ged’s entire way of thinking, and to allow Ged to \nachieve such a reorientation through long experience himself. For exam­\nple, when Ogion teaches Ged the name of the plant fourfoil, the stu­\ndent—expecting “useful lore” of the kind his aunt had described as key to \ngaining “great power over men” (11)—can only respond, “What is its use, \nMaster?” (18).

Neither the majority of the novel’s early book covers nor \nthe screen adaptations to date translated the racial diversity of Earthsea \nvisually, including the TV miniseries The Legend of Earthsea (2004) and \nStudio Ghibli’s animated Tales from Earthsea (2006). Beyond document­\ning such whitewashing and Le Guin’s frustrations with it, the chapter fur­\nther argues that Le Guin’s attention to racial issues and whiteness attempts \nmore broadly to overturn the typical associations in the fantasy genre of \nwhiteness with goodness and dark imagery with evil.\nKeywords  Race • Whitewashing • Whiteness • Adaptation • The \nLegend of Earthsea • Tales from Earthsea\nA Wizard of Earthsea in Black and White: \nUncoupling Whiteness and Goodness\n© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature \nSwitzerland AG 2023\nT.

Yet the novel does demonstrate a perhaps surpris­\ningly sophisticated effort to separate such language from the racial coding \nit so often travels with. Above all, the secondary world Le Guin has fash­\nioned for Wizard decenters whiteness, and quite literally so: unlike \nTolkien’s white-towered city of Minas Tirith in Gondor, “the white towers \nof Havnor Great Port at the center of the world” are not filled with white \npeople (24). Instead, Le Guin places the habitations of lighter-skinned \npeoples such as Osskil and the Kargad Lands on the margins of her world, \nwith her ethnically diverse archipelago in its center both narratively and \ntopographically. This move stands in direct contrast with the usual habits \nof fantastic cartographers, notorious for locating nonwhite peoples on the \nhazy margins of their worlds, as with Tolkien’s swarthy corrupt Easterlings \nand Southrons and infamous “black men like half-trolls” from “Far \nHarad” (Return of the King 121).2 The default racial coding of evil across \nfantasy worlds has consequences: as Maria Sachiko Cecire has put it, “the \nracial politics of magical landscapes have real-world impact” (26), as fur­\nther documented in Ebony Elizabeth Thomas’s monograph on “the \ndiversity crisis in young adult literature, media, and fan cultures,” The \n1 Young acknowledges Le Guin’s efforts in 1968 to challenge the racial dynamics of the \nrapidly expanding genre of fantasy literature, but goes on to explore how “the genrefication \nof Fantasy from the late 1970s to the present ingrained” audience expectations for white \nheroics and dark villainy (40), a few important early “[c]ounter-voices” such as Charles \nR. Saunders and Samuel R. Delany notwithstanding (45). Compare also Farah Mendlesohn’s \npoint, in a discussion of fantasy quest narratives more broadly, that “the ‘racing’ of heroes \nand villains is in part a consequence of a rhetoric that posits insight in terms of visual percep­\ntion” (12).\n2 Maria Sachiko Cecire makes much of Junot Díaz’s reference to this passage in his novel \nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. During the title character’s depressed adulthood, this \nAfro-Caribbean immigrant fantasy fan who aspires to become “the Dominican Tolkien” \nnevertheless finds himself unable to continue rereading his favorite book when he reaches \nthis line, having encountered, in Cecire’s words, “his own racial identity figured as monstros­\nity in his most beloved text” (220).\n \nT.

Those letters have been a tre­\nmendous reward and true joy to me. (“A Whitewashed Earthsea”)\nBlack sf/f fan Pam Noles has written just such a reflection on Earthsea’s \nplace in her life: “Le Guin’s racial choices in ‘A Wizard of Earthsea’ mat­\ntered because her decision said to the wide white world: You Are Not The \nWhole Of The Universe. For many fans of genre, no matter where they fell \non the spectrum of pale, this was the first time such a truth was made alive \nfor them within the pages of the magical worlds they loved” (“Shame”). \nThis decentering of whiteness, although achieved mainly through the pre­\ncision of the novel’s language, remains at the heart of Earthsea‘s world­\nbuilding project.\nLe Guin’s comments on the worldbuilding behind A Wizard of the \nEarthsea repeatedly affirm her desire to upend fantasy’s conventional \nracialization of evil as darker-skinned, for example in her 2012 afterword \nto the novel positioning her own approach against early genre fantasy’s \nraced hierarchies: “[T]he hero was a white man; most dark-skinned people \nwere inferior or evil. If there was a woman in the story, she was a passive \nobject of desire and rescue (a beautiful blond princess); active women \n(dark, witches) usually caused destruction or tragedy” (128). Le Guin \ngoes on to describe her “subversive” challenge to this precedent as “delib­\nerately sneaky”: “A great many white readers in 1967 were not ready to \naccept a brown-skinned hero. But they weren’t expecting one. I didn’t \nmake an issue of it, and you have to be well into the book before you real­\nize that Ged, like most of the characters, isn’t white. […] I was bucking \nthe racist tradition, ‘making a statement’—but I made it quietly, and it \nwent almost unnoticed” (129). The thoroughly whitewashed history of \n3 Thomas also sounds a note of optimism: “Working toward a fantastic that is restorative, \ntransformative, and emancipatory has the power to remake our world” (13).\n3  FANTASY AND THE WEIGHT OF WHITENESS: RACIAL DYNAMICS… \n",

The negating word “not” even \nappears here in the revelation of Ged’s skin color, rendering it about as \ncircumspect as one could imagine while simultaneously remaining quite \nplain and unambiguous about the matter: Ged is not white. This scrupu­\nlously constructed, slow-to-arrive, yet also casual description of Ged’s \ndeviation from whiteness serves precisely to decenter whiteness as a norm \nfrom which his own identity should be read as a deviation.\nDespite the scarcity of references to characters’ skin color and other \nracial dynamics, what few mentions of whiteness and other racial markers \nwe find in the novel engage several key issues with subtlety and complex­\nity, collectively working to break down the pernicious alignment of white­\nness with both inherently superior beauty and moral goodness. For one, \ndispensing with the “beautiful blond princess” and the colorist hierarchy \nof beauty standards it implies, Le Guin instead celebrates the beauty of the \ncommon Archipelagan skin color when she relates the visit to Roke made \nby the Lord of O and his lady, described as “slender and young, bright as \nnew copper, her black hair crowned with opals” (38). Conversely, while \nlearning from Ogion as a youth on Gont, Ged first encounters Serret, the \nlight-skinned daughter of the Lord of Re Albi and an enchantress from a \ndistant land, in a scene that does not associate the girl’s whiteness with \nbeauty. In fact, her skin’s unusual coloration seems to repel Ged, remind­\ning him perhaps of the Kargish warriors who wrought such destruction: \n“She was a tall girl of about his own age, very sallow, almost white-skinned; \nher mother, they said in the village, was from Osskil or some such foreign \nland. Her hair fell long and straight like a fall of black water. Ged thought \nher very ugly” (19). Again Le Guin deliberately overturns a reader’s \nexpectations with her carefully constructed syntax: this description of \nstraight hair falling like black water, as if beginning a courtly blason describ­\ning a beautiful woman in a medieval romance, is immediately undercut by \nthe simple, straightforward declaration of her ugliness to Ged, affirming \nthat the adjective “sallow” is doing a great deal of work here, suggesting a \nsickly appearance to him. Ged’s perception of her lighter skin as unhealth­\nily “sallow” and unattractive contravenes many a scene in fantasy and else­\nwhere in which the inherently superior beauty of whiteness stuns and \nentrances nonwhite characters unused to it. Ged simply finds light skin \nunfamiliar, even uncomfortable.\nThroughout the novel, we see that white skin color is consistently asso­\nciated with a lack of health, a deviation from the normal condition of the \nhuman body. For instance, the whiteness associated with the Archmage \n3  FANTASY AND THE WEIGHT OF WHITENESS: RACIAL DYNAMICS… \n",

As the \nArchmage lies on his deathbed, Le Guin invokes the disturbing whiteness \nof both old age and the skeleton—“He lay still, hawk nose and high fore­\nhead and white hair bleached by moonlight all to the color of bone” \n(47)—and she likewise describes the aged, white-skinned ruler of the \nCourt of the Terrenon, Lord Benderesk, as “bone-white, bone-thin, with \nclouded eyes” (78). Even Ged’s facial scars are not described as the dark \nscar tissue we might find adorning any number of sword-and-sorcery \nheroes, but white against his coppery skin (48). Such sustained associa­\ntions that Le Guin builds between whiteness and mortality counteract \ndominant cultural narratives associating whiteness with superior fitness \nand attractiveness: the novel’s commentary on race thus extends beyond \nmerely “casting” a nonwhite character as its hero.\nThe light-skinned daughter of the Lord of Re Albi returns later in the \nnovel at the Court of the Terrenon in scenes that deepen Le Guin’s \nengagement with the power of whiteness as a construct. As an adult, Ged \nencounters a woman identified as Serret, and only later revealed to have \nbeen the same girl from Gont who tempted him to imperil his life with \ndangerous magic: “She was young and tall, dressed in white and silver, \nwith a net of silver crowning her hair that fell straight down like a fall of \nblack water” (77). Arrayed here in this way and with a name meaning \n“silver” signaling her lightness and brightness, Serret arguably deploys a \nkind of “white magic” against Ged, a false innocence, a feigned fragility. \nAnd, not recognizing her as the sallow-skinned girl from the meadows, \nGed does find this woman beautiful: “He had never seen a beautiful \nwoman dressed to match her beauty but once in his life: that Lady of O \nwho had come with her Lord to the Sunreturn festival at Roke. She had \nbeen like a slight, bright candle-flame, but this woman was like the white \nnew moon” (78). Here Ged does seem to make a potentially colorist com­\nparison between the “impure” and thus less attractive reddish or yellowish \nbeauty of the flame, and the superior because purer white beauty of the \nmoon. One wonders if Ged has not so much as internalized some form of \ncolorism in the years since, but rather fallen under a sort of spell woven by \nthis sorceress that mirrors it.\n \nT. S. MILLER\n",

Scheming to enslave him to her \npower, it is this white woman who twice proves Ged’s betrayer, but Ged \nat first misunderstands her narrative role as that of a damsel in distress, a \npassive innocent trapped by her husband, and perhaps in no small part \nbecause of her bewitching and bewildering whiteness:\nThe old lord kept mostly in his own apartments, coming forth mornings to \npace up and down the snowy inner courtyards of the castle-keep like an old \nsorcerer who has been brewing spells all night. When he joined Ged and \nSerret for supper he sat silent, looking up at his young wife sometimes with \na hard, covetous glance. Then Ged pitied her. She was like a white deer \ncaged, like a white bird wing-clipped, like a silver ring on an old man’s fin­\nger. She was an item of Benderesk’s hoard. (80)\nLe Guin frames the social construct of whiteness as itself bewitching and \npowerful in its symbolic associations, not coincidentally emphasizing \nthe exalting power of the woman’s whiteness here when Ged thinks of \nher as a white deer or white bird, their color betokening purity and \ninnocence, even victimization. When Ged is thinking more clearly, free \nof Serret’s enchantments, white becomes just a color to him once again: \nher servants remain “pale, dour Osskilians” (78), and the structure of \nthe tower itself looms “like a sharp tooth from its hilltop” (78), the \nsame “scratch against the sky, like a tooth, white” he had originally \nglimpsed on his way towards the Court of the Terrenon (74). With a \nclearer understanding, Ged had perceived a toothed threat to lurk \nwithin the dazzlement of whiteness, soon deployed as a weapon of \nbewilderment against him.\n3  FANTASY AND THE WEIGHT OF WHITENESS: RACIAL DYNAMICS… \n",

So too, then, can the Court of the Terrenon \nbe a white building, toothlike, and Ged’s shadow can wear a white face. \nWhen Ged must offer his services as an oarsman on the ship that will take \nhim to the Court of the Terrenon, the narrative voice again seems to frame \nthe pale skin of his fellow crewmembers as discomfiting to Ged: “They \nwere mostly men from Osskil, speaking not the Hardic tongue of the \nArchipelago but a dialect of their own, and they were dour men, pale-­\nskinned with black drooping mustaches and lank hair. Kelub, the red one, \nwas Ged’s name among them” (72–73). One of these men, Skiorh, will be \npossessed by the power of the shadow and turned into a gebbeth, an \nempty shell. Initially the man has what seems to Ged “an ugly face, pale, \ncoarse, and cruel” (74), but that white face is soon to be replaced by a \nhaunting void beneath his hood when the gebbeth, now so pale that it is \nliterally faceless, turns to name Ged (75). Whiteness is revealed finally as a \ncipher, and as likely—or perhaps more likely—to use the power granted to \nit in order to conceal evil and work harm.\nIllustration, Adaptation, and the Racial Politics \nof the Visual Imagination\nA celebrated literary work with such a long printing history and such a \nwide audience as A Wizard of Earthsea will usually be able to boast a num­\nber of different officially authorized visualizations of its world and charac­\nters, whether in cover illustrations, other assorted pieces of interior \nartwork, or in some cases film, television, game, or graphic novel adapta­\ntions. To date, material from the novel has been used in two loose and \ncombinatorial screen adaptations, the 2006 Studio Ghibli animated film \nTales from Earthsea, and the 2004 television miniseries originally titled The \n5 Michael Warren Tumolo and Jennifer Beidendorf specifically connect Le Guin’s atypical \ndeployment of broader archetypal light and dark imagery to her “subversive presentation of \nrace”: “[She] does not simply render light as positive and darkness as negative. Rather, Ged, \nas indicative of a whole person, is both light and dark, both literally and figuratively. Most \nprominently, the good-evil version of light-dark involves an internal reconciliation that \nacknowledges how these are two facets of the same individual’s experience in the world” \n(145). While light very frequently continues to carry positive associations in the novel, see \nfor instance the “terrible light” and “intolerable brightness” associated with the traumatic \nloosing of the shadow (46).\n \nT.

To \nthis end, the narrator stresses that, in this particular moment, Gensher \nhappens to be both “black” and “black,” as it were, “black-skinned” but \nalso possessing a temporarily “black” “look” that here refers to the dark, \ngrim, troubled feelings of Gensher when confronting Ged for the first \ntime, unsure about the nature of the shadow that will pursue the young \nman for the rest of his life. The adaptation seems uninterested in any such \nsophisticated distinctions, and indeed Le Guin singles out for critique \nDanny Glover’s casting as a shield against criticism, describing it as an \ninsidious practice for which filmmakers should be taken to task: “A col­\nored actor or two makes the casting ‘colorblind’ so that everybody else in \nthe cast can be white” (“Frankenstein’s Earthsea”). Pam Noles is similarly \nscathing—“Yes, they knew enough about the rules to keep at least one \nMagical Negro around to help the newly blond haired, blue eyed surfer \nGed through his Journey Of Transformation To Save The World, because \nlord knows white boys can’t do something like that on their own” \n11 Kristin Kreuk, an actress with some East Asian ancestry, plays the role of Tenar from The \nTombs of Atuan, in the novel a white-skinned woman from the Kargad Lands: arguably \nKreuk’s casting thus additionally causes the adaptation to fall into another all-too-familiar \npattern with fantasy narratives dominated by whiteness, furnishing an exoticized female love \ninterest for a white male lead, often but not always as a part of a so-called white savior narra­\ntive. Ironically enough, the work of Le Guin that most explicitly critiques the white savior \nnarrative, The Word for World Is Forest (1972), became (if unofficially) transmuted into James \nCameron’s film Avatar (2009), an obvious example of such.\n12 Le Guin plainly refers to Vetch’s blackness in a later essay about the adaptation: “Ged is \nan Archipelagan, a redbrown man. Vetch, an Archipelagan, is black” (“Frankenstein’s \nEarthsea”).\n3  FANTASY AND THE WEIGHT OF WHITENESS: RACIAL DYNAMICS… \n",

One \ncould, however, imagine alternative ways of reproducing some of the same \neffect, at least initially, such as, for example, beginning the series in the \nKargad Lands, where white actors would play all roles, only to shift the \naction to Ged and the Archipelago, where the audience would come to \nunderstand the protagonist is in fact nonwhite, along with everyone else \nin the cultural “center of the world.” Le Guin’s novel, of course, thema­\ntizes sight and looking, with Ged’s close association with farseeing birds of \nprey and his hawkeyed powers of perception—spotting Roke in a storm \nbefore any of the mariners on the ship that first carries him there (25–26)—\nas well as his trusty boat Lookfar, with eyes painted on the prow (104). In \nother words, the creators of the miniseries could have pondered imagina­\ntive attempts to use the camera to play with “looking” and even attempt \nto capture Le Guin’s slow reveal on racial issues, but they seemed uninter­\nested in finding ways to translate the novel to screen in any such complex \nfashion. Instead, the screenwriters and director were very free with Le \nGuin’s mythology for reasons of their own in creating what she dismissed \nbitingly as “a generic McMagic movie with a meaningless plot based on \nsex and violence” (“A Whitewashed Earthsea”), as viewers will begin to \ndivine even from the opening voiceover narration, which radically remixes \nelements from the first two books with gestures to ancient prophecies and \nbrooding evils imported from some other generic fantasy storyline. For \nTumolo and Beidendorf—who, like Noles and Le Guin, interpret the \nostensibly “colorblind” casting as a profit-driven decision attempting to \ncapitalize on and reinforce expectations of whiteness—the consequences \nare particularly damaging in denying representation to viewers of color, \nsidestepping one of the most groundbreaking aspects of the original novel, \n“representing all of the main characters as nonwhite”:\nWhat makes this a particularly notable feature is that Le Guin did so in an \nunobtrusive way that offered multiracial readers new points of identification \n \nT.

One strand of the literary \ncriticism on Earthsea stresses the Daoist themes of the novels, pointing for \ninstance to a philosophy of Daoist inaction emergent in Ged’s journey.1 \nOther readers, beginning very shortly after the first novel appeared, have \nidentified archetypal figures and other concepts that resonate with Jungian \napproaches to myth, narrative, and the mind, including Le Guin herself, \nwho read Carl Jung only after writing Wizard but found many of his ideas \ncreatively generative and intentionally drew on them in later fictions.2 \nFeminist and children’s/young adult literature scholars have also naturally \nbrought these perspectives to bear on Wizard as well, and the central place \nin the incipient canon of fantasy that the first trilogy has occupied for \ndecades has also meant that Le Guin’s work has often played a prominent \nrole in more general theories of fantasy. For instance, she has always been \n1 For a far from exhaustive selection, see Wytenbroek, “Taoism in the Fantasies of Ursula \nK. Le Guin” (“Le Guin writes from within a Taoist consciousness, rather than simply apply­\ning an external knowledge of a religion to her writings,” 173); Galbreath, “Taoist Magic” \n(“Ged’s magery is the opposite of coercive, Faustian magic which, defying all limits, strives \nfor domination over nature; it is, in effect, an antimagic or ‘Taoist’ magic,” 262); Lindow, \nDancing the Tao (“Le Guin traces a path to moral maturity that parallels the Tao and the \nwork of feminist thinkers,” 4); and Friedrichsen, “Aspects of Worldbuilding” (“Taoism rests \nat the very center of Earthsea and is the foundation on which Le Guin’s worldbuilding is \nformed,” 11); and many other examples ranging farther afield from Wizard. After her death \nLe Guin was also the subject of a tribute in the Journal of Daoist Studies by Mark Saltveit, \nwhich usefully contextualizes her interests in the area from the perspective of that field rather \nthan fantasy studies.\n2 For a few representative examples, see Bailey, “Shadows in Earthsea” (“Jung stressed the \nimportance of each person recognizing and accepting his own shadow,” and “it is quite clear \nthat Le Guin intended the first volume of her own trilogy, A Wizard of Earthsea, as a por­\ntrayal of the same hazardous but necessary journey to maturity,” 256); Jenkins, “Growing \nUp in Earthsea” (“The Earthsea Trilogy in particular embodies her peculiar vision or aware­\nness of the processes of human maturation” derived from Daoism and “the Jungian concept \nof universal archetypes,” 21); and Barrow and Barrow, “Le Guin’s Earthsea: Voyages in \nConsciousness” (Ogion is “a mage reminiscent of Jung’s ‘old wise man’ and [Northrop] \nFrye’s ‘teacher,’” 26). Le Guin’s 1980 novel The Beginning Place shows the greatest debt to \nJung, and Susan McLean contends that “[t]he influence of Jung is so pervasive that several \nelements of the story can be explained only by reference to Jungian concepts” such as the \nanimus/-a and many more (133).\n \nT.

Wizard plainly \nconcerns itself with morality and ethics, but not in any binary way. The \nprevious chapter discussed how Le Guin sought to work against high fan­\ntasy’s habitual mapping of good and evil onto European-coded, light-­\nskinned heroes and foreign, dark-skinned others, but she had more \nambitious designs still to disrupt any simplistic hero-and-villain binary:\nIn many fantasy tales of the 19th and 20th centuries the tension between \ngood and evil, light and dark, is drawn absolutely clearly, as a battle, the \ngood guys on one side and the bad guys on the other, cops and robbers, \nChristians and heathens, heroes and villains.

By contrast, Le Guin’s absence from Farah Mendlesohn’s landmark 2008 \nmonograph Rhetorics of Fantasy is striking, and perhaps betrays its slight Anglocentric bent.\n4 Even before he published another monograph about fantasy titled Stories About Stories, \nAttebery praised fantasy for this very capacity to teach readers how to read fantasy, “the pos­\nsibility of generating not merely a meaning but an awareness of and a pattern for meaningful­\nness,” merely one of the many homologies between his conception of fantasy and Le Guin’s \nown (Strategies 17).\n4  LIGHT AND SHADOW, GOOD AND EVIL: ETHICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL… \n",

Le Guin speaks of the disastrous \nconsequences attendant upon a failure to admit the inadmissible: “The \nperson who denies his own profound relationship with evil denies his own \nreality”; “Unadmitted to consciousness, the shadow is projected outward, \nonto others. There’s nothing wrong with me—it’s them. I’m not a mon­\nster, other people are monsters. All foreigners are evil” (143). Adopting \nsuch a view, Ged’s projection of his “shadow” onto his school rival Jasper \nbefore it has been literally unleashed and embodied becomes one of the \nsubtler details of the characterization in Wizard: how different is this \nrivalry from those at Hogwarts, in which identification with the injured \nparty remains straightforward.10 Plagued by anxieties about his humble \nbackground and his own arrogance, Ged judges Jasper “scoffing” (30) \nand “disdainful” (31), unable to understand his own part in their escalat­\ning conflict of personalities, and never recognizing for instance that Jasper \ndoes him a great kindness in introducing him to Vetch, who is after all one \nof Jasper’s own close friends despite Vetch’s lack of refinement: “He was \nplain, and his manners were not polished” (31).\nPerhaps we do not need Jung as such to read the relationship between \nGed’s interpersonal drama and his developing psychodrama in this fash­\nion, but several Le Guin scholars have found specific Jungian concepts \nuseful for elucidating other aspects of the narrative. John Izod’s mono­\ngraph on The Films of Nicolas Roeg contains a comprehensive glossary of \n9 Le Guin explains how she came to Jung in an interview: “My father was a Freudian—he \nwas a lay analyst—so the word Jung was a four-letter word in our household. After the \nEarthsea trilogy was published, people kept telling me, ‘Oh, this is wonderful, you’ve used \nJung’s shadow.’ And I’d say, ‘It’s not Jung’s shadow, it’s my shadow.’ But I realized I had to \nread him, and then I got fascinated. Then he was extremely helpful to me as a shaman or \nguide at a rather difficult point in my life. At the moment I wouldn’t want to read Jung; you \nhave to need him, like most psychologists. But it was amazing to me to find how parallel in \ncertain places his imagination and my imagination, or his observation and my imagination, \nhad run” (Conversations 14).\n10 For a discussion of Ged’s projection onto Jasper in the fully Jungian sense, see Bailey 258.\n4  LIGHT AND SHADOW, GOOD AND EVIL: ETHICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL… \n",

Often appears as a dark figure” (257); \n“Individuation: The process of discovery by which the individual \napproaches knowledge of the self. It entails not only an enhancement of \nconsciousness but also the more complete fulfilment of the collective qual­\nities of the human being” (255). Le Guin’s “The Child and the Shadow” \nappears to agree that Wizard can productively be read as dramatizing such \na process of individuation through recognition of the shadow-self. From \nsuch a perspective, Ged’s success at the conclusion of the novel does not \nconsist in beating or destroying his shadow, but recognizing it not as \nenemy but guide on “the journey to self-knowledge, to adulthood” (“The \nChild and the Shadow” 144), in Jungian terms achieving greater “integra­\ntion”: “Either the recognition, or the process of bringing about the inter­\naction of conscious and unconscious” (Izod 255). Here we see Le Guin \ndrawing on Jungian concepts to which she has newly been exposed in \norder to reframe ideas already present in her fiction: “And he [Vetch] \nbegan to see the truth, that Ged had neither lost nor won but, naming the \nshadow of his death with his own name, had made himself whole: a man: \nwho, knowing his whole true self, cannot be used or possessed by any \npower other than himself, and whose life therefore is lived for life’s sake \nand never in the service of ruin, or pain, or hatred, or the dark” (Wizard \n125). This passage about gaining a freedom from possession by other \npowers—in conjunction with the concept of the gebbeth as a human phys­\nically taken over by another power such as the shadow, and the implied \nfate of Ged were he to surrender to the temptation to power offered by \nthe Stone of the Terrenon and after live in servitude to evil, “a slave of the \nStone” (83)—shows Le Guin literalizing a well-known line from Percy \nShelley’s Prometheus Unbound: “All spirits are enslaved which serve things \nevil” (II.4.110). Le Guin in fact concludes the essay with another line \nfrom Shelley on imagination as the “great instrument of moral good,” and \nit is clear that what her own “moral” fictions rely on is a general under­\nstanding of fantasy as “the language of the inner self” more than any spe­\ncific school of thought: “fantasy is the natural, the appropriate, language \nfor the recounting of the spiritual journey and the struggle of good and \nevil in the soul” (“The Child and the Shadow” 148, 147).\n \nT.

Through a brief consideration of how Le Guin radically rei­\nmagines gender in the world of Earthsea decades later in her subsequent \nnovels that return to the setting, the chapter shows how Le Guin sought \nto redress what she perceived as the patriarchal foundations of her other­\nwise progressive fantasy, not by retracting the original novel, but reinter­\npreting it.\nKeywords  Gender • Feminism • Feminist theory • Tehanu • Women \nin fantasy • Revision\nIntroduction: Reimagining Earthsea\n“I have decided that the trouble with print is, it never changes its mind,” \nLe Guin writes at the beginning of the second major collection of her \nnonfiction pieces Dancing at the Edge of the World (vii).

Redux,” a 1987 response \nto and running commentary on an earlier 1976 essay, Le Guin explains the \nmotivation behind laying bare the evidence of her evolving opinions in \nsuch a fashion: “It doesn’t seem right or wise to revise an old text severely, \nas if trying to obliterate it, hiding the evidence that one had to go there to \nget here. It is rather in the feminist mode to let one’s changes of mind, and \nthe processes of change, stand as evidence” (Dancing 7). Among the \nmany subjects that Le Guin has changed her mind about in print over her \nlong literary career, gender issues certainly appear especially prominently, \nas in this “reduxed” essay, chiefly a reflection on her novel The Left Hand \nof Darkness. The evolution of Le Guin’s thoughts about gender between \nthe original 1976 essay and 1987 revision chronologically matches the \nsimilar gap between The Farthest Shore (1972) and Tehanu (1990), the \nfourth Earthsea novel. The first (1968–1972) and second (1990–2001) \nEarthsea trilogies naturally approach gender in very different ways. If the \nprevious chapter emphasized two of the most notable critical frameworks \nthat scholars have brought to bear on her works, Daoism and Jungianism, \nthis chapter will thus take up what is likely the third, feminist and gender \nstudies. In the same 2012 afterword to Wizard in which she celebrates her \nprogressive approach to race in her 1968 fantasy worldbuilding, Le Guin \nconfesses to a deficiency where gender is concerned:\nThe principal characters were men. If the story was heroic, the hero was a \nwhite man; most dark-skinned people were inferior or evil. If there was a \nwoman in the story, she was a passive object of desire and rescue (a beautiful \nblond princess); active women (dark, witches) usually caused destruction or \ntragedy. Anyway, the stories weren’t about the women. They were about \nmen, what men did, and what was important to men. It’s in this sense that \nA Wizard was perfectly conventional. The hero does what a man is supposed \nto do: he uses his strength, wits, and courage to rise from humble begin­\nnings to great fame and power, in a world where women are secondary, a \nman’s world. (128–129)\nThis chapter will consider the roles and descriptions of the women charac­\nters in Wizard, many but not all of whom conform to the dichotomy of \npassive versus active-but-destructive women articulated above, and also \nbriefly examine how the later books in the series such as Tehanu—in \nAttebery’s words “a novel that denies nothing in the first trilogy and yet \nreinterprets all through a feminist lens” (“Always Coming Home” 15)—\nwork to redress the limitations of the first book’s implicit gender politics \nand conventional centering of the masculine hero.\n \nT.

The \nmost striking feature of gender relations in A Wizard of Earthsea, how­\never, may be how little the two genders seem to have to do with each \nother, or how seldom they come into contact with one another: men can \nbe wizards and heroes, but women can only be women.

But then he too began to look at the Lady of O, \nwondering if indeed this was such mortal beauty as the old tales told of.

You need not fear a woman’” (45). Perry \nNodelman even draws on Eve Sedgwick in order to argue that “Ged’s \ndesire to prove himself more powerful than Jasper is a readily understand­\nable expression of homosocial desire, and it makes good sense that he \nshould choose to express it by showing his power over a woman” (191). \nIn his pride—“all things were his to order, to command” (44)—Ged is \nalso attempting to exert his power over natural forces but also a woman \nspecifically, perhaps the merest hint of the ecofeminist concerns that would \ncome to characterize much of Le Guin’s later work.\nThe bulk of A Wizard of Earthsea, of course, will seem far from feminist \nto the twenty-first-century reader. Of the cast of women, those who \nattempt to wield magic like a man prove the most dangerous, underscor­\ning the fundamentally distinct domains in which the magic-using male \nheroes and the women characters may move. For one, the narrator \nobserves that, as a practitioner of magic, Ged’s aunt is both ignorant and \nlargely ineffectual compared to a male mage:\nNow the witch of Ten Alders was no black sorceress, nor did she ever med­\ndle with the high arts or traffic with Old Powers; but being an ignorant \nwoman among ignorant folk, she often used her crafts to foolish and dubi­\nous ends. She knew nothing of the Balance and the Pattern which the true \nwizard knows and serves, and which keep him from using his spells unless \nreal need demands. She had a spell for every circumstance, and was forever \nwearing charms. Much of her lore was mere rubbish and humbug, nor did \nshe know the true spells from the false. She knew many curses, and was bet­\nter at causing sickness, perhaps, than at curing it. (9–10)\nAs we learn from her unsuccessful attempt to “bind [Ged] […] to her \nservice” (9), she also seeks to deceive, dominate, and exploit another per­\nson, the latter a desire that in later works Le Guin would more usually \nassociate with a performance of destructive hypermasculinity, as in the \nopening of The Word for World Is Forest, which puts us in the mind of a \nman who thinks of women as “prime human stock” and the indigenous as \ndestined for genocide after enslavement (9). When danger comes to the \nvillage, she proves selfish, employing her magic to hide herself alone, \nwhereas Ged draws on his untrained power to conceal the entire village in \nthe spectral mists that allow the community to rout the Kargish invaders: \n5  BRINGING WOMEN TO ROKE KNOLL: GENDER AND THE LIFELONG… \n",

One of the things I learned was how to write as a woman, not as \nan honorary, or imitation, man. From a woman’s point of view, Earthsea \nlooked quite different than it did from a man’s point of view. All I had to do \nwas describe it from the point of view of the powerless, the disempowered—\nwomen, children, a wizard who has spent his gift and must live as an “ordi­\nnary” man. The same place, but how changed it seems! Some people hate \nthe book for that. They scold me for punishing Ged. I think I was rewarding \nhim.

Her later narratives, then, act \nnot so much as rebuttals but reframings, and, as we will see in the next \nsection, sometimes elaborate on points and themes suggested in Wizard \nitself, which is never uniformly dismissive of women despite its implicit \ngendering of the traditional hero’s journey as masculine.\nEnnobling Hearth and Home\n5  BRINGING WOMEN TO ROKE KNOLL: GENDER AND THE LIFELONG… \n",

Ged will not learn to share in and recognize \nthe value of homemaking himself until Tehanu, when Le Guin will not \nessentialize and code distinctly gendered spheres to the same extent: \namong the last words of The Other Wind, the final book in the series, \ncomes Ged’s simple but all-important explanation that he has “[k]ept the \nhouse” while Tenar has been involved in affairs of cosmic importance \n(891). Moreover, that Roke’s trained wizards practice a quasi-monastic \ncelibacy remains only implied in Wizard, but Le Guin clarifies and expands \non the significance of this detail of her worldbuilding in the second trilogy, \nwhere it is framed as unnecessary, misguided, and producing the effect of \nfurther separating them from women and so fundamentally limiting their \nunderstanding of and exchange with those who are not men.4 Sticking to \nthe first novel itself, however, we can still observe the seeds of this idea of \na separation between the world of the trained male mage and the other \nworld(s) across a gender line he can only dimly perceive, as in Ged’s \nthoughts on Yarrow above—or indeed lack of thoughts.\nWhile Le Guin limits Yarrow‘s role to that of domestic helpmeet, this \ndimension of the novel does contribute to a career-long theme of Le \nGuin’s, namely, the recognition and valorization of care work and even \nliteral housework, those traditionally feminized duties and occupations, \n“common people doing common things,” in Tenar’s phrasing from \nTehanu (466). For instance, anticipating the more sustained emphasis on \nthe importance of the domestic sphere in Le Guin’s final novel Lavinia \n(2008)—which adopts the perspective of the wife of the Roman patriarch \nand martial hero Aeneas—the narrator of her 2006 YA fantasy Voices \nreflects on the honor of housework more than once: “If it isn’t impor­\ntant, what is? If it isn’t done honorably, where is honor?” (69); “I always \n4 As Le Guin puts it in “Earthsea Revisioned,” “there is no interdependence of men with \nwomen” (987). The final short story “Dragonfly” in Tales from Earthsea treats the subject of \nthe magical celibacy very explicitly: “Maybe celibacy isn’t as necessary as the Rule of Roke \nteaches. Maybe it’s not a way of keeping the power pure, but of keeping the power to them­\nselves. Leaving out women” (703). It lies beyond the scope of this book to trace just how Le \nGuin handles the arrival(s) of women to Roke, but the same character’s subsequent exclama­\ntion will have to suffice: “A she-mage! Now that would change everything, all the rules!” \n(703). Free to remake an entire fantasy world, Le Guin aims to overturn the hierarchies of \nknowledge, power, and gender that wizardly magic represents more radically than mere \ncoeducational reforms would achieve. Accordingly, the story “The Finder” from Tales from \nEarthsea places women at the beginning of Roke’s story, but above all decenters Roke itself \nas a part of Earthsea’s magical fabric.\n \nT. S.

We could point to any number of other examples of the \nhousekeeping not being left out of Le Guin’s own tales, including the \nemphasis on various post-/pre-capitalist routines of daily life imagined in \nAlways Coming Home, and new ways of maintaining and rendering sacred \nhearth and home. Erin Newcomb finds such an elevation of care work at \nthe heart of Tehanu: “[T]he prominence of Tenar and her care work in \nTehanu simultaneously destabilizes the male monopoly of heroism and \nelevates ordinary women’s work to the potentially extraordinary” (96). \nBut we can glimpse nascent intimations of the same idea in Wizard, sub­\nordinated as it might finally be to the male heroics and coming-of-age arc \nthat dominate and define this first Earthsea novel. “I look back and see \nthat I was writing partly by the rules, as an artificial man,” writes Le Guin, \n“and partly against the rules, as an inadvertent revolutionary” (“Earthsea \nRevisioned” 982).\n5  BRINGING WOMEN TO ROKE KNOLL: GENDER AND THE LIFELONG… \n",

In her 1993 essay “Earthsea Revisioned,” Le \nGuin laments that, in Wizard as in much heroic fantasy and Western myth­\nmaking, “Women are seen in relation to heroes: as mother, wife, seducer, \nbeloved, victim, or rescuable maiden” (981). Yarrow’s work is vital, but \nshe remains a sister, a helper, subordinate to men, one among those, along \nwith “sailors’ wives and sisters […] on all the shores of all Earthsea,” who \nwatch “their men go out on the sea” (113).6\nLe Guin’s second trilogy in fact works to correct Ged’s own attitude \ntowards women, displacing what we might describe as the internalized \nmisogyny of the younger Le Guin—“I lived under the spell, the curse” \n(“Earthsea Revisioned” 987)—onto the cultures and characters depicted \nin her early books: the feminist education of Le Guin becomes mapped \nonto the continuing moral education of Ged and his wizardly compeers \nlong beyond the events of Wizard. Ged’s comparative anti-feminism as a \nyouth, from the perspective of the development of the series, therefore \nbecomes intelligible as one of his many flaws along with his pride and fear \n(or even a different manifestation of either or both). After all, when Ged \nhad delivered a forceful dismissal of the Lady of O among the enamored \nmale mages in training—“She’s only a woman”—Vetch had leapt in to \ncontradict him (38). Again it is Vetch and his family—Vetch with that \nappropriately earthly use name for a best friend who anchors you on your \npsychological journey—who offer this connection to both the ideal of \n5 As ever, Le Guin offers a vision of the good life or good society that remains open to \ndisagreement: “‘Well, it’s one good way,’ said Vetch. ‘There are others’” (108). We might \ncompare the opening half of her most famous short story “The Ones Who Walk Away from \nOmelas,” which invites readers to collaborate in producing a vision of perfection. Vetch \nshortly quotes a related adage that will appear throughout the series—“Infinite are the argu­\nments of mages” (110)—and throughout the books we see Le Guin having some of the argu­\nments with herself.\n6 Rawls takes a dim view of Yarrow as “a maiden, whose youthfulness, sweetness, and inno­\ncence, not to mention artless admiration, arouse the hero’s protective, brotherly instincts” \n(130). Such a description, while accurate, perhaps elides the importance of the incipient \nthemes to which other details of her character speak. It is true that she remains in the back­\nground of Ged’s story, and her primary role is paralleled by a prior instance of a woman \nfurnishing Ged with provisions: “[H]e ate and drank, and thought gratefully of the silent \nGontishwoman who had given him the food” (94).\n \nT.

For one, when describing the visceral impact \nof her narrator encountering a “Kponyungo, a firespitter” for the first time, \nOkorafor closely echoes Le Guin’s famous line about meeting dragons: \n“But oftentimes, encountering something in real life is not the same as \nencountering it in stories. Like now” (283–284). Le Guin’s own line \nreads, “[B]ut it is one thing to read about dragons and another to meet \nthem” (55). Who Fears Death also features an idealization of “balance” by \na magical mentor figure (144); dangers surrounding bringing back spirits \nof the dead; the main character Onyesonwu’s love of shapeshifting into a \nbird of prey (a vulture), just as Ged prefers his hawk shape; and in general \na shared affinity between these two characters with birds of prey: the \nyoung Onye can call owls to her (29), and as a child Duny first delights in \ncalling the falcon and the sparrowhawk (9–11).4 Certain of these similari­\nties may be coincidental or superficial in the end, but in Okorafor’s \nAfricanjujuism we see an author taking the idea of magic pedagogy in new \ndirections based on other literary and epistemological traditions.\n­\n­\n­\n3 Okorafor describes her own personal experiences in Nigeria and two African novels, Ben \nOkri’s The Famished Road and Amos Tutuola’s The Palm Wine Drinkard, as the most impor­\ntant influences on Akata Witch and its sequels (“Greatest influences”).\n4 Onyesonwu by contrast does not need to learn the birds’ true names: “Sometimes, if she \nsang in the evening, she attracted owls from far away. They’d land in the sand to listen. This \nwas the first sign Najeeba had that her daughter was not just Ewu but very special, \nunusual” (29).\n6  CONCLUSION: LE GUIN’S LEGACIES IN FICTION AND IN SCHOLARSHIP \n",

In Earthsea, it remains unclear whether nature or nurture matters \nmore for the cultivation of magical power, but some people possess a natu­\nral capacity others do not, as Ged’s aunt observes in him as a child: “When \nshe found that he knew nothing, and yet had spell-bound the goats to \ncome to him and follow him, then she saw that he must have in him the \nmakings of power” (8); “It was with one of these light spells that he first \nproved the great power that was in him” (11). Even Grossman’s The \nMagicians, a metafictional twenty-first-century novel that revisits the con­\ncept of the magic school in order to subvert some of its basic assumptions, \nremains unable to resist suggesting some connection between genetic \nheritage and magical capacity, with several characters coming from magical \nfamilies. Okorafor, conversely, challenges the assumption that magic \nwould be passed through biological lineage. Her distinctively Africanjujuist \nversion of the now ubiquitous YA narrative of the magic-user-in-training, \nAkata Witch, insists that the gift of juju remains linked to “spirit” and not \ngenetics: “It’s not a blood thing. Leopard ability doesn’t travel in the \nphysical. Though blood is familiar with spirit” (52). While the dominant \ncurrent of influence on magical pedagogy narratives remains Rowling, Le \nGuin’s continuing and often more subtle influence on authors as different \nas Okorafor, Atwood, and Mitchell means that Ged’s voyages have far \nfrom concluded.\nThe Future(s) of Le Guin Studies\n­\n­\nhttps://scholarworks.uni.edu/\nukl/\n5 Rowling once made plain on her website that “magic is a dominant and resilient gene” \n(“Squibs”).\n \nT.

Since the earliest \nscholarly commentary on her fiction from the late 1960s and early 1970s \nup through the final decade of her life, Le Guin demonstrated a magnani­\nmous generosity and simple curiosity about academic interpretations of \nher fiction, and, in the end, it seems apparent that her willingness and \ndesire to help shape the critical reception of her work has both expanded \nand constrained Le Guin studies as such. For a personal example of her \ncontinuing late-career generosity in action, when I was still a graduate \nstudent, she not only read a draft of my article-in-progress on her final \nnovel Lavinia, but offered several pages of feedback: “I’ll go through your \npaper now, responding where it might be useful or interesting to you (or \nme)—you can read, ignore, whatever” (“Myth remaking”). Several com­\nments offered gentle corrections of what she perceived to be off-the-mark \nassessments of direct influences, including a very emphatic refutation of \nanother scholar I’d cited who observed a parallel with C. S. Lewis’s own \nfinal novel Till We Have Faces: “I have never read Till We Have Faces. I \ncannot imagine how anything I ever wrote could ‘look back’ to it. I have \ntrouble with Lewis indeed: I detest his misogyny and snobbery, and resent \nhis misuse of his great talent in rather sneaky proselytising” (“Myth remak­\ning”). In other respects her responses revealed a more hands-off approach \nto interpretations of her work, and, as much as I appreciated her time and \nthoughtfulness, and as valuable as the decades of material in Le Guin’s \nown words we have available to us to help orient our interpretations, in \nthe end the future of Le Guin studies may well benefit from stepping a bit \n6 This original boom in Le Guin scholarship perhaps peaked with Harold Bloom’s 1986 \nanthology of essays on her work, published in his canon-making “Modern Critical Views” \nseries. From this same era, see also Joe de Bolt’s edited collection Ursula K. Le Guin: Voyager \nto Inner Lands and to Outer Space (1979); Joseph D. Olander and Martin Harry Greenberg’s \ncomparable collection from the same year, Ursula K.  Le Guin, part of their prophetic \n“Writers of the 21st Century” series; and James W.  Bittner’s overview Approaches to the \nFiction of Ursula K. Le Guin (1984, expanded from the author’s own 1979 dissertation). \nDonna R. White’s 1999 monograph Dancing with Dragons: Ursula K. Le Guin and the \nCritics remains the best study of how Le Guin’s exchanges with scholars and critics during \nthis time and after influenced her subsequent creative output; it also retains much value sim­\nply as a bibliographic work.\n6  CONCLUSION: LE GUIN’S LEGACIES IN FICTION AND IN SCHOLARSHIP \n",

An example of such work might \ninclude a recent essay on anthropocentrism and decoloniality by Katie \nStone, Eli Lee, and Francis Gene-Rowe:\nWe emphasize her debt to the scientific and temporal literacies of indigenous \npeoples while interrogating her placement of indigenous lifeways in a sup­\nposedly lost past. We argue that it is only by situating indigenous knowledge \nof the temporality of the nonhuman in the ongoing present that the narra­\ntive of progressive, linear time driving colonial extraction can be com­\nbated. (85)\nThe authors hold that Le Guin “works at times to reinforce, and at others \nto subvert, colonialism, anthropocentrism, and time as mutually constitu­\ntive categories,” approaching her work in a “spirit of listening and respond­\ning, challenging and rewriting” (85–86).\n­\n7\n­\n7 In their 2021 book Tolkien as a Literary Artist, Thomas Kullmann and Dirk Siepmann \nlament the closed ecosystem that is Tolkien studies: “Tolkien is analyzed and explained by \nmeans of Tolkien; material to work with is provided by biographical sources, posthumous \nTolkien publications and manuscripts. There is little input from contemporary English schol­\narship” (30n4). Le Guin studies may not be quite so hermeneutically sealed—and this cur­\nsory summation of all the work produced on Tolkien may itself overstate the insularity of \nTolkien studies—but Tolkien and Le Guin could both do to be read against the grain of their \nown interpretive inclinations more often than they have been, particularly (and understand­\nably) during the latter’s lifetime.\n \nT.

I was, as it were, their book. I pro­\nvided the text. Judgment on the text was up to them” (245). Likewise, in \nher afterword to The Other Wind, she explicitly writes, “[S]o long as I’ve \ntold the story rightly, finding its meaning, or a meaning, is rightly up to its \nreaders” (894). As new generations of readers continue to read and reread \nLe Guin’s works after her passing, we will no doubt see new critical mod­\nels applied and new understandings emerge. The depth of Wizard is such \nthat it has inspired a multitude of different interpretations over the \ndecades, including when an older Le Guin began to “read” the first trilogy \nof books differently herself, especially but not exclusively on issues related \nto gender: “Reading Le Guin’s writing […] against the grain is entirely in \nkeeping with her own practice of returning to and rewriting her own nar­\nratives” (Stone et al. 97). Earthsea is a place to keep returning to again and \nagain and see with new eyes. In fiction, we will continue to see the magic \nschool adapted to new contexts and storytelling traditions, and in the \nfuture new generations of writers and readers inside and outside of the \nacademy will continue to try to find out what Le Guin is teaching: “Yet \nthey who live there may know of farther lands” (117).\nReferences\nBittner, James W.

From the towns in its high valleys \nand the ports on its dark narrow bays many a Gontishman has gone forth to serve the \nLords of the Archipelago in their cities as wizard or mage, or, looking for adventure, to \nwander working magic from isle to isle of all Earthsea. Of these some say the greatest, \nand surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day \nbecame both dragonlord and Archmage. His life is told of in the Deed of Ged and in \nmany songs, but this is a tale of the time before his fame, before the songs were made.\nHe was born in a lonely village called Ten Alders, high on the mountain at the \nhead of the Northward Vale. Below the village the pastures and plowlands of the Vale \nslope downward level below level towards the sea, and other towns lie on the bends of \nthe River Ar; above the village only forest rises ridge behind ridge to the stone and snow \nof the heights.\n",

His father, the \nbronze-smith of the village, was a grim unspeaking man, and since Duny's six brothers \nwere older than he by many years and went one by one from home to farm the land or \nsail the sea or work as smith in other towns of the Northward Vale, there was no one to \nbring the child up in tenderness. He grew wild, a thriving weed, a tall, quick boy, loud \nand proud and full of temper. With the few other children of the village he herded goats \non the steep meadows above the riversprings; and when he was strong enough to push \nand pull the long bellows-sleeves, his father made him work as smith's boy, at a high \ncost in blows and whippings. There was not much work to be got out of Duny. He was \nalways off and away; roaming deep in the forest, swimming in the pools of the River Ar \nthat like all Gontish rivers runs very quick and cold, or climbing by cliff and scarp to the \nheights above the forest, from which he could see the sea, that broad northern ocean \nwhere, past Perregal, no islands are.\nA sister of his dead mother lived in the village. She had done what was needful for \nhim as a baby, but she had business of her own and once he could look after himself at \nall she paid no more heed to him. But one day when the boy was seven years old, \nuntaught and knowing nothing of the arts and powers that are in the world, he heard his \naunt crying out words to a goat which had jumped up onto the thatch of a hut and would \nnot come down: but it came jumping when she cried a certain rhyme to it. Next day \nherding the longhaired goats on the meadows of High Fall, Duny shouted to them the \nwords he had heard, not knowing their use or meaning or what kind of words they were:\nNoth hierth malk man\nhiolk han merth han!\nHe yelled the rhyme aloud, and the goats came to him. They came very quickly, all of \nthem together, mot making any sound. They looked at him out of the dark slot in their \nyellow eyes.\nDuny laughed and shouted it out again, the rhyme that gave him power over the \ngoats. They came closer, crowing and pushing round him. All at once he felt afraid of \ntheir thick, ridged horns and their strange eyes and their strange silence. He tried to get \nfree of them and to run away. The goats ran with him keeping in a knot around him, and \nso they came charging down into the village at last, all the goats going huddled together \nas if a rope were pulled tight round them, and the boy in the midst of them weeping and \n",

She let no child enter there \nusually, and the children feared the place. It was low and dusky, windowless, fragrant \nwith herbs that hung drying from the cross-pole of the roof, mint and moly and thyme, \nyarrow and rushwash and paramal, kingsfoil, clovenfoot, tansy and bay. There his aunt \nsat crosslegged by the firepit, and looking sidelong at the boy through the tangles of her \nblack hair she asked him what he had said to the goats, and if he knew what the rhyme \nwas. When she found that he knew nothing, and yet had spellbound the goats to come to \nhim and follow him, then she saw that he must have in him the makings of power.\nAs her sister's son he had been nothing to her, but now she looked at him with a \nnew eye. She praised him, and told him she might teach him rhymes he would like \nbetter, such as the word that makes a snail look out of its shell, or the name that calls a \nfalcon down from the sky.\n\"Aye, teach me that name!\" he said, being clear over the fright the goats had given \nhim, and puffed up with her praise of his cleverness.\nThe witch said to him, \"You will not ever tell that word to the other children, if I \nteach it to you.\"\n\"I promise.\"\nShe smiled at his ready ignorance. \"Well and good. But I will bind your promise. \nYour tongue will be stilled until I choose to unbind it, and even then, though you can \nspeak, you will not be able to speak the word I teach you where another person can hear \nit. We must keep the secrets of our craft.\"\n\"Good,\" said the boy, for he had no wish to tell the secret to his playmates, liking \nto know and do what they knew not and could not.\nHe sat still while his aunt bound back her un-combed hair, and knotted the belt of \nher dress, and sat crosslegged throwing handfuls of leaves into the firepit so that a \nsmoke spread and filled the darkness of the hut. She began to sing, Her voice changed \nsometimes to low or high as if another voice sang through her, and the singing went on \nand on until the boy did not know if he waked or slept, and all the while the witch's old \nblack dog that never barked sat by him with eyes red from the smoke.

Yet even as the spell \nbound him, he had laughed. She said nothing. She threw clear water on the fire till the \nsmoke cleared away, and gave the boy water to drink, and when the air was clear and he \ncould speak again she taught him the true name of the falcon, to which the falcon must \ncome.\nThis was Duny's first step on the way he was to follow all his life, the way of \nmagery, the way that led him at last to hunt a shadow over land and sea to the lightless \ncoasts of death's kingdom. But in those first steps along the way, it seemed a broad, \nbright road.\nWhen he found that the wild falcons stooped down to him from the wind when he \nsummoned them by name, lighting with a thunder of wings on his wrist like the hunting-\nbirds of a prince, then he hungered to know more such names and came to his aunt \nbegging to learn the name of the sparrowhawk and the osprey and the eagle. To earn the \nwords of power he did all the witch asked of him and learned of her all she taught, \nthough not all of it was pleasant to do or know. There is a saying on Gont, Weak as \nwoman's magic, and there is another saying, Wicked as woman's magic. Now the witch \nof Ten Alders was no black sorceress, nor did she ever meddle with the high arts or \ntraffic with Old Powers; but being an ignorant woman among ignorant folk, she often \nused her crafts to foolish and dubious ends. She knew nothing of the Balance and the \nPattern which the true wizard knows and serves, and which keep him from using his \nspells unless real need demands. She had a spell for every circumstance, and was forever \nwearing charms. Much of her lore was mere rubbish and humbug, nor did she know the \ntrue spells from the false. She knew many curses, and was better at causing sickness, \nperhaps, than at curing it. Like any village witch she could brew up a love-potion, but \nthere were other, uglier brews she made to serve men's jealousy and hate. Such practices, \nhowever, she kept from her young prentice, and as far as she was able she taught him \nhonest craft.\nAt first all his pleasure in the art-magic was, childlike, the power it gave him over \nbird and beast, and the knowledge of these. And indeed that pleasure stayed with him all \nhis life. Seeing him in the high pastures often with a bird of prey about him, the other \nchildren called him Sparrowhawk, and so he came by the name that he kept in later life \n",

He was very quick at \nit. The witch praised him and the children of the village began to fear him, and he \nhimself was sure that very soon he would become great among men. So he went on from \nword to word and from spell to spell with the witch till he was twelve years old and had \nlearned from her a great part of what she knew: not much, but enough for the witchwife \nof a small village, and more than enough for a boy of twelve. She had taught him all her \nlore in herbals and healing, and all she knew of the crafts of finding, binding, mending, \nunsealing and revealing. What she knew of chanters' tales and the great Deeds she had \nsung him, and all the words of the True Speech that she had learned from the sorcerer \nthat taught her, she taught again to Deny. And from weatherworkers and wandering \njugglers who went from town to town of the Northward Vale and the East Forest he had \nlearned various ticks and pleasantries, spells of Illusion. It was with one of these light \nspells that he first proved the great power that was in him.\nIn those days the Kargad Empire was strong. Those are four great lands that lie \nbetween the Northern and the Eastern Reaches: Karego-At, Atuan, Hur-at-Hur, Atnini. \nThe tongue they speak there is not like any spoken in the Archipelago or the other \nReaches, and they are a savage people, white-skinned, yellowhaired, and fierce, liking \nthe sight of blood and the smell of burning towns. Last year they had attacked the \nTorikles and the strong island Torheven, raiding in great force in fleets of redsailed \nships. News of this came north to Gont, but the Lords of Gont were busy with their \npiracy and paid small heed to the woes of other lands. Then Spevy fell to the Kargs and \nwas looted and laid waste, its people taken as slaves, so that even now it is an isle of \nruins. In lust of conquest the Kargs sailed next to Gont, coming in a host, thirty great \nlongships, to East Port. They fought through that town, took it, burned it; leaving their \nships under guard at the mouth of the River Ar they went up the Vale wrecking and \nlooting, slaughtering cattle and men. As they went they split into bands, and each of \nthese bands plundered where it chose. Fugitives brought warning to the villages of the \nheights. Soon the people of Ten Alders saw smoke darken the eastern sky, and that night \nthose who climbed the High Fall looked down on the Vale all hazed and red-streaked \nwith fires where fields ready for harvest had been set ablaze, and orchards burned, the \nfruit roasting on the blazing boughs, and urns and farmhouses smouldered in ruin.\nSome of the villagers fled up the ravines and hid in the forest, and some made \nready to fight for their lives, and some did neither but stood about lamenting. The witch \nwas one who fled; hiding alone in a cave up on the Kapperding Scarp and sealing the \ncave-mouth with spells. Duny's father the bronze-smith was one who stayed, for he \nwould not leave his smelting-pit and forge where he had worked for fifty years. All that \nnight he labored beating up what ready metal he had there into spearpoints, and others \n",

There had been no weapons in the village but \nhunting bows and short knives, for the mountain folk of Cont are not warlike; it is not \nwarriors they are famous for, but goat-thieves, sea pirates, and wizards.\nWith sunrise came a thick white fog, as on many autumn mornings in the heights \nof the island. Among their huts and houses down the straggling street of Ten'Alders the \nvillagers stood waiting with their hunting bows and new-forged spears, not knowing \nwhether the Kargs might be far-off or very near, all silent, all peering into the fog that \nhid shapes and distances and dangers from their eyes.\nWith them was Duny. He had worked all night at the forgebellows, pushing and \npulling the two long sleeves of goathide that fed the fire with a blast of sir. Now his arms \nso ached and trembled from that work that he could not hold out the spear he had \nchosen. He did not see how he could fight or be of any good to himself or the villagers. \nIt rankled at his heart that he should die, spitted on a Kargish lance, while still a boy: \nthat he should go into the dark land without ever having known his own name, his true \nname as a man. He looked down at his thin arms, wet with cold fogdew, and raged at his \nweakness, for he knew his strength. There was power in him, if he knew how to use it, \nand he sought among all the spells he knew for some device that might give him and his \ncompanions an advantage, or at least a chance. But need alone is not enough to set \npower free: there must be knowledge.\nThe fog was thinning now under the heat of the sun that shone bare above on the \npeak - in a bright sky. As the mists moved and parted in great drifts and smoky wisps, \nthe villagers saw a band of warriors coming up the mountain. They were armored with \nbronze helmets and greaves and breastplates of heavy leather and shields of wood and \nbronze, and armed with swords and the long Kargish lance. Winding up along the steep \nbank of the Ar they came in a plumed, clanking, straggling line, near enough already that \ntheir white faces could be seen, and the words of their jargon heard as they shouted to \none another. In this band of the invading horde there were about a hundred men, which \nis not many; but in the village were only eighteen men and boys.\nNow need called knowledge out: Duny, seeing the fog blow and thin across the \npath before the Kargs, saw a spell that might avail him. An old weatherworker of the \nVale, seeking to win the boy as prentice, had taught him several charms. One of these \ntricks was called fogweaving, a binding-spell that gathers the mists together for a while \nin one place; with it one skilled in illusion can shape the mist into fair ghostly seemings, \nwhich last a little and fade away. The boy had no such skill, but his intent was different, \nand he had the strength to turn the spell to his own ends. Rapidly and aloud he named \nthe places and the boundaries of the village, and then spoke the fogweaving charm, but \nin among its words he enlaced the words of a spell of concealment, and last he cried the \n",

He could hear the Kargs now at the end of the village, as \nnear as the great yew-tree by the tanner's yard. Their voices were clear, and the clink and \ncreak of their harness and arms, but they could not be seen. The fog had closed and \nthickened all over the village, greying the light, blurring the world till a man could \nhardly see his own hands before him.\n\"I've hidden us all,\" Duny said, sullenly, for his head hurt from his father's blow, \nand the working of the doubled incantation had drained his strength. \"I'll keep up this \nfog as long as I can. Get the others to lead them up to High Fall.\"\nThe smith stared at his son who stood wraithlike in that weird, dank mist. It took \nhim a minute to see Duny's meaning, but when he did he ran at once, noiselessly, \nknowing every fence and corner of the village, to find the others and tell them what to \ndo. Now through the grey fog bloomed a blur of red, as the Kargs set fire to the thatch of \na house. Still they did not come up into the village, but waited at the lower end till the \nmist should lift and lay bare their loot and prey.\nThe tanner, whose house it was that burned, sent a couple of boys skipping right \nunder the Kargs' noses, taunting and yelling and vanishing again like smoke into smoke. \nMeantime the older men, creeping behind fences and running from house to house, came \nclose on the other side and sent a volley of arrows and spears at the warriors, who stood \nall in a bunch. One Karg fell writhing with a spear, still warm from its forging, right \nthrough his body. Others were arrow-bitten, and all enraged. They charged forward then \nto hew down their puny attackers, but they found only the fog about them, full of voices. \nThey followed the voices, stabbing ahead into the mist with their great, plumed, \nbloodstained lances. Up the length of the street they came shouting, and never knew they \nhad run right through the village, as the empty huts and houses loomed and disappeared \nagain in the writhing grey fog. The villagers ran scattering, most of them keeping well \nahead since they knew the ground; but some, boys or old men, were slow. The Kargs \nstumbling on them drove their lances or hacked with their swords, yelling their war-cry, \nthe names of the White Godbrothers of Atuan:\n\"Wuluah! Atwah!\"\nSome of the band stopped when they felt the land grow rough underfoot, but \nothers pressed right on, seeking the phantom village, following dim wavering shapes \n",

One group of the Kargs chased the \nwraiths straight to the High Fall, the cliff's edge above the springs of Ar, and the shapes \nthey pursued ran out onto the air and there vanished in a thinning of the mist, while the \npursuers fell screaming through fog and sudden sunlight a hundred feet sheer to the \nshallow pools among the rocks. And those that came behind and did not fall stood at the \ncliff's edge, listening.\nNow dread came into the Kargs' hearts and they began to seek one another, not the \nvillagers, in the uncanny mist. They gathered on the hillside, and yet always there were \nwraiths and ghost-shapes among them; and other shapes that ran and stabbed from \nbehind with spear or knife and vanished again. The Kargs began to run, all of them, \ndownhill, stumbling, silent, until all at once they ran out from the grey blind mist and \nsaw the river and the ravines below the village all bare and bright in morning sunlight. \nThen they stopped, gathering together, and looked back. A wall of wavering, writhing \ngrey lay blank across the path, hiding all that lay behind it. Out from it burst two or three \nstragglers, lunging and stumbling along, their long lances rocking on their shoulders. \nNot one Karg looked back more than that once. All went down, in haste, away from the \nenchanted place.\nFarther down the Northward Vale those warriors got their fill of fighting. The \ntowns of the East Forest, from Ovark to the coast, had gathered their men and sent them \nagainst the invaders of Gont. Band after band they came down from the hills, and that \nday and the next the Kargs were harried back down to the beaches above East Port, \nwhere they found their ships burnt; so they fought with their backs to the sea till every \nman of them was killed, and the sands of Armouth were brown with blood until the tide \ncame in.\nBut on that morning in Ten Alders village and up on the High Fall, the dank grey \nfog had clung a while, and then suddenly it blew and drifted and melted away. This man \nand that stood up in the windy brightness of the morning, and looked about him \nwondering. Here lay a dead Karg with yellow hair long, loose; and bloody; there lay the \nvillage tanner, killed in battle like a king.\nDown in the village the house that bad been set afire still blazed. They ran to put \nthe fire out, since their battle had been won. In the street, near the great yew, they found \nDuny the bronze-smith's son standing by himself, bearing no hurt, but speechless and \nstupid like one stunned. They were well aware of what he had done, and they led him \ninto his father's house and went calling for the witch to come down out of her cave and \nheal the lad who had saved their lives and their property, all but four who were killed by \nthe Kargs, and the one house that was burnt.\n",

His aunt said, \"He has \noverspent his power,\" but she had no art to help him.\nWhile he lay thus dark and dumb, the story of the lad who wove the fog and \nscared off Kargish swordsmen with a mess of shadows was told all down the Northward \nVale, and in the East Forest, and high on the mountain and over the mountain even in the \nGreat Port of Gont. So it happened that on the fifth day after the slaughter at Armouth a \nstranger came into Ten Alders village, a man neither young nor old, who came cloaked \nand bareheaded, lightly carrying a great staff of oak that was as tall as himself. He did \nnot come up the course of the Ar like most people, but down, out of the forests of the \nhigher mountainside. The village goodwives saw well that he was a wizard, and when he \ntold them that he was a healall, they brought him straight to the smith's house. Sending \naway all but the boy's father and aunt the stranger stooped above the cot where Duny lay \nstaring into the dark, and did no more than lay his hand on the boy's forehead and touch \nhis lips once.\nDuny sat up slowly looking about him. In a little while he spoke, and strength and \nhunger began to come back into him. They gave him a little to drink and eat, and he lay \nback again, always watching the stranger with dark wondering eyes.\nThe bronze-smith said to that stranger, \"You are no common man.\"\n\"Nor will this boy be a common man,\" the other answered. \"The tale of his deed \nwith the fog has come to Re Albi, which is my home. I have come here to give him his \nname, if as they say he has not yet made his passage into manhood.\"\nThe witch whispered to the smith, \"Brother, this must surely be the Mage of Re \nAlbi, Ogion the Silent, that one who tamed the earthquake-\"\n\"Sir,\" said the bronze-smith who would not let a great name daunt him, \"my son \nwill be thirteen this month coming, but we thought to hold his Passage at the feast of \nSunreturn this winter.\"\n\"Let him be named as soon as may be,\" said the mage, \"for he needs his name. I \nhave other business now, but I will come back here for the day you choose. If you see fit \nI will take him with me when I go thereafter. And if he prove apt I will keep him as \nprentice, or see to it that he is schooled as fits his gifts.

The witch took \nfrom the boy his name Duny, the name his mother had given him as a baby. Nameless \nand naked he walked into the cold springs of the Ar where it rises among rocks under the \nhigh cliffs. As he entered the water clouds crossed the sun's face and great shadows slid \nand mingled over the water of the pool about him.

Maybe he and his master would run \ntogether as stags, or fly to Re Albi over the mountain on the wings of eagles.\nBut it was not so at all. They wandered, first down into the Vale and then \ngradually south and westward around the mountain, given lodging in little villages or \nspending the night out in the wilderness, like poor journeyman-sorcerers, or tinkers, or \nbeggars. They entered no mysterious domain. Nothing happened. The mage's oaken staff \nthat Ged had watched at first with eager dread was nothing but a stout staff to walk with. \nThree days went by and four days went by and still Ogion had not spoken a single charm \nin Ged's hearing, and had not taught him a single name or rune or spell.\nThough a very silent man he was so mild and calm that Ged soon lost his awe of \nhim, and in a day or two more he was bold enough to ask his master, \"When will my \napprenticeship begin, Sir?\"\n\"It has begun,\" said Ogion.\nThere was a silence, as if Ged was keeping back something he had to say. Then he \nsaid it: \"But I haven't learned anything yet!\"\n\"Because you haven't found out what I am teaching,\" replied the mage, going on \nat his steady, long-legged pace along their road, which was the high pass between Ovark \nand Wiss. He was a dark man, like most Gontishmen, dark copper-brown; grey-haired, \nlean and tough as a hound, tireless. He spoke seldom, ate little, slept less. His eyes and \nears were very keen, and often there was a listening look on his face.\nGed did not answer him. It is not always easy to answer a mage.\n\"You want to work spells,\" Ogion said presently, striding along. \"You've drawn \ntoo much water from that well. Wait. Manhood is patience. Mastery is nine times \npatience. What is that herb by the path?\"\n\"Strawflower.\"\n\"And that?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"Fourfoil, they call it.\" Ogion had halted, the coppershod foot of his staff near the \nlittle weed, so Ged looked closely at the plant, and plucked a dry seedpod from it, and \nfinally asked, since Ogion said nothing more, \"What is its use, Master?\"\n",

What, after all, is the use of you? or of myself? Is Gont Mountain useful, or \nthe Open Sea?\" Ogion went on a halfmile or so, and said at last, \"To hear, one must be \nsilent.\" \nThe boy frowned. He did not like to be made to feel a fool. He kept back his \nresentment and impatience, and tried to be obedient, so that Ogion would consent at last \nto teach him something. For he hungered to learn, to gain power. It began to seem to \nhim, though, that he could have learned more walking with any herb-gatherer or village \nsorcerer, and as they went round the mountain westward into the lonely forests past Wiss \nhe wondered more and more what was the greatness and the magic of this great Mage \nOgion. For when it rained Ogion would not even say the spell that every weatherworker \nknows, to send the storm aside. In a land where sorcerers come thick, like Gont or the \nEnlades, you may see a raincloud blundering slowly from side to side and place to place \nas one spell shunts it on to the next, till at last it is buffeted out over the sea where it can \nrain in peace. But Ogion let the rain fall where it would. He found a thick fir-tree and lay \ndown beneath it. Ged crouched among the dripping bushes wet and sullen, and \nwondered what was the good of having power if you were too wise to use it, and wished \nhe had gone as prentice to that old weatherworker of the Vale, where at least he would \nhave slept dry. He did not speak any of his thoughts aloud. He said not a word. His \nmaster smiled, and fell asleep in the rain.\nAlong towards Sunreturn when the first heavy snows began to fall in the heights \nof Gont they came to Re Albi, Ogion's home. It is a town on the edge of the high rocks \nof Overfell, and its name means Falcon's Nest. From it one can see far below the deep \nharbor and the towers of the Port of Gont, and the ships that go in and out the gate of the \nbay between the Armed Cliffs, and far to the west across the sea one may make out the \nblue hills of Oranea, easternmost of the Inward Isles.\nThe mage's house, though large and soundly built of timber, with hearth and \nchimney rather than a firepit, was like the huts of Ten Alders village: all one room, with \na goatshed built onto one side. There was a kind of alcove in the west wall of the room, \nwhere Ged slept. Over his pallet was a window that looked out on the sea, but most \noften the shutters must be closed against the great winds that blew all winter from the \nwest and north. In the dark warmth of that house Ged spent the winter, hearing the rush \nof rain and wind outside or the silence of snowfall, learning to write and read the Six \nHundred Runes of Hardic. Very glad he was to learn this lore, for without it no mere \nrote-learning of charms and spells will give a man true mastery.

All winter there was nothing but the \nheavy pages of the Runebook turning, and the rain and the snow falling; and Ogion \nwould come in from roaming the icy forests or from looking after his goats, and stamp \nthe snow off his boots, and sit down in silence by the fire. And the mage's long, listening \nsilence would fill the room, and fill Ged's mind, until sometimes it seemed he had \nforgotten what words sounded like: and when Ogion spoke at last it was as if he had, just \nthen and for the first time, invented speech. Yet the words he spoke were no great \nmatters but had to do only with simple things, bread and water and weather and sleep.\nAs the spring came on, quick and bright, Ogion often sent Ged forth to gather \nherbs on the meadows above Re Albi, and told him to take as long as he liked about it, \ngiving him freedom to spend all day wandering by rainfilled streams and through the \nwoods and over wet green fields in the sun. Ged went with delight each time, and stayed \nout till night; but he did not entirely forget the herbs. He kept an eye out for them, while \nhe climbed and roamed and waded and explored, and always brought some home. He \ncame on a meadow between two streams where the flower called white hallows grew \nthick, and as these blossoms are rare and prized by healers, he came back again next day. \nSomeone else was there before him, a girl, whom he knew by sight as the daughter of \nthe old Lord of Re Albi. He would not have spoken to her, but she came to him and \ngreeted him pleasantly: \"I know you, you are the Sparrowhawk, our mage's adept. I wish \nyou would tell me about sorcery!\"\nHe looked down at the white flowers that brushed against her white skirt, and at \nfirst he was shy and glum and hardly answered. But she went on talking, in an open, \ncareless, wilful way that little by little set him at ease. She was a tall girl of about his \nown age, very sallow, almost white-skinned; her mother, they said in the village, was \nfrom Osskil or some such foreign land. Her hair fell long and straight like a fall of black \nwater. Ged thought her very ugly, but he had a desire to please her, to win her \nadmiration, that grew on him as they talked. She made him tell all the story of his tricks \nwith the mist that had defeated the Kargish warriors, and she listened as if she wondered \nand admired, but she spoke no praise. And soon she was off on another tack: \"Can you \ncall the birds and beasts to you?\" she asked.\n\"I can,\" said Ged.\nHe knew there was a falcon's nest in the cliffs above the meadow, and he \nsummoned the bird by its name. It came, but it would not light on his wrist, being put off \nno doubt by the girl's presence. It screamed and struck the air with broad barred wings, \n",

He would not let her mock him. \"I might if I chose,\" he said \nin a calm voice.\n\"Is it not very difficult, very dangerous, to summon a spirit?\"\n\"Difficult, yes. Dangerous?\" He shrugged.\nThis time be was almost certain there was admiration in her eyes.\n\"Can you make a love-charm?\"\n\"That is no mastery.\"\n\"True,\" says she, \"any village witch can do it. Can you do Changing spells? Can \nyou change your own shape, as wizards do, they say?\"\nAgain he was not quite sure that she did not ask the question mockingly, and so \nagain he replied, \"I might if I chose.\"\nShe began to beg him to transform himself into anything he wished - a hawk, a \nbull, a fire, a tree. He put her off with sort secretive words such as his master used, but \nhe did not know how to refuse flatly when she coaxed him; and besides he did not know \nwhether he himself believed his boast, or not.

These books \nwere very ancient, Ogion having them from his own master Heleth Farseer, and Heleth \nfrom his master the Mage of Perregal, and so back into the times of myth.

It seemed to reach out \ntowards him, and to whisper, and to call to him in a whisper: but he could not understand \nthe words.\nThe door was flung wide. A man entered with a white light flaming about him, a \ngreat bright figure who spoke aloud, fiercely and suddenly. The darkness and the \nwhispering ceased and were dispelled.\nThe horror went out of Ged, but still he was mortally afraid, for it was Ogion the \nMage who stood there in the doorway with a brightness all about him, and the oaken \nstaff in his hand burned with a white radiance.\nSaying no word the mage came past Ged, and lighted the lamp, and put the books \naway on their shelf.

There at the \nlandgate between carven dragons the guards of the City of Gont, seeing the mage, knelt \nwith bared swords and welcomed him. They knew him and did him honor by the \nPrince's order and their own will, for ten years ago Ogion had saved the city from \nearthquake that would have shaken the towers of the rich down to the ground and closed \nthe channel of the Armed Cliffs with avalanche. He had spoken to the Mountain of Gont, \ncalming it, and had stilled the trembling precipices of the Overfell as one soothes a \nfrightened beast. Ged had heard some talk of this, and now, wondering to see the armed \nguardsmen kneel to his quiet master, he remembered it. He glanced up almost in fear at \nthis man who had stopped an earthquake; but Ogion's face was quiet as always.\nThey went down to the quays, where the Harbormaster came hastening to \nwelcome Ogion and ask what service he might do. The mage told him, and at once he \nnamed a ship bound for the Inmost Sea aboard which Ged might go as passenger. \"Or \nthey will take him as windbringer,\" he said, \"if he has the craft. They have no \nweatherworker aboard.\"\n\"He has some skill with mist and fog, but none with seawinds,\" the mage said, \nputting his hand lightly on Ged's shoulder. \"Do not try any tricks with the sea and the \nwinds of the sea, Sparrowhawk; you are a landsman still.

Ged stood forlorn and watched his master go.\n\"Come along, lad,\" said the Harbormaster, and took him down the waterfront to \nthe pier where Shadow was making ready to sail.\nIt might seem strange that on an island fifty miles wide, in a village under cliffs \nthat stare out forever on the sea, a child may grow to manhood never having stepped in a \nboat or dipped his finger in salt water, but so it is.

He never looked at Ged but asked him in a mighty \nvoice, \"Can you work weather, boy?\"\n\"I can. \"\n\"Can you bring the wind?'\nHe had to say he could not, and with that the master told him to find a place out of \nthe way and stay in it.\nThe oarsmen were coming aboard now, for the ship was to go out into the \nroadstead before night fell, and sail with the ebb-tide near dawn. There was no place out \nof the way, but Ged climbed up as well as he could onto the bundled, lashed, and hide-\ncovered cargo in the stern of the ship, and clinging there watched all that passed. The \noarsmen came leaping aboard, sturdy men with great arms, while longshoremen rolled \nwater barrels thundering out the dock and stowed them under the rowers' benches. The \nwellbuilt ship rode low with her burden, yet danced a little on the lapping shore-waves, \nready to be gone. Then the steersman took his place at the right of the sternpost, looking \nforward to the ship's master, who stood on a plank let in at the jointure of the keel with \nthe stem, which was carved as the Old Serpent of Andrad. The master roared his orders \nhugely, and Shadow was untied and towed clear of the docks by two laboring rowboats. \n",

The rowers bent their strong backs while a lad up beside the master beat the stroke \non a drum. Easy as a gull oared by her wings the ship went now, and the noise and \nhurly-burly of the City fell away suddenly behind. They came out in the silence of the \nwaters of the bay, and over them rose the white peak of the Mountain, seeming to hang \nabove the sea. In a shallow creek in the lee of the southern Armed Cliff the anchor was \nthrown over, and there they rode the night.\nOf the seventy crewmen of the ship some were like Ged very young in years, \nthough all had made their passage into manhood. These lads called him over to share \nfood and drink with them, and were friendly though rough and full of jokes and jibes. \nThey called him Goatherd, of course, because he was Gontish, but they did not go \nfurther than that. He was as tall and strong as the fifteen-year-olds, and quick to return \neither a good word or a jeer; so he made his way among them and even that first night \nbegan to live as one of them and learn their work. This suited the ship's officers, for \nthere was no room aboard for idle passengers.\nThere was little enough room for the crew, and no comfort at all, in an undecked \ngalley crowded with men and gear and cargo; but what was comfort to Ged? He lay that \nnight among corded rolls of pelts from the northern isles and watched the stars of spring \nabove the harbor waters and the little yellow lights of the City astern, and he slept and \nwaked again full of delight. Before dawn the tide turned. They raised anchor and rowed \nsoftly out between the Armed Cliffs. As sunrise reddened the Mountain of Gont behind \nthem they raised the high sail and ran southwestward over the Gontish Sea.\nBetween Barnisk and Torheven they sailed with a light wind, and on the second \nday came in sight of Havnor, the Great Island, heart and hearth of the Archipelago. For \nthree days they were in sight of the green hills of Havnor as they worked along its \neastern coast, but they did not come to shore. Not for many years did Ged set foot on \nthat land or see the white towers of Havnor Great Port at the center of the world.\nThey lay over one night at Kembermouth, the northern port of Way Island, and the \nnext at a little town on the entrance of Felkway Bay, and the next day passed the \nnorthern cape of O and entered the Ebavnor Straits. There they dropped sail and rowed, \nalways with land on either side and always within hail of other ships, great and small, \nmerchants and traders, some bound in from the Outer Reaches with strange cargo after a \nvoyage of years and others that hopped like sparrows from isle to isle of the Inmost Sea. \nTurning southward out of the crowded Straits they left Havnor astern and sailed between \nthe two fair islands Ark and Ilien, towered and terraced with cities, and then through rain \nand rising wind began to beat their way across the Inmost Sea to Roke Island.\nIn the night as the wind freshened to a gale they took down both sail and mast, \n",

The long ship lay steady on the waves and went \ngallantly, but the steersman at the long steering-sweep in the stern looked into the rain \nthat beat the sea and saw nothing but the rain. They went southwest by the pointing of \nthe magnet, knowing how they went, but not through what waters. Ged heard men speak \nof the shoal waters north of Roke, and of the Borilous Rocks to the east; others argued \nthat they might be far out of course by now, in the empty waters south of Kamery. Still \nthe wind grew stronger, tearing the edges of the great waves into flying tatters of foam, \nand still they rowed southwest with the wind behind them. The stints at the oars were \nshortened, for the labor was very hard; the younger lads were set two to an oar, and Ged \ntook his turn with the others as he had since they left Gont. When they did not row they \nbailed, for the seas broke heavy on the ship. So they labored among the waves that ran \nlike smoking mountains under the wind, while the rain beat hard and cold on their backs, \nand the drum thumped through the noise of the storm like a heart thumping.\nA man came to take Ged's place at the oar, sending him to the ship's master in the \nbow. Rainwater dripped from the hem of the master's cloak, but he stood stout as a \nwinebarrel on his bit of decking and looking down at Ged he asked, \"Can you abate this \nwind, lad?\"\n\"No, sir.\"\n\"Have you craft with iron?\"\nHe meant, could Ged make the compass-needle point their way to Roke, making \nthe magnet follow not its north but their need. That skill is a secret of the Seamasters, \nand again Ged must say no.\n\"Well then,\" the master bellowed through the wind and rain, \"you must find some \nship to take you back to Roke from Hort Town. Roke must be west of us now, and only \nwizardry could bring us there through this sea. We must keep south.\"\nGed did not like this, for he had heard the sailors talk of Hort Town, how it was a \nlawless place, full of evil traffic, where men were often taken and sold into slavery in the \nSouth Reach. Returning to his labor at the oar he pulled away with his companion, a \nsturdy Andradean lad, and heard the drum beat the stroke and saw the lantern hung on \nthe stern bob and flicker as the wind plucked it about, a tormented fleck of light in the \nrain-lashed dusk. He kept looking to westward, as often as he could in the heavy rhythm \nof pulling the oar. And as the ship rose on a high swell he saw for a moment over the \ndark smoking water a light between clouds, as it might be the last gleam of sunset: but \nthis was a clear light, not red.\nHis oar-mate had not seen it, but he called it out.

Then Ged called to one of the lads that was bailing to take his place \non the bench a minute, and made his way forward again along the encumbered aisle \nbetween the benches, and catching hold of the carved prow to keep from being pitched \noverboard he shouted up to the master, \"Sir! that light to the west is Roke Island!\"\n\"I saw no light,\" the master roared, but even as he spoke Ged flung out his arm \npointing, and all saw the light gleam clear in the west over the heaving scud and tumult \nof the sea.\nNot for his passenger's sake, but to save his ship from the peril of the storm, the \nmaster shouted at once to the steersman to head westward toward the light. But he said \nto Ged, \"Boy, you speak like a Seamaster, but I tell you if you lead us wrong in this \nweather I will throw you over to swim to Roke!\"\nNow instead of running before the storm they must row across the wind's way, \nand it was hard: waves striking the ship abeam pushed her always south of their new \ncourse, and rolled her, and filled her with water so that bailing must be ceaseless, and the \noarsmen must watch lest the ship rolling should lift their oars out of water as they pulled \nand so pitch them down among the benches. It was nearly dark under the stormclouds, \nbut now and again they made out the light to the west, enough to set course by, and so \nstruggled on. At last the wind dropped a little, and the light grew broad before them. \nThey rowed on, and they came as it were through a curtain, between one oarstroke and \nthe next running out of the storm into a clear air, where the light of after-sunset glowed \nin the sky and on the sea. Over the foam-crested waves they saw not far off a high, \nround, green hill, and beneath it a town built on a small bay where boats lay at anchor, \nall in peace.\nThe steersman leaning on his long sweep turned his bead and called, \"Sir! is this \ntrue land or a witchery?\"\n\"Keep her as she goes, you witless woodenhead! Row, you spineless slave-sons! \nThat's Thwil Bay and the Knoll of Roke, as any fool could see! Row!\"\nSo to the beat of the drum they rowed wearily into the bay. There it was still, so \nthat they could hear the voices of people up in the town, and a bell ringing, and only far \noff the hiss and roaring of the storm. Clouds hung dark to north and east and south a \nmile off all about the island. But over Roke stars were coming out one by one in a clear \nand quiet sky.\n",

The town of Thwil is not large, its high houses huddling close over a few steep \nnarrow streets. To Ged, however, it seemed a city, and not knowing where to go he asked \nthe first townsman of Thwil he met where he would find the Warder of the School on \nRoke. The man looked at him sidelong a while and said, \"The wise don't need to ask, the \nfool asks in vain,\" and so went on along the street. Ged went uphill till he came out into \na square, rimmed on three sides by the houses with their sharp slate roofs and on the \nfourth side by the wall of a great building whose few small windows were higher than \nthe chimneytops of the houses: a fort or castle it seemed, built of mighty grey blocks of \nstone. In the square beneath it market-booths were set up and there was some coming \nand going of people. Ged asked his question of an old woman with a basket of mussels, \nand she replied, \"You cannot always find the Warder where he is, but sometimes you \nfind him where he is not,\" and went on crying her mussels to sell.\nIn the great building, near one corner, there was a mean little door of wood. Ged \nwent to this and knocked loud. To the old man who opened the door he said, \"I bear a \nletter from the Mage Ogion of Gont to the Warder of the School on this island. I want to \nfind the Warder, but I will not hear more riddles and scoffing!\"\n\"This is the School,\" the old man said mildly. \"I am the doorkeeper. Enter if you \ncan.\"\nGed stepped forward. It seemed to him that he had passed through the doorway: \nyet he stood outside on the pavement where he had stood before.\nOnce more he stepped forward, and once more he remained standing outside the \ndoor. The doorkeeper, inside, watched him with mild eyes.\nGed was not so much baffled as angry, for this seemed like a further mockery to \nhim. With voice and hand he made the Opening spell which his aunt had taught him long \nago; it was the prize among all her stock of spells, and he wove it well now. But it was \nonly a witch's charm, and the power that held this doorway was not moved at all.\n",

Stepping forward then he entered the open doorway. \nYet it seemed to him that though the light was behind him, a shadow followed him in at \nhis heels.\nHe saw also as he turned that the doorway through which he had come was not \nplain wood as he had thought, but ivory without joint or seam: it was cut, as he knew \nlater, from a tooth of the Great Dragon. The door that the old man closed behind him \nwas of polished horn, through which the daylight shone dimly, and on its inner face was \ncarved the Thousand-Leaved Tree.\n\"Welcome to this house, lad,\" the doorkeeper said, and without saying more led \nhim through halls and corridors to an open court far inside the walls of the building. The \ncourt was partly paved with stone, but was roofless, and on a grassplot a fountain played \nunder young trees in the sunlight. There Ged waited alone some while. He stood still, \nand his heart beat hard, for it seemed to him that he felt presences and powers at work \nunseen about him here, and he knew that this place was built not only of stone but of \nmagic stronger than stone. He stood in the innermost room of the House of the Wise, and \nit was open to the sky. Then suddenly he was aware of a man clothed in white who \nwatched him through the falling water of the fountain.\nAs their eyes met, a bird sang aloud in the branches of the tree. In that moment \nGed understood the singing of the bird, and the language of the water falling in the basin \nof the fountain, and the shape of the clouds, and the beginning and end of the wind that \nstirred the leaves: it seemed to him that he himself was a word spoken by the sunlight.\nThen that moment passed, and he and the world were as before, or almost as \nbefore. He went forward to kneel before the Archmage, holding out to him the letter \nwritten by Ogion.\nThe Archmage Nemmerle, Warder of Roke, was an old man, older it was said than \nany man then living.

I send you one who will be greatest of the wizards \nof Gont, if the wind blow true. This was signed, not with Ogion's true name which Ged \nhad never yet learned, but with Ogion's rune, the Closed Mouth.\n\"He who holds the earthquake on a leash has sent you, for which be doubly \nwelcome.

He was two or three years older \nthan Ged, very tall, and he moved and carried himself with stiff grace, posing (Ged \nthought) like a dancer. He wore a grey cloak with hood thrown back.

Jasper \ntook Ged to sit with a heavyset fellow called Vetch, who said nothing much but \nshovelled in his food with a will. He had the accent of the East Reach, and was very dark \nof skin, not red-brown like Ged and Jasper and most folk of the Archipelago, but black-\nbrown. He was plain, and his manners were not polished. He grumbled about the dinner \nwhen he had finished it, but then turning to Ged said, \"At least it's not illusion, like so \nmuch around here; it sticks to your ribs.\" Ged did not know what he meant, but he felt a \ncertain liking for him, and was glad when after the meal he stayed with them.\nThey went down into the town, that Ged might learn his way about it. Few and \nshort as were the streets of Thwil, they turned and twisted curiously among the high-\nroofed houses, and the way was easy to lose. It was a strange town, and strange also its \npeople, fishermen and workmen and artisans like any others, but so used to the sorcery \nthat is ever at play on the Isle of the Wise that they seemed half sorcerers themselves. \nThey talked (as Ged had learned) in riddles, and not one of them would blink to see a \nboy turn into a fish or a house fly up into the air, but knowing it for a schoolboy prank \nwould go on cobbling shoes or cutting up mutton, unconcerned.\nComing up past the Back Door and around through the gardens of the Great \nHouse, the three boys crossed the clear-running Thwilburn on a wooden bridge and went \non northward among woods and pastures. The path climbed and wound. They passed \noakgroves where shadows lay thick for all the brightness of the sun. There was one \ngrove not far away to the left that Ged could never quite see plainly.

But Vetch came to the door, a little bluish ball of werelight nodding over \nhis head to light the way, and asked if be could come in and talk a while. He asked Ged \nabout Gont, and then spoke fondly of his own home isles of the East Reach, telling how \nthe smoke of village hearthfires is blown across that quiet sea at evening between the \nsmall islands with funny names: Korp, Kopp, and Holp, Venway and Vemish, Ifiish, \nKoppish, and Sneg. When he sketched the shapes of those lands on the stones of the \nfloor with his finger to show Ged how they lay, the lines he drew shone dim as if drawn \nwith a stick of silver for a while before they faded. Vetch had been three years at the \nSchool, and soon would be made Sorcerer; he thought no more of performing the lesser \narts of magic than a bird thinks of flying. Yet a greater, unlearned skill he possessed, \nwhich was the art of kindness. That night, and always from then on, he offered and gave \nGed friendship, a sure and open friendship which Ged could not help but return.\nYet Vetch was also friendly to Jasper, who had made Ged into a fool that first day \non Roke Knoll. Ged would not forget this, nor, it seemed, would Jasper, who always \nspoke to him with a polite voice and a mocking smile. Ged's pride would not be slighted \nor condescended to. He swore to prove to Jasper, and to all the rest of them among \nwhom Jasper was something of a leader, how great his power really was - some day. For \nnone of them, for all their clever tricks, had saved a village by wizardry. Of none of \nthem had Ogion written that he would be the greatest wizard of Gont.\nSo bolstering up his pride, he set all his strong will on the work they gave him, the \nlessons and crafts and histories and skills taught by the grey-cloaked Masters of Roke, \nwho were called the Nine.\nPart of each day he studied with the Master Chanter, learning the Deeds of heroes \nand the Lays of wisdom, beginning with the oldest of all songs, the Creation of Ea. Then \nwith a dozen other lads he would practice with the Master Windkey at arts of wind and \nweather. Whole bright days of spring and early summer they spent out in Roke Bay in \nlight catboats, practising steering by word, and stilling waves, and speaking to the \nworld's wind, and raising up the magewind. These are very intricate skills, and \nfrequently Ged's head got whacked by the swinging boom as the boat jibed under a wind \nsuddenly blowing backwards, or his boat and another collided though they had the \nwhole bay to navigate in, or all three boys in his boat went swimming unexpectedly as \nthe boat was swamped by a huge, unintended wave. There were quieter expeditions \nashore, other days, with the Master Herbal who taught the ways and properties of things \nthat grow; and the Master Hand taught sleight and jugglery and the lesser arts of \nChanging.\n",

Especially the tricks of illusion came to him so easily \nthat it seemed he had been born knowing them and needed only to be reminded. The \nMaster Hand was a gentle and lighthearted old man, who had endless delight in the wit \nand beauty of the crafts he taught; Ged soon felt no awe of him, but asked him for this \nspell and that spell, and always the Master smiled and showed him what he wanted. But \none day, having it in mind to put Jasper to shame at last, Ged said to the Master Hand in \nthe Court of Seeming, \"Sir, all these charms are much the same; knowing one, you know \nthem all. And as soon as the spell-weaving ceases, the illusion vanishes. Now if I make a \npebble into a diamond-\" and he did so with a word and a flick of his wrist \"what must I \ndo to make that diamond remain diamond? How is the changing-spell locked, and made \nto last?\"\nThe Master Hand looked at the jewel that glittered on Ged's palm, bright as the \nprize of a dragon's hoard. The old Master murmured one word, \"Tolk,\" and there lay the \npebble, no jewel but a rough grey bit of rock. The Master took it and held it out on his \nown hand. \"This is a rock; tolk in the True Speech,\" he said, looking mildly up at Ged \nnow. \"A bit of the stone of which Roke Isle is made, a little bit of the dry land on which \nmen live. It is itself. It is part of the world. By the Illusion-Change you can make it look \nlike a diamond -or a flower or a fly or an eye or a flame-\" The rock flickered from shape \nto shape as he named them, and returned to rock. \"But that is mere seeming. Illusion \nfools the beholder's senses; it makes him see and hear and feel that the thing is changed. \nBut it does not change the thing. To change this rock into a jewel, you must change its \ntrue name. And to do that, my son, even to so small a scrap of the world, is to change the \nworld. It can be done. Indeed it can be done. It is the art of the Master Changer, and you \nwill learn it, when you are ready to learn it. But you must not change one thing, one \npebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act. \nThe world is in balance, in Equilibrium. A wizard's power of Changing and of \nSummoning can shake the balance of the world. It is dangerous, that power. It is most \nperilous. It must follow knowledge, and serve need. To light a candle is to cast a \nshadow...\"\nHe looked down at the pebble again. \"A rock is a good thing, too, you know,\" he \nsaid, speaking less gravely. \"If the Isles of Eartbsea were all made of diamond, we'd lead \na hard life here. Enjoy illusions, lad, and let the rocks be rocks.\" He smiled, but Ged left \ndissatisfied. Press a mage for his secrets and he would always talk, like Ogion, about \nbalance, and danger, and the dark. But surely a wizard, one who had gone past these \nchildish tricks of illusion to the true arts of Summoning and Change, was powerful \nenough to do what he pleased, and balance the world as seemed best to him, and drive \nback darkness with his own light.\nIn the corridor he met Jasper, who, since Ged's accomplishments began to be \n",

The only true magic \nthey've taught me yet on Roke is making werelight, and some weatherworking. The rest \nis mere foolery.\"\n\"Even foolery is dangerous,\" said Jasper, \"in the hands of a fool.\"\nAt that Ged turned as if he had been slapped, and took a step towards Jasper; but \nthe older boy smiled as if he had not intended any insult, nodded his head in his stiff, \ngraceful way, and went on.\nStanding there with rage in his heart, looking after Jasper, Ged swore to himself to \noutdo his rival, and not in some mere illusion-match but in a test of power. He would \nprove himself, and humiliate Jasper. He would not let the fellow stand there looking \ndown at him, graceful, disdainful, hateful.\nGed did not stop to think why Jasper might hate him. He only knew why he hated \nJasper. The other prentices had soon learned they could seldom match themselves \nagainst Ged either in sport or in earnest, and they said of him, some in praise and some \nin spite, \"He's a wizard born, he'll never let you beat him.\" Jasper alone neither praised \nhim nor avoided him, but simply looked down at him, smiling slightly. And therefore \nJasper stood alone as his rival, who must be put to shame.\nHe did not see, or would not see, that in this rivalry, which he clung to and \nfostered as part of his own pride, there was anything of the danger, the darkness, of \nwhich the Master Hand had mildly warned him.\nWhen he was not moved by pure rage, he knew very well that he was as yet no \nmatch for Jasper, or any of the older boys, and so he kept at his work and went on as \nusual. At the end of summer the work was slackened somewhat, so there was more time \nfor sport: spell-boat races down in the harbor, feats of illusion in the courts of the Great \nHouse, and in the long evenings, in the groves, wild games of hide-and-seek where \nhiders and seeker were both invisible and only voices moved laughing and calling \namong the trees, following and dodging the quick, faint werelights. Then as autumn \ncame they set to their tasks afresh, practising new magic. So Ged's first months at Roke \nwent by fast, full of passions and wonders.\n",

There by himself lived \nthe Master Namer, who was called by a name that had no meaning in any language, \nKurremkarmerruk. No farm or dwelling lay within miles of the Tower. Grim it stood \nabove the northern cliffs, grey were the clouds over the seas of winter, endless the lists \nand ranks and rounds of names that the Namer's eight pupils must learn. Amongst them \nin the Tower's high room Kurremkarmerruk sat on a high seat, writing down lists of \nnames that must be learned before the ink faded at midnight leaving the parchment blank \nagain. It was cold and half-dark and always silent there except for the scratching of the \nMaster's pen and the sighing, maybe, of a student who must learn before midnight the \nname of every cape, point, bay, sound, inlet, channel, harbor, shallows, reef and rock of \nthe shores of Lossow, a little islet of the Pelnish Sea. If the student complained the \nMaster might say nothing, but lengthen the list; or he might say, \"He who would be \nSeamaster must know the true name of every drop of water in the sea.\"\nGed sighed sometimes, but he did not complain. He saw that in this dusty and \nfathomless matter of learning the true name of every place, thing, and being, the power \nhe wanted lay like a jewel at the bottom of a dry well. For magic consists in this, the true \nnaming of a thing. So Kurremkarmerruk had said to them, once, their first night in the \nTower; he never repeated it, but Ged did not forget his words. \"Many a mage of great \npower,\" he had said, \"has spent his whole life to find out the name of one single thing - \none single lost or hidden name. And still the lists are not finished. Nor will they be, till \nworld's end. Listen, and you will see why. In the world under the sun, and in the other \nworld that has no sun, there is much that has nothing to do with men and men's speech, \nand there are powers beyond our power. But magic, true magic, is worked only by those \nbeings who speak the Hardic tongue of Earthsea, or the Old Speech from which it grew.\n\"That is the language dragons speak, and the language Segoy spoke who made the \nislands of the world, and the language of our lays and songs, spells, enchantments, and \ninvocations. Its words lie hidden and changed among our Hardic words. We call the \nfoam on waves sukien: that word is made from two words of the Old Speech, suk, \nfeather, and inien, the sea. Feather of the sea, is foam. But you cannot charm the foam \ncalling it sukien; you must use its own true name in the Old Speech, which is essa. Any \nwitch knows a few of these words in the Old Speech, and a mage knows many. But there \nare many more, and some have been lost over the ages, and some have been hidden, and \nsome are known only to dragons and to the Old Powers of Earth, and some are known to \nno living creature; and no man could learn them all. For there is no end to that language.\n\"Here is the reason. The sea's name is inien, well and good. But what we call the \nInmost Sea has its own name also in the Old Speech. Since no thing can have two true \nnames, inien can mean only `all the sea except the Inmost Sea.' And of course it does not \nmean even that, for there are seas and bays and straits beyond counting that bear names \n",

So if some Mage-Seamaster were mad enough to try to lay a spell of storm \nor calm over all the ocean, his spell must say not only that word inien, but the name of \nevery stretch and bit and part of the sea through all the Archipelago and all the Outer \nReaches and beyond to where names cease. Thus, that which gives us the power to work \nmagic, sets the limits of that power. A mage can control only what is near him, what he \ncan name exactly and wholly. And this is well. If it were not so, the wickedness of the \npowerful or the folly of the wise would long ago have sought to change what cannot be \nchanged, and Equilibrium would fail. The unbalanced sea would overwhelm the islands \nwhere we perilously dwell, and in the old silence all voices and all names would be \nlost.\"\nGed thought long on these words, and they went deep in his understanding. Yet \nthe majesty of the task could not make the work of that long year in the Tower less hard \nand dry; and at the end of the year Kurremkarmerruk said to him, \"You have made a \ngood beginning.\" But no more. Wizards speak truth, and it was true that all the mastery \nof Names that Ged had toiled to win that year was the mere start of what he must go on \nlearning all his life. He was let go from the Isolate Tower sooner than those who had \ncome with him, for he had learned quicker; but that was all the praise he got.\nHe walked south across the island alone in the early winter, along townless empty \nroads. As night came on it rained. He said no charm to keep the rain off him, for the \nweather of Roke was in the hands of the Master Windkey and might not be tampered \nwith. He took shelter under a great pendick-tree, and lying there wrapped in his cloak he \nthought of his old master Ogion, who might still be on his autumn wanderings over the \nheights of Gont, sleeping out with leafless branches for a roof and falling rain for \nhousewalls. That made Ged smile, for he found the thought of Ogion always a comfort \nto him. He fell asleep with a peaceful heart, there in the cold darkness full of the whisper \nof water. At dawn waking he lifted his head; the rain had ceased; he saw, sheltered in the \nfolds of his cloak, a little animal curled up asleep which had crept there for warmth. He \nwondered, seeing it, for it was a rare strange beast, an otak.\nThese creatures are found only on four southern isles of the Archipelago, Roke, \nEnsmer, Pody and Wathort. They are small and sleek, with broad faces, and fur dark \nbrown or brindle, and great bright eyes. Their teeth are cruel and their temper fierce, so \nthey are not made pets of. They have no call or cry or any voice. Ged stroked this one, \nand it woke and yawned, showing a small brown tongue and white teeth, but it was not \nafraid. \"Otak,\" he said, and then remembering the thousand names of beasts he had \nlearned in the Tower he called it by its true name in the Old Speech, \"Hoeg! Do you \nwant to come with me?\"\nThe otak sat itself down on his open hand, and began to wash its fur.\n",

Sometimes \nduring the day it jumped down and darted off into the woods, but it always came back to \nhim, once with a woodmouse it had caught. He laughed and told it to eat the mouse, for \nhe was fasting, this night being the Festival of Sunreturn. So he came in the wet dusk \npast Roke Knoll, and saw bright werelights playing in the rain over the roofs of the \nGreat House, and he entered there and was welcomed by his Masters and companions in \nthe firelit hall.\nIt was like a homecoming to Ged, who had no home to which he could ever \nreturn. He was happy to see so many faces he knew, and happiest to see Vetch come \nforward to greet him with a wide smile on his dark face. He had missed his friend this \nyear more than he knew. Vetch had been made sorcerer this fall and was a prentice no \nmore, but that set no barrier between them. They fell to talking at once, and it seemed to \nGed that he said more to Vetch in that first hour than he had said during the whole long \nyear at the Isolate Tower.\nThe otak still rode his shoulder, nestling in the fold of his hood as they sat at \ndinner at long tables set up for the festival in the Hearth Hall. Vetch marvelled at the \nlittle creature, and once put up his hand to stroke it, but the otak snapped its sharp teeth \nat him. He laughed. \"They say, Sparrowhawk, that a man favored by a wild beast is a \nman to whom the Old Powers of stone and spring will speak in human voice.\"\n\"They say Gontish wizards often keep familiars,\" said Jasper, who sat on the other \nside of Vetch. \"Our Lord Nemmerle has his raven, and songs say the Red Mage of Ark \nled a wild boar on a gold chain. But I never heard of any sorcerer keeping a rat in his \nhood!\"\nAt that they all laughed, and Ged laughed with them. It was a merry night and he \nwas joyful to be there in the warmth and merriment, keeping festival with his \ncompanions. But, like all Jasper ever said to him, the jest set his teeth on edge.\nThat night the Lord of O was a guest of the school, himself a sorcerer of renown. \nHe had been a pupil of the Archmage, and returned sometimes to Roke for the Winter \nFestival or the Long Dance in summer. With him was his lady, slender and young, bright \nas new copper, her black hair crowned with opals. It was seldom that any woman sat in \nthe halls of the Great House, and some of the old Masters looked at her sidelong, \ndisapproving. But the young men looked at her with all their eyes.\n\"For such a one,\" said Vetch to Ged, \"I could work vast enchantments...\" He \nsighed, and laughed.\n\"She's only a woman,\" Ged replied.\n",

But then he too began to look at the Lady of O, wondering \nif indeed this was such mortal beauty as the old tales told of.\nThe Master Chanter had sung the Deed of the Young King, and all together had \nsung the Winter Carol. Now when there was a little pause before they all rose from the \ntables, Jasper got up and went to the table nearest the hearth, where the Archmage and \nthe guests and Masters sat, and he spoke, to the Lady of O. Jasper was no longer a boy \nbut a young man, tall and comely, with his cloak clasped at the neck with silver; for he \nalso had been made sorcerer this year, and the silver clasp was the token of it. The lady \nsmiled at what he said and the opals shone in her black hair, radiant. Then, the Masters \nnodding benign consent, Jasper worked an illusion-charm for her. A white tree he made \nspring up from the stone floor. Its branches touched the high roofbeams of the hall, and \non every twig of every branch a golden apple shone, each a sun, for it was the Year-Tree. \nA bird flew among the branches suddenly, all white with a tail like a fall of snow, and \nthe golden apples dimming turned to seeds, each one a drop of crystal. These falling \nfrom the tree with a sound like rain, all at once there came a sweet fragrance, while the \ntree, swaying, put forth leaves of rosy fire and white flowers like stars. So the illusion \nfaded. The Lady of O cried out with pleasure, and bent her shining head to the young \nsorcerer in praise of his mastery. \"Come with us, live with us in O-tokne - can he not \ncome, my lord?\" she asked, childlike, of her stern husband. But Jasper said only, \"When \nI have learned skills worthy of my Masters here and worthy of your praise, my lady, then \nI will gladly come, and serve you ever gladly.\"\nSo. he pleased all there, except Ged. Ged joined his voice to the praises, but not \nhis heart. \"I could have done better,\" he said to himself, in bitter envy; and all the joy of \nthe evening was darkened for him, after that.\n------\n4 The Loosing of the Shadow\n------\n",

Ged stayed in the Great House, working with the Masters at all \nthe skills practised by sorcerers, those who work magic but carry no staff: windbringing, \nweatherworking, finding and binding, and the arts of spellsmiths and spellwrights, \ntellers, chanters, healalls and herbalists. At night alone in his sleeping-cell, a little ball of \nwerelight burning above the book in place of lamp or candle, he studied the Further \nRunes and the Runes of Ea, which are used in the Great Spells. All these crafts came \neasy to him, and it was rumored among the students that this Master or that had said that \nthe Gontish lad was the quickest student that had ever been at Roke, and tales grew up \nconcerning the otak, which was said to be a disguised spirit who whispered wisdom in \nGed's ear, and it was even said that the Archmage's raven had hailed Ged at his arrival as \n\"Archmage to be.\" Whether or not they believed such stories, and whether or not they \nliked Ged, most of his companions admired him, and were eager to follow him when the \nrare wild mood came over him and he joined them to lead their games on the \nlengthening evenings of spring. But for the most part he was all work and pride and \ntemper, and held himself apart. Among them all, Vetch being absent, he had no friend, \nand never knew he wanted one.\nHe was fifteen, very young to learn any of the High Arts of wizard or mage, those \nwho carry the staff; but he was so quick to learn all the arts of illusion that the Master \nChanger, himself a young man, soon began to teach him apart from the others, and to tell \nhim about the true Spells of Shaping. He explained how, if a thing is really to be \nchanged into another thing, it must be renamed for as long as the spell lasts, and he told \nhow this affects the names and natures of things surrounding the transformed thing. He \nspoke of the perils of changing, above all when the wizard transforms his own shape and \nthus is liable to be caught in his own spell. Little by little, drawn on by the boy's \nsureness of understanding, the young Master began to do more than merely tell him of \nthese mysteries. He taught him first one and then another of the Great Spells of Change, \nand he gave him the Book of Shaping to study. This he did without knowledge of the \nArchmage, and unwisely, yet he meant no harm.\nGed worked also with the Master Summoner now, but that Master was a stern \nman, aged and hardened by the deep and somber wizardry he taught. He dealt with no \nillusion, only true magic, the summoning of such energies as light, and heat, and the \nforce that draws the magnet, and those forces men perceive as weight, form, color, \nsound: real powers, drawn from the immense fathomless energies of the universe, which \nno man's spells or uses could exhaust or unbalance. The weatherworker's and seamaster's \ncalling upon wind and water were crafts already known to his pupils, but it was he who \nshowed them why the true wizard uses such spells only at need, since to summon up \nsuch earthly forces is to change the earth of which they are a part. \"Rain on Roke may be \ndrouth in Osskil,\" he said, \"and a calm in the East Reach may be storm and ruin in the \n",

Once or twice \nGed tried to lead him to talk a little of such mysteries, but the Master was silent, looking \nat him long and grimly, till Ged grew uneasy and said no more.\nSometimes indeed he was uneasy working even such lesser spells as the \nSummoner taught him. There were certain runes on certain pages of the Lore-Book that \nseemed familiar to him, though he did not remember in what book he had ever seen \nthem before. There were certain phrases that must be said in spells of Summoning that \nhe did not like to say. They made him think, for an instant, of shadows in a dark room, of \na shut door and shadows reaching out to him from the corner by the door. Hastily he put \nsuch thoughts or memories aside and went on. These moments of fear and darkness, he \nsaid to himself, were the shadows merely of his ignorance. The more he learned, the less \nhe would have to fear, until finally in his full power as Wizard he needed fear nothing in \nthe world, nothing at all.\nIn the second month of that summer all the school gathered again at the Great \nHouse to celebrate the Moon's Night and the Long Dance, which that year fell together \nas one festival of two nights, which happens but once in fifty-two years. All the first \nnight, the shortest night of full moon of the year, flutes played out in the fields, and the \nnarrow streets of Thwil were full of drums and torches, and the sound of singing went \nout over the moonlit waters of Roke Bay. As the sun rose next morning the Chanters of \nRoke began to sing the long Deed of Erreth-Akbe,which tells how the white towers of \nHavnor were built, and of Erreth-Akbe's journeys from the Old Island, Ea, through all \nthe Archipelago and the Reaches, until at last in the uttermost West Reach on the edge of \nthe Open Sea he met the dragon Orm; and his bones in shattered armor lie among the \ndragon's bones on the shore of lonely Selidor, but his sword set atop the highest tower of \nHavnor still burns red in the sunset above the Inmost Sea. When the chant was finished \nthe Long Dance began. Townsfolk and Masters and students and farmers all together, \nmen and women, danced in the warm dust and dusk down all the roads of Roke to the \nsea-beaches, to the beat of drums and drone of pipes and flutes. Straight out into the sea \nthey danced, under the moon one night past full, and the music was lost in the breakers' \nsound. As the east grew light they came back up the beaches and the roads, the drums \nsilent and only the flutes playing soft and shrill. So it was done on every island of the \nArchipelago that night: one dance, one music binding together the sea-divided lands.\nWhen the Long Dance was over most people slept the day away, and gathered \nagain at evening to eat and drink.

They were all eating and laughing and playing such \ntricks out of pure frolic as might be the marvel of a king's court. One boy had lighted the \ncourt with a hundred stars of werelight, colored like jewels, that swung in a slow netted \nprocession between them and the real stars; and a pair of boys were playing bowls with \nballs of green flame and bowling-pins that leaped and hopped away as the ball came \nnear; and all the while Vetch sat crosslegged, eating roast chicken; up in mid-air. One of \nthe younger boys tried to pull him down to earth, but Vetch merely drifted up a little \nhigher, out of reach, and sat calmly smiling on the air. Now and then he tossed away a \nchicken bone, which turned to an owl and flew hooting among the netted star-lights. Ged \nshot breadcrumb arrows after the owls and brought them down, and when they touched \nthe ground there they lay, bone and crumb, all illusion gone. Ged also tried to join Vetch \nup in the middle of the air, but lacking the key of the spell he had to flap his arms to \nkeep aloft, and they were all laughing at his flights and flaps and bumps. He kept up his \nfoolishness for the laughter's sake, laughing with them, for after those two long nights of \ndance and moonlight and music and magery he was in a fey and wild mood, ready for \nwhatever might come.\nHe came lightly down on his feet just beside Jasper at last, and Jasper, who never \nlaughed aloud, moved away saying, \"The Sparrowhawk that can't fly...\"\n\"Is Jasper a precious stone?\" Ged returned, grinning. \"O jewel among sorcerers, O \nGem of Havnor, sparkle for us!\"\nThe lad that had set the lights dancing sent one down to dance and glitter about \nJasper's head. Not quite as cool as usual, frowning, Jasper brushed the light away and \nsnuffed it out with one gesture. \"I am sick of boys and noise and foolishness,\" he said.\n\"You're getting middle-aged, lad,\" Vetch remarked from above.\n\"If silence and gloom is what you want,\" put in one of the younger boys, \"you \ncould always try the Tower.\"\nGed said to him, \"What is it you want, then, Jasper?\"\n\"I want the company of my equals,\" Jasper said. \"Come on, Vetch. Leave the \nprentices to their toys.\"\nGed turned to face Jasper. \"What do sorcerers have that prentices lack?\" he \ninquired. His voice was quiet, but all the other boys suddenly fell still, for in his tone as \nin Jasper's the spite between them now sounded plain and clear as steel coming out of a \n",

Yet their anger \nwas balked, not cooled. Presently, moving a little aside as if to be heard by Vetch alone, \nJasper spoke, with his cool smile: \"I think you'd better remind your goatherd friend \nagain of the law that protects him.

The younger boys, used to seeing \nhis black temper break out at the least hint of slight or insult, watched him in wonder at \nhis coolness now. Vetch watched him not in wonder, but with growing fear. He tried to \nintervene again, but Jasper said, \"Come, keep out of this, Vetch. What will you do with \nthe chance I give you, Goatherd?

You cannot. You brag and brag-\"\n\"By my name, I will do it!\"\nThey all stood utterly motionless for a moment.\nBreaking away from Vetch who would have held him back by main force, Ged \nstrode out of the courtyard, not looking back. The dancing werelights overhead died out, \nsinking down. Jasper hesitated a second, then followed after Ged.

As they came onto the hillside they thought of how \nthe roots of it were deep, deeper than the sea, reaching down even to the old, blind, \nsecret fires at the world's core. They stopped on the east slope. Stars hung over the black \ngrass above them on the hill's crest. No wind blew.\nGed went a few paces up the slope away from the others and turning said in a \nclear voice, \"Jasper! Whose spirit shall I call?\"\n\"Call whom you like. None will listen to you.\" Jasper's voice shook a little, with \nanger perhaps. Ged answered him softly, mockingly, \"Are you afraid?\"\nHe did not even listen for Jasper's reply, if he made one. He no longer cared about \nJasper. Now that they stood on Roke Knoll, hate and rage were gone, replaced by utter \ncertainty. He need envy no one. He knew that his power, this night, on this dark \nenchanted ground, was greater than it had ever been, filling him till be trembled with the \nsense of strength barely kept in check. He knew now that Jasper was far beneath him, \nhad been sent perhaps only to bring him here tonight, no rival but a mere servant of \nGed's destiny. Under his feet he felt the hillroots going down and down into the dark, \nand over his head he saw the dry, far fires of the stars. Between, all things were his to \norder, to command.

Elfarran I will call, the fair lady of the Deed of Enlad.\"\n\"She died a thousand years ago, her bones lie afar under the Sea of Ea, and maybe \nthere never was such a woman.\"\n\"Do years and distances matter to the dead? Do the Songs lie?\" Ged said with the \nsame gentle mockery, and then saying, \"Watch the air between my hands,\" he turned \naway from the others and stood still.\nIn a great slow gesture he stretched out his arms, the gesture of welcome that \nopens an invocation. He began to speak.\nHe had read the runes of this Spell of Summoning in Ogion's book, two years and \nmore ago, and never since had seen them. In darkness he had read them then. Now in \nthis darkness it was as if he read them again on the page open before him in the night. \nBut now he understood what he read, speaking it aloud word after word, and he saw the \nmarkings of how the spell must be woven with the sound of the voice and the motion of \nbody and hand.\nThe other boys stood watching, not speaking, not moving unless they shivered a \nlittle: for the great spell was beginning to work.

Then he fell forward as if to embrace earth with his outstretched arms, and when \nhe rose he held something dark in his straining hands and arms, something so heavy that \nhe shook with effort getting to his feet. The hot wind whined in the black tossing grasses \non the hill. If the stars shone now none saw them.\nThe words of the enchantment hissed and mumbled on Ged's lips, and then he \ncried out aloud and clearly, \"Elfarran!\"\nAgain he cried the name, \"Elfarran!\"\nThe shapeless mass of darkness he had lifted split apart. It sundered, and a pale \nspindle of light gleamed between his opened arms, a faint oval reaching from the ground \nup to the height of his raised hands. In the oval of light for a moment there moved a \nform, a human shape: a tall woman looking back over her shoulder. Her face was \nbeautiful, and sorrowful, and full of fear.\nOnly for a moment did the spirit glimmer there. Then the sallow oval between \nGed's arms grew bright. It widened and spread, a rent in the darkness of the earth and \nnight, a ripping open of the fabric of the world. Through it blazed a terrible brightness. \nAnd through that bright misshapen breach clambered something like a clot of black \nshadow, quick and hideous, and it leaped straight out at Ged's face.\nStaggering back under the weight of the thing, Ged gave a short, hoarse scream. \nThe little otak watching from Vetch's shoulder, the animal that had no voice, screamed \naloud also and leaped as if to attack.\nGed fell, struggling and writhing, while the bright rip in the world's darkness \nabove him widened and stretched. The boys that watched fled, and Jasper bent down to \nthe ground hiding his eyes from the terrible light. Vetch alone ran forward to his friend. \nSo only he saw the lump of shadow that clung to Ged, tearing at his flesh. It was like a \nblack beast, the size of a young child, though it seemed to swell and shrink; and it had \nno head or face, only the four taloned paws with which it gripped and tore. Vetch sobbed \nwith horror, yet he put out his hands to try to pull the thing away from Ged. Before he \ntouched it, he was bound still, unable to move.\nThe intolerable brightness faded, and slowly the torn edges of the world closed \ntogether.

His \nface was blackened with blood and there were great black stains on his shirt. The little \notak cowered by his shoulder, quivering. And above him stood an old man whose cloak \nglimmered pale in the moonrise: the Archmage Nemmerle.\nThe end of Nemmerle's staff hovered silvery above Ged's breast. Once gently it \ntouched him over the heart, once on the lips, while Nemmerle whispered. Ged stirred, \nand his lips parted gasping for breath. Then the old Archmage lifted the staff, and set it \nto earth, and leaned heavily on it with bowed head, as if he had scarcely strength to \nstand.\nVetch found himself free to move. Looking around, he saw that already others \nwere there, the Masters Summoner and Changer. An act of great wizardry is not worked \nwithout arousing such men, and they had ways of coming very swiftly when need called, \nthough none had been so swift as the Archmage. They now sent for help, and some who \ncame went with the Archmage, while others, Vetch among them, carried Ged to the \nchambers of the Master Herbal.\nAll night long the Summoner stayed on Roke Knoll, keeping watch. Nothing \nstirred there on the hillside where the stuff of the world had been torn open. No shadow \ncame crawling through moonlight seeking the rent through which it might clamber back \ninto its own domain. It had fled from Nemmerle, and from the mighty spell-walls that \nsurround and protect Roke Island, but it was in the world now. In the world, somewhere, \nit hid. If Ged had died that night it might have tried to find the doorway he had opened, \nand follow him into death's realm, or slip back into whatever place it had come from; for \nthis the Summoner waited on Roke Knoll. But Ged lived.\nThey had laid him abed in the healing-chamber, and the Master Herbal tended the \nwounds he had on his face and throat and shoulder. They were deep, ragged, and evil \nwounds. The black blood in them would not stanch, welling out even under the charms \nand the cobweb-wrapped perriot leaves laid upon them. Ged lay blind and dumb in fever \nlike a stick in a slow fire, and there was no spell to cool what burned him.\nNot far away, in the unroofed court where the fountain played, the Archmage lay \nalso unmoving, but cold, very cold: only his eyes lived, watching the fall of moonlit \nwater and the stir of moonlit leaves. Those with him said no spells and worked no \nhealing. Quietly they spoke among themselves from time to time, and then turned again \nto watch their Lord. He lay still, hawk nose and high forehead and white hair bleached \nby moonlight all to the color of bone. To check the ungoverned spell and drive off the \nshadow from Ged, Nemmerle had spent all his power, and with it his bodily strength was \ngone. He lay dying.

When Nemmerle looked up through \nthe leaves of the tree, those with him did not know if he watched the stars of summer \nfading in daybreak, or those other stars, which never set above the hills that see no \ndawn.\nThe raven of Osskil that had been his pet for thirty years was gone. No one had \nseen where it went. \"It flies before him,\" the Master Patterner said, as they kept vigil.\nThe day came warm and clear. The Great House and the streets of Thwil were \nhushed. No voice was raised, until along towards noon iron bells spoke out aloud in the \nChanter's Tower, harshly tolling.\nOn the next day the Nine Masters of Roke gathered in a place somewhere under \nthe dark trees of the Immanent Grove. Even there they set nine walls of silence about \nthem, that no person or power might speak to them or hear them as they chose from \namongst the mages of all Earthsea him who would be the new Archmage. Gensher of \nWay was chosen. A ship was sent forth at once across the Inmost Sea to Way Island to \nbring the Archmage back to Roke. The Master Windkey stood in the stern and raised up \nthe magewind into the sail, and quickly the ship departed, and was gone.\nOf these events Ged knew nothing. For four weeks of that hot summer he lay \nblind, and deaf, and mute, though at times he moaned and cried out like an animal. At \nlast, as the patient crafts of the Master Herbal worked their healing, his wounds began to \nclose and the fever left him. Little by little he seemed to hear again, though he never \nspoke. On a clear day of autumn the Master Herbal opened the shutters of the room \nwhere Ged lay. Since the darkness of that night on Roke Knoll he had known only \ndarkness. Now he saw daylight, and the sun shining. He hid his scarred face in his hands \nand wept.\nStill when winter came he could speak only with a stammering tongue, and the \nMaster Herbal kept him there in the healing-chambers, trying to lead his body and mind \ngradually back to strength. It was early spring when at last the Master released him, \nsending him first to offer his fealty to the Archmage Gensher. For he had not been able \nto join all the others of the School in this duty when Gensher came to Roke.\nNone of his companions had been allowed to visit him in the months of his \nsickness, and now as he passed some of them asked one another, \"Who is that?\" He had \nbeen light and lithe and strong. Now, lamed by pain, he went hesitantly, and did not raise \nhis face, the left side of which was white with scars. He avoided those who knew him \nand those who did not, and made his way straight to the court of the Fountain. There \nwhere once he had awaited Nemmerle, Gensher awaited him.\n",

He was still very slow to find words. \"Am I to leave Roke, my lord?\"\n\"Do you want to leave Roke?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"To stay. To learn. To undo... the evil...\"\n\"Nemmerle himself could not do that. -No, I would not let you go from Roke. \nNothing protects you but the power of the Masters here and the defenses laid upon this \nisland that keep the creatures of evil away.

Assuredly it waits for you. \nHave you seen it since that night?\"\n\"In dreams, lord.\" After a while Ged went on, speaking with pain and shame, \n\"Lord Gensher, I do not know what it was - the thing that came out of the spell and \ncleaved to me-\"\n\"Nor do I know. It has no name. You have great power inborn in you, and you \nused that power wrongly, to work a spell over which you had no control, not knowing \nhow that spell affects the balance of light and dark, life and death, good and evil. And \nyou were moved to do this by pride and by hate.

You will live here, and go on with your training. They tell me you were clever. Go \non and do your work. Do it well. It is all you can do.\"\nSo Gensher ended, and was suddenly gone, as is the way of mages. The fountain \nleaped in the sunlight, and Ged watched it a while and listened to its voice, thinking of \nNemmerle. Once in that court he had felt himself to be a word spoken by the sunlight. \nNow the darkness also had spoken: a word that could not be unsaid.\nHe left the court, going to his old room in the South Tower, which they had kept \nempty for him. He stayed there alone. When the gong called to supper he went, but he \nwould hardly speak to the other lads at the Long Table, or raise his face to them, even \nthose who greeted him most gently. So after a day or two they all left him alone. To be \nalone was his desire, for he feared the evil he might do or say unwittingly.\nNeither Vetch nor Jasper was there, and he did not ask about them. The boys be \nhad led and lorded over were all ahead of him now, because of the months he had lost, \nand that spring and summer he studied with lads younger than himself. Nor did he shine \namong them, for the words of any spell, even the simplest illusion-charm, came halting \nfrom his tongue, and his hands faltered at their craft.\nIn autumn he was to go once again to the Isolate Tower to study with the Master \nNamer. This task which he had once dreaded now pleased him, for silence was what he \nsought, and long learning where no spells were wrought, and where that power which he \nknew was still in him would never be called upon to act.\nThe night before he left for the Tower a visitor came to his room, one wearing a \nbrown travelling-cloak and carrying a staff of oak shod with iron. Ged stood up, at sight \nof the wizard's staff.\n\"Sparrowhawk-\"\nAt the sound of the voice, Ged raised his eyes: it was Vetch standing there, solid \nand foursquare as ever, his black blunt face older but his smile unchanged. On his \nshoulder crouched a little beast, brindle-furred and brighteyed.\n\"He stayed with me while you were sick, and now I'm sorry to part with him. And \nsorrier to part with you, Sparrowhawk. But I'm going home. Here, hoeg! go to your true \nmaster!\" Vetch patted the otak and set it down on the floor. It went and sat on Ged's \npallet, and began to wash its fur with a dry brown tongue like a little leaf. Vetch laughed, \nbut Ged could not smile. He bent down to hide his face, stroking the otak.\n",

He remembered the coldness \nof the mountain spring through which he had walked naked and unnamed. He fell to \nthinking of other bright pools in the River Ar, where he had used to swim; and of Ten \nAlders village under the great slanting forests of the mountain; of the shadows of \nmorning across the dusty village street, the fire leaping under bellows-blast in the \nsmith's smelting-pit on a winter afternoon, the witch's dark fragrant but where the air \nwas heavy with smoke and wreathing spells. He had not thought of these things for a \nlong time. Now they came back to him, on this night he was seventeen years old. All the \nyears and places of his brief broken life came within mind's reach and made a whole \nagain. He knew once more, at last, after this long, bitter, wasted time, who he was and \nwhere he was.\nBut where he must go in the years to come, that he could not see; and he feared to \nsee it.\nNext morning he set out across the island, the otak riding on his shoulder as it had \nused to. This time it took him three days, not two, to walk to the Isolate Tower, and he \nwas bone-weary when he came in sight of the Tower above the spitting, hissing seas of \nthe northern cape. Inside, it was dark as he remembered, and cold as he remembered, \nand Kurremkarmerruk sat on his high seat writing down lists of names. He glanced at \nGed and said without welcome, as if Ged had never been away, \"Go to bed; tired is \nstupid. Tomorrow you may open the Book of the Undertakings of the Makers, learning \nthe names therein.\"\nAt winter's end he returned to the Great House. He was made sorcerer then, and \nthe Archmage Gensher accepted at that time his fealty. Thenceforth he studied the high \narts and enchantments, passing beyond arts of illusion to the works of real magery, \nlearning what he must know to earn his wizard's staff.

Yet \nno ill portents or encounters followed on his working even of the Great Spells of Making \nand Shaping, which are most perilous. He came to wonder at times if the shadow he had \nloosed might have grown weak, or fled somehow out of the world, for it came no more \ninto his dreams. But in his heart he knew such hope was folly.\nFrom the Masters and from ancient lore-books Ged learned what he could about \nsuch beings as this shadow he had loosed; little was there to learn. No such creature was \ndescribed or spoken of directly.\nThere were at best hints here and there in the old books of things that might be \nlike the shadow-beast. It was not a ghost of human man, nor was it a creature of the Old \nPowers of Earth, and yet it seemed it might have some link with these. In the Matter of \nthe Dragons, which Ged read very closely, there was a tale of an ancient Dragonlord \nwho had come under the sway of one of the Old Powers, a speaking stone that lay in a \nfar northern land. \"At the Stone's command,\" said the book, \"he did speak to raise up a \ndead spirit out of the realm of the dead, but his wizardry being bent awry by the Stone's \nwill there came with the dead spirit also a thing not summoned, which did devour him \nout from within and in his shape walked, destroying men.\" But the book did not say \nwhat the thing was, nor did it tell the end of the tale. And the Masters did not know \nwhere such a shadow might come from: from unlife, the Archmage had said; from the \nwrong side of the world, said the Master Changer; and the Master Summoner said, \"I do \nnot know.\" The Summoner had come often to sit with Ged in his illness. He was grim \nand grave as ever, but Ged knew now his compassion, and loved him well. \"I do not \nknow. I know of the thing only this: that only a great power could have summoned up \nsuch a thing, and perhaps only one power - only one voice - your voice. But what in turn \nthat means, I do not know. You will find out. You must find out, or die, and worse than \ndie...\" He spoke softly and his eyes were somber as he looked at Ged. \"You thought, as a \nboy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought, once. So did we all. And the \ntruth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can \nfollow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what \nhe must do...'\nThe Archmage sent Ged, after his eighteenth birthday, to work with the Master \nPatterner. What is learned in the Immanent Grove is not much talked about elsewhere. It \nis said that no spells are worked there, and yet the place itself is an enchantment. \nSometimes the trees of that Grove, are seen, and sometimes they are not seen, and they \nare not always in the same place and part of Roke Island. It is said that the trees of the \nGrove themselves are wise. It is said that the Master Patterner learns his supreme \nmagery there within the Grove, and if ever the trees should die so shall his wisdom die, \nand in those days the waters will rise and drown the islands of Earthsea which Segoy \n",

At the door that gives on \nthe path across the fields to Roke Knoll an old man met him, waiting for him in the \ndoorway. At first Ged did not know him, and then putting his mind to it recalled him as \nthe one who had let him into the School on the day of his coming, five years ago.\nThe old man smiled, greeting him by name, and asked, \"Do you know who I am?\"\nNow Ged had thought before of how it was always said, the Nine Masters of \nRoke, although he knew only eight: Windkey, Hand, Herbal, Chanter, Changer, \nSummoner, Namer, Patterner. It seemed that people spoke of the Archmage as the ninth. \nYet when a new Archmage was chosen, nine Masters met to choose him.\n\"I think you are the Master Doorkeeper,\" said Ged.\n\"I am. Ged, you won entrance to Roke by saying your name. Now you may win \nyour freedom of it by saying mine.\" So said the old man smiling, and waited. Ged stood \ndumb.\nHe knew a thousand ways and crafts and means for finding out names of things \nand of men, of course; such craft was a part of everything he had learned at Roke, for \nwithout it there could be little useful magic done. But to find out the name of a Mage \nand Master was another matter. A mage's name is better hidden than a herring in the sea, \nbetter guarded than a dragon's den. A prying charm will be met with a stronger charm, \nsubtle devices will fail, devious inquiries will be deviously thwarted, and force will be \nturned ruinously back upon itself.\n\"You keep a narrow door, Master,\" said Ged at last. \"I must sit out in the fields \nhere, I think, and fast till I grow thin enough to slip through\"\n\"As long as you like,\" said the Doorkeeper, smiling.\nSo Ged went off a little way and sat down under an alder on the banks of the \nThwilburn, letting his otak run down to play in the stream and hunt the muddy banks for \ncreekcrabs. The sun went down, late and bright, for spring was well along. Lights of \nlantern and werelight gleamed in the windows of the Great House, and down the hill the \nstreets of Thwil town filled with darkness. Owls hooted over the roofs and bats flitted in \nthe dusk air above the stream, and still Ged sat thinking how he might, by force, ruse, or \n",

Yet for all that danger of \nthe tide, every child who can walk can paddle, and has his little rowboat; housewives \nrow across the channel to take a cup of rushwash tea with the neighbor; peddlers call \ntheir wares in rhythm with the stroke of their oars. All roads there are salt water, blocked \nonly by nets strung from house to house across the straits to catch the small fish called \nturbies, the oil of which is the wealth of the Ninety Isles. There are few bridges, and no \ngreat towns. Every islet is thick with farms and fishermen's houses, and these are \ngathered into townships each of ten or twenty islets. One such was Low Torning, the \nwesternmost, looking not on the Inmost Sea but outward to empty ocean, that lonely \ncorner of the Archipelago where only Pendor lies, the dragon-spoiled isle, and beyond it \nthe waters of the West Reach, desolate.\nA house was ready there for the township's new wizard. It stood on a hill among \ngreen fields of barley, sheltered from the west wind by a grove of pendick-trees that now \nwere red with flowers. From the door one looked out on other thatched roofs and groves \nand gardens, and other islands with their roofs and fields and hills, and amongst them all \nthe many bright winding channels of the sea. It was a poor house, windowless, with \nearthen floor, yet a better house than the one Ged was born in. The Isle-Men of Low \nTorning, standing in awe of the wizard from Roke, asked pardon for its humbleness. \"We \nhave no stone to build with,\" said one, \"We are none of us rich, though none starve,\" said \nanother, and a third, \"It will be dry at least, for I saw to the thatching myself, Sir.\" To \nGed it was as good as any palace. He thanked the leaders of the township frankly, so that \nthe eighteen of them went home, each in his own rowboat to his home isle, to tell the \nfishermen and housewives that the new wizard was a strange young grim fellow who \nspoke little, but he spoke fairly, and without pride.\nThere was little cause, perhaps, for pride in this first magistry of Ged's. Wizards \ntrained on Roke went commonly to cities or castles, to serve high lords who held them \nin high honor. These fisherman of Low Torning in the usual way of things would have \nhad among them no more than a witch or a plain sorcerer, to charm the fishing-nets and \nsing over new boats and cure beasts and men of their ailments. But in late years the old \nDragon of Pendor had spawned: nine dragons, it was said, now laired in the ruined \ntowers of the Sealords of Pendor, dragging their scaled bellies up and down the marble \nstairs and through the broken doorways there. Wanting food on that dead isle, they \nwould be flying forth some year when they were grown and hunger came upon them. \nAlready a flight of four had been seen over the southwest shores of Hosk, not alighting \nbut spying out the sheepfolds, barns, and villages. The hunger of a dragon is slow to \nwake, but hard to sate. So the Isle-Men of Low Torning had sent to Roke begging for a \nwizard to protect their folk from what boded over the western horizon, and the \nArchmage had judged their fear well founded.\n",

Will you go?\"\n\"I will go,\" Ged had replied, not from obedience only. Since the night on Roke \nKnoll his desire had turned as much against fame and display as once it had been set on \nthem. Always now he doubted his strength and dreaded the trial of his power. Yet also \nthe talk of dragons drew him with a great curiosity. In Gont there have been no dragons \nfor many hundred years; and no dragon would ever fly within scent or sight or spell of \nRoke, so that there also they are a matter of tales and songs only, things sung of but not \nseen. Ged had learned all he could of dragons at the School, but it is one thing to read \nabout dragons and another to meet them. The chance lay bright before him, and heartily \nhe answered, \"I will go \"\nThe Archmage Gensher had nodded his head, but his look was somber. \"Tell me,\" \nhe said at last, \"do you fear to leave Roke? or are you eager to be gone?\"\n\"Both, my lord.\"\nAgain Gensher nodded. \"I do not know if I do right to send you from your safety \nhere,\" he said very low. \"I cannot see your way. It is all in darkness. And there is a power \nin the North, something that would destroy you, but what it is and where, whether in \nyour past or on your forward way, I cannot tell: it is all shadowed. When the men from \nLow Torning came here, I thought at once of you, for it seemed a safe place and out of \nthe way, where you might have time to gather your strength. But I do not know if any \nplace is safe for you, or where your way goes. I do not want to send you out into the \ndark...\"\nIt seemed a bright enough place to Ged at first, the house under the flowering \ntrees. There he lived, and watched the western sky often, and kept his wizard's ear tuned \nfor the sound of scaly wings. But no dragon came. Ged fished from his jetty, and tended \nhis garden-patch. He spent whole days pondering a page or a line or a word in the Lore-\nBooks he had brought from Roke, sitting out in the summer air under the pendick-trees, \nwhile the otak slept beside him or went hunting mice in the forests of grass and daisies. \nAnd he served the people of Low Torning as healall and weatherworker whenever they \nasked him. It did not enter his head that a wizard might be ashamed to perform such \nsimple crafts, for he had been a witchchild among poorer folk than these. They, however, \nasked little of him, holding him in awe, partly because he was a wizard from the Isle of \nthe Wise, and partly on account of his silence and his scarred face. There was that about \nhim, young as he was, that made men uneasy with him.\nYet he found a friend, a boatmaker who dwelt on the next islet eastward. His name \nwas Pechvarry.

Often Ged and \nPechvarry and his little son Ioeth went out into the channels and lagoons, sailing or \nrowing one boat or another, till Ged was a fair sailor, and the friendship between him \nand Pechvarry was a settled thing.\nAlong in late autumn the boatmaker's son fell sick. The mother sent for, the \nwitchwoman of Tesk Isle, who was a good hand at healing, and all seemed well for a day \nor two.

In the latter months of his own long sickness the Master Herbal had \ntaught him much of the healer's lore, and the first lesson and the last of all that lore was \nthis: Heal the wound and cure the illness, but let the dying spirit go.\nThe mother saw his movement and the meaning of it, and cried out aloud in \n",

Then he had laid \nlittle Ioeth gently down on the pallet, and had risen, and stood silent, staff in hand. All at \nonce he raised the staff high and it blazed with white fire as if he held the lightning-bolt \nin his grip, and all the household things in the hut leaped out strange and vivid in that \nmomentary fire. When their eyes were clear from the dazzlement they saw the young \nman lying huddled forward on the earthen floor, beside the pallet where the child lay \ndead.\nTo Pechvarry it seemed that the wizard also was dead. His wife wept, but he was \nutterly bewildered. But the witch had some hearsay knowledge concerning magery and \nthe ways a true wizard may go, and she saw to it that Ged, cold and lifeless as he lay, \nwas not treated as a dead man but as one sick or tranced. He was carried home, and an \nold woman was left to watch and see whether he slept to wake or slept for ever.\nThe little otak was hiding in the rafters of the house, as it did when strangers \nentered. There it stayed while the rain beat on the walls and the fire sank down and the \nnight wearing slowly along left the old woman nodding beside the hearthpit. Then the \notak crept down and came to Ged where he lay stretched stiff and still upon the bed. It \nbegan to lick his hands and wrists, long and patiently, with its dry leafbrown tongue. \nCrouching beside his head it licked his temple, his scarred cheek, and softly his closed \neyes. And very slowly under that soft touch Ged roused. He woke, not knowing where \nhe had been or where he was or what was the faint grey light in the air about him, which \nwas the light of dawn coming to the world. Then the otak curled up near his shoulder as \nusual, and went to sleep.\nLater, when Ged thought back upon that night, he knew that had none touched \nhim when he lay thus spirit-lost, had none called him back in some way, he might have \nbeen lost for good. It was only the dumb instinctive wisdom of the beast who licks his \nhurt companion to comfort him, and yet in that wisdom Ged saw something akin to his \nown power, something that went as deep as wizardry. From that time forth he believed \nthat the wise man is one who never sets himself apart from other living things, whether \nthey have speech or not, and in later years he strove long to learn what can be learned, in \nsilence, from the eyes of animals, the flight of birds, the great slow gestures of trees.\nHe had now made unscathed, for the first time, that crossing-over and return \nwhich only a wizard can make with open eyes, and which not the greatest mage can \nmake without risk.

In spirit, at the boundary wall \nbetween death and life, it had waited for him these long years. It had found him there at \nlast. It would be on his track now, seeking to draw near to him, to take his strength into \nitself, and suck up his' life, and clothe itself in his flesh.\nSoon after, he dreamed of the thing like a bear with no head or face.

When he woke he \nwas weak and cold, and the scars on his face and shoulder drew and ached.\nNow began a bad time. When he dreamed of the shadow or so much as thought of \nit, he felt always that same cold dread: sense and power drained out of him, leaving him \nstupid and astray. He raged at his cowardice, but that did no good. He sought for some \nprotection, but there was none: the thing was not flesh, not alive, not spirit, unnamed, \nhaving no being but what he himself had given it - a terrible power outside the laws of \nthe sunlit world. All he knew of it was that it was drawn to him and would try to work its \nwill through him, being his creature. But in what form it could come, having no real \nform of its own as yet, and how it would come, and when it would come, this he did not \nknow.\nHe set up what barriers of sorcery he could about his house and about the isle \nwhere he lived. Such spell-walls must be ever renewed, and soon he saw that if he spent \nall his strength on these defenses, he would be of no use to the islanders. What could he \ndo, between two enemies, if a dragon came from Pendor?\nAgain he dreamed, but this time in the dream the shadow was inside his house, \nbeside the door, reaching out to him through the darkness and whispering words he did \nnot understand. He woke in terror, and sent the werelight flaming through the air, \nlighting every corner of the little house till he saw no shadow anywhere. Then he put \nwood on the coals of his firepit, and sat in the firelight hearing the autumn wind \nfingering at the thatch roof and whining in the great bare trees above; and he pondered \nlong. An old anger had awakened in his heart. He would not suffer this helpless waiting, \nthis sitting trapped on a little island muttering useless spells of lock and ward. Yet he \ncould not simply flee the trap: to do so would be to break his trust with the islanders and \nto leave them to the imminent dragon, undefended.

I ask your leave to rid you of the dragon-peril \nfirst, if I can do so.\"\n\"As you will, Sir,\" the Isle-Man said gloomily. All that listened there thought this \na folly or a crazy courage in their young wizard, and with sullen faces they saw him go, \nexpecting no news of him again. Some hinted that he meant merely to sail back by Hosk \nto the Inmost Sea, leaving them in the lurch; others, among them Pechvarry, held that he \nhad gone mad, and sought death.\nFor four generations of men all ships had set their course to keep far from the \nshores of Pendor Island. No mage had ever come to do combat with the dragon there, for \nthe island was on no travelled sea road, and its lords had been pirates, slave-takers, war-\nmakers, hated by all that dwelt in the southwest parts of Earthsea. For this reason none \nhad sought to revenge the Lord of Pendor, after the dragon came suddenly out of the \nwest upon him and his men where they sat feasting in the tower, and smothered them \nwith the flames of his mouth, and drove all the townsfolk screaming into the sea. \nUnavenged, Pendor had been left to the dragon, with all its bones, and towers, and \njewels stolen from long-dead princes of the coasts of Paln and Hosk.\nAll this Ged knew well, and more, for ever since he came to Low Torning he had \nheld in mind and pondered over all he had ever learned, of dragons. As he guided his \nsmall boat westward - not rowing now nor using the seaman's skill Pechvarry had taught \nhim, but sailing wizardly with the magewind in his sail and a spell set on prow and keel \nto keep them true - he watched to see the dead isle rise on the rim of the sea. Speed he \nwanted, and therefore used the magewind, for he feared what was behind him more than \nwhat was before him. But as the day passed, his impatience turned from fear to a kind of \nglad fierceness. At least he sought this danger of his own will; and the nearer he came to \nit the more sure he was that, for this time at least, for this hour perhaps before his death, \nhe was free. The shadow dared not follow him into a dragon's jaws. The waves ran \nwhite-tipped on the grey sea, and grey clouds streamed overhead on the north wind.

Then he summoned the dragon: \n\"Usurper of Pendor, come defend your hoard!\"\nHis voice fell short in the sound of breakers beating on the ashen shores; but \ndragons have keen ears. Presently one flitted up from some roofless ruin of the town like \na vast black bat, thin-winged and spinybacked, and circling into the north wind came \nflying towards Ged. His heart swelled at the sight of the creature that was a myth to his \npeople, and he laughed and shouted, \"Go tell the Old One to come, you wind-worm!\"\nFor this was one of the young dragons, spawned there years ago by a she-dragon \nfrom the West Reach, who had set her clutch of great leathern eggs, as they say she-\ndragons will, in some sunny broken room of the tower and had flown away again, \nleaving the Old Dragon of Pendor to watch the young when they crawled like baneful \nlizards from the shell.\nThe young dragon made no answer. He was not large of his kind, maybe the \nlength of a forty-oared ship, and was worm-thin for all the reach of his black \nmembranous wings. He had not got his growth yet, nor his voice, nor any dragon-\ncunning. Straight at Ged in the small rocking boat he came, opening his long, toothed \njaws as he slid down arrowy from the air: so that all Ged had to do was bind his wings \nand limbs stiff with one sharp spell and send him thus hurtling aside into the sea like a \nstone falling. And the grey sea closed over him.\nTwo dragons like the first rose up from the base of the highest tower. Even as the \nfirst one they came driving straight at Ged, and even so he caught both, hurled both \ndown, and drowned them; and he had not yet lifted up his wizard's staff.\nNow after a little time there came three against him from the island. One of these \nwas much greater, and fire spewed curling from its jaws. Two came flying at him rattling \ntheir wings, but the big one came circling from behind, very swift, to burn him and his \nboat with its breath of fire. No binding spell would catch all three, because two came \nfrom north and one from south. In the instant that he saw this, Ged worked a spell of \nChanging, and between one breath and the next flew up from his boat in dragonform.\nSpreading broad wings and reaching talons out, he met the two head on, withering \nthem with fire, and then turned to the third, who was larger than he and armed also with \nfire. On the wind over the grey waves they doubled, snapped, swooped, lunged, till \nsmoke roiled about them red-lit by the glare of their fiery mouths. Ged flew suddenly \nupward and the other pursued, below him. In midflight the dragon Ged raised wings, \n",

The black wings flurried and black dragon-\nblood dropped in thick drops into the sea. The Pendor dragon tore free and flew low and \nlamely to the island, where it hid, crawling into some well or cavern in the ruined town.\nAt once Ged took his form and place again on the boat, for it was most perilous to \nkeep that dragon-shape longer than need demanded. His hands were black with the \nscalding wormblood, and he was scorched about the head with fire, but this was no \nmatter now. He waited only till he had his breath back and then called, \"Six I have seen, \nfive slain, nine are told of: come out, worms!\"\nNo creature moved nor voice spoke for a long while on the island, but only the \nwaves beat loudly on the shore. Then Ged was aware that the highest tower slowly \nchanged its shape, bulging out on one side as if it grew an arm. He feared dragon-magic, \nfor old dragons are very powerful and guileful in a sorcery like and unlike the sorcery of \nmen: but a moment more and he saw this was no trick of the dragon, but of his own \neyes. What he had taken for a part of the tower was the shoulder of the Dragon of \nPendor as he uncurled his bulk and lifted himself slowly up.\nWhen he was all afoot his scaled head, spikecrowned and triple-tongued, rose \nhigher than the broken tower's height, and his taloned forefeet rested on the rubble of the \ntown below. His scales were grey-black, catching the daylight like broken stone. Lean as \na hound he was and huge as a hill. Ged stared in awe. There was no song or tale could \nprepare the mind for this sight. Almost he stared into the dragon's eyes and was caught, \nfor one cannot look into a dragon's eyes. He glanced away from the oily green gaze that \nwatched him, and held up before him his staff, that looked now like a splinter, like a \ntwig.\n\"Eight sons I had, little wizard,\" said the great dry voice of the dragon. \"Five died, \none dies: enough. You will not win my hoard by killing them.\"\n\"I do not want your hoard.\"\nThe yellow smoke hissed from the dragon's nostrils: that was his laughter.\n\"Would you not like to come ashore and look at it, little wizard? It is worth \nlooking at.\"\n\"No, dragon.\" The kinship of dragons is with wind and fire, and they do not fight \nwillingly over the sea. That had been Ged's advantage so far and he kept it; but the strip \nof seawater between him and the great grey talons did not seem much of an advantage, \nany more.\n",

Although the use of the Old Speech binds a man to truth, this is not so \nwith dragons. It is their own language, and they can lie in it, twisting the true words to \nfalse ends, catching the unwary hearer in a maze of mirrorwords each of which reflects \nthe truth and none of which leads anywhere. So Ged had been warned often, and when \nthe dragon spoke he listened with an untrustful ear, all his doubts ready. But the words \nseemed plain and clear: \"Is it to ask my help that you have come here, little wizard?\"\n\"No, dragon.\"\n\"Yet I could help you. You will need help soon, against that which hunts you in \nthe dark.\"\nGed stood dumb.\n\"What is it that hunts you? Name it to me.\"\n\"If I could name it-\" Ged stopped himself.\nYellow smoke curled above the dragon's long head, from the nostrils that were \ntwo round pits of fire.\n\"If you could name it you could master it, maybe, little wizard. Maybe I could tell \nyou its name, when I see it close by. And it will come close, if you wait about my isle. It \nwill come wherever you come. If you do not want it to come close you must run, and \nrun, and keep running from it. And yet it will follow you. Would you like to know its \nname?\"\nGed stood silent again. How the dragon knew of the shadow he bad loosed, he \ncould not guess, nor how it might know the shadow's name. The Archmage bad said that \nthe shadow had no name. Yet dragons have their own wisdom; and they are an older race \nthan man. Few men can guess what a dragon knows and how he knows it, and those few \nare the Dragonlords. To Ged, only one thing was sure: that, though the dragon might \nwell be speaking truth, though he might indeed be able to tell Ged the nature and name \nof the shadow-thing and so give him power over it - even so, even if he spoke truth, he \ndid so wholly for his own ends.\n\"It is very seldom,\" the young man said at last, \"that dragons ask to do men \nfavors.\"\n",

Dryly he \nspoke: \"I strike no bargains. I take. What have you to offer that I cannot take from you \nwhen I like?\"\n\"Safety. Your safety. Swear that you will never fly eastward of Pendor, and I will \nswear to leave you unharmed.\"\nA grating sound came from the dragon's throat like the noise of an avalanche far \noff, stones falling among mountains. Fire danced along his three-forked tongue. He \nraised himself up higher, looming over the ruins. \"You offer me safety! You threaten me! \nWith what?\"\n\"With your name, Yevaud.\"\nGed's voice shook as he spoke the name, yet he spoke it clear and loud. At the \nsound of it, the old dragon held still, utterly still. A minute went by, and another; and \nthen Ged, standing there in his rocking chip of a boat, smiled. He had staked this venture \nand his life on a guess drawn from old histories of dragon-lore learned on Roke, a guess \nthat this Dragon of Pendor was the same that had spoiled the west of Osskil in the days \nof Elfarran and Morred, and had been driven from Osskill by a wizard, Elt, wise in \nnames. The guess had held.\n\"We are matched, Yevaud. You have the strength: I have your name. Will you \nbargain?\"\nStill the dragon made no reply.\nMany years bad the dragon sprawled on the island where golden breastplates and \nemeralds lay scattered among dust and bricks and bones; he had watched his black \nlizard-brood play among crumbling houses and try their wings from the cliffs; he had \nslept long in the sun, unwaked by voice or sail. He had grown old. It was hard now to \nstir, to face this mage-lad, this frail enemy, at the sight of whose staff Yevaud, the old \ndragon, winced.\n\"You may choose nine stones from my hoard,\" he said at last, his voice hissing \nand whining in his long jaws. \"The best: take your choice.

He fought a moment with sudden, startling hope.\nIt was not his own life that he bargained for. One mastery, and only one, could he \nhold over the dragon. He set hope aside and did what he must do.\n\"That is not what I ask for, Yevaud.\"\nWhen he spoke the dragon's name it was as if he held the huge being on a fine, \nthin leash, tightening it on his throat.

He must run, as the dragon had said; but \nwhere? To Roke, he thought, since there at least he was protected, and might find \ncounsel among the wise.\nFirst, however, he must come to Low Torning once more and tell his tale to the \nIsle-Men. When word went out that he had returned, five days from his setting forth, \nthey and half the people of the township came rowing and running to gather round him, \nand stare at him, and listen. He told his tale, and one man said, \"But who saw this \nwonder of dragons slain and dragons baffled? What if he-\"\n\"Be still!\" the Head Isle-Man said roughly, for he knew, as did most of them, that \na wizard may have subtle ways of telling the truth, and may keep the truth to himself, \nbut that if he says a thing the thing is as he says. For that is his mastery. So they \nwondered, and began to feel that their fear was lifted from them, and then they began to \nrejoice. They pressed round their young wizard and asked for the tale again. More \nislanders came, and asked for it again. By nightfall he no longer had to tell it. They \ncould do it for him, better. Already the village chanters had fitted it to an old tune, and \nwere singing the Song of the Sparrowhawk. Bonfires were burning not only on the isles \nof Low Torning but in townships to the south and east. Fishermen shouted the news \nfrom boat to boat, from isle to isle it went: Evil is averted, the dragons will never come \nfrom Pendor!\nThat night, that one night, was joyous for Ged. No shadow could come near him \nthrough the brightness of those fires of thanksgiving that burned on every hill and beach, \nthrough the circles of laughing dancers that ringed him about, singing his praise, \nswinging their torches in the gusty autumn night so that sparks rose thick and bright and \nbrief upon the wind.\nThe next day he met with Pechvarry, who said, \"I did not know you were so \nmighty, my lord.\" There was fear in that because he had dared make Ged his friend, but \nthere was reproach in it also. Ged had not saved a little child, though he had slain \ndragons. After that, Ged felt afresh the unease and impatience that had driven him to \nPendor, and drove him now from Low Torning.

Always as they rowed on among the craft that \ncrowd the eastern channels of the Ninety Isles, under the windows and balconies of \nhouses that lean out over the water, past the wharves of Nesh, the rainy pastures of \nDromgan, the malodorous oil-sheds of Geath, word of his deed had gone ahead of him. \nThey whistled the Song of the Sparrowhawk as he went by, they vied to have him spend \nthe night and tell his dragon-tale. When at last he came to Serd, the ship's master of \nwhom he asked passage out to Roke bowed as he answered, \"A privilege to me, Lord \nWizard, and an honor to my ship!\"\nSo Ged turned his back on the Ninety Isles; but even as the ship turned from Serd \nInner Port and raised sail, a wind came up hard from the east against her. It was strange, \nfor the wintry sky was clear and the weather had seemed settled mild that morning. It \nwas only thirty miles from Serd to Roke, and they sailed on; and when the wind still \nrose, they still sailed on: The little ship, like most traders of the Inmost Sea, bore the \nhigh fore-and-aft sail that can be turned to catch a headwind, and her master was a \nhandy seaman, proud of his skill. So tacking now north now south they worked \neastward. Clouds and rain came up on the wind, which veered and gusted so wildly that \nthere was considerable danger of the ship jibing. \"Lord Sparrowhawk,\" said the ship's \nmaster to the young man, whom he had beside him in the place of honor in the stern, \nthough small dignity could be kept up under that wind and rain that wet them all to a \nmiserable sleekness in their sodden cloaks- \"Lord Sparrowhawk, might you say a word \nto this wind, maybe?\"\n\"How near are we to Roke?\"\n\"Better than half way. But we've made no headway at all this past hour, Sir.\"\nGed spoke to the wind. It blew less hard, and for a while they went on fairly \nenough. Then sudden great gusts came whistling out of the south, and meeting these \nthey were driven back westward again. The clouds broke and boiled in the sky, and the \nship's master roared out ragefully, \"This fool's gale blows all ways at once! Only a \nmagewind will get us through this weather, Lord.\"\nGed looked glum at that, but the ship and her men were in danger for him, so he \nraised up the magewind into her sail. At once the ship began to cleave straight to the \neast, and the ship's master began to look cheerful again. But little by little, though Ged \nkept up the spell, the magewind slackened, growing feebler, until the ship seemed to \nhang still on the waves for a minute, her sail drooping, amid all the tumult of the rain \nand gale.

It must grope after him through the days and across the seas of the sunlit \nworld, and could take visible shape only in dream and darkness. It had as yet no \nsubstance or being that the light of the sun would shine on; and so it is sung in the Deed \nof Hode, \"Daybreak makes all earth and sea, from shadow brings forth form, driving \ndream to the dark kingdom.\" But if once the shadow caught up with Ged it could draw \nhis power out of him, and take from him the very weight and warmth and life of his \nbody and the will that moved him.\nThat was the doom he saw lying ahead on every road.

Ged went ashore, for it was still \ndaylight, and he roamed the steep streets of the port-town, aimless and brooding.\nOrrimy is an old town, built heavily of stone and brick, walled against the lawless \nlords of the interior of Hosk Island; the warehouses on the docks are like forts, and the \nmerchants' houses are towered and fortified. Yet to Ged wandering through the streets \nthose ponderous mansions seemed like veils, behind which lay an empty dark; and \npeople who passed him, intent on their business, seemed not real men but voiceless \nshadows of men. As the sun set he came down to the wharves again, and even there in \nthe broad red light and wind of the day's end, sea and land alike to him seemed dim and \nsilent.\n\"Where are you bound, Lord Wizard?\"\nSo one hailed him suddenly from behind. Turning he saw a man dressed in grey, \nwho carried a staff of heavy wood that was not a wizard's staff. The stranger's face was \nhidden by his hood from the red light, but Ged felt the unseen eyes meet his. Starting \nback he raised his own yewstaff between him and the stranger.\nMildly the man asked, \"What do you fear?\"\n\"What follows behind me.\"\n\"So? But I'm not your shadow.\"\nGed stood silent. He knew that indeed this man, whatever he was, was not what he \nfeared: he was no shadow or ghost or gebbeth-creature. Amidst the dry silence and \nshadowiness that had come over the world, he even kept a voice and some solidity. He \nput back his hood now. He had a strange, seamed, bald head, a lined face. Though age \nhad not sounded in his voice, he looked to be an old man.\n\"I do not know you,\" said the man in grey, \"yet I think perhaps we do not meet by \nchance. I heard a tale once of a young man, a scarred man, who won through darkness to \ngreat dominion, even to kingship. I do not know if that is your tale. But I will tell you \nthis: go to the Court of the Terrenon, if you need a sword to fight shadows with. A staff \nof yew-wood will not serve your need.\"\nHope and mistrust struggled in Ged's mind as he listened. A wizardly man soon \nlearns that few indeed of his meetings are chance ones, be they for good or for ill.\n\"In what land is the Court of the Terrenon?\"\n\"In Osskill.\"\n",

There was a manner about him that \nhinted of the sorcerer, even of the wizard; and yet boldly as he spoke to Ged, there was a \nqueer beaten look about him, the look almost of a sick man, or a prisoner, or a slave.\n\"You are from Roke,\" he answered. \"The wizards of Roke give a dark name to \nwizardries other than their own.\"\n\"What man are you?\"\n\"A traveller; a trader's agent from Osskil; I am here on business,\" said the man in \ngrey. When Ged asked him no more he quietly bade the young man good night, and \nwent off up the narrow stepped street above the quays.\nGed turned, irresolute whether to heed this sign or not, and looked to the north. \nThe red light was dying out fast from the hills and from the windy sea. Grey dusk came, \nand on its heels the night.\nGed went in sudden decision and haste along the quays to a fisherman who was \nfolding his nets down in his dory, and hailed him: \"Do you know any ship in this port \nbound north -to Semel, or the Enlades?\"\n\"The longship yonder's from Osskil, she might be stopping at the Enlades.\"\nIn the same haste Ged went on to the great ship the fisherman had pointed to, a \nlongship of sixty oars, gaunt as a snake, her high bent prow carven and inlaid with disks \nof loto-shell, her oarport-covers painted red, with the rune Sifl sketched on each in \nblack. A grim, swift ship she looked, and all in sea-trim, with all her crew aboard. Ged \nsought out the ship's master and asked passage to Osskil of him.\n\"Can you pay?\"\n\"I have some skill with winds.\"\n\"I am a weatberworker myself. You have nothing to give? no money?\"\nIn Low Torning the Isle-Men had paid Ged as best they could with the ivory \npieces used by traders in the Archipelago; he would take only ten pieces, though they \nwanted to give him more. He offered these now to the Osskilian, but he shook his head. \n",

Find your bench then,\" said the ship's master, and paid \nhim no more heed.\nSo, laying his staff and his bag of books under the rowers' bench, Ged became for \nten bitter days of winter an oarsman of that Northern ship. They left Orrimy at daybreak, \nand that day Ged thought he could never keep up his work. His left arm was somewhat \nlamed by the old wounds in his shoulder, and all his rowing in the channels about Low \nTorning had not trained him for the relentless pull and pull and pull at the long galley-\noar to the beat of the drum. Each stint at the oars was of two or three hours, and then a \nsecond shift of oarsmen took the benches, but the time of rest seemed only long enough \nfor all Ged's muscles to stiffen, and then it was back to the oars. And the second day of it \nwas worse; but after that he hardened to the labor, and got on well enough.\nThere was no such comradeship among this crew as he had found aboard Shadow \nwhen he first went to Roke. The crewmen of Andradean and Gontish ships are partners \nin the trade, working together for a common profit, whereas traders of Osskil use slaves \nand bondsmen or hire men to row, paying them with small coins of gold. Gold is a great \nthing in Osskil. But it is not a source of good fellowship there, or amongst the dragons, \nwho also prize it highly. Since half this crew were bondsmen, forced to work, the ship's \nofficers were slavemasters, and harsh ones. They never laid their whips on the back of \nan oarsman who worked for pay or passage; but there will not be much friendliness in a \ncrew of whom some are whipped and others are not. Ged's fellows said little to one \nanother, and less to him. They were mostly men from Osskil, speaking not the Hardic \ntongue of the Archipelago but a dialect of their own, and they were dour men, pale-\nskinned with black drooping mustaches and lank hair. Kelub, the red one, was Ged's \nname among them. Though they knew he was a wizard they showed him no regard, but \nrather a kind of cautious spitefulness. And he himself was in no mood for making \nfriends. Even on his bench, caught up in the mighty rhythm of the rowing, one oarsman \namong sixty in a ship racing over void grey seas, he felt himself exposed, defenseless. \nWhen they came into strange ports at nightfall and he rolled himself in his cloak to \nsleep, weary as he was he would dream, wake, dream again: evil dreams, that he could \nnot recall waking, though they seemed to hang about the ship and the men of the ship, so \nthat he mistrusted each one of them.\nAll the Osskilian freemen wore a long knife at the hip, and one day as his oar-shift \nshared their noon meal one of these men asked Ged, \"Are you slave or oathbreaker, \nKelub?\"\n",

Yet the next \nminute Ged saw him fullface, and he looked as usual, so that Ged told himself that what \nhe had seen was his own fear, his own dread reflected in the other's eyes. But that night \nas they lay in port in Esen he dreamed, and Skiorh walked in his dream. Afterwards he \navoided the man as best he could, and it seemed also that Skiorh kept away from him, \nand no more words passed between them.\nThe snow-crowned mountains of Havnor sank away behind them southward, \nblurred by the mists of early winter. They rowed on past the mouth of the Sea of Ea \nwhere long ago Elfarran was drowned, and past the Enlades. They lay two days in port \nat Berila, the City of Ivory, white above its bay in the west of myth-haunted Enlad. At all \nports they came to, the crewmen were kept aboard the ship, and set no foot on land. \nThen as a red sun rose they rowed out on the Osskil Sea, into the northeast winds that \nblow unhindered from the islandless vastness of the North Reach. Through that bitter sea \nthey brought their cargo safe, coming the second day out of Berila into port at Neshum, \nthe trade-city of Eastern Osskil.\nGed saw a low coast lashed by rainy wind, a grey town crouching behind the long \nstone breakwaters that made its harbor, and behind the town treeless hills under a \nsnowdarkened sky. They had come far from the sunlight of the Inmost Sea.\nLongshoremen of the Sea-Guild of Neshum came aboard to unload the cargo - \ngold, silver, jewelry, fine silks and Southern tapestries, such precious stuff as the lords of \nOsskil hoard-and the freemen of the crew were dismissed. Ged stopped one of them to \nask his way; up until now the distrust he felt of all of them had kept him from saying \nwhere he was bound, but now, afoot and alone in a strange land, he must ask for \nguidance. The man went on impatiently saying he did not know, but Skiorh, overhearing, \nsaid, \"The Court of the Terrenon? On the Keksemt Moors.

The little otak would not ride on his \nshoulder, but hid in the pocket of his sheepskin tunic, under his cloak, as was its wont in \ncold weather. The hills stretched out into bleak rolling moorlands as far as the eye could \nsee. They walked in silence and the silence of winter lay on all the land.\n\"How far?\" Ged asked after they had gone some miles, seeing no sight of village \nor farm in any direction, and thinking that they had no food with them. Skiorh turned his \nhead a moment, pulling up his own hood, and said, \"Not far.\"\nIt was an ugly face, pale, coarse, and cruel, but Ged feared no man, though he \nmight fear where such a man would guide him. He nodded, and they went on. Their road \nwas only a scar through the waste of thin snow and leafless bushes. From time to time \nother tracks crossed it or branched from it. Now that the chimney-smoke of Neshum was \nhidden behind the hills in the darkening afternoon there was no sign at all of what way \nthey should go, or had gone. Only the wind blew always from the east. And when they \nhad walked for several hours Ged thought he saw, away off on the hills in the northwest \nwhere their way tended, a tiny scratch against the sky, like a tooth, white. But the light \nof the short day was fading, and on the next rise of the road he could make out the thing, \ntower or tree or whatever, no more clearly than before.\n\"Do we go there?\" be asked, pointing.\nSkiorh made no answer but plodded on, muffled in his coarse cloak with its \npeaked, furred Osskilian hood. Ged strode on beside him. They had come far, and he \nwas drowsy with the steady pace of their walking and with the long weariness of hard \ndays and nights in the ship. It began to seem to him that he had walked forever and \nwould walk forever beside this silent being through a silent darkening land. Caution and \nintention were dulled in him. He walked as in a long, long dream, going no place.\nThe otak stirred in his pocket, and a little vague fear also woke and stirred in his \nmind. He forced himself to speak. \"Darkness comes, and snow. How far, Skiorh?\"\nAfter a pause the other answered, without turning, \"Not far.\"\nBut his voice sounded not like a man's voice, but like a beast, hoarse and lipless, \nthat tries to speak.\nGed stopped. All around stretched empty hills in the late, dusk light. Sparse snow \nwhirled a little falling. \"Skiorh!\" he said, and the other halted, and turned. There was no \nface under the peaked hood.\n",

Nor could he summon any help in \nthis alien land, where nothing and no one was known to him and would come at his call. \nHe stood alone, with nothing between him and his enemy but the staff of yew-wood in \nhis right hand.\nThe thing that had devoured Skiorh's mind and possessed his flesh made the body \ntake a step towards Ged, and the arms came groping out towards him. A rage of horror \nfilled Ged and he swung up and brought down his staff whistling on the hood that hid \nthe shadow-face. Hood and cloak collapsed down nearly to the ground under that fierce \nblow as if there was nothing in them but wind, and then writhing and flapping stood up \nagain. The body of a gebbeth has been drained of true substance and is something like a \nshell or a vapor in the form of a man, an unreal flesh clothing the shadow which is real. \nSo jerking and billowing as if blown on the wind the shadow spread its arms and came \nat Ged, trying to get hold of him as it had held him on Roke Knoll: and if it did it would \ncast aside the husk of Skiorh and enter into Ged, devouring him out from within, owning \nhim, which was its whole desire. Ged struck at it again with his heavy, smoking staff, \nbeating it off, but it came again and he struck again, and then dropped the staff that \nblazed and smouldered, burning his hand. He backed away, then all at once turned and \nran.\nHe ran, and the gebbeth followed a pace behind him, unable to outrun him yet \nnever dropping behind. Ged never looked back. He ran, he ran, through that vast dusk \nland where there was no hiding place. Once the gebbetb in its hoarse whistling voice \ncalled him again by name, but though it had taken his wizard's power thus, it had no \npower over his body's strength, and could not make him stop. He ran.\nNight thickened about the hunter and the hunted, and snow blew flne across the \npath that Ged could no longer see. The pulse hammered in his eyes, the breath burned in \nhis throat, he was no longer really running but stumbling and staggering ahead: and yet \nthe tireless pursuer seemed unable to catch up, coming always just behind him. It had \nbegun to whisper and mumble at him, calling to him, and he knew that all his life that \nwhispering had been in his ears, just under the threshold of hearing, but now he could \nhear it, and he must yield, he must give in, he must stop. Yet he labored on, struggling up \na long, dim slope. He thought there was a light somewhere before him, and he thought \nhe heard a voice in front of him, above him somewhere, calling, \"Come! Come!\"\nHe tried to answer but be had no voice. The pale light grew certain, shining \nthrough a gateway straight before him: he could not see the walls, but he saw the gate. \n",

He followed her.\nHis room was high up indeed in the tower that rose like a sharp tooth from its \nhilltop. Down winding stairs of marble he followed Serret, through rich rooms and halls, \npast high windows that looked north, west, south, east over the low brown hills that went \non, houseless and treeless and changeless, clear to the sunwashed winter sky. Only far to \nthe north small white peaks stood sharp against the blue, and southward one could guess \nthe shining of the sea.\nServants opened doors and stood aside for Ged and the lady; pale, dour Osskilians \nthey were all. She was light of skin, but unlike them she spoke Hardic well, even, it \nseemed to Ged, with the accent of Gont. Later that day she brought him before her \nhusband Benderesk, Lord of the Terrenon.

Geds mind never seemed quite to clear. He could not see things plainly. \nHe had come to this tower-keep by chance, and yet the chance was all design; or he had \ncome by design and yet all the design had merely chanced to come about. He had set out \nnorthward; a stranger in Orrimy had told him to seek help here; an Osskilian ship had \nbeen waiting for him; Skiorh had guided him. How much of this was the work of the \nshadow that hunted him? Or was none of it; had he and his hunter both been drawn here \nby some other power, he following that lure and the shadow following him, and seizing \non Skiorh for its weapon when the moment came? That must be it, for certainly the \nshadow was, as Serret had said, barred from the Court of the Terrenon. He had felt no \nsign or threat of its lurking presence since he wakened in the tower. But what then had \nbrought him here? For this was no place one came to by chance; even in the dullness of \nhis thoughts he began to see that. No other stranger came to these gates. The tower stood \naloof and remote, its back turned on the way to Neshum that was the nearest town. No \nman came to the keep, none left it.

In his \nmind all the Masters of Roke gathered, Gensher the Archmage frowning in their midst, \nand Nemmerle was with them, and Ogion, and even the witch who had taught him his \nfirst spell: all of them gazed at him and he knew he had failed their trust in him.

There was no merriment in the Lady of the Keep, she never laughed though she \noften smiled; yet she could put Ged at ease almost with one smile.

Before long they met every day to talk, long, quietly, \nidly, a little apart from the serving-women who always accompanied Serret, by the \nfireplace or at the window of the high rooms of the tower.\nThe old lord kept mostly in his own apartments, coming forth mornings to pace up \nand down the snowy inner courtyards of the castle-keep like an old sorcerer who has \nbeen brewing spells all night.

She was like a white deer caged, like a white bird wingclipped, like a silver ring on \nan old man's finger. She was an item of Benderesk's hoard. When the lord of the keep \nleft them Ged stayed with her, trying to cheer her solitude as she had cheered his.\n\"What is this jewel that gives your keep its name?\" he asked her as they sat \ntalking over their emptied gold plates and gold goblets in the carvernous, candlelit \ndining-hall.\n\"You have not beard of it?

Come, would you like to see it?\"\nShe smiled, with a look of mockery and daring, as if a little afraid of what she did, \nand led the young man from the hall, out through the narrow corridors of the base of the \ntower, and down stairs underground to a locked door he had not seen before. This she \nunlocked with a silver key, looking up at Ged with that same smile as she did so, as if \nshe dared him to come on with her. Beyond the door was a short passage and a second \ndoor, which she unlocked with a gold key, and beyond that again a third door, which she \nunlocked with one of the Great Words of unbinding. Within that last door her candle \nshowed them a small room like a dungeon-cell: floor, walls, ceiling all rough stone, \nunfurnished, blank.\n\"Do you see it?\" Serret asked.\nAs Ged looked round the room his wizard's eye caught one stone of those that \nmade the floor. It was rough and dank as the rest, a heavy unshapen paving-stone: yet he \nfelt the power of it as if it spoke to him aloud. And his breath caught in his throat, and a \nsickness came over him for a moment. This was the foundingstone of the tower. This \nwas the central place, and it was cold, bitter cold; nothing could ever warm the little \nroom. This was a very ancient thing: an old and terrible spirit was prisoned in that block \nof stone. He did not answer Serret yes or no, but stood still, and presently, with a quick \ncurious glance at him, she pointed out the stone. \"That is the Terrenon. Do you wonder \nthat we keep so precious a jewel locked away in our deepest boardroom?\"\nStill Ged did not answer, but stood dumb and wary. She might almost have been \ntesting him; but he thought she had no notion of the stone's nature, to speak of it so \nlightly. She did not know enough of it to fear it. \"Tell me of its powers,\" he said at last.\n\"It was made before Segoy raised the islands of the world from the Open Sea. It \nwas made when the world itself was made, and will endure until the end of the world. \nTime is nothing to it. If you lay your hand upon it and ask a question of it, it will answer, \naccording to the power that is in you. It has a voice, if you know how to listen. It will \nspeak of things that were, and are, and will be. It told of your coming, long before you \ncame to this land. Will you ask a question of it now?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"It will answer you.\"\n\"There is no question I would ask it\"\n",

I do not \nknow what they told you of it when you came here. But you who are young and gentle-\nhearted should never touch the thing, or even look on it. It will not work you well.\"\n\"I have touched it. I have spoken to it, and heard it speak. It does me no harm.\"\nShe turned away and they went out through the doors and passages till in the \ntorchlight of the broad stairs of the tower she blew out her candle. They parted with few \nwords.\nThat night Ged slept little. It was not the thought of the shadow that kept him \nawake; rather that thought was almost driven from his mind by the image, ever \nreturning, of the Stone on which this tower was founded, and by the vision of Serret's \nface bright and shadowy in the candlelight, turned to him. Again and again he felt her \neyes on him, and tried to decide what look had come into those eyes when he refused to \ntouch the Stone, whether it had been disdain or hurt. When he lay down to sleep at last \nthe silken sheets of the bed were cold as ice, and ever he wakened in the dark thinking of \nthe Stone and of Serret's eyes.\nNext day he found her in the curving hall of grey marble, lit now by the westering \nsun, where often she spent the afternoon at games or at the weaving-loom with her \nmaids. He said to her, \"Lady Serret, I affronted you. I am sorry for it.\"\n\"No,\" she said musingly, and again, \"No ....\" She sent away the serving-women \nwho were with her, and when they were alone she turned to Ged. \"My guest, my friend,\" \nshe said, \"you are very clear-sighted, but perhaps you do not see all that is to be seen.

It is why you are here now.\"\n\"I do not understand.\"\n\"That is because my lord Benderesk has not been wholly frank with you. I will be \nfrank. Come, sit by me here.\"\nHe sat down beside her on the deep, cushioned window-ledge. The dying sunlight \ncame level through the window, flooding them with a radiance in which there was no \nwarmth; on the moorlands below, already sinking into shadow, last night's snow lay \nunmelted, a dull white pall over the earth.\nShe spoke now very softly. \"Benderesk is Lord and Inheritor of the Terrenon, but \nhe cannot use the thing, he cannot make it wholly serve his will.

As much of that, as little of that \nas you choose, is yours for the asking.\"\nOnce more she lifted her strange bright eyes to him, and her gaze pierced him so \nthat he trembled as if with cold. Yet there was fear in her face, as if she sought his help \nbut was too proud to ask it. Ged was bewildered. She had put her hand on his as she \nspoke; its touch was light, it looked narrow and fair on his dark, strong hand. He said, \npleading, \"Serret!

He looked down at Serret. \"It is light that \ndefeats the dark,\" he said stammering,- \"light.\"\nAs he spoke be saw, as plainly as if his own words were the light that showed him, \nhow indeed he had been drawn here, lured here, how they had used his fear to lead him \non, and how they would, once they had him, have kept him.

Ged stepped forward and struck the lord's hands \ndown with his own, saying as he did so only one short word.

She was not less beautiful in the drear light of the moors, but \nthere was a fierce witch-look to her beauty; and Ged knew her at last - the daughter of \nthe Lord of the Re Albi, daughter of a sorceress of Osskil, who had mocked him in the \ngreen meadows above Ogion's house, long ago, and had sent him to read that spell \nwhich loosed the shadow. But he spent small thought on this, for he was looking about \nhim now with every sense alert, looking for that enemy, the shadow, which would be \nwaiting for him somewhere outside the magic walls. It might be gebbeth still, clothed in \nSkiorh's death, or it might be hidden in the gathering darkness, waiting to seize him and \nmerge its shapelessness with his living flesh. He sensed its nearness, yet did not see it. \nBut as he looked he saw some small dark thing half buried in snow, a few paces from the \ngate. He stooped, and then softly picked it up in his two hands. It was the otak, its fine \nshort fur all clogged with blood and its small body light and stiff and cold in his hands.\n\"Change yourself! Change yourself, they are coming!\" Serret shrieked, seizing his \narm and pointing to the tower that stood behind them like a tall white tooth in the dusk. \nFrom slit windows near its base dark creatures were creeping forth, flapping long wings, \nslowly beating and circling up over the walls towards Ged and Serret where they stood \non the hill-side, unprotected. The rattling whisper they had heard inside the keep had \ngrown louder, a tremor and moaning in the earth under their feet.\nAnger welled up in Ged's heart, a hot rage of hate against all the cruel deathly \nthings that tricked him, trapped him, hunted him down. \"Change yourself!\" Serret \nscreamed at him, and she with a quick-gasped spell shrank into a grey gull, and flew. \nBut Ged stooped and plucked a blade of wild grass that poked up dry and frail out of the \nsnow where the otak had lain dead. This blade he held up, and as he spoke aloud to it in \nthe True Speech it lengthened, and thickened, and when he was done he held a great \nstaff, a wizard's staff, in his hand. No banefire burned red along it when the black, \nflapping creatures from the Court of the Terrenon swooped over him and he struck their \nwings with it: it blazed only with the white magefire that does not burn but drives away \nthe dark.\nThe creatures returned to the attack: botched beasts, belonging to ages before bird \nor dragon or man, long since forgotten by the daylight but recalled by the ancient, \nmalign, unforgetful power of the Stone. They harried Ged, swooping at him. He felt the \nscythe-sweep of their talons about him and sickened in their dead stench. Fiercely he \nparried and struck, fighting them off with the fiery staff that was made of his anger and a \nblade of wild grass. And suddenly they all rose up like ravens frightened from carrion \nand wheeled away, flapping, silent, in the direction that Serret in her gull-shape had \nflown. Their vast wings seemed slow, but they flew fast, each downbeat driving them \nmightily through the air. No gull could long outmatch that heavy speed.\nQuick as he had once done at Roke, Ged took the shape of a great hawk: not the \n",

Beyond that black clot the sea lay, pale \nwith last ashy gleam of day. Swift and straight the hawk-Ged shot towards the creatures \nof the Stone, and they scattered as he came amongst them as waterdrops scatter from a \ncast pebble. But they had caught their prey. Blood was on the beak of this one and white \nfeathers stuck to the claws of another, and no gull skimmed beyond them over the pallid \nsea.\nAlready they were turning on Ged again, coming quick and ungainly with iron \nbeaks stretched out agape. He, wheeling once above them, screamed the hawk's scream \nof defiant rage, and then shot on across the low beaches of Osskil, out over the breakers \nof the sea.\nThe creatures of the Stone circled a while croaking, and one by one beat back \nponderously inland over the moors.

Ogion who spoke to spiders on their webs and had been seen to \ngreet trees courteously never said a word to the Lord of the Isle, who went away \ndiscontented. There was perhaps some discontent or unease also in Ogion's mind, for he \nhad spent all summer and autumn alone up on the mountain, and only now near \nSunretum was come back to his hearthside.\nThe morning after his return he rose late, and wanting a cup of rushwash tea he \nwent out to fetch water from the spring that ran a little way down the hillside from his \nhouse. The margins of the spring's small lively pool were frozen, and the sere moss \namong the rocks was traced with flowers of frost. It was broad daylight, but the sun \nwould not clear the mighty shoulder of the mountain for an hour yet: all western Gont, \nfrom sea-beaches to the peak, was sunless, silent, and clear in the winter morning.

Ogion was silent a minute. \"I named you \nonce, I think,\" he said, and then strode to his house and entered, bearing the bird still on \nhis wrist. He made the hawk stand on the hearth in the fire's heat, and offered it water. It \nwould not drink.

He had said no word to him, knowing that Ged had no \nhuman speech in him now.\nAs a boy, Ogion like all boys had thought it would be a very pleasant game to take \nby art-magic whatever shape one liked, man or beast, tree or cloud, and so to play at a \nthousand beings. But as a wizard he had learned the price of the game, which is the peril \nof losing one's self, playing away the truth. The longer a man stays in a form not his \nown, the greater this peril. Every prentice-sorcerer learns the tale of the wizard Bordger \nof Way, who delighted in taking bear's shape, and did so more and more often until the \nbear grew in him and the man died away, and he became a bear, and killed his own little \nson in the forests, and was hunted down and slain. And no one knows how many of the \ndolphins that leap in the waters of the Inmost Sea were men once, wise men, who forgot \ntheir wisdom and their name in the joy of the restless sea.\nGed had taken hawk-shape in fierce distress and rage, and when he flew from \nOsskil there had been but one thought in his mind: to outfly both Stone and shadow, to \nescape the cold treacherous lands, to go home. The falcon's anger and wildness were like \nhis own, and had become his own, and his will to fly had become the falcon's will. Thus \nhe had passed over Enlad, stooping down to drink at a lonely forest pool, but on the \nwing again at once, driven by fear of the shadow that came behind him.

When they had done and had set the room \nstraight, Ogion spoke.\n\"Those are bitter scars you bear, lad,\" he said.\n\"I, have no strength against the thing,\" Ged answered.\nOgion shook his head but said no more for a time. At length, \"Strange,\" he said: \n\"You had strength enough to outspell a sorcerer in his own domain, there in Osskil. You \nhad strength enough to withstand the lures and fend off the attack of the servants of an \nOld Power of Earth. And at Pendor you had strength enough to stand up to a dragon.\"\n\"It was luck I had in Osskil, not strength,\" Ged replied, and he shivered again as \nhe thought of the dreamlike deathly cold of the Court of the Terrenon. \"As for the \ndragon, I knew his name.

All its desire is to meet me face to face. And twice it \nhas done so, and twice defeated me.\"\n\"Third time is the charm,\" said Ogion.\nGed paced the room up and down, from fireside to door, from door to fireside. \n\"And if it defeats me wholly,\" he said, arguing perhaps with Ogion perhaps with himself, \n\"it will take my knowledge and my power, and use them. It threatens only me, now. But \nif it enters into me and possesses me, it will work great evil through me.\"\n\"That is true. If it defeats you.\"\n\"Yet if I run again, it will as surely find me again... And all my strength is spent in \nthe running.\" Ged paced on a while, and then suddenly turned, and kneeling down \nbefore the mage he said, \"I have walked with great wizards and have lived on the Isle of \nthe Wise, but you are my true master, Ogion.\" He spoke with love, and with a somber \njoy.\n\"Good,\" said Ogion. \"Now you know it. Better now than never.

Watch the kettle for me, lad.\"\nWhen he came back in, all snow-powdered and stamping snow from his goatskin \nboots, he carried a long, rough shaft of yew-wood. All the end of the short afternoon, \nand again after their supper, he sat working by lampfire on the shaft with knife and \nrubbing-stone and spell-craft. Many times he passed his hands along the wood as if \nseeking any flaw. Often as he worked he sang softly. Ged, still weary, listened, and as he \ngrew sleepy he thought himself a child in the witch's but in Ten Alders village, on a \nsnowy night in the firelit dark, the air heavy with herb-scent and smoke, and his mind all \nadrift on dreams as he listened to the long soft singing of spells and deeds of heroes who \nfought against dark powers and won, or lost, on distant islands long ago.\n\"There,\" said Ogion, and handed the finished staff to him. \"The Archmage gave \nyou yew-wood, a good choice and I kept to it.

Only he had left in wizardly \nfashion a message of silver-scrawled runes on the hearthstone, that faded even as Ogion \nread them: \"Master, I go hunting.\"\n------\n8 Hunting\n------\nGed had set off down the road from Re Albi in the winter dark before sunrise, and \nbefore noon he came to the Port of Gont. Ogion had given him decent Gontish leggings \nand shirt and vest of leather and linen to replace his Osskilian finery, but Ged had kept \nfor his winter journey the lordly cloak lined with pellawi-fur. So cloaked, empty-handed \nbut for the dark staff that matched his height, he came to the Land Gate, and the soldiers \nlounging against the carven dragons there did not have to look twice at him to see the \nwizard. They drew aside their lances and let him enter without question, and watched \nhim as he went on down the street.\nOn the quays and in the House of the Sea-Guild he asked of ships that might be \ngoing out north or west to Enlad, Andrad, Oranea.

He sat a while with those longshoremen, shipwrights, and \nweatherworkers, taking pleasure in their slow, sparse conversation, their grumbling \nGontish speech.

He set out walking along the bay shore till he came to the first of the small \nvillages that lie north of the City of Gont, and there he asked among the fishermen till he \nfound one that had a boat to sell.\nThe fisherman was a dour old man. His boat, twelve foot long and clinker-built, \nwas so warped and sprung as to be scarce seaworthy, yet he asked a high price for her: \nthe spell of sea-safety for a year laid on his own boat, himself, and his son. For Gontish \nfishermen fear nothing, not even wizards, only the sea.\nThat spell of sea-safety which they set much store by in the Northern Archipelago \nnever saved a man from stormwind or storm-wave, but, cast by one who knows the local \nseas and the ways of a boat and the skills of the sailor, it weaves some daily safety about \nthe fisherman. Ged made the charm well and honestly, working on it all that night and \nthe next day, omitting nothing, sure and patient, though all the while his mind was \nstrained with fear and his thoughts went on dark paths seeking to imagine how the \nshadow would appear to him next, and how soon, and where. When the spell was made \nwhole and cast, he was very weary. He slept that night in the fisherman's but in a whale-\ngut hammock, and got up at dawn smelling like a dried herring, and went down to the \ncove under Cutnorth Cliff where his new boat lay.\nHe pushed it into the quiet water by the landing, and water began to well softly \ninto it at once. Stepping into the boat light as a cat Ged set straight the warped boards \nand rotten pegs, working both with tools and incantations, as he had used to do with \nPechvarry in Low Torning. The people of the village gathered in silence, not too close, \nto watch his quick hands and listen to his soft voice. This job too he did well and \npatiently until it was done and the boat was sealed and sound. Then he set up his staff \nthat Ogion had made him for a mast, stayed it with spells, and fixed across it a yard of \nsound wood. Downward from this yard he wove on the wind's loom a sail of spells, a \nsquare sail white as the snows on Gont peak above. At this the women watching sighed \nwith envy. Then standing by the mast Ged raised up the magewind lightly. The boat \nmoved out upon the water, turning towards the Armed Cliffs across the great bay. When \nthe silent watching fishermen saw that leaky rowboat slip out under sail as quick and \nneat as a sandpiper taking wing, then they raised a cheer, grinning and stamping in the \ncold wind on the beach; and Ged looking back a moment saw them there cheering him \non, under the dark jagged bulk of Cutnorth Cliff, above which the snowy fields of the \nMountain rose up into cloud.\nHe sailed across the bay and out between the Armed Cliffs onto the Gontish Sea, \nthere setting his course northwestwards to pass north of Oranea, returning as he had \ncome. He had no plan or strategy in this but the retracing of his course. Following his \nfalcon-flight across the days and winds from Osskil, the shadow might wander or might \n",

But unless it had withdrawn again wholly into the \ndream-realm, it should not miss Ged coming openly, over open sea, to meet it.\nOn the sea he wished to meet it, if meet it he must. He was not sure why this was, \nyet he had a terror of meeting the thing again on dry land. Out of the sea there rise \nstorms and monsters, but no evil powers: evil is of earth. And there is no sea, no running \nof river or spring, in the dark land where once Ged had gone. Death is the dry place. \nThough the sea itself was a danger to him in the hard weather of the season, that danger \nand change and instability seemed to him a defense and chance. And when he met the \nshadow in this final end of his folly, he thought, maybe at least he could grip the thing \neven as it gripped him, and drag it with the weight of his body and the weight of his own \ndeath down into the darkness of the deep sea, from which, so held, it might not rise \nagain. So at least his death would put an end to the evil he had loosed by living.\nHe sailed a rough chopping sea above which clouds drooped and drifted in vast \nmournful veils. He raised no magewind now but used the world's wind, which blew keen \nfrom the northwest; and so long as he maintained the substance of his spell-woven sail \noften with a whispered word, the sail itself set and turned itself to catch the wind. Had \nhe not used that magic he would have been hard put to keep the crank little boat on such \na course, on that rough sea. On he went, and kept keen look-out on all sides. The \nfisherman's wife had given him two loaves of bread and a jar of water, and after some \nhours, when he was first in sight of Kameber Rock, the only isle between Gont and \nOranea, he ate and drank, and thought gratefully of the silent Gontishwoman who had \ngiven him the food. On past the dim glimpse of land he sailed, tacking more westerly \nnow, in a faint dank drizzle that over land might be a light snow. There was no sound at \nall but the small creaking of the boat and light slap of waves on her bow. No boat or bird \nwent by. Nothing moved but the ever-moving water and the drifting clouds, the clouds \nthat he remembered dimly as flowing all about him as he, a falcon, flew east on this \nsame course he now followed to the west; and he had looked down on the grey sea then \nas now he looked up at the grey air.\nNothing was ahead when he looked around. He stood up, chilled, weary of this \ngazing and peering into empty murk. \"Come then,\" he muttered, \"come on, what do you \nwait for, Shadow?\" There was no answer,  no darker motion among the dark mists and \nwaves. Yet he knew more and more surely now that the thing was not far off, seeking \nblindly down his cold trail. And all at once he shouted out aloud, \"I am here, I Ged the \nSparrowhawk, and I summon my shadow!\"\nThe boat creaked, the waves lisped, the wind hissed a little on the white sail. The \nmoments went by. Still Ged waited, one hand on the yew-wood mast of his boat, staring \ninto the icy drizzle that slowly drove in ragged lines across the sea from the north. The \nmoments went by. Then, far off in the rain over the water, he saw the shadow coming.\n",

In its pursuit of Ged and in its struggle with him on the moors it had drawn \npower from him, sucking it into itself: and it may be that his summoning of it, aloud in \nthe light of day, had given to it or forced upon it some form and semblance. Certainly it \nhad now some likeness to a man, though being shadow it cast no shadow. So it came \nover the sea, out of the jaws of Enlad towards Gont, a dim ill-made thing pacing uneasy \non the waves, peering down the wind as it came; and the cold rain blew through it.\nBecause it was half blinded by the day, and because he had called it, Ged saw it \nbefore it saw him. he knew it, as it knew him, among all beings, all shadows.\nIn the terrible solitude of the winter sea Ged stood and saw the thing he feared. \nThe wind seemed to blow it farther from the boat, and the waves ran under it \nbewildering his eye, and ever and again it seemed closer to him. He could not tell if it \nmoved or not. It had seen him, now. Though there was nothing a his mind but horror and \nfear of its touch, the cold black pain that drained his life away, yet he waited, unmoving. \nThen all at once speaking aloud he called the magewind strong and sudden into his \nwhite sail, and his boat leapt across the grey waves straight at the lowering thing that \nhung upon the wind.\nIn utter silence the shadow, wavering, turned and fled.\nUpwind it went, northward.

And the young man yelled to his boat, to \nthe sail and the wind and the waves ahead, as a hunter yells to his bounds when the wolf \nruns in plain sight before them, and he brought into that spell-woven sail a wind that \nwould have split any sail of cloth and that drove his boat over the sea like a scud of \nblown foam, closer always to the thing that fled.\nNow the shadow turned, making a half-circle, and appearing all at once more \nloose and dim, less like a man more like mere smoke blowing on the wind, it doubled \nback and ran downwind with the gale, as if it made for Gont.\nWith hand and spell Ged turned his boat, and it leaped like a dolphin from the \nwater, rolling, in that quick turn. Faster than before he followed, but the shadow grew \never fainter to his eyes. Rain, mixed with sleet and snow, came stinging across his back \nand his left cheek, and he could not see more than a hundred yards ahead. Before long, \nas the storm grew heavier, the shadow was lost to sight. Yet Ged was sure of its track as \nif he followed a beast's track over snow, instead of a wraith fleeing over water.

Ged knew that at the great pace he had gone these past hours he must be \nsouth of Gont, heading past it towards Spevy or Torheven, or even past these islands out \ninto the open Reach. He could not tell. He did not care. He hunted, he followed, and fear \nran before him.\nAll at once he saw the shadow for a moment not far from him. The world's wind \nhad been sinking, and the driving sleet of the storm had given way to a chill, ragged, \nthickening mist. Through this mist he glimpsed the shadow, fleeing somewhat to the \nright of his course. He spoke to wind and sail and turned the tiller and pursued, though \nagain it was a blind pursuit: the fog thickened fast, boiling and tattering where it met \nwith the spellwind, closing down all round the boat, a featureless pallor that deadened \nlight and sight. Even as Ged spoke the first word of a clearing-charm, he saw the shadow \nagain, still to the right of his course but very near, and going slowly. The fog blew \nthrough the faceless vagueness of its head, yet it was shaped like a man, only deformed \nand changing, like a man's shadow. Ged veered the boat once more, thinking be had run \nhis enemy to ground: in that instant it vanished, and it was his boat that ran aground, \nsmashing up on shoal rocks that the blowing mist had hidden from his sight. He was \npitched nearly out, but grabbed hold on the mast-staff before the next breaker struck. \nThis was a great wave, which threw the little boat up out of water and brought her down \non a rock, as a man might lift up and crush a snail's shell.\nStout and wizardly was the staff Ogion had shaped. It did not break, and buoyant \nas a dry log it rode the water. Still grasping it Ged was pulled back as the breakers \nstreamed back from the shoal, so that he was in deep water and saved, till the next wave, \nfrom battering on the rocks. Salt-blinded and choked, he tried to keep his head up and to \nfight the enormous pull of the sea. There was sand beach a little aside of the rocks, be \nglimpsed this a couple of times as he tried to swim free of the rising of the next breaker. \nWith all his strength and with the staff's power aiding him he struggled to make for that \nbeach. He got no nearer. The surge and recoil of the swells tossed him back and forth \nlike a rag, and the cold of the deep sea drew warmth fast from his body, weakening him \ntill he could not move his arms. He had lost sight of rocks and beach alike, and did not \nknow what way he faced. There was only a tumult of water around him, under him, over \nhim, blinding him, strangling him, drowning him.\nA wave swelling in under the ragged fog took him and rolled him over and over \nand flung him up like a stick of driftwood on the sand.\nThere he lay.

He got up on hands and knees, and began slowly \ncrawling up the beach, away from the water's edge. It was black night now, but he \nwhispered to the staff, and a little werelight clung about it. With this to guide him he \nstruggled forward, little by little, up toward the dunes. He was so beaten and broken and \ncold that this crawling through the wet sand in the whistling, sea-thundering dark was \nthe hardest thing he had ever had to do. And once or twice it seemed to him that the \ngreat noise of the sea and the wind all died away and the wet sand turned to dust under \nhis hands, and he felt the unmoving gaze of strange stars on his back: but he did not lift \nhis head, and he crawled on, and after a while he heard his own gasping breath, and felt \nthe bitter wind beat the rain against his face.\nThe moving brought a little warmth back into him at last, and after he had crept up \ninto the dunes, where the gusts of rainy wind came less hard, he managed to get up on \nhis feet. He spoke a stronger light out of the staff, for the world was utterly black, and \nthen leaning on the staff he went on, stumbling and halting, half a mile or so inland. \nThen on the rise of a dune he heard the sea, louder again, not behind him but in front: \nthe dunes sloped down again to another shore. This was no island he was on but a mere \nreef, a bit of sand in the midst of the ocean.\nHe was too worn out to despair, but he gave a kind of sob and stood there, \nbewildered, leaning on his staff, for a long time. Then doggedly he turned to the left, so \nthe wind would be at his back at least, and shuffled down the high dune, seeking some \nhollow among the ice-rimed, bowing sea-grass where he could have a little shelter. As he \nheld up the staff to see what lay before him, he caught a dull gleam at the farthest edge \nof the circle of werelight: a wall of rain-wet wood.\nIt was a hut or shed, small and rickety as if a child had built it. Ged knocked on \nthe low door with his staff. It remained shut. Ged pushed it open and entered, stooping \nnearly double to do so. He could not stand up straight inside the hut. Coals lay red in the \nfirepit, and by their dim glow Ged saw a man with white, long hair, who crouched in \nterror against the far wall, and another, man or woman he could not tell, peering from a \nheap of rags or hides on the floor.\n\"I won't hurt you,\" Ged whispered.\nThey said nothing. He looked from one to the other. Their eyes were blank with \nterror. When he laid down his staff, the one under the pile of rags hid whimpering. Ged \ntook off his cloak that was heavy with water and ice, stripped naked and huddled over \nthe firepit. \"Give me something to wrap myself in,\" he said. He was hoarse, and could \nhardly speak for the chattering of his teeth and the long shudders that shook him. If they \n",

I \ncome to you in need, I mean you no harm.\"\nThe old man did not move, watching him in a stupor of fear.\n\"Do you understand me? Do you speak no Hardic?\" Ged paused, and then asked, \n\"Kargad?\"\nAt that word, the old man nodded all at once, one nod, like a sad old puppet on \nstrings. But as it was the only word Ged knew of the Kargish language, it was the end of \ntheir conversation. He found wood piled by one wall, built up the fire himself, and then \nwith gestures asked for water, for swallowing seawater had sickened him and now he \nwas parched with thirst. Cringing, the old man pointed to a great shell that held water, \nand pushed towards the fire another shell in which were strips of smoke-dried fish. So, \ncrosslegged close by the fire, Ged drank, and ate a little, and as some strength and sense \nbegan to come back into him, he wondered where he was. Even with the magewind he \ncould not have sailed clear to the Kargad Lands. This islet must be out in the Reach, east \nof Gont but still west of Karego-At. It seemed strange that people dwelt on so small and \nforlorn a place, a mere sand-bar; maybe they were castaways; but he was too weary to \npuzzle his head about them then.\nHe kept turning his cloak to the heat. The silvery pellawifur dried fast, and as soon \nas the wool of the facing was at least warm, if not dry, he wrapped himself in it and \nstretched out by the firepit. \"Go to sleep, poor folk,\" he said to his silent hosts, and laid \nhis head down on the floor of sand, and slept.\nThree nights he spent on the nameless isle, for the first morning when he woke he \nwas sore in every muscle and feverish and sick. He lay like a log of driftwood in the but \nby the firepit all that day and night. The next morning he woke still stiff and sore, but \nrecovered. He put back on his salt-crusted clothes, for there was not enough water to \nwash them, and going out into the grey windy morning looked over this place whereto \nthe shadow had tricked him.\nIt was a rocky sand-bar a mile wide at its widest and a little longer than that, \nfringed all about with shoals and rocks. No tree or bush grew on it, no plant but the \nbowing sea-grass. The but stood in a hollow of the dunes, and the old man and woman \nlived there alone in the utter desolation of the empty sea.

The \ntattered hides in the but, and a little store of bone needles and fishhooks, and the sinew \nfor fishlines and firedrill, came not from goats as Ged had thought at first, but from \nspotted seal; and indeed this was the kind of place where the seal will go to raise their \npups in summer. But no one else comes to such a place. The old ones feared Ged not \nbecause they thought him a spirit, and not because he was a wizard, but only because he \nwas a man. They had forgotten that there were other people in the world.\nThe old man's sullen dread never lessened. When he thought Ged was coming \nclose enough to touch him, he would hobble away, peering back with a scowl around his \nbush of dirty white hair. At first the old woman had whimpered and hidden under her \nrag-pile whenever Ged moved, but as he had lain dozing feverishly in the dark hut, he \nsaw her squatting to stare at him with a strange, dull, yearning look; and after a while \nshe had brought him water to drink. When he sat up to take the shell from her she was \nscared and dropped it, spilling all the water, and then she wept, and wiped her eyes with \nher long whitish-grey hair.\nNow she watched him as he worked down on the beach, shaping driftwood and \nplanks from his boat that had washed ashore into a new boat, using the old man's crude \nstone adze and a binding-spell. This was neither a repair nor a boat-building, for he had \nnot enough proper wood, and must supply all his wants with pure wizardry. Yet the old \nwoman did not watch his marvellous work so much as she watched him, with that same \ncraving look in her eyes. After a while she went off, and came back presently with a gift: \na handful of mussels she had gathered on the rocks. Ged ate them as she gave them to \nhim, sea-wet and raw, and thanked her. Seeming to gain courage, she went to the but and \ncame back with something again in her hands, a bundle wrapped up in a rag. Timidly, \nwatching his face all the while, she unwrapped the thing and held it up for him to see.\nIt was a little child's dress of silk brocade stiff with seedpearls, stained with salt, \nyellow with years. On the small bodice the pearls were worked in a shape Ged knew: the \ndouble arrow of the God-Brothers of the Kargad Empire, surmounted by a king's crown.\nThe old woman, wrinkled, dirty, clothed in an illsewn sack of sealskin, pointed at \nthe little silken dress and at herself, and smiled: a sweet, unmeaning smile, like a baby's. \nFrom some hidingplace sewn in the skirt of the dress she took a small object, and this \nwas held out to Ged. It was a bit of dark metal, a piece of broken jewelry perhaps, the \nhalf-circle of a broken ring. Ged looked at it, but she gestured that he take it, and was \nnot satisfied until he took it; then she nodded and smiled again; she had made him a \npresent.

He guessed now that these two might be children of some royal \nhouse of the Kargad Empire; a tyrant or usurper who feared to shed kingly blood had \nsent them to be cast away, to live or die, on an uncharted islet far from Karego-At. One \nhad been a boy of eight or ten, maybe, and the other a stout baby princess in a dress of \nsilk and pearls; and they had lived, and lived on alone, forty years, fifty years, on a rock \nin the ocean, prince and princess of Desolation.\nBut the truth of this guess he did not learn until, years later, the quest of the Ring \nof Erreth-Akbe led him to the Kargad Lands, and to the Tombs of Atuan.\nHis third night on the isle lightened to a calm, pale sunrise. It was the day of \nSunreturn, the shortest day of the year. His little boat of wood and magic, scraps and \nspells, was ready. He had tried to tell the old ones that he would take them to any land, \nGont or Spevy or the Torikles; he would have left them even on some lonely shore of \nKarego-At, had they asked it of him, though Kargish waters were no safe place for an \nArchipelagan to venture. But they would not leave their barren isle. The old woman \nseemed not to understand what he meant with his gestures and quiet words; the old man \ndid understand, and refused. All his memory of other lands and other men was a child's \nnightmare of blood and giants and screaming: Ged could see that in his face, as he shook \nhis head and shook his head.\nSo Ged that morning filled up a sealskin pouch with water at the well, and since \nhe could not thank the old ones for their fire and food, and had no present for the old \nwoman as he would have liked, he did what he could, and set a charm on that salty \nunreliable spring. The water rose up through the sand as sweet and clear as any \nmountain spring in the heights of Gont, nor did it ever fail. Because of it, that place of \ndunes and rocks is charted now and bears a name; sailors call it Springwater Isle. But the \nhut is gone, and the storms of many winters have left no sign of the two who lived out \ntheir lives there and died alone.\nThey kept hidden in the hut, as if they feared to watch, when Ged ran his boat out \nfrom the sandy south end of the isle. He let the world's wind, steady from the north, fill \nhis sail of spellcloth, and went speedily forth over the sea.\nNow this sea-quest of Ged's was a` strange matter, for as he well knew, he was a \nhunter who knew neither what the thing was that he hunted, nor where in all Earthsea it \nmight be. He must hunt it by guess, by hunch, by luck, even as it bad hunted him. Each \nwas blind to the other's being, Ged as baffled by impalpable shadows as the shadow was \nbaffled by daylight and by solid things. One certainty only Ged had: that he was indeed \nthe hunter now and not the hunted. For the shadow, having tricked him onto the rocks, \nmight have had him at its mercy all the while he lay half-dead on the shore and \n",

In this he saw that Ogion \nhad been right: the shadow could not draw on his power, so long as he was turned \nagainst it. So he must keep against it, keep after it, though its track was cold across these \nwide seas, and he had nothing at all to guide him but the luck of the world's wind \nblowing southward, and a dim guess or notion in his mind that south or east was the \nright way to follow.\nBefore nightfall he saw away off on his left hand the long, faint shoreline of a \ngreat land, which must be Karego-At. He was in the very sea-roads of those white \nbarbaric folk. He kept a sharp watch out for any Kargish longship or galley; and he \nremembered, as he sailed through red evening, that morning of his boyhood in Ten \nAlders village, the plumed warriors; the fire, the mist. And thinking of that day he saw \nall at once, with a qualm at his heart, how the shadow had tricked him with his own \ntrick, bringing that mist about him on the sea as if bringing it out of his own past, \nblinding him to danger and fooling him to his death.\nHe kept his course to the southeast, and the land sank out of sight as night came \nover the eastern edge of the world. The hollows of the waves all were full of darkness \nwhile the crests shone yet with a clear ruddy reflection of the west. Ged sang aloud the \nWinter Carol, and such cantos of the Deed of the Young King as he remembered, for \nthose songs are sung at the Festival of Sunreturn. His voice was clear, but it fell to \nnothing in the vast silence of the sea. Darkness came quickly, and the winter stars.\nAll that longest night of the year he waked, watching the stars rise upon his left \nhand and wheel overhead and sink into far black waters on the right, while always the \nlong wind of winter bore him southward over an unseen sea. He could sleep for only a \nmoment now and then, with a sharp awakening. This boat he sailed was in truth no boat \nbut a thing more than half charm and sorcery, and the rest of it mere planks and \ndriftwood which, if he let slack the shapingspells and the binding-spell upon them, \nwould soon enough lapse and scatter and go drifting off as a little flotsam on the waves. \nThe sail too, woven of magic and the air, would not long stay against the wind if he \nslept, but would turn to a puff of wind itself. Ged's spells were cogent and potent, but \nwhen the matter on which such spells works is small, the power that keeps them working \nmust be renewed from moment to moment: so he slept not that night. He would have \ngone easier and swifter as falcon or dolphin, but Ogion had advised him not to change \nhis shape, and he knew the value of Ogion's advice. So he sailed southward under the \nwest-going stars, and the long night passed slowly, until the first day of the new year \nbrightened all the sea.\nSoon after the sun rose he saw land ahead, but he was making little way towards \nit. The world's wind had dropped with daybreak. He raised a light magewind into his \n",

And he followed that fear as a \nhunter follows the signs, the broad, blunt, clawed tracks of the bear, that may at any \nmoment turn on him from the thickets. For he was close now: he knew it.\nIt was a queer-looking land that loomed up over the sea as he drew nearer and \nnearer. What had from afar seemed to be one sheer mountainwall, was split into several \nlong steep ridges, separate isles perhaps, between which the sea ran in narrow sounds or \nchannels. Ged had pored over many charts and maps in the Tower of the Master Namer \non Roke, but those had been mostly of the Archipelago and the inner seas. He was out in \nthe East Reach now, and did not know what this island might be. Nor had he much \nthought for that. It was fear that lay ahead of him, that lurked hiding from him or waiting \nfor him among the slopes and forests of the island, and straight for it he steered.\nNow the dark forest-crowned cliffs gloomed and towered high over his boat, and \nspray from the waves that broke against the rocky headlands blew spattering against his \nsail, as the magewind bore him between two great capes into a sound, a sea-lane that ran \non before him deep into the island, no wider than the length of two galleys. The sea, \nconfined, was restless and fretted at the steep shores. There were no beaches, for the \ncliffs dropped straight down into the water that lay darkened by the cold reflection of \ntheir heights. It was windless, and very silent.\nThe shadow had tricked him out onto the moors in Osskil, and tricked him in the \nmist onto the rocks, and now would there be a third trick? Had he driven the thing here, \nor had it drawn him here, into a trap? He did not know. He knew only the torment of \ndread, and the certainty that he must go ahead and do what be had set out to do: hunt \ndown the evil, follow his terror to its source. Very cautiously he steered, watching before \nhim and behind him and up and down the cliffs on either hand. He had left the sunlight \nof the new day behind him on the open sea. All was dark here. The opening between the \nheadlands seemed a remote, bright gateway when he glanced back. The cliffs loomed \nhigher and ever higher overhead as he approached the mountain-root from which they \nsprang, and the lane of water grew narrower. He peered ahead into the dark cleft, and \nleft and right up the great, cavern-pocked, boulder-tumbled slopes where trees crouched \nwith their roots half in air. Nothing moved. Now he was coming to the end of the inlet, a \nhigh blank wrinkled mass of rock against which, narrowed to the width of a little creek, \nthe last sea-waves lapped feebly. Fallen boulders and rotten trunks and the roots of \ngnarled trees left only a tight way to steer. A trap: a dark trap under the roots of the silent \nmountain, and he was in the trap. Nothing moved before him or above him. All was \ndeathly still. He could go no further.\nHe turned the boat around, working her carefully round with spell and with \nmakeshift oar lest she knock up against the underwater rocks or be entangled in the \n",

He looked back over his shoulder. The \nshadow stood behind him in the boat.\nHad he lost one instant, he had been lost; but he was ready, and lunged to seize \nand hold the thing which wavered and trembled there within arm's reach. No wizardry \nwould serve him now, but only his own flesh, his life itself, against the unliving. He \nspoke no word, but attacked, and the boat plunged and pitched from his sudden turn and \nlunge. And a pain ran up his arms into his breast, taking away his breath, and an icy cold \nfilled him, and he was blinded: yet in his hands that seized the shadow there was nothing \n- darkness, air.\nHe stumbled forward, catching the mast to stay his fall, and light came shooting \nback into his eyes. He saw the shadow shudder away from him and shrink together, then \nstretch hugely up over him, over the sail, for an instant. Then like black smoke on the \nwind it recoiled and fled, formless, down the water towards the bright gate between the \ncliffs.\nGed sank to his knees. The little spell-patched boat pitched again, rocked itself to \nstillness, drifting on the uneasy waves. He crouched in it, numb, unthinking, struggling \nto draw breath, until at last cold water welling under his hands warned him that he must \nsee to his boat, for the spells binding it were growing weak. He stood up, holding onto \nthe staff that made the mast, and rewove the binding-spell as best he could. He was \nchilled and weary; his hands and arms ached sorely, and there was no power in him. He \nwished he might lie down there in that dark place where sea and mountain met and \nsleep, sleep on the restless rocking water.\nHe could not tell if this weariness were a sorcery laid on him by the shadow as it \nfled, or came of the bitter coldness of its touch, or was from mere hunger and want of \nsleep and expense of strength; but he struggled against it, forcing himself to raise up a \nlight magewind into the sail and follow down the dark sea-way where the shadow had \nfled.\nAll terror was gone. All joy was gone. It was a chase no longer. He was neither \nhunted nor hunter, now. For the third time they had met and touched: he had of his own \nwill turned to the shadow, seeking to hold it with living bands. He had not held it, but he \nhad forged between them a bond, a link that had no breaking-point. There was no need \nto hunt the thing down, to track it, nor would its flight avail it. Neither could escape. \nWhen they had come to the time and place for their last meeting, they would meet.\nBut until that time, and elsewhere than that place, there would never be any rest or \n",

He knew now, and the knowledge was hard, \nthat his task had never been to undo what he had done, but to finish what he had begun.\nHe sailed out from between the dark cliffs, and on the sea was broad, bright \nmorning, with a fair wind blowing from the north.\nHe drank what water he had left in the sealskin pouch, and steered around the \nwesternmost headland until he came into a wide strait between it and a second island \nlying to the west. Then he knew the place, calling to mind sea-charts of the East Reach. \nThese were the Hands, a pair of lonely isles that reach their mountain-fingers northward \ntoward, the Kargad Lands. He sailed on between the two, and as the afternoon darkened \nwith storm-clouds coming up from the north he came to shore, on the southern coast of \nthe west isle. He had seen there was a little village there, above the beach where a \nstream came tumbling down to the sea, and he cared little what welcome he got if he \ncould have water, fire's warmth, and sleep.\nThe villagers were rough shy people, awed by a wizard's staff, wary of a strange \nface, but hospitable to one who came alone, over sea, before a storm. They gave him \nmeat and drink in plenty, and the comfort of firelight and the comfort of human voices \nspeaking his own Hardic tongue, and last and best they gave him hot water to wash the \ncold and saltness of the sea from him, and a bed where he could sleep.\n------\n9 Iffish\n------\nGed spent three days in that village of the West Hand, recovering himself, and \nmaking ready a boat built not of spells and sea-wrack but of sound wood well pegged \nand caulked, with a stout mast and sail of her own, that he might sail easily and sleep \nwhen he needed. Like most boats of the North and the Reaches she was clinker-built, \nwith planks overlapped and clenched one upon the other for strength in the high seas; \nevery part of her was sturdy and well-made.

But Ged paid him for it in sorcerers' kind, \nhealing his eyes of the cataracts that were in the way of blinding him. Then the old man, \nrejoicing, said to him, \"We called the boat Sanderling, but do you call her Lookfar, and \npaint eyes aside her prow, and my thanks will look out of that blind wood for you and \nkeep you from rock and reef. For I had forgotten how much light there is in the world, \ntill you gave it back to me.\"\nOther works Ged also did in his days in that village under the steep forests of the \nHand, as his power came back into him. These were such people as he had known as a \nboy in the Northward Vale of Gont, though poorer even than those. With them he was at \nhome, as he would never be in the courts of the wealthy, and he knew their bitter wants \nwithout having to ask. So he laid charms of heal and ward on children who were lame or \nsickly, and spells of increase on the villagers' scrawny flocks of goats and sheep; he set \nthe rune Simn on the spindles and looms, the boat's oars and tools of bronze and stone \nthey brought him, that these might do their work well; and the rune Pirr he wrote on the \nrooftrees of the huts, which protects the house and its folk from fire, wind, and madness.\nWhen his boat Lookfar was ready and well stocked with water and dried fish, he \nstayed yet one more day in the village, to teach to their young chanter the Deed of \nMorred and the Havnorian Lay. Very seldom did any Archipelagan ship touch at the \nHands: songs made a hundred years ago were news to those villagers, and they craved to \nhear of heroes. Had Ged been free of what was laid on him he would gladly have stayed \nthere a week or a month to sing them what he knew, that the great songs might be known \non a new isle. But he was not free, and the next morning he set sail, going straight south \nover the wide seas of the Reach. For southward the shadow bad gone. He need cast no \nfinding-charm to know this: he knew it, as certainly as if a fine unreeling cord bound \nhim and it together, no matter what miles and seas and lands might lie between. So he \nwent certain, unhurried, and unhopeful on the way he must go, and the wind of winter \nbore him to the south.\nHe sailed a day and a night over the lonesome sea, and on the second day he came \nto a small isle, which they told him was called Vemish. The people in the little port \nlooked at him askance, and soon their sorcerer came hurrying. He looked hard at Ged, \nand then he bowed, and said in a voice that was both pompous and wheedling, \"Lord \nWizard! forgive my temerity, and honor us by accepting of us anything you may need \nfor your voyage - food, drink, sailcloth, rope, my daughter is fetching to your boat at this \nmoment a brace of fresh-roasted hens- I think it prudent, however, that you continue on \nyour way from here as soon as it meets your convenience to do so.

Those who saw this person tell me that he bore some likeness to yourself.\"\nAt that, Ged bowed his own head, and turned and went back to the docks of \nVemish and sailed out, not looking back. There was no profit in frightening the islanders \nor making an enemy of their sorcerer. He would rather sleep at sea again, and think over \nthis news the sorcerer had told him, for he was sorely puzzled by it.\nThe day ended, and the night passed with cold rain whispering over the sea all \nthrough the dark hours, and a grey dawn. Still the mild north wind carried Lookfar on. \nAfter noon the rain and mist blew off, and the sun shone from time to time; and late in \nthe day Ged saw right athwart his course the low blue hills of a great island, brightened \nby that drifting winter sunlight. The smoke of hearthfires lingered blue over the slate \nroofs of little towns among those hills, a pleasant sight in the vast sameness of the sea.\nGed followed a fishing-fleet in to their port, and going up the streets of the town \nin the golden winter evening he found an inn called The Harrekki, where firelight and \nale and roast ribs of mutton warmed him body and soul. At the tables of the inn there \nwere a couple of other voyagers, traders of the East Reach, but most of the men were \ntownsfolk come there for good ale, news, and conversation. They were not rough timid \npeople like the fisher-folk of the Hands, but true townsmen, alert and sedate. Surely they \nknew Ged for a wizard, but nothing at all was said of it, except that the innkeeper in \ntalking (and he was a talkative man) mentioned that this town, Ismay, was fortunate in \nsharing with other towns of the island the inestimable treasure of an accomplished \nwizard trained at the School on Roke, who had been given his staff by the Archmage \nhimself, and who, though out of town at the moment, dwelt in his ancestral home right \nin Ismay itself, which, therefore, stood in no need of any other practitioner of the High \nArts. \"As they say, two staffs in one town must come to blows, isn't it so, Sir?\" said the \ninnkeeper, smiling and full of cheer. So Ged was informed that as journey-man-wizard, \none seeking a livelihood from sorcery, he was not wanted here. Thus he had got a blunt \ndismissal from Vemish and a bland one from Ismay, and he wondered at what he had \nbeen told about the kindly ways of the East Reach. This isle was Iffish, where his friend \nVetch had been born. It did not seem so hospitable a place as Vetch had said.\nAnd yet he saw that they were, indeed, kindly faces enough. It was only that they \nsensed what he knew to be true: that he was set apart from them, cut off from them, that \nhe bore a doom upon him and followed after a dark thing. He was like a cold wind \nblowing through the firelit room, like a black bird carried by on a storm from foreign \nlands. The sooner he went on, taking his evil destiny with him, the better for these folk.\n",

The Innkeeper, with a glance at the great yew-staff in the corner, said \nnothing at all for once, but filled up Ged's cup with brown ale till the foam ran over the \ntop.\nGed knew that he should spend only the one night in Ismay. There was no \nwelcome for him there, or anywhere. He must go where he was bound. But he was sick \nof the cold empty sea and the silence where no voice spoke to him. He told himself he \nwould spend one day in Ismay, and on the morrow go. So he slept late; when he woke a \nlight snow was falling, and he idled about the lanes and byways of the town to watch the \npeople busy at their doings. He watched children bundled in fur capes playing at snow-\ncastle and building snowmen; he heard gossips chatting across the street from open \ndoors, and watched the bronze-smith at work with a little lad red-faced and sweating to \npump the long bellows-sleeves at the smelting pit; through windows lit with a dim ruddy \ngold from within as the short day darkened he saw women at their looms, turning a \nmoment to speak or smile to child or husband there in the warmth within the house. Ged \nsaw all these things from outside and apart, alone, and his heart was very heavy in him, \nthough he would not admit to himself that he was sad. As night fell he still lingered in \nthe streets, reluctant to go back to the inn. He heard a man and a girl talking together \nmerrily as they came down the street past him towards the town square, and all at once \nhe turned, for he knew the man's voice.\nHe followed and caught up with the pair, coming up beside them in the late \ntwilight lit only by distant lantern-gleams. The girl stepped back, but the man stared at \nhim and then flung up the staff he carried, holding it between them as a barrier to ward \noff the threat or act of evil. And that was somewhat more than Ged could bear. His voice \nshook a little as he said, \"I thought you would know me, Vetch.\"\nEven then Vetch hesitated for a moment.\n\"I do know you,\" he said, and lowered the staff and took Ged's hand and hugged \nhim round the shoulders-\" I do know you! Welcome, my friend, welcome! What a sorry \ngreeting I gave you, as if you were a ghost coming up from behind- and I have waited \nfor you to come, and looked for you-\"\n\"So you are the wizard they boast of in Ismay? I wondered-\"\n\"Oh, yes, I'm their wizard; but listen, let me tell you why I didn't know you, lad. \nMaybe I've looked too hard for you.

There Vetch for all his plain quiet ways was both a powerful wizard and a lord in \nhis own house. There were a couple of old servants, prospering along with the house, \nand the brother, a cheerful lad, and Yarrow, quick and silent as a little fish, who served \nthe two friends their supper and ate with them, listening to their talk, and afterwards \nslipped off to her own room. All things here were well-founded, peaceful, and assured; \nand Ged looking about him at the firelit room said, \"This is how a man should live,\" and \nsighed.\n\"Well, it's one good way,\" said Vetch. \"There are others. Now, lad, tell me if you \ncan what things have come to you and gone from you since we last spoke, two years \nago. And tell me what journey you are on, since I see well that you won't stay long with \nus this time.\"\nGed told him, and when he was done Vetch sat pondering for a long while. Then \nhe said, \"I'll go with you, Ged.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I think I will.\"\n\"No, Estarriol. This is no task or bane of yours. I began this evil course alone, I \nwill finish it alone, I do not want any other to suffer from it - you least of all, you who \ntried to keep my hand from the evil act in the very beginning, Estarriol-\"\n\"Pride was ever your mind's master,\" his friend said smiling, as if they talked of a \nmatter of small concern to either. \"Now think: it is your quest, assuredly, but if the quest \nfail, should there not be another there who might bear warning to the Archipelago? For \nthe shadow would be a fearful power then. And if you defeat the thing, should there not \nbe another there who will tell of it in the Archipelago, that the Deed may be known and \nsung? I know I can be of no use to you; yet I think I should go with you.\"\nSo entreated Ged could not deny his friend, but he said, \"I should not have stayed \nthis day here. I knew it, but I stayed.\"\n\"Wizards do not meet by chance, lad,\" said Vetch. \"And after all, as you said \n",

He left Roke that same summer, and went to the Island of \nO to be sorcerer in the Lord's household at O-tokne. I know no more of him than that.\"\nAgain they were silent, watching the fire and enjoying (since it was a bitter night) \nthe warmth on their legs and faces as they sat on the broad coping of the firepit, their \nfeet almost among the coals.\nGed said at last, speaking low, \"There is a thing that I fear, Estarriol. I fear it more \nif you are with me when I go. There in the Hands in the dead end of the inlet I turned \nupon the shadow, it was within my hands' reach, and I seized it - I tried to seize it. And \nthere was nothing I could hold. I could not defeat it. It fled, I followed. But that may \nhappen again, and yet again. I have no power over the thing. There may be neither death \nnor triumph to end this quest; nothing to sing of; no end. It may be I must spend my life \nrunning from sea to sea and land to land on an endless vain venture, a shadow-quest.\"\n\"Avert!\" said Vetch, turning his left hand in the gesture that turns aside the ill \nchance spoken of. For all his somber thoughts this made Ged grin a little, for it is rather \na child's charm than a wizard's; there was always such village innocence in Vetch. Yet \nalso he was keen, shrewd, direct to the center of a thing. He said now, \"That is a grim \nthought and I trust a false one. I guess rather that what I saw begin, I may see end. \nSomehow you will learn its nature, its being, what it is, and so hold and bind and \nvanquish it. Though that is a hard question: what is it... There is a thing that worries me, \nI do not understand it. It seems the shadow now goes in your shape, or a kind of likeness \nof you at least, as they saw it on Vemish and as I saw it here in Iffish. How may that be, \nand why, and why did it never do so in the Archipelago?\"\n\"They say, Rules change in the Reaches.\"\n\"Aye, a true saying, I can tell you. There are good spells I learned on Roke that \nhave no power here, or go all awry; and also there are spells worked here I never learned \non Roke. Every land has its own powers, and the farther one goes from the Inner Lands, \nthe less one can guess about those powers and their governance. But I do not think it is \nonly that which works this change in the shadow.\"\n\"Nor do I.

Almost with my own tongue it speaks: for how did it know my name? How did it \nknow my name? I have racked my brains on that over all the seas since I left Gont, and I \ncannot see the answer. Maybe it cannot speak at all in its own form or formlessness, but \nonly with borrowed tongue, as a gebbeth. I do not know.\"\n\"Then you must beware meeting it in gebbeth-form a second time.\"\n\"I think,\" Ged replied, stretching out his hands to the red coals as if he felt an \ninward chill, \"I think I will not. It is bound to me now as I am to it. It cannot get so far \nfree of me as to seize any other man and empty him of will and being, as it did Skiorh. It \ncan possess me. If ever I weaken again, and try to escape from it, to break the bond, it \nwill possess me. And yet, when I held it with all the strength I had, it became mere \nvapor, and escaped from me...

However there was also a dragon, who offered \nto trade that name for his own, to be rid of me; and I have thought that, where mages \nargue, dragons may be wise.\"\n\"Wise, but unkind.

It seemed likely to him that leaving this house he would leave the \nlast haven he was to know, and so while the short dream lasted he would be happy in it.\nHaving affairs he must see to before he left Iffish, Vetch went off to other villages \nof the island with the lad who served him as prentice-sorcerer. Ged stayed with Yarrow \nand her brother, called Murre, who was between her and Vetch in age. He seemed not \nmuch more than a boy, for there was no gift or scourge of mage-power in him, and he \nhad never been anywhere but Iffish, Tok, and Holp, and his life was easy and \nuntroubled. Ged watched him with wonder and some envy, and exactly so he watched \nGed: to each it seemed very queer that the other, so different, yet was his own age, \nnineteen years. Ged marvelled how one who had lived nineteen years could be so \ncarefree. Admiring Murre's comely, cheerful face he felt himself to be all lank and harsh, \nnever guessing that Murre envied him even the scars that scored his face, and thought \nthem the track of a dragon's claws and the very rune and sign of a hero.\nThe two young men were thus somewhat shy with each other, but as for Yarrow \nshe soon lost her awe of Ged, being in her own house and mistress of it. He was very \ngentle with her, and many were the questions she asked of him, for Vetch, she said, \nwould never tell her anything. She kept busy those two days making dry wheatcakes for \nthe voyagers to carry, and wrapping up dried fish and meat and other such provender to \nstock their boat, until Ged told her to stop, for he did not plan to sail clear to Selidor \nwithout a halt.\n\"Where is Selidor?\"\n\"Very far out in the Western Reach, where dragons are as common as mice.\"\n\"Best stay in the East then, our dragons are as small as mice. There's your meat, \nthen; you're sure that's enough? Listen, I don't understand: you and my brother both are \nmighty wizards, you wave your hand and mutter and the thing is done. Why do you get \nhungry, then? When it comes suppertime at sea, why not say, Meat-pie! and the meat-pie \nappears, and you eat it?\"\n\"Well, we could do so. But we don't much wish to eat our words, as they say. \nMeat-pie! is only a word, after all... We can make it odorous, and savorous, and even \nfilling, but it remains a word. It fools the stomach and gives no strength to the hungry \nman.\"\n\"Wizards, then, are not cooks,\" said Murre, who was sitting across the kitchen \nhearth from Ged, carving a box-lid of fine wood; he was a woodworker by trade, though \nnot a very zealous one.\n",

I have seen my brother, and even his prentice, make light in a dark place \nonly by saying one word: and the light shines, it is bright, not a word but a light you can \nsee your way by!\"\n\"Aye,\" Ged answered. \"Light is a power. A great power, by which we exist, but \nwhich exists beyond our needs, in itself. Sunlight and starlight are time, and time is \nlight. In the sunlight, in the days and years, life is. In a dark place life may call upon the \nlight, naming it. But usually when you see a wizard name or call upon some thing, some \nobject to appear, that is not the same, he calls upon no power greater than himself, and \nwhat appears is an illusion only. To summon a thing that is not there at all, to call it by \nspeaking its true name, that is a great mastery, not lightly used. Not for mere hunger's \nsake. Yarrow, your little dragon has stolen a cake.\"\nYarrow had listened so hard, gazing at Ged as he spoke, that she had not seen the \nharrekki scuttle down from its warm perch on the kettle-hook over the hearth and seize a \nwheatcake bigger than itself. She took the small scaly creature on her knee and fed it bits \nand crumbs, while she pondered what Ged had told her.\n\"So then you would not summon up a real meat-pie lest you disturb what my \nbrother is always talking about- I forget its name-\"\n\"Equilibrium,\" Ged replied soberly, for she was very serious.\n\"Yes. But, when you were shipwrecked, you sailed from the place in a boat woven \nmostly of spells, and it didn't leak water. Was it illusion?\"\n\"Well, partly it was illusion, because I am uneasy seeing the sea through great \nholes in my boat, so I patched them for the looks of the thing. But the strength of the \nboat was not illusion, nor summoning, but made with another kind of art, a binding-\nspell. The wood was bound as one whole, one entire thing, a boat. What is a boat but a \nthing that doesn't leak water?\"\n\"I've bailed some that do,\" said Murre.\n\"Well, mine leaked, too, unless I was constantly seeing to the spell.\" He bent \ndown from his corner seat and took a cake from the bricks, and juggled it in his hands. \"I \ntoo have stolen a cake.\"\n\"You have burned fingers, then. And when you're starving on the waste water \nbetween the far isles you'll think of that cake and say, Ah! had I not stolen that cake I \nmight eat it now, alas!- I shall eat my brother's, so he can starve with you\n",

All power is one in source and end, I think. Years and distances, \nstars and candles, water and wind and wizardry, the craft in a man's hand and the \nwisdom in a tree's root: they all arise together. My name, and yours, and the true name \nof the sun, or a spring of water, or an unborn child, all are syllables of the great word \nthat is very slowly spoken by the shining of the stars. There is no other power. No other \nname.\"\nStaying his knife on the carved wood, Murre asked, \"What of death?\"\nThe girl listened, her shining black head bent down.\n\"For a word to be spoken,\" Ged answered slowly, \"there must be silence. Before, \nand after.\" Then all at once he got up, saying, \"I have no right to speak of these things. \nThe word that was mine to say I said wrong. It is better that I keep still; I will not speak \nagain. Maybe there is no true power but the dark.\" And he left the fireside and the warm \nkitchen, taking up his cloak and going out alone into the drizzling cold rain of winter in \nthe streets.\n\"He is under a curse,\" Murre said, gazing somewhat fearfully after him.\n\"I think this voyage he is on leads him to his death,\" the girl said, \"and he fears \nthat, yet he goes on.\" She lifted her head as if she watched, through the red flame of the \nfire, the course of a boat that came through the seas of winter alone, and went on out into \nempty seas.

Growing weary of old men who nagged him, he said, \"I am yours, by parentage \nand custom and by duty undertaken towards you. I am your wizard. But it, is time you \nrecalled that, though I am a servant, I am not your servant. When I am free to come back \nI will come back: till then farewell.\"\nAt daybreak, as grey light welled up in the east from the sea, the two young men \nset forth in Lookfar from the harbor of Ismay, raising a brown, strong-woven sail to the \nnorth wind.

They stayed in port there only briefly, long enough to refill \na waterskin, and to buy a tarsmeared sailcloth to protect some of their gear in the \nundecked boat from seawater and rain. They had not provided this earlier, because \nordinarily a wizard looks after such small conveniences by way of spells, the very least \nand commonest kind of spells, and indeed it takes little more magic to freshen seawater \nand so save the bother of carrying fresh water. But Ged seemed most unwilling to use \nhis craft, or to let Vetch use his. He said only, \"It's better not,\" and his friend did not ask \nor argue. For as the wind first filled their sail, both had felt a heavy foreboding, cold as \nthat winter wind. Haven, harbor, peace, safety, all that was behind. They had turned \naway.

As Soders Island grew small and pale behind them, and the \nwaves hissed and smacked under the prow, and the great grey plain of water circled \nthem all round clear to the edge of the sky, Ged asked, \"What lands lie ahead this \ncourse?\"\n\"Due south of Soders there are no lands at all.

The most \nthey saw that day was a school of silver pannies swimming south, but never a dolphin \nleapt nor did the flight of gull or murre or tern break the grey air. As the east darkened \nand the west grew red, Vetch brought out food and divided it between them and said, \n\"Here's the last of the ale.

The thought of her brought to his \nmind the sense of her wise and childish sweetness. She was not like any person he had \nknown. (What young girl had he ever known at all? but he never thought of that.) \"She is \nlike a little fish, a minnow, that swims in a clear creek,\" he said, \"-defenseless, yet you \ncannot catch her.\"\nAt this Vetch looked straight at him, smiling. \"You are a mage born,\" he said. \"Her \ntrue name is Kest\" In the Old Speech, kest is minnow, as Ged well knew; and this \npleased him to the heart.

But the \novercast had broken, and before dawn the thin moon shining between brown-edged \nclouds shed a weak light on the sea.\n\"The moon wanes to her dark,\" Vetch murmured, awake in the dawn, when for a \nwhile the cold wind dropped. Ged looked up at the white half-ring above the paling \neastern waters, but said nothing. The dark of the moon that follows first after Sunreturn \nis called the Fallows, and is the contrary pole of the days of the Moon and the Long \nDance in summer. It is an unlucky time for travellers and for the sick; children are not \ngiven their true name during the Fallows, and no Deeds are sung, nor swords nor edge-\ntools sharpened, nor oaths sworn. It is the dark axis of the year, when things done are ill \ndone.\nThree days out from Soders they came, following seabirds and shore-wrack, to \nPelimer, a small isle humped high above the high grey seas. Its people spoke Hardic, but \nin their own fashion, strange even to Vetch's ears. The young men came ashore there for \nfresh water and a respite from the sea, and at first were well received, with wonder and \ncommotion. There was a sorcerer in the main town of the island, but he was mad. He \nwould talk only of the great serpent that was eating at the foundations of Pelimer so that \nsoon the island must go adrift like a boat cut from her moorings, and slide out over the \nedge of the world. At first he greeted the young wizards courteously, but as he talked \nabout the serpent he began to look askance at Ged: and then he fell to railing at them \nthere in the street, calling them spies and servants of the Sea-Snake. The Pelimerians \nlooked dourly at them after that, since though mad he was their sorcerer. So Ged and \nVetch made no long stay, but set forth again before nightfall, going always south and \neast.\nIn these days and nights of sailing Ged never spoke of the shadow, nor directly of \nhis quest; and the nearest Vetch came to asking any question was (as they followed the \nsame course farther and farther out and away from the known lands of Earthsea ) -Are \nyou sure?-\" To this Ged answered only, \"Is the iron sure where the magnet lies?\" Vetch \nnodded and they went on, no more being said by either. But from time to time they \ntalked of the crafts and devices that mages of old days had used to find out the hidden \nname of baneful powers and beings: how Nereger of Paln had learned the Black Mage's \nname from overhearing the conversation of dragons, and how Morred had seen his \nenemy's name written by falling raindrops in the dust of the battlefield of the Plains of \nEnlad. They spoke of finding-spells, and invocations, and those Answerable Questions \nwhich only the Master Patterner of Roke can ask. But often Ged would end by \nmurmuring words which Ogion had said to him on the shoulder of Gont Mountain in an \nautumn long ago: \"To hear, one must be silent...\" And he would fall silent, and ponder, \nhour by hour, always watching the sea ahead of the boat's way.

Vetch said, 'That will be \nAstowell, from the look of it. Lastland. East and south of it the charts are empty.\"\n\"Yet they who live there may know of farther lands,\" Ged answered.\n\"Why do you say so?\" Vetch asked, for Ged had spoken uneasily; and his answer \nto this again was halting and strange. \"Not there,\" he said, gazing at Astowell ahead, and \npast it, or through it \"Not there. Not on the sea. Not on the sea but on dry land: what \nland? Before the springs of the open sea, beyond the sources, behind the gates of \ndaylight-\"\nThen he fell silent, and when he spoke again it was in an ordinary voice, as if he \nhad been freed from a spell or a vision, and had no clear memory of it.\nThe port of Astowell, a creek-mouth between rocky heights, was on the northern \nshore of the isle, and all the huts of the town faced north and west; it was as if the island \nturned its face, though from so far away, always towards Earthsea, towards mankind.\nExcitement and dismay attended the arrival of strangers, in a season when no boat \nhad ever braved the seas round Astowell. The women all stayed in the wattle huts, \npeering out the door, hiding their children behind their skirts, drawing back fearfully into \nthe darkness of the huts as the strangers came up from the beach. The men, lean fellows \nill-clothed against the cold, gathered in a solemn circle about Vetch and Ged, and each \none held a stone handaxe or a knife of shell. But once their fear was past they made the \nstrangers very welcome, and there was no end to their questions. Seldom did any ship \ncome to them even from Soders or Rolameny, they having nothing to trade for bronze or \nfine wares; they had not even any wood. Their boats were coracles woven of reed, and it \nwas a brave sailor who would go as far as Gosk or Kornay in such a craft. They dwelt all \nalone here at the edge of all the maps. They had no witch or sorcerer, and seemed not to \nrecognise the young wizards' staffs for what they were, admiring them only for the \nprecious stuff they were made of, wood. Their chief or Isle-Man was very old, and he \nalone of his people had ever before seen a man born in the Archipelago. Ged, therefore, \nwas a marvel to them; the men brought their little sons to look at the Archipelagan, so \nthey might remember him when they were old. They had never heard of Gont, only of \nHavnor and Ea, and took him for a Lord of Havnor. He did his best to answer their \nquestions about the white city he had never seen. But he was restless as the evening \n",

There is no land beyond. There is nothing but water till world's \nedge.\"\n\"These are wise men, father,\" said a younger man, \"seafarers, voyagers. Maybe \nthey know of a land we do not know of.\"\n\"There is no land east of this land,\" said the old man, and he looked long at Ged, \nand spoke no more to him.\nThe companions slept that night in the smoky warmth of the lodge. Before \ndaylight Ged roused his friend, whispering, \"Estarriol, wake. We cannot stay, we must \ngo.\"\n\"Why so soon?\" Vetch asked, full of sleep.\n\"Not soon- late. I have followed too slow. It has found the way to escape me, and \nso doom me. It must not escape me, for I must follow it however far it goes. If I lose it I \nam lost\"\n\"Where do we follow it?\"\n\"Eastward. Come. I filled the waterskins.\"\nSo they left the lodge before any in the village was awake, except a baby that \ncried a little in the darkness of some but, and fell still again. By the vague starlight they \nfound the way down to the creekmouth, and untied Lookfar from the rock cairn where \nshe had been made fast, and pushed her out into the black water. So they set out \neastward from Astowell into the Open Sea, on the first day of the Fallows, before \nsunrise.\nThat day they had clear skies. The world's wind was cold and gusty from the \nnortheast, but Ged had raised the magewind: the first act of magery he had done since he \nleft the Isle of the Hands.

At noon they ate. Ged doled their food out sparingly, and the \nportent of this was plain, but both of them chewed their bit of salt fish and wheaten cake, \nand neither said anything.\nAll afternoon they cleaved eastward never turning nor slackening pace. Once Ged \nbroke his silence, saying, \"Do you hold with those who think the world is all landless \nsea beyond the Outer Reaches, or with those who imagine other Archipelagoes or vast \nundiscovered lands on the other face of the world?\"\n\"At this time,\" said Vetch, \"I hold with those who think the world has but one \nface, and he who sails too far will fall off the edge of it\"\nGed did not smile; there was no mirth left in him. \"Who knows what a man might \nmeet, out there? Not we, who keep always to our coasts and shores.\"\n\"Some have sought to know, and have not returned. And no ship has ever come to \nus from lands we do not know.\"\nGed made no reply.\nAll that day, all that night they went driven by the powerful wind of magery over \nthe great swells of ocean, eastward. Ged kept watch from dusk till dawn, for in darkness \nthe force that drew or drove him grew stronger yet. Always he watched ahead, though \nhis eyes in the moonless night could see no more than the painted eyes aside the boat's \nblind prow. By daybreak his dark face was grey with weariness, and he was so cramped \nwith cold that he could hardly stretch out to rest. He said whispering, \"Hold the \nmagewind from the west, Estarriol,\" and then he slept.\nThere was no sunrise, and presently rain came beating across the bow from the \nnortheast. It was no storm, only the long, cold winds and rains of winter. Soon all things \nin the open boat were wet through, despite the sailcloth cover they had bought; and \nVetch felt as if he too were soaked clear to the bone; and Ged shivered in his sleep. In \npity for his friend, and perhaps for himself, Vetch tried to turn aside for a little that rude \nceaseless wind that bore the rain. But though, following Ged's will, he could keep the \nmagewind strong and steady, his weatherworking had small power here so far from land, \nand the wind of the Open Sea did not listen to his voice.\n",

When day \ncame the world's wind slackened somewhat, and the sun shone fitfully; but the great \nswells ran so high that Lookfar must tilt and climb up them as if they were hills, and \nhang at the hillcrest and plunge suddenly, and climb up the next again, and the next, and \nthe next, unending.\nIn the evening of that day Vetch spoke out of long silence. \"My friend,\" he said, \n\"you spoke once as if sure we would come to land at last. I would not question your \nvision but for this, that it might be a trick, a deception made by that which you follow, to \nlure you on farther than a man can go over ocean. For our power may change and \nweaken on strange seas. And a shadow does not tire, or starve, or drown.\"\nThey sat side by side on the thwart, yet Ged looked at him now as if from a \ndistance, across a wide abyss. His eyes were troubled, and he was slow to answer.\nAt last he said, \"Estarriol, we are coming near.\"\nHearing his words, his friend knew them to be true. He was afraid, then. But he \nput his hand on Ged's shoulder and said only, \"Well, then, good; that is good.\"\nAgain that night Ged watched, for he could not sleep in the dark. Nor would he \nsleep when the third day came. Still they ran with that ceaseless, light, terrible swiftness \nover the sea, and Vetch wondered at Ged's power that could hold so strong a magewind \nhour after hour, here on the Open Sea where Vetch felt his own power all weakened and \nastray. And they went on, until it seemed to Vetch that what Ged had spoken would \ncome true, and they were going beyond the sources of the sea and eastward behind the \ngates of daylight. Ged stayed forward in the boat, looking ahead as always. But he was \nnot watching the ocean now, or not the ocean that Vetch saw, a waste of heaving water to \nthe rim of the sky. In Ged's eyes there was a dark vision that overlapped and veiled the \ngrey sea and the grey sky, and the darkness grew, and the veil thickened. None of this \nwas visible to Vetch, except when he looked at his friend's face; then he too saw the \ndarkness for a moment. They went on, and on. And it was as if, though one wind drove \nthem in one boat, Vetch went east over the world's sea, while Ged went alone into a \nrealm where there was no east or west, no rising or setting of the sun, or of the stars.\nGed stood up suddenly in the prow, and spoke aloud. The magewind dropped. \nLookfar lost headway, and rose and fell on the vast surges like a chip of wood. Though \nthe world's wind blew strong as ever straight from the north now, the brown sail hung \n",

And so the boat hung on the waves, swung by their great slow swinging, \nbut going no direction.\nGed said, \"Take down the sail,\" and Vetch did so quickly, while Ged unlashed the \noars and set them in the locks and bent his back to rowing.\nVetch, seeing only the waves heaving up and down clear to the end of sight could \nnot understand why they went now by oars; but he waited, and presently he was aware \nthat the world's wind was growing faint and the swells diminishing. The climb and \nplunge of the boat grew less and less, till at last she seemed to go forward under Ged's \nstrong oarstrokes over water that lay almost still, as in a land-locked bay. And though \nVetch could not see what Ged saw, when between his strokes he looked ever and again \nover his shoulder at what lay before the boat's way - though Vetch could not see the dark \nslopes beneath unmoving stars, yet he began to see with his wizard's eye a darkness that \nwelled up in the hollows of the waves all around the boat, and he saw the billows grow \nlow and sluggish as they were choked with sand.\nIf this were an enchantment of illusion, it was powerful beyond belief; to make the \nOpen Sea seem land. Trying to collect his wits and courage, Vetch spoke the Revelation-\nspell, watching between each slow-syllabled word for change or tremor of illusion in \nthis strange drying and shallowing of the abyss of ocean. But there was none. Perhaps \nthe spell, though it should affect only his own vision and not the magic at work about \nthem, had no power here. Or perhaps there was no illusion, and they had come to world's \nend.\nUnheeding, Ged rowed always slower, looking over his shoulder, choosing a way \namong channels or shoals and shallows that he alone could see. The boat shuddered as \nher keel dragged. Under that keel lay the vast deeps of the sea, yet they were aground. \nGed drew the oars up rattling in their locks, and that noise was terrible, for there was no \nother sound. All sounds of water, wind, wood, sail, were gone, lost in a huge profound \nsilence that might have been unbroken forever. The boat lay motionless. No breath of \nwind moved. The sea had turned to sand, shadowy, unstirred. Nothing moved in the dark \nsky or on that dry unreal ground that went on and on into gathering darkness all around \nthe boat as far as eye could see.\nGed stood up, and took his staff, and lightly stepped over the side of the boat. \nVetch thought to see him fall and sink down in the sea, the sea that surely was there \nbehind this dry, dim veil that hid away water, sky, and light. But there was no sea any \nmore. Ged walked away from the boat. The dark sand showed his footprints where he \nwent, and whispered a little under his step.\nHis staff began to shine, not with the werelight but with a clear white glow, that \n",

There were no \ndirections here, no north or south or east or west, only towards and away.\nTo Vetch, watching, the light he bore seemed like a great slow star that moved \nthrough the darkness. And the darkness about it thickened, blackened, drew together. \nThis also Ged saw, watching always ahead through the light. And after a while he saw at \nthe faint outermost edge of the light a shadow that came towards him over the sand.\nAt first it was shapeless, but as it drew nearer it took on the look of a man. An old \nman it seemed, grey and grim, coming towards Ged; but even as Ged saw his father the \nsmith in that figure, he saw that it was not an old man but a young one. It was Jasper: \nJasper's insolent handsome young face, and silver-clasped grey cloak, and stiff stride. \nHateful was the look he fixed on Ged across the dark intervening air. Ged did not stop, \nbut slowed his pace, and as he went forward he raised his staff up a little higher. It \nbrightened, and in its light the look of Jasper fell from the figure that approached, and it \nbecame Pechvarry. But Pechvarry's face was all bloated and pallid like the face of a \ndrowned man, and he reached out his hand strangely as if beckoning. Still Ged did not \nstop, but went forward, though there were only a few yards left between them now. Then \nthe thing that faced him changed utterly, spreading out to either side as if it opened \nenormous thin wings, and it writhed, and swelled, and shrank again. Ged saw in it for an \ninstant Skiorh's white face, and then a pair of clouded, staring eyes, and then suddenly a \nfearful face he did not know, man or monster, with writhing lips and eyes that were like \npits going back into black emptiness.\nAt that Ged lifted up the staff high, and the radiance of it brightened intolerably, \nburning with so white and great a light that it compelled and harrowed even that ancient \ndarkness. In that light all form of man sloughed off the thing that came towards Ged. It \ndrew together and shrank and blackened, crawling on four short taloned legs upon the \nsand. But still it came forward, lifting up to him a blind unformed snout without lips or \nears or eyes. As they came right together it became utterly black in the white mage-\nradiance that burned about it, and it heaved itself upright. In silence, man and shadow \nmet face to face, and stopped.\nAloud and clearly, breaking that old silence, Ged spoke the shadow's name and in \nthe same moment the shadow spoke without lips or tongue, saying the same word: \n\"Ged.\" And the two voices were one voice.\nGed reached out his hands, dropping his staff, and took hold of his shadow, of the \nblack self that reached out to him. Light and darkness met, and joined, and were one.\n",

    "chunk_full": "But to Vetch, watching in terror through the dark twilight from far off over the \nsand, it seemed that Ged was overcome, for he saw the clear radiance fail and grow dim. \nRage and despair filled him, and he sprang out on the sand to help his friend or die with \nhim, and ran towards that small fading glimmer of light in the empty dusk of the dry \nland. But as he ran the sand sank under his feet, and he struggled in it as in quicksand, as \nthrough a heavy flow of water: until with a roar of noise and a glory of daylight, and the \nbitter cold of winter, and the bitter taste of salt, the world was restored to him and he \nfloundered in the sudden, true, and living sea.\nNearby the boat rocked on the grey waves, empty. Vetch could see nothing else on \nthe water; the battering wavetops filled his eyes and blinded him. No strong swimmer, \nhe struggled as best he could to the boat, and pulled himself up into her. Coughing and \ntrying to wipe away the water that streamed from his hair, he looked about desperately, \nnot knowing now which way to look. And at last he made out something dark among the \nwaves, a long way off across what had been sand and now was wild water. Then he leapt \nto the oars and rowed mightily to his friend, and catching Ged's arms helped and hauled \nhim up over the side.\nGed was dazed and his eyes stared as if they saw nothing, but there was no hurt to \nbe seen on him. His staff, black yew wood, all radiance quenched, was grasped in his \nright hand, and he would not let go of it. He said no word. Spent and soaked and shaking \nhe lay huddled up against the mast, never looking at Vetch who raised the sail and turned \nthe boat to catch the north-east wind. He saw nothing of the world until, straight ahead \nof their course, in the sky that darkened where the sun had set, between long clouds in a \nbay of clear blue light, the new moon shone: a ring of ivory, a rim of horn, reflected \nsunlight shining across the ocean of the dark.\nGed lifted his face and gazed at that remote bright crescent in the west.\nHe gazed for a long time, and then he stood up erect, holding his staff in his two \nhands as a warrior holds his long sword. He looked about at the sky, the sea, the brown \nswelling sail above him, his friend's face.\n\"Estarriol,\" he said, \"look, it is done. It is over.\" He laughed. \"The wound is \nhealed,\" he said, \"I am whole, I am free.\" Then he bent over and hid his face in his arms, \nweeping like a boy.\nUntil that moment Vetch had watched him with an anxious dread, for he was not \nsure what had happened there in the dark land. He did not know if this was Ged in the \nboat with him, and his hand had been for hours ready to the anchor, to stave in the boat's \nplanking and sink her there in midsea, rather than carry back to the harbors of Earthsea \nthe evil thing that he feared might have taken Ged's look and form.

And he began to see the truth, that \nGed had neither lost nor won but, naming the shadow of his death with his own name, \nhad made himself whole: a man: who, knowing his whole true self, cannot be used or \npossessed by any power other than himself, and whose life therefore is lived for life's \nsake and never in the service of ruin, or pain, or hatred, or the dark. In the Creation of \nEa, which is the oldest song, it is said, \"Only in silence the word, only in dark the light, \nonly in dying life: bright the hawk's flight on the empty sky.\" That song Vetch sang \naloud now as he held the boat westward, going before the cold wind of the winter night \nthat blew at their backs from the vastness of the Open Sea.\nEight days they sailed and eight again, before they came in sight of land. Many \ntimes they had to refill their waterskin with spell-sweetened water of the sea; and they \nfished, but even when they called out fisherman's charms they caught very little, for the \nfish of the Open Sea do not know their own names and pay no heed to magic. When \nthey had nothing left to eat but a few scraps of smoked meat Ged remembered what \nYarrow had said when he stole the cake from the hearth, that he would regret his theft \nwhen he came to hunger on the sea; but hungry as he was the remembrance pleased him. \nFor she had also said that he, with her brother, would come home again.\nThe magewind had borne them for only three days eastward, yet sixteen days they \nsailed westward to return. No men have ever returned from so far out on the Open Sea as \ndid the young wizards Estarriol and Ged in the Fallows of winter in their open \nfishingboat. They met no great Storms, and steered steadily enough by the compass and \nby the star Tolbegren, taking a course somewhat northward of their outbound way. Thus \nthey did not come back to Astowell, but passing by Far Toly and Sneg without sighting \nthem, first raised land off the southernmost cape of Koppish. Over the waves they saw \ncliffs of stone rise like a great fortress. Seabirds cried wheeling over the breakers, and \nsmoke of the hearthfires of small villages drifted blue on the wind.\nFrom there the voyage to Iffish was not long. They came in to Ismay harbor on a \nstill, dark evening before snow. They tied up the boat Lookfar that had borne them to the \ncoasts of death's kingdom and back, and went up through the narrow streets to the \nwizard's house. Their hearts were very light as they entered into the firelight and warmth \nunder that roof; and Yarrow ran to meet them, crying with joy.\n",

Come home!”\n\nIn the deep valley, in the twilight, the apple trees were on the eve of\nblossoming; here and there among the shadowed boughs one flower had opened\nearly, rose and white, like a faint star. Down the orchard aisles, in the\nthick, new, wet grass, the little girl ran for the joy of running; hearing the\ncall she did not come at once, but made a long circle before she turned her\nface towards home. The mother waiting in the doorway of the hut, with the\nfirelight behind her, watched the tiny figure running and bobbing like a bit\nof thistledown blown over the darkening grass beneath the trees.\n\nBy the corner of the hut, scraping clean an earthclotted hoe, the father said,\n“Why do you let your heart hang on the child? They’re coming to take her away\nnext month. For good. Might as well bury her and be done with it. What’s the\ngood of clinging to one you’re bound to lose? She’s no good to us. If they’d\npay for her when they took her, that would be something, but they won’t.\nThey’ll take her and that’s an end of it.”\n\nThe mother said nothing, watching the child who had stopped to look up through\nthe trees. Over the high hills, above the orchards, the evening star shone\npiercing clear.\n\n“She isn’t ours, she never was since they came here and said she must be the\nPriestess at the Tombs. Why can’t you see that?” The man’s voice was harsh\nwith complaint and bitterness. “You have four others. They’ll stay here, and\nthis one won’t. So, don’t set your heart on her. Let her go!”\n\n“When the time comes,” the woman said, “I will let her go.” She bent to meet\nthe child who came running on little, bare, white feet across the muddy\nground, and gathered her up in her arms. As she turned to enter the hut she\nbent her head to kiss the child’s hair, which was black; but her own hair, in\nthe flicker of firelight from the hearth, was fair.\n\nThe man stood outside, his own feet bare and cold on the ground, the clear sky\nof spring darkening above him. His face in the dusk was full of grief, a dull,\nheavy, angry grief that he would never find the words to say. At last he\nshrugged, and followed his wife into the firelit room that rang with\nchildren’s voices.\n\n\n#  The Eaten One\n\nOne high horn shrilled and ceased. The silence that followed was shaken only\nby the sound of many footsteps keeping time with a drum struck softly at a\nslow heartpace. Through cracks in the roof of the Hall of the Throne, gaps\nbetween columns where a whole section of masonry and tile had collapsed,\nunsteady sunlight shone aslant. It was an hour after sunrise. The air was\nstill and cold. Dead leaves of weeds that had forced up between marble\npavement-tiles were outlined with frost, and crackled, catching on the long\nblack robes of the priestesses.\n\nThey came, four by four, down the vast hall between double rows of columns.\nThe drum beat dully. No voice spoke, no eye watched. Torches carried by black-\nclad girls burned reddish in the shafts of sunlight, brighter in the dusk\nbetween. Outside, on the steps of the Hall of the Throne, the men stood,\nguards, trumpeters, drummers; within the great doors only women had come,\ndark-robed and hooded, walking slowly four by four towards the empty throne.\n\nTwo came, tall women looming in their black, one of them thin and rigid, the\nother heavy, swaying with the planting of her feet. Between these two walked a\nchild of about six. She wore a straight white shift. Her head and arms and\nlegs were bare, and she was barefoot. She looked extremely small. At the foot\nof the steps leading up to the throne, where the others now waited in dark\nrows, the two tall women halted. They pushed the child forward a little.\n\nThe throne on its high platform seemed to be curtained on each side with great\nwebs of blackness dropping from the gloom of the roof; whether these were\ncurtains, or only denser shadows, the eye could not make certain. The throne\nitself was black, with a dull glimmer of precious stones or gold on the arms\nand back, and it was huge. A man sitting in it would have been dwarfed; it was\nnot of human dimensions. It was empty. Nothing sat in it but shadows.\n\nAlone, the child climbed up four of the seven steps of red-veined marble. They\nwere so broad and high that she had to get both feet onto one step before\nattempting the next. On the middle step, directly in front of the throne,\nstood a large, rough block of wood, hollowed out on top. The child knelt on\nboth knees and fitted her head into the hollow, turning it a little sideways.\nShe knelt there without moving.\n\nA figure in a belted gown of white wool stepped suddenly out of the shadows at\nthe right of the throne and strode down the steps to the child. His face was\nmasked with white. He held a sword of polished steel five feet long. Without\nword or hesitation he swung the sword, held in both hands, up over the little\ngirl’s neck. The drum stopped beating.\n\nAs the blade swung to its highest point and poised, a figure in black darted\nout from the left side of the throne, leapt down the stairs, and stayed the\nsacrificer’s arms with slenderer arms. The sharp edge of the sword glittered\nin mid-air. So they balanced for a moment, the white figure and the black,\nboth faceless, dancer-like above the motionless child whose white neck was\nbared by the parting of her black hair.\n\nIn silence each leapt aside and up the stairs again, vanishing in the darkness\nbehind the enormous throne. A priestess came forward and poured out a bowl of\nsome liquid on the steps beside the kneeling child. The stain looked black in\nthe dimness of the hall.\n\nThe child got up and descended the four stairs laboriously. When she stood at\nthe bottom, the two tall priestesses put on her a black robe and hood and\nmantle, and turned her around again to face the steps, the dark stain, the\nthrone.\n\n“O let the Nameless Ones behold the girl given to them, who is verily the one\nborn ever nameless. Let them accept her life and the years of her life until\nher death, which is also theirs. Let them find her acceptable. Let her be\neaten!”\n\nOther voices, shrill and harsh as trumpets, replied: “She is eaten! She is\neaten!”\n\nThe little girl stood looking from under her black cowl up at the throne. The\njewels inset in the huge clawed arms and the back were glazed with dust, and\non the carven back were cobwebs and whitish stains of owl droppings. The three\nhighest steps directly before the throne, above the step on which she had\nknelt, had never been climbed by mortal feet. They were so thick with dust\nthat they looked like one slant of gray soil, the planes of the red-veined\nmarble wholly hidden by the unstirred, untrodden siftings of how many years,\nhow many centuries.\n\n“She is eaten! She is eaten!”\n\nNow the drum, abrupt, began to sound again, beating a quicker pace.\n\nSilent and shuffling, the procession formed and moved away from the throne,\neastward towards the bright, distant square of the doorway. On either side,\nthe thick double columns, like the calves of immense pale legs, went up to the\ndusk under the ceiling. Among the priestesses, and now all in black like them,\nthe child walked, her small bare feet treading solemnly over the frozen weeds,\nthe icy stones. When sunlight slanting through the ruined roof flashed across\nher way, she did not look up.\n\nGuards held the great doors wide. The black procession came out into the thin,\ncold light and wind of early morning. The sun dazzled, swimming above the\neastern vastness. Westward, the mountains caught its yellow light, as did the\nfacade of the Hall of the Throne. The other buildings, lower on the hill,\nstill lay in purplish shadow, except for the Temple of the God-Brothers across\nthe way on a little knoll: its roof, newly gilt, flashed the day back in\nglory. The black line of priestesses, four by four, wound down the Hill of the\nTombs, and as they went they began softly to chant. The tune was on three\nnotes only, and the word that was repeated over and over was a word so old it\nhad lost its meaning, like a signpost still standing when the road is gone.\nOver and over they chanted the empty word. All that day of the Remaking of the\nPriestess was filled with the low chanting of women’s voices, a dry unceasing\ndrone.\n\nThe little girl was taken from room to room, from temple to temple. In one\nplace salt was placed upon her tongue; in another she knelt facing west while\nher hair was cut short and washed with oil and scented vinegar; in another she\nlay face down on a slab of black marble behind an altar while shrill voices\nsang a lament for the dead. Neither she nor any of the priestesses ate food or\ndrank water all that day. As the evening star set, the little girl was put to\nbed, naked between sheepskin rugs, in a room she had never slept in before. It\nwas in a house that had been locked for years, unlocked only that day. The\nroom was higher than it was long, and had no windows. There was a dead smell\nin it, still and stale. The silent women left her there in the dark.\n\nShe held still, lying just as they had put her. Her eyes were wide open. She\nlay so for a long time.\n\nShe saw light shake on the high wall. Someone came quietly along the corridor,\nshielding a rushlight so it showed no more light than a firefly. A husky\nwhisper: “Ho, are you there, Tenar?”\n\nThe child did not reply.\n\nA head poked in the doorway, a strange head, hairless as a peeled potato, and\nof the same yellowish color. The eyes were like potato-eyes, brown and tiny.\nThe nose was dwarfed by great, fiat slabs of cheek, and the mouth was a\nlipless slit. The child stared unmoving at this face. Her eyes were large,\ndark, and fixed.\n\n“Ho, Tenar, my little honeycomb, there you are!” The voice was husky, high as\na woman’s voice but not a woman’s voice. “I shouldn’t be here, I belong\noutside the door, on the porch, that’s where I go. But I had to see how my\nlittle Tenar is, after all the long day of it, eh, how’s my poor little\nhoneycomb?”\n\nHe moved towards her, noiseless and burly, and put out his hand as if to\nsmooth back her hair.\n\n“I am not Tenar any more,” the child said, staring up at him. His hand\nstopped; he did not touch her.\n\n“No,” he said, after a moment, whispering. “I know. I know. Now you’re the\nlittle Eaten One. But I...”\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n“It was a hard day for a little one,” the man said, shuffling, the tiny light\nflickering in his big yellow hand.\n\n“You should not be in this House, Manan.”\n\n“No. No. I know. I shouldn’t be in this House. Well, good night, little one...\nGood night.”\n\nThe child said nothing. Manan slowly turned around and went away. The glimmer\ndied from the high cell walls. The little girl, who had no name any more but\nArha, the Eaten One, lay on her back looking steadily at the dark.\n\n\n#  The Wall Around the Place\n\nAs she grew older she lost all remembrance of her mother, without knowing she\nhad lost it. She belonged here, at the Place of the Tombs; she had always\nbelonged here. Only sometimes in the long evenings of July as she watched the\nwestern mountains, dry and lion-colored in the afterglow of sunset, she would\nthink of a fire that had burned on a hearth, long ago, with the same clear\nyellow light. And with this came a memory of being held, which was strange,\nfor here she was seldom even touched; and the memory of a pleasant smell, the\nfragrance of hair freshly washed and rinsed in sage-scented water, fair long\nhair, the color of sunset and firelight. That was all she had left.\n\nShe knew more than she remembered, of course, for she had been told the whole\nstory. When she was seven or eight years old, and first beginning to wonder\nwho indeed this person called “Arha” was, she had gone to her guardian, the\nWarden Manan, and said, “Tell me how I was chosen, Manan.”\n\n“Oh, you know all that, little one.”\n\nAnd indeed she did; the tall, dry-voiced priestess Thar had told her till she\nknew the words by heart, and she recited them: “Yes, I know. At the death of\nthe One Priestess of the Tombs of Atuan, the ceremonies of burial and\npurification are completed within one month by the moon’s calendar. After this\ncertain of the Priestesses and Wardens of the Place of the Tombs go forth\nacross the desert, among the towns and villages of Atuan, seeking and asking.\nThey seek the girl-child who was born on the night of the Priestess’ death.\nWhen they find such a child, they wait and they watch. The child must be sound\nof body and of mind, and as it grows it must not suffer from rickets nor the\nsmallpox nor any deformity, nor become blind. If it reaches the age of five\nyears unblemished, then it is known that the body of the child is indeed the\nnew body of the Priestess who died. And the child is made known to the Godking\nin Awabath, and brought here to her Temple and instructed for a year. And at\nthe year’s end she is taken to the Hall of the Throne and her name is given\nback to those who are her Masters, the Nameless Ones: for she is the nameless\none, the Priestess Ever Reborn.”\n\nThis was all word for word as Thar had told her, and she had never dared ask\nfor a word more. The thin priestess was not cruel, but she was very cold and\nlived by an iron law, and Arha was in awe of her. But she was not in awe of\nManan, far from it, and she would command him, “Now tell me how I was chosen!”\nAnd he would tell her again.\n\n“We left here, going north and west, in the third day of the moon’s waxing;\nfor Arha-that-was had died in the third day of the last moon. And first we\nwent to Tenacbah, which is a great city, though those who’ve seen both say\nit’s no more to Awabath than a flea to a cow. But it’s big enough for me,\nthere must be ten hundred houses in Tenacbahl And we went on to Gar. But\nnobody in those cities had a baby girl born to them on the third day of the\nmoon a month before; there were some had boys, but boys won’t do... So we went\ninto the hill country north of Gar, to the towns and villages. That’s my own\nland. I was born in the hills there, where the rivers run, and the land is\ngreen. Not in this desert.” Manan’s husky voice would get a strange sound when\nhe said that, and his small eyes would be quite hidden in their folds; he\nwould pause a little, and at last go on. “And so we found and spoke to all\nthose who were parents of babies born in the last months. And some would lie\nto us. ‘Oh yes, surely our baby girl was born on the moon’s third day!’ For\npoor folk, you know, are often glad to get rid of girl-babies. And there were\nothers who were so poor, living in lonely huts in the valleys of the hills,\nthat they kept no count of days and scarce knew how to tell the turn of time,\nso they could not say for certain how old their baby was. But we could always\ncome at the truth, by asking long enough. But it was slow work. At last we\nfound a girlchild, in a village of ten houses, in the orchard-vales westward\nof Entat. Eight months old she was, so long had we been looking. But she had\nbeen born on the night that the Priestess of the Tombs had died, and within\nthe very hour of her death. And she was a fine baby, sitting up on her\nmother’s knee and looking with bright eyes at all of us, crowding into the one\nroom of the house like bats into a cave! The father was a poor man. He tended\nthe apple trees of the rich man’s orchard, and had nothing of his own but five\nchildren and a goat. Not even the house was his. So there we all crowded in,\nand you could tell by the way the priestesses looked at the baby and spoke\namong themselves that they thought they had found the Reborn One at last. And\nthe mother could tell this too. She held the baby and never said a word. Well,\nso, the next day we came back. And look here! The little bright-eyed baby\nlying in a cot of rushes weeping and screaming, and all over its body weals\nand red rashes of fever, and the mother wailing louder than the baby, ‘Oh! Oh!\nMy babe hath the Witch-Fingers on her!’ That’s how she said it; the smallpox\nshe meant. In my village, too, they called it the Witch-Fingers. But Kossil,\nshe who is now the High Priestess of the Godking, she went to the cot and\npicked up the baby. The others had all drawn back, and I with them; I don’t\nvalue my life very high, but who enters a house where smallpox is? But she had\nno fear, not that one. She picked up the baby and said, ‘It has no fever.’ And\nshe spat on her finger and rubbed at the red marks, and they came off. They\nwere only berry juice. The poor silly mother had thought to fool us and keep\nher child!” Manan laughed heartily at this; his yellow face hardly changed,\nbut his sides heaved. “So, her husband beat her, for he was afraid of the\nwrath of the priestesses. And soon we came back to the desert, but each year\none of the people of the Place would return to the village among the apple\norchards, and see how the child got on. So five years passed, and then Thar\nand Kossil made the journey, with the Temple guards, and soldiers of the red\nhelmet sent by the Godking to escort them safely. They brought the child back\nhere, for it was indeed the Priestess of the Tombs reborn, and here it\nbelonged. And who was the child, eh, little one?”\n\n“Me,” said Arha, looking off into the distance as if to see something she\ncould not see, something gone out of sight.\n\nOnce she asked, “What did the... the mother do, when they came to take the\nchild away?”\n\nBut Manan didn’t know; he had not gone with the priestesses on that final\njourney.\n\nAnd she could not remember. What was the good in remembering? It was gone, all\ngone. She had come where she must come. In all the world she knew only one\nplace: the Place of the Tombs of Atuan.\n\nIn her first year there she had slept in the big dormitory with the other\nnovices, girls between four and fourteen. Even then Manan had been set apart\namong the Ten Wardens as her particular guardian, and her cot had been in a\nlittle alcove, partly separated from the long, low-beamed main room of the\ndormitory in the Big House where the girls giggled and whispered before they\nslept, and yawned and plaited one another’s hair in the gray light of morning.\nWhen her name was taken from her and she became Arha, she slept alone in the\nSmall House, in the bed and in the room that would be her bed and her room for\nthe rest of her life. That house was hers, the House of the One Priestess, and\nno one might enter it without her permission. When she was quite little still,\nshe enjoyed hearing people knock submissively on her door, and saying, “You\nmay come in,” and it annoyed her that the two High Priestesses, Kossil and\nThar, took their permission for granted and entered her house without\nknocking.\n\nThe days went by, the years went by, all alike. The girls of the Place of the\nTombs spent their time at classes and disciplines. They did not play any\ngames. There was no time for games. They learned the sacred songs and the\nsacred dances, the histories of the Kargad Lands, and the mysteries of\nwhichever of the gods they were dedicated to: the Godking who ruled in\nAwabath, or the Twin Brothers, Atwah and Wuluah. Of them all, only Arha\nlearned the rites of the Nameless Ones, and these were taught her by one\nperson, Thar, the High Priestess of the Twin Gods. This took her away from the\nothers for an hour or more daily, but most of her day, like theirs, was spent\nsimply working. They learned how to spin and weave the wool of their flocks,\nand how to plant and harvest and prepare the food they always ate: lentils,\nbuckwheat ground to a coarse meal for porridge or a fine flour for unleavened\nbread, onions, cabbages, goat-cheese, apples, and honey.\n\nThe best thing that could happen was to be allowed to go fishing in the murky\ngreen river that flowed through the desert a half mile northeast of the Place;\nto take along an apple or a cold buckwheat bannock for lunch and sit all day\nin the dry sunlight among the reeds, watching the slow green water run and the\ncloudshadows change slowly on the mountains. But if you squealed with\nexcitement when the line tensed and you swung in a flat, glittering fish to\nflop on the riverbank and drown in air, then Mebbeth would hiss like an adder,\n“Be still, you screeching fool!” Mebbeth, who served in the Godking’s temple,\nwas a dark woman, still young, but hard and sharp as obsidian. Fishing was her\npassion. You had to keep on her good side, and never make a sound, or she\nwould not take you out to fish again; and then you’d never get to the river\nexcept to fetch water in summer when the wells ran low. That was a dreary\nbusiness, to trudge through the searing white heat a half mile down to the\nriver, fill the two buckets on their carrying pole, and then set off as fast\nas possible uphill to the Place. The first hundred yards were easy, but then\nthe buckets began to grow heavier, and the pole burned your shoulders like a\nbar of hot iron, and the light glared on the dry road, and every step was\nharder and slower. At last you got to the cool shade of the back courtyard of\nthe Big House by the vegetable patch, and dumped the buckets into the great\ncistern with a splash. And then you had to turn around to do it all over\nagain, and again, and again.\n\nWithin the precincts of the Place -that was all the name it had or needed, for\nit was the most ancient and sacred of all places in the Four Lands of the\nKargish Empire- a couple of hundred people lived, and there were many\nbuildings: three temples, the Big House and the Small House, the quarters of\nthe eunuch wardens, and close outside the wall the guards’ barracks and many\nslaves’ huts, the storehouses and sheep pens and goat pens and farm buildings.\nIt looked like a little town, seen from a distance, from up on the dry hills\nwestward where nothing grew but sage, wire-grass in straggling clumps, small\nweeds and desert herbs. Even from away off on the eastern plains, looking up\none might see the gold roof of the Temple of the Twin Gods wink and glitter\nbeneath the mountains, like a speck of mica in a shelf of rock.\n\nThat temple itself was a cube of stone, plastered white, windowless, with a\nlow porch and door. Showier, and centuries newer, was the Temple of the God-\nking a little below it, with a high portico and a row of thick white columns\nwith painted capitals - each one a solid log of cedar, brought on shipboard\nfrom Hur-atHur where there are forests, and dragged by the straining of twenty\nslaves across the barren plains to the Place. Only after a traveler\napproaching from the east had seen the gold roof and the bright columns would\nhe see, higher up on the Hill of the Place, above them all, tawny and ruinous\nas the desert itself, the oldest of the temples of his race: the huge, low\nHall of the Throne, with patched walls and flattish, crumbling dome.\n\nBehind the Hall and encircling the whole crest of the hill ran a massive wall\nof rock, laid without mortar and half fallen down in many places. Inside the\nloop of the wall several black stones eighteen or twenty feet high stuck up\nlike huge fingers out of the earth. Once the eye saw them it kept returning to\nthem. They stood there full of meaning, and yet there was no saying what they\nmeant. There were nine of them. One stood straight, the others leaned more or\nless, two had fallen. They were crusted with gray and orange lichen as if\nsplotched with paint, all but one, which was naked and black, with a dull\ngloss to it. It was smooth to the touch, but on the others, under the crust of\nlichen, vague carvings could be seen, or felt with the fingers - shapes,\nsigns. These nine stones were the Tombs of Atuan. They had stood there, it was\nsaid, since the time of the first men, since Earthsea was created. They had\nbeen planted in the darkness when the lands were raised up from the ocean’s\ndepths. They were older by far than the God-kings of Kargad, older than the\nTwin Gods, older than light. They were the tombs of those who ruled before the\nworld of men came to be, the ones not named, and she who served them had no\nname.\n\nShe did not go among them often, and no one else ever set foot on that ground\nwhere they stood, on the hilltop within the rock wall behind the Hall of the\nThrone. Twice a year, at the full moon nearest the equinox of spring and of\nautumn, there was a sacrifice before the Throne and she came out from the low\nback door of the Hall carrying a great brass basin full of smoking goat’s\nblood; this she must pour out, half at the foot of the standing black stone,\nhalf over one of the fallen stones which lay embedded in the rocky dirt,\nstained by the blood-offering of centuries.\n\nSometimes Arha went by herself in the early morning and wandered among the\nStones trying to make out the dim humps and scratches of the carvings, brought\nout more clearly by the low angle of the light; or she would sit there and\nlook up at the mountains westward, and down at the roofs and walls of the\nPlace all laid out below, and watch the first stirrings of activity around the\nBig House and the guards’ barracks, and the flocks of sheep and goats going\noff to their sparse pastures by the river. There was never anything to do\namong the Stones. She went only because it was permitted her to go there,\nbecause there she was alone. It was a dreary place. Even in the heat of noon\nin the desert summer there was a coldness about it. Sometimes the wind\nwhistled a little between the two stones that stood closest together, leaning\ntogether as if telling secrets. But no secret was told.\n\nFrom the Tomb Wall another, lower rock wall ran, making a long irregular\nsemicircle about the Hill of the Place and then trailing off northward towards\nthe river. It did not so much protect the Place, as cut it in two: on one side\nthe temples and houses of the priestesses and wardens, on the other the\nquarters of the guards and of the slaves who farmed and herded and foraged for\nthe Place. None of these ever crossed the wall, except that on certain very\nholy festivals the guards, and their drummers and players of the horn, would\nattend the procession of the priestesses; but they did not enter the portals\nof the temples. No other men set foot upon the inner ground of the Place.\nThere had once been pilgrimages, kings and chieftains coming from the Four\nLands to worship there; the first God-king, a century and a half ago, had come\nto enact the rites of his own temple. Yet even he could not enter among the\nTombstones, even he had had to eat and sleep outside the wall around the\nPlace.\n\nOne could climb that wall easily enough, fitting toes into crevices. The Eaten\nOne and a girl called Penthe were sitting up on the wall one afternoon in late\nspring.\n\nThey were both twelve years old. They were supposed to be in the weaving room\nof the Big House, a huge stone attic; they were supposed to be at the great\nlooms always warped with dull black wool, weaving black cloth for robes. They\nhad slipped outside for a drink at the well in the courtyard, and then Arha\nhad said, “Come on!” and had led the other girl down the hill, around out of\nsight of the Big House, to the wall. Now they sat on top of it, ten feet up,\ntheir bare legs dangling down on the outside, looking over the flat plains\nthat went on and on to the east and north.\n\n“I’d like to see the sea,” said Penthe.\n\n“What for?” said Arha, chewing a bitter stem of milkweed she had picked from\nthe wall. The barren land was just past its flowering. All the small desert\nblossoms, yellow and rose and white, low-growing and quick-flowering, were\ngoing to seed, scattering tiny plumes and parasols of ash white on the wind,\ndropping their hooked, ingenious burrs. The ground under the apple trees of\nthe orchard was a drift of bruised white and pink. The branches were green,\nthe only green trees within miles of the Place. Everything else, from horizon\nto horizon, was a dull, tawny, desert color, except that the mountains had a\nsilvery bluish tinge from the first buds of the flowering sage.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know what for. I’d just like to see something different. It’s\nalways the same here. Nothing happens.”\n\n“All that happens everywhere, begins here,” said Arha.\n\n“Oh, I know... But I’d like to see some of it happening!”\n\nPenthe smiled. She was a soft, comfortable-looking girl. She scratched the\nsoles of her bare feet on the sunwarmed rocks, and after a while went on, “You\nknow, I used to live by the sea when I was little. Our village was right\nbehind the dunes, and we used to go down and play on the beach sometimes. Once\nI remember we saw a fleet of ships going by, way out at sea. The ships looked\nlike dragons with red wings. Some of them had real necks, with dragon heads.\nThey came sailing by Atuan, but they weren’t Kargish ships. They came from the\nwest, from the Inner Lands, the headman said. Everybody came down to watch\nthem. I think they were afraid they might land. They just went by, nobody knew\nwhere they were going. Maybe to make war in Karego-At. But think of it, they\nreally came from the sorcerers’ islands, where all the people are the color of\ndirt and they can all cast a spell on you easy as winking.”\n\n“Not on me,” Arha said fiercely. “I wouldn’t have looked at them. They’re vile\naccursed sorcerers. How dare they sail so close to the Holy Land?”\n\n“Oh, well, I suppose the God-king will conquer them some day and make them all\nslaves. But I wish I could see the sea again. There used to be little\noctopuses in the tide pools, and if you shouted ‘Boo!’ at them they turned all\nwhite. -There comes that old Manan, looking for you.”\n\nArha’s guard and servant was coming slowly along the inner side of the wall.\nHe would stoop to pull a wild onion, of which he held a large, limp bunch,\nthen straighten up and look about him with his small, dull, brown eyes. He had\ngrown fatter with the years, and his hairless yellow skin glistened in the\nsun.\n\n“Slide down part way on the men’s side,” Arha hissed, and both girls wriggled\nlithe as lizards down the far side of the wall until they could cling there\njust below the top, invisible from the inner side. They heard Manan’s slow\nfootsteps coming by.\n\n“Hoo! Hoo! Potato face!” crooned Arha, a whispering jeer faint as the wind\namong the grasses.\n\nThe heavy tread halted. “Ho there,” said the uncertain voice. “Little one?\nArha?”\n\nSilence.\n\nManan went forward.\n\n“Hoo-oo! Potato face!”\n\n“Hoo, potato belly!” Penthe whispered in imitation, and then moaned, trying to\nsuppress giggles.\n\n“Somebody there?”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Oh well, well, well,” the eunuch sighed, and his slow feet went on. When he\nwas gone over the shoulder of the slope, the girls scrambled back up onto the\ntop of the wall. Penthe was pink with sweat and giggles, but Arha looked\nsavage.\n\n“The stupid old bellwether, following me around everywhere!”\n\n“He has to,” Penthe said reasonably. “It’s his job, looking after you.”\n\n“Those I serve look after me. I please them; I need please nobody else. These\nold women and half-men, these people should leave me alone. I am the One\nPriestess!”\n\nPenthe stared at the other girl. “Oh,” she said feebly, “oh, I know you are,\nArha-“\n\n“Then they should let me be. And not order me about all the time!”\n\nPenthe said nothing for a while, but sighed, and sat swinging her plump legs\nand gazing at the vast, pale lands below, that rose so slowly to a high,\nvague, immense horizon.\n\n“You’ll get to give the orders pretty soon, you know,” she said at last,\nquietly. “In two more years we won’t be children any more. We’ll be fourteen.\nI’ll go into the Godking’s temple, and things will be about the same for me.\nBut you’ll really be the High Priestess then. Even Kossil and Thar will have\nto obey you.”\n\nThe Eaten One said nothing. Her face was set, her eyes under black brows\ncaught the light of the sky in a pale glitter.\n\n“We ought to go back,” Penthe said.\n\n“No.”\n\n“But the weaving mistress might tell Thar. And soon it’ll be time for the Nine\nChants.”\n\n“I’m staying here. You stay, too.”\n\n“They won’t punish you, but they will punish me,” Penthe said in her mild way.\nArha did not reply. Penthe sighed, and stayed. The sun was sinking into haze\nhigh above the plains. Far away on the long, gradual slant of the land, sheep\nbells clanked faintly and lambs bleated. The spring wind blew in dry, faint\ngusts, sweetsmelling.\n\nThe Nine Chants were nearly over when the two girls returned. Mebbeth had seen\nthem sitting on the ‘Men’s Wall’ and had reported this to her superior,\nKossil, High Priestess of the Godking.\n\nKossil was heavy-footed, heavy-faced. Without expression in face or voice she\nspoke to the two girls, telling them to follow her. She led them through the\nstone hallways of the Big House, out the front door, up the knoll to the\nTemple of Atwah and Wuluah. There she spoke with the High Priestess of that\ntemple, Thar, tall and dry and thin as the legbone of a deer.\n\nKossil said to Penthe, “Take off your gown.”\n\nShe whipped the girl with a bundle of reed canes, which cut the skin a little.\nPenthe bore this patiently, with silent tears. She was sent back to the\nweaving room without supper, and the next day also she would go without food.\n“If you are found climbing over the Men’s Wall again,” Kossil said, “there\nwill be very much worse things than this happen to you. Do you understand,\nPenthe?” Kossil’s voice was soft, but not kindly. Penthe said, “Yes,” and\nslipped away, cowering and flinching as her heavy clothing rubbed the cuts on\nher back.\n\nArha had stood beside Thar to watch the whipping. Now she watched Kossil clean\nthe canes of the whip.\n\nThar said to her, “It is not fitting that you be seen climbing and running\nwith other girls. You are Arha.”\n\nShe stood sullen and did not reply.\n\n“It is better that you do only what is needful for you to do. You are Arha.”\n\nFor a moment the girl raised her eyes to Thar’s face, then to Kossil’s, and\nthere was a depth of hate or rage in her look that was terrible to see. But\nthe thin priestess showed no concern; rather she confirmed, leaning forward a\nlittle, almost whispering, “You are Arha. There is nothing left. It was all\neaten.”\n\n“It was all eaten,” the girl repeated, as she had repeated daily, all the days\nof her life since she was six.\n\nThar bowed her head slightly; so did Kossil, as she put away the whip. The\ngirl did not bow, but turned submissively and left.\n\nAfter the supper of potatoes and spring onions, eaten in silence in the\nnarrow, dark refectory, after the chanting of the evening hymns, and the\nplacing of the sacred words upon the doors, and the brief Ritual of the\nUnspoken, the work of the day was done. Now the girls might go up to the\ndormitory and play games with dice and sticks, so long as the single rushlight\nburned, and whisper in the dark from bed to bed. Arha set off across the\ncourts and slopes of the Place as she did every night, to the Small House\nwhere she slept alone.\n\nThe night wind was sweet. The stars of spring shone thick, like drifts of\ndaisies in spring meadows, like the glittering of light on the April sea. But\nthe girl had no memory of meadows or the sea. She did not look up.\n\n“Ho there, little one!”\n\n“Manan,” she said indifferently.\n\nThe big shadow shuffled up beside her, starlight glinting on his hairless\npate.\n\n“Were you punished?”\n\n“I can’t be punished.”\n\n“No... That’s so...”\n\n“They can’t punish me. They don’t dare.”\n\nHe stood with his big hands hanging, dim and bulky. She smelled wild onion,\nand the sweaty, sagey smell of his old black robes, which were torn at the\nhem, and too short for him.\n\n“They can’t touch me. I am Arha,” she said in a shrill, fierce voice, and\nburst into tears.\n\nThe big, waiting hands came up and drew her to him, held her gently, smoothed\nher braided hair. “There, there. Little honeycomb, little girl...” She heard\nthe husky murmur in the deep hollow of his chest, and clung to him. Her tears\nstopped soon, but she held onto Manan as if she could not stand up.\n\n“Poor little one,” he whispered, and picking the child up carried her to the\ndoorway of the house where she slept alone. He set her down.\n\n“All right now, little one?”\n\nShe nodded, turned from him, and entered the dark house.\n\n\n#  The Prisoners\n\nKossil’s steps sounded along the hallway of the Small House, even and\ndeliberate. The tall, heavy figure filled the doorway of the room, shrank as\nthe priestess bowed down touching one knee to the floor, swelled as she\nstraightened to her full height.\n\n“Mistress.”\n\n“What is it, Kossil?”\n\n“I have been permitted to look after certain matters pertaining to the Domain\nof the Nameless Ones, until now. If you so desire, it is now time for you to\nlearn, and see, and take charge of these matters, which you have not yet\nremembered in this life.”\n\nThe girl had been sitting in her windowless room, supposedly meditating,\nactually doing nothing and thinking almost nothing. It took some time for the\nfixed, dull, haughty expression of her face to change. Yet it did change,\nthough she tried to conceal it. She said, with a certain slyness, “The\nLabyrinth?”\n\n“We will not enter the Labyrinth. But it will be necessary to cross the\nUndertomb.”\n\nThere was a tone in Kossil’s voice that might have been fear, or might have\nbeen a pretense of fear, intended to frighten Arha. The girl stood up without\nhaste and said indifferently, “Very well.” But in her heart, as she followed\nthe heavy figure of the Godking’s priestess, she exulted: At last! At last! I\nshall see my own domain at last!\n\nShe was fifteen. It was over a year since she had made her crossing into\nwomanhood and at the same time had come into her full powers as the One\nPriestess of the Tombs of Atuan, highest of all high priestesses of the Kargad\nLands, one whom not even the Godking himself might command. They all bowed the\nknee to her now, even grim Thar and Kossil. All spoke to her with elaborate\ndeference. But nothing had changed. Nothing happened. Once the ceremonies of\nher consecration were over, the days went on as they had always gone. There\nwas wool to be spun, black cloth to be woven, meal to be ground, rites to be\nperformed; the Nine Chants must be sung nightly, the doorways blessed, the\nStones fed with goat’s blood twice a year, the dances of the dark of the moon\ndanced before the Empty Throne. And so the whole year had passed, just as the\nyears before it had passed, and were all the years of her life to pass so?\n\nHer boredom rose so strong in her sometimes that it felt like terror: it took\nher by the throat. Not long ago she had been driven to speak of it. She had to\ntalk, she thought, or she would go mad. It was Manan she talked to. Pride kept\nher from confiding in the other girls, and caution kept her from confession to\nthe older women, but Manan was nothing, a faithful old bellwether; it didn’t\nmatter what she said to him. To her surprise he had had an answer for her.\n\n“Long ago,” he said, “you know, little one, before our four lands joined\ntogether into an empire, before there was a Godking over us all, there were a\nlot of lesser kings, princes, chiefs. They were always quarreling with each\nother. And they’d come here to settle their quarrels. That was how it was,\nthey’d come from our land Atuan, and from Karego-At, and Atnini, and even from\nHur-at-Hur, all the chiefs and princes with their servants and their armies.\nAnd they’d ask you what to do. And you’d go before the Empty Throne, and give\nthem the counsel of the Nameless Ones. Well, that was long ago. After a while\nthe Priest-Kings came to rule all of Karego-At, and soon they were ruling\nAtuan; and now for four or five lifetimes of men the Godkings have ruled all\nthe four lands together, and made them an empire. And so things are changed.\nThe Godking can put down the unruly chiefs, and settle all the quarrels\nhimself. And being a god, you see, he doesn’t have to consult the Nameless\nOnes very often.”\n\nArha stopped to think this over. Time did not mean very much, here in the\ndesert land, under the unchanging Stones, leading a life that had been led in\nthe same way since the beginning of the world. She was not accustomed to\nthinking about things changing, old ways dying and new ones arising. She did\nnot find it comfortable to look at things in that light. “The powers of the\nGodking are much less than the powers of the Ones I serve,” she said,\nfrowning.\n\n“Surely... Surely... But one doesn’t go about saying that to a god, little\nhoneycomb. Nor to his priestess.”\n\nAnd catching his small, brown, twinkling eye, she thought of Kissil, High\nPriestess of the Godking, whom she had feared ever since she first came to the\nPlace; and she took his meaning.\n\n“But the Godking, and his people, are neglecting the worship of the Tombs. No\none comes.”\n\n“Well, he sends prisoners here to sacrifice. He doesn’t neglect that. Nor the\ngifts due to the Nameless Ones.”\n\n“Gifts! His temple is painted fresh every year, there’s a hundredweight of\ngold on the altar, the lamps burn attar of roses! And look at the Hall of the\nThrone- holes in the roof, and the dome cracking, and the walls full of mice,\nand owls, and bats... But all the same it will outlast the Godking and all his\ntemples, and all the kings that come after him. It was there before them, and\nwhen they’re all gone it will still be there. It is the center of things.”\n\n“It is the center of things.”\n\n“There are riches there; Thar tells me about them sometimes. Enough to fill\nthe Godking’s temple ten times over. Gold and trophies given ages ago, a\nhundred generations, who knows how long. They’re all locked away in the pits\nand vaults, underground. They won’t take me there yet, they keep me waiting\nand waiting. But I know what it’s like. There are rooms underneath the Hall,\nunderneath the whole Place, under where we stand now. There’s a great maze of\ntunnels, a Labyrinth. It’s like a great dark city, under the hill. Full of\ngold, and the swords of old heroes, and old crowns, and bones, and years, and\nsilence.”\n\nShe spoke as if in trance, in rapture. Manan watched her. His slabby face\nnever expressed much but stolid, careful sadness; it was sadder than usual\nnow. “Well, and you’re mistress of all that,” he said. “The silence, and the\ndark.”\n\n“I am. But they won’t show me anything, only the rooms above ground, behind\nthe Throne. They haven’t even shown me the entrances to the places\nunderground; they just mumble about them sometimes. They’re keeping my own\ndomain from me! Why do they make me wait and wait?”\n\n“You are young. And perhaps,” Manan said in his husky alto, “perhaps they’re\nafraid, little one. It’s not their domain, after all. It’s yours. They are in\ndanger when they enter there. There’s no mortal that doesn’t fear the Nameless\nOnes.”\n\nArha said nothing, but her eyes flashed. Again Manan had shown her a new way\nof seeing things. So formidable, so cold, so strong had Thar and Kossil always\nseemed to her, that she had never even imagined their being afraid. Yet Manan\nwas right. They feared those places, those powers of which Arha was part, to\nwhich she belonged. They were afraid to go into the dark places, lest they be\neaten.\n\nNow, as she went with Kossil down the steps of the Small House and up the\nsteep winding path towards the Hall of the Throne, she recalled that\nconversation with Manan, and exulted again. No matter where they took her,\nwhat they showed her, she would not be afraid. She would know her way.\n\nA little behind her on the path, Kossil spoke. “One of my mistress’ duties, as\nshe knows, is the sacrifice of certain prisoners, criminals of noble birth,\nwho by sacrilege or treason have sinned against our lord the Godking.”\n\n“Or against the Nameless Ones,” said Arha.\n\n“Truly. Now it is not fitting that the Eaten One while yet a child should\nundertake this duty. But my mistress is no longer a child. There are prisoners\nin the Room of Chains, sent a month ago by the grace of our lord the Godking\nfrom his city Awabath.”\n\n“I did not know prisoners had come. Why did I not know?”\n\n“Prisoners are brought at night, and secretly, in the way prescribed of old in\nthe rituals of the Tombs. It is the secret way my mistress will follow, if she\ntakes the path that leads along the wall.”\n\nArha turned off the path to follow the great wall of stone that bounded the\nTombs behind the domed hall. The rocks it was built of were massive; the least\nof them would outweigh a man, and the largest were big as wagons. Though\nunshapen they were carefully fitted and interlocked. Yet in places the height\nof the wall had slipped down and the rocks lay in a shapeless heap. Only a\nvast span of time could do that, the desert centuries of fiery days and frozen\nnights, the millennial, imperceptible movements of the hills themselves.\n\n“It is very easy to climb the Tomb Wall,” Arha said as they went along beneath\nit.\n\n“We have not men enough to rebuild it,” Kossil replied.\n\n“We have men enough to guard it.”\n\n“Only slaves. They cannot be trusted.”\n\n“They can be trusted if they’re frightened. Let the penalty be the same for\nthem as for the stranger they allow to set foot on the holy ground within the\nwall.”\n\n“What is that penalty?” Kossil did not ask to learn the answer. She had taught\nthe answer to Arha, long ago.\n\n“To be decapitated before the Throne.”\n\n“Is it my mistress’ will that a guard be set upon the Tomb Wall?”\n\n“It is,” the girl answered. Inside her long black sleeves her fingers clenched\nwith elation. She knew Kossil did not want to spare a slave to this duty of\nwatching the wall, and indeed it was a useless duty, for what strangers ever\ncame here? It was not likely that any man would wander, by mischance or\nintent, anywhere within a mile of the Place without being seen; he certainly\nwould get nowhere near the Tombs. But a guard was an honor due them, and\nKossil could not well argue against it. She must obey Arha.\n\n“Here,” said her cold voice.\n\nArha stopped. She had often walked this path around the Tomb Wall, and knew it\nas she knew every foot of the Place, every rock and thorn and thistle. The\ngreat rock wall reared up thrice her height to the left; to the right the hill\nshelved away into a shallow, arid valley, which soon rose again towards the\nfoothills of the western range. She looked over all the ground nearby, and saw\nnothing that she had not seen before.\n\n“Under the red rocks, mistress.”\n\nA few yards down the slope an outcropping of red lava made a stair or little\ncliff in the hill. When she went down to it and stood on the level before it,\nfacing the rocks, Arha realized that they looked like a rough doorway, four\nfeet high.\n\n“What must be done?”\n\nShe had learned long ago that in the holy places it is no use trying to open a\ndoor until you know how the door is opened.\n\n“My mistress has all the keys to the dark places.”\n\nSince the rites of her coming of age, Arha had worn on her belt an iron ring\non which hung a little dagger and thirteen keys, some long and heavy, some\nsmall as fishhooks. She lifted the ring and spread the keys. “That one,”\nKossil said, pointing; and then placed her thick forefinger on a crevice\nbetween two red, pitted rock-surfaces.\n\n“The key, a long shaft of iron with two ornate wards, entered the crevice.\nArha turned it to the left, using both hands, for it was stiff to move; yet it\nturned smoothly.\n\n“Now?”\n\n“Together-“\n\nTogether they pushed at the rough rock face to the left of the keyhole.\nHeavily, but without catch and with very little noise, an uneven section of\nthe red rock moved inward until a narrow slit was opened. Inside it was\nblackness.\n\nArha stooped and entered.\n\nKossil, a heavy woman heavily clothed, had to squeeze through the narrow\nopening. As soon as she was inside she backed against the door and, straining,\npushed it shut.\n\nIt was absolutely black. There was no light. The dark seemed to press like wet\nfelt upon the open eyes.\n\nThey crouched, almost doubled over, for the place they stood in was not four\nfeet high, and so narrow that Arha’s groping hands touched damp rock at once\nto right and left.\n\n“Did you bring a light?”\n\nShe whispered, as one does in the dark.\n\n“I brought no light,” Kossil replied, behind her. Kossil’s voice too was\nlowered, but it had an odd sound to it, as if she were smiling. Kossil never\nsmiled. Arha’s heart jumped; the blood pounded in her throat. She said to\nherself, fiercely: This is my place, I belong here, I will not be afraid!\n\nAloud she said nothing. She started forward; there was only one way to go. It\nwent into the hill, and downward.\n\nKossil followed, breathing heavily, her garments brushing and scraping against\nrock and earth.\n\nAll at once the roof lifted: Arha could stand straight, and stretching out her\nhands she felt no walls. The air, which had been close and earthy, touched her\nface with a cooler dampness, and faint movements in it gave the sense of a\ngreat expanse. Arha took a few cautious steps forward into the utter\nblackness. A pebble, slipping under her sandaled foot, struck another pebble,\nand the tiny sound wakened echoes, many echoes, minute, remote, yet more\nremote. The cavern must be immense, high and broad, yet not empty: something\nin its darkness, surfaces of invisible objects or partitions, broke the echo\ninto a thousand fragments.\n\n“Here we must be beneath the Stones,” the girl said whispering, and her\nwhisper ran out into the hollow blackness and frayed into threads of sound as\nfine as spiderweb, that clung to the hearing for a long time.\n\n“Yes. This is the Undertomb. Go on. I cannot stay here. Follow the wall to the\nleft. Pass three openings.”\n\nKossil’s whisper hissed (and the tiny echoes hissed after it). She was afraid,\nshe was indeed afraid. She did not like to be here among the Nameless Ones, in\ntheir tombs, in their caves, in the dark. It was not her place, she did not\nbelong here.\n\n“I shall come here with a torch,” Arha said, guiding herself along the wall of\nthe cavern by the touch of her fingers, wondering at the strange shapes of the\nrock, hollows and swellings and fine curves and edges, rough as lace here,\nsmooth as brass there: surely this was carven work. Perhaps the whole cavern\nwas the work of sculptors of the ancient days?\n\n“Light is forbidden here.” Kossil’s whisper was sharp. Even as she said it,\nArha knew it must be so. This was the very home of darkness, the inmost center\nof the night.\n\nThree times her fingers swept across a gap in the complex, rocky blackness.\nThe fourth time she felt for the height and width of the opening, and entered\nit. Kossil came behind.\n\nIn this tunnel, which went upward again at a slight slant, they passed an\nopening on the left, and then at a branching way took the right: all by feel,\nby groping, in the blindness of the underearth and the silence inside the\nground. In such a passageway as this, one must reach out almost constantly to\ntouch both sides of the tunnel, lest one of the openings that must be counted\nbe missed, or the forking of the way go unnoticed. Touch was one’s whole\nguidance; one could not see the way, but held it in one’s hands.\n\n“Is this the Labyrinth?”\n\n“No. This is the lesser maze, which is beneath the Throne.”\n\n“Where is the entrance to the Labyrinth?”\n\nArha liked this game in the dark, she wanted a greater puzzle to be set her.\n\n“The second opening we passed in the Undertomb. Feel for a door to the right\nnow, a wooden door, perhaps we’ve passed it already-“\n\nArha heard Kossil’s hands fumbling uneasily along the wall, scraping on the\nrough rock. She kept her fingertips light against the rock, and in a moment\nfelt the smooth grain of wood beneath them. She pushed on it, and the door\ncreaked open easily. She stood for a moment blind with light.\n\nThey entered a large low room, walled with hewn stone and lighted by one\nfuming torch hung from a chain. The place was foul with the torch-smoke that\nhad no outlet. Arha’s eyes stung and watered.\n\n“Where are the prisoners?”\n\n“There.”\n\nAt last she realized that the three heaps of something on the far side of the\nroom were men.\n\n“The door isn’t locked. Is there no guard?”\n\n“None is needed.”\n\nShe went a little farther into the room, hesitant, peering through the smoky\nhaze. The prisoners were manacled by both ankles and one wrist to great rings\ndriven into the rock of the wall. If one of them wanted to lie down, his\nchained arm must remain raised, hanging from the manacle. Their hair and\nbeards had made a matted tangle which, together with the shadows, hid their\nfaces. One of them half lay, the other two sat or squatted. They were naked.\nThe smell from them was stronger even than the reek of smoke.\n\nOne of them seemed to be watching Arha; she thought she saw the glitter of\neyes, then was not sure. The others had not moved or lifted their heads.\n\nShe turned away. “They are not men any more,” she said.\n\n“They were never men. They were demons, beast-spirits, who plotted against the\nsacred life of the Godking!” Kossil’s eyes shone with the reddish torchlight.\n\nArha looked again at the prisoners, awed and curious. “How could a man attack\na god? How was it? You: how could you dare attack a living god?”\n\nThe one man stared at her through the black brush of his hair, but said\nnothing.\n\n“Their tongues were cut out before they were sent from Awabath,” Kossil said.\n“Do not speak to them, mistress. They are defilement. They are yours, but not\nto speak to, nor to look at, nor to think upon. They are yours to give to the\nNameless Ones.”\n\n“How are they to be sacrificed?”\n\nArha no longer looked at the prisoners. She faced Kossil instead, drawing\nstrength from the massive body, the cold voice. She felt dizzy, and the reek\nof smoke and filth made her sick, yet she seemed to think and speak with\nperfect calm. Had she not done this many times before?\n\n“The Priestess of the Tombs knows best what manner of death will please her\nMasters, and it is hers to choose. There are many ways.”\n\n“Let Gobar the captain of the guards hew off their heads. And the blood will\nbe poured out before the Throne.”\n\n“As if it were a sacrifice of goats?” Kossil seemed to be sneering at her lack\nof imagination. She stood dumb. Kossil went on, “Besides, Gobar is a man. No\nman can enter the Dark Places of the Tombs, surely my mistress remembers that?\nIf he enters, he does not leave...”\n\n“Who brought them here? Who feeds them?”\n\n“The wardens who serve my temple, Duby and Uahto; they are eunuchs and may\nenter here on the services of the Nameless Ones, as I may. The Godking’s\nsoldiers left the prisoners bound outside the wall, and I and the wardens\nbrought them in through the Prisoner’s Door, the door in the red rocks. So it\nis always done. The food and water is lowered from a trapdoor in one of the\nrooms behind the Throne.”\n\nArha looked up and saw, beside the chain from which the torch hung, a wooden\nsquare set into the stone ceiling. It was far too small for a man to crawl\nthrough, but a rope lowered from it would come down just within reach of the\nmiddle prisoner of the three. She looked away again quickly.\n\n“Let them not bring any more food or water, then. Let the torch go out.”\n\nKossil bowed. “And the bodies, when they die?”\n\n“Let Duby and Uahto bury them in the great cavern that we passed through, the\nUndertomb,” the girl said, her voice becoming quick and high. “They must do it\nin the dark. My Masters will eat the bodies.”\n\n“It shall be done.”\n\n“Is this well, Kossil?”\n\n“It is well, mistress.”\n\n“Then let us go,” Arha said, very shrill. She turned and hurried back to the\nwooden door, and out of the Room of Chains into the blackness of the tunnel.\nIt seemed sweet and peaceful as a starless night, silent, without sight, or\nlight, or life. She plunged into the clean darkness, hurried forward through\nit like a swimmer through water. Kossil hastened along, behind her and getting\nfarther behind, panting, lumbering. Without hesitation Arha repeated the\nmissed and taken turnings as they had come, skirted the vast echoing\nUndertomb, and crept, bent over, up the last long tunnel to the shut door of\nrock. There she crouched down and felt for the long key on the ring at her\nwaist. She found it, but could not find the keyhole. There was no pinprick of\nlight in the invisible wall before her. Her fingers groped over it seeking\nlock or bolt or handle and finding nothing. Where must the key go? How could\nshe get out?\n\n“Mistress!”\n\nKossil’s voice, magnified by echoes, hissed and boomed far behind her.\n\n“Mistress, the door will not open from inside. There is no way out. There is\nno return.”\n\nArha crouched against the rock. She said nothing.\n\n“Arha!”\n\n“I am here.”\n\n“Come!”\n\nShe came, crawling on hands and knees along the passage, like a dog, to\nKossil’s skirts.\n\n“To the right. Hurry! I must not linger here. It is not my place. Follow me.”\n\nArha got to her feet, and held onto Kossils robes. They went forward,\nfollowing the strangely carven wall of the cavern to the right for a long way,\nthen entering a black gap in the blackness. They went upward now, in tunnels,\nby stairs. The girl still clung to the woman’s robe. Her eyes were shut.\n\nThere was light, red through her eyelids. She thought it was the torchlit room\nfull of smoke again, and did not open her eyes. But the air smelt sweetish,\ndry and moldy, a familiar smell; and her feet were on a staircase steep almost\nas a ladder. She let go Kossil’s robe, and looked. A trapdoor was open over\nher head. She scrambled through it after Kossil. It let her into a room she\nknew, a little stone cell containing a couple of chests and iron boxes, in the\nwarren of rooms behind the Throne Room of the Hall. Daylight glimmered gray\nand faint in the hallway outside its door.\n\n“The other, the Prisoner’s Door, leads only into the tunnels. It does not lead\nout. This is the only way out. If there is any other way I do not know of it,\nnor does Thar. You must remember it for yourself, if there is one. But I do\nnot think there is.” Kossil still spoke in an undertone, and with a kind of\nspitefulness. Her heavy face within the black cowl was pale, and damp with\nsweat.\n\n“I don’t remember the turnings to this way out.”\n\n“I’ll tell them to you. Once. You must remember them. Next time I will not\ncome with you. This is not my place. You must come alone.”\n\nThe girl nodded. She looked up into the older woman’s face, and thought how\nstrange it looked, pale with scarcely mastered fear and yet triumphant, as if\nKossil gloated over her weakness.\n\n“I will come alone after this,” Arha said, and then trying to turn away from\nKossil she felt her legs give way, and saw the room turn over. She fainted in\na little black heap at the priestess’ feet.\n\n“You’ll learn,” Kossil said, still breathing heavily, standing motionless.\n“You’ll learn.”\n\n\n#  Dreams and Tales\n\nArha was not well for several days. They treated her for fever. She kept to\nher bed, or sat in the mild autumn sunlight on the porch of the Small House,\nand looked up at the western hills. She felt weak and stupid. The same ideas\noccurred to her again and again. She was ashamed of having fainted. No guard\nhad been set upon the Tomb Wall, but now she would never dare ask Kossil about\nthat. She did not want to see Kossil at all: never. It was because she was\nashamed of having fainted.\n\nOften, in the sunlight, she would plan how she was going to behave next time\nshe went into the dark places under the hill. She thought many times about\nwhat kind of death she should command for the next set of prisoners, more\nelaborate, better suited to the rituals of the Empty Throne.\n\nEach night, in the dark, she woke up screaming, “They aren’t dead yet! They\nare still dying!”\n\nShe dreamed a great deal. She dreamed that she had to cook food, great\ncauldrons full of savory porridge, and pour it all out into a hole in the\nground. She dreamed that she had to carry a full bowl of water, a deep brass\nbowl, through the dark, to someone who was thirsty. She could never get to\nthis person. She woke, and she herself was thirsty, but she did not go and get\na drink. She lay awake, eyes open, in the room without windows.\n\nOne morning Penthe came to see her. From the porch Arha saw her approach the\nSmall House with a careless, purposeless air, as if she just happened to be\nwandering that way. If Arha had not spoken she would not have come up the\nsteps. But Arha was lonely, and spoke.\n\nPenthe made the deep bow required of all who approached the Priestess of the\nTombs, and then plopped down on the steps below Arha and made a noise like\n“Phewph!” She had gotten quite tall and plump; anything she did turned her\ncherry pink, and she was pink now from walking.\n\n“I heard you were ill. I saved you out some apples.” She suddenly produced a\nrush net containing six or eight perfect yellow apples, from somewhere under\nher voluminous black robe. She was now consecrated to the service of the\nGodking, and served in his temple under Kossil; but she wasn’t yet a\npriestess, and still did lessons and chores with the novices. “Poppe and I\nsorted the apples this year, and I saved the very best ones out. They always\ndry all the really good ones. Of course they keep best, but it seems such a\nwaste. Aren’t they pretty?”\n\nArha felt the pale gold satin skins of the apples, looked at the twigs to\nwhich brown leaves still delicately clung. “They are pretty.”\n\n“Have one,” said Penthe.\n\n“Not now. You do.”\n\nPenthe selected the smallest, out of politeness, and ate it in about ten\njuicy, skillful, interested bites.\n\n“I could eat all day,” she said. “I never get enough. I wish I could be a cook\ninstead of a priestess. I’d cook better than that old skinflint Nathabba, and\nbesides, I’d get to lick the pots... Oh, did you hear about Munith? She was\nsupposed to be polishing those brass pots they keep the rose oil in, you know,\nthose long thin sort of jars with stoppers. And she thought she was supposed\nto clean the insides too, so she stuck her hand in, with a rag around it, you\nknow, and then she couldn’t get it out. She tried so hard it got all puffed up\nand swollen at the wrist, you know, so that she really was stuck. And she went\ngalloping all over the dormitories yelling, ‘I can’t get it off! I can’t get\nit off!’ And Punti’s so deaf now he thought it was a fire, and started\nscreeching at the other wardens to come and rescue the novices. And Uahto was\nmilking and came running out of the pen to see what was the matter, and left\nthe gate open, and all the milch-goats got out and came charging into the\ncourtyard and ran into Punti and the wardens and the little girls, and Munith\nwaving this brass pot around on the end of her arm and having hysterics, and\nthey were all sort of rushing around down there when Kossil came down from the\ntemple. And she said, ‘What’s this? What’s this?”’\n\nPenthe’s fair, round face took on a repulsive sneer, not at all like Kossil’s\ncold expression, and yet somehow so like Kossil that Arha gave a snort of\nalmost terrified laughter.\n\n“’What’s this? What’s all this?’ Kossil said. And then-and then the brown goat\nbutted her-“ Penthe dissolved in laughter, tears welled in her eyes. “And\nM-Munith hit the, the goat with the p-ppot”\n\nBoth girls rocked back and forth in spasms of giggling, holding their knees,\nchoking.\n\n“And Kossil turned around and said, ‘What’s this? What’s this?’ to the - to\nthe - to the goat...” The end of the tale was lost in laughter. Penthe finally\nwiped her eyes and nose, and absentmindedly started on another apple.\n\nTo laugh so hard made Arha feel a little shaky. She calmed herself down, and\nafter a while asked, “How did you come here, Penthe?”\n\n“Oh, I was the sixth girl my mother and father had, and they just couldn’t\nbring up so many and marry them all off. So when I was seven they brought me\nto the Godking’s temple and dedicated me. That was in Ossawa. They had too\nmany novices there, I guess, because pretty soon they sent me on here. Or\nmaybe they thought I’d make a specially good priestess or something. But they\nwere wrong about that!” Penthe bit her apple with a cheerful, rueful face.\n\n“Would you rather not have been a priestess?”\n\n“Would I rather! Of course! I’d rather marry a pigherd and live in a ditch.\nI’d rather anything than stay buried alive here all my born days with a mess\nof women in a perishing old desert where nobody ever comes! But there’s no\ngood wishing about it, because I’ve been consecrated now and I’m stuck with\nit. But I do hope that in my next life I’m a dancing-girl in Awabath! Because\nI will have earned it.”\n\nArha looked down at her with a dark steady gaze. She did not understand. She\nfelt that she had never seen Penthe before, never looked at her and seen her,\nround and full of life and juice as one of her golden apples, beautiful to\nsee.\n\n“Doesn’t the Temple mean anything to you?” she asked, rather harshly.\n\nPenthe, always submissive and easily bullied, did not take alarm this time.\n“Oh, I know your Masters are very important to you,” she said with an\nindifference that shocked Arha. “That makes some sense, anyhow, because you’re\ntheir one special servant. You weren’t just consecrated, you were specially\nborn. But look at me. Am I supposed to feel so much awe and so on about the\nGodking? After all he’s just a man, even if he does live in Awabath in a\npalace ten miles around with gold roofs. He’s about fifty years old, and he’s\nbald. You can see in all the statues. And I’ll bet you he has to cut his\ntoenails, just like any other man. I know perfectly well that he’s a god, too.\nBut what I think is, he’ll be much godlier after he’s dead.”\n\nArha agreed with Penthe, for secretly she had come to consider the self-styled\nDivine Emperors of Kargad as upstarts, false gods trying to filch the worship\ndue to the true and everlasting Powers. But there was something underneath\nPenthe’s words with which she didn’t agree, something wholly new to her,\nfrightening to her. She had not realized how very different people were, how\ndifferently they saw life. She felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen\na whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an\nentirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter. She was scared\nby the solidity of Penthe’s unfaith. Scared, she struck out.\n\n“That’s true. My Masters have been dead a long, long time; and they were never\nmen... Do you know, Penthe, I could call you into the service of the Tombs.”\nShe spoke pleasantly, as if offering her friend a better choice.\n\nThe pink went right out of Penthe’s cheeks.\n\n“Yes,” she said, “you could. But I’m not... I’m not the sort that would be\ngood at that.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I am afraid of the dark,” Penthe said in a low voice.\n\nArha made a little sound of scorn, but she was pleased. She had made her\npoint. Penthe might disbelieve in the gods, but she feared the unnameable\npowers of the dark - as did every mortal soul.\n\n“I wouldn’t do that unless you wanted to, you know,” Arha said.\n\nA long silence fell between their.\n\n“You’re getting to be more and more like Thar,” Penthe said in her soft dreamy\nway. “Thank goodness you’re not getting like Kossil! But you’re so strong. I\nwish I were strong. I just like eating...”\n\n“Go ahead,” Arha said, superior and amused, and Penthe slowly consumed a third\napple down to the seeds.\n\nThe demands of the endless ritual of the Place brought Arha out of her privacy\na couple of days later. Twin kids had been born out of season to a she-goat,\nand were to be sacrificed to the Twin God-Brothers as the custom was: an\nimportant rite, at which the First Priestess must be present. Then it was dark\nof the moon, and the ceremonies of the darkness must be performed before the\nEmpty Throne. Arha breathed in the drugging fumes of herbs burning in broad\ntrays of bronze before the Throne, and danced, solitary in black. She danced\nfor the unseen spirits of the dead and the unborn and as she danced the\nspirits crowded the air around her, following the turn and spin of her feet\nand the slow, sure gestures of her arms. She sang the songs whose words no man\nunderstood, which she had learned syllable by syllable, long ago, from Thar. A\nchoir of priestesses hidden in the dusk behind the great double row of columns\nechoed the strange words after her, and the air in the vast ruinous room\nhummed with voices, as if the crowding spirits repeated the chants again and\nagain.\n\nThe Godking in Awabath sent no more prisoners to the Place, and gradually Arha\nceased to dream of the three now long since dead and buried in shallow graves\nin the great cavern under the Tombstones.\n\nShe summoned up her courage to return to that cavern. She must go back there:\nthe Priestess of the Tombs must be able to enter her own domain without\nterror, to know its ways.\n\nThe first time she entered the trapdoor was hard; yet not so hard as she had\nfeared. She had schooled herself up to it so well, had so determined that she\nwould go alone and keep her nerve, that when she came there she was almost\ndismayed to find that there was nothing to be afraid of. Graves might be\nthere, but she could not see them; she could not see anything. It was black;\nit was silent. And that was all.\n\nDay after day she went there, always entering by the trapdoor in the room\nbehind the Throne, until she knew well the whole circuit of the cavern, with\nits strange sculptured walls -as well as one can know what one cannot see. She\nnever left the walls, for in striking out across the great hollow she might\nsoon lose the sense of direction in the darkness, and so, blundering back at\nlast to the wall, not know where she was. For as she had learned the first\ntime, the important thing down in the dark places was to know which turnings\nand openings one had passed, and which were to come. It must be done by\ncounting, for they were all alike to the groping hands. Arha’s memory had been\nwell trained, and she found no difficulty to this odd trick of finding one’s\nway by touch and number, instead of by sight and common sense. She soon knew\nby heart all the corridors that opened off the Undertomb, the lesser maze that\nlay under the Hall of the Throne and the hilltop. But there was one corridor\nshe never entered: the second left of the red rock entrance, that one which,\nif she entered mistaking it for one she knew, she might never find her way out\nof again. Her longing to enter it, to learn the Labyrinth, grew steadily, but\nshe restrained it until she had learned all she could about it, aboveground.\n\nThar knew little about it but the names of certain of its rooms, and the list\nof directions, of turns made and missed, for getting to these rooms. She would\ntell these to Arha, but she would never draw them in the dust or even with the\ngesture of a hand in the air; and she herself had never followed them, had\nnever entered the Labyrinth. But when Arha asked her, “What is the way from\nthe iron door that stands open to the Painted Room?” or, “How does the way run\nfrom the Room of Bones to the tunnel by the river?” then Thar would be silent\na little, and then recite the strange directions she had learned long before\nfrom Arha-that-was: so many crossings passed, so many left-hand turns taken,\nand so on, and so on. And all these Arha got by heart, as Thar had, often on\nthe first listening. When she lay in bed nights she would repeat them to\nherself, trying to imagine the places, the rooms, the turnings.\n\nThar showed Arha the many spy holes that opened into the maze, in every\nbuilding and temple of the Place, and even under rocks out of doors. The\nspiderweb of stone-walled tunnels underlay all the Place and even beyond its\nwalls; there were miles of tunnels, down there in the dark. No person there\nbut she, the two High Priestesses, and their special servants, the eunuchs\nManan, Uahto, and Duby, knew of the existence of this maze that lay beneath\nevery step they took. There were vague rumors of it among the others; they all\nknew that there were caves or rooms of some sort under the Tombstones. But\nnone of them was very curious about anything to do with the Nameless Ones and\nthe places sacred to them. Perhaps they felt that the less they knew, the\nbetter. Arha of course bad been intensely curious, and knowing that there were\nspy holes into the Labyrinth, had sought for them; yet they were so well\nconcealed, in the pavements of the floors or in the desert ground, that she\nhad never found one, not even the one in her own Small House, until Thar\nshowed it to her.\n\nOne night in early spring she took a candle lantern and went down with it,\nunlit, through the Undertomb to the second passage to the left of the passage\nfrom the red rock door.\n\nIn the dark, she went some thirty paces down the passage, and then passed\nthrough a doorway, feeling the iron frame set in the rock: the limit, until\nnow, of her explorations. Past the Iron Door she went a long way along the\ntunnel, and when at last it began to curve to the right, she lit her candle\nand looked about her. For light was permitted, here. She was no longer in the\nUndertomb. She was in a place less sacred though perhaps more dreadful. She\nwas in the Labyrinth.\n\nThe raw, blank walls and vault and floor of rock surrounded her in the small\nsphere of candlelight. The air was dead. Before her and behind her the tunnel\nstretched off into darkness.\n\nAll the tunnels were the same, crossing and recrossing. She kept careful count\nof her turnings and gassings, and recited Thar’s directions to herself, though\nshe knew them perfectly. For it would not do to get lost in the Labyrinth. In\nthe Undertomb and the short passages around it, Kossil or Thar might find her,\nor Manan come seeking for her, for she had taken him there several times.\nHere, none of them had ever been: only she herself. Little good it would do\nher if they came to the Undertomb and called aloud, and she was lost in some\nspiraling tangle of tunnels half a mile away. She imagined how she might hear\nthe echo of voices calling her, echoing down every corridor, and she would try\nto come to them, but, lost, would only become farther lost. So vividly did she\nimagine this that she stopped, thinking she heard a distant voice calling. But\nthere was nothing. And she would not get lost. She was very careful; and this\nwas her place, her own domain. The powers of the dark, the Nameless Ones,\nwould guide her steps here, just as they would lead astray any other mortal\nwho dared enter the Labyrinth of the Tombs.\n\nShe did not go far into it that first time, but far enough that the strange,\nbitter, yet pleasurable certainty of her utter solitude and independence there\ngrew strong in her, and led her back, and back again, and each time farther.\nShe came to the Painted Room, and the Six Ways, and followed the long Outmost\nTunnel, and penetrated the strange tangle that led to the Room of Bones.\n\n“When was the Labyrinth made?” she asked Thar, and the stern, thin priestess\nanswered, “Mistress, I do not know. No one knows.”\n\n“Why was it made?”\n\n“For the hiding away of the treasures of the Tombs, and for the punishment of\nthose who tried to steal those treasures.”\n\n“All the treasures I’ve seen are in the rooms behind the Throne, and the\nbasements under it. What lies in the Labyrinth?”\n\n“A far greater and more ancient treasure. Would you look on it?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“None but you may enter the Treasury of the Tombs. You may take your servants\ninto the Labyrinth, but not into the Treasury. If even Manan entered there,\nthe anger of the dark would waken; he would not leave the Labyrinth alive.\nThere you must go alone, forever. I know where the Great Treasure is. You told\nme the way, fifteen years ago, before you died, so that I would remember and\ntell you when you returned. I can tell you the way to follow in the Labyrinth,\nbeyond the Painted Room; and the key to the treasury is that silver one on\nyour ring, with a figure of a dragon on the haft. But you must go alone.”\n\n“Tell me the way.”\n\nThar told her, and she remembered, as she remembered all that was told her.\nBut she did not go to see the Great Treasure of the Tombs. Some feeling that\nher will or her knowledge was not yet complete held her back. Or perhaps she\nwanted to keep something in reserve, something to look forward to, that cast a\nglamor over those endless tunnels through the dark that ended always in blank\nwalls or bare dusty cells. She would wait awhile before she saw her treasures.\n\nAfter all, had she not seen them before?\n\nIt still made her feel strange when Thar and Kossil spoke to her of things she\nhad seen or said before she died. She knew that indeed she had died, and had\nbeen reborn in a new body at the hour of her old body’s death: not only once,\nfifteen years ago, but fifty years ago, and before that, and before that, back\ndown the years and hundreds of years, generation before generation, to the\nvery beginning of years when the Labyrinth was dug, and the Stones were\nraised, and the First Priestess of the Nameless Ones lived in this Place and\ndanced before the Empty Throne. They were all one, all those lives and hers.\nShe was the First Priestess. All human beings were forever reborn, but only\nshe, Arha, was reborn forever as herself. A hundred times she had learned the\nways and turnings of the Labyrinth and had come to the hidden room at last.\n\nSometimes she thought she remembered. The dark places under the hill were so\nfamiliar to her, as if they were not only her domain, but her home. When she\nbreathed in the drug-fumes to dance at dark of the moon, her head grew light\nand her body was no longer hers; then she danced across the centuries,\nbarefoot in black robes, and knew that the dance had never ceased.\n\nYet it was always strange when Thar said, “You told me before you died...”\n\nOnce she asked, “Who were those men that came to rob the Tombs? Did any ever\ndo so?” The idea of robbers had struck her as exciting, but improbable. How\nwould they come secretly to the Place? Pilgrims were very few, fewer even than\nprisoners. Now and then new novices or slaves were sent from lesser temples of\nthe Four Lands, or a small group came to bring some offering of gold or rare\nincense to one of the temples. And that was all. Nobody came by chance, or to\nbuy and sell, or to sightsee, or to steal; nobody came but under orders. Arha\ndid not even know how far it was to the nearest town, twenty miles or more;\nand the nearest town was a small one. The Place was guarded and defended by\nemptiness, by solitude. Anybody crossing the desert that surrounded it, she\nthought, would have as much chance of going unseen as a black sheep in a\nsnowfield.\n\nShe was with Thar and Kossil, with whom much of her time was spent now when\nshe was not in the Small House or alone under the hill. It was a stormy, cold\nnight in April. They sat by a tiny fire of sage on the hearth in the room\nbehind the Godking’s temple, Kossil’s room. Outside the doorway, in the hall,\nManan and Duby played a game with sticks and counters, tossing a bundle of\nsticks and catching as many as possible on the back of the hand. Manan and\nArha still sometimes played that game, in secret, in the inner courtyard of\nthe Small House. The rattle of dropped sticks, the husky mumbles of triumph\nand defeat, the small crackle of the fire, were the only sounds when the three\npriestesses fell silent. All around beyond the walls reached the profound\nsilence of the desert night. From time to time came the patter of a sparse,\nhard shower of rain.\n\n“Many came to rob the Tombs, long ago; but none ever did so,” said Thar.\nTaciturn as she was, she liked now and then to tell a story, and often did so\nas part of Arha’s instruction. She looked tonight as if a story might be\ngotten out of her.\n\n“How would any man dare?”\n\n“They would dare,” Kossil said. “They were sorcerers, wizardfolk from the\nInner Lands. That was before the Godkings ruled the Kargad Lands; we were not\nso strong then. The wizards used to sail from the west to Karego-At and Atuan\nto plunder the towns on the coast, loot the farms, even come into the Sacred\nCity Awabath. They came to kill dragons, they said, but they stayed to rob\ntowns and temples.”\n\n“And their great heroes would come among us to test their swords,” Thar said,\n“and work their ungodly spells. One of them, a mighty sorcerer and dragonlord,\nthe greatest of them all, came to grief here. It was long ago, very long ago,\nbut the tale is still remembered, and not only in this place. The sorcerer was\nnamed Erreth-Akbe, and he was both king and wizard in the West. He came to our\nlands, and in Awabath he joined with certain Kargish rebel lords, and fought\nfor the rule of the city with the High Priest of the Inmost Temple of the Twin\nGods. Long they fought, the man’s sorcery against the lightning of the gods,\nand the temple was destroyed around them. At last the High Priest broke the\nsorcerer’s witching-staff, broke in half his amulet of power, and defeated\nhim. He escaped from the city and from the Kargish lands, and fled clear\nacross Earthsea to the farthest west; and there a dragon slew him, because his\npower was gone. And since that day the power and might of the Inner Lands has\never waned. Now the High Priest was named Intathin, and he was the first of\nthe house of Tarb, that lineage from which, after the fulfillment of the\nprophecies and the centuries, the Priest-Kings of Karego-At were descended,\nand from them, the Godkings of all Kargad. So it is that since the day of\nIntathin the power and might of the Kargish lands has ever grown. Those who\ncame to rob the Tombs, they were sorcerers, trying and trying to get back the\nbroken amulet of Erreth-Akbe. But it is still here, where the High Priest put\nit for safekeeping. And so are their bones...” Thar pointed at the ground\nunder her feet.\n\n“Half of it is here,” Kossil said.\n\n“And the other half lost forever.”\n\n“How lost?” asked Arha.\n\n“The one half, in Intathin’s hand, was given by him to the Treasury of the\nTombs, where it should lie safe forever. The other remained in the sorcerer’s\nhand, but he gave it before he fled to a petty king, one of the rebels, named\nThoreg of Hupun. I do not know why he did so.”\n\n“To cause strife, to make Thoreg proud,” Kossil said. “And so it did. The\ndescendants of Thoreg rebelled again when the house of Tarb ruled; and yet\nagain they took arms against the first Godking, refusing to acknowledge him as\neither king or god. They were an accursed, ensorcelled race. They are all dead\nnow.”\n\nThar nodded. “The father of our present Godking, the Lord Who Has Arisen, put\ndown that family of Hupun, and destroyed their palaces. When that was done,\nthe half-amulet, which they had kept ever since the days of Erreth-Akbe and\nIntathin, was lost. No one knows what became of it. And that was a lifetime\nago.”\n\n“It was thrown out as trash, no doubt,” Kossil said. “They say it doesn’t look\nlike anything of value, the Ring of Erreth-Akbe. A curse upon it and upon all\nthe things of the wizardfolk!” Kossil spat into the fire.\n\n“Have you seen the half that is here?” Arha asked of Thar.\n\nThe thin woman shook her head. “It is in that treasury to which none may come\nbut the One Priestess. It may be the greatest of all the treasures there; I do\nnot know. I think perhaps it is. For hundreds of years the Inner Lands sent\nthieves and wizards here to try to steal it back, and they would pass by open\ncoffers of gold, seeking that one thing. It is very long since Erreth-Akbe and\nIntathin lived, and yet still the story is known and told, both here and in\nthe West. Most things grow old and perish, as the centuries go on and on. Very\nfew are the precious things that remain precious, or the tales that are still\ntold.”\n\nArha brooded awhile and said, “They must have been very brave men, or very\nstupid, to enter the Tombs. Don’t they know the powers of the Nameless Ones?”\n\n“No,” Kossil said in her cold voice. “They have no gods. They work magic, and\nthink they are gods themselves. But they are not. And when they die, they are\nnot reborn. They become dust and bone, and their ghosts whine on the wind a\nlittle while till the wind blows them away. They do not have immortal souls.”\n\n“But what is this magic they work?” Arha asked, enthralled. She did not\nremember having said once that she would have turned away and refused to look\nat the ships from the Inner Lands. “How do they do it? What does it do?”\n\n“Tricks, deceptions, jugglery,” Kossil said.\n\n“Somewhat more,” said Thar, “if the tales be true even in part. The wizards of\nthe West can raise and still the winds, and make them blow whither they will.\nOn that, all agree, and tell the same tale. That is why they are great\nsailors; they can put the wind of magic in their sails, and go where they\nwill, and hush the storms at sea. And it is said that they can make light at\nwill, and darkness; and change rocks to diamonds, and lead to gold; that they\ncan build a great palace or a whole city in one instant, at least in seeming;\nthat they can turn themselves into bears, or fish, or dragons, just as they\nplease.”\n\n“I do not believe all that,” said Kossil. “That they are dangerous, subtle\nwith trickery, slippery as eels, yes. But they say that if you take his wooden\nstaff away from a sorcerer, he has no power left. Probably there are evil\nrunes written on the staff.”\n\nThar shook her head again. “They carry a staff, indeed, but it is only a tool\nfor the power they bear within them.”\n\n“But how do they get the power?” Arha asked. “Where does it come from?”\n\n“Lies,” Kossil said.\n\n“Words,” said Thar. “So I was told by one who once had watched a great\nsorcerer of the Inner Lands, a Mage as they are called. They had taken him\nprisoner, raiding to the West. He showed them a stick of dry wood, and spoke a\nword to it. And lo! it blossomed. And he spoke another word, and lo! it bore\nred apples. And he spoke one word more, and stick, blossoms, apples, and all\nvanished, and with them the sorcerer. With one word he had gone as a rainbow\ngoes, like a wink, without a trace; and they never found him on that isle. Was\nthat mere jugglery?”\n\n“It’s easy to fool fools,” Kossil said.\n\nThar said no more, avoiding argument but Arha was loath to have the subject\ndropped. “What do the wizard-folk look like,” she asked, “are they truly black\nall over, with white eyes?”\n\n“They are black and vile. I have never seen one,” Kossil said with\nsatisfaction, shifting her heavy bulk on the low stool and spreading her hands\nto the fire.\n\n“May the Twin Gods keep them afar,” Thar muttered.\n\n“They will never come here again,” said Kossil. And the fire sputtered, and\nthe rain spattered on the roof, and outside the gloomy doorway Manan cried\nshrilly, “Aha! A half for me, a half!”\n\n\n#  Light Under the Hill\n\nAs the year was rounding again towards winter, Thar died. In the summer a\nwasting disease had come upon her; she who had been thin grew skeletal, she\nwho had been grim now did not speak at all. Only to Arha would she talk,\nsometimes, when they were alone together; then even that ceased, and she went\nsilently into the dark. When she was gone, Arha missed her sorely. If Thar had\nbeen stern, she had never been cruel. It was pride she had taught to Arha, not\nfear.\n\nNow there was only Kossil.\n\nA new High Priestess for the Temple of the Twin Gods would come in spring from\nAwabath; until then, Arha and Kossil between them were the rulers of the\nPlace. The woman called the girl “mistress,” and should obey her if commanded.\nBut Arha learned not to command Kossil. She had the right to do so, but not\nthe strength; it would take very great strength to stand up against Kossil’s\njealousy of a higher status than her own, her hatred of anything she herself\ndid not control.\n\nSince Arha had learned (from gentle Penthe) of the existence of unfaith, and\nhad accepted it as a reality even though it frightened her, she had been able\nto look at Kossil much more steadily, and to understand her. Kossil had no\ntrue worship in her heart of the Nameless Ones or of the gods. She held\nnothing sacred but power. The Emperor of the Kargad Lands now held the power,\nand therefore he was indeed a godking in her eyes, and she would serve him\nwell. But to her the temples were mere show, the Tombstones were rocks, the\nTombs of Atuan were dark holes in the ground, terrible but empty. She would do\naway with the worship of the Empty Throne, if she could. She would do away\nwith the First Priestess, if she dared.\n\nArha had come to face even this last fact quite steadily. Perhaps Thar had\nhelped her to see it, though she had never said anything directly. In the\nfirst stages of her illness, before the silence came upon her, she had asked\nArha to come to her every few days, and had talked to her, telling her much\nabout the doings of the Godking and his predecessor, and the ways of Awabath -\nmatters which she should as an important priestess know, but which were not\noften flattering to the Godking and his court. And she had spoken of her own\nlife, and described what the Arha of the previous life had looked like and\ndone; and sometimes, not often, she had mentioned what might be the\ndifficulties and dangers of Arha’s present life. Not once did she mention\nKossil by name. But Arha had been Thar’s pupil for eleven years, and needed no\nmore than a hint or a tone to understand, and to remember.\n\nAfter the gloomy commotion of the Rites of Mourning was over, Arha took to\navoiding Kossil. When the long works and rituals of the day were done, she\nwent to her solitary dwelling; and whenever there was time, she went to the\nroom behind the Throne, and opened the trapdoor, and went down into the dark.\nIn daytime and nighttime, for it made no difference there, she pursued a\nsystematic exploration of her domain. The Undertomb, with its great weight of\nsacredness, was utterly forbidden to any but priestesses and their most\ntrusted eunuchs. Any other, man or woman, who ventured there would certainly\nbe struck dead by the wrath of the Nameless Ones. But among all the rules she\nhad learned, there was no rule forbidding entry to the Labyrinth. There was no\nneed. It could be entered only from the Undertomb; and anyway, do flies need\nrules to tell them not to enter in a spider’s web?\n\nSo she took Manan often into the nearer regions of the Labyrinth, that he\nmight learn the ways. He was not at all eager to go there, but as always he\nobeyed her. She made sure that Duby and Uahto, Kossil’s eunuchs, knew the way\nto the Room of Chains and the way out of the Undertomb, but no more; she never\ntook them into the Labyrinth. She wanted no one but Manan, utterly faithful to\nher, to know those secret ways. For they were hers, hers alone, forever. She\nhad begun her full exploration with the Labyrinth. All the autumn she spent\nmany days walking those endless corridors, and still there were regions of\nthem she had never come to. There was a weariness in that tracing of the vast,\nmeaningless web of ways; the legs got tired and the mind got bored, forever\nreckoning up the turnings and the passages behind and to come. It was\nwonderful, laid out in the solid rock underground like the streets of a great\ncity; but it had been made to weary and confuse the mortal walking in it, and\neven its priestess must feel it to be nothing, in the end, but a great trap.\n\nSo, more and more as winter deepened, she turned her thorough exploration to\nthe Hall itself, the altars, the alcoves behind and beneath the altars, the\nrooms of chests and boxes, the contents of the chests and boxes, the passages\nand attics, the dusty hollow under the dome where hundreds of bats nested, the\nbasements and underbasements that were the anterooms of the corridors of\ndarkness.\n\nHer hands and sleeves perfumed with the dry sweetness of a musk that had\nfallen to powder lying for eight centuries in an iron chest, her brow smeared\nwith the clinging black of cobweb, she would kneel for an hour to study the\ncarvings on a beautiful, time-ruined coffer of cedar wood, the gift of some\nking ages since to the Nameless Powers of the Tombs. There was the king, a\ntiny stiff figure with a big nose, and there was the Hall of the Throne with\nits flat dome and porch columns, carved in delicate relief on the wood by some\nartist who had been dust for how many hundred years. There was the One\nPriestess, breathing in the drug-fumes from the trays of bronze and\nprophesying or advising the king, whose nose was broken off in this frame; the\nface of the Priestess was too small to have clear features, yet Arha would\nimagine that the face was her own face. She wondered what she had told the\nking with the big nose, and whether he had been grateful.\n\nShe had favorite places in the Hall of the Throne, as one might have favorite\nspots to sit in a sunny house. She often went to a little half-loft over one\nof the robing rooms in the hinder part of the Hall. There ancient gowns and\ncostumes were kept, left from the days when great kings and lords came to\nworship at the Place of the Tombs of Atuan, acknowledging a domain greater\nthan their own or any man’s. Sometimes their daughters, the princesses, had\nput on these soft white silks, embroidered with topaz and dark amethyst, and\nhad danced with the Priestess of the Tombs. There were little painted ivory\ntables in one of the treasuries, showing such a dance, and the lords and kings\nwaiting outside the Hall, for then as now no man ever set foot on the ground\nof the Tombs. But the maidens might come in, and dance with the Priestess, in\nwhite silk. The Priestess herself wore rough cloth, homespun black, always,\nthen and now; but she liked to come and finger the sweet, soft stuff, rotten\nwith age, the unperishing jewels tearing from the cloth by their own slight\nweight. There was a scent in these chests different from all the musks and\nincenses of the temples of the Place: a fresher scent, fainter, younger.\n\nIn the treasure rooms she would spend a night learning the contents of a\nsingle chest, jewel by jewel, the rusted armor, the broken plumes of helms,\nthe buckles and pins and brooches, bronze, silver-gilt, and solid gold.\n\nOwls, undisturbed by her presence, sat on the rafters and opened and shut\ntheir yellow eyes. A bit of starlight shone in between tiles of the roof; or\nthe snow came sifting down, fine and cold as those ancient silks that fell to\nnothing at hand’s touch.\n\nOne night late in the winter, it was too cold in the Hall. She went to the\ntrapdoor, raised it, swung down onto the steps, and closed it above her. She\nset off silently on the way she now knew so well, the passage to the\nUndertomb. There, of course, she never bore a light; if she carried a lantern,\nfrom going in the Labyrinth or in the dark of night above ground, she\nextinguished it before she came near the Undertomb. She had never seen that\nplace, never in all the generations of her priestesshood. In the passage now,\nshe blew out the candle in the lamp she carried, and without slowing her pace\nat all went forward in the pitch dark, easy as a little fish in dark water.\nHere, winter or summer, there was no cold, no heat: always the same even\nchill, a little damp, changeless. Up above, the great frozen winds of winter\nwhipped thin snow over the desert. Here there was no wind, no season; it was\nclose, it was still, it was safe.\n\nShe was going to the Painted Room. She liked sometimes to go there and study\nthe strange wall drawings that leapt out of the dark at the gleam of her\ncandle: men with long wings and great eyes, serene and morose. No one could\ntell her what they were, there were no such paintings elsewhere in the Place,\nbut she thought she knew; they were the spirits of the damned, who are not\nreborn. The Painted Room was in the Labyrinth, so she must pass through the\ncavern beneath the Tombstones first. As she approached it down the slanting\npassage, a faint gray bloomed, a bare hint and glimmer, the echo of an echo of\na distant light.\n\nShe thought her eyes were tricking her, as they often did in that utter\nblackness. She closed them, and the glimmering vanished. She opened them, and\nit reappeared.\n\nShe had stopped and was standing still. Gray, not black. A dull edge of\npallor, just visible, where nothing could be visible, where all must be black.\n\nShe took a few steps forward and put out her hand to that angle of the tunnel\nwall; and, infinitely faint, saw the movement of her hand.\n\nShe went on. This was strange beyond thought, beyond fear, this faint blooming\nof light where no light had ever been, in the inmost grave of darkness. She\nwent noiseless on bare feet, blackclothed. At the last turn of the corridor\nshe halted; then very slowly took the last step, and looked, and saw.\n\nSaw what she had never seen, not though she had lived a hundred lives: the\ngreat vaulted cavern beneath the Tombstones, not hollowed by man’s hand but by\nthe powers of the Earth. It was jeweled with crystals and ornamented with\npinnacles and filigrees of white limestone where the waters under earth had\nworked, eons since: immense, with glittering roof and walls, sparkling,\ndelicate, intricate, a palace of diamonds, a house of amethyst and crystal,\nfrom which the ancient darkness had been driven out by glory.\n\nNot bright, but dazzling to the dark-accustomed eye, was the light that worked\nthis wonder. It was a soft gleam, like marshlight, that moved slowly across\nthe cavern, striking a thousand scintillations from the jeweled roof and\nshifting a thousand fantastic shadows along the carven walls.\n\nThe light burned at the end of a staff of wood, smokeless, unconsuming. The\nstaff was held by a human hand. Arha saw the face beside the light; the dark\nface: the face of a man.\n\nShe did not move.\n\nFor a long time he crossed and recrossed the vast cave. He moved as if he\nsought something, looking behind the lacy cataracts of stone, studying the\nseveral corridors that led out of the Undertomb, yet not entering them. And\nstill the Priestess of the Tombs stood motionless, in the black angle of the\npassage, waiting.\n\nWhat was hardest for her to think, perhaps, was that she was looking at a\nstranger. She had very seldom seen a stranger. It seemed to her that this must\nbe one of the wardens - no, one of the men from over the wall, a goatherd or\nguard, a slave of the Place; and he had come to see the secrets of the\nNameless Ones, maybe to steal something from the Tombs...\n\nTo steal something. To rob the Dark Powers. Sacrilege: the word came slowly\ninto Arha’s mind. This was a man, and no man’s foot must ever touch the soil\nof the Tombs, the Holy Place. Yet he had come here into the hollow place that\nwas the heart of the Tombs. He had entered in. He had made light where light\nwas forbidden, where it had never been since world’s beginning. Why did the\nNameless Ones not strike him down?\n\nHe was standing now looking down at the rocky floor, which was cut and\ntroubled. One could see that it had been opened and reclosed. The sour sterile\nclods dug up for the graves had not all been stamped down again.\n\nHer Masters had eaten those three. Why did they not eat this one? What were\nthey waiting for?\n\nFor their hands to act, for their tongue to speak...\n\n“Go! Go! Begone!” she screamed all at once at the top of her voice. Great\nechoes shrilled and boomed across the cavern, seeming to blur the dark,\nstartled face that turned towards her, and, for one moment, across the shaken\nsplendor of the cavern, saw her. Then the light was gone. All splendor gone.\nBlind dark, and silence.\n\nNow she could think again. She was released from the spell of light.\n\nHe must have come in by the red rock door, the Prisoners’ Door, so he would\ntry to escape by it. Light and silent as the soft-winged owls she ran the\nhalf-circuit of the cavern to the low tunnel that led to the door which opened\nonly inwards. She stooped there at the entrance of the tunnel. There was no\ndraft of wind from outside; he had not left the door fixed open behind him. It\nwas shut, and if he was in the tunnel, he was trapped there.\n\nBut he was not in the tunnel. She was sure of it. So close, in that cramped\nplace, she would have heard his breath, felt the warmth and pulse of his life\nitself. There was no one in the tunnel. She stood erect, and listened. Where\nhad he gone?\n\nThe darkness pressed like a bandage on her eyes. To have seen the Undertomb\nconfused her; she was bewildered. She had known it only as a region defined by\nhearing, by hand’s touch, by drifts of cool air in the dark; a vastness; a\nmystery, never to be seen. She had seen it, and the mystery had given place,\nnot to horror, but to beauty, a mystery deeper even than that of the dark.\n\nShe went slowly forward now, unsure. She felt her way to the left, to the\nsecond passageway, the one that led into the Labyrinth. There she paused and\nlistened.\n\nHer ears told her no more than her eyes. But, as she stood with one hand on\neither side of the rock archway, she felt a faint, obscure vibration in the\nrock, and on the chill, stale air was the trace of a scent that did not belong\nthere: the smell of the wild sage that grew on the desert hills, overhead,\nunder the open sky.\n\nSlow and quiet she moved down the corridor, following her nose.\n\nAfter perhaps a hundred paces she heard him. He was almost as silent as she,\nbut he was not so surefooted in the dark. She heard a slight scuffle, as if he\nbad stumbled on the uneven floor and recovered himself at once. Nothing else.\nShe waited awhile and then went slowly on, touching her right hand fingertips\nvery lightly to the wall. At last a rounded bar of metal came under them.\nThere she stopped, and felt up the strip of iron until, almost as high as she\ncould reach, she touched a projecting handle of rough iron. This, suddenly,\nwith all her strength, she dragged downward.\n\nThere was a fearful grinding and a clash. Blue sparks leapt out in a falling\nshower. Echoes died away, quarreling, down the corridor behind her. She put\nout her hands and felt, only a few inches before her face, the pocked surface\nof an iron door.\n\nShe drew a long breath.\n\nReturning slowly up the tunnel to the Undertomb, and keeping its wall to her\nright, she went on to the trapdoor in the Hall of the Throne. She did not\nhasten, and went silently, though there was no need for silence any more. She\nhad caught her thief. The door that he had gone through was the only way into\nor out of the Labyrinth; and it could be opened only from the outer side.\n\nHe was down there now, in the darkness underground, and he would never come\nout again.\n\nWalking slowly and erect, she went past the Throne into the long columned\nhall. There, where one bronze bowl on the high tripod brimmed with the red\nglow of charcoal, she turned and approached the seven steps that led up to the\nThrone.\n\nOn the lowest step she knelt, and bowed her forehead down to the cold, dusty\nstone, littered with mouse bones dropped by the hunting owls.\n\n“Forgive me that I have seen Your darkness broken,” she said, not speaking the\nwords aloud. “Forgive me that I have seen Your tombs violated. You will be\navenged. O my Masters, death will deliver him to you, and he will never be\nreborn!”\n\nYet even as she prayed, in her mind’s eye she saw the quivering radiance of\nthe lighted cavern, life in the place of death; and instead of terror at the\nsacrilege and rage against the thief, she thought only how strange it was, how\nstrange...\n\n“What must I tell Kossil?” she asked herself as she came out into the blast of\nthe winter wind and drew her cloak about her. “Nothing. Not yet. I am mistress\nof the Labyrinth. This is no business of the Godking’s. I’ll tell her after\nthe thief is dead, perhaps. How must I kill him? I should make Kossil come and\nwatch him die. She’s fond of death. What is it he was seeking? He must be mad.\nHow did he get in? Kossil and I have the only keys to the red rock door and\nthe trapdoor. He must have come by the red rock door. Only a sorcerer could\nopen it. A sorcerer-“\n\nShe halted, though the wind almost buffeted her off her feet.\n\n“He is a sorcerer, a wizard of the Inner Lands, seeking the amulet of Erreth-\nAkbe.”\n\nAnd there was such an outrageous glamor in this, that she grew warm all over,\neven in that icy wind, and laughed out loud. All around her the Place, and the\ndesert around it, was black and silent; the wind keened; there were no lights\ndown in the Big House. Thin, invisible snow flicked past on the wind.\n\n“If he opened the red rock door with sorcery, he can open others. He can\nescape.”\n\nThis thought chilled her for a moment, but it did not convince her. The\nNameless Ones had let him enter. Why not? He could not do any harm. What harm\nis a thief who can’t leave the scene of his theft? Spells and black powers he\nmust have, and strong ones no doubt, since he had got that far; but he would\nnot get farther. No spell cast by mortal man could be stronger than the will\nof the Nameless Ones, the presences in the Tombs, the Kings whose Throne was\nempty.\n\nTo reassure herself of this, she hastened on down to the Small House. Manan\nwas asleep on the porch, rolled up in his cloak and the ratty fur blanket that\nwas his winter bed. She entered quietly, so as not to awaken him, and without\nlighting any lamp. She opened a little locked room, a mere closet at the end\nof the hall. She struck a flint spark long enough to find a certain place on\nthe floor, and kneeling, pried up one tile. A bit of heavy, dirty cloth, only\na few inches square, was revealed to her touch. This she slipped aside\nnoiselessly. She started back, for a ray of light shot upward, straight into\nher face.\n\nAfter a moment, very cautiously, she looked into the opening. She had\nforgotten that he carried that queer light on his staff. She had been\nexpecting at most to hear him, down there in the dark. She had forgotten the\nlight, but he was where she had expected him to be: right beneath the spy\nhole, at the iron door that blocked his escape from the Labyrinth.\n\nHe was standing there, one hand on his hip, the other holding out at an angle\nthe wooden staff, as tall as he was, to the tip of which clung the soft\nwill-o’-the-wisp. His head, which she looked down upon from some six feet\nabove. was cocked a bit to the side. His clothes were those of any winter\ntraveler or pilgrim, a short heavy cloak, a leather tunic, leggings of wool,\nlaced sandals; there was a light pack on his back, a water bottle slung from\nit, a knife sheathed at his hip. He stood there still as a statue, easy and\nthoughtful.\n\nSlowly he raised his staff from the ground, and held the bright tip of it out\ntowards the door, which Arha could not see from her spy hole. The light\nchanged, growing smaller and brighter, an intense brilliance. He spoke aloud.\nThe language he spoke was strange to Arha, but stranger to her than the words\nwas the voice, deep and resonant.\n\nThe light on the staff brightened, flickered, dimmed. For a moment it died\nquite away, and she could not see him.\n\nThe pale violet marshlight reappeared, steady, and she saw him turn away from\nthe door. His spell of opening had failed. The powers that held the lock fast\non that door were stronger than any magic he possessed.\n\nHe looked about him, as if thinking, now what?\n\nThe tunnel or corridor in which he stood was about five feet wide. Its roof\nwas from twelve to fifteen feet above the rough rock floor. The walls here\nwere of dressed stone, laid without mortar but very carefully and closely, so\nthat one could scarcely slip a knife-tip into the joints. They leaned inward\nincreasingly as they rose, forming a vault.\n\nThere was nothing else.\n\nHe started forward. One stride took him out of Arha’s range of vision. The\nlight died away. She was about to replace the cloth and the tile, when again\nthe soft shaft of light rose up out of the floor before her. He had come back\nto the door. Perhaps he had realized that if he once left it and entered the\nmaze, he was not very likely to find it again.\n\nHe spoke, one word only, in a low voice. “Emenn,” he said, and then again,\nlouder, “Emenn!” And the iron door rattled in its jambs, and low echoes rolled\ndown the vaulted tunnel like thunder, and it seemed to Arha that the floor\nbeneath her shook.\n\nBut the door stayed fast.\n\nHe laughed then, a short laugh, that of a man who thinks, “What a fool I’ve\nmade of myself!” He looked around the walls once more, and as he glanced\nupward Arha saw the smile lingering on his dark face. Then he sat down,\nunslung his pack, got out a piece of dry bread, and munched on it. He\nunstopped his leather bottle of water and shook it; it looked light in his\nhand, as if nearly empty. He replaced the stopper without drinking. He put the\npack behind him for a pillow, pulled his cloak around him, and lay down. His\nstaff was in his right hand. As he lay back, the little wisp or ball of light\nfloated upward from the staff and hung dimly behind his head, a few feet off\nthe ground. His left hand was on his breast, holding something that hung from\na heavy chain around his neck. He lay there quite comfortable, legs crossed at\nthe ankle; his gaze wandered across the spy hole and away; he sighed and\nclosed his eyes. The light grew slowly dimmer. He slept.\n\nThe clenched hand on his breast relaxed and slipped aside, and the watcher\nabove saw then what talisman he wore on the chain: a bit of rough metal,\ncrescent-shaped, it seemed.\n\nThe faint glimmer of his sorcery died away. He lay in silence and the dark.\n\nArha replaced the cloth and reset the tile in its place, rose cautiously and\nslipped away to her room. There she lay long awake in the wind-loud darkness,\nseeing always before her the crystal radiance that had shimmered in the house\nof death, the soft unburning fire, the stones of the tunnel wall, the quiet\nface of the man asleep.\n\n\n#  The Man Trap\n\nNext day, when she had finished with her duties at the various temples, and\nwith her teaching of the sacred dances to the novices, she slipped away to the\nSmall House and, darkening the room, opened the spy hole and peered down it.\nThere was no light. He was gone. She had not thought he would stay so long at\nthe unavailing door, but it was the only place she knew to look. How was she\nto find him now that he had lost himself?\n\nThe tunnels of the Labyrinth, by Thar’s account and her own experience,\nextended in all their windings, branchings, spirals, and dead ends, for more\nthan twenty miles. The blind alley that lay farthest from the Tombs was not\nmuch more than a mile away in a straight line, probably. But down underground,\nnothing ran straight. All the tunnels curved, split, rejoined, branched,\ninterlaced, looped, traced elaborate routes that ended where they began, for\nthere was no beginning, and no end. One could go, and go, and go, and still\nget nowhere, for there was nowhere to get to. There was no center, no heart of\nthe maze. And once the door was locked, there was no end to it. No direction\nwas right.\n\nThough the ways and turnings to the various rooms and regions were firm in\nArha’s memory, even she had taken with her on her longer explorations a ball\nof fine yarn, and let it unravel behind her, and rewound it as she followed it\nreturning. For if one of the turns and passages that must be counted were\nmissed, even she might be lost. A light was no help, for there were no,\nlandmarks. All the corridors, all the doorways and openings, were alike.\n\nHe might have gone miles by now, and yet not be forty feet from the door where\nhe had entered.\n\nShe went to the Hall of the Throne, and to the Twin Gods’ temple, and to the\ncellar under the kitchens, and, choosing a moment when she was alone, looked\nthrough each of those spy holes down into the cold, thick dark. When night\ncame, freezing and blazing with stars, she went to certain places on the Hill\nand raised up certain stones, cleared away the earth, peered down again, and\nsaw the starless darkness underground.\n\nHe was there. He must be there. Yet he had escaped her. He would die of thirst\nbefore she found him. She would have to send Manan into the maze to find him,\nonce she was sure he was dead. That was unbearable to think of. As she knelt\nin the starlight on the bitter ground of the Hill, tears of rage rose in her\neyes.\n\nShe went to the path that led back down the slope to the temple of the\nGodking. The columns with their carved capitals shone white with hoarfrost in\nthe starlight, like pillars of bone. She knocked at the rear door, and Kossil\nlet her in.\n\n“What brings my mistress?” said the stout woman, cold and watchful.\n\n“Priestess, there is a man within the Labyrinth.”\n\nKossil was taken off guard; for once something had occurred that she did not\nexpect. She stood and stared. Her eyes seemed to swell a little. It flitted\nacross Arha’s mind that Kossil looked very like Penthe imitating Kossil, and a\nwild laugh rose up in her, was repressed, and died away.\n\n“A man? In the Labyrinth?”\n\n“A man, a stranger.” Then as Kossil continued to look at her with disbelief,\nshe added, “I know a man by sight, though I have seen few.”\n\nKossil disdained her irony. “How came a man there?”\n\n“By witchcraft, I think. His skin is dark, perhaps he is from the Inner Lands.\nHe came to rob the Tombs. I found him first in the Undertomb, beneath the very\nStones. He ran to the entrance of the Labyrinth when he became aware of me, as\nif he knew where he went. I locked the iron door behind him. He made spells,\nbut that did not open the door. In the morning he went on into the maze. I\ncannot find him now.”\n\n“Has he a light?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Water?”\n\n“A little flask, not full.”\n\n“His candle will be burned down already.” Kossil pondered. “Four or five days.\nMaybe six. Then you can send my wardens down to drag the body out. The blood\nshould be fed to the Throne and the -“\n\n“No,” Arha said with sudden, shrill fierceness. “I wish to find him alive.”\n\nThe priestess looked down at the girl from her heavy height. “Why?”\n\n“To make- to make his dying longer. He has committed sacrilege against the\nNameless Ones. He has defiled the Undertomb with light. He came to rob the\nTombs of their treasures. He must be punished with worse than lying down in a\ntunnel alone and dying.”\n\n“Yes,” Kossil said, as if deliberating. “But how will you catch him, mistress?\nThat is chancy. There is no chance about the other. Is there not a room full\nof bones, somewhere in the Labyrinth, bones of men who entered it and did not\nleave it?... Let the Dark Ones punish him in their own way, in their own ways,\nthe black ways of the Labyrinth. It is a cruel death, thirst.”\n\n“I know,” the girl said. She turned and went out into the night, pulling her\nhood up over her head against the hissing, icy wind. Did she not know?\n\nIt had been childish of her, and stupid, to come to Kossil. She would get no\nhelp there. Kossil herself knew nothing, all she knew was cold waiting and\ndeath at the end of it. She did not understand. She did not see that the man\nmust be found. It must not be the same as with those others. She could not\nbear that again. Since there must be death let it be swift, in daylight.\nSurely it would be more fitting that this thief, the first man in centuries\nbrave enough to try to rob the Tombs, should die by sword’s edge. He did not\neven have an immortal soul to be reborn. His ghost would go whining through\nthe corridors. He could not be let die of thirst there alone in the dark.\n\nArha slept very little that night. The next day was filled with rites and\nduties. She spent the night going, silent and without lantern, from one spy\nhole to another in all the dark buildings of the Place, and on the windswept\nhill. She went to the Small House to bed at last, two or three hours before\ndawn, but still she could not rest. On the third day, late in the afternoon,\nshe walked out alone onto the desert, towards the river that now lay low in\nthe winter drought, with ice among the reeds. A memory had come to her that\nonce, in the autumn, she had gone very far in the Labyrinth, past the Six-\nCross, and all along one long curving corridor she had heard behind the stones\nthe sound of running water. Might not a man athirst, if he came that way, stay\nthere? There were spy holes even out here; she had to search for them, but\nThar had shown her each one, last year, and she refound them without much\ntrouble. Her recall of place and shape was like that of a blind person: she\nseemed to feel her way to each hidden spot, rather than to look for it. At the\nsecond, the farthest of all from the Tombs, when she pulled up her hood to cut\nout light, and put her eye to the hole cut in a flat pan of rock, she saw\nbelow her the dim glimmer of the wizardly light.\n\nHe was there, half out of sight. The spy hole looked down at the very end of\nthe blind alley. She could see only his back, and bent neck, and right arm. He\nsat near the corner of the walls, and was picking at the stones with his\nknife, a short dagger of steel with a jeweled grip. The blade of it was broken\nshort. The broken point lay directly under the spy hole. He had snapped it\ntrying to pry apart the stones, to get at the water he could hear running,\nclear and murmurous in that dead stillness under earth, on the other side of\nthe impenetrable wall.\n\nHis movements were listless. He was very different, after these three nights\nand days, from the figure that had stood lithe and calm before the iron door\nand laughed at his own defeat. He was still obstinate, but the power was gone\nout of him. He had no spell to stir those stones aside, but must use his\nuseless knife. Even his sorcerer’s light was wan and dim. As Arha watched, the\nlight flickered; the man’s head jerked and he dropped the dagger. Then\ndoggedly he picked it up and tried to force the broken blade between the\nstones.\n\nLying among ice-bound reeds on the riverbank, unconscious of where she was or\nwhat she was doing, Arha put her mouth to the cold mouth of rock, and cupped\nher hands around to hold the sound in. “Wizard!” she said, and her voice\nslipping down the stone throat whispered coldly in the tunnel underground.\n\nThe man started and scrambled to his feet, so going out of the circle of her\nvision when she looked for him. She put her mouth to the spy hole again and\nsaid, “Go back along the river wall to the second turn. The first turn right,\nmiss one, then right again. At the Six Ways, right again. Then left, and\nright, and left, and right. Stay there in the Painted Room.”\n\nAs she moved to look again, she must have let a shaft of daylight shoot\nthrough the spy hole into the tunnel for a moment, for when she looked he was\nback in the circle of her vision and staring upwards at the opening. His face,\nwhich she now saw to be scarred in some way, was strained and eager. The lips\nwere parched and black, the eyes bright. He raised his staff, bringing the\nlight closer and closer to her eyes. Frightened, she drew back, stopped the\nspy hole with its rock lid and litter of covering stones, rose, and went back\nswiftly to the Place. She found her hands were shaky, and sometimes a\ngiddiness swept over her as she walked. She did not know what to do.\n\nIf he followed the directions she had given him, he would come back in the\ndirection of the iron door, to the room of pictures. There was nothing there,\nno reason for him to go there. There was a spy hole in the ceiling of the\nPainted Room, a good one, in the treasury of the Twin Gods’ temple; perhaps\nthat was why she had thought of it. She did not know. Why had she spoken to\nhim?\n\nShe could let a little water for him down one of the spy holes, and then call\nhim to that place. That would keep him alive longer. As long as she pleased,\nindeed. If she put down water and a little food now and then, he would go on\nand on, days, months, wandering in the Labyrinth: and she could watch him\nthrough the spy holes, and tell him where water was to be found, and sometimes\ntell him falsely so he would go in vain, but he would always have to go. That\nwould teach him to mock the Nameless Ones, to swagger his foolish manhood in\nthe burial places of the Immortal Dead!\n\nBut so long as he was there, she would never be able to enter the Labyrinth\nherself. Why not? she asked herself, and replied- Because he might escape by\nthe iron door, which I must leave open behind me... But he could escape no\nfarther than the Undertomb. The truth was that she was afraid to face him. She\nwas afraid of his power, the arts he had used to enter the Undertomb, the\nsorcery that kept that light burning. And yet, was that so much to be feared?\nThe powers that ruled in the dark places were on her side, not his. Plainly he\ncould not do much, there in the realm of the Nameless Ones. He had not opened\nthe iron door; he had not summoned magic food, nor brought water through the\nwall, nor conjured up some demon monster to break down the walls, all of which\nshe had feared he might be able to do. He had not even found his way in three\ndays’ wandering to the door of the Great Treasury, which surely he had sought.\nArha herself had never yet pursued Thar’s directions to that room, putting off\nand putting off the journey out of a certain awe, a reluctance, a sense that\nthe time had not yet come.\n\nNow she thought, why should he not go that journey for her? He could look all\nhe liked at the treasures of the Tombs. Much good they would do him! She could\njeer at him, and tell him to eat the gold, and drink the diamonds.\n\nWith the nervous, feverish hastiness that had possessed her all these three\ndays, she ran to the Twin Gods’ temple, unlocked its little vaulted treasury,\nand uncovered the well-hidden spy hole in the floor.\n\nThe Painted Room was below, but pitch dark. The way the man must follow in the\nmaze was much more roundabout, miles longer perhaps; she had forgotten that.\nAnd no doubt he was weakened and not going fast. Perhaps he would forget her\ndirections and take the wrong turning. Few people could remember directions\nfrom one hearing of them, as she could. Perhaps he did not even understand the\ntongue she spoke. If so, let him wander till he fell down and died in the\ndark, the fool, the foreigner, the unbeliever. Let his ghost whine down the\nstone roads of the Tombs of Atuan until the darkness ate even it...\n\nNext morning very early, after a night of little sleep and evil dreams, she\nreturned to the spy hole in the little temple. She looked down and saw\nnothing: blackness. She lowered a candle burning in a little tin lantern on a\nchain. He was there, in the Painted Room. She saw, past the candle’s glare,\nhis legs and one limp hand. She spoke into the spy hole, which was a large\none, the size of a whole floor tile: “Wizard!”\n\nNo movement. Was he dead? Was that all the strength he had in him? She\nsneered; her heart pounded. “Wizard!” she cried, her voice ringing in the\nhollow room beneath. He stirred, and slowly sat up, and looked around\nbewildered. After a while he looked up, blinking at the tiny lantern that\nswung from his ceiling. His face was terrible to see, swollen, dark as a\nmummy’s face.\n\nHe put his hand out to his staff that lay on the floor beside him, but no\nlight flowered on the wood. There was no power left in him.\n\n“Do you want to see the treasure of the Tombs of Atuan, wizard?”\n\nHe looked up wearily, squinting at the light of her lantern, which was all he\ncould see. After a while, with a wince that might have begun as a smile, he\nnodded once.\n\n“Go out of this room to the left. Take the first corridor to the left...” She\nrattled off the long series of directions without pause, and at the end said,\n“There you will find the treasure which you came for. And there, maybe, you’ll\nfind water. Which would you rather have now, wizard?”\n\nHe got to his feet, leaning on his staff. Looking up with eyes that could not\nsee her, he tried to say something, but there was no voice in his dry throat.\nHe shrugged a little, and left the Painted Room.\n\nShe would not give him any water. He would never find the way to the treasure\nroom, anyway. The instructions were too long for him to remember; and there\nwas the Pit, if he got that far. He was in the dark, now. He would lose his\nway, and would fall down at last and die somewhere in the narrow, hollow, dry\nhalls. And Manan would find him and drag him out. And that was the end. Arha\nclutched the lip of the spy hole with her hands, and rocked her crouching body\nback and forth, back and forth, biting her lip as if to bear some dreadful\npain. She would not give him any water. She would not give him any water. She\nwould give him death, death, death, death, death.\n\nIn that gray hour of her life, Kossil came to her, entering the treasury room\nwith heavy step, bulky in black winter robes.\n\n“Is the man dead yet?”\n\nArha raised her head. There were no tears in her eyes, nothing to hide.\n\n“I think so,” she said, getting up and dusting her skirts. “His light has gone\nout.”\n\n“He may be tricking. The soulless ones are very cunning.”\n\n“I shall wait a day to be sure.”\n\n“Yes, or two days. Then Duby can go down and bring it out. He is stronger than\nold Manan.”\n\n“But Manan is in the service of the Nameless Ones, and Duby is not. There are\nplaces within the Labyrinth where Duby should not go, and the thief is in one\nof these.”\n\n“Why, then it is defiled already-“\n\n“It will be made clean by his death there,” Arha said. She could see by\nKossil’s expression that there must be something strange about her own face.\n“This is my domain, priestess. I must care for it as my Masters bid me. I do\nnot need more lessons in death.”\n\nKossil’s face seemed to withdraw into the black hood, like a desert tortoise’s\ninto its shell, sour and slow and cold. “Very well, mistress.”\n\nThey parted before the altar of the God-Brothers. Arha went, without haste\nnow, to the Small House, and called Manan to accompany her. Since she had\nspoken to Kossil she knew what must be done.\n\nShe and Manan went together up the hill, into the Hall, down into the\nUndertomb. Straining together at the long handle, they opened the iron door of\nthe Labyrinth. They lit their lanterns there, and entered. Arha led the way to\nthe Painted Room, and from it started on the way to the Great Treasury.\n\nThe thief had not got very far. She and Manan had not walked five hundred\npaces on their tortuous course when they came upon him, crumpled up in the\nnarrow corridor like a heap of rags thrown down. He had dropped his staff\nbefore he fell; it lay some distance from him. His mouth was bloody, his eyes\nhalf shut.\n\n“He’s alive,” said Manan, kneeling, his great yellow hand on the dark throat,\nfeeling the pulse. “Shall I strangle him, mistress?”\n\n“No. I want him alive. Pick him up and bring him after me.”\n\n“Alive?” said Manan, disturbed. “What for, little mistress?”\n\n“To be a slave of the Tombs! Be still with your talk and do as I say.”\n\nHis face more melancholy than ever, Manan obeyed, hoisting the young man\neffortfully up onto his shoulders like a long sack. He staggered along after\nArha thus laden. He could not go far at a time under that load. They stopped a\ndozen times on the return journey for Manan to catch his breath. At each halt\nthe corridor was the same: the grayish-yellow, close-set stones rising to a\nvault, the uneven rocky floor, the dead air; Manan groaning and panting, the\nstranger lying still, the two lanterns burning dull in a dome of light that\nnarrowed away into darkness down the corridor in both directions. At each halt\nArha dripped some of the water she had brought in a flask into the dry mouth\nof the man, a little at a time, lest life returning kill him.\n\n“To the Room of Chains?” Manan asked, as they were in the passage that led to\nthe iron door; and at that, Arha thought for the first time where she must\ntake this prisoner. She did not know.\n\n“Not there, no,” she said, sickened as ever by the memory of the smoke and\nreek and the matted, speechless, unseeing faces. And Kossil might come to the\nRoom of Chains “He... he must stay in the Labyrinth, so that he cannot regain\nhis sorcery. Where is there a room...”\n\n“The Painted Room has a door, and a lock, and a spy hole, mistress. If you\ntrust him with doors.”\n\n“He has no powers, down here. Take him there, Manan.”\n\nSo Manan lugged him back, half again as far as they had come, too laboring and\nbreathless to protest. When they entered the Painted Room at last, Arha took\noff her long, heavy winter cloak of wool, and laid it on the dusty floor. “Put\nhim on that,” she said.\n\nManan stared in melancholy consternation, wheezing. “Little mistress-“\n\n“I want the man to live, Manan. He’ll die of the cold, look how he shakes\nnow.”\n\n“Your garment will be defiled. The Priestess’ garment. He is an unbeliever, a\nman,” Manan blurted, his small eyes wrinkling up as if in pain.\n\n“Then I shall burn the cloak and have another woven! Come on, Manan!”\n\nAt that he stooped, obedient, and let the prisoner flop off his back onto the\nblack cloak. The man lay still as death, but the pulse beat heavy in his\nthroat, and now and then a spasm made his body shiver as it lay.\n\n“He should be chained,” said Manan.\n\n“Does he look dangerous?” Arha scoffed; but when Manan pointed out an iron\nhasp set into the stones, to which the prisoner could be fastened, she let him\ngo fetch a chain and band from the Room of Chains. He grumbled off down the\ncorridors, muttering the directions to himself; he had been to and from the\nPainted Room before this, but never by himself.\n\nIn the light of her single lantern the paintings on the four walls seemed to\nmove, to twitch, the uncouth human forms with great drooping wings, squatting\nand standing in a timeless dreariness.\n\nShe knelt and let water drop, a little at a time, into the prisoner’s mouth.\nAt last he coughed, and his hands reached up feebly to the flask. She let him\ndrink. He lay back with his face all wet, besmeared with dust and blood, and\nmuttered something, a word or two in a language she did not know.\n\nManan returned at last, dragging a length of iron links, a great padlock with\nits key, and an iron band which fitted around the man’s waist and locked\nthere. “It’s not tight enough, he can slip out,” he grumbled as he locked the\nend link onto the ring set in the wall.\n\n“No, look.” Feeling less fearful of her prisoner now, Arha showed that she\ncould not force her hand between the iron band and the man’s ribs. “Not unless\nhe starves longer than four days.”\n\n“Little mistress,” Manan said plaintively, “I do not question, but... what\ngood is he as a slave to the Nameless Ones? He is a man, little one.”\n\n“And you are an old fool, Manan. Come along now, finish your fussing.”\n\nThe prisoner watched them with bright, weary eyes.\n\n“Where’s his staff, Manan? There. I’ll take that; it has magic in it. Oh, and\nthis; this I’ll take too,” and with a quick movement she seized the silver\nchain that showed at the neck of the man’s tunic, and tore it off over his\nhead, though he tried to catch her arms and stop her. Manan kicked him in the\nback. She swung the chain over him, out of his reach. “Is this your talisman,\nwizard? Is it precious to you? It doesn’t look like much, couldn’t you afford\na better one? I shall keep it safe for you.” And she slipped the chain over\nher own head, hiding the pendant under the heavy collar of her woolen robe.\n\n“You don’t know what to do with it,” he said, very hoarse, and mispronouncing\nthe words of the Kargish tongue, but clearly enough.\n\nManan kicked him again, and at that he made a little grunt of pain and shut\nhis eyes.\n\n“Leave off, Manan. Come.”\n\nShe left the room. Grumbling, Manan followed.\n\nThat night, when all the lights of the Place were out, she climbed the hill\nagain, alone. She filled her flask from the well in the room behind the\nThrone, and took the water and a big, flat, unleavened cake of buckwheat bread\ndown to the Painted Room in the Labyrinth. She set them just within the\nprisoner’s reach, inside the door. He was asleep, and never stirred. She\nreturned to the Small House, and that night she too slept long and sound.\n\nIn early afternoon she returned alone to the Labyrinth. The bread was gone,\nthe flask was dry, the stranger was sitting up, his back against the wall. His\nface still looked hideous with dirt and scabs, but the expression of it was\nalert.\n\nShe stood across the room from him where he could not possibly reach her,\nchained as be was, and looked at him. Then she looked away. But there was\nnowhere particular to look. Something prevented her speaking. Her heart beat\nas if she were afraid. There was no reason to fear him. He was at her mercy.\n\n“It’s pleasant to have light,” he said in the soft but deep voice, which\nperturbed her.\n\n“What’s your name?” she asked, peremptory. Her own voice, she thought, sounded\nuncommonly high and thin.\n\n“Well, mostly I’m called Sparrowhawk.”\n\n“Sparrowhawk? Is that your name?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What is your name, then?”\n\n“I cannot tell you that. Are you the One Priestess of the Tombs?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“What are you called?”\n\n“I am called Arha.”\n\n“The one who has been devoured - is that what it means?” His dark eyes watched\nher intently. He smiled a little. “What is your name?”\n\n“I have no name. Do not ask me questions. Where do you come from?”\n\n“From the Inner Lands, the West.”\n\n“From Havnor?”\n\nIt was the only name of a city or island of the Inner Lands that she knew.\n\n“Yes, from Havnor.”\n\n“Why did you come here?”\n\n“The Tombs of Atuan are famous among my people.”\n\n“But you’re an infidel, an unbeliever.”\n\nHe shook his head. “Oh no, Priestess. I believe in the powers of darkness! I\nhave met with the Unnamed Ones, in other places.”\n\n“What other places?”\n\n“In the Archipelago -the Inner Lands- there are places which belong to the Old\nPowers of the Earth, like this one. But none so great as this one. Nowhere\nelse have they a temple, and a priestess, and such worship as they receive\nhere.”\n\n“You came to worship them,” she said, jeering.\n\n“I came to rob them,” he said.\n\nShe stared at his grave face. “Braggart!”\n\n“I knew it would not be easy.”\n\n“Easy! It cannot be done. If you weren’t an unbeliever you’d know that. The\nNameless Ones look after what is theirs.”\n\n“What I seek is not theirs.”\n\n“It’s yours, no doubt?”\n\n“Mine to claim.”\n\n“What are you then- a god? a king?” She looked him up and down, as he sat\nchained, dirty, exhausted. “You are nothing but a thief!”\n\nHe said nothing, but his gaze met hers.\n\n“You are not to look at me!” she said shrilly.\n\n“My lady,” he said, “I do not mean offense. I am a stranger, and a trespasser.\nI do not know your ways, nor the courtesies due the Priestess of the Tombs. I\nam at your mercy, and I ask your pardon if I offend you.”\n\nShe stood silent, and in a moment she felt the blood rising to her cheeks, hot\nand foolish. But he was not looking at her and did not see her blush. He had\nobeyed, and turned away his dark gaze.\n\nNeither spoke for some while. The painted figures all around watched them with\nsad, blind eyes.\n\nShe had brought a stone jug of water. His eyes kept straying to that, and\nafter a time she said, “Drink, if you like.”\n\nHe hitched himself over to the jug at once, and hefting it as lightly as if it\nwere a wine cup, drank a long, long draft. Then he wet a corner of his sleeve,\nand cleaned the grime and bloodclot and cobweb off his face and hands as best\nhe could. He spent some while at this, and the girl watched. When he was done\nhe looked better, but his cat-bath had revealed the scars on one side of his\nface: old scars long healed, whitish on his dark skin, four parallel ridges\nfrom eye to jawbone, as if from the scraping talons of a huge claw.\n\n“What is that?” she said. “That scar.”\n\nHe did not answer at once.\n\n“A dragon?” she said, trying to scoff. Had she not come down here to make mock\nof her victim, to torment him with his helplessness?\n\n“No, not a dragon.”\n\n“You’re not a dragonlord, at least, then.”\n\n“No,” he said rather reluctantly, “I am a dragonlord. But the scars were\nbefore that. I told you that I had met with the Dark Powers before, in other\nplaces of the earth. This on my face is the mark of one of the kinship of the\nNameless Ones. But no longer nameless, for I learned his name, in the end.”\n\n“What do you mean? What name?”\n\n“I cannot tell you that,” he said, and smiled, though his face was grave.\n\n“That’s nonsense, fool’s babble, sacrilege. They are the Nameless Ones! You\ndon’t know what you’re talking about-“\n\n“I know even better than you, Priestess,” he said, his voice deepening. “Look\nagain!” He turned his head so she must see the four terrible marks across his\ncheek.\n\n“I don’t believe you,” she said, and her voice shook.\n\n“Priestess,” he said gently, “you are not very old; you can’t have served the\nDark Ones very long.”\n\n“But I have. Very long! I am the First Priestess, the Reborn. I have served my\nmasters for a thousand years and a thousand years before that. I am their\nservant and their voice and their hands. And I am their vengeance on those who\ndefile the Tombs and look upon what is not to be seen! Stop your lying and\nyour boasting, can’t you see that if I say one word my guard will come and cut\nyour head off your shoulders? Or if I go away and lock this door, then nobody\nwill come, ever, and you’ll die here in the dark, and those I serve will eat\nyour flesh and eat your soul and leave your bones here in the dust?”\n\nQuietly, he nodded.\n\nShe stammered, and finding no more to say, swept out of the room and bolted\nthe door behind her with a clang. Let him think she wasn’t coming back! Let\nhim sweat, there in the dark, let him curse and shiver and try to work his\nfoul, useless spells!\n\nBut in her mind’s eye she saw him stretching out to sleep, as she had seen him\ndo by the iron door, serene as a sheep in a sunny meadow.\n\nShe spat at the bolted door, and made the sign to avert defilement, and went\nalmost at a run towards the Undertomb.\n\nWhile she skirted its wall on the way to the trapdoor in the Hall, her fingers\nbrushed along the fine planes and traceries of rock, like frozen lace. A\nlonging swept over her to light her lantern, to see once more, just for a\nmoment, the time-carven stone, the lovely glitter of the walls. She shut her\neyes tight and hurried on.\n\n\n#  The Great Treasure\n\nNever had the rites and duties of the day seemed so many, or so petty, or so\nlong. The little girls with their pale faces and furtive ways, the restless\nnovices, the priestesses whose looks were stern and cool but whose lives were\nall a secret brangle of jealousies and miseries and small ambitions and wasted\npassions- all these women, among whom she had always lived and who made up the\nhuman world to her, now appeared to her as both pitiable and boring.\n\nBut she who served great powers, she the priestess of grim Night, was free of\nthat pettiness. She did not have to care about the grinding meanness of their\ncommon life, the days whose one delight was likely to be getting a bigger slop\nof lamb fat over your lentils than your neighbor got... She was free of the\ndays altogether. Underground, there were no days. There was always and only\nnight.\n\nAnd in that unending night, the prisoner: the dark man, practicer of dark\narts, bound in iron and locked in stone, waiting for her to come or not to\ncome, to bring him water and bread and life, or a knife and a butcher’s bowl\nand death, just as the whim took her.\n\nShe had told no one but Kossil about the man, and Kossil had not told anyone\nelse. He had been in the Painted Room three nights and days now, and still she\nhad not asked Arha about him. Perhaps she assumed that he was dead, and that\nArha had had Manan carry the body to the Room of Bones. It was not like Kossil\nto take anything for granted; but Arha told herself that there was nothing\nstrange about Kossil’s silence. Kossil wanted everything kept secret, and\nhated to have to ask questions. And besides, Arha had told her not to meddle\nin her business. Kossil was simply obeying.\n\nHowever, if the man was supposed to be dead, Arha could not ask for food for\nhim. So, aside from stealing some apples and dried onions from the cellars of\nthe Big House, she did without food. She had her morning and evening meals\nsent to the Small House, pretending she wished to eat alone, and each night\ntook the food down to the Painted Room in the Labyrinth, all but the soups.\nShe was used to fasting for a day on up to four days at a time, and thought\nnothing about it. The fellow in the Labyrinth ate up her meager portions of\nbread and cheese and beans as a toad eats a fly: snap! it’s gone. Clearly he\ncould have done so five or six times over; but he thanked her soberly, as if\nhe were her guest and she his hostess at a table such as she had heard of in\ntales of feasts at the palace of the Godking, all set with roast meats and\nbuttered loaves and wine in crystal. He was very strange.\n\n“What is it like in the Inner Lands?”\n\nShe had brought down a little cross-leg folding stool of ivory, so that she\nwould not have to stand while she questioned him, yet would not have to sit\ndown on the floor, on his level.\n\n“Well, there are many islands. Four times forty, they say, in the Archipelago\nalone, and then there are the Reaches; no man has ever sailed all the Reaches,\nnor counted all the lands. And each is different from the others. But the\nfairest of them all, maybe, is Havnor, the great land at the center of the\nworld. In the heart of Havnor on a broad bay full of ships is the City Havnor.\nThe towers of the city are built of white marble. The house of every prince\nand merchant has a tower, so they rise up one above the other. The roofs of\nthe houses are red tile, and all the bridges over the canals are covered in\nmosaic work, red and blue and green. And the flags of the princes are all\ncolors, flying from the white towers. On the highest of all the towers the\nSword of Erreth-Akbe is set, like a pinnacle, skyward. When the sun rises on\nHavnor it flashes first on that blade and makes it bright, and when it sets\nthe Sword is golden still above the evening, for a while.”\n\n“Who was Erreth-Akbe?” she said, sly.\n\nHe looked up at her. He said nothing, but he grinned a little. Then as if on\nsecond thoughts he said, “It’s true you would know little of him here. Nothing\nbeyond his coming to the Kargish lands, perhaps. And how much of that tale do\nyou know?”\n\n“That he lost his sorcerer’s staff and his amulet and his power- like you,”\nshe answered. “He escaped from the High Priest and fled into the west, and\ndragons killed him. But if he’d come here to the Tombs, there had been no need\nof dragons.”\n\n“True enough,” said her prisoner.\n\nShe wanted no more talk of Erreth-Akbe, sensing a danger in the subject. “He\nwas a dragonlord, they say. And you say you’re one. Tell me, what is a\ndragonlord?”\n\nHer tone was always jeering, his answers direct and plain, as if he took her\nquestions in good faith.\n\n“One whom the dragons will speak with,” he said, “that is a dragonlord, or at\nleast that is the center of the matter. It’s not a trick of mastering the\ndragons, as most people think. Dragons have no masters. The question is always\nthe same, with a dragon: will he talk with you or will he eat you? If you can\ncount upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why then you’re a\ndragonlord.”\n\n“Dragons can speak?”\n\n“Surely! In the Eldest Tongue, the language we men learn so hard and use so\nbrokenly, to make our spells of magic and of patterning. No man knows all that\nlanguage, or a tenth of it. He has not time to learn it. But dragons live a\nthousand years... They are worth talking to, as you might guess.”\n\n“Are there dragons here in Atuan?”\n\n“Not for many centuries, I think, nor in Karego-At. But in your northernmost\nisland, Hur-at-Hur, they say there are still large dragons in the mountains.\nIn the Inner Lands they all keep now to the farthest west, the remote West\nReach, islands where no men live and few men come. If they grow hungry, they\nraid the lands to their east; but that is seldom. I have seen the island where\nthey come to dance together. They fly on their great wings in spirals, in and\nout, higher and higher over the western sea, like a storming of yellow leaves\nin autumn.” Full of the vision, his eyes gazed through the black paintings on\nthe walls, through the walls and the earth and the darkness, seeing the open\nsea stretch unbroken to the sunset, the golden dragons on the golden wind.\n\n“You are lying,” the girl said fiercely, “you are making it up.”\n\nHe looked at her, startled. “Why should I lie, Arha?”\n\n“To make me feel like a fool, and stupid, and afraid. To make yourself seem\nwise, and brave, and powerful, and a dragon-lord and all this and all that.\nYou’ve seen dragons dancing, and the towers in Havnor, and you know all about\neverything. And I know nothing at all and haven’t been anywhere. But all you\nknow is lies! You are nothing but a thief and a prisoner, and you have no\nsoul, and you’ll never leave this place again. It doesn’t matter if there’s\noceans and dragons and white towers and all that, because you’ll never see\nthem again, you’ll never even see the light of the sun. All I know is the\ndark, the night underground. And that’s all there really is. That’s all there\nis to know, in the end. The silence, and the dark. You know everything,\nwizard. But I know one thing - the one true thing!”\n\nHe bowed his head. His long hands, copper-brown, were quiet on his knees. She\nsaw the fourfold scar on his cheek. He had gone farther than she into the\ndark; he knew death better than she did, even death... A rush of hatred for\nhim rose up in her, choking her throat for an instant. Why did he sit there so\ndefenseless and so strong? Why could she not defeat him?\n\n“This is why I have let you live,” she said suddenly, without the least\nforethought. “I want you to show me how the tricks of sorcerers are performed.\nSo long as you have some art to show me, you’ll stay alive. If you have none,\nif it’s all foolery and lies, why then I’ll have done with you. Do you\nunderstand?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Very well. Go on.”\n\nHe put his head in his hands a minute, and shifted his position. The iron belt\nkept him from ever getting quite comfortable, unless he lay down flat.\n\nHe raised his face at last and spoke very seriously. “Listen, Arha. I am a\nMage, what you call a sorcerer. I have certain arts and powers. That’s true.\nIt’s also true that here in the Place of the Old Powers, my strength is very\nlittle and my crafts don’t avail me. Now I could work illusion for you, and\nshow you all kinds of wonders. That’s the least part of wizardry. I could work\nillusions when I was a child; I can do them even here. But if you believe\nthem, they’ll frighten you, and you may wish to kill me if fear makes you\nangry. And if you disbelieve them, you’ll see them as only lies and foolery,\nas you say; and so I forfeit my life again. And my purpose and desire, at the\nmoment, is to stay alive.”\n\nThat made her laugh, and she said, “Oh, you’ll stay alive awhile, can’t you\nsee that? You are stupid! All right, show me these illusions. I know them to\nbe false and won’t be afraid of them. I wouldn’t be afraid if they were real,\nas a matter of fact. But go ahead. Your precious skin is safe, for tonight,\nanyhow.”\n\nAt that he laughed, as she had a moment ago. They tossed his life back and\nforth between them like a ball, playing.\n\n“What do you wish me to show you?”\n\n“What can you show me?”\n\n“Anything.”\n\n“How you brag and brag!”\n\n“No,” he said, evidently a little stung. “I do not. I didn’t mean to, anyway.”\n\n“Show me something you think worth seeing. Anything!”\n\nHe bent his head and looked at his hands awhile. Nothing happened. The tallow\ncandle in her lantern burned dim and steady. The black pictures on the walls,\nthe bird-winged, flightless figures with eyes painted dull red and white,\nloomed over him and over her. There was no sound. She sighed, disappointed and\nsomehow grieved. He was weak; he talked great things, but did nothing. He was\nnothing but a good liar, and not even a good thief. “Well,” she said at last,\nand gathered her skirts together to rise. The wool rustled strangely as she\nmoved. She looked down at herself, and stood up in startlement.\n\nThe heavy black she had worn for years was gone; her dress was of turquoise-\ncolored silk, bright and soft as the evening sky. It belled out full from her\nhips, and all the skirt was embroidered with thin silver threads and seed\npearls and tiny crumbs of crystal, so that it glittered softly, like rain in\nApril.\n\nShe looked at the magician, speechless.\n\n“Do you like it?”\n\n“Where-“\n\n“It’s like a gown I saw a princess wear once, at the Feast of Sunreturn in the\nNew Palace in Havnor,” he said, looking at it with satisfaction. “You told me\nto show you something worth seeing. I show you yourself.”\n\n“Make it- make it go away.”\n\n“You gave me your cloak,” he said as if in reproach. “Can I give you nothing?\nWell, don’t worry. It’s only illusion; see.”\n\nHe seemed not to raise a finger, certainly he said no word; but the blue\nsplendor of silk was gone, and she stood in her own harsh black.\n\nShe stood still awhile.\n\n“How do I know,” she said at last, “that you are what you seem to be?”\n\n“You don’t,” said he. “I don’t know what I seem, to you.”\n\nShe brooded again. “You could trick me into seeing you as-“ She broke off, for\nhe had raised his hand and pointed upward, the briefest sketch of a gesture.\nShe thought he was casting a spell, and drew back quickly towards the door;\nbut following his gesture, her eyes found high in the dark arching roof the\nsmall square that was the spy hole from the treasury of the Twin Gods’ temple.\n\nThere was no light from the spy hole; she could see nothing, hear no one\noverhead there; but he had pointed, and his questioning gaze was on her.\n\nBoth held perfectly still for some time.\n\n“Your magic is mere folly for the eyes of children,” she said clearly. “It is\ntrickery and lies. I have seen enough. You will be fed to the Nameless Ones. I\nshall not come again.”\n\nShe took her lantern and went out, and sent the iron bolts home firm and loud.\nThen she stopped there outside the door and stood dismayed. What must she do?\n\nHow much had Kossil seen or heard? What had they been saying? She could not\nremember. She never seemed to say what she had intended to say to the\nprisoner. He always confused her with his talk about dragons, and towers, and\ngiving names to the Nameless, and wanting to stay alive, and being grateful\nfor her cloak to lie on. He never said what he was supposed to say. She had\nnot even asked him about the talisman, which she still wore, hidden against\nher breast.\n\nThat was just as well, since Kossil had been listening.\n\nWell, what did it matter, what harm could Kossil do? Even as she asked herself\nthe question she knew the answer. Nothing is easier to kill than a caged hawk.\nThe man was helpless, chained there in the cage of stone. The Priestess of the\nGodking had only to send her servant Duby to throttle him tonight; or if she\nand Duby did not know the Labyrinth this far, all she need do was blow poison-\ndust down the spy hole into the Painted Room. She had boxes and phials of evil\nsubstances, some to poison food or water, some that drugged the air, and\nkilled, if one breathed that air too long. And he would be dead in the\nmorning, and it would all be over. There would never be a light beneath the\nTombs again.\n\nArha hastened through the narrow ways of stone to the entrance from the\nUndertomb, where Manan waited for her, squatting patient as an old toad in the\ndark. He was uneasy about her visits to the prisoner. She would not let him\ncome with her all the way, so they had settled on this compromise. Now she was\nglad that he was there at hand. Him, at least, she could trust.\n\n“Manan, listen. You are to go to the Painted Room, right now. Say to the man\nthat you’re taking him to be buried alive beneath the Tombs.” Manan’s little\neyes lit up. “Say that aloud. Unlock the chain, and take him to-“ She halted,\nfor she had not yet decided where she could best hide the prisoner.\n\n“To the Undertomb,” said Manan, eagerly.\n\n“No, fool. I said to say that, not do it. Wait-“\n\nWhat place was safe from Kossil and Kossil’s spies? None but the deepest\nplaces underground, the holiest and most hidden places of the domain of the\nNameless, where she dared not come. Yet would Kossil not dare almost anything?\nAfraid of the dark places she might be, but she was one who would subdue her\nfear to gain her ends. There was no telling how much of the plan of the\nLabyrinth she might actually have learned, from Thar, or from the Arha of the\nprevious life, or even from secret explorations of her own in past yeas; Arha\nsuspected her of knowing more than she pretended to know. But there was one\nway she surely could not have learned, the best-kept secret.\n\n“You must bring the man where I lead you, and you must do it in the dark. Then\nwhen I bring you back here, you will dig a grave in the Undertomb, and make a\ncoffin for it, and put it in the grave empty, and fill in the earth again, yet\nso that it can be felt and found if someone sought for it. A deep grave. Do\nyou understand?”\n\n“No,” said Manan, dour and fretful. “Little one, this trickery is not wise. It\nis not good. There should not be a man here! There will come a punishment-“\n\n“An old fool will have his tongue cut out, yes! Do you dare tell me what is\nwise? I follow the orders of the Dark Powers. Follow me!”\n\n“I’m sorry, little mistress, I’m sorry...”\n\nThey returned to the Painted Room. There she waited outside in the tunnel,\nwhile Manan entered and unlocked the chain from the hasp in the wall. She\nheard the deep voice ask, “Where now, Manan?” and the husky alto answer,\nsullenly, “You are to be buried alive, my mistress says. Under the Tombstones.\nGet up!” She heard the heavy chain crack like a whip.\n\nThe prisoner came out, his arms bound with Manan’s leather belt. Manan came\nbehind, holding him like a dog on a short leash, but the collar was around his\nwaist and the leash was iron. His eyes turned to her, but she blew out her\ncandle and without a word set off into the dark. She fell at once into the\nslow but fairly steady pace that she usually kept when she was not using a\nlight in the Labyrinth, brushing her fingertips very lightly but almost\nconstantly along the walls on either side. Manan and the prisoner followed\nbehind, much more awkward because of the leash, shuffling and stumbling along.\nBut in the dark they must go; for she did not want either of them to learn\nthis way.\n\nA left turn from the Painted Room, and pass two openings; go right at the Four\nWays, and pass the opening to the right; then a long curving way, and a flight\nof steps down, long, slippery, and much too narrow for normal human feet.\nFarther than these steps she had never gone.\n\nThe air was fouler here, very still, with a sharp odor to it. The directions\nwere clear in her mind, even the tones of Thar’s voice speaking them. Down the\nsteps (behind her, the prisoner stumbled in the pitch blackness, and she heard\nhim gasp as Manan kept him afoot with a mighty jerk on the chain), and at the\nfoot of the steps turn at once to the left. Hold the left, then for three\nopenings, then the first right, then hold to the right. The tunnels curved and\nangled, none ran straight. “Then you must skirt the Pit,” said Thar’s voice in\nthe darkness of her mind, “and the way is very narrow.”\n\nShe slowed her step, stooped over, and felt before her with one hand along the\nfloor. The corridor now ran straight for a long way, giving false reassurance\nto the wanderer. All at once her groping hand, which never ceased to touch and\nsweep the rock before her, felt nothing. There was a stone lip, an edge:\nbeyond the edge, void. To the right the wall of the corridor plunged down\nsheer into the pit. To the left there was a ledge or curb, not much more than\na hand’s breadth wide.\n\n“There is a pit. Face the wall to the left, press against it, and go sideways.\nSlide your feet. Keep hold of the chain, Manan... Are you on the ledge? It\ngrows narrower. Don’t put your weight on your heels. So, I’m past the pit.\nReach me your hand. There...”\n\nThe tunnel ran in short zigzags with many side openings. From some of these as\nthey passed the sound of their footsteps echoed in a strange way, hollowly;\nand stranger than that, a very faint draft could be felt, sucking inward.\nThose corridors must end in pits like the one they had passed. Perhaps there\nlay, under this low part of the Labyrinth, a hollow place, a cavern so deep\nand so vast that the cavern of the Undertomb would be little in comparison, a\nhuge black inward emptiness.\n\nBut above that chasm, where they went in the dark tunnels, the corridors grew\nslowly narrower and lower, until even Arha must stoop. Was there no end to\nthis way?\n\nThe end came suddenly: a shut door. Going bent over, and a little faster than\nusual, Arha ran up against it, jarring her head and hands. She felt for the\nkeyhole, then for the small key on her belt-ring, never used, the silver key\nwith the haft shaped like a dragon. It fit, it turned. She opened the door of\nthe Great Treasure of the Tombs of Atuan. A dry, sour, stale air sighed\noutward through the dark.\n\n“Manan, you may not enter here. Wait outside the door.”\n\n“He, but not I?”\n\n“If you enter this room, Manan, you will not leave it. That is the law for all\nbut me. No mortal being but I has ever left this room alive. Will you go in?”\n\n“I will wait outside,” said the melancholy voice in the blackness. “Mistress,\nmistress, don’t shut the door-“ ,\n\nHis alarm so unnerved her that she left the door ajar. Indeed the place filled\nher with a dull dread, and she felt some mistrust of the prisoner, pinioned\nthough he was. Once inside, she struck her light. Her hands trembled. The\nlantern candle caught reluctantly; the air was close and dead. In the\nyellowish flicker that seemed bright after the long passages of night, the\ntreasure room loomed about them, full of moving shadows.\n\nThere were six great chests, all of stone, all thick with a fine gray dust\nlike the mold on bread; nothing else. The walls were rough, the roof low. The\nplace was cold, with a deep and airless cold that seemed to stop the blood in\nthe heart. There were no cobwebs, only the dust. Nothing lived here, nothing\nat all, not even the rare, small, white spiders of the Labyrinth. The dust was\nthick, thick, and every grain of it might be a day that had passed here where\nthere was no time or light: days, months, years, ages all gone to dust.\n\n“This is the place you sought,” Arha said, and her voice was steady. “This is\nthe Great Treasure of the Tombs. You have come to it. You cannot ever leave\nit.”\n\nHe said nothing, and his face was quiet, but there was in his eyes something\nthat moved her: a desolation, the look of one betrayed.\n\n“You said you wanted to stay alive. This is the only place I know where you\ncan stay alive. Kossil will kill you or make me kill you, Sparrowhawk. But\nhere she cannot reach.”\n\nStill he said nothing.\n\n“You could never have left the Tombs in any case, don’t you see? This is no\ndifferent. And at least you’ve come to... to the end of your journey. What you\nsought is here.”\n\nHe sat down on one of the great chests, looking spent. The trailing chain\nclanked harshly on the stone. He looked around at the gray walls and the\nshadows, then at her.\n\nShe looked away from him, at the stone chests. She had no wish at all to open\nthem. She did not care what marvels rotted in them.\n\n“You don’t have to wear that chain, in here.” She came to him and unlocked the\niron belt, and unbuckled Manan’s leather belt from his arms. “I must lock the\ndoor, but when I come I will trust you. You know that you cannot leave- that\nyou must not try? I am their vengeance, I do their will; but if I fail them\n-if you fail my trust- then they will avenge themselves. You must not try to\nleave the room, by hurting me or tricking me when I come. You must believe\nme.”\n\n“I will do as you say,” he said gently.\n\n“I’ll bring food and water when I can. There won’t be much. Water enough, but\nnot much food for a while; I’m getting hungry, do you see? But enough to stay\nalive on. I may not be able to come back for a day or two days, perhaps even\nlonger. I must get Kossil off the track. But I will come. I promise. Here’s\nthe flask. Hoard it, I can’t come back soon. But I will come back.”\n\nHe raised his face to her. His expression was strange. “Take care, Tenar,” he\nsaid.\n\n\n#  Names\n\nShe brought Manan back through the winding ways in the dark, and left him in\nthe dark of the Undertomb, to dig the grave that must be there as proof to\nKossil that the thief had indeed been punished. It was late, and she went\nstraight to the Small House to bed. In the night she woke suddenly; she\nremembered that she had left her cloak in the Painted Room. He would have\nnothing for warmth in that dank vault but his own short cloak, no bed but the\ndusty stone. A cold grave, a cold grave, she thought miserably, but she was\ntoo weary to wake up fully, and soon slipped back into sleep. She began to\ndream. She dreamt of the souls of the dead on the walls of the Painted Room,\nthe figures like great bedraggled birds with human hands and feet and faces,\nsquatting in the dust of the dark places. They could not fly. Clay was their\nfood and dust their drink. They were the souls of those not reborn, the\nancient peoples and the unbelievers, those whom the Nameless Ones devoured.\nThey squatted all around her in the shadows, and a faint creaking or cheeping\nsound came from them now and then. One of them came up quite close to her. She\nwas afraid at first and tried to draw away, but could not move. This one had\nthe face of a bird, not a human face; but its hair was golden, and it said in,\na woman’s voice, “Tenar,” tenderly, softly, “Tenar.”\n\nShe woke. Her mouth was stopped with clay. She lay in a stone tomb,\nunderground. Her arms and legs were bound with graveclothes and she could not\nmove or speak.\n\nHer despair grew so great that it burst her breast open and like a bird of\nfire shattered the stone and broke out into the light of daythe light of day,\nfaint in her windowless room.\n\nReally awake this time, she sat up, worn out by that night’s dreaming, her\nmind befogged. She got into her clothes, and went out to the cistern in the\nwalled courtyard of the Small House. She plunged her arms and face, her whole\nhead, into the icy water until her body jumped with cold and her blood raced.\nThen flinging back her dripping hair she stood erect and looked up into the\nmorning sky.\n\nIt was not long past sunrise, a fair winter’s day. The sky was yellowish, very\nclear. High up, so high he caught the sunlight and burned like a fleck of\ngold, a bird was circling, a hawk or desert eagle.\n\n“I am Tenar,” she said, not aloud, and she shook with cold, and terror, and\nexultation, there under the open, sunwashed sky. “I have my name back. I am\nTenar!”\n\nThe golden fleck veered westward towards the mountains, out of sight. Sunrise\ngilded the eaves of the Small House. Sheep bells clanked, down in the folds.\nThe smells of woodsmoke and buckwheat porridge from the kitchen chimneys\ndrifted on the fine, fresh wind.\n\n“I am so hungry... How did he know? How did he know my name?... Oh, I’ve got\nto go eat, I’m so hungry...”\n\nShe pulled up her hood and ran off to breakfast.\n\nFood, after three days of semi-fasting, made her feel solid, gave her ballast;\nshe didn’t feel so wild and lighthearted and frightened. She felt quite\ncapable of handling Kossil, after breakfast.\n\nShe came up beside the tall, stout figure on the way out of the dining hall of\nthe Big House, and said in a low voice, “I have done away with the robber...\nWhat a fine day it is!”\n\nThe cold gray eyes looked sidelong at her from the black hood.\n\n“I thought that the Priestess must abstain from eating for three days after a\nhuman sacrifice?”\n\nThis was true. Arha had forgotten it, and her face showed that she had\nforgotten.\n\n“He is not dead yet,” she said at last, trying to feign the indifferent tone\nthat had come so easily a moment ago. “He is buried alive. Under the Tombs. In\na coffin. There will be some air, the coffin isn’t sealed, it’s a wooden one.\nIt will go quite slowly; the dying. When I know he is dead then I’ll begin the\nfast.”\n\n“How will you know?”\n\nFlustered, she hesitated again. “I will know. The... My Masters will tell me.”\n\n“I see. Where is the grave?”\n\n“In the Undertomb. I told Manan to dig it beneath the Smooth Stone.” She must\nnot answer so quickly, in that foolish, appeasing tone; she must be on her\ndignity with Kossil.\n\n“Alive, in a wooden coffin. That’s a risky thing with a sorcerer, mistress.\nDid you make sure his mouth was stopped so he cannot say charms? Are his hands\nbound? They can weave spells with the motion of a finger, even when their\ntongues are cut out.”\n\n“There is nothing to his sorcery, it is mere tricking,” the girl said, raising\nher voice. “He is buried, and my Masters are waiting for his soul. And the\nrest does not concern you, priestess!”\n\nThis time she had gone too far. Others could hear; Penthe and a couple of\nother girls, Duby, and the priestess Mebbeth, all were in hearing distance.\nThe girls were all ears, and Kossil was aware of it.\n\n“All that happens here is my concern, mistress. All that happens in his realm\nis the concern of the Godking, the Man Immortal, whose servant I am. Even into\nthe places underground and into the hearts of men does he search and look, and\nnone shall forbid him entrance!”\n\n“I shall. Into the Tombs no one comes if the Nameless Ones forbid it. They\nwere before your Godking and they will be after him. Speak softly of them,\npriestess. Do not call their vengeance on you. They will come into your\ndreams, they will enter the dark places in your mind, and you will go mad.”\n\nThe girl’s eyes were blazing. Kossil’s face was hidden, drawn back into the\nblack cowl. Penthe and the others watched, terrified and enthralled.\n\n“They are old,” Kossil’s voice said, not loud, a whistling thread of sound out\nof the depths of the cowl. “They are old. Their worship is forgotten, save in\nthis one place. Their power is gone. They are only shadows. They have no power\nany more. Do not try to frighten me, Eaten One. You are the First Priestess;\ndoes that not mean also that you are the last?... You cannot trick me. I see\ninto your heart. The darkness hides nothing from me. Take care, Arha!”\n\nShe turned and went on, with her massive, deliberate steps, crushing the\nfrost-starred weeds under her heavy, sandaled feet, going to the white-\npillared house of the Godking.\n\nThe girl stood, slight and dark, as if frozen to earth, in the front courtyard\nof the Big House. Nobody moved, nothing moved, only Kossil, in all the vast\nlandscape of court and temple, hill and desert plain and mountain.\n\n“May the Dark Ones eat your soul, Kossil!” she shouted in a voice like a\nhawk’s scream, and lifting her arm with the hand stretched out stiff, she\nbrought the curse down on the priestess’ heavy back, even as she set foot on\nthe steps of her temple. Kossil staggered, but did not stop or turn. She went\non, and entered the Godking’s door.\n\nArha spent that day sitting on the lowest step of the Empty Throne. She dared\nnot go into the Labyrinth; she would not go among the other priestesses. A\nheaviness filled her, and held her there hour after hour in the cold dusk of\nthe great hall. She stared at the pairs of thick pale columns going off into\nthe gloom at the distant end of the hall, and at the shafts of daylight that\nslanted in from holes in the roof, and at the thick-curling smoke from the\nbronze tripod of charcoal near the Throne. She made patterns with the little\nbones of mice on the marble stair, her head bowed, her mind active and yet as\nif stupefied. Who am I? she asked herself, and got no answer.\n\nManan came shuffling down the hall between the double rows of columns, when\nthe light had long since ceased to shaft the hall’s darkness, and the cold had\ngrown intense. Manan’s doughy face was very sad. He stood at a distance from\nher, his big hands hanging; a torn hem of his rusty cloak dangled by his heel.\n\n“Little mistress.”\n\n“What is it, Manan?” She looked at him with dull affection.\n\n“Little one, let me do what you said... what you said was done. He must die,\nlittle one. He has bewitched you. She will have revenge. She is old and cruel,\nand you are too young. You have not strength enough.”\n\n“She can’t hurt me.”\n\n“If she killed you, even in the sight of all, in the open, there is none in\nall the Empire who would dare punish her. She is the High Priestess of the\nGodking, and the Godking rules. But she won’t kill you in the open. She will\ndo it by stealth, by poison, in the night.”\n\n“Then I will be born again.”\n\nManan twisted his big hands together. “Perhaps she will not kill you,” he\nwhispered.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“She could lock you into a room in the... down there... As you have done with\nhim. And you would be alive for years and years, maybe. For years... And no\nnew Priestess would be born, for you wouldn’t be dead. Yet there would be no\nPriestess of the Tombs, and the dances of the dark of the moon would not be\ndanced, and the sacrifices would not be made, and the blood not poured out,\nand the worship of the Dark Ones could be forgotten, forever. She and her Lord\nwould like it to be so.”\n\n“_They_ would set me free, Manan.”\n\n“Not while they are wrathful at you, little mistress,” Manan whispered.\n\n“Wrathful?”\n\n“Because of him... The sacrilege not paid for. Oh little one, little one! They\ndo not forgive!”\n\nShe sat in the dust of the lowest step, her head bowed. She looked at a tiny\nthing that she held on her palm, the minute skull of a mouse. The owls in the\nrafters over the Throne stirred a little; it was darkening towards night.\n\n“Do not go down into the Labyrinth tonight,” Manan said very low. “Go to your\nhouse, and sleep. In the morning go to Kossil, and tell her that you lift the\ncurse from her. And that will be all. You need not worry. I will show her\nproof.”\n\n“Proof?”\n\n“That the sorcerer is dead.”\n\nShe sat still. Slowly she closed her hand, and the fragile skull cracked and\ncollapsed. When she opened her hand it held nothing but splinters of bone and\ndust.\n\n“No,” she said. She brushed the dust from her palm.\n\n“He must die. He has put a spell on you. You are lost, Arha!”\n\n“He has not put any spell on me. You’re old and cowardly, Manan; you’re\nfrightened by old women. How do you think you’d come to him and kill him and\nget your ‘proof’? Do you know the way clear to the Great Treasure, that you\nfollowed in the dark last night? Can you count the turnings and come to the\nsteps, and then the pit, and then the door? Can you unlock that door?... Oh,\npoor old Manan, your wits are all thick. She has frightened you. You go down\nto the Small House now, and sleep, and forget all these things. Don’t worry me\nforever with talk of death... I’ll come later. Go on, go on, old fool, old\nlump.” She had risen, and gently pushed Manan’s broad chest, patting him and\npushing him to go. “Good night, good night!”\n\nHe turned, heavy with reluctance and foreboding, but obedient, and trudged\ndown the long hall under the columns and the ruined roof. She watched him go.\n\nWhen he had been gone some while she turned and went around the dais of the\nThrone, and vanished into the dark behind it.\n\n\n#  The Ring of Erreth-Akbe\n\nIn the Great Treasury of the Tombs of Atuan, time did not pass. No light; no\nlife; no least stir of spider in the dust or worm in the cold earth. Rock, and\ndark, and time not passing.\n\nOn the stone lid of a great chest the thief from the Inner Lands lay stretched\non his back like the carven figure on a tomb. The dust disturbed by his\nmovements had settled on his clothes. He did not move.\n\nThe lock of the door rattled. The door opened. Light broke the dead black and\na fresher draft stirred the dead air. The man lay inert.\n\nArha closed the door and locked it from within, set her lantern on a chest,\nand slowly approached the motionless figure. She moved timorously, and her\neyes were wide, the pupils still fully dilated from her long journey through\nthe dark.\n\n“Sparrowhawk!”\n\nShe touched his shoulder, and spoke his name again, and yet again.\n\nHe stirred then, and moaned. At last he sat up, face drawn and eyes blank. He\nlooked at her unrecognizing.\n\n“It’s I, Arha- Tenar. I brought you water. Here, drink.”\n\nHe fumbled for the flask as if his hands were numb, and drank, but not deeply.\n\n“How long has it been?” he asked, speaking with difficulty.\n\n“Two days have passed since you came to this room. This is the third night. I\ncouldn’t come earlier. I had to steal the food -here it is-“ She got out one\nof the flat gray loaves from the bag she had brought, but he shook his head.\n\n“I’m not hungry. This... this is a deathly place.” He put his head in his\nhands and sat unmoving.\n\n“Are you cold? I brought the cloak from the Painted Room.”\n\nHe did not answer.\n\nShe put the cloak down and stood gazing at him. She was trembling a little,\nand her eyes were still black and wide.\n\nAll at once she sank down on her knees, bowed over, and began to cry, with\ndeep sobs that wrenched her body, but brought no tears.\n\nHe got down stiffly from the chest, and bent over her. “Tenar-“\n\n“I am not Tenar. I am not Arha. The gods are dead, the gods are dead.”\n\nHe laid his hands on her head, pushing back the hood. He began to speak. His\nvoice was soft, and the words were in no tongue she had ever heard. The sound\nof them came into her heart like rain falling. She grew still to listen.\n\nWhen she was quiet he lifted her, and set her like a child on the great chest\nwhere he had lain. He put his hand on hers.\n\n“Why did you weep, Tenar?”\n\n“I’ll tell you. It doesn’t matter what I tell you. You can’t do anything. You\ncan’t help. You’re dying too, aren’t you? So it doesn’t matter. Nothing\nmatters. Kossil, the Priestess of the Godking, she was always cruel, she kept\ntrying to make me kill you. The way I killed those others. And I would not.\nWhat right has she? And she defied the Nameless Ones and mocked them, and I\nset a curse upon her. And since then I’ve been afraid of her, because it’s\ntrue what Manan said, she doesn’t believe in the gods. She wants them to be\nforgotten, and she’d kill me while I slept. So I didn’t sleep. I didn’t go\nback to the Small House. I stayed in the Hall all last night, in one of the\nlofts, where the dancing dresses are. Before it was light I went down to the\nBig House and stole some food from the kitchen, and then I came back to the\nHall and stayed there all day. I was trying to find out what I should do. And\ntonight... tonight I was so tired, I thought I could go to a holy place and go\nto sleep, she might be afraid to come there. So I came down to the Undertomb.\nThat great cave where I first saw you. And... and she was there. She must have\ncome in by the red rock door. She was there with a lantern. Scratching in the\ngrave that Manan dug, to see if there was a corpse in it. Like a rat in a\ngraveyard, a great fat black rat, digging. And the light burning in the Holy\nPlace, the dark place. And the Nameless Ones did nothing. They didn’t kill her\nor drive her mad. They are old, as she said. They are dead. They are all gone.\nI am not a priestess any more.”\n\nThe man stood listening, his band still on hers, his head a little bent. Some\nvigor had come back into his face and stance, though the scars on his cheek\nshowed livid gray, and there was dust yet on his clothes and hair.\n\n“I went past her, through the Undertomb. Her candle made more shadows than\nlight, and she didn’t hear me. I wanted to go into the Labyrinth to get away\nfrom her. But when I was in it I kept thinking that I heard her following me.\nAll through the corridors I kept hearing somebody behind me. And I didn’t know\nwhere to go. I thought I would be safe here, I thought my Masters would\nprotect me and defend me. But they don’t, they are gone, they are dead...”\n\n“It was for them you wept -for their death? But they are here, Tenar, here!”\n\n“How should you know?” she said listlessly.\n\n“Because every instant since I set foot in the cavern under the Tombstones, I\nhave striven to keep them still, to keep them unaware. All my skills have gone\nto that, I have spent my strength on it. I have filled these tunnels with an\nendless net of spells, spells of sleep, of stillness, of concealment, and yet\nstill they are aware of me, half aware; half sleeping, half awake. And even so\nI am all but worn out, striving against them. This is a most terrible place.\nOne man alone has no hope, here. I was dying of thirst when you gave me water,\nyet it was not the water alone that saved me. It was the strength of the hands\nthat gave it.” As he said that, he turned her hand palm upward in his own for\na moment, gazing at it; then he turned away, walked a few steps about the\nroom, and stopped again before her. She said nothing.\n\n“Did you truly think them dead? You know better in your heart. They do not\ndie. They are dark and undying, and they hate the light: the brief, bright\nlight of our mortality. They are immortal, but they are not gods. They never\nwere. They are not worth the worship of any human soul.”\n\nShe listened, her eyes heavy, her gaze fixed on the flickering lantern.\n\n“What have they ever given you, Tenar?”\n\n“Nothing,” she whispered.\n\n“They have nothing to give. They have no power of making. All their power is\nto darken and destroy. They cannot leave this place; they are this place; and\nit should be left to them. They should not be denied nor forgotten, but\nneither should they be worshiped. The Earth is beautiful, and bright, and\nkindly, but that is not all. The Earth is also terrible, and dark, and cruel.\nThe rabbit shrieks dying in the green meadows. The mountains clench their\ngreat hands full of hidden fire. There are sharks in the sea, and there is\ncruelty in men’s eyes. And where men worship these things and abase themselves\nbefore them, there evil breeds; there places are made in the world where\ndarkness gathers, places given over wholly to the Ones whom we call Nameless,\nthe ancient and holy Powers of the Earth before the Light, the powers of the\ndark, of ruin, of madness... I think they drove your priestess Kossil mad a\nlong time ago; I think she has prowled these caverns as she prowls the\nlabyrinth of her own self, and now she cannot see the daylight any more. She\ntells you that the Nameless Ones are dead; only a lost soul, lost to truth,\ncould believe that. They exist. But they are not your Masters. They never\nwere. You are free, Tenar. You were taught to be a slave, but you have broken\nfree.”\n\nShe listened, though her expression did not change. He said no more. They were\nsilent; but it was not the silence that had been in that room before she\nentered. There was the breathing of two of them now, and the movement of life\nin their veins, and the burning of the candle in its lantern of tin, a tiny,\nlively sound.\n\n“How is it that you know my name?”\n\nHe walked up and down the room, stirring up the fine dust, stretching his arms\nand shoulders in an effort to shake off the numbing chill.\n\n“Knowing names is my job. My art. To weave the magic of a thing, you see, one\nmust find its true name out. In my lands we keep our true names hidden all our\nlives long, from all but those whom we trust utterly; for there is great\npower, and great peril, in a name. Once, at the beginning of time, when Segoy\nraised the isles of Earthsea from the ocean deeps, all things bore their own\ntrue names. And all doing of magic, all wizardry, hangs still upon the\nknowledge -the relearning, the remembering- of that true and ancient language\nof the Making. There are spells to learn, of course, ways to use the words;\nand one must know the consequences, too. But what a wizard spends his life at\nis finding out the names of things, and finding out how to find out the names\nof things.”\n\n“How did you find out mine?”\n\nHe looked at her a moment, a deep clear glance across the shadows between\nthem; he hesitated a moment. “I cannot tell you that. You are like a lantern\nswathed and covered, hidden away in a dark place. Yet the light shines; they\ncould not put out the light. They could not hide you. As I know the light, as\nI know you, I know your name, Tenar. That is my gift, my power. I cannot tell\nyou more. But tell me this: what will you do now?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Kossil has found an empty grave, by now. What will she do?”\n\n“I don’t know. If I go back up, she can have me killed. It is death for a High\nPriestess to lie. She could have me sacrificed on the steps of the Throne if\nshe wanted. And Manan would have to really cut off my head this time, instead\nof just lifting the sword and waiting for the Dark figure to stop it. But this\ntime it wouldn’t stop. It would come down and cut off my head.”\n\nHer voice was dull and slow. He frowned. “If we stay here long,” he said, “you\nare going to go mad, Tenar. The anger of the Nameless Ones is heavy on your\nmind. And on mine. It’s better now that you’re here, much better. But it was a\nlong time before you came, and I’ve used up most of my strength. No one can\nwithstand the Dark Ones long alone. They are very strong.” He stopped; his\nvoice had sunk low, and he seemed to have lost the thread of his speech. He\nrubbed his hands over his forehead, and presently went to drink again from the\nflask. He broke off a hunch of bread and sat down on the chest opposite to eat\nit.\n\nWhat he said was true; she felt a weight, a pressure on her mind, that seemed\nto darken and confuse all thought and feeling. Yet she was not terrified, as\nshe had been coming through the corridors alone. Only the utter silence\noutside the room seemed terrible. Why was that? She had never feared the\nsilence of the underearth before. But never before had she disobeyed the\nNameless Ones, never had she set herself against them.\n\nShe gave a little whimpering laugh at last. “Here we sit on the greatest\ntreasure of the Empire,” she said. “The God-king would give all his wives to\nhave one chest of it. And we haven’t even opened a lid to look.”\n\n“I did,” said the Sparrowhawk, chewing.\n\n“In the dark?”\n\n“I made a little light. The werelight. It was hard to do, here. Even with my\nstaff it would have been hard, and without it, it was like trying to light a\nfire with wet wood in the rain. But it came at last. And I found what I was\nafter.”\n\nShe raised her face slowly to look at him. “The ring?”\n\n“The half-ring. You have the other half.”\n\n“I have it? The other half was lost-“\n\n“And found. I wore it on a chain around my neck. You took it off, and asked me\nif I couldn’t afford a better talisman. The only talisman better than half the\nRing of Erreth-Akbe would be the whole. But then, as they say, half a loaf’s\nbetter than none. So you now have my half, and I have yours.” He smiled at her\nacross the shadows of the tomb.\n\n“You said, when I took it, that I didn’t know what to do with it.”\n\n“That was true.”\n\n“And you do know?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Tell me. Tell me what it is, the ring, and how you came upon the lost half,\nand how you came here, and why. All this I must know, then maybe I will see\nwhat to do.”\n\n“Maybe you will. Very well. What is it, the Ring of Erreth-Akbe? Well, you can\nsee that it’s not precious looking, and it’s not even a ring. It’s too big. An\narmring, perhaps, yet it seems too small for that. No man knows who it was\nmade for. Elfarran the Fair wore it once, before the Isle of Solea was lost\nbeneath the sea; and it was old when she wore it. And at last it came into the\nhands of Erreth-Akbe... The metal is hard silver, pierced with nine holes.\nThere’s a design like waves scratched on the outside, and nine Runes of Power\non the inside. The half you have bears four runes and a bit of another; and\nmine likewise. The break came right across that one symbol, and destroyed it.\nIt is what’s been called, since then, the Lost Rune. The other eight are known\nto Mages: Pirr that protects from madness and from wind and fire, Ges that\ngives endurance, and so on. But the broken rune was the one that bound the\nlands. It was the Bond-Rune, the sign of dominion, the sign of peace. No king\ncould rule well if he did not rule beneath that sign. No one knows how it was\nwritten. Since it was lost there have been no great kings in Havnor. There\nhave been princes and tyrants, and wars and quarreling among all the lands of\nEarthsea.\n\n“So the wise lords and Mages of the Archipelago wanted the Ring of Erreth-\nAkbe, that they might restore the lost rune. But at last they gave up sending\nmen out to seek it, since none could take the one half from the Tombs of\nAtuan, and the other half, which Erreth-Akbe gave to a Kargish king, was lost\nlong since. They said there was no use in the search. That was many hundred\nyears ago.\n\n“Now I come into it thus. When I was a little older than you are now, I was on\na... chase, a kind of hunt across the sea. That which I hunted tricked me, so\nthat I was cast up on a desert isle, not far off the coasts of Karego-At and\nAtuan, south and west of here. It was a little islet, not much more than a\nsandbar, with long grassy dunes down the middle, and a spring of salty water,\nand nothing else.\n\n“Yet two people lived there. An old man and woman; brother and sister, I\nthink. They were terrified of me. They had not seen any other human face for-\nhow long? Years, tens of years. But I was in need, and they were kind to me.\nThey had a but of driftwood, and a fire. The old woman gave me food, mussels\nshe pulled from the rocks at low tide, dried meat of seabirds they killed by\nthrowing stones. She was afraid of me, but she gave me food. Then when I did\nnothing to frighten her, she came to trust me, and she showed me her treasure.\nShe had a treasure, too... It was a little dress. All of silk stuff, with\npearls. A little child’s dress, a princess’ dress. She was wearing uncured\nsealskin.\n\n“We couldn’t talk. I didn’t know the Kargish tongue then, and they knew no\nlanguage of the Archipelago, and little enough of their own. They must have\nbeen brought there as young children, and left to die. I don’t know why, and\ndoubt that they knew. They knew nothing but the island, the wind, and the sea.\nBut when I left she gave me a present. She gave me the lost half of the Ring\nof Erreth-Akbe.”\n\nHe paused for a while.\n\n“I didn’t know it for what it was, no more than she did. The greatest gift of\nthis age of the world, and it was given by a poor old foolish woman in\nsealskins to a silly lout who stuffed it into his pocket and said ‘Thanks!’\nand sailed off... Well, so I went on, and did what I had to do. And then other\nthings came up, and I went to the Dragons’ Run, westward, and so on. But all\nthe time I kept the thing with me, because I felt a gratitude towards that old\nwoman who had given me the only present she had to give. I put a chain through\none of the holes pierced in it, and wore it, and never thought about it. And\nthen one day on Selidor, the Farthest Isle, the land where Erreth-Akbe died in\nhis battle with the dragon Orm-on Selidor I spoke with a dragon, one of that\nlineage of Orm. He told me what I wore upon my breast.\n\n“He thought it very funny that I hadn’t known. Dragons think we are amusing.\nBut they remember Erreth-Akbe; him they speak of as if he were a dragon, not a\nman.\n\n“When I came back to the Inmost Isles, I went at last to Havnor. I was born on\nGont, which lies not far west of your Kargish lands, and I had wandered a good\ndeal since, but I had never been to Havnor. It was time to go there. I saw the\nwhite towers, and spoke with the great men, the merchants and the princes and\nthe lords of the ancient domains. I told them what I had. I told them that if\nthey liked, I would go seek the rest of the ring in the Tombs of Atuan, in\norder to find the Lost Rune, the key to peace. For we need peace sorely in the\nworld. They were full of praise; and one of them even gave me money to\nprovision my boat. So I learned your tongue, and came to Atuan.”\n\nHe fell silent, gazing before him into the shadows.\n\n“Didn’t the people in our towns know you for a Westerner, by your skin, by\nyour speech?”\n\n“Oh, it’s easy to fool people,” he said rather absently, “if you know the\ntricks. You make some illusion-changes, and nobody but another Mage will see\nthrough them. And you have no wizards or Mages here in the Kargish lands.\nThat’s a queer thing. You banished all your wizards long ago, and forbade the\npractice of the Art Magic; and now you scarcely believe in it.”\n\n“I was taught to disbelieve in it. It is contrary to the teachings of the\nPriest Kings. But I know that only sorcery could have got you to the Tombs,\nand in at the door of red rock.”\n\n“Not only sorcery, but good advice also. We use writing more than you, I\nthink. Do you know how to read?”\n\n“No. It is one of the black arts.”\n\nHe nodded. “But a useful one,” he said. “An ancient unsuccessful thief left\ncertain descriptions of the Tombs of Atuan, and instructions for entering, if\none were able to use one of the Great Spells of Opening. All this was written\ndown in a book in the treasury of a prince of Havnor. He let me read it. So I\ngot as far as the great cavern-“\n\n“The Undertomb.”\n\n“The thief who wrote the way to enter thought that the treasure was there, in\nthe Undertomb. So I looked there, but I had the feeling that it must be better\nhidden, farther on in the maze. I knew the entrance to the Labyrinth, and when\nI saw you, I went to it, thinking to hide in the maze and search it. That was\na mistake, of course. The Nameless Ones had hold of me already, bewildering my\nmind. And since then I have grown only weaker and stupider. One must not\nsubmit to them, one must resist, keep one’s spirit always strong and certain.\nI learned that a long time ago. But it’s hard to do, here, where they are so\nstrong. They are not gods, Tenar. But they are stronger than any man.”\n\nThey were both silent for a long time.\n\n“What else did you find in the treasure chests?” she asked dully.\n\n“Rubbish. Gold, jewels, crowns, swords. Nothing to which any man alive has any\nclaim... Tell me this, Tenar. How were you chosen to be the Priestess of the\nTombs?”\n\n“When the First Priestess dies they go looking all through Atuan for a girl-\nbaby born on the night the Priestess died. And they always find one. Because\nit is the Priestess reborn. When the child is five they bring it here to the\nPlace. And when it is six it is given to the Dark Ones and its soul is eaten\nby them. And so it belongs to them, and has belonged to them since the\nbeginning days. And it has no name.”\n\n“Do you believe that?”\n\n“I have always believed it.”\n\n“Do you believe it now?”\n\nShe said nothing.\n\nAgain the shadowy silence fell between them. After a long time she said, “Tell\nme... tell me about the dragons in the West.”\n\n“Tenar, what will you do? We can’t sit here telling each other tales until the\ncandle burns out, and the darkness comes again.”\n\n“I don’t know what to do. I am afraid.” She sat erect on the stone chest, her\nhands clenched one in the other, and spoke loudly, like one in pain. She said,\n“I am afraid of the dark.”\n\nHe answered softly. “You must make a choice. Either you must leave me, lock\nthe door, go up to your altars and give me to your Masters; then go to the\nPriestess Kossil and make your peace with her -and that is the end of the\nstory- or, you must unlock the door, and go out of it, with me. Leave the\nTombs, leave Atuan, and come with me oversea. And that is the beginning of the\nstory. You must be Arha, or you must be Tenar. You cannot be both.”\n\nThe deep voice was gentle and certain. She looked through the shadows into his\nface, which was hard and scarred, but had in it no cruelty, no deceit.\n\n“If I leave the service of the Dark Ones, they will kill me. If I leave this\nplace I will die.”\n\n“You will not die. Arha will die.”\n\n“I cannot...”\n\n“To be reborn one must die, Tenar. It is not so hard as it looks from the\nother side.”\n\n“They would not let us get out. Ever.”\n\n“Perhaps not. Yet it’s worth trying. You have knowledge, and I have skill, and\nbetween us we have...” He paused.\n\n“We have the Ring of Erreth-Akbe.”\n\n“Yes, that. But I thought also of another thing between us. Call it trust...\nThat is one of its names. It is a very great thing. Though each of us alone is\nweak, having that we are strong, stronger than the Powers of the Dark.” His\neyes were clear and bright in his scarred face. “Listen, Tenar!” he said. “I\ncame here a thief, an enemy, armed against you; and you showed me mercy, and\ntrusted me. And I have trusted you from the first time I saw your face, for\none moment in the cave beneath the Tombs, beautiful in darkness. You have\nproved your trust in me. I have made no return. I will give you what I have to\ngive. My true name is Ged. And this is yours to keep.” He had risen, and he\nheld out to her a semicircle of pierced and carven silver. “Let the ring be\nrejoined,” he said.\n\nShe took it from his hand. She slipped from her neck the silver chain on which\nthe other half was strung, and took it off the chain. She laid the two pieces\nin her palm so that the broken edges met, and it looked whole.\n\nShe did not raise her face.\n\n“I will come with you,” she said.\n\n\n#  The Anger of the Dark\n\nWhen she said that, the man named Ged put his hand over hers that held the\nbroken talisman. She looked up startled, and saw him flushed with life and\ntriumph, smiling. She was dismayed and frightened of him “You have set us both\nfree,” he said. “Alone, no one wins freedom. Come, let’s waste no time while\nwe still have time! Hold it out again, for a little.” She had closed her\nfingers over the pieces of silver, but at his request she held them out again\non her hand, the broken edges touching.\n\nHe did not take them, but put his fingers on them. He said a couple of words,\nand sweat suddenly sprang out on his face. She felt a queer little tremor on\nthe palm of her hand, as if a small animal sleeping there had moved. Ged\nsighed; his tense stance relaxed, and he wiped his forehead.\n\n“There,” he said, and picking up the Ring of Erreth-Akbe he slid it over the\nfingers of her right hand, narrowly over the breadth of the hand, and up onto\nthe wrist. “There!” and he regarded it with satisfaction. “It fits. It must be\na woman’s arm-ring, or a child’s.”\n\n“Will it hold?’ she murmured, nervously, feeling the strip of silver slip cold\nand delicate on her thin arm.\n\n“It will. I couldn’t put a mere mending charm on the Ring of Erreth-Akbe, like\na village witch mending a kettle. I had to use a Patterning, and make it\nwhole. It is whole now as if it had never been broken. Tenar, we must be gone.\nI’ll bring the bag and flask. Wear your cloak. Is there anything more?”\n\nAs she fumbled at the door, unlocking it, he said, “I wish I had my staff,”\nand she replied, still whispering, “It’s just outside the door. I brought it.”\n\n“Why did you bring it?” he asked curiously.\n\n“I thought of... taking you to the door. Letting you go “That was a choice you\ndidn’t have. You could keep me a slave, and be a slave; or set me free, and\ncome free with me. Come, little one, take courage, turn the key.”\n\nShe turned the dragon-hafted key and opened the door on the low, black\ncorridor. She went out of the Treasury of the Tombs with the ring of Erreth-\nAkbe on her arm, and the man followed her.\n\nThere was a low vibration, not quite a noise, in the rock of the walls and\nfloor and vaulting. It was like distant thunder, like something huge falling a\ngreat way off.\n\nThe hair on her head rose up, and without stopping to reason she blew out the\ncandle in the tin lantern. She heard the man move behind her; his quiet voice\nsaid, so close that his breath stirred her hair, “Leave the lantern. I can\nmake light if need be. What time is it, outside?”\n\n“Long past midnight when I came here.”\n\n“We must go forward then.”\n\nBut he did not move. She realized that she must lead him. Only she knew the\nway out of the Labyrinth, and he waited to follow her. She set out, stooping\nbecause the tunnel here was so low, but keeping a pretty good pace. From\nunseen cross-passages came a cold breath and a sharp, dank odor, the lifeless\nsmell of the huge hollowness beneath them. When the passage grew a little\nhigher and she could stand upright, she went slower, counting her steps as\nthey approached the pit. Lightfooted, aware of all her movements, he followed\na short way behind her. The instant she stopped, he stopped.\n\n“Here’s the pit,” she whispered. “I can’t find the ledge. No, here. Be\ncareful, I think the stones are coming loose... No, no, wait -it’s loose-“ She\nsidled back to safety as the stones teetered under her feet. The man caught\nher arm and held her. Her heart pounded. “The ledge isn’t safe, the stones are\ncoming loose.”\n\n“I’ll make a little light, and look at them. Maybe I can mend them with the\nright word. It’s all right, little one.”\n\nShe thought how strange it was that he called her what Manan had always called\nher. And as he kindled a faint glow on the end of his staff, like the glow on\nrotting wood or a star behind fog, and stepped out onto the narrow way beside\nthe black abyss, she saw the bulk looming in the farther dark beyond him, and\nknew it for Manan. But her voice was caught in her throat as in a noose, and\nshe could not cry out.\n\nAs Manan reached out to push him off his shaky perch into the pit beside him,\nGed looked up, saw him, and with a shout of surprise or rage struck out at him\nwith the staff. At the shout the light blazed up white and intolerable,\nstraight in the eunuch’s face. Manan flung up one of his big hands to shield\nhis eyes, lunged desperately to catch hold of Ged, and missed, and fell.\n\nHe made no cry as he fell. No sound came up out of the black pit, no sound of\nhis body hitting the bottom, no sound of his death, none at all. Clinging\nperilously to the ledge, kneeling frozen at the lip, Ged and Tenar did not\nmove; listened; heard nothing.\n\nThe light was gray wisp, barely visible.\n\n“Come!” Ged said, holding out his hand; she took it, and in three bold steps\nhe brought her across. He quenched the light. She went ahead of him again to\nlead the way. She was quite numb and did not think of anything. Only after\nsome time she thought, Is it right or left?\n\nShe stopped.\n\nHalted a few steps behind her, he said softly, “What is it?”\n\n“I am lost. Make the light.”\n\n“Lost?”\n\n“I have... I have lost count of the turnings.”\n\n“I kept count,” he said, coming a little closer. “A left turn after the pit;\nthen a right, and a right again.”\n\n“Then the next will be right again,” she said automatically, but she did not\nmove. “Make the light.”\n\n“The light won’t show us the way, Tenar.”\n\n“Nothing will. It is lost. We are lost.”\n\nThe dead silence closed in upon her whisper, ate it.\n\nShe felt the movement and warmth of the other, close to her in the cold dark.\nHe sought her hand and took it. “Go on, Tenar. The next turn to the right.”\n\n“Make a light,” she pleaded. “The tunnels twist so...”\n\n“I cannot. I have no strength to spare. Tenar, they are- They know that we\nleft the Treasury. They know that we’re past the pit. They are seeking us,\nseeking our will, our spirit. To quench it, to devour it. I must keep that\nalight. All my strength is going into that. I must withstand them; with you.\nWith your help. We must go on.”\n\n“There is no way out,” she said, but she took one step forward. Then she took\nanother, hesitant as if beneath each step the black hollow void gaped open,\nthe emptiness under the earth. The warm, hard grip of his hand was on her\nhand. They went forward.\n\nAfter what seemed a long time they came to the flight of steps. It had not\nseemed so steep before, the steps hardly more than slimy notches in the rock.\nBut they climbed it, and then went on a little more rapidly, for she knew that\nthe curving passage went a long way without side turnings after the steps. Her\nfingers, trailing the left-hand wall for guidance, crossed a gap, an opening\nto the left. “Here,” she murmured; but he seemed to hold back, as if something\nin her movements made him doubtful.\n\n“No,” she muttered in confusion, “not this, it’s the next turn to the left. I\ndon’t know. I can’t do it. There’s no way out.”\n\n“We are going to the Painted Room,” the quiet voice said in the darkness. “How\nshould we go there?”\n\n“The left turn after this.”\n\nShe led on. They made the long circuit, past two false leads, to the passage\nthat branched rightwards towards the Painted Room.\n\n“Straight on,” she whispered, and now the long unraveling of the darkness went\nbetter, for she knew these passages towards the iron door and had counted\ntheir turns a hundred times; the strange weight that lay upon her mind could\nnot confuse her about them, if she did not try to think. But all the time they\nwere getting nearer and nearer to that which weighed upon her and pressed\nagainst her; and her legs were so tired and heavy that she whimpered once or\ntwice with the labor of making them move. And beside her the man would breathe\ndeep, and hold the breath, again and again, like one making a mighty effort\nwith all the strength of his body. Sometimes his voice broke out, hushed and\nsharp, in a word or fragment of a word. So they came at last to the iron door;\nand in sudden terror she put out her hand.\n\nThe door was open.\n\n“Quick!” she said, and pulled her companion through. Then, on the further\nside, she halted.\n\n“Why was it open?” she said.\n\n“Because your Masters need your hands to shut it for them.”\n\n“We are coming to...” Her voice failed her.\n\n“To the center of the darkness. I know. Yet we’re out of the Labyrinth. What\nways out of the Undertomb are there?”\n\n“Only one. The door you entered doesn’t open from within. The way goes through\nthe cavern and up passages to a trapdoor in a room behind the Throne. In the\nHall of the Throne.”\n\n“Then we must go that way.”\n\n“But she is there,” the girl whispered. “There in the Undertomb. In the\ncavern. Digging in the empty grave. I cannot pass her, oh, I cannot pass her\nagain!”\n\n“She will have gone by now.”\n\n“I cannot go there.”\n\n“Tenar, I hold the roof up over our heads, this moment. I keep the walls from\nclosing in upon us. I keep the ground from opening beneath our feet. I have\ndone this since we passed the pit where their servant waited. If I can hold\noff the earthquake, do you fear to meet one human soul with me? Trust me, as I\nhave trusted you! Come with me now.”\n\nThey went forward.\n\nThe endless tunnel opened out. The sense of a greater air met them, an\nenlarging of the dark. They had entered the great cave beneath the Tombstones.\n\nThey started to circle it, keeping to the right-hand wall. Tenar had gone only\na few steps when she paused. “What is it?” she murmured, her voice barely\npassing her lips. There was a noise in the dead, vast, black bubble of air: a\ntremor or shaking, a sound heard by the blood and felt in the bones. The time-\ncarven walls beneath her fingers thrummed, thrummed.\n\n“Go forward,” the man’s voice said, dry and strained. “Hurry, Tenar.”\n\nAs she stumbled forward she cried out in her mind, which was as dark, as\nshaken as the subterranean vault, “Forgive me. O my Masters, O unnamed ones,\nmost ancient ones, forgive me, forgive me!”\n\nThere was no answer. There had never been an answer.\n\nThey came to the passage beneath the Hall, climbed the stairs, came to the\nlast steps up and the trapdoor at their head. It was shut, as she always left\nit. She pressed the spring that opened it. It did not open.\n\n“It is broken,” she said. “It is locked.”\n\nHe came up past her and put his back against the trap. It did not move.\n\n“It’s not locked, but held down by something heavy.”\n\n“Can you open it?”\n\n“Perhaps. I think she’ll be waiting there. Has she men with her?”\n\n“Duby and Uahto, maybe other wardens -men cannot come there-“\n\n“I can’t make a spell of opening, and hold off the people waiting up there,\nand withstand the will of the darkness, all at one time,” said his steady\nvoice, considering. “We must try the other door then, the door in the rocks,\nby which I came in. She knows that it can’t be opened from within?”\n\n“She knows. She let me try it once.”\n\n“Then she may discount it. Come. Come, Tenar!”\n\nShe had sunk down on the stone steps, which hummed and shivered as if a great\nbowstring were being plucked in the depths beneath them.\n\n“What is it- the shaking?”\n\n“Come,” he said, so steady and certain that she obeyed, and crept back down\nthe passages and stairs, back to the dreadful cavern.\n\nAt the entrance so great a weight of blind and dire hatred came pressing down\nupon her, like the weight of the earth itself, that she cowered and without\nknowing it cried out aloud, “They are here! They are here!”\n\n“Then let them know that we are here,” the man said, and from his staff and\nhands leapt forth a white radiance that broke as a seawave breaks in sunlight,\nagainst the thousand diamonds of the roof and walls: a glory of light, through\nwhich the two fled, straight across the great cavern, their shadows racing\nfrom them into the white traceries and the glittering crevices and the empty,\nopen grave. To the low doorway they ran, down the tunnel, stooping over, she\nfirst, he following. There in the tunnel the rocks boomed, and moved under\ntheir feet. Yet the light was with them still, dazzling. As she saw the dead\nrock-face before her, she heard over the thundering of the earth his voice\nspeaking one word, and as she fell to her knees his staff struck down, over\nher head, against the red rock of the shut door. The rocks burned white as if\nafire, and burst asunder.\n\nOutside them was the sky, paling to dawn. A few white stars lay high and cool\nwithin it.\n\nTenar saw the stars and felt the sweet wind on her face; but she did not get\nup. She crouched on hands and knees there between the earth and sky.\n\nThe man, a strange dark figure in that half-light before the dawn, turned and\npulled at her arm to make her get up. His face was black and twisted like a\ndemon’s. She cowered away from him, shrieking in a thick voice not her own, as\nif a dead tongue moved in her mouth, “No! No! Don’t touch me -leave me- Go!”\nAnd she writhed back away from him, into the crumbling, lipless mouth of the\nTombs.\n\nHis hard grip loosened. He said in a quiet voice, “By the bond you wear I bid\nyou come, Tenar.”\n\nShe saw the starlight on the silver of the ring on her arm. Her eyes on that,\nshe rose, staggering. She put her hand in his, and came with him. She could\nnot run. They walked down the hill. From the black mouth among the rocks\nbehind them issued forth a long, long, groaning howl of hatred and lament.\nStones fell about them. The ground quivered. They went on, she with her eyes\nstill fixed on the glimmer of starlight on her wrist.\n\nThey were in the dim valley westward of the Place. Now they began to climb;\nand all at once he bade her turn. “See-“\n\nShe turned, and saw. They were across the valley, on a level now with the\nTombstones, the nine great monoliths that stood or lay above the cavern of\ndiamonds and graves. The stones that stood were moving. They jerked, and\nleaned slowly like the masts of ships. One of them seemed to twitch and rise\ntaller; then a shudder went through it, and it fell. Another fell, smashing\ncrossways on the first. Behind them the low dome of the Hall of the Throne,\nblack against the yellow light in the east, quivered. The walls bulged. The\nwhole great ruinous mass of stone and masonry changed shape like clay in\nrunning water, sank in upon itself, and with a roar and sudden storm of\nsplinters and dust slid sideways and collapsed. The earth of the valley\nrippled and bucked; a kind of wave ran up the hillside, and a huge crack\nopened among the Tombstones, gaping on the blackness underneath, oozing dust\nlike gray smoke. The stones that still stood upright toppled into it and were\nswallowed. Then with a crash that seemed to echo off the sky itself, the raw\nblack lips of the crack closed together; and the hills shook once, and grew\nstill.\n\nShe looked from the horror of earthquake to the man beside her, whose face she\nhad never seen by daylight. “You held it back,” she said, and her voice piped\nlike the wind in a reed, after that mighty bellowing and crying of the earth.\n“You held back the earthquake, the anger of the dark.”\n\n“We must go on,” he said, turning away from the sunrise and the ruined Tombs.\n“I am tired, I am cold...” He stumbled as they went, and she took his arm.\nNeither could go faster than a dragging walk. Slowly, like two tiny spiders on\na great wall, they toiled up the immense slope of the hill, until at the top\nthey stood on dry ground yellowed by the rising sun and streaked with the\nlong, sparse shadows of the sage. Before them the western mountains stood,\ntheir feet purple, their upper slopes gold. The two paused a moment, then\npassed over the crest of the hill, out of sight of the Place of the Tombs, and\nwere gone.\n\n\n#  The Western Mountains\n\nTenar woke, struggling up from bad dreams, out of places where she had walked\nso long that all the flesh had fallen from her and she could see the double\nwhite bones of her arms glimmer faintly in the dark. She opened her eyes to a\ngolden light, and smelled the pungency of sage. A sweetness came into her as\nshe woke, a pleasure that filled her slowly and wholly till it overflowed, and\nshe sat up, stretching her arms out from the black sleeves of her robe, and\nlooked about her in unquestioning delight.\n\nIt was evening. The sun was down behind the mountains that loomed close and\nhigh to westward, but its afterglow filled all earth and sky: a vast, clear,\nwintry sky, a vast, barren, golden land of mountains and wide valleys. The\nwind was down. It was cold, and absolutely silent. Nothing moved. The leaves\nof the sagebushes nearby were dry and gray, the stalks of tiny dried-up desert\nherbs prickled her hand. The huge silent glory of light burned on every twig\nand withered leaf and stem, on the hills, in the air.\n\nShe looked to her left and saw the man lying on the desert ground, his cloak\npulled round him, one arm under his head, fast asleep. His face in sleep was\nstern, almost frowning; but his left hand lay relaxed on the dirt, beside a\nsmall thistle that still bore its ragged cloak of gray fluff and its tiny\ndefense of spikes and spines. The man and the small desert thistle; the\nthistle and the sleeping man...\n\nHe was one whose power was akin to, and as strong as, the Old Powers of the\nearth; one who talked with dragons, and held off earthquakes with his word.\nAnd there he lay asleep on the dirt, with a little thistle growing by his\nhand. It was very strange. Living, being in the world, was a much greater and\nstranger thing than she had ever dreamed. The glory of the sky touched his\ndusty hair, and turned the thistle gold for a little while.\n\nThe light was slowly fading. As it did so, the cold seemed to grow intenser\nminute by minute. Tenar got up and began to gather dry sagebrush, picking up\nfallen twigs, breaking off the tough branches that grew as gnarled and\nmassive, in their scale, as the limbs of oaks. They had stopped here about\nnoon, when it was warm, and they could go no farther for weariness. A couple\nof stunted junipers, and the westward slope of the ridge they had just\ndescended, had offered shelter enough; they had drunk a little water from the\nflask, and lain down, and gone to sleep.\n\nThere was a litter of larger branches under the little trees, which she\ngathered. Scooping out a pit in an angle of earth-embedded rocks, she built up\na fire, and lit it with her flint and steel. The tinder of sage leaves and\ntwigs caught at once. Dry branches bloomed into rosy flame, scented with\nresin. Now it seemed quite dark, all around the fire; and the stars were\ncoming out again in the tremendous sky.\n\nThe snap and crack of the flames roused the sleeper. He sat up, rubbing his\nhands over his grimy face, and at last got up stiffly and came close to the\nfire.\n\n“I wonder-“ he said sleepily.\n\n“I know, but we can’t last the night here without a fire. It gets too cold.”\nAfter a minute she added, “Unless you have some magic that would keep us warm,\nor that would hide the fire...”\n\nHe sat down by the fire, his feet almost in it, his arms round his knees.\n“Brr,” he said. “A fire is much better than magic. I’ve put a little illusion\nabout us here; if someone comes by, we might look like sticks and stones to\nhim. What do you think? Will they be following us?”\n\n“I fear it, yet I don’t think they will. No one but Kossil knew of your being\nthere. Kossil, and Manan. And they are dead. Surely she was in the Hall when\nit fell. She was waiting at the trapdoor. And the others, the rest, they must\nthink that I was in the Hall or the Tombs, and was crushed in the earthquake.”\nShe too put her arms round her knees, and shuddered. “I hope the other\nbuildings didn’t fall. It was hard to see from the hill, there was so much\ndust. Surely all the temples and houses didn’t fall, the Big House where all\nthe girls sleep.”\n\n“I think not. It was the Tombs that devoured themselves. I saw a gold roof of\nsome temple as we turned away; it still stood. And there were figures down the\nhill, people running.”\n\n“What will they say, what will they think... Poor Penthe! She might have to\nbecome the High Priestess of the Godking now. And it was always she who wanted\nto run away. Not I. Maybe now she’ll run away.” Tenar smiled. There was a joy\nin her that no thought nor dread could darken, that same sure joy that had\nrisen in her, waking in the golden light. She opened her bag and took out two\nsmall, flat loaves; she handed one across the fire to Ged, and bit into the\nother. The bread was tough, and sour, and very good to eat.\n\nThey munched together in silence awhile.\n\n“How far are we from the sea?”\n\n“It took me two nights and two days coming. It’ll take us longer going.”\n\n“I’m strong,” she said.\n\n“You are. And valiant. But your companion’s tired,” he said with a smile. “And\nwe haven’t any too much bread.”\n\n“Will we find water?”\n\n“Tomorrow, in the mountains.”\n\n“Can you find food for us?” she asked, rather vaguely and timidly.\n\n“Hunting takes time, and weapons.”\n\n“I meant, with, you know, spells.”\n\n“I can call a rabbit,” he said, poking the fire with a twisted stick of\njuniper. “The rabbits are coming out of their holes all around us, now.\nEvening’s their time. I could call one by name, and he’d come. But would you\ncatch and skin and broil a rabbit that you’d called to you thus? Perhaps if\nyou were starving. But it would be a breaking of trust, I think.”\n\n“Yes. I thought, perhaps you could just...\n\n“Summon up a supper,” he said. “Oh, I could. On golden plates, if you like.\nBut that’s illusion, and when you eat illusions you end up hungrier than\nbefore. It’s about as nourishing as eating your own words.” She saw his white\nteeth flash a moment in the firelight.\n\n“Your magic is peculiar,” she said, with a little dignity of equals, Priestess\naddressing Mage. “It appears to be useful only for large matters.”\n\nHe laid more wood on the fire, and it flared up in a juniperscented fireworks\nof sparks and crackles.\n\n“Can you really call a rabbit?” Tenar inquired suddenly.\n\n“Do you want me to?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\nHe turned away from the fire and said softly into the immense and starlit\ndark, “Kebbo... O kebbo...”\n\nSilence. No sound. No motion. Only presently, at the very edge of the\nflickering firelight, a round eye like a pebble of jet, very near the ground.\nA curve of furry back; an ear, long, alert, upraised.\n\nGed spoke again. The ear flicked, gained a sudden partner-ear out of the\nshadow; then as the little beast turned Tenar saw it entire for an instant,\nthe small, soft, lithe hop of it returning unconcerned to its business in the\nnight.\n\n“Ah!” she said, letting out her breath. “That’s lovely.” Presently she asked,\n“Could I do that?”\n\n“Well-“\n\n“It is a secret,” she said at once, dignified again.\n\n“The rabbit’s name is a secret. At least, one should not use it lightly, for\nno reason. But what is not a secret, but rather a gift, or a mystery, do you\nsee, is the power of calling.”\n\n“Oh,” she said, “that you have. I know!” There was a passion in her voice, not\nhidden by pretended mockery. He looked at her and did not answer.\n\nHe was indeed still worn out by his struggle against the Nameless Ones; he had\nspent his strength in the quaking tunnels. Though he had won, he had little\nspirit left for exultation. He soon curled up again, as near the fire as he\ncould get, and slept.\n\nTenar sat feeding the fire and watching the blaze of the winter constellations\nfrom horizon to horizon until her head grew giddy with splendor and silence,\nand she dozed off.\n\nThey both woke. The fire was dead. The stars she had watched were now far over\nthe mountains and new ones had risen in the east. It was the cold that woke\nthem, the dry cold of the desert night, the wind like a knife of ice. A veil\nof cloud was coming over the sky from the southwest.\n\nThe gathered firewood was almost gone. “Let’s walk,” Ged said, “it’s not long\ntill dawn.” His teeth chattered so that she could hardly understand him. They\nset out, climbing the long slow slope westward. The bushes and rocks showed\nblack in starlight, and it was as easy to walk as in the day. After a cold\nfirst while, the walking warmed them; they stopped crouching and shivering,\nand began to go easier. So by sunrise they were on the first rise of the\nwestern mountains, which had walled in Tenar’s life till then.\n\nThey stopped in a grove of trees whose golden, quivering leaves still clung to\nthe boughs. He told her they were aspens; she knew no trees but juniper, and\nthe sickly poplars by the riversprings, and the forty apple trees of the\norchard of the Place. A small bird among the aspens said “dee, dee,” in a\nsmall voice. Under the trees ran a stream, narrow but powerful, shouting,\nmuscular over its rocks and falls, too hasty to freeze. Tenar was almost\nafraid of it. She was used to the desert where things are silent and move\nslowly: sluggish rivers, shadows of clouds, vultures circling.\n\nThey divided a piece of bread and a last crumbling bit of cheese for\nbreakfast, rested a little, and went on.\n\nBy evening they were up high. It was overcast and windy, freezing weather.\nThey camped in the valley of another stream, where there was plenty of wood,\nand this time built up a sturdy fire of logs by which they could keep fairly\nwarm.\n\nTenar was happy. She had found a squirrel’s cache of nuts, exposed by the\nfalling of a hollow tree: a couple of pounds of fine walnuts and a smooth-\nshelled kind that Ged, not knowing the Kargish name, called ubir. She cracked\nthem one by one between a flat stone and a hammerstone, and handed every\nsecond nutmeat to the man.\n\n“I wish we could stay here,” she said, looking down at the windy, twilit\nvalley between the hills. “I like this place.”\n\n“This is a good place,” he agreed.\n\n“People would never come here.”\n\n“Not often... I was born in the mountains,” he said, “on the Mountain of Gont.\nWe shall pass it, sailing to Havnor, if we take the northern way. It’s\nbeautiful to see it in winter, rising all white out of the sea, like a greater\nwave. My village was by just such a stream as this one. Where were you born,\nTenar?”\n\n“In the north of Atuan, in Entat, I think. I can’t remember it.”\n\n“They took you so young?”\n\n“I was five. I remember a fire on a hearth, and... nothing else.”\n\nHe rubbed his jaw, which though it had acquired a sparse beard, was at least\nclean; despite the cold, both of them had washed in the mountain streams. He\nrubbed his jaw and looked thoughtful and severe. She watched him, and never\ncould she have said what was in her heart as she watched him, in the\nfirelight, in the mountain dusk.\n\n“What are you going to do in Havnor?” he said, asking the question of the\nfire, not of her. “You are -more than I had realized- truly reborn.”\n\nShe nodded, smiling a little. She felt newborn.\n\n“You should learn the language, at least.”\n\n“Your language?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“I’d like to”\n\n“Well, then. This is kabat,” and he tossed a little stone into the lap of her\nblack robe.\n\n“Kabat. Is that in the dragon-tongue?”\n\n“No, no. You don’t want to work spells, you want to talk with other men and\nwomen!”\n\n“But what is a pebble in the dragon’s tongue?”\n\n“Tolk,” he said. “But I am not making you my apprentice sorcerer. I’m teaching\nyou the language people speak in the Archipelago, the Inner Lands. I had to\nlearn your language before I came here.”\n\n“You speak it oddly.”\n\n“No doubt. Now, arkemmi kabat,” and he held out his hands for her to give him\nthe pebble.\n\n“Must I go to Havnor?” she said.\n\n“Where else would you go, Tenar?”\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n“Havnor is a beautiful city,” he said. “And you bring it the ring, the sign of\npeace, the lost treasure. They’ll welcome you in Havnor as a princess. They’ll\ndo you honor for the great gift you bring them, and bid you welcome, and make\nyou welcome. They are a noble and generous people in that city. They’ll call\nyou the White Lady because of your fair skin, and they’ll love you the more\nbecause you are so young. And because you are beautiful. You’ll have a hundred\ndresses like the one I showed you by illusion, but real ones. You’ll meet with\npraise, and gratitude, and love. You who have known nothing but solitude and\nenvy and the dark.”\n\n“There was Manan,” she said, defensive, her mouth trembling just a little. “He\nloved me and was kind to me, always. He protected me as well as he knew how,\nand I killed him for it; he fell into the black pit. I don’t want to go to\nHavnor. I don’t want to go there. I want to stay here.”\n\n“Here- in Atuan?”\n\n“In the mountains. Where we are now.”\n\n“Tenar,” he said in his grave, quiet voice, “we’ll stay then. I haven’t my\nknife, and if it snows it will be hard. But so long as we can find food-“\n\n“No. I know we can’t stay. I’m merely being foolish,” Tenar said, and got up,\nscattering walnut shells, to lay new wood on the fire. She stood thin and very\nstraight in her torn, dirt-stained gown and cloak of black. “All I know is of\nno use now,” she said, “and I haven’t learned anything else. I will try to\nlearn.”\n\nGed looked away, wincing as if in pain.\n\nNext day they crossed the summit of the tawny range. In the pass a hard wind\nblew, with snow in it, stinging and blinding. It was not until they had come\ndown a long way on the other side, out from under the snow clouds of the\npeaks, that Tenar saw the land beyond the mountain wall. It was all green-\ngreen of pines, of grasslands, of sown fields and fallows. Even in the dead of\nwinter, when the thickets were bare and the forests full of gray boughs, it\nwas a green land, humble and mild. They looked down on it from a high, rocky\nslant of the mountainside. Wordless, Ged pointed to the west, where the sun\nwas getting low behind a thick cream and roil of clouds. The sun itself was\nhidden, but there was a glitter on the horizon, almost like the dazzle of the\ncrystal walls of the Undertomb, a kind of joyous shimmering off on the edge of\nthe world.\n\n“What is that?” the girl said, and he: “The sea.”\n\nShortly afterward, she saw a less wonderful thing than that, but wonderful\nenough. They came on a road, and followed it; and it brought them by dusk into\na village: ten or a dozen houses strung along the road. She looked at her\ncompanion in alarm when she realized they were coming among men. She looked,\nand did not see him. Beside her, in Ged’s clothing, and with his gait, and in\nhis shoes, strode another man. He had a white skin, and no beard. He glanced\nat her; his eyes were blue. He winked.\n\n“Will I fool ‘em?” he said. “How are your clothes?”\n\nShe looked down at herself. She had on a countrywoman’s brown skirt and\njacket, and a large red woolen shawl.\n\n“Oh,” she said, stopping short. “Oh, you are- you are Ged!” As she said his\nname she saw him perfectly clearly, the dark, scarred face she knew, the dark\neyes; yet there stood the milk-faced stranger.\n\n“Don’t say my true name before others. Nor will I say yours. We are brother\nand sister, come from Tenacbah. And I think I’ll ask for a bite of supper if I\nsee a kindly face.” He took her hand and they entered the village.\n\nThey left it next morning with full stomachs, after a pleasant sleep in a\nhayloft.\n\n“Do Mages often beg?” asked Tenar, on the road between green fields, where\ngoats and little spotted cattle grazed.\n\n“Why do you ask?”\n\n“You seemed used to begging. In fact you were good at it.”\n\n“Well, yes. I’ve begged all my life, if you look at it that way. Wizards don’t\nown much, you know. In fact nothing but their staff and clothing, if they\nwander. They are received and given food and shelter, by most people, gladly.\nThey do make some return.”\n\n“What return?”\n\n“Well, that woman in the village. I cured her goats.”\n\n“What was wrong with them?”\n\n“They both had infected udders. I used to herd goats when I was a boy.”\n\n“Did you tell her you’d cured them?”\n\n“No. How could I? Why should I?”\n\nAfter a pause she said, “I see your magic is not good only for large things.”\n\n“Hospitality,” he said, “kindness to a stranger, that’s a very large thing.\nThanks are enough, of course. But I was sorry for the goats.”\n\nIn the afternoon they came by a large town. It was built of clay brick, and\nwalled round in the Kargish fashion, with overhanging battlements, watchtowers\nat the four corners, and a single gate, under which drovers were herding a big\nflock of sheep. The red tile roofs of a hundred or more houses poked up over\nthe walls of yellowish brick. At the gate stood two guards in the red-plumed\nhelmets of the Godking’s service. Tenar had seen men in such helmets come,\nonce a year or so, to the Place, escorting offerings of slaves or money to the\nGodking’s temple. When she told Ged that, as they passed by outside the walls,\nhe said, “I saw them too, as a boy. They came raiding to Gont. They came into\nmy village, to plunder it. But they were driven off. And there was a battle\ndown by Armouth, on the shore; many men were killed, hundreds, they say. Well,\nperhaps now that the ring is rejoined and the Lost Rune remade, there will be\nno more such raiding and killing between the Kargish Empire and the Inner\nLands.”\n\n“It would be foolish if such things went on,” said Tenar. “What would the\nGodking ever do with so many slaves?”\n\nHer companion appeared to ponder this awhile. “If the Kargish lands defeated\nthe Archipelago, you mean?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“I don’t think that would be likely to happen.”\n\n“But look how strong the Empire is- that great city, with its walls, and all\nits men. How could your lands stand against them, if they attacked?’\n\n“That is not a very big city,” he said cautiously and gently. “I too would\nhave thought it tremendous, when I was new from my mountain. But there are\nmany, many cities in Earthsea, among which this is only a town. There are\nmany, many lands. You will see them, Tenar.”\n\nShe said nothing. She trudged along the road, her face set.\n\n“It is marvelous to see them: the new lands rising from the sea as your boat\ncomes towards them. The farmlands and forests, the cities with their harbors\nand palaces, the marketplaces where they sell everything in the world.”\n\nShe nodded. She knew he was trying to hearten her, but she had left joy up in\nthe mountains, in the twilit valley of the stream. There was a dread in her\nnow that grew and grew. All that lay ahead of her was unknown. She knew\nnothing but the desert and the Tombs. What good was that? She knew the\nturnings of a ruined maze, she knew the dances danced before a fallen altar.\nShe knew nothing of forests, or cities, or the hearts of men.\n\nShe said suddenly, “Will you stay with me there?”\n\nShe did not look at him. He was in his illusory disguise, a white-skinned\nKargish countryman, and she did not like to see him so. But his voice was\nunchanged, the same voice that had spoken in the darkness of the Labyrinth.\n\nHe was slow to answer. “Tenar, I go where I am sent. I follow my calling. It\nhas not yet let me stay in any land for long. Do you see that? I do what I\nmust do. Where I go, I must go alone. So long as you need me, I’ll be with you\nin Havnor. And if you ever need me again, call me. I will come. I would come\nfrom my grave if you called me, Tenar! But I cannot stay with you.”\n\nShe said nothing. After a while he said, “You will not need me long, there.\nYou will be happy.”\n\nShe nodded, accepting, silent.\n\nThey went on side by side towards the sea.\n\n\n#  Voyage\n\nHe had hidden his boat in a cave on the side of a great rocky headland, Cloud\nCape it was called by the villagers nearby, one of whom gave them a bowl of\nfish stew for their supper. They made their way down the cliffs to the beach\nin the last light of the gray day. The cave was a narrow crack that went back\ninto the rock for about thirty feet; its sandy floor was damp, for it lay just\nabove the high-tide mark. Its opening was visible from sea, and Ged said they\nshould not light a fire lest the night-fishermen out in their small craft\nalong shore should see it and be curious. So they lay miserably on the sand,\nwhich seemed so soft between the fingers and was rock-hard to the tired body.\nAnd Tenar listened to the sea, a few yards below the cave mouth, crashing and\nsucking and booming on the rocks, and the thunder of it down the beach\neastward for miles. Over and over and over it made the same sounds, yet never\nquite the same. It never rested. On all the shores of all the lands in all the\nworld, it heaved itself in these unresting waves, and never ceased, and never\nwas still. The desert, the mountains: they stood still. They did not cry out\nforever in a great, dull voice. The sea spoke forever, but its language was\nforeign to her. She did not understand.\n\nIn the first gray light, when the tide was low, she roused from uneasy sleep\nand saw the wizard go out of the cave. She watched him walk, barefoot and with\nbelted cloak, on the black-haired rocks below, seeking something. He came\nback, darkening the cave as he entered. “Here,” he said, holding out a handful\nof wet, hideous things like purple rocks and orange lips.\n\n“What are they?”\n\n“Mussels, off the rocks. And those two are oysters, even better. Look- like\nthis.” With the little dagger from her keyring, which she had lent him up in\nthe mountains, he opened a shell and ate the orange mussel with seawater as\nits sauce.\n\n“You don’t even cook it? You ate it alive!”\n\nShe would not look at him while he, shamefaced but undeterred, went on opening\nand eating the shellfish one by one.\n\nWhen he was done, he went back into the cave to the boat, which lay prow\nforward, kept from the sand by several long driftwood logs. Tenar had looked\nat the boat the night before, mistrustfully and without comprehension. It was\nmuch larger than she had thought boats were, three times her own length. It\nwas full of objects she did not know the use of, and it looked dangerous. On\neither side of its nose (which is what she called the prow) an eye was\npainted; and in her halfsleep she had constantly felt the boat staring at her.\n\nGed rummaged about inside it a moment and came back with something: a packet\nof hard bread, well wrapped to keep dry. He offered her a large piece.\n\n“I’m not hungry.”\n\nHe looked into her sullen face.\n\nHe put the bread away, wrapping it as before, and then sat down in the mouth\nof the cave. “About two hours till the tide’s back in,” he said. “Then we can\ngo. You had a restless night, why don’t you sleep now.”\n\n“I’m not sleepy.”\n\nHe made no answer. He sat there, in profile to her, cross-legged in the dark\narch of rocks; the shining heave and movement of the sea was beyond him as she\nwatched him from deeper in the cave. He did not move. He was still as the\nrocks themselves. Stillness spread out from him, like rings from a stone\ndropped in water. His silence became not absence of speech, but a thing in\nitself, like the silence of the desert,\n\nAfter a long time Tenar got up and came to the mouth of the cave. He did not\nmove. She looked down at his face. It was as if cast in copper-rigid, the dark\neyes not shut, but looking down, the mouth serene.\n\nHe was as far beyond her as the sea.\n\nWhere was he now, on what way of the spirit did he walk? She could never\nfollow him.\n\nHe had made her follow him. He had called her by her name, and she had come\ncrouching to his hand, as the little wild desert rabbit had come to him out of\nthe dark. And now that he had the ring, now that the Tombs were in ruin and\ntheir priestess forsworn forever, now he didn’t need her, and went away where\nshe could not follow. He would not stay with her. He had fooled her, and would\nleave her desolate.\n\nShe reached down and with one swift gesture plucked from his belt the little\nsteel dagger she had given him. He moved no more than a robbed statue.\n\nThe dagger blade was only four inches long, sharp on one side; it was the\nminiature of a sacrificial knife. It was part of the garments of the Priestess\nof the Tombs, who must wear it along with the ring of keys, and a belt of\nhorsehair, and other items some of which had no known purpose. She had never\nused the dagger for anything, except that in one of the dances performed at\ndark of the moon she would throw and catch it before the Throne. She had liked\nthat dance; it was a wild one, with no music but the drumming of her own feet.\nShe had used to cut her fingers, practicing it, till she got the trick of\ncatching the knife handle every time. The little blade was sharp enough to cut\na finger to the bone, or to cut the arteries of a throat. She would serve her\nMasters still, though they had betrayed her and forsaken her. They would guide\nand drive her hand in the last act of darkness. They would accept the\nsacrifice.\n\nShe turned upon the man, the knife held back in her right hand behind her hip.\nAs she did so he raised his face slowly and looked at her. He had the look of\none come from a long way off, one who has seen terrible things. His face was\ncalm but full of pain. As he gazed up at her and seemed to see her more and\nmore clearly, his expression cleared. At last he said, “Tenar,” as if in\ngreeting, and reached up his hand to touch the band of pierced and carven\nsilver on her wrist. He did this as if reassuring himself, trustingly. He did\nnot pay attention to the dagger in her hand. He looked away, at the waves,\nwhich heaved deep over the rocks below, and said with effort, “It’s time...\nTime we were going.”\n\nAt the sound of his voice the fury left her. She was afraid.\n\n“You’ll leave them behind, Tenar. You’re going free now,” he said, getting up\nwith sudden vigor. He stretched, and belted his cloak tight again. “Give me a\nhand with the boat. She’s up on logs, for rollers. That’s it, push... again.\nThere, there, enough. Now be ready to hop in when I say ‘hop.’ This is a\ntricky place to launch from- once more. There! In you go!”-and leaping in\nafter her, he caught her as she overbalanced, sat her down in the bottom of\nthe boat, braced his legs wide, and standing to the oars sent the boat\nshooting out on an ebb wave over the rocks, out past the roaring foam-drenched\nhead of the cape, and so to sea.\n\nHe shipped the oars when they were well away from shoal water, and stepped the\nmast. The boat looked very small, now that she was inside it and the sea was\noutside it.\n\nHe put up the sail. All the gear had a look of long, hard use, though the dull\nred sail was patched with great care and the boat was as clean and trim as\ncould be. They were like their master: they had gone far, and had not been\ntreated gently.\n\n“Now,” he said, “now we’re away, now we’re clear, we’re clean gone, Tenar. Do\nyou feel it?”\n\nShe did feel it. A dark hand had let go its lifelong hold upon her heart. But\nshe did not feel joy, as she had in the mountains. She put her head down in\nher arms and cried, and her cheeks were salt and wet. She cried for the waste\nof her years in bondage to a useless evil. She wept in pain, because she was\nfree.\n\nWhat she had begun to learn was the weight of liberty. Freedom is a heavy\nload, a great and strange burden for the spirit to undertake. It is not easy.\nIt is not a gift given, but a choice made, and the choice may be a hard one.\nThe road goes upward towards the light; but the laden traveler may never reach\nthe end of it.\n\nGed let her cry, and said no word of comfort; nor when she was done with tears\nand sat looking back towards the low blue land of Atuan, did he speak. His\nface was stern and alert, as if he were alone; he saw to the sail and the\nsteering, quick and silent, looking always ahead.\n\nIn the afternoon he pointed rightward of the sun, towards which they now\nsailed. “That is Karego-At,” he said, and Tenar following his gesture saw the\ndistant loom of hills like clouds, the great island of the Godking. Atuan was\nout of sight behind them. Her heart was very heavy. The sun beat in her eyes\nlike a hammer of gold.\n\nSupper was dry bread, and dried smoked fish, which tasted vile to Tenar, and\nwater from the boat’s cask, which Ged had filled at a stream on Cloud Cape\nbeach the evening before. The winter night came down soon and cold upon the\nsea. Far off to northward they saw for a while the tiny glitter of lights,\nyellow firelight in distant villages on the shore of Karego-At. These vanished\nin a haze that rose up from the ocean, and they were alone in the starless\nnight over deep water.\n\nShe had curled up in the stern; Ged lay down in the prow, with the water cask\nfor a pillow. The boat moved on steadily, the low swells slapping her sides a\nlittle, though the wind was only a faint breath from the south. Out here, away\nfrom the rocky shores, the sea too was silent; only as it touched the boat did\nit whisper a little.\n\n“If the wind is from the south,” Tenar said, whispering because the sea did,\n“doesn’t the boat sail north?”\n\n“Yes, unless we tack. But I’ve put the mage-wind in her sail, to the west. By\ntomorrow morning we should be out of Kargish waters. Then I’ll let her go by\nthe world’s wind.”\n\n“Does it steer itself?”\n\n“Yes,” Ged replied with gravity, “given the proper instructions. She doesn’t\nneed many. She’s been in the open sea, beyond the farthest isle of the East\nReach; she’s been to Selidor where Erreth-Akbe died, in the farthest West.\nShe’s a wise crafty boat, my Lookfar. You can trust her.”\n\nIn the boat moved by magic over the great deep, the girl lay looking up into\nthe dark. All her life she had looked into the dark; but this was a vaster\ndarkness, this night on the ocean. There was no end to it. There was no roof.\nIt went on out beyond the stars. No earthly Powers moved it. It had been\nbefore light, and would be after. It had been before life, and would be after.\nIt went on beyond evil.\n\nIn the dark, she spoke: “The little island, where the talisman was given you,\nis that in this sea?”\n\n“Yes,” his voice answered out of the dark. “Somewhere. To the south, perhaps.\nI could not find it again.”\n\n“I know who she was, the old woman who gave you the ring.”\n\n“You know?”\n\n“I was told the tale. It is part of the knowledge of the First Priestess. Thar\ntold it to me, first when Kossil was there, then more fully when we were\nalone; it was the last time she talked to me before she died. There was a\nnoble house in Hupun who fought against the rise of the High Priests in\nAwabath. The founder of the house was King Thoreg, and among the treasures he\nleft his descendants was the half-ring, which Erreth-Akbe had given him.”\n\n“That indeed is told in the Deed of Erreth-Akbe. It says... in your tongue it\nsays, ‘When the ring was broken, half remained in the hand of the High Priest\nIntathin, and half in the hero’s hand. And the High Priest sent the broken\nhalf to the Nameless, to the Ancient of the Earth in Atuan, and it went into\nthe dark, into the lost places. But Erreth-Akbe gave the broken half into the\nhands of the maiden Tiarath, daughter of the wise king, saying: “Let it remain\nin the light, in the maiden’s dowry, let it remain in this land until it be\nrejoined.” So spoke the hero before he sailed to the west.’ “\n\n“So it must have gone from daughter to daughter of that house, over all the\nyears. It was not lost, as your people thought. But as the High Priests made\nthemselves into the Priest-Kings, and then when the Priest-Kings made the\nEmpire and began to call themselves Godkings, all this time the house of\nThoreg grew poorer and weaker. And at last, so Thar told me, there were only\ntwo of the lineage of Thoreg left, little children, a boy and a girl. The\nGodking in Awabath then was the father of him who rules now. He had the\nchildren stolen from their palace in Hupun. There was a prophecy that one of\nthe descendants of Thoreg of Hupun would bring about the fall of the Empire in\nthe end, and that frightened him. He had the children stolen away, and taken\nto a lonely isle somewhere out in the middle of the sea, and left there with\nnothing but the clothes they wore and a little food. He feared to kill them by\nknife or strangling or poison; they were of kingly blood, and murder of kings\nbrings a curse even on the gods. They were named Ensar and Anthil. It was\nAnthil who gave you the broken ring.”\n\nHe was silent a long while. “So the story comes whole,” he said at last, “even\nas the ring is made whole. But it is a cruel story, Tenar. The little\nchildren, that isle, the old man and woman I saw... They scarcely knew human\nspeech.”\n\n“I would ask you something.”\n\n“Ask.”\n\n“I do not wish to go to the Inner Lands, to Havnor. I do not belong there, in\nthe great cities among foreign men. I do not belong to any land. I betrayed my\nown people. I have no people. And I have done a very evil thing. Put me alone\non an island, as the king’s children were left, on a lone isle where there are\nno people, where there is no one. Leave me, and take the ring to Havnor. It is\nyours, not mine. It has nothing to do with me. Nor have your people. Let me be\nby myself!”\n\nSlowly, gradually, yet startling her, a light dawned like a small moonrise in\nthe blackness before her; the wizardly light that came at his command. It\nclung to the end of his staff, which he held upright as he sat facing her in\nthe prow. It lit the bottom of the sail, and the gunwales, and the planking,\nand his face, with a silvery glow. He was looking straight at her.\n\n“What evil have you done, Tenar?”\n\n“I ordered that three men be shut into a room beneath the Throne, and starved\nto death. They died of hunger and thirst. They died, and are buried there in\nthe Undertomb. The Tombstones fell on their graves.” She stopped.\n\n“Is there more?”\n\n“Manan.”\n\n“That death is on my soul.”\n\n“No. He died because he loved me, and was faithful. He thought he was\nprotecting me. He held the sword above my neck. When I was little he was kind\nto me -when I cried-“ She stopped again, for the tears rose hard in her, yet\nshe would cry no more. Her hands were clenched on the black folds of her\ndress. “I was never kind to him,” she said. “I will not go to Havnor. I will\nnot go with you. Find some isle where no one comes, and put me there, and\nleave me. The evil must be paid for. I am not free.”\n\nThe soft light, grayed by sea mist, glimmered between them.\n\n“Listen, Tenar. Heed me. You were the vessel of evil. The evil is poured out.\nIt is done. It is buried in its own tomb. You were never made for cruelty and\ndarkness; you were made to hold light, as a lamp burning holds and gives its\nlight. I found the lamp unlit; I won’t leave it on some desert island like a\nthing found and cast away. I’ll take you to Havnor and say to the princes of\nEarthsea, ‘Look! In the place of darkness I found the light, her spirit. By\nher an old evil was brought to nothing. By her I was brought out of the grave.\nBy her the broken was made whole, and where there was hatred there will be\npeace.’”\n\n“I will not,” Tenar said in agony. “I cannot. It’s not true!”\n\n“And after that,” he went on quietly, “I’ll take you away from the princes and\nthe rich lords; for it’s true that you have no place there. You are too young,\nand too wise. I’ll take you to my own land, to Gont where I was born, to my\nold master Ogion. He’s an old man now, a very great Mage, a man of quiet\nheart. They call him ‘the Silent.’ He lives in a small house on the great\ncliffs of Re Albi, high over the sea. He keeps some goats, and a garden patch.\nIn autumn he goes wandering over the island, alone, in the forests, on the\nmountainsides, through the valleys of the rivers. I lived there once with him,\nwhen I was younger than you are now. I didn’t stay long, I hadn’t the sense to\nstay. I went off seeking evil, and sure enough I found it... But you come\nescaping evil; seeking freedom; seeking silence for a while, until you find\nyour own way. There you will find kindness and silence, Tenar. There the lamp\nwill burn out of the wind awhile. Will you do that?”\n\nThe sea mist drifted gray between their faces. The boat lifted lightly on the\nlong waves. Around them was the night and under them the sea.\n\n“I will,” she said with a long sigh. And after a long time, “Oh, I wish it\nwere sooner... that we could go there now...”\n\n“It won’t be long, little one.”\n\n“Will you come there, ever?”\n\n“When I can I will come.”\n\nThe light had died away; it was all dark around them.\n\nThey came, after the sunrises and sunsets, the still days and the icy winds of\ntheir winter voyage, to the Inmost Sea. They sailed the crowded lanes among\ngreat ships, up the Ebavnor Straits and into the bay that lies locked in the\nheart of Havnor, and across the bay to Havnor Great Port. They saw the white\ntowers, and all the city white and radiant in snow. The roofs of the bridges\nand the red roofs of the houses were snow-covered, and the rigging of the\nhundred ships in the harbor glittered with ice in the winter sun. News of\ntheir coming had run ahead of them, for Lookfar’s patched red sail was known\nin those seas; a great crowd had gathered on the snowy quays, and colored\npennants cracked above the people in the bright, cold wind.\n\nTenar sat in the stern, erect, in her ragged cloak of black. She looked at the\nring around her wrist, then at the crowded, many-colored shore and the palaces\nand the high towers. She lifted up her right hand, and sunlight flashed on the\nsilver of the ring. A cheer went up, faint and joyous on the wind, over the\nrestless water. Ged brought the boat in. A hundred hands reached to catch the\nrope he flung up to the mooring. He leapt up onto the pier and turned, holding\nout his hand to her. “Come!” he said smiling, and she rose, and came. Gravely\nshe walked beside him up the white streets of Havnor, holding his hand, like a\nchild coming home.\n\n\n\n\n",

My \nfather asked him if it was that all the sorcerers and witches \nhad left that isle, and he answered, No: there were some \nthere who had been sorcerers, but they cast no more spells, \nnot even so much as a charm for kettle-mending or the \nfinding of a lost needle. And my father asked, Were not the \nfolk of Narveduen dismayed? And the sea captain said \nagain, No, they seemed uncaring. And indeed, he said, there \nwas sickness among them, and their autumn harvest had \nbeen poor, and still they seemed careless. He said -I was \nthere, when he spoke to the prince- he said, `They were like \nsick men, like a man who has been told he must die within \nthe year, and tells himself it is not true, and he will live \nforever. They go about,' he said, `without looking at the \nworld.' When other traders returned, they repeated the tale \nthat Narveduen had become a poor land and had lost the \narts of wizardry.

Soon the crowds thinned and the shops \ngrew wretchedly poor, little kennels displaying as all their \nwares a handful of bent nails, a broken pestle, and an old \ncardingcomb.

And the peddler's abjectness \nhad shocked him. He thought of the cool, bright streets of \nhis Northern town. No man in Berila, he thought, would \nhave grovelled to a stranger like that. \"These are a foul folk!\" \nhe said. \n",

He made \nmoney from his art, showing any who paid him whatever \nspirit they asked to see, dead wife or husband or child, \nfilling his house with unquiet shadows of old centuries, the \nfair women of the days of the Kings. I saw him summon \nfrom the Dry Land my own old master who was Archmage \nin my youth, Nemmerle, for a mere trick to entertain the \nidle. And that great soul came at his call, like a dog to heel. I \nwas angry and challenged him -I was not Archmage then- \nsaying, 'You compel the dead to come into your house: will \nyou come with me to theirs?'

They dance their anger on the wind.\" \nAnd presently he said, \"Now we're in the hornet's nest.\" \nFor the dragons had seen the little sail on the waves, and \nfirst one, then another, broke from the whirlwind of their \ndancing and came stretched long and level on the air, \nrowing with great wings, straight toward the boat. \nThe mage looked at Arren, who sat at the tiller, since the \nwaves ran rough and counter. The boy held it steady with a \nsteady hand, though his eyes were on the beating of those \nwings. As if satisfied, Sparrowhawk turned again, and \nstanding by the mast, let the magewind drop from the sail. \nHe lifted up his staff and spoke aloud. \nAt the sound of his voice and the words of the Old \nSpeech, some of the dragons wheeled in mid flight, \nscattering, and returned to the isles.

As \nthe dragon's act and death had broken the binding spell, he \nhad drawn his sword, there on the beach of Selidor. And \nhere, though he was no more than a shadow, he was a \nliving shadow, and bore the shadow of his sword. \nThere was no other brightness anywhere. It was like a \nlate twilight under clouds at the end of November, a dour, \nchill, dull air in which one could see, but not clearly and not \nfar. Arren knew the place, the moors and barrens of his \nhopeless dreams; but it seemed to him that he was farther, \nimmensely farther, than he had ever been in dream. He \ncould make out nothing distinctly, except that he and his \ncompanion stood on the slope of a hill, and before them was \na low wall of stones, no higher than a man's knee. \nGed still kept his right hand on Arren's arm. He moved \nforward now, and Arren went with him; they stepped over \nthe wall of stones. \nFormless, the long slope fell away before them, \ndescending into the dark. \nBut overhead, where Arren had thought to see a heavy \novercast of clouds, the sky was black, and there were stars. \nHe looked at them, and it seemed as if his heart shrank \nsmall and cold within him.

And, just as in the now of the so-called real world, I\ndidn’t know what would happen next. I could guess, foretell, fear, hope, but I\ndidn’t know.\n\nUnable to continue Tehanu’s story (because it hadn’t happened yet) and\nfoolishly assuming that the story of Ged and Tenar had reached its happily-\never-after, I gave the book a subtitle: “The Last Book of Earthsea.”\n\nO foolish writer. Now moves. Even in storytime, dreamtime, once-upon-a time,\nnow isn’t then.\n\nSeven or eight years after Tehanu was published, I was asked to write a story\nset in Earthsea. A mere glimpse at the place told me that things had been\nhappening there while I wasn’t looking. It was high time to go back and find\nout what was going on now.\n\nI also wanted information on various things that had happened back then,\nbefore Ged and Tenar were born. A good deal about Earthsea, about wizards,\nabout Roke Island, about dragons, had begun to puzzle me. In order to\nunderstand current events, I needed to do some historical research, to spend\nsome time in the Archives of the Archipelago.\n\nThe way one does research into nonexistent history is to tell the story and\nfind out what happened. I believe this isn’t very different from what\nhistorians of the so-called real world do. Even if we are present at some\nhistoric event, do we comprehend it-can we even remember it-until we can tell\nit as a story? And for events in times or places outside our own experience,\nwe have nothing to go on but the stories other people tell us. Past events\nexist, after all, only in memory, which is a form of imagination. The event is\nreal now, but once it’s then, its continuing reality is entirely up to us,\ndependent on our energy and honesty. If we let it drop from memory, only\nimagination can restore the least glimmer of it. If we lie about the past,\nforcing it to tell a story we want it to tell, to mean what we want it to\nmean, it loses its reality, becomes a fake. To bring the past along with us\nthrough time in the hold-alls of myth and history is a heavy undertaking; but\nas Lao Tzu says, wise people march along with the baggage wagons.\n\nWhen you construct or reconstruct a world that never existed, a wholly\nfictional history, the research is of a somewhat different order, but the\nbasic impulse and techniques are much the same. You look at what happens and\ntry to see why it happens, you listen to what the people there tell you and\nwatch what they do, you think about it seriously, and you try to tell it\nhonestly, so that the story will have weight and make sense.\n\nThe five tales in this book explore or extend the world established by the\nfirst four Earthsea novels. Each is a story in its own right, but they will\nprofit by being read after, not before, the novels.\n\n“The Finder” takes place about three hundred years before the time of the\nnovels, in a dark and troubled time; its story casts light on how some of the\ncustoms and institutions of the Archipelago came to be. “The Bones of the\nEarth” is about the wizards who taught the wizard who first taught Ged, and\nshows that it takes more than one mage to stop an earthquake. “Darkrose and\nDiamond” might take place at any time during the last couple of hundred years\nin Earthsea; after all, a love story can happen at any time, anywhere. “On the\nHigh Marsh” is a story from the brief but eventful six years that Ged was\nArchmage of Earthsea. And the last story, “Dragonfly,” which takes place a few\nyears after the end of Tehanu, is the bridge between that book and the next\none, The Other Wind (to be published soon). A dragon bridge.\n\nSo that my mind could move about among the years and centuries without getting\nthings all out of order, and to keep contradictions and discrepancies at a\nminimum while I was writing these stories, I became (somewhat) more systematic\nand methodical, and put my knowledge of the peoples and their history together\ninto “A Description of Earthsea.” Its function is like that of the first big\nmap I drew of all the Archipelago and the Reaches, when I began to work on A\nWizard of Earthsea over thirty years ago: I needed to know where things are,\nand how to get from here to there-in time as well as in space.\n\nBecause this kind of fictional fact, like maps of imaginary realms, is of real\ninterest to some readers, I include the description after the stories. I also\nredrew the geographical maps for this book, and while doing so, happily\ndiscovered a very old one in the Archives in Havnor.\n\nIn the years since I began to write about Earthsea I’ve changed, of course,\nand so have the people who read the books. All times are changing times, but\nours is one of massive, rapid moral and mental transformation. Archetypes turn\ninto millstones, large simplicities get complicated, chaos becomes elegant,\nand what everybody knows is true turns out to be what some people used to\nthink.\n\nIt’s unsettling. For all our delight in the impermanent, the entrancing\nflicker of electronics, we also long for the unalterable.\n\nWe cherish the old stories for their changelessness. Arthur dreams eternally\nin Avalon. Bilbo can go “there and back again,” and “there” is always the\nbeloved familiar Shire. Don Quixote sets out forever to kill a windmill... So\npeople turn to the realms of fantasy for stability, ancient truths, immutable\nsimplicities.\n\nAnd the mills of capitalism provide them. Supply meets demand. Fantasy becomes\na commodity, an industry.\n\nCommodified fantasy takes no risks: it invents nothing, but imitates and\ntrivializes. It proceeds by depriving the old stories of their intellectual\nand ethical complexity, turning their action to violence, their actors to\ndolls, and their truth- telling to sentimental platitude. Heroes brandish\ntheir swords, lasers, wands, as mechanically as combine harvesters, reaping\nprofits. Profoundly disturbing moral choices are sanitized, made cute, made\nsafe. The passionately conceived ideas of the great story-tellers are copied,\nstereotyped, reduced to toys, molded in bright-colored plastic, advertised,\nsold, broken, junked, replaceable, interchangeable.\n\nWhat the commodifiers of fantasy count on and exploit is the insuperable\nimagination of the reader, child or adult, which gives even these dead things\nlife-of a sort, for a while.\n\nImagination like all living things lives now, and it lives with, from, on true\nchange. Like all we do and have, it can be co-opted and degraded; but it\nsurvives commercial and didactic exploitation. The land outlasts the empires.\nThe conquerors may leave desert where there was forest and meadow, but the\nrain will fall, the rivers will run to the sea. The unstable, mutable,\nuntruthful realms of Once-upon-a-time are as much a part of human history and\nthought as the nations in our kaleidoscopic atlases, and some are more\nenduring.\n\nWe have inhabited both the actual and the imaginary realms for a long time.\nBut we don’t live in either place the way our parents or ancestors did.\nEnchantment alters with age, and with the age.\n\nWe know a dozen different Arthurs now, all of them true. The Shire changed\nirrevocably even in Bilbos lifetime. Don Quixote went riding out to Argentina\nand met Jorge Luis Borges there. Plus c’est la meme chose, plus fa change.\n\nIt’s been a joy to me to go back to Earthsea and find it still there, entirely\nfamiliar, and yet changed and still changing. What I thought was going to\nhappen isn’t what’s happening, people aren’t who-or what-I thought they were,\nand I lose my way on islands I thought I knew by heart.\n\nSo these are reports of my explorations and discoveries: tales from Earthsea\nfor those who have liked or think they might like the place, and who are\nwilling to accept these hypotheses: things change: authors and wizards are not\nalways to be trusted: nobody can explain a dragon.\n\n\nThe Finder\n\nI. In the Dark Time\n\n  \n\nTHIS IS THE FIRST PAGE of the Book of the Dark, written some six hundred years\nago in Berila, on Enlad:\n\n“After Elfarran and Morred perished and the Isle of Solea sank beneath the\nsea, the Council of the Wise governed for the child Serriadh until he took the\nthrone. His reign was bright but brief. The kings who followed him in Enlad\nwere seven, and their realm increased in peace and wealth. Then the dragons\ncame to raid among the western lands, and wizards went out in vain against\nthem. King Akambar moved the court from Berila in Enlad to the City of Havnor,\nwhence he sent out his fleet against invaders from the Kargad Lands and drove\nthem back into the East. But still they sent raiding ships even as far as the\nInmost Sea. Of the fourteen Kings of Havnor the last was Maharion, who made\npeace both with the dragons and the Kargs, but at great cost. And after the\nRing of the Runes was broken, and Erreth-Akbe died with the great dragon, and\nMaharion the Brave was killed by treachery, it seemed that no good thing\nhappened in the Archipelago.\n\n“Many claimed Maharion’s throne, but none could keep it, and the quarrels of\nthe claimants divided all loyalties. No commonwealth was left and no justice,\nonly the will of the wealthy. Men of noble houses, merchants, and pirates, any\nwho could hire soldiers and wizards called himself a lord, claiming lands and\ncities as his property. The warlords made those they conquered slaves, and\nthose they hired were in truth slaves, having only their masters to safeguard\nthem from rival warlords seizing the lands, and sea-pirates raiding the ports,\nand bands and hordes of lawless, miserable men dispossessed of their living,\ndriven by hunger to raid and rob.”\n\nThe Book of the Dark, written late in the time it tells of, is a compilation\nof self-contradictory histories, partial biographies, and garbled legends. But\nit’s the best of the records that survived the dark years. Wanting praise, not\nhistory, the warlords burnt the books in which the poor and powerless might\nlearn what power is.\n\nBut when the lore-books of a wizard came into a warlord’s hands he was likely\nto treat them with caution, locking them away to keep them harmless or giving\nthem to a wizard in his hire to do with as he wished. In the margins of the\nspells and word lists and in the endpapers of these books of lore a wizard or\nhis prentice might record a plague, a famine, a raid, a change of masters,\nalong with the spells worked in such events and their success or unsuccess.\nSuch random records reveal a clear moment here and there, though all between\nthose moments is darkness. They are like glimpses of a lighted ship far out at\nsea, in darkness, in the rain.\n\nAnd there are songs, old lays and ballads from small islands and from the\nquiet uplands of Havnor, that tell the story of those years.\n\nHavnor Great Port is the city at the heart of the world, white-towered above\nits bay; on the tallest tower the sword of Erreth-Akbe catches the first and\nlast of daylight. Through that city passes all the trade and commerce and\nlearning and craft of Earthsea, a wealth not hoarded. There the King sits,\nhaving returned after the healing of the Ring, in sign of healing. And in that\ncity, in these latter days, men and women of the islands speak with dragons,\nin sign of change.\n\nBut Havnor is also the Great Isle, a broad, rich land; and in the villages\ninland from the port, the farmlands of the slopes of Mount Onn, nothing ever\nchanges much. There a song worth singing is likely to be sung again. There old\nmen at the tavern talk of Morred as if they had known him when they too were\nyoung and heroes. There girls walking out to fetch the cows home tell stories\nof the women of the Hand, who are forgotten everywhere else in the world, even\non Roke, but remembered among those silent, sunlit roads and fields and in the\nkitchens by the hearths where housewives work and talk.\n\nIn the time of the kings, mages gathered in the court of Enlad and later in\nthe court of Havnor to counsel the king and take counsel together, using their\narts to pursue goals they agreed were good. But in the dark years, wizards\nsold their skills to the highest bidder, pitting their powers one against the\nother in duels and combats of sorcery, careless of the evils they did, or\nworse than careless. Plagues and famines, the failure of springs of water,\nsummers with no rain and years with no summer, the birth of sickly and\nmonstrous young to sheep and cattle, the birth of sickly and monstrous\nchildren to the people of the isles-all these things were charged to the\npractices of wizards and witches, and all too often rightly so.\n\nSo it became dangerous to practice sorcery, except under the protection of a\nstrong warlord; and even then, if a wizard met up with one whose powers were\ngreater than his own, he might be destroyed. And if a wizard let down his\nguard among the common folk, they too might destroy him if they could, seeing\nhim as the source of the worst evils they suffered, a malign being. In those\nyears, in the minds of most people, all magic was black.\n\nIt was then that village sorcery, and above all women’s witchery, came into\nthe ill repute that has clung to it since. Witches paid dearly for practicing\nthe arts they thought of as their own. The care of pregnant beasts and women,\nbirthing, teaching the songs and rites, the fertility and order of field and\ngarden, the building and care of the house and its furniture, the mining of\nores and metals-these great things had always been in the charge of women. A\nrich lore of spells and charms to ensure the good outcome of such undertakings\nwas shared among the witches. But when things went wrong at the birth, or in\nthe field, that would be the witches’ fault. And things went wrong more often\nthan right, with the wizards warring, using poisons and curses recklessly to\ngain immediate advantage without thought for what followed after. They brought\ndrought and storm, blights and fires and sicknesses across the land, and the\nvillage witch was punished for them. She didn’t know why her charm of healing\ncaused the wound to gangrene, why the child she brought into the world was\nimbecile, why her blessing seemed to burn the seed in the furrows and blight\nthe apple on the tree. But for these ills, somebody had to be to blame: and\nthe witch or sorcerer was there, right there in the village or the town, not\noff in the warlord’s castle or fort, not protected by armed men and spells of\ndefense. Sorcerers and witches were drowned in the poisoned wells, burned in\nthe withered fields, buried alive to make the dead earth rich again.\n\nSo the practice of their lore and the teaching of it had become perilous.\nThose who undertook it were often those already outcast, crippled, deranged,\nwithout family, old-women and men who had little to lose. The wise man and\nwise woman, trusted and held in reverence, gave way to the stock figures of\nthe shuffling, impotent village sorcerer with his trickeries, the hag-witch\nwith her potions used in aid of lust, jealousy, and malice. And a child’s gift\nfor magic became a thing to dread and hide.\n\nThis is a tale of those times. Some of it is taken from the Book of the Dark,\nand some comes from Havnor, from the upland farms of Onn and the woodlands of\nFaliern. A story may be pieced together from such scraps and fragments, and\nthough it will be an airy quilt, half made of hearsay and half of guesswork,\nyet it may be true enough. It’s a tale of the Founding of Roke, and if the\nMasters of Roke say it didn’t happen so, let them tell us how it happened\notherwise. For a cloud hangs over the time when Roke first became the Isle of\nthe Wise, and it may be that the wise men put it there.\n\nII. Otter\n\n  \n\nThere was an otter in our brook\n\nThat every mortal semblance took,\n\nCould any spell of magic make,\n\nAnd speak the tongues of man and drake.\n\nSo runs the water away, away,\n\nSo runs the water away.\n\n  \n\nOTTER WAS THE SON of a boatwright who worked in the shipyards of Havnor Great\nPort. His mother gave him his country name; she was a farm woman from Endlane\nvillage, around northwest of Mount Onn. She had come to the city seeking work,\nas many came. Decent folk in a decent trade in troubled times, the boatwright\nand his family were anxious not to come to notice lest they come to grief. And\nso, when it became clear that the boy had a gift of magery, his father tried\nto beat it out of him.\n\n“You might as well beat a cloud for raining,” said Otter’s mother.\n\n“Take care you don’t beat evil into him,” said his aunt.\n\n“Take care he doesn’t turn your belt on you with a spell!” said his uncle.\n\nBut the boy played no tricks against his father. He took his beatings in\nsilence and learned to hide his gift.\n\nIt didn’t seem to him to amount to much. It was such an easy matter to him to\nmake a silvery light shine in a dark room, or find a lost pin by thinking\nabout it, or true up a warped joint by running his hands over the wood and\ntalking to it, that he couldn’t see why they made a fuss over such things. But\nhis father raged at him for his “shortcuts,” even struck him once on the mouth\nwhen he was talking to the work, and insisted that he do his carpentry with\ntools, in silence.\n\nHis mother tried to explain. “It’s as if you’d found some great jewel,” she\nsaid, “and what’s one of us to do with a diamond but hide it? Anybody rich\nenough to buy it from you is strong enough to kill you for it. Keep it hid.\nAnd keep away from great people and their crafty men!”\n\n“Crafty men” is what they called wizards in those days.\n\nOne of the gifts of power is to know power. Wizard knows wizard, unless the\nconcealment is very skillful. And the boy had no skills at all except in boat-\nbuilding, of which he was a promising scholar by the age of twelve. About that\ntime the midwife who had helped his mother at his birth came by and said to\nhis parents, “Let Otter come to me in the evenings after work. He should learn\nthe songs and be prepared for his naming day.”\n\nThat was all right, for she had done the same for Otter’s elder sister, and so\nhis parents sent him to her in the evenings. But she taught Otter more than\nthe song of the Creation. She knew his gift. She and some men and women like\nher, people of no fame and some of questionable reputation, had all in some\ndegree that gift; and they shared, in secret, what lore and craft they had. “A\ngift untaught is a ship unguided,” they said to Otter, and they taught him all\nthey knew. It wasn’t much, but there were some beginnings of the great arts in\nit; and though he felt uneasy at deceiving his parents, he couldn’t resist\nthis knowledge, and the kindness and praise of his poor teachers. “It will do\nyou no harm if you never use it for harm,” they told him, and that was easy\nfor him to promise them.\n\nAt the stream Serrenen, where it runs within the north wall of the city, the\nmidwife gave Otter his true name, by which he is remembered in islands far\nfrom Havnor.\n\nAmong these people was an old man whom they called, among themselves, the\nChanger. He showed Otter a few spells of illusion; and when the boy was\nfifteen or so, the old man took him out into the fields by Serrenen to show\nhim the one spell of true change he knew. “First let’s see you turn that bush\ninto the seeming of a tree,” he said, and promptly Otter did so. Illusion came\nso easy to the boy that the old man took alarm. Otter had to beg and wheedle\nhim for any further teaching and finally to promise him, swearing on his own\ntrue and secret name, that if he learned the Changer’s great spell he would\nnever use it but to save a life, his own or another’s.\n\nThen the old man taught it to him. But it wasn’t much use, Otter thought,\nsince he had to hide it.\n\nWhat he learned working with his father and uncle in the shipyard he could\nuse, at least; and he was becoming a good craftsman, even his father would\nadmit that.\n\nLosen, a sea-pirate who called himself King of the Inmost Sea, was then the\nchief warlord in the city and all the east and south of Havnor. Exacting\ntribute from that rich domain, he spent it to increase his soldiery and the\nfleets he sent out to take slaves and plunder from other lands. As Otters\nuncle said, he kept the shipwrights busy. They were grateful to have work in a\ntime when men seeking work found only beggary, and rats ran in the courts of\nMaharion. They did an honest job, Otter’s father said, and what the work was\nused for was none of their concern.\n\nBut the other learning he had been given had made Otter touchy in these\nmatters, delicate of conscience. The big galley they were building now would\nbe rowed to war by Losen’s slaves and would bring back slaves as cargo. It\ngalled him to think of the good ship in that vicious usage. “Why can’t we\nbuild fishing boats, the way we used to?” he asked, and his father said,\n“Because the fishermen can’t pay us.”\n\n“Can’t pay us as well as Losen does. But we could live,” Otter argued.\n\n“You think I can turn the King’s order down? You want to see me sent to row\nwith the slaves in the galley we’re building? Use your head, boy!”\n\nSo Otter worked along with them with a clear head and an angry heart. They\nwere in a trap. What’s the use of a gift of power, he thought, if not to get\nout of a trap?\n\nHis conscience as a craftsman would not let him fault the carpentry of the\nship in any way; but his conscience as a wizard told him he could put a hex on\nher, a curse woven right into her beams and hull. Surely that was using the\nsecret art to a good end? For harm, yes, but only to harm the harmful. He did\nnot talk to his teachers about it. If he was doing wrong, it was none of their\nfault and they would know nothing about it. He thought about it for a long\ntime, working out how to do it, making the spell very carefully. It was the\nreversal of a finding charm: a losing charm, he called it to himself. The ship\nwould float, and handle well, and steer, but she would never steer quite true.\n\nIt was the best he could do in protest against the misuse of good work and a\ngood ship. He was pleased with himself. When the ship was launched (and all\nseemed well with her, for her fault would not show up until she was out on the\nopen sea) he could not keep from his teachers what he had done, the little\ncircle of old men and midwives, the young hunchback who could speak with the\ndead, the blind girl who knew the names of things. He told them his trick, and\nthe blind girl laughed, but the old people said, “Look out. Take care. Keep\nhidden.”\n\nIn Losen’s service was a man who called himself Hound, because, as he said, he\nhad a nose for witchery. His employment was to sniff Losen’s food and drink\nand garments and women, anything that might be used by enemy wizards against\nhim; and also to inspect his warships. A ship is a fragile thing in a\ndangerous element, vulnerable to spells and hexes. As soon as Hound came\naboard the new galley he scented something. “Well, well,” he said, “who’s\nthis?” He walked to the helm and put his hand on it. “This is clever,” he\nsaid. “But who is it? A newcomer, I think.” He sniffed appreciatively. “Very\nclever,” he said.\n\nThey came to the house in Boatwright Street after dark. They kicked the door\nin, and Hound, standing among the armed and armored men, said, “Him. Let the\nothers be.” And to Otter he said, “Don’t move,” in a low, amicable voice. He\nsensed great power in the young man, enough that he was a little afraid of\nhim. But Otter’s distress was too great and his training too slight for him to\nthink of using magic to free himself or stop the men’s brutality. He flung\nhimself at them and fought them like an animal till they knocked him on the\nhead. They broke Otter’s father’s jaw and beat his aunt and mother senseless\nto teach them not to bring up crafty men. Then they carried Otter away.\n\nNot a door opened in the narrow street. Nobody looked out to see what the\nnoise was. Not till long after the men were gone did some neighbors creep out\nto comfort Otter’s people as best they could. “Oh, it’s a curse, a curse, this\nwizardry!” they said.\n\nHound told his master that they had the hexer in a safe place, and Losen said,\n“Who was he working for?”\n\n“He worked in your shipyard, your highness.” Losen liked to be called by\nkingly titles.\n\n“Who hired him to hex the ship, fool?”\n\n“It seems it was his own idea, your majesty.”\n\n“Why? What was he going to get out of it?”\n\nHound shrugged. He didn’t choose to tell Losen that people hated him\ndisinterestedly.\n\n“He’s crafty, you say. Can you use him?”\n\n“I can try, your highness.”\n\n“Tame him or bury him,” said Losen, and turned to more important matters.\n\n  \n\nOtter’s humble teachers had taught him pride. They had trained into him a deep\ncontempt for wizards who worked for such men as Losen, letting fear or greed\npervert magic to evil ends. Nothing, to his mind, could be more despicable\nthan such a betrayal of their art. So it troubled him that he couldn’t despise\nHound.\n\nHe had been stowed in a storeroom of one of the old palaces that Losen had\nappropriated. It had no window, its door was cross-grained oak barred with\niron, and spells had been laid on that door that would have kept a far more\nexperienced wizard captive. There were men of great skill and power in Losen’s\npay. Hound did not consider himself to be one of them. “All I have is a nose,”\nhe said. He came daily to see that Otter was recovering from his concussion\nand dislocated shoulder, and to talk with him. He was, as far as Otter could\nsee, well-meaning and honest. “If you won’t work for us they’ll kill you,” he\nsaid. “Losen can’t have fellows like you on the loose. You’d better hire on\nwhile he’ll take you.”\n\n“I can’t.”\n\nOtter stated it as an unfortunate fact, not as a moral assertion. Hound looked\nat him with appreciation. Living with the pirate king, he was sick of boasts\nand threats, of boasters and threateners.\n\n“What are you strongest in?”\n\nOtter was reluctant to answer. He had to like Hound, but didn’t have to trust\nhim. “Shape-changing,” he mumbled at last.\n\n“Shape-taking?”\n\n“No. Just tricks. Turn a leaf to a gold piece. Seemingly.”\n\nIn those days they had no fixed names for the various kinds and arts of magic,\nnor were the connections among those arts clear. There was-as the wise men of\nRoke would say later-no science in what they knew. But Hound knew pretty\nsurely that his prisoner was concealing his talents.\n\n“Can’t change your own form, even seemingly?”\n\nOtter shrugged.\n\nIt was hard for him to lie. He thought he was awkward at it because he had no\npractice. Hound knew better. He knew that magic itself resists untruth.\nConjuring, sleight of hand, and false commerce with the dead are counterfeits\nof magic, glass to the diamond, brass to the gold. They are fraud, and lies\nflourish in that soil. But the art of magic, though it may be used for false\nends, deals with what is real, and the words it works with are the true words.\nSo true wizards find it hard to lie about their art. In their heart they know\nthat their lie, spoken, may change the world.\n\nHound was sorry for him. “You know, if it was Gelluk questioning you, he’d\nhave everything you know out of you just with a word or two, and your wits\nwith it. I’ve seen what old Whiteface leaves behind when he asks questions.\nListen, can you work with the wind at all?”\n\nOtter hesitated and said, “Yes.”\n\n“D’you have a bag?”\n\nWeatherworkers used to carry a leather sack in which they said they kept the\nwinds, untying it to let a fair wind loose or to capture a contrary one. Maybe\nit was only for show, but every weatherworker had a bag, a great long sack or\na little pouch.\n\n“At home,” Otter said. It wasn’t a lie. He did have a pouch at home. He kept\nhis fine-work tools and his bubble level in it. And he wasn’t altogether lying\nabout the wind. Several times he had managed to bring a bit of magewind into\nthe sail of a boat, though he had no idea how to combat or control a storm, as\na ship’s weatherworker must do. But he thought he’d rather drown in a gale\nthan be murdered in this hole.\n\n“But you wouldn’t be willing to use that skill in the King’s service?”\n\n“There is no king in Earthsea,” the young man said, stern and righteous, “In\nmy master’s service, then,” Hound amended, patient.\n\n“No,” Otter said, and hesitated. He felt he owed this man an explanation.\n“See, it’s not so much won’t as can’t. I thought of making plugs in the\nplanking of that galley, near the keel-you know what I mean by plugs? They’d\nwork out as the timbers work when she gets in a heavy sea.” Hound nodded. “But\nI couldn’t do it. I’m a shipbuilder. I can’t build a ship to sink. With the\nmen aboard her. My hands wouldn’t do it. So I did what I could. I made her go\nher own way. Not his way.”\n\nHound smiled. “They haven’t undone what you did yet, either,” he said. “Old\nWhiteface was crawling all over her yesterday, growling and muttering. Ordered\nthe helm replaced.” He meant Losen’s chief mage, a pale man from the North\nnamed Gelluk, who was much feared in Havnor.\n\n“That won’t do it.”\n\n“Could you undo the spell you put on her?”\n\nA flicker of complacency showed in Otters tired, battered young face. “No,” he\nsaid. “I don’t think anybody can.”\n\n“Too bad. You might have used that to bargain with.”\n\nOtter said nothing.\n\n“A nose, now, is a useful thing, a salable thing,” Hound went on. “Not that\nI’m looking for competition. But a finder can always find work, as they\nsay...You ever been in a mine?”\n\nThe guesswork of a wizard is close to knowledge, though he may not know what\nit is he knows. The first sign of Otter’s gift, when he was two or three years\nold, was his ability to go straight to anything lost, a dropped nail, a\nmislaid tool, as soon as he understood the word for it. And as a boy one of\nhis dearest pleasures had been to go alone out into the countryside and wander\nalong the lanes or over the hills, feeling through the soles of his bare feet\nand throughout his body the veins of water underground, the lodes and knots of\nore, the lay and interfolding of the kinds of rock and earth. It was as if he\nwalked in a great building, seeing its passages and rooms, the descents to\nairy caverns, the glimmer of branched silver in the walls; and as he went on,\nit was as if his body became the body of earth, and he knew its arteries and\norgans and muscles as his own. This power had been a delight to him as a boy.\nHe had never sought any use for it. It had been his secret.\n\nHe did not answer Hound’s question.\n\n“What’s below us?” Hound pointed to the floor, paved with rough slate flags.\n\nOtter was silent a while. Then he said in a low voice, “Clay, and gravel, and\nunder that the rock that bears garnets. All under this part of the city is\nthat rock. I don’t know the names.”\n\n“You can learn em.”\n\n“I know how to build boats, how to sail boats.”\n\n“You’ll do better away from the ships, all the fighting and raiding. The\nKing’s working the old mines at Samory, round the mountain. There you’d be out\nof his way. Work for him you must, if you want to stay alive. I’ll see that\nyou’re sent there. If you’ll go.”\n\nAfter a little silence Otter said, “Thanks.” And he looked up at Hound, one\nbrief, questioning, judging glance.\n\nHound had taken him, had stood and seen his people beaten senseless, had not\nstopped the beating. Yet he spoke as a friend. Why? said Otter’s look. Hound\nanswered it.\n\n“Crafty men need to stick together,” he said. “Men who have no art at all,\nnothing but wealth-they pit us one against the other, for their gain not ours.\nWe sell em our power. Why do we? If we went our own way together, we’d do\nbetter, maybe.”\n\nHound meant well in sending the young man to Samory, but he did not understand\nthe quality of Otter’s will. Nor did Otter himself. He was too used to obeying\nothers to see that in fact he had always followed his own bent, and too young\nto believe that anything he did could kill him.\n\nHe planned, as soon as they took him out of his cell, to use the old Changers\nspell of self-transformation and so escape. Surely his life was in danger, and\nit would be all right to use the spell? Only he couldn’t decide what to turn\nhimself into-a bird, or a wisp of smoke, what would be safest? But while he\nwas thinking about it, Losen’s men, used to wizard’s tricks, drugged his food\nand he ceased to think of anything at all. They dumped him into a mule-cart\nlike a sack of oats. When he showed signs of reviving during the journey, one\nof them bashed him on the head, remarking that he wanted to make sure he got\nhis rest.\n\nWhen he came to himself, sick and weak from the poison and with an aching\nskull, he was in a room with brick walls and bricked-up windows. The door had\nno bars and no visible lock. But when he tried to get to his feet he felt\nbonds of sorcery holding his body and mind, resilient, clinging, tightening as\nhe moved. He could stand, but could not take a step towards the door. He could\nnot even reach his hand out. It was a horrible sensation, as if his muscles\nwere not his own. He sat down again and tried to hold still. The spellbonds\naround his chest kept him from breathing deeply, and his mind felt stifled\ntoo, as if his thoughts were crowded into a space too small for them.\n\nAfter a long time the door opened and several men came in. He could do nothing\nagainst them as they gagged him and bound his arms behind him. “Now you won’t\nweave charms nor speak spells, young’un,” said a broad, strong man with a\nfurrowed face, “but you can nod your head well enough, right? They sent you\nhere as a dowser. If you’re a good dowser you’ll feed well and sleep easy.\nCinnabar, that’s what you’re to nod for. The King’s wizard says it’s still\nhere somewhere about these old mines. And he wants it. So it’s best for us\nthat we find it. Now I’ll walk you out. It’s like I’m the water finder and\nyou’re my wand, see? You lead on. And if you want to go this way or that way\nyou dip your head, so. And when you know there’s ore underfoot, you stamp on\nthe place, so. Now that’s the bargain, right? And if you play fair I will.”\n\nHe waited for Otter to nod, but Otter stood motionless.\n\n“Sulk away,” the man said. “If you don’t like this work, there’s always the\nroaster.”\n\nThe man, whom the others called Licky, led him out into a hot, bright morning\nthat dazzled his eyes. Leaving his cell he had felt the spellbonds loosen and\nfall away, but there were other spells woven about other buildings of the\nplace, especially around a tall stone tower, filling the air with sticky lines\nof resistance and repulsion. If he tried to push forward into them his face\nand belly stung with jabs of agony, so that he looked at his body in horror\nfor the wound; but there was no wound. Gagged and bound, without his voice and\nhands to work magic, he could do nothing against these spells. Licky had tied\none end of a braided leather cord around his neck and held the other end,\nfollowing him. He let Otter walk into a couple of the spells, and after that\nOtter avoided them. Where they were was plain enough: the dusty pathways bent\nto miss them.\n\nLeashed like a dog, he walked along, sullen and shivering with sickness and\nrage. He stared around him, seeing the stone tower, stacks of wood by its wide\ndoorway, rusty wheels and machines by a pit, great heaps of gravel and clay.\nTurning his sore head made him dizzy.\n\n“If you’re a dowser, better dowse,” said Licky, coming up alongside him and\nlooking sidelong into his face. “And if you’re not, you’d better dowse all the\nsame. That way you’ll stay above ground longer.”\n\nA man came out of the stone tower. He passed them, walking hurriedly with a\nqueer shambling gait, staring straight ahead. His chin shone and his chest was\nwet with spittle leaking from his lips.\n\n“That’s the roaster tower,” said Licky. “Where they cook the cinnabar to get\nthe metal from it. Roasters die in a year or two. Where to, dowser?”\n\nAfter a bit Otter nodded left, away from the grey stone tower. They walked on\ntowards a long, treeless valley, past grass-grown dumps and tailings.\n\n“All under here’s worked out long since” Licky said. And Otter had begun to be\naware of the strange country under his feet: empty shafts and rooms of dark\nair in the dark earth, a vertical labyrinth, the deepest pits filled with\nunmoving water. “Never was much silver, and the watermetal’s long gone.\nListen, young’un, do you even know what cinnabar is?”\n\nOtter shook his head.\n\n“I’ll show you some. That’s what Gelluk’s after. The ore of watermetal.\nWatermetal eats all the other metals, even gold, see.\n\n. So he calls it the King. If you find him his King, he’ll treat you well.\nHe’s often here. Come on, I’ll show you. Dog can’t track till he’s had the\nscent.”\n\nLicky took him down into the mines to show him the gangues, the kinds of earth\nthe ore was likely to occur in. A few miners were working at the end of a long\nlevel.\n\nBecause they were smaller than men and could move more easily in narrow\nplaces, or because they were at home with the earth, or most likely because it\nwas the custom, women had always worked the mines of Earthsea. These miners\nwere free women, not slaves like the workers in the roaster tower. Gelluk had\nmade him foreman over the miners, Licky said, but he did no work in the mine;\nthe miners forbade it, earnestly believing it was the worst of bad luck for a\nman to pick up a shovel or shore a timber. “Suits me,” Licky said.\n\nA shock-haired, bright-eyed woman with a candle bound to her forehead set down\nher pick to show Otter a little cinnabar in a bucket, brownish red clots and\ncrumbs. Shadows leapt across the earth face at which the miners worked. Old\ntimbers creaked, dirt sifted down. Though the air ran cool through the\ndarkness, the drifts and levels were so low and narrow the miners had to stoop\nand squeeze their way. In places the ceilings had collapsed. Ladders were\nshaky. The mine was a terrifying place; yet Otter felt a sense of shelter in\nit. He was half sorry to go back up into the burning day.\n\nLicky did not take him into the roaster tower, but back to the barracks. From\na locked room he brought out a small, soft, thick, leather bag that weighed\nheavy in his hands. He opened it to show Otter the little pool of dusty\nbrilliance lying in it. When he closed the bag the metal moved in it, bulging,\npressing, like an animal trying to get free.\n\n“There’s the King,” Licky said, in a tone that might have been reverence or\nhatred.\n\nThough not a sorcerer, Licky was a much more formidable man than Hound. Yet\nlike Hound he was brutal not cruel. He demanded obedience, but nothing else.\nOtter had seen slaves and their masters all his life in the shipyards of\nHavnor, and knew he was fortunate. At least in daylight, when Licky was his\nmaster.\n\nHe could eat only in the cell, where they took his gag off. Bread and onions\nwere what they gave him, with a slop of rancid oil on the bread. Hungry as he\nwas every night, when he sat in that room with the spellbonds upon him he\ncould hardly swallow the food. It tasted of metal, of ash. The nights were\nlong and terrible, for the spells pressed on him, weighed on him, waked him\nover and over terrified, gasping for breath, and never able to think\ncoherently. It was utterly dark, for he could not make the werelight shine in\nthat room. The day came unspeakably welcome, even though it meant he would\nhave his hands tied behind him and his mouth gagged and a leash buckled round\nhis neck.\n\nLicky walked him out early every morning, and often they wandered about till\nlate afternoon. Licky was silent and patient.\n\nHe did not ask if Otter was picking up any sign of the ore; he did not ask\nwhether he was seeking the ore or pretending to seek it. Otter himself could\nnot have answered the question. In these aimless wanderings the knowledge of\nthe underground would enter him as it used to do, and he would try to close\nhimself off to it. “I will not work in the service of evil!” he told himself.\nThen the summer air and light would soften him, and his tough, bare soles\nwould feel the dry grass under them, and he would know that under the roots of\nthe grass a stream crept through dark earth, seeping over a wide ledge of rock\nlayered with sheets of mica, and under that ledge was a cavern, and in its\nwalls were thin, crimson, crumbling beds of cinnabar... He made no sign. He\nthought that maybe the map of the earth underfoot that was forming in his mind\ncould be put to some good use, if he could find how to do it.\n\nBut after ten days or so, Licky said, “Master Gelluk’s coming here. If there’s\nno ore for him, he’ll likely find another dowser.”\n\nOtter walked on a mile, brooding; then circled back, leading Licky to a\nhillock not far from the far end of the old workings. There he nodded downward\nand stamped his foot.\n\nBack in the cell room, when Licky had unleashed him and untied his gag, he\nsaid, “There’s some ore there. You can get to it by running that old tunnel\nstraight on, maybe twenty feet.”\n\n“A good bit of it?”\n\nOtter shrugged.\n\n“Just enough to keep going on, eh?”\n\nOtter said nothing.\n\n“Suits me,” said Licky.\n\nTwo days later, when they had reopened the old shaft and begun digging towards\nthe ore, the wizard arrived. Licky had left Otter outside sitting in the sun\nrather than in the room in the barracks. Otter was grateful to him. He could\nnot be wholly comfortable with his hands bound and his mouth gagged, but wind\nand sunlight were mighty blessings. And he could breathe deep and doze without\ndreams of earth stopping his mouth and nostrils, the only dreams he ever had,\nnights in the cell.\n\nHe was half asleep, sitting on the ground in the shade by the barracks, the\nsmell of the logs stacked by the roaster tower bringing him a memory of the\nwork yards at home, the fragrance of new wood as the plane ran down the silky\noak board. Some noise or movement roused him. He looked up and saw the wizard\nstanding before him, looming above him.\n\nGelluk wore fantastic clothes, as many of his kind did in those days. A long\nrobe of Lorbanery silk, scarlet, embroidered in gold and black with runes and\nsymbols, and a wide-brimmed, peak-crowned hat made him seem taller than a man\ncould be. Otter did not need to see his clothes to know him. He knew the hand\nthat had woven his bonds and cursed his nights, the acid taste and choking\ngrip of that power.\n\n“I think I’ve found my little finder,” said Gelluk. His voice was deep and\nsoft, like the notes of a viol. “Sleeping in the sunshine, like one whose work\nhas been well done. So you’ve sent them digging for the Red Mother, have you?\nDid you know the Red Mother before you came here? Are you a courtier of the\nKing? Here, now, there’s no need for ropes and knots.” Where he stood, with a\nflick of his finger, he untied Otter’s wrists, and the gagging kerchief fell\nloose.\n\n“I could teach you how to do that for yourself,” the wizard said, smiling,\nwatching Otter rub and flex his aching wrists and work his lips that had been\nsmashed against his teeth for hours. “The Hound told me that you’re a lad of\npromise and might go far with a proper guide. If you’d like to visit the Court\nof the King, I can take you there. But maybe you don’t know the King I’m\ntalking of?”\n\nIndeed Otter was unsure whether the wizard meant the pirate or the\nquicksilver, but he risked a guess and made one quick gesture toward the stone\ntower.\n\nThe wizard’s eyes narrowed and his smile broadened.\n\n“Do you know his name?”\n\n“The watermetal,” Otter said.\n\n“So the vulgar call it, or quicksilver, or the water of weight. But those who\nserve him call him the King, and the Allking, and the Body of the Moon.” His\ngaze, benevolent and inquisitive, passed over Otter and to the tower, and then\nback. His face was large and long, whiter than any face Otter had seen, with\nbluish eyes. Grey and black hairs curled here and there on his chin and\ncheeks. His calm, open smile showed small teeth, several of them missing.\n“Those who have learned to see truly can see him as he is, the lord of all\nsubstances. The root of power lies in him. Do you know what we call him in the\nsecrecy of his palace?”\n\nThe tall man in his tall hat suddenly sat down on the dirt beside Otter, quite\nclose to him. His breath smelled earthy. His light eyes gazed directly into\nOtter’s eyes. “Would you like to know? You can know anything you like. I need\nhave no secrets from you. Nor you from me,” and he laughed, not threateningly,\nbut with pleasure. He gazed at Otter again, his large, white face smooth and\nthoughtful. “Powers you have, yes, all kinds of little traits and tricks. A\nclever lad. But not too clever; that’s good. Not too clever to learn, like\nsome... I’ll teach you, if you like. Do you like learning? Do you like\nknowledge? Would you like to know the name we call the King when he’s all\nalone in his brightness in his courts of stone? His name is Turres. Do you\nknow that name? It’s a word in the language of the Allking. His own name in\nhis own language. In our base tongue we would say Semen.” He smiled again and\npatted Otter’s hand. “For he is the seed and fructifier. The seed and source\nof might and right. You’ll see. You’ll see. Come along! Come along! Let’s go\nsee the King flying among his subjects, gathering himself from them!” And he\nstood up, supple and sudden, taking Otter’s hand in his and pulling him to his\nfeet with startling strength. He was laughing with excitement.\n\nOtter felt as if he were being brought back to vivid life from interminable,\ndreary, dazed half sentience. At the wizards touch he did not feel the horror\nof the spellbond, but rather a gift of energy and hope. He told himself not to\ntrust this man, but he longed to trust him, to learn from him. Gelluk was\npowerful, masterful, strange, yet he had set him free. For the first time in\nweeks Otter walked with unbound hands and no spell on him.\n\n“This way, this way,” Gelluk murmured. “No harm will come to you.” They came\nto the doorway of the roaster tower, a narrow passage in the three-foot-thick\nwalls. He took Otter’s arm, for the young man hesitated.\n\nLicky had told him that it was the fumes of the metal rising from heated ore\nthat sickened and killed the people who worked in the tower. Otter had never\nentered it nor seen Licky enter it. He had come close enough to know that it\nwas surrounded by prisoning spells that would sting and bewilder and entangle\na slave trying to escape. Now he felt those spells like strands of cobweb,\nropes of dark mist, giving way to the wizard who had made them.\n\n“Breathe, breathe, breathe,” Gelluk said, laughing, and Otter tried not to\nhold his breath as they entered the tower.\n\nThe roasting pit took up the center of a huge domed chamber. Hurrying,\nsticklike figures black against the blaze shoveled and reshoveled ore onto\nlogs kept in a roaring blaze by great bellows, while others brought fresh logs\nand worked the bellows sleeves. From the apex of the dome a spiral of chambers\nrose up into the tower through smoke and fumes. In those chambers, Licky had\ntold him, the vapor of the quicksilver was trapped and condensed, reheated and\nrecondensed, till in the topmost vault the pure metal ran down into a stone\ntrough or bowl-only a drop or two a day, he said, from the low-grade ores they\nwere roasting now.\n\n“Don’t be afraid,” Gelluk said, his voice strong and musical over the panting\ngasp of the huge bellows and the steady roar of the fire. “Come, come see how\nhe flies in the air, making himself pure, making his subjects pure!” He drew\nOtter to the edge of the roasting pit. His eyes shone in the flare and dazzle\nof the flames. “Evil spirits that work for the King become clean,” he said,\nhis lips close to Otter’s ear. “As they slaver, the dross and stains flow out\nof them. Illness and impurities fester and run free from their sores. And then\nwhen they’re burned clean at last they can fly up, fly up into the Courts of\nthe King. Come along, come along, up into his tower, where the dark night\nbrings forth the moon!”\n\nAfter him Otter climbed the winding stairs, broad at first but growing tight\nand narrow, passing vapor chambers with red-hot ovens whose vents led up to\nrefining rooms where the soot from the burnt ore was scraped down by naked\nslaves and shoveled into ovens to be burnt again. They came to the topmost\nroom. Gelluk said to the single slave crouching at the rim of the shaft, “Show\nme the King!”\n\nThe slave, short and thin, hairless, with running sores on his hands and arms,\nuncapped a stone cup by the rim of the condensing shaft. Gelluk peered in,\neager as a child. “So tiny,” he murmured. “So young. The tiny Prince, the baby\nLord, Lord Turres. Seed of the world! Soul-jewel!”\n\nFrom the breast of his robe he took a pouch of fine leather decorated with\nsilver threads. With a delicate horn spoon tied to the pouch he lifted the few\ndrops of quicksilver from the cup and placed them in it, then retied the\nthong.\n\nThe slave stood by, motionless. All the people who worked in the heat and\nfumes of the roaster tower were naked or wore only breechclout and moccasins.\nOtter glanced again at the slave, thinking by his height he was a child, and\nthen saw the small breasts. It was a woman. She was bald. Her joints were\nswollen knobs in her bone-thin limbs. She looked up once at Otter, moving her\neyes only. She spat into the fire, wiped her sore mouth with her hand, and\nstood motionless again.\n\n“That’s right, little servant, well done,” Gelluk said to her in his tender\nvoice. “Give your dross to the fire and it will be transformed into the living\nsilver, the light of the moon. Is it not a wonderful thing,” he went on,\ndrawing Otter away and back down the spiral stair, “how from what is most base\ncomes what is most noble? That is a great principle of the art! From the vile\nRed Mother is born the Allking. From the spittle of a dying slave is made the\nsilver Seed of Power.”\n\nAll the way down the spinning, reeking stone stairs he talked, and Otter tried\nto understand, because this was a man of power telling him what power was.\n\nBut when they came out into the daylight again his head kept on spinning in\nthe dark, and after a few steps he doubled over and vomited on the ground.\n\nGelluk watched him with his inquisitive, affectionate look, and when Otter\nstood up, wincing and gasping, the wizard asked gently, “Are you afraid of the\nKing?”\n\nOtter nodded.\n\n“If you share his power he won’t harm you. To fear a power, to fight a power,\nis very dangerous. To love power and to share it is the royal way. Look. Watch\nwhat I do.” Gelluk held up the pouch into which he had put the few drops of\nquicksilver. His eye always on Otter’s eye, he unsealed the pouch, lifted it\nto his lips, and drank its contents. He opened his smiling mouth so that Otter\ncould see the silver drops pooling on his tongue before he swallowed.\n\n“Now the King is in my body, the noble guest of my house. He won’t make me\nslaver and vomit or cause sores on my body; no, for I don’t fear him, but\ninvite him, and so he enters into my veins and arteries. No harm comes to me.\nMy blood runs silver. I see things unknown to other men. I share the secrets\nof the King. And when he leaves me, he hides in the place of ordure, in\nfoulness itself, and yet again in the vile place he waits for me to come and\ntake him up and cleanse him as he cleansed me, so that each time we grow purer\ntogether.” The wizard took Otter’s arm and walked along with him. He said,\nsmiling and confidential, “I am one who shits moonlight. You will not know\nanother such. And more than that, more than that, the King enters into my\nseed. He is my semen. I am Turres and he is me...”\n\nIn the confusion of Otter’s mind, he was only dimly aware that they were going\nnow towards the entrance of the mine. They went underground. The passages of\nthe mine were a dark maze like the wizard’s words. Otter stumbled on, trying\nto understand. He saw the slave in the tower, the woman who had looked at him.\nHe saw her eyes.\n\nThey walked without light except for the faint werelight Gelluk sent before\nthem. They went through long-disused levels, yet the wizard seemed to know\nevery step, or perhaps he did not know the way and was wandering without heed.\nHe talked, turning sometimes to Otter to guide him or warn him, then going on,\ntalking on.\n\nThey came to where the miners were extending the old tunnel. There the wizard\nspoke with Licky in the flare of candles among jagged shadows. He touched the\nearth of the tunnel’s end, took clods of earth in his hands, rolled the dirt\nin his palms, kneading, testing, tasting it. For that time he was silent, and\nOtter watched him with staring intensity, still trying to understand.\n\nLicky came back to the barracks with them. Gelluk bade Otter goodnight in his\nsoft voice. Licky shut him as usual into the brick-walled room, giving him a\nloaf of bread, an onion, a jug of water.\n\nOtter crouched as always in the uneasy oppression of the spellbond. He drank\nthirstily. The sharp earthy taste of the onion was good, and he ate it all.\n\nAs the dim light that came into the room from chinks in the mortar of the\nbricked-up window died away, instead of sinking into the blank misery of all\nhis nights in that room, he stayed awake, and grew more awake. The excited\nturmoil of his mind all the time he had been with Gelluk slowly quieted. From\nit something rose, coming close, coming clear, the image he had seen down in\nthe mine, shadowy yet distinct: the slave in the high vault of the tower, that\nwoman with empty breasts and festered eyes, who spat the spittle that ran from\nher poisoned mouth, and wiped her mouth, and stood waiting to die. She had\nlooked at him.\n\nHe saw her now more clearly than he had seen her in the tower. He saw her more\nclearly than he had ever seen anyone. He saw the thin arms, the swollen joints\nof elbow and wrist, the childish nape of her neck. It was as if she was with\nhim in the room. It was as if she was in him, as if she was him. She looked at\nhim. He saw her look at him. He saw himself through her eyes.\n\nHe saw the lines of the spells that held him, heavy cords of darkness, a\ntangled maze of lines all about him. There was a way out of the knot, if he\nturned around so, and then so, and parted the lines with his hands, so; and he\nwas free.\n\nHe could not see the woman any more. He was alone in the room, standing free.\n\nAll the thoughts he had not been able to think for days and weeks were racing\nthrough his head, a storm of ideas and feelings, a passion of rage, vengeance,\npity, pride.\n\nAt first he was overwhelmed with fierce fantasies of power and revenge: he\nwould free the slaves, he would spellbind Gelluk and hurl him into the\nrefining fire, he would bind him and blind him and leave him to breathe the\nfumes of quicksilver in that highest vault till he died... But when his\nthoughts settled down and began to run clearer, he knew that he could not\ndefeat a wizard of great craft and power, even if that wizard was mad. If he\nhad any hope it was to play on his madness, and lead the wizard to defeat\nhimself.\n\nHe pondered. All the time he was with Gelluk, he had tried to learn from him,\ntried to understand what the wizard was telling him. Yet he was certain, now,\nthat Gelluk’s ideas, the teaching he so eagerly imparted, had nothing to do\nwith his power or with any true power. Mining and refining were indeed great\ncrafts with their own mysteries and masteries, but Gelluk seemed to know\nnothing of those arts. His talk of the Allking and the Red Mother was mere\nwords. And not the right words. But how did Otter know that?\n\nIn all his flood of talk the only word Gelluk had spoken in the Old Tongue,\nthe language of which wizards’ spells were made, was the word turres. He had\nsaid it meant semen. Otter’s own gift of magery had recognized that meaning as\nthe true one. Gelluk had said the word also meant quicksilver, and Otter knew\nhe was wrong.\n\nHis humble teachers had taught him all the words they knew of the Language of\nthe Making. Among them had been neither the name of semen nor the name of\nquicksilver. But his lips parted, his tongue moved. “Ayezur” he said.\n\nHis voice was the voice of the slave in the stone tower. It was she who knew\nthe true name of quicksilver and spoke it through him.\n\nThen for a while he held still, body and mind, beginning to understand for the\nfirst time where his power lay.\n\nHe stood in the locked room in the dark and knew he would go free, because he\nwas already free. A storm of praise ran through him.\n\nAfter a while, deliberately, he re-entered the trap of spell-bonds, went back\nto his old place, sat down on the pallet, and went on thinking. The prisoning\nspell was still there, yet it had no power over him now. He could walk into it\nand out of it as if it were mere lines painted on the floor. Gratitude for\nthis freedom beat in him as steady as his heartbeat.\n\nHe thought what he must do, and how he must do it. He wasn’t sure whether he\nhad summoned her or she had come of her own will; he didn’t know how she had\nspoken the word of the Old Tongue to him or through him. He didn’t know what\nhe was doing, or what she was doing, and he was almost certain that the\nworking of any spell would rouse Gelluk. But at last, rashly, and in dread,\nfor such spells were a mere rumor among those who had taught him his sorcery,\nhe summoned the woman in the stone tower.\n\nHe brought her into his mind and saw her as he had seen her, there, in that\nroom, and called out to her; and she came.\n\nHer apparition stood again just outside the spiderweb cords of the spell,\ngazing at him, and seeing him, for a soft, bluish, sourceless light filled the\nroom. Her sore, raw lips quivered but she did not speak.\n\nHe spoke, giving her his true name: “I am Medra.”\n\n“I am Anieb,” she whispered.\n\n“How can we get free?”\n\n“His name.”\n\n“Even if I knew it... When I’m with him I can’t speak.”\n\n“If I was with you, I could use it.”\n\n“I can’t call you.”\n\n“But I can come,” she said.\n\nShe looked round, and he looked up. Both knew that Gelluk had sensed\nsomething, had wakened. Otter felt the bonds close and tighten, and the old\nshadow fall.\n\n“I will come, Medra,” she said. She held out her thin hand in a fist, then\nopened it palm up as if offering him something. Then she was gone.\n\nThe light went with her. He was alone in the dark. The cold grip of the spells\ntook him by the throat and choked him, bound his hands, pressed on his lungs.\nHe crouched, gasping. He could not think; he could not remember. “Stay with\nme,” he said, and did not know who he spoke to. He was frightened, and did not\nknow what he was frightened of. The wizard, the power, the spell... It was all\ndarkness. But in his body, not in his mind, burned a knowledge he could not\nname any more, a certainty that was like a tiny lamp held in his hands in a\nmaze of caverns underground. He kept his eyes on that seed of light.\n\nWeary, evil dreams of suffocation came to him, but took no hold on him. He\nbreathed deep. He slept at last. He dreamed of long mountainsides veiled by\nrain, and the light shining through the rain. He dreamed of clouds passing\nover the shores of islands, and a high, round, green hill that stood in mist\nand sunlight at the end of the sea.\n\nThe wizard who called himself Gelluk and the pirate who called himself King\nLosen had worked together for years, each supporting and increasing the\nother’s power, each in the belief that the other was his servant.\n\nGelluk was sure that without him Losen’s rubbishy kingdom would soon collapse\nand some enemy mage would rub out its king with half a spell. But he let Losen\nact the master. The pirate was a convenience to the wizard, who had got used\nto having his wants provided, his time free, and an endless supply of slaves\nfor his needs and experiments. It was easy to keep up the protections he had\nlaid on Losen’s person and expeditions and forays, the prisoning spells he had\nlaid on the places slaves worked or treasures were kept. Making those spells\nhad been a different matter, a long hard work. But they were in place now, and\nthere wasn’t a wizard in all Havnor who could undo them.\n\nGelluk had never met a man he feared. A few wizards had crossed his path\nstrong enough to make him wary of them, but he had never known one with skill\nand power equal to his own.\n\nOf late, entering always deeper into the mysteries of a certain lore-book\nbrought back from the Isle of Way by one of Losen’s raiders, Gelluk had become\nindifferent to most of the arts he had learned or had discovered for himself.\nThe book convinced him that all of them were only shadows or hints of a\ngreater mastery. As one true element controlled all substances, one true\nknowledge contained all others. Approaching ever closer to that mastery, he\nunderstood that the crafts of wizards were as crude and false as Losen’s title\nand rule. When he was one with the true element, he would be the one true\nking. Alone among men he would speak the words of making and unmaking. He\nwould have dragons for his dogs.\n\nIn the young dowser he recognized a power, untaught and inept, which he could\nuse. He needed much more quicksilver than he had, therefore he needed a\nfinder. Finding was a base skill. Gelluk had never practiced it, but he could\nsee that the young fellow had the gift. He would do well to learn the boy’s\ntrue name so that he could be sure of controlling him. He sighed at the\nthought of the time he must waste teaching the boy what he was good for. And\nafter that the ore must still be dug out of the earth and the metal refined.\nAs always, Gelluk’s mind leapt across obstacles and delays to the wonderful\nmysteries at the end of them.\n\nIn the lore-book from Way, which he brought with him in a spell-sealed box\nwhenever he traveled, were passages concerning the true refiner’s fire. Having\nlong studied these, Gelluk knew that once he had enough of the pure metal, the\nnext stage was to refine it yet further into the Body of the Moon. He had\nunderstood the disguised language of the book to mean that in order to purify\npure quicksilver, the fire must be built not of mere wood but of human\ncorpses. Rereading and pondering the words this night in his room in the\nbarracks, he discerned another possible meaning in them. There was always\nanother meaning in the words of this lore. Perhaps the book was saying that\nthere must be sacrifice not only of base flesh but also of inferior spirit.\nThe great fire in the tower should burn not dead bodies but living ones.\nLiving and conscious. Purity from foulness: bliss from pain. It was all part\nof the great principle, perfectly clear once seen. He was sure he was right,\nhad at last understood the technique. But he must not hurry, he must be\npatient, must make certain. He turned to another passage and compared the two,\nand brooded over the book late into the night. Once for a moment something\ndrew his mind away, some invasion of the outskirts of his awareness; the boy\nwas trying some trick or other. Gelluk spoke a single word impatiently, and\nreturned to the marvels of the Allking’s realm. He never noticed that his\nprisoner’s dreams had escaped him.\n\nNext day he had Licky send him the boy. He looked forward to seeing him, to\nbeing kind to him, teaching him, petting him a bit as he had done yesterday.\nHe sat down with him in the sun. Gelluk was fond of children and animals. He\nliked all beautiful things. It was pleasant to have a young creature about.\nOtter’s uncomprehending awe was endearing, as was his uncomprehended strength.\nSlaves were wearisome with their weakness and trickery and their ugly, sick\nbodies. Of course Otter was his slave, but the boy need not know it. They\ncould be teacher and prentice. But prentices were faithless, Gelluk thought,\nreminded of his prentice Early, too clever by half, whom he must remember to\ncontrol more strictly. Father and son, that’s what he and Otter could be. He\nwould have the boy call him Father. He recalled that he had intended to find\nout his true name. There were various ways of doing it, but the simplest,\nsince the boy was already under his control, was to ask him. “What is your\nname?” he said, watching Otter intently.\n\nThere was a little struggle in the mind, but the mouth opened and the tongue\nmoved: “Medra.”\n\n“Very good, very good, Medra,” said the wizard. “You may call me Father.”\n\n“You must find the Red Mother,” he said, the day after that. They were sitting\nside by side again outside the barracks. The autumn sun was warm. The wizard\nhad taken off his conical hat, and his thick grey hair flowed loose about his\nface. “I know you found that little patch for them to dig, but there’s no more\nin that than a few drops. It’s scarcely worth burning for so little. If you\nare to help me, and if I am to teach you, you must try a little harder. I\nthink you know how.” He smiled at Otter. “Don’t you?”\n\nOtter nodded.\n\nHe was still shaken, appalled, by the ease with which Gelluk had forced him to\nsay his name, which gave the wizard immediate and ultimate power over him. Now\nhe had no hope of resisting Gelluk in any way. That night he had been in utter\ndespair. But then Anieb had come into his mind: come of her own will, by her\nown means. He could not summon her, could not even think of her, and would not\nhave dared to do so, since Gelluk knew his name. But she came, even when he\nwas with the wizard, not in apparition but as a presence in his mind.\n\nIt was hard to be aware of her through the wizard’s talk and the constant,\nhalf-conscious controlling spells that wove a darkness round him. But when\nOtter could do so, then it was not so much as if she was with him, as that she\nwas him, or that he was her. He saw through her eyes. Her voice spoke in his\nmind, stronger and clearer than Gelluk’s voice and spells. Through her eyes\nand mind he could see, and think. And he began to see that the wizard,\ncompletely certain of possessing him body and soul, was careless of the spells\nthat bound Otter to his will. A bond is a connection. He-or Anieb within him-\ncould follow the links of Gelluk’s spells back into Gelluk’s own mind.\n\nOblivious to all this, Gelluk talked on, following the endless spell of his\nown enchanting voice.\n\n“You must find the true womb, the bellybag of the Earth, that holds the pure\nmoonseed. Did you know that the Moon is the Earth’s father? Yes, yes; and he\nlay with her, as is the father’s right. He quickened her base clay with the\ntrue seed. But she will not give birth to the King. She is strong in her fear\nand willful in her vileness. She holds him back and hides him deep, fearing to\ngive birth to her master. That is why, to give him birth, she must be burned\nalive.”\n\nGelluk stopped and said nothing for some time, thinking, his face excited.\nOtter glimpsed the images in his mind: great fires blazing, burning sticks\nwith hands and feet, burning lumps that screamed as green wood screams in the\nfire.\n\n“Yes,” Gelluk said, his deep voice soft and dreamy, “she must be burned alive.\nAnd then, only then, he will spring forth, shining!\n\nOh, it’s time, and past time. We must deliver the King. We must find the great\nlode. It is here; there is no doubt of that: ‘The womb of the Mother lies\nunder Samory.””\n\nAgain he paused. All at once he looked straight at Otter, who froze in terror\nthinking the wizard had caught him watching his mind. Gelluk stared at him a\nwhile with that curious half-keen, half-unseeing gaze, smiling. “Little\nMedra!” he said, as if just discovering he was there. He patted Otter’s\nshoulder. “I know you have the gift of finding what’s hidden. Quite a great\ngift, were it suitably trained. Have no fear, my son. I know why you led my\nservants only to the little lode, playing and delaying. But now that I’ve\ncome, you serve me, and have nothing to be afraid of. And there’s no use\ntrying to conceal anything from me, is there? The wise child loves his father\nand obeys him, and the father rewards him as he deserves.” He leaned very\nclose, as he liked to do, and said gently, confidentially, “I’m sure you can\nfind the great lode.”\n\n“I know where it is,” Anieb said.\n\nOtter could not speak; she had spoken through him, using his voice, which\nsounded thick and faint.\n\nVery few people ever spoke to Gelluk unless he compelled them to. The spells\nby which he silenced, weakened, and controlled all who approached him were so\nhabitual to him that he gave them no thought. He was used to being listened\nto, not to listening. Serene in his strength and obsessed with his ideas, he\nhad no thought beyond them. He was not aware of Otter at all except as a part\nof his plans, an extension of himself. “Yes, yes, you will,” he said, and\nsmiled again.\n\nBut Otter was intensely aware of Gelluk, both physically and as a presence of\nimmense controlling power; and it seemed to him that Anieb’s speaking had\ntaken away that much of Gelluk’s power over him, gaining him a place to stand,\na foothold. Even with Gelluk so close to him, fearfully close, he managed to\nspeak.\n\n“I will take you there,” he said, stiffly, laboriously.\n\nGelluk was used to hearing people say the words he had put in their mouths, if\nthey said anything at all. These were words he wanted but had not expected to\nhear. He took the young man’s arm, putting his face very close to his, and\nfelt him cower away.\n\n“How clever you are,” he said. “Have you found better ore than that patch you\nfound first? Worth the digging and the roasting?”\n\n“It is the lode,” the young man said.\n\nThe slow stiff words carried great weight.\n\n“The great lode?” Gelluk looked straight at him, their faces not a hand’s\nbreadth apart. The light in his bluish eyes was like the soft, crazy shift of\nquicksilver. “The womb?”\n\n“Only the Master can go there.”\n\n“What Master?”\n\n“The Master of the House. The King.”\n\nTo Otter this conversation was, again, like walking forward in a vast darkness\nwith a small lamp. Anieb’s understanding was that lamp. Each step revealed the\nnext step he must take, but he could never see the place where he was. He did\nnot know what was coming next, and did not understand what he saw. But he saw\nit, and went forward, word by word.\n\n“How do you know of that House?”\n\n“I saw it.”\n\n“Where? Near here?”\n\nOtter nodded.\n\n“Is it in the earth?”\n\nTell him what he sees, Anieb whispered in Otter’s mind, and he spoke: “A\nstream runs through darkness over a glittering roof. Under the roof is the\nHouse of the King. The roof stands high above the floor, on high pillars. The\nfloor is red. All the pillars are red. On them are shining runes.”\n\nGelluk caught his breath. Presently he said, very softly, “Can you read the\nrunes?”\n\n“I cannot read them.” Otter’s voice was toneless. “I cannot go there. No one\ncan enter there in the body but only the King. Only he can read what is\nwritten.”\n\nGelluk’s white face had gone whiter; his jaw trembled a little. He stood up,\nsuddenly, as he always did. “Take me there,” he said, trying to control\nhimself, but so violently compelling Otter to get up and walk that the young\nman lurched to his feet and stumbled several steps, almost falling. Then he\nwalked forward, stiff and awkward, trying not to resist the coercive,\npassionate will that hurried his steps.\n\nGelluk pressed close beside him, often taking his arm. “This way,” he said\nseveral times. “Yes, yes! This is the way.” Yet he was following Otter. His\ntouch and his spells pushed him, rushed him, but in the direction Otter chose\nto go.\n\nThey walked past the roaster tower, past the old shaft and the new one, on\ninto the long valley where Otter had taken Licky the first day he was there.\nIt was late autumn now. The shrubs and scrubby grass that had been green that\nday were dun and dry, and the wind rattled the last leaves on the bushes. To\ntheir left a little stream ran low among willow thickets. Mild sunlight and\nlong shadows streaked the hillsides.\n\nOtter knew that a moment was coming when he might get free of Gelluk: of that\nhe had been sure since last night. He knew also that in that same moment he\nmight defeat Gelluk, disempower him, if the wizard, driven by his visions,\nforgot to guard himself-and if Otter could learn his name.\n\nThe wizard’s spells still bound their minds together. Otter pressed rashly\nforward into Gelluk’s mind, seeking his true name. But he did not know where\nto look or how to look. A finder who did not know his craft, all he could see\nclearly in Gelluk’s thoughts were pages of a lore-book full of meaningless\nwords, and the vision he had described-a vast, red-walled palace where silver\nrunes danced on the crimson pillars. But Otter could not read the book or the\nrunes. He had never learned to read.\n\nAll this time he and Gelluk were going on farther from the tower, away from\nAnieb, whose presence sometimes weakened and faded. Otter dared not try to\nsummon her.\n\nOnly a few steps ahead of them now was the place where underfoot, underground,\ntwo or three feet down, dark water crept and seeped through soft earth over\nthe ledge of mica. Under that opened the hollow cavern and the lode of\ncinnabar.\n\nGelluk was almost wholly absorbed in his own vision, but since Otter’s mind\nand his were connected, he saw something of what Otter saw. He stopped,\ngripping Otter’s arm. His hand shook with eagerness.\n\nOtter pointed at the low slope that rose before them. “The King’s House is\nthere,” he said. Gelluk’s attention turned entirely away from him then, fixed\non the hillside and the vision he saw within it. Then Otter could call to\nAnieb. At once she came into his mind and being, and was there with him.\n\nGelluk was standing still, but his shaking hands were clenched, his whole tall\nbody twitching and trembling, like a hound that wants to chase but cannot find\nthe scent. He was at a loss. There was the hillside with its grass and bushes\nin the last of the sunlight, but there was no entrance. Grass growing out of\ngravelly dirt; the seamless earth.\n\nAlthough Otter had not thought the words, Anieb spoke with his voice, the same\nweak, dull voice: “Only the Master can open the door. Only the King has the\nkey.”\n\n“The key,” Gelluk said.\n\nOtter stood motionless, effaced, as Anieb had stood in the room in the tower.\n\n“The key,” Gelluk repeated, urgent.\n\n“The key is the King’s name.”\n\nThat was a leap in the darkness. Which of them had said it?\n\nGelluk stood tense and trembling, still at a loss. “Turres,” he said, after a\ntime, almost in a whisper.\n\nThe wind blew in the dry grass.\n\nThe wizard started forward all at once, his eyes blazing, and cried, “Open to\nthe King’s name! I am Tinaral!” And his hands moved in a quick, powerful\ngesture, as if parting heavy curtains.\n\nThe hillside in front of him trembled, writhed, and opened. A gash in it\ndeepened, widened. Water sprang up out of it and ran across the wizard’s feet.\n\nHe drew back, staring, and made a fierce motion of his hand that brushed away\nthe stream in a spray like a fountain blown by the wind. The gash in the earth\ngrew deeper, revealing the ledge of mica. With a sharp rending crack the\nglittering stone split apart. Under it was darkness.\n\nThe wizard stepped forward. “I come,” he said in his joyous, tender voice, and\nhe strode fearlessly into the raw wound in the earth, a white light playing\naround his hands and his head. But seeing no slope or stair downward as he\ncame to the lip of the broken roof of the cavern, he hesitated, and in that\ninstant Anieb shouted in Otter’s voice, “Tinaral, fall!”\n\nStaggering wildly the wizard tried to turn, lost his footing on the crumbling\nedge, and plunged down into the dark, his scarlet cloak billowing up, the\nwerelight round him like a falling star.\n\n“Close!” Otter cried, dropping to his knees, his hands on the earth, on the\nraw lips of the crevasse. “Close, Mother! Be healed, be whole!” He pleaded,\nbegged, speaking in the Language of the Making words he did not know until he\nspoke them. “Mother, be whole!” he said, and the broken ground groaned and\nmoved, drawing together, healing itself.\n\nA reddish seam remained, a scar through the dirt and gravel and uprooted\ngrass.\n\nThe wind rattled the dry leaves on the scrub-oak bushes. The sun was behind\nthe hill, and clouds were coming over in a low, grey mass.\n\nOtter crouched there at the foot of the hillslope, alone.\n\nThe clouds darkened. Rain passed through the little valley, falling on the\ndirt and the grass. Above the clouds the sun was descending the western stair\nof the sky’s bright house.\n\nOtter sat up at last. He was wet, cold, bewildered. Why was he here?\n\nHe had lost something and had to find it. He did not know what he had lost,\nbut it was in the fiery tower, the place where stone stairs went up among\nsmoke and fumes. He had to go there. He got to his feet and shuffled, lame and\nunsteady, back down the valley.\n\nHe had no thought of hiding or protecting himself. Luckily for him there were\nno guards about; there were few guards, and they were not on the alert, since\nthe wizard’s spells had kept the prison shut. The spells were gone, but the\npeople in the tower did not know it, working on under the greater spell of\nhopelessness.\n\nOtter passed the domed chamber of the roaster pit and its hurrying slaves, and\nclimbed slowly up the circling, darkening, reeking stairs till he came to the\ntopmost room.\n\nShe was there, the sick woman who could heal him, the poof woman who held the\ntreasure, the stranger who was himself.\n\nHe stood silent in the doorway. She sat on the stone floor near the crucible,\nher thin body grayish and dark like the stones. Her chin and breasts were\nshiny with the spittle that ran from her mouth. He thought of the spring of\nwater that had run from the broken earth.\n\n“Medra,” she said. Her sore mouth could not speak clearly. He knelt down and\ntook her hands, looking into her face.\n\n“Anieb,” he whispered, “conic with me”\n\n“I want to go home,” she said.\n\nHe helped her stand. He made no spell to protect or hide them. His strength\nhad been used up. And though there was a great magery in her, which had\nbrought her with him every step of that strange journey into the valley and\ntricked the wizard into saying his name, she knew no arts or spells, and had\nno strength left at all.\n\nStill no one paid attention to them, as if a charm of protection were on them.\nThey walked down the winding stairs, out of the tower, past the barracks, away\nfrom the mines. They walked through thin woodlands towards the foothills that\nhid Mount Onn from the lowlands of Samory.\n\nAnieb kept a better pace than seemed possible in a woman so famished and\ndestroyed, walking almost naked in the chill of the rain. All her will was\naimed on walking forward; she had nothing else in her mind, not him, not\nanything. But she was there bodily with him, and he felt her presence as\nkeenly and strangely as when she had come to his summoning. The rain ran down\nher naked head and body. He made her stop to put on his shirt. He was ashamed\nof it, for it was filthy, he having worn it all these weeks. She let him pull\nit over her head and then walked right on. She could not go quickly, but she\nwent steadily, her eyes fixed on the faint cart track they followed, till the\nnight came early under the rain clouds, and they could not see where to set\ntheir feet.\n\n“Make the light,” she said. Her voice was a whimper, plaintive. “Can’t you\nmake the light?”\n\n“I don’t know,” he said, but he tried to bring the werelight round them, and\nafter a while the ground glimmered faintly before their feet.\n\n“We should find shelter and rest,” he said.\n\n“I can’t stop,” she said, and started to walk again.\n\n“You can’t walk all night.”\n\n“If I lie down I won’t get up. I want to see the Mountain.”\n\nHer thin voice was hidden by the many-voiced rain sweeping over the hills and\nthrough the trees.\n\nThey went on through darkness, seeing only the track before them in the dim\nsilvery glow of werelight shot through by silver lines of rain. When she\nstumbled he caught her arm. After that they went on pressed close side by side\nfor comfort and for the little warmth. They walked slower, and yet slower, but\nthey walked on. There was no sound but the sound of the rain falling from the\nblack sky, and the little kissing squelch of their sodden feet in the mud and\nwet grass of the track.\n\n“Look,” she said, halting. “Medra, look.”\n\nHe had been walking almost asleep. The pallor of the werelight had faded,\ndrowned in a fainter, vaster clarity. Sky and earth were all one grey, but\nbefore them and above them, very high, over a drift of cloud, the long ridge\nof the mountain glimmered red.\n\n“There,” Anieb said. She pointed at the mountain and smiled. She looked at her\ncompanion, then slowly down at the ground. She sank down kneeling. He knelt\nwith her, tried to support her, but she slid down in his arms. He tried to\nkeep her head at least from the mud of the track. Her limbs and face twitched,\nher teeth chattered. He held her close against him, trying to warm her.\n\n“The women,” she whispered, “the hand. Ask them. In the village. I did see the\nMountain.”\n\nShe tried to sit up again, looking up, but the shaking and shuddering seized\nher and wracked her. She began to gasp for breath. In the red light that shone\nnow from the crest of the mountain and all the eastern sky he saw the foam and\nspittle run scarlet from her mouth. Sometimes she clutched at him, but she did\nnot speak again. She fought her death, fought to breathe, while the red light\nfaded and then darkened into grey as clouds swept again across the mountain\nand hid the rising sun. It was broad day and raining when her last hard breath\nwas not followed by another.\n\nThe man whose name was Medra sat in the mud with the dead woman in his arms\nand wept.\n\nA carter walking at his mule’s head with a load of oakwood came upon them and\ntook them both to Woodedge. He could not make the young man let go of the dead\nwoman. Weak and shaky as he was, he would not set his burden down on the load,\nbut clambered into the cart holding her, and held her all the miles to\nWoodedge. All he said was “She saved me,” and the carter asked no questions.\n\n“She saved me but I couldn’t save her,” he said fiercely to the men and women\nof the mountain village. He still would not let her go, holding the rain-wet,\nstiffened body against him as if to defend it.\n\nVery slowly they made him understand that one of the women was Anieb’s mother,\nand that he should give Anieb to her to hold. He did so at last, watching to\nsee if she was gentle with his friend and would protect her. Then he followed\nanother woman meekly enough. He put on dry clothing she gave him to put on,\nand ate a little food she gave him to eat, and lay down on the pallet she led\nhim to, and sobbed in weariness, and slept.\n\nIn a day or two some of Licky’s men came asking if anyone had seen or heard\ntell of the great wizard Gelluk and a young finder-both disappeared without a\ntrace, they said, as if the earth had swallowed them. Nobody in Woodedge said\na word about the stranger hidden in Mead’s apple loft. They kept him safe.\nMaybe that is why the people there now call their village not Woodedge, as it\nused to be, but Otterhide.\n\nHe had been through a long hard trial and had taken a great chance against a\ngreat power. His bodily strength came back soon, for he was young, but his\nmind was slow to find itself. He had lost something, lost it forever, lost it\nas he found it.\n\nHe sought among memories, among shadows, groping over and over through images:\nthe assault on his home in Havnor; the stone cell, and Hound; the brick cell\nin the barracks and the spell-bonds there; walking with Licky; sitting with\nGelluk; the slaves, the fire, the stone stairs winding up through fumes and\nsmoke to the high room in the tower. He had to regain it all, to go through it\nall, searching. Over and over he stood in that tower room and looked at the\nwoman, and she looked at him. Over and over he walked through the little\nvalley, through the dry grass, through the wizard’s fiery visions, with her.\nOver and over he saw the wizard fall, saw the earth close. He saw the red\nridge of the mountain in the dawn. Anieb died while he held her, her ruined\nface against his arm. He asked her who she was, and what they had done, and\nhow they had done it, but she could not answer him.\n\nHer mother Ayo and her mothers sister Mead were wise women. They healed Otter\nas best they could with warm oils and massage, herbs and chants. They talked\nto him and listened when he talked. Neither of them had any doubt but that he\nwas a man of great power. He denied this. “I could have done nothing without\nyour daughter,” he said.\n\n“What did she do?” Ayo asked, softly.\n\nHe told her, as well as he could. “We were strangers. Yet she gave me her\nname,” he said. “And I gave her mine.” He spoke haltingly, with long pauses.\n“It was I that walked with the wizard, compelled by him, but she was with me,\nand she was free. And so together we could turn his power against him, so that\nhe destroyed himself.” He thought tor a long time, and said, “She gave me her\npower.”\n\n“We knew there was a great gift in her,” Ayo said, and then fell silent for a\nwhile. “We didn’t know how to teach her. There are no teachers left on the\nmountain. King Losen’s wizards destroy the sorcerers and witches. There’s no\none to turn to.”\n\n“Once I was on the high slopes,” Mead said, “and a spring snowstorm came on\nme, and I lost my way. She came there. She came to me, not in the body, and\nguided me to the track. She was only twelve then.”\n\n“She walked with the dead, sometimes,” Ayo said very low. “In the forest, down\ntowards Faliern. She knew the old powers, those my grandmother told me of, the\npowers of the earth. They were strong there, she said.”\n\n“But she was only a girl like the others, too,” Mead said, and hid her face.\n“A good girl,” she whispered.\n\nAfter a while Ayo said, “She went down to Firn with some of the young folk. To\nbuy fleece from the shepherds there. A year ago last spring. That wizard they\nspoke of came there, casting spells. Taking slaves.”\n\nThen they were all silent.\n\nAyo and Mead were much alike, and Otter saw in them what Anieb might have\nbeen: a short, slight, quick woman, with a round face and clear eyes, and a\nmass of dark hair, not straight like most people’s hair but curly, frizzy.\nMany people in the west of Havnor had hair like that.\n\nBut Anieb had been bald, like all the slaves in the roaster tower.\n\nHer use-name had been Flag, the blue iris of the springs. Her mother and aunt\ncalled her Flag when they spoke of her.\n\n“Whatever I am, whatever I can do, it’s not enough,” he said.\n\n“It’s never enough,” Mead said. “And what can anyone do alone?”\n\nShe held up her first finger; raised the other fingers, and clenched them\ntogether into a fist; then slowly turned her wrist and opened her hand palm\nout, as if in offering. He had seen Anieb make that gesture. It was not a\nspell, he thought, watching intently, but a sign. Ayo was watching him.\n\n“It is a secret,” she said.\n\n“Can I know the secret?” he asked after a while.\n\n“You already know it. You gave it to Flag. She gave it to you. Trust.”\n\n“Trust,” the young man said. “Yes. But against- Against them?- Gelluk’s gone.\nMaybe Losen will fall now. Will it make any difference? Will the slaves go\nfree? Will beggars eat? Will justice be done? I think there’s an evil in us,\nin humankind. Trust denies it. Leaps across it. Leaps the chasm. But it’s\nthere. And everything we do finally serves evil, because that’s what we are.\nGreed and cruelty. I look at the world, at the forests and the mountain here,\nthe sky, and it’s all right, as it should be. But we aren’t. People aren’t.\nWe’re wrong. We do wrong. No animal does wrong. How could they? But we can,\nand we do. And we never stop.”\n\nThey listened to him, not agreeing, not denying, but accepting his despair.\nHis words went into their listening silence, and rested there for days, and\ncame back to him changed.\n\n“We can’t do anything without each other,” he said. “But it’s the greedy ones,\nthe cruel ones who hold together and strengthen each other. And those who\nwon’t join them stand each alone.” The image of Anieb as he had first seen\nher, a dying woman standing alone in the tower room, was always with him.\n“Real power goes to waste. Every wizard uses his arts against the others,\nserving the men of greed. What good can any art be used that way? It’s wasted.\nIt goes wrong, or it’s thrown away. Like slaves’ lives. Nobody can be free\nalone. Not even a mage. All of them working their magic in prison cells, to\ngain nothing. There’s no way to use power for good.”\n\nAyo closed her hand and opened it palm up, a fleeting sketch of a gesture, of\na sign.\n\nA man came up the mountain to Woodedge, a charcoal burner from Firn. “My wife\nNesty sends a message to the wise women,” he said, and the villagers showed\nhim Ayo’s house. As he stood in the doorway he made a hurried motion, a fist\nturned to an open palm. “Nesty says tell you that the crows are flying early\nand the hound’s after the otter,” he said.\n\nOtter, sitting by the fire shelling walnuts, held still. Mead thanked the\nmessenger and brought him in for a cup of water and a handful of shelled nuts.\nShe and Ayo chatted with him about his wife. When he had gone she turned to\nOtter.\n\n“The Hound serves Losen,” he said. “I’ll go today.”\n\nMead looked at her sister. “Then it’s time we talked a bit to you,” she said,\nsitting down across the hearth from him. Ayo stood by the table, silent. A\ngood fire burned in the hearth. It was a wet, cold time, and firewood was one\nthing they had plenty of, here on the mountain.\n\n“There’s people all over these parts, and maybe beyond, who think, as you\nsaid, that nobody can be wise alone. So these people try to hold to each\nother. And so that’s why we’re called the Hand, or the women of the Hand,\nthough we’re not women only. But it serves to call ourselves women, for the\ngreat folk don’t look for women to work together. Or to have thoughts about\nsuch things as rule or misrule. Or to have any powers.”\n\n“They say,” said Ayo from the shadows, “that there’s an island where the rule\nof justice is kept as it was under the Kings.\n\nMorred s Isle, they call it. But it’s not Enlad of the Kings, nor Ea. It’s\nsouth, not north of Havnor, they say. There they say the women of the Hand\nhave kept the old arts. And they teach them, not keeping them secret each to\nhimself, as the wizards do.”\n\n“Maybe with such teaching you could teach the wizards a lesson,” Mead said.\n\n“Maybe you can find that island,” said Ayo.\n\nOtter looked from one to the other. Clearly they had told him their own\ngreatest secret and their hope.\n\n“Morred’s Isle,” he said.\n\n“That would be only what the women of the Hand call it, keeping its meaning\nfrom the wizards and the pirates. To them no doubt it would bear some other\nname.”\n\n“It would be a terrible long way,” said Mead.\n\nTo the sisters and all these villagers, Mount Onn was the world, and the\nshores of Havnor were the edge of the universe. Beyond that was only rumor and\ndream.\n\n“You’ll come to the sea, going south, they say,” said Ayo.\n\n“He knows that, sister,” Mead told her. “Didn’t he tell us he was a ship\ncarpenter? But it’s a terrible long way down to the sea, surely. With this\nwizard on your scent, how are you to go there?”\n\n“By the grace of water, that carries no scent,” Otter said, standing up. A\nlitter of walnut shells fell from his lap, and he took the hearth broom and\nswept them into the ashes. “I’d better go.”\n\n“There’s bread,” Ayo said, and Mead hurried to pack hard bread and hard cheese\nand walnuts into a pouch made of a sheep’s stomach. They were very poor\npeople. They gave him what they had. So Anieb had done.\n\n“My mother was born in Endlane, round by Faliern Forest,” Otter said. “Do you\nknow that town? She’s called Rose, Rowan’s daughter.”\n\n“The carters go down to Endlane, summers.”\n\n“If somebody could talk to her people there, they’d get word to her. Her\nbrother, Littleash, used to conic to the city every year or two.”\n\nThey nodded.\n\n“If she knew I was alive,” he said.\n\nAnieb’s mother nodded. “She’ll hear it.”\n\n“Go on now,” said Mead.\n\n“Go with the water,” said Ayo.\n\nHe embraced them, and they him, and he left the house.\n\nHe ran down from the straggle of huts to the quick, noisy stream he had heard\nsinging through his sleep all his nights in Woodedge. He prayed to it. “Take\nme and save me,” he asked it. He made the spell the old Changer had taught him\nlong ago, and said the word of transformation. Then no man knelt by the loud-\nrunning water, but an otter slipped into it and was gone.\n\nIII. Tern\n\n  \n\nThere was a wise man on our Hill\n\nWho found his way to work his will.\n\nHe changed his shape, he changed his name,\n\nBut ever the other will be the same.\n\nSo runs the water away, away,\n\nSo runs the water away.\n\n  \n\nONE WINTER AFTERNOON on the shore of the Onneva River where it fingers out\ninto the north bight of the Great Bay of Havnor, a man stood up on the muddy\nsand: a man poorly dressed and poorly shod, a thin brown man with dark eyes\nand hair so fine and thick it shed the rain. It was raining on the low beaches\nof the river mouth, the fine, cold, dismal drizzle of that grey winter. His\nclothes were soaked. He hunched his shoulders, turned about, and set off\ntowards a wisp of chimney smoke he saw far down the shore. Behind him were the\ntracks of an otter’s four feet coming up from the water and the tracks of a\nman’s two feet going away from it.\n\nWhere he went then, the songs don’t tell. They say only that he wandered, “he\nwandered long from land to land.” If he went along the coast of the Great\nIsle, in many of those villages he might have found a midwife or a wise woman\nor a sorcerer who knew the sign of the Hand and would help him; but with Hound\non his track, most likely he left Havnor as soon as he could, shipping as a\ncrewman on a fishing boat of the Ebavnor Straits or a trader of the Inmost\nSea.\n\nOn the island of Ark, and in Orrimy on Hosk, and down among the Ninety Isles,\nthere are tales about a man who came seeking for a land where people\nremembered the justice of the kings and the honor of wizards, and he called\nthat land Morred’s Isle. There’s no knowing if these stories are about Medra,\nsince he went under many names, seldom if ever calling himself Otter any more.\nGelluk’s fall had not brought Losen down. The pirate king had other wizards in\nhis pay, among them a man called Early, who would have liked to find the young\nupstart who defeated his master Gelluk. And Early had a good chance of tracing\nhim. Losen’s power stretched all across Havnor and the north of the Inmost\nSea, growing with the years; and the Hound’s nose was as keen as ever.\n\nMaybe it was to escape the hunt that Medra came to Pendor, a long way west of\nthe Inmost Sea, or maybe some rumor among the women of the Hand on Hosk sent\nhim there. Pendor was a rich island, then, before the dragon Yevaud despoiled\nit. Wherever Medra had gone until then, he had found the lands like Havnor or\nworse, sunk in warfare, raids, and piracy, the fields full of weeds, the towns\nfull of thieves. Maybe he thought, at first, that on Pendor he had found\nMorred’s Isle, for the city was beautiful and peaceful and the people\nprosperous.\n\nHe met there a mage, an old man called Highdrake, whose true name has been\nlost. When Highdrake heard the tale of Morred’s Isle he smiled and looked sad\nand shook his head. “Not here,” he said. “Not this. The Lords of Pendor are\ngood men. They remember the kings. They don’t seek war or plunder. But they\nsend their sons west dragon hunting. In sport. As if the dragons of the West\nReach were ducks or geese for the killing! No good will come of that.”\n\nHighdrake took Medra as his student, gratefully. “I was taught my art by a\nmage who gave me freely all he knew, but I never found anybody to give that\nknowledge to, until you came,” he told Medra. “The young men come to me and\nthey say, “What good is it? Can you find gold?” they say. “Can you teach me\nhow to make stones into diamonds? Can you give me a sword that will kill a\ndragon? What’s the use of talking about the balance of things? There’s no\nprofit in it,” they say. No profit!” And the old man railed on about the folly\nof the young and the evils of modern times.\n\nWhen it came to teaching what he knew, he was tireless, generous, and\nexacting. For the first time, Medra was given a vision of magic not as a set\nof strange gifts and reasonless acts, but as an art and a craft, which could\nbe known truly with long study and used rightly after long practice, though\neven then it would never lose its strangeness. Highdrake’s mastery of spells\nand sorcery was not much greater than his pupil’s, but he had clear in his\nmind the idea of something very much greater, the wholeness of knowledge. And\nthat made him a mage.\n\nListening to him, Medra thought of how he and Anieb had walked in the dark and\nrain by the faint glimmer that showed them only the next step they could take,\nand of how they had looked up to the red ridge of the mountain in the dawn.\n\n“Every spell depends on every other spell,” said Highdrake. “Every motion of a\nsingle leaf moves every leaf of every tree on every isle of Earthsea! There is\na pattern. That’s what you must look for and look to. Nothing goes right but\nas part of the pattern. Only in it is freedom.”\n\nMedra stayed three years with Highdrake, and when the old mage died, the Lord\nof Pendor asked Medra to take his place. Despite his ranting and scolding\nagainst dragon hunters, High-drake had been honored in his island, and his\nsuccessor would have both honor and power. Perhaps tempted to think that he\nhad come as near to Morred’s Isle as he would ever come, Medra stayed a while\nlonger on Pendor. He went out with the young lord in his ship, past the\nToringates and far into the West Reach, to look for dragons. There was a great\nlonging in his heart to see a dragon. But untimely storms, the evil weather of\nthose years, drove their ship back to Ingat three times, and Medra refused to\nrun her west again into those gales. He had learned a good deal about\nweatherworking since his days in a catboat on Havnor Bay.\n\nA while after that he left Pendor, drawn southward again, and maybe went to\nEnsmer. In one guise or another he came at last to Geath in the Ninety Isles.\n\nThere they fished for whales, as they still do. That was a trade he wanted no\npart of. Their ships stank and their town stank. He disliked going aboard a\nslave ship, but the only vessel going out of Geath to the east was a galley\ncarrying whale oil to O Port. He had heard talk of the Closed Sea, south and\neast of O, where there were rich isles, little known, that had no commerce\nwith the lands of the Inmost Sea. What he sought might be there. So he went as\na weatherworker on the galley, which was rowed by forty slaves.\n\nThe weather was fair for once: a following wind, a blue sky lively with little\nwhite clouds, the mild sunlight of late spring. They made good way from Geath.\nLate in the afternoon he heard the master say to the helmsman, “Keep her south\ntonight so we don’t raise Roke.”\n\nHe had not heard of that island, and asked, “What’s there?”\n\n“Death and desolation,” said the ship’s master, a short man with small, sad,\nknowing eyes like a whale’s.\n\n“War?”\n\n“Years back. Plague, black sorcery. The waters all round it are cursed.”\n\n“Worms,” said the helmsman, the master’s brother. “Catch fish anywhere near\nRoke, you’ll find em thick with worms as a dead dog on a dunghill.”\n\n“Do people still live there?” Medra asked, and the master said, “Witches,”\nwhile his brother said, “Worm eaters.”\n\nThere were many such isles in the Archipelago, made barren and desolate by\nrival wizards’ blights and curses; they were evil places to come to or even to\npass, and Medra thought no more about this one, until that night.\n\nSleeping out on deck with the starlight on his face, he had a simple, vivid\ndream: it was daylight, clouds racing across a bright sky, and across the sea\nhe saw the sunlit curve of a high green hill. He woke with the vision still\nclear in his mind, knowing he had seen it ten years before, in the spell-\nlocked barracks room at the mines of Samory.\n\nHe sat up. The dark sea was so quiet that the stars were reflected here and\nthere on the sleek lee side of the long swells. Oared galleys seldom went out\nof sight of land and seldom rowed through the night, laying to in any bay or\nharbor; but there was no moorage on this crossing, and since the weather was\nsettled so mild, they had put up the mast and big square sail. The ship\ndrifted softly forward, her slave oarsmen sleeping on their benches, the free\nmen of her crew all asleep but the helmsman and the lookout, and the lookout\nwas dozing. The water whispered on her sides, her timbers creaked a little, a\nslaves chain rattled, rattled again.\n\n“They don’t need a weatherworker on a night like this, and they haven’t paid\nme yet,” Medra said to his conscience. He had waked from his dream with the\nname Roke in his mind. Why had he never heard of the isle or seen it on a\nchart? It might be accursed and deserted as they said, but wouldn’t it be set\ndown on the charts?\n\n“I could fly there as a tern and be back on the ship before daylight,” he said\nto himself, but idly. He was bound for O Port. Ruined lands were all too\ncommon. No need to fly to seek them. He made himself comfortable in his coil\nof cable and watched the stars. Looking west, he saw the four bright stars of\nthe Forge, low over the sea. They were a little blurred, and as he watched\nthem they blinked out, one by one.\n\nThe faintest little sighing tremor ran over the slow, smooth swells.\n\n“Master,” Medra said, afoot, “wake up.”\n\n“What now?”\n\n“A witchwind coming. Following. Get the sail down.”\n\nNo wind stirred. The air was soft, the big sail hung slack. Only the western\nstars faded and vanished in a silent blackness that rose slowly higher. The\nmaster looked at that. “Witchwind, you say?” he asked, reluctant.\n\nCrafty men used weather as a weapon, sending hail to blight an enemy’s crops\nor a gale to sink his ships; and such storms, freakish and wild, might blow on\nfar past the place they had been sent, troubling harvesters or sailors a\nhundred miles away.\n\n“Get the sail down,” Medra said, peremptory. The master yawned and cursed and\nbegan to shout commands. The crewmen got up slowly and slowly began to rake\nthe awkward sail in, and the oarmaster, after asking several questions of the\nmaster and Medra, began to roar at the slaves and stride among them rousing\nthem right and left with his knotted rope. The sail was half down, the sweeps\nhalf manned, Medra’s staying spell half spoken, when the witchwind struck.\n\nIt struck with one huge thunderclap out of sudden utter blackness and wild\nrain. The ship pitched like a horse rearing and then rolled so hard and far\nthat the mast broke loose from its footing, though the stays held. The sail\nstruck the water, filled, and pulled the galley right over, the great sweeps\nsliding in their oarlocks, the chained slaves struggling and shouting on their\nbenches, barrels of oil breaking loose and thundering over one another-pulled\nher over and held her over, the deck vertical to the sea, till a huge storm\nwave struck and swamped her and she sank. All the shouting and screaming of\nmen’s voices was suddenly silent. There was no noise but the roar of the rain\non the sea, lessening as the freak wind passed on eastward. Through it one\nwhite seabird beat its wings up from the black water and flew, frail and\ndesperate, to the north.\n\nPrinted on narrow sands under granite cliffs, in the first light, were the\ntracks of a bird alighting. From them led the tracks of a man walking,\nstraying up the beach for a long way as it narrowed between the cliffs and the\nsea. Then the tracks ceased.\n\nMedra knew the danger of repeatedly taking any form but his own, but he was\nshaken and weakened by the shipwreck and the long night flight, and the grey\nbeach led him only to the feet of sheer cliffs he could not climb. He made the\nspell and said the word once more, and as a sea tern flew up on quick,\nlaboring wings to the top of the cliffs. Then, possessed by flight, he flew on\nover a shadowy sunrise land. Far ahead, bright in the first sunlight, he saw\nthe curve of a high green hill.\n\nTo it he flew, and on it landed, and as he touched the earth he was a man\nagain.\n\nHe stood there for a while, bewildered. It seemed to him that it was not by\nhis own act or decision that he had taken his own form, but that in touching\nthis ground, this hill, he had become himself. A magic greater than his own\nprevailed here.\n\nHe looked about, curious and wary. All over the hill spark-weed was in flower,\nits long petals blazing yellow in the grass. Children on Havnor knew that\nflower. They called it sparks from the burning of Ilien, when the Firelord\nattacked the islands, and Erreth-Akbe fought with him and defeated him. Tales\nand songs of the heroes rose up in Medra’s memory as he stood there: Erreth-\nAkbe and the heroes before him, the Eagle Queen, Heru, Akambar who drove the\nKargs into the east, and Serriadh the peacemaker, and Elfarran of Solea, and\nMorred, the White Enchanter, the beloved king. The brave and the wise, they\ncame before him as if summoned, as if he had called them to him, though he had\nnot called. He saw them. They stood among the tall grasses, among the flame-\nshaped flowers nodding in the wind of morning.\n\nThen they were all gone, and he stood alone on the hill, shaken and wondering.\n“I have seen the queens and kings of Earthsea,” he thought, “and they are only\nthe grass that grows on this hill.”\n\nHe went slowly round to the eastern side of the hilltop, bright and warm\nalready with the light of the sun a couple of fingers’ width above the\nhorizon. Looking under the sun he saw the roofs of a town at the head of a bay\nthat opened out eastward, and beyond it the high line of the sea’s edge across\nhalf the world. Turning west he saw fields and pastures and roads. To the\nnorth were long green hills. In a fold of land southward a grove of tall trees\ndrew his gaze and held it. He thought it was the beginning of a great forest\nlike Faliern on Havnor, and then did not know why he thought so, since beyond\nthe grove he could see treeless heaths and pastures.\n\nHe stood there a long time before he went down through the high grasses and\nthe sparkweed. At the foot of the hill he came into a lane. It led him through\nfarmlands that looked well kept, though very lonesome. He looked for a lane or\npath leading to the town, but there never was one that went eastward. Not a\nsoul was in the fields, some of which were newly ploughed. No dog barked as he\nwent by. Only at a crossroads an old donkey grazing a stony pasture came over\nto the wooden fence and leaned its head out, craving company. Medra stopped to\nstroke the grey-brown, bony face. A city man and a saltwater man, he knew\nlittle of farms and their animals, but he thought the donkey looked at him\nkindly.\n\n“Where am I, donkey?” he said to it. “How do I get to the town I saw?”\n\nThe donkey leaned its head hard against his hand so that he would go on\nscratching the place just above its eyes and below its ears. When he did so,\nit flicked its long right ear. So when he parted from the donkey he took the\nright hand of the crossroad, though it looked as if it would lead back to the\nhill; and soon enough he came among houses, and then onto a street that\nbrought him down at last into the town at the head of the bay.\n\nIt was as strangely quiet as the farmlands. Not a voice, not a face. It was\ndifficult to feel uneasy in an ordinary-looking town on a sweet spring\nmorning, but in such silence he must wonder if he was indeed in a plague-\nstricken place or an island under a curse. He went on. Between a house and an\nold plum tree was a wash line, the clothes pinned on it flapping in the sunny\nbreeze. A cat came round the corner of a garden, no abandoned starveling but a\nwhite-pawed, well-whiskered, prosperous cat. And at last, coming down the\nsteep little street, which here was cobbled, he heard voices.\n\nHe stopped to listen, and heard nothing.\n\nHe went on to the foot of the street. It opened into a small market square.\nPeople were gathered there, not many of them. They were not buying or selling.\nThere were no booths or stalls set up. They were waiting for him.\n\nEver since he had walked on the green hill above the town and had seen the\nbright shadows in the grass, his heart had been easy. He was expectant, full\nof a sense of great strangeness, but not frightened. He stood still and looked\nat the people who came to meet him.\n\nThree of them came forward: an old man, big and broad-chested, with bright\nwhite hair, and two women. Wizard knows wizard, and Medra knew they were women\nof power.\n\nHe raised his hand closed in a fist and then turning and opening it, offered\nit to them palm up.\n\n“Ah,” said one of the women, the taller of the two, and she laughed. But she\ndid not answer the gesture.\n\n“Tell us who you are,” the white-haired man said, courteously enough, but\nwithout greeting or welcome. “Tell us how you came here.”\n\n“I was born in Havnor and trained as a shipwright and a sorcerer. I was on a\nship bound from Geath to O Port. I was spared alone from drowning, last night,\nwhen a witchwind struck.” He was silent then. The thought of the ship and the\nchained men in her swallowed his mind as the black sea had swallowed them. He\ngasped, as if coming up from drowning.\n\n“How did you come here?”\n\n“As... as a bird, a tern. Is this Roke Island?”\n\n“You changed yourself?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Whom do you serve?” asked the shorter and younger of the women, speaking for\nthe first time. She had a keen, hard face, with long black brows.\n\n“I have no master.”\n\n“What was your errand in O Port?”\n\n“In Havnor, years ago, I was in servitude. Those who freed me told me about a\nplace where there are no masters, and the rule of Serriadh is remembered, and\nthe arts are honored. I have been looking for that place, that island, seven\nyears.”\n\n“Who told you about it?”\n\n“Women of the Hand.”\n\n“Anyone can make a fist and show a palm,” said the tall woman, pleasantly.\n“But not everyone can fly to Roke. Or swim, or sail, or come in any way at\nall. So we must ask what brought you here.”\n\nMedra did not answer at once. “Chance,” he said at last, “favoring long\ndesire. Not art. Not knowledge. I think I’ve come to the place I sought, but I\ndon’t know. I think you may be the people they told me of, but I don’t know. I\nthink the trees I saw from the hill hold some great mystery, but I don’t know.\nI only know that since I set foot on that hill I’ve been as I was when I was a\nchild and first heard The Deed of Enlad sung. I am lost among wonders.”\n\nThe white-haired man looked at the two women. Other people had come forward,\nand there was some quiet talk among them.\n\n“If you stayed here, what would you do?” the black-browed woman asked him.\n\n“I can build boats, or mend them, and sail them. I can find, above and under\nground. I can work weather, if you have any need of that. And I’ll learn the\nart from any who will teach me.”\n\n“What do you want to learn?” asked the taller woman in her mild voice.\n\nNow Medra felt that he had been asked the question on which the rest of his\nlife hung, for good or evil. Again he stood silent a while. He started to\nspeak, and didn’t speak, and finally spoke. “I could not save one, not one,\nnot the one who saved me,” he said. “Nothing I know could have set her free. I\nknow nothing. If you know how to be free, I beg you, teach me!”\n\n“Free!” said the tall woman, and her voice cracked like a whip. Then she\nlooked at her companions, and after a while she smiled a little. Turning back\nto Medra, she said, “We’re prisoners, and so freedom is a thing we study. You\ncame here through the walls of our prison. Seeking freedom, you say. But you\nshould know that leaving Roke may be even harder than coming to it. Prison\nwithin prison, and some of it we have built ourselves.” She looked at the\nothers. “What do you say?” she asked them.\n\nThey said little, seeming to consult and assent among themselves almost in\nsilence. At last the shorter woman looked with her fierce eyes at Medra. “Stay\nif you will,” she said.\n\n“I will.”\n\n“What will you have us call you?”\n\n“Tern,” he said; and so he was called.\n\n  \n\nWhat he found on Roke was both less and more than the hope and rumor he had\nsought so long. Roke Island was, they told him, the heart of Earthsea. The\nfirst land Segoy raised from the waters in the beginning of time was bright Ea\nof the northern sea, and the second was Roke. That green hill, Roke Knoll, was\nfounded deeper than all the islands. The trees he had seen, which seemed\nsometimes to be in one place on the isle and sometimes in another, were the\noldest trees in the world, and the source and center of magic.\n\n“If the Grove were cut, all wizardry would fail. The roots of those trees are\nthe roots of knowledge. The patterns the shadows of their leaves make in the\nsunlight write the words Segoy spoke in the Making.”\n\nSo said Ember, his fierce, black-browed teacher.\n\nAll the teachers of the art magic on Roke were women. There were no men of\npower, few men at all, on the island.\n\nThirty years before, the pirate lords of Wathort had sent a fleet to conquer\nRoke, not for its wealth, which was little, but to break the power of its\nmagery, which was reputed to be great. One of the wizards of Roke had betrayed\nthe island to the crafty men of Wathort, lowering its spells of defense and\nwarning. Once those were breached, the pirates took the island not by\nwizardries but by force and fire. Their great ships filled Thwil Bay, their\nhordes burned and looted, their slave takers carried off men, boys, young\nwomen. Little children and the old they slaughtered. They fired every house\nand field they came to. When they sailed away after a few days they left no\nvillage standing, the farmsteads in ruins or desolate.\n\nThe town at the bay’s head, Thwil, shared something of the uncanniness of the\nKnoll and the Grove, for though the raiders had run through it seeking slaves\nand plunder and setting fires, the fires had gone out and the narrow streets\nhad sent the marauders astray. Most of the islanders who survived were wise\nwomen and their children, who had hidden themselves in the town or in the\nImmanent Grove. The men now on Roke were those spared children, grown, and a\nfew men now grown old. There was no government but that of the women of the\nHand, for it was their spells that had protected Roke so long and protected it\nfar more closely now.\n\nThey had little trust in men. A man had betrayed them. Men had attacked them.\nIt was men’s ambitions, they said, that had perverted all the arts to ends of\ngain. “We do not deal with their governments,” said tall Veil in her mild\nvoice.\n\nAnd yet Ember said to Medra, “We were our own undoing.”\n\nMen and women of the Hand had joined together on Roke a hundred or more years\nago, forming a league of mages. Proud and secure in their powers, they had\nsought to teach others to band together in secret against the war makers and\nslave takers until they could rise openly against them. Women had always been\nleaders in the league, said Ember, and women, in the guise of salve sellers\nand net makers and such, had gone from Roke to other lands around the Inmost\nSea, weaving a wide, fine net of resistance. Even now there were strands and\nknots of that net left. Medra had come on one of those traces first in Anieb’s\nvillage, and had followed them since. But they had not led him here. Since the\nraid, Roke Island had isolated itself wholly, sealed itself inside powerful\nspells of protection woven and rewoven by the wise women of the island, and\nhad no commerce with any other people. “We can’t save them,” Ember said. “We\ncouldn’t save ourselves.”\n\nVeil, with her gentle voice and smile, was implacable. She told Medra that\nthough she had consented to his remaining on Roke, it was to keep watch on\nhim. “You broke through our defenses once,” she said. “All that you say of\nyourself may be true, and may not. What can you tell me that would make me\ntrust you?”\n\nShe agreed with the others to give him a little house down by the harbor and a\njob helping the boat-builder of Thwil, who had taught herself her trade and\nwelcomed his skill. Veil put no difficulties in his path and always greeted\nhim kindly. But she had said, “What can you tell me that would make me trust\nyou?” and he had no answer for her.\n\nEmber usually scowled when he greeted her. She asked him abrupt questions,\nlistened to his answers, and said nothing.\n\nHe asked her, rather timidly, to tell him what the Immanent Grove was, for\nwhen he had asked others they said, “Ember can tell you.” She refused his\nquestion, not arrogantly but definitely, saying, “You can learn about the\nGrove only in it and from it.” A few days later she came down to the sands of\nThwil Bay, where he was repairing a fishing boat. She helped him as she could,\nand asked about boat-building, and he told her and showed her what he could.\nIt was a peaceful afternoon, but after it she went off in her abrupt way. He\nfelt some awe of her; she was incalculable. He was amazed when, not long\nafter, she said to him, “I’ll be going to the Grove after the Long Dance. Come\nif you like.”\n\nIt seemed that from Roke Knoll the whole extent of the Grove could be seen,\nyet if you walked in it you did not always come out into the fields again. You\nwalked on under the trees. In the inner Grove they were all of one kind, which\ngrew nowhere else, yet had no name in Hardic but “tree” In the Old Speech,\nEmber said, each of those trees had its own name. You walked on, and after a\ntime you were walking again among familiar trees, oak and beech and ash,\nchestnut and walnut and willow, green in spring and bare in winter; there were\ndark firs, and cedar, and a tall evergreen Medra did not know, with soft\nreddish bark and layered foliage. You walked on, and the way through the trees\nwas never twice the same. People in Thwil told him it was best not to go too\nfar, since only by returning as you went could you be sure of coming out into\nthe fields.\n\n“How far does the forest go?” Medra asked, and Ember said, “As far as the mind\ngoes.”\n\nThe leaves of the trees spoke, she said, and the shadows could be read. “I am\nlearning to read them,” she said.\n\nWhen he was on Orrimy, Medra had learned to read the common writing of the\nArchipelago. Later, Highdrake of Pendor had taught him some of the runes of\npower. That was known lore. What Ember had learned alone in the Immanent Grove\nwas not known to any but those with whom she shared her knowledge. She lived\nall summer under the eaves of the Grove, having no more than a box to keep the\nmice and wood rats from her small store of food, a shelter of branches, and a\ncook fire near a stream that came out of the woods to join the little river\nrunning down to the bay, Medra camped nearby. He did not know what Ember\nwanted of him; he hoped she meant to teach him, to begin to answer his\nquestions about the Grove. But she said nothing, and he was shy and cautious,\nfearing to intrude on her solitude, which daunted him as did the strangeness\nof the Grove itself. The second day he was there, she told him to come with\nher and led him very far into the wood. They walked for hours in silence. In\nthe summer midday the woods were silent. No bird sang. The leaves did not\nstir. The aisles of the trees were endlessly different and all the same. He\ndid not know when they turned back, but he knew they had walked farther than\nthe shores of Roke.\n\nThey came out again among the ploughlands and pastures in the warm evening. As\nthey walked back to their camping place he saw the four stars of the Forge\ncome out above the western hills.\n\nEmber parted from him with only a “Good night.”\n\nThe next day she said, “I’m going to sit under the trees.” Not sure what was\nexpected of him, he followed her at a distance till they came to the inmost\npart of the Grove where all the trees were of the same kind, nameless yet each\nwith its own name. When she sat down on the soft leaf mold between the roots\nof a big old tree, he found himself a place not far away to sit; and as she\nwatched and listened and was still, he watched and listened and was still. So\nthey did for several days. Then one morning, in rebellious mood, he stayed by\nthe stream while Ember walked into the Grove. She did not look back.\n\nVeil came from Thwil Town that morning, bringing them a basket of bread,\ncheese, milk curds, summer fruits. “What have you learned?” she asked Medra in\nher cool, gentle way, and he answered, “That I’m a fool.”\n\n“Why so, Tern?”\n\n“A fool could sit under the trees forever and grow no wiser.”\n\nThe tall woman smiled a little. “My sister has never taught a man before” she\nsaid. She glanced at him, and gazed away, over the summery fields. “She’s\nnever looked at a man before,” she said.\n\nMedra stood silent. His face felt hot. He looked down. “I thought,” he said,\nand stopped.\n\nIn Veil’s words he saw, all at once, the other side of Ember’s impatience, her\nfierceness, her silences.\n\nHe had tried to look at Ember as untouchable while he longed to touch her soft\nbrown skin, her black shining hair. When she stared at him in sudden\nincomprehensible challenge he had thought her angry with him. He feared to\ninsult, to offend her. What did she fear? His desire? Her own?- But she was\nnot an inexperienced girl, she was a wise woman, a mage, she who walked in the\nImmanent Grove and understood the patterns of the shadows!\n\nAll this went rushing through his mind like a flood breaking through a dam,\nwhile he stood at the edge of the woods with Veil. “I thought mages kept\nthemselves apart,” he said at last. “High-drake said that to make love is to\nunmake power.”\n\n“So some wise men say,” said Veil mildly, and smiled again, and bade him\ngoodbye.\n\nHe spent the whole afternoon in confusion, angry. When Ember came out of the\nGrove to her leafy bower upstream, he went there, carrying Veil’s basket as an\nexcuse. “May I talk to you?” he said.\n\nShe nodded shortly, frowning her black brows.\n\nHe said nothing. She squatted down to find out what was in the basket.\n“Peaches!” she said, and smiled.\n\n“My master Highdrake said that wizards who make love unmake their power,” he\nblurted out.\n\nShe said nothing, laying out what was in the basket, dividing it for the two\nof them.\n\n“Do you think that’s true?” he asked.\n\nShe shrugged. “No,” she said.\n\nHe stood tongue-tied. After a while she looked up at him. “No,” she said in a\nsoft, quiet voice, “I don’t think it’s true. I think all the true powers, all\nthe old powers, at root are one.”\n\nHe still stood there, and she said, “Look at the peaches! They’re all ripe.\nWe’ll have to eat them right away.”\n\n“If I told you my name,” he said, “my true name-“\n\n“I’d tell you mine,” she said. “If that... if that’s how we should begin.”\n\nThey began, however, with the peaches.\n\nThey were both shy. When Medra took her hand his hand shook, and Ember, whose\nname was Elehal, turned away scowling. Then she touched his hand very lightly.\nWhen he stroked the sleek black flow of her hair she seemed only to endure his\ntouch, and he stopped. When he tried to embrace her she was stiff, rejecting\nhim. Then she turned and, fierce, hasty, awkward, seized him in her arms. It\nwasn’t the first night, nor the first nights, they passed together that gave\neither of them much pleasure or ease. But they learned from each other, and\ncame through shame and fear into passion. Then their long days in the silence\nof the woods and their long, starlit nights were joy to them.\n\nWhen Veil came up from town to bring them the last of the late peaches, they\nlaughed; peaches were the very emblem of their happiness. They tried to make\nher stay and eat supper with them, but she wouldn’t. “Stay here while you\ncan,” she said.\n\nThe summer ended too soon that year. Rain came early; snow fell in autumn even\nas far south as Roke. Storm followed storm, as if the winds had risen in rage\nagainst the tampering and meddling of the crafty men. Women sat together by\nthe fire in the lonely farmhouses; people gathered round the hearths in Thwil\nTown. They listened to the wind blow and the rain beat or the silence of the\nsnow. Outside Thwil Bay the sea thundered on the reefs and on the cliffs all\nround the shores of the island, a sea no boat could venture out in.\n\nWhat they had they shared. In that it was indeed Morred’s Isle. Nobody on Roke\nstarved or went unhoused, though nobody had much more than they needed. Hidden\nfrom the rest of the world not only by sea and storm but by their defenses\nthat disguised the island and sent ships astray, they worked and talked and\nsang the songs, The Winter Carol and The Deed of the Young King. And they had\nbooks, the Chronicles of Enlad and the History of the Wise Heroes. From these\nprecious books the old men and women would read aloud in a hall down by the\nwharf where the fisherwomen made and mended their nets. There was a hearth\nthere, and they would light the fire. People came even from farms across the\nisland to hear the histories read, listening in silence, intent. “Our souls\nare hungry,” Ember said.\n\nShe lived with Medra in his small house not far from the Net House, though she\nspent many days with her sister Veil. Ember and Veil had been little children\non a farm near Thwil when the raiders came from Wathort. Their mother hid them\nin a root cellar of the farm and then used her spells to try to defend her\nhusband and brothers, who would not hide but fought the raiders. They were\nbutchered with their cattle. The house and barns were burnt. The little girls\nstayed in the root cellar that night and the nights after. Neighbors who came\nat last to bury the rotting bodies found the two children, silent, starving,\narmed with a mattock and a broken ploughshare, ready to defend the heaps of\nstones and earth they had piled over their dead.\n\nMedra knew only a hint of this story from Ember. One night Veil, who was three\nyears older than Ember and to whom the memory was much clearer, told it to him\nfully. Ember sat with them, listening in silence.\n\nIn return he told Veil and Ember about the mines of Samory, and the wizard\nGelluk, and Anieb the slave.\n\nWhen he was done Veil was silent a long time and then said, “That was what you\nmeant, when you came here first-I could not save the one who saved me.”\n\n“And you asked me, What can you tell me that could make me trust you?”\n\n“You have told me,” Veil said.\n\nMedra took her hand and put his forehead against it. Telling his story he had\nkept back tears. He could not do so now.\n\n“She gave me freedom,” he said. “And I still feel that all I do is done\nthrough her and for her. No, not for her. We can do nothing for the dead. But\nfor...”\n\n“For us,” said Ember. “For us who live, in hiding, neither killed nor killing.\nThe dead are dead. The great and mighty go their way unchecked. All the hope\nleft in the world is in the people of no account.”\n\n“Must we hide forever?”\n\n“Spoken like a man,” said Veil with her gentle, wounded smile.\n\n“Yes,” said Ember. “We must hide, and forever if need be. Because there’s\nnothing left but being killed and killing, beyond these shores. You say it,\nand I believe it.”\n\n“But you can’t hide true power,” Medra said. “Not for long. It dies in hiding,\nunshared.”\n\n“Magic won’t die on Roke,” said Veil. “On Roke all spells are strong. So said\nAth himself. And you have walked under the trees... Our job must be to keep\nthat strength. Hide it, yes. Hoard it, as a young dragon hoards up its fire.\nAnd share it. But only here. Pass it on, one to the next, here, where it’s\nsafe, and where the great robbers and killers would least look for it, since\nno one here is of any account. And one day the dragon will come into its\nstrength. If it takes a thousand years...”\n\n“But outside Roke,” said Medra, “there are common people who slave and starve\nand die in misery. Must they do so for a thousand years with no hope?”\n\nHe looked from one sister to the other: the one so mild and so immovable, the\nother, under her sternness, quick and tender as the first flame of a catching\nfire.\n\n“On Havnor,” he said,” far from Roke, in a village on Mount Onn, among people\nwho know nothing of the world, there are still women of the Hand. That net\nhasn’t broken after so many years. How was it woven?”\n\n“Craftily,” said Ember.\n\n“And cast wide!” He looked from one to the other again. “I wasn’t well taught,\nin the City of Havnor,” he said. “My teachers told me not to use magic to bad\nends, but they lived in fear and had no strength against the strong. They gave\nme all they had to give, but it was little. It was by mere luck I didn’t go\nwrong. And by Anieb’s gift of strength to me. But for her I’d be Gelluk’s\nservant now. Yet she herself was untaught, and so enslaved. If wizardry is ill\ntaught by the best, and used for evil ends by the mighty, how will our\nstrength here ever grow? What will the young dragon feed on?”\n\n“This is the center,” said Veil. “We must keep to the center. And wait.”\n\n“We must give what we have to give,” said Medra. “If all but us are slaves,\nwhat’s our freedom worth?”\n\n“The true art prevails over the false. The pattern will hold,” Ember said,\nfrowning. She reached out the poker to gather together her namesakes in the\nhearth, and with a whack knocked the heap into a blaze. “That I know. But our\nlives are short, and the patterns very long. If only Roke was now what it once\nwas- if we had more people of the true art gathered here, teaching and\nlearning as well as preserving-“\n\n“If Roke was now what it once was, known to be strong, those who fear us would\ncome again to destroy us,” said Veil.\n\n“The solution lies in secrecy,” said Medra. “But so does the problem.”\n\n“Our problem is with men,” Veil said, “if you’ll forgive me, dear brother. Men\nare of more account to other men than women and children are. We might have\nfifty witches here and they’ll pay little heed. But if they knew we had five\nmen of power, they’d seek to destroy us again.”\n\n“So though there were men among us we were the women of the Hand,” said Ember.\n\n“You still are,” Medra said. “Anieb was one of you. She and you and all of us\nlive in the same prison.”\n\n“What can we do?” said Veil.\n\n“Learn our strength!” said Medra.\n\n“A school,” Ember said. “Where the wise might come to learn from one another,\nto study the pattern...The Grove would shelter us.”\n\n“The lords of war despise scholars and schoolmasters,” said Medra.\n\n“I think they fear them too,” said Veil.\n\nSo they talked, that long winter, and others talked with them. Slowly their\ntalk turned from vision to intention, from longing to planning. Veil was\nalways cautious, warning of dangers. White-haired Dune was so eager that Ember\nsaid he wanted to start teaching sorcery to every child in Thwil. Once Ember\nhad come to believe that Roke’s freedom lay in offering others freedom, she\nset her whole mind on how the women of the Hand might grow strong again. But\nher mind, formed by her long solitudes among the trees, always sought form and\nclarity, and she said, “How can we teach our art when we don’t know what it\nis?”\n\nAnd they talked about that, all the wise women of the island: what was the\ntrue art of magic, and where did it turn false; how the balance of things was\nkept or lost; what crafts were needful, which useful, which dangerous; why\nsome people had one gift but not another, and whether you could learn an art\nyou had no native gift for. In such discussions they worked out the names that\never since have been given to the masteries: finding, weather-working,\nchanging, healing, summoning, patterning, naming, and the crafts of illusion,\nand the knowledge of the songs. Those are the arts of the Masters of Roke even\nnow, though the Chanter took the Finder’s place when finding came to be\nconsidered a merely useful craft unworthy of a mage.\n\nAnd it was in these discussions that the school on Roke began.\n\nThere are some who say that the school had its beginnings far differently.\nThey say that Roke used to be ruled by a woman called the Dark Woman, who was\nin league with the Old Powers of the earth. They say she lived in a cave under\nRoke Knoll, never coming into the daylight, but weaving vast spells over land\nand sea that compelled men to her evil will, until the first Archmage came to\nRoke, unsealed and entered the cave, defeated the Dark Woman, and took her\nplace.\n\nThere’s no truth in this tale but one, which is that indeed one of the first\nMasters of Roke opened and entered a great cavern. But though the roots of\nRoke are the roots of all the islands, that cavern was not on Roke.\n\nAnd it’s true that in the time of Medra and Elehal the people of Roke, men and\nwomen, had no fear of the Old Powers of the earth, but revered them, seeking\nstrength and vision from them. That changed with the years.\n\nSpring came late again that year, cold and stormy. Medra set to boat-building.\nBy the time the peaches flowered, he had made a slender, sturdy deep-sea boat,\nbuilt according to the style of Havnor. He called her Hopeful. Not long after\nthat he sailed her out of Thwil Bay, taking no companion with him. “Look for\nme at the end of summer,” he said to Ember.\n\n“I’ll be in the Grove,” she said. “And my heart with you, my dark otter, my\nwhite tern, my love, Medra.”\n\n“And mine with you, my ember of fire, my flowering tree, my love, Elehal.”\n\nOn the first of his voyages of finding, Medra, or Tern as he was called,\nsailed northward up the Inmost Sea to Orrimy, where he had been some years\nbefore. There were people of the Hand there whom he trusted. One of them was a\nman called Crow, a wealthy recluse, who had no gift of magic but a great\npassion for what was written, for books of lore and history. It was Crow who\nhad, as he said, stuck Tern’s nose into a book till he could read it.\n“Illiterate wizards are the curse of Earthsea!” he cried. “Ignorant power is a\nbane!” Crow was a strange man, willful, arrogant, obstinate, and, in defense\nof his passion, brave. He had defied Losen’s power, years before, going to the\nPort of Havnor in disguise and coming away with four books from an ancient\nroyal library. He had just obtained, and was vastly proud of, an arcane\ntreatise from Way concerning quicksilver. “Got that from under Losen’s nose\ntoo,” he said to Tern. “Come have a look at it! It belonged to a famous\nwizard.”\n\n“Tinaral,” said Tern. “I knew him.”\n\n“Book’s trash, is it?” said Crow, who was quick to pick up signals if they had\nto do with books.\n\n“I don’t know. I’m after bigger prey.”\n\nCrow cocked his head.\n\n“The Book of Names.”\n\n“Lost with Ath when he went into the west,” Crow said.\n\n“A mage called Highdrake told me that when Ath stayed in Pendor, he told a\nwizard there that he’d left the Book of Names with a woman in the Ninety Isles\nfor safekeeping.”\n\n“A woman! For safekeeping! In the Ninety Isles! Was he mad?”\n\nCrow ranted, but at the mere thought that the Book of Names might still exist\nhe was ready to set off for the Ninety Isles as soon as Tern liked.\n\nSo they sailed south in Hopeful, landing first at malodorous Geath, and then\nin the guise of peddlers working their way from one islet to the next among\nthe mazy channels. Crow had stocked the boat with better wares than most\nhouseholders of the Isles were used to seeing, and Tern offered them at fair\nprices, mostly in barter, since there was little money among the islanders.\nTheir popularity ran ahead of them. It was known that they would trade for\nbooks, if the books were old and uncanny. But in the Isles all books were old\nand all uncanny, what there was of them.\n\nCrow was delighted to get a water-stained bestiary from the time of Akambar in\nreturn for five silver buttons, a pearl-hiked knife, and a square of Lorbanery\nsilk. He sat in Hopeful and crooned over the antique descriptions of harikki\nand otak and icebear. But Tern went ashore on every isle, showing his wares in\nthe kitchens of the housewives and the sleepy taverns where the old men sat.\nSometimes he idly made a fist and then turned his hand over opening the palm,\nbut nobody here returned the sign.\n\n“Books?” said a rush plaiter on North Sudidi. “Like that there?” He pointed to\nlong strips of vellum that had been worked into the thatching of his house.\n“They good for something else?” Crow, staring up at the words visible here and\nthere between the rushes in the eaves, began to tremble with rage. Tern\nhurried him back to the boat before he exploded.\n\n“It was only a beast healer’s manual,” Crow admitted, when they were sailing\non and he had calmed down. “’Spavined,” I saw, and something about ewes’\nudders. But the ignorance! the brute ignorance! To roof his house with it!”\n\n“And it was useful knowledge,” Tern said. “How can people be anything but\nignorant when knowledge isn’t saved, isn’t taught? If books could be brought\ntogether in one place...”\n\n“Like the Library of the Kings,” said Crow, dreaming of lost glories.\n\n“Or your library,” said Tern, who had become a subtler man than he used to be.\n\n“Fragments,” Crow said, dismissing his life’s work. “Remnants!”\n\n“Beginnings,” said Tern.\n\nCrow only sighed.\n\n“I think we might go south again,” Tern said, steering for the open channel.\n“Towards Pody.”\n\n“You have a gift for the business,” Crow said. “You know where to look. Went\nstraight to that bestiary in the barn loft... But there’s nothing much to look\nfor here. Nothing of importance. Ath wouldn’t have left the greatest of all\nthe lore-books among boors who’d make thatch of it! Take us to Pody if you\nlike. And then back to Orrimy. I’ve had about enough.”\n\n“And we’re out of buttons,” Tern said. He was cheerful; as soon as he had\nthought of Pody he knew he was going in the right direction. “Perhaps I can\nfind some along the way,” he said. “It’s my gift, you know.”\n\nNeither of them had been on Pody. It was a sleepy southern island with a\npretty old port town, Telio, built of rosy sandstone, and fields and orchards\nthat should have been fertile. But the lords of Wathort had ruled it for a\ncentury, taxing and slave taking and wearing the land and people down. The\nsunny streets of Telio were sad and dirty. People lived in them as in the\nwilderness, in tents and lean-tos made of scraps, or shelterless. “Oh, this\nwon’t do,” Crow said, disgusted, avoiding a pile of human excrement. “These\ncreatures don’t have books, Tern!”\n\n“Wait, wait,” his companion said. “Give me a day.”\n\n“It’s dangerous,” Crow said, “it’s pointless,” but he made no further\nobjection. The modest, naive young man whom he had taught to read had become\nhis unfathomable guide.\n\nHe followed him down one of the principal streets and from it into a district\nof small houses, the old weavers’ quarter. They grew flax on Pody, and there\nwere stone retting houses, now mostly unused, and looms to be seen by the\nwindows of some of the houses. In a little square where there was shade from\nthe hot sun four or five women sat spinning by a well. Children played nearby,\nlistless with the heat, scrawny, staring without much interest at the\nstrangers. Tern had walked there unhesitating, as if he knew where he was\ngoing. Now he stopped and greeted the women.\n\n“Oh, pretty man,” said one of them with a smile, “don’t even show us what you\nhave in your pack there, for I haven’t a penny of copper or ivory, nor seen\none for a month.”\n\n“You might have a bit of linen, though, mistress? woven, or thread? Linen of\nPody is the best-so I’ve heard as far as Havnor. And I can tell the quality of\nwhat you’re spinning. A beautiful thread it is.” Crow watched his companion\nwith amusement and some disdain; he himself could bargain for a book very\nshrewdly, but nattering with common women about buttons and thread was beneath\nhim. “Let me just open this up,” Tern was saying as he spread his pack out on\nthe cobbles, and the women and the dirty, timid children drew closer to see\nthe wonders he would show them. “Woven cloth we’re looking for, and the undyed\nthread, and other things too-buttons we’re short of. If you had any of horn or\nbone, maybe? I’d trade one of these little velvet caps here for three or four\nbuttons. Or one of these rolls of ribbon; look at the color of it. Beautiful\nwith your hair, mistress! Or paper, or books. Our masters in Orrimy are\nseeking such things, if you had any put away, maybe.”\n\n“Oh, you are a pretty man,” said the woman who had spoken first, laughing, as\nhe held the red ribbon up to her black braid. “And I wish I had something for\nyou!”\n\n“I won’t be so bold as to ask for a kiss,” said Medra, “but an open hand,\nmaybe?”\n\nHe made the sign; she looked at him for a moment. “That’s easy,” she said\nsoftly, and made the sign in return, “but not always safe, among strangers.”\n\nHe went on showing his wares and joking with the women and children. Nobody\nbought anything. They gazed at the trinkets as if they were treasures. He let\nthem gaze and finger all they would; indeed he let one of the children filch a\nlittle mirror of polished brass, seeing it vanish under the ragged shirt and\nsaying nothing. At last he said he must go on, and the children drifted away\nas he folded up his pack.\n\n“I have a neighbor,” said the black-braided woman, “who might have some paper,\nif you’re after that.”\n\n“Written on?” said Crow, who had been sitting on the well coping, bored.\n“Marks on it?”\n\nShe looked him up and down. “Marks on it, sir,” she said. And then, to Tern,\nin a different tone, “If you’d like to come with me, she lives this way. And\nthough she’s only a girl, and poor, I’ll tell you, peddler, she has an open\nhand. Though perhaps not all of us do.”\n\n“Three out of three,” said Crow, sketching the sign, “so spare your vinegar,\nwoman.”\n\n“Oh, it’s you who have it to spare, sir. We’re poor folk here. And ignorant,”\nshe said, with a flash of her eyes, and led on.\n\nShe brought them to a house at the end of a lane. It had been a handsome place\nonce, two stories built of stone, but was half empty, defaced, window frames\nand facing stones pulled out of it. They crossed a courtyard with a well in\nit. She knocked at a side door, and a girl opened it.\n\n“Ach, it’s a witch’s den,” Crow said, at the whiff of herbs and aromatic\nsmoke, and he stepped back.\n\n“Healers,” their guide said. “Is she ill again, Dory?”\n\nThe girl nodded, looking at Tern, then at Crow. She was thirteen or fourteen,\nheavyset though thin, with a sullen, steady gaze.\n\n“They’re men of the Hand, Dory, one short and pretty and one tall and proud,\nand they say they’re seeking papers. I know you had some once, though you may\nnot now. They’ve nothing you need in their pack, but it might be they’d pay a\nbit of ivory for what they want. Is it so?” She turned her bright eyes on\nTern, and he nodded.\n\n“She’s very sick, Rush,” the girl said. She looked again at Tern. “You’re not\na healer?” It was an accusation.\n\n“No.”\n\n“She is,” said Rush. “Like her mother and her mother’s mother. Let us in,\nDory, or me at least, to speak to her.” The girl went back in for a moment,\nand Rush said to Medra, “It’s consumption her mother’s dying of. No healer\ncould cure her. But she could heal the scrofula, and touch for pain. A wonder\nshe was, and Dory bade fair to follow her.”\n\nThe girl motioned them to come in. Crow chose to wait outside. The room was\nhigh and long, with traces of former elegance, but very old and very poor.\nHealers’ paraphernalia and drying herbs were everywhere, though ranged in some\norder. Near the fine stone fireplace, where a tiny wisp of sweet herbs burned,\nwas a bedstead. The woman in it was so wasted that in the dim light she seemed\nnothing but bone and shadow. As Tern came close she tried to sit up and to\nspeak. Her daughter raised her head on the pillow, and when Tern was very near\nhe could hear her: “Wizard,” she said. “Not by chance.”\n\nA woman of power, she knew what he was. Had she called him there?\n\n“I’m a finder,” he said. “And a seeker.”\n\n“Can you teach her?”\n\n“I can take her to those who can.”\n\n“Do it.”\n\n“I will.”\n\nShe laid her head back and closed her eyes.\n\nShaken by the intensity of that will, Tern straightened up and drew a deep\nbreath. He looked round at the girl, Dory. She did not return his gaze,\nwatching her mother with stolid, sullen grief. Only after the woman sank into\nsleep did Dory move, going to help Rush, who as a friend and neighbor had made\nherself useful and was gathering up blood-soaked cloths scattered by the bed.\n\n“She bled again just now, and I couldn’t stop it,” Dory said. Tears ran out of\nher eyes and down her cheeks. Her face hardly changed.\n\n“Oh child, oh lamb,” said Rush, taking her into her embrace; but though she\nhugged Rush, Dory did not bend.\n\n“She’s going there, to the wall, and I can’t go with her,” she said. “She’s\ngoing alone and I can’t go with her- Can’t you go there?” She broke away from\nRush, looking again at Tern. “You can go there!”\n\n“No,” he said. “I don’t know the way.”\n\nYet as Dory spoke he saw what the girl saw: a long hill going down into\ndarkness, and across it, on the edge of twilight, a low wall of stones. And as\nhe looked he thought he saw a woman walking along beside the wall, very thin,\ninsubstantial, bone, shadow. But she was not the dying woman in the bed. She\nwas Anieb.\n\nThen that was gone and he stood facing the witch-girl. Her look of accusation\nslowly changed. She put her face in her hands.\n\n“We have to let them go,” he said.\n\nShe said, “I know.”\n\nRush glanced from one to the other with her keen, bright eyes. “Not only a\nhandy man,” she said, “but a crafty man. Well, you’re not the first.”\n\nHe looked his question.\n\n“This is called Ath’s House,” she said.\n\n“He lived here,” Dory said, a glimmer of pride breaking a moment through her\nhelpless pain. “The Mage Ath. Long ago. Before he went into the west. All my\nforemothers were wise women. He stayed here. With them.”\n\n“Give me a basin,” Rush said. “I’ll get water to soak these.”\n\n“I’ll get the water,” Tern said. He took the basin and went out to the\ncourtyard, to the well. Just as before, Crow was sitting on the coping, bored\nand restless.\n\n“Why are we wasting time here?” he demanded, as Tern let the bucket down into\nthe well. “Are you fetching and carrying for witches now?”\n\n“Yes,” Tern said, “and I will till she dies. And then I’ll take her daughter\nto Roke. And if you want to read the Book of Names, you can come with us.”\n\nSo the school on Roke got its first student from across the sea, together with\nits first librarian. The Book of Names, which is kept now in the Isolate\nTower, was the foundation of the knowledge and method of Naming, which is the\nfoundation of the magic of Roke. The girl Dory, who as they said taught her\nteachers, became the mistress of all healing arts and the science of herbals,\nand established that mastery in high honor at Roke.\n\nAs for Crow, unable to part with the Book of Names even for a month, he sent\nfor his own books from Orrimy and settled down with them in Thwil. He allowed\npeople of the school to study them, so long as they showed them, and him, due\nrespect.\n\nSo the pattern of the years was set for Tern. In the late spring he would go\nout in Hopeful, seeking and finding people for the school on Roke-children and\nyoung people, mostly, who had a gift of magic, and sometimes grown men or\nwomen. Most of the children were poor, and though he took none against their\nwill, their parents or masters seldom knew the truth: Tern was a fisherman\nwanting a boy to work on his boat, or a girl to train in the weaving sheds, or\nhe was buying slaves for his lord on another island. If they sent a child with\nhim to give it opportunity, or sold a child out of poverty to work for him, he\npaid them in true ivory; if they sold a child to him as a slave, he paid them\nin gold, and was gone by the next day, when the gold turned back into cow\ndung.\n\nHe traveled far in the Archipelago, even out into the East Reach. He never\nwent to the same town or island twice without years between, letting his trail\ngrow cold. Even so he began to be spoken of. The Child Taker, they called him,\na dreaded sorcerer who carried children to his island in the icy north and\nthere sucked their blood. In villages on Way and Feikway they still tell\nchildren about the Child Taker, as an encouragement to distrust strangers.\n\nBy that time there were many people of the Hand who knew what was afoot on\nRoke. Young people came there sent by them. Men and women came to be taught\nand to teach. Many of these had a hard time getting there, for the spells that\nhid the island were stronger than ever, making it seem only a cloud, or a reef\namong the breakers; and the Roke wind blew, which kept any ship from Thwil Bay\nunless there was a sorcerer aboard who knew how to turn that wind. Still they\ncame, and as the years went on a larger house was needed for the school than\nany in Thwil Town.\n\nIn the Archipelago, men built ships and women built houses, that was the\ncustom; but in building a great structure women let men work with them, not\nhaving the miners’ superstitions that kept men out of the mines, or the\nshipwrights’ that forbade women to watch a keel laid. So both men and women of\ngreat power raised the Great House on Roke. Its cornerstone was set on a\nhilltop above Thwil Town, near the Grove and looking to the Knoll. Its walls\nwere built not only of stone and wood, but founded deep on magic and made\nstrong with spells.\n\nStanding on that hill, Medra had said, “There is a vein of water, just under\nwhere I stand, that will not go dry.” They dug down carefully and came to the\nwater; they let it leap up into the sunlight; and the first part of the Great\nHouse they made was its inmost heart, the courtyard of the fountain.\n\nThere Medra walked with Elehal, on the white pavement, before there were any\nwalls built round it.\n\nShe had planted a young rowan from the Grove beside the fountain. They came to\nbe sure it was thriving. The spring wind blew strong, seaward, off Roke Knoll,\nblowing the water of the fountain astray. Up on the slope of the Knoll they\ncould see a little group of people: a circle of young students learning how to\ndo tricks of illusion from the sorcerer Hega of O; Master Hand, they called\nhim. The sparkweed, past flowering, cast its ashes on the wind. There were\nstreaks of grey in Ember’s hair.\n\n“Off you go, then,” she said, “and leave us to settle this matter of the\nRule.” Her frown was as fierce as ever, but her voice was seldom as harsh as\nthis when she spoke to him.\n\n“I’ll stay if you want, Elehal.”\n\n“I do want you to stay. But don’t stay! You’re a finder, you have to go find.\nIt’s only that agreeing on the Way-or the Rule, Waris wants us to call it-is\ntwice the work of building the House. And causes ten times the quarrels. I\nwish I could get away from it! I wish I could just walk with you, like this...\nAnd I wish you wouldn’t go north.”\n\n“Why do we quarrel?” he said rather despondently.\n\n“Because there are more of us! Gather twenty or thirty people of power in a\nroom, they’ll each seek to have their way. And you put men who’ve always had\ntheir way together with women who’ve had theirs, and they’ll resent one\nanother. And then, too, there are some true and real divisions among us,\nMedra. They must be settled, and they can’t be settled easily. Though a little\ngoodwill would go a long way.”\n\n“Is it Waris?”\n\n“Waris and several other men. And they are men, and they make that important\nbeyond anything else. To them, the Old Powers are abominable. And women’s\npowers are suspect, because they suppose them all connected with the Old\nPowers. As if those Powers were to be controlled or used by any mortal soul!\nBut they put men where we put the world. And so they hold that a true wizard\nmust be a man. And celibate.”\n\n“Ah, that,” Medra said, rueful.\n\n“That indeed. My sister told me last night, she and Ennio and the carpenters\nhave offered to build them a part of the House that will be all their own, or\neven a separate house, so they can keep themselves pure.”\n\n“Pure?”\n\n“It’s not my word, it’s Waris’s. But they’ve refused. They want the Rule of\nRoke to separate men from women, and they want men to make the decisions for\nall. Now what compromise can we make with them? Why did they come here, if\nthey won’t work with us?”\n\n“We should send away the men who won’t.”\n\n“Away? In anger? To tell the Lords of Wathort or Havnor that witches on Roke\nare brewing a storm?”\n\n“I forget-I always forget,” he said, downcast again. “I forget the walls of\nthe prison. I’m not such a fool when I’m outside them... When I’m here I can’t\nbelieve it is a prison. But outside, without you, I remember... I don’t want\nto go, but I have to go. I don’t want to admit that anything here can be wrong\nor go wrong, but I have to... I’ll go this time, and I will go north, Elehal.\nBut when I come back I’ll stay. What I need to find I’ll find here. Haven’t I\nfound it already?”\n\n“No,” she said, “only me... But there’s a great deal of seeking and finding to\nbe done in the Grove. Enough to keep even you from being restless. Why north?”\n\n“To reach out the Hand to Enlad and Ea. I’ve never gone there. We know nothing\nabout their wizardries. Enlad of the Kings, and bright Ea, eldest of isles!\nSurely we’ll find allies there”\n\n“But Havnor lies between us,” she said.\n\n“I won’t sail my boat across Havnor, dear love. I plan to go around it. By\nwater.” He could always make her laugh; he was the only one who could. When he\nwas away, she was quiet-voiced and even-tempered, having learned the\nuselessness of impatience in the work that must be done. Sometimes she still\nscowled, sometimes she smiled, but she did not laugh. When she could, she went\nto the Grove alone, as she had always done. But in these years of the building\nof the House and the founding of the school, she could go there seldom, and\neven then she might take a couple of students to learn with her the ways\nthrough the forest and the patterns of the leaves; for she was the Patterner.\n\nTern left late that year on his journey. He had with him a boy of fifteen,\nMote, a promising weatherworker who needed training at sea, and Sava, a woman\nof sixty who had come to Roke with him seven or eight years before. Sava had\nbeen one of the women of the Hand on the isle of Ark. Though she had no\nwizardly gifts at all, she knew so well how to get a group of people to trust\none another and work together that she was honored as a wise woman on Ark, and\nnow on Roke. She had asked Tern to take her to see her family, mother and\nsister and two sons; he would leave Mote with her and bring them back to Roke\nwhen he returned. So they set off northeast across the Inmost Sea in the\nsummer weather, and Tern told Mote to put a bit of magewind into their sail,\nso that they would be sure to reach Ark before the Long Dance.\n\nAs they coasted that island, he himself put an illusion about Hopeful, so that\nshe would seem not a boat but a drifting log; for pirates and Losen’s slave\ntakers were thick in these waters.\n\nFrom Sesesry on the east coast of Ark where he left his passengers, having\ndanced the Long Dance there, he sailed up the Ebavnor Straits, intending to\nhead west along the south shores of Omer. He kept the illusion spell about his\nboat. In the brilliant clarity of midsummer, with a north wind blowing, he\nsaw, high and far above the blue strait and the vaguer blue-brown of the land,\nthe long ridges and the weightless dome of Mount Onn.\n\nLook, Medra. Look!\n\nIt was Havnor, his land, where his people were, whether alive or dead he did\nnot know; where Anieb lay in her grave, up there on the mountain. He had never\nbeen back, never come this close. It had been how long? Sixteen years,\nseventeen years. Nobody would know him, nobody would remember the boy Otter,\nexcept Otter’s mother and father and sister, if they were still alive. And\nsurely there were people of the Hand in the Great Port. Though he had not\nknown of them as a boy, he should know them now.\n\nHe sailed up the broad straits till Mount Onn was hidden by the headlands at\nthe mouth of the Bay of Havnor. He would not see it again unless he went\nthrough that narrow passage. Then he would see the mountain, all the sweep and\ncresting of it, over the calm waters where he used to try to raise up the\nmagewind when he was twelve; and sailing on he would see the towers rise up\nfrom the water, dim at first, mere dots and lines, then lifting up their\nbright banners, the white city at the center of the world.\n\nIt was mere cowardice to keep from Havnor, now-fear for his skin, fear lest he\nfind his people had died, fear lest he recall Anieb too vividly.\n\nFor there had been times when he felt that, as he had summoned her living, so\ndead she might summon him. The bond between them that had linked them and let\nher save him was not broken. Many times she had come into his dreams, standing\nsilent as she stood when he first saw her in the reeking tower at Samory. And\nhe had seen her, years ago, in the vision of the dying healer in Telio, in the\ntwilight, beside the wall of stones.\n\nHe knew now, from Elehal and others on Roke, what that wall was. It lay\nbetween the living and the dead. And in that vision, Anieb had walked on this\nside of it, not on the side that went down into the dark.\n\nDid he fear her, who had freed him?\n\nHe tacked across the strong wind, swung round South Point, and sailed into the\nGreat Bay of Havnor.\n\nBanners still flew from the towers of the City of Havnor, and a king still\nruled there; the banners were those of captured towns and isles, and the king\nwas the warlord Losen. Losen never left the marble palace where he sat all\nday, served by slaves, seeing the shadow of the sword of Erreth-Akbe slip like\nthe shadow of a great sundial across the roofs below. He gave orders, and the\nslaves said, “It is done, your majesty.” He held audiences, and old men came\nand said, “We obey, your majesty.” He summoned his wizards, and the mage Early\ncame, bowing low. “Make me walk!” Losen shouted, beating his paralyzed legs\nwith his weak hands.\n\nThe mage said, “Majesty, as you know, my poor skill has not availed, but I\nhave sent for the greatest healer of all Earthsea, who lives in far Narveduen,\nand when he comes, your highness will surely walk again, yes, and dance the\nLong Dance.”\n\nThen Losen cursed and cried, and his slaves brought him wine, and the mage\nwent out, bowing, and checking as he went to be sure that the spell of\nparalysis was holding.\n\nIt was far more convenient to him that Losen should be king than that he\nhimself should rule Havnor openly. Men of arms didn’t trust men of craft and\ndidn’t like to serve them. No matter what a mage’s powers, unless he was as\nmighty as the Enemy of Morred, he couldn’t hold armies and fleets together if\nthe soldiers and sailors chose not to obey. People were in the habit of\nfearing and obeying Losen, an old habit now, and well learned. They credited\nhim with the powers he had had of bold strategy, firm leadership, and utter\ncruelty; and they credited him with powers he had never had, such as mastery\nover the wizards who served him.\n\nThere were no wizards serving Losen now except Early and a couple of humble\nsorcerers. Early had driven off or killed, one after another, his rivals for\nLosen’s favor, and had enjoyed sole rule over all Havnor now for years.\n\nWhen he was Gelluk’s prentice and assistant, he had encouraged his master in\nthe study of the lore of Way, finding himself free while Gelluk was off doting\non his quicksilver. But Gelluk’s abrupt fate had shaken him. There was\nsomething mysterious in it, some element or some person missing. Summoning the\nuseful Hound to help him, Early had made a very thorough inquiry into what\nhappened. Where Gelluk was, of course, was no mystery. Hound had tracked him\nstraight to a scar in a hillside, and said he was buried deep under there.\nEarly had no wish to exhume him. But the boy who had been with him, Hound\ncould not track: could not say whether he was under that hill with Gelluk, or\nhad got clean away. He had left no spell traces as the mage did, said Hound,\nand it had rained very hard all the night after, and when Hound thought he had\nfound the boy’s tracks, they were a woman’s; and she was dead.\n\nEarly did not punish Hound for his failure, but he remembered it. He was not\nused to failures and did not like them. He did not like what Hound told him\nabout this boy, Otter, and he remembered it.\n\nThe desire for power feeds off itself, growing as it devours. Early suffered\nfrom hunger. He starved. There was little satisfaction in ruling Havnor, a\nland of beggars and poor farmers. What was the good of possessing the Throne\nof Maharion if nobody sat in it but a drunken cripple? What glory was there in\nthe palaces of the city when nobody lived in them but crawling slaves? He\ncould have any woman he wanted, but women would drain his power, suck away his\nstrength. He wanted no woman near him. He craved an enemy: an opponent worth\ndestroying.\n\nHis spies had been coming to him for a year or more muttering about a secret\ninsurgency all across his realm, rebellious groups of sorcerers that called\nthemselves the Hand. Eager to find his enemy, he had one such group\ninvestigated. They turned out to be a lot of old women, midwives, carpenters,\na ditchdigger, a tinsmith’s prentice, a couple of little boys. Humiliated and\nenraged, Early had them put to death along with the man who reported them to\nhim. It was a public execution, in Losen’s name, for the crime of conspiracy\nagainst the King. There had perhaps not been enough of that kind of\nintimidation lately. But it went against his grain. He didn’t like to make a\npublic spectacle of fools who had tricked him into fearing them. He would\nrather have dealt with them in his own way, in his own time. To be nourishing,\nfear must be immediate; he needed to see people afraid of him, hear their\nterror, smell it, taste it. But since he ruled in Losen’s name, it was Losen\nwho must be feared by the armies and the peoples, and he himself must keep in\nthe background, making do with slaves and prentices.\n\nNot long since, he had sent for Hound on some business, and when it was done\nthe old man had said to him, “Did you ever hear of Roke Island?”\n\n“South and west of Kamery. The Lord of Wathort’s owned it for forty or fifty\nyears.”\n\nThough he seldom left the city, Early prided himself on his knowledge of all\nthe Archipelago, gleaned from his sailors’ reports and the marvelous ancient\ncharts kept in the palace. He studied them nights, brooding on where and how\nhe might extend his empire.\n\nHound nodded, as if its location was all that had interested him in Roke.\n\n“Well?”\n\n“One of the old women you had tortured before they burned the lot, you know?\nWell, the fellow who did it told me. She talked about her son on Roke. Calling\nout to him to come, you know. But like as if he had the power to.”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Seemed odd. Old woman from a village inland, never seen the sea, calling the\nname of an island away off like that.”\n\n“The son was a fisherman who talked about his travels.”\n\nEarly waved his hand. Hound sniffed, nodded, and left.\n\nEarly never disregarded any triviality Hound mentioned, because so many of\nthem had proved not to be trivial. He disliked the old man for that, and\nbecause he was unshakable. He never praised Hound, and used him as seldom as\npossible, but Hound was too useful not to use.\n\nThe wizard kept the name Roke in his memory, and when he heard it again, and\nin the same connection, he knew Hound had been on a true track again.\n\nThree children, two boys of fifteen or sixteen and a girl of twelve, were\ntaken by one of Losen’s patrols south of Omer, running a stolen fishing boat\nwith the magewind. The patrol caught them only because it had a weatherworker\nof its own aboard, who raised a wave to swamp the stolen boat. Taken back to\nOmer, one of the boys broke down and blubbered about joining the Hand. Hearing\nthat word, the men told them they would be tortured and burned, at which the\nboy cried that if they spared him he would tell them all about the Hand, and\nRoke, and the great mages of Roke.\n\n“Bring them here,” Early said to the messenger.\n\n“The girl flew away, lord,” the man said unwillingly.\n\n“Flew away?”\n\n“She took bird form. Osprey, they said. Didn’t expect that from a girl so\nyoung. Gone before they knew it.”\n\n“Bring the boys, then,” Early said with deadly patience.\n\nThey brought him one boy. The other had jumped from the ship, crossing Havnor\nBay, and been killed by a crossbow quarrel. The boy they brought was in such a\nparoxysm of terror that even Early was disgusted by him. How could he frighten\na creature already blind and beshatten with fear? He set a binding spell on\nthe boy that held him upright and immobile as a stone statue, and left him so\nfor a night and a day. Now and then he talked to the statue, telling it that\nit was a clever lad and might make a good prentice, here in the palace. Maybe\nhe could go to Roke after all, for Early was thinking of going to Roke, to\nmeet with the mages there.\n\nWhen he unbound him, the boy tried to pretend he was still stone, and would\nnot speak. Early had to go into his mind, in the way he had learned from\nGelluk long ago, when Gelluk was a true master of his art. He found out what\nhe could. Then the boy was no good for anything and had to be disposed of. It\nwas humiliating, again, to be outwitted by the very stupidity of these people;\nand all he had learned about Roke was that the Hand was there, and a school\nwhere they taught wizardry. And he had learned a man’s name.\n\nThe idea of a school for wizards made him laugh. A school for wild boars, he\nthought, a college for dragons! But that there was some kind of scheming and\ngathering together of men of power on Roke seemed probable, and the idea of\nany league or alliance of wizards appalled him more the more he thought of it.\nIt was unnatural, and could exist only under great force, the pressure of a\ndominant will-the will of a mage strong enough to hold even strong wizards in\nhis service. There was the enemy he wanted!\n\nHound was down at the door, they said. Early sent for him to come up. “Who’s\nTern?” he asked as soon as he saw the old man.\n\nWith age Hound had come to look his name, wrinkled, with a long nose and sad\neyes. He sniffed and seemed about to say he did not know, but he knew better\nthan to try to lie to Early. He sighed. “Otter,” he said. “Him that killed old\nWhiteface.”\n\n“Where’s he hiding?”\n\n“Not hiding at all. Went about the city, talking to people. Went to see his\nmother in Endlane, round the mountain. He’s there now.”\n\n“You should have told me at once,” Early said.\n\n“Didn’t know you were after him. I’ve been after him a long time. He fooled\nme.” Hound spoke without rancor.\n\n“He tricked and killed a great mage, my master. He’s dangerous. I want\nvengeance. Who did he talk to here? I want them. Then I’ll see to him.”\n\n“Some old women down by the docks. An old sorcerer. His sister.”\n\n“Get them here. Take my men.”\n\nHound sniffed, sighed, nodded.\n\nThere was not much to be got from the people his men brought to him. The same\nthing again: they belonged to the Hand, and the Hand was a league of powerful\nsorcerers on Morred’s Isle, or on Roke; and the man Otter or Tern came from\nthere, though originally from Havnor; and they held him in great respect,\nalthough he was only a finder. The sister had vanished, perhaps gone with\nOtter to Endlane, where the mother lived. Early rummaged in their cloudy,\nwitless minds, had the youngest of them tortured, and then burned them where\nLosen could sit at his window and watch. The King needed some diversions.\n\nAll this took only two days, and all the time Early was looking and probing\ntoward Endlane village, sending Hound there before him, sending his own\npresentment there to watch. When he knew where the man was he betook himself\nthere very quickly, on eagle’s wings; for Early was a great shape-changer, so\nfearless that he would take even dragon form.\n\nHe knew it was well to use caution with this man. Otter had defeated Tinaral,\nand there was this matter of Roke, There was some strength in him or with him.\nYet it was hard for Early to fear a mere finder who went about with midwives\nand the like. He could not bring himself to sneak and skulk. He struck down in\nbroad daylight in the straggling square of Endlane village, infolding his\ntalons to a man’s legs and his great wings to arms.\n\nA child ran bawling to its mammy. No one else was about. But Early turned his\nhead, still with something of the eagles quick, stiff turn, staring. Wizard\nknows wizard, and he knew which house his prey was in. He walked to it and\nflung the door open.\n\nA slight, brown man sitting at the table looked up at him.\n\nEarly raised his hand to lay the binding spell on him. His hand was stayed,\nheld immobile half lifted at his side.\n\nThis was a contest, then, a foe worth fighting! Early took a step backward and\nthen, smiling, raised both his arms outward and up, very slowly but steadily,\nunstayed by anything the other man could do.\n\nThe house vanished. No walls, no roof, nobody. Early stood on the dust of the\nvillage square in the sunshine of morning with his arms in the air.\n\nIt was only illusion, of course, but it checked him a moment in his spell, and\nthen he had to undo the illusion, bringing back the door frame around him, the\nwalls and roof beams, the gleam of light on crockery, the hearth stones, the\ntable. But nobody sat at the table. His enemy was gone.\n\nHe was angry then, very angry, a hungry man whose food is snatched from his\nhand. He summoned the man Tern to reappear, but he did not know his true name\nand had no hold of heart or mind on him. The summons went unanswered.\n\nHe strode from the house, turned, and set a fire spell on it so that it burst\ninto flames, thatch and walls and every window spouting fire. Women ran out of\nit screaming. They had been hiding no doubt in the back room; he paid them no\nattention. “Hound,” he thought. He spoke the summoning, using Hound’s true\nname, and the old man came to him as he was bound to do. He was sullen,\nthough, and said, “I was in the tavern, down the way there, you could have\nsaid my use-name and I’d have come.”\n\nEarly looked at him once. Hound’s mouth snapped shut and stayed shut.\n\n“Speak when I let you,” the wizard said. “Where is the man?”\n\nHound nodded northeastwards.\n\n“What’s there?”\n\nEarly opened Hound’s mouth and gave him voice enough to say, in a flat dead\ntone, “Samory.”\n\n“What form is he in?”\n\n“Otter,” said the flat voice.\n\nEarly laughed. “I’ll be waiting for him,” he said; his man’s legs turned to\nyellow talons, his arms to wide feathered wings, and the eagle flew up and off\nacross the wind.\n\nHound sniffed, sighed, and followed, trudging along unwillingly, while behind\nhim in the village the flames died down, and children cried, and women shouted\ncurses after the eagle.\n\nThe danger in trying to do good is that the mind comes to confuse the intent\nof goodness with the act of doing things well.\n\nThat is not what the otter was thinking as it swam fast down the Yennava. It\nwas not thinking anything much but speed and direction and the sweet taste of\nriver water and the sweet power of swimming. But something like that is what\nMedra had been thinking as he sat at the table in his grandmother’s house in\nEnd-lane, talking with his mother and sister, just before the door was flung\nopen and the terrible shining figure stood there.\n\nMedra had come to Havnor thinking that because he meant no harm he would do no\nharm. He had done irreparable harm. Men and women and children had died\nbecause he was there. They had died in torment, burned alive. He had put his\nsister and mother in fearful danger, and himself, and through him, Roke. If\nEarly (of whom he knew only his use-name and reputation) caught him and used\nhim as he was said to use people, emptying their minds like little sacks, then\neveryone on Roke would be exposed to the wizards power and to the might of the\nfleets and armies under his command. Medra would have betrayed Roke to Havnor,\nas the wizard they never named had betrayed it to Wathort. Maybe that man,\ntoo, had thought he could do no harm.\n\nMedra had been thinking, once again, and still unavailingly, how he could\nleave Havnor at once and unnoticed, when the wizard came.\n\nNow, as otter, he was thinking only that he would like to stay otter, be\notter, in the sweet brown water, the living river, forever. There is no death\nfor an otter, only life to the end. But in the sleek creature was the mortal\nmind; and where the stream passes the hill west of Samory, the otter came up\non the muddy bank, and then the man crouched there, shivering.\n\nWhere to now? Why had he come here?\n\nHe had not thought. He had taken the shape that came soonest to him, run to\nthe river as an otter would, swum as the otter would swim. But only in his own\nform could he think as a man, hide, decide, act as a man or as a wizard\nagainst the wizard who hunted him.\n\nHe knew he was no match for Early. To stop that first binding spell he had\nused all the strength of resistance he had. The illusion and the shape-change\nwere all the tricks he had to play. If he faced the wizard again he would be\ndestroyed. And Roke with him. Roke and its children, and Elehal his love, and\nVeil, Crow, Dory, all of them, the fountain in the white courtyard, the tree\nby the fountain. Only the Grove would stand. Only the green hill, silent,\nimmovable. He heard Elehal say to him, Havnor lies between us. He heard her\nsay, Al! the true powers, all the old powers, at root are one.\n\nHe looked up. The hillside above the stream was that same hill where he had\ncome that day with Tinaral, Anieb’s presence within him. It was only a few\nsteps round it to the scar, the seam, still clear enough under the green\ngrasses of summer.\n\n“Mother,” he said, on his knees there, “Mother, open to me.”\n\nHe laid his hands on the seam of earth, but there was no power in them.\n\n“Let me in, mother,” he whispered in the tongue that was as old as the hill.\nThe ground shivered a little and opened.\n\nHe heard an eagle scream. He got to his feet. He leapt into the dark.\n\nThe eagle came, circling and screaming over the valley, the hillside, the\nwillows by the stream. It circled, searching and searching, and flew back as\nit had come.\n\nAfter a long time, late in the afternoon, old Hound came trudging up the\nvalley. He stopped now and then and sniffed. He sat down on the hillside\nbeside the scar in the ground, resting his tired legs. He studied the ground\nwhere some crumbs of fresh dirt lay and the grass was bent. He stroked the\nbent grass to straighten it. He got to his feet at last, went for a drink of\nthe clear brown water under the willows, and set off down the valley towards\nthe mine.\n\nMedra woke in pain, in darkness. For a long time that was all there was. The\npain came and went, the darkness remained. Once it lightened a little into a\ntwilight in which he could dimly see. He saw a slope running down from where\nhe lay towards a wall of stones, across which was darkness again. But he could\nnot get up to walk to the wall, and presently the pain came back very sharp in\nhis arm and hip and head. Then the darkness came around him, and then nothing.\n\nThirst: and with it pain. Thirst, and the sound of water running.\n\nHe tried to remember how to make light. Anieb said to him, plaintively, “Can’t\nyou make the light?” But he could not. He crawled in the dark till the sound\nof water was loud and the rocks under him were wet, and groped till his hand\nfound water. He drank, and tried to crawl away from the wet rocks afterward,\nbecause he was very cold. One arm hurt and had no strength in it.\n\nHis head hurt again, and he whimpered and shivered, trying to draw himself\ntogether for warmth. There was no warmth and no light.\n\nHe was sitting a little way from where he lay, looking at himself, although it\nwas still utterly dark. He lay huddled and crumpled near where the little\nseep-stream dripped from the ledge of mica. Not far away lay another huddled\nheap, rotted red silk, long hair, bones. Beyond it the cavern stretched away.\nHe could see that its rooms and passages went much farther than he had known.\nHe saw it with the same uncaring interest with which he saw Tinaral’s body and\nhis own body. He felt a mild regret. It was only fair that he should die here\nwith the man he had killed. It was right. Nothing was wrong. But something in\nhim ached, not the sharp body pain, a long ache, lifelong.\n\n“Anieb,” he said.\n\nThen he was back in himself, with the fierce hurt in his arm and hip and head,\nsick and dizzy in the blind blackness. When he moved, he whimpered; but he sat\nup. I have to live, he thought. I have to remember how to live. How to make\nlight. I have to remember. I have to remember the shadows of the leaves.\n\nHow far does the forest go?\n\nAs far as the mind goes.\n\nHe looked up into the darkness. After a while he moved his good hand a little,\nand the faint light flowed out of it.\n\nThe roof of the cavern was far above him. The trickle of water dripping from\nthe mica ledge glittered in short dashes in the werelight.\n\nHe could no longer see the chambers and passages of the cave as he had seen\nthem with the uncaring, disembodied eye. He could see only what the flicker of\nwerelight showed just around him and before him. As when he had gone through\nthe night with Anieb to her death, each step into the dark.\n\nHe got to his knees, and thought then to whisper, “Thank you, mother.” He got\nto his feet, and fell, because his left hip gave way with a pain that made him\ncry out aloud. After a while he tried again, and stood up. Then he started\nforward.\n\nIt took him a long time to cross the cavern. He put his bad arm inside his\nshirt and kept his good hand pressed to his hip joint, which made it a little\neasier to walk. The walls narrowed gradually to a passage. Here the roof was\nmuch lower, just above his head. Water seeped down one wall and gathered in\nlittle pools among the rocks underfoot. It was not the marvelous red palace of\nTinaral’s vision, mystic silvery runes on high branching columns. It was only\nthe earth, only dirt, rock, water. The air was cool and still. Away from the\ndripping of the stream it was silent. Outside the gleam of werelight it was\ndark.\n\nMedra bowed his head, standing there. “Anieb,” he said, “can you come back\nthis far? I don’t know the way.” He waited a while. He saw darkness, heard\nsilence. Slow and halting, he entered the passage.\n\nHow the man had escaped him, Early did not know, but two things were certain:\nthat he was a far more powerful mage than any Early had met, and that he would\nreturn to Roke as fast as he could, since that was the source and center of\nhis power. There was no use trying to get there before him; he had the lead.\nBut Early could follow the lead, and if his own powers were not enough he\nwould have with him a force no mage could withstand. Had not even Morred been\nnearly brought down, not by witchcraft, but merely by the strength of the\narmies the Enemy had turned against him?\n\n“Your majesty is sending forth his fleets,” Early said to the staring old man\nin the armchair in the palace of the kings. “A great enemy has gathered\nagainst you, south in the Inmost Sea, and we are going to destroy them. A\nhundred ships will sail from the Great Port, from Omer and South Port and your\nfiefdom on Hosk, the greatest navy the world has seen! I shall lead them. And\nthe glory will be yours,” he said, with an open laugh, so that Losen stared at\nhim in a kind of horror, finally beginning to understand who was the master,\nwho the slave.\n\nSo well in hand did Early have Losen’s men that within two days the great\nfleet set forth from Havnor, gathering its tributaries on the way. Eighty\nships sailed past Ark and Ilien on a true and steady magewind that bore them\nstraight for Roke. Sometimes Early in his white silk robe, holding a tall\nwhite staff, the horn of a sea beast from the farthest North, stood in the\ndecked prow of the lead galley, whose hundred oars flashed beating like the\nwings of a gull. Sometimes he was himself the gull, or an eagle, or a dragon,\nwho flew above and before the fleet, and when the men saw him flying thus they\nshouted, “The dragonlord! the dragonlord!”\n\nThey came ashore in Ilien for water and food. Setting a host of many hundreds\nof men on its way so quickly had left little time for provisioning the ships.\nThey overran the towns along the west shore of Ilien, taking what they wanted,\nand did the same on Vissti and Kamery, looting what they could and burning\nwhat they left. Then the great fleet turned west, heading for the one harbor\nof Roke Island, the Bay of Thwil. Early knew of the harbor from the maps in\nHavnor, and knew there was a high hill above it. As they came nearer, he took\ndragon form and soared up high above his ships, leading them, gazing into the\nwest for the sight of that hill.\n\nWhen he saw it, faint and green above the misty sea, he cried out-the men in\nthe ships heard the dragon scream-and flew on faster, leaving them to follow\nhim to the conquest.\n\nAll the rumors of Roke had said that it was spell-defended and charm-hidden,\ninvisible to ordinary eyes. If there were any spells woven about that hill or\nthe bay he now saw opening before it, they were gossamer to him, transparent.\nNothing blurred his eyes or challenged his will as he flew over the bay, over\nthe little town and a half-finished building on the slope above it, to the top\nof the high green hill. There, striking down dragons claws and beating rust-\nred wings, he lighted.\n\nHe stood in his own form. He had not made the change himself. He stood alert,\nuncertain.\n\nThe wind blew, the long grass nodded in the wind. Summer was getting on and\nthe grass was dry now, yellowing, no flowers in it but the little white heads\nof the lacefoam. A woman came walking up the hill towards him through the long\ngrass. She followed no path, and walked easily, without haste.\n\nHe thought he had raised his hand in a spell to stop her, but he had not\nraised his hand, and she came on. She stopped only when she was a couple of\narm’s lengths from him and a little below him still.\n\n“Tell me your name,” she said, and he said, “Teriel,”\n\n“Why did you come here, Teriel?”\n\n“To destroy you.”\n\nHe stared at her, seeing a round-faced woman, middle-aged, short and strong,\nwith grey in her hair and dark eyes under dark brows, eyes that held his, held\nhim, brought the truth out of his mouth.\n\n“Destroy us? Destroy this hill? The trees there?” She looked down to a grove\nof trees not far from the hill. “Maybe Segoy who made them could unmake them.\nMaybe the earth will destroy herself. Maybe she’ll destroy herself through our\nhands, in the end. But not through yours. False king, false dragon, false man,\ndon’t come to Roke Knoll until you know the ground you stand on.” She made one\ngesture of her hand, downward to the earth.\n\nThen she turned and went down the hill through the long grass, the way she had\ncome.\n\nThere were other people on the hill, he saw now, many others, men and women,\nchildren, living and spirits of the dead; many, many of them. He was terrified\nof them and cowered, trying to make a spell that would hide him from them all.\n\nBut he made no spell. He had no magic left in him. It was gone, run out of him\ninto this terrible hill, into the terrible ground under him, gone. He was no\nwizard, only a man like the others, powerless.\n\nHe knew that, knew it absolutely, though still he tried to say spells, and\nraised his arms in the incantation, and beat the air in fury. Then he looked\neastward, straining his eyes for the flashing beat of the galley oars, for the\nsails of his ships coming to punish these people and save him.\n\nAll he saw was a mist on the water, all across the sea beyond the mouth of the\nbay. As he watched it thickened and darkened, creeping out over the slow\nwaves.\n\nEarth in her turning to the sun makes the days and nights, but within her\nthere are no days. Medra walked through the night. He was very lame, and could\nnot always keep up the werelight. When it failed he had to stop and sit down\nand sleep. The sleep was never death, as he thought it was. He woke, always\ncold, always in pain, always thirsty, and when he could make a glimmer of the\nlight he got to his feet and went on. He never saw Anieb but he knew she was\nthere. He followed her. Sometimes there were great rooms. Sometimes there were\npools of motionless water. It was hard to break the stillness of their\nsurface, but he drank from them. He thought he had gone down deeper and deeper\nfor a long time, till he reached the longest of those pools, and after that\nthe way went up again. Sometimes now Anieb followed him. He could say her\nname, though she did not answer. He could not say the other name, but he could\nthink of the trees; of the roots of the trees. This was the kingdom of the\nroots of the trees. How far does the forest go? As far as forests go. As long\nas the lives, as deep as the roots of the trees. As long as leaves cast\nshadows. There were no shadows here, only the dark, but he went forward, and\nwent forward, until he saw Anieb before him. He saw the flash of her eyes, the\ncloud of her curling hair. She looked back at him for a moment, and then\nturned aside and ran lightly down a long, steep slope into darkness.\n\nWhere he stood it was not wholly dark. The air moved against his face. Far\nahead, dim, small, there was a light that was not werelight. He went forward.\nHe had been crawling for a long time now, dragging the right leg, which would\nnot bear his weight. He went forward. He smelled the wind of evening and saw\nthe sky of evening through the branches and leaves of trees. An arched oak\nroot formed the mouth of the cave, no bigger than a man or a badger needed to\ncrawl through. He crawled through. He lay there under the root of the tree,\nseeing the light fade and a star or two come out among the leaves.\n\nThat was where Hound found him, miles away from the valley, west of Samory, on\nthe edge of the great forest of Faliern.\n\n“Got you,” the old man said, looking down at the muddy, lax body. He added,\n“Too late,” regretfully. He stooped to see if he could pick him up or drag\nhim, and felt the faint warmth of life. “You’re tough,” he said. “Here, wake\nup. Come on. Otter, wake up.”\n\nHe recognized Hound, though he could not sit up and could barely speak. The\nold man put his own jacket around his shoulders and gave him water from his\nflask. Then he squatted beside him, his back against the immense trunk of the\noak, and stared into the forest for a while. It was late morning, hot, the\nsummer sunlight filtering through the leaves in a thousand shades of green. A\nsquirrel scolded, far up in the oak, and a jay replied. Hound scratched his\nneck and sighed.\n\n“The wizards off on the wrong track, as usual,” he said at last. “Said you’d\ngone to Roke Island and he’d catch you there. I said nothing.”\n\nHe looked at the man he knew only as Otter.\n\n“You went in there, that hole, with the old wizard, didn’t you? Did you find\nhim?”\n\nMedra nodded.\n\n“Hmn,” Hound went, a short, grunting laugh. “You find what you look for, don’t\nyou? Like me.” He saw that his companion was in distress, and said, “I’ll get\nyou out of here. Fetch a carter from the village down there, when I’ve got my\nbreath. Listen. Don’t fret. I haven’t hunted you all these years to give you\nto Early. The way I gave you to Gelluk. I was sorry for that. I thought about\nit. What I said to you about men of a craft sticking together. And who we work\nfor. Couldn’t see that I had much choice about that. But having done you a\ndisfavor, I thought if I came across you again I’d do you a favor, if I could.\nAs one finder to the other, see?”\n\nOtter’s breath was coming hard. Hound put his hand on Otter’s hand for a\nmoment, said, “Don’t worry,” and got to his feet. “Rest easy,” he said.\n\nHe found a carter who would carry them down to Endlane, Otter’s mother and\nsister were living with cousins while they rebuilt their burned house as best\nthey could. They welcomed him with disbelieving joy. Not knowing Hound’s\nconnection with the warlord and his wizard, they treated him as one of\nthemselves, the good man who had found poor Otter half dead in the forest and\nbrought him home. A wise man, said Otter’s mother Rose, surely a wise man.\nNothing was too good for such a man.\n\nOtter was slow to recover, to heal. The bonesetter did what he could about his\nbroken arm and his damaged hip, the wise woman salved the cuts from the rocks\non his hands and head and knees, his mother brought him all the delicacies she\ncould find in the gardens and berry thickets; but he lay as weak and wasted as\nwhen Hound first brought him. There was no heart in him, the wise woman of\nEndlane said. It was somewhere else, being eaten up with worry or fear or\nshame.\n\n“So where is it?” Hound said.\n\nOtter, after a long silence, said, “Roke Island.”\n\n“Where old Early went with the great fleet. I see. Friends there. Well, I know\none of the ships is back, because I saw one of her men, down the way, in the\ntavern. I’ll go ask about. Find out if they got to Roke and what happened\nthere. What I can tell you is that it seems old Early is late coming home.\nHmn, hmn,” he went, pleased with his joke. “Late coming home,” he repeated,\nand got up. He looked at Otter, who was not much to look at. “Rest easy,” he\nsaid, and went off.\n\nHe was gone several days. When he returned, riding in a horse-drawn cart, he\nhad such a look about him that Otter’s sister hurried in to tell him, “Hound’s\nwon a battle or a fortune! He’s riding behind a city horse, in a city cart,\nlike a prince!”\n\nHound came in on her heels. “Well,” he said, “in the first place, when I got\nto the city, I go up to the palace, just to hear the news, and what do I see?\nI see old King Pirate standing on his legs, shouting out orders like he used\nto do. Standing up! Hasn’t stood for years. Shouting orders! And some of em\ndid what he said, and some of em didn’t. So I got on out of there, that kind\nof a situation being dangerous, in a palace. Then I went about to friends of\nmine and asked where was old Early and had the fleet been to Roke and come\nback and all. Early, they said, nobody knew about Early. Not a sign of him nor\nfrom him. Maybe I could find him, they said, joking me, hmn. They know I love\nhim. As for the ships, some had come back, with the men aboard saying they\nnever came to Roke Island, never saw it, sailed right through where the sea\ncharts said was an island, and there was no island. Then there were some men\nfrom one of the great galleys. They said when they got close to where the\nisland should be, they came into a fog as thick as wet cloth, and the sea\nturned thick too, so that the oarsmen could barely push the oars through it,\nand they were caught in that for a day and a night. When they got out, there\nwasn’t another ship of all the fleet on the sea, and the slaves were near\nrebelling, so the master brought her home as quick as he could. Another, the\nold Stormcloud, used to be Losen’s own ship, came in while I was there. I\ntalked to some men off her. They said there was nothing but fog and reefs all\nround where Roke was supposed to be, so they sailed on with seven other ships,\nsouth a ways, and met up with a fleet sailing up from Wathort. Maybe the lords\nthere had heard there was a great fleet coming raiding, because they didn’t\nstop to ask questions, but sent wizard’s fire at our ships, and came alongside\nto board them if they could, and the men I talked to said it was a hard fight\njust to get away from them, and not all did. All this time they had no word\nfrom Early, and no weather was worked for them unless they had a bagman of\ntheir own aboard. So they came back up the length of the Inmost Sea, said the\nman from Stormcloud, one straggling after the other like the dogs that lost\nthe dogfight. Now, do you like the news I bring you?”\n\nOtter had been struggling with tears; he hid his face. “Yes,” he said,\n“thanks.”\n\n“Thought you might. As for King Losen,” Hound said, “who knows.” He sniffed\nand sighed. “If I was him I’d retire” he said. “I think I’ll do that myself.”\n\nOtter had got control of his face and voice. He wiped his eyes and nose,\ncleared his throat, and said, “Might be a good idea. Come to Roke. Safer.”\n\n“Seems to be a hard place to find,” Hound said.\n\n“I can find it,” said Otter.\n\n  \n\nIV. Medra\n\n  \n\nThere was an old man by our door\n\nWho opened it to rich or poor,\n\nMany came there both small and great,\n\nBut few could pass through Medra’s Gate.\n\nSo runs the water away, away,\n\nSo runs the water away.\n\n  \n\nHOUND STAYED IN ENDLANE. He could make a living as a finder there, and he\nliked the tavern, and Otter’s mother’s hospitality.\n\nBy the beginning of autumn, Losen was hanging by a rope round his feet from a\nwindow of the New Palace, rotting, while six warlords quarreled over his\nkingdom, and the ships of the great fleet chased and fought one another across\nthe Straits and the wizard-troubled sea.\n\nBut Hopeful, sailed and steered by two young sorcerers from the Hand of\nHavnor, brought Medra safe down the Inmost Sea to Roke.\n\nEmber was on the dock to meet him. Lame and very thin, he came to her and took\nher hands, but he could not lift his face to hers. He said, “I have too many\ndeaths on my heart, Elehal.”\n\n“Come with me to the Grove,” she said.\n\nThey went there together and stayed till the winter came. In the year that\nfollowed, they built a little house near the edge of the Thwilburn that runs\nout of the Grove, and lived there in the summers.\n\nThey worked and taught in the Great House. They saw it go up stone on stone,\nevery stone steeped in spells of protection, endurance, peace. They saw the\nRule of Roke established, though never so firmly as they might wish, and\nalways against opposition; for mages came from other islands and rose up from\namong the students of the school, women and men of power, knowledge, and\npride, sworn by the Rule to work together and for the good of all, but each\nseeing a different way to do it.\n\nGrowing old, Elehal wearied of the passions and questions of the school and\nwas drawn more and more to the trees, where she went alone, as far as the mind\ncan go. Medra walked there too, but not so far as she, for he was lame.\n\nAfter she died, he lived a while alone in the small house near the Grove.\n\nOne day in autumn he came back to the school. He went in by the garden door,\nwhich gives on the path through the fields to Roke Knoll. It is a curious\nthing about the Great House of Roke, that it has no portal or grand entryway\nat all. You can enter by what they call the back door, which, though it is\nmade of horn and framed in dragons tooth and carved with the Thousand-Leaved\nTree, looks like nothing at all from outside, as you come to it in a dingy\nstreet; or you can go in the garden door, plain oak with an iron bolt. But\nthere is no front door.\n\nHe came through the halls and stone corridors to the inmost place, the marble-\npaved courtyard of the fountain, where the tree Elehal had planted now stood\ntall, its berries reddening.\n\nHearing he was there, the teachers of Roke came, the men and women who were\nmasters of their craft. Medra had been the Master Finder, until he went to the\nGrove. A young woman now taught that art, as he had taught it to her.\n\n“I’ve been thinking,” he said. “There are eight of you. Nine’s a better\nnumber. Count me as a master again, if you will.”\n\n“What will you do, Master Tern?” asked the Summoner, a grey-haired mage from\nIlien.\n\n“I’ll keep the door,” Medra said. “Being lame, I won’t go far from it. Being\nold, I’ll know what to say to those who come. Being a finder, I’ll find out if\nthey belong here.”\n\n“That would spare us much trouble and some danger,” said the young Finder.\n\n“How will you do it?” the Summoner asked.\n\n“I’ll ask them their name,” Medra said. He smiled. “If they’ll tell me, they\ncan come in. And when they think they’ve learned everything, they can go out\nagain. If they can tell me my name.”\n\nSo it was. For the rest of his life, Medra kept the doors of the Great House\non Roke. The garden door that opened out upon the Knoll was long called\nMedra’s Gate, even after much else had changed in that house as the centuries\npassed through it. And still the ninth Master of Roke is the Doorkeeper.\n\nIn Endlane and the villages round the foot of Onn on Havnor, women spinning\nand weaving sing a riddle song of which the last line has to do, maybe, with\nthe man who was Medra, and Otter, and Tern.\n\nThree things were that will not be: Solea’s bright isle above the wave, A\ndragon swimming in the sea, A seabird flying in the grave.\n\n\nDarkrose And Diamond\n\nA BOAT-SONG FROM WEST HAVNOR\n\nWhere my love is going\n\nThere will I go.\n\nWhere his boat is rowing\n\nI will row.\n\n  \n\nWe will laugh together,\n\nTogether we will cry.\n\nIf he lives I will live,\n\nIf he dies I die.\n\n  \n\nWhere my love is going\n\nThere will I go.\n\nWhere his boat is rowing\n\nI will row.\n\n  \n\nIn the west of Havnor, among hills forested with oak and chestnut, is the town\nof Glade. A while ago, the rich man of that town was a merchant called Golden.\n\nGolden owned the mill that cut the oak boards for the ships they built in\nHavnor South Port and Havnor Great Port; he owned the biggest chestnut groves;\nhe owned the carts and hired the carters that carried the timber and the\nchestnuts over the hills to be sold. He did very well from trees, and when his\nson was born, the mother said, “We could call him Chestnut, or Oak, maybe?”\nBut the father said, “Diamond,” diamond being in his estimation the one thing\nmore precious than gold.\n\nSo little Diamond grew up in the finest house in Glade, a fat, bright-eyed\nbaby, a ruddy, cheerful boy. He had a sweet singing voice, a true ear, and a\nlove of music, so that his mother, Tuly, called him Songsparrow and Skylark,\namong other loving names, for she never really did like “Diamond.” He trilled\nand caroled about the house; he knew any tune as soon as he heard it, and\ninvented tunes when he heard none. His mother had the wisewoman Tangle teach\nhim The Creation of Ea and The Deed of the Young King, and at Sunreturn when\nhe was eleven years old he sang the Winter Carol for the Lord of the Western\nLand, who was visiting his domain in the hills above Glade. The Lord and his\nLady praised the boy’s singing and gave him a tiny gold box with a diamond set\nin the lid, which seemed a kind and pretty gift to Diamond and his mother. But\nGolden was a bit impatient with the singing and the trinkets. “There are more\nimportant things for you to do, son,” he said. “And greater prizes to be\nearned.”\n\nDiamond thought his father meant the business—the loggers, the sawyers, the\nsawmill, the chestnut groves, the pickers, the carters, the carts—all that\nwork and talk and planning, complicated, adult matters. He never felt that it\nhad much to do with him, so how was he to have as much to do with it as his\nfather expected? Maybe he’d find out when he grew up.\n\nBut in fact Golden wasn’t thinking only about the business. He had observed\nsomething about his son that had made him not exactly set his eyes higher than\nthe business, but glance above it from time to time, and then shut his eyes.\n\nAt first he had thought Diamond had a knack such as many children had and then\nlost, a stray spark of magery. When he was a little boy, Golden himself had\nbeen able to make his own shadow shine and sparkle. His family had praised him\nfor the trick and made him show it off to visitors; and then when he was seven\nor eight he had lost the hang of it and never could do it again.\n\nWhen he saw Diamond come down the stairs without touching the stairs, he\nthought his eyes had deceived him; but a few days later, he saw the child\nfloat up the stairs, just a finger gliding along the oaken banister-rail. “Can\nyou do that coming down?” Golden asked, and Diamond said,\n\n“Oh, yes, like this,” and sailed back down smooth as a cloud on the south\nwind.\n\n“How did you learn to do that?”\n\n“I just sort of found out,” said the boy, evidently not sure if his father\napproved.\n\nGolden did not praise the boy, not wanting to making him self-conscious or\nvain about what might be a passing, childish gift, like his sweet treble\nvoice. There was too much fuss already made over that.\n\nBut a year or so later he saw Diamond out in the back garden with his playmate\nRose. The children were squatting on their haunches, heads close together,\nlaughing. Something intense or uncanny about them made him pause at the window\non the stairs landing and watch them. A thing between them was leaping up and\ndown, a frog? a toad? a big cricket? He went out into the garden and came up\nnear them, moving so quietly, though he was a big man, that they in their\nabsorption did not hear him. The thing that was hopping up and down on the\ngrass between their bare toes was a rock. When Diamond raised his hand the\nrock jumped up in the air, and when he shook his hand a little the rock\nhovered in the air, and when he flipped his fingers downward it fell to earth.\n\n“Now you,” Diamond said to Rose, and she started to do what he had done, but\nthe rock only twitched a little. “Oh,” she whispered, “there’s your dad.”\n\n“That’s very clever,” Golden said.\n\n“Di thought it up,” Rose said.\n\nGolden did not like the child. She was both outspoken and defensive, both rash\nand timid. She was a girl, and a year younger than Diamond, and a witch’s\ndaughter. He wished his son would play with boys his own age, his own sort,\nfrom the respectable families of Glade. Tuly insisted on calling the witch\n“the wisewoman,” but a witch was a witch and her daughter was no fit companion\nfor Diamond. It tickled him a little, though, to see his boy teaching tricks\nto the witch-child.\n\n“What else can you do, Diamond?” he asked.\n\n“Play the flute,” Diamond said promptly, and took out of his pocket the little\nfife his mother had given him for his twelfth birthday. He put it to his lips,\nhis fingers danced, and he played a sweet, familiar tune from the western\ncoast, “Where My Love Is Going.”\n\n“Very nice,” said the father. “But anybody can play the fife, you know.”\n\nDiamond glanced at Rose. The girl turned her head away, looking down.\n\n“I learned it really quickly,” Diamond said.\n\nGolden grunted, unimpressed.\n\n“It can do it by itself,” Diamond said, and held out the fife away from his\nlips. His fingers danced on the stops, and the fife played a short jig. It hit\nseveral false notes and squealed on the last high note. “I haven’t got it\nright yet,” Diamond said, vexed and embarrassed.\n\n“Pretty good, pretty good,” his father said. “Keep practicing.” And he went\non. He was not sure what he ought to have said. He did not want to encourage\nthe boy to spend any more time on music, or with this girl; he spent too much\nalready, and neither of them would help him get anywhere in life. But this\ngift, this undeniable gift t the rock hovering, the unblown fife—Well, it\nwould be wrong to make too much of it, but probably it should not be\ndiscouraged.\n\nIn Golden’s understanding, money was power, but not the only power. There were\ntwo others, one equal, one greater. There was birth. When the Lord of the\nWestern Land came to his domain near Glade, Golden was glad to show him\nfealty. The Lord was born to govern and to keep the peace, as Golden was born\nto deal with commerce and wealth, each in his place; and each, noble or\ncommon, if he served well and honestly, deserved honor and respect. But there\nwere also lesser lords whom Golden could buy and sell, lend to or let beg, men\nborn noble who deserved neither fealty nor honor. Power of birth and power of\nmoney were contingent, and must be earned lest they be lost.\n\nBut beyond the rich and the lordly were those called the Men of Power: the\nwizards. Their power, though little exercised, was absolute. In their hands\nlay the fate of the long-kingless kingdom of the Archipelago.\n\nIf Diamond had been born to that kind of power, if that was his gift, then all\nGolden’s dreams and plans of training him in the business, and having him help\nin expanding the carting route to a regular trade with South Port, and buying\nup the chestnut forests above Reche—all such plans dwindled into trifles.\nMight Diamond go (as his mother’s uncle had gone) to the School of Wizards on\nRoke Island? Might he (as that uncle had done) gain glory for his family and\ndominion over lord and commoner, becoming a Mage in the Court of the Lords\nRegent in the Great Port of Havnor? Golden all but floated up the stairs\nhimself, borne on such visions.\n\nBut he said nothing to the boy and nothing to the boy’s mother. He was a\nconsciously close-mouthed man, distrustful of visions until they could be made\nacts; and she, though a dutiful, loving wife and mother and housekeeper,\nalready made too much of Diamond’s talents and accomplishments. Also, like all\nwomen, she was inclined to babble and gossip, and indiscriminate in her\nfriendships. The girl Rose hung about with Diamond because Tuly encouraged\nRose’s mother the witch to visit, consulting her every time Diamond had a\nhangnail, and telling her more than she or anyone ought to know about Golden’s\nhousehold. His business was none of the witch’s business. On the other hand,\nTangle might be able to tell him if his son in fact showed promise, had a\ntalent for magery...but he flinched away from the thought of asking her,\nasking a witch’s opinion on anything, least of all a judgment on his son.\n\nHe resolved to wait and watch. Being a patient man with a strong will, he did\nso for four years, till Diamond was sixteen. A big, well-grown youth, good at\ngames and lessons, he was ‘still ruddy-faced and bright-eyed and cheerful. He\nhad taken it hard when his voice changed, the sweet treble going all untuned\nand hoarse. Golden had hoped that that was the end of his singing, but the boy\nwent on wandering about with itinerant musicians, ballad-singers and such,\nlearning all their trash. That was no life for a merchant’s son who was to\ninherit and manage his father’s properties and mills and business, and Golden\ntold him so. “Singing time is over, son,” he said. “You must think about being\na man.”\n\nDiamond had been given his truename at the springs of the Amia in the hills\nabove Glade. The wizard Hemlock, who had known his great-uncle the Mage, came\nup from South Port to name him. And Hemlock was invited to his nameday party\nthe year after, a big party, beer and food for all, and new clothes, a shirt\nor skirt or shift for every child, which was an old custom in the West of\nHavnor, and dancing on the village green in the warm autumn evening. Diamond\nhad many friends, all the boys his age in town and all the girls too. The\nyoung people danced, and some of them had a bit too much beer, but nobody\nmisbehaved very badly, and it was a merry and memorable night. The next\nmorning Golden told his son again that he must think about being a man.\n\n“I have thought some about it,” said the boy, in his husky voice.\n\n“And?”\n\n“Well, I,” said Diamond, and stuck.\n\n“I’d always counted on your going into the family business,” Golden said. His\ntone was neutral, and Diamond said nothing. “Have you had any ideas of what\nyou want to do?”\n\n“Sometimes.”\n\n“Did you talk at all to Master Hemlock?”\n\nDiamond hesitated and said, “No.” He looked a question at his father.\n\n“I talked to him last night,” Golden said. “He said to me that there are\ncertain natural gifts which it’s not only difficult but actually wrong,\nharmful, to suppress.”\n\nThe light had come back into Diamond’s dark eyes.\n\n“The Master said that such gifts or capacities, untrained, are not only\nwasted, but may be dangerous. The art must be learned, and practiced, he\nsaid.”\n\nDiamond’s face shone.\n\n“But, he said, it must be learned and practiced for its own sake.”\n\nDiamond nodded eagerly.\n\n“If it’s a real gift, an unusual capacity, that’s even more true. A witch with\nher love potions can’t do much harm, but even a village sorcerer, he said,\nmust take care, for if the art is used for base ends, it becomes weak and\nnoxious.... Of course, even a sorcerer gets paid. And wizards, as you know,\nlive with lords, and have what they wish.”\n\nDiamond was listening intently, frowning a little.\n\n“So, to be blunt about it, if you have this gift, Diamond, it’s of no use,\ndirectly, to our business. It has to be cultivated on its own terms, and kept\nunder control—learned and mastered. Only then, he said, can your teachers\nbegin to tell you what to do with it, what good it will do you. Or others,” he\nadded conscientiously.\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n“I told him,” Golden said, “that I had seen you, with a turn of your hand and\na single word, change a wooden carving of a bird into a bird that flew up and\nsang. Pre seen you make a light glow in thin air. You didn’t know I was\nwatching. I’ve watched and said nothing for a long time. I didn’t want to make\ntoo much of mere childish play. But I believe you have a gift, perhaps a great\ngift. When I told Master Hemlock what I’d seen you do, he agreed with me. He\nsaid that you may go study with him in South Port for a year, or perhaps\nlonger.”\n\n“Study with Master Hemlock?” said Diamond, his voice up half an octave.\n\n“If you wish.”\n\n“I, I, I never thought about it. Can I think about it? For a while—a day?”\n\n“Of course,” Golden said, pleased with his son’s caution. He had thought\nDiamond might leap at the offer, which would have been natural, perhaps, but\npainful to the father, the owl who had—perhaps—hatched out an eagle.\n\nFor Golden looked on the Art Magic with genuine humility as something quite\nbeyond him—not a mere toy, such as music or tale-telling, but a practical\nbusiness, which his business could never quite equal. And he was, though he\nwouldn’t have put it that way, afraid of wizards. A bit contemptuous of\nsorcerers, with their sleights and illusions and gibble-gabble, but afraid of\nwizards.\n\n“Does Mother know?” Diamond asked.\n\n“She will when the time comes. But she has no part to play in your decision,\nDiamond. Women know nothing of these matters and have nothing to do with them.\n\nYou must make your choice alone, as a man. Do you understand that?” Golden was\nearnest, seeing his chance to begin to wean the lad from his mother. She as a\nwoman would cling, but he as a man must learn to let go. And Diamond nodded\nsturdily enough to satisfy his father, though he had a thoughtful look.\n\n“Master Hemlock said I, said he thought I had, I might have a, a gift, a\ntalent for--?”\n\nGolden reassured him that the wizard had actually said so, though of course\nwhat kind or a gift remained to be seen. The boy’s modesty was a great relief\nto him.\n\nHe had half-consciously dreaded that Diamond would triumph over him, asserting\nhis power right away—that mysterious, dangerous, incalculable power against\nwhich Golden’s wealth and mastery and dignity shrank to impotence.\n\n“Thank you, Father,” the boy said. Golden embraced him and left, well pleased\nwith him.\n\nTHEIR MEETING PLACE was in the sallows, the willow thickets down by the Amia\nas it ran below the smithy. As soon as Rose got there, Diamond said, “He wants\nme to go study with Master Hemlock! What am I going to do?”\n\n“Study with the wizard?”\n\n“He thinks I have this huge great talent. For magic.”\n\n“Who does?”\n\n“Father does. He saw some of the stuff we were practicing. But he says Hemlock\nsays I should come study with him because it might be dangerous not to. Oh,”\nand Diamond beat his head with his hands.\n\n“But you do have a talent.”\n\nHe groaned and scoured his scalp with his knuckles. He was sitting on the dirt\nin their old play-place, a kind of bower deep in the willows, where they could\nhear the stream running over the stones nearby and the clang-clang of the\nsmithy further off. The girl sat down facing him.\n\n“Look at all the stuff you can do,” she said. “You couldn’t do any of it if\nyou didn’t have a gift.”\n\n“A little gift,” Diamond said indistinctly. “Enough for tricks.”\n\n“How do you know that?”\n\nRose was very dark-skinned, with a cloud of crinkled hair, a thin mouth, an\nintent, serious face. Her feet and legs and hands were bare and dirty, her\nskirt and jacket disreputable. Her dirty toes and fingers were delicate and\nelegant, and a necklace of amethysts gleamed under the torn, buttonless\njacket. Her mother, Tangle, made a good living by curing and healing, bone-\nknitting and birth-easing, and selling spells of finding, love-potions, and\nsleeping-drafts. She could afford to dress herself and her daughter in new\nclothes, buy shoes, and keep clean, but it didn’t occur to her to do so. Nor\nwas housekeeping one of her interests. She and Rose lived mostly on boiled\nchicken and fried eggs, as she was often paid in poultry. The yard of their\ntwo-room house was a wilderness of cats and hens. She liked cats, toads, and\njewels. The amethyst necklace had been payment for the safe delivery of a son\nto Golden’s head forester. Tangle herself wore armfuls of bracelets and\nbangles that flashed and crashed when she flicked out an impatient spell. At\ntimes she wore a kitten on her shoulder. She was not an attentive mother. Rose\nhad demanded, at seven years old, “Why did you have me if you didn’t want me?”\n\n“How can you deliver babies properly if you haven’t had one?” said her mother.\n\n“So I was practice,” Rose snarled.\n\n“Everything is practice,” Tangle said. She was never ill-natured. She seldom\nthought to do anything much for her daughter, but never hurt her, never\nscolded her, and gave her whatever she asked for, dinner, a toad of her own,\nthe amethyst necklace, lessons in witchcraft. She would have provided new\nclothes if Rose had asked for them, but she never did. Rose had looked after\nherself from an early age; and this was one of the reasons Diamond loved her.\nWith her, he knew what freedom was. Without her, he could attain it only when\nhe was hearing and singing and playing music.\n\n“I do have a gift,” he said now, rubbing his temples and pulling his hair.\n\n“Stop destroying your head,” Rose told him.\n\n“I know Tarry thinks I do.”\n\n“Of course you do! What does it matter what Tarry thinks? You already play the\nharp about nine times better than he ever did.”\n\nThis was another of the reasons Diamond loved her.\n\n“Are there any wizard musicians?” he asked, looking up.\n\nShe pondered. “I don’t know.”\n\n“I don’t either. Morred and Elfarran sang to each other, and he was a mage. I\nthink there’s a Master Chanter on Roke, that teaches the lays and the\nhistories. But I never heard of a wizard being a musician.”\n\n“I don’t see why one couldn’t be.” She never saw why something could not be.\n\nAnother reason he loved her.\n\n“It always seemed to me they’re sort of alike,” he said, “magic and music.\nSpells and tunes. For one thing, you have to get them just exactly right.”\n\n“Practice,” Rose said, rather sourly. “I know.” She flicked a pebble at\nDiamond. It turned into a butterfly in midair. He flicked a butterfly back at\nher, and the two flitted and flickered a moment before they fell back to earth\nas pebbles. Diamond and Rose had worked out several such variations on the old\nstone-hopping trick.\n\n“You ought to go, Di,” she said. “Just to find out.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“What if you got to be a wizard! Oh! Think of the stuff you could teach me!\nShapechanging—We could be anything. Horses! Bears!”\n\n“Moles,” Diamond said. “Honestly, I feel like hiding underground. I always\nthought Father was going to make me learn all his kind of stuff, after I got\nmy name. But all this year he’s kept sort of holding off. I guess he had this\nin mind all along. But what if I go down there and I’m not any better at being\na wizard than I am at bookkeeping? Why can’t I do what I know I can do?”\n\n“Well, why can’t you do it all? The magic and the music, anyhow? You can\nalways hire a bookkeeper.”\n\nWhen she laughed, her thin face got bright, her thin mouth got wide, and her\neyes disappeared.\n\n“Oh, Darkrose,” Diamond said, “I love you.”\n\n“Of course you do. You’d better. I’ll witch you if you don’t.”\n\nThey came forward on their knees, face to face, their arms straight down and\ntheir hands joined. They kissed each other all over their faces. To Rose’s\nlips Diamond’s face was smooth and full as a plum, with just a hint of\nprickliness above the lip and jawline, where he had taken to shaving recently.\nTo Diamond’s lips Rose’s face was soft as silk, with just a hint of grittiness\non one cheek, which she had rubbed with a dirty hand. They moved a little\ncloser so that their breasts and bellies touched, though their hands stayed\ndown by their sides. They went on kissing.\n\n“Darkrose,” he breathed in her ear, his secret name for her.\n\nShe said nothing, but breathed very warm in his ear, and he moaned. His hands\nclenched hers. He drew back a little. She drew back. They sat back on their\nankles.\n\n“Oh Di,” she said, “it will be awful when you go.”\n\n“I won’t go,” he said. “Anywhere. Ever.”\n\n  \n\nBUT OF COURSE he went down to Havnor South Port, in one of his father’s carts\ndriven by one of his father’s carters, along with Master Hemlock. As a rule,\npeople do what wizards advise them to do. And it is no small honor to be\ninvited by a wizard to be his student or apprentice. Hemlock, who had won his\nstaff on Roke, was used to having boys come to him begging to be tested and,\nif they had the gift for it, taught. He was a little curious about this boy\nwhose cheerful good manners hid some reluctance or self-doubt. It was the\nfather’s idea, not the boy’s, that he was gifted. That was unusual, though\nperhaps not so unusual among the wealthy as among common folk. At any rate he\ncame with a very good prenticing fee paid beforehand in gold and ivory. If he\nhad the makings of a wizard Hemlock would train him, and if he had, as Hemlock\nsuspected, a mere childish flair, then he’d be sent home with what remained of\nhis fee. Hemlock was an honest, upright, humorless, scholarly wizard with\nlittle interest in feelings or ideas. His gift was for names. “The art begins\nand ends in naming,” he said, which indeed is true, although there may be a\ngood deal between the beginning and the end.\n\nSo Diamond, instead of learning spells and illusions and transformations and\nall such gaudy tricks, as Hemlock called them, sat in a narrow room at the\nback of the wizard’s narrow house on a narrow back street of the old city,\nmemorizing long, long lists of words, words of power in the Language of the\nMaking. Plants and parts of plants and animals and parts of animals and\nislands and parts of islands, parts of ships, parts of the human body. The\nwords never made sense, never made sentences, only lists. Long, long lists.\n\nHis mind wandered. “Eyelash” in the True Speech is siasa, he read, and he felt\neyelashes brush his cheek in a butterfly kiss, dark lashes. He looked up\nstartled and did not know what had touched him. Later when he tried to repeat\nthe word, he stood dumb.\n\n“Memory, memory,” Hemlock said. “Talent’s no good without memory!” He was not\nharsh, but he was unyielding. Diamond had no idea what opinion Hemlock had of\nhim, and guessed it to be pretty low. The wizard sometimes had him come with\nhim to his work, mostly laying spells of safety on ships and houses, purifying\nwells, and sitting on the councils of the city, seldom speaking but always\nlistening. Another wizard, not Roke-trained but with the healer’s gift, looked\nafter the sick and dying of South Port. Hemlock was glad to let him do so. His\nown pleasure was in studying and, as far as Diamond could see, doing no magic\nat all. “Keep the Equilibrium, it’s all in that,” Hemlock said, and,\n“Knowledge, order, and control.” Those words he said so often that they made a\ntune in Diamond’s head and sang themselves over and over: knowledge, or-der,\nand contro-----....\n\nWhen Diamond put the lists of names to tunes he made up, he learned them much\nfaster; but then the tune would come as part of the name, and he would sing\nout so clearly—for his voice had re-established itself as a strong, dark\ntenor—that Hemlock winced. Hemlock’s was a very silent house.\n\nMostly the pupil was supposed to be with the Master, or studying the lists of\nnames in the room where the lorebooks and wordbooks were, or asleep. Hemlock\nwas a stickler for early abed and early afoot. But now and then Diamond had an\nhour or two free. He always went down to the docks and sat on a pierside or a\nwaterstair and thought about Darkrose. As soon as he was out of the house and\naway from Master Hemlock, he began to think about Darkrose, and went on\nthinking about her and very little else. It surprised him a little. He thought\nhe ought to be homesick, to think about his mother. He did think about his\nmother quite often, and often was homesick, lying on his cot in his bare and\nnarrow little room after a scanty supper of cold pea-porridge—for this wizard,\nat least, did not live in such luxury as Golden had imagined. Diamond never\nthought about Darkrose, nights. He thought of his mother, or of sunny rooms\nand hot food, or a tune would come into his head and he would practice it\nmentally on the harp in his mind, and so drift off to sleep. Darkrose would\ncome to his mind only when he was down at the docks, staring out at the water\nof the harbor, the piers, the fishing boats, only when he was outdoors and\naway from Hemlock and his house.\n\nSo he cherished his free hours as if they were actual meetings with her. He\nhad always loved her, but had not understood that he loved her beyond anyone\nand anything. When he was with her, even when he was down on the docks\nthinking of her, he was alive. He never felt entirely alive in Master\nHemlock’s house and presence. He felt a little dead. Not dead, but a little\ndead.\n\nA few times, sitting on the waterstairs, the dirty harbor water sloshing at\nthe next step down, the yells of gulls and dockworkers wreathing the air with\na thin, ungainly music, he shut his eyes and saw his love so clear, so close,\nthat he reached out his hand to touch her. If he reached out his hand in his\nmind only, as when he played the mental harp, then indeed he touched her. He\nfelt her hand in his, and her cheek, warm-cool, silken-gritty, lay against his\nmouth. In his mind he spoke to her, and in his mind she answered, her voice,\nher husky voice saying his name, “Diamond ....”\n\nBut as he went back up the streets of South Port he lost her. He swore to keep\nher with him, to think of her, to think of her that night, but she faded away.\nBy the time he opened the door of Master Hemlock’s house he was reciting lists\nof names, or wondering what would be for dinner, for he was hungry most of the\ntime. Not till he could take an hour and run back down to the docks could he\nthink of her.\n\nSo he came to feel that those hours were true meetings with her, and he lived\nfor them, without knowing what he lived for until his feet were on the\ncobbles, and his eyes on the harbor and the far line of the sea. Then he\nremembered what was worth remembering.\n\nThe winter passed by, and the cold early spring, and with the warm late spring\ncame a letter from his mother, brought by a carter. Diamond read it and took\nit to Master Hemlock, saying, “My mother wonders if I might spend a month at\nhome this summer.”\n\n“Probably not,” the wizard said, and then, appearing to notice Diamond, put\ndown his pen and said, “Young man, I must ask you if you wish to continue\nstudying with me.”\n\nDiamond had no idea what to say. The idea of its being up to him had not\noccurred to him. “Do you think I ought to?” he asked at last.\n\n“Probably not,” the wizard said.\n\nDiamond expected to feel relieved, released, but found he felt rejected,\nashamed.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he said, with enough dignity that Hemlock glanced up at him.\n\n“You could go to Roke,” the wizard said.\n\n“To Roke?”\n\nThe boy’s drop-jawed stare irritated Hemlock, though he knew it shouldn’t.\nWizards are used to overweening confidence in the young of their kind. They\nexpect modesty to come later, if at all. “I said Roke,” Hemlock said in a tone\nthat said he was unused to having to repeat himself. And then, because this\nboy, this soft-headed, spoiled, moony boy had endeared himself to Hemlock by\nhis uncomplaining patience, he took pity on him and said, “You should either\ngo to Roke or find a wizard to teach you what you need. Of course you need\nwhat I can teach you. You need the names. The art begins and ends in naming.\nBut that’s not your gift. You have a poor memory for words. You must train it\ndiligently. However, it’s clear that you do have capacities, and that they\nneed cultivation and discipline, which another man can give you better than I\ncan.” So does modesty breed modesty, sometimes, even in unlikely places. “If\nyou were to go to Roke, I’d send a letter with you drawing you to the\nparticular attention of the Master Summoner.”\n\n“Ah,” said Diamond, floored. The Summoner’s art is perhaps the most arcane and\ndangerous of all the arts of magic.\n\n“Perhaps I am wrong,” said Hemlock in his dry, flat voice. “Your gift may be\nfor Pattern. Or perhaps it’s an ordinary gift for shaping and transformation.\nI’m not certain.”\n\n“But you are—I do actually—“\n\n“Oh yes. You are uncommonly slow, young man, to recognize your own\ncapacities.” It was spoken harshly, and Diamond stiffened up a bit.\n\n“I thought my gift was for music,” he said.\n\nHemlock dismissed that with a flick of his hand. “I am talking of the True\nArt,” he said. “Now I will be frank with you. I advise you to write your\nparents—I shall write them too—informing them of your decision to go to the\nSchool on Roke, if that is what you decide; or to the Great Port, if the Mage\nRestive will take you on, as I think he will, with my recommendation. But I\nadvise against visiting home. The entanglement of family, friends, and so on\nis precisely what you need to be free of. Now, and henceforth.”\n\n“Do wizards have no family?”\n\nHemlock was glad to see a bit of fire in the boy. “They are one another’s\nfamily,” he said.\n\n“And no friends?”\n\n“They may be friends. Did I say it was an easy life?” A pause. Hemlock looked\ndirectly at Diamond. “There was a girl,” he said.\n\nDiamond met his gaze for a moment, looked down, and said nothing.\n\n“Your father told me. A witch’s daughter, a childhood playmate. He believed\nthat you had taught her spells.”\n\n“She taught me.”\n\nHemlock nodded. “That is quite understandable, among children. And quite\nimpossible now. Do you understand that?” “No,” Diamond said.\n\n“Sit down,” said Hemlock. After a moment Diamond took the stiff, high-backed\nchair facing him.\n\n“I can protect you here, and have done so. On Roke, of course, you’ll be\nperfectly safe. The very walls, there...But if you go home, you must be\nwilling to protect yourself. It’s a difficult thing for a young man, very\ndifficult—a test of a will that has not yet been steeled, a mind that has not\nyet seen its true goal. I very strongly advise that you not take that risk.\nWrite your parents, and go to the Great Port, or to Roke. Half your year’s\nfee, which I’ll return to you, will see to your first expenses.”\n\nDiamond sat upright and still. He had been getting some of his father’s height\nand girth lately, and looked very much a man, though a very young one.\n\n“What did you mean, Master Hemlock, in saying that you had protected me here?”\n\n“Simply as I protect myself,” the wizard said; and after a moment, testily,\n“The bargain, boy. The power we give for our power. The lesser state of being\nwe forego. Surely you know that every true man of power is celibate.”\n\nThere was a pause, and Diamond said, “So you saw to it...that I...”\n\n“Of course. It was my responsibility as your teacher.”\n\nDiamond nodded. He said, “Thank you.” Presently he stood up.\n\n“Excuse me, Master,” he said. “I have to think.”\n\n“Where are you going?”\n\n“Down to the waterfront.”\n\n“Better stay here.”\n\n“I can’t think, here.”\n\nHemlock might have known then what he was up against; but having told the boy\nhe would not be his master any longer, he could not in conscience command him.\n“You have a true gift, Essiri,” he said, using the name he had given the boy\nin the springs of the Amia, a word that in the Old Speech means Willow. “I\ndon’t entirely understand it. I think you don’t understand it at all. Take\ncare! To misuse a gift, or to refuse to use it, may cause great loss, great\nharm.”\n\nDiamond nodded, suffering, contrite, unrebellious, unmovable.\n\n“Go on,” the wizard said, and he went.\n\nLater he knew he should never have let the boy leave the house. He had\nunderestimated Diamond’s willpower, or the strength of the spell the girl had\nlaid on him. Their conversation was in the morning; Hemlock went back to the\nancient cantrip he was annotating; it was not till supper time that he thought\nabout his pupil, and not until he had eaten supper alone that he admitted that\nDiamond had run away.\n\nHemlock was 10th to practice any of the lesser arts of magic. He did not put\nout a finding spell, as any sorcerer might have done. Nor did he call to\nDiamond in any way. He was angry; perhaps he was hurt. He had thought well of\nthe boy, and offered to write the Summoner about him, and then at the first\ntest of character Diamond had broken. “Glass,” the wizard muttered. At least\nthis weakness proved he was not dangerous. Some talents were best not left to\nrun wild, but there was no harm in this fellow, no malice. No ambition. “No\nspine,” said Hemlock to the silence of the house. “Let him crawl home to his\nmother.”\n\nStill it rankled him that Diamond had let him down flat, without a word of\nthanks or apology. So much for good manners, he thought.\n\nAs she blew out the lamp and got into bed, the witch’s daughter heard an owl\ncalling, the little, liquid hu-hu-hu-hu that made people call them laughing\nowls. She heard it with a mournful heart. That had been their signal, summer\nnights, when they sneaked out to meet in the willow grove down on the banks of\nthe Amia, when everybody else was sleeping. She would not think of him at\nnight. Back in the winter she had sent to him night after night. She had\nlearned her mother’s spell of sending, and knew that it was a true spell. She\nhad sent him her touch, her voice saying his name, again and again. She had\nmet a wall of air and silence. She touched nothing. He would not hear.\n\nSeveral times, all of a sudden, in the daytime, there had been a moment when\nshe had known him close in mind and could touch him if she reached out. But at\nnight she knew only his blank absence, his refusal of her. She had stopped\ntrying to reach him, months ago, but her heart was still very sore.\n\n“Hu-hu-hu,” said the owl, under her window, and then it said, “Darkrose!”\nStartled from her misery, she leaped out of bed and opened the shutters.\n\n“Come on out,” whispered Diamond, a shadow in the starlight.\n\n“Mother’s not home. Come in!” She met him at the door.\n\nThey held each other tight, hard, silent for a long time. To Diamond it was as\nif he held his future, his own life, his whole life, in his arms.\n\nAt last she moved, and kissed his cheek, and whispered, “I missed you, I\nmissed you, I missed you. How long can you stay?”\n\n“As long as I like.”\n\nShe kept his hand and led him in. He was always a little reluctant to enter\nthe witch’s house, a pungent, disorderly place thick with the mysteries of\nwomen and witchcraft, very different from his own clean comfortable home, even\nmore different from the cold austerity of the wizard’s house. He shivered like\na horse as he stood there, too tall for the herb-festooned rafters. He was\nvery highly strung, and worn out, having walked forty miles in sixteen hours\nwithout food.\n\n“Where’s your mother?” he asked in a whisper.\n\n“Sitting with old Ferny. She died this afternoon, Mother will be there all\nnight. But how did you get here?”\n\n“Walked.”\n\n“The wizard let you visit home?”\n\n“I ran away.”\n\n“Ran away! Why?”\n\n“To keep you.”\n\nHe looked at her, that vivid, fierce, dark face in its rough cloud of hair.\nShe wore only her shift, and he saw the infinitely delicate, tender rise of\nher breasts. He drew her to him again, but though she hugged him she drew away\nagain, frowning.\n\n“Keep me?” she repeated. “You didn’t seem to worry about losing me all winter.\nWhat made you come back now?”\n\n“He wanted me to go to Roke.”\n\n“To Roke?” She stared. “To Roke, Di? Then you really do have the gift—you\ncould be a sorcerer?”\n\nTo find her on Hemlock’s side was a blow.\n\n“Sorcerers are nothing to him. He means I could be a wizard. Do magery. Not\njust witchcraft.”\n\n“Oh I see,” Rose said after a moment. “But I don’t see why you ran away.”\n\nThey had let go of each other’s hands.\n\n“Don’t you understand?” he said, exasperated with her for not understanding,\nbecause he had not understood. “A wizard can’t have anything to do with women.\nWith witches. With all that.”\n\n“Oh, I know. It’s beneath them.”\n\n“It’s not just beneath them—“\n\n“Oh, but it is. I’ll bet you had to unlearn every spell I taught you. Didn’t\nyou?”\n\n“It isn’t the same kind of thing.”\n\n“No. It isn’t the High Art. It isn’t the True Speech. A wizard mustn’t soil\nhis lips with common words. “Weak as women’s magic, wicked as women’s magic,”\nyou think I don’t know what they say? So, why did you come back here?”\n\n“To see you!”\n\n“What for?”\n\n“What do you think?”\n\n“You never sent to me, you never let me send to you, all the time you were\ngone. I was just supposed to wait until you got tired of playing wizard. Well,\nI got tired of waiting.” Her voice was nearly inaudible, a rough whisper.\n\n“Somebody’s been coming around,” he said, incredulous that she could turn\nagainst him. “Who’s been after you?”\n\n“None of your business if there is! You go off, you turn your back on me.\nWizards can’t have anything to do with what I do, what my mother does. Well, I\ndon’t want anything to do with what you do, either, ever. So go!”\n\nStarving hungry, frustrated, misunderstood, Diamond reached out to hold her\nagain, to make her body understand his body, repeating that first, deep\nembrace that had held all the years of their lives in it. He found himself\nstanding two feet back, his hands stinging and his ears ringing and his eyes\ndazzled. Thc lightning was in Rose’s eyes, and her hands sparked as she\nclenched them. “Never do that again,” she whispered.\n\n“Never fear,” Diamond said, turned on his heel, and strode out. A string of\ndried sage caught on his head and trailed after him.\n\nHE SPENT THE NIGHT in their old place in the sallows. Maybe he hoped she would\ncome, but she did not come, and he soon slept in sheer weariness. He woke in\nthe first, cold light. He sat up and thought. He looked at life in that cold\nlight. It was a different matter from what he had believed it. He went down to\nthe stream in which he had been named. He drank, washed his hands and face,\nmade himself look as decent as he could, and went up through the town to the\nfine house at the high end, his father’s house.\n\nAfter the first outcries and embraces, the servants and his mother sat him\nright down to breakfast. So it was with warm food in his belly and a certain\nchill courage in his heart that he faced his father, who had been out before\nbreakfast seeing off a string of timber-carts to the Great Port.\n\n“Well, son!” They touched cheeks. “So Master Hemlock gave you a vacation?”\n\n“No, sir. I left.”\n\nGolden stared, then filled his plate and sat down. “Left,” he said.\n\n“Yes, sir. I decided that I don’t want to be a wizard.”\n\n“Hmf,” said Golden, chewing. “Left of your own accord? Entirely? With the\nMaster’s permission?”\n\n“Of my own accord entirely, without his permission.”\n\nGolden chewed very slowly, his eyes on the table. Diamond had seen his father\nlook like this when a forester reported an infestation in the chestnut groves,\nand when he found a mule-dealer had cheated him.\n\n“He wanted me to go to the College on Roke to study with the Master Summoner.\nHe was going to send me there. I decided not to go.”\n\nAfter a while Golden asked, still looking at the table, “Why?”\n\n“It isn’t the life I want.”\n\nAnother pause. Golden glanced over at his wife, who stood by the window\nlistening in silence. Then he looked at his son. Slowly the mixture of anger,\ndisappointment, confusion, and respect on his face gave way to something\nsimpler, a look of complicity, very nearly a wink. “I see,” he said. “And what\ndid you decide you want?”\n\nA pause. “This,” Diamond said. His voice was level. He looked neither at his\nfather nor his mother.\n\n“Hah!” said Golden. “Well! I will say I’m glad of it, son.” He ate a small\nporkpie in one mouthful. “Being a wizard, going to Roke, all that, it never\nseemed real, not exactly. And with you off there, I didn’t know what all this\nwas for, to tell you the truth. All my business. If you’re here, it adds up,\nyou see. It adds up. Well! But listen here, did you just run off from the\nwizard? Did he know you were going?”\n\n“No. I’ll write him,” Diamond said, in his new, level voice.\n\n“He won’t be angry? They say wizards have short tempers. Full of pride.”\n\n“He’s angry,” Diamond said, “but he won’t do anything.”\n\nSo it proved. Indeed, to Golden’s amazement, Master Hemlock sent back a\nscrupulous two-fifths of the prenticing-fee. With the packet, which was\ndelivered by one of Golden’s carters who had taken a load of spars down to\nSouth Port, was a note for Diamond. It said, “True art requires a single\nheart.” The direction on the outside was the Hardic rune for willow. The note\nwas signed with Hemlock’s rune, which had two meanings: the hemlock tree, and\nsuffering.\n\nDiamond sat in his own sunny room upstairs, on his comfortable bed, hearing\nhis mother singing as she went about the house. He held the wizard’s letter\nand reread the message and the two runes many times. The cold and sluggish\nmind that had been born in him that morning down in the sallows accepted the\nlesson. No magic. Never again. He had never given his heart to it. It had been\na game to him, a game to play with Darkrose. Even the names of the True Speech\nthat he had learned in the wizard’s house, though he knew the beauty and the\npower that lay in them, he could let go, let slip, forget. That was not his\nlanguage.\n\nHe could speak his language only with her. And he had lost her, let her go.\nThe double heart has no true speech. From now on he could talk only the\nlanguage of duty: the getting and the spending, the outlay and the income, the\nprofit and the loss.\n\nAnd beyond that, nothing. There had been illusions, little spells, pebbles\nthat turned to butterflies, wooden birds that flew on living wings for a\nminute or two. There had never been a choice, really. There was only one way\nfor him to go.\n\nGOLDEN WAS immensely happy and quite unconscious of it. “Old man’s got his\njewel back,” said the carter to the forester. “Sweet as new butter, he is.”\nGolden, unaware of being sweet, thought only how sweet life was. He had bought\nthe Reche grove, at a very stiff price to be sure, but at least old Lowbough\nof Easthill hadn’t got it, and now he and Diamond could develop it as it ought\nto be developed. In among the chestnuts there were a lot of pines, which could\nbe felled and sold for masts and spars and small lumber, and replanted with\nchestnut seedlings. It would in time be a pure stand like the Big Grove, the\nheart of his chestnut kingdom. In time, of course. Oak and chestnut don’t\nshoot up overnight like alder and willow. But there was time. There was time,\nnow. The boy was barely seventeen, and he himself just forty-five. In his\nprime. He had been feeling old, but that was nonsense. He was in his prime.\nThe oldest trees, past bearing, ought to come out with the pines. Some good\nwood for furniture could be salvaged from them.\n\n“Well, well, well,” he said to his wife, frequently, “all rosy again, eh? Got\nthe apple of your eye back home, eh? No more moping, eh?”\n\nAnd Tuly smiled and stroked his hand.\n\nOnce instead of smiling and agreeing, she said, “It’s lovely to have him back,\nbut” and Golden stopped hearing. Mothers were born to worry about their\nchildren, and women were born never to be content. There was no reason why he\nshould listen to the litany of anxieties by which Tuly hauled herself through\nlife. Of course she thought a merchant’s life wasn’t good enough for the boy.\nShe’d have thought being King in Havnor wasn’t good enough for him.\n\n“When he gets himself a girl,” Golden said, in answer to whatever it was she\nhad been saying, “he’ll be all squared away. Living with the wizards, you\nknow, the way they are, it set him back a bit. Don’t worry about Diamond.\nHe’ll know what he wants when he sees it!”\n\n“I hope so,” said Tuly.\n\n“At least he’s not seeing the witch’s girl,” said Golden. “That’s done with.”\nLater on it occurred to him that neither was his wife seeing the witch\nanymore. For years they’d been thick as thieves, against all his warnings, and\nnow Tangle was never anywhere near the house. Women’s friendships never\nlasted. He teased her about it. Finding her strewing pennyroyal and\nmiller’s-bane in the chests and clothes-presses against an infestation of\nmoths, he said, “Seems like you’d have your friend the wise woman up to hex\n‘em away. Or aren’t you friends anymore?”\n\n“No,” his wife said in her soft, level voice, “we aren’t.”\n\n“And a good thing too!” Golden said roundly. “What’s become of that daughter\nof hers, then? Went off with a juggler, I heard?”\n\n“A musician,” Tuly said. “Last summer.”\n\n“A NAMEDAY PARTY,” said Golden. “Time for a bit of play, a bit of music and\ndancing, boy. Nineteen years old. Celebrate it!”\n\n“I’ll be going to Easthill with Sul’s mules.”\n\n“No, no, no. Sul can handle it. Stay home and have your party. You’ve been\nworking hard. We’ll hire a band. Who’s the best in the country? Tarry and his\nlot?”\n\n“Father, I don’t want a party,” Diamond said and stood up, shivering his\nmuscles like a horse. He was bigger than Golden now, and when he moved\nabruptly it was startling. “I’ll go to Easthill,” he said, and left the room.\n\n“What’s that all about?” Golden said to his wife, a rhetorical question. She\nlooked at him and said nothing, a non-rhetorical answer.\n\nAfter Golden had gone out, she found her son in the counting-room going\nthrough ledgers. She looked at the pages. Long, long lists of names and\nnumbers, debts and credits, profits and losses.\n\n“Di,” she said, and he looked up. His face was still round and a bit peachy,\nthough the bones were heavier and the eyes were melancholy.\n\n“I didn’t mean to hurt Father’s feelings,” he said.\n\n“If he wants a party, he’ll have it,” she said. Their voices were alike, being\nin the higher register but dark-toned, and held to an even quietness,\ncontained, restrained. She perched on a stool beside his at the high desk.\n\n“I can’t,” he said, and stopped, and went on, “I really don’t want to have any\ndancing.”\n\n“He’s matchmaking,” Tuly said, dry, fond.\n\n“I don’t care about that.”\n\n“I know you don’t.”\n\n“The problem is...”\n\n“The problem is the music,” his mother said at last.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“My son, there is no reason,” she said, suddenly passionate, “there is no\nreason why you should give up everything you love!”\n\nHe took her hand and kissed it as they sat side by side.\n\n“Things don’t mix,” he said. “They ought to, but they don’t. I found that out.\nWhen I left the wizard, I thought I could be everything. You know—do magic,\nplay music, be Father’s son, love Rose.... It doesn’t work that way. Things\ndon’t mix.”\n\n“They do, they do,” Tuly said. “Everything is hooked together, tangled up!”\n\n“Maybe things are, for women. But I...I can’t be double-hearted.”\n\n“Double-hearted? You? You gave up wizardry because you knew that if you\ndidn’t, you’d betray it.”\n\nHe took the word with a visible shock, but did not deny it.\n\n“But why did you give up music?”\n\n“I have to have a single heart. I can’t play the harp while I’m bargaining\nwith a mule-breeder. I can’t sing ballads while I’m figuring what we have to\npay the pickers to keep ‘em from hiring out to Lowbough!” His voice shook a\nlittle now, a vibrato, and his eyes were not sad, but angry.\n\n“So you put a spell on yourself,” she said, “just as that wizard put one on\nyou. A spell to keep you safe. To keep you with the mule-breeders, and the\nnut-pickers, and these.” She struck the ledger full of lists of names and\nfigures, a flicking, dismissive tap. “A spell of silence,” she said.\n\nAfter a long time the young man said, “What else can I do?”\n\n“I don’t know, my dear. I do want you to be safe. I do love to see your father\nhappy and proud of you. But I can’t bear to see you unhappy, without pride! I\ndon’t know. Maybe you’re right. Maybe for a man it’s only one thing ever. But\nI miss hearing you sing.”\n\nShe was in tears. They hugged, and she stroked his thick, shining hair and\napologized for being cruel, and he hugged her again and said she was the\nkindest mother in the world, and so she went off. But as she left she turned\nback a moment and said, “Let him have the party, Di. Let yourself have it.”\n\n“I will,” he said, to comfort her.\n\nGOLDEN ordered the beer and food and fireworks, but Diamond saw to hiring the\nmusicians.\n\n“Of course I’ll bring my band,” Tarry said, “fat chance I’d miss it! You’ll\nhave every tootler in the west of the world here for one of your dad’s\nparties.”\n\n“You can tell ‘em you’re the band that’s getting paid.”\n\n“Oh, they’ll come for the glory,” said the harper, a lean, long-jawed, wall-\neyed fellow of forty. “Maybe you’ll have a go with us yourself, then? You had\na hand for it, before you took to making money. And the voice not bad, if\nyou’d worked on it.”\n\n“I doubt it,” Diamond said.\n\n“That girl you liked, witch’s Rose, she’s tuning about with Labby, I hear. No\ndoubt they’ll come by.”\n\n“I’ll see you then,” said Diamond, looking big and handsome and indifferent,\nand walked off.\n\n“Too high and mighty these days to stop and talk,” said Tarry, “though I\ntaught him all he knows of harping. But what’s that to a rich man?”\n\nTARRY’S MALICE had left his nerves raw, and the thought of the party weighed\non him till he lost his appetite. He thought hopefully for a while that he was\nsick and could miss the party. But the day came, and he was there. Not so\nevidently, so eminently, so flamboyantly there as his father, but present,\nsmiling, dancing. All his childhood friends were there too, half of them\nmarried by now to the other half, it seemed, but there was still plenty of\nflirting going on, and several pretty girls were always near him. He drank a\ngood deal of Gadge Brewer’s excellent beer, and found he could endure the\nmusic if he was dancing to it and talking and laughing while he danced. So he\ndanced with all the pretty girls in turn, and then again with whichever one\nturned up again, which all of them did.\n\nIt was Golden’s grandest party yet, with a dancing floor built on the town\ngreen down the way from Golden’s house, and a tent for the old folks to eat\nand drink and gossip in, and new clothes for the children, and jugglers and\npuppeteers, some of them hired and some of them coming by to pick up whatever\nthey could in the way of coppers and free beer. Any festivity drew itinerant\nentertainers and musicians it was their living, and though uninvited they were\nwelcomed. A tale-singer with a droning voice and a droning bagpipe was singing\nThe Deed of the Dragonlord to a group of people under the big oak on the\nhilltop. When Tarry’s band of harp, fife, viol, and drum took time off for a\nbreather and a swig, a new group hopped up onto the dance floor. “Hey, there’s\nLabby’s band!” cried the pretty girl nearest Diamond. “Come on, they’re the\nbest!”\n\nLabby, a light-skinned, flashy-looking fellow, played the double-reed\nwoodhorn.\n\nWith him were a violist, a tabor-player, and Rose, who played fife. Their\nfirst tune was a stampy, fast and brilliant, too fast for some of the dancers.\nDiamond and his partner stayed in, and people cheered and clapped them when\nthey finished the dance, sweating and panting. “Beer!” Diamond cried, and was\ncarried off in a swirl of young men and women, all laughing and chattering.\n\nHe heard behind him the next tune start up, the viol alone, strong and sad as\na tenor voice: “Where My Love Is Going.”\n\nHe drank a mug of beer down in one draft, and the girls with him watched the\nmuscles in his strong throat as he swallowed, and they laughed and chattered,\nand he shivered all over like a cart horse stung by flies. He said, “Oh! I\ncan’t --!” He bolted off into the dusk beyond the lanterns hanging around the\nbrewer’s booth. “Where’s he going?” said one, and another, “He’ll be back,”\nand they laughed and chattered.\n\nThe tune ended. “Darkrose,” he said, behind her in the dark. She turned her\nhead and looked at him. Their heads were on a level, she sitting crosslegged\nup on the dance platform, he kneeling on the grass.\n\n“Come to the sallows,” he said.\n\nShe said nothing. Labby, glancing at her, set his woodhorn to his lips. The\ndrummer struck a triple beat on his tabor, and they were off into a sailor’s\njig.\n\nWhen she looked around again Diamond was gone.\n\nTarry came back with his band in an hour or so, ungrateful for the respite and\nmuch the worse for beer. He interrupted the tune and the dancing, telling\nLabby loudly to clear out.\n\n“Ah, pick your nose, harp-picker,” Labby said, and Tarry took offense, and\npeople took sides, and while the dispute was at its brief height, Rose put her\nfife in her pocket and slipped away.\n\nAway from the lanterns of the party it was dark, but she knew the way in the\ndark. He was there. The willows had grown, these two years. There was only a\nlittle space to sit among the green shoots and the long, falling leaves.\n\nThe music started up, distant, blurred by wind and the murmur of the river\nrunning.\n\n“What did you want, Diamond?”\n\n“To talk.”\n\nThey were only voices and shadows to each other.\n\n“So,” she said.\n\n“I wanted to ask you to go away with me,” he said.\n\n“When?”\n\n“Then. When we quarreled. I said it all wrong. I thought....” A long pause. “I\nthought I could go on running away. With you. And play music. Make a living.\nTogether. I meant to say that.”\n\n“You didn’t say it.”\n\n“I know. I said everything wrong. I did everything wrong. I betrayed\neverything. The magic. And the music. And you.”\n\n“I’m all right,” she said.\n\n“Are you?”\n\n“I’m not really good on the fife, but I’m good enough. What you didn’t teach\nme, I can fill in with a spell, if I have to. And the band, they’re all right.\nLabby isn’t as bad as he looks. Nobody fools with me. We make a pretty good\nliving. Winters, I go stay with Mother and help her out. So I’m all right.\nWhat about you, Di?”\n\n“All wrong.”\n\nShe started to say something, and did not say it.\n\n“I guess we were children,” he said. “Now....”\n\n“What’s changed?”\n\n“I made the wrong choice.”\n\n“Once?” she said. “Or twice?”\n\n“Twice.”\n\n“Third time’s the charm.”\n\nNeither spoke for a while. She could just make out the bulk of him in the\nleafy shadows. “You’re bigger than you were,” she said. “Can you still make a\nlight, Di? I want to see you.”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“That was the one thing you could do that I never could. And you never could\nteach me.”\n\n“I didn’t know what I was doing,” he said. “Sometimes it worked, sometimes it\ndidn’t.”\n\n“And the wizard in South Port didn’t teach you how to make it work?”\n\n“He only taught me names.”\n\n“Why can’t you do it now?”\n\n“I gave it up, Darkrose. I had to either do it and nothing else, or not do it.\nYou have to have a single heart.”\n\n“I don’t see why,” she said. “My mother can cure a fever and ease a childbirth\nand find a lost ring, maybe that’s nothing compared to what the wizards and\nthe dragonlords can do, but it’s not nothing, all the same. And she didn’t\ngive up anything for it. Having me didn’t stop her. She had me so that she\ncould learn how to do it! Just because I learned how to play music from you,\ndid I have to give up saying spells? I can bring a fever down now too. Why\nshould you have to stop doing one thing so you can do the other?”\n\n“My father,” he began, and stopped, and gave a kind of laugh. “They don’t go\ntogether,” he said. “The money and the music.”\n\n“The father and the witch-girl,” said Darkrose.\n\nAgain there was silence between them. The leaves of the willows stirred.\n\n“Would you come back to me?” he said. “Would you go with me, live with me,\nmarry me, Darkrose?”\n\n“Not in your father’s house, Di.”\n\n“Anywhere. Run away.”\n\n“But you can’t have me without the music.”\n\n“Or the music without you.”\n\n“I would,” she said.\n\n“Does Labby want a harper?”\n\nShe hesitated; she laughed. “If he wants a fife-player,” she said.\n\n“I haven’t practiced ever since I left, Darkrose,” he said. “But the music was\nalways in my head, and you....” She reached out her hands to him. They knelt\nfacing, the willow-leaves moving across their hair. They kissed each other,\ntimidly at first.\n\nIN THE YEARS after Diamond left home, Golden made more money than he had ever\ndone before. All his deals were profitable. It was as if good fortune stuck to\nhim and he could not shake it off. He grew immensely wealthy.\n\nHe did not forgive his son. It would have made a happy ending, but he would\nnot have it. To leave so, without a word, on his nameday night, to go off with\nthe witch-girl, leaving all the honest work undone, to be a vagrant musician,\na harper twanging and singing and grinning for pennies—there was nothing but\nshame and pain and anger in it for Golden. So he had his tragedy.\n\nTuly shared it with him for a long time, since she could see her son only by\nlying to her husband, which she found hard to do. She wept to think of Diamond\nhungry, sleeping hard. Cold nights of autumn were a misery to her. But as time\nwent on and she heard him spoken of as Diamond the sweet singer of the West of\nHavnor, Diamond who had harped and sung to the great lords in the Tower of the\nSword, her heart grew lighter. And once, when Golden was down ‘at South Port,\nshe and Tangle took a donkey cart and drove over to Easthill, where they heard\nDiamond sing the Lay of the Lost Queen, while Rose sat with them, and Little\nTuly sat on Tuly’s knee. And if not a happy ending, that was a true joy, which\nmay be enough to ask for, after all.\n\n\nThe Bones of the Earth\n\n  \n\nIT WAS RAINING AGAIN, and the wizard of Re Albi was sorely tempted to make a\nweather spell, just a little, small spell, to send the rain on round the\nmountain. His bones ached. They ached for the sun to come out and shine\nthrough his flesh and dry them out. Of course he could say a pain spell, but\nall that would do was hide the ache for a while. There was no cure for what\nailed him. Old bones need the sun. The wizard stood still in the doorway of\nhis house, between the dark room and the rain-streaked open air, preventing\nhimself from making a spell, and angry at himself for preventing himself and\nfor having to be prevented.\n\nHe never swore-men of power do not swear, it is not safe-but he cleared his\nthroat with a coughing growl, like a bear. A moment later a thunderclap rolled\noff the hidden upper slopes of Gont Mountain, echoing round from north to\nsouth, dying away in the cloud-filled forests.\n\nA good sign, thunder, Dulse thought. It would stop raining soon. He pulled up\nhis hood and went out into the rain to feed the chickens.\n\nHe checked the henhouse, finding three eggs. Red Bucca was setting. Her eggs\nwere about due to hatch. The mites were bothering her, and she looked scruffy\nand jaded. He said a few words against mites, told himself to remember to\nclean out the nest box as soon as the chicks hatched, and went on to the\npoultry yard, where Brown Bucca and Grey and Leggings and Candor and the King\nhuddled under the eaves making soft, shrewish remarks about rain.\n\n“It’ll stop by midday,” the wizard told the chickens. He fed them and\nsquelched back to the house with three warm eggs. When he was a child he had\nliked to walk in mud. He remembered enjoying the cool of it rising between his\ntoes. He still like to go barefoot, but no longer enjoyed mud; it was sticky\nstuff, and he disliked stooping to clean his feet before going into the house.\nWhen he’d had a dirt floor it hadn’t mattered, but now he had a wooden floor,\nlike a lord or a merchant or an archmage. To keep the cold and damp out of his\nbones. Not his own notion. Silence had come up from Gont Port, last spring, to\nlay a floor in the old house. They had had one of their arguments about it. He\nshould have known better, after all this time, than to argue with Silence.\n\n“I’ve walked on dirt for seventy-five years,” Dulse had said. “A few more\nwon’t kill me!”\n\nTo which Silence of course had said nothing, letting him hear what he had said\nand feel its foolishness thoroughly.\n\n“Dirt’s easier to keep clean,” he said, knowing the struggle already lost. It\nwas true that all you had to do with a good hard-packed clay floor was sweep\nit and now and then sprinkle it to keep the dust down. But it sounded silly\nall the same.\n\n“Who’s to lay this floor?” he said, now merely querulous.\n\nSilence nodded, meaning himself.\n\nThe boy was in fact a workman of the first order, carpenter, cabinetmaker,\nstonelayer, roofer; he had proved that when he lived up here as Dulse’s\nstudent, and his life with the rich folk of Gont Port had not softened his\nhands. He brought the boards from Sixth’s mill in Re Albi, driving Gammer’s\nox-team; he laid the floor and polished it the next day, while the old wizard\nwas up at Bog Lake gathering simples. When Dulse came home there it was,\nshining like a dark lake itself. “Have to wash my feet every time I come in,”\nhe grumbled. He walked in gingerly. The wood was so smooth it seemed soft to\nthe bare sole. “Satin,” he said. “You didn’t do all that in one day without a\nspell or two. A village hut with a palace floor. Well, it’ll be a sight, come\nwinter, to see the fire shine in that! Or do I have to get me a carpet now? A\nfleecefell, on a golden warp?”\n\nSilence smiled. He was pleased with himself.\n\nHe had turned up on Dulse’s doorstep a few years ago. Well, no, twenty years\nago it must be, or twenty-five. A while ago now. He had been truly a boy then,\nlong-legged, rough-haired, soft-faced, with a set mouth and clear eyes. “What\ndo you want?” the wizard had asked, knowing what he wanted, what they all\nwanted, and keeping his eyes from those clear eyes. He was a good teacher, the\nbest on Gont, he knew that. But he was tired of teaching, and didn’t want\nanother prentice underfoot, and sensed danger.\n\n“To learn,” the boy whispered.\n\n“Go to Roke,” the wizard said. The boy wore shoes and a good leather vest. He\ncould afford or earn ship’s passage to the School.\n\n“I’ve been there.”\n\nAt that Dulse looked him over again. No cloak, no staff.\n\n“Failed? Sent away? Ran away?”\n\nThe boy shook his head at each question. He shut his eyes; his mouth was\nalready shut. He stood there, intensely gathered, suffering: drew breath:\nlooked straight into the wizard’s eyes.\n\n“My mastery is here, on Gont,” he said, still speaking hardly above a whisper.\n“My master is Heleth”.\n\nAt that the wizard whose true name was Heleth stood as still as he did,\nlooking back at him, till the boy’s gaze dropped.\n\nIn silence Dulse sought his name, and saw two things: a fir-cone, and the rune\nof the Closed Mouth. Then seeking further he heard in his mind a name spoken;\nbut he did not speak it.\n\n“I’m tired of teaching and talking,” he said. “I need silence. Is that enough\nfor you?”\n\nThe boy nodded once.\n\n“Then to me you are Silence,” the wizard said. “You can sleep in the nook\nunder the west window. There’s an old pallet in the woodhouse. Air it. Don’t\nbring mice in with it.” And he stalked off towards the Overfell, angry with\nthe boy for coming and with himself for giving in; but it was not anger that\nmade his heart pound. Striding along-he could stride, then-with the seawind\npushing at him always from the left and the early sunlight on the sea out past\nthe vast shadow of the mountain, he thought of the Mages of Roke, the masters\nof the art magic, the professors of mystery and power. “He was too much for\n‘em, was he? And he’ll be too much for me,” he thought, and smiled. He was a\npeaceful man, but he did not mind a bit of danger.\n\nHe stopped and felt the dirt under his feet. He was barefoot, as usual. When\nhe was a student on Roke, he had worn shoes. But he had come back home to\nGont, to Re Albi, with his wizard’s staff, and kicked his shoes off. He stood\nstill and felt the dust and rock of the cliff-top path under his feet, and the\ncliffs under that, and the roots of the island in the dark under that. In the\ndark under the waters all islands touched and were one. So his teacher Ard had\nsaid, and so his teachers on Roke had said. But this was his island, his rock,\ndust, dirt. His wizardry grew out of it. “My mastery is here,” the boy had\nsaid, but it went deeper than mastery. That, perhaps, was something Dulse\ncould teach him: what went deeper than mastery. What he had learned here, on\nGont, before he ever went to Roke.\n\nAnd the boy must have a staff. Why had Nemmerle let him leave Roke without\none, empty-handed as a prentice or a witch? Power like that shouldn’t go\nwandering about unchannelled and unsignalled.\n\nMy teacher had no staff, Dulse thought, and at the same moment thought, He\nwants his staff from me. Gontish oak, from the hands of a Gontish wizard.\nWell, if he earns it I’ll make him one. If he can keep his mouth closed. And\nI’ll leave him my lore-books. If he can clean out a henhouse, and understand\nthe Glosses of Danemer, and keep his mouth closed.\n\nThe new student cleaned out the henhouse and hoed the bean-patch, learned the\nmeaning of the Glosses of Danemer and the Arcana of the Enlades, and kept his\nmouth closed. He listened. He heard what Dulse said; sometimes he heard what\nDulse thought. He did what Dulse wanted and what Dulse did not know he wanted.\nHis gift was far beyond Dulse’s guidance, yet he had been right to come to Re\nAlbi, and they both knew it.\n\nDulse thought sometimes in those years about sons and fathers. He had\nquarreled with his own father, a sorcerer-prospector, over his choice of a\nteacher; his father had shouted that a student of Ard’s was no son of his, had\nnursed his rage and died unforgiving.\n\nDulse had seen young men weep for joy at the birth of a first son. He had seen\npoor men pay witches a year’s earnings for the promise of a healthy boy, and a\nrich man touch his gold-bedizened baby’s face and whisper, adoring, “My\nimmortality!” He had seen men beat their sons, bully and humiliate them, spite\nand thwart them, hating the death they saw in them. He had seen the answering\nhatred in the son’s eyes, the threat, the pitiless contempt. And seeing it,\nDulse knew why he had never sought reconciliation with his father.\n\nHe had seen a father and son work together from daybreak to sundown, the old\nman guiding a blind ox, the middle-aged man driving the iron-bladed plough,\nnever a word spoken; as they started home the old man laid his hand a moment\non the son’s shoulder.\n\nHe had always remembered that. He remembered it now, when he looked across the\nhearth, winter evenings, at the dark face bent above a lore-book or a shirt\nthat needed mending. The eyes cast down, the mouth closed, the spirit\nlistening.\n\n“Once in his lifetime, if he’s lucky, a wizard finds somebody he can talk to.”\nNemmerle had said that to Dulse a night or two before he left Roke, a year or\ntwo before Nemmerle was chosen Archmage. He had been the Master Patterner and\nthe kindest of all Dulse’s teachers at the School. “I think, if you stayed,\nHeleth, we could talk.”\n\nDulse had been unable to answer at all for a while. Then, stammering, guilty\nat his ingratitude and incredulous at his obstinacy-“Master, I would stay, but\nmy work is on Gont-I wish it was here, with you-“\n\n“It’s a rare gift, to know where you need to be, before you’ve been to all the\nplaces you don’t need to be. Well, send me a student now and then. Roke needs\nGontish wizardry. I think we’re leaving things out, here, things worth\nknowing....”\n\nDulse had sent students on to the School, three or four of them, nice lads\nwith a gift for this or that; but the one Nemmerle waited for had come and\ngone of his own will, and what they had thought of him on Roke Dulse did not\nknow. Silence did not say. He had learned there in two or three years what\nsome boys learned in six or seven and many never learned at all, but to him it\nhad been mere groundwork.\n\n“Why didn’t you come to me first?” Dulse had demanded. “And then Roke, to put\na polish on it?”\n\n“I didn’t want to waste your time.”\n\n“Did Nemmerle know you were coming to work with me?”\n\nSilence shook his head.\n\n“If you’d deigned to tell him your intentions, he might have sent a message to\nme.”\n\nSilence looked stricken. “Was he your friend?”\n\nDulse paused. “He was my master. Would have been my friend, perhaps, if I’d\nstayed on Roke. Have wizards friends? No more than they have wives, or sons,\nsome would say.... Once he said to me that in our trade it’s a lucky man who\nfinds someone to talk to. Keep that in mind. If you’re lucky, one day you’ll\nhave to open your mouth.”\n\nSilence bowed his rough, thoughtful head.\n\n“If it hasn’t rusted shut,” Dulse added.\n\n“If you ask me to, I’ll talk,” the young man said, so earnest, so willing to\ndeny his whole nature at Dulse’s request that the wizard had to laugh.\n\n“I asked you not to,” he said, “and it’s not my need I spoke of. I talk enough\nfor two. Never mind. You’ll know what to say when the time comes. That’s the\nart, eh? What to say, and when to say it. And the rest is silence.”\n\nThe young man slept on a pallet under the little west window of Dulse’s house\nfor three years. He learned wizardry, fed the chickens, milked the cow. He\nsuggested, once, that Dulse keep goats. He had not said anything for a week or\nso, a cold, wet week of autumn. He said, “You might keep some goats.”\n\nDulse had the big lore-book open on the table. He had been trying to reweave\none of the Acastan Spells, much broken and made powerless by the Emanations of\nFundaur centuries ago. He had just begun to get a sense of the missing word\nthat might fill one of the gaps, he almost had it, and-“You might keep some\ngoats,” Silence said.\n\nDulse considered himself a wordy, impatient man with a short temper. The\nnecessity of not swearing had been a burden to him in his youth, and for\nthirty years the imbecility of apprentices, clients, cows, and chickens had\ntried him sorely. Apprentices and clients were afraid of his tongue, though\ncows and chickens paid no attention to his outbursts. He had never been angry\nat Silence before. There was a very long pause.\n\n“What for?”\n\nSilence apparently did not notice the pause or the extreme softness of Dulse’s\nvoice. “Milk, cheese, roast kid, company,” he said.\n\n“Have you ever kept goats?” Dulse asked, in the same soft, polite voice.\n\nSilence shook his head.\n\nHe was in fact a town boy, born in Gont Port. He had said nothing about\nhimself, but Dulse had asked around a bit. The father, a longshoreman, had\ndied in the big earthquake, when Silence would have been seven or eight; the\nmother was a cook at a waterfront inn. At twelve the boy had got into some\nkind of trouble, probably messing about with magic, and his mother had managed\nto prentice him to Elassen, a respectable sorcerer in Valmouth. There the boy\nhad picked up his true name, and some skill in carpentry and farmwork, if not\nmuch else; and Elassen had had the generosity, after three years, to pay his\npassage to Roke. That was all Dulse knew about him.\n\n“I dislike goat cheese,” Dulse said.\n\nSilence nodded, acceptant as always.\n\nFrom time to time in the years since then, Dulse remembered how he hadn’t lost\nhis temper when Silence asked about keeping goats; and each time the memory\ngave him a quiet satisfaction, like that of finishing the last bite of a\nperfectly ripe pear.\n\nAfter spending the next several days trying to recapture the missing word, he\nhad set Silence to studying the Acastan Spells. Together they had finally\nworked it out, a long toil. “Like ploughing with a blind ox,” Dulse said.\n\nNot long after that he had given Silence the staff he had made for him,\nGontish oak.\n\nAnd the Lord of Gont Port had tried once again to get Dulse to come down to do\nwhat needed doing in Gont Port, and Dulse had sent Silence down instead, and\nthere he had stayed.\n\nAnd Dulse was standing on his own doorstep, three eggs in his hand and the\nrain running cold down his back.\n\nHow long had he been standing here? Why was he standing here? He had been\nthinking about mud, about the floor, about Silence. Had he been out walking on\nthe path above the Overfell? No, that was years ago, years ago, in the\nsunlight. It was raining. He had fed the chickens, and come back to the house\nwith three eggs, they were still warm in his hand, silky brown lukewarm eggs,\nand the sound of thunder was still in his mind, the vibration of thunder was\nin his bones, in his feet. Thunder?\n\nNo. There had been a thunderclap, a while ago. This was not thunder. He had\nhad this queer feeling and had not recognized it, back then, before the\nearthquake that had sunk a half mile of the coast at Essary and swamped the\nwharfs at Gont Port.\n\nHe stepped down from the doorstep onto the dirt so that he could feel the\nground with the nerves of his soles, but the mud slimed and fouled any\nmessages the dirt had for him. He set the eggs down on the doorstep, sat down\nbeside them, cleaned his feet with rainwater from the pot by the step, wiped\nthem dry with the rag that hung on the handle of the pot, picked up the eggs,\nstood up slowly, and went into his house.\n\nHe gave a sharp look at his staff, which leaned in the corner behind the door.\nHe put the eggs in the larder, ate an apple quickly because he was hungry, and\ntook his staff. It was yew, bound at the foot with copper, worn to silk at the\ngrip. Nemmerle had given it to him.\n\n“Stand!” he said to it in its language, and let go of it. It stood as if he\nhad driven it into a socket.\n\n“To the root,” he said impatiently, in the language of the Making. “To the\nroot!”\n\nHe watched the staff that stood on the shining floor. In a little while he saw\nit quiver very slightly, a shiver, a tremble.\n\n“Ah, ah, ah,” said the old wizard.\n\n“What should I do?” he said aloud after a while.\n\nThe staff swayed, was still, shivered again.\n\n“Enough of that, my dear,” Dulse said, laying his hand on it. “Come now. No\nwonder I kept thinking about Silence. I should send for him ... send to him\n... No. What did Ard say? Find the center, find the center. That’s the\nquestion to ask. That’s what to do...” As he muttered on to himself, routing\nout his heavy cloak, setting water to boil on the small fire he had lighted\nearlier, he wondered if he had always talked to himself, if he had talked all\nthe time when Silence lived with him. No, it had become a habit after Silence\nleft, he thought, with the bit of his mind that went on thinking the ordinary\nthoughts of life, while the rest of it made preparations for terror and\ndestruction.\n\nHe hard-boiled the three new eggs and one already in the larder and put them\ninto a pouch along with four apples and a bladder of resinated wine, in case\nhe had to stay out all night. He shrugged arthritically into his heavy cloak,\ntook up his staff, told the fire to go out, and left.\n\nHe no longer kept a cow. He stood looking into the poultry yard, considering.\nThe fox had been visiting the orchard lately. But the birds would have to\nforage if he stayed away. They must take their chances, like everyone else. He\nopened their gate a little. Though the rain was no more than a misty drizzle\nnow, they stayed hunched up under the henhouse eaves, disconsolate. The King\nhad not crowed once this morning.\n\n“Have you anything to tell me?” Dulse asked them.\n\nBrown Bucca, his favorite, shook herself and said her name a few times. The\nothers said nothing.\n\n“Well, take care. I saw the fox on the full-moon night,” Dulse said, and went\non his way.\n\nAs he walked he thought; he thought hard; he recalled. He recalled all he\ncould of matters his teacher had spoken of once only and long ago. Strange\nmatters, so strange he had never known if they were true wizardry or mere\nwitchery, as they said on Roke. Matters he certainly had never heard about on\nRoke, nor did he ever speak about them there, maybe fearing the Masters would\ndespise him for taking such things seriously, maybe knowing they would not\nunderstand them, because they were Gontish matters, truths of Gont. They were\nnot written even in Ard’s lore-books, that had come down from the Great Mage\nEnnas of Perregal. They were all word of mouth. They were home truths.\n\n“If you need to read the Mountain,” his teacher had told him, “go to the Dark\nPond at the top of Semere’s cow pasture. You can see the ways from there. You\nneed to find the center. See where to go in.”\n\n“Go in?” the boy Dulse had whispered.\n\n“What could you do from outside?”\n\nDulse was silent for a long time, and then said, “How?”\n\n“Thus.” And Ard’s long arms had stretched out and upward in the invocation of\nwhat Dulse would know later was a great spell of Transforming. Ard spoke the\nwords of the spell awry, as teachers of wizardry must do lest the spell\noperate. Dulse knew the trick of hearing them aright and remembering them. At\nthe end he repeated them in his mind in silence, sketching the strange,\nawkward gestures that were part of them. All at once his hand stopped.\n\n“But you can’t undo this!” he said aloud.\n\nArd nodded. “It is irrevocable”.\n\nDulse knew no transformation that was irrevocable, no spell that could not be\nunsaid, except the Word of Unbinding, which is spoken only once.\n\n“But why-?”\n\n“At need,” Ard said.\n\nDulse knew better than to ask for explanation. The need to speak such a spell\ncould not come often; the chance of his ever having to use it was very slight.\nHe let the terrible spell sink down in his mind and be hidden and layered over\nwith a thousand useful or beautiful or enlightening mageries and charms, all\nthe lore and rules of Roke, all the wisdom of the books Ard had bequeathed\nhim. Crude, monstrous, useless, it lay in the dark of his mind for sixty\nyears, like the cornerstone of an earlier, forgotten house down in the cellar\nof a mansion full of lights and treasures and children.\n\nThe rain had ceased, though mist still hid the peak and shreds of cloud\ndrifted through the high forests. Dulse was not a tireless walker like\nSilence, who would have spent his life wandering in the forests of Gont\nMountain if he could; but he had been born in Re Albi and knew the roads and\nways around it as part of himself. He took the shortcut at Rissi’s well and\ncame out before midday on Semere’s high pasture, a level step on the\nmountainside. A mile below it, all sunlit now, the farm buildings stood in the\nlee of a hill, across which a flock of sheep moved like a cloud-shadow. Gont\nPort and its bay were hidden under the steep, knotted hills that stood above\nthe city.\n\nDulse wandered about a bit before he found what he took to be the Dark Pond.\nIt was small, half mud and reeds, with one vague, boggy path to the water, and\nno track on that but goat-hoofs. The water was dark, though it lay out under\nthe bright sky and far above the peat soils. Dulse followed the goat-tracks,\ngrowling when his foot slipped in the mud and he wrenched his ankle to keep\nfrom falling. At the brink of the water he stood still. He stooped to rub his\nankle. He listened.\n\nIt was absolutely silent.\n\nNo wind. No birdcall. No distant lowing or bleating or call of voice. As if\nall the island had gone still. Not a fly buzzed.\n\nHe looked at the dark water. It reflected nothing.\n\nReluctant, he stepped forward, barefoot and bare-legged; he had rolled up his\ncloak into his pack an hour ago when the sun came out. Reeds brushed his legs.\nThe mud was soft and sucking under his feet, full of tangling reed-roots. He\nmade no noise as he moved slowly out into the pool, and the circles of ripples\nfrom his movement were slight and small. It was shallow for a long way. Then\nhis cautious foot felt no bottom, and he paused.\n\nThe water shivered. He felt it first on his thighs, a lapping like the\ntickling touch of fur; then he saw it, the trembling of the surface all over\nthe pond. Not the round ripples he made, which had already died away, but a\nruffling, a roughening, a shudder, again, and again.\n\n“Where?” he whispered, and then said the word aloud in the language all things\nunderstand that have no other language.\n\nThere was the silence. Then a fish leapt from the black, shaking water, a\nwhite-grey fish the length of his hand, and as it leapt it cried out in a\nsmall, clear voice, in that same language, “Yaved!”\n\nThe old wizard stood there. He recollected all he knew of the names of Gont,\nand after a while he saw where Yaved was. It was the place where the ridges\nparted, just inland from Gont Port; the hinge of the headlands above the city;\nthe place of the fault. An earthquake centered there could shake the city\ndown, bring avalanche and tidal wave, close the cliffs of the bay together\nlike hands clapping. Dulse shivered, shuddered all over like the water of the\npool.\n\nHe turned and made for the shore, hasty, careless where he set his feet and\nnot caring if he broke the silence by splashing and breathing hard. He slogged\nback up the path through the reeds till he reached dry ground and coarse\ngrass, and heard the buzz of midges and crickets. He sat down then on the\nground, rather hard, for his legs were shaking.\n\n“It won’t do,” he said, talking to himself in Hardic, and then he said, “I\ncan’t do it.” Then he said, “I can’t do it by myself.”\n\nHe was so distraught that when he made up his mind to call Silence he could\nnot think of the opening of the spell, which he had known for sixty years;\nthen when he thought he had it, he began to speak a Summoning instead, and the\nspell had begun to work before he realised what he was doing and stopped and\nundid it word by word.\n\nHe pulled up some grass and rubbed at the slimy mud on his feet and legs. It\nwas not dry yet, and only smeared about on his skin. “I hate mud,” he\nwhispered. Then he snapped his jaws and stopped trying to clean his legs.\n“Dirt, dirt,” he said, gently patting the ground he sat on. Then, very slow,\nvery careful, he began to speak the spell of calling.\n\nIn a busy street leading down to the busy wharfs of Gont Port, the wizard\nOgion stopped short. The ship’s captain beside him walked on several steps and\nturned to see Ogion talking to the air.\n\n“But I will come, master!” he said. And then after a pause, “How soon?” And\nafter a longer pause, he told the air something in a language the ship’s\ncaptain did not understand, and made a gesture that darkened the air about him\nfor an instant.\n\n“Captain,” he said, “I’m sorry, I must wait to spell your sails. An earthquake\nis near. I must warn the city. Do you tell them down there, every ship that\ncan sail make for the open sea. Clear out, past the Armed Cliffs! Good luck to\nyou.” And he turned and ran back up the street, a tall, strong man with rough\ngreying hair, running now like a stag.\n\nGont Port lies at the inner end of a long narrow bay between steep shores. Its\nentrance from the sea is between two great headlands, the Gates of the Port,\nthe Armed Cliffs, not a hundred feet apart. They are safe from sea-pirates in\nGont Port. But their safety is their danger; the long bay follows a fault in\nthe earth, and jaws that have opened may shut.\n\nWhen he had done what he could to warn the city, and seen all the gate-guards\nand port-guards doing what they could to keep the few roads out from becoming\nchoked and murderous with panicky people, Ogion shut himself into a room in\nthe signal tower of the Port, locked the door, for everybody wanted him at\nonce, and sent a sending to the Dark Pond in Semere’s cow pasture up on the\nMountain.\n\nHis old master was sitting in the grass near the pond, eating an apple. Bits\nof eggshell flecked the ground near his legs, which were caked with drying\nmud. When he looked up and saw Ogion’s sending he smiled a wide, sweet smile.\nBut he looked old. He had never looked so old. Ogion had not seen him for over\na year, having been busy; he was always busy in Gont Port, doing the business\nof the lords and people, never a chance to walk in the forests on the\nmountainside or to come sit with Heleth in the little house at Re Albi and\nlisten and be still. Heleth was an old man, near eighty now; and he was\nfrightened. He smiled with joy to see Ogion, but he was frightened.\n\n“I think what we have to do,” he said without preamble, “is try to hold the\nfault from slipping much, you at the Gates and me at the inner end, in the\nMountain. Working together, you know. We might be able to. I can feel it\nbuilding up, can you?”\n\nOgion shook his head. He let his sending sit down in the grass near Heleth,\nthough it did not bend the stems of the grass where it stepped or sat. “I’ve\ndone nothing but set the city in a panic,” he said. “And send the ships out of\nthe bay. What is it you feel? How do you feel it?”\n\nThey were technical questions, mage to mage. Heleth hesitated before\nanswering.\n\n“I learned about this from Ard,” he said, and paused again.\n\nHe had never told Ogion anything about his first teacher, a sorcerer of no\nfame, even in Gont, and perhaps of ill fame. There was some mystery or shame\nconnected with Ard. Though he was talkative, for a wizard, Heleth was silent\nas a stone about some things. Ogion, who respected silence, had never asked\nhim about his teacher.\n\n“It’s not Roke magic,” the old man said. His voice was dry, a little forced.\n“Not to do with the Old Powers, either. Nothing of that sort. Nothing sticky.”\n\nThat had always been his word for evil doings, spells for gain, curses, black\nmagic: “sticky stuff.”\n\nAfter a while, searching for words, he went on: “Dirt. Rocks. It’s a dirty\nmagic. Old. Very old. As old as Gont Island.”\n\n“The Old Powers?” Ogion murmured.\n\nHeleth said. “I’m not sure.”\n\n“Will it control the earth itself?”\n\n“More a mater of getting in with it, I think.” The old man was burying the\ncore of his apple and the larger bits of eggshell under loose dirt, patting it\nover them neatly. “Of course I know the words, but I’ll have to learn what to\ndo as I go. That’s the trouble with the big spells, isn’t it? You learn what\nyou’re doing while you do it. No chance to practice. “Ah-there! You feel\nthat?”\n\nOgion shook his head.\n\n“Straining,” Heleth said, his hand still absently, gently patting the dirt as\none might pat a scared cow. “Quite soon now, I think. Can you hold the Gates\nopen, my dear?”\n\n“Tell me what you’ll be doing-“\n\nBut Heleth was shaking his head: “No,” he said, “no time. Not your kind of\nthing.” He was more and more distracted by whatever it was he sensed in the\nearth or air, and through him Ogion felt that gathering, intolerable tension.\n\nThey sat unspeaking. The crisis passed. Heleth relaxed a little and even\nsmiled. “Very old stuff,” he said, “what I’ll be doing. I wish now I’d thought\nabout it more. Passed it on to you. But it seemed a bit crude. Heavy-handed\n... She didn’t say where she’d learned it. Here, of course ... There are\ndifferent kinds of knowledge, after all.”\n\n“She?”\n\n“Ard. My teacher.” Heleth looked up, his face unreadable, its expression\npossibly sly. “You didn’t know that? No, I suppose I never mentioned it. But\nit doesn’t make much difference, after all. Since we none of us have any sex,\nus wizards, do we? What matters is whose house we live in. It seems we may\nhave left out a good deal worth knowing. This kind of thing-There! There\nagain-“\n\nHis sudden tension and immobility, the strained face and inward look, were\nlike those of a woman in labor when her womb contracts. That was Ogion’s\nthought, even as he said, “What did you mean, “in the Mountain’?”\n\nThe spasm passed; Heleth answered, “Inside it. There at Yaved.” He pointed to\nthe knotted hills below them. “I’ll go in, try to keep things from sliding\naround, eh? I’ll find out when I’m doing it, no doubt. I think you should be\ngetting back to yourself. Things are tightening up.” He stopped again, looking\nas if he were in intense pain, hunched and clenched. He struggled to stand up.\nUnthinking, Ogion held out his hand to help him.\n\n“No use,” said the old wizard, grinning, “you’re only wind and sunlight. Now\nI’m going to be dirt and stone. You’d best go on. Farewell, Aihal. Keep the-\nkeep the mouth open, for once, eh?”\n\nOgion, obedient, bringing himself back to himself in the stuffy, tapestried\nroom in Gont Port, did not understand the old man’s joke until he turned to\nthe window and saw the Armed Cliffs down at the end of the long bay, the jaws\nready to snap shut. “I will,” he said, and set to it.\n\n“What I have to do, you see,” the old wizard said, still talking to Silence\nbecause it was a comfort to talk to him even if he was no longer there, “is\nget into the mountain, right inside; but not the way a sorcerer-prospector\ndoes; not just slipping about between things and looking and tasting. Deeper.\nAll the way in. Not the veins, but the bones. So,” and standing there alone in\nthe high pasture, in the noon light, Heleth opened his arms wide in the\ngesture of invocation that opens all the greater spells; and he spoke.\n\nNothing happened as he said the words Ard had taught him, his old witch-\nteacher with her bitter mouth and her long, lean arms, the words spoken awry\nthen, spoken truly now.\n\nNothing happened, and he had time to regret the sunlight and the seawind, and\nto doubt the spell, and to doubt himself, before the earth rose up around him,\ndry, warm, and dark.\n\nIn there he knew he should hurry, that the bones of the earth ached to move,\nand that he must become them to guide them, but he could not hurry. There was\non him the bewilderment of any transformation. He had in his day been fox, and\nbull, and dragonfly, and knew what it was to change being. But this was\ndifferent, this slow enlargement. I am vastening, he thought.\n\nHe reached out towards Yaved, towards the ache, the suffering. As he came\ncloser to it he felt a great strength flow into him from the west, as if\nSilence had taken him by the hand after all. Through that link he could send\nhis own strength, the Mountain’s strength, to help. I didn’t tell him I wasn’t\ncoming back, he thought, his last words in Hardic, his last grief, for he was\nin the bones of the mountain now. He knew the arteries of fire, and the beat\nof the great heart. He knew what to do. It was in no tongue of man that he\nsaid, “Be quiet, be easy. There now, there. Hold fast. So, there. We can be\neasy.”\n\nAnd he was easy, he was still, he held fast, rock in rock and earth in earth\nin the fiery dark of the mountain.\n\nIt was their mage Ogion whom the people saw stand alone on the roof of the\nsignal tower on the wharf, when the streets ran up and down in waves, the\ncobbles bursting out of them, and walls of clay brick puffed into dust, and\nthe Armed Cliffs leaned together, groaning. It was Ogion they saw, his hands\nheld out before him, straining, parting: and the cliffs parted with them, and\nstood straight, unmoved. The city shuddered and stood still. It was Ogion who\nstopped the earthquake. They saw it, they said it.\n\nMy teacher was with me, and his teacher with him,” Ogion said when they\npraised him. “I could hold the Gate open because he held the Mountain still.”\nThey praised his modesty and did not listen to him. Listening is a rare gift,\nand men will have their heroes.\n\nWhen the city was in order again, and the ships had all come back, and the\nwalls were being rebuilt, Ogion escaped from praise and went up into the hills\nabove Gont Port. He found the queer little valley called Trimmer’s Dell, the\ntrue name of which in the language of the Making was Yaved, as Ogion’s true\nname was Aihal. He walked about there all one day, as if seeking something. In\nthe evening he lay down on the ground and talked to it. “You should have told\nme, I could have said goodbye,” he said. He wept once, and his tears fell on\nthe dry dirt among the grass-stems and made little spots of mud, little sticky\nspots.\n\nHe slept there, on the ground. At sunrise he got up and walked by the high\nroad over to Re Albi. He did not go into the village, but past it to the\nlittle house that stood alone to the north at the beginning of the Overfell.\nThe door of the house stood open.\n\nThe last beans had got big and coarse on the vines; the cabbages were\nthriving. Three hens came clucking and pecking around the dusty dooryard, a\nred, a brown, a white; a grey hen was setting her clutch in the henhouse.\nThere were no chicks, and no sign of the cock, the King, Heleth had called\nhim. The king is dead, Ogion thought. Maybe a chick is hatching even now to\ntake his place. He thought he caught a whiff of fox from the little orchard\nbehind the house.\n\nHe swept out the dust and leaves that had blown in the open door across the\npolished wood. He set Heleth’s mattress and blanket in the sun to air. “I’ll\nstay here a while,” he thought. “It’s a good house.” After a while he thought,\n“I might keep some goats.”\n\n  \n\nOn the High Marsh\n\nTHE ISLAND OF SEMEL lies north and west across the Pelnish Sea from Havnor,\nsouth and west of the Enlades. Though it is one of the great isles of the\nEarthsea Archipelago, there aren’t many stories from Semel. Enlad has its\nglorious history, and Havnor its wealth, and Paln its ill repute, but Semel\nhas only cattle and sheep, forests and little towns, and the great silent\nvolcano called Andanden standing over all.\n\nSouth of Andanden lies a land where the ashes fell a hundred feet deep when\nlast the volcano spoke. Rivers and streams cut their way seaward through that\nhigh plain, winding and pooling, spreading and wandering, making a marsh of\nit, a big, desolate, waterland with a far horizon, few trees, not many people.\nThe ashy soil grows a rich, bright grass, and the people there keep cattle,\nfattening beef for the populous southern coast, letting the animals stray for\nmiles across the plain, the rivers serving as fences.\n\nAs mountains will, Andanden makes the weather. It gathers clouds around it.\nThe summer is short, the winter long, out on the high marsh.\n\nIn the early darkness of a winter day, a traveler stood at the windswept\ncrossing of two paths, neither very promising, mere cattle tracks among the\nreeds, and looked for some sign of the way he should take.\n\nAs he came down the last slope of the mountain, he had seen houses here and\nthere out in the marshlands, a village not far away. He had thought he was on\nthe way to the village, but had taken a wrong turning somewhere. Tall reeds\nrose up close beside the paths, so that if a light shone anywhere he could not\nsee it. Water chuckled softly somewhere near his feet. He had used up his\nshoes walking round Andanden on the cruel roads of black lava. The soles were\nworn right through, and his feet ached with the icy damp of the marsh paths.\n\nIt grew darker quickly. A haze was coming up from the south, blotting out the\nsky. Only above the huge, dim bulk of the mountain did stars burn clearly.\nWind whistled in the reeds, soft, dismal.\n\nThe traveler stood at the crossway and whistled back at the reeds.\n\nSomething moved on one of the tracks, something big, dark, in the darkness.\n\n“Are you there, my dear?” said the traveler. He spoke in the Old Speech, the\nLanguage of the Making. “Come along, then, Ulla,” he said, and the heifer came\na step or two towards him, towards her name, while he walked to meet her. He\nmade out the big head more by touch than sight, stroking the silken dip\nbetween her eyes, scratching her forehead at the roots of the nubbin horns.\n“Beautiful, you are beautiful,” he told her, breathing her grassy breath,\nleaning against her large warmth. “Will you lead me, dear Ulla? Will you lead\nme where I need to go?”\n\nHe was fortunate in having met a farm heifer, not one of the roaming cattle\nwho would only have led him deeper into the marshes. His Ulla was given to\njumping fences, but after she had wandered a while she would begin to have\nfond thoughts of the cow barn and the mother from whom she still stole a\nmouthful of milk sometimes; and now she willingly took the traveler home. She\nwalked, slow but purposeful, down one of the tracks, and he went with her, a\nhand on her hip when the way was wide enough. When she waded a knee-deep\nstream, he held on to her tail. She scrambled up the low, muddy bank and\nflicked her tail loose, but she waited for him to scramble even more awkwardly\nafter her. Then she plodded gently on. He pressed against her flank and clung\nto her, for the stream had chilled him to the bone, and he was shivering.\n\n“Moo,” said his guide, softly, and he saw the dim, small square of yellow\nlight just a little to his left.\n\n“Thank you,” he said, opening the gate for the heifer, who went to greet her\nmother, while he stumbled across the dark houseyard to the door.\n\nIt would be Berry at the door, though why he knocked she didn’t know. “Come\nin, you fool!” she said, and he knocked again, and she put down her mending\nand went to the door. “Can you be drunk already?” she said, and then saw him.\n\nThe first thing she thought was a king, a lord, Maharion of the songs, tall,\nstraight, beautiful. The next thing she thought was a beggar, a lost man, in\ndirty clothes, hugging himself with shivering arms.\n\nHe said, “I lost my way. Have I come to the villager?” His voice was hoarse\nand harsh, a beggar’s voice, but not a beggar’s accent.\n\n“It’s a half mile on,” said Gift.\n\n“Is there an inn?”\n\n“Not till you’d come to Oraby, a ten-twelve miles on south.” She considered\nonly briefly. “If you need a room for the night, I have one. Or San might, if\nyou’re going to the village.”\n\n“I’ll stay here if I may,” he said in that princely way, with his teeth\nchattering, holding on to the doorjamb to keep on his feet.\n\n“Take your shoes off,” she said, “they’re soaking. Come in then.” She stood\naside and said, “Come to the fire,” and had him sit down in Bren’s settle\nclose to the hearth. “Stir the fire up a bit,” she said. “Will you have a bit\nof soup? It’s still hot.”\n\n“Thank you, mistress,” he muttered, crouching at the fire. She brought him a\nbowl of broth. He drank from it eagerly yet warily, as if long unaccustomed to\nhot soup.\n\n“You came over the mountain?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Whatever for?”\n\n“To come here,” he said. He was beginning to tremble less. His bare feet were\na sad sight, bruised, swollen, sodden. She wanted to tell him to put them\nright to the fire’s warmth, but didn’t like to presume. Whatever he was, he\nwasn’t a beggar by choice.\n\n“Not many come here to the High Marsh,” she said. “Peddlers and such. But not\nin winter.”\n\nHe finished his soup, and she took the bowl. She sat down in her place, the\nstool by the oil lamp to the right of the hearth, and took up her mending.\n“Get warm through, and then I’ll show you your bed,” she said. “There’s no\nfire in that room. Did you meet weather, up on the mountain? They say there’s\nbeen snow.”\n\n“Some flurries,” he said. She got a good look at him now in the light of lamp\nand fire. He was not a young man, thin, not as tall as she had thought. It was\na fine face, but there was something wrong, something amiss. He looks ruined,\nshe thought, a ruined man.\n\n“Why would you come to the Marsh?” she asked. She had a right to ask, having\ntaken him in, yet she felt a discomfort in pressing the question.\n\n“I was told there’s a murrain among the cattle here.” Now that he wasn’t all\nlocked up with cold his voice was beautiful. He talked like the tale-tellers\nwhen they spoke the parts of the heroes and the dragonlords. Maybe he was a\nteller or a singer? But no; the murrain, he had said.\n\n“There is.”\n\n“I may be able to help the beasts.”\n\n“You’re a curer?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Then you’ll be more than welcome. The plague is terrible among the cattle.\nAnd getting worse.”\n\nHe said nothing. She could see the warmth coming into him, untying him.\n\n“Put your feet up to the fire,” she said abruptly. “I have some old shoes of\nmy husbands.” It cost her something to say that, yet when she had said it she\nfelt released, untied too. What was she keeping Bren’s shoes for, anyhow? They\nwere too small for Berry and too big for her. She’d given away his clothes,\nbut kept the shoes, she didn’t know what for. For this fellow, it would seem.\nThings came round if you could wait for them, she thought. “I’ll set em out\nfor you,” she said. “Yours are perished.”\n\nHe glanced at her. His dark eyes were large, deep, opaque like a horse’s eyes,\nunreadable.\n\n“He’s dead,” she said, “two years. The marsh fever. You have to watch out for\nthat, here. The water. I live with my brother. He’s in the village, at the\ntavern. We keep a dairy. I make cheese. Our herd’s been all right,” and she\nmade the sign to avert evil. “I keep em close in. Out on the ranges, the\nmurrain’s very bad. Maybe the cold weather’ll put an end to it.”\n\n“More likely to kill the beasts that sicken with it,” the man said. He sounded\na bit sleepy.\n\n“I’m called Gift,” she said. “My brother’s Berry.”\n\n“Gully,” he named himself after a pause, and she thought it was a name he had\nmade up to call himself. It did not fit him. Nothing about him fit together,\nmade a whole. Yet she felt no distrust of him. She was easy with him. He meant\nno harm to her. She thought there was kindness in him, the way he spoke of the\nanimals. He would have a way with them, she thought. He was like an animal\nhimself, a silent, damaged creature that needed protection but couldn’t ask\nfor it.\n\n“Come” she said, “before you fall asleep there,” and he followed her\nobediently to Berry’s room, which wasn’t much more than a cupboard built onto\nthe corner of the house. Her room was behind the chimney. Berry would come in,\ndrunk, in a while, and she’d put down the pallet in the chimney corner for\nhim. Let the traveler have a good bed for a night. Maybe he’d leave a copper\nor two with her when he went on. There was a terrible shortage of coppers in\nher household these days.\n\nHe woke, as he always did, in his room in the Great House. He did not\nunderstand why the ceiling was low and the air smelt fresh but sour and cattle\nwere bawling outside. He had to lie still and come back to this other place\nand this other man, whose use-name he couldn’t remember, though he had said it\nlast night to a heifer or a woman. He knew his true name but it was no good\nhere, wherever here was, or anywhere. There had been black roads and dropping\nslopes and a vast green land lying down before him cut with rivers, shining\nwith waters. A cold wind blowing. The reeds had whistled, and the young cow\nhad led him through the stream, and Emer had opened the door. He had known her\nname as soon as he saw her. But he must use some other name. He must not call\nher by her name. He must remember what name he had told her to call him. He\nmust not be Irioth, though he was Irioth. Maybe in time he would be another\nman. No; that was wrong; he must be this man. This man’s legs ached and his\nfeet hurt. But it was a good bed, a feather bed, warm, and he need not get out\nof it yet. He drowsed a while, drifting away from Irioth.\n\nWhen he got up at last, he wondered how old he was, and looked at his hands\nand arms to see if he was seventy. He still looked forty, though he felt\nseventy and moved like it, wincing. He got his clothes on, foul as they were\nfrom days and days of travel. There was a pair of shoes under the chair, worn\nbut good, strong shoes, and a pair of knit wool stockings to go with them. He\nput the stockings on his battered feet and limped into the kitchen. Emer stood\nat the big sink, straining something heavy in a cloth.\n\n“Thank you for these and the shoes,” he said, and thanking her for the gift,\nremembered her use-name but said only, “mistress.”\n\n“You’re welcome,” she said, and hoisted whatever it was into a massive pottery\nbowl, and wiped her hands down her apron. He knew nothing at all about women.\nHe had not lived where women were since he was ten years old. He had been\nafraid of them, the women that shouted at him to get out of the way in that\ngreat other kitchen long ago. But since he had been traveling about in\nEarthsea he had met women and found them easy to be with, like the animals;\nthey went about their business not paying much attention to him unless he\nfrightened them. He tried not to do that. He had no wish or reason to frighten\nthem. They were not men.\n\n“Would you like some fresh curds? It makes a good breakfast.” She was eyeing\nhim, but not for long, and not meeting his eyes. Like an animal, like a cat,\nshe was, sizing him up but not challenging. There was a cat, a big grey,\nsitting on his four paws on the hearth gazing at the coals. Irioth accepted\nthe bowl and spoon she handed him and sat down on the settle. The cat jumped\nup beside him and purred.\n\n“Look at that,” said the woman. “He’s not friendly with most folk.”\n\n“It’s the curds.”\n\n“He knows a curer, maybe.”\n\nIt was peaceful here with the woman and the cat. He had come to a good house.\n\n“It’s cold out,” she said. “Ice on the trough this morning. Will you be going\non, this day?”\n\nThere was a pause. He forgot that he had to answer in words. “I’d stay if I\nmight,” he said. “I’d stay here.”\n\nHe saw her smile, but she was also hesitant, and after a while she said,\n“Well, you’re welcome, sir, but I have to ask, can you pay a little?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” he said, confused, and got up and limped back to the bedroom for\nhis pouch. He brought her a piece of money, a little Enladian crownpiece of\ngold.\n\n“Just for the food and the fire, you know, the peat costs so much now,” she\nwas saying, and then looked at what he offered her.\n\n“Oh, sir,” she said, and he knew he had done wrong.\n\n“There’s nobody in the village could change that,” she said. She looked up\ninto his face for a moment. “The whole village together couldn’t change that!”\nshe said, and laughed. It was all right, then, though the word “change” rang\nand rang in his head.\n\n“It hasn’t been changed,” he said, but he knew that was not what she meant.\n“I’m sorry,” he said. “If I stayed a month, if I stayed the winter, would that\nuse it up? I should have a place to stay, while I work with the beasts.”\n\n“Put it away,” she said, with another laugh, and a flurried motion of her\nhands. “If you can cure the cattle, the cattlemen will pay you, and you can\npay me then. Call that surety, if you like. But put it away, sir! It makes me\ndizzy to look at it. -Berry,” she said, as a nobbly, dried-up man came in the\ndoor with a gust of cold wind, “the gentleman will stay with us while he’s\ncuring the cattle-speed the work! He’s given us surety of payment. So you’ll\nsleep in the chimney corner, and him in the room. This is my brother Berry,\nsir.”\n\nBerry ducked his head and muttered. His eyes were dull. It seemed to Irioth\nthat the man had been poisoned. When Berry went out again, the woman came\ncloser and said, resolute, in a low voice, “There’s no harm in him but the\ndrink, but there’s not much left of him but the drink. It’s eaten up most of\nhis mind, and most of what we have. So, do you see, put up your money where he\nwon’t see it, if you don’t mind, sir. He won’t come looking for it. But if he\nsaw it, he’d take it. He often doesn’t know what he’s doing, do you see.”\n\n“Yes,” Irioth said. “I understand. You are a kind woman.” She was talking\nabout him, about his not knowing what he was doing. She was forgiving him. “A\nkind sister,” he said. The words were so new to him, words he had never said\nor thought before, that he thought he had spoken them in the True Speech,\nwhich he must not speak. But she only shrugged, with a frowning smile.\n\n“Times I could shake his fool head off,” she said, and went back to her work.\n\nHe had not known how tired he was until he came to haven. He spent all that\nday drowsing before the fire with the grey cat, while Gift went in and out at\nher work, offering him food several times-poor, coarse food, but he ate it\nall, slowly, valuing it. Come evening the brother went off, and she said with\na sigh, “He’ll run up a whole new line of credit at the tavern on the strength\nof us having a lodger. Not that it’s your fault.”\n\n“Oh, yes,” Irioth said. “It was my fault.” But she forgave; and the grey cat\nwas pressed up against his thigh, dreaming. The cat’s dreams came into his\nmind, in the low fields where he spoke with the animals, the dusky places. The\ncat leapt there, and then there was milk, and the deep soft thrilling. There\nwas no fault, only the great innocence. No need for words. They would not find\nhim here. He was not here to find. There was no need to speak any name. There\nwas nobody but her, and the cat dreaming, and the fire flickering. He had come\nover the dead mountain on black roads, but here the streams ran slow among the\npastures.\n\nHe was mad, and she didn’t know what possessed her to let him stay, yet she\ncould not fear him or distrust him. What did it matter if he was mad? He was\ngentle, and might have been wise once, before what happened to him happened.\nAnd he wasn’t so mad as all that. Mad in patches, mad at moments. Nothing in\nhim was whole, not even his madness. He couldn’t remember the name he had told\nher, and told people in the village to call him Otak. He probably couldn’t\nremember her name either; he always called her mistress. But maybe that was\nhis courtesy. She called him sir, in courtesy, and because neither Gully or\nOtak seemed names well suited to him. An otak, she had heard, was a little\nanimal with sharp teeth and no voice, but there were no such creatures on the\nHigh Marsh.\n\nShe had thought maybe his talk of coming here to cure the cattle sickness was\none of the mad bits. He did not act like the curers who came by with remedies\nand spells and salves for the animals. But after he had rested a couple of\ndays, he asked her who the cattlemen of the village were, and went off, still\nwalking sore-footed, in Bren’s old shoes. It made her heart turn in her,\nseeing that.\n\nHe came back in the evening, lamer than ever, for of course San had walked him\nclear out into the Long Fields where most of his beeves were. Nobody had\nhorses but Alder, and they were for his cowboys. She gave her guest a basin of\nhot water and a clean towel for his poor feet, and then thought to ask him if\nhe might want a bath, which he did. They heated the water and filled the old\ntub, and she went into her room while he had his bath on the hearth. When she\ncame out it was all cleared away and wiped up, the towels hung before the\nfire. She’d never known a man to look after things like that, and who would\nhave expected it of a rich man? Wouldn’t he have servants, where he came from?\nBut he was no more trouble than the cat. He washed his own clothes, even his\nbedsheet, had it done and hung out one sunny day before she knew what he was\ndoing. “You needn’t do that, sir, I’ll do your things with mine,” she said.\n\n“No need,” he said in that distant way, as if he hardly knew what she was\ntalking about; but then he said, “You work very hard.”\n\n“Who doesn’t? I like the cheese making. There’s an interest to it. And I’m\nstrong. All I fear is getting old, when I can’t lift the buckets and the\nmolds.” She showed him her round, muscular arm, making a fist and smiling.\n“Pretty good for fifty years old!” she said. It was silly to boast, but she\nwas proud of her strong arms, her energy and skill.\n\n“Speed the work,” he said gravely.\n\nHe had a way with her cows that was wonderful. When he was there and she\nneeded a hand, he took Berry’s place, and as she told her friend Tawny,\nlaughing, he was cannier with the cows than Bren’s old dog had been. “He talks\nto em, and I’ll swear they consider what he says. And that heifer follows him\nabout like a puppy.” Whatever he was doing out on the ranges with the beeves,\nthe cattlemen were coming to think well of him. Of course they would grab at\nany promise of help. Half San’s herd was dead. Alder would not say how many\nhead he had lost. The bodies of cattle were everywhere. If it had not been\ncold weather the Marsh would have reeked of rotting flesh. None of the water\ncould be drunk unless you boiled it an hour, except what came from the wells,\nhers here and the one in the village, which gave the place its name.\n\nOne morning one of Alder’s cowboys turned up in the front yard riding a horse\nand leading a saddled mule. “Master Alder says Master Otak can ride her, it\nbeing a ten-twelve miles out to the East Fields,” the young man said.\n\nHer guest came out of the house. It was a bright, misty morning, the marshes\nhidden by gleaming vapors. Andanden floated above the mists, a vast broken\nshape against the northern sky.\n\nThe curer said nothing to the cowboy but went straight to the mule, or hinny,\nrather, being out of San’s big jenny by Alder’s white horse. She was a whitey\nroan, young, with a pretty face. He went and talked to her for a minute,\nsaying something in her big, delicate ear and rubbing her topknot.\n\n“He does that,” the cowboy said to Gift. “Talks at em.” He was amused,\ndisdainful. He was one of Berry’s drinking mates at the tavern, a decent\nenough young fellow, for a cowboy.\n\n“Is he curing the cattle?” she asked.\n\n“Well, he can’t lift the murrain all at once. But seems like he can cure a\nbeast if he gets to it before the staggers begin. And those not struck yet, he\nsays he can keep it off em. So the master’s sending him all about the range to\ndo what can be done. It’s too late for many.”\n\nThe curer checked the girths, eased a strap, and got up in the saddle, not\nexpertly, but the hinny made no objection. She turned her long, creamy-white\nnose and beautiful eyes to look at her rider. He smiled. Gift had never seen\nhim smile.\n\n“Shall we go?” he said to the cowboy, who set off at once with a wave to Gift\nand a snort from his little mare. The curer followed. The hinny had a smooth,\nlong-legged walk, and her whiteness shone in the morning light. Gift thought\nit was like seeing a prince ride oft, like something out of a tale, the\nmounted figures that walked through bright mist across the vague dun of the\nwinter fields, and faded into the light, and were gone.\n\nIt was hard work out in the pastures. “Who doesn’t do hard work?” Emer had\nasked, showing her round, strong arms, her hard, red hands. The cattleman\nAlder expected him to stay out in these meadows until he had touched every\nliving beast of the great herds there. Alder had sent two cowboys along. They\nmade a camp of sorts, with a groundcloth and a half tent. There was nothing to\nburn out on the marsh but small brushwood and dead reeds, and the fire was\nhardly enough to boil water and never enough to warm a man. The cowboys rode\nout and tried to round up the animals so that he could come among them in a\nherd, instead of going to them one by one as they scattered out foraging in\nthe pastures of dry, frosty grass. They could not keep the cattle bunched for\nlong, and got angry with them and with him for not moving faster. It was\nstrange to him that they had no patience with the animals, which they treated\nas things, handling them as a log rafter handles logs in a river, by mere\nforce.\n\nThey had no patience with him either, always at him to hurry up and get done\nwith the job; nor with themselves, their life. When they talked to each other\nit was always about what they were going to do in town, in Oraby, when they\ngot paid off. He heard a good deal about the whores in Oraby, Daisy and Goldie\nand the one they called the Burning Bush. He had to sit with the young men\nbecause they all needed what warmth there was to be got from the fire, but\nthey did not want him there and he did not want to be there with them. In them\nhe knew was a vague fear of him as a sorcerer, and a jealousy of him, but\nabove all contempt. He was old, other, not one of them. Fear and jealousy he\nknew and shrank from, and contempt he remembered. He was glad he was not one\nof them, that they did not want to talk to him. He was afraid of doing wrong\nto them.\n\nHe got up in the icy morning while they still slept rolled in their blankets.\nHe knew where the cattle were nearby, and went to them. The sickness was very\nfamiliar to him now. He felt it in his hands as a burning, and a queasiness if\nit was much advanced. Approaching one steer that was lying down, he found\nhimself dizzy and retching. He came no closer, but said words that might ease\nthe dying, and went on.\n\nThey let him walk among them, wild as they were and having had nothing from\nmen’s hands but castration and butchery. He had a pleasure in their trust in\nhim, a pride in it. He should not, but he did. If he wanted to touch one of\nthe great beasts he had only to stand and speak to it a little while in the\nlanguage of those who do not speak. “Ulla,” he said, naming them. “Ellu.\nEllua.” They stood, big, indifferent; sometimes one looked at him for a long\ntime. Sometimes one came to him with its easy, loose, majestic tread, and\nbreathed into his open palm. All those that came to him he could cure. He laid\nhis hands on them, on the stiff-haired, hot flanks and neck, and sent the\nhealing into his hands with the words of power spoken over and over. After a\nwhile the beast would give a shake, or toss its head a bit, or step on. And he\nwould drop his hands and stand there, drained and blank, for a while. Then\nthere would be another one, big, curious, shyly bold, muddy-coated, with the\nsickness in it like a prickling, a tingling, a hotness in his hands, a\ndizziness. “Ellu,” he would say, and walk to the beast and lay his hands upon\nit until they felt cool, as if a mountain stream ran through them.\n\nThe cowboys were discussing whether or not it was safe to eat the meat of a\nsteer dead of the murrain. The supply of food they had brought, meager to\nstart with, was about to run out. Instead of riding twenty or thirty miles to\nrestock, they wanted to cut the tongue out of a steer that had died nearby\nthat morning.\n\nHe had forced them to boil any water they used. Now he said, “If you eat that\nmeat, in a year you’ll begin to get dizzy. You’ll end with the blind staggers\nand die as they do.”\n\nThey cursed and sneered, but believed him. He had no idea if what he said was\ntrue. It had seemed true as he said it. Perhaps he wanted to spite them.\nPerhaps he wanted to get rid of them.\n\n“Ride back,” he said. “Leave me here. There’s enough food for one man for\nthree or four days more. The hinny will bring me back.”\n\nThey needed no persuasion. They rode off leaving everything behind, their\nblankets, the tent, the iron pot. “How do we get all that back to the\nvillage?” he asked the hinny. She looked after the two ponies and said what\nhinnies say. “Aaawww!” she said. She would miss the ponies.\n\n“We have to finish the work here,” he told her, and she looked at him mildly.\nAll animals were patient, but the patience of the horse kind was wonderful,\nbeing freely given. Dogs were loyal, but there was more of obedience in it.\nDogs were hierarchs, dividing the world into lords and commoners. Horses were\nall lords. They agreed to collude. He remembered walking among the great,\nplumed feet of cart horses, fearless. The comfort of their breath on his head.\nA long time ago. He went to the pretty hinny and talked to her, calling her\nhis dear, comforting her so that she would not be lonely.\n\nIt took him six more days to get through the big herds in the eastern marshes.\nThe last two days he spent riding out to scattered groups of cattle that had\nwandered up towards the feet of the mountain. Many of them were not infected\nyet, and he could protect them. The hinny carried him bareback and made the\ngoing easy. But there was nothing left for him to eat. When he rode back to\nthe village he was light-headed and weak-kneed. He took a long time getting\nhome from Alder’s stable, where he left the hinny. Emer greeted him and\nscolded him and tried to make him eat, but he explained that he could not eat\nyet. “As I stayed there in the sickness, in the sick fields, I felt sick.\nAfter a while I’ll be able to eat again,” he explained.\n\n“You’re crazy,” she said, very angry. It was a sweet anger. Why could not more\nanger be sweet?\n\n“At least have a bath!” she said.\n\nHe knew what he smelled like, and thanked her.\n\n“What’s Alder paying you for all this?” she demanded while the water was\nheating. She was still indignant, speaking more bluntly even than usual.\n\n“I don’t know,” he said.\n\nShe stopped and stared at him.\n\n“You didn’t set a price?”\n\n“Set a price?” he flashed out. Then he remembered who he was not, and spoke\nhumbly. “No. I didn’t.”\n\n“Of all the innocence,” Gift said, hissing the word. “He’ll skin you.” She\ndumped a kettleful of steaming water into the bath. “He has ivory,” she said.\n“Tell him ivory it has to be. Out there ten days starving in the cold to cure\nhis beasts! San’s got nothing but copper, but Alder can pay you in ivory. I’m\nsorry if I’m meddling in your business. Sir.” She flung out the door with two\nbuckets, going to the pump. She would not use the stream water for anything at\nall, these days. She was wise, and kind. Why had he lived so long among those\nwho were not kind?\n\n“We’ll have to see,” said Alder, the next day, “if my beasts are cured. If\nthey make it through the winter, see, we’ll know your cures all took, that\nthey’re sound, like. Not that I doubt it, but fair’s fair, right? You wouldn’t\nask me to pay you what I have in mind to pay you, would you now, if the cure\ndidn’t take and the beasts died after all. Avert the chance! But I wouldn’t\nask you to wait all that time unpaid, neither. So here’s an advance, like, on\nwhat’s to come, and all’s square between us for now, right?”\n\nThe coppers weren’t decently in a bag, even. Irioth had to hold out his hand,\nand the cattleman laid out six copper pennies in it, one by one. “Now then!\nThat’s fair and square!” he said, expansive. “And maybe you’ll be looking at\nmy yearlings over in the Long Pond pastures, in the next day or so.”\n\n“No,” Irioth said. “Sans herd was going down fast when I left. I’m needed\nthere.”\n\n“Oh, no, you’re not, Master Otak. While you were out in the east range a\nsorcerer curer came by, a fellow that’s been here before, from the south\ncoast, and so San hired him. You work for me and you’ll be paid well. Better\nthan copper, maybe, if the beasts fare well!”\n\nIrioth did not say yes, or no, or thanks, but went off unspeaking. The\ncattleman looked after him and spat. “Avert,” he said.\n\nThe trouble rose up in Irioth’s mind as it had not done since he came to the\nHigh Marsh. He struggled against it. A man of power had come to heal the\ncattle, another man of power. But a sorcerer, Alder had said. Not a wizard,\nnot a mage. Only a curer, a cattle healer. I do not need to fear him. I do not\nneed to fear his power. I do not need his power. I must see him, to be sure,\nto be certain. If he does what I do here there is no harm. We can work\ntogether. If I do what he does here. If he uses only sorcery and means no\nharm. As I do.\n\nHe walked down the straggling street of Purewells to Sans house, which was\nabout midway, opposite the tavern. San, a hardbitten man in his thirties, was\ntalking to a man on his doorstep, a stranger. When they saw Irioth they looked\nuneasy. San went into his house and the stranger followed.\n\nIrioth came up onto the doorstep. He did not go in, but spoke in the open\ndoor. “Master San, it’s about the cattle you have there between the rivers. I\ncan go to them today.” He did not know why he said this. It was not what he\nhad meant to say.\n\n“Ah,” San said, coming to the door, and hemmed a bit. “No need, Master Otak.\nThis here is Master Sunbright, come up to deal with the murrain. He’s cured\nbeasts for me before, the hoof rot and all. Being as how you have all one man\ncan do with Alder’s beeves, you see...”\n\nThe sorcerer came out from behind San. His name was Ayeth. The power in him\nwas small, tainted, corrupted by ignorance and misuse and lying. But the\njealousy in him was like a stinging fire. “I’ve been coming doing business\nhere some ten years,” he said, looking Irioth up and down. “A man walks in\nfrom somewhere north, takes my business, some people would quarrel with that.\nA quarrel of sorcerers is a bad thing. If you’re a sorcerer, a man of power,\nthat is. I am. As the good people here well know.”\n\nIrioth tried to say he did not want a quarrel. He tried to say that there was\nwork for two. He tried to say he would not take the man’s work from him. But\nall these words burned away in the acid of the man’s jealousy that would not\nhear them and burned them before they were spoken.\n\nAyeth’s stare grew more insolent as he watched Irioth stammer. He began to say\nsomething to San, but Irioth spoke.\n\n“You have-“ he said-“you have to go. Back.” As he said “Back,” his left hand\nstruck down on the air like a knife, and Ayeth fell backward against a chair,\nstaring.\n\nHe was only a little sorcerer, a cheating healer with a few sorry spells. Or\nso he seemed. What if he was cheating, hiding his power, a rival hiding his\npower? A jealous rival. He must be stopped, he must be bound, named, called.\nIrioth began to say the words that would bind him, and the shaken man cowered\naway, shrinking down, shriveling, crying out in a thin, high wail. It is\nwrong, wrong, I am doing the wrong, I am the ill, Irioth thought. He stopped\nthe spell words in his mouth, fighting against them, and at last crying out\none other word. Then the man Ayeth crouched there, vomiting and shuddering,\nand San was staring and trying to say, “Avert! Avert!” And no harm was done.\nBut the fire burned in Irioth’s hands, burned his eyes when he tried to hide\nhis eyes in his hands, burned his tongue away when he tried to speak.\n\nFor a long time nobody would touch him. He had fallen down in a fit in San’s\ndoorway. He lay there now like a dead man. But the curer from the south said\nhe wasn’t dead, and was as dangerous as an adder. San told how Otak had put a\ncurse on Sunbright and said some awful words that made him get smaller and\nsmaller and wail like a stick in the fire, and then all in a moment he was\nback in himself again, but sick as a dog, as who could blame him, and all the\nwhile there was this light around the other one, Otak, like a wavering fire,\nand shadows jumping, and his voice not like any human voice. A terrible thing.\n\nSunbright told them all to get rid of the fellow, but didn’t stay around to\nsee them do it. He went back down the south road as soon as he’d gulped a pint\nof beer at the tavern, telling them there was no room for two sorcerers in one\nvillage and he’d be back, maybe, when that man, or whatever he was, had gone.\n\nNobody would touch him. They stared from a distance at the heap lying in the\ndoorway of San’s house. San’s wife wept aloud up and down the street. “Bad\ncess! Bad cess!” she cried. “Oh, my babe will be born dead, I know it!”\n\nBerry went and fetched his sister, after he had heard Sunbright’s tale at the\ntavern, and San’s version of it, and several other versions already current.\nIn the best of them, Otak had towered up ten feet tall and struck Sunbright\ninto a lump of coal with lightning, before foaming at the mouth, turning blue,\nand collapsing in a heap.\n\nGift hurried to the village. She went straight up to the doorstep, bent over\nthe heap, and laid her hand on it. Everybody gasped and muttered, “Avert!\nAvert!” except Tawny’s youngest daughter, who mistook the signs and piped up,\n“Speed the work!”\n\nThe heap moved, and roused up slowly. They saw it was the curer, just as he\nhad been, no fires or shadows, though looking very ill. “Come on,” Gift said,\nand got him on his feet, and walked slowly up the street with him.\n\nThe villagers shook their heads. Gift was a brave woman, but there was such a\nthing as being too brave. Or brave, they said around the tavern table, in the\nwrong way, or the wrong place, d’you see. Nobody should ought to meddle with\nsorcery that ain’t born to it. Nor with sorcerers. You forget that. They seem\nthe same as other folk. But they ain’t like other folk. Seems there’s no harm\nin a curer. Heal the foot rot, clear a caked udder. That’s all fine. But cross\none and there you are, fire and shadows and curses and falling down in fits.\nUncanny. Always was uncanny, that one. Where’d he come from, anyhow? Answer me\nthat.\n\nShe got him onto his bed, pulled the shoes off his feet, and left him\nsleeping. Berry came in late and drunker than usual, so that he fell and\ngashed his forehead on the andiron. Bleeding and raging, he ordered Gift to\nkick the shorsher out the housh, right away, kick ‘im out. Then he vomited\ninto the ashes and fell asleep on the hearth. She hauled him onto his pallet,\npulled his shoes off his feet, and left him sleeping. She went to look at the\nother one. He looked feverish, and she put her hand on his forehead. He opened\nhis eyes, looking straight into hers without expression. “Emer,” he said, and\nclosed his eyes again.\n\nShe backed away from him, terrified.\n\nIn her bed, in the dark, she lay and thought: He knew the wizard who named me.\nOr I said my name. Maybe I said it out loud in my sleep. Or somebody told him.\nBut nobody knows it. Nobody ever knew my name but the wizard, and my mother.\nAnd they’re dead, they’re dead... I said it in my sleep...\n\nBut she knew better.\n\nShe stood with the little oil lamp in her hand, and the light of it shone red\nbetween her fingers and golden on her face. He said her name. She gave him\nsleep.\n\nHe slept till late in the morning and woke as if from illness, weak and\nplacid. She was unable to be afraid of him. She found that he had no memory at\nall of what had happened in the village, of the other sorcerer, even of the\nsix coppers she had found scattered on the bedcover, which he must have held\nclenched in his hand all along.\n\n“No doubt that’s what Alder gave you,” she said. “The flint!”\n\n“I said I’d see to his beasts at... at the pasture between the rivers, was\nit?” he said, getting anxious, the hunted look coming back into him, and he\ngot up from the settle.\n\n“Sit down,” she said. He sat down, but he sat fretting.\n\n“How can you cure when you’re sick?” she said.\n\n“How else?” he said.\n\nBut he quieted down again presently, stroking the grey cat.\n\nHer brother came in. “Come on out,” he said to her as soon as he saw the curer\ndozing on the settle. She stepped outside with him.\n\n“Now I won’t have him here no more,” Berry said, coming master of the house\nover her, with the great black gash in his forehead, and his eyes like\noysters, and his hands juddering.\n\n“Where’ll you go?” she said.\n\n“It’s him has to go.”\n\n“It’s my house. Bren’s house. He stays. Go or stay, it’s up to you.”\n\n“It’s up to me too if he stays or goes, and he goes. You haven’t got all the\nsayso. All the people say he ought to go. He’s not canny.”\n\n“Oh, yes, since he’s cured half the herds and got paid six coppers for it,\ntime for him to go, right enough! I’ll have him here as long as I choose, and\nthat’s the end of it.”\n\n“They won’t buy our milk and cheese,” Berry whined.\n\n“Who says that?”\n\n“Sans wife. All the women.”\n\n“Then I’ll carry the cheeses to Oraby,” she said, “and sell em there. In the\nname of honor, brother, go wash out that cut, and change your shirt. You stink\nof the pothouse.” And she went back into the house. “Oh, dear,” she said, and\nburst into tears.\n\n“What’s the matter, Emer?” said the curer, turning his thin face and strange\neyes to her.\n\n“Oh, it’s no good, I know it’s no good. Nothing’s any good with a drunkard,”\nshe said. She wiped her eyes with her apron. “Was that what broke you,” she\nsaid, “the drink?”\n\n“No,” he said, taking no offense, perhaps not understanding, “Of course it\nwasn’t. I beg your pardon,” she said.\n\n“Maybe he drinks to try to be another man,” he said. “To alter, to change...”\n\n“He drinks because he drinks,” she said. “With some, that’s all it is. I’ll be\nin the dairy, now. I’ll lock the house door. There’s... there’s been strangers\nabout. You rest yourself. It’s bitter out.” She wanted to be sure that he\nstayed indoors out of harm’s way, and that nobody came harassing him. Later on\nshe would go into the village, have a word with some of the sensible people,\nand put a stop to this rubbishy talk, if she could.\n\nWhen she did so, Alder’s wife Tawny and several other people agreed with her\nthat a squabble between sorcerers over work was nothing new and nothing to\ntake on about. But San and his wife and the tavern crew wouldn’t let it rest,\nit being the only thing of interest to talk about for the rest of the winter,\nexcept the cattle dying. “Besides,” Tawny said, “my man’s never averse to\npaying copper where he thought he might have to pay ivory.” “Are the cattle he\ntouched keeping afoot, then?” “So far as we can see, they are. And no new\nsickenings.” “He’s a true sorcerer, Tawny,” Gift said, very earnest. “I know\nit.” “That’s the trouble, love,” said Tawny. “And you know it! This is no\nplace for a man like that. Whoever he is, is none of our business, but why did\nhe come here, is what you have to ask.” “To cure the beasts,” Gift said.\n\nSunbright had not been gone three days when a new stranger appeared in town: a\nman riding up the south road on a good horse and asking at the tavern for\nlodging. They sent him to Sans house, but San’s wife screeched when she heard\nthere was a stranger at the door, crying that if San let another witch-man in\nthe door her baby would be born dead twice over. Her screaming could be heard\nfor several houses up and down the street, and a crowd, that is, ten or eleven\npeople, gathered between Sans house and the tavern.\n\n“Well, that won’t do,” said the stranger pleasantly. “I can’t be bringing on a\nbirth untimely. Is there maybe a room above the tavern?”\n\n“Send him on out to the dairy,” said one of Alder’s cowboys. “Gift’s taking\nwhatever comes.” There was some sniggering and shushing.\n\n“Back that way,” said the taverner.\n\n“Thanks,” said the traveler, and led his horse along the way they pointed.\n\n“All the foreigners in one basket,” said the taverner, and this was repeated\nthat night at the tavern several dozen times, an inexhaustible source of\nadmiration, the best thing anybody’d said since the murrain.\n\nGift was in the dairy, having finished the evening milking. She was straining\nthe milk and setting out the pans. “Mistress,” said a voice at the door, and\nshe thought it was the curer and said, “Just a minute while I finish this,”\nand then turning saw a stranger and nearly dropped the pan. “Oh, you startled\nme!” she said. “What can I do for you, then?”\n\n“I’m looking for a bed for the night.”\n\n“No, I’m sorry, there’s my lodger, and my brother, and me. Maybe San, in the\nvillage-“\n\n“They sent me here. They said, “All the foreigners in one basket.”” The\nstranger was in his thirties, with a blunt face and a pleasant look, dressed\nplain, though the cob that stood behind him was a good horse. “Put me up in\nthe cow barn, mistress, it’ll do fine. It’s my horse needs a good bed; he’s\ntired. I’ll sleep in the barn and be off in the morning. Cows are a pleasure\nto sleep with on a cold night. I’ll be glad to pay you, mistress, if two\ncoppers would suit, and my name’s Hawk.”\n\n“I’m Gift,” she said, a bit flustered, but liking the fellow. “All right,\nthen, Master Hawk. Put your horse up and see to him. There’s the pump, there’s\nplenty of hay. Come on in the house after. I can give you a bit of milk soup,\nand a penny will be more than enough, thank you.” She didn’t feel like calling\nhim sir, as she always did the curer. This one had nothing of that lordly way\nabout him. She hadn’t seen a king when she first saw him, as with the other\none.\n\nWhen she finished in the dairy and went to the house, the new fellow, Hawk,\nwas squatting on the hearth, skillfully making up the fire. The curer was in\nhis room asleep. She looked in, and closed the door.\n\n“He’s not too well,” she said, speaking low. “He was curing the cattle away\nout east over the marsh, in the cold, for days on end, and wore himself out.”\n\nAs she went about her work in the kitchen, Hawk lent her a hand now and then\nin the most natural way, so that she began to wonder if men from foreign parts\nwere all so much handier about the house than the men of the Marsh. He was\neasy to talk with, and she told him about the curer, since there was nothing\nmuch to say about herself.\n\n“They’ll use a sorcerer and then ill-mouth him for his usefulness,” she said.\n“It’s not just.”\n\n“But he scared em, somehow, did he?”\n\n“I guess he did. Another curer came up this way, a fellow that’s been by here\nbefore. Doesn’t amount to much that I can see. He did no good to my cow with\nthe caked bag, two years ago. And his balm’s just pig fat, I’d swear. Well,\nso, he says to Otak, you’re taking my business. And maybe Otak says the same\nback. And they lose their tempers, and they did some black spells, maybe. I\nguess Otak did. But he did no harm to the man at all, but fell down in a swoon\nhimself. And now he doesn’t remember any more about it, while the other man\nwalked away unhurt. And they say every beast he touched is standing yet, and\nhale. Ten days he spent out there in the wind and the rain, touching the\nbeasts and healing them. And you know what the cattleman gave him? Six\npennies! Can you wonder he was a little rageous? But I don’t say...” She\nchecked herself and then went on, “I don’t say he’s not a bit strange,\nsometimes. The way witches and sorcerers are, I guess. Maybe they have to be,\ndealing with such powers and evils as they do. But he is a true man, and\nkind.”\n\n“Mistress,” said Hawk, “may I tell you a story?”\n\n“Oh, are you a teller? Oh, why didn’t you say so to begin with! Is that what\nyou are then? I wondered, it being winter and all, and you being on the roads.\nBut with that horse, I thought you must be a merchant. Can you tell me a\nstory? It would be the joy of my life, and the longer the better! But drink\nyour soup first, and let me sit down to hear...”\n\n“I’m not truly a teller, mistress,” he said with his pleasant smile, “but I do\nhave a story for you.” And when he had drunk his soup, and she was settled\nwith her mending, he told it.\n\n“In the Inmost Sea, on the Isle of the Wise, on Roke Island, where all magery\nis taught, there are nine Masters,” he began.\n\nShe closed her eyes in bliss and listened.\n\nHe named the Masters, Hand and Herbal, Summoner and Patterner, Windkey and\nChanter, and the Namer, and the Changer. “The Changers and the Summoner’s are\nvery perilous arts,” he said. “Changing, or transformation, you maybe know of,\nmistress. Even a common sorcerer may know how to work illusion changes,\nturning one thing into another thing for a little while, or taking on a\nsemblance not his own. Have you seen that?”\n\n“Heard of it,” she whispered.\n\n“And sometimes witches and sorcerers will say that they’ve summoned the dead\nto speak through them. Maybe a child the parents are grieving for. In the\nwitch’s hut, in the darkness, they hear it cry, or laugh...”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Those are spells of illusion only, of seeming. But there are true changes,\nand true summonings. And these may be true temptations to the wizard! It’s a\nwonderful thing to fly on the wings of a falcon, mistress, and to see the\nearth below you with a falcon’s eye. And summoning, which is naming truly, is\na great power. To know the true name is to have power, as you know, mistress.\nAnd the summoner’s art goes straight to that. It’s a wonderful thing to summon\nup the semblance and the spirit of one long dead. To see the beauty of\nElfarran in the orchards of Solea, as Morred saw it when the world was\nyoung...”\n\nHis voice had become very soft, very dark.\n\n“Well, to my story. Forty years and more ago, there was a child born on the\nIsle of Ark, a rich isle of the Inmost Sea, away south and east from Semel.\nThis child was the son of an under-steward in the household of the Lord of\nArk. Not a poor man’s son, but not a child of much account. And the parents\ndied young. So not much heed was paid to him, until they had to take notice of\nhim because of what he did and could do. He was an uncanny brat, as they say.\nHe had powers. He could light a fire or douse it with a word. He could make\npots and pans fly through the air. He could turn a mouse into a pigeon and set\nit flying round the great kitchens of the Lord of Ark. And if he was crossed,\nor frightened, then he did harm. He turned a kettle of boiling water over a\ncook who had mistreated him.”\n\n“Mercy,” whispered Gift. She had not sewn a stitch since he began.\n\n“He was only a child, and the wizards of that household can’t have been wise\nmen, for they used little wisdom or gentleness with him. Maybe they were\nafraid of him. They bound his hands and gagged his mouth to keep him from\nmaking spells. They locked him in a cellar room, a room of stone, until they\nthought him tamed. Then they sent him away to live at the stables of the great\nfarm, for he had a hand with animals, and was quieter when he was with the\nhorses. But he quarreled with a stable boy, and turned the poor lad into a\nlump of dung. When the wizards had got the stable boy back into his own shape,\nthey tied up the child again, and gagged his mouth, and put him on a ship for\nRoke. They thought maybe the Masters there could tame him.”\n\n“Poor child,” she murmured.\n\n“Indeed, for the sailors feared him too, and kept him bound that way all the\nvoyage. When the Doorkeeper of the Great House of Roke saw him, he loosed his\nhands and freed his tongue. And the first thing the boy did in the Great\nHouse, they say, he turned the Long Table of the dining hall upside down, and\nsoured the beer, and a student who tried to stop him got turned into a pig for\na bit... But the boy had met his match in the Masters.\n\n“They didn’t punish him, but kept his wild powers bound with spells until they\ncould make him listen and begin to learn. It took them a long time. There was\na rivalrous spirit in him that made him look on any power he did not have, any\nthing he did not know, as a threat, a challenge, a thing to fight against\nuntil he could defeat it. There are many boys like that. I was one. But I was\nlucky. I learned my lesson young.\n\n“Well, this boy did learn at last to tame his anger and control his power. And\na very great power it was. Whatever art he studied came easy to him, too easy,\nso that he despised illusion, and weatherworking, and even healing, because\nthey held no fear, no challenge to him. He saw no virtue in himself for his\nmastery of them. So, after the Archmage Nemmerle had given him his name, the\nboy set his will on the great and dangerous art of summoning. And he studied\nwith the Master of that art for a long time.\n\n“He lived always on Roke, for it’s there that all knowledge of magic comes and\nis kept. And he had no desire to travel and meet other kinds of people, or to\nsee the world, saying he could summon all the world to come to him-which was\ntrue. Maybe that’s where the danger of that art lies.\n\n“Now, what is forbidden to the summoner, or any wizard, is to call a living\nspirit. We can call to them, yes. We can send to them a voice or a\npresentment, a seeming, of ourself. But we do not summon them, in spirit or in\nflesh, to come to us. Only the dead may we summon. Only the shadows. You can\nsee why this must be. To summon a living man is to have entire power over him,\nbody and mind. No one, no matter how strong or wise or great, can rightly own\nand use another.\n\n“But the spirit of rivalry worked in the boy as he grew to be a man. It’s a\nstrong spirit on Roke: always to do better than the others, always to be\nfirst... The art becomes a contest, a game. The end becomes a means to an end\nless than itself... There was no man there more greatly gifted than this man,\nyet if any did better than he in any thing, he found it hard to bear. It\nfrightened him, it galled him.\n\n“There was no place for him among the Masters, since a new Master Summoner had\nbeen chosen, a strong man in his prime, not likely to retire or die. Among the\nscholars and other teachers he had a place of honor, but he wasn’t one of the\nNine. He’d been passed over. Maybe it wasn’t a good thing for him to stay\nthere, always among wizards and mages, among boys learning wizardry, all of\nthem craving power and more power, striving to be strongest. At any rate, as\nthe years went on he became more and more aloof, pursuing his studies in his\ntower cell apart from others, teaching few students, speaking little. The\nSummoner would send gifted students to him, but many of the boys there\nscarcely knew of him. In this isolation he began to practice certain arts that\nare not well to practice and lead to no good thing.\n\n“A summoner grows used to bidding spirits and shadows to come at his will and\ngo at his word. Maybe this man began to think, Who’s to forbid me to do the\nsame with the living? Why have I the power if I cannot use it? So he began to\ncall the living to him, those at Roke whom he feared, thinking them rivals,\nthose whose power he was jealous of. When they came to him he took their power\nfrom them for himself, leaving them silent. They couldn’t say what had\nhappened to them, what had become of their power. They didn’t know.\n\n“So at last he summoned his own master, the Summoner of Roke, taking him\nunawares.\n\n“But the Summoner fought him both in body and spirit, and called to me, and I\ncame. Together we fought against the will that would destroy us.”\n\nNight had come. Gift’s lamp had flickered out. Only the red glow of the fire\nshone on Hawk’s face. It was not the face she had thought it. It was worn, and\nhard, and scarred all down one side. The hawk’s face, she thought. She held\nstill, listening.\n\n“This is not a teller’s tale, mistress. This is not a story you will ever hear\nanyone else tell.\n\n“I was new at the business of being Archmage then. And younger than the man we\nfought, and maybe not afraid enough of him. It was all the two of us could do\nto hold our own against him, there in the silence, in the cell in the tower.\nNobody else knew what was going on. We fought. A long time we fought. And then\nit was over. He broke. Like a stick breaking. He was broken. But he fled away.\nThe Summoner had spent a part of his strength for good, overcoming that blind\nwill. And I didn’t have the strength in me to stop the man when he fled, nor\nthe wits to send anyone after him. And not a shred of power left in me to\nfollow him with. So he got away from Roke. Clean gone.\n\n“We couldn’t hide the wrestle we’d had with him, though we said as little\nabout it as we could. And many there said good riddance, for he’d always been\nhalf mad, and now was mad entirely.\n\n“But after the Summoner and I got over the bruises on our souls, as you might\nsay, and the great stupidity of mind that follows such a struggle, we began to\nthink that it wasn’t a good thing to have a man of very great power, a mage,\nwandering about Earthsea not in his right mind, and maybe full of shame and\nrage and vengefulness.\n\n“We could find no trace of him. No doubt he changed himself to a bird or a\nfish when he left Roke, until he came to some other island. And a wizard can\nhide himself from all finding spells. We sent out inquiries, in the ways we\nhave of doing so, but nothing and nobody replied. So we set off looking for\nhim, the Summoner to the eastern isles and I to the west. For when I thought\nabout this man, I had begun to see in my mind’s eye a great mountain, a broken\ncone, with a long, green land beneath it reaching to the south. I remembered\nmy geography lessons when I was a boy at Roke, and the lay of the land on\nSemel, and the mountain whose name is Andanden. So I came to the High Marsh. I\nthink I came the right way.”\n\nThere was a silence. The fire whispered.\n\n“Should I speak to him?” Gift asked in a steady voice.\n\n“No need,” said the man like a falcon. “I will.” And he said, “Irioth.”\n\nShe looked at the door of the bedroom. It opened and he stood there, thin and\ntired, his dark eyes full of sleep and bewilderment and pain.\n\n“Ged,” he said. He bowed his head. After a while he looked up and asked, “Will\nyou take my name from me?”\n\n“Why should I do that?”\n\n“It means only hurt. Hate, pride, greed.”\n\n“I’ll take those names from you, Irioth, but not your own.”\n\n“I didn’t understand,” Irioth said, “about the others. That they are other. We\nare all other. We must be. I was wrong.”\n\nThe man named Ged went to him and took his hands, which were half stretched\nout, pleading.\n\n“You went wrong. You’ve come back. But you’re tired, Irioth, and the way’s\nhard when you go alone. Come home with me.”\n\nIrioth’s head drooped as if in utter weariness. All tension and passion had\ngone out of his body. But he looked up, not at Ged but at Gift, silent in the\nhearth corner.\n\n“I have work here,” he said.\n\nGed too looked at her.\n\n“He does,” she said. “He heals the cattle.”\n\n“They show me what I should do,” Irioth said, “and who I am. They know my\nname. But they never say it.”\n\nAfter a while Ged gently drew the older man to him and held him in his arms.\nHe said something quietly to him and let him go. Irioth drew a deep breath.\n\n“I’m no good there, you see, Ged,” he said. “I am, here. If they’ll let me do\nthe work.” He looked again at Gift, and Ged did also. She looked at them both.\n\n“What say you, Emer?” asked the one like a falcon.\n\n“I’d say,” she said, her voice thin and reedy, speaking to the curer, “that if\nAlder’s beeves stay afoot through the winter, the cattlemen will be begging\nyou to stay. Though they may not love you.”\n\n“Nobody loves a sorcerer,” said the Archmage. “Well, Irioth! Did I come all\nthis way for you in the dead of winter, and must go back alone?”\n\n“Tell them-tell them I was wrong,” Irioth said. “Tell them I did wrong. Tell\nThorion-“ He halted, confused.\n\n“I’ll tell him that the changes in a man’s life may be beyond all the arts we\nknow, and all our wisdom,” said the Archmage. He looked at Emer again. “May he\nstay here, mistress? Is that your wish as well as his?”\n\n“He’s ten times the use and company to me my brother is,” she said. “And a\nkind true man, as I told you. Sir.”\n\n“Very well, then. Irioth, my dear companion, teacher, rival, friend, farewell.\nEmer, brave woman, my honor and thanks to you. May your heart and hearth know\npeace,” and he made a gesture that left a glimmering track behind it a moment\nin the air above the hearth stone. “Now I’m off to the cow barn,” he said, and\nhe was.\n\nThe door closed. It was silent except for the whisper of the fire.\n\n“Come to the fire,” she said. Irioth came and sat down on the settle.\n\n“Was that the Archmage? Truly?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“The Archmage of the world,” she said. “In my cow barn. He should have my\nbed-“\n\n“He won’t,” said Irioth.\n\nShe knew he was right.\n\n“Your name is beautiful, Irioth,” she said after a while. “I never knew my\nhusband’s true name. Nor he mine. I won’t speak yours again. But I like to\nknow it, since you know mine.”\n\n“Your name is beautiful, Emer,” he said. “I will speak it when you tell me\nto.”\n\n\nDragonfly\n\nI. Iria\n\n  \n\nHer father’s ancestors had owned a wide, rich domain on the wide, rich island\nof Way. Claiming no title or court privilege in the days of the kings, through\nall the dark years after Maharion fell they held their land and people with\nfirm hands, putting their gains back into the land, upholding some sort of\njustice, and fighting off petty tyrants. As order and peace returned to the\nArchipelago under the sway of the wise men of Roke, for a while yet the family\nand their farms and villages prospered. That prosperity and the beauty of the\nmeadows and upland pastures and oak-crowned hills made the domain a byword, so\nthat people said, “as fat as a cow of Iria’, or, “as lucky as an Irian’. The\nmasters and many tenants of the domain added its name to their own, calling\nthemselves Irian. But though the farmers and shepherds went on from season to\nseason and year to year and generation to generation as solid and steady as\nthe oaks, the family that owned the land altered with time and chance.\n\nA quarrel between brothers over their inheritance divided them. One heir\nmismanaged his estate through greed, the other through foolishness. One had a\ndaughter who married a merchant and tried to run her estate from the city, the\nother had a son whose sons quarrelled again, redividing the divided land. By\nthe time the girl called Dragonfly was born, the domain of Iria, though still\none of the loveliest regions of hill and field and meadow in all Earthsea, was\na battleground of feuds and litigations. Farmlands went to weeds, farmsteads\nwent unroofed, milking sheds stood unused, and shepherds followed their flocks\nover the mountain to better pastures. The old house that had been the centre\nof the domain was half in ruins on its hill among the oaks.\n\nIts owner was one of four men who called themselves Master of Iria. The other\nthree called him Master of Old Iria. He spent his youth and what remained of\nhis inheritance in law courts and the anterooms of the Lords of Way in\nShelieth, trying to prove his right to the whole domain as it had been a\nhundred years ago. He came back unsuccessful and embittered and spent his age\ndrinking the hard red wine from his last vineyard and walking his boundaries\nwith a troop of ill-treated, underfed dogs to keep interlopers off his land.\n\nHe had married while he was in Shelieth, a woman no one at Iria knew anything\nabout, for she came from some other island, it was said, somewhere in the\nwest, and she never came to Iria, for she died in childbirth there in the\ncity.\n\nWhen he came home he had a three-year-old daughter with him. He turned her\nover to the housekeeper and forgot about her. When he was drunk sometimes he\nremembered her. If he could find her, he made her stand by his chair or sit on\nhis knees and listen to all the wrongs that had been done to him and to the\nhouse of Iria. He cursed and cried and drank and made her drink, too, pledging\nto honour her inheritance and be true to Iria. She drank the wine, but she\nhated the curses and pledges and tears and the slobbered caresses that\nfollowed them. She escaped, if she could, and went down to the dogs and the\nhorses and the cattle, and swore to them that she would be loyal to her\nmother, whom nobody knew or honoured or was true to, except herself.\n\nWhen she was thirteen the old vineyarder and the housekeeper, who were all\nthat was left of the household, told the Master that it was time his daughter\nhad her naming day. They asked should they send for the sorcerer over at\nWestpool, or would their own village witch do. The Master of Iria fell into a\nscreaming rage. “A village witch? A hex-hag to give Irian’s daughter her true\nname? Or a creeping traitorous sorcerous servant of those upstart landgrabbers\nwho stole Westpool from my grandfather? If that polecat sets foot on my land\nI’ll have the dogs tear out his liver, go tell him that, if you like!” And so\non. Old Daisy went back to her kitchen and old Coney went back to his vines,\nand thirteen-year-old Dragonfly ran out of the house and down the hill to the\nvillage, hurling her father’s curses at the dogs, who, crazy with excitement\nat his shouting, barked and bayed and rushed after her.\n\n“Get back, you black-hearted bitch!” she yelled. “Home, you crawling traitor!”\nAnd the dogs fell silent and went sidling back to the house with their tails\ndown.\n\nDragonfly found the village witch taking maggots out of an infected cut on a\nsheep’s rump. The witch’s use-name was Rose, like a great many women of Way\nand other islands of the Hardic Archipelago. People who have a secret name\nthat holds their power the way a diamond holds light may well like their\npublic name to be ordinary, common, like other people’s names.\n\nRose was muttering a rote spell, but it was her hands and her little short\nsharp knife that did most of the work. The ewe bore the digging knife\npatiently, her opaque, amber, slotted eyes gazing into silence; only she\nstamped her small left front foot now and then, and sighed.\n\nDragonfly peered close at Rose’s work. Rose brought out a maggot, dropped it,\nspat on it, and probed again. The girl leaned up against the ewe, and the ewe\nleaned against the girl, giving and receiving comfort. Rose extracted,\ndropped, and spat on the last maggot, and said, “Just hand me that bucket\nnow.” She bathed the sore with salt water. The ewe sighed deeply and suddenly\nwalked out of the yard, heading for home. She had had enough of medicine.\n“Bucky!” Rose shouted. A grubby child appeared from under a bush where he had\nbeen asleep and trailed after the ewe, of whom he was nominally in charge\nalthough she was older, larger, better fed, and probably wiser than he was.\n\n“They said you should give me my name,” said Dragonfly. “Father fell to\nraging. So that’s that.”\n\nThe witch said nothing. She knew the girl was right. Once the Master of Iria\nsaid he would or would not allow a thing he never changed his mind, priding\nhimself on his intransigence, since only weak men said a thing and then unsaid\nit.\n\n“Why can’t I give myself my own true name?” Dragonfly asked, while Rose washed\nthe knife and her hands in the salt water.\n\n“Can’t be done,”\n\n“Why not? Why does it have to be a witch or a sorcerer? What do you do?”\n\n“Well,” Rose said, and dumped out the salt water on the bare dirt of the small\nfront yard of her house, which, like most witches’ houses, stood somewhat\napart from the village. “Well,” she said, straightening up and looking about\nvaguely as if for an answer, or a ewe, or a towel. “You have to know something\nabout the power, see,” she said at last, and looked at Dragonfly with one eye.\nHer other eye looked a little off to the side. Sometimes Dragonfly thought the\ncast was in Rose’s left eye, sometimes it seemed to be in her right, but\nalways one eye looked straight and the other watched something just out of\nsight, around the corner, elsewhere.\n\n“Which power?”\n\n“The one,” Rose said. As suddenly as the ewe had walked off, she went into her\nhouse. Dragonfly followed her, but only to the door. Nobody entered a witch’s\nhouse uninvited.\n\n“You said I had it,” the girl said into the reeking gloom of the one-roomed\nhut.\n\n“I said you have a strength in you, a great one,” the witch said from the\ndarkness. “And you know it too. What you are to do I don’t know, nor do you.\nThat’s to find. But there’s no such power as to name yourself.”\n\n“Why not? What’s more yourself than your own true name?”\n\nA long silence.\n\nThe witch emerged with a soapstone drop-spindle and a ball of greasy wool. She\nsat down on the bench beside her door and set the spindle turning. She had\nspun a yard of grey-brown yarn before she answered.\n\n“My name’s myself. True. But what’s a name, then? It’s what another calls me.\nIf there was no other, only me, what would I want a name for?”\n\n“But,” said Dragonfly and stopped, caught by the argument. After a while she\nsaid, “So a name has to be a gift?”\n\nRose nodded.\n\n“Give me my name, Rose,” the girl said.\n\n“Your dad says not.”\n\n“I say to.”\n\n“He’s the Master here.”\n\n“He can keep me poor and stupid and worthless, but he can’t keep me nameless!”\n\nThe witch sighed, like the ewe, uneasy and constrained.\n\n“Tonight,” Dragonfly said. “At our spring, under Iria Hill. What he doesn’t\nknow won’t hurt him.” Her voice was half-coaxing, half-savage.\n\n“You ought to have your proper name day, your feast and dancing, like any\nyoung ‘un,” the witch said. “It’s at daybreak a name should be given. And then\nthere ought to be music and feasting and all. Not sneaking about at night and\nno one knowing...”\n\n“I’ll know. How do you know what name to say, Rose? Does the water tell you?”\n\nThe witch shook her iron-grey head once. “I can’t tell you.” Her ‘can’t’ did\nnot mean ‘won’t’. Dragonfly waited. “It’s the power, like I said. It comes\njust so.” Rose stopped her spinning and looked up with one eye at a cloud in\nthe west; the other looked a little northward of the sky. “You’re there in the\nwater, together, you and the child. You take away the child-name. People may\ngo on using that name for a use-name, but it’s not her name, nor ever was. So\nnow she’s not a child, and she has no name. So then you wait. You open your\nmind up, like. Like opening the doors of a house to the wind. So it comes.\nYour tongue speaks it, the name. Your breath makes it. You give it to that\nchild, the breath, the name. You can’t think of it. You let it come to you. It\nmust come through you to her it belongs to. That’s the power, the way it\nworks. It’s all like that. It’s not a thing you do. You have to know how to\nlet it do. That’s all the mastery.”\n\n“Mages can do more than that,” the girl said.\n\n“Nobody can do more than that,” said Rose.\n\nDragonfly rolled her head round on her neck, stretching till the vertebrae\ncracked, stretching out her long arms and legs restlessly. “Will you?” she\nsaid.\n\nAfter some time, Rose nodded once.\n\nThey met in the lane under Iria Hill in the dark of night, long after sunset,\nlong before dawn. Rose made a dim glow of werelight so that they could find\ntheir way through the marshy ground around the spring without falling in a\nsinkhole among the reeds. In the cold darkness under a few stars and the black\ncurve of the hill, they stripped and waded into the shallow water, their feet\nsinking deep in velvet mud. The witch touched the girl’s hand, saying, “I take\nyour name, child. You are no child. You have no name.”\n\nIt was utterly still.\n\nIn a whisper the witch said, “Woman, be named. You are Irian.”\n\nFor a moment longer they held still; then the night wind blew across their\nnaked shoulders, and shivering, they waded out, dried themselves as well as\nthey could, struggled barefoot and wretched through the sharp-edged reeds and\ntangling roots, and found their way back to the lane. And there Dragonfly\nspoke in a ragged, raging whisper: ‘How could you name me that!”\n\nThe witch said nothing.\n\n“It isn’t right. It isn’t my true name! I thought my name would make me be me.\nBut this makes it worse. You got it wrong. You’re only a witch. You did it\nwrong. It’s his name. He can have it. He’s so proud of it, his stupid domain,\nhis stupid grandfather. I don’t want it. I won’t have it. It isn’t me. I still\ndon’t know who I am. I’m not Irian!” She fell silent abruptly, having spoken\nthe name.\n\nThe witch still said nothing. They walked along in the darkness side by side.\nAt last, in a placating, frightened voice, Rose said, “It came so ...”\n\n“If you ever tell it to anyone I’ll kill you,” Dragonfly said.\n\nAt that, the witch stopped walking. She hissed like a cat. “Tell anyone?”\n\nDragonfly stopped too. She said after a moment, “I’m sorry. But I feel like -\nI feel like you betrayed me.”\n\n“I spoke your true name. It’s not what I thought it would be. And I don’t feel\neasy about it. As if I’d left something unfinished. But it is your name. If it\nbetrays you, then that’s the truth of it.” Rose hesitated and then spoke less\nangrily, more coldly: ‘If you want the power to betray me, Irian, I’ll give\nyou that. My name is Etaudis.”\n\nThe wind had come up again. They were both shivering, their teeth chattering.\nThey stood face to face in the black lane, hardly able to see where the other\nwas. Dragonfly put out her groping hand and met the witch’s hand. They put\ntheir arms round each other in a fierce, long embrace. Then they hurried on,\nthe witch to her hut near the village, the heiress of Iria up the hill to her\nruinous house, where all the dogs, who had let her go without much fuss,\nreceived her back with a clamour and racket of barking that woke everybody for\na half-mile round except the Master, sodden drunk by his cold hearth.\n\nII. Ivory\n\n  \n\nThe Master of Iria of Westpool, Birch, didn’t own the old house, but he did\nown the central and richest lands of the old domain. His father, more\ninterested in vines and orchards than in quarrels with his relatives, had left\nBirch a thriving property. Birch hired men to manage the farms and wineries\nand cooperage and cartage and all, while he enjoyed his wealth. He married the\ntimid daughter of the younger brother of the Lord of Wayfirth, and took\ninfinite pleasure in thinking that his daughters were of noble blood.\n\nThe fashion of the time among the nobility was to have a wizard in their\nservice, a genuine wizard with a staff and a grey cloak, trained on the Isle\nof the Wise, and so the Master of Iria of Westpool got himself a wizard from\nRoke. He was surprised how easy it was to get one, if you paid the price.\n\nThe young man, called Ivory, did not actually have his staff and cloak yet; he\nexplained that he was to be made wizard when he went back to Roke. The Masters\nhad sent him out in the world to gain experience, for all the classes in the\nSchool cannot give a man the experience he needs to be a wizard. Birch looked\na little dubious at this, and Ivory reassured him that his training on Roke\nhad equipped him with every kind of magic that could be needed in Iria of\nWestpool on Way. To prove it, he made it seem that a herd of deer ran through\nthe dining hall, followed by a flight of swans, who marvellously soared\nthrough the south wall and out through the north wall; and lastly a fountain\nin a silver basin sprang up in the centre of the table, and when the Master\nand his family cautiously imitated their wizard and filled their cups from it\nand tasted it, it was a sweet golden wine. “Wine of the Andrades,” said the\nyoung man with a modest, complacent smile. By then the wife and daughters were\nentirely won over. And Birch thought the young man was worth his fee, although\nhis own silent preference was for the dry red Fanian of his own vineyards,\nwhich got you drunk if you drank enough, while this yellow stuff was just\nhoneywater.\n\nIf the young sorcerer was seeking experience, he did not get much at Westpool.\nWhenever Birch had guests from Kembermouth or from neighboring domains, the\nherd of deer, the swans, and the fountain of golden wine made their\nappearance. He also worked up some very pretty fireworks for warm spring\nevenings. But if the managers of the orchards and vineyards came to the Master\nto ask if his wizard might put a spell of increase on the pears this year or\nmaybe charm the black rot off the Fanian vines on the south hill, Birch said,\n“A wizard of Roke doesn’t lower himself to such stuff. Go tell the village\nsorcerer to earn his keep!” And when the youngest daughter came down with a\nwasting cough, Birch’s wife dared not trouble the wise young man about it, but\nsent humbly to Rose of Old Iria, asking her to come in by the back door and\nmaybe make a poultice or sing a chant to bring the girl back to health.\n\nIvory never noticed that the girl was ailing, nor the pear trees, nor the\nvines. He kept himself to himself, as a man of craft and learning should. He\nspent his days riding about the countryside on the pretty black mare that his\nemployer had given him for his use when he made it clear that he had not come\nfrom Roke to trudge about on foot in the mud and dust of country byways.\n\nOn his rides, he sometimes passed an old house on a hill among great oaks.\nWhen he turned off the village lane up the hill, a pack of scrawny, evil-\nmouthed dogs came pelting and bellowing down at him. The mare was afraid of\ndogs and liable to buck and bolt, so he kept his distance. But he had an eye\nfor beauty, and liked to look at the old house dreaming away in the dappled\nlight of the early summer afternoons.\n\nHe asked Birch about the place. “That’s Iria,” Birch said - “Old Iria, I mean\nto say. I own the house by rights. But after a century of feuds and fights\nover it, my granddad let the place go to settle the quarrel. Though the Master\nthere would still be quarrelling with me if he didn’t keep too drunk to talk.\nHaven’t seen the old man for years. He had a daughter, I think.”\n\n“She’s called Dragonfly, and she does all the work, and I saw her once last\nyear. She’s tall, and as beautiful as a flowering tree,” said the youngest\ndaughter, Rose, who was busy crowding a lifetime of keen observation into the\nfourteen years that were all she was going to have for it. She broke off,\ncoughing. Her mother shot an anguished, yearning glance at the wizard. Surely\nhe would hear that cough, this time? He smiled at young Rose, and the mother’s\nheart lifted. Surely he wouldn’t smile so if Rose’s cough was anything\nserious?\n\n“Nothing to do with us, that lot at the old place,” Birch said, displeased.\nThe tactful Ivory asked no more. But he wanted to see the girl as beautiful as\na flowering tree. He rode past Old Iria regularly. He tried stopping in the\nvillage at the foot of the hill to ask questions, but there was nowhere to\nstop and nobody would answer questions. A wall-eyed witch took one look at him\nand scuttled into her hut. If he went up to the house he would have to face\nthe pack of hellhounds and probably a drunk old man. But it was worth the\nchance, he thought; he was bored out of his wits with the dull life at\nWestpool, and was never slow to take a risk. He rode up the hill till the dogs\nwere yelling around him in a frenzy, snapping at the mare’s legs. She plunged\nand lashed out her hooves at them, and he kept her from bolting only by a\nstaying-spell and all the strength in his arms. The dogs were leaping and\nsnapping at his own legs now, and he was about to let the mare have her head\nwhen somebody came among the dogs shouting curses and beating them back with a\nstrap. When he got the lathered, gasping mare to stand still, he saw the girl\nas beautiful as a flowering tree. She was very tall, very sweaty, with big\nhands and feet and mouth and nose and eyes, and a head of wild dusty hair. She\nwas yelling, “Down! Back to the house, you carrion, you vile sons of bitches!”\nto the whining, cowering dogs.\n\nIvory clapped his hand to his right leg. A dog’s tooth had ripped his breeches\nat the calf, and a trickle of blood came through.\n\n“Is she hurt?” the woman said. “Oh, the traitorous vermin!” She was stroking\ndown the mare’s right foreleg. Her hands came away covered with blood-streaked\nhorse sweat. “There, there,” she said. The brave girl, the brave heart.” The\nmare put her head down and shivered all over with relief. “What did you keep\nher standing there in the middle of the dogs for?” the woman demanded\nfuriously. She was kneeling at the horse’s leg, looking up at Ivory who was\nlooking down at her from horseback; yet he felt short, he felt small.\n\nShe did not wait for an answer. “I’ll walk her up,” she said, standing up, and\nput out her hand for the reins. Ivory saw that he was supposed to dismount. He\ndid so, asking, “Is it very bad?” and peering at the horse’s leg, seeing only\nbright, bloody foam.\n\n“Come on then, my love,” the young woman said, not to him. The mare followed\nher trustfully. They set off up the rough path round the hillside to an old\nstone and brick stableyard, empty of horses, inhabited only by nesting\nswallows that swooped about over the roofs calling their quick gossip.\n\n“Keep her quiet,” said the young woman, and left him holding the mare’s reins\nin this deserted place. She returned after some time lugging a heavy bucket,\nand set to sponging off the mare’s leg. “Get the saddle off her,” she said,\nand her tone held the unspoken, impatient, “you fool!” Ivory obeyed, half-\nannoyed by this crude giantess and half-intrigued. She did not put him in mind\nof a flowering tree at all, but she was in fact beautiful, in a large, fierce\nway. The mare submitted to her absolutely. When she said, “Move your foot!”\nthe mare moved her foot. The woman wiped her down all over, put the saddle\nblanket back on her, and made sure she was standing in the sun. “She’ll be all\nright,” she said. “There’s a gash, but if you’ll wash it with warm salt water\nfour or five times a day, it’ll heal clean, I’m sorry.” She said the last\nhonestly, though grudgingly, as if she still wondered how he could have let\nhis mare stand there to be assaulted, and she looked straight at him for the\nfirst time. Her eyes were clear orange-brown, like dark topaz or amber. They\nwere strange eyes, right on a level with his own.\n\n“I’m sorry too,” he said, trying to speak carelessly, lightly.\n\n“She’s Irian of Westpool’s mare. You’re the wizard, then?”\n\nHe bowed. “Ivory, of Havnor Great Port, at your service. May I -“\n\nShe interrupted. “I thought you were from Roke.”\n\n“I am,” he said, his composure regained.\n\nShe stared at him with those strange eyes, as unreadable as a sheep’s, he\nthought. Then she burst out: ‘You lived there? You studied there? Do you know\nthe Archmage?”\n\n“Yes,” he said with a smile. Then he winced and stopped to press his hand\nagainst his shin for a moment.\n\n“Are you hurt too?”\n\n“It’s nothing,” he said. In fact, rather to his annoyance, the cut had stopped\nbleeding. The woman’s gaze returned to his face.\n\n“What is it - what is it like - on Roke?”\n\nIvory went, limping only very slightly, to an old mounting-block nearby and\nsat down on it. He stretched his leg, nursing the torn place, and looked up at\nthe woman. “It would take a long time to tell you what Roke is like,” he said.\n“But it would be my pleasure.”\n\n“The man’s a wizard, or nearly,” said Rose the witch, “a Roke wizard! You must\nnot ask him questions!” She was more than scandalized, she was frightened.\n\n“He doesn’t mind,” Dragonfly reassured her. “Only he hardly ever really\nanswers.”\n\n“Of course not!”\n\n“Why of course not?”\n\n“Because he’s a wizard! Because you’re a woman, with no art, no knowledge, no\nlearning!”\n\n“You could have taught me! You never would!”\n\nRose dismissed all she had taught or could teach with a flick of the fingers.\n\n“Well, so I have to learn from him,” said Dragonfly.\n\n“Wizards don’t teach women. You’re besotted.”\n\n“You and Broom trade spells.”\n\n“Broom’s a village sorcerer. This man is a wise man. He learned the High Arts\nat the Great House on Roke!”\n\n“He told me what it’s like,” Dragonfly said. “You walk up through the town,\nThwil Town. There’s a door opening on the street, but it’s shut. It looks like\nan ordinary door.”\n\nThe witch listened, unable to resist the lure of secrets revealed and the\ncontagion of passionate desire.\n\n“And a man comes when you knock, an ordinary-looking man. And he gives you a\ntest. You have to say a certain word, a password, before he’ll let you in. If\nyou don’t know it, you can never go in. But if he lets you in, then from\ninside you see that the door is entirely different - it’s made out of horn,\nwith a tree carved on it, and the frame is made out of a tooth, one tooth of a\ndragon that lived long, long before Erreth-Akbe, before Morred, before there\nwere people in Earthsea. There were only dragons, to begin with. They found\nthe tooth on Mount Onn, in Havnor, at the centre of the world. And the leaves\nof the tree are carved so thin that the light shines through them, but the\ndoor’s so strong that if the Doorkeeper shuts it no spell could ever open it.\nAnd then the Doorkeeper takes you down a hall and another hall, till you’re\nlost and bewildered, and then suddenly you come out under the sky. In the\nCourt of the Fountain, in the very deepest inside of the Great House. And\nthat’s where the Archmage would be, if he was there...”\n\n“Go on,” the witch murmured.\n\nThat’s all he really told me, yet,” said Dragonfly, coming back to the mild,\novercast spring day and the infinite familiarity of the village lane, Rose’s\nfront yard, her own seven milch ewes grazing on Iria Hill, the bronze crowns\nof the oaks. “He’s very careful how he talks about the Masters.”\n\nRose nodded.\n\n“But he told me about some of the students.”\n\n“No harm in that, I suppose.”\n\n“I don’t know,” Dragonfly said. “To hear about the Great House is wonderful,\nbut I thought the people there would be - I don’t know. Of course they’re\nmostly just boys when they go there. But I thought they’d be...” She gazed off\nat the sheep on the hill, her face troubled. “Some of them are really bad and\nstupid,” she said in a low voice. “They get into the School because they’re\nrich. And they study there just to get richer. Or to get power.”\n\n“Well, of course they do,” said Rose, “that’s what they’re there for!”\n\n“But power - like you told me about - that .isn’t the same as making people do\nwhat you want, or pay you -“\n\n“Isn’t it?”\n\n“No!”\n\n“If a word can heal, a word can wound,” the witch said. “If a hand can kill, a\nhand can cure. It’s a poor cart that goes only in one direction,”\n\n“But on Roke, they learn to use power well, not for harm, not for gain.”\n\n“Everything’s for gain some way, I’d say. People have to live. But what do I\nknow? I make my living doing what I know how to do. But I don’t meddle with\nthe great arts, the perilous crafts, like summoning the dead,” and Rose made\nthe hand-sign to avert the danger spoken of.\n\n“Everything’s perilous,” Dragonfly said, gazing now through the sheep, the\nhill, the trees, into still depths, a colorless, vast emptiness like the clear\nsky before sunrise.\n\nRose watched her. She knew she did not know who Man was or what she might be.\nA big, strong, awkward, ignorant, innocent, angry woman, yes. But ever since\nshe was a child Rose had seen something more in her, something beyond what she\nwas. And when Irian looked away from the world like that, she seemed to enter\nthat place or time or being beyond herself, utterly beyond Rose’s knowledge.\nThen Rose feared her, and feared for her.\n\n“You take care,” the witch said, grim. “Everything’s perilous, right enough,\nand meddling with wizards most of all.”\n\nThrough love, respect, and trust, Dragonfly would never disregard a warning\nfrom Rose; but she was unable to see Ivory as perilous. She didn’t understand\nhim, but the idea of fearing him, him personally, was not one she could keep\nin mind. She tried to be respectful, but it was impossible. She thought he was\nclever and quite handsome, but she didn’t think much about him, except for\nwhat he could tell her. He knew what she wanted to know and little by little\nhe told it to her, and then it was not really what she had wanted to know, but\nshe wanted to know more. He was patient with her, and she was grateful to him\nfor his patience, knowing he was much quicker than she. Sometimes he smiled at\nher ignorance, but he never sneered at it or reproved it. Like the witch, he\nliked to answer a question with a question; but the answers to Rose’s\nquestions were always something she’d always known, while the answers to his\nquestions were things she had never imagined and found startling, unwelcome,\neven painful, altering all her beliefs.\n\nDay by day, as they talked in the old stableyard of Iria, where they had\nfallen into the habit of meeting, she asked him and he told her more, though\nreluctantly, always partially; he shielded his Masters, she thought, trying to\ndefend the bright image of Roke, until one day he gave in to her insistence\nand spoke freely at last.\n\n“There are good men there,” he said. “Great and wise the Archmage certainly\nwas. But he’s gone. And the Masters . . . Some hold aloof, following arcane\nknowledge, seeking ever more patterns, ever more names, but using their\nknowledge for nothing. Others hide their ambition under the grey cloak of\nwisdom. Roke is no longer where power is in Earthsea. That’s the Court in\nHavnor, now. Roke lives on its great past, defended by a thousand spells\nagainst the present day. And inside those spell-walls, what is there?\nQuarrelling ambitions, fear of anything new, fear of young men who challenge\nthe power of the old. And at the centre, nothing. An empty courtyard. The\nArchmage will never return.”\n\n“How do you know?” she whispered.\n\nHe looked stern. The dragon bore him away.”\n\n“You saw it? You saw that?” She clenched her hands, imagining that flight.\n\nAfter a long time, she came back to the sunlight and the stableyard and her\nthoughts and puzzles. “But even if he’s gone,” she said, “surely some of the\nMasters are truly wise?”\n\nWhen he looked up and spoke it was with a hint of a melancholy smile. “All the\nmystery and wisdom of the Masters, when it’s out in the daylight, doesn’t\namount to so much, you know. Tricks of the trade - wonderful illusions. But\npeople don’t want to believe that. They want the mysteries, the illusions. Who\ncan blame them? There’s so little in most lives that’s beautiful or worthy.”\n\nAs if to illustrate what he was saying, he had picked up a bit of brick from\nthe broken pavement, and tossed it up in the air, and as he spoke it fluttered\nabout their heads on delicate blue wings, a butterfly. He put out his finger\nand the butterfly lighted on it. He shook his finger and the butterfly fell to\nthe ground, a fragment of brick.\n\n“There’s not much worth much in my life,” she said, gazing down at the\npavement. “All I know how to do is run the farm, and try to stand up and speak\ntruth. But if I thought it was all tricks and lies even on Roke, I’d hate\nthose men for fooling me, fooling us all. It can’t be lies. Not all of it. The\nArchmage did go into the labyrinth among the Hoary Men and come back with the\nRing of Peace. He did go into death with the young king, and defeat the spider\nmage, and come back. We know that on the word of the king himself. Even here,\nthe harpers came to sing that song, and a teller came to tell it.”\n\nIvory nodded gravely. “But the Archmage lost all his power in the land of\ndeath. Maybe all magery was weakened then.”\n\n“Rose’s spells work as well as ever,” she said stoutly.\n\nIvory smiled. He said nothing, but she knew how petty the doings of a village\nwitch appeared to him, who had seen great deeds and powers. She sighed and\nspoke from her heart - “Oh, if only I wasn’t a woman!”\n\nHe smiled again. “You’re a beautiful woman,” he said, but plainly, not in the\nflattering way he had used with her at first, before she showed him she hated\nit. “Why would you be a man?”\n\n“So I could go to Roke! And see, and learn! Why, why is it only men can go\nthere?”\n\n“So it was ordained by the first Archmage, centuries ago,” said Ivory. “But\n... I too have wondered.”\n\n“You have?”\n\n“Often. Seeing only boys and men, day after day, in the Great House and all\nthe precincts of the School. Knowing that the townswomen are spell-bound from\nso much as setting foot on the fields about Roke Knoll. Once in years,\nperhaps, some great lady is allowed to come briefly into the outer courts. ..\nWhy is it so? Are all women incapable of understanding? Or is it that the\nMasters fear them, fear to be corrupted - no, but fear that to admit women\nmight change the rule they cling to - the ... purity of that rule.”\n\n“Women can live chaste as well as men can,” Dragonfly said bluntly. She knew\nshe was blunt and coarse where he was delicate and subtle, but she did not\nknow any other way to be.\n\n“Of course,” he said, his smile growing brilliant. “But witches aren’t always\nchaste, are they? Maybe that’s what the Masters are afraid of. Maybe celibacy\nisn’t as necessary as the Rule of Roke teaches. Maybe it’s not a way of\nkeeping the power pure, but of keeping the power to themselves. Leaving out\nwomen, leaving out everybody who won’t agree to turn himself into a eunuch to\nget that one kind of power ... Who knows? A she-mage! Now that would change\neverything, all the rules!”\n\nShe could see his mind dance ahead of hers, taking up and playing with ideas,\ntransforming them as he had transformed brick into butterfly. She could not\ndance with him, she could not play with him, but she watched him in wonder.\n\n“You could go to Roke,” he said, his eyes bright with excitement, mischief,\ndaring. Meeting her almost pleading, incredulous silence, he insisted: ‘You\ncould. A woman you are, but there are ways to change your seeming. You have\nthe heart, the courage, the will of a man. You could enter the Great House. I\nknow it.”\n\n“And what would I do there?”\n\n“What all the students do. Live alone in a stone cell and learn to be wise! It\nmight not be what you dream it to be, but that, too, you’d learn.”\n\n“I couldn’t. They’d know. I couldn’t even get in. There’s the Doorkeeper, you\nsaid. I don’t know the word to say to him.”\n\nThe password, yes. But I can teach it to you.”\n\n“You can? Is it allowed?”\n\n“I don’t care what’s “allowed”,” he said, with a frown she had never seen on\nhis face. The Archmage himself said, Rules are made to he broken. Injustice\nmakes the rules, and courage breaks them, I have the courage, if you do!”\n\nShe looked at him. She could not speak. She stood up and after a moment walked\nout of the stableyard, off across the hill, on the path that went around it\nhalfway up. One of the dogs, her favorite, a big, ugly, heavy-headed hound,\nfollowed her. She stopped on the slope above the marshy spring where Rose had\nnamed her ten years ago. She stood there; the dog sat down beside her and\nlooked up at her face. No thought was clear in her mind, but words repeated\nthemselves: I could go to Roke and find out who I am.\n\nShe looked westward over the reed beds and willows and the farther hills. The\nwhole western sky was empty, clear. She stood still and her soul seemed to go\ninto that sky and be gone, gone out of her.\n\nThere was a little noise, the soft clip-clop of the black mare’s hooves,\ncoming along the lane. Then Dragonfly came back to herself and called to Ivory\nand ran down the hill to meet him. “I will go,” she said.\n\nHe had not planned or intended any such adventure, but crazy as it was, it\nsuited him better the more he thought about it. The prospect of spending the\nlong grey winter at Westpool sank his spirits like a stone. There was nothing\nhere for him except the girl Dragonfly, who had come to fill his thoughts. Her\nmassive, innocent strength had defeated him absolutely so far, but he did what\nshe pleased in order to have her do at last what he pleased, and the game, he\nthought, was worth playing. If she ran away with him, the game was as good as\nwon. As for the joke of it, the notion of actually getting her into the School\non Roke disguised as a man, there was little chance of pulling it off, but it\npleased him as a gesture of disrespect to all the piety and pomposity of the\nMasters and their toadies. And if somehow it succeeded, if he could actually\nget a woman through that door, even for a moment, what a sweet revenge it\nwould be!\n\nMoney was a problem. The girl thought, of course, that he as a great wizard\nwould snap his fingers and waft them over the sea in a magic boat flying\nbefore the magewind. But when he told her they’d have to hire passage on a\nship, she said simply, “I have the cheese money.”\n\nHe treasured her rustic sayings of that kind. Sometimes she frightened him,\nand he resented it. His dreams of her were never of her yielding to him, but\nof himself yielding to a fierce, destroying sweetness, sinking into an\nannihilating embrace, dreams in which she was something beyond comprehension\nand he was nothing at all. He woke from those dreams shaken and shamed. In\ndaylight, when he saw her big, dirty hands, when she talked like a yokel, a\nsimpleton, he regained his superiority. He only wished there were someone to\nrepeat her sayings to, one of his old friends in the Great Port who would find\nthem amusing. “”I have the cheese money,”” he repeated to himself, riding back\nto Westpool, and laughed. “I do indeed,” he said aloud. The black mare nicked\nher ear.\n\nHe told Birch that he had received a sending from his teacher on Roke, the\nMaster Hand, and must go at once, on what business he could not say, of\ncourse, but it should not take long once he was there; a half-month to go,\nanother to return; he would be back well before the Fallows at the latest. He\nmust ask Master Birch to provide him an advance on his salary to pay for ship-\npassage and lodging, for a wizard of Roke should not take advantage of\npeople’s willingness to give him whatever he needed, but pay his way like an\nordinary man. As Birch agreed with this, he had to give Ivory a purse for his\njourney. It was the first real money he had had in his pocket for years: ten\nivory counters carved with the Otter of Shelieth on one side and the Rune of\nPeace on the other in honour of King Lebannen. “Hello, little namesakes,” he\ntold them when he was alone with them. “You and the cheese money will get\nalong nicely.”\n\nHe told Dragonfly very little of his plans, largely because he made few,\ntrusting to chance and his own wits, which seldom let him down if he was given\na fair chance to use them. The girl asked almost no questions. “Will I go as a\nman all the way?” was one.\n\n“Yes,” he said, “but only disguised. I won’t put a semblance-spell on you till\nwe’re on Roke Island.”\n\n“I thought it would be a spell of Change,” she said.\n\nThat would be unwise,” he said, with a good imitation of the Master Changer’s\nterse solemnity. “If need be, I’ll do it, of course. But you’ll find wizards\nvery sparing of the great spells. For good reason.”\n\nThe Equilibrium,” she said, accepting all he said in its simplest sense, as\nalways.\n\n“And perhaps because such arts have not the power they once had,” he said. He\ndid not know himself why he tried to weaken her faith in wizardry; perhaps\nbecause any weakening of her strength, her wholeness, was a gain for him. He\nhad begun merely by trying to get her into his bed, a game he loved to play.\nThe game had turned to a kind of contest he had not expected but could not put\nan end to. He was determined now not to win her, but to defeat her. He could\nnot let her defeat him. He must prove to her and himself that his dreams were\nmeaningless.\n\nQuite early on, impatient with wooing her massive physical indifference, he\nhad worked up a charm, a sorcerer’s seduction-spell of which he was\ncontemptuous even as he made it, though he knew it was effective. He cast it\non her while she was, characteristically, mending a cow’s halter. The result\nhad not been the melting eagerness it had produced in girls he had used it on\nin Havnor and Thwil. Dragonfly had gradually become silent and sullen. She\nceased asking her endless questions about Roke and did not answer when he\nspoke. When he very tentatively approached her, taking her hand, she struck\nhim away with a blow to the head that left him dizzy. He saw her stand up and\nstride out of the stableyard without a word, the ugly hound she favoured\ntrotting after her. It looked back at him with a grin.\n\nShe took the path to the old house. When his ears stopped ringing he stole\nafter her, hoping the charm was working and that this was only her\nparticularly uncouth way of leading him at last to her bed. Nearing the house,\nhe heard crockery breaking. The father, the drunkard, came wobbling out\nlooking scared and confused, followed by Dragonfly’s loud, harsh voice - “Out\nof the house, you drunken, crawling traitor! You foul, shameless lecher!”\n\n“She took my cup away,” the Master of Iria said to the stranger, whining like\na puppy, while his dogs yammered around him. “She broke it.”\n\nIvory departed. He did not return for two days. On the third day he rode\nexperimentally past Old Iria, and she came striding down to meet him. “I’m\nsorry, Ivory,” she said, looking up at him with her smoky orange eyes. “I\ndon’t know what came over me the other day. I was angry. But not at you. I beg\nyour pardon.”\n\nHe forgave her gracefully. He did not try a love-charm on her again.\n\nSoon, he thought now, he would not need one. He would have real power over\nher. He had finally seen how to get it. She had given it into his hands. Her\nstrength and her willpower were tremendous, but fortunately she was stupid,\nand he was not.\n\nBirch was sending a carter down to Kembermouth with six barrels of ten-year-\nold Fanian ordered by the wine merchant there. He was glad to send his wizard\nalong as bodyguard, for the wine was valuable, and though the young king was\nputting things to rights as fast as he could, there were still gangs of\nrobbers on the roads. So Ivory left Westpool on the big wagon pulled by four\nbig carthorses, jolting slowly along, his legs angling. Down by Jackass Hill\nan uncouth figure rose up from the wayside and asked the carter for a lift. “I\ndon’t know you,” the carter said, lifting his whip to warn the stranger off,\nbut Ivory came round the wagon and said, “Let the lad ride, my good man. He’ll\ndo no harm while I’m with you.”\n\n“Keep an eye on him then, master,” said the carter.\n\n“I will,” said Ivory, with a wink at Dragonfly. She, well disguised in dirt\nand a farmhand’s old smock and leggings and a loathsome felt hat, did not wink\nback. She played her part even while they sat side by side dangling their legs\nover the tailgate, with six great halftuns of wine jolting between them and\nthe drowsy carter, and the drowsy summer hills and fields slipping slowly,\nslowly past. Ivory tried to tease her, but she only shook her head. Maybe she\nwas scared by this wild scheme, now she was embarked on it. There was no\ntelling. She was solemnly, heavily silent. I could be very bored by this\nwoman, Ivory thought, if once I’d had her underneath me. That thought stirred\nhim almost unbearably, but when he looked back at her, his thoughts died away\nbefore her massive, actual presence.\n\nThere were no inns on this road through what had once all been the Domain of\nIria. As the sun neared the western plains, they stopped at a farmhouse that\noffered stabling for the horses, a shed for the cart, and straw in the stable\nloft for the carters. The loft was dark and stuffy and the straw musty. Ivory\nfelt no lust at all, though Dragonfly lay not three feet from him. She had\nplayed the man so thoroughly all day that she had half-convinced even him.\nMaybe she’ll fool the old men after all! he thought, and grinned at the\nthought, and slept.\n\nThey jolted on all the next day through a summer thundershower or two and\ncarne at dusk to Kembermouth, a walled, prosperous port city. They left the\ncarter to his master’s business and walked down to find an inn near the docks.\nDragonfly looked about at the sights of the city in a silence that might have\nbeen awe or disapproval or mere stolidity. “This is a nice little town,” Ivory\nsaid, “but the only city in the world is Havnor.”\n\nIt was no use trying to impress her; all she said was, “Ships don’t trade much\nto Roke, do they? Will it take a long time to find one to take us, do you\nthink?”\n\n“Not if I carry a staff,” he said.\n\nShe stopped looking about and strode along in thought for a while. She was\nbeautiful in movement, bold and graceful, her head carried high.\n\n“You mean they’ll oblige a wizard? But you aren’t a wizard.”\n\n“That’s a formality. We senior sorcerers may carry a staff when we’re on\nRoke’s business. Which I am.”\n\nTaking me there?”\n\n“Bringing them a student - yes. A student of great gifts!”\n\nShe asked no more questions. She never argued; it was one of her virtues.\n\nThat night, over supper at the waterfront inn, she asked with unusual timidity\nin her voice, “Do I have great gifts?”\n\n“In my judgment, you do,” he said.\n\nShe pondered - conversation with her was often a slow business - and said,\n“Rose always said I had power, but she didn’t know what kind. And I ... I know\nI do, but I don’t know what it is.”\n\n“You’re going to Roke to find out,” he said, raising his glass to her. After a\nmoment she raised hers and smiled at him, a smile so tender and radiant that\nhe said spontaneously, “And may what you find be all you seek!”\n\n“If I do, it will be thanks to you,” she said. In that moment he loved her for\nher true heart, and would have forsworn any thought of her but as his\ncompanion in a bold adventure, a gallant joke.\n\nThey had to share a room at the crowded inn with two other travellers, but\nIvory’s thoughts were perfectly chaste, though he laughed at himself a little\nfor it.\n\nNext morning he picked a sprig of herb from the kitchen-garden of the inn and\nspelled it into the semblance of a fine staff, coppershod and his own height\nexactly. “What is the wood?” Dragonfly asked, fascinated, when she saw it, and\nwhen he answered with a laugh, “Rosemary,” she laughed too.\n\nThey set off along the wharves, asking for a ship bound south that might take\na wizard and his prentice to the Isle of the Wise, and soon enough they found\na heavy trader bound for Wathort, whose master would carry the wizard for\ngoodwill and the prentice for half-price. Even half-price was half the cheese\nmoney, but they would have the luxury of a cabin, for Sea Otter was a decked,\ntwo-masted ship.\n\nAs they were talking with her master a wagon drew up on the dock and began to\nunload six familiar halftun barrels. That’s ours,” Ivory said, and the ship’s\nmaster said, “Bound for Hort Town,” and Dragonfly said softly, “From Iria.”\n\nShe glanced back at the land then. It was the only time he ever saw her look\nback.\n\nThe ship’s weatherworker came aboard just before they sailed, no Roke wizard\nbut a weatherbeaten fellow in a worn sea-cloak. Ivory flourished his staff a\nlittle in greeting him. The sorcerer looked him up and down and said, “One man\nworks weather on this ship. If it’s not me, I’m off.”\n\n“I’m a mere passenger, Master Bagman. I gladly leave the winds in your hands.”\n\nThe sorcerer looked at Dragonfly, who stood straight as a tree and said\nnothing.\n\n“Good,” he said, and that was the last word he spoke to Ivory.\n\nDuring the voyage, however, he talked several times with Dragonfly, which made\nIvory a bit uneasy. Her ignorance and trustfulness could endanger her and\ntherefore him. What did she and the bagman talk about? he asked, and she\nanswered, “What is to become of us.”\n\nHe stared.\n\n“Of all of us. Of Way, and Felkway, and Havnor, and Wathort, and Roke. All the\npeople of the islands. He says that when King Lebannen was to be crowned, last\nautumn, he sent to Gont for the old Archmage to come crown him, and he\nwouldn’t come. And there was no new Archmage. So he took the crown himself.\nAnd some say that’s wrong, and he doesn’t rightly hold the throne. But others\nsay the king himself is the new Archmage. But he isn’t a wizard, only a king.\nSo others say the dark years will come again, when there was no rule of\njustice, and wizardry was used for evil ends.”\n\nAfter a pause Ivory said, “That old weatherworker says all this?”\n\n“It’s common talk, I think,” said Dragonfly, with her grave simplicity.\n\nThe weatherworker knew his trade, at least. Sea Otter sped south; they met\nsummer squalls and choppy seas, but never a storm or a troublesome wind. They\nput off and took on cargo at ports on the north shore of O, at Ilien, Leng,\nKamery, and O Port, and then headed west to carry the passengers to Roke. And\nfacing the west Ivory felt a little hollow at the pit of his stomach, for he\nknew all too well how Roke was guarded. He knew neither he nor the\nweatherworker could do anything at all to turn the Roke-wind if it blew\nagainst them. And if it did. Dragonfly would ask why? Why did it blow against\nthem?\n\nHe was glad to see the sorcerer uneasy too, standing by the helmsman, keeping\na watch up on the masthead, taking in sail at the hint of a west wind. But the\nwind held steady from the north. A thunder-squall came pelting on that wind,\nand Ivory went down to the cabin, but Dragonfly stayed up on deck. She was\nafraid of the water, she had told him. She could not swim; she said, “Drowning\nmust be a horrible thing - not to breathe the air.” She had shuddered at the\nthought. It was the only fear she had ever shown of anything. But she disliked\nthe low, cramped cabin, and had stayed on deck every day and slept there on\nthe warm nights. Ivory had not tried to coax her into the cabin. He knew now\nthat coaxing was no good. To have her he must master her; and that he would\ndo, if only they could come to Roke.\n\nHe came up on deck again. It was clearing, and as the sun set the clouds broke\nall across the west, showing a golden sky behind the high dark curve of a\nhill.\n\nIvory looked at that hill with a kind of longing hatred.\n\n“That’s Roke Knoll, lad,” the weatherworker said to Dragonfly, who stood\nbeside him at the rail, “We’re coming into Thwil Bay now. Where there’s no\nwind but the wind they want.”\n\nBy the time they were well into the bay and had let down the anchor it was\ndark, and Ivory said to the ship’s master, “I’ll go ashore in the morning.”\n\nDown in their tiny cabin Dragonfly sat waiting for him, solemn as ever but her\neyes blazing with excitement. “We’ll go ashore in the morning,” he repeated to\nher, and she nodded, acceptant.\n\nShe said, “Do I look all right?”\n\nHe sat down on his narrow bunk and looked at her sitting on her narrow bunk;\nthey could not face each other directly, as there was no room for their knees.\nAt O Port she had bought herself a decent shirt and breeches, at his\nsuggestion, so as to look a more probable candidate for the School. Her face\nwas windburned and scrubbed clean. Her hair was braided and the braid clubbed,\nlike Ivory’s. She had got her hands clean, too, and they lay flat on her\nthighs, long strong hands, like a man’s.\n\n“You don’t look like a man,” he said. Her face fell. “Not to me. You’ll never\nlook like a man to me. But don’t worry. You will to them.”\n\nShe nodded, with an anxious face.\n\nThe first test is the great test, Dragonfly,” he said. Every night he lay\nalone in this cabin he had planned this conversation. “To enter the Great\nHouse: to go through that door.”\n\n“I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, hurried and earnest. “Couldn’t I just\ntell them who I am? With you there to vouch for me - to say even if I am a\nwoman, I have some gift - and I’d promise to take the vow and make the spell\nof celibacy, and live apart if they wanted me to -“\n\nHe was shaking his head all through her speech. “No, no, no, no. Hopeless.\nUseless. Fatal!”\n\n“Even if you -“\n\n“Even if I argued for you. They won’t listen. The Rule of Roke forbids women\nto be taught any high art, any word of the Language of the Making. It’s always\nbeen so. They will not listen. So they must be shown! And we’ll show them, you\nand I. We’ll teach them. You must have courage, Dragonfly. You must not\nweaken, and not think, “Oh, if I just beg them to let me in, they can’t refuse\nme.” They can, and will. And if you reveal yourself, they will punish you. And\nme.” He put a ponderous emphasis on the last word, and inwardly murmured,\n“Avert.”\n\nShe gazed at him from her unreadable eyes, and finally said, “What must I do?”\n\n“Do you trust me, Dragonfly?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Will you trust me entirely, wholly - knowing that the risk I take for you is\ngreater even than your risk in this venture?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then you must tell me the word you will speak to the Doorkeeper.”\n\nShe stared. “But I thought you’d tell it to me - the password.”\n\n“The password he will ask you for is your true name.”\n\nHe let that sink in for a while, and then continued softly, “And to work the\nspell of semblance on you, to make it so complete and deep that the Masters of\nRoke will see you as a man and nothing else, to do that, I too must know your\nname.” He paused again. As he talked it seemed to him that everything he said\nwas true, and his voice was moved and gentle as he said, “I could have known\nit long ago. But I chose not to use those arts. I wanted you to trust me\nenough to tell me your name yourself.”\n\nShe was looking down at her hands, clasped now on her knees. In the faint\nreddish glow of the cabin lantern her lashes cast very delicate, long shadows\non her cheeks. She looked up, straight at him. “My name is Irian,” she said.\n\nHe smiled. She did not smile.\n\nHe said nothing. In fact he was at a loss. If he had known it would be this\neasy, he could have had her name and with it the power to make her do whatever\nhe wanted, days ago, weeks ago, with a mere pretence at this crazy scheme -\nwithout giving up his salary and his precarious respectability, without this\nsea voyage, without having to go all the way to Roke for it! For he saw the\nwhole plan now was folly. There was no way he could disguise her that would\nfool the Doorkeeper for a moment. All his notions of humiliating the Masters\nas they had humiliated him were moonshine. Obsessed with tricking the girl, he\nhad fallen into the trap he laid for her. Bitterly he recognized that he was\nalways believing his own lies, caught in nets he had elaborately woven. Having\nmade a fool of himself on Roke, he had come back to do it all over again. A\ngreat, desolate anger swelled up in him. There was no good, no good in\nanything.\n\n“What’s wrong?” she asked. The gentleness of her deep, husky voice unmanned\nhim, and he hid his face in his hands, fighting against the shame of tears.\n\nShe put her hand on his knee. It was the first time she had ever touched him.\nHe endured it, the warmth and weight of her touch that he had wasted so much\ntime wanting.\n\nHe wanted to hurt her, to shock her out of her terrible, ignorant kindness,\nbut what he said when he finally spoke was, “I only wanted to make love to\nyou,”\n\n“You did?”\n\n“Did you think I was one of their eunuchs? That I’d castrate myself with\nspells so I could be holy? Why do you think I don’t have a staff? Why do you\nthink I’m not at the School? Did you believe everything I said?”\n\n“Yes,” she said. “I’m sorry.” Her hand was still on his knee. She said, “We\ncan make love if you want.”\n\nHe sat up, sat still.\n\n“What are you?” he said to her at last.\n\n“I don’t know. It’s why I wanted to come to Roke. To find out.”\n\nHe broke free, stood up, stooping; neither of them could stand straight in the\nlow cabin. Clenching and unclenching his hands, he stood as far from her as he\ncould, his back to her.\n\n“You won’t find out. It’s all lies, shams. Old men playing games with words. I\nwouldn’t play their games, so I left. Do you know what I did?” He turned,\nshowing his teeth in a rictus of triumph. “I got a girl, a town girl, to come\nto my room. My cell. My little stone celibate cell. It had a window looking\nout on a back-street. No spells - you can’t make spells with all their magic\ngoing on. But she wanted to come, and came, and I let a rope ladder out the\nwindow, and she climbed it. And we were at it when the old men came in! I\nshowed ‘em! And if I could have got you in, I’d have showed ‘em again, I’d\nhave taught them their lesson!”\n\n“Well, I’ll try,” she said.\n\nHe stared.\n\n“Not for the same reasons as you,” she said, “but I still want to. And we came\nall this way. And you know my name.”\n\nIt was true. He knew her name: Irian. It was like a coal of fire, a burning\nember in his mind. His thought could not hold it. His knowledge could not use\nit. His tongue could not say it.\n\nShe looked up at him, her sharp, strong face softened by the shadowy lantern-\nlight. “If it was only to make love you brought me here, Ivory,” she said, “we\ncan do that. If you still want to.”\n\nWordless at first, he simply shook his head. After a while he was able to\nlaugh. “I think we’ve gone on past .. . that possibility . . .”\n\nShe looked at him without regret, or reproach, or shame.\n\n“Irian,” he said, and now her name came easily, sweet and cool as spring water\nin his dry mouth. “Irian, here’s what you must do to enter the Great House...”\n\nIII. Azver\n\n  \n\nHe left her at the comer of the street, a narrow, dull, somehow sly-looking\nstreet that slanted up between featureless walls to a wooden door in a higher\nwall. He had put his spell on her, and she looked like a man, though she did\nnot feel like one. She and Ivory took each other in their arms, because after\nall they had been friends, companions, and he had done all this for her.\n“Courage!” he said, and let her go. She walked up the street and stood before\nthe door. She looked back then, but he was gone.\n\nShe knocked.\n\nAfter a while she heard the latch rattle. The door opened. An ordinary-looking\nmiddle-aged man stood there. “What can I do for you?” he said. He did not\nsmile, but his voice was pleasant.\n\n“You can let me into the Great House, sir.”\n\n“Do you know the way in?” His almond-shaped eyes were attentive, yet seemed to\nlook at her from miles or years away.\n\n“This is the way in, sir.”\n\n“Do you know whose name you must tell me before I let you in?”\n\n“My own, sir. It is Irian.”\n\n“Is it?” he said.\n\nThat gave her pause. She stood silent. “It’s the name the witch Rose of my\nvillage on Way gave me, in the spring under Iria Hill,” she said at last,\nstanding up and speaking truth.\n\nThe Doorkeeper looked at her for what seemed a long time. Then it is your\nname,” he said. “But maybe not all your name. I think you have another.”\n\n“I don’t know it, sir.”\n\nAfter another long time she said, “Maybe I can learn it here, sir.”\n\nThe Doorkeeper bowed his head a little. A very faint smile made crescent\ncurves in his cheeks. He stood aside. “Come in, daughter,” he said.\n\nShe stepped across the threshold of the Great House.\n\nIvory’s spell of semblance dropped away like a cobweb. She was and looked\nherself.\n\nShe followed the Doorkeeper down a stone passageway. Only at the end of it did\nshe think to turn back to see the light shine through the thousand leaves of\nthe tree carved in the high door in its bone-white frame.\n\nA young man in a grey cloak hurrying down the passageway stopped short as he\napproached them. He stared at Irian; then with a brief nod he went on. She\nlooked back at him. He was looking back at her.\n\nA globe of misty, greenish fire drifted swiftly down the corridor at eye\nlevel, apparently pursuing the young man. The Doorkeeper waved his hand at it,\nand it avoided him. Irian swerved and ducked down frantically, but felt the\ncool fire tingle in her hair as it passed over her. The Doorkeeper looked\nround, and now his smile was wider. Though he said nothing, she felt he was\naware of her, concerned for her. She stood up and followed him.\n\nHe stopped before an oak door. Instead of knocking he sketched a little sign\nor rune on it with the top of his staff, a light staff of some greyish wood.\nThe door opened as a resonant voice behind it said, “Come in!”\n\n“Wait here a little, if you please, Irian,” the Doorkeeper said, and went into\nthe room, leaving the door wide open behind him. She could see bookshelves and\nbooks, a table piled with more books and inkpots and writings, two or three\nboys seated at the table, and the grey-haired, stocky man the Doorkeeper spoke\nto. She saw the man’s face change, saw his eyes shift to her in a brief,\nstartled gaze, saw him question the Doorkeeper, low-voiced, intense.\n\nThey both came to her. “The Master Changer of Roke: Irian of Way,” said the\nDoorkeeper.\n\nThe Changer stared openly at her. He was not as tall as she was. He stared at\nthe Doorkeeper, and then at her again.\n\n“Forgive me for talking about you before your face, young woman,” he said,\n“but I must. Master Doorkeeper, you know I’d never question your judgment, but\nthe Rule is clear. I have to ask what moved you to break it and let her come\nin.”\n\n“She asked to,” said the Doorkeeper.\n\n“But. . .” The Changer paused.\n\n“When did a woman last ask to enter the School?”\n\n“They know the Rule doesn’t allow them.”\n\n“Did you know that, Irian?” the Doorkeeper asked her.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“So what brought you here?” the Changer asked, stern, but not hiding his\ncuriosity.\n\n“Master Ivory said I could pass for a man. Though I thought I should say who I\nwas. I will be as celibate as anyone, sir.”\n\nTwo long curves appeared on the Doorkeeper’s cheeks, enclosing the slow upturn\nof his smile. The Changer’s face remained stern, but he blinked, and after a\nlittle thought said, “I’m sure - yes - it was definitely the better plan to be\nhonest. What Master did you speak of?”\n\n“Ivory,” said the Doorkeeper. “A lad from Havnor Great Port, whom I let in\nthree years ago, and let out again last year, as you may recall.”\n\n“Ivory! That fellow that studied with the Hand? Is he here?” the Changer\ndemanded of Irian, wrathily. She stood straight and said nothing.\n\n“Not in the School,” the Doorkeeper said, smiling.\n\n“He fooled you, young woman. Made a fool of you by trying to make fools of\nus.”\n\n“I used him to help me get here and to tell me what to say to the Doorkeeper,”\nIrian said. “I’m not here to fool anybody, but to learn what I need to know.”\n\n“I’ve often wondered why I let the boy in,” said the Doorkeeper. “Now I begin\nto understand,”\n\nAt that the Changer looked at him, and after pondering said soberly,\n“Doorkeeper, what have you in mind?”\n\n“I think Irian of Way may have come to us seeking not only what she needs to\nknow, but also what we need to know.” The Doorkeeper’s tone was equally sober,\nand his smile was gone. “I think this may be a matter for talk among the nine\nof us.”\n\nThe Changer absorbed that with a look of real amazement; but he did not\nquestion the Doorkeeper. He said only, “But not among the students.”\n\nThe Doorkeeper shook his head, agreeing.\n\n“She can lodge in the town,” the Changer said, with some relief.\n\n“While we talk behind her back?”\n\n“You won’t bring her into the Council Room?” the Changer said in disbelief.\n\n“The Archmage brought the boy Arren there.”\n\n“But - but Arren was King Lebannen -“\n\n“And who is Irian?”\n\nThe Changer stood silent, and then he said quietly, with respect, “My friend,\nwhat is it you think to do, to learn? What is she, that you ask this for her?”\n\n“Who are we,” said the Doorkeeper, “that we refuse her without knowing what\nshe is?”\n\n“A woman,” said the Master Summoner.\n\nIrian had waited some hours in the Doorkeeper’s chamber, a low, light, bare\nroom with a small-paned window looking out on the kitchen-gardens of the Great\nHouse - handsome, well-kept gardens, long rows and beds of vegetables, greens,\nand herbs, with berry canes and fruit trees beyond. She saw a burly, dark-\nskinned man and two boys come out and weed one of the vegetable plots. It\neased her mind to watch their careful work. She wished she could help them at\nit. The waiting and the strangeness were very difficult. Once the Doorkeeper\ncame in, bringing her a plate with cold meat and bread and scallions, and she\nate because he told her to eat, but chewing and swallowing were hard work. The\ngardeners went away and there was nothing to watch out the window but the\ncabbages growing and the sparrows hopping, and now and then a hawk far up in\nthe sky, and the wind moving softly in the tops of tall trees, on beyond the\ngardens.\n\nThe Doorkeeper came back and said, “Come, Irian, and meet the Masters of\nRoke.” Her heart began to go at a carthorse gallop. She followed him through\nthe maze of corridors to a dark-walled room with a row of high pointed\nwindows. A group of men stood there, and every one of them turned to look at\nher as she came into the room.\n\n“Irian of Way, my lords,” said the Doorkeeper. They were all silent. He\nmotioned her to come farther into the room. “The Master Changer you have met,”\nhe said. He named all the others, but she could not take in the names of the\nmasteries, except that the Master Herbal was the one she had taken to be a\ngardener, and the youngest-looking of them, a tall man with a stern, beautiful\nface that seemed carved out of dark stone, was the Master Summoner. It was he\nwho spoke, when the Doorkeeper was done. “A woman,” he said.\n\nThe Doorkeeper nodded once, mild as ever.\n\n“This is what you brought the Nine together for? This and no more?”\n\n“This and no more,” said the Doorkeeper.\n\n“Dragons have been seen flying above the Inmost Sea. Roke has no Archmage, and\nthe islands no true-crowned king. There is real work to do,” the Summoner\nsaid, and his voice too was like stone, cold and heavy. “When will we do it?”\n\nThere was an uncomfortable silence, as the Doorkeeper did not speak. At last a\nslight, bright-eyed man who wore a red tunic under his grey wizard’s cloak\nsaid, “Do you bring this woman into the House as a student. Master\nDoorkeeper?”\n\n“If I did, it would be up to you all to approve or disapprove,” said he.\n\n“Do you?” asked the man in the red tunic, smiling a little.\n\n“Master Hand,” said the Doorkeeper, “she asked to enter as a student, and I\nsaw no reason to deny her.”\n\n“Every reason,” said the Summoner.\n\nA man with a deep, clear voice spoke: ‘It’s not our judgment that prevails,\nbut the Rule of Roke, which we are sworn to follow.”\n\n“I doubt the Doorkeeper would defy it lightly,” said one of them Irian had not\nnoticed till he spoke, though he was a big man, white-haired, aw-boned, and\ncrag-faced. Unlike the others, he looked at her as he spoke. “I am\nKurremkarmerruk,” he said to her. “As the Master Namer here, I make free with\nnames, my own included. Who named you, Irian?”\n\n“The witch Rose of our village, lord,” she answered, standing straight, though\nher voice came out high-pitched and rough.\n\n“Is she misnamed?” the Doorkeeper asked the Namer.\n\nKurremkarmerruk shook his head. “No. But....”\n\nThe Summoner, who had been standing with his back to them, facing the fireless\nhearth, turned round. “The names witches give each other are not our concern\nhere,” he said. “If you have some interest in this woman, Doorkeeper, it\nshould be pursued outside these walls - outside the door you vowed to keep.\nShe has no place here nor ever will. She can bring only confusion, dissension,\nand further weakness among us. I will speak no longer and say nothing else in\nher presence. The only answer to conscious error is silence.”\n\n“Silence is not enough, my lord,” said one who had not spoken before. To\nIrian’s eyes he was very strange-looking, having pale reddish skin, long pale\nhair, and narrow eyes the colour of ice. His speech was also strange, stiff\nand somehow deformed. “Silence is the answer to everything, and to nothing,”\nhe said.\n\nThe Summoner lifted his noble, dark face and looked across the room at the\npale man, but did not speak. Without a word or gesture he turned away again\nand left the room. As he walked slowly past Irian, she shrank back from him.\nIt was as if a grave had opened, a winter grave, cold, wet, dark. Her breath\nstuck in her throat. She gasped a little for air. When she recovered herself\nshe saw the Changer and the pale man both watching her intently.\n\nThe one with a voice like a deep-toned bell looked at her too, and spoke to\nher with a plain, kind severity. “As I see it, the man who brought you here\nmeant to do harm, but you do not. Yet being here, Irian, you do us and\nyourself harm. Everything not in its own place does harm. A note sung, however\nwell sung, wrecks the tune it isn’t part of. Women teach women. Witches learn\ntheir craft from other witches and from sorcerers, not from wizards. What we\nteach here is in a language not for women’s tongues. The young heart rebels\nagainst such laws, calling them unjust, arbitrary. But they are true laws,\nfounded not on what we want, but on what is. The just and the unjust, the\nfoolish and the wise, all must obey them, or waste life and come to grief.”\n\nThe Changer and a thin, keen-faced old man standing beside him nodded in\nagreement. The Master Hand said, “Irian, I am sorry. Ivory was my pupil. If I\ntaught him badly, I did worse in sending him away. I thought him\ninsignificant, and so harmless. But he lied to you and beguiled you. You must\nnot feel shame. The fault was his, and mine.”\n\n“I am not ashamed,” Irian said. She looked at them all. She felt that she\nshould thank them for their courtesy but the words would not come. She nodded\nstiffly to them, turned round, and strode out of the room.\n\nThe Doorkeeper caught up with her as she came to a cross-corridor and stood\nnot knowing which way to take. “This way,” he said, falling into step beside\nher, and after a while, “This way,” and so they came quite soon to a door. It\nwas not made of horn and ivory. It was uncarved oak, black and massive, with\nan iron bolt worn thin with age. “This is the back door,” the mage said,\nunbolting it. “Media’s Gate, they used to call it. I keep both doors.” He\nopened it. The brightness of the day dazzled Irian’s eyes. When she could see\nclearly she saw a path leading from the door through the gardens and the\nfields beyond them; beyond the fields were the high trees, and the swell of\nRoke Knoll off to the right. But standing on the path just outside the door as\nif waiting for them was the pale-haired man with narrow eyes.\n\n“Patterner,” said the Doorkeeper, not at all surprised.\n\n“Where do you send this lady?” said the Patterner in his strange speech.\n\n“Nowhere,” said the Doorkeeper. “I let her out as I let her in, at her\ndesire.”\n\n“Will you come with me?” the Patterner said to Irian.\n\nShe looked at him and at the Doorkeeper and said nothing.\n\n“I don’t live in this House. In any house,” the Patterner said. “I live there.\nThe Grove - ah,” he said, turning suddenly. The big, white-haired man,\nKurremkarmerruk the Namer, was standing just down the path. He had not been\nstanding there until the other mage said ‘Ah.” Irian stared from one to the\nother in blank bewilderment.\n\nThis is only a seeming of me, a presentment, a sending,” the old man said to\nher. “I don’t live here either. Miles off.” He gestured northward. “You might\ncome there when you’re done with the Patterner here. I’d like to learn more\nabout your name.” He nodded to the other two mages and was not there. A\nbumblebee buzzed heavily through the air where he had been.\n\nIrian looked down at the ground. After a long time she said, clearing her\nthroat, not looking up, “Is it true I do harm being here?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said the Doorkeeper.\n\n“In the Grove is no harm,” said the Patterner. “Come on. There is an old\nhouse, a hut. Old, dirty. You don’t care, eh? Stay a while. You can see,” And\nhe set off down the path between the parsley and the bush-beans. She looked at\nthe Doorkeeper; he smiled a little. She followed the pale-haired man.\n\nThey walked a half-mile or so. The Knoll rose up full in the western sun on\ntheir right. Behind them the School sprawled grey and many-roofed on its lower\nhill. The grove of trees towered before them now. She saw oak and willow,\nchestnut and ash, and tall evergreens. From the dense, sun-shot darkness of\nthe trees a stream ran out, green-banked, with many brown trodden places where\ncattle and sheep went down to drink or to cross over. They had come through\nthe stile from a pasture where fifty or sixty sheep grazed the short, bright\nturf, and now stood near the stream. That house,” said the mage, pointing to a\nlow, moss-ridden roof half-hidden by the afternoon shadows of the trees. “Stay\ntonight. You will?”\n\nHe asked her to stay, he did not tell her to. All she could do was nod.\n\n“I’ll bring food,” he said, and strode on, quickening his pace so that he\nvanished soon, though not so abruptly as the Namer, in the light and shadow\nunder the trees. Irian watched till he was certainly gone and then made her\nway through high grass and weeds to the little house.\n\nIt looked very old. It had been rebuilt and rebuilt again, but not for a long\ntime. Nor had anyone lived in it for a long time, from the feel of it. But it\nwas a pleasant feeling, as if those who had slept there had slept peacefully.\nAs for decrepit walls, mice, cobwebs, and scant furniture, none of that was\nnew to Irian. She found a bald broom and swept out a bit. She unrolled her\nblanket on the plank bed. She found a cracked pitcher in a skew-doored cabinet\nand filled it with water from the stream that ran clear and quiet ten steps\nfrom the door. She did these things in a kind of trance, and having done them,\nsat down in the grass with her back against the house wall, which held the\nheat of the sun, and fell asleep.\n\nWhen she woke, the Master Patterner was sitting nearby, and a basket was on\nthe grass between them.\n\n“Hungry? Eat,” he said.\n\n“I’ll eat later, sir. Thank you,” said Irian.\n\n“I am hungry now,” said the mage. He took a hardboiled egg from the basket,\ncracked, shelled, and ate it.\n\nThey call this the Otter’s House,” he said. “Very old. As old as the Great\nHouse. Everything is old, here. We are old - the Masters.”\n\n“You’re not,” Irian said. She thought him between thirty and forty, though it\nwas hard to tell; she kept thinking his hair was white, because it was not\nblack.\n\n“But I came far. Miles can be years. I am Kargish, from Karego. You know?”\n\n“The Hoary Men!” said Irian, staring openly at him. All Daisy’s ballads of the\nHoary Men who sailed out of the east to lay the land waste and spit innocent\nbabes on their lances, and the story of how Erreth-Akbe lost the Ring of\nPeace, and the new songs and the King’s Tale about how Archmage Sparrowhawk\nhad gone among the Hoary Men and come back with that ring -\n\n“Hoary?” said the Patterner.\n\n“Frosty. White,” she said, looking away, embarrassed.\n\n“Ah.” Presently he said, “The Master Summoner is not old.” And she got a\nsidelong look from those narrow, ice-coloured eyes.\n\nShe said nothing.\n\n“I think you feared him.”\n\nShe nodded.\n\nWhen she said nothing, and some time had passed, he said, “In the shadow of\nthese trees is no harm. Only truth.”\n\n“When he passed me,” she said in a low voice, “I saw a grave.”\n\n“Ah,” said the Patterner.\n\nHe had made a little heap of bits of eggshell on the ground by his knee. He\narranged the white fragments into a curve, then closed it into a circle.\n“Yes,” he said, studying his eggshells, then, scratching up the earth a bit,\nhe neatly and delicately buried them. He dusted off his hands. Again his\nglance flicked to Irian and away.\n\n“You have been a witch, Irian?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“But you have some knowledge.”\n\n“No. I don’t. Rose wouldn’t teach me. She said she didn’t dare. Because I had\npower but she didn’t know what it was.”\n\n“Your Rose is a wise flower,” said the mage, unsmiling.\n\n“But I know I have -I have something to do, to be. That’s why I wanted to come\nhere. To find out. On the Isle of the Wise.”\n\nShe was getting used to his strange face now and was able to read it. She\nthought that he looked sad. His way of speaking was harsh, quick, dry,\npeaceable. The men of the Isle are not always wise, eh?” he said. “Maybe the\nDoorkeeper.” He looked at her now, not glancing but squarely, his eyes\ncatching and holding hers. “But there. In the wood. Under the trees. There is\nthe old wisdom. Never old. I can’t teach you. I can take you into the Grove.”\nAfter a minute he stood up. “Yes?”\n\n“Yes,” she said uncertainly.\n\n“The house is all right?”\n\n“Yes -“\n\n“Tomorrow,” he said, and strode off.\n\nSo for a half-month or more of the hot days of summer, Irian slept in the\nOtter’s House, which was a peaceful one, and ate what the Master Patterner\nbrought her in his basket - eggs, cheese, greens, fruit, smoked mutton - and\nwent with him every afternoon into the grove of high trees, where the paths\nseemed never to be quite where she remembered them, and often led on far\nbeyond what seemed the confines of the wood. They walked there in silence, and\nspoke seldom when they rested. The mage was a quiet man. Though there was a\nhint of fierceness in him, he never showed it to her, and his presence was as\neasy as that of the trees and the rare birds and four-legged creatures of the\nGrove. As he had said, he did not try to teach her. When she asked about the\nGrove, he told her that, with Roke Knoll, it had stood since Segoy made the\nislands of the world, and that all magic was in the roots of the trees, and\nthat they were mingled with the roots of all the forests that were or might\nyet be. “And sometimes the Grove is in this place,” he said, “and sometimes in\nanother. But it is always.”\n\nShe had never seen where he lived. He slept wherever he chose to, she\nimagined, in these warm summer nights, She asked him where the food they ate\ncame from; what the School did not supply for itself, he said, the farmers\nround about provided, considering themselves well recompensed by the\nprotections the Masters set on their flocks and fields and orchards. That made\nsense to her. On Way, “a wizard without his porridge” meant something\nunprecedented, unheard-of. But she was no wizard, and so, thinking to earn her\nporridge, she did her best to repair the Otter’s House, borrowing tools from a\nfarmer and buying nails and plaster in Thwil Town, for she still had half the\ncheese money.\n\nThe Patterner never came to her much before noon, so she had the mornings\nfree. She was used to solitude, but still she missed Rose and Daisy and Coney,\nand the chickens and the cows and ewes, and the rowdy, foolish dogs, and all\nthe work she did at home trying to keep Old Iria together and put food on the\ntable. So she worked away unhurriedly every morning till she saw the mage come\nout from the trees with his sunlight-coloured hair shining in the sunlight.\n\nOnce there in the Grove she had no thought of earning, or deserving, or even\nof learning. To be there was enough, was all.\n\nWhen she asked him if students came there from the Great House, he said,\n“Sometimes.” Another time he said, “My words are nothing. Hear the leaves.”\nThat was all he said that could be called teaching. As she walked, she\nlistened to the leaves when the wind rustled them or stormed in the crowns of\nthe trees; she watched the shadows play, and thought about the roots of the\ntrees down in the darkness of the earth. She was utterly content to be there.\nYet always, without discontent or urgency, she felt that she was waiting. And\nthat silent expectancy was deepest and clearest when she came out of the\nshelter of the woods and saw the open sky.\n\nOnce, when they had gone a long way and the trees, dark evergreens she did not\nknow, stood very high about them, she heard a call - a horn blowing, a cry? -\nremote, on the very edge of hearing. She stood still, listening towards the\nwest. The mage walked on, turning only when he realized she had stopped.\n\n“I heard -“ she said, and could not say what she had heard.\n\nHe listened. They walked on at last through a silence enlarged and deepened by\nthat far call.\n\nShe never went into the Grove without him, and it was many days before he left\nher alone within it. But one hot afternoon when they came to a glade among a\nstand of oaks, he said, “I will come back here, eh?” and walked off with his\nquick, silent step, lost almost at once in the dappled, shifting depths of the\nforest.\n\nShe had no wish to explore for herself. The peacefulness of the place called\nfor stillness, watching, listening; and she knew how tricky the paths were,\nand that the Grove was, as the Patterner put it, “bigger inside than outside’.\nShe sat down in a patch of sun-dappled shade and watched the shadows of the\nleaves play across the ground. The oakmast was deep; though she had never seen\nwild swine in the wood, she saw their tracks here. For a moment she caught the\nscent of a fox. Her thoughts moved as quietly and easily as the breeze moved\nin the warm light.\n\nOften her mind here seemed empty of thought, full of the forest itself, but\nthis day memories came to her, vivid. She thought about Ivory, thinking she\nwould never see him again, wondering if he had found a ship to take him back\nto Havnor. He had told her he’d never go back to Westpool; the only place for\nhim was the Great Port, the King’s City, and for all he cared the island of\nWay could sink in the sea as deep as Solea. But she thought with love of the\nroads and fields of Way. She thought of Old Iria village, the marshy spring\nunder Iria Hill, the old house on it. She thought about Daisy singing ballads\nin the kitchen, winter evenings, beating out the time with her wooden clogs;\nand old Coney in the vineyards with his razor-edge knife, showing her how to\nprune the vine “right down to the life in it”; and Rose, her Etaudis,\nwhispering charms to ease the pain in a child’s broken arm. I have known wise\npeople, she thought. Her mind flinched away from remembering her father, but\nthe motion of the leaves and shadows drew it on. She saw him drunk, shouting.\nShe felt his prying, tremulous hands on her. She saw him weeping, sick,\nshamed, and grief rose up through her body and dissolved, like an ache that\nmelts away in a long stretch. He was less to her than the mother she had not\nknown.\n\nShe stretched, feeling the ease of her body in the warmth, and her mind\ndrifted back to Ivory. She had had no one in her life to desire. When the\nyoung wizard first came riding by so slim and arrogant, she wished she could\nwant him; but she didn’t and couldn’t, and so she had thought him spell-\nprotected. Rose had explained to her how wizards’ spells worked ‘so that it\nnever enters your head nor theirs, see, because it would take from their\npower, they say’. But Ivory, poor Ivory, had been all too unprotected. If\nanybody was under a spell of chastity it must have been herself, for charming\nand handsome as he was she had never been able to feel a thing for him but\nliking, and her only lust was to learn what he could teach her.\n\nShe considered herself, sitting in the deep silence of the Grove. No bird\nsang; the breeze was down; the leaves hung still. Am I ensorcelled? Am I a\nsterile thing, not whole, not a woman? she asked herself, looking at her\nstrong bare arms, the slight, soft swell of her breasts in the shadow under\nthe throat of her shirt.\n\nShe looked up and saw the Hoary Man come out of a dark aisle of great oaks and\ncome towards her across the glade.\n\nHe stopped in front of her. She felt herself blush, her face and throat\nburning, dizzy, her ears ringing. She sought words, anything to say, to turn\nhis attention away from her, and could find nothing at all. He sat down near\nher. She looked down, as if studying the skeleton of a last-year’s leaf by her\nhand.\n\nWhat do I want? she asked herself, and the answer came not in words but\nthroughout her whole body and soul: the fire, a greater fire than that, the\nflight, the flight burning -\n\nShe came back into herself, into the still air under the trees. The Hoary Man\nsat near her, his face bowed down, and she thought how slight and light he\nlooked, how quiet and sorrowful. There was nothing to fear. There was no harm.\n\nHe looked over at her.\n\n“Irian,” he said, “do you hear the leaves?”\n\nThe breeze was moving again slightly; she could hear a bare whispering among\nthe oaks. “A little,” she said.\n\n“Do you hear the words?”\n\n“No.”\n\nShe asked nothing and he said no more. Presently he got up, and she followed\nhim to the path that always led them, sooner or later, out of the wood to the\nclearing by the Thwilburn and the Otter’s House. When they came there, it was\nlate afternoon. He went down to the stream and drank from it where it left the\nwood, above all the crossings. She did the same. Then sitting in the cool,\nlong grass of the bank, he began to speak.\n\n“My people, the Kargs, they worship gods. Twin gods, brothers. And the king\nthere is also a god. But before that and after are the streams. Caves, stones,\nhills. Trees. The earth. The darkness of the earth.”\n\nThe Old Powers,” Irian said.\n\nHe nodded. There, women know the Old Powers. Here too, witches. And the\nknowledge is bad - eh?”\n\nWhen he added that little questioning “eh?” or “neh?” to the end of what had\nseemed a statement it always took her by surprise. She said nothing.\n\n“Dark is bad,” said the Patterner. “Eh?”\n\nIrian drew a deep breath and looked at him eye to eye as they sat there.\n“”Only in dark the light,”” she said.\n\n“Ah,” he said. He looked away so that she could not see his expression.\n\n“I should go,” she said. “I can walk in the Grove, but not live there. It\nisn’t my - my place. And the Master Chanter said I did harm by being here.”\n\n“We all do harm by being,” said the Patterner.\n\nHe did as he often did, made a little design out of whatever lay to hand: on\nthe bit of sand on the riverbank in front of him he set a leaf-stem, a\ngrassblade, and several pebbles. He studied them and rearranged them. “Now I\nmust speak of harm,” he said.\n\nAfter a long pause he went on. “You know that a dragon brought back our Lord\nSparrowhawk, with the young king, from the shores of death. Then the dragon\ncarried Sparrowhawk away to his home, for his power was gone, he was not a\nmage. So presently the Masters of Roke met to choose a new Archmage, here, in\nthe Grove, as always. But not as always.\n\n“Before the dragon came, the Summoner too had returned from death, where he\ncan go, where his art can take him. He had seen our lord and the young king\nthere, in that country across the wall of stones. He said they would not come\nback. He said Lord Sparrowhawk had told him to come back to us, to life, to\nbear that word. So we grieved for our lord.\n\n“But then came the dragon, Kalessin, bearing him living.\n\n“The Summoner was among us when we stood on Roke Knoll and saw the Archmage\nkneel to King Lebannen. Then, as the dragon bore our friend away, the Summoner\nfell down.\n\n“He lay as if dead, cold, his heart not beating, yet he breathed. The Herbal\nused all his art, but could not rouse him. “He is dead,” he said. “The breath\nwill not leave him, but he is dead.” So we mourned him. Then, because here was\ndismay among us, and all my patterns spoke of change and danger, we met to\nchoose a new Warden of Roke, an Archmage to guide us. And in our council we\nset the young king in the Summoner’s place. To us it seemed right that he\nshould sit among us. Only the Changer spoke against it at first, and then\nagreed.\n\n“But we met, we sat, and we could not choose. We said this and said that, but\nno name was spoken. And then I...” He paused a while. There came on me what my\npeople call the eduevanu, the other breath. Words came to me and I spoke them.\nI said, Hama Gondun! And Kurremkarmerruk told them this in Hardic: “A woman on\nGont.” But when I came back to my own wits, I could not tell them what that\nmeant. And so we parted with no Archmage chosen.\n\nThe king left soon after, and the Master Windkey went with him. Before the\nking was to be crowned, they went to Gont and sought our lord, to find what\nthat meant, “a woman on Gont”. Eh? But they did not see him, only my\ncountrywoman Tenar of the Ring. She said she was not the woman they sought.\nAnd they found no one, nothing. So Lebannen judged it to be a prophecy yet to\nbe fulfilled. And in Havnor he set his crown on his own head.\n\nThe Herbal, and I too, judged the Summoner dead. We thought the breath he\nbreathed was left from some spell of his own art that we did not understand,\nlike the spell snakes know that keeps their heart beating long after they are\ndead. Though it seemed terrible to bury a breathing body, yet he was cold, and\nhis blood did not run, and no soul was in him. That was more terrible. So we\nmade ready to bury him. And then, by his grave, his eyes opened. He moved, and\nspoke. He said, “I have summoned myself again into life, to do what must be\ndone.”’\n\nThe Patterner’s voice had grown rougher, and he suddenly brushed the little\ndesign of pebbles apart with the palm of his hand.\n\n“So when the Windkey returned, we were nine again. But divided. For the\nSummoner said we must meet again and choose an Archmage. The king had had no\nplace among us, he said. And “a woman on Gont”, whoever she may be, has no\nplace among the men on Roke. Eh? The Windkey, the Chanter, the Changer, the\nHand, say he is right. And as King Lebannen is one returned from death,\nfulfilling that prophecy, they say so will the Archmage be one returned from\ndeath.”\n\n“But -“ Irian said, and stopped.\n\nAfter a while the Patterner said, “That art, summoning, you know, is very . .\n. terrible. It is ... always danger. Here,” and he looked up into the green-\ngold darkness of the trees, “here is no summoning. No bringing back across the\nwall. No wall.”\n\nHis face was a warrior’s face, but when he looked into the trees it was\nsoftened, yearning.\n\n“So,” he said, “now he makes you his reason for our meeting. But I will not go\nto the Great House. I will not be summoned.”\n\n“He won’t come here?”\n\n“I think he will not walk in the Grove. Nor on Roke Knoll. On the Knoll, what\nis, is so,”\n\nShe did not know what he meant, but did not ask, preoccupied: “You say he\nmakes me his reason for you to meet together.”\n\n“Yes. To send away one woman, it takes nine mages.” He very seldom smiled, and\nwhen he did it was quick and fierce. “We are to meet to uphold the Rule of\nRoke. And so to choose an Archmage.”\n\n“If I went away -“ She saw him shake his head. “I could go to the Namer -“\n\n“You are safer here.”\n\nThe idea of doing harm troubled her, but the idea of danger had not entered\nher mind. She found it inconceivable. “I’ll be all right,” she said. “So the\nNamer, and you - and the Doorkeeper?”\n\n“- do not wish Thorion to be Archmage. Also the Master Herbal, though he digs\nand says little.”\n\nHe saw Irian staring at him in amazement. Thorion the Summoner speaks his true\nname,” he said. “He died, eh?”\n\nShe knew that King Lebannen used his true name openly. He too had returned\nfrom death. Yet that the Summoner should do so continued to shock and disturb\nher as she thought about it.\n\n“And the ... the students?”\n\n“Divided also.”\n\nShe thought about the School, where she had been so briefly. From here, under\nthe eaves of the Grove, she saw it as stone walls enclosing all one kind of\nbeing and keeping out all others, like a pen, a cage. How could any of them\nkeep their balance in a place like that?\n\nThe Patterner pushed four pebbles into a little curve on the sand and said, “I\nwish the Sparrowhawk had not gone. I wish I could read what the shadows write.\nBut all I can hear the leaves say is change, change... Everything will change\nbut them.” He looked up into the trees again with that yearning look. The sun\nwas setting; he stood up, bade her goodnight gently, and walked away, entering\nunder the trees.\n\nShe sat on a while by the Thwilburn. She was troubled by what he had told her\nand by her thoughts and feelings in the Grove, and troubled that any thought\nor feeling could have troubled her there. She went to the house, set out her\nsupper of smoked meat and bread and summer lettuce, and ate it without tasting\nit. She roamed restlessly back down he streambank to the water. It was very\nstill and warm in the late dusk, only the largest stars burning through a\nmilky overcast. She slipped off her sandals and put her feet in the water. It\nwas cool, but veins of sunwarmth ran through it. She slid out of her clothes,\nthe man’s breeches and shirt that were all she had, and slipped naked into the\nwater, feeling the push and stir of the current all along her body. She had\nnever swum in the streams at Iria, and she had hated the sea, heaving grey and\ncold, but this quick water pleased her, tonight. She drifted and floated, her\nhands slipping over silken underwater rocks and her own silken flanks, her\nlegs sliding through waterweeds. All trouble and restlessness washed away from\nher in the running of the water, and she floated in delight in the caress of\nthe stream, gazing up at the white, soft fire of the stars.\n\nA chill ran through her. The water ran cold. Gathering herself together, her\nlimbs still soft and loose, she looked up and saw on the bank above her the\nblack figure of a man.\n\nShe stood straight up in the water.\n\n“Get out!” she shouted. “Get away, you traitor, you foul lecher, or I’ll cut\nthe liver out of you!” She sprang up the bank, pulling herself up by the tough\nbunchgrass, and scrambled to her feet. No one was there. She stood afire,\nshaking with rage. She leapt back down the bank, found her clothes, and pulled\nthem on, still swearing - “You coward wizard! You traitorous son of a bitch!”\n\n“Irian?”\n\n“He was here!” she cried. “That foul heart, that Thorion!” She strode to meet\nthe Patterner as he came into the starlight by the house. “I was bathing in\nthe stream, and he stood there watching me!”\n\n“A sending - only a seeming of him. It could not hurt you, Irian.”\n\n“A sending with eyes, a seeming with seeing! May he be -“ She stopped, at a\nloss suddenly for the word. She felt sick. She shuddered, and swallowed the\ncold spittle that welled in her mouth.\n\nThe Patterner came forward and took her hands in his. His hands were warm, and\nshe felt so mortally cold that she came close up against him for the warmth of\nhis body. They stood so for a while, her face turned from him but their hands\njoined and their bodies pressed close. At last she broke free, straightening\nherself, pushing back her lank wet hair. Thank you,” she said. “I was cold.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“I’m never cold,” she said. “It was him.”\n\n“I tell you, Irian, he cannot come here, he cannot harm you here.”\n\n“He cannot harm me anywhere,” she said, the fire running through her veins\nagain. “If he tries to, I’ll destroy him.”\n\n“Ah,” said the Patterner.\n\nShe looked at him in the starlight, and said, “Tell me your name - not your\ntrue name - only what I can call you. When I think of you.”\n\nHe stood silent a minute, and then said, “In Karego-At, when I was a\nbarbarian, I was Azver. In Hardic, that is a banner of war.”\n\n“Azver,” she said. “Thank you.”\n\nShe lay awake in the little house, feeling the air stifling and the ceiling\npressing down on her, then slept suddenly and deeply. She woke as suddenly\nwhen the east was just getting light. She went to the door to see what she\nloved best to see, the sky before sunrise. Looking down from it she saw Azver\nthe Patterner rolled up in his grey cloak, sound asleep on the ground before\nher doorstep. She withdrew noiselessly into the house. In a little while she\nsaw him going back to his woods, walking a bit stiffly and scratching his head\nas he went, as people do when half awake.\n\nShe got to work scraping down the inner wall of the house, readying it to\nplaster. But before the sun was in the windows, there was a knock at her open\ndoor. Outside was the man she had thought was a gardener, the Master Herbal,\nlooking solid and stolid, like a brown ox, beside the gaunt, grim-faced old\nNamer.\n\nShe came to the door and muttered some kind of greeting. They daunted her,\nthese Masters of Roke, and also their presence meant that the peaceful time\nwas over, the days of walking in the silent summer forest with the Patterner.\nThat had come to an end last night. She knew it, but she did not want to know\nit.\n\n“The Patterner sent for us,” said the Master Herbal. He looked uncomfortable.\nNoticing a clump of weeds under the window, he said, “That’s velvet. Somebody\nfrom Havnor planted it here. Didn’t know there was any on the island.” He\nexamined it attentively, and put some seedpods into his pouch.\n\nIrian was studying the Namer covertly but equally attentively, trying to see\nif she could tell if he was what he had called a sending or was there in flesh\nand blood. Nothing about him appeared insubstantial, but she thought he was\nnot there, and when he stepped into the slanting sunlight and cast no shadow,\nshe knew it.\n\n“Is it a long way from where you live, sir?” she asked.\n\nHe nodded. “Left myself halfway,” he said. He looked up; the Patterner was\ncoming towards them, wide awake now.\n\nHe greeted them and asked, “The Doorkeeper will come?”\n\n“Said he thought he’d better keep the doors,” said the Herbal. He closed is\nmany-pocketed pouch carefully and looked around at the others. “But I don’t\nknow if he can keep a lid on the ant-hill.”\n\n“What’s up?” said Kurremkarmerruk. “I’ve been reading about dragons. Not\npaying attention. But all the boys I had studying at the Tower left.”\n\n“Summoned,” said the Herbal, drily.\n\n“So?” said the Namer, more drily.\n\n“I can tell you only how it seems to me,” the Herbal said, reluctant,\nuncomfortable.\n\n“Do that,” the old mage said.\n\nThe Herbal still hesitated. “This lady is not of our council,” he said at\nlast.\n\n“She is of mine,” said Azver.\n\n“She came to this place at this time,” the Namer said. “And to this place, at\nthis time, no one comes by chance. All any of us knows is how it seems to us.\nThere are names behind names, my Lord Healer.”\n\nThe dark-eyed mage bowed his head at that, and said, “Very well,” evidently\nwith relief at accepting their judgment over his own. “Thorion has been much\nwith the other Masters, and with the young men. Secret meetings, inner\ncircles. Rumors, whispers. The younger students are frightened, and several\nhave asked me or the Doorkeeper if they may go. And we’d let them go. But\nthere’s no ship in port, and none has come into Thwil Bay since the one that\nbrought you, lady, and sailed again next day for Wathort. The Windkey keeps\nthe Roke-wind against all. If the king himself should come, he could not land\non Roke,”\n\n“Until the wind changes, eh?” said the Patterner.\n\n“Thorion says Lebannen is not truly king, since no Archmage crowned him,”\n\n“Nonsense! Not history!” said the old Namer. “The first Archmage came\ncenturies after the last king. Roke ruled in the kings’ stead.”\n\n“Ah,” said the Patterner. “Hard for the housekeeper to give up the keys when\nthe owner comes home.”\n\n“The Ring of Peace is healed,” said the Herbal, in his patient, troubled\nvoice, “the prophecy is fulfilled, the son of Morred is crowned, and yet we\nhave no peace. Where have we gone wrong? Why can we not find the balance?”\n\n“What does Thorion intend?” asked the Namer.\n\n“To bring Lebannen here,” said the Herbal. “The young men talk of “the true\ncrown”. A second coronation, here. By the Archmage Thorion.”\n\n“Avert!” Irian blurted out, making the sign to prevent word from becoming\ndeed. None of the men smiled, and the Herbal belatedly made the same gesture.\n\n“How does he hold them all?” the Namer said. “Herbal, you were here when\nSparrowhawk and Thorion were challenged by Irioth. His gift was as great as\nThorion’s, I think. He used it to use men, to control them wholly. Is that\nwhat Thorion does?”\n\n“I don’t know,” the Herbal said. “I can only tell you that when I’m with him,\nwhen I’m in the Great House, I feel that nothing can be done but what has been\ndone. That nothing will change. Nothing will grow. That no matter what cures I\nuse, the sickness will end in death.” He looked around at them all like a hurt\nox. “And I think it is true. There is no way to regain the Equilibrium but by\nholding still. We have gone too far. For the Archmage and Lebannen to go\nbodily into death, and return - it was not right. They broke a law that must\nnot be broken. It was to restore the law that Thorion returned.”\n\n“What, to send them back into death?” the Namer said, and the Patterner, “Who\nis to say what is the law?”\n\n“There is a wall,” the Herbal said.\n\n“That wall is not as deep-rooted as my trees,” said the Patterner.\n\n“But you’re right, Herbal, we’re out of balance,” said Kurremkarmerruk, his\nvoice hard and harsh. “When and where did we begin to go too far? What have we\nforgotten, turned our back on, overlooked?”\n\nIrian looked from one to the other.\n\n“When the balance is wrong, holding still is not good. It must get more\nwrong,” said the Patterner. “Until -“ He made a quick gesture of reversal with\nhis open hands, down going up and up down.\n\n“What’s more wrong than to summon oneself back from death?” said the Namer.\n\n“Thorion was the best of us all - a brave heart, a noble mind.” The Herbal\nspoke almost in anger. “Sparrowhawk loved him. So did we all.”\n\n“Conscience caught him,” said the Namer. “Conscience told him he alone could\nset things right. To do it, he denied his death. So he denies life.”\n\n“And who shall stand against him?” said the Patterner. “I can only hide in my\nwoods.”\n\n“And I in my tower,” said the Namer. “And you, Herbal, and the Doorkeeper, are\nin the trap, in the Great House. The walls we built to keep all evil out. Or\nin, as the case may be.”\n\n“We are four against him,” said the Patterner.\n\nThey are five against us,” said the Herbal.\n\n“Has it come to this,” the Namer said, “that we stand at the edge of the\nforest Segoy planted and talk of how to destroy one another?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Patterner. “What goes too long unchanged destroys itself. The\nforest is for ever because it dies and dies and so lives. I will not let this\ndead hand touch me. Or touch the king who brought us hope. A promise was made,\nmade through me, I spoke it - “A woman on Gont” -I will not see that word\nforgotten.”\n\n“Then should we go to Gont?” said the Herbal, caught in Azver’s passion.\n“Sparrowhawk is there.”\n\nTenar of the Ring is there,” said Azver.\n\n“Maybe our hope is there,” said the Namer.\n\nThey stood silent, uncertain, trying to cherish hope.\n\nIrian stood silent too, but her hope sank down, replaced by a sense of shame\nand utter insignificance. These were brave, wise men, seeking to save what\nthey loved, but they did not know how to do it. And she had no share in their\nwisdom, no part in their decisions. She drew away from them, and they did not\nnotice. She walked on, going towards the Thwilburn where it ran out of the\nwood over a little fall of boulders. The water was bright in the morning\nsunlight and made a happy noise. She wanted to cry but she had never been good\nat crying. She stood and watched the water, and her shame turned slowly into\nanger.\n\nShe came back towards the three men, and said, “Azver.”\n\nHe turned to her, startled, and came forward a little.\n\n“Why did you break your Rule for me? Was it fair to me, who can never be what\nyou are?”\n\nAzver frowned. “The Doorkeeper admitted you because you asked,” he said. “I\nbrought you to the Grove because the leaves of the trees spoke your name to me\nbefore you ever came here. Irian, they said, Irian. Why you came I don’t know,\nbut not by chance. The Summoner too knows that.”\n\n“Maybe I came to destroy him.”\n\nHe looked at her and said nothing.\n\n“Maybe I came to destroy Roke.”\n\nHis pale eyes blazed then. Try!”\n\nA long shudder went through her as she stood facing him. She felt herself\nlarger than he was, larger than she was, enormously larger. She could reach\nout one finger and destroy him. He stood there in his small, brave, brief\nhumanity, his mortality, defenseless. She drew a long, long breath. She\nstepped back from him.\n\nThe sense of huge strength was draining out of her. She turned her head a\nlittle and looked down, surprised to see her own brown arm, her rolled-up\nsleeve, the grass springing cool and green around her sandaled feet. She\nlooked back at the Patterner and he still seemed a fragile being. She pitied\nand honoured him. She wanted to warn him of the peril he was in. But no words\ncame to her at all. She turned round and went back to the streambank by the\nlittle falls. There she sank down on her haunches and hid her face in her\narms, shutting him out, shutting the world out.\n\nThe voices of the mages talking were like the voices of the stream running.\nThe stream said its words and they said theirs, but none of them were the\nright words.\n\nIV. Irian\n\n  \n\nWhen Azver rejoined the other men there was something in his face that made\nthe Herbal say, “What is it?”\n\n“I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe we should not leave Roke.”\n\n“Probably we can’t,” said the Herbal. “If the Windkey locks the winds against\nus ...”\n\n“I’m going back to where I am,” Kurremkarmerruk said abruptly. “I don’t like\nleaving myself about like an old shoe. I’ll join you this evening.” And he was\ngone.\n\n“I’d like to walk under your trees a bit, Azver,” the Herbal said, with a long\nsigh.\n\n“Go on, Deyala. I’ll stay here.” The Herbal went off. Azver sat down on the\nrough bench Irian had made and put against the front wall of the house. He\nlooked upstream at her, crouching motionless on the bank. Sheep in the field\nbetween them and the Great House blatted softly. The morning sun was getting\nhot.\n\nHis father had named him Banner of War. He had come west, leaving all he knew\nbehind him, and had learned his true name from the trees of the Immanent\nGrove, and become the Patterner of Roke, All this year the patterns of the\nshadows and the branches and the roots, all the silent language of his forest,\nhad spoken of destruction, of transgression, of all things changed. Now it was\nupon them, he knew. It had come with her.\n\nShe was in his charge, in his care, he had known that when he saw her. Though\nshe came to destroy Roke, as she had said, he must serve her. He did so\nwillingly. She had walked with him in the forest, tall, awkward, fearless; she\nhad put aside the thorny arms of brambles with her big, careful hand. Her\neyes, amber brown like the water of the Thwilburn in shadow, had looked at\neverything; she had listened; she had been still. He wanted to protect her and\nknew he could not. He had given her a little warmth when she was cold. He had\nnothing else to give her. Where she must go she would go. She did not\nunderstand danger. She had no wisdom but her innocence, no amour but her\nanger. Who are you, Irian? he said to her, watching her crouched there like an\nanimal locked in its muteness.\n\nHis Herbal came back from the woods and sat down beside him on the bench a\nwhile. In the middle of the day he returned to the Great House, agreeing to\ncome back with the Doorkeeper in the morning. They would ask all the other\nMasters to meet with them in the Grove. “But he won’t come,” Deyala said, and\nAzver nodded.\n\nAll day he stayed near the Otter’s House, keeping watch on Irian, making her\neat a little with him. She came to the house, but when they had eaten she went\nback to her place on the streambank and sat there motionless. And he too felt\na lethargy in his own body and mind, a stupidity, which he fought against but\ncould not shake off. He thought of the Summoner’s eyes, and then it was that\nhe felt cold, cold through, though he was sitting in the full heat of the\nsummer’s day. We are ruled by the dead, he thought. The thought would not\nleave him.\n\nHe was grateful to see Kurremkarmerruk coming slowly down the bank of the\nThwilburn from the north. The old man waded through the stream barefoot,\nholding his shoes in one hand and his tall staff in the other, snarling when\nhe missed his footing on the rocks. He sat down on the near bank to dry his\nfeet and put his shoes back on. “When I go back to the Tower,” he said, “I’ll\nride. Hire a carter, buy a mule. I’m old, Azver.”\n\n“Come up to the house,” the Patterner said, and he set out water and food for\nthe Namer.\n\n“Where’s the girl?”\n\n“Asleep.” Azver nodded towards where she lay, curled up in the grass above the\nlittle falls.\n\nThe heat of the day was beginning to lessen and the shadows of the Grove lay\nacross the grass, though the Otter’s House was still in sunlight.\nKurremkarmerruk sat on the bench with his back against the house wall, and\nAzver on the doorstep.\n\n“We’ve come to the end of it,” the old man said out of silence.\n\nAzver nodded, in silence.\n\n“What brought you here, Azver?” the Namer asked. “I’ve often thought of asking\nyou. A long, long way to come. And you have no wizards in the Kargish lands, I\nthink.”\n\n“No. But we have the things wizardry is made of. Water, stones, trees, words\n...”\n\n“But not the words of the Making.”\n\n“No. Nor dragons,”\n\n“Never?”\n\n“Only in some very, very old tales. Before the gods were. Before men were.\nBefore men were men, they were dragons.”\n\n“Now that is interesting,” said the old scholar, sitting up straighter. “I\ntold you I was reading about dragons. You know there’s been talk of them\nflying over the Inmost Sea as far east as Gont. That was no doubt Kalessin\ntaking Ged home, multiplied by sailors making a good story better. But a boy\nswore to me that his whole village had seen dragons flying, this spring, west\nof Mount Onn. And so I was reading old books, to learn when they ceased to\ncome east of Pendor. And in one I came on your story, or something like it.\nThat men and dragons were all one kind, but they quarrelled. Some went west\nand some east, and they became two kinds, and forgot they were ever one.”\n\n“We went farthest east,” Azver said. “But do you know what the leader of an\narmy is, in my tongue?”\n\n“Edran,” said the Namer promptly, and laughed. “Drake. Dragon...”\n\nAfter a while he said, “I could chase an etymology on the brink of doom ...\nBut I think, Azver, that that’s where we are. We won’t defeat him.”\n\n“He has the advantage,” Azver said, very dry.\n\n“He does. But, admitting it unlikely, admitting it impossible - if we did\ndefeat him - if he went back into death and left us here alive - what would we\ndo? What comes next?”\n\nAfter a long time, Azver said, “I have no idea.”\n\n“Your leaves and shadows tell you nothing?”\n\n“Change, change,” said the Patterner. Transformation.”\n\nHe looked up suddenly. The sheep, who had been grouped near the stile, were\nscurrying off, and someone was coming along the path from the Great House.\n\n“A group of young men,” said the Herbal, breathless, as he came to them.\n“Thorion’s army. Coming here. To take the girl. To send her away.” He stood\nand drew breath. “The Doorkeeper was speaking with them when I left. I think\n-“\n\n“Here he is,” said Azver, and the Doorkeeper was there, his smooth, yellowish-\nbrown face tranquil as ever.\n\n“I told them,” he said, “that if they went out Medra’s Gate this day, they’d\nnever go back through it into a House they knew. Some of them were for turning\nback, then. But the Windkey and the Chanter urged them on. They’ll be along\nsoon.”\n\nThey could hear men’s voices in the fields east of the Grove.\n\nAzver went quickly to where Irian lay beside the stream, and the others\nfollowed him. She roused up and got to her feet, looking dull and dazed. They\nwere standing around her, a kind of guard, when the group of thirty or more\nmen came past the little house and approached them. They were mostly older\nstudents; there were five or six wizard’s staffs among the crowd, and the\nMaster Windkey led them. His thin, keen old face looked strained and weary,\nbut he greeted the four mages courteously by their titles.\n\nThey greeted him, and Azver took the word - “Come into the Grove, Master\nWindkey,” he said, “and we will wait there for the others of the Nine.”\n\n“First we must settle the matter that divides us,” said the Windkey.\n\nThat is a stony matter,” said the Namer.\n\n“The woman with you defies the Rule of Roke,” the Windkey said. “She must\nleave. A boat is waiting at the dock to take her, and the wind, I can tell\nyou, will stand fair for Way.”\n\n“I have no doubt of that, my lord,” said Azver, “but I doubt she will go-“\n\n“My Lord Patterner, will you defy our Rule and our community, that has been\none so long, upholding order against the forces of ruin? Will it be you, of\nall men, who breaks the pattern?”\n\n“It is not glass, to break,” Azver said. “It is breath, it is fire.”\n\nIt cost him a great effort to speak.\n\n“It does not know death,” he said, but he spoke in his own language, and they\ndid not understand him. He drew closer to Irian. He felt the warmth of her\nbody. She stood staring, in that animal silence, as if she did not understand\nany of them.\n\n“Lord Thorion has returned from death to save us all,” the Windkey said,\nfiercely and clearly. “He will be Archmage. Under his rule Roke will be as it\nwas. The king will receive the true crown from his hand, and rule with his\nguidance, as Morred ruled. No witches will defile sacred ground. No dragons\nwill threaten the Inmost Sea. There will be order, safety, and peace.”\n\nNone of the mages answered him. In the silence, the men with him murmured, and\na voice among them said, “Let us have the witch.”\n\n“No,” Azver said, but could say nothing else. He held his staff of willow, but\nit was only wood in his hand.\n\nOf the four of them, only the Doorkeeper moved and spoke. He took a step\nforward, looking from one young man to the next and the next. He said, “You\ntrusted me, giving me your names. Will you trust me now?”\n\n“My lord,” said one of them with a fine, dark face and a wizard’s oaken staff,\n“we do trust you, and therefore ask you to let the witch go, and peace\nreturn.”\n\nIrian stepped forward before the Doorkeeper could answer.\n\n“I am not a witch,” she said. Her voice sounded high, metallic, after the\nmen’s deep voices. “I have no art. No knowledge. I came to learn.”\n\n“We do not teach women here,” said the Windkey. “You know that.”\n\n“I know nothing,” Irian said. She stepped forward again, facing the mage\ndirectly. Tell me who I am.”\n\n“Learn your place, woman,” the mage said with cold passion.\n\n“My place,” she said, slowly, the words dragging, “my place is on the hill.\nWhere things are what they are. Tell the dead man I will meet him there.”\n\nThe Windkey stood silent, but the group of men muttered, angry, and some of\nthem moved forward. Azver came between her and them, her words releasing him\nfrom the paralysis of mind and body that had held him. “Tell Thorion we will\nmeet him on Roke Knoll,” he said. “When he comes, we will be there. Now come\nwith me,” he said to Irian.\n\nThe Namer, the Doorkeeper, and the Herbal followed him with her into the\nGrove. There was a path for them. But when some of the young men started after\nthem, there was no path.\n\n“Come back,” the Windkey said to the men.\n\nThey turned back, uncertain. The low sun was still bright on the fields and\nthe roofs of the Great House, but inside the wood it was all shadows.\n\n“Witchery,” they said, “sacrilege, defilement.”\n\n“Best come away,” said the Master Windkey, his face set and sombre, his keen\neyes troubled. He set off back to the School, and they straggled after him,\narguing and debating in frustration and anger.\n\nThey were not far inside the Grove, and still beside the stream, when Irian\nstopped, turned aside, and crouched down by the enormous, hunching roots of a\nwillow that leaned out over the water. The four mages stood on the path.\n\n“She spoke with the other breath,” Azver said.\n\nThe Namer nodded.\n\n“So we must follow her?” the Herbal asked.\n\nThis time the Doorkeeper nodded. He smiled faintly and said, “So it would\nseem.”\n\n“Very well,” said the Herbal, with his patient, troubled look; and he went\naside a little, and knelt to look at some small plant or fungus on the forest\nfloor.\n\nTime passed as always in the Grove, not passing at all it seemed, yet gone,\nthe day gone quietly by in a few long breaths, a quivering of leaves, a bird\nsinging far off and another answering it from even farther. Irian stood up\nslowly. She did not speak, but looked down the path, and then walked down it.\nThe four men followed her.\n\nThey came out into the calm, open evening air. The west still held some\nbrightness as they crossed the Thwilburn and walked across the fields to Roke\nKnoll, which stood up before them in a high dark curve against the sky.\n\nThey’re coming,” the Doorkeeper said. Men were coming through the gardens and\nup the path from the Great House, all the mages, many of the students. Leading\nthem was Thorion the Summoner, tall in his grey cloak, carrying his tall staff\nof bone-white wood, about which a faint gleam of werelight hovered.\n\nWhere the two paths met and joined to wind up to the heights of the Knoll,\nThorion stopped and stood waiting for them. Irian strode forward to face him.\n\n“Irian of Way,” the Summoner said in his deep, clear voice, “that there may be\npeace and order, and for the sake of the balance of all things, I bid you now\nleave this island. We cannot give you what you ask, and for that we ask your\nforgiveness. But if you seek to stay here you forfeit forgiveness, and must\nlearn what follows on transgression.”\n\nShe stood up, almost as tall as he, and as straight. She said nothing for a\nminute and then spoke out in a high, harsh voice. “Come up on to the hill,\nThorion,” she said.\n\nShe left him standing at the waymeet, on the level ground, and walked up the\nhill path for a little way, a few strides. She turned and looked back down at\nhim. “What keeps you from the hill?” she said.\n\nThe air was darkening around them. The west was only a dull red line, the\neastern sky was shadowy above the sea.\n\nThe Summoner looked up at Irian. Slowly he raised his arms and the white staff\nin the invocation of a spell, speaking in the tongue that all the wizards and\nmages of Roke had learned, the language of their art, the Language of the\nMaking: ‘Irian, by your name I summon you and bind you to obey me!”\n\nShe hesitated, seeming for a moment to yield, to come to him, and then cried\nout, “I am not only Irian!”\n\nAt that the Summoner ran up towards her, reaching out, lunging at her as if to\nseize and hold her. They were both on the hill now. She towered above him\nimpossibly, fire breaking forth between them, a flare of red flame in the dusk\nair, a gleam of red-gold scales, of vast wings - then that was gone, and there\nwas nothing there but the woman standing on the hill path and the tall man\nbowing down before her, bowing slowly down to earth, and lying on it.\n\nOf them all it was the Herbal, the healer, who was the first to move. He went\nup the path and knelt down by Thorion. “My lord,” he said, “my friend.”\n\nUnder the huddle of the grey cloak his hands found only a huddle of clothes\nand dry bones and a broken staff.\n\n“This is better, Thorion,” he said, but he was weeping.\n\nThe old Namer came forward and said to the woman on the hill, “Who are you?”\n\n“I do not know my other name,” she said. She spoke as he had spoken, as she\nhad spoken to the Summoner, in the Language of the Making, the tongue the\ndragons speak.\n\nShe turned away and began to walk on up the hill.\n\n“Irian,” said Azver the Patterner, “will you come back to us?”\n\nShe halted and let him come up to her. “I will, if you call me,” she said.\n\nShe reached out and touched his hand. He drew his breath sharply.\n\n“Where will you go?” he said.\n\n“To those who will give me my name. In fire not water. My people.”\n\n“In the west,” he said.\n\nShe said, “Beyond the west.”\n\nShe turned away from him and them and went on up the hill in the gathering\ndarkness. As she went farther from them they saw her then, all of them, the\ngreat gold-mailed flanks, the spiked, coiling tail, the talons, and the breath\nthat was bright fire. On the crest of the Knoll she paused a while, her long\nhead turning to look slowly round the Isle of Roke, gazing longest at the\nGrove, only a blur of darkness in darkness now. Then with a rattle like the\nshaking of sheets of brass the wide, vaned wings opened and the dragon sprang\nup into the air, circled Roke Knoll once, and flew.\n\nA curl of fire, a wisp of smoke drifted down through the dark air.\n\nAzver the Patterner stood with his left hand holding his right hand, which her\ntouch had burnt. He looked down at the men who stood silent at the foot of the\nhill, staring after the dragon. “Well, my friends,” he said, “what now?”\n\nOnly the Doorkeeper answered. He said, “I think we should go to our House, and\nopen its doors.”\n\nA Description of Earthsea\n\n  \n\nPEOPLES AND LANGUAGES\n\nPEOPLE\n\nTHE HARDIC LANDS\n\nThe Hardic people of the Archipelago live by farming, herding, fishing,\ntrading, and the usual crafts and arts of a nonindustrial society. Their\npopulation is stable and has never overcrowded the limited habitable land\navailable to them. Famine is unknown and poverty seldom acute.\n\nSmall islands and villages are generally governed by a more or less democratic\ncouncil or Parley, headed, or represented in dealings with other groups, by an\nelected Isleman or Islewoman, In the Reaches there is often no government\nother than the Isle Parley and the Town Parleys. In the Inner Lands, a\ngoverning caste was established early, and most of the great islands and\ncities are ruled at least nominally by hereditary lords and ladies, while the\nArchipelago entire was governed for centuries by kings. Towns and cities are,\nhowever, frequently almost entirely self-governed by their Parley and merchant\nand trade guilds.\n\nThe great guilds, since their network covers all the Inner Lands, answer to no\noverlord or authority except the King in Havnor.\n\nForms of fiefdom, vassalage, and slavery have existed at times in some areas,\nbut not under the rule of the Havnorian Kings.\n\nThe existence of magic as a recognized, effective power wielded by certain\nindividuals, but not by all, shapes and influences all the institutions of the\nHardic peoples, so that, much as ordinary life in the Archipelago seems to\nresemble that of nonindustrial peoples elsewhere, there are almost\nimmeasurable differences. One of these differences may be, or may be indicated\nby, the lack of any kind of institutionalised religion. Superstition is as\ncommon as it is anywhere, but there are no gods, no cults, no formal worship\nof any kind. Ritual occurs only in traditional offerings at the sites of the\nOld Powers, in the great, universally celebrated annual festivals such as\nSunreturn and the Long Dance, in the speaking and singing of the traditional\nsongs and epics at these festivals, and, perhaps, in the performance of spells\nof magic.\n\nAll the people of the Archipelago and the Reaches share the Hardic language\nand culture with local variations. The Raft People of the far South West Reach\nretain the great annual celebrations, but little else of Archipelagan culture,\nhaving no commerce, no agriculture, and no knowledge of other peoples.\n\nMost people of the Archipelago have brown or red-brown skin, black straight\nhair, and dark eyes; the predominant body type is short, slender, small-boned,\nbut fairly muscular and well-fleshed. In the East and South Reaches people\ntend to be taller, heavier boned, and darker. Many Southerners have very dark\nbrown skin. Most Archipelagan men have little or no facial hair.\n\nThe people of Osskil, Rogma, and Borth are lighter-skinned than others in the\nArchipelago, and often have brown or even blond hair and light eyes; the men\nare often bearded. Their language and some of their beliefs are closer to\nKargish than to Hardic. These far Northerners probably descend from Kargs who,\nafter settling the four great Eastern lands, sailed back to the West about two\nthousand years ago.\n\nTHE KARGAD LANDS\n\nIn these four great islands to the northeast of the main Archipelago, the\npredominant skin color is light brown to white, with hair dark to fair, and\neyes dark to blue or grey.\n\nNot much mixing of the Kargish and Archipelagan skin-color types has taken\nplace except on Osskil, since the North Reach is isolated and thinly\npopulated, and the Kargad people have held themselves apart from and often in\nenmity towards the Archipelagans for two or three millennia.\n\nThe four Kargad islands are mostly arid in climate but fertile when watered\nand cultivated. The Kargs have maintained a society that appears to be little\ninfluenced, except negatively, by their far more numerous neighbors to the\nsouth and west.\n\nAmong the Kargs the power of magic appears to be very rare as a native gift,\nperhaps because it was neglected or actively suppressed by their society and\ngovernment. Except as an evil to be dreaded and shunned, magic plays no\nrecognized part in their society. This inability or refusal to practice magic\nputs the Kargs at a disadvantage with the Archipelagans in almost every\nrespect, which may explain why they have generally held themselves aloof from\ntrade or any kind of interchange, other than piratical raids and invasions of\nthe nearer islands of the South Reach and around the Gontish Sea.\n\nDRAGONS\n\nSongs and stories indicate that dragons existed before any other living\ncreature. The Old Hardic kennings or euphemisms for the word dragon are\nFirstborn, Eldest, Elder Children. (The words for the firstborn child of a\nfamily in Osskilian, akhad, and in Kargish, gadda, are derived from the word\nhaath, “dragon,” in the Old Speech.)\n\nScattered references and tales from Gont and the Reaches, passages of sacred\nhistory in the Kargad Lands and of arcane mystery in the Lore of Paln, long\nignored by the scholars of Roke, relate that in the earliest days dragons and\nhuman beings were all one kind. Eventually these dragon-people separated into\ntwo kinds of being, incompatible in their habits and desires. Perhaps a long\ngeographical separation caused a gradual natural divergence, a differentiation\nof species. The Pelnish Lore and the Kargish legends maintain that the\nseparation was deliberate, made by an agreement known as verw nadan, Vedurnan,\nthe Division.\n\nThese legends are best preserved in Hur-at-Hur, the easternmost of the Kargad\nLands, where dragons have degenerated into animals without high intelligence.\nYet it is in Hur-at-Hur that people keep the most vivid conviction of the\noriginal kinship of human and dragon kind. And with these tales of ancient\ntimes come stories of recent days about dragons who take human form, humans\nwho take dragon form, beings who are in fact both human and dragon.\n\nHowever the Division came about, from the beginning of historical time human\nbeings have lived in the main Archipelago and the Kargad Lands east of it,\nwhile the dragons kept to the westernmost isles-and beyond. People have\npuzzled at their choosing the empty sea for their domain, since dragons are\n“creatures of wind and fire,” who drown if plunged under the sea. But they\nhave no need to touch down either on water or on earth; they live on the wing,\naloft in air, sunlight, starlight. The only use a dragon has for the ground is\nsome kind of rocky place where it can lay its eggs and rear the drakelets. The\nsmall, barren islets of the farthest West Reach suffice for this.\n\nThe Creation of Ea contains no clear references to an original unity and\neventual separation of dragons and humans, but this may be because the poem in\nits presumed original form, in the Language of the Making, dated back to a\ntime before the separation. The best evidence in the poem for the common\norigin of dragons and humans is the archaic Hardic word in it that is commonly\nunderstood as “people” or “human beings,” alath. This word is by etymology\n(from the True Runes Atl and Htha) “word-beings,” “those who say words,” and\ntherefore could mean, or include, dragons. Sometimes the word used is\nalherath, “true-word-beings,” “those who say true words,” speakers of the True\nSpeech. This could mean human wizards, or dragons, or both. In the arcane Lore\nof Paln, it is said, that word is used to mean both wizard and dragon.\n\nDragons are born knowing the True Speech, or, as Ged put it, “the dragon and\nthe speech of the dragon are one.” If human beings originally shared that\ninnate knowledge or identity, they lost it as they lost their dragon nature.\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nThe Old Speech, or Language of the Making, with which Segoy created the\nislands of Earthsea at the beginning of time, is presumably an infinite\nlanguage, as it names all things.\n\nThis language is innate to dragons, not to humans, as said above. There are\nexceptions. A few human beings with a powerful gift of magic, or through the\nancient kinship of humans and dragons, know some words of the Old Speech\ninnately. But the very great majority of people must learn the Old Speech.\nHardic practitioners of the art magic learn it from their teachers. Sorcerers\nand witches learn a few words of it; wizards learn many, and some come to\nspeak it almost as fluently as the dragons do.\n\nAll spells use at least a word of the Old Speech, though the village witch or\nsorcerer may not clearly know its meaning. Great spells are made wholly in the\nOld Speech, and are understood as they are spoken.\n\nThe Hardic language of the Archipelago, the Osskili tongue of Osskil, and the\nKargish tongue, are all remote descendants of the Old Speech. None of these\nlanguages serves for the making of spells of magic.\n\nThe people of the Archipelago speak Hardic. There are as many dialects as\nthere are islands, but none so extreme as to be wholly unintelligible to the\nothers.\n\nOsskili, spoken in Osskil and two islands northwest of it, has more affinities\nto Kargish than to Hardic. Kargish has diverged most widely in vocabulary and\nsyntax from the Old Speech. Most of its speakers (like most Hardic speakers)\ndo not realise that their languages have a common ancestry. Archipelagan\nscholars are aware of it, but most Kargs would deny it, since they have\nconfused Hardic with the Old Speech, in which spells are cast, and thus fear\nand despise all Archipelagan speech as malevolent sorcery.\n\nWRITING\n\nWriting is said to have been invented by the Rune Masters, the first great\nwizards of the Archipelago, perhaps to aid in retaining the Old Speech. The\ndragons have no writing.\n\nThere are two entirely different kinds of writing in Earthsea: the True Runes\nand runic writing.\n\nThe True Runes used in the Archipelago embody words of the Speech of the\nMaking. True Runes are not symbols only, but reifactors: they can be used to\nbring a thing or condition into being or bring about an event. To write such a\nrune is to act. The power of the action varies with the circumstances. Most of\nthe True Runes are found only in ancient texts and lore-books, and used only\nby wizards trained in their use; but a good many of them, such as the symbol\nwritten on the door lintel to protect a house from fire, are in common use,\nfamiliar to unlearned people.\n\nLong after the invention of the True Runes, a related but nonmagical runic\nwriting was developed for the Hardic language. This writing does not affect\nreality any more than any writing does; that is to say, indirectly, but\nconsiderably.\n\nIt is said that Segoy first wrote the True Runes in fire on the wind, so that\nthey are coeval with the Language of the Making. But this may not be so, since\nthe dragons do not use them, and if they recognise them, do not admit it.\n\nEach True Rune has a significance, a connotation or area of meaning, which can\nbe more or less defined in Hardic; but it is better to say that the runes are\nnot words at all, but spells, or acts. Only in the syntax of the Old Speech,\nhowever, and only as spoken or written by a wizard, not as a statement but\nwith intention to act, reinforced by voice and gesture-in a spell-does the\nword or the rune fully release its power.\n\nIf written down, spells are written in the True Runes, sometimes with some\nadmixture of the Hardic runes. To write in the True Runes, as to speak the Old\nSpeech, is to guarantee the truth of what one says-if one is human. Human\nbeings cannot lie in that language. Dragons can; or so the dragons say; and if\nthey are lying, does that not prove that what they say is true?\n\nThe spoken name of a True Rune may be the word it signifies in the Old Speech,\nor it may be one of the connotations of the rune translated into Hardic. The\nnames of commonly used runes such as Pirr (used to protect from fire, wind,\nand madness), Sifl (“speed well”), Simn (“work well”) are used without\nceremony by ordinary people speaking Hardic; but practitioners of magic speak\neven such well-known, often used names with caution, since they are in fact\nwords in the Old Speech, and may influence events in unintended or unexpected\nways.\n\nThe so-called Six Hundred Runes of Hardic are not the Hardic runes used to\nwrite the ordinary language. They are True Runes that have been given “safe,”\ninactive names in the ordinary language. Their true names in the Old Speech\nmust be memorised in silence. The ambitious student of wizardry will go on to\nlearn the “Further Runes,” the “Runes of Ea,” and many others. If the Old\nSpeech is endless, so are the runes.\n\nOrdinary Hardic, for matters of government or business or personal messages or\nto record history, tales, and songs, is written in the characters properly\ncalled Hardic runes. Most Archipelagans learn a few hundred to several\nthousand of these characters as a major part of their few years of schooling.\nSpoken or written, Hardic is useless for casting spells.\n\nLITERATURE AND THE\n\nSOURCES OF HISTORY\n\nA millennium and a half ago or more, the runes of Hardic were developed so as\nto permit narrative writing. From that time on, The Creation of Ea, The Winter\nCarol, the Deeds, the Lays, and the Songs, all of which began as sung or\nspoken texts, were written down and preserved as texts. They continue to exist\nin both forms. The many written copies of the ancient texts serve to keep them\nfrom varying widely or from being lost altogether; but the songs and histories\nthat are part of every child’s education are taught and learned aloud, passed\non down the years from living voice to living voice.\n\nOld Hardic differs in vocabulary and pronunciation from the current speech,\nbut the rote learning and regular speaking and hearing of the classics keeps\nthe archaic language meaningful (and probably puts some brake on linguistic\ndrift in daily speech), while the Hardic runes, like Chinese characters, can\naccommodate widely varying pronunciations and shifts of meaning.\n\nDeeds, lays, songs, and popular ballads are still composed as oral\nperformances, mostly by professional singers. New works of any general\ninterest are soon written down as broadsheets or put in compilations.\n\nWhether performed or read silently, all such poems and songs are consciously\nvalued for their content, not for their literary qualities, which range from\nhigh to nil. Loose regular meter, alliteration, stylised phrasing, and\nstructuring by repetition are the principal poetic devices. Content includes\nmythic, epic, and historical narrative, geographical descriptions, practical\nobservations concerning nature, agriculture, sea lore, and crafts, cautionary\ntales and parables, philosophical, visionary, and spiritual poetry, and love\nsongs. The deeds and lays are usually chanted, the ballads sung, often with a\npercussion accompaniment; professional chanters and singers may sing with the\nharp, the viol, drums, and other instruments. The songs generally have less\nnarrative content, and many are valued and preserved mostly for the tune.\n\nBooks of history and the records and recipes for magic exist only in written\nform-the latter usually in a mixture of Hardic runic writing and True Runes.\nOf a lore-book (a compilation of spells made and annotated by a wizard, or by\na lineage of wizards) there is usually one copy only.\n\nIt is often a matter of considerable importance that the words of these lore-\nbooks not be spoken aloud.\n\nThe Osskili use the Hardic runes to write their language, since they trade\nmostly with Hardic-speaking lands.\n\nThe Kargs are deeply resistant to writing of any kind, considering it to be\nsorcerous and wicked. They keep complex accounts and records in weavings of\ndifferent colors and weights of yarn, and are expert mathematicians, using\nbase twelve; but only since the Godkings came to power have they employed any\nkind of symbolic writing, and that sparingly. Bureaucrats and tradesmen of the\nEmpire adapted the Hardic runes to Kargish, with some simplifications and\nadditions, for purposes of business and diplomacy. But Kargish priests never\nlearn writing; and many Kargs still write every Hardic rune with a light\nstroke through it, to cancel out the sorcery that lurks in it.\n\nHistory\n\nNote on dates: Many islands have their own local count of years. The most\nwidely used dating system in the Archipelago, which stems from the Havnorian\nTale, makes the year Morred took the throne the first year of history. By this\nsystem, “present time” in the account you are reading is the Archipelagan year\n1058.\n\nTHE BEGINNINGS\n\nAll we know of ancient times in Earthsea is to be found in poems and songs,\npassed down orally for centuries before they were ever written. The Creation\nof Ea, the oldest and most sacred poem, is at least two thousand years old in\nthe Hardic language; its original version may have existed millennia before\nthat. Its thirty-one stanzas tell how Segoy raised the islands of Earthsea in\nthe beginning of time and made all beings by naming them in the Language of\nthe Making-the language in which the poem was first spoken.\n\nThe ocean, however, is older than the islands; so say the songs.\n\nBefore bright Ea was, before Segoy\n\nbade the islands be,\n\nthe wind of dawn blew on the sea...\n\n  \n\nAnd the Old Powers of the Earth, which are manifest at Roke Knoll, the\nImmanent Grove, the Tombs of Atuan, the Terrenon, the Lips of Paor, and many\nother places, may be coeval with the world itself.\n\nIt may be that Segoy is or was one of the Old Powers of the Earth. It may be\nthat Segoy is a name for the Earth itself. Some think all dragons, or certain\ndragons, or certain people, are manifestations of Segoy. All that is certain\nis that the name Segoy is an ancient respectful nominative formed from the Old\nHardic verb seoge, “make, shape, come intentionally to be.” From the same root\ncomes the noun esege, “creative force, breath, poetry.”\n\nThe Creation of Ea is the foundation of education in the Archipelago, By the\nage of six or seven, all children have heard the poem and most have begun to\nmemorise it. An adult who doesn’t know it by heart, so as to be able to speak\nor sing it with others and teach it to children, is considered grossly\nignorant. It is taught in winter and spring, and spoken and sung entire every\nyear at the Long Dance, the celebration of the solstice of summer.\n\nA quotation from it stands at the head of A Wizard of Earthsea:\n\nOnly in silence the word,\n\nonly in dark the light,\n\nonly in dying life:\n\nbright the hawk’s flight\n\non the empty sky.\n\n  \n\nThe beginning of the first stanza is quoted in Tehanu:\n\nThe making from the unmaking,\n\nthe ending from the beginning,\n\nwho shall know surely?\n\nWhat we know is the doorway between them\n\nthat we enter departing.\n\nAmong all beings ever returning,\n\nthe eldest, the Doorkeeper, Segoy...\n\n  \n\nand the last line of the first stanza:\n\nThen from the foam bright Ea broke.\n\nHISTORY OF THE ARCHIPELAGO\n\nTHE KINGS OF ENLAD\n\nThe two earliest surviving epic or historical texts are The Deed of Enlad, and\nThe Song of the Young King or The Deed of Morred.\n\nThe Deed of Enlad, a good deal of which appears to be purely mythical,\nconcerns the kings before Morred, and Morred’s first year on the throne. The\ncapital city of these rulers was Berila, on the island of Enlad.\n\nThe early kings and queens of Enlad, among whose names are Lar Ashal, Dohun,\nEnashen, Timan, and Tagtar, gradually increased their sway till they\nproclaimed themselves rulers of Earthsea. Their reign extended no farther\nsouth than Ilien and did not include Felkway in the east, Paln and Semel in\nthe west, or Osskil in the north, but they did send explorers out all over the\nInmost Sea and into the Reaches. The most ancient maps of Earthsea, now in the\narchives of the palace in Havnor, were drawn in Berila about twelve hundred\nyears ago.\n\nThese kings and queens had some knowledge of the Old Speech and of magery.\nSome of them were certainly wizards, or had wizards to advise or help them.\nBut magic in The Deed of Enlad is an erratic force, not to be relied on.\nMorred was the first man, and the first king, to be called Mage.\n\nMORRED\n\nThe Song of the Young King, sung annually at Sunreturn, the festival of the\nwinter solstice, tells the story of Morred, called the Mage-King, the White\nEnchanter, and the Young King. Morred came of a collateral line of the House\nof Enlad, inheriting the throne from a cousin; his forebears were wizards,\nadvisers to the kings.\n\nThe poem begins with the best known and most cherished love story in the\nArchipelago, that of Morred and Elfarran. In the third year of his reign, the\nyoung king went south to the largest island of the Archipelago, Havnor, to\nsettle disputes among the city-states there. Returning in his “oarless\nlongship,” he came to the island Solea and there saw Elfarran, the Islewoman\nor Lady of Solea, “in the orchards in the spring.” He did not continue on to\nEnlad, but stayed with Elfarran. To pledge his troth he gave her a silver\nbracelet or arm ring, the treasure of his family, on which was engraved a\nunique and powerful True Rune.\n\nMorred and Elfarran married, and the poem describes their reign as a brief\ngolden age, the foundation and touchstone of ethic and governance thereafter.\n\nBefore their marriage, a mage or wizard, whose name is never given except as\nthe Enemy of Morred or the Wandlord, had paid court to Elfarran. Unforgiving\nand determined to possess her, in the few years of peace that followed the\nmarriage this man developed immense power of magery. After five years he came\nforth and announced, in the words of the poem,\n\nIf Elfarran be not my own, I will unsay Segoy’s word,\n\nI will unmake the islands, the white waves will whelm all.\n\n  \n\nHe had power to raise huge waves on the sea, and to stop the tide or bring it\nearly; and his voice could enchant whole populations, bringing all who heard\nhim under his control. So he turned Morred’s people against him. Crying out\nthat their king had betrayed them, the villagers of Enlad destroyed their own\ncities and fields; sailors sank their ships; and his soldiers, obeying the\nEnemy’s spells, fought one another in bloody and ruinous battles.\n\nWhile Morred sought to free his people from these spells and to confront his\nenemy, Elfarran returned with their year-old child to her native island,\nSolea, where her own powers would he strongest. But there the Enemy followed\nher, intent to make her his prisoner and slave. She took refuge at the Springs\nof Ensa, where, with her knowledge of the Old Powers of the place, she could\nwithstand the Enemy and force him off the island. “The sweet waters of the\nearth drove back the salt destroyer,” says the poem. But as he fled, he\ncaptured her brother Salan, who was sailing from Enlad to help her. Making\nSalan his gebbeth or instrument, the Enemy sent him to Morred with the message\nthat Elfarran had escaped with the baby to an islet in the Jaws of Enlad.\n\nTrusting the messenger, Morred entered the trap. He barely escaped with his\nlife. The Enemy pursued him from the east to the west of Enlad in a trail of\nruin. On the Plains of Enlad, meeting the companions who had stayed loyal to\nhim, most of them sailors who had brought their ships to Enlad to aid him,\nMorred turned and gave battle. The Enemy would not confront him directly, but\nsent Morred’s own spell-bound warriors to fight him, and worse, sent sorceries\nthat shriveled up the bodies of his men till they “living, seemed the black\nthirst-dead of the desert.” To spare his people, Morred withdrew.\n\nAs he left the battlefield it began to rain, and he saw his enemy’s true name\nwritten in raindrops in the dust.\n\nKnowing the Enemy’s name, he was able to counter his enchantments and drive\nhim from Enlad, pursuing him across the winter sea, “riding the west wind, the\nrain wind, the heavy cloud.” Each had met his match, and in their final\nconfrontation, somewhere in the Sea of Ea, both perished.\n\nIn the rage of his agony the Enemy raised up a great wave and sent it speeding\nto overwhelm the island of Solea. Elfarran knew this, as she knew the moment\nof Morred’s death. She bade her people take to their boats; then, the poem\nsays, “She took her small harp in her hands,” and in the hour of waiting for\nthe destroying wave that only Morred might have stilled, she made the song\ncalled The Lament for the White Enchanter. The island was drowned beneath the\nsea, and Elfarran with it. But her boat-cradle of willow wood, floating free,\nbore their child Serriadh to safety, wearing Morred’s pledge, the ring that\nbore the Rune of Peace.\n\nOn maps of the Archipelago, the island Solea is signified by a white space or\na whirlpool.\n\nAfter Morred, seven more kings and queens ruled from Enlad, and the realm\nincreased steadily in size and prosperity.\n\nTHE KINGS OF HAVNOR\n\nA century and a half after Morred’s death, King Akambar, a prince of Shelieth\non Way, moved the court to Havnor and made Havnor Great Port the capital of\nthe kingdom. More central than Enlad, Havnor was better placed for trade and\nfor sending out fleets to protect the Hardic islands against Kargish raids and\nforays.\n\nThe history of the Fourteen Kings of Havnor (actually six kings and eight\nqueens, ~150-400) is told in the Havnorian Lay. Tracing descent both through\nthe male and the female lines, and intermarrying with various noble houses of\nthe Archipelago, the royal house embraced five principalities: the House of\nEnlad, the oldest, tracing direct descent from Morred and Serriadh; the Houses\nof Shelieth, Ea, and Havnor; and lastly the House of Ilien. Prince Gemal\nSeaborn of Ilien was the first of his house to take the throne in Havnor. His\ngranddaughter was Queen Heru; her son, Maharion (reigned 430-452), was the\nlast king before the Dark Time.\n\nThe Years of the Kings of Havnor were a period of prosperity, discovery, and\nstrength, but in the last century of the period, assaults from the Kargs in\nthe east and the dragons in the west became frequent and fierce.\n\nKings, lords, and Islemen charged with defending the islands of the\nArchipelago came to rely increasingly on wizards to fend off dragons and\nKargish fleets. In the Havnorian Lay and The Deed of the Dragonlords, as the\ntale goes on, the names and exploits of these wizards begin to eclipse those\nof the kings.\n\nThe great scholar-mage Ath compiled a lore-book that brought together much\nscattered knowledge, particularly of the words of the Language of the Making.\nHis Book of Names became the foundation of naming as a systematic part of the\nart magic. Ath left his book with a fellow mage on Pody when he went into the\nwest, sent by the king to defeat or drive back a brood of dragons who had been\nstampeding cattle, setting fires, and destroying farms all through the western\nisles. Somewhere west of Ensmer, Ath confronted the great dragon Orm. Accounts\nof this meeting vary; but though after it the dragons ceased their hostilities\nfor a while, it is certain that Orm survived it, and Ath did not. His book,\nlost for centuries, is now in the Isolate Tower on Roke.\n\nThe food of dragons is said to be light, or fire; they kill in rage, to defend\ntheir young, or for sport, but never eat their kill. Since time immemorial,\nuntil the reign of Heru, they had used only the outmost isles of the West\nReach-which may have been the easternmost borders of their own realm-for\nmeeting and breeding, and had seldom even been seen by most of the islanders.\nNaturally irritable and arrogant, the dragons may have felt threatened by the\nincreasing population and prosperity of the Inner Lands, which brought\nconstant boat traffic even out in the West Reach. For whatever the reason, in\nthose years they made increasing raids, sudden and random, on flocks and herds\nand villagers of the lonely western isles.\n\nA tale of the Vedurnan or Division, known in Hur-at-Hur, says:\n\nMen chose the yoke,\n\ndragons the wing.\n\nMen to own,\n\ndragons no thing.\n\n  \n\nThat is, human beings chose to have possessions and dragons chose not to. But,\nas there are ascetics among humans, some dragons are greedy for shining\nthings, gold, jewels; one was Yevaud, who sometimes came among people in human\nform, and who made the rich Isle of Pendor into a dragon nursery, until driven\nback into the west by Ged. But the marauding dragons of the Lay and the songs\nseem to have been moved not so much by greed as by anger, a sense of having\nbeen cheated, betrayed.\n\nThe deeds and lays that tell of raids by dragons and counterforays by wizards\nportray the dragons as pitiless as any wild animal, terrifying, unpredictable,\nyet intelligent, sometimes wiser than the wizards. Though they speak the True\nSpeech, they are endlessly devious. Some of them clearly enjoy battles of wits\nwith wizards, “splitting arguments with a forked tongue.” Like human beings,\nall but the greatest of them conceal their true names. In the lay Hasa’s\nVoyage, the dragons appear as formidable but feeling beings, whose anger at\nthe invading human fleet is justified by their love of their own desolate\ndomain. They address the hero:\n\nSail home to the houses of the sunrise, Hasa.\n\nLeave to our wings the long winds of the west,\n\nleave us the air-sea, the unknown, the utmost...\n\n  \n\nMAHARION AND ERRETH-AKBE\n\nQueen Heru, called the Eagle, inherited the throne from her father, Denggemal\nof the House of Ilien. Her consort Aiman was of the House of Morred. When she\nhad ruled thirty years she gave the crown to their son Maharion.\n\nMaharion’s mage-counselor and inseparable friend was a commoner and\n“fatherless man,” a village witch’s son from inland Havnor. The most beloved\nhero of the Archipelago, his story is told in The Deed of Erreth-Akbe, which\nbards sing at the Long Dance of midsummer.\n\nErreth-Akbe’s gifts in magic became apparent when he was still a boy. He was\nsent to the court to be trained by the wizards there, and the Queen chose him\nas a companion for her son.\n\nMaharion and Erreth-Akbe became “hearts brothers.” They spent ten years\ntogether fighting the Kargs, whose occasional forays from the East had in\nrecent times become a slave-taking, colonising invasion. Venway, Torheven and\nthe Torikles, Spevy, Perregal, and parts of Gont were under Kargish dominion\nfor a generation or longer. At Shelieth on Way, Erreth-Akbe worked a great\nmagic against the Kargish forces, who had landed in “a thousand ships” on\nWaymarsh and were swarming across the mainland. Using an invocation of the Old\nPowers called the Waterlore (perhaps the same that Elfarran had used on Solea\nagainst the Enemy), he turned the waters of the Fountains of Shelieth-sacred\nsprings and pools in the gardens of the Lords of Way-into a flood that swept\nthe invaders back to the seacoast, where Maharion’s army awaited them. No ship\nof the fleet returned to Karego-At.\n\nErreth-Akbe’s next challenger was a mage called the Firelord, whose power was\nso great that he lengthened a day by five hours, though he could not, as he\nhad sworn to do, stop the sun at noon and banish darkness from the islands\nforever. The Firelord took dragon form to fight Erreth-Akbe, but was defeated\nat last, at the cost of the forests and cities of Ilien, which he set afire as\nhe fought.\n\nIt may be that the Firelord was, in fact, a dragon in human form; for very\nsoon after his fall, Orm, the Great Dragon, who had defeated Ath, led hosts of\nhis kind to harry the western islands of the Archipelago-perhaps to avenge the\nFirelord. These fiery flights caused great terror, and hundreds of boats\ncarried people fleeing from Paln and Semel to the Inner Islands; but the\ndragons were not doing as much damage as the Kargs, and Maharion judged the\nurgent danger lay in the east. While he himself went west to fight dragons, he\nsent Erreth-Akbe east to try to establish peace with the King of the Kargad\nLands.\n\nHeru, the Queen Mother, gave the emissary the arm ring Morred gave Elfarran;\nher consort Aimal had given it to her when they married. It had come down\nthrough the generations of the descendants of Serriadh, and was their most\nprecious possession. On it was carved a figure written nowhere else, the Bond\nRune or Rune of Peace, believed to be a guarantee of peaceful and righteous\nrule. “Let the Kargish king wear Morred’s ring,” the Queen Mother said. So,\nbringing it as the most generous of gifts and in pledge of peaceful intent,\nErreth-Akbe went alone to the City of the Kings on Karego-At.\n\nThere he was well received by King Thoreg, who, after the shattering loss of\nhis fleet, was ready to call a truce and withdraw from the occupied Hardic\nislands if Maharion would seek no reprisal.\n\nThe Kargish kingship, however, was already being manipulated by the high\npriests of the Twin Gods. Thoreg’s high priest, Intathin, opposing any truce\nor settlement, challenged Erreth-Akbe to a duel in magic. Since the Kargs did\nnot practice wizardry as the Hardic peoples understood it, Intathin must have\ninveigled Erreth-Akbe into a place where the Old Powers of the earth would\nnullify his powers. The Hardic Deed of Erreth-Akbe speaks only of the hero and\nthe high priest “wrestling,” until:\n\nthe weakness of the old darkness came into Erreth-Akbe’s limbs,\n\nthe silence of the mother darkness into his mind.\n\nLong he lay, forgetful of bright fame and brotherhood,\n\nlong, and on his breast lay the rune-ring broken.\n\n  \n\nThe daughter of “the wise king Thoreg” rescued Erreth-Akbe from this trance or\nimprisoning spell and restored him his strength. He gave her the half of the\nRing of Peace that remained to him. (From her it passed through her\ndescendants for over five hundred years to the last heirs of Thoreg, a brother\nand sister exiled on a deserted island of the East Reach; and the sister gave\nit to Ged.) Intathin kept the other half of the broken Ring, and it “went into\nthe dark”-that is, into the Great Treasury of the Tombs of Atuan. (There Ged\nfound it, and rejoining the two halves and with them the lost Rune of Peace,\nhe and Tenar brought the Ring home to Havnor.)\n\nThe Kargish version of the story, told as a sacred recital by the priesthood,\nsays that Intathin defeated Erreth-Akbe, who “lost his staff and amulet and\npower” and crept back to Havnor a broken man. But wizards carried no staff in\nthose years, and Erreth-Akbe certainly was an unbroken man and a powerful mage\nwhen he faced the dragon Orm.\n\nKing Maharion sought peace and never found it. While Erreth-Akbe was in\nKarego-At (which may have been a period of years), the depredations of the\ndragons increased. The Inward Isles were troubled by refugees fleeing the\nwestern lands and by interruptions to shipping and trade, since the dragons\nhad taken to setting fire to boats that went west of Hosk, and harried ships\neven in the Inmost Sea. All the wizards and armed men Maharion could command\nwent out to fight the dragons, and he went with them himself four times; but\nswords and arrows were little use against armored, fire-spouting, flying\nenemies. Paln was “a plain of charcoal,” and villages and towns in the west of\nHavnor had been burnt to the ground. The king’s wizards had spell-caught and\nkilled several dragons over the Pelnish Sea, which probably increased the\ndragons’ ire. Just as Erreth-Akbe returned, the Great Dragon Orm flew to the\nCity of Havnor and threatened the towers of the king’s palace with fire.\n\nErreth-Akbe, sailing into the bay “with sails worn transparent by the eastern\nwinds,” could not pause to “embrace his heart’s brother or greet his home.”\nTaking dragon form himself, he flew to battle with Orm over Mount Onn. “Flame\nand fire in the midnight air” could be seen from the palace in Havnor. They\nflew north, Erreth-Akbe in pursuit. Over the sea near Taon, Orm turned again\nand this time wounded the mage so that he had to come down to earth and take\nhis own form. He came, with the dragon now following him, to the Old Island,\nEa, the first land Segoy raised from the sea. On that sacred and powerful\nsoil, he and Orm met. Ceasing their battle, they spoke as equals, agreeing to\nend the enmity of their races.\n\nUnfortunately the king’s wizards, enraged at the attack on the heart of the\nkingdom and heartened by their victory in the Pelnish Sea, had taken the fleet\non into the far West Reach and attacked the islets and rocks where the dragons\nraised their young, killing many broods, “crushing monstrous eggs with iron\nmauls.” Hearing of this, Orm’s dragon anger woke again, and he “leapt for\nHavnor like an arrow of fire.” (Dragons are generally referred to both in\nHardic and Kargish as male, though in fact the gender of all dragons is a\nmatter of conjecture, and in the case of the oldest and greatest ones, a\nmystery.)\n\nErreth-Akbe, half recovered, went after Orm, drove him from Havnor, and\nharried him on “through all the Archipelago and Reaches,” never letting him\ncome to land, but driving him always over the sea, until in a final terrible\nflight they passed the Dragon’s Run and came to the last island of the West\nReach, Selidor. There, on the outer beach, both exhausted, they faced each\nother and fought, “talon and fire and word and sword,” until:\n\ntheir blood ran mingled, making the sand red.\n\nTheir breath ceased. Their bodies by the loud sea\n\nlay entangled. They entered death’s land together.\n\n  \n\nKing Maharion himself, the story says, journeyed to Selidor to “weep by the\nsea.” He retrieved Erreth-Akbe’s sword and set it atop the highest tower of\nhis palace.\n\nAfter the death of Orm the dragons remained a threat in the West, especially\nwhen provoked by dragon hunters, but they withdrew from their encroachments on\npeopled islands and peaceful shipping. Yevaud of Pendor was the only dragon to\nraid the Inward Lands after the time of the Kings. No dragon had been seen\nover the Inmost Sea for many centuries when Kalessin, called the Eldest,\nbrought Ged and Lebannen to Roke Island.\n\nMaharion died a few years after Erreth-Akbe, having seen no peace established,\nand much unrest and dissent within his kingdom. It was widely said that since\nthe Ring of Peace was lost there could be no true king of Earthsea. Mortally\nwounded in battle against the rebel lord Gehis of the Havens, Maharion spoke a\nprophecy: “He shall inherit my throne who has crossed the dark land living and\ncome to the far shores of the day.”\n\nTHE DARK TIME, THE HAND, AND ROKE SCHOOL\n\nAfter Maharion’s death in 452, several claimants contested the throne; none\nprevailed. Within a few years their struggles had destroyed all central\ngovernance. The Archipelago became a battleground of hereditary feudal\nprinces, governments of small islands and city-states, and piratic warlords,\nall trying to increase their wealth and extend or defend their borders. Trade\nand ship traffic dwindled under piracy, cities and towns withdrew inside\ndefensive walls; arts, fisheries, and agriculture suffered from constant raids\nand wars; slavery, which had not existed under the Kings, became common. Magic\nwas the primary weapon in forays and battles. Wizards hired themselves out to\nwarlords or sought power for themselves. Through the irresponsibility of these\nwizards and the perversion of their power, magic itself came into disrepute.\n\nThe dragons offered no threat during this period, and the Kargs had withdrawn\ninto their own internal quarrels, but the disintegration of the society of the\nArchipelago worsened as the years went on. Moral and intellectual continuity\nlay only in the knowledge and teaching of The Creation and the other myths and\nhero-stories, and in the preservation of crafts and skills: among them the art\nmagic used for right ends.\n\nThe Hand, a loose-knit league or community concerned principally with the\nunderstanding and the ethical use and teaching of magic, was established by\nmen and women on Roke Island about a hundred and fifty years after Maharion’s\ndeath. Perceiving the Hand as a threat to their hegemony, the mage-warlords of\nWathort raided Roke, and killed almost all the grown men of the island. But\nthe Hand had already stretched out to other islands all around the Inmost Sea.\nAs the Women of the Hand, the community survived for centuries, maintaining a\ntenuous but vigorous network of information, communication, protection, and\nteaching.\n\nIn about 650, the sisters Elehal and Yahan of Roke, Medra the Finder, and\nother people of the Hand founded a school on Roke as a center where they might\ngather and share knowledge, clarify the disciplines, and exert ethical control\nover the practices of wizardry. With the Hand as its agent on other islands,\nthe school’s reputation and influence grew rapidly. The mage Teriel of Havnor,\nperceiving the school as a threat to the uncontrolled individual power of the\nmages, came with a great fleet to destroy it. He was destroyed, and his fleet\nscattered.\n\nThis first victory went far to establish a reputation of invulnerability for\nthe school on Roke.\n\nUnder Roke’s steadily growing influence, wizardry was shaped into a coherent\nbody of knowledge, its use increasingly controlled by moral and political\npurpose. Wizards trained at the school went to other islands of the\nArchipelago to work against warlords, pirates, and feuding nobles, preventing\nraids and forays, imposing penalties and settlements, enforcing boundaries,\nand protecting individuals, farms, towns, cities, and shipping, until social\norder was re-established. In the early years they were sent to enforce peace;\nincreasingly they were called on to maintain it. While the throne in Havnor\nremained empty, for over two hundred years Roke School served effectively as\nthe central government of the Archipelago.\n\nThe power of the Archmage of Roke was in many respects that of a king.\nAmbition, arrogance, and prejudice certainly influenced Halkel, the first\nArchmage, in creating his own authoritative title. Yet, restrained by the\nconsistent teaching and practice of the school and the watchfulness of his\ncolleagues, no subsequent archmage seriously misused his power to weaken\nothers or aggrandize himself.\n\nThe evil reputation magic had gained during the Dark Time, however, continued\nto cling to many of the practices of sorcerers and witches. Women’s powers\nwere particularly distrusted and maligned, the more so as they were conflated\nwith the Old Powers.\n\nThroughout Earthsea, various springs, caves, hills, stones, and woods were and\nalways had been sites of concentrated power and sacredness. All were locally\nfeared or venerated; some were known far and wide.\n\nKnowledge of these places and powers was the heart of religion in the Kargad\nRealm. In the Archipelago, the lore of the Old Powers was still part of the\nprofound, common basis of thought and reverence. On all the islands, the arts\nmostly practiced by witches, such as midwifery, healing, animal husbandry,\ndousing, mining and metallurgy, planting and growing spells, love spells, and\nso on, often invoked or drew upon the Old Powers. But the learned wizards of\nRoke had generally come to distrust the ancient practices and made no appeal\nto the “Powers of the Mother.” Only in Paln did wizards combine the two\npractices, in the arcane, esoteric, and reputedly dangerous Pelnish Lore.\n\nThough like any power they could be perverted to evil use in the service of\nambition (as was the Terrenon Stone in Osskil), the Old Powers were inherently\nsacral and pre-ethical. During and after the Dark Time, however, they were\nfeminised and demonised in the Hardic lands by wizards, as they were in the\nKargad Lands by the cults of the Priestkings and the Godkings. So by the\neighth century, in the Inner Lands of the Archipelago, only village women kept\nup rituals and offerings at the old sites. They were despised or abused for\ndoing so. Wizards kept clear of such places. On Roke, itself the center of the\nOld Powers in all Earthsea, the profoundest manifestations of those powers-\nRoke Knoll and the Immanent Grove-were never spoken of as such. Only the\nPatterners, who lived all their lives in the Grove, served to link human arts\nand acts to the older sacredness of the earth, reminding the wizards and mages\nthat their power was not theirs, but lent to them.\n\nHISTORY OF THE KARGAD LANDS\n\nThe history of the Four Lands is mostly legendary, concerning local struggles\nand accommodations of the tribes, city-states, and small kingdoms that made up\nKargish society for millennia.\n\nSlavery was common to many of these states, and a stricter social caste system\nand gender differentiation (“division of labor”) than in the Archipelago.\n\nReligion was a unifying element even among the most warlike tribes. There were\nhundreds of Truce Places on the Four Lands, where no warfare or dispute was\npermitted. Kargish religion was a domestic and community worship of the Old\nPowers, the chthonic or gaean forces manifest as spirits of place. They were\nworshiped at the site and at home altars with offerings of flowers, oil, food,\ndances, races, sacrifices, carvings, songs, music, and silence. Worship was\nboth casual and ritual, private and communal. There was no priesthood; any\nadult could perform the ceremonies and teach children to do so. This ancient\nspiritual practice has continued, unofficially and sometimes in hiding, under\nthe newer, institutional religions of the Twin Gods and the Godking.\n\nOf innumerable sacred groves, caves, mountains, hills, springs, and stones on\nthe Four Lands, the holiest place was a cavern and standing stones in the\ndesert of Atuan, called the Tombs. It was a center of pilgrimage from the\nearliest recorded times, and the kings of Atuan and later of Hupun maintained\na hostel there for all who came to worship.\n\nSix to seven hundred years ago a sky-god religion began to spread across the\nislands, a development of the worship of the Twin Gods Atwah and Wuluah,\noriginally heroes of a desert saga from Hur-at-Hur. A Sky Father was added as\nhead of the pantheon, and a priestly caste developed to lead the rites.\nWithout suppressing the worship of the Old Powers, the priests of the Twin\nGods and the Sky Father began to professionalise religion, managing the\nrituals and festivals, building increasingly costly temples, and controlling\npublic ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, and the installation of\nofficials.\n\nThe hierarchic and centralising tendency of this religion lent support at\nfirst to the ambition of the Kings of Hupun on Karego-At. By force of arms and\ndiplomatic maneuvering, the House of Hupun within a century or so conquered or\nabsorbed most of the other Kargad kingdoms, of which there had been more than\ntwo hundred.\n\nWhen (in the year 440, by Hardic count) Erreth-Akbe came to make peace between\nthe Archipelago and the Kargad Lands, bearing the Bond Ring as pledge of his\nking’s sincerity, he came to Hupun as the capital of the Kargad Empire and\ntreated with King Thoreg as its ruler.\n\nBut for some decades the kings of Hupun had been in conflict with the high\npriest and his followers in Awabath, the Holy City, fifty miles from Hupun.\nThe priests of the Twin Gods were in the process of wresting power from the\nkings and making Awabath not only the religious but the political center of\nthe country. Erreth-Akbe’s visit seems to have coincided with the final shift\nof power from the kings to the priests. King Thoreg received him with honor,\nbut Intathin the High Priest fought with him, defeated or deceived him, and\nfor a time imprisoned him. The Ring that was to bond the two kingdoms was\nbroken.\n\nAfter this struggle, the line of the Kargish kings continued in Hupun,\nnominally honored but powerless. The Four Lands were governed from Awabath.\nThe high priests of the Twin Gods became Priestkings, In the year 840 of the\nArchipelagan count, one of the two Priest-kings poisoned the other and\ndeclared himself to be the incarnation of the Sky Father, the Godking, to be\nworshiped in the flesh. Worship of the Twin Gods continued, as did the popular\nworship of the Old Powers; but religious and secular power was henceforth in\nthe hands of the Godking, chosen (often with more or less concealed violence)\nand deified by the priests of Awabath. The Four Lands were declared to be the\nEmpire of the Sky and the Godkings official title was All-Emperor.\n\nThe last heirs of the House of Hupun were a boy and girl, Ensar and Anthil.\nWishing to end the line of the Kargish kings but unwilling to risk sacrilege\nby shedding royal blood, the Godking ordered these children to be stranded on\na desert island. Among her clothes and toys the princess Anthil had the half\nof the broken Ring brought by Erreth-Akbe, which had descended to her from\nThoreg’s daughter. As an old woman she gave this to the young wizard Ged,\nshipwrecked on her island. Later, with the help of the high priestess of the\nTombs of Atuan, Arha-Tenar, Ged was able to rejoin the broken halves of the\nRing and so remake the Rune of Peace. He and Tenar brought the healed Ring to\nHavnor, to await the heir of Morred and Serriadh, King Lebannen.\n\nMagic\n\nAmong the Hardic-speaking people of the Archipelago, the ability to do magic\nis an inborn talent, like the gift for music, though far rarer. Most people\nlack it entirely. In a few people, perhaps one in a hundred, it is a latent,\ncultivable talent. In a very few people it is manifest without training.\n\nThe gift for magic is empowered mainly by the use of the True Speech, the\nLanguage of the Making, in which the name of a thing is the thing.\n\nThis speech, innate to dragons, can be learned by human beings. Some few\npeople are born with an untaught knowledge of at least some words of the\nLanguage of the Making. The teaching of it is the heart of the teaching of\nmagic.\n\nThe true name of a person is a word in the True Speech. An essential element\nof the talent of the witch, sorcerer, or wizard is the power to know the true\nname of a child and give the child that name. The knowledge can be evoked and\nthe gift received only under certain conditions, at the right time (usually\nearly adolescence) and in the right place (a spring, pool, or running stream).\n\nSince the name of the person is the person, in the most literal and absolute\nsense, anyone who knows it has real power, power of life and death, over the\nperson. Often a true name is never known to anybody but the giver and to the\nowner, who both keep it secret all their life. The power to give the true name\nand the imperative to keep it secret are one. True names have been betrayed,\nbut never by the name giver.\n\nSome people of great innate and trained power are able to find out the true\nname of another, or even to have it come to them unsought. Since such\nknowledge can be betrayed or misused, it is immensely dangerous. Ordinary\npeople-and dragons-keep their true name secret; wizards hide and defend theirs\nwith spells. Morred could not even begin to fight his Enemy until he saw his\nEnemy’s name written in the dust by the falling rain. Ged could force the\ndragon Yevaud to obey him, having by both wizardry and scholarship discovered\nYevaud’s true name under centuries of false ones.\n\nMagic was a wild talent before the time of Morred, who as both king and mage\nestablished intellectual and moral discipline for the art magic, gathering\nwizards to work together at the court for the general good and to study the\nethical bases and constraints of their practice.\n\nThis harmony generally prevailed through the reign of Maharion. In the Dark\nTime, with no control over wizardly powers and widespread misuse of them,\nmagic came into general disrepute.\n\nTHE SCHOOL ON ROKE\n\nThe school was founded in about 650, as described above. The Nine Masters or\nmaster-teachers of Roke were originally:\n\nWindkey, master of the spells controlling weather\n\nHand, master of all illusions\n\nHerbal, master of the arts of healing\n\nChanger, master of the spells that transform matter and bodies\n\nSummoner, master of the spells that call the spirits of the living and the\ndead\n\nNamer, master of the knowledge of the True Speech\n\nPatterner, dweller in the Immanent Grove, master of meaning and intent\n\nFinder, master of the spells of finding, binding, and returning\n\nDoorkeeper, master of the entering and leaving of the Great House\n\n  \n\nThe first Archmage, Halkel, abolished the title of Finder, replacing it with\nChanter. The Chanter’s task is the preservation and teaching of all the oral\ndeeds, lays, songs, etc., and the sung spells.\n\nThe original loose, roughly descriptive use of the words witch, sorcerer,\nwizard, was codified into a strict hierarchy by Halkel. Under his rules:\n\nWitchery was restricted to women. All magic practiced by women was called\n“base craft,” even when it included practices otherwise called “high arts,”\nsuch as healing, chanting, changing, etc. Witches were to learn only from one\nanother or from sorcerers. They were forbidden to enter Roke School, and\nHalkel discouraged wizards from teaching women anything at all. He\nspecifically forbade the teaching of any word of the True Speech to women, and\nthough this proscription was widely ignored, it led in the long run to a\nprofound, long-lasting loss of knowledge and power among the women who\npracticed magic.\n\nSorcery was practiced by men-its only real distinction from witchery.\nSorcerers trained one another, and had some knowledge of the True Speech.\nSorcery included both base crafts as defined by Halkel (finding, mending,\ndowsing, animal healing, etc.) and some high arts (human healing, chanting,\nweatherworking). A student who showed a gift for sorcery and was sent to Roke\nfor training would first study the high arts of sorcery, and if successful in\nthem might pursue his training in the art magic, especially in naming,\nsummoning, and patterning, and so become a wizard.\n\nA wizard, as Halkel defined the term, was a man who received his staff from a\nteacher, himself a wizard, who had taken special responsibility for his\ntraining. It was usually the Archmage who gave a student his staff and made\nhim wizard. This kind of teaching and succession occurred elsewhere than Roke-\nnotably on Paln-but the Masters of Roke came to regard with suspicion a\nstudent of anyone not trained on Roke.\n\nMage remained an essentially undefined term: a wizard of great power.\n\nThe name and office of archmage were invented by Halkel, and the Archmage of\nRoke was a tenth Master, never counted among the Nine. A vital ethical and\nintellectual force, the archmage also exerted considerable political power. On\nthe whole this power was used benevolently. Maintaining Roke as a strong\ncentralising, normalising, pacific element in Archipelagan society, the\narchmages sent out sorcerers and wizards trained to understand the ethical\npractice of magic and to protect communities from drought, plague, invaders,\ndragons, and the unscrupulous use of their art.\n\nSince the coronation of King Lebannen and the restoration of the High Courts\nand Councils in Havnor Great Port, Roke has remained without an archmage. It\nappears that this office, not originally part of the governance of the school\nor of the Archipelago, is no longer useful or appropriate, and that Ged, whom\nmany call the greatest of the arch-mages, may have been the last.\n\nCELIBACY AND WIZARDRY\n\nRoke School was founded by both men and women, and both men and women taught\nand learned there during its first decades; but since during the Dark Time\nwomen, witchery, and the Old Powers had all come to be considered unclean, the\nbelief was already widespread that men must prepare themselves to work “high\nmagic” by scrupulously avoiding “base spells,” “Earthlore,” and women. A man\nunwilling to put himself under the iron control of a spell of chastity could\nnever practice the high arts. He could be no more than a common sorcerer. Male\nwizards thus had come to avoid women, refusing to teach them or learn from\nthem. Witches, who almost universally went on working magic without giving up\ntheir sexuality, were described by celibate men as temptresses, unclean,\ndefiling, essentially wicked.\n\nWhen in 730 the first Archmage of Roke, Halkel of Way, excluded women from the\nschool, among his Nine Masters only the Patterner and the Doorkeeper\nprotested; they were overruled. For more than three centuries, no woman taught\nor studied at the school on Roke. During those centuries, wizardry was an\nhonored art, conferring status and power, while witchery was an unclean and\nignorant superstition, practiced by women, paid for by peasants.\n\nThe belief that a wizard must be celibate was unquestioned for so many\ncenturies that it probably came to be a psychological fact. Without this bias\nof conviction, however, it appears that the connection between magic and\nsexuality may depend on the man, the magic, and the circumstances. There is no\ndoubt that so great a mage as Morred was a husband and father.\n\nFor a half millennium or longer, men ambitious to work the great spells of\nmagery bound themselves to absolute chastity, enforced by self-cast spells. At\nthe school on Roke, the students lived under this spell of chastity from the\ntime they entered the Great House and, if they became wizards, for the rest of\ntheir lives.\n\nAmong sorcerers, few are strictly celibate, and many marry and bring up a\nfamily.\n\nWomen who work magic may practice periods of celibacy as well as fasting and\nother disciplines believed to purify and concentrate power; but most witches\nlead active sexual lives, having more freedom than most village women and less\nneed to fear abuse. Many pledge “witch-troth” with another witch or an\nordinary woman. They do not often marry men, and if they do, they are likely\nto choose a sorcerer.\n\n  \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n[ Foreword . 3 ](Tales_from_Earthsea_split_001.html#filepos3513)\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n[ Foreword . 3 ](Tales_from_Earthsea_split_001.html#filepos3513)\n\n\n\n\n",
