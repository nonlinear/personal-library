Those\nthreats exist, but they are also the ones most frequently addressed.\n“The Left”\nThe political movement known as “The Left” takes its name from the French\nRevolution where those who wanted a more democratic system sat to the left\nof the chair of the presiding member of parliament. The name is a historic\nartifact rather than a well-defined identity. At present, The Left is not a unified\ngroup, nor is “leftism” a coherent ideology. It’s the coalition of the political\nunderdogs and the marginalized who generally push toward a more egalitarian\nand progressive society. Despite there being no such thing as The Left, the\nphrase itself can be useful for discussing trends that exist across a variety\nof more concretely defined and internally consistent ideologies like anarchism,\ncommunism, and democratic socialism.\nSupport for the underdogs, the downtrodden, and the marginalized is the\ndefining feature of The Left.1 It might manifest as simply a social welfare State\nthat doesn’t even make a pretense of abolishing imperialism or billionaires, or\nit may be decentralized groups trying to eradicate all power held over others\nto create a society without rulers and coercion. Whatever the flavor of leftism,\nthere is usually some degree of acknowledgement of existing marginalizations\nand some degree of deference to the marginalized as having voices that are not\njust valuable on their own, but that are in need of being uplifted to be heard\nover the drone of the status quo.\n1Admittedly, some forms of right-wing populism have convinced the whites, the cis, the\nmen (usually all three) they they are the ones who are oppressed by the actually marginalized,\nso it isn’t truly a unique feature of The Left to claim to support the oppressed. One can also\neasily point out that many parts of The Left do not actually help the marginalized at all,\nthough they claim to do so or believe they do.\n",

The burning desire to help others becomes more and\nmore a core ethical consideration, and from this we draw our strength. Actual\ncare for one another, mutual aid, and a diversity of ideas give us an edge over\nthe lurching machine of the dominant society.\nCharacterizing The Left like this is important in the context of this zine\nbecause of the hazy boundaries between groups and ideologies and the way\nin which theory, praxis, and norms can pass easily between the different cate-\ngories of ideologies on The Left.

It’s\nin our legends with trickster gods and our fables with warnings about taking\nadvantage of others in our communities. Today, we might rightly identify insti-\ntutional actors who have swindled our communities and taken funds for public\nworks to pay for penthouses. We can point out the grift that’s endemic among\nconservatives as they race to reach a critical mass of influence or clout that\ngives them a free ride into micro stardom and minor wealth. However, there is\nno social group that is devoid of fraudsters, even The Left itself and its various\ncomponents.\nAﬀinity fraud is a type of deception that targets members of a particular\ngroup where the fraudster pretends to be or genuinely is a member of that\ngroup and then leverages that aﬀinity to exploit others’ trust. In particular,\naﬀinity fraud tends to target people based on their religion, their status as\nelderly, or their race and pull them into fraudulent investment schemes. The\ninitial distrust people carry for strangers—especially when it comes to matters\nof money—is overcome by the shared characteristics between the fraudster\nand the target. If the shared identities or community itself isn’t enough, the\nfraudster might befriend and trick an authority figure within the community\nthen use their standing to establish the initial trust with others that’s required\nfor the scam.\nBeyond the initial established trust, a tight-knit community might be un-\nwilling to seek legal or external help to deal with the fraudster and, outside of\nradical circles, this can mean little to no recourse against the fraudster. This\nmay be done to protect the reputation of individuals within the group or that\nof the group itself, and this silence and opaqueness can allow the fraudster to\ncontinue conning others.

Under so-called “liberal democracy,” this is principally carried out by\nState domestic intelligence agencies and local law enforcement. They surveil,\nentrap, prosecute, levy fines against, and imprison those who would oppose\ntheir hegemony. Other methods include what might be aptly called sabotage\nwhere interpersonal conflicts are fanned, time is wasted, or rumors are spread.\nIn many cases, law enforcement might be the spark, but we are both the tinder\nand the flame that torches our scene.\nNon-State actors—such as far-right gangs, online trolls, or conservative\nneighbors—might use similar means of disruption. Open source intelligence\n(OSINT), or rather the use of data like social media or public records, can\nreveal tremendous amounts of actionable information, and this can lead to\ndoxxing, property destruction, or bodily harm. A chief goal of these efforts is\nfinancial harm via the loss of work from doxxing or having to pay to repair or\nreplace a damaged home or other possessions. In particular, online trolls can\nvery easily disrupt online spaces thanks to the loose connections and the ease\nof cycling through invented aliases and accounts.\nFinancial disruption is a particular kind of harmful to both individuals and\nmovements because, as much as we might try to exist outside of capitalism,\nmany of our basic needs can only be met (at scale, at this time) using money\nand commerce. Resources do exist including autonomously run shelters for the\nunhoused or soup kitchens for the hungry à la Food Not Bombs. Neighborhoods\nmight set up free boxes for food or clothing, and social centers might stretch\na few quid quite far to help people meet their needs. But try as we might, we\nare limited by our access to money and capital, and our adversaries can hit\nour wallets as a means of slowing or even halting our work. Bogus charges\nmight not stick, but the hiring of legal counsel—or the paying of bail where\napplicable—can rapidly deplete funds. Fines, the cost of moving flats, hospital\nbills, and so on can stack fast enough to require groups to make changes in\nstrategy.\nThe norms we establish as a means of countering the types of disruption\nwe face are known as security culture. Generally, these include hiding one’s\nidentity, cautiously sharing information on a need-to-know basis, and possibly\nabove all else vetting individuals and establishing trust. Canonically, security\nculture aims to counter State repression via surveillance and infiltration, but\nthis is too narrow in scope since our adversaries aren’t always so clearly defined.\nWe need to devise strategies that counter all threats to our abilities to organize\nand achieve our goals including those from unlikely actors.\nAside from money, time (as the clock ticks) and time (as in our allocatable\n",

Let us call these steps and practices counter-prejudices.\nBecause society—even the radical parts—is misogynist and defaults to protect-\ning abusive men, the mantra “believe women” rose to prominence as a counter\nto the reflexive defense of abusers and dismissal of victims. During meetings,\nsome groups use a “progressive stack” to give priority to marginalized voices to\nallow them to be heard when outnumbered by dominant groups who are used\nto talking over others. To prevent groups who cause harm from exculpating\nthemselves, we listen to the marginalized about what is or isn’t racist or ableist.\nThere are many such strategies.\nIn many circles, such measures often do not go far enough as the circles\nare inundated with brocialists and manarchists, class reductionists, and vari-\nous types of bigoted individuals who place their personal gain—either as an\nindividual or for their demographic—above all else, but where these counter-\nprejudices are skillfully applied, the marginalized are far better included, and\nmovements flourish.\nThe establishment of these norms for our conduct in public and private\ncreates a bottom-up mechanism where we are all responsible for checking each\nother’s actions, and this decentralization allows anyone to raise complaints and\nrally a peer group to help address harms.

It’s admonishable to doubt a woman who calls out a man for abusing her.\nWe’re told to check our internalized racism if we side with the person that a\nPoC member of our crew accused of making racially bigoted remarks. However,\nthis counter-prejudice bulwark we’ve built up to hold back many of the worst\nbehaviors in our society can just as well be turned against us.\nThis hijacking of counter-prejudice happens in many ways with more or less\nthe following playbook:\n1. A social circle establishes a norm of counter-prejudice.\n2. A malicious actor has or claims to have an identity that is marginalized\nor deferred to.\n3. The malicious actor makes demands, causes harm, or makes accusations\nthat benefit them in some way.\n4.

They can\nrely solely on the pre-existing norms within the group to provide them with\nunwitting co-conspirators and ideological cover.\nIn these discussions, the phrase “malicious actor” does not strictly mean\ninformant or saboteur, though in some cases it does. It means someone who is\nacting counter to the goals of the group or for personal gain. In an anarchist or\nanti-authoritarian crew, it could mean someone who generally is an anarchist,\nbut cultivates social capital to always get their way or shut out people they\nsquabble with.\nIn an anti-racist collective, it could mean someone who is\nthemselves anti-racist and works to those goals, but uses the established anti-\nracist framework to elevate themselves to a position they can leverage for media\npresence or financial gain. The malicious actor places personal gain over the\nnormalized altruistic ethical framework within their group.\nAs said before, there are many groups that recreate all the existing hierar-\nchies we have in society, and in such circles the exploitation of counter-prejudice\nis less effective and seems to be less frequently used.

This can\nstart with a statistic that tends to be true right now in society at large but\nwhich is essentialized into a universal truth. Men might statistically be the pri-\nmary perpetrators of sexual violence, and the victims might also principally be\nwomen and other marginalized genders, but that neither means that all men are\nabusers nor that women are always the victims nor that men cannot themselves\nbe a victim of a woman’s abuse. It can start with something like “all white\npeople have (some degree of) internalized racism” which is near-universally true\nbecause all people living in a racist society have some internalized racism, but\nthis is then flipped into the claim that all white people’s actions are always\nmotivated by racism especially if they disagree with a person of color.\nThe hierarchy of identities in dominant society is used to decide who is\ndeserving of dignity. As it plays out in the dominant parts of society, the higher\none ranks on the hierarchy, the more empathy they deserve, the more rights\nthey should have. When one is lower, they are to be scorned and not extended\nany humanity. This same phenomenon happens within subcultures because of\nhierarchical inversion. In circles where this inversion happens, individuals who\nshare even one identity with a group that is dominant in society can have their\nhumanity stripped leaving them open to all attacks because—as it’s sometimes\nexplicitly stated—there is no quarter for oppressors.\nThere are fewer circles that practice any significant form of counter-prejudice\nthan those that half-ass it, and of those that do make an effort, it seems—\nat least in my experiences—that fewer still fall into the trap of hierarchical\ninversion.\nThat said, even without the full inversion present, I have seen\nmany cases where otherwise well meaning radicals and allies turn their counter-\nprejudices against undeserving or innocent targets as part of the normalized\ncounter-prejudice or at the behest of malicious actors.\nIndividuals and the ideas they hold have some prestige within broader so-\nciety.\nAt the core, the experiences of cisgendered, heterosexual, allosexual,\nmonogamous, neurotypical, able-bodied white men are the most prestigious,\nand as one moves away from this core in terms of held identities or support\nfor that core, the less prestige is associated with those people or ideas. The\nLeft does not use the same metric as the status quo, and within The Left\nthere is no singular metric for what is prestigious. There are, however, trends\nthat tend to be shared both regionally and globally.\nFollowing the border\ncrisis that prevented the safe and easy travel of migrants and refugees from\nnorth Africa and west Asia into Europe, support for refugees and initiatives\nthat aided them became and remains high prestige.6 Within the imperial core,\n6Even though much of this is lip service and in many places refugees are under-supported\nand marginalized by radicals who don’t want to stray from their agenda based on the texts\nof white men who died 100 years ago.\n",

Even when a critic\nof the deference politiker shares all the identities that are relevant to the topic\nat hand, the critic is labeled as a defender of whiteness or other forms of\ndominance.\nThis definition of deference politics by those who practice it is not even\ninternally consistent. There are women who fight against abortion and bodily\nautonomy, black police commissioners who enable brutality against other black\npeople, gay people who support fundamentalist Christian fascism, and trans\npeople who slag off those who transition (or don’t do it in a way they find palat-\nable). Since these individuals aren’t deferred to or held up as having valuable\nideas of worthy ideologies, obviously the ethics and ideologies of the person\nfactor in to how we receive their identities.

Once claiming to be part of\nThe Left, identity can trump ideology, and a wide berth is given to individuals\nwith marginalized identities who have harmful actions or ideas.

Because even\nextreme positions can have moderate prestige within The Left, and counter-\ning actors who hold these positions is not only low prestige but also high risk,\nthese actors often go largely unchallenged. These positions are further mag-\nnified by the trend that we need to take the most extreme “left” positions\npossible to counter the extreme conservatism and fascism of the status quo.\nThis is summed by the oft repeated (and totally shit) quote by Proudhon: “I\ndream of a society where I would be guillotined as a conservative.” However,\nthe extremeness of a position is not indicative of its utility for liberation.

This tends to be coupled with out of context screenshots or simply\ntreating any insult in the target’s retorts as signs that the target is a harasser\nand thus deserving of all retributions.\nOnline mobs that harass lefties (from a left perspective) often either come\nfrom accounts having or claiming marginalized identities or are initiated by\naccounts deputizing themselves to act on behalf the marginalized. The argu-\nments rapidly devolve from discussions of the actual positions to name calling,\nfed/badjacketing,10 or simply calling the other person “white” or “western” re-\ngardless of their actual identities. This is rhetorically effective because it relies\non the assumptions held by the harassers and their cronies that any objec-\ntion to an argument made by a marginalized person must be because of white\nsupremacy, patriarchy, or some other form or domination.\nThis is not unique to online spaces and it happens similarly in our offline cir-\ncles and local scenes. Rumors can circulate with even more distortion because\nthere’s no tweet or post to screenshot and repost, and our memories are fallible.\nA feature of offline badjacketing is often the use of anonymous and completely\nunverifiable (i.e., fabricated) victims whose identity can’t be revealed on the\ngrounds of protecting victims.11 These accusations carry water because there\nis genuinely so much bigotry and wielded privilege within our communities and\n8However, a lot of these big accounts have ties to say State media outlets, and there is a\nbizarre amount of right-wing conservative dark money circulating around the authoritarian\nleft. But we don’t need to even assume that these influences are so direct, only that they\nmight be useful idiots or quislings for some imperial cause.\n9This is precisely why “follow-trains” (e.g., #NoComradesUnder1k), or boosting/following\nrandom accounts asking to hit some arbitrary milestone are harmful.\nFollowers both by\nvolume and by accounts one already follows are some signal of legitimacy that we should\nsomewhat cautiously extend to others. Be discerning.\n10Respectively, labeling someone as a federal agent or unrepentantly problematic person.\nThe name refers to the folders (“jackets”) used in police records.\n11Anonymity is frequently and justifiably used to protect targets of abuse from retribution\nboth by the abuser themselves or those who align themselves with said abuser. However,\nthere is often a vagueness about fabricated victims such as not being able to name when or\nwhere something happened and a lack of specifics about what actually occurred. This does\nnot mean that someone being unable or unwilling to speak about their traumas is making it\nup. Determining the truthiness of a situation where one wasn’t present is always a fraught\nendeavor.\n",

When they\nhappen in a scene that leans into the tendencies of deference politics or uses\ninverted hierarchies, they are near impossible to counter. “Of course the man\nis denying being a sexist.” “Of course the cis person is denying being a trans-\nphobe.” The rumors can linger for years or never go away, and at times the\nvictim has to retreat from organizing publicly and take a background role or\nwork exclusively with small crews that know the accusations were falsifications.\nThe harasser in these cases can reap social standing no matter how the\nvictim responds. If they take a step back, it’s seen as a win for the marginalized\nfor crushing another instance of white supremacy. If they fight it, it boils over\ninto endless spats that can draw well-meaning people to side with the harasser.\nIf they ignore it by moving to another crew or blocking the harassers on social\nmedia, the harassers can forever milk it as “dodging accountability.” Repeating\nthis often enough will eventually get a critical mass of individuals behind the\nharasser to the point that they are untouchable and can continue their attacks\nin perpetuity.\nWhat can start as one harasser attacking one target can spiral and drag\ndown entire scenes.

At the most obscene end, celebrities can snap\nup six-figure sums from fans to cover expenses they can already afford.

In-groups might form around race, migration status, religion,\nor various forms of marginalization. Some of these can be faked, especially\nsocial class. Others like race are much harder to fake.

Both of them were able to use high-prestige values and\nidentities to elevate themselves. Both of them relied on people trusting their\nclaimed politics and identity to defraud them. But most importantly, with\nboth of them, there were warning signs coming from their shitty, incomplete, or\nincoherent politics that alerted more experienced members of the community,\nand these warnings were ignored and dismissed by others.\nMany of those\nthey abused were harmed after Dennis and Anarqxista said problematic things.\nOnline and off, these things rarely happen out of the blue.

What follows are suggestions for how these issues\ncould be resolved, but they’re by no means edicts about what to change.\nHarassers and abusers can so easily accuse people with dominant identities\nof being racists or sexists because of how often that’s actually true.

Part of fraudsters’ modus operandi is to\nuse vague or fabricated evidence of the problematic behavior. Because in cases\nof actual abuse, there needs to be respect for the wishes and anonymity of\nthe victims, we cannot ask for iron-clad evidence of abuse, but to the largest\ndegree possible we should demand that callouts have suﬀicient evidence to\ndemonstrate the behavior actually occurred.

Instant communication and the sum of all human knowledge at\nour fingertips massively increases our ability to affect the world around us. But\nthis connectivity comes at the cost of increased surveillance by State security\napparatuses and private individuals. Those who are active in liberatory move-\nments are aware—to varying degrees—of this surveillance, and collectively we\nhave developed operational security (OpSec) practices and an internal security\nculture to counter disruptions to our efforts to organize.\nThere are many urban legends around phones use that stem from inaccurate\nunderstandings of the technology used by phones and what capabilities the State\nand private actors have at their disposal to surveil individuals via their phones.\nThreat modeling is the process of identifying threats and building specific and\npragmatic countermeasures against them, but without accurate models of one’s\nadversaries, such models lead to ineffective countermeasures. Action taken based\noff misinformation can lead to easy arrest or create the impression of an all-seeing\nadversary thus stifling action. This zine covers the basic technologies of phones\nand addresses common urban legends so that you and your comrades can resist\ndisruption and organize effectively.\nThere is no such thing as perfect security. It is not a binary that is either\n“on” or “off,” nor is it even a spectrum of “better security” or “worse security.”\nSecurity is best discussed as “more secure under these conditions against those\nthreats.”\nWhat might be effective for keeping the State from tracking your\nlocation via your phone might be useless for keeping an abusive partner from\nreading your messages.

They could have access to all the currently\nlogged-in accounts on your phone.\nInstalled malware or stalking apps could\nenable your phone’s microphone or real-time location tracking after it’s returned\nto you.\nAside from these types of active surveillance, your phone provides passive\nsurveillance to privileged parties such as the police who can request bulk or\nreal-time access to metadata that is available to your carrier or ISP.2\nBecause of these possibilities of surveillance, activists rightly say “Your phone\nis a cop” and “Your phone is a snitch.” So then, should we keep using our phones\nbecause of what they enable, or should be discard them because of the dangers\nthey pose?\nOr, perhaps there’s some nuance in when and how we can use\nphones that allows us to retain much of their benefit while evading much of their\ndetriments.\nPhone Tech\nIn order to understand how phones can be compromised and used to facilitate\nsurveillance, we need to have an accurate understanding of how the different\ntechnologies used in phones work, such as the phone’s hardware, the phone’s\nfirmware and operating system, mobile networks, and to some extent the internet\nat large.

In suburban and rural areas,\nthere is less overlap, and consequently a phone is in contact with fewer towers.\nNetwork operators can use information about the signal itself to estimate\nphone locations.

The more towers there are, the more reliably a phone’s\nlocation can be determined, thus rural triangulation is generally less accurate\nthan urban triangulation.\nWhen phones connect to a cellular network, they send a unique device ID\n(IMEI6) along with their subscriber’s ID (IMSI7). An IMSI is typically stored on\na physical SIM8 card or eSIM.9 This means that swapping multiple SIM cards\nbetween a device or one SIM card between multiple devices can create a hard\nlink between these identities. A valid SIM or IMSI is not required to make a\nphone call; these only authenticate the device to the carrier and determine if the\ndevice is permitted to make calls or use mobile data. For example, in most (if\nnot all) regions, emergency services can be called without a SIM. Removing a\nSIM card from your phone does not prevent tracking.\nTypes of Phones\nMost people who say “phone” mean “smart phone,” namely one with an op-\nerating system and apps that can be installed by users. A basic phone is the\nleast sophisticated kind of mobile phone, the kinds seen in the early days of\nwidespread mobile phone adoption that can only make phone calls and send\nSMS messages. Somewhat rare these days are feature phones. They are some-\nwhere between smart phones and simple phones. They may have vendor specific\napplications such as an email client or internet browser built in. To differentiate\nfeature phones and basic phones from smart phones, the term “simple phones”\nis used to describe the two former types.10\nSmart Phones\nSmart phones generally have a location service feature that allows the phone\nto provide high-accuracy, real-time location data to applications, most notably\nmaps. The location service uses signals received from GPS11 or GLONASS12\nsatellites to triangulate the phone’s position. Most phones use A-GPS13 which\ncombines received cell tower signals, WiFi signals, and even data exchanged over\nthe internet to quickly and more accurately calculate a phone’s position.\n5This is called “uplink multilateration.” And as a note, we’re using “triangulation” to mean\n“multilateration” because in this case it’s worth trading technical accuracy for understandabil-\nity.\n6International Mobile Equipment Identity.\n7International Mobile Subscriber Identity.\n8Subscriber Identity Module.\n9Embedded-SIM, a chip integrated directly into the device.\n10Some people use the phrase “dumb phone” to mean either all simple phones or just basic\nphones, so we are intentionally avoiding this phrase for clarity.\n11Global Positioning System, run by the US Department of Defense.\n12Global Navigation Satellite System, a GPS alternative run by the Russian Roscosmos.\n13Assisted GPS.\n",

Even without GPS or multilateration, measurements from these sen-\nsors can be combined to derive a current location from known previous location.\nWhat this means is that even though GPS signals are passively received by\na device, use of location services can broadcast a phone’s location, and that\nturning off location services may not be enough to prevent an app or malware\non your phone from coarsely determining your location.\nSimple Phones\nMany activists believe that using simple phones rather than smart phones is\n“more secure.” Because a phone without GPS or location service can still be\ngeolocated, simple phones do not offer significant protection from location track-\ning. Feature phones typically lack widely available text or voice chat apps, and\nby definition basic phones have no such capabilities. This means that only un-\nencrypted SMS and telephone calls are available, and these are susceptible to\ninterception in more ways than if they had client-server or end-to-end encryp-\ntion. Basic phones, the seemingly least technologically advanced, may only have\n2G capabilities which means that calls and SMS are trivially interceptable with\nonly about €25 worth of consumer-grade equipment. Further, many of these\ndevices may have hidden internet capabilities that send telemetry data back to\nmanufacturers without users being aware.\nSimply put, simple phones are not more secure than smart phones\nagainst the majority of threats that most activists face.\nMalware\nMalware is malicious software. It is a program that does something you don’t\nwant and tries to hide its activities. Malware created by the State often has the\ngoal of simply surveilling and spreading to other phones or even electronics like\nWiFi routers.\nOld internet security training said that malware is installed by visiting dodgy\nwebsites or opening attachments on emails from unknown recipients, and while\nthis is still true, the attack surface of your phone is far larger. Most, if not all,\nof your apps poll for notifications or wait for notifications to arrive from Google\nPlay Services and then make requests to the app’s servers. Some malware is\nzero-click meaning that it requires no user interaction.\nAs an example, the\nPegasus spyware from the NSO Group used a zero-click exploit and targeted\nactivists, journalists, and politicians. Malware can be installed on our phone\neven if you only use trusted apps and only (knowingly) accept messages from\ntrusted contacts.\nSome malware only stays in your phone’s memory while your phone is on and\nis unable to persist across reboots. Because of this, some malware will hijack the\nphone’s shutdown routine and do a false shutdown. Still, periodically rebooting\nyour phone has the potential to clear malware.\n",

Malware is less common than you think, but don’t let its uncommon\nnature cause you to ignore legitimate warning signs. State-sponsored malware\nwill not be as readily detectable as low-effort malware, so the common methods\nmay not apply. Detection is unfortunately not something you can do yourself.\nOperating Systems\nOne of the most common questions activists ask about smart phones is “Which\nis more secure, iOS or Android?” As with all security questions, the answer is\n“it depends.”\nSmart phone operating systems (OSes) come in two flavors: iOS for Apple\ndevices and Android for everything else. iOS is proprietary with private source\ncode. Android is a base OS with public source code that manufacturers can\nmodify for their devices. Manufacturers’ Android OSes generally have private\nsource code. In addition, there are many full versions Android maintained by\nthe open source community,14 most notably LineageOS.15 GrapheneOS and Ca-\nlyxOS are open source Android OSes that have a significant focus on privacy\nand security.\nWhen a phone is powered on, the hardware starts loading the OS using\na process where each step verifies the integrity of the software needed for the\nnext step.\nThis goes by various names such as secure boot or verified boot.\nIn order to install a custom OS, this verified boot process must be disabled\notherwise the hardware would refuse to load the custom OS because it is not\ncryptographically signed by a trusted key that was included by the original\nequipment manufacturer. This allows for the possibility of a malicious OS that\ncould read your data being installed instead of the genuine OS, either by physical\naccess or by malware. This does not, however, mean that stock OSes are more\nor less secure than custom OSes. It means that there is a different risk profile\nwhen disabling verified boot and using a custom OS.\nWhen malware is developed, it must target a single application or OS. Devel-\noping malware is expensive and time-consuming, and once malware is deployed,\nit can be detected and rendered unable to infect new devices by updates to the\ntargeted app or OS.16 Because of this, it is more economical to write malware\n14It should be nevertheless noted that when using a community maintained version of An-\ndroid, one may still send telemetry or be exposed to tracking by Google because of features\nin the OS or software that’s installed like the Google Play App Store or apps like GMail or\nGoogle Authenticator.\n15LineageOS is the successor the popular but discontinued CyanogenMod.\n16Additionally, malware has the interesting property that when used it can be captured and\ncloned so that others can reuse it. This would be like if every time a missile landed on enemy\nterritory, there would be a chance it could be instantly copied and infinitely reproduced, and\nalso that that particular type of missile would be much more likely to be intercepted in the\nfuture. Militaries would be hesitant to fire so many missiles and would need to be much more\nstrategic about their targets.\n",

This\nmeans that targeting Android users is less economical and more diﬀicult for\nadversaries.\nOur recommendations are as follows:\n• For most individuals who are trying to avoid mass surveillance and low-\neffort hackers, iOS or stock Android are suﬀicient as they are easiest to\nuse.\n• For individuals who are significantly involved in social movements or expect\nto be individually targeted, at this time we recommend for their organizing\nand political work that they use GrapheneOS without Google Play Services,\nuse f-droid as the sole app repository, and install only the minimum number\nof apps required for communications.\n• For individuals who have attracted or expect to attract the attention of\nintelligence agencies, phones should be avoided for everything related to\nactivism.\nDevice Encryption\niOS and Android offer the ability to encrypt your personal data. This goes under\nvarious names like Data Protection or Device Encryption. Phones generally do\nnot have device encryption enabled by default. This feature must be enabled\nby the user either when the phone is set up or later in the settings. Likewise,\nthe protection against excessive login attempts must also be enabled.\nDevice encryption implementations generally use a hardware security module\n(HSM) or a security coprocessor,17 special chips in the phone that handle encryp-\ntion, decryption, and the cryptographic keys used for these operations. These\nchips are important because they protect the keys from unauthorized access and\ntampering. These chips may impede adversaries from accessing your data, but\nit is no guarantee. The tool GrayKey—among others—is capable of exploiting\nbugs in HSMs, and in some case it can quickly crack the unlock password and\ndecrypt the data. The HSMs that may be secure today might have new bugs\ndiscovered next month, and law enforcement may develop new techniques for\nrecovering data some 5 or 10 years in the future. Device encryption does a good\njob preventing your data from being accessed if a chud gets access to your phone\nof if a cop snatches it during a stop-and-frisk. It is not likely to withstand con-\ncerted efforts from State intelligence agencies like MI5 or the FBI from accessing\nyour data.\nA high profile example of this when the FBI cracked the password of the mass\nshooter’s phone about a year after the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. About\n5 years after that, it was revealed access to the data was done via a series of\nexploits against the software in the HSM.\n17On Apple devices, this chip is called the Secure Enclave.\n",

When used, VPNs will protect\nyour traﬀic from snooping on public WiFi networks, and they will hide your IP\naddress from servers you connect to. They can add some misdirection to in-\nvestigations and make passive surveillance more diﬀicult, but VPN apps can\nleak traﬀic, or you might forget to enable them. Traﬀic to and from your VPN\nprovider can be correlated by State intelligence agencies who are able to view\nall internet traﬀic, and your VPN can be legally compelled to collect or turn\nover logs to law enforcement. VPNs are cheap, they can improve the security in\na few ways, but they should not be relied on to provide anonymity against the\nState.\nIMSI Catchers\nAn IMSI catcher18 is device that spoofs being a legitimate cell tower and induces\nphones to connect to it thus allowing eavesdropping or the sending of SMS mes-\nsages or phone calls. Sometimes this spoofing is detectable, but detection of\nthem should not be relied on. In some regions they may be deployed without a\nwarrant, in particular during demos. In part, IMSI catchers work by downgrad-\ning the protocol to one with no encryption or one with breakable encryption.\nEven though smart phones have preferences for protocols that offer more protec-\ntion against interception and spoofing, to enable phones to function in regions\nwith only 2G, and because it is part of the GSM standard, smart phones can\nstill be downgraded into using insecure protocols by IMSI catchers. Phone calls\nand SMS messages sent and received by smart phones are not robust against\ninterception by IMSI catchers.\nFaraday Bags\nPhones send and receive information using electromagnetic radiation. This radi-\nation can be blocked by special materials. Urban legends and some supporting\nevidence say that signals can be blocked by putting a phone in one or more crisp\nbags19 that have foil lining, but this—like many countermeasures—should not\nbe relied on. A purpose-built Faraday bag can be acquired, and these can be\ncounted on to block phone signals.\nIf you need to transport phones and ensure that they are not leaking signals,\nturning them off may not be enough. Few smart phones can have their batteries\n18Often IMSI catchers are referred to by the popular brand name StingRay.\n19Also known as “chip bags,” for the yanks.\n",

Something leaning on them in your bag might press the power button.\nMalware can hijack the shutdown routine and prevent the phone from actually\npowering off when you try to shut it down. More importantly, when phones are\n“off,” they are (generally) more accurately described as being in a low power\nusage mode which is obvious when one notices that “Find My Phone” style apps\nare still able to locate them. Placing a powered off phone in a Faraday bag can\nprevent them from sending signals and will significantly reduce the possibility\nthat the location can be determined.\nSecurity Basics\nThere are some phone practices that tend to be advisable for most activists. A\nfew are detailed here.\nUpdates\nWithout reservation, the single best thing you can do to prevent yourself from\ngetting hacked by law enforcement—or random hackers—is to promptly install\nupdates to your phone’s operating system and all apps. It may be annoying,\nbut many updates contain security patches for critical vulnerabilities. If nothing\nelse, this can prevent your bank, money transfer, or payment accounts from\nbeing drained.\nPassword Managers\nThe second most useful and generally applicable security practice is to use a pass-\nword manager for all your accounts, including those used on your phone. There\nare paid versions that allow automatic synchronization of passwords across de-\nvices and automatic logins to webpages. However, these require some level of\ntrust in the corporation offering the product. Free alternatives like KeePassX\nexist but do not have the ease of use that paid products do. When using a\npassword manager, all your accounts should have strong, unique, random pass-\nwords. These are typically automatically generated by the manager. The master\npassword to unlock the manager should be a long, random phrase.\nHumans are notoriously bad at generating the randomness needed for pass-\nwords, and using the opening line of your favorite poem, or some tricky substitu-\ntion rules to change antifascism to an7if4sc1sm! can be quite easily cracked\nby computers. Diceware is a method of creating passwords by rolling dice and\nusing them to select words from a predefined list. Five words is the absolute\nminimum, six is better, but anything over eight is overkill. Doing this provides\nunguessable randomness that you cannot create on your own, and moreover this\nrandomness is easily memorizeable. An English-language, user-friendly wordlist\nis provided by the EFF. An example phrase is MutableCalmBlubberFitJustify\n(please do not actually use this one; make your own).\n",

This is of particular importance because the\nunlock method is also the decryption method, so a strong unlock method helps\ndefend against unwanted access to your data if you phone is captured. In general,\nyou should prefer passwords to either PINs or patterns as the former are harder\nfor machines to crack. You should almost certainly disable face-unlock features,\nand you may want to disable fingerprint unlock. In some regions there are legal\nprotections for passwords but not for fingerprints or other biometrics.\nSome phones offer the ability to have all data deleted if there are too many\nincorrect login attempts. You should enable this (and then keep your phone\naway from curious toddlers and pets).\nDisable notifications from your lock screen, or at least disable them from\napps that might have sensitive information. Disable access to apps from your\nlock screen.\nIf you have device encryption enabled on your phone, your data is most\nstrongly protected when your phone is off (or has been powered on but your\nunlock password has not yet been entered). After unlocking your phone once,\nyou have less strong protection for your data.\nMany activists leave fingerprint unlock enabled because it is tremendously\nconvenient compared to typing a 30-something character password 100 times per\nday. Because the need for convenience often wins out over the need for better\nsecurity, this becomes yet another reason to not keep sensitive information on\nyour phone. If you have fingerprint unlock enabled, you can temporarily disable\nit by holding down your power button. You can do this before interactions with\nlaw enforcement, going to bed, or leaving your phone unattended.\nWireless Features\nYou may want to disable WiFi and Bluetooth when you are not using them. Both\nof these can be used for “fingerprinting” and identifying your phone. Addition-\nally, they increase the attack surface available to hackers who are attempting to\n",

While the risks from leaving them continuously enabled\nare minimal, these practices can add marginal improvements to your security,\nand if you don’t need them, why not do this?\nBackups\nSmart phones often come with a feature for automatic backups to a cloud ac-\ncount tied to the phone (to Apple for iOS and to Google for Android). Apple has\npreviously halted plans to encrypted backups in their iCloud following pressure\nfrom the FBI, and their backups are unencrypted. Google offers end-to-end en-\ncrypted backs that, following external reviews, offer strong assurances of privacy\nfrom Google itself or law enforcement. Additionally, some apps may have their\nown backup services. For example, WhatsApp can backup your conversations\nto its servers.\nOur recommendations are to avoid backups to Apple, but backups to Google\nare safe enough because you should not have incriminating evidence on your\nphone anyway. Because data that is sent to third parties may still be lost or\ndestroyed even if it can’t be recovered by police, you should consider backing up\nyour data to an encrypted hard drive you keep at home or somewhere safe.\nMessenger Apps\nMessenger apps provide more secure alternatives to telephone calls and SMS\nmessages.\nEncryption\nText and voice chat apps offer one of two types of encryption.\nClient-server encryption is when the channel between a client (e.g,. your\nphone) and the server is encrypted and protected from interception or tamper-\ning. The message is decrypted and stored on the server. When the message\nis requested by another client (e.g,. your friend’s phone), it is re-encrypted for\ntransit and sent.\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) is when clients generate cryptographic\nkeys and exchange their public parts with each other. Messages are encrypted\nusing the other client’s public key and sent through the server with the server\nonly acting as a blind relay because the messages are only decryptable by the\nother client.\nE2EE only means that a server or someone else between your phone and your\ncomrade’s phone cannot read or tamper with a message. An adversary may infer\ninformation from the metadata about the size of the message, the time it was\nsent, its sender, and its recipient.\nSome messenger apps offer opt-in E2EE such as Telegram with their secret\nchats, but this feature is not available for groups. Other apps such as Signal or\nWire have mandatory E2EE, as do iMessage (Apple) and WhatsApp.20 Some\n20There are more interesting peer-to-peer chat apps like Briar and Cwtch that are metadata\nresistant and possess other interesting security properties, but they do not have wide adoption.\n",

Some apps require you to only verify one\nfingerprint for all devices, but others require you to verify one fingerprint for\nevery device. Some apps send notifications in the conversation notifying you\nwhen your contact’s fingerprint changes, possibly suggesting something nefari-\nous. Some apps unfortunately do not do this. You must verify all fingerprints\nfor all devices, and if a fingerprint changes, you must re-verify it otherwise all\nof your security could be undone. Further, some chat apps do not share devices\nyou’ve verified with your other devices, and this poor UX requires you to verify\neach of your contacts’ devices from each of your own devices.\nFigure 1: QR Code and Fingerprint\nUsage\nThe mantra “just use Signal” is often repeated by activists, but it falsely assumes\neveryone has identical threat models. In some regions, use of Signal may be\nblocked by national firewalls, or its use may be so infrequent that doing so\nmay flag a user as suspicious. In North America and Europe, these drawbacks\ngenerally do not exist.

Signal fails to adequately warn users who use IMEs about the\npossibility that their chats could be read by the software and reported to the\nState before the messages were encrypted.\n21Further, some folx have atrocious security practices of joining many large Signal group\nchats and discussing their actions without vetting who else is in the group.

The same goes for for any other\nE2EE chat app. Do not treat them as one.\nWhile we have strong criticism for Signal here, this criticism is driven by\nSignal’s popularity and the misconceptions around it. It is still at the time of\nthis writing one of a small number of encrypted chat apps that can be relied on\nfor strong security.\nEmail\nThere are ways to make email communication more secure, but email as a pro-\ntocol and communications medium is generally not secure for private commu-\nnications. Boutique and activist-friendly email providers (i.e., non-Gmail/non-\nMicrosoft/etc.) do not offer significant security benefits against interception by\nlaw enforcement or hackers. When sending emails, some people use PGP or\nS/MIME, but these are diﬀicult to use and have an overall poor user experience.\nTwo people using these encryption methods can have fairly good protection\nagainst having their email read, but one misclick can send the entire history of\na conversation in plaintext thus making it viewable by law enforcement. Pro-\ntonMail has made bold claims about encryption for their emails and clients, and\nmany activists have taken these half-truths to mean that using a ProtonMail\naccount means all of their email are encrypted, but this is not the case. Email\nshould generally be avoided for planning and especially for secure communica-\ntion.\nThat said, email remains popular because every device can send and receive\nemail, and some people “don’t do chat apps.” For coordinating a local tenant’s\nunion or setting up shifts at the local infoshop, email may be fine. If you choose\nto use email, assume that law enforcement are reading all messages, and keep\nconversation to a minimum. Do not discuss illegal activities. Do not discuss\njuicy scene drama that can be exploited by the State.\nFinally, there are legitimate use cases where email and PGP can be a last\nresort such as a one-time-use encrypted channel for someone on the run so that\nthey can set up a second more secure channel. In cases like this, phones should\nstill be avoided because of their ease of trackability.\nMultiple Aliases, Multiple Phones\nDepending on your threat model, you may choose to maintain multiple phones\nthat are linked to your multiple aliases. For example, you may have one phone\nlinked to your status quo public life with social media accounts you used to\nconnect with family and a second phone with a separate SIM and separate\naccounts tied to your activist life.\nThis segregation of accounts is part of a\nprocess called compartmentalization.\nThe first benefit is that the use of distinct devices for each of your aliases pre-\nvents programming errors or user errors from exposing your private information.\nApps on your phone may have unexpected behavior such as sending your entire\ncontact list a request to connect when you sign in to a new messenger app. You\n",

Each app you install is a possible route for malware\nto get on your phone, so if your phone has only a bare-bones OS and two chat\napps, it is more diﬀicult to compromise.\nUsing multiple phones on its own does not prevent law enforcement from\ntying your aliases together. If you carry the phones at the same time or use\nthem at the same locations, they can be linked.\nAs an alternative to multiple phones, you can reduce some of the risk of\nleaking data via error or unexpected behavior by creating multiple profiles on\nyour Android device. This will not protect you against malware, but it does\noffer some protection.\nOne of the most common use cases for having multiple phones is for organiz-\ning a union. Some companies require apps to be installed for remote manage-\nment as a way to protect corporate intellectual property or to mitigate security\nbreaches. These are spyware apps, and they can completely control your phone.\nEven those aside, many companies require a chat app for communicating. You\nshould avoid organizing on company devices or ones with corporate spyware\ninstalled, and you should avoid using company chat in unionization efforts.\nDisposable, Demo, and Burner Phones\nMost people understand the importance of their phones and know that they\ncan be tracked by them or that their compromise of loss can be devastating. A\nnumber of approaches are used by activists—and others—to help reduce their\nrisk even if they cannot fully articulate their risk or why their countermeasures\nwork.\nSome people have demo phones or disposable phones they take to actions or\nuse when crossing borders. These devices have minimal private data on them\nand are considered untrusted—due to possible malware installation—if they are\nhandled by law enforcement. These phones are not used for anonymity. They\nmay share a SIM card with with their user’s everyday phone and may be used\nin such a way that geolocation would link them back to their user’s residence.\nDemo phones make less data and less accounts available to the police should\nthey be captured. There is no requirement that a demo or disposable phone be\na simple phone. In many cases they are smart phones because this allows their\nuser to have maps and E2EE communications.\nActivists erroneously use the phrase “burner phone” to describe demo phones,\ndisposable phones, or any simple phone.22 A burner phone takes its name from\n22People seem to use the phrase “burner phone” because it sounds Mega Illegalist and Super\nCrimey and not because they are actually describing the properties of a burner phone.\n",

Any accounts on the phone must be made anonymously, only ever used\nwith that phone, and then never used again.\n8. The phone must be used for exactly one action.\n9. The phone must only ever contact other burner phones or unaﬀiliated\nparties (e.g., an oﬀice or adversary who is targeted by the action).\n10. The phone and SIM card must be powered off after the action then imme-\ndiately destroyed.\nA complicating factor is that some phones or SIM cards require activation\neither by calling a number of accessing the provider’s website. Sometimes these\nwebsites block Tor connections. Using a non-burner phone to activate the SIM is\nan obvious violation of their required security properties. You may need to find\na pay phone or socially engineer a stranger at a train station to let you borrow\ntheirs for just a few minutes.\nWhen we say that a burner can be used for one action, we mean “one time-\nboxed sequence of activities.” This may mean one direct action that takes place\nover only two hours. It also may mean the planning and coordination in the\nmonth before an action as well as the action itself.\nWith particularly careful usage, a single closed aﬀinity group can reuse their\nset of burner phones for recurring actions. If this is the case, the phones need to\nbe cycled in batches so that the different closed loops of burners don’t overlap\nwith each other.\nA non-mandatory, but strongly recommended property is that burner phones\nshould not be purchased immediately before an action. This creates the addi-\ntional possibility that the stored security footage of the purchase could still be\naccessible.\n23Theft of phones with an activated SIM card is generally not recommended because each\ntheft creates an additional location data point that can be tied to the action, the phones\nmight not be able to be unlocked, and the owners may have the devices added to deny-lists\nmaintained by the carriers so that they cannot be used for making calls or using data.\n",

There are legitimate\nreasons to have phones, and alternatives can mean less burden when we give up\nour phones or change our habits.\nBarriers to getting rid of phones is that people want to have info, gather info,\nand trade contact info. A pen and a note pad and let you have your collective’s\nmeeting minutes accessible in an analog manner. You can use it to trade contact\ninfo, and if you’re slick, you can carry a copy of your device’s cryptographic\nfingerprint to establish a secure line even when you and the other party do not\nhave your phones on you. A paper calendar can allow you to schedule. Printing\nout paper maps of the area of operations for an action can help you navigate. If\nyou create paper copies of information, ensure you promptly and securely dispose\nof it to avoid creating a literal paper trail of your activities.\nPhoneless Contingencies\nWhile your plan may work today, it must also be forward thinking. You may\nrely heavily on your phone for organizing while accepting the security risks, but\nthere may come a time when repression or catastrophe disables your phones\nor the internet. It is common during heightened repression for the State to cut\nmobile phone service or the internet for entire regions. If your ability to organize\nand your safety relies on nearly everyone having phones and working internet,\nyou are setting yourself up for certain modes of failure. Word of mouth and the\nso-called sneakernet are fallbacks, and your planning needs to incorporate the\npossibility that this will the only way to move information.\nCase Studies\nTo make the previous discussions more concrete, we’re providing a number of\ncase studies drawn from our experiences. Some of these cases show individuals\nwho already have more accurate threat models, and others who do not. Some\nare based on urban legends, and others more on verifiable facts or very probable\nconjectures. Where there are errors, they are discussed.\nCase 1: Planning Meetings for a Semi-Public Action\nScenario\nA collective is planning an occupation that will be kept secret until it begins,\nafter which it will be made public via social media. Planning primarily happens\nat in-person meetings at a local social center.\nAssumptions\nThe collective assumes that police are interested in preventing occupations, and\nthe activists may be under surveillance. This surveillance includes, but is not\nlimited to, State-backed malware that could be on the individuals’ phones.\n",

However, there is an assump-\ntion about how effective moving the phones out of the room is, and this could\nbe verified by starting a recording, placing the phone in the box, then having a\nloud conversation to see how much is understandable. If the voices are remotely\nrecognizable, snippets could be recovered with audio editing software.\nIf the social center is not regularly swept for microphones or other bugs,\nthe conversations may still be recorded. If the group or other groups who fre-\nquent the social center are heavily surveilled, laser microphones placed in nearby\nbuildings could record the conversations.\nIf individuals are under passive surveillance, the fact that a meeting took\nplace and who attended could still be revealed by the repeated presence of the\nsame group of phones at fixed location from 19:00 to 21:00 on Wednesdays for\nmany consecutive weeks.\nRecommendations\nIf phones are collected to prevent surveillance, they should also be powered off.\nThere should be loud, ambient noise where phones are placed to minimize the\nchances that they can pick up the audio of the conversations.\nIf the group believes they may be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit a\ncrime, the may want to leave phones at home or power them off before traveling\nto the meeting. This can be further minimized by not bringing the same phones\nto the action itself.\nIf high security is desired, bugging of the room or recording via State actors\ncan be further reduced by meeting at locations that are not aﬀiliated with lib-\neratory movements. If the group wants to meet at a central, known location for\nconvenience, it should be established at the start of the meeting that only the\ncurrent action (and nothing more illegal) should be discussed.\nCase 2: Overheard Chatter\nScenario\nSome members of an aﬀinity group are hanging out in a park to socialize, not\nto plan an action.

They have assumed that their\neveryday conversations are uninteresting and uninformative.\nCountermeasures\nThe group has taken no countermeasures against their conversations being over-\nheard.\nAnalysis\nIf the group is consciously not discussing plans or past actions, then obviously no\nmicrophone can overhear what isn’t said aloud. However, planned and carried-\nout actions aren’t the only thing the State is interested in. Gossip, drama, love\ninterests, social ties, and even the dispositions of people and orgs within a mi-\nlieu toward one another are valuable intel. This can allow the State to create\nmore accurate social maps. If the State suspects one individual was involved\nin something they are investigating, and they know the individual had accom-\nplices, using social maps that are constructed from bit of casuals conversation\ncan help them narrow down their list of suspects or reveal the members of an\naﬀinity group. Such overheard conversations can give the State insight about\nwho is feeling ostracized and resentful so that they can be targeted to become an\ninformant. Small conflicts and be exploited, and heated emotions can be fanned\ninto roaring disputes.\nRecommendations\nThere is a generational split among activists between those who organized be-\nfore the widespread use of mobiles phones and those who began organize after\nthe ubiquity of phones. There is a also a further split between those who orga-\nnized using simple phones before the popularity of smart phones, and those who\nhave always organized in a world where nearly all of their contacts have smart\nphones. This gap is notable by the ability to make plans on the assumption the\nother people wouldn’t have phones such as fixing locations and times with less\nspontaneous changes. Additionally, those who organized prior to the adoption\nof mobile phones have a more acute sense of what it was like for organizing to\nincreasingly take place where everyone effectively had microphones present.\nAs mentioned earlier in this zine, smart phones allow us to instantly commu-\nnicate and have limitless information on hand at all times. This comes with the\ncost of new avenues for surveillance. Activists should be mindful that mobile\nphones present in homes, cars, and social settings might be gathering soft intel-\nligence on social groups. If we were to make the recommendation that phones\nshould be more frequently powered off, we might be laughed at for paranoia\nor for the impracticality of the suggestion. So-called liberal democracy gives\nthe illusion that we do not live under a repressive police state, yet there are\nmany cases where innocuous social circles and activists groups are hacked and\nsurveilled, not to mention the more radical and involved groups.\n",

There may come a time when repression heightens and we begin to\nfeel its presence more sharply. To prepare for such times and to build habits that\nenable us to resist such repression, our suggestion is more moderate. Practice\nheightened security starting now. See if you can organize phoneless events. When\nyou hang out or go hiking, even if you meet at a pub, see if you can get everyone\nto leave their phones at home. Accustom yourself to their absence. Feel the\nfreedom of knowing you’re not leaking location data to the State and that no\none can hear your conversation except for those present.\nCase 3: Squatting and Simple Phones\nScenario\nA crew of activist want to squat an unoccupied building with the goals of drawing\nattention to speculative property investments, and if the squatting is successful,\nturn it in to free housing for locals who have recently been evicted. One team\nwill be in the building doing the occupation, and other teams will be on the\nground out front negotiating with the State and posting to social media.\nAssumptions\nThe occupation team thinks that the police could learn their identities by seeing\nwhat phones are communicating from within the building, and even if they are\nnot arrested or prosecuted for this action, that knowledge could be used against\nthem in the future.\nCountermeasures\nTo reduce the chances of their identities being learned in the case where they\nare not arrested during the action, the occupation team has chosen to not bring\ntheir personal phones. They will only bring one “burner phone” to have comms\nwith the negotiation team so that they can be involved with the decisions, to\nsend posts to the social media team, and to have a sense of security instead of\nbeing isolated until the end of the action. They will be using a phone with a\nSIM that is not registered to any of their names to make themselves anonymous.\nAnalysis\nThe crew is correct in not bringing personal phones into the building the are\noccupying as they could be used to identify them. Police could do this by looking\nat what phones are in the building, and seeing to whom they are registered or\nlooking at where they tend to spend the most time (e.g., when their user is at\nhome sleeping). The crew is incorrect in calling the phone a burner phone as\nits repeated use can be used to tie it back to the crew and individuals. This\nphone is more accurately described as a demo phone. Since some of the crew is\nremaining outside of the building without masks, the crew’s identity is known\neven if not all of the identities of the occupation team are known. If the phone\n",

The police may deploy an IMSI\ncatcher so that they can read the SMS messages sent back and forth between\nthe occupation team and the negotiation team. This may give the police a leg\nup in the negotiations or give them opportunities to exploit division within the\ncrew to allow them to more easily force an eviction.\nHowever, if the police are likely to expend this level of effort on tracking\ndown the individuals based off of the phones present in the occupation, there is\nlikely a strong enough push for “law and order” that the occupation itself would\nnot even be a viable action.\nRecommendations\nThe reasons the occupation team wanted to bring a single phone into the building\nwere legitimate, but they should have used a demo phone with a single use\naccount account they created on an E2EE chat app. This account should only\ncommunicate with one anonymous account belonging to the teams outside to\nprevent leaking the crew’s social network if the phone is confiscated or the app\ndeveloper has data for those accounts that is later subpoenaed in court.\nCase 4: Simple Phone + Signal Desktop\nScenario\nRuben is an activist involved with a crew he believes is under active surveillance\ndue to their anti-government stances. To minimize how much intelligence agen-\ncies and local police can track him, he uses a basic phone with a SIM card when\nhe is out and about. Because some discussions with his crew are more sensitive,\nthey need an encrypted messenger and have chosen Signal. Signal requires regis-\ntering with a phone number and will only generate the initial encryption keys on\nthe iOS and Android apps. To get the Signal desktop app to work on his laptop,\nhe has used the SIM card from his basic phone in his friend’s smart phone to\nset up an initial key pair that he could link with his desktop app. Afterwards,\nRuben signs out of his account on the Signal app on his friend’s phone.\nAssumptions\nRuben’s decision to not carry a smart phone is based on the belief that smart\nphones are more trackable than basic phones. Ruben also assumes that Signal\nis more secure than telephone calls or SMS, so he uses Signal for some of his\ncommunications.\nCountermeasures\nRuben’s decision to use a basic phone is intended to minimize location tracking\nfrom his smart phone.

His communications are more insecure because he does\nnot have the possibility that “emergency” messages can be sent to or received\nfrom members of his crew using his basic phone, and if he does, they will be\nintercepted and stored by the State. His countermeasures against surveillance\nhave created a burden for both himself and his crew, and they have not made\nhim more meaningfully secure against the threats he faces.\nRecommendations\nRuben should use his own smart phone for communications in general. If there\nare times when he needs his location to be hidden or his conversations to not be\neavesdropped on, he should leave his phone at home.\nCase 5: Phoneless Planning\nScenario\nThe members of an aﬀinity group have been actively involved in the liberatory\nmovements for long enough that they are known to the State. They are currently\nplanning Something Big. They have a ban on discussing it over electronic means,\nand they only discuss it in person.\nAssumptions\nThey have assumed that the State would go to great lengths to prevent their\naction and even greater length to investigate it after it occurs. They assume\nit’s possible that their electronics have been compromised by State malware.\nThey assume that even absent any evidence, they will be on the list of primary\nsuspects for the action, so their OpSec for the action needs to be airtight.\nCountermeasures\nBecause of the possibility of malware, they are treating their electronics as less-\nthan-trusted. Because of the possibility of targeted investigations, they do not\ndiscuss their action in their homes, their vehicles, or known social centers and\nspaces tied to liberatory movements. To help reduce metadata that links them\ntogether, they turn their phones off before they arrive at their meeting locations\nand turn them on again only after they’ve left.\nAnalysis\nThe group is right to assume they may be under targeted surveillance, and they\nare right to treat their phones as snitches. Turning their phones off does decrease\nthe possibility of malware using a microphone to spy on them, and it does create\nsome deniability about their locations during the meetings.

Moreover,\nif one member of the group is caught but says nothing during interrogation,\npolice could look at their phone records for anomalies. The police could query\nthe data by asking the questions: At the times when this phone went off, what\nother phones went off near it? And what were the phones of our other suspects\ndoing at that time? This could reveal the rest of the members of the aﬀinity\ngroup, or provide supporting evidence that members of the aﬀinity group were\nthe individual’s accomplices. It is possible the police do not think to ask these\nquestions or that this is not part of standard operations, but it is better to leave\nno trail.\nRecommendations\nBecause they are anticipating targeted surveillance and resources to investigate\ntheir activities, they should leave all electronics at home and pick random loca-\ntions for their meetings that are either very loud or very isolated.\nCase 6: Phones at Mass Actions\nScenario\nIsa is an activist who primarily attends larger demonstrations, and while she\nis not radical herself, she has some friends who are, and she is generally aware\nof what they do. Fascists have planned a march, and Isa and some friends are\ngoing to join the crowds who hope to block their planned route. In order to\nconnect with her friends and get up-to-date information about the blockades or\nchanging routes, Isa will bring her everyday phone (the only one she has).\nAssumptions\nIsa is not worried about arrest because at similar actions in the past, when a\nlarge crowd of people who do not appear to be classically antifa block the streets,\npolice only kettle them or drag them out of the way before rerouting the fascists.\nShe does not think that if she was arrested they would look through her phone\nat all, legally or illegally. She is also not concerned about her phone’s location\ndata.\nCountermeasures\nIsa has taken no countermeasures against her location data being collected or\nphone being confiscated.\nAnalysis\nAt mass actions, police may use IMSI catchers to see who has attended these\nprotests so they can build profiles. This location data may be used to prosecute\npeople for rioting even if the charges don’t lead to conviction.\nIf Isa is arrested, which still may happen if the blockades are too small or\nshe’s one of the unlucky ones to get snatched while they form on the streets, she\nmay have her phone searched.

This can endanger them more than\nher.\nRecommendations\nEven though Isa does not anticipate arrest, she should be more cautious with\nher phone. She could agree to meet with friends at a fixed place and time before\nthe demo so that they can avoid bringing their phones at all, or if they really\nwant to have real-time information, only one person in her group should bring a\nphone. Being careful with her phone can protect her radical friends who might\nengage in more militant means of resistance to the fascists.\nHowever, the chances of any of these things happening is low, and the per-\nceived benefit of bringing a phone is high. That makes this a case where it’s\n“fine” for Isa to bring her phone… until suddenly it isn’t.\nCase 7: General Planning and Communications\nScenario\nA collective organizes legal protests and hands our flyers promoting green and\necological alternatives to the current status quo such as going vegan, better\nfunding for bicycle infrastructure, and decreased reliance on personal automo-\nbiles. They use an email list hosted on a server provided by some local techy\nactivists.\nAssumptions\nThe collective assumes that police are generally interested in activists, but that\nthe collective itself is not specifically being targeted. They know that local trolls\nlike to harass the “hippie communists.” They also know that there are other\nmore militant green organizations in their region, and that members of their\ncollective may be in all manner of other groups.\nCountermeasures\nThe collective wants to avoid harassment, so they keep their email list private\nand invite only. They want to avoid tracking by large email providers, so they\nself-host their email.\nAnalysis\nEmail lists are largely popular because everyone has access to email, but there\nare many different chat apps and not everyone uses the same ones, so collectives\ntend to continue using email lists. Often people claim to have insuﬀicient room\non their phones for more apps. Some members of collectives have low technical\nskills and do not want to learn other apps, so sometimes email is unavoidable.\nEco-activists worldwide, including in western so-called democracies, are\nspecifically targeted for surveillance even when not engaging in direct action.\nSelf-hosting the email list may decrease corporate surveillance, but there is\nalways some weak link with subpoenas for data.

This is generally a good practice to\nhelp save data in case the phone is lost or breaks.\nThe collective should ideally move to an encrypted chat app, but if they\ncontinue to use email, it should only be for the most basic details such as the\ntimes and location of their activities. Planning, internal debates, and significant\ndiscussion should stay off email as this information can give the State great\ninsight into the collective which can be used for disruption.\nCase 8: Underground Raves\nScenario\nA collective plans underground outdoor raves during the corona virus pandemic.\nThey ask people to wear masks, and think this is suﬀiciently safe with regards\nto spreading the virus. Police have a blanket ban on mass gatherings (except for\nwork and other things that keep the machine of capital greased).\nAssumptions\nThe State has made active efforts to break up mass gatherings (of course, only of\nthe working class and marginalized), but they will likely not retroactively look\nfor evidence of these gatherings. They have the ability to gather real-time phone\nlocation data which they may use to detect several hundred people in a remote\nlocation. Police have informants who listen for things like this, and some people\njust like to snitch on others if they hear about something they don’t like.\nCountermeasures\nThe rave is not posted to social media, and information is requested to be for-\nwarded to additional contacts only via secure means. In the info, people are\nrequested to put their phones in airplane mode when they get near the desig-\nnated location.\nAnalysis\nNot publicizing the event is an obviously correct step to keep police from learning\nabout it on their own. Asking people to only spread the info to trusted contacts\nin secure ways is also a great way to reduce risk, but all it takes it one person to\nforward a trimmed down message with just the location and time for the warning\nto be lost.

With\nphones, this is no different. Having access to instant communications and vast\nknowledge in our pockets is tremendously powerful, but it comes with the cost\nof increased surveillance.\nYou may think the State isn’t surveilling you, but if you’re involved in lib-\neratory social movements—even loosely—it surely is. Protecting yourself can\nprotect your friends, family, or comrades who are move deeply involved in the\nmovement. You may think that the State is hacking your phone to tap your hous-\ning co-op’s weekly meetings, but it almost certainly isn’t. Maximum security at\nall times is unattainable, and aiming for it is taxing.\nAfter reading this you might be tempted to say “but they’ll track me no\nmatter what.”\nThe belief that any level of safety against external threats is\nimpossible is called security nihilism.\nPeople who feel this often take one of\ntwo paths. They can believe that no countermeasures work, so they keep acting\nand take no precautions thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy ending with their\narrest. Or they can believe in the supremacy of the State and become paralyzed\nwith inaction. Repression works not just because of the stick that hits us or\nprison that cages us, but also because of the fear of those punishments and our\nsubsequent self-imposed inaction.\nAny steps you take can protect you, and many of them are so simple that\nyou can start applying them right now. At the easiest, you can avoid dragnet\nsurveillance by using basic encrypted messenger apps and leaving your phone\nat home during demos or direct actions.\nEvery step you take beyond those\nwill require your adversaries make more concerted efforts if they want to surveil\nor disrupt you. Time and resources are limited, even for the large intelligence\nagencies. Humans make mistakes, and computers break. Your adversaries are\nfallible, and you can significantly decrease the amount of data they can capture\nand what sort of insights they can glean from it.\nMoreover, the State isn’t always using the maximum theoretically possible\nsurveillance methods. Just because it’s possible for the State to hack your phone\nor track it, they surely aren’t doing that to catch you walking through parks\nafter their closing hours. Even in cases where the State wants to use maximum\nsurveillance, they may do so ineptly. Your threat model should account for the\nrealistic expected response from your adversaries given their knowledge of your\nactions.\nLearn about how the police, fascists, and other adversaries in your area\noperate, and come up with a threat model for yourself and your crews. Discuss\nit at length with your comrades. Start with a few bits of OpSec knowledge and\nturn it into a security culture.

We don't\nwant to keep you from reading for too long, but we'd like to start by saying\nwhat motivated us to put this booklet together (and what didn't).\nWe are quite a motley crew, active in struggles ranging from opposition\nto the nuclear industry to opposition to racism against the Roma. In our\nexperience, we have found that it is often diﬃcult to find an overview of\ndiﬀerent forms of action, especially militant ones, as well as practical and\ncontextual thoughts on diﬀerent aspects of security and action planning.\nSometimes it's the little things that cause headaches, like how to fill the\nfire extinguisher with paint. A lot of clever writing has already been pub-\nlished, but where? Not everyone has an archive of radikal¹ in their closet,\n¹No Trace Project (N.T.P.) note: radikal was a German magazine, first published in\n1976, which included practical information on how to carry out actions. It is banned\nin Germany.\nand rummaging through old issues, as nice as it is, takes a lot of time and is\nnot possible everywhere. That's why we have collected information about\ntaking action.\nCollected in the sense that we hope that while browsing through these\npages, you'll come across an idea that you hadn't thought of yet, or that\nhasn't been concretely described anywhere yet. Collected also means that\nmost of the content has already been published somewhere, and we have\ncopied or summarized it. Some of the texts were written specially for this\nbooklet because we couldn't find anything already written on the subject.\nIn the “Action Tactics” chapter², we deliberately included many very dif-\nferent options. We also received new and imaginative suggestions as we\n²N.T.P. note: This chaper is not included in this translation.\nwere putting it together. We believe that it can only be a good thing to\nconstantly and creatively reflect on one's own forms of action. This in-\ncludes the question of which form best conveys what we want to commu-\nnicate.\n5\n",

However,\nthe thoughts on goals are very general. One of the reasons for this is that\nthe content of our actions is geared to the social conflicts at hand, which\nare constantly changing. Each context sets its own priorities and needs\nto be discussed anew. We felt that this booklet should contain ideas that\ncan be applied or transferred to diﬀerent situations at diﬀerent times. The\nemphasis is on practice because we wanted to be precise and show as many\ntactics as possible.\nWe haven't tested everything ourselves. However, we know some things\nfrom experience, and we have tried to verify and research everything else\nto the best of our abilities. For the more complicated content in the chap-\nter, it is always necessary to do tests yourself before putting anything into\npractice. But you know that…\nWe wanted to avoid creating a hierarchy of diﬀerent forms of action. Ad-\nmittedly, some topics take more space here than others. This is probably\nbecause the more complicated the preparation and the higher the health\nrisks or the intensity of repression, the longer the descriptions will need\nto be in order to be accurate. […]\nYou may have some fundamental objections to publishing such a collec-\ntion, such as that we shouldn't unnecessarily give cops or Nazis recipes for\nthe forms of action used by the radical left, because that might make our\npractices more transparent. But we consider it more important to spread\nforms and ideas among ourselves. As we said, most of it has already been\npublished and will already be familiar to the cops. We figured that it can\nbe an advantage if many people in many places know and use many forms\nof action, because then specific practices would not be so easy to attribute.\nAnother diﬃculty is that such a collection could appear to be the “ulti-\nmate collection”. But it isn't intended to be, and it isn't; many things are\nstill missing. For example, the use of the Internet is given far too little at-\ntention in this booklet. It would be interesting to think more about secure\nInternet access and claiming actions by email or about hacking. In our\nopinion, neither Internet cafes nor anonymization software are suﬃcient.\nIt would also be interesting to have more information about copiers and\n6\n",

The comments in square brackets are from\nthe editors of the original PRISMA zine.\nThis text summarizes some things to consider when planning actions. It is\naimed at smaller groups rather than mass mobilizations. However, some\nof the considerations can be applied to such larger actions. The text is not\nmeant to be a step-by-step guide to action, but rather a collection of things\nthat should be kept in mind if an action is to be successful. The points\nthemselves are based on concrete experiences, but are kept general enough\nto be generally applicable…\nBeforehand\nA question precedes any action: what do we want to achieve, what is the\ngoal of the action? It makes a diﬀerence whether we want to create pro-\npaganda, cause as much economic damage as possible, physically destroy\nsomething, or show solidarity with other struggles. Often we want to\nachieve a mixture of these diﬀerent goals.\nIn any case, it makes sense to discuss goals as concretely as possible be-\nforehand. Then it's easier to think about what we want to do and what we\nneed in order to do it. No matter the action (whether you drop a banner\nor vandalize an oﬃce…), for these initial discussions you should choose\nsecure places where you can be confident that you won't be overheard.\nDepending on the composition of your group, it may also be important to\narrange to meet in a way that isn't visible to other friends, comrades and\nroommates, since you may not otherwise spend time with this particular\ngroup of people very often.

Once you have\ndecided what you want the action to accomplish, the next step is to select\na specific target where the desired impacts can best be achieved. By nar-\nrowing down the goal, the tactic, and the specific location, you now have\nan initial rough plan for your action! After answering the three famous\nquestions “what, how, and where?”, the concrete planning can begin…\n[In any case, when selecting a target, care must be taken to ensure that no\nbystanders are endangered.]\nInitial Reconnaissance\nThe first step should always be to familiarize yourself with the target loca-\ntion. Ideally, several people should take a look at the chosen location. They\nshould use photos, drawings, and maps to describe the area to each other.\n[We need to point out problems with this approach: you shouldn't have\nphotos, drawings, etc. lying around at home. If photos and drawings can-\nnot be avoided, they shouldn't be kept at home and should disappear as\nsoon as possible. If photos are stored digitally, you should carefully con-\nsider where you store them, and how to completely destroy them; more on\nthis in the last chapter. The very latest that you should destroy everything\nis right before the action.]\nMore things will be noticed with more pairs of eyes, and some things are\nonly really noticed through the process of collective discussion. A small\ngate, a hidden camera, a tree adjacent to a wall… It's often these little\nthings that later become central to the plan. At this early planning phase,\nit's important to develop an eye for what type of movement is typical in\nthe surrounding area, the ways into and out of the target location, and\npossible escape routes. The area to take into account grows if you will be\ndriving to the action by car³ because then you'll also need to find a good\n³N.T.P. note: Later in the zine, a section on vehicle traces concludes that “the use of\na car should […] be avoided whenever possible.”\nparking space and well-chosen car routes.

This should include the routes you will take to arrive and\nleave which are free of security cameras, the parking options, the location\nof entrances on the target building, and multiple escape options. Part of\nthis general plan is also to decide whether the action should take place\nduring the day or at night, and how long each part of the action will take\n(the arrival route to the meeting point, the route from the meeting point\nto the target, the duration of the action, the escape routes, including al-\nternative escape routes). You should also determine the number of people\nneeded during this planning phase, which depends heavily on the tactics\nchosen and the specific conditions on the ground. How many people are\nneeded for this specific action? How many lookouts? Is it necessary to\neavesdrop on the police radio or something similar? How many cars and\ndrivers?\nSecond Reconnaissance\nThe second reconnaissance of the target location takes place with the gen-\neral plan in mind. Therefore, it should take place at a time of day similar\nto the time you expect the action to take place. Especially if the action is\ngoing to take place at night, it's important to know the lighting conditions\nand typical traﬃc patterns. All participants should have seen the location\nbeforehand to get their own idea of the situation. During this second re-\nconnaissance, the main focus should be on possible security systems and\ndetails of the terrain. For example, if you are going to scale a fence, it's\nimportant to know how it's constructed. Is it topped with barbed wire? Is\nit made of a material that can be easily cut? How thick is it? Is it made\nof individual panels that are only bolted together? Where are the screw\nheads located, what size are they?\nAfter this second reconnaissance, everyone should know enough about the\ntarget to be able to decide together what tools and tactics will be needed.\nIt is also essential to test the planned escape routes. Are there really no\nsurveillance cameras along the routes? Is our car really the only one that\nparks there, or is the spot also used by others? Is the parking location vis-\n10\n",

It's often the little\nthings that make the diﬀerence between success and failure. Another im-\nportant step is to precisely measure the time it takes to get from the target\nto where you can get into the car. If this escape time is not fast enough,\nthe car must either be moved closer or driven towards the people escaping\nso that everyone disappears quickly enough. It can be useful to agree on a\nmeeting point after an action so that you can drive back from this meeting\npoint together, but these routes and locations also need to be checked for\nsuitability.\nPart of this second reconnaissance should also involve thinking about\nwhere the clothes and tools should disappear to after the action is carried\nout. It's clear that we should at least get rid of our “outer layer” (shoes,\npants, jackets, gloves and hats) as well as any tools which leave behind\ntraces useful to the police. Otherwise, we can never know how likely it is\nthat these items will be found and linked to us at some point.\nAt this stage, the most sensible means of communication must also be\ndiscussed. Can everyone always have a line of sight to each other and thus\ncommunicate with signs? Do we need walkie-talkies or other forms of\nremote communication? All forms of communication need to be tested\non the ground to make sure it isn't too dark to see each other, or that a\npreviously unnoticed building doesn't block radio communication…\nThe Action Plan\nTo create a detailed plan, everyone involved in the reconnaissance first\ngoes over all the new information together. In practice, it usually makes\nsense to ask very specific questions about each report. Most of us aren't\ntrained to describe a situation in detail like police oﬃcers and journalists.\nSo it's important to ask each other questions in order to collectively ac-\nquire accurate descriptions of things. A detailed action plan begins with\nthe meeting point of the active participants and does not end until every-\none has dispersed.\n[The individual escape routes should also be discussed together.

What tools are needed when? How\nwill they get to where they are needed? And how will the tools be disposed\nof? All roles must be clearly described (driver, lookouts, people who will\nbe directly at or in the target…). An important decision at this stage is\nalso whether there should be some form of back-up. By this we mean a\ntrusted person who, in the case of failure or danger, can be contacted far\naway from the action by phone or other suitable means to organize exter-\nnal support. This is not useful or necessary for all actions.\n[In our opinion, telephone communication during or shortly after an ac-\ntion is a major security risk. We have no way of knowing if the contact's\nphone is being tapped. It may be possible to use a burner phone with an\nunused card, but even this should be carefully considered. It's probably\nbetter to arrange a meeting place beforehand.]\nPlan B\nIt's often a good idea to think of solutions to problems that may arise.\nA door that cannot be opened does not necessarily mean the end of an\naction. If you run through several alternatives in advance, you will be able\nto deal with a “deviation from the plan” more quickly and easily. It's even\npossible to decide on a completely diﬀerent goal in case there are insur-\nmountable problems with the planned action. However, you should also\ndecide which situations should cause the action to be aborted altogether\n—discuss beforehand the conditions under which it should not be con-\ntinued.\nImmediate Preparation\nIn the lead up to the action, the detailed plan should be rehearsed until\neveryone can confidently carry out their “role.” It's usually useful for all\nparticipants to be aware of each other's tasks so that at any given moment\nthey can assess what stage the action is at.

There\nis often a lot to coordinate and arrange during the preparation phase. It is\noften a good test of how reliable and focused the individuals in the group\nare. Set a clear and realistic timeline for getting everything you need. Es-\npecially when it comes to tools that leave traces, it is always a good idea\nnot to get them from the store around the corner, but to think carefully\nabout how this or that can be obtained without being surveilled. It's also\nimportant to pay attention to the combinations of things you buy—it may\nbe tempting to get everything you need in one go at a hardware store, but\nputting a crowbar, a jerrycan and gloves in the same shopping cart can\nbackfire.

This evaluation can include the initial public reactions and, on this\nbasis, you can assess whether the method and goal of the action matched\nyour political intentions. Was the impact as you imagined it? Were there\nany shortcomings, and how can they be addressed next time? In some\ncases, it makes sense to somehow publicly communicate about the action\nat a later date.

Public\ncommunication should distinguish between at least three intended audi-\nences: the “general public,” the “direct public” (e.g. through flyers in the\nneighborhood), and the “scene public.” It's important to think carefully\nabout who you want to address, with what information, how, and why.\nA Final Note on Security\nAchieving complete security simply isn't possible. Every action has a risk.\nThat means dealing with potential consequences and determining the im-\nplications of a worst case scenario, if someone gets caught.

The key is to have as detailed a plan as possible that specifies\nwhat to do and what not to do at each step of the action. This way, you can\nthink about what traces you might leave behind at each step. And, during\nthe action, you can take appropriate countermeasures. If you have to climb\nover a pointy fence, be prepared for clothing fibers to get caught. If you\nwalk over sand or soil, be prepared for shoeprints. If you make a phone\ncall, the call can be traced. If you send a letter, the mailbox or post oﬃce\ncan be traced. If you pay with a bank card, the data is stored… So there are\nalways traces and they cannot be avoided. The crucial question is whether\nthey can be traced back to you.

In addition to concrete preparations\nfor the action, we should discuss the participants life situations, possible\nfears, communication channels, and what to do in emergencies such as an\ninjury or repression. Here are some thoughts, based either on our experi-\nence or our expectations.\nThe better we know each other and the more we prepare for emergencies\nin suﬃcient detail, the better we can act or react at the crucial moment. In\ndiﬃcult situations (e.g. particularly committed citizens acting as auxiliary\npolice, arrests, etc.), panic sets in quickly. Already having a clear plan of\nhow to react is very helpful, because at this point there's usually no time\nto think. Of course, detailed preparation is not a cure-all. There are always\nsituations in which fear causes us to ignore all previous agreements. So it's\nespecially important for contingency plans to be part of the preparation.\nEach individual, their fears, insecurities, and life situation should be taken\ninto account. Everyone should feel safe and be able to rely on the others.\nOn the basis of such trust, we can overcome our fears together. Our limits\nare certainly diﬀerent, but there are usually solutions (e.g. by discussing\ntask distribution openly and honestly). For example, someone may not\nlike being the lookout because they know that they will panic if they have\nnothing to do and may give a stop signal before it is actually necessary.\nSomeone else, on the other hand, may already have trouble throwing and\naiming even before taking fear into account, so when the excitement of\nthe action is added to the mix, nothing works. So think carefully about\nwho is best suited for each role. Think also about preparation tasks, such\nas producing the action materials, shopping, writing an action claim, pub-\nlishing it the next day, etc. For example, it can be very helpful if the people\nwho are building an incendiary device during the day (and thus may come\ninto contact with gasoline) are not present at the action that night—this\n17\n",

So we\ncontinue to rely on face-to-face meetings, which of course are not without\nrisk. It's not always easy to find a suitable place to meet and talk. The cri-\nteria should be that the place is unlikely to be bugged (i.e. not your apart-\nment or a bar you regularly frequent), there are no other people within\nearshot, and ideally it isn't obvious from a distance that you're having a\nclandestine meeting. For added security, during the meeting you can avoid\nmentioning locations, names, and dates (and also avoid showing them\nwith hand gestures), writing them down instead. Be careful because this\ncan be very conspicuous.\nIt's also important to think about how to communicate in an emergency\nsituation.

It can\nbe helpful to arrange an emergency meeting point for this scenario.

When dealing with the topic of traces, it's easy to get the\nimpression that it's impossible not to leave trace. However, militant ac-\ntions from the last few years show that a lot is possible, and that successful\ninvestigations are actually quite rare. So don't be put oﬀ and be careful!\nKnowing the other side's capabilities and acting with caution are the most\nimportant factors to avoid prosecution by the cops and courts.\nA trace can be anything, no matter how small or inconspicuous. Every\nchange in the environment leaves traces, so it's impossible to leave ab-\nsolutely no trace. What's important is to leave as few traces as possible,\nand to make sure that they can't be linked back to you. To this end, no\nexpense or eﬀort should be spared. Gloves and other action materials and\ntools should always be bought new, for single use.\nThe police will look for traces directly at the action site, on any suspects\nand in the places they frequent (home, workplace, etc.) So it's not enough\nto only pay attention to traces at the action site—you may also bring traces\nfrom the action site home with you. An example is sand or soil—their\ncomposition can be analyzed and identified quite precisely by forensic\nlaboratories. So if you bring home mud from a dirt road on the soles of\nyour shoes, this can prove that you walked on that dirt road. Such subtle\ntraces quickly become diﬃcult to analyze. If unlucky, however, there may\nbe enough of a trace left to reconstruct a connection to you, which can\nthen be interpreted as evidence of your involvement in an action. This is\neven easier with traces of glass or DNA, i.e. anything that doesn't degrade\nquickly. If you deliberately leave something at the action site, you can be\nsure that it will attract special attention. The same goes for action claims\nsent in the mail, or if any remnants of the materials you used fall into the\nhands of the police.\n20\n",

Most of the time,\nthe bigger the damage or the attention, the more they will invest in the\ninvestigation.\nIt's also important to keep in mind that forensic methods are constantly\nevolving, and methods that were introduced recently are becoming stan-\ndardized and widely used. Precautions that we consider excessive today\nmay not be suﬃcient in the future. A good example of this evolution\nis DNA analysis. Thirty years ago, hardly anyone foresaw this relatively\nnew investigative method, which naturally meant that minimal precau-\ntions were taken to avoid leaving DNA traces. As the example of federal\nprosecutor Buback (who was shot dead by the RAF⁹ commando Ulrike\n⁹N.T.P. note: Red Army Faction, a West German far-left militant group founded\nin 1970.\nMeinhof in 1977) demonstrates, with the right political pressure, traces\nfound decades earlier can be re-examined. In this way, the State shows\nthat it doesn't forget, and perhaps also tries to deter today's militants.\nIn addition to the problem that old traces can eventually be analyzed using\nnew methods, these new methods can become increasingly widespread\nand less expensive through their further development and standardiza-\ntion. The threshold is lowering for using DNA samples as evidence in\nincreasingly petty crimes on the basis of vague suspicion. The amount of\ngenetic material required for analysis has also been reduced.\nSpecific laws could also be overturned, such as the ban on storing infor-\nmation about certain physical characteristics or diseases in the databases\nof the BKA¹⁰ and LKA¹¹, since they already allow storing information\nabout genetic sex.\n¹⁰N.T.P. note: The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA, Federal Criminal Police Oﬃce) is the\nfederal investigative police agency of Germany.\n¹¹N.T.P. note: The Landeskriminalamt (LKA, State Criminal Police Oﬃce) is the\nState-level police agency of Germany.\nOf course, we can only present the topic of traces in the context of to-\nday's forensic methods.

This\nmeans not touching any objects that could fall into the hands of the police\nwith your bare hands to begin with, rather than relying on cleaning them\noﬀ. Fingerprints are one of the most durable traces. They are often left\ncarelessly and can persist for years. Even on objects that have been sub-\nmerged in water for years, fingerprints can still be recovered under certain\nconditions. Almost any material can bear fingerprints.\nOther countermeasures exist. To remove fingerprints, thorough cleaning\nwith a degreasing agent (such as an alcohol-based cleaning agent) is rec-\nommended. Glass and smooth plastic surfaces are the easiest to clean; it's\nenough to thoroughly and intensively clean and wipe them with an alco-\nhol-based cleaning agent or, if used thoroughly, dishwashing soap. When\nremoving fingerprints from metal surfaces, it is imperative to use a sur-\nface-altering agent such as steel wool. Fingerprints are slightly acidic, so\nthey etch into metal.

Put them on and also put\non an unworn balaclava—pull the hood of the coverall over it. Bathing\ncaps are also good for covering your hair, as they are even more imperme-\nable and your hair won't be able to poke through. Next, place each foot in\na garbage bag and tape the bags to the legs of the coveralls. Then put on\nrubber dishwashing gloves and tape them to the sleeves. If possible, put a\nmask over your mouth to block droplets of saliva, and put on protective\ngoggles that also cover your eyebrows. Always work in pairs and make\nsure no skin is exposed.\nChoose a place to work where your hair and skin cells are not already fly-\ning around. It should also be free of hair from a dog, cat, or other animal\ncompanion that could be classified as your pet. For example, use the base-\nment or garage of friends (who are not politically active), or rent a hotel\nroom. Set up a clean work surface, preferably with a tarp, or if you want\nto be on the safe side, set up an unused tent in the room. This tent will\nat least keep most traces of your work inside, and you can dispose of it\nsecurely afterwards.\nWhen you work, you should have diﬀerent garbage bags ready and sepa-\nrate the waste according to how risky it is for you (e.g. waste from a device\ncomponent in a bag, the Ziploc packaging in another, etc.) When separat-\ning waste, you should also consider which packaging has your fingerprints\non it and which doesn't. Obviously, none of these garbage bags should be\nput in your household trash.\nBe aware that working in these clothes is both sweaty and tiring, and con-\nsider relieving each other or sharing the work if necessary, as interruptions\nwill require you to change clothes again. Remember not to scratch your\nhead or face while wearing gloves. For example, a good division of labor\nis to have one group prepare the clean room and another group enter it\nto work. Store finished components or items in new freezer bags or Tup-\nperware containers.\n27\n",

It\nmay be less relevant for the radical left at the moment, but who knows\nwhat the future holds? Like human DNA, artificial DNA is unique and\nuniquely identifiable. It is placed in an adhesive carrier liquid that glows\npurple under UV light, along with equally unique micro-platelets. The\nsubstance can be applied to valuable objects with a brush, or buildings\ncan be equipped with so-called DNA showers. The marking on objects\nis permanent and resistant to normal cleaning. If you come into contact\nwith the substance, it will stick to you for about six weeks. This relatively\nnew process was introduced as a pilot project at the end of 2009 at schools\nin Bremen, Germany, in two residential areas and in some petrol stations.\nIt has been used in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands for some\ntime.\nScent Traces\nA more recent development is the collection of scent samples, as was done\nduring the raids on militants suspected of opposing the Heiligendamm\nG8 summit in 2007.

By\ntool traces, we mean identifying traces on both the tool and the object the\ntool is used on.\nEach tool is unique and can be identified through both small irregularities\nfrom its production process, and normal wear and tear. Each tool leaves\nunique traces on the object it is used on. For example, a cut sheet of paper\ncan be matched to a specific pair of scissors (only if the cops have the\nscissors, of course). If the cops do not have the tool in their possession,\ntypically only the type of tool can be determined, at least for mechanical\ntools which come into direct contact with the object the tool is used on.\nTherefore, you should dispose of bolt cutters, screwdrivers, or whatever\nelse is used in an action—get rid of any tool that came in direct contact\nwith an object it was used on. Unfortunately, getting rid of the tool after-\nwards is not enough by itself. To stay with the scissors and paper example,\nthe cops can not only match the cut paper to a particular pair of scissors,\nbut also determine if separate pieces of paper were cut by the same scis-\nsors. So if you open a fence with the same bolt cutters you used to build\nyour loft bed, the cops will be able to determine this, even if the tool is\nlong gone.\nThis is why it's necessary to acquire new tools for an action in order to\nwork securely. They don't always have to be the best and most expensive.\nConsumables such as tape, rope, cable (and their remnants) can be\nmatched to each other. A small piece of cable in your home that matches\na cable in the cops' possession can be a strong piece of evidence.\nWhen working with either tape or glue, you need to be especially careful\nabout cleanliness, as both collect dust and DNA traces.\nIdentifying traces can also be found on tools you make yourself, such as an\nincendiary device.

Here are a few basic procedures for doing research\nin preparation for an action²⁷.\n²⁷N.T.P. note: In the original PRISMA zine, this section assumed that you would\ndo research for an action using a public computer at an Internet cafe or a similar loca-\ntion. We advise against this, and therefore omitted most of the original section in this\ntranslation. From “How to submit an anonymous communiqué and get away with it²⁴”:\n“The general recommendation for most people is to use a personal computer\nthat is only for Tails, on public WiFi. […] Public computers themselves could\nbe compromised at the hardware level or through intentional collaboration\nbetween their owner-operators and law enforcement, and this could be almost\nimpossible to detect.”\nThe books you order or borrow from a library can be traced back to you,\nand the cops check the library accounts of suspects. Avoid libraries at all\ncosts. Some libraries are also under video surveillance. […] Leave your\nmobile phone at home when doing research.\nRemember that Internet cafes often have surveillance cameras, so try to\navoid them. […] You should be aware that even in cafes without cameras,\nstaﬀ may still be able to remember you. Try to wear disguises and be as\ninconspicuous as possible. Remember that your fingerprints can also be\nfound on cash you handled, at least for a short time.\n39\n",

With small additions from the\neditors of the original PRISMA zine.\nWhat technical capacities are used for surveillance? And how can we counter\nthem?\nWe've all seen it in spy movies: bugs in lamps and cameras behind one-\nway mirrors in 1960s thrillers. Or the modern operations centers in more\nrecent movies that can listen in on every phone call within seconds and\ntrack everyone via satellite surveillance.\nThe reality is somewhere between these two portrayals. Not every police\nforce has access to the same technical equipment (and trained personnel),\nand will only request it if the associated costs can be justified with an\nappropriate threat scenario or serious “crime” that has already been com-\nmitted.\nNevertheless, the State's interest in prosecution and criminalization\nshould not be underestimated. Police and intelligence agencies will try to\njustify the purchase and maintenance of expensive equipment by using it\nas frequently as possible.\nThis text explains the current technical capacities of police and intelligence\nagencies (as of 2006). The most eﬀective countermeasures are very simple\nand can be implemented without detailed technical knowledge: meet in\nplaces where surveillance is highly unlikely and do not use risky commu-\nnication channels (phone, mail) for political purposes.\nMonitoring Enclosed Spaces\nAll of the instruments available for monitoring enclosed spaces have two\nmajor disadvantages: they require advance preparation and they are rela-\ntively expensive.\n40\n",

Depending on what they are used for, they can be very small (2–3\nmillimeters thick), but can also be the size of a sugar cube or even a match-\nbox. They are almost indistinguishable from other electronic components\nand are sometimes camouflaged, i.e. permanently installed in other ob-\njects, rooms or vehicles.\nPreferred places to install bugs are electrical outlets, light switches, land-\nline phones and other electrical devices that are continuously supplied\nwith power. If necessary, holes are drilled in furniture to place micro-\nphones as close as possible to the people speaking.\nBugs can eavesdrop on conversations within a radius of about 10 meters.\nOne bug is enough to monitor a room of about 100 square meters. De-\npending on its battery, a bug can operate between several weeks (button\ncell) and several months (9 volt battery). Of course, bugs that are con-\nnected to an electrical source or a phone cable will “live” longer.\nBugs with built-in radio transmitters are among the larger variants and\ncan reach radio ranges of several hundred meters or up to two kilometers,\ndepending on the building²⁸. Electrical and phone lines can also be used\nto transmit the intercepted conversations.\n²⁸N.T.P. note: As of 2025, it appears that the majority of bugs used by police and\nintelligence agencies that remotely transmit their recordings do so through the mobile\nphone network. Those bugs can transmit their recordings as long as they can commu-\nnicate with a cell tower.\nSpecial microphones hidden in landline phones or their jacks can be re-\nmotely activated and listened to.\nCountermeasures against bugs:\nOf course, anyone can search for bugs themselves. Special bug detectors\nare available for purchase at diﬀerent price ranges, and services can also be\nhired. Professional bug hunters charge a lot of money. And they usually\nhave a history as intelligence agents, military personnel, or police oﬃcers,\nand will therefore be wary of fouling their nests.\n41\n",

Sometimes they are very small and hidden,\nsometimes they are large and obvious or installed as a deterrent. The latter\nis unfortunately not always the case, especially when police and intelli-\ngence agencies have installed them for surveillance purposes.

Entrances to well-\nknown places of the radical left, autonomous social centers or squats are\nmonitored as inconspicuously as possible and usually not continuously, if\nthey are monitored at all. However, individual cases of continuous cam-\nera surveillance over many years have been revealed during political trials.\nIt's certainly worth observing the windows opposite the entrances of such\nplaces (even at a very oblique angle). The BfV sometimes rents apartments\nfor this purpose. Normal tenants have also been asked to make their win-\ndows available for a surveillance camera.

As a deterrent, sometimes\nonly fake cameras or “You are being recorded” signs are installed without\na device actually being present. If the recordings are meant to be used to\ninvestigate possible crimes, they are not only displayed on monitors but\nalso saved. Saved recordings can later be viewed remotely or accessed via\nthe Internet. All of these variants can be wireless or wired.\nIn terms of camera types, there are large, highly visible cameras that\nare preferred for deterrence. These are the traditional box cameras, box-\nshaped long-range infrared cameras or the large versions of dome cam-\neras. Small to medium-sized pen cameras (round, pen-shaped), small\n54\n",

And, of course, there are hidden cameras: very\nsmall mini cameras (e.g. integrated almost unnoticeably in doorbells, on\nfront doors or gates), and cameras that are completely disguised in clocks,\nbehind one-way windows, in motion detectors or smoke detectors.\nAll camera types can be equipped with various functions: zoom, pan and\nrotate, extra wide radius, night vision. They vary in their sensitivity to light,\ntype of focus (variable or fixed), and image resolution. With high resolu-\ntions, people or license plates can be recognized and identified. So-called\n“intelligent cameras,” which recognize previously stored characteristics of\npeople, such as eye-mouth-nose distance, iris or gait, and then sound an\nalarm, are not yet in use in Germany. In general, the latest technology\nis not used everywhere, but it tends to get better and cheaper. The type\nof camera and its capabilities cannot be identified at street level, or only\nroughly. So your assessment of a camera type can be based on the location\nand the level of surveillance you think is likely there.\nWhat Can We Do About Them?\nWe can choose our routes and targets so that no surveillance cameras\nrecord us. But we can also try to outwit them: hold something in front\nof the camera if it isn't mounted too high (e.g. an umbrella, cardboard, or\neven just a bag placed over the lens).

Sometimes it's enough to\nwear clothing that conceals your body shape, such as a garbage bag, or to\nput a rain cover over your bike to obscure it (when the camera is far away).\nAfterwards, you should dispose of your clothes and, of course, not use your\neveryday clothes in which you may have already been photographed. We\nrecommend reversible jackets, masks, umbrellas, or placing cushions and\npillows under your clothes that change the shape of your body.

    "chunk_full": "First, a Few Basic Rules When It Comes to Physical\nSurveillance\nA surveillance operation is planned and organized. It requires some eﬀort\nif it is to be useful: preparation, personnel, vehicles, technical aids, coor-\ndination. Most surveillance has no political motivation and is carried out\nagainst threats such as organized crime, burglaries, etc.\nThere are various forms of surveillance. They can be categorized as follows\n(the terms are chosen by us): surveillance of a specific place, object, person,\nor area.\nIn the case of surveillance of a place, the surveillance operators sit in a\nstatic location (in a house, car, etc.) and do not move from there. For ex-\nample, they may be exclusively interested in who enters a certain building,\nor whether something is hidden in the bushes somewhere. Such surveil-\nlance is very diﬃcult or even impossible to detect.\nSurveillance of an object is a variation of the first form. It involves keeping\nan eye on a specific object, such as a car or a parcel of money. To do this,\nthe surveillance operators have to be mobile.\nIn the case of surveillance of a person, the first two forms can be com-\nbined. For example, by monitoring the target's home with cameras (sta-\ntic surveillance), and otherwise tailing the target (mobile surveillance). In\nsome cases, tracking devices may be used, or the operators may set up at\nfixed locations that a target must pass. Surveillance may end in an arrest,\nor it may have no noticeable consequences at all, except that the security\nauthorities hold onto everything they have recorded.\nThe reason for the first three forms of surveillance is usually a police in-\nvestigation or something similar by the intelligence agencies and the BfV.\nThe tightening of security laws enables the cops to surveil you even out-\nside of an ongoing investigation.\nSurveillance of an area is aimed at gaining information about the move-\nments of various people. Against political targets, this type of surveillance\noperation attempts to create movement profiles for the scene. This is usu-\nally done in the run-up to important political events and may or may not\nbe based on a specific investigation.\n58\n",

    "chunk_full": "All forms of surveillance can also be carried out overtly. The purpose of\novert surveillance is either to make the target nervous to see how they\nreact, or to find someone to target in the first place by seeing how diﬀer-\nent people react. Overt surveillance is clearly recognizable as such. They'll\nshow up at your doorstep or even call you to say they're there. But take\nnote: if you detect a surveillance operation, it doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it is overt surveillance! The operators are not always as skilled as we\nmight assume.\nIt's very easy to surveil someone who is oblivious. It's very diﬃcult to sur-\nveil someone who expects to be surveilled.\nThe amount of eﬀort invested in a surveillance operation depends on many\ndiﬀerent factors. Priorities must be set: what is more or less promising at\nthe moment? What is politically desirable, whether for the government,\nthe local authorities, or the diﬀerent factions within the security appara-\ntus? What is even feasible?\nThere is competition among agencies as to who should or can do what. If\none agency feels it is being interfered with in some way by another, this\ncan lead to a reduction in the willingness to work. Although budget cuts\nand staﬀ shortages impact police and intelligence agencies much less than\nother domains, it still does to some extent. It's also a matter of what other\nimportant cases are in progress which should not or cannot be put on the\nback burner.\nThe surveillance apparatus is a sluggish public service system with a lot\nof people who don't really care about their job. Success is often achieved\nnot by brilliant ideas or particularly dedicated working methods, but by\nroutine, i.e. by always following the same procedures.\nAnother important factor is how dangerous and “surveillance aware” the\ntarget(s) is/are believed to be.\nA thorough surveillance operation requires a certain amount of prepara-\ntion time, sometimes several weeks. So if you've been arrested for some-\nthing and you're now worried that you might be under surveillance, don't\nbe surprised if the surveillance doesn't start until quite some time later,\nwhen your vigilance has already started to wane.\n59\n",

    "chunk_full": "Not Everything That Can Be Done Will Be Done\nThere are numerous zines and books about what is technically possible in\nsurveillance today. They describe bugs the size of a grain of dust stuck in\ncracks that can be accessed remotely, or camera lenses the size of a pinhead\nlurking somewhere. There are even cameras that no longer require lenses,\nusing camouflaged light-sensitive micro-components instead. Tracking\ndevices can be purchased that can be located via satellite, allowing the\nsurveillance units to locate their target without having to leave the oﬃce.\nPhones can be called without ringing or otherwise alerting their owner.\nRooms can be bugged from a great distance using laser beams. Computer\nscreens can also be tapped. Thousands of phone conversations can be in-\ntercepted using computers listening for keywords.\nA weakness of these texts is that they usually don't tell the reader anything\nabout which capabilities are used when, or by whom. Many of the above\ntechniques are very expensive. Some are technically feasible, but their de-\nvelopment is not yet suﬃciently mature and they are still in the testing\nphase. Others are used, but “only” by the intelligence agencies. And what\nthe intelligence agencies have, the cops do not have—if only because the\nintelligence agencies value being better than the cops.\nThere are also priorities. Today, there are still some things that are more\nthreatening to the State and capital than the radical left and/or that are\nmore diﬃcult to control with conventional methods of surveillance. These\nprimarily include State espionage, counter-espionage and industrial espi-\nonage. The elaborate, nasty technical capacities are mainly used in these\ndomains and, of course, in the military domain.\nOf course, all technically possible forms of surveillance are a potential\nthreat to us. Anything that has been used once somewhere will be used\nagain. The cheaper it becomes and the more familiar the authorities be-\ncome with it, the more widespread its use will be.\nIt's also important to consider the relationship between the use of a tech-\nnical capability and its success. Bugs are a good example of this: using a\nbug makes sense if the surveillance operators have a relatively clear idea\nof what is being discussed where, or at least assume that they know where\ninteresting conversations are taking place.

Is a clear line of sight guaranteed? How good\nis the footage quality? If the goal is to clearly identify people, a telephoto\nlens must be used. This rules out the tiny camouflaged lenses, so a real\ncamera has to be hidden nearby somehow. And a camera lens that can\nidentify a face is also more vulnerable to being detected. If it's installed so\nfar away that it cannot be easily detected, there's a risk that other things\nsuch as trees, cars, etc., will obscure its line of sight.\nTherefore, it's realistic to assume two likely possibilities. On the one hand,\nthere will be a handful of surveillance operations using sophisticated tech-\nnical capabilities.

Even if the target\ndoes not detect the surveillance themselves, there's a high probability that\nother people who aren't being targeted will notice it. They will see cars\nsuddenly speeding oﬀ for no apparent reason, or people sitting in parked\ncars pushing themselves deep into their seats, or they will notice someone\nsuddenly mumbling into the lapel of their jacket, or lingering in a doorway\nfor a long time.

The lists can contain errors, the license plates\nare changed. The best protection is to develop a “nose” for cops and infor-\nmants, and you will develop this through attention and experience.\n2. How To Detect Physical Surveillance\nLet's assume you're up to something so you want to go scope out an area.\nOr you have nothing to do at the moment and are taking an attentive\nwalk. How can you detect whether there is a surveillance operation going\non?\nCars are the most noticeable element. For once we can be happy about\nthe car society we live in. Cars are easy to identify and can be clearly de-\nscribed by their model, color, and license plate number. Almost all stake-\nouts involve cars, and the operators on foot are usually passengers who\nhave gotten out of a car. Cars have several advantages for the cops: they\ncan hide their radios and other equipment (a camera, a change of clothes)\nin the car. They can speak loudly and listen to radio messages without be-\ning noticed by outsiders. They can move between locations quickly. They\ncan sit comfortably and maybe even take a nap if the surveillance drags\non without much happening. Of course, there are also operators on foot,\nbike, and motorcycle, who are usually harder to spot.\nSurveillance vehicles are generally clean and well maintained. There are all\nkinds of car models in all kinds of colors, mostly high horsepower mod-\nels, but no souped-up or otherwise flashy models. Don't expect to see any\ntechnical features like radios, radio antenna or anything like that. Gone\nare the days where surveillance cars gave that away. Nowadays, the cars\nhave “hands-free” systems where messages are picked up by a hidden in-\nterior microphone and the radio can be hidden in the glove compartment.\n66\n",

Other\nthan that, the car looks normal. Or there are two people in it with their\nseats partially reclined, maybe dozing oﬀ. Or someone is just sitting there\nlooking intently in a particular direction. Or maybe you just see a man or\nwoman with headphones standing idly on a corner. Shortly thereafter, a\ncar slowly rolls past you with two young men in it, looking out the window\nwith interest. Then, two corners further on, two cars are parked next to\neach other with two couples standing next to them, smoking and chatting.\nThey are probably wearing normal, sporty, casual clothes and shoes. They\ndon't have “cop faces,” nor do they look particularly strong. But maybe\nyou heard a beeping sound coming from one of the cars as you passed by.\nYou may have just noticed the two essential elements of surveillance: first,\nthe “trigger” position for the target, and second, the surveillance operators\nthat stand-by ready to tail the target.\nThe trigger position is of central importance, which is why it must be\nparticularly inconspicuous. If this position is occupied by people in a car,\nthe surveillance operators may recline the seats to make themselves more\ncomfortable and less visible from a distance. Or they may do something\nto give themselves a reason to be there, such as reading the newspaper.\nThe trigger position can also be done on foot. In this case, someone may\nsit in a cafe with a view of the target's front door and only briefly signal\nto the rest of the team that the target has left the house.\nIf you see a car with one or two people sitting in it, looking intently in\none direction, you can be relatively certain that you have found the trigger\nposition. Unless it is well camouflaged, this position will normally be at\na distance that gives a good view of the target, but is out of the target's\nimmediate field of vision. This is usually about 40 to 80 meters.\nThe rest of the surveillance operators are at some distance. However, they\nstill need to be close enough to be able to start tailing quickly when nec-\nessary. So they will make sure that they are well positioned in terms of the\nstreet layout and that they can quickly reach the target's possible routes.\nThey are probably around a corner or two, about 200 to 400 meters away.\nIf they take a more relaxed approach, they may gather in several cars, per-\n67\n",

They also need to find places where they\ncan meet and discuss undisturbed, such as dead ends or parking lots.\nThe cars will change positions occasionally. The car that was in the trigger\nposition joins the stand-by cars, and another car assumes the trigger po-\nsition. If finding a parking space is diﬃcult, the first car waits until the car\nreplacing it arrives and then leaves the parking space to its replacement.\nThe following are signs that surveillance may be taking place:\n• Have you seen people staring at a fixed location?\n• Have you seen people wearing earbuds?\n• Have you seen occupied cars parked for several minutes?\n• Have you seen cars (moving or parked) that you suspect are surveil-\nlance cars?\n• Have you heard radio transmissions from cars?\nIf you think you've detected surveillance, the second step is to determine\nthe surveillance target. To find out the location that is under surveillance,\nyou can either look for it directly, i.e. look for an operator watching a spe-\ncific location, or you can think about what is likely to be surveilled in the\narea and then try to detect an operator around those locations. If you don't\nfind the object of your desire, there's not much you can do other than\nwalk around attentively for a while. Without identifying the target, it's\nnot possible to draw conclusions. Accordingly, you should limit yourself\nto making sure they are not targeting you or people or locations you know.\nIf you can detect the trigger position, the next step is to determine what\nthe trigger is watching. Although you know the target must be a certain\ndistance away, you don't know if it's a house, a car, or something else. For\nexample, the target could be a car that is parked 100 meters away, but\nwhich can nonetheless be seen from this distance if it drives oﬀ. You can\nfirst try to rule out possible targets. Rule out all properties in the imme-\ndiate vicinity of the trigger position, i.e. the two to three adjacent house\nentrances, pubs or shops. Keep in mind that it's also possible for a trigger\nin a car to use the rear-view and side mirrors. Despite these clues, it's very\nunlikely that you'll be able to determine the exact target location. At least\nyou can narrow it down to a certain area and, above all, you can assess\n68\n",

What To Do if You Detect Physical Surveillance\nIf you are certain that you have detected surveillance, you will naturally\nwant to know whether it's targeting you. If there is no evidence to the con-\ntrary, you can try to find out more by conducting “counter-surveillance.”\nTo do this, you need a few trusted people who can be observant.

It should not follow the main traﬃc routes\nall the time, but it also shouldn't circle around itself too much, otherwise\nthe surveillance team may simply form a box around it. Short stops can be\nincorporated to make sudden changes of direction plausible. For example,\nfirst you go to a copy shop and copy something, then you turn in the op-\nposite direction and go to a mailbox where you drop something oﬀ. Then\nyou can change direction again and buy a newspaper at a store. It's best to\ndo the route in a car, because then you will be followed by vehicles and not\non foot⁴⁴.

You should also avoid checking yourself, as\nothers will do that for you. Your pursuers should feel as safe as possible.\nYou must communicate your chosen route to your comrades in advance. If\nit seems too risky to meet them in person, you'll have to find another way\nto communicate the details. However, the easiest way is to tell the route\nto people you can meet without issue or raising suspicions, and who are\nvery unlikely to be under surveillance themselves. Your friends will then\nposition themselves as inconspicuously as possible along the route you will\ntake at the specified time. They record exactly when you pass by and what\nfollows behind you: the car's license plate, color, model. The observations\nare then compiled. If you are really being surveilled, the fact that the same\npeople or cars were seen in diﬀerent places will serve as confirmation.\nHowever, it's more likely that your friends will immediately recognize the\nsurveillance operators, because to keep up with you they often have to\nrace through the streets at high speed and disregard traﬃc laws. The most\nimportant thing for the operators is to keep up with you without being\nseen by you. This leaves little room for consideration of other road users.\nOf course, there's always an element of uncertainty. It could be that you\nhave a tracking device on your car, and that's why the surveillance oper-\nators kept their distance (but they're still tailing you!).

Therefore, if you are aﬀected you will have to do a lot of research\nyourself or seek direct contact with comrades who have experience with\nthese matters. Most importantly, you need to work with your own people\nto figure out what works for you and what doesn't.\nWhat You Can Do\nThere are various ways you can behave: you can continue to live as before\nand, if necessary, temporarily refrain from doing risky things.

The advantage of this ap-\nproach is that you can largely ignore the surveillance.

But keep in mind that they may have been watching you for longer\nthan you know, and could therefore notice if your life suddenly changes.\nAlternatively, you can go on the oﬀensive and “burn” the operators who\nfollow you by openly addressing them, taking photos, or the like.

It's tempting to show the op-\nerators that you've detected them and to tell them to go fuck themselves,\nbut you'll probably be trading a short-term sense of accomplishment for\nthe long-term ability to have control over the surveillance operation.\nIn any case, it may make sense to get a lawyer involved.

A sensitive and discriminating judgment is\ncalled for; a skilled intelligence to scent out the truth.\nCarl von Clausewitz, On War, 1832\nIntroduction\nThere is tension anarchists feel between the steps we believe we should take against\nall forms of domination and the consequences we are willing to risk in pursuit of\nthose goals. Repression, either explicitly from the State or implicitly from non-State\nactors, constrains the set of actions we are willing to take, and it primarily does so\nby setting a low ceiling on the “extremeness” of those actions. Extreme actions\ndrive change, and agents of the State know this, so they do what they can to take\naway our most powerful tools.\nBut it is possible to reclaim them.\nWe turn to operational security (OpSec) and security culture as the primary\nmeans of “getting away with it,” or more precisely put: reaching our goals with min-\nimal consequences. These terms are used quite casually, and the practices around\nthem can at times be both opaque and dogmatic even when they contribute to re-\nducing the effects of repression. The phrase “threat modeling” gets thrown around\nwith even less explanation of what it means or how one goes about doing it.1 What\nliterature there is on threat modeling tends to be overwhelmingly focused on secur-\ning corporate IT systems against hackers, and while there are interesting lessons\none can learn from these texts, they require a significant lateral move to be able to\napply them to the average radical on the streets. This zine aims to fill that gap.\nThreat modeling provides the justification for the various practices of OpSec\nand security culture (henceforth just “security” for brevity). Someone might tell\nyou to leave your mobile phone at home for an action, and this isn’t just for funsies,\nbut because phones—even when powered off—leak location data. Every security\npractice and norm should have an evidence-informed threat model behind it with\ntraceability from the observed and inferred actions of the adversaries to the coun-\ntermeasures taken against them. Some practices that have become outdated remain\nbecause of tradition, and new practices that should be adopted often aren’t because\npeople don’t understand the threat landscape in which they operate. Threat model-\ning is how these flaws are identified and resolved.\nThreat modeling can sound like a niche expert field, but it’s something all of us\ndo every day. You might find crafty ways to slack off at work and do so by trying\n1As for what a “threat” even is, for now just think of something an enemy might intentionally do to\nharm you, but we’ll see a slightly more precise definition later.\n",

Your\nboss’s disposition, the presence of security cameras, and tattletale coworkers might\ninfluence your actions, and the amount you slack off might change over time or\neven depending on which shift you’re working. Every day, we ask ourselves what\nmight happen, how likely it is, and what we can do about it, and we adjust our\nbehavior.\nThis zine is written to be accessible by everyone, not just those who already\nhave an interest in security. It assumes that you have no knowledge of security in\nthe context of radical social movements, but also seasoned veterans will find use\nin a more structured discussion of the security practices they already apply. While\nthe general principles of threat modeling that are discussed here can be applied to\nmany scenarios, this zine focuses specifically on resisting repression from local law\nenforcement, intelligence agencies, and fascists both organized and lone wolves.\nThis zine is not a singular authority on how to threat model or what one’s secu-\nrity protocol should look like. Every person is different, every scene has its quirks,\nand every region has its unique threats of cops, fascists, and other dastardly villains.\nThese all change with time. Take what you can from this text, adapt it, and leave\nthe useless or outdated parts behind.\nA small amount of threat modeling can do a great deal to decrease the effects of\nrepression while increasing the range of possible strategies one can use in pursuit\nof their goals. It can be done as a solo exercise, during casual conversation with\ncomrades, or as part of a focused analysis in prep for a major action. Once you\nhave learned this skill, you can be more confident in your ability to reduce the\neffects of repression and you can decrease the strain and overhead when planning\nactions or even just existing as a radical.\nVocabulary\nThreat modeling is a structured process. Thus, we first need a well-defined vocabu-\nlary to ensure a shared understanding of the words we’re using.\nSubject — A subject is a person or group who may be the target of scrutiny,\nrepression, or espionage. It is the entity the threat model concerns. You might be\nthe subject of your own threat model as well as (directly or indirectly) the subject\nof one of your crew’s threat models.\nGoal — A goal is something the subject wants to achieve.2 Goals might be\nthings like “disrupt nazi group X” or “avoid getting doxxed.”\nStrategy — A strategy is a specific set of actions taken by a subject to achieve\ntheir goals. It is the exact path among many possible paths to reach one (or several)\n2Many texts about threat modeling talk about assets that a subject wants to protect, and this makes\nsense when discussing valuables in a safe or data in computer networks. For radicals, we’re generally\nless concerned with physical assets but with intangible ones. Hence, we use the term “goals.”\n",

If you do classic antifascism and your goal is to disrupt\nfash organizing, a strategy you might select is: next Tuesday night, we are going\nto place 500 flyers outing a local chud throughout the neighborhoods where they\nboth live and work.\nAdversary — An adversary is a person or group that wants to prevent a subject\nfrom realizing their goals. Adversaries can be internal (snitches, grifters) or external\n(cops, right-wing street goons). They can be direct (cops) or indirect (false allies,\ncompeting factions).\nCapability — A capability is knowledge, a skill, or an item an adversary has\nthat they may use against a subject to prevent them from achieving their goals.\nCapabilities might be a fleet of motorbikes, the monitoring of live internet traffic\nfrom an ISP, or the ability to use legal or extralegal violence.\nVulnerability — A vulnerability is an aspect of a subject’s life or security pro-\ntocol that can be exploited by an adversary to disrupt their goals or retaliate against\nthem.3 A habit of bragging is a vulnerability as it might cause a subject to leak in-\nformation about past secret actions. Lacking citizenship in the State in which the\nsubject resides (i.e., being able to be deported) can also be a vulnerability.\nThreat — A threat is realistic chance that an adversary exploits a vulnerability.\nIt can be abstract like “someone might hack your computer” or concrete like “nazi\ngroup X will turn up at the next drag event at venue Y.” The adjective “realistic” is\nincluded to keep our scope of investigation narrow. While it is within the State’s\ncapabilities to drone strike you on your way to work, if you are living in the so-\ncalled West, the odds of this—at this time—are near zero, so it is not actually a\nthreat.\nImpact — Impact is a measure of the negative consequences if a vulnerability is\nexploited. A vulnerability that could reveal a subject’s biometric information during\nan action may have high impact (decades imprisonment). A vulnerability that could\nreveal a subject’s typical working hours may have low impact (most people work\nduring the day/evening).\nProbability (of Impact) — The probability of impact is a measure that con-\nsiders both how likely it is that an adversary will attempt a threat and how likely\nit is that it will succeed.4 Surveillance cameras are near certain to be present on\ninteresting properties, and without countermeasures against the such as covering\nyour face or tattoos, they have high probability of having impact. A rent-a-cop\nhappening to drive down a street right as you tag a building might, due to their\nsheer infrequency, have low probability of impact even if them spotting you is near\ncertainty of getting caught.\n3Other literature differentiates between weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and in the context of IT\nsystems this might make sense. A program can have a design weakness that is not a vulnerability. It\nmakes no sense to claim a human has a design weakness in how they live their life under repression.\n4Some methods for threat modeling will use two measures (exploitability and likelihood [of attempted\nthreat]), but for simplicity in this zine, they are reduced to one measure. If you want to split these back\nup for use in ranking threats, by all means do so.\n",

A vulnera-\nbility with extremely high impact that has a realistic but tiny probability of occur-\nring may be considered low risk, but a vulnerability with only moderate impact but\nhigh probability might be considered high risk.\nCountermeasure — A countermeasure is an action taken to reduce risk.5 Coun-\ntermeasures may work to reduce probability by addressing the vulnerability itself,\nor they may address impact by altering adjacent areas of the subject’s life or security\nprotocol. Countermeasures do not need to make risk zero to be worthwhile.\nSecurity Protocol — A security protocol is the set of countermeasures taken\nby a subject given a defined set of adversaries with certain known or assumed capa-\nbilities.6 It might mean the specific OpSec strategies taken during an action and its\npreparatory phase, or it might mean the norms that constitute the security culture\nof a given milieu.\nThreat Model — A threat model is the output of the process of threat modeling.\nIt is a model that enumerates a subject’s goals and strategies, their adversaries and\ncapabilities, and the countermeasures the subject can use against them. The threat\nmodel informs a security protocol that guides the subject’s actions. Sometimes the\nterm is used to mean a specific adversary with known capabilities, for example “our\nthreat model is [against] State domestic intelligence services.”\nThe Basics\nThreat Modeling is the structured process of identifying threats to your goals and\nselecting countermeasures that can be deployed against these threats. The goal of\nthreat modeling is to analyze your behaviors and strategies to learn how you have\nor might expose yourself to repression. There are many ways to threat model, and\nthey all have their advantages and disadvantages. There are some characteristics\nthat all tend to share. Most threat modeling methods in some way answer the\nfollowing questions:7\n1. What are our goals?\n2. How might someone oppose us in them?\n3. What can we do about it?\n4. Is our threat model predictive? And is our security protocol effective?\nThe last point is key because threat modeling isn’t just iterative during a single\n5In other literature, these are called “mitigations,” but due to the extremely active nature of OpSec\nversus simply updating a computer, the term countermeasures seems more appropriate.\n6This is sometimes called “a security plan,” but plans are flexible and often disregarded on a whim. A\nprotocol is something both rigid and demanding, and these are positives. If it is too rigid, it needs to be\ncollectively renegotiated, not ignored at random without alerting others.\n7This is adapted from the Four Question Framework.\n",

It is also iterative over time as its successes or failures become apparent\nwhen it is applied to the real world.\nWhen threat modeling is done well, there are two desirable outcomes: new\nthreats or countermeasures are discovered, and the model trends towards better\npredictive power.8 Even for the most experienced crews, threat modeling should\nreveal something new. If it hasn’t (i.e., if you’re only writing down what you already\nknow), the exercise can still be beneficial in as much as it ensures a shared threat\nmodel and security protocol. Even so, if there are no novel discoveries from threat\nmodeling, more research should be done to uncover unknown threats or superior\nstrategies.\nThe end product of iterated threat modeling needs to be fairly specific. “Create\nanarchy” is not a specific enough goal to be actionable, nor is “someone might spy\non us” a specific enough adversary and capability to defend against. Specificity\nis important not only because it informs us about what we need countermeasures\nagainst, but also what we don’t need countermeasures against. Non-specific goals\nor adversaries can be starting points, but you will need to iterate until they becomes\nspecific.\nYou can threat model alone. Doing so can be helpful because it will allow you to\nidentify the limits to your tolerance for risk as well as the sorts of goals you actually\nwant to pursue. Having goals that do not align with those of your comrades means\nsomeone might be compromising their ideals or desires in order to work with others.\nDiffering tolerances for risk can mean someone will feel anxious—possibly to the\npoint of becoming unreliable—or that someone will feel they aren’t doing enough\nand should be taking bolder action. It is often easier to meditate on your goals and\nrisk tolerance on your own than in front of a group where social pressures and\nbravado can influence you to hide your true preferences. Once you have your own\nmodel, go to your crew and threat model with them. You may learn that you need\nto find a new affinity group, and that’s okay.\nThreat modeling in a group has advantages of being able to use others’ knowl-\nedge to inform the model. Most of what we do is with at least one other person\nwhether it’s handing out pamphlets or making drilling equipment unusable. Indi-\nvidual threat models can have a limit to how well they can inform us because our\ngoals might not actually be the goals of our crew. The security protocol that comes\nout of collective threat modeling might be something that you aren’t comfortable\nwith. You might agree with the crew’s goals and strategies, but might find their\nslipshod approach to security creates an intolerable amount of risk for you.\nYou need to prepare for threat modeling. You probably want to dedicate an\nhour to this if you’re doing it alone and two to four hours if you’re doing it with\na crew. You may need to do multiple sessions because of research that’s needed to\n8Note that this doesn’t say “accurate.” All models have some intentionally built-in inaccuracies be-\ncause infinite precision would lead to models complex beyond human understanding. Accuracy to the\nextend possible is still important as an inaccurate model that wholly does not reflect reality will be\nunable to make meaningful predictions about the actions and reactions of one’s adversaries.\n",

In order to know where and\nhow it’s even safe to threat model, one has to first have a threat model that answers\nthe question: would the State repress us for even having such a discussion?9 There\nmay already be the limitation that places frequented by radicals (your home, a squat,\nan infoshop, etc.) might already under surveillance and could be unsuitable for such\ndiscussions. You may need to do it without electronic devices at an unfamiliar cafe\nor park. Bring paper and something to write with. You may also need to bring a\nlighter because depending on what you’re threat modeling, you may need to destroy\nthe model itself and only save the resulting security protocol.\nOne Particular Method\nThe method described in this section is not “the best,” even to the extent such a thing\nmight even exist. This is just one method that will be discussed in depth enough to\nallow you to design your own. I’m not even attempting to name it to avoid giving\nit excess importance relative to whatever methods you might come up with.\nThis method is goal-oriented. It focuses on what you want to do then applies\nconstraints.10\nIdentify Goals\nIf your goals or desires are unclear, the first step is to materialize them into some-\nthing specific. Start by brainstorming or making a mind map. Write down every\nidea you have on a piece of paper, or alternatively write down each idea on a sep-\narate note card. Don’t worry about feasibility or what can go wrong. Just start\nwriting. Take goals and break them down in to sub-goals or write down prereq-\nuisites you need to reach that goal. Draw connections between related goals or\nsub-goals, or if you’re using note cards, cluster them with each other.\nFor some individuals, their rough goals and methods are already honed from\nhaving been part of radical movements for many years. An affinity group might\nbe operating under the guiding principle of disrupting fascists in their immediate\nvicinity. Time and material constraints might limit their work, so their goals are\nscoped to what they can reasonably achieve while still managing to feed themselves\nand find some joy in life. Identifying goals may be more akin to target selection.\n9This applies generally for all adversaries. If you’re threat modeling leaving an abusive relationship,\nyour partner might spy on you to prevent you from attempting to leave.\n10This is opposed to, say, adversary-oriented threat modeling that focuses on adversaries and their ca-\npabilities then looks at what goals are left available given those constraints. A weakness of the adversary-\noriented approach is that a few infrequent cases of shows of force or lucky breaks in investigation can\ncause us to take those as a baseline of their capabilities. This preemptively cuts off certain avenues of\nattack that we may actually be able to leave open. As we’ll see in the coming sections, assessing the\nprobability of a threat needs to come into play, not just the possibility that it could happen at all.\n",

This might lead to sub-goals of avoiding\ninteractions with police, not drawing attention to one’s self, or gathering enough\nresources to move somewhere safer.\nBecause anarchism is a social movement and not a purely individual pursuit,\nwe implicitly pull in goals that are altruistic towards others.

Identifying adversaries\nand capabilities takes genuine research.\n“Common sense” tells us that as members of an anti-authoritarian social move-\nment our general adversaries are local cops, national security agencies, individual\nright-wing lone wolves, and organized groups of fascists. This same common sense\nsuggests the general shape of their capabilities such as collecting forensic evidence,\nwire tapping, or just plain ol’ violence. The things one might call “common sense,”\nanother might call delusional paranoia, and yet another might dismissively call a\nsimpleton’s idea of the State’s and fascists’ methods of operating. Teasing out what\nof this common sense reflects reality is why we need to do research on each of the\nclaims.\nWhile you may be tempted to write down every alphabet agency that exists\nin your region, there might be little meaningful difference between two national\nintelligence agencies or two local police detachments. There are only a handful of\nlaw enforcement units, and only a handful of fascist groups. They can typically be\ngrouped into buckets like so:\n• State: domestic intelligence, local police.\n• Non-State: groups who strike first, groups who strike back, groups who are\neffectively non-violent.\nHowever, with the use of data sharing and fusion centers, or more generally\nwith the digitization of policing and use of computers to do inhuman amounts of\ndata collating, capabilities might start to blur between intelligence agencies and\nlocal police, so these buckets might in the coming years cease to be as clear or even\nmeaningful.12\nPrune away buckets of adversaries where it is reasonable. As a soup kitchen,\nyou probably aren’t under active investigation by domestic intelligence or the most\nlikely target for deep-cover infiltration.13 Additionally, prune non-State entities.\nRival factions might not attack each other, and for carrying out actions their exis-\ntence may be totally irrelevant. Gangs or mafias might leave you well enough alone\n12For example, the NYPD has the Department Intelligence Bureau which operates outside classical\noversight and has foreign intelligence assets and direct connections to foreign police. Does this make\nthem local police in the classical sense? An intelligence agency? Or something else entirely?\n13They might use a soup kitchen to get a foothold to hop elsewhere in the scene, but the soup kitchen\nitself likely isn’t the primary target.\n",

Estimating risk is no easy\ntask.\nIdentify Countermeasures\nOnce threats are identified, they need to be resolved. To resolve them doesn’t mean\nto solve them in the sense of the problem has been completely handled. A resolu-\ntion is just a conscious decision about what, if anything, is to be done about the\nparticular threat. Threats can be considered resolved in one of four ways.\nAccepted — A threat is accepted if it is decided that nothing can be done about it.\nThe threat is identified, countermeasures are considered, and then if it is determined\nthat the goal or strategy to which the threat applies is too critical to alter or remove\nor that the countermeasures are not feasible given current resources, the threat is\nmarked as accepted.\n",

Threat of geolocation is avoided if you choose a goal\nthat doesn’t ever lead to this type of investigation. The threat is simply gone.\nRemediated — A threat is remediated if the probability of it having an impact\nis reduced. Its root causes are identified, and alterations to the strategy can prevent\nit from occurring in the first place. The threat of arrest via analysis of SMS mes-\nsages collected via dragnet surveillance can be remediated by the use of end-to-end\nencrypted messengers (even if the content of those messages is equally incriminat-\ning). The threat of identification via fingerprints is remediated by wearing durable\ngloves and scrubbing down all items taken to an action (because there will be a\nforensics team, but they will find no fingerprints).\nMitigated — A threat is mitigated if its impact is reduced. It may not be possi-\nble to avoid the threat or reduce its probability in any way, but the severity of its\nimpact may nonetheless be reduced. A strict code of silence mitigates the impact\nof one person in a crew being arrested because that person may still face prison,\nbut the wider impact to the other 6 individuals in the crew is reduced. Having a\nlegal advisor on retainer mitigates the effects of arrest because someone qualified\nis certain to assist you during the investigation.\nThere is not a clear line between remediations and mitigations, but it is helpful\nto think of the two ways risk is countered. We can make it less likely to happen\n(remediated) and/or less impactful when it does (mitigated).\nThere is a fifth non-resolution to threats which is that they are ignored. A threat\nis ignored when it is not known either through ignorance or when the subjects of a\nthreat model choose not to analyze it. For example, a member of a crew that feeds\nthe homeless might call attention to the fact that fascists have been attacking the\nhomeless and their defenders. If the rest of the crew says “that’s not a problem”\nwithout discussing it, this is ignoring the threat, not choosing to accept it. Accept-\ning a threat leads to informed consent about the action. Ignoring a threat does not.\nIn order to identify countermeasures, take your ranked list of threats and use\na mind map to brainstorm possible ways to resolve them. Some countermeasures\nwill apply to multiple threats (see the example in Figure 3). Some threats will need\nmultiple countermeasures to be stacked in order to be resolved. Some countermea-\nsures may be redundant, and this can be a good thing.15 If you have a detailed threat\nlibrary, you may be able to pull countermeasures from it. If not, save the ideas you\nbrainstorm during the session and update the library afterwards. You may need to\ndo research to validate that these countermeasures are sufficiently effective.\nDrawing many lines between nodes on a mind map can lead to clutter. Another\nmethod is to label all your threats with markers like T1, T2, etc. or short labels like\nT-phone-hacK, T-facial-Recognition, etc. Do the same with your countermea-\nsures like C1, C2, etc. or C-no-phone, C-masKs, etc. Make a table of your threats\nand simply list off which countermeasures apply to which threats (Table 3).\n15This is known as “defense in depth” or the “Swiss cheese model.”\n",

New technologies, adver-\nsary tactics, or political landscapes will require reevaluation of the threat model.\nIt may be unsafe to share your exact threat model and security protocol with\nothers, but you should try to engage in general discussions about security to gain\ninsight into what other crews are doing. This can alert you to new trends in what\nyour adversaries do or what your milieu does. You may find that crews you thought\nwere safe to work with are not, or vice versa.\nComments on the Method\nAfter reading through the method, you might say to yourself “holy fuck mate, that\nis complex.” When it’s written down like this, it seems so, but in reality this is\nroughly the heuristic many of us use even if we can’t articulate it. Slowing down\nto name all the steps we might do in a handful of seconds makes it seem more\ncomplex than it really is, and once you’ve become familiar with common threats\nand countermeasures, threat modeling can be very quick and can require less use\nof numbers to assist with prioritization. I’ve seen crews made of veteran radicals\ndevise new security protocols in as little 15 minutes if people are well-informed\nbefore arriving and tolerances for risk are roughly equal. Most of this time is just\nestablishing whether everyone is on the same page, and once it is, quickly writing\ndown the protocol is rather straight forward.\nThat said, threat modeling with this level of specificity and depth can be overkill\nfor many scenarios. A typical process might be to only do cursory research into ad-\nversaries and then realize that other crews who have used similar strategies faced\nminimal repression. The crew might then decide to take standard16 security mea-\nsures like not being overly talkative about it in public or on social media. This is\ncompletely fine.\nSome actions need more focus, and this method is most applicable to those.\nHowever, this process requires practice. To completely nail it on the first try for\na major action is unlikely. If you hope to threat model for something particularly\ninteresting, you probably want to practice this method with your crew for smaller\nthings to get habituated to using the method and to following an explicit security\nprotocol.\nExamples\nTo make the previously discussed process of threat modeling a bit more concrete,\nhere are a few examples. One follows the method somewhat strictly, and this is\nnot because everyone must follow it to the letter, but because it is an intentionally\n16Standard relative to that context both spatially and temporally as well as relative to the “intensity”\nof the actions.\n",

They care about discouraging people from\ndriving large vehicles.\nOnce they have their goals and sub-goals, they think about who would stop\nthem: the police and private individuals (either the owner of the vehicle or outraged\nneighbors). They start making a table of all capabilities these two adversaries might\nhave (Table 4). They mostly use pop culture to understand how people might be\ncaught, and this seems detailed enough for them. This seems fine until one friend\npoints out that some printers leave barely visible yellow dots on pages to identify\nwhich device they were printed from.18 They do a little more research to see if\nthere’s anything else unknown like this.\nOnce they have their threats listed, they give each of them a risk score (Table 5).\nFrom this we can see that the biggest risks according to their model are:\n17Call them libs if you want, but they’ve inspired people to take autonomous direct action instead of\nperformatively getting arrested.

They might want to consider wearing one outfit to a park, swapping to their\nnondescript outfit, stashing their bags, and the continuing to their target. They also\nhaven’t considered that they should be masking on approach to their target.

Like with the caution on research, these too are probably\nunnecessary countermeasures.\nOne thing they haven’t considered is how to reduce the impact of a physical\nconfrontation. Someone mad about their car being “damaged” might get violent.\nHas the group agreed to stay and fight if someone gets grabbed? Should they carry\npepper spray to get their assailants to back of? A common error in threat modeling\nis to only consider the “happy path” and develop countermeasures against threats\nwhen things are going according to plan. They should consider the “sad path” and\ndevelop countermeasures for likely scenarios once things start to go off the rails.\nSimilarly, they haven’t agreed to a code of silence.

TBF was raided by\nthe police on the accusation of distributing seditious material, though the investi-\ngation was halted and no charges were brought against them. TBF plans a meeting\nto figure out if and how it should continue operating, and more specifically what\nthe risks of any decision might be.\nThreat Modeling and Security Protocol\nMembers of the TBF start their threat modeling process by considering what the\npolice are doing, not what their goals are (i.e., they are using adversary-oriented\nmodeling). What they know is:\n• The police were “tipped of” (but may have fabricated the existence of infor-\nmant or the tip entirely) about illegal material at TBF.\n• The police carried out a raid and seized material that may be found to be sedi-\ntious in a court which would implicate the TBF members in criminal activity.\n• Such a raid might happen again.\n• Raids have scared off people who visited the shop.\n• The shop is likely under surveillance (if it wasn’t already).\nTBF has had the nominal goals since its inception of spreading anarchist ma-\nterial and providing a space where anarchist ideas could develop and spread. Be-\ncause each member has different ideas about what constitutes “anarchism,” there\nhave been many different kinds of ideas, some of which conflict. In pursuit of these\ngoals, and each individual’s liberty, they have the implicit goals of not being raided,\narrested, or firebombed by fash.\nAfter a few rounds of debate, TBF has a few proposals to consider for how to\nkeep operating. The collective seems to be splitting in to three factions based on\nwhat they think the best move is.20\n1. Continuation Faction: Stay open exactly as before.\n• Pros: No capitulation to the State, continuing availability of materials, con-\ntinuing support of all local groups.\n20Let’s not assume they chose those names for themselves.

Through cautious conversations with\nfriends and some knowledge of their ideological alignments and tolerances for risk,\nQuinn lets a few people know about a secretive meeting in hopes of assembling a\nsmall crew.\nQuinn meets the potential crew at a park on a Friday evening then walks with\nthem for a few blocks before pulling everyone into a loud pub and taking a booth in\nthe back. Quinn lays out their rough plan of doing an epic prank using what might\nbe described as near maximum security measures to protect themselves during the\nwhole prank process from inception to years past completion. Because Quinn has\npreemptively filtered and vetted potential members, everyone is unsurprisingly on-\nboard, and they begin threat modeling.\nThreat Modeling and Security Protocol\nThe crew starts by roughly laying out phases for what they will need to do to main-\ntain a high level of security against anti-pranksters and other prankster factions\n21This isn’t to say prisoners don’t organize in anarchistic ways, but just that it’s much more con-\nstrained.\n",

Execution: security for the prank itself.\n4. Dissolution: security for the time after the prank has been executed.\nThe crew starts writing down ideas for how they’d get busted during each of the\nphases, things that would be generally true regardless of what strategy they even-\ntually settle on. Their general list of threats are overwhelmingly related to surveil-\nlance and forensics (and in particular digital surveillance). Some of the surveillance\nthreats may already exist for all of them because they are known to be prankster-\naffiliated themselves.\nSome of the threats they list are:\n• Tracking\nindividuals’\nlocations\nvia mobile phones.\n• Reading the crew’s messages via\nhacked phones or computers.\n• Direct audio/visual surveillance of\nthe individuals’ residences.\n• Personal surveillance via agents\non foot or in vans (and also\nCCTVs).\n• Snitches and infiltrators ratting\nthem out.\nAfter writing this down, Quinn’s strategy for selecting meeting spaces becomes\nobvious. Random loud places provide reasonable cover from being tailed, and they\ncan’t be bugged in advance. Since there could be the possibility of them being\nfollowed, they agree to leave well before future meeting times to give them oppor-\ntunities to engage in anti-surveillance drills22 during their journey.\nA second thing they note is that while there are some countermeasure that could\nbe applied to the various kinds of digital surveillance, they choose operate as if\nthey are in a cyber-denied environment (i.e., the risk of being hacked or tracked is\nassumed to be so high that they allow zero use of electronics) because they very well\nmay be.

While they don’t know what their actual prank will be, they assume\nthere will be some sort of investigation into and a possibly an attempted counter\nprank, so to avoid leaving evidence, they agree to use clean procedures for all the\nitems that are acquired to reduce DNA or fingerprints from being left on them.

Their threat model and\nsecurity protocol help them do the best they can, but they know it’s not risk free.\nThat is simply how the game works.\nWhere Threat Modeling Goes\nWrong\nWhen applying any method of threat models and creating security protocols, there\nare certain recurrent classes of failures. Some of these are discussed in the following\nsections.\nOver-Modeling\nOnce one starts, it can be tempting to make the most accurate threat model possible.\nOne can get lost in the details and begin obsessing over every possible contingency\nas they strive to reduce the risk to zero. This will never be possible, and there\nwill always be some risk. This paralysis can be overcome by aiming for goals with\nminimal repression and then working one’s way toward bigger goals. Stickering\nand minor shoplifting can habituate one to acting outside the law. Tagging, banner\ndrops, or deflating SUV tyres teaches one to take covert action in the night. If you\nfind yourself terrified by the perceived might of your adversaries, consider first\nengaging in actions that are known to be minimally repressed.\nUnfeasible Protocols\nOne can make an actionable threat model and devise an effective security proto-\ncol that would allow actions to be taken out with minimal repression. If the new\nprotocol requires far more effort than one’s current protocol, it is unlikely that the\nfull protocol will be able to be implemented. Forgetfulness and old habits are gen-\nuine concerns, and attempting to fully alter one’s behaviors all at once is generally\nnot possible. There will be gaps and errors. Protocols may need to be slowly im-\nplemented either one piece at a time or with increasing complexity, and this may\nmean picking goals or tactics that have fewer threats to begin with. Getting peo-\nple to meet in the dead of night at a precise place and time without phones might\nturn out poorly. It might be easier to practice meeting up to hang out using these\nstrategies to ensure people are punctual and can navigate without online maps.\nLack of Future Thinking\nAnother failure is closing off certain future strategies—or creating intolerable amounts\nof risk—by picking security protocols that leave one open to current surveillance\n",

Civil disobedience that leads to arrest may make it harder to take\nfuture action due to harsher penalties or one’s biometric data being stored in police\ndatabases. One might decide there’s no risk associated with talking about potential\ncrimes because they’ll never actually do them… until one day they realize that do-\ning them is the needed course of action. A question we should all ask ourselves is\nwhether our current security protocol will harm our future self if we ever want to\ngo beyond what we currently do.\nSimilarly, a strategy might call for a relatively lax security protocol, but choos-\ning to use only the minimum security for the assumed threats can create the prob-\nlem that action is constrained. Bringing a phone to a demo that is expected to be\ntame might preclude you from taking radical action if the police get aggressive.\nWhen looking at a protocol, one should consider if there is a reasonable chance\nthat they would want to take further action if a situation changes, and if taking\nsuch action would create a great deal of risk because of the countermeasures that\nwere omitted.\nModeling Instead of Action\nThreat modeling is a slow exercise when it is done thoroughly, but sometimes we\nhave to act quickly. There may be a coup attempt or fascists might riot through the\nstreets, and we will only be able to rely on standard operating procedures. There\nmay not be time to model the situation, and even a quick mental risk assessment\nmight leave you unwilling to act if you aim to keep your total risk at a comfortable\nlow. The tides of risk are rising, and trying to retain your current level of perceived\nsafety will eventually lead you to complete inaction. Not everything can be threat\nmodeled, and there are times when the only thing to do is to act decisively, boldly,\nand quickly. Having established security practices can give you something easy to\nturn to when you need a quick and probably correct solution for a new situation.\nBespoke Threat Models\nAnarchist crews often find themselves reinventing the wheel when it comes to the-\nory, tactics, and organizational strategies. This is generally true, not just in regards\nto security. Sometimes this comes from naïveté in as much as one hasn’t been ex-\nposed to the relevant ideas or texts. In other cases it comes from the arrogance of\none thinking that they or their crew is so special that the ideas espoused by others\ncouldn’t possibly apply to their unique situation. They will go off on their own and\ntry to derive practices and ideas from scratch. On discursive topics like “what is\nthe nature of anarchism itself?” this might quickly lead to convergence toward es-\ntablished ideas. In something that is more technical like security which depends on\nunderstanding underlying tech or observing the actions of law enforcement agen-\ncies, starting from scratch tends to have very slow convergence on established and\nverifiable practices, if it even converges at all.\n",

While it’s true that the specific threats for a given class\nof person in a given place and time might be rather different from others, there are\nstill significant overlaps between them. For information technologies such as com-\nputers, phones, and the internet itself, there is a general uniformity in the threats\nfaced globally. Often what’s needed is to see what threats are actually present in\none’s area and then mapping known countermeasures to them. The answers are\noften straightforward, and convoluted countermeasures and security might sound\nfuckin’ dope and mega spy-like, but often they are based on poor understandings\nof how police or technologies operate, and their complexity can become a point of\npride. There is some notoriety when one holds and demonstrates arcane knowledge,\nand crews can feel superior to others for developing customized protocols that one\none else has.\nAs much as you can, use the knowledge of others to inform your threat model.\nDetermining which models or threat libraries have accurate understandings of the\nworld can be difficult, so the task on this is often verification. Verifying and synthe-\nsizing existing knowledge is far easier and leads to far simpler models and protocols\nthan trying incept everything from the æther.\nIgnoring Future Risk\nThe world is becoming more dangerous, especially to radicals. The most basic rights\nto protest that the State oh-so-generously affords us are being chipped away, and\nminimally disruptive civil disobedience is being increasingly criminalized. New\nthreats to radical action and organizing are appearing, the frequency with which\nexisting threats are deployed is increasing, and the impact of nearly every threat\nis becoming more significant. It cannot be overstated that ignoring future risk by\nmaximizing safety in the present is a recipe for disaster. This is not to say one\nshould quote/unquote “burn the whole fucker down” tomorrow by taking wildly\nrisky action, but that we are right now—in all likelihood—facing far less repression\nthan our future selves in 10 or even 5 years. Building a “perfect” security protocol\nthat slowly and carefully navigates treacherous waters might still leave you ship-\nwrecked in the oncoming storm. Avoiding risk now by taking less frequent or less\nintense action is just deferring that risk to the future.\nThis risk avoidance can happen in a number of ways. One might avoid “big”\nthings because of how highly criminalized they are, but just as well, we might bend\nour existing tactics to avoid minor repression. We might be slightly less open to\noutsiders in hopes of deterring infiltrators, but this harms both current and future\ncapacities. We might avoid shows of solidarity with criminalized groups such as\nnot showing solidarity with Kurdish movements to avoid being prosecuted as “sup-\nporting terrorist organizations” as has recently become the case in so-called Sweden.\nAvoiding risk is a privileged position, and solidarity means taking on some of the\nrisk that is directed at marginalized groups.

Consider the following scenario.\nA crew with 6 members carries out a type of action repeatedly. Each time they\ndo it, each member has a 0.5% chance of getting caught for it. How many times can\nthey do it before there’s a 50% chance of someone getting caught?\nTwenty-three.24\nSomething with a tiny, almost negligible probability of impact done every other\nweek would lead to 50/50 odds of at least one of them being caught in about a year.\nThis doesn’t mean they’re “safe” to do it on Night 1 and that they will only get\ncaught on Night 23. They might get caught on Night 1 or 100, just the odds of it\nhappening “on exactly Night 1” or “never until Night 100” are both very low.\nThis example is simplistic, and you could argue that the more times someone\ndoes something, the better they get at doing it, but just as well, they could get sloppy\nand complacent, or cops could have accumulated evidence with which to bust them.\nEven all this talk of models we’re doing is fraught because we don’t actually know\nwhat’s going on. Much of this is guess work. We don’t know what the probability\nof impact actually is. In the above example, if the probability isn’t 0.5% but 1%, then\nthe crew can only do the action 12 times before they have an over 50% chance of\none or more of them getting caught. Can anyone really accurately estimate the\ndifference between probabilities of 0.5% and 1%? Probably not. Maybe the probably\nis something totally different like 0.1% or 3% (115 or 4 actions before 50/50 odds,\nrespectively).\nEstimating probability is very hard, and getting a gut feeling for repeated risk is\nvery non-intuitive. It’s probably generally helpful to assume that something has a\nrare probability of impact that’s done repeatedly becomes almost certain probability\nof impact if it’s expected there will be 10 or more occurrences.25\nRepercussions from Peers and the State\nWhen organizing, there are unspoken rules about what is considered “correct” by\na given milieu. This can be on topics like how we organize actions, what methods\ncollectives might use for consensus, and what sort of communiques are issued when\nsome new hot topic arises. We are constantly considering what actions to take—at\nall levels—based on the judgement of our peers. When called out—that is when\n24This is a trivial case of the binomial distribution where we ask “what are the odds it never happens?”\nThe formula that yields the answer is: (1 −0.005)6·23 ≈0.5007\n25Why 10?

At the end of the day, what matters is whether\nour goals were reached and if we didn’t get caught. If we follow a security proto-\ncol that is widely used within our milieu, if we get the nods of approval from our\npeers, and then we nevertheless end up in prison, the fact that out peers positively\nappraised our actions is meaningless.\nA security protocol is not there to deflect criticism. It is not there to appease\nthe wishes of your peers. It exists to keep you (relatively) safe while you carry\nout actions that lead you toward your goals. This sounds obvious, but it truly can\nbe a paradigm shift for many. Someone might get busted and decry that “it’s not\nfair” that they got caught because they “did everything right.” It doesn’t matter if\nthey used the protocol everyone else did. They got caught, which means it may have\nbeen insufficiently secure to actually protect them or that the action was inseparable\nfrom a large amount of risk. And again, what is considered “right” by your peers\nversus what is actually going to create security may not be as strongly correlated\nas you might think.\nYour security protocol isn’t about creating an image that others approve of. It’s\nabout genuine security. Do not forget this.\nClosing Remarks\nWhen one learns to draw, they don’t immediately produce life-like illustrations.\nWhat they make are misshapen heads or oddly proportioned critters over a messy\nbackground. With time and practice, they learn to more accurately represent their\nsubjects. The shapes are more representative, and detail is added where needed and\nremoved where unneeded to help shift focus.\nWhen learning to threat model, your model might be clunky and simple, but\nas you practice, it will become more comprehensive and realistic. It’s also okay to\nnever become particularly elegant. As anyone who’s played Pictionary knows, a\nquick drawing with only the most relevant details thrown in is enough to win a\nround. Sometimes people who can only make shitty sketches beat out artists who\nget hung up on complete representation. A simple threat model that identifies a\nfew highly relevant things can be superior to a monstrously complex web of every\npossible contingency.\nThreat modeling is an iterative process. Maybe there’s only a single iteration\nand you call it good enough, or it’s something you continuously come back to. Oth-\ners’ threat models can inform your own, especially through the intelligence they’ve\ngathered on shared adversaries. You might refine you threat model periodically or\nafter any observed deficiencies.

Security nihilists believe—like the maximalists—that our ad-\nversaries are inhumanely powerful, but instead of trying to win the security arms\nrace against them, the nihilists say that no amount of security can overcome the\nthreat, so why bother?\nI make a point of not knowing what activities anyone is actually doing, so I\ncan’t say for certain, but with some anecdata and intuition, it seems that security\nmaximalists, minimalists, and nihilists aren’t actually doing much of consequence.\nThose who do like to get spicy tend to have a much more nuanced take on security.\nWhich is to say, regard extreme opinions with due caution.\nPerhaps most importantly, threat modeling and the generated security proto-\ncols are only useful if they can actually be applied in real life and if they help\nyou achieve your goals. A security protocol that is too cumbersome to actually\nbe executed is useless no matter how well designed it is. Partial execution of the\nprotocol in pursuit of the goals can create more risk than you intended. Similarly, a\nwell-designed and easy-to-apply protocol that makes it near impossible to actually\nreach your goals indicates either a design or strategic flaw, or it indicates that your\ngoals and your tolerance for risk are not compatible. This may mean restarting the\nthreat modeling process, changing your goals, or finding ways to habituate yourself\nto risk and build up a tolerance.\nHopefully by reading this you can see why structured processes for evaluating\nrisk exist. The world of secrecy and insurgency in which we operate is complex. We\nare constantly shrouded in the fog of war. Threat modeling can help part this shroud\nand give us a little more insight so that our actions can be done with confidence.\nWe may still get caught, and there is no world in which all of us avoid repression.\nThe stakes are high, but applying a bit of knowledge shifts the odds in our favor.\n",

As far as we know, it first appeared in their book Recipes \nfor Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook and then appeared in a slightly updated form \nin 2009 on their website, Crimethinc.com.  \n \nWe’re reprinting this because the information contained within cannot be shared \nenough within our communities. Over the past several years, we’ve seen various \ninstances of anarchists getting serious federal charges. Eric McDavid was \nentrapped by a federal informant — Anna — with whom he hatched a plot to blow \nup a dam and was later sentenced to several years in prison. At the 2008 protests \nagainst the Republican National Convention (RNC), several folks were entrapped \nby federal informants — Bradley Crowder, David McKay, and Matthew Depalma. \nWhile one certainly can’t say that more easily accessible information on security \nculture would have prevented these situations, it seems that the more widely \navailable the information is the safer we will all be. \n \nWe chose to reprint this guide specifically because it focuses on general principles \n— rather than specific tactics — necessary to building secure communities of  \nresistance. Please read this guide, share it, enact these principles in your life, and \nexplain them to people who aren’t familiar with them. Most importantly, please, \nplease take security culture seriously.  \n \nFinally, folks would also do well to do some additional research on the subject of \nsocial networking and computer security. As computers dominate more and more \nof our lives, it is important that folks think about the risks that their use can pose \nfor those in conflict with the state.  \n \nLove and Rage, \nSprout Anarchist Collective // www.sproutac.org \n \n \n",

    "chunk_full": "What is Security Culture? \nA security culture is a set of customs shared by a             \ncommunity whose members may \nbe targeted \nby \nthe            \ngovernment, designed to minimize risk. \nHaving a security culture in place saves everyone the trouble of having to work \nout safety measures over and over from scratch, and can help offset paranoia and \npanic in stressful situations—hell, it might keep you out of prison, too. The \ndifference between protocol and culture is that culture becomes unconscious, \ninstinctive, and thus effortless; once the safest possible behavior has become \nhabitual for everyone in the circles in which you travel, you can spend less time \nand energy emphasizing the need for it, or suffering the consequences of not \nhaving it, or worrying about how much danger you’re in, as you’ll know you’re \nalready doing everything you can to be careful. If you’re in the habit of not giving \naway anything sensitive about yourself, you can collaborate with strangers without \nhaving to agonize about whether or not they are informers; if everyone knows \nwhat not to talk about over the telephone, your enemies can tap the line all they \nwant and it won’t get them anywhere. \nThe central principle of all security culture, the point that \ncannot be emphasized enough, is that people should never be \nprivy to any sensitive information they do not need to know. \nThe greater the number of people who know something that can put individuals or \nprojects at risk—whether that something be the identity of a person who \ncommitted an illegal act, the location of a private meeting, or a plan for future \nactivity—the more chance there is of the knowledge getting into the wrong hands. \nSharing such information with people who do not need it does them a disservice as \nwell as the ones it puts at risk: it places them in the uncomfortable situation of \nbeing able to mess up other people’s lives with a single misstep. If they are \ninterrogated, for example, they will have something to hide, rather than being able \nto honestly claim ignorance. \nDon’t ask, don’t tell. \nDon’t ask others to share confidential information you don’t need to know. Don’t \nbrag about illegal things you or others have done, or mention things that are going \nto happen or might happen, or even refer to another person’s interest in being \ninvolved in such activities. Stay aware whenever you speak; don’t let chance \nallusions drop out thoughtlessly. \n \n",

This also means being comfortable with others not answering \nquestions: if there’s a conversation they want to keep to themselves, or they ask \nyou not to be part of a meeting or project, you shouldn’t take this personally—it’s \nfor everyone’s good that they’re free to do so. Likewise, don’t participate in any \nprojects you don’t feel good about, or collaborate with anyone you feel ill at ease \nwith, or ignore your gut feeling in any situation; if something goes wrong and you \nget into trouble, you don’t want to have any regrets. You’re responsible for not \nletting anyone talk you into taking risks you’re not ready for. \nDon’t ever turn your friends over to your enemies. \nIf captured, never, ever give up any information that could endanger anyone else. \nSome recommend an explicit oath be sworn by all participants in a direct action \ngroup: that way, in a worst-case scenario, when pressure might make it hard to \ndistinguish between giving up a few harmless details and totally selling out, \neveryone will know exactly what commitments they made to each other. \nDon’t make it too easy for your enemies to figure out what \nyou’re up to. \nDon’t be too predictable in the methods you employ, or the targets you choose, or \nthe times and places you meet to discuss things. Don’t be too visible in the public \naspects of the struggle in which you do your most serious direct action: keep your \nname off mailing lists and out of the media, perhaps avoid association with \naboveground organizations and campaigns entirely. If you’re involved in really \nserious clandestine activities with a few comrades, you may want to limit your \ninteractions in public, if not avoid each other altogether. Federal agents can easily \nget access to the phone numbers dialed from your phone, and will use such lists to \nestablish connections between individuals; the same goes for your email, and the \nbooks you check out from libraries, and especially social networking sites like \nFacebook. \nDon’t leave a trail: credit card use, gas cards, cell phone calls all leave a record of \nyour motions, purchases, and contacts. Have a cover story, supported by verifiable \nfacts, if you might need one. Be careful about what your trash could reveal about \nyou—dropouts aren’t the only ones who go dumpstering! Keep track of every \nwritten document and incriminating photocopy—keep them all in one place, so \nyou can’t accidentally forget one—and destroy them as soon as you don’t need \nthem. The fewer there are in the first place, the better; get used to using your \nmemory. Make sure there aren’t any ghosts of such writing left behind in \nimpressions on the surfaces you were writing on, whether these be wooden desks \nor pads of paper. Assume that every use of computers leaves a trail, too. \n",

Ask \npeople to outline for you their specific security needs before you even broach the \nsubject of direct action. \nLet others know exactly what your needs are when it comes to \nsecurity. \nThe corollary of abiding by others’ expectations is that you must make it easy for \nothers to abide by yours.

Those \nwho violate the security culture of their communities should not be rebuked too \nharshly the first time—this isn’t a question of being hip enough to activist \ndecorum to join the in-group, but of establishing group expectations and gently \nhelping people understand their importance; besides, people are least able to \nabsorb constructive criticism when they’re put on the defensive. Nevertheless, \nsuch people should always be told immediately how they’re putting others at risk, \nand what the consequences will be should they continue to. Those who can’t grasp \nthis must be tactfully but effectively shut out of all sensitive situations. \nSecurity culture is not paranoia institutionalized, but a way to \navoid unhealthy paranoia by minimizing risks ahead of time. \nIt is counterproductive to spend more energy worrying about how much \nsurveillance you are under than is useful for decreasing the danger it poses, just as \nit is debilitating to be constantly second-guessing your precautions and doubting \nthe authenticity of potential comrades. A good security culture should make \neveryone feel more relaxed and confident, not less. At the same time, it’s equally \nunproductive to accuse those who adhere to security measures stricter than yours \nof being paranoid—remember, our enemies are out to get us. \nDon’t let suspicion be used against you. \nIf your foes can’t learn your secrets, they will settle for turning you against each \nother. Undercover agents can spread rumors or throw around accusations to create \ndissension, mistrust, and resentment inside of or between groups. They may falsify \nletters or take similar steps to frame activists. The mainstream media can \nparticipate in this by reporting that there is an informant in a group when there is \nnot one, or misrepresenting the politics or history of an individual or group in \norder to alienate potential allies, or emphasizing over and over that there is a \nconflict between two branches of a movement until they really do mistrust one \nanother. Again, a shrewd security culture that fosters an appropriately high level of \ntrust and confidence should make such provocations nearly impossible on the \npersonal level; when it comes to relations between proponents of different tactics \nand organizations of different stripes, remember the importance of solidarity and \ndiversity of tactics, and trust that others do, too, even if media accounts suggest \notherwise.

Here’s an example of different levels of \ncommunications security, corresponding to the system just outlined above: \n1. \nNo communication about the action except in person, outside the homes of those \ninvolved, in surveillance-free environments (e.g. the group goes camping to \ndiscuss plans); no discussion of the action except when it is absolutely necessary.     \n2. \nOutside group meetings, involved individuals are free to discuss the action in \nsurveillance-free spaces. \n3. \nDiscussions are permitted in homes not definitely under surveillance. \n4. \nCommunication by encrypted email or on neutral telephone lines is acceptable. \n5. \nPeople can speak about the action over telephones, email, etc. provided they’re \ncareful not to give away certain details—who, what, when, where.  \n6. \nTelephones, email, etc. are all fair game; email listservs, fliering in public spaces, \nannouncements to newspapers, etc. may or may not be acceptable, on a case-by-\ncase basis.    \n7. \nCommunication and proclamation by every possible medium are encouraged.  \nIf you keep hazardous information out of circulation and you follow suitable \nsecurity measures in every project you undertake, you’ll be well on your way to \nfulfilling what early CrimethInc. agent Abbie Hoffman described as the first duty \nof the revolutionary: not getting caught. All the best in your adventures and \nmisadventures, and remember—you didn’t hear it from us! \n",

Police can read SMS messages, so your crew uses an encrypted\nchat app. Local fascists might learn your identity and show up at your home\nor place of employment, so you use a fake name and pseudonymous online\naccounts. Counter-protesters at a nazi march might get arrested, but the\nrisk of rising fascism is greater, so you accept the risk of arrest and put your\nbody on the line.\nWe’ve picked up many of these OpSec1 tips in a piecemeal fashion as we\njoined activist circles. Maybe your first experience with security was being\nasked to leave your mobile phone in a box outside the room where a meeting\nwas taking place. Or maybe it was being told to hide your face from right-\nwing press at a demonstration. Many people feel that their involvement in\nliberatory movements does not necessitate much security, so they’ve never\ndeveloped holistic security practices.\nOf the many who do recognize the\nneed for security, these practices have become so habitual that they happen\nwithout conscious thought.\nIt is rare that there are paradigm shifts in our security practices either\nbecause of changing circumstances or new technologies. These things often\nhappen slowly and in ways we don’t notice until we retrospect over long\nperiods of time. We don’t have the opportunity to see a drastic change and\ncompare how things were before and after.\nIn our daily lives we have at least an inkling of a concern about our\nprotecting our health from disease. We wash our hands after we go to the\nloo or take our shoes off in the entryway of our flats. Many such practices\ncan be cultural, and they are often habits we picked up one at a time but\nhardly think about.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a shock to many people who previ-\nously were rather lax about protecting themselves from diseases like the flu\nor common cold. In a short period of time, the majority of us went from hav-\ning no real threat model of how we might get sick or what the consequences\nwere, to being acutely aware of a threat that was all around us. Most were\nunaware of how many died yearly from the cold, if they even knew it was\nkilling people at all. The new threat to our health from the corona virus\nforced us to make massive changes to our perception of the world and our\nbehavior as we navigated it.\nSecurity is often taught via analogy. Encryption is explained by describ-\ning two parties sending letters to each other via some special kind of post.\nWhen we talk about the security of the individuals in a group who live in\ndisparate locations, we use metaphors about the physical security of a build-\ning. The aphorism “all models are wrong, some are useful” comes from the\nstatistician George Box who nearly a decade before more eloquently said:\n1Operational security.\n",

The descriptions of the pandemic focus\non how it was experienced in Europe. Some of the experiences that will be\ndescribed are rather generalizable. Others may be less so as they are the\nexperiences of my particular radical circles.\nThere are many definitions for security culture and OpSec, so to provide\nclarity I’m using the two definitions here as this is generally how they are\nused by activists.\nSecurity culture is the set of norms with a social group or\nmovement designed to counter surveillance and disruption either\nfrom the State or private entities such as militias, far-right gangs,\nor corporations.\nOperational security is the set of specific practices an individ-\nual can take that reduce surveillance and disruption.\nLeaving your phone at home for an action is OpSec. Your aﬀinity group\nnormalizing the practice that everyone leaves their phone at home is security\nculture.\nPandemic Pods and Aﬀinity Groups\nEarly in the pandemic, we were encouraged to form pandemic pods, or rather\nclosed social groups. The idea behind these closed groups rather than the\nnaturally forming webs of human connection was to limit the spread of the\ndisease. If one person in a pod got infected, the whole pod might get infected\ntoo, but it would be limited to just the few people within that pod. While\nthis practice complicated by living situations (those with roommates) and\nworking situations (those who couldn’t work form home), it still provided\none way of limiting the spread.\nGoals of security culture are to reduce information leaks, prosecutions,\nand violence faced by its practitioners.\nAﬀinity groups (AGs) are closed\n",

Loosely networked AGs exist in opposition to classic or-\nganization structures like political parties or NGOs. Leadership in classical\nstructures often has an overview of all members including what they are do-\ning, and members may shuffle between working groups or task forces within\nthese structures.\nInfiltrators and informants can rise in the ranks to see\neverything or float through the working groups collecting information on ev-\neryone because they are granted implicit trust by merely being a member of\nthe organization.

There was not just one panacea, but many steps we\nwere told to take. Each of these on their own contributes to decreased viral\ntransmission, though some more than others. If an individual enters a shared\nspace with only a surgical mask, they may still be significantly protected by\neveryone else wearing FFP2 masks. If everyone wears only surgical masks,\nthey are once again protected by ventilation and air filters in the building.\nDefense in depth means using more than just one control against a single\nthreat. Sometimes these controls are additive such as when two individuals\nwear masks, the first has a lower chance of being infected by the second\nthan if only the first or second alone wore a mask. Sometimes these controls\nare simply redundant such as disinfecting surfaces, frequent hand-washing,\nand avoiding touching one’s face while out in public. These controls pro-\ntect against the same vector, namely infection via transmitting the virus to\nmucous membranes after touching surfaces that are infectious. If someone\ndoesn’t wash their hands, keeping surfaces clean still protects them. If some-\none breaks the habit of frequently touching their face, the risk of infection\nfrom going long periods of time without hand-washing is also reduced.\nLikewise, good OpSec and security culture use defense in depth to prevent\ninformation leaks or disruption.

The routine of\nhand-washing upon returning home may have become hand-washing “only if\nI think I touched something gross.” Consciously avoiding indoor gatherings\nmay have slipped into justifying going out to a friend’s no-mask birthday\nparty. This phenomenon has been called “pandemic fatigue.” Sometimes\npeople stop following preventative measures because they simply don’t want\nto or find them fucking annoying. Other times it’s the belief that they earned\na cheat day by being so good for so long. Some people see the pandemic as\nnever-ending and can no longer rationalize giving up so much for so little\nperceived benefit.\nI’m not claiming that our FOMO7 is baseless. We’ve all given up on\nattending weddings or funerals, hosting birthday parties, or traveling to see\nfriends and family. How many regular social activities like hanging out at\nhome, going to a favorite pub, or spontaneously catching a movie have we\nmissed in the last two years? It’s not even just the voluntary measures we’ve\ntaken, but seeing that others aren’t taking them, so why should we suffer\nwhile they go out and party? Maybe it’s even seeing the intentionally poor\nresponse of the ruling class that makes so many of our individual efforts seem\nworthless.\nBut just because we’re tired and burned out doesn’t mean the pandemic\nis over. This winter has been particularly harsh for many of us: a second\nwinter into the pandemic after the summer that wasn’t, all with the backdrop\nof pandemic-related scandals, soaring infections, and sustained fatalities.\nOpSec fatigue is just as real.\nNearly every security measure we take\nhas some cost.\nAbandoning WhatsApp after they changed their privacy\npolicy meant losing out on communication with those who hadn’t switched\nto Signal.\nLeaving phones at home for actions complicates coordination.\nUsing multiple devices for multiple aliases means more shit to constantly\nlug around with you. Refusing to organize direct actions with people who\nhave poor security practices leads to conflict in meetings or solitudinous\nactions.\nBecause of these costs—either material or “merely” mental—people often\nrelax their security standards, but the threat of surveillance and disruption\ndo not disappear because we lose interest.\nThe longer one is in radical\nmovements, the more they tend feel the pressure of external threats. This\nstress can make it hard to maintain the desired level of security. There’s\nalso the mistaken belief that actions taken during periods of relaxed security\nnot leading to arrest is proof that the reduce security is still secure enough.\n7Fear of Missing Out.\n",

Even if the chances of getting\nthe disease is low, people may weigh these preventative measures as being\ntoo costly and accept what they see as tiny a risk of life-altering outcomes.\nSecurity is also a case where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound\nof cure. The bother of getting all your contacts to switch to an end-to-end\nencrypted chat app might have some upfront and upkeep costs, but this\neffort is drastically lower than the response necessary after being prosecuted.\nDressing in Black Bloc at actions and having clothing to change in to when\ntraveling to and from the action can be bothersome—especially in summer’s\nheat—but this is a small price to pay compared to the damages of being\narrested or doxxed with possible subsequent stalking and harassment. Every\narrest that is prevented means more time legal aid can spend on other cases.\nEvery comrade who doesn’t have to move flats because of fascist harassment\nis funds that can be redirect to the community. Every imprisonment that is\navoided means a healthier community that isn’t mourning the abduction of\na comrade and exerting effort for appeals or prison support.\nLike we saw early in the pandemic, one of the goals was to “flatten the\n",

If there was even some Universal Truth\nthat all activists had some fixed chance of imprisonment, it would be best\nto spread this over a longer time thus giving them more time to act before\nbeing taken off the board and more time to gather resources to support them.\nThis certainly isn’t the case, but the goal should be to prevent and delay\nconsequences of repression as long as possible.\nEven when looking at the State level, many of the justifications for avoid-\ning the upfront costs were to avoid economic downturn from lockdowns and\nmissed work. The result of poor containment was that these consequences\nhappened anyway.

The benefit of a strong security culture outweighs\nthe near-term costs of developing it in the first place.\nSecurity Theater, Expectations, and Nonadher-\nence\nSome initial measures taken to slow the spread of the virus were ineffective\nbecause they were based on poor or missing information. Individuals who\ncared about managing the spread of the virus wanted quick solutions, and\noften this was in the form of superficial measures that gave feeling of effort\nrather than tangible results. Policy makers wanted to show strength and\nthat were were doing something, so they did anything at all.\nIneffective\ncountermeasures that give merely a feeling of security or action taken are\ncalled security theater. In the case of the pandemic, we saw this with use\nof chin-strap sneeze guards rather than masks, or the use of disposable ni-\ntrile gloves when out in public yet the wearer still constantly touched their\nface. Other larger instances of security theater were spraying disinfectants\ninto the air from vehicles or requiring masks while walking through sparsely\npopulated public parks.\nSecurity theater in its original sense is often present as a significant influ-\nence on security culture. Often this is done by either intentional or acciden-\ntal conflation of “feeling unsafe” and “being in danger.” Safe spaces—in the\nsense that they feel safe regardless of risk—are often needed for healing, and\nthis is not decrying them, but inaccurately naming threats for many spaces\nis security theater. Queer spaces that don’t allow “straight” partners as a\nmeans to keep out the abusive cis-hets is security theater (because queer\npeople can be abusers too, obviously).

These days it seems that it\nis becoming a buzz word, along with the word cryptoanarchy. For this reason I\nthought it would be interesting to sit down with two known thinkers, but more\nimportant doers, from the “scene” and discuss these topics with them. To keep\nit in style, the interview was conducted on the oldest darknet IRC server2 there\nis, home of both Frank Braun and Smuggler, and one of my favorite virtual\nhangouts.\nTatjana Adamov: Smuggler, your “Project of Cryptoanarchy”3 talk\nat HCPP18 was one of the most discussed talks that year, it sparked\ngreat interest and you were even asked to give that talk again at the\nopening of Paralelna Polis in Bratislava. Tell me, what made you give\nthat talk and what was your goal?\nSmuggler: I gave the talk because I had the feeling that cryptoanarchy had\nbecome a brand, a word without meaning. That there’s too little thought about\nthe core ideas that make cryptoanarchy so interesting, at least for me. That\nso many diﬀerent things are all put into the cryptoanarchy label, even if they\nconﬂict with each other. I just wanted to go back to why cryptoanarchism is\nabout cryptography and anarchism, and how the two actually relate.\nTatjana Adamov: In your talk you introduced yourself as an operator\nof darknet communities and infrastructures? What have you learned\nfrom doing that?\nSmuggler: The main learning curve for me has been how to run, grow and\nmaintain communities. They don’t just happen but have to be nurtured by\npeople that invest in the community for the sake of the community. This is a lot\nof eﬀort with questionable returns. One aspect there is that communities form\n1https://fragment-x6.net/posts/why-cryptoanarchy-is-not-a-revolutionary-movement/\n2https://anarplex.net/agorairc/\n3https://opaque.link/post/projectofcryptoanarchy/\n1\n",

The modeling by founding members of a community must be highly\nengaged, welcoming, and open to adaption. Founding members must also be\nactive in helping new people to become engaged in a true and meaningful way,\nby giving them responsibility and power to inﬂuence and decide. There have\nalso been things that genuinely surprised me. People have surprised me in good\nand bad ways. A particular bad way has been that I had to realize how many\npeople are just mad, confused, or destructive. They use anonymous communities\nto vent their anger, frustration and lust for power. I never before realized that\nthis issue is so wide spread with so many people, and it concerns me. But the\nreverse is also true. I have been surprised by people who genuinely try to grow,\nand how many people are just awesome - on a purely human, emphatic level.\nAnd just to make it clear, I don’t operate any darknet markets.\nTatjana Adamov:\nYou emphasize social and psychological aspects.\nCan you elaborate why you don’t mention technical aspects?\nSmuggler: Darknet technology is an enabler for human interaction. It allows\nhuman interaction to take a diﬀerent form from that what we are used to from\nthe physical/real world (meatspace). Anonymity changes things. It changes\nwhat you learn about people, how you interact with them, and als how you look\nat yourself. The fascinating and challenging aspect is when communities and\nsocieties are built around anonymity. That is where things get really exciting\nfor me. You’ll meet interesting minds and characters that are unusually open,\npeople you can connect to and enjoy interacting with. Because the fear of shame\nand punishment is reduced - everybody is anonymous after all. No attribution!\nThe width of characters in anonymous communities is thus very interesting. You\ncan witness people going from being copy-cats of social models in meatspace\nto people experimenting with becoming themselves. They become more true,\nfor good and worse. Of course that leads to the extremes to stick out, and gain\nattention. The real beauty however is all those that are between the extremes,\nthat are just as human as you are, everybody shedding social expectations that\nhave no meaning in anonymous communities.\nTatjana Adamov: What is the connection between the cryptoanar-\nchy scene and darknet communities, how do they relate, apart from\ntechnology?\nSmuggler: It’s not easy to put cryptoanarchy and darknet communities in\none sentence without being oversimplifying or raising false expectations. Both\nhave their interest for anonymity technology in common, but the people on the\ndarknet are more about using them than about building and speculating about\nthem. Self-identifying and outspoken cryptoanarchists certainly are members of\ndarknet communities, but they aren’t the majority. And a lot of cryptoanarchists\ndon’t use darknet communities at all. The cryptoanarchist scene seems to me\nto be much more superﬁcial, revolving around technology and marketing more\nthan around groups that enjoy having relationships on a human level.

Maybe\na simpliﬁed view would be that darknet communities are a mix of people that\njust use cryptography and anonymity technology to form communities around\nunrelated ideas, while cryptoanarchists often just build technology according to\ntheir vision, but fail to build coherent communities of people. It is rare to see\ncryptoanarchist visionaries to be part of darknet communities. And it is rare to\nsee darknet communities that have social vision.\nTatjana Adamov: This sounds as if cryptoanarchists built darknet\ntechnologies to implement their social visions, but darknet commu-\nnities have not picked up this vision at all. Why do you think that\nis?\nSmuggler: It’s not just cryptoanarchists that built darknet technologies, there\nare other and unrelated motivators to invest in this.\nBut you are right in\nthat the cryptoanarchist contribution hasn’t been widely picked up in darknet\ncommunities. There are multiple reasons for that, I’ll just pick up a few. A\nstrong one is that darknet communities are often special interest groups that just\nuse anonymity without caring a bit about social or political questions. The other\nis that darknet “thought” of anonymity can become stiﬂing for action outside of\nthe darknet. Darknet communities often have the deep belief that there should\nnever be any real life/meatspace interaction. Because that would endanger the\nanonymity of the participants. They are paranoid about physical security. But\nthis can lead to becoming cowards, and a lot of them are. They run from risk\ninstead of learning how to deal with it. It is necessary however to take risks to\nhave any impact whatsoever. And you have to interact in the physical to reach\nthe whole of what it means to be human. Purely faceless anonymous digital\ncommunication cannot capture all aspects of being a social being. Darknets are\nnot themselves, and not alone, eﬃcient for social experimentation and growth.\nThey aren’t suﬃcient for that. We have to have both darknet, and meatspace,\nand learn how to bring darknet-grade security into the physical world as well.\nTatjana Adamov: In your talk, and now, you mention non-attribution\nas being important. How would you deﬁne it, and do you think we’ll\nbe able to deal with it?\nSmuggler: Non-attribution is the core concept of cryptoanarchy. It means that\nactions, data, objects etc cannot be attributed to a person by a third party.\nThat is what the cryptography part of cryptoanarchy is primarily about. The\nmoment actions cannot be attributed to a person anymore, the whole system\nof rulership by threat, judgment and punishment breaks down. However, this\nalso leads to problems, because we do not know yet how to have justice and\nsecurity without attribution. We rely on attribution because we always had it,\nand never had to think about what happens if we don’t. I believe that many\nnegative issues of non-attribution can be overcome while keeping the positive\naspects. This requires work, ingenuity, discovery. We’ll have to ﬁgure it out by\n3\n",

I personally ﬁnd it important that\neven in a techno-centric society we criticize the technology we build,\nso I ﬁnd your two talks very important.\nThe question is: do you\nthink everything produced by people claiming to be cryptoanarchists\nis inherently good?\nFrank Braun: Of course not everything produced by somebody claiming to\nfollow a certain philosophy is good. Unless every new technology is good and\nthat’s hardly the case. I think every new technology has to be evaluated for\nits merits, independently of the person or entity producing it. Some questions\nto ask here are: Does this technology bring out the best in humans or does it\nmake us more machine like? Does it allow more freedom or is it just a means\nto enslave us? Does it help with creative self-expression or is it just built to be\nmaximally addictive in order to drive ad revenue? Some technologies can be\nclearly categorized into good or bad, but for others it depends more on what\nyou use it for (the kitchen knife example comes to mind).\nTatjana Adamov: How do you two relate to the whole blockchain,\nsmart contracts, anti banking ideas?\nFrank Braun: Short answer: Smart contracts are a dumb idea. Long answer:\nIf you produce software that automatically rules over humans with the goal\nof eﬃciency (that’s what smart contracts are) you are producing technological\ntotalitarianism. There is no human anymore that could bend the rules and there\nisn’t even any authority to appeal to left. If your social score is too low to get\non the airplane then that’s that. This is not a glorious technological future\nwithout intermediaries, it’s dehumanizing technology in action. I think being\n“anti-banking” focuses too much on the wrong issues. Banks are not the major\nproblem.\nTatjana Adamov: Wouldn’t you say it’s ironic that cryptoanarchist\nideas seem totalitarian, when at the same time their proponents claim\nto ﬁght for liberty and freedom?\nFrank Braun: I think the label “cryptoanarchy” has been watered down a\nlot in recent years, because it became “en vogue”, in large parts due to the\nblockchain craze. In my view “cryptoanarchy” was always about anarchy (as in\n“no ruler”) by the means of cryptography, most importantly technologies that\nprovide anonymity. Very important here are anonymous communication and\npayment methods, because these technologies strike at the root of the repression\n4https://frankbraun.org/talk/dehumanizing-technology/\n5https://frankbraun.org/talk/the-cryptoanarchy-technology-pyramid/\n4\n",

Cryptoanarchy is about providing more freedom for\nthe people that want it, without interfering with the lives of others. Devising\nanonymized means to kill people for a “good cause” (assassination markets) is not\ncryptoanarchy, it is just plain evil. Using technological tools to start a revolution\nis not cryptoanarchy either, it is the imposition of a new method of rulership on\na ruled population. Revolutions, with the help of technology or not, have two big\nproblems: The new ruling class coming into power after a revolution is usually\nworse than the one it replaces. It seems to be impossible to create a “better”\nsystem when you start with ethical dubious means (a revolution implies that).\nAnd even more importantly, what if the revolutionized population doesn’t want\nto be revolutionized? Who gives you the right to change their system of rulership\nby force? Cryptoanarchy is about creating a parallel alternative which does not\ndestroy the surrounding power structure and tries to live in harmony with it.\nThere are many successful historic examples of this (ethnic minorities with their\nown communities, legal structures, business frameworks, etc.). Cryptoanarchy\nsimply brings this concept into the technological and virtual sphere, although\nit also has a big physical aspect to it. Of course, if “cryptoanarchy” would\nspread wide and far this would have secondary consequences on the surrounding\nstructures, as every major technology shift has. But it doesn’t force anything on\nanyone.\nTatjana Adamov: Why do you think people are reluctant to take the\napproach of parallel systems, and would rather support something\nmore radical, for example Amir Taaki’s Academy?\nFrank Braun: Good question. I think a destructive approach (revolution) is\noften more appealing than a constructive one. A destructive approach requires\nonly an enemy, a constructive one requires a vision of something “better”. And\nif you have such a vision you have that vision it is very easy to think that the\nexisting situation has to be revolutionized ﬁrst before the “better” solution can\nbe implemented. And even if you have a “better” vision, it is not clear that it is\nreally better until you have implemented it. Even less clear is the question, if\nit is better for your neighbor as well. That’s why it is better to try alternative\nsolutions in parallel to the existing ones and ﬁnd out if they are really that much\nbetter, at least for some. This also prevents a (technological) monoculture which\nhas all the problems that come with monocultures.\nSmuggler: I would add to that the issue of impatience. People do feel pain,\nthey feel oppressed and powerless in the face of the systems they live in and\ncannot adapt to. This leads to the wrong conclusion that the pain goes away\nwhen the system is brought down. But that is not the case. You have to have\nsomething in its place. That something, a new way of doing things, has to be\nbuilt ﬁrst, with all its tedious aspects. It requires building social, cultural and\nlegal frameworks, none of which can be created by ﬁat but have to be discovered\nand constructed by a community of people, a society. Otherwise, after revolution,\nyou end up with nothing at all, except for smoldering ruins. However, the appeal\n5\n",

Will you consider taking unethical steps to quicken its demise, without\nconsidering the cost to those not involved, to those that are on the receiving\nend of your decisions? Impatience, wrongly assigned life purpose, and lack of\nvision for the “after” have lead too many people in doing horriﬁc things. It’s a\ndangerous path.\nTatjana Adamov: Just for the sake of argument, let’s imagine the sys-\ntem really breaks down.. would you say a more radical/revolutionary\napproach would be better in that case?\nFrank Braun: Even during a system collapse it is better to build an alternative\nin parallel instead of trying to speed up the collapse. Speeding up the collapse\nhas all the same ethical problems a revolution has, namely forcing your will and\nyour method of rulership on other people.\nSmuggler: Another aspect of doing these things under pressure of a collapse is\nthat the depths of thought, the growth of cultural ideas, is simply not possible.\nPeople in chaos turn to strong leaders that can easily lead them astray. It becomes\ntoo easy to make compromises, and to be manipulated and exploited, without\nrecognizing it. It is far better to slowly, and individually, create alternatives.\nSpeedy social change usually leaves people trampled in the dust and sacriﬁced\nfor a higher cause or in the name of justice. That’s certainly not what I would\nconsider ethical.\nTatjana Adamov: Personally, I ﬁnd the approach of the Berlin Crew\nthe most interesting one, partly because it embodies what was written\nin “The Second Realm”6. Would you say more about that, for those\nnot so familiar with it?\nFrank Braun: For me the core insight of “The Second Realm” was that we\nare (also) physical beings and for something like cryptoanarchy to be viable and\n6https://anarplex.net/hosted/ﬁles/secondrealm/secondrealm.html\n6\n",

Or how to organize without a hierarchy of\nleadership and coercion, no central budget, and not even have attribution as\na tool for that. Experimenting with those things before exposing an unwilling\nsociety to it is necessary, because sometimes experiments go wrong, and our\nideas are simply not shared by a majority.

Most of these businesses however refrained from\npublicly marketing and instead were only available through word of mouth and\nto tightly knit online communities.\nWith the introduction of Bitcoin, the ﬁrst decentralized cryptocurrency, a\nparadigm shift took place. It was likely “The Silk Road” that ﬁrst fused the\navailability of this new kind of online payment system with anonymous access\nand publication of web content.\nDarknet Markets. 2011-2017\n“The Silk Road” was the ﬁrst of a phenomenon that became widely known:\nDarknet Markets.\nThe shallow description of a darknet market consists of a website hosted on\nan anonymous overlay network like Tor or I2P where merchants can present\noﬀers, buyers accept those oﬀers, and the payment between both is conducted\nthrough cryptocurrencies. Additional functionality like merchant-to-buyer private\ncommunication, reputation tracking, payment escrow services and forums in\nwhich both merchants and buyers can have public discussions is often provided.\nThe shipment of products for these markets typically was conducted by the\nmerchant via the oﬃcial postal system or parcel services (UPS, FedEx, DHL).\nDarknet Markets as such were centralized marketing, communication, processing,\nreputation and escrow platforms which attracted primarily small merchant\norganizations that featured ﬂat hierarchies - if they had any hierarchy at all.\nCustomer binding and market share was primarily through the market itself,\nand not to the merchant.\nA limiting factor for darknet markets was that customers had to use anonymous\noverlay networks such as Tor or I2P to be able to access these platforms. This\nwas a barrier of entry for large segments of the potential consumer group and\nalso limited the (secure) access of the markets to non-mobile customer devices\nlike personal computers and laptops. Clearly not the convenience that is required\nby most modern consumers - especially in the drug user segment.\nThe centralized nature of these markets, the binding of customers to market,\nuse of the postal service and the ﬂat hierarchies of merchants had signiﬁcant\nnegative operational security implications.\nWhile fraud by merchants was eﬀectively tamed by the central reputation system\nof each market, fraud by the markets became a commonplace.

Since the majority of oﬀers, and most reputation data, was publicly\navailable attacks using open source intelligence methods like web harvesting and\nanalysis, as well as account take- overs became a common threat. Several cases\nin which law enforcement inﬁltrated the accounts of moderators and operators\nas well as merchants undermined trust in the darknet markets. Furthermore\nseveral markets were taken oﬄine by law enforcement, often locking up funds\nand leading to insecurity in the economy.\nFurthermore merchants were more and more often targeted by sting operations,\ntracking of shipments through the postal system, and tracing of cryptocurrency\ntransactions. Merchants that were successfully identiﬁed and raided often had\naccess to a long history of payment details and shipping addresses of buyers\nwhich further eroded the trust in the darknet markets. The ﬂat hierarchies also\nled to the deep penetration and complete identiﬁcation of the members of market\noperator teams and merchant organizations.\nLastly, the loss of darknet markets led to severe disruption of client-merchant\nrelationships - identities and reputation being lost, previous marketing eﬀorts\nbeing negated - often leading to temporary or even permanent collapse of\nmerchant business.\nDropgangs. 2017/2018-?\nThe problems of darknet markets have triggered an evolution in online black\nmarkets.\nTo prevent the problems of customer binding, and losing business when darknet\nmarkets go down, merchants have begun to leave the specialized and centralized\nplatforms and instead ventured to use widely accessible technology to build their\nown communications and operational back-ends.\nInstead of using websites on the darknet, merchants are now operating invite-only\nchannels on widely available mobile messaging systems like Telegram. This allows\nthe merchant to control the reach of their communication better and be less\nvulnerable to system take-downs. To further stabilize the connection between\nmerchant and customer, repeat customers are given unique messaging contacts\nthat are independent of shared channels and thus even less likely to be found\nand taken down. Channels are often operated by automated bots that allow\ncustomers to inquire about oﬀers and initiate the purchase, often even allowing a\nfully bot-driven experience without human intervention on the merchant’s side.\nThe use of messaging platforms provides a much better user experience to the\ncustomers, who can now reach their suppliers with mobile applications they are\n3\n",

It also means that a larger part of the communication isn’t\nrouted through the Tor or I2P networks anymore but each side - merchant and\ncustomer - employ their own protection technology, often using widely spread\nVPNs.\nThe other major change is the use of “dead drops” instead of the postal system\nwhich has proven vulnerable to tracking and interception. Now, goods are hidden\nin publicly accessible places like parks and the location is given to the customer\non purchase. The customer then goes to the location and picks up the goods.\nThis means that delivery becomes asynchronous for the merchant, he can hide a\nlot of product in diﬀerent locations for future, not yet known, purchases. For\nthe client the time to delivery is signiﬁcantly shorter than waiting for a letter\nor parcel shipped by traditional means - he has the product in his hands in a\nmatter of hours instead of days. Furthermore this method does not require for\nthe customer to give any personally identiﬁable information to the merchant,\nwhich in turn doesn’t have to safeguard it anymore. Less data means less risk\nfor everyone.\nThe use of dead drops also signiﬁcantly reduces the risk of the merchant to be\ndiscovered by tracking within the postal system. He does not have to visit any\neasily to surveil post oﬃce or letter box, instead the whole public space becomes\nhis hiding territory.\nCryptocurrencies are still the main means of payment, but due to the higher\ncustomer-binding, and vetting process by the merchant, escrows are seldom\nemployed. Usually only multi-party transactions between customer and merchant\nare established, and often not even that.\nMarketing and initial vetting of both merchant and customer now happens in\ndarknet forums and chat channels that themselves aren’t involved in any deal\nanymore. In these places merchants and customers take part in the discussion of\nbest procedures, methods and prices. The market connects and develops best\npractices by sharing experience. Furthermore these places also serve as record of\nreputation, though in a still very primitive way.\nOther than allowing much more secure and eﬃcient business for both sides of\nthe transaction, this has also led to changes in the organizational structure of\nmerchants:\nInstead of the ﬂat hierarchies witnessed with darknet markets, merchants today\nemploy hierarchical structures again. These consist of procurement layer, sales\nlayer, and distribution layer. The people constituting each layer usually do not\nknow the identity of the higher layers nor are ever in personal contact with\nthem. All interaction is digital - messaging systems and cryptocurrencies again,\nproduct moves only through dead drops.\nThe procurement layer purchases product wholesale and smuggles it into the\nregion. It is then sold for cryptocurrency to select people that operate the sales\nlayer. After that transaction the risks of both procurement and sales layer are\n4\n",

The distribution layer then divides\nthe product again and places typical sales quantities into new dead drops. The\nlocation of these dead drops is communicated to the sales layer which then sells\nthese locations to the customers through messaging systems.\nTo prevent theft by the distribution layer, the sales layer randomly tests dead\ndrops by tasking diﬀerent members of the distribution layer with picking up\nproduct from a dead drop and hiding it somewhere else, after veriﬁcation of the\ncontents. Usually each unit of product is tagged with a piece of paper containing\na unique secret word which is used to prove to the sales layer that a dead drop\nwas found. Members of the distribution layer have to post security - in the form\nof cryptocurrency - to the sales layer, and they lose part of that security with\nevery dead drop that fails the testing, and with every dead drop they failed to\ntest. So far, no reports of using violence to ensure performance of members of\nthese structures has become known.\nThis concept of using messaging, cryptocurrency and dead drops even within the\nmerchant structure allows for the members within each layer being completely\nisolated from each other, and not knowing anything about higher layers at all.\nThere is no trace to follow if a distribution layer member is captured while\nservicing a dead drop. He will often not even be distinguishable from a regular\ncustomer. This makes these structures extremely secure against inﬁltration,\ntakeover and capture. They are inherently resilient.\nFurthermore the members of the sales layer often employ advanced physical\ntradecraft to prevent surveillance by the procurement layer when they pick up\nproduct. This makes it very hard to dismantle such a structure from the top.\nIf members of such a structure are captured they usually have no critical\ninformation to share, no information about persons, places, times of meeting.\nNo interaction that would make this information necessary ever takes place.\nIt is because of the use of dead drops and hierarchical structures that we call\nthis kind of organization a Dropgang.\nThe result of this evolution is a highly decentralized, specialized and resilient\nmethod of running black market commerce.

This requires a functional exchange infrastructure between less\nand more private cryptocurrencies.\nThis vector of attack is currently\nexploited by law enforcement.\n• Communication tracing: Dropgangs necessarily operate infrastructure to\nkeep in contact with their customers. Law enforcement can potentially\nidentify and track this infrastructure to ﬁnd the operators.\nHowever,\noperators usually have access to suﬃcient anonymization technology and\nare well trained in using it.\n• Surveillance of potential dead drop locations: Potential dead drop locations\ncan be identiﬁed and surveilled by law enforcement to ﬁnd those serving\nthem. This poses a number of problems for law enforcement. First, the\nnumber of potential dead drop locations is very high which requires a lot\nof resources to surveil to even catch anybody by pure luck.

The current method of reporting\nsales experience on forums is open to spamming and manipulation since it is\nhard to show that a deal even took place.\nIt is likely that forums and merchants develop best practices to solve this problem.\nThere is the potential that merchants will start to issue “proofs of sale” in a\ncryptographic form, that customers then use to make statements about the\nperformance of the merchant in public forums.\nThis would allow for distributed and secure calculation of both merchant and\ncustomer reputation without the risk of spamming and manipulation.

We expect development in this\nﬁeld very soon.\nLocalization of dead drops\nDead drops have to satisfy four functions:\n• They must be plentiful. The more potential locations for dead drops, the\nmore secure their operation in face of law enforcement surveillance.\n• They must be easy to locate for the customer who has received the necessary\ninformation from the merchant.\n• They must be unlikely to be found by accident.\nThese three functions together form the problem of localizing: There must be a\nhigh asymmetry of information required to ﬁnd the location over the accidental\nﬁnd.\nClassically, when used by intelligence agencies, dead drops relied on being\nconcealed. This led to dead drops being hard to ﬁnd even by the intended\nrecipients without costly preparation and training. One of the results of this was\nthat dead drops were often used repeatedly, which increased the probability of\nboth sender and recipient being identiﬁed by surveillance.\nAn ideal dead drop is however used exactly once. Only then can the risks of\nusing it be reduced to pure bad luck.\nThis challenge is met by Dropgangs in various ways. The primary one is that\nthe documentation of each dead drop is conducted in minute detail, covering\nGPS coordinates, photos of the surrounding and the location, as well as photos\nof the concealment device in which the product is hidden (such as an empty\ncoke can). The documentation however increases the risk for the Dropgang since\nwhoever creates it would be more easy to identify by surveillance. In addition,\neven great documentation still requires the customer to understand it and follow\nit precisely, which can lead to suspicious behavior around the dead drop location\n(staring at photos, visually comparing them to the surrounding, etc).\nA ﬁrst development to mitigate the problem of localizing is the use of Bluetooth\nbeacons. In addition to the product, the dead drop contains a little electronic\ndevice that sends a signal that can be received by a smartphone, which in turn\ncan display the direction and approximate distance to the device. In addition to\nthe GPS coordinates, the customer requires only a smartphone with the correct\nApp. Beacon devices like these are available on the open market for under ten\ndollars.\nThey do however pose the risk of a non-authorized party to discover the dead\ndrop, simply by searching an area suitable for hiding dead drops with their own\nsmartphone.\nThere are ﬁrst reports of using beacon devices that are not constantly sending\na signal, but have to be activated ﬁrst.

Only if the beacon sees a WiFi hotspot with a speciﬁc, merchant\nprovided, unique name will it start to send a homing signal itself. Devices like\nthese are very cheap (<15 USD) and have gained traction in the ﬁeld, but they\npose risks to the customer: His smartphone becomes identiﬁable by observers,\neven over considerable distance. This can lead to tracking the customer.\nAn alternative solution found is the use of WiFi activated beacons that instead of\nsending a Bluetooth signal use audible sounds that are loud and distinct enough\nto be heard by the customer for localization.\nThe lifetime of these beacons is surprisingly high. They usually lay dormant for\na predeﬁned time before they begin to listen for activation. During the listening\nphase, they usually only become active for a few seconds every minute. This\nmethod allows these beacons to lay passive for days or even weeks using only\nvery cheap chemical batteries (instead of rechargeable batteries that are more\nexpensive).\nWe expect the next development step to be related to beacons that listen for\nultrasound signals before they activate. The customers smartphone would play\nthese signals through its speakers, transmitting a unique code that activates the\nbeacon. The beacon then would send out a homing signal that the customer can\nfollow with his phone. This is likely going to be made available as an App that\nwill make the complete process of localizing very user friendly and fast.\nFuture development\nIt is likely that future developments in this area will focus on customer con-\nvenience. Better homing beacons will be developed, and mass produced in\nShenzhen factories to drive down the price.\nAnother expectation is that messaging services will appear that combine better\nanonymity for both merchant and customer with integrated payment systems\nand potentially even dead drop localizing functionality. Reputation tracking is a\nfurther feature that is likely to be integrated.\nThese messaging services will be dual use. They will be used both by the black\nmarket as well as by legitimate vendors, integrating automated, bot-controlled\ncustomer interaction with peer-to-peer payment is certainly a major technology\nto become commonplace in business. First steps in this direction have been\ntaken by Chinese messaging companies, Telegram and even Facebook.\nGiven the developments in technology and methods, it is very likely that black\nmarkets will spread in both availability and demand. All kinds of goods will be\nwidely available, anonymously, securely, in our cities and urban environments.\nMore people will ﬁnd their livelihoods in taking part in these distribution\nnetworks, since required skills and risks are low, while a steady income for the\nindustrious can be expected.

This would\nalso make this distribution model wider spread and available to more products,\nwhich will blur the lines between the black and the legal market. On this blurred\nline new services and technologies will establish themselves, inherently dual use\nservices like lock boxes that can be paid by peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies.\nLooking even further into the future, it seems plausible that the whole urban\nenvironment might ﬁnd itself integrated into a dynamic landscape of very short-\nlived dead drops that are serviced by humans and cheap drones (unmanned aerial\nvehicles), which are already cheaply available and likely only require one market\nactor to develop and spread a mechanism to pick up and drop goods.
