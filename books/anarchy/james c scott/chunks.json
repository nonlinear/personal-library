It would\nbe nice to be able to claim that it just took that long to think it through.\nNice, but not truthful. A nearly fatal combination of malingering and\nadministrative chores accounts for part of the delay. For the rest, the scope\nof the book simply expanded, in an academic version of Parkinson's Law, to\nfill all the space that I would give to it. Finally, I had to call an\narbitrary halt or else start thinking of it as a life's work.\n\nThe scope of the book together with the time it took to complete it explain\nthe long list of intellectual debts I have accumulated along the way. A full\naccounting of them would be interminable except for the fact that I realize\nsome of my creditors would just as soon not be associated with the final\nproduct. Though I shall not implicate them here, I owe them nonetheless.\nInstead of turning my argument in the direction they urged, I took their\ncriticisms to heart by fortifying my case so that it would better answer their\nobjections. My other intellectual creditors, having failed to disavow the\nfinal product in advance, will be named here and, it is to be hoped,\nimplicated.\n\nSome of my debts are to institutions. I spent the 1990-91 academic year at the\nWissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin as a recipient of their hospitality and\nlargesse. The temptation of living for a time in Berlin, just a year after the\nWall came down, proved irresistible. After physically laboring for six weeks\non an ex-collective farm on the Mecklenburg Plain in eastern Germany (an\nalternative that I dreamed up to avoid sitting for six weeks in Goethe\nInstitute classes with pimply teenagers), I hurled myself at the German\nlanguage, Berlin, and my German col leagues. My research hardly advanced in\nany formal sense, but I realize that many fruitful lines of inquiry opened up\nthen. I want particularly to thank Wolf Lepenies, Reinhard Prasser, Joachim\nNettlebeck, Barbara Sanders, Barbara Golf, Christine Klohn, and Gerhard Riedel\nfor their many kindnesses. The intellectual boon companionship of Georg\nElwert, my local patron saint, as well as that of Shalini Rande- ria, Gabor\nKlaniczay, Christoph Harbsmeier, Barbara Lane, Mitchell Ash, Juan Linz, Jochen\nBlaschke, Arthur von Mehren, Akim von Oppen, Hans Luther, Carola Lenz, Gerd\nSpittler, Hans Medick, and Alf Liidke opened my eyes to lines of inquiry that\nproved formative. Only the great efforts and unfailing friendship of Heinz\nLechleiter and Ursula Hess brought my German to a (barely) tolerable level.\n\nAt various stages in the laborious preparation of this book, I had the\nprivilege of making extended visits to institutions filled with largespirited\nbut skeptical colleagues. My good luck was that they so often made a project\nof straightening me out. They might not be satisfied with the final result,\nbut I'll bet that they can see their influence at work. At the Ecole des\nHautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Marseille, I especially want to thank my\npatron, Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan, Thomas Bierschenk, and their colleagues\nin the staff seminar. Living in Le Vieux Panier and working every day in the\nmagnificent atmosphere of La Vielle Charite were unforgettable experiences. At\nthe Humanities Research Centre at the Australian National University in\nCanberra, I had the benefit of an unmatched crowd of humanists and Asian\nspecialists looking over my shoulder. Thanks go in particular to Graeme Clark,\ndirector, and lain McCalman, associate director, who invited me, and to Tony\nReid and David Kelly, who organized the conference, \"Ideas of Freedom in\nAsia,\" which was the premise of my visit. Tony Milner and Claire Milner,\nRanajit Guha (my guru) and Mechthild Guha, Bob Goodin and Diane Gibson, Ben\nTria Kerkvliet and Melinda Tria, Bill Jenner, Ian Wilson, and John Walker in\nvarious ways made my stay convivial and intellectually rewarding.\n\nThis book would definitely have been much longer in the making were it not for\nthe fact that Dick Ohmann and Betsy Traube invited me to spend the academic\nyear of 1994-95 as a fellow of the Center for Humanities at Wesleyan\nUniversity. My colleagues there and our weekly seminars together were\nintellectually bracing, thanks in large part to Betsy Traube's capacity to\nframe each paper brilliantly. The center's ideal combination of solitude and a\nstaff that could not have been more helpful allowed me to finish a first draft\nof the entire manuscript. I am enormously grateful to Pat Camden and Jackie\nRich for their inexhaustible fund of kindnesses. The astute insights of Betsy\nTraube and Khachig Tololyan mark this work in many ways. Thanks also to Bill\nCohen, Peter Rutland, and Judith Goldstein.\n\nI would not have had the leisure for reflection and writing in 1994-95 had it\nnot been for generous grants from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation\n(Research for Understanding and Reducing Violence, Aggression, and Dominance)\nand a John D. and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation Peace and Security Program\nFellowship. But for their confidence in my work and their assistance, which\nmade possible a respite from all administrative and teaching chores, I\nwouldn't have had a prayer of finishing this study when I did.\n\nFinally, I want to thank my colleagues in the Netherlands and at the Amsterdam\nSchool for Social Science Research for the opportunity of visiting there in\norder to give the Sixth Annual W. F. Wertheim Lecture: Jan Breman, Bram de\nSwaan, Hans Sonneveld, Otto van den Muijzenberg, Anton Blok, Rod Aya, Roseanne\nRutten, Johan Gouds- blom, Jan-Willem Duyvendak, Ido de Haan, Johan Heilbron,\nJose Komen, Karin Peperkamp, Niels Mulder, Frans Hiisken, Ben White, Jan\nNederveen Pieterse, Franz von Benda-Beckmann, and Keebet von Benda-Beckmann.\nHaving Wim Wertheim there to offer advice and criticism was a great privilege\nfor me, for I have admired his many contributions to social science theory and\nSoutheast Asian studies. I learned at least as much from the thesis-writing\ngraduate students in my seminar there as they learned from me; Talja Potters\nand Peer Smets were kind enough to read my chapter on urban planning and\nprovide searching critiques.\n\nThere are a good many scholars whose writings opened up new perspectives for\nme or provided outstanding analyses of issues that I could not have hoped to\nstudy so comprehensively on my own. Some of them have not seen this work, some\nof them I have never met, and some of them would probably want to disown what\nI have written. Nevertheless, I will venture to acknowledge my heavy\nintellectual debts to them all: Edward Friedman, Ben Anderson, Michael Adas,\nTeodor Shanin, James Ferguson, and Zygmunt Bauman. I could not have written\nthe chapter on the high-modernist city without taking shameless advantage of\nthe insights of James Holston's fine book on Brasilia. The chapter on Soviet\ncollectivization and its connection with industrial agriculture in the United\nStates leans heavily on the work of Sheila Fitzpatrick and Deborah Fitzgerald.\nI thank Sheila Fitzpatrick for her searching comments, only a few of which are\nadequately reflected in the finished chapter.\n\nThe elaboration of the concept of metis I owe to Marcel Detienne and Jean-\nPierre Vernant. Although our terminology differs, Stephen Marglin and I had,\nunbeknownst to one another, been taking separate trains to roughly the same\ndestination. Thanks to the Rockefeller Foundation, Marglin organized a\nconference, \"The Greening of Economics,\" in Bellagio, Italy, where I had my\nfirst opportunity to present some of my initial ideas, and Marglin's work on\nepisteme and techne as well as his work on agriculture have influenced my\nthinking. Stephen Gudeman's perceptive comments, Frederique Apffel Marglin's\nwork on \"variolation,\" and Arun Agrawal's work and commentary have helped to\nshape my sense of practical knowledge. Chapter 8, which is about agriculture,\nbears the distinct marks of all that I have learned from the work of Paul\nRichards and from Jan Douwe van der Ploeg. I am an amateur as an Africanist,\nand the chapter on ujamaa villages in Tanzania owes a great deal to Joel Gao\nHiza, who wrote a brilliant senior honors thesis on the subject while at Yale\nUniversity and who generously shared his voluminous research materials. (He is\nnow finishing a thesis in anthropology at the University of California at\nBerkeley.) Bruce McKim, Ron Aminzade, Goran Hyden, David Sperling, and Allen\nIsaacman read the chapter on Tanzania and saved me from some blunders; some\nundoubtedly remain despite their efforts. Birgit Miller's fine analysis of the\nrole of \"fixers and traders\" in the East German factory economy before\nunification helped me to understand the symbiotic relationship between planned\norder and informal arrangements.\n\nLarry Lohmann and James Ferguson read an early draft of the manuscript and\nmade comments that clarified my thinking enormously and prevented some serious\nmissteps. A few other good friends offered to read all or part of the\nmanuscript, in spite of its forbidding length. Those who rolled their eyes\nwhen offering or whose body language suggested mixed feelings, I avoided\nburdening. The few who genuinely wanted to read it, or whose feigned interest\nwas completely convincing, in every case provided a set of comments that\nshaped the book in important ways. I owe an enormous debt and my warmest\nthanks to Ron Herring, Ramachandra Guha, Zygmunt Bauman, K. Sivaramak-\nrishnan, Mark Lendler, Allan Isaacman, and Peter Vandergeest.\n\nA great many thoughtful colleagues made useful criticisms or brought to my\nattention work that contributed to improvements in the argument and evidence.\nThey include Arjun Appadurai, Ken Alder, Gregory Kasza, Daniel Goldhagen,\nErich Goldhagen, Peter Perdue, Esther Kingston-Mann, Peter Sahlins, Anna\nSelenyi, Doug Gallon, and Jane Mansbridge. I also thank Sugata Bose, Al McCoy,\nRichard Landes, Gloria Raheja, Kiren Aziz Chaudhry, Jess Gilbert, Tongchai\nWinichakul, Dan Kelliher, Dan Little, Jack Kloppenberg, Tony Gulielmi, Robert\nEvenson, and Peter Sahlins. Others who kindly contributed are Adam Ashforth,\nJohn Tehranian, Michael Kwass, Jesse Ribot, Ezra Suleiman, Jim Boyce, Jeff\nBurds, Fred Cooper, Ann Stoler, Atul Kohli, Orlando Figes, Anna Tsing, Vernon\nRuttan, Henry Bernstein, Michael Watts, Allan Pred, Witoon Permpongsacharoen,\nGene Ammarell, and David Feeny.\n\nFor the past five years the Program in Agrarian Studies at Yale has been for\nme the site of a broad, interdisciplinary education in rural life and a major\nsource of intellectual companionship. The program has given me more that I can\nimagine ever giving back. Virtually every page of this book can be traced to\none or another of the wide-ranging encounters fostered by the program. I will\nforgo mentioning fifty or so postdoctoral fellows who have visited for a year,\nbut all of them have contributed in large and small ways to this enterprise.\nWe invited them to join us because we admired their work, and they have never\ndisappointed us. The chief of the Program in Agrarian Studies, Marvel Kay\nMansfield, has been the heart and soul of the success of Agrarian Studies and\nevery other enterprise with which I have been associated at Yale. This is not\nthe first occasion I have acknowledged my debt to her; it has only grown with\ntime. Nor could Agrarian Studies have thrived as it has without the initiative\nof K. Sivaramakrishnan, Rick Rheingans, Donna Perry, Bruce McKim, Nina Bhatt,\nand Linda Lee.\n\nMy intellectual debts to colleagues at Yale defy accounting. Those with whom I\nhave taught-Bill Kelly, Helen Siu, Bob Harms, Angelique Haugerud, Nancy\nPeluso, John Wargo, Cathy Cohen, and Lee Wandel-have, in practice, taught me.\nOther Yale colleagues whose fingerprints can be found on this manuscript\ninclude Ian Shapiro, John Merriman, Hal Conklin, Paul Landau, Enrique Meyer,\nDimitri Gutas, Carol Rose, Ben Kiernan, Joe Errington, Charles Bryant, and\nArvid Nelson, a visiting fellow who is completing a thesis on forestry in East\nGermany and who was an exceptional source of information on the history of\nscientific forestry in Germany. The graduate students in my seminar,\n\"Anarchism,\" and in a jointly taught seminar, \"The Comparative Study of\nAgrarian Societies,\" read several draft chapters of the manuscript, pulling\nthem to pieces in ways that forced me to rethink more than a few issues.\n\nI have been blessed with research assistants who turned what began as wild\ngoose chases into serious quests. Without their imagination and work I would\nhave learned little about the invention of permanent last names, the physical\nlayout of new villages, and language planning. Here is my chance to thank Kate\nStanton, Cassandra Moseley, Meredith Weiss, John Tehranian, and Allan Carlson\nfor their superb work. I owe Cassandra Moseley not only thanks but an apology,\nbecause all her fine work on the Tennessee Valley Authority resulted in a\nchapter that I reluctantly cut in order to keep the book within reasonable\nbounds. It will find another home, I trust.\n\nYale University Press has been good to me in more ways than one. I want to\nthank particularly John Ryden; Judy Metro; my editor, Charles Grench; and the\nbest manuscript editor I have ever worked with, Brenda Kolb.\n\nSeveral variants of chapter 1, each with some material from later chapters,\nhave appeared elsewhere: \"State Simplifications: Nature, Space, and People,\"\nOccasional Paper No. 1, Department of History, University of Saskatchewan,\nCanada, November 1994; \"State Simplifications,\" Journal of Political\nPhilosophy 4, no. 2 (1995): 1-42; \"State Simplifications: Nature, Space, and\nPeople,\" in Ian Shapiro and Russell Hardin, eds., Political Order, vol. 38 of\nNomos (New York: New York University Press, 1996): 42-85; \"Freedom Contra\nFreehold: State Simplification, Space, and People in Southeast Asia,\" in David\nKelly and Anthony Reid, eds., Freedom in Asia (forthcoming); \"State\nSimplifications: Some Applications to Southeast Asia,\" Sixth Annual W. F\nWertheim Lecture, Centre for Asian Studies, Amsterdam, June 1995; and \"State\nSimplifications and Practical Knowledge,\" in Stephen Marglin and Stephen\nGudeman, eds., People's Economy, People's Ecology (forthcoming).\n\nI'd like to kick the habit of writing books, at least for a while. If there\nwere a detox unit or an analog to the nicotine patch for serial offenders, I\nthink I would sign up for treatment. My habit has already cost me more\nprecious time than I care to admit. The problem with book writing and other\naddictions is that the resolve to quit is greatest during withdrawal, but as\nthe painful symptoms recede, the craving is apt to return. Louise and our\nchildren, Mia, Aaron, and Noah, would, I know, be only too happy to have me\ncommitted until I was \"clean.\" I'm trying. God knows I'm trying.\n\n\n## Seeing Like a State\n\n\n# Introduction\n\n![](img0004.jpg)\n\nThis book grew out of an intellectual detour that became so gripping that I\ndecided to abandon my original itinerary altogether. After I had made what\nappeared to be an ill-considered turn, the surprising new scenery and the\nsense that I was headed for a more satisfying destination persuaded me to\nchange my plans. The new itinerary, I think, has a logic of its own. It might\neven have been a more elegant trip had I possessed the wit to conceive of it\nat the outset. What does seem clear to me is that the detour, although along\nroads that were bumpier and more circuitous than I had foreseen, has led to a\nmore substantial place. It goes without saying that the reader might have\nfound a more experienced guide, but the itinerary is so peculiarly off the\nbeaten track that, if you're headed this way, you have to settle for whatever\nlocal tracker you can find.\n\nA word about the road not taken. Originally, I set out to understand why the\nstate has always seemed to be the enemy of \"people who move around,\" to put it\ncrudely. In the context of Southeast Asia, this promised to be a fruitful way\nof addressing the perennial tensions between mobile, slash-and-burn hill\npeoples on one hand and wet-rice, valley kingdoms on the other. The question,\nhowever, transcended regional geography. Nomads and pastoralists (such as\nBerbers and Bedouins), hunter-gatherers, Gypsies, vagrants, homeless people,\nitinerants, runaway slaves, and serfs have always been a thorn in the side of\nstates. Efforts to permanently settle these mobile peoples (sedentarization)\nseemed to be a perennial state project-perennial, in part, because it so\nseldom succeeded.\n\nThe more I examined these efforts at sedentarization, the more I came to see\nthem as a state's attempt to make a society legible, to arrange the population\nin ways that simplified the classic state functions of taxation, conscription,\nand prevention of rebellion. Having begun to think in these terms, I began to\nsee legibility as a central problem in statecraft. The premodern state was, in\nmany crucial respects, partially blind; it knew precious little about its\nsubjects, their wealth, their landholdings and yields, their location, their\nvery identity. It lacked anything like a detailed \"map\" of its terrain and its\npeople. It lacked, for the most part, a measure, a metric, that would allow it\nto \"translate\" what it knew into a common standard necessary for a synoptic\nview. As a result, its interventions were often crude and self-defeating.\n\nIt is at this point that the detour began. How did the state gradually get a\nhandle on its subjects and their environment? Suddenly, processes as disparate\nas the creation of permanent last names, the standardization of weights and\nmeasures, the establishment of cadastral surveys and population registers, the\ninvention of freehold tenure, the standardization of language and legal\ndiscourse, the design of cities, and the organization of transportation seemed\ncomprehensible as attempts at legibility and simplification. In each case,\nofficials took exceptionally complex, illegible, and local social practices,\nsuch as land tenure customs or naming customs, and created a standard grid\nwhereby it could be centrally recorded and monitored.\n\nThe organization of the natural world was no exception. Agriculture is, after\nall, a radical reorganization and simplification of flora to suit man's goals.\nWhatever their other purposes, the designs of scientific forestry and\nagriculture and the layouts of plantations, collective farms, ujamaa villages,\nand strategic hamlets all seemed calculated to make the terrain, its products,\nand its workforce more legible -and hence manipulable-from above and from the\ncenter.\n\nA homely analogy from beekeeping may be helpful here. In premodern times the\ngathering of honey was a difficult affair. Even if bees were housed in straw\nhives, harvesting the honey usually meant driving off the bees and often\ndestroying the colony. The arrangement of brood chambers and honey cells\nfollowed complex patterns that varied from hive to hive-patterns that did not\nallow for neat extractions. The modern beehive, in contrast, is designed to\nsolve the beekeeper's problem. With a device called a \"queen excluder,\" it\nseparates the brood chambers below from the honey supplies above, preventing\nthe queen from laying eggs above a certain level. Furthermore, the wax cells\nare arranged neatly in vertical frames, nine or ten to a box, which enable the\neasy extraction of honey, wax, and propolis. Extraction is made possible by\nobserving \"bee space\"-the precise distance between the frames that the bees\nwill leave open as passages rather than bridging the frames by building\nintervening honeycomb. From the beekeeper's point of view, the modern hive is\nan orderly, \"legible\" hive allowing the beekeeper to inspect the condition of\nthe colony and the queen, judge its honey production (by weight), enlarge or\ncontract the size of the hive by standard units, move it to a new location,\nand, above all, extract just enough honey (in temperate climates) to ensure\nthat the colony will overwinter successfully.\n\nI do not wish to push the analogy further than it will go, but much of early\nmodern European statecraft seemed similarly devoted to rationalizing and\nstandardizing what was a social hieroglyph into a legible and administratively\nmore convenient format. The social simplifications thus introduced not only\npermitted a more finely tuned system of taxation and conscription but also\ngreatly enhanced state capacity. They made possible quite discriminating\ninterventions of every kind, such as public-health measures, political\nsurveillance, and relief for the poor.\n\nThese state simplifications, the basic givens of modern statecraft, were, I\nbegan to realize, rather like abridged maps. They did not successfully\nrepresent the actual activity of the society they depicted, nor were they\nintended to; they represented only that slice of it that interested the\nofficial observer. They were, moreover, not just maps. Rather, they were maps\nthat, when allied with state power, would enable much of the reality they\ndepicted to be remade. Thus a state cadastral map created to designate taxable\nproperty-holders does not merely describe a system of land tenure; it creates\nsuch a system through its ability to give its categories the force of law.\nMuch of the first chapter is intended to convey how thoroughly society and the\nenvironment have been refashioned by state maps of legibility.\n\nThis view of early modern statecraft is not particularly original. Suitably\nmodified, however, it can provide a distinctive optic through which a number\nof huge development fiascoes in poorer Third World nations and Eastern Europe\ncan be usefully viewed.\n\nBut \"fiasco\" is too lighthearted a word for the disasters I have in mind. The\nGreat Leap Forward in China, collectivization in Russia, and compulsory\nvillagization in Tanzania, Mozambique, and Ethiopia are among the great human\ntragedies of the twentieth century, in terms of both lives lost and lives\nirretrievably disrupted. At a less dramatic but far more common level, the\nhistory of Third World development is littered with the debris of huge\nagricultural schemes and new cities (think of Brasilia or Chandigarh) that\nhave failed their residents. It is not so difficult, alas, to understand why\nso many human lives have been destroyed by mobilized violence between ethnic\ngroups, religious sects, or linguistic communities. But it is harder to grasp\nwhy so many well-intended schemes to improve the human condition have gone so\ntragically awry. I aim, in what follows, to provide a convincing account of\nthe logic behind the failure of some of the great utopian social engineering\nschemes of the twentieth century.\n\nI shall argue that the most tragic episodes of state-initiated social\nengineering originate in a pernicious combination of four elements. All four\nare necessary for a full-fledged disaster. The first element is the\nadministrative ordering of nature and society-the transformative state\nsimplifications described above. By themselves, they are the unremarkable\ntools of modern statecraft; they are as vital to the maintenance of our\nwelfare and freedom as they are to the designs of a would-be modern despot.\nThey undergird the concept of citizenship and the provision of social welfare\njust as they might undergird a policy of rounding up undesirable minorities.\n\nThe second element is what I call a high-modernist ideology. It is best\nconceived as a strong, one might even say muscle-bound, version of the self-\nconfidence about scientific and technical progress, the expansion of\nproduction, the growing satisfaction of human needs, the mastery of nature\n(including human nature), and, above all, the rational design of social order\ncommensurate with the scientific understanding of natural laws. It originated,\nof course, in the West, as a by-product of unprecedented progress in science\nand industry.\n\nHigh modernism must not be confused with scientific practice. It was\nfundamentally, as the term \"ideology\" implies, a faith that borrowed, as it\nwere, the legitimacy of science and technology. It was, accordingly,\nuncritical, unskeptical, and thus unscientifically optimistic about the\npossibilities for the comprehensive planning of human settlement and\nproduction. The carriers of high modernism tended to see rational order in\nremarkably visual aesthetic terms. For them, an efficient, rationally\norganized city, village, or farm was a city that looked regimented and orderly\nin a geometrical sense. The carriers of high modernism, once their plans\nmiscarried or were thwarted, tended to retreat to what I call miniaturization:\nthe creation of a more easily controlled micro-order in model cities, model\nvillages, and model farms.\n\nHigh modernism was about \"interests\" as well as faith. Its carriers, even when\nthey were capitalist entrepreneurs, required state action to realize their\nplans. In most cases, they were powerful officials and heads of state. They\ntended to prefer certain forms of planning and so cial organization (such as\nhuge dams, centralized communication and transportation hubs, large factories\nand farms, and grid cities), because these forms fit snugly into a high-\nmodernist view and also answered their political interests as state officials.\nThere was, to put it mildly, an elective affinity between high modernism and\nthe interests of many state officials.\n\nLike any ideology, high modernism had a particular temporal and social\ncontext. The feats of national economic mobilization of the belligerents\n(especially Germany) in World War I seem to mark its high tide. Not\nsurprisingly, its most fertile social soil was to be found among planners,\nengineers, architects, scientists, and technicians whose skills and status it\ncelebrated as the designers of the new order. High-modernist faith was no\nrespecter of traditional political boundaries; it could be found across the\npolitical spectrum from left to right but particularly among those who wanted\nto use state power to bring about huge, utopian changes in people's work\nhabits, living patterns, moral conduct, and worldview. Nor was this utopian\nvision dangerous in and of itself. Where it animated plans in liberal\nparliamentary societies and where the planners therefore had to negotiate with\norganized citizens, it could spur reform.\n\nOnly when these first two elements are joined to a third does the combination\nbecome potentially lethal. The third element is an authoritarian state that is\nwilling and able to use the full weight of its coercive power to bring these\nhigh-modernist designs into being. The most fertile soil for this element has\ntypically been times of war, revolution, depression, and struggle for national\nliberation. In such situations, emergency conditions foster the seizure of\nemergency powers and frequently delegitimize the previous regime. They also\ntend to give rise to elites who repudiate the past and who have revolutionary\ndesigns for their people.\n\nA fourth element is closely linked to the third: a prostrate civil society\nthat lacks the capacity to resist these plans. War, revolution, and economic\ncollapse often radically weaken civil society as well as make the populace\nmore receptive to a new dispensation. Late colonial rule, with its social\nengineering aspirations and ability to run roughshod over popular opposition,\noccasionally met this last condition.\n\nIn sum, the legibility of a society provides the capacity for largescale\nsocial engineering, high-modernist ideology provides the desire, the\nauthoritarian state provides the determination to act on that desire, and an\nincapacitated civil society provides the leveled social terrain on which to\nbuild.\n\nI have not yet explained, the reader will have noted, why such high-\n\nmodernist plans, backed by authoritarian power, actually failed. Accounting\nfor their failure is my second purpose here.\n\nDesigned or planned social order is necessarily schematic; it always ignores\nessential features of any real, functioning social order. This truth is best\nillustrated in a work-to-rule strike, which turns on the fact that any\nproduction process depends on a host of informal practices and improvisations\nthat could never be codified. By merely following the rules meticulously, the\nworkforce can virtually halt production. In the same fashion, the simplified\nrules animating plans for, say, a city, a village, or a collective farm were\ninadequate as a set of instructions for creating a functioning social order.\nThe formal scheme was parasitic on informal processes that, alone, it could\nnot create or maintain. To the degree that the formal scheme made no allowance\nfor these processes or actually suppressed them, it failed both its intended\nbeneficiaries and ultimately its designers as well.\n\nMuch of this book can be read as a case against the imperialism of high-\nmodernist, planned social order. I stress the word \"imperialism\" here because\nI am emphatically not making a blanket case against either bureaucratic\nplanning or high-modernist ideology. I am, however, making a case against an\nimperial or hegemonic planning mentality that excludes the necessary role of\nlocal knowledge and know-how.\n\nThroughout the book I make the case for the indispensable role of practical\nknowledge, informal processes, and improvisation in the face of\nunpredictability. In chapters 4 and 5, I contrast the high-modernist views and\npractices of city planners and revolutionaries with critical views emphasizing\nprocess, complexity, and open-endedness. Le Corbusier and Lenin are the\nprotagonists, with Jane Jacobs and Rosa Luxemburg cast as their formidable\ncritics. Chapters 6 and 7 contain accounts of Soviet collectivization and\nTanzanian forced villagization, which illustrate how schematic, authoritarian\nsolutions to production and social order inevitably fail when they exclude the\nfund of valuable knowledge embodied in local practices. (An early draft\ncontained a case study of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the United States'\nhighmodernist experiment and the granddaddy of all regional development\nprojects. It was reluctantly swept aside to shorten what is still a long\nbook.)\n\nFinally, in chapter 9 I attempt to conceptualize the nature of practical\nknowledge and to contrast it with more formal, deductive, epistemic knowledge.\nThe term metis, which descends from classical Greek and denotes the knowledge\nthat can come only from practical experience, serves as a useful portmanteau\nword for what I have in mind. Here I should also acknowledge my debt to\nanarchist writers (Kropotkin, Bakunin, Malatesta, Proudhon) who consistently\nemphasize the role of mutuality as opposed to imperative, hierarchical\ncoordination in the creation of social order. Their understanding of the term\n\"mutuality\" covers some, but not all, of the same ground that I mean to cover\nwith \"metis.\"\n\nRadically simplified designs for social organization seem to court the same\nrisks of failure courted by radically simplified designs for natural\nenvironments. The failures and vulnerability of monocrop commercial forests\nand genetically engineered, mechanized monocropping mimic the failures of\ncollective farms and planned cities. At this level, I am making a case for the\nresilience of both social and natural diversity and a strong case about the\nlimits, in principle, of what we are likely to know about complex, functioning\norder. One could, I think, successfully turn this argument against a certain\nkind of reductive social science. Having already taken on more than I could\nchew, I leave this additional detour to others, with my blessing.\n\nIn trying to make a strong, paradigmatic case, I realize that I have risked\ndisplaying the hubris of which high modernists are justly accused. Once you\nhave crafted lenses that change your perspective, it is a great temptation to\nlook at everything through the same spectacles. I do, however, want to plead\ninnocent to two charges that I do not think a careful reading would sustain.\nThe first charge is that my argument is uncritically admiring of the local,\nthe traditional, and the customary. I understand that the practical knowledge\nI describe is often inseparable from the practices of domination, monopoly,\nand exclusion that offend the modern liberal sensibility. My point is not that\npractical knowledge is the product of some mythical, egalitarian state of\nnature. Rather, my point is that formal schemes of order are untenable without\nsome elements of the practical knowledge that they tend to dismiss. The second\ncharge is that my argument is an anarchist case against the state itself. The\nstate, as I make abundantly clear, is the vexed institution that is the ground\nof both our freedoms and our unfreedoms. My case is that certain kinds of\nstates, driven by utopian plans and an authoritarian disregard for the values,\ndesires, and objections of their subjects, are indeed a mortal threat to human\nwell-being. Short of that draconian but all too common situation, we are left\nto weigh judiciously the benefits of certain state interventions against their\ncosts.\n\nAs I finished this book, I realized that its critique of certain forms of\nstate action might seem, from the post- 1989 perspective of capitalist\ntriumphalism, like a kind of quaint archaeology. States with the pretensions\nand power that I criticize have for the most part vanished or have drastically\ncurbed their ambitions. And yet, as I make clear in examining scientific\nfarming, industrial agriculture, and capitalist markets in general, large-\nscale capitalism is just as much an agency of homogenization, uniformity,\ngrids, and heroic simplification as the state is, with the difference being\nthat, for capitalists, simplification must pay. A market necessarily reduces\nquality to quantity via the price mechanism and promotes standardization; in\nmarkets, money talks, not people. Today, global capitalism is perhaps the most\npowerful force for homogenization, whereas the state may in some instances be\nthe defender of local difference and variety. (In Enlightenment's Wake, John\nGray makes a similar case for liberalism, which he regards as self-limiting\nbecause it rests on cultural and institutional capital that it is bound to\nundermine.) The \"interruption,\" forced by widespread strikes, of France's\nstructural adjustments to accommodate a common European currency is perhaps a\nstraw in the wind. Put bluntly, my bill of particulars against a certain kind\nof state is by no means a case for politically unfettered market coordination\nas urged by Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. As we shall see, the\nconclusions that can be drawn from the failures of modern projects of social\nengineering are as applicable to market-driven standardization as they are to\nbureaucratic homogeneity.\n\n\n# Part 1\n\n## State Projects of  \nLegibility and Simplification\n\n\n# i Nature and Space\n\n![](img0005.jpg)\n\nWould it not be a great satisfaction to the king to know at a designated\nmoment every year the number of his subjects, in total and by region, with all\nthe resources, wealth & poverty of each place; [the number] of his nobility\nand ecclesiastics of all kinds, of men of the robe, of Catholics and of those\nof the other religion, all separated according to the place of their\nresidence? .. .

The\ngreat advantage of such tunnel vision is that it brings into sharp focus\ncertain limited aspects of an otherwise far more complex and unwieldy reality.\nThis very simplification, in turn, makes the phenomenon at the center of the\nfield of vision more legible and hence more susceptible to careful measurement\nand calculation. Combined with similar observations, an overall, aggregate,\nsynoptic view of a selective reality is achieved, making possible a high\ndegree of schematic knowledge, control, and manipulation.\n\nThe invention of scientific forestry in late eighteenth-century Prussia and\nSaxony serves as something of a model of this process.' Although the history\nof scientific forestry is important in its own right, it is used here as a\nmetaphor for the forms of knowledge and manipulation characteristic of\npowerful institutions with sharply defined interests, of which state\nbureaucracies and large commercial firms are perhaps the outstanding examples.\nOnce we have seen how simplification, legibility, and manipulation operate in\nforest management, we can then explore how the modern state applies a similar\nlens to urban planning, rural settlement, land administration, and\nagriculture.\n\n#### The State and Scientific Forestry: A Parable\n\nI [Gilgamesh] would conquer in the Cedar Forest.... I will set my hand to it\nand will chop down the Cedar.\n\n-Epic of Gilgamesh\n\nThe early modern European state, even before the development of scientific\nforestry, viewed its forests primarily through the fiscal lens of revenue\nneeds. To be sure, other concerns-such as timber for shipbuilding, state\nconstruction, and fuel for the economic security of its subjects-were not\nentirely absent from official management. These concerns also had heavy\nimplications for state revenue and security.' Exaggerating only slightly, one\nmight say that the crown's interest in forests was resolved through its fiscal\nlens into a single number: the revenue yield of the timber that might be\nextracted annually.\n\nThe best way to appreciate how heroic was this constriction of vision is to\nnotice what fell outside its field of vision. Lurking behind the number\nindicating revenue yield were not so much forests as commercial wood,\nrepresenting so many thousands of board feet of saleable timber and so many\ncords of firewood fetching a certain price. Missing, of course, were all those\ntrees, bushes, and plants holding little or no potential for state revenue.\nMissing as well were all those parts of trees, even revenue-bearing trees,\nwhich might have been useful to the population but whose value could not be\nconverted into fiscal receipts. Here I have in mind foliage and its uses as\nfodder and thatch; fruits, as food for people and domestic animals; twigs and\nbranches, as bedding, fencing, hop poles, and kindling; bark and roots, for\nmaking medicines and for tanning; sap, for making resins; and so forth. Each\nspecies of treeindeed, each part or growth stage of each species-had its\nunique properties and uses. A fragment of the entry under \"elm\" in a popular\nseventeenth-century encyclopedia on aboriculture conveys something of the vast\nrange of practical uses to which the tree could be put.\n\nElm is a timber of most singular use, especially whereby it may be continually\ndry, or wet, in extremes; therefore proper for water works, mills, the ladles\nand soles of the wheel, pumps, aqueducts, ship planks below the water line,\n... also for wheelwrights, handles for the single handsaw, rails and gates.\nElm is not so apt to rive [split] ... and is used for chopping blocks, blocks\nfor the hat maker, trunks and boxes to be covered with leather, coffins and\ndressers and shovelboard tables of great length; also for the carver and those\ncurious workers of fruitage, foliage, shields, statues and most of the\nornaments appertaining to the orders of architecture.... And finally ... the\nuse of the very leaves of this tree, especially the female, is not to be\ndespised, ... for they will prove of great relief to cattle in the winter and\nscorching summers when hay and fodder is dear.... The green leaf of the elms\ncontused heals a green wound or cut, and boiled with the bark, consolidates\nbone fractures.'\n\nIn state \"fiscal forestry,\" however, the actual tree with its vast number of\npossible uses was replaced by an abstract tree representing a volume of lumber\nor firewood. If the princely conception of the forest was still utilitarian,\nit was surely a utilitarianism confined to the direct needs of the state.\n\nFrom a naturalist's perspective, nearly everything was missing from the\nstate's narrow frame of reference. Gone was the vast majority of flora:\ngrasses, flowers, lichens, ferns, mosses, shrubs, and vines. Gone, too, were\nreptiles, birds, amphibians, and innumerable species of insects. Gone were\nmost species of fauna, except those that interested the crown's gamekeepers.\n\nFrom an anthropologist's perspective, nearly everything touching on human\ninteraction with the forest was also missing from the state's tunnel vision.\nThe state did pay attention to poaching, which impinged on its claim to\nrevenue in wood or its claim to royal game, but otherwise it typically ignored\nthe vast, complex, and negotiated social uses of the forest for hunting and\ngathering, pasturage, fishing, charcoal making, trapping, and collecting food\nand valuable minerals as well as the forest's significance for magic, worship,\nrefuge, and so on.4\n\nIf the utilitarian state could not see the real, existing forest for the\n(commercial) trees, if its view of its forests was abstract and partial, it\nwas hardly unique in this respect. Some level of abstraction is necessary for\nvirtually all forms of analysis, and it is not at all surprising that the\nabstractions of state officials should have reflected the paramount fiscal\ninterests of their employer. The entry under \"forest\" in Diderot's\nEncyclopedie is almost exclusively concerned with the utilite publique of\nforest products and the taxes, revenues, and profits that they can be made to\nyield. The forest as a habitat disappears and is replaced by the forest as an\neconomic resource to be managed efficiently and profitably.' Here, fiscal and\ncommercial logics coincide; they are both resolutely fixed on the bottom line.\n\nThe vocabulary used to organize nature typically betrays the overriding\ninterests of its human users. In fact, utilitarian discourse replaces the term\n\"nature\" with the term \"natural resources,\" focusing on those aspects of\nnature that can be appropriated for human use. A comparable logic extracts\nfrom a more generalized natural world those flora or fauna that are of\nutilitarian value (usually marketable commodities) and, in turn, reclassifies\nthose species that compete with, prey on, or otherwise diminish the yields of\nthe valued species. Thus, plants that are valued become \"crops,\" the species\nthat compete with them are stigmatized as \"weeds,\" and the insects that ingest\nthem are stigmatized as \"pests.\" Thus, trees that are valued become \"timber,\"\nwhile species that compete with them become \"trash\" trees or \"underbrush.\" The\nsame logic applies to fauna. Highly valued animals become \"game\" or\n\"livestock,\" while those animals that compete with or prey upon them become\n\"predators\" or \"varmints.\"\n\nThe kind of abstracting, utilitarian logic that the state, through its\nofficials, applied to the forest is thus not entirely distinctive. What is\ndistinctive about this logic, however, is the narrowness of its field of\nvision, the degree of elaboration to which it can be subjected, and above all,\nas we shall see, the degree to which it allowed the state to impose that logic\non the very reality that was observed.6\n\nScientific forestry was originally developed from about 1765 to 1800, largely\nin Prussia and Saxony. Eventually, it would become the basis of forest\nmanagement techniques in France, England, and the United States and throughout\nthe Third World. Its emergence cannot be understood outside the larger context\nof the centralized state-making initiatives of the period. In fact, the new\nforestry science was a subdiscipline of what was called cameral science, an\neffort to reduce the fiscal management of a kingdom to scientific principles\nthat would allow systematic planning.' Traditional domainal forestry had\nhitherto simply divided the forest into roughly equal plots, with the number\nof plots coinciding with the number of years in the assumed growth cycle.' One\nplot was cut each year on the assumption of equal yields (and value) from\nplots of equal size. Because of poor maps, the uneven distribution of the most\nvaluable large trees (Hochwald), and very approximate cordwood (Bruststaerke)\nmeasures, the results were unsatisfactory for fiscal planning.\n\nCareful exploitation of domainal forests was all the more imperative in the\nlate eighteenth century, when fiscal officials became aware of a growing\nshortage of wood. Many of the old-growth forests of oak, beech, hornbeam, and\nlinden had been severely degraded by planned and unplanned felling, while the\nregrowth was not as robust as hoped. The prospect of declining yields was\nalarming, not merely because it threatened revenue flows but also because it\nmight provoke massive poaching by a peasantry in search of firewood. One sign\nof this concern were the numerous state-sponsored competitions for designs of\nmore efficient woodstoves.\n\nThe first attempt at more precise measurements of forests was made by Johann\nGottlieb Beckmann on a carefully surveyed sample plot. Walking abreast,\nseveral assistants carried compartmentalized boxes with color-coded nails\ncorresponding to five categories of tree sizes, which they had been trained to\nidentify. Each tree was tagged with the appropriate nail until the sample plot\nhad been covered. Because each assistant had begun with a certain number of\nnails, it was a simple matter to subtract the remaining nails from the initial\ntotal and arrive at an inventory of trees by class for the entire plot. The\nsample plot had been carefully chosen for its representativeness, allowing the\nforesters to then calculate the timber and, given certain price assumptions,\nthe revenue yield of the whole forest. For the forest scientists\n(Forstwissenscha ftler) the goal was always to \"deliver the greatest possible\nconstant volume of wood.'\n\nThe effort at precision was pushed further as mathematicians worked from the\ncone-volume principle to specify the volume of saleable wood contained by a\nstandardized tree (Normalbaum) of a given size-class. Their calculations were\nchecked empirically against the actual volume of wood in sample trees.10 The\nfinal result of such calculations was the development of elaborate tables with\ndata organized by tree size and age under specified conditions of normal\ngrowth and maturation. By radically narrowing his vision to commercial wood,\nthe state forester had, with his tables, paradoxically achieved a synoptic\nview of the entire forest.\" This restriction of focus reflected in the tables\nwas in fact the only way in which the whole forest could be taken in by a\nsingle optic. Reference to these tables coupled with field tests allowed the\nforester to estimate closely the inventory, growth, and yield of a given\nforest. In the regulated, abstract forest of the forst- wissenschaftler,\ncalculation and measurement prevailed, and the three watchwords, in modern\nparlance, were \"minimum diversity,\" the \"balance sheet,\" and \"sustained\nyield.\" The logic of the state-managed forest science was virtually identical\nwith the logic of commercial exploitation.1z\n\nThe achievement of German forestry science in standardizing techniques for\ncalculating the sustainable yield of commercial timber and hence revenue was\nimpressive enough. What is decisive for our purposes, however, was the next\nlogical step in forest management. That step was to attempt to create, through\ncareful seeding, planting, and cutting, a forest that was easier for state\nforesters to count, manipulate, measure, and assess. The fact is that forest\nscience and geometry, backed by state power, had the capacity to transform the\nreal, diverse, and chaotic old-growth forest into a new, more uniform forest\nthat closely resembled the administrative grid of its techniques. To this end,\nthe underbrush was cleared, the number of species was reduced (often to\nmonoculture), and plantings were done simultaneously and in straight rows on\nlarge tracts. These management practices, as Henry Lowood observes, \"produced\nthe monocultural, even-age forests that eventually transformed the Normalbaum\nfrom abstraction to reality. The German forest became the archetype for\nimposing on disorderly nature the neatly arranged constructs of science.\nPractical goals had encouraged mathematical utilitarianism, which seemed, in\nturn, to promote geometric perfection as the outward sign of the well-managed\nforest; in turn the rationally ordered arrangements of trees offered new\npossibilities for controlling nature. II\n\nThe tendency was toward regimentation, in the strict sense of the word. The\nforest trees were drawn up into serried, uniform ranks, as it were, to be\nmeasured, counted off, felled, and replaced by a new rank and file of\nlookalike conscripts. As an army, it was also designed hierarchically from\nabove to fulfill a unique purpose and to be at the disposition of a single\ncommander. At the limit, the forest itself would not even have to be seen; it\ncould be \"read\" accurately from the tables and maps in the forester's office.\n\n![](img0006.jpg)\n\n1\\. Mixed temperate forest, part managed, part natural regeneration\n\n![](img0007.jpg)\n\n2\\. One aisle of a managed poplar forest in Tuscany\n\nHow much easier it was to manage the new, stripped-down forest. With stands of\nsame-age trees arranged in linear alleys, clearing the underbrush, felling,\nextraction, and new planting became a far more routine process. Increasing\norder in the forest made it possible for forest workers to use written\ntraining protocols that could be widely applied. A relatively unskilled and\ninexperienced labor crew could adequately carry out its tasks by following a\nfew standard rules in the new forest environment. Harvesting logs of\nrelatively uniform width and length not only made it possible to forecast\nyields successfully but also to market homogeneous product units to logging\ncontractors and timber merchants.14 Commercial logic and bureaucratic logic\nwere, in this instance, synonymous; it was a system that promised to maximize\nthe return of a single commodity over the long haul and at the same time lent\nitself to a centralized scheme of management.\n\nThe new legible forest was also easier to manipulate experimentally. Now that\nthe more complex old-growth forest had been replaced by a forest in which many\nvariables were held constant, it was a far simpler matter to examine the\neffects of such variables as fertilizer applications, rainfall, and weeding,\non same-age, single-species stands. It was the closest thing to a forest\nlaboratory one could imagine at the time.15 The very simplicity of the forest\nmade it possible, for the first time, to assess novel regimens of forest\nmanagement under nearly experimental conditions.\n\nAlthough the geometric, uniform forest was intended to facilitate management\nand extraction, it quickly became a powerful aesthetic as well. The visual\nsign of the well-managed forest, in Germany and in the many settings where\nGerman scientific forestry took hold, came to be the regularity and neatness\nof its appearance. Forests might be inspected in much the same way as a\ncommanding officer might review his troops on parade, and woe to the forest\nguard whose \"beat\" was not sufficiently trim or \"dressed.\" This aboveground\norder required that underbrush be removed and that fallen trees and branches\nbe gathered and hauled off. Unauthorized disturbances-whether by fire or by\nlocal populations-were seen as implicit threats to management routines. The\nmore uniform the forest, the greater the possibilities for centralized\nmanagement; the routines that could be applied minimized the need for the\ndiscretion necessary in the management of diverse old-growth forests.\n\nThe controlled environment of the redesigned, scientific forest promised many\nstriking advantages.16 It could be synoptically surveyed by the chief\nforester; it could be more easily supervised and harvested according to\ncentralized, long-range plans; it provided a steady, uniform commodity,\nthereby eliminating one major source of revenue fluctuation; and it created a\nlegible natural terrain that facilitated manipulation and experimentation.\n\nThis utopian dream of scientific forestry was, of course, only the immanent\nlogic of its techniques. It was not and could not ever be realized in\npractice. Both nature and the human factor intervened. The existing topography\nof the landscape and the vagaries of fire, storms, blights, climatic changes,\ninsect populations, and disease conspired to thwart foresters and to shape the\nactual forest. Also, given the insurmountable difficulties of policing large\nforests, people living nearby typically continued to graze animals, poach\nfirewood and kindling, make charcoal, and use the forest in other ways that\nprevented the foresters' management plan from being fully realized.\" Although,\nlike all utopian schemes, it fell well short of attaining its goal, the\ncritical fact is that it did partly succeed in stamping the actual forest with\nthe imprint of its designs.\n\nThe principles of scientific forestry were applied as rigorously as was\npracticable to most large German forests throughout much of the nineteenth\ncentury. The Norway spruce, known for its hardiness, rapid growth, and\nvaluable wood, became the bread-and-butter tree of commercial forestry.\nOriginally, the Norway spruce was seen as a restoration crop that might revive\noverexploited mixed forests, but the commercial profits from the first\nrotation were so stunning that there was little effort to return to mixed\nforests. The monocropped forest was a disaster for peasants who were now\ndeprived of all the grazing, food, raw materials, and medicines that the\nearlier forest ecology had afforded. Diverse old-growth forests, about three-\nfourths of which were broadleaf (deciduous) species, were replaced by largely\nconiferous forests in which Norway spruce or Scotch pine were the dominant or\noften only species.\n\nIn the short run, this experiment in the radical simplification of the forest\nto a single commodity was a resounding success. It was a rather long short\nrun, in the sense that a single crop rotation of trees might take eighty years\nto mature. The productivity of the new forests reversed the decline in the\ndomestic wood supply, provided more uniform stands and more usable wood fiber,\nraised the economic return of forest land, and appreciably shortened rotation\ntimes (the time it took to harvest a stand and plant another).' Like row crops\nin a field, the new softwood forests were prodigious producers of a single\ncommodity. Little wonder that the German model of intensive commercial\nforestry became standard throughout the world.'9 Gifford Pinchot, the second\nchief forester of the United States, was trained at the French forestry school\nat Nancy, which followed a German-style curriculum, as did most U.S. and\nEuropean forestry schools.20 The first forester hired by the British to assess\nand manage the great forest resources of India and Burma was Dietrich Brandes,\na German.21 By the end of the nineteenth century, German forestry science was\nhegemonic.\n\nThe great simplification of the forest into a \"one-commodity ma chine\" was\nprecisely the step that allowed German forestry science to become a rigorous\ntechnical and commercial discipline that could be codified and taught. A\ncondition of its rigor was that it severely bracketed, or assumed to be\nconstant, all variables except those bearing directly on the yield of the\nselected species and on the cost of growing and extracting them. As we shall\nsee with urban planning, revolutionary theory, collectivization, and rural\nresettlement, a whole world lying \"outside the brackets\" returned to haunt\nthis technical vision.\n\nIn the German case, the negative biological and ultimately commercial\nconsequences of the stripped-down forest became painfully obvious only after\nthe second rotation of conifers had been planted. \"It took about one century\nfor them [the negative consequences] to show up clearly. Many of the pure\nstands grew excellently in the first generation but already showed an amazing\nretrogression in the second generation. The reason for this is a very complex\none and only a simplified explanation can be given.... Then the whole nutrient\ncycle got out of order and eventually was nearly stopped.... Anyway, the drop\nof one or two site classes [used for grading the quality of timber] during two\nor three generations of pure spruce is a well known and frequently observed\nfact. This represents a production loss of 20 to 30 percent.\"22\n\nA new term, Waldsterben (forest death), entered the German vocabulary to\ndescribe the worst cases. An exceptionally complex process involving soil\nbuilding, nutrient uptake, and symbiotic relations among fungi, insects,\nmammals, and flora-which were, and still are, not entirely understood-was\napparently disrupted, with serious consequences. Most of these consequences\ncan be traced to the radical simplicity of the scientific forest.\n\nOnly an elaborate treatise in ecology could do justice to the subject of what\nwent wrong, but mentioning a few of the major effects of simplification will\nillustrate how vital many of the factors bracketed by scientific forestry\nturned out to be. German forestry 's attention to formal order and ease of\naccess for management and extraction led to the clearing of underbrush,\ndeadfalls, and snags (standing dead trees), greatly reducing the diversity of\ninsect, mammal, and bird populations so essential to soil-building\nprocesses.23 The absence of litter and woody biomass on the new forest floor\nis now seen as a major factor leading to thinner and less nutritious soils.24\nSame-age, same-species forests not only created a far less diverse habitat but\nwere also more vulnerable to massive storm-felling. The very uniformity of\nspecies and age among, say, Norway spruce also provided a favorable habitat to\nall the \"pests\" which were specialized to that species. Populations of these\npests built up to epidemic proportions, inflicting losses in yields and large\noutlays for fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, or rodenticides.25\nApparently the first rotation of Norway spruce had grown exceptionally well in\nlarge part because it was living off (or mining) the long-accumulated soil\ncapital of the diverse old-growth forest that it had replaced. Once that\ncapital was depleted, the steep decline in growth rates began.\n\nAs pioneers in scientific forestry, the Germans also became pioneers in\nrecognizing and attempting to remedy many of its undesirable consequences. To\nthis end, they invented the science of what they called \"forest hygiene.\" In\nplace of hollow trees that had been home to woodpeckers, owls, and other tree-\nnesting birds, the foresters provided specially designed boxes. Ant colonies\nwere artificially raised and implanted in the forest, their nests tended by\nlocal schoolchildren. Several species of spiders, which had disappeared from\nthe monocropped forest, were reintroduced.26 What is striking about these\nendeavors is that they are attempts to work around an impoverished habitat\nstill planted with a single species of conifers for production pur- poses.27\nIn this case, \"restoration forestry\" attempted with mixed results to create a\nvirtual ecology, while denying its chief sustaining condition: diversity.\n\nThe metaphorical value of this brief account of scientific production forestry\nis that it illustrates the dangers of dismembering an exceptionally complex\nand poorly understood set of relations and processes in order to isolate a\nsingle element of instrumental value. The instrument, the knife, that carved\nout the new, rudimentary forest was the razorsharp interest in the production\nof a single commodity. Everything that interfered with the efficient\nproduction of the key commodity was implacably eliminated. Everything that\nseemed unrelated to efficient production was ignored. Having come to see the\nforest as a commodity, scientific forestry set about refashioning it as a\ncommodity machine.28 Utilitarian simplification in the forest was an effective\nway of maximizing wood production in the short and intermediate term.\nUltimately, however, its emphasis on yield and paper profits, its relatively\nshort time horizon, and, above all, the vast array of consequences it had\nresolutely bracketed came back to haunt it.29\n\nEven in the realm of greatest interest-namely, the production of wood fiber-\nthe consequences of not seeing the forest for the trees sooner or later became\nglaring. Many were directly traceable to the basic simplification imposed in\nthe interest of ease of management and economic return: monoculture.\nMonocultures are, as a rule, more fragile and hence more vulnerable to the\nstress of disease and weather than polycultures are. As Richard Plochmann\nexpresses it, \"One further drawback, which is typical of all pure plantations,\nis that the ecology of the natural plant associations became unbalanced.\nOutside of the natural habitat, and when planted in pure stands, the physical\ncondition of the single tree weakens and resistance against enemies\ndecreases.\"30 Any unmanaged forest may experience stress from storms, disease,\ndrought, fragile soil, or severe cold. A diverse, complex forest, however,\nwith its many species of trees, its full complement of birds, insects, and\nmammals, is far more resilient-far more able to withstand and recover from\nsuch injuries-than pure stands. Its very diversity and complexity help to\ninoculate it against devastation: a windstorm that fells large, old trees of\none species will typically spare large trees of other species as well as small\ntrees of the same species; a blight or insect attack that threatens, say, oaks\nmay leave lindens and hornbeams unscathed. Just as a merchant who, not knowing\nwhat conditions her ships will face at sea, sends out scores of vessels with\ndifferent designs, weights, sails, and navigational aids stands a better\nchance of having much of her fleet make it to port, while a merchant who\nstakes everything on a single ship design and size runs a higher risk of\nlosing everything, forest biodiversity acts like an insurance policy. Like the\nenterprise run by the second merchant, the simplified forest is a more\nvulnerable system, especially over the long haul, as its effects on soil,\nwater, and \"pest\" populations become manifest. Such dangers can only partly be\nchecked by the use of artificial fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides.\nGiven the fragility of the simplified production forest, the massive outside\nintervention that was required to establish it-we might call it the\nadministrators' forest-is increasingly necessary in order to sustain it as\nwell.31\n\n#### Social Facts, Raw and Cooked\n\nSociety must be remade before it can be the object of quantification.\nCategories of people and things must be defined, measures must be\ninterchangeable; land and commodities must be conceived as represented by an\nequivalent in money. There is much of what Weber called rationalization in\nthis, and also a good deal of centralization.\n\n-Theodore M. Porter, \"Objectivity as Standardization\"\n\nThe administrators' forest cannot be the naturalists' forest. Even if the\necological interactions at play in the forest were known, they would\nconstitute a reality so complex and variegated as to defy easy shorthand\ndescription. The intellectual filter necessary to reduce the complexity to\nmanageable dimensions was provided by the state's interest in commercial\ntimber and revenue.\n\nIf the natural world, however shaped by human use, is too unwieldy in its\n\"raw\" form for administrative manipulation, so too are the actual social\npatterns of human interaction with nature bureaucratically indigestible in\ntheir raw form. No administrative system is capable of representing any\nexisting social community except through a heroic and greatly schematized\nprocess of abstraction and simplification. It is not simply a question of\ncapacity, although, like a forest, a human community is surely far too\ncomplicated and variable to easily yield its secrets to bureaucratic formulae.\nIt is also a question of purpose. State agents have no interest-nor should\nthey-in describ ing an entire social reality, any more than the scientific\nforester has an interest in describing the ecology of a forest in detail.\nTheir abstractions and simplifications are disciplined by a small number of\nobjectives, and until the nineteenth century the most prominent of these were\ntypically taxation, political control, and conscription. They needed only the\ntechniques and understanding that were adequate to these tasks. As we shall\nsee, here are some instructive parallels between the development of modern\n\"fiscal forestry\" and modern forms of taxable property in land. Premodern\nstates were no less concerned with tax receipts than are modern states. But,\nas with premodern state forestry, the taxation techniques and reach of the\npremodern state left much to be desired.\n\nAbsolutist France in the seventeenth century is a case in point.32 Indirect\ntaxes-excise levies on salt and tobacco, tolls, license fees, and the sale of\noffices and titles-were favored forms of taxation; they were easy to\nadminister and required little or nothing in the way of information about\nlandholding and income. The tax-exempt status of the nobility and clergy meant\nthat a good deal of the landed property was not taxed at all, transferring\nmuch of the burden to wealthy commoner farmers and the peasantry. Common land,\nalthough it was a vitally important subsistence resource for the rural poor,\nyielded no revenue either. In the eighteenth century, the physiocrats would\ncondemn all common property on two presumptive grounds: it was inefficiently\nexploited, and it was fiscally barren.33\n\nWhat must strike any observer of absolutist taxation is how wildly variable\nand unsystematic it was. James Collins has found that the main direct land\ntax, the taille, was frequently not paid at all and that no community paid\nmore than one-third of what they were assessed.34 The result was that the\nstate routinely relied on exceptional measures to overcome shortfalls in\nrevenue or to pay for new expenses, particularly military campaigns. The crown\nexacted \"forced loans\" (rentes, droits alienes) in return for annuities that\nit might or might not honor; it sold offices and titles (venalites d'offices);\nit levied exceptional hearth taxes (fouages extraordinaires); and, worst of\nall, it billeted troops directly in communities, often ruining the towns in\nthe process.35\n\nThe billeting of troops, a common form of fiscal punishment, is to modern\nforms of systematic taxation as the drawing and quartering of would-be\nregicides (so strikingly described by Michel Foucault at the beginning of\nDiscipline and Punish) is to modern forms of systematic incarceration of\ncriminals. Not that there was a great deal of choice involved. The state\nsimply lacked both the information and the administrative grid that would have\nallowed it to exact from its subjects a reliable revenue that was more closely\ntied to their actual capacity to pay. As with forest revenue, there was no\nalternative to rough-and-ready calculations and their corresponding\nfluctuations in yields. Fiscally, the premodern state was, to use Charles\nLindblom's felicitous phrase, \"all thumbs and no fingers\"; it was incapable of\nfine tuning.\n\nHere is where the rough analogy between forest management and taxation begins\nto break down. In the absence of reliable information about sustainable timber\nyield, the state might either inadvertently overexploit its resources and\nthreaten future supply or else fail to realize the level of proceeds the\nforest might sustain.36 The trees themselves, however, were not political\nactors, whereas the taxable subjects of the crown most certainly were. They\nsignaled their dissatisfaction by flight, by various forms of quiet resistance\nand evasion, and, in ex- tremis, by outright revolt. A reliable format for\ntaxation of subjects thus depended not just on discovering what their economic\nconditions were but also on trying to judge what exactions they would\nvigorously resist.\n\nHow were the agents of the state to begin measuring and codifying, throughout\neach region of an entire kingdom, its population, their landholdings, their\nharvests, their wealth, the volume of commerce, and so on? The obstacles in\nthe path of even the most rudimentary knowledge of these matters were\nenormous. The struggle to establish uniform weights and measures and to carry\nout a cadastral mapping of landholdings can serve as diagnostic examples. Each\nrequired a large, costly, long-term campaign against determined resistance.\nResistance came not only from the general population but also from local\npower-holders; they were frequently able to take advantage of the\nadministrative incoherence produced by differing interests and missions within\nthe ranks of officialdom. But in spite of the ebbs and flows of the various\ncampaigns and their national peculiarities, a pattern of adopting uniform\nmeasurements and charting cadastral maps ultimately prevailed.\n\nEach undertaking also exemplified a pattern of relations between local\nknowledge and practices on one hand and state administrative routines on the\nother, a pattern that will find echoes throughout this book. In each case,\nlocal practices of measurement and landholding were \"illegible\" to the state\nin their raw form. They exhibited a diversity and intricacy that reflected a\ngreat variety of purely local, not state, interests. That is to say, they\ncould not be assimilated into an administrative grid without being either\ntransformed or reduced to a convenient, if partly fictional, shorthand. The\nlogic behind the required shorthand was provided, as in scientific forestry,\nby the pressing material interests of rulers: fiscal receipts, military\nmanpower, and state security. In turn, this shorthand functioned, as did\nBeckmann's Normalbaume, as not just a description, however inadequate. Backed\nby state power through records, courts, and ultimately coercion, these state\nfictions transformed the reality they presumed to observe, although never so\nthoroughly as to precisely fit the grid.\n\n#### Forging the Tools of Legibility: Popular Measures, State Measures\n\nNonstate forms of measurement grew from the logic of local practice. As such,\nthey shared some generic features despite their bewildering variety-features\nthat made them an impediment to administrative uniformity. Thanks to the\nsynthesis of the medievalist Witold Kula, the reasoning that animated local\npractices of measurement may be set out fairly succinctly.37\n\nMost early measures were human in scale. One sees this logic at work in such\nsurviving expressions as a \"stone's throw\" or \"within earshot\" for distances\nand a \"cartload,\" a \"basketful,\" or a \"handful\" for volume. Given that the\nsize of a cart or basket might vary from place to place and that a stone's\nthrow might not be precisely uniform from person to person, these units of\nmeasurement varied geographically and temporally. Even measures that were\napparently fixed might be deceptive. The pinte in eighteenth-century Paris,\nfor example, was equivalent to .93 liters, whereas in Seine-en-Montagne it was\n1.99 liters and in Precy-sous-Thil, an astounding 3.33 liters. The aune, a\nmeasure of length used for cloth, varied depending on the material (the unit\nfor silk, for instance, was smaller than that for linen), and across France\nthere were at least seventeen different aunes.38\n\nLocal measures were also relational or \"commensurable.\"39 Virtually any\nrequest for a judgment of measure allows a range of responses depending on the\ncontext of the request. In the part of Malaysia with which I am most familiar,\nif one were to ask \"How far is it to the next village?\" a likely response\nwould be \"Three rice-cookings.\" The answer assumes that the questioner is\ninterested in how much time it will take to get there, not how many miles away\nit is. In varied terrain, of course, distance in miles is an utterly\nunreliable guide to travel time, especially when the traveler is on foot or\nriding a bicycle. The answer also expresses time not in minutes-until\nrecently, wristwatches were rarebut in units that are locally meaningful.\nEveryone knows how long it takes to cook the local rice. Thus an Ethiopian\nresponse to a query about how much salt is required for a dish might be \"Half\nas much as to cook a chicken.\" The reply refers back to a standard that\neveryone is expected to know. Such measurement practices are irreducibly\nlocal, inasmuch as regional differences in, say, the type of rice eaten or the\npreferred way of cooking chicken will give different results.\n\nMany local units of measurement are tied practically to particular activities.\nMarathi peasants, as Arjun Appadurai notes, express the desired distance\nbetween the onion sets they plant in terms of handbreadths. When one is moving\nalong a field row, the hand is, well, the most handy gauge. In similar\nfashion, a common measure for twine or rope is the distance between the thumb\nand elbow because this corresponds with how it is wrapped and stored. As with\nsetting onions, the process of measuring is embedded in the activity itself\nand requires no separate operation. Such measurements, moreover, are often\napproximate; they are only as exact as the task at hand requires.40 Rainfall\nmay be said to be abundant or inadequate if the context of the query implies\nan interest in a particular crop. And a reply in terms of inches of rainfall,\nhowever accurate, would also fail to convey the desired information; it\nignores such vital matters as the timing of the rain. For many purposes, an\napparently vague measurement may communicate more valuable information than a\nstatistically exact figure. The cultivator who reports that his rice yield\nfrom a plot is anywhere between four and seven baskets is conveying more\naccurate information, when the focus of attention is on the variability of the\nyield, than if he reported a ten-year statistical average of 5.6 baskets.\n\nThere is, then, no single, all-purpose, correct answer to a question implying\nmeasurement unless we specify the relevant local concerns that give rise to\nthe question. Particular customs of measurement are thus situationally,\ntemporally, and geographically bound.\n\nNowhere is the particularity of customary measurement more evident than with\ncultivated land. Modern abstract measures of land by surface area-so many\nhectares or acres-are singularly uninformative figures to a family that\nproposes to make its living from these acres. Telling a farmer only that he is\nleasing twenty acres of land is about as helpful as telling a scholar that he\nhas bought six kilograms of books. Customary measures of land have therefore\ntaken a variety of forms corresponding to those aspects of the land that are\nof greatest practical interest. Where land was abundant and manpower or\ndraftpower scarce, the most meaningful gauge of land was often the number of\ndays required to plow or to weed it. A plot of land in nineteenthcentury\nFrance, for example, would be described as representing so many morgen or\njournals (days of work) and as requiring a specific kind of work (homee,\nbechee, fauchee). How many morgen were represented by a field of, say, ten\nacres could vary greatly; if the land were rocky and steeply pitched, it might\nrequire twice as much labor to work than if it were rich bottomland. The\nmorgen would also differ from place to place depending on the strength of\nlocal draftpower and the crops sown, and it would differ from time to time as\ntechnology (plow tips, yokes, harnesses) affected the work a man could\naccomplish in a day.\n\nLand might also be evaluated according to the amount of seed required to sow\nit. If the soil were very good, a field would be densely sown, whereas poor\nland would be more lightly seeded. The amount of seed sown to a field is in\nfact a relatively good proxy for average yield, as the sowing is done in\nanticipation of average growing conditions, while the actual seasonal yield\nwould be more variable. Given a particular crop regimen, the amount of seed\nsown would indicate roughly how productive a field had been, although it would\nreveal little about how arduous the land was to cultivate or how variable the\nharvests were. But the average yield from a plot of land is itself a rather\nabstract figure. What most farmers near the subsistence margin want to know\nabove all is whether a particular farm will meet their basic needs reliably.\nThus small farms in Ireland were described as a \"farm of one cow\" or a \"farm\nof two cows\" to indicate their grazing capacity to those who lived largely by\nmilk products and potatoes. The physical area a farm might comprise was of\nlittle interest compared to whether it would feed a particular family.4'\n\nTo grasp the prodigious variety of customary ways of measuring land, we would\nhave to imagine literally scores of \"maps\" constructed along very different\nlines than mere surface area. I have in mind the sorts of maps devised to\ncapture our attention with a kind of fun-house effect in which, say, the size\nof a country is made proportional to its population rather than its\ngeographical size, with China and India looming menacingly over Russia,\nBrazil, and the United States, while Libya, Australia, and Greenland virtually\ndisappear. These types of customary maps (for there would be a great many)\nwould construct the landscape according to units of work and yield, type of\nsoil, accessibility, and ability to provide subsistence, none of which would\nnecessarily accord with surface area. The measurements are decidedly local,\ninterested, contextual, and historically specific. What meets the subsistence\nneeds of one family may not meet the subsistence needs of another. Factors\nsuch as local crop regimens, labor supply, agricultural technology, and\nweather ensure that the standards of evaluation vary from place to place and\nover time. Directly apprehended by the state, so many maps would represent a\nhopelessly bewildering welter of local standards. They definitely would not\nlend themselves to aggregation into a single statistical series that would\nallow state officials to make meaningful comparisons.\n\n##### The Politics of Measurement\n\nThus far, this account of local measurement practices risks giving the\nimpression that, although local conceptions of distance, area, volume, and so\non were different from and more varied than the unitary abstract standards a\nstate might favor, they were nevertheless aiming at objective accuracy. That\nimpression would be false. Every act of measurement was an act marked by the\nplay of power relations. To understand measurement practices in early modern\nEurope, as Kula demonstrates, one must relate them to the contending interests\nof the major estates: aristocrats, clergy, merchants, artisans, and serfs.\n\nA good part of the politics of measurement sprang from what a contemporary\neconomist might call the \"stickiness\" of feudal rents. Noble and clerical\nclaimants often found it difficult to increase feudal dues directly; the\nlevels set for various charges were the result of long struggle, and even a\nsmall increase above the customary level was viewed as a threatening breach of\ntradition.42 Adjusting the measure, however, represented a roundabout way of\nachieving the same end. The local lord might, for example, lend grain to\npeasants in smaller baskets and insist on repayment in larger baskets. He\nmight surreptitiously or even boldly enlarge the size of the grain sacks\naccepted for milling (a monopoly of the domain lord) and reduce the size of\nthe sacks used for measuring out flour; he might also collect feudal dues in\nlarger baskets and pay wages in kind in smaller baskets. While the formal\ncustom governing feudal dues and wages would thus remain intact (requiring,\nfor example, the same number of sacks of wheat from the harvest of a given\nholding), the actual transaction might increasingly favor the lord.43 The\nresults of such fiddling were far from trivial. Kula estimates that the size\nof the bushel (boisseau) used to collect the main feudal rent (taille)\nincreased by one-third between 1674 and 1716 as part of what was called the\nreaction feodale.44\n\nEven when the unit of measurement-say, the bushel-was apparently agreed upon\nby all, the fun had just begun. Virtually everywhere in early modern Europe\nwere endless micropolitics about how baskets might be adjusted through wear,\nbulging, tricks of weaving, moisture, the thickness of the rim, and so on. In\nsome areas the local standards for the bushel and other units of measurement\nwere kept in metallic form and placed in the care of a trusted official or\nelse literally carved into the stone of a church or the town hall .41 Nor did\nit end there. How the grain was to be poured (from shoulder height, which\npacked it somewhat, or from waist height?), how damp it could be, whether the\ncontainer could be shaken down, and, finally, if and how it was to be leveled\noff when full were subjects of long and bitter controversy. Some arrangements\ncalled for the grain to be heaped, some for a \"halfheap,\" and still others for\nit to be leveled or \"striked\" (ras). These were not trivial matters. A feudal\nlord could increase his rents by 25 percent by insisting on receiving wheat\nand rye in heaped bushels.46 If, by custom, the bushel of grain was to be\nstriked, then a further micropolitics erupted over the strickle. Was it to be\nround, thereby packing in grain as it was rolled across the rim, or was it to\nbe sharp-edged? Who would apply the strickle? Who could be trusted to keep it?\n\nA comparable micropolitics, as one might expect, swirled around the unit of\nland measurement. A common measure of length, the ell, was used to mark off\nthe area to be plowed or weeded as a part of feudal labor dues. Once again,\nthe lengths and widths in ells were \"sticky,\" having been established through\nlong struggle. It was tempting for a lord or overseer to try raising labor\ndues indirectly by increasing the length of the ell. If the attempt were\nsuccessful, the formal rules of corvee labor would not be violated, but the\namount of work extracted would increase. Perhaps the stickiest of all measures\nbefore the nineteenth century was the price of bread. As the most vital\nsubsistence good of premodern times, it served as a kind of cost-of-living\nindex, and its cost was the subject of deeply held popular customs about its\nrelationship to the typical urban wage. Kula shows in remarkable detail how\nbakers, afraid to provoke a riot by directly violating the \"just price,\"\nmanaged nevertheless to manipulate the size and weight of the loaf to\ncompensate to some degree for changes in the price of wheat and rye flour.\"\n\n##### Statecraft and the Hieroglyphics of Measurement\n\nBecause local standards of measurement were tied to practical needs, because\nthey reflected particular cropping patterns and agricultural technology,\nbecause they varied with climate and ecology, because they were \"an attribute\nof power and an instrument of asserting class privilege,\" and because they\nwere \"at the center of bitter class struggle,\" they represented a mind-\nboggling problem for statecraft .41 Efforts to simplify or standardize\nmeasures recur like a leitmotif throughout French history-their reappearance a\nsure sign of previous failure. More modest attempts to simply codify local\npractices and create conversion tables were quickly overtaken and rendered\nobsolete by changes on the ground. The king's ministers were confronted, in\neffect, with a patchwork of local measurement codes, each of which had to be\ncracked. It was as if each district spoke its own dialect, one that was\nunintelligible to outsiders and at the same time liable to change without\nnotice. Either the state risked making large and potentially damaging\nmiscalculations about local conditions, or it relied heavily on the advice of\nlocal trackers-the nobles and clergy in the Crown's confidence-who, in turn,\nwere not slow to take full advantage of their power.\n\nThe illegibility of local measurement practices was more than an\nadministrative headache for the monarchy. It compromised the most vital and\nsensitive aspects of state security. Food supply was the Achilles heel of the\nearly modern state; short of religious war, nothing so menaced the state as\nfood shortages and the resulting social upheavals. Without comparable units of\nmeasurement, it was difficult if not impossible to monitor markets, to compare\nregional prices for basic commodities, or to regulate food supplies\neffectively.49 Obliged to grope its way on the basis of sketchy information,\nrumor, and self-interested local reports, the state often responded belatedly\nand inappropriately. Equity in taxation, another sensitive political issue,\nwas beyond the reach of a state that found it difficult to know the basic\ncomparative facts about harvests and prices. A vigorous effort to collect\ntaxes, to requisition for mil itary garrisons, to relieve urban shortages, or\nany number of other measures might, given the crudeness of state intelligence,\nactually provoke a political crisis. Even when it did not jeopardize state\nsecurity, the Babel of measurement produced gross inefficiencies and a pattern\nof either undershooting or overshooting fiscal targets.50 No effective central\nmonitoring or controlled comparisons were possible without standard, fixed\nunits of measurement.\n\n##### Simplification and Standardization of Measurement\n\nThe conquerors of our days, peoples or princes, want their empire to possess a\nunified surface over which the superb eye of power can wander without\nencountering any inequality which hurts or limits its view. The same code of\nlaw, the same measures, the same rules, and if we could gradually get there,\nthe same language; that is what is proclaimed as the perfection of the social\norganization.... The great slogan of the day is uniformity.\n\n-Benjamin Constant, De 1'esprit de conquete\n\nIf scientific forestry's project of creating a simplified and legible forest\nencountered opposition from villagers whose usage rights were being\nchallenged, the political opposition to standard and legible units of\nmeasurement was even more refractory. The power to establish and impose local\nmeasures was an important feudal prerogative with material consequences which\nthe aristocracy and clergy would not willingly surrender. Testimony to their\ncapacity to thwart standardization is evident in the long series of abortive\ninitiatives by absolutist rulers who tried to insist on some degree of\nuniformity. The very particularity of local feudal practices and their\nimpenetrability to would-be centralizers helped to underwrite the autonomy of\nlocal spheres of power.\n\nThree factors, in the end, conspired to make what Kula calls the \"metrical\nrevolution\" possible. First, the growth of market exchange encouraged\nuniformity in measures. Second, both popular sentiment and Enlightenment\nphilosophy favored a single standard throughout France. Finally, the\nRevolution and especially Napoleonic state building actually enforced the\nmetric system in France and the empire.\n\nLarge-scale commercial exchange and long-distance trade tend to promote common\nstandards of measurement. For relatively smallscale trade, grain dealers could\ntransact with several suppliers as long as they knew the measure each was\nusing. They might actually profit from their superior grasp of the profusion\nof units, much as smugglers take advantage of small differences in taxes and\ntariffs. Beyond a certain point, however, much of commerce is composed of long\nchains of transactions, often over great distances, between anonymous buyers\nand sellers. Such trade is greatly simplified and made legible by standard\nweights and measures. Whereas artisanal products were typically made by a\nsingle producer according to the desires of a particular cus tomer and carried\na price specific to that object, the mass-produced commodity is made by no one\nin particular and is intended for any purchaser at all. In a sense, the virtue\nof the mass commodity is its reliable uniformity. In proportion, then, as the\nvolume of commerce grew and the goods exchanged became increasingly\nstandardized (a ton of wheat, a dozen plow tips, twenty cart wheels), there\nwas a growing tendency to accept widely agreed upon units of measurement.\nOfficials and physiocrats alike were convinced that uniform measures were the\nprecondition for creating a national market and promoting rational economic\naction.51\n\nThe perennial state project of unifying measures throughout the kingdom\nreceived a large degree of popular support in the eighteenth century, thanks\nto the reaction feodale. Aiming to maximize the return on their estates,\nowners of feudal domains, many of them arrivistes, achieved their goal in part\nby manipulating units of measurement. This sense of victimization was evident\nin the cahiers of grievances prepared for the meeting of the Estates General\njust before the Revolution. The cahiers of the members of the Third Estate\nconsistently called for equal measures (although this was hardly their main\ngrievance), whereas the cahiers of the clergy and nobility were silent,\npresumably indicating their satisfaction with the status quo on this issue.\nThe following petition from Brittany is typical of the way in which an appeal\nfor unitary measures could be assimilated to devotion to the Crown: \"We beg\nthem [the king, his family, and his chief minister] to join with us in\nchecking the abuses being perpetrated by tyrants against that class of\ncitizens which is kind and considerate and which, until this day has been\nunable to present its very grievances to the very foot of the throne, and now\nwe call on the King to mete out justice, and we express our most sincere\ndesire for but one king, one law, one weight, and one measure \"52\n\nFor centralizing elites, the universal meter was to older, particularistic\nmeasurement practices as a national language was to the existing welter of\ndialects. Such quaint idioms would be replaced by a new universal gold\nstandard, just as the central banking of absolutism had swept away the local\ncurrencies of feudalism. The metric system was at once a means of\nadministrative centralization, commercial reform, and cultural progress. The\nacademicians of the revolutionary republic, like the royal academicians before\nthem, saw the meter as one of the intellectual instruments that would make\nFrance \"revenue-rich, militarily potent, and easily administered.\"\" Common\nmeasures, it was supposed, would spur the grain trade, make land more\nproductive (by permitting easier comparisons of price and productivity), and,\nnot incidentally, lay the groundwork for a national tax code .14 But the\nreformers also had in mind a genuine cultural revolution. \"As mathematics was\nthe language of science, so would the metric system be the language of\ncommerce and industry,\" serving to unify and transform French society\" A\nrational unit of measurement would promote a rational citizenry.\n\nThe simplification of measures, however, depended on that other revolutionary\npolitical simplification of the modern era: the concept of a uniform,\nhomogeneous citizenship. As long as each estate operated within a separate\nlegal sphere, as long as different categories of people were unequal in law,\nit followed that they might also have unequal rights with respect to\nmeasures.56 The idea of equal citizenship, the abstraction of the \"unmarked\"\ncitizen, can be traced to the Enlightenment and is evident in the writings of\nthe Encyclopedists.57 For the Encyclopedists, the cacophony among\nmeasurements, institutions, inheritance laws, taxation, and market regulations\nwas the great obstacle to the French becoming a single people. They envisioned\na series of centralizing and rationalizing reforms that would transform France\ninto a national community where the same codified laws, measures, customs, and\nbeliefs would everywhere prevail. It is worth noting that this project\npromotes the concept of national citizenship-a national French citizen\nperambulating the kingdom and encountering exactly the same fair, equal\nconditions as the rest of his compatriots. In place of a welter of\nincommensurable small communities, familiar to their inhabitants but\nmystifying to outsiders, there would rise a single national society perfectly\nlegible from the center. The proponents of this vision well understood that\nwhat was at stake was not merely administrative convenience but also the\ntransformation of a people: \"The uniformity of customs, viewpoints, and\nprinciples of action will, inevitably, lead to a greater community of habits\nand predispositions.\"\" The abstract grid of equal citizenship would create a\nnew reality: the French citizen.\n\nThe homogenization of measures, then, was part of a larger, emancipatory\nsimplification. At one stroke the equality of all French people before the law\nwas guaranteed by the state; they were no longer mere subjects of their lords\nand sovereign but bearers of inalienable rights as citizens.59 All the\nprevious \"natural\" distinctions were now \"denaturalized\" and nullified, at\nleast in law.60 In an unprecedented revolutionary context where an entirely\nnew political system was being created from first principles, it was surely no\ngreat matter to legislate uniform weights and measures. As the revolutionary\ndecree read: \"The centuries old dream of the masses of only one just measure\nhas come true! The Revolution has given the people the meter. \"61\n\nProclaiming the universal meter was far simpler than ensuring that it became\nthe daily practice of French citizens. The state could insist on the exclusive\nuse of its units in the courts, in the state school system, and in such\ndocuments as property deeds, legal contracts, and tax codes. Outside these\nofficial spheres, the metric system made its way only very slowly. In spite of\na decree for confiscating toise sticks in shops and replacing them with meter\nsticks, the populace continued to use the older system, often marking their\nmeter sticks with the old measures. Even as late as 1828 the new measures were\nmore a part of le pays legal than of le pays reel. As Chateaubriand remarked,\n\"Whenever you meet a fellow who, instead of talking arpents, toises, and\npieds, refers to hectares, meters, and centimeters, rest assured, the man is a\nprefect.\"62\n\n#### Land Tenure: Local Practice and Fiscal Shorthand\n\nThe revenue of the early modern state came mainly from levies on commerce and\nland, the major sources of wealth. For commerce, this implied an array of\nexcise taxes, tolls and market duties, licensing fees, and tariffs. For landed\nwealth, this meant somehow attaching every parcel of taxable property to an\nindividual or an institution responsible for paying the tax on it. As\nstraightforward as this procedure seems in the context of the modern state,\nits achievement was enormously difficult for at least two reasons. First, the\nactual practices of customary land tenure were frequently so varied and\nintricate as to defy any one-to-one equation of taxpayer and taxable property.\nAnd second, as was the case with standardizing measurement, there were social\nforces whose interests could only be damaged by the unified and transparent\nset of property relations desired by the state's fiscal agents. In the end,\nthe centralizing state succeeded in imposing a novel and (from the center)\nlegible property system, which, as had the work of the scientific foresters,\nnot only radically abridged the practices that the system described but at the\nsame time transformed those practices to align more closely with their\nshorthand, schematic reading.\n\n##### An Illustration\n\nNegara mawi tata, desa ma%vi cara (The capital has its order, the village its\ncustoms).\n\n-Javanese proverb\n\nA hypothetical case of customary land tenure practices may help demonstrate\nhow difficult it is to assimilate such practices to the barebones schema of a\nmodern cadastral map. The patterns I will describe are an amalgam of practices\nI have encountered in the literature of or in the course of fieldwork in\nSoutheast Asia, and although the case is hypothetical, it is not unrealistic.\n\nLet us imagine a community in which families have usufruct rights to parcels\nof cropland during the main growing season. Only certain crops, however, may\nbe planted, and every seven years the usufruct land is redistributed among\nresident families according to each family's size and its number of able-\nbodied adults. After the harvest of the mainseason crop, all cropland reverts\nto common land where any family may glean, graze their fowl and livestock, and\neven plant quickly maturing, dry-season crops. Rights to graze fowl and\nlivestock on pastureland held in common by the village is extended to all\nlocal families, but the number of animals that can be grazed is restricted\naccording to family size, especially in dry years when forage is scarce.\nFamilies not using their grazing rights can give them to other villagers but\nnot to outsiders. Everyone has the right to gather firewood for normal family\nneeds, and the village blacksmith and baker are given larger allotments. No\ncommercial sale from village woodlands is permitted.\n\nTrees that have been planted and any fruit they may bear are the property of\nthe family who planted them, no matter where they are now growing. Fruit\nfallen from such trees, however, is the property of anyone who gathers it.\nWhen a family fells one of its trees or a tree is felled by a storm, the trunk\nbelongs to the family, the branches to the immediate neighbors, and the \"tops\"\n(leaves and twigs) to any poorer villager who carries them off. Land is set\naside for use or leasing out by widows with children and dependents of\nconscripted males. Usufruct rights to land and trees may be let to anyone in\nthe village; the only time they may be let to someone outside the village is\nif no one in the community wishes to claim them.\n\nAfter a crop failure leading to a food shortage, many of these arrangements\nare readjusted. Better-off villagers are expected to assume some\nresponsibility for poorer relatives-by sharing their land, by hiring them, or\nby simply feeding them. Should the shortage persist, a council composed of\nheads of families may inventory food supplies and begin daily rationing. In\ncases of severe shortages or famine, the women who have married into the\nvillage but have not yet borne children will not be fed and are expected to\nreturn to their native village. This last practice alerts us to the\ninequalities that often prevail in local customary tenure; single women,\njunior males, and anyone defined as falling outside the core of the community\nare clearly disadvantaged.\n\nThis description could be further elaborated. It is itself a simplification,\nbut it does convey some of the actual complexity of property relations in\ncontexts where local customs have tended to prevail. To describe the usual\npractices in this fashion, as if they were laws, is itself a distortion.\nCustoms are better understood as a living, negotiated tissue of practices\nwhich are continually being adapted to new ecological and social\ncircumstances-including, of course, power relations. Customary systems of\ntenure should not be romanticized; they are usually riven with inequalities\nbased on gender, status, and lineage. But because they are strongly local,\nparticular, and adaptable, their plas ticity can be the source of\nmicroadjustments that lead to shifts in prevailing practice.\n\nImagine a lawgiver whose only concern was to respect land practices. Imagine,\nin other words, a written system of positive law that attempted to represent\nthis complex skein of property relations and land tenure. The mind fairly\nboggles at the clauses, sub-clauses, and subsub-clauses that would be required\nto reduce these practices to a set of regulations that an administrator might\nunderstand, never mind enforce. And even if the practices could be codified,\nthe resulting code would necessarily sacrifice much of their plasticity and\nsubtle adaptability. The circumstances that might provoke a new adaptation are\ntoo numerous to foresee, let alone specify, in a regulatory code. That code\nwould in effect freeze a living process. Changes in the positive code designed\nto reflect evolving practice would represent at best a jerky and mechanical\nadaptation.\n\nAnd what of the next village, and the village after that? Our hypothetical\ncode-giver, however devilishly clever and conscientious, would find that the\ncode devised to fit one set of local practices would not travel well. Each\nvillage, with its own particular history, ecology, cropping patterns, kinship\nalignments, and economic activity, would require a substantially new set of\nregulations. At the limit, there would be at least as many legal codes as\nthere were communities.\n\nAdministratively, of course, such a cacophony of local property regulations\nwould be a nightmare. The nightmare is experienced not by those whose\nparticular practices are being represented but by those state officials who\naspire to a uniform, homogeneous, national administrative code. Like the\n\"exotic\" units of weights and measures, local land tenure practice is\nperfectly legible to all who live within it from day to day. Its details may\noften be contested and far from satisfactory to all its practitioners, but it\nis completely familiar; local residents have no difficulty in grasping its\nsubtleties and using its flexible provisions for their own purposes. State\nofficials, on the other hand, cannot be expected to decipher and then apply a\nnew set of property hieroglyphs for each jurisdiction. Indeed, the very\nconcept of the modern state presupposes a vastly simplified and uniform\nproperty regime that is legible and hence manipulable from the center.\n\nMy use of the term \"simple\" to describe modern property law, whose intricacies\nprovide employment to armies of legal professionals, will seem grossly\nmisplaced. It is surely the case that property law has in many respects become\nan impenetrable thicket for ordinary citizens. The use of the term \"simple\" in\nthis context is thus both relative and perspectival. Modern freehold tenure is\ntenure that is mediated through the state and therefore readily decipherable\nonly to those who have sufficient training and a grasp of the state\nstatutes.63 Its relative simplicity is lost on those who cannot break the\ncode, just as the relative clarity of customary tenure is lost on those who\nlive outside the village.\n\nThe fiscal or administrative goal toward which all modern states aspire is to\nmeasure, codify, and simplify land tenure in much the same way as scientific\nforestry reconceived the forest. Accommodating the luxuriant variety of\ncustomary land tenure was simply inconceivable. The historical solution, at\nleast for the liberal state, has typically been the heroic simplification of\nindividual freehold tenure. Land is owned by a legal individual who possesses\nwide powers of use, inheritance, or sale and whose ownership is represented by\na uniform deed of title enforced through the judicial and police institutions\nof the state. Just as the flora of the forest were reduced to Normalbaume, so\nthe complex tenure arrangements of customary practice are reduced to freehold,\ntransferrable title. In an agrarian setting, the administrative landscape is\nblanketed with a uniform grid of homogeneous land, each parcel of which has a\nlegal person as owner and hence taxpayer. How much easier it then becomes to\nassess such property and its owner on the basis of its acreage, its soil\nclass, the crops it normally bears, and its assumed yield than to untangle the\nthicket of common property and mixed forms of tenure.\n\nThe crowning artifact of this mighty simplification is the cadastral map.\nCreated by trained surveyors and mapped to a given scale, the cadastral map is\na more or less complete and accurate survey of all landholdings. Since the\ndriving logic behind the map is to create a manageable and reliable format for\ntaxation, the map is associated with a property register in which each\nspecified (usually numbered) lot on the map is linked to an owner who is\nresponsible for paying its taxes. The cadastral map and property register are\nto the taxation of land as the maps and tables of the scientific forester were\nto the fiscal exploitation of the forest.\n\n##### The Code Rural That Almost Was\n\nThe rulers of postrevolutionary France confronted a rural society that was a\nnearly impenetrable web of feudal and revolutionary practices. It was\ninconceivable that they could catalogue its complexities, let alone\neffectively eliminate them, in the short run. Ideologically, for example,\ntheir commitment to equality and liberty was contradicted by customary rural\ncontracts like those used by craft guilds, which still employed the terms\n\"master\" (maitre) and \"servant\" (serviteur). As rulers of a new nation-not a\nkingdom-they were likewise offended by the absence of an overall legal\nframework for social relations. For some, a new civil code covering all\nFrenchmen seemed as if it would be sufficient.64 But for bourgeois owners of\nrural property who, along with their noble neighbors, had been threatened by\nthe local uprisings of the Revolution and La Grand Peur and, more generally,\nby the aggressiveness of an emboldened and autonomous peasantry, an explicit\ncode rural seemed necessary to underwrite their security.\n\nIn the end, no postrevolutionary rural code attracted a winning coalition,\neven amid a flurry of Napoleonic codes in nearly all other realms. For our\npurposes, the history of the stalemate is instructive. The first proposal for\na code, which was drafted between 1803 and 1807, would have swept away most\ntraditional rights (such as common pasturage and free passage through others'\nproperty) and essentially recast rural property relations in the light of\nbourgeois property rights and freedom of contract.-' Although the proposed\ncode prefigured certain modern French practices, many revolutionaries blocked\nit because they feared that its hands-off liberalism would allow large\nlandholders to recreate the subordination of feudalism in a new guise.--\n\nA reexamination of the issue was then ordered by Napoleon and presided over by\nJoseph Verneilh Puyrasseau. Concurrently, Depute Lalouette proposed to do\nprecisely what I supposed, in the hypothetical example, was impossible. That\nis, he undertook to systematically gather information about all local\npractices, to classify and codify them, and then to sanction them by decree.\nThe decree in question would become the code rural. Two problems undid this\ncharming scheme to present the rural populace with a rural code that simply\nreflected its own practices. The first difficulty was in deciding which\naspects of the literally \"infinite diversity\" of rural production relations\nwere to be represented and codified.,' Even in a particular locality,\npractices varied greatly from farm to farm and over time; any codification\nwould be partly arbitrary and artificially static. To codify local practices\nwas thus a profoundly political act. Local notables would be able to sanction\ntheir preferences with the mantle of law, whereas others would lose customary\nrights that they depended on. The second difficulty was that Lalouette's plan\nwas a mortal threat to all the state centralizers and economic modernizers for\nwhom a legible, national property regime was the precondition of progress. As\nSerge Aberdam notes, \"The Lalouette project would have brought about exactly\nwhat Merlin de Douai and the bourgeois, revolutionary jurists always sought to\navoid.\",\" Neither Lalouette's nor Verneilh's proposed code was ever passed,\nbecause they, like their predecessor in 1807, seemed to be designed to\nstrengthen the hand of the landowners.\n\n##### The Illegibility of Communal Tenure\n\nThe premodern and early modern state, as we have noted, dealt more with\ncommunities than with individuals when it came to taxes. Some apparently\nindividual taxes, such as the notorious Russian \"soul tax,\" which was\ncollected from all subjects, were actually paid directly by the communities or\nindirectly through the nobles whose subjects they were. Failure to deliver the\nrequired sum usually led to collective punishment.69 The only agents of\ntaxation who regularly reached to the level of the household and its\ncultivated fields were the local nobility and clergy in the course of\ncollecting feudal dues and the religious tithe. For its part, the state had\nneither the administrative tools nor the information to penetrate to this\nlevel.\n\nThe limitations on state knowledge were partly due to the complexity and\nvariability of local production. This was not the most important reason,\nhowever. The collective form of taxation meant that it was generally in the\ninterest of local officials to misrepresent their situation in order to\nminimize the local tax and conscription burden. To this end, they might\nminimize the local population, systematically understate the acreage under\ncultivation, hide new commercial profits, exaggerate crop losses after storms\nand droughts, and so on.70 The point of the cadastral map and land register\nwas precisely to eliminate this fiscal feudalism and rationalize the fiscal\ntake of the state. Just as the scientific forester needed an inventory of\ntrees to realize the commercial potential of the forest, so the fiscal\nreformer needed a detailed inventory of landownership to realize the maximum,\nsustainable revenue yield.71\n\nAssuming that the state had the will to challenge the resistance of the local\nnobles and elites and the financial resources to undertake a full cadastral\nsurvey (which was both time-consuming and expensive), it faced other obstacles\nas well. In particular, some communal forms of tenure simply could not be\nadequately represented in cadastral form. Rural living in seventeenth- and\nearly eighteenth-century Denmark, for example, was organized by ejerlav, whose\nmembers had certain rights for using local arable, waste, and forest land. It\nwould have been impossible in such a community to associate a household or\nindividual with a particular holding on a cadastral map. The Norwegian large\nfarm (gard) posed similar problems. Each household held rights to a given\nproportion of the value (skyld) of the farm, not to the plot of land; none of\nthe joint owners could call a specific part of the farm his own.72 Although it\nwas possible to estimate the arable land of each community and, making some\nassumptions about crop yields and subsistence needs, arrive at a plausible tax\nburden, these villagers derived a substantial part of their livelihood from\nthe commons by fishing, forestry, collecting resin, hunting, and making\ncharcoal. Monitoring this kind of income was almost impossible. Nor would\ncrude estimates of the value of the commons solve the problem, for the\ninhabitants of nearby villages often shared one another's commons (even though\nthe practice was outlawed). The mode of production in such communities was\nsimply incompatible with the assumption of individual freehold tenure implicit\nin a cadastral map. It was claimed, although the evi dence is not convincing,\nthat common property was less productive than freehold property.73 The state's\ncase against communal forms of land tenure, however, was based on the correct\nobservation that it was fiscally illegible and hence fiscally less productive.\nRather than trying, like the hapless Lalouette, to bring the map into line\nwith reality, the historical resolution has generally been for the state to\nimpose a property system in line with its fiscal grid.\n\nAs long as common property was abundant and had essentially no fiscal value,\nthe illegibility of its tenure was no problem. But the moment it became scarce\n(when \"nature\" became \"natural resources\"), it became the subject of property\nrights in law, whether of the state or of the citizens. The history of\nproperty in this sense has meant the inexorable incorporation of what were\nonce thought of as free gifts of nature: forests, game, wasteland, prairie,\nsubsurface minerals, water and watercourses, air rights (rights to the air\nabove buildings or surface area), breathable air, and even genetic sequences,\ninto a property regime. In the case of common-property farmland, the\nimposition of freehold property was clarifying not so much for the local\ninhabitantsthe customary structure of rights had always been clear enough to\nthem -as it was for the tax official and the land speculator. The cadastral\nmap added documentary intelligence to state power and thus provided the basis\nfor the synoptic view of the state and a supralocal market in land.74\n\nAn example may help to clarify the process of installing a new, more legible\nproperty regime. The case of two prerevolutionary Russian villages provides a\nnearly textbook example of state attempts to create individual tenure in\nkeeping with its convictions about agricultural growth and administrative\norder. Most of rural Russia, even after the emancipation of 1861, was a model\nof fiscal illegibility. Communal forms of tenure prevailed, and the state had\nlittle or no knowledge of who cultivated which strips of land or what their\nyields and income were.\n\nNovoselok village had a varied economy of cultivation, grazing, and forestry,\nwhereas Khotynitsa village was limited to cultivation and some grazing\n(figures 3 and 4). The complex welter of strips was designed to ensure that\neach village household received a strip of land in every ecological zone. An\nindividual household might have as many as ten to fifteen different plots\nconstituting something of a representative sample of the village's ecological\nzones and microclimates. The distribution spread a family's risks prudently,\nand from time to time the land was reshuffled as families grew or shrunk.75\n\nIt was enough to make the head of a cadastral surveyor swim. At first glance\nit seems as if the village itself would need a staff of professional surveyors\nto get things right. But in practice the system, called interstripping, was\nquite simple to those who lived it. The strips of land were generally straight\nand parallel so that a readjustment could be made by moving small stakes along\njust one side of a field, without having to think of areal dimensions. Where\nthe other end of the field was not parallel, the stakes could be shifted to\ncompensate for the fact that the strip lay toward the narrower or wider end of\nthe field. Irregular fields were divided, not according to area, but according\nto yield. To the eye-and certainly to those involved in cadastral mapping-the\npattern seemed convoluted and irrational. But to those familiar with it, it\nwas simple enough and worked admirably for their purposes.\n\n![](img0008.jpg)\n\n3\\. Novoselok village before the Stolypin Reform\n\n![](img0009.jpg)\n\n4\\. Khotynitsa village before the Stolypin Reform\n\nThe dream of state officials and agrarian reformers, at least since\nemancipation, was to transform the open-field system into a series of\nconsolidated, independent farmsteads on what they took to be the western\nEuropean model. They were driven by the desire to break the hold of the\ncommunity over the individual household and to move from collective taxation\nof the whole community to a tax on individual landholders. As in France,\nfiscal goals were very much connected to reigning ideas of agricultural\nprogress. Under Count Sergei Witte and Petr Stolypin, as George Yaney notes,\nplans for reform shared a common vision of how things were and how they needed\nto be: \"First tableau: poor peasants, crowded together in villages, suffering\nfrom hunger, running into each other with their plows on their tiny strips.\nSecond tableau: agriculture specialist agent leads a few progressive peasants\noff to new lands, leaving those remaining more room. Third tableau: departing\npeasants, freed from restraints of strips, set up khutor [integral farmsteads\nwith dwellings] on new fields and adapt latest methods. Those who remain,\nfreed of village and family restraints, plunge into a demand economy-all are\nricher, more productive, the cities get fed, and the peasants are not\nproletarianized.\"76 It was abundantly clear that the prejudicial attitude\ntoward interstripping was based as much on the autonomy of the Russian\nvillage, its illegibility to outsiders, and prevailing dogma about scientific\nagriculture as it was on hard evidence.\" The state officials and agrarian\nreformers reasoned that, once given a consolidated, private plot, the peasant\nwould suddenly want to get rich and would organize his household into an\nefficient workforce and take up scientific agriculture. The Stolypin Reform\ntherefore went forward, and cadastral order was brought to both villages in\nthe wake of the reform (figures 5 and 6).\n\n![](img0010.jpg)\n\n5\\. Novoselok village after the Stolypin Reform\n\nIn Novoselok village, seventeen independent farmsteads (khutor) were created\nin a way that aimed to give each household a share of meadow, arable, and\nforest. In Khotynitsa village, ten khutor were created as well as seventy-\neight farms (otrub), whose owners continued to dwell in the village center. As\na cadastral matter, the new farms were mappable, easily legible from above and\noutside, and, since each was owned by an identifiable person, assessable.\n\nTaken alone, the maps shown in figures 5 and 6 are misleading. Such model\nvillages suggest efficient cadastral teams working their way diligently\nthrough the countryside and turning open-field chaos into tidy lit tle farms.\nReality was something else. In fact, the dream of orderly, rectangular fields\nwas approximated only on newly settled land, where the surveyor faced little\ngeographical or social resistance.78 Elsewhere, the reformers were generally\nthwarted, despite tremendous pressure to produce integral farms. There were\nunauthorized consolidations, although they were forbidden; there were also\n\"paper consolidations,\" in which the new farmers continued to farm their\nstrips as before.79 The best evidence that the agricultural property system\nhad in fact not become legible to central tax officials was the immensely\ndamaging procurement policies pursued by the czarist government during World\nWar I. No one knew what a reasonable levy on grain or draft animals might be;\nas a result, some farmers were ruined, while others managed to hoard grain and\nlivestock.80 The same experience of forced procurement without adequate\nknowledge of landholdings and wealth was repeated again after the October\nRevolution during the period of War Communism.$'\n\n![](img0011.jpg)\n\n6\\. Khotynitsa village after the Stolypin Reform\n\n##### The Cadastral Map as Objective Information for Outsiders\n\nThe value of the cadastral map to the state lies in its abstraction and\nuniversality. In principle, at least, the same objective standard can be\napplied throughout the nation, regardless of local context, to produce a\ncomplete and unambiguous map of all landed property. The completeness of the\ncadastral map depends, in a curious way, on its abstract sketchiness, its lack\nof detail-its thinness. Taken alone, it is essentially a geometric\nrepresentation of the borders or frontiers between parcels of land. What lies\ninside the parcel is left blank-unspecified-since it is not germane to the map\nplotting itself.\n\nSurely many things about a parcel of land are far more important than its\nsurface area and the location of its boundaries. What kind of soil it has,\nwhat crops can be grown on it, how hard it is to work, and how close it is to\na market are the first questions a potential buyer might ask. These are\nquestions a tax assessor would also want to ask. From a capitalist\nperspective, the physical dimensions of land are beside the point. But these\nother qualities can become relevant (especially to the state) only after the\nterrain to which they apply has been located and measured. And unlike\nidentifying location and dimension, identifying these qualities involves\njudgments that are complex, susceptible to fraud, and easily overtaken by\nevents. Crop rotations and yields may change, new tools or machines may\ntransform cultivation, and markets may shift. The cadastral survey, by\ncontrast, is precise, schematic, general, and uniform. Whatever its other\ndefects, it is the precondition of a tax regimen that comprehensively links\nevery patch of land with its owner-the taxpayer.RZ In this spirit, the survey\nfor a 1807 Dutch land tax (inspired by Napoleonic France) stressed that all\nsurveyors were to use the same measurements, surveyors' instruments were to be\nperiodically inspected to ensure conformity, and all maps were to be drawn up\non a uniform scale of 1:2,880.13\n\nLand maps in general and cadastral maps in particular are designed to make the\nlocal situation legible to an outsider. For purely local purposes, a cadastral\nmap was redundant. Everyone knew who held, say, the meadow by the river, the\nvalue of the fodder it yielded, and the feudal dues it carried; there was no\nneed to know its precise dimensions. A substantial domain might have the kind\nof prose map, or terrier, that one finds in old deeds (\"from the large oak\ntree, north 120 feet to the river bank, thence ..:'), with a notation about\nthe holder's obligations to the domain. One imagines such a document proving\nvaluable to a young heir, new to the management of a domain. But a proper map\nseems to have come into use especially when a brisk market in land developed.\nThe Netherlands was thus a leader in land mapping because of its early\ncommercialization and because each speculator who invested in the draining of\nland by windmill wanted to know in advance precisely what plot of the newly\nopened land he would be entitled to. The map was especially crucial to the new\nbourgeois owners of landed estates, for it allowed them to survey a large\nterritory at a glance. Its miniaturization helped it to serve as an aide-\nmemoire when the property consisted of many small parcels or the owner was not\nintimately familiar with the terrain.\n\nAs early as 1607, an English surveyor, John Norden, sold his services to the\naristocracy on the premise that the map was a substitute for the tour of\ninspection: \"A plot rightly drawne by true information, dis- cribeth so the\nlively image of a manor, and every branch and member of the same, as the lord\nsitting in his chayre, may see what he hath, and where and how he lyeth, and\nin whole use and occupation of every particular is upon suddaine view.\" 14 A\nnational tax administration requires the same logic: a legible, bureaucratic\nformula which a new official can quickly grasp and administer from the\ndocuments in his office.\n\n##### What Is Missing in This Picture?\n\nAdministrative man recognizes that the world he perceives is a drastically\nsimplified model of the buzzing, blooming confusion that constitutes the real\nworld. He is content with the gross simplification because he believes that\nthe real world is mostly empty-that most of the facts of the real world have\nno great relevance to any particular situation he is facing and that most\nsignificant chains of causes and consequences are short and simple.\n\n-Herbert Simon\n\nIsaiah Berlin, in his study of Tolstoy, compared the hedgehog, who knew \"one\nbig thing,\" to the fox, who knew many things. The scientific forester and the\ncadastral official are like the hedgehog. The sharply focused interest of the\nscientific foresters in commercial lumber and that of the cadastral officials\nin land revenue constrain them to finding clear-cut answers to one question.\nThe naturalist and the farmer, on the other hand, are like the fox. They know\na great many things about forests and cultivable land. Although the forester's\nand cadastral of- ficial's range of knowledge is far narrower, we should not\nforget that their knowledge is systematic and synoptic, allowing them to see\nand understand things a fox would not grasp.85 What I want to emphasize here,\nhowever, is how this knowledge is gained at the expense of a rather static and\nmyopic view of land tenure.\n\nThe cadastral map is very much like a still photograph of the current in a\nriver. It represents the parcels of land as they were arranged and owned at\nthe moment the survey was conducted. But the current is always moving, and in\nperiods of major social upheaval and growth, a cadastral survey may freeze a\nscene of great turbulence.16 Changes are taking place on field boundaries;\nland is being subdivided or consolidated by inheritance or purchase; new\ncanals, roads, and railways are being cut; land use is changing; and so forth.\nInasmuch as these particular changes directly affect tax assessments, there\nare provisions for recording them on the map or in a title register. The\naccumulation of annotations and marginalia at some point render the map\nillegible, whereupon a more up-to-date but still static map must be drawn and\nthe process repeated.\n\nNo operating land-revenue system can stop at the mere identification of parcel\nand ownership. Other schematic facts, themselves static, must be created to\narrive at some judgment of a sustainable tax burden. Land may be graded by\nsoil class, how well it is watered, what crops are grown on it, and its\npresumed average yield, which is often checked by sample crop-cuttings. These\nfacts are themselves changing, or they are averages that may mask great\nvariation. Like the still photo of the cadastral map, they grow more\nunrealistic with time and must be reexamined.\n\nThese state simplifications, like all state simplifications, are always far\nmore static and schematic than the actual social phenomena they presume to\ntypify. The farmer rarely experiences an average crop, an average rainfall, or\nan average price for his crops. Much of the long history of rural tax revolts\nin early modern Europe and elsewhere can be illuminated by the lack of fit\nbetween an unyielding fiscal claim, on one hand, and an often wildly\nfluctuating capacity of the rural population to meet that claim, on the\nother.\"' And yet, even the most equitable, wellintentioned cadastral system\ncannot be uniformly administered except on the basis of stable units of\nmeasurement and calculation. It can no more reflect the actual complexity of a\nfarmer's experience than the scientific forester's schemes can reflect the\ncomplexity of the naturalist's forest.\"\n\nGoverned by a practical, concrete objective, the cadastral lens also ignored\nanything lying outside its sharply defined field of vision. This was reflected\nin a loss of detail in the survey itself. Surveyors, one recent Swedish study\nfound, made the fields more geometrically regular than they in fact were.\nIgnoring small jogs and squiggles made their job easier and did not materially\naffect the outcome.89 Just as the commercial forester found it convenient to\noverlook minor forest products, so the cadastral official tended to ignore all\nbut the main commercial use of a field. The fact that a field designated as\ngrowing wheat or hay might also be a significant source of bedding straw,\ngleanings, rabbits, birds, frogs, and mushrooms was not so much unknown as\nignored lest it needlessly complicate a straightforward administrative\nformula.90 The most significant instance of myopia, of course, was that the\ncadastral map and assessment system considered only the dimensions of the land\nand its value as a productive asset or as a commodity for sale. Any value that\nthe land might have for subsistence purposes or for the local ecology was\nbracketed as aesthetic, ritual, or sentimental values.\n\n##### Transformation and Resistance\n\nThe cadastral map is an instrument of control which both reflects and\nconsolidates the power of those who commission it.... The cadastral map is\npartisan: where knowledge is power, it provides comprehensive information to\nbe used to the advantage of some and the detriment of others, as rulers and\nruled were well aware in the tax struggles of the 18th and 19th centuries.\nFinally, the cadastral map is active: in portraying one reality, as in the\nsettlement of the new world or in India, it helps obliterate the old.\n\n-Roger J. P Kain and Elizabeth Baigent, The Cadastral Map\n\nThe shorthand formulas through which tax officials must apprehend reality are\nnot mere tools of observation. By a kind of fiscal Heisenberg principle, they\nfrequently have the power to transform the facts they take note of.\n\nThe door-and-window tax established in France under the Directory and\nabolished only in 1917 is a striking case in pointy' Its originator must have\nreasoned that the number of windows and doors in a dwelling was proportional\nto the dwelling's size. Thus a tax assessor need not enter the house or\nmeasure it but merely count the doors and windows. As a simple, workable\nformula, it was a brilliant stroke, but it was not without consequences.\nPeasant dwellings were subsequently designed or renovated with the formula in\nmind so as to have as few openings as possible. While the fiscal losses could\nbe recouped by rais ing the tax per opening, the long-term effects on the\nhealth of the rural population lasted for more than a century.\n\nThe novel state-imposed form of land tenure was far more revolutionary than a\ndoor-and-window tax. It established a whole new institutional nexus. However\nsimple and uniform the new tenure system was to an administrator, it flung\nvillagers willy-nilly into a world of title deeds, land offices, fees,\nassessments, and applications. They faced powerful new specialists in the form\nof land clerks, surveyors, judges, and lawyers whose rules of procedure and\ndecisions were unfamiliar.\n\nWhere the new tenure system was a colonial imposition-that is, where it was\ntotally unfamiliar, where it was imposed by alien conquerors using an\nunintelligible language and institutional context, and where local practices\nbore no resemblance to freehold tenure-the consequences were far-reaching. The\npermanent settlement in India, for example, created a new class who, because\nthey paid the taxes on the land, became full owners with rights of inheritance\nand sale where none had existed earlier.92 At the same time, literally\nmillions of cultivators, tenants, and laborers lost their customary rights of\naccess to the land and its products. Those in the colonies who first plumbed\nthe mysteries of the new tenure administration enjoyed unique opportunities.\nThus the Vietnamese secretaires and interpretes who served as intermediaries\nbetween the French officials in the Mekong Delta and their Vietnamese subjects\nwere in a position to make great fortunes. By concentrating on the legal\npaperwork, such as title deeds, and the appropriate fees, they occasionally\nbecame landlords to whole villages of cultivators who had imagined they had\nopened common land free for the taking. The new intermediaries, of course,\nmight occasionally use their knowledge to see their compatriots safely through\nthe new legal thicket. Whatever their conduct, their fluency in a language of\ntenure specifically designed to be legible and transparent to administrators,\ncoupled with the illiteracy of the rural population to whom the new tenure was\nindecipherable, brought about a momentous shift in power relations.93 What was\nsimplifying to an official was mystifying to most cultivators.\n\nFreehold title and standard land measurement were to central taxation and the\nreal-estate market what central bank currency was to the marketplace.94 By the\nsame token, they threatened to destroy a great deal of local power and\nautonomy. It is no wonder, then, that they should have been so vigorously\nresisted. In the eighteenth-century European context, any general cadastral\nsurvey was by definition a gambit of centralization; the local clergy and\nnobility were bound to see both their own taxing powers and the exemptions\nthey enjoyed menaced. Commoners were likely to see it as a pretext for an\nadditional local tax. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the great \"centralizer\" of\nabsolutism, proposed to conduct a national cadastral survey of France, but he\nwas thwarted in 1679 by the combined opposition of the aristocracy and clergy.\nAfter the Revolution more than a century later, the radical Francois-Noel\nBabeuf, in his \"Projet de cadastre perpetuel,\" dreamed of a perfectly\negalitarian land reform in which everyone would get an equal parcel.95 He too\nwas thwarted.\n\nWe must keep in mind not only the capacity of state simplifications to\ntransform the world but also the capacity of the society to modify, subvert,\nblock, and even overturn the categories imposed upon it. Here it is useful to\ndistinguish what might be called facts on paper from facts on the ground. As\nSally Falk Moore and many others have emphasized, the land-office records may\nserve as the basis for taxation, but they may have little to do with the\nactual rights to the land. Paper owners may not be the effective owners.96\nRussian peasants, as we saw, might register a \"paper\" consolidation while\ncontinuing to interstrip. Land invasions, squatting, and poaching, if\nsuccessful, represent the exercise of de facto property rights which are not\nrepresented on paper. Certain land taxes and tithes have been evaded or defied\nto the point where they have become dead letters.97 The gulf between land\ntenure facts on paper and facts on the ground is probably greatest at moments\nof social turmoil and revolt. But even in more tranquil times, there will\nalways be a shadow land-tenure system lurking beside and beneath the official\naccount in the land-records office. We must never assume that local practice\nconforms with state theory.\n\nAll centralizing states recognized the value of a uniform, comprehensive\ncadastral map. Carrying out the mapmaking, however, was another matter. As a\nrule of thumb, cadastral mapping was earlier and more comprehensive where a\npowerful central state could impose itself on a relatively weak civil society.\nWhere, by contrast, civil society was well organized and the state relatively\nweak, cadastral mapping was late, often voluntary, and fragmentary. Thus\nNapoleonic France was mapped much earlier than England, where the legal\nprofession managed for a long time to stymie this threat to its local,\nincomeearning function. It followed from the same logic that conquered\ncolonies ruled by fiat would often be cadastrally mapped before the\nmetropolitan nation that ordered it. Ireland may have been the first. After\nCromwell's conquest, as Ian Hacking notes, \"Ireland was completely surveyed\nfor land, buildings, people, and cattle under the directorship of William\nPetty, in order to facilitate the rape of that nation by the English in\n1679.\"911\n\nWhere the colony was a thinly populated settler-colony, as in North America or\nAustralia, the obstacles to a thorough, uniform cadastral grid were minimal.\nThere it was a question less of mapping preexisting patterns of land use than\nof surveying parcels of land that would be given or sold to new arrivals from\nEurope and of ignoring indigenous peoples and their common-property regimes.99\nThomas Jefferson, with an eye trained by Enlightenment rationalism, imagined\ndividing the United States west of the Ohio River into \"hundreds\"-squares\nmeasuring ten miles by ten miles-and requiring settlers to take the parcels of\nland as so designated.\n\nThe geometrical clarity of Jefferson's proposal was not merely an aesthetic\nchoice; he claimed that irregular lots facilitated fraud. To reinforce his\ncase, he cited the experience of Massachusetts, where actual landholdings were\n10 percent to 100 percent greater than what had been granted by deed.1°° Not\nonly did the regularity of the grid create legibility for the taxing\nauthority, but it was a convenient and cheap way to package land and market it\nin homogeneous units. The grid facilitated the commoditization of land as much\nas the calculation of taxes and boundaries. Administratively, it was also\ndisarmingly simple. Land could be registered and titled from a distance by\nsomeone who possessed virtually no local knowledge.10' Once it was in place,\nthe scheme had some of the impersonal, mechanical logic of the foresters'\ntables. But in practice, land titling in Jefferson's plan (which was modified\nby Congress to provide for rectangular lots and townships that were thirtysix\nsquare miles) did not always follow the prescribed pattern.\n\n![](img0012.jpg)\n\n7\\. The survey landscape, Castleton, North Dakota\n\nThe Torrens system of land titling, developed in Australia and New Zealand in\nthe 1860s, provided a lithographed, presurveyed grid representing allotments\nthat were registered to settlers on a first-come, first-served basis. It was\nthe quickest and most economical means yet devised to sell land, and it was\nlater adopted in many British colonies. The more homogeneous and rigid the\ngeometric grid, however, the more likely it was to run afoul of the natural\nfeatures of the nonconforming landscape. The possibilities for surprises was\nnicely captured s satirical verse from New Zealand.\n\n![](page0078_0000.svg)\n\n![](page0078_0001.svg)\n\nThe cadastral survey was but one technique in the growing armory of the\nutilitarian modern state. 101 Where the premodern state was content with a\nlevel of intelligence sufficient to allow it to keep order, extract taxes, and\nraise armies, the modern state increasingly aspired to \"take in charge\" the\nphysical and human resources of the nation and make them more productive.\nThese more positive ends of statecraft required a much greater knowledge of\nthe society. And an inventory of land, people, incomes, occupations,\nresources, and deviance was the logical place to begin. \"The need for the\nincreasingly bureaucratic state to organize itself and control its resources\ngave an impulse to the collection of vital and other statistics; to forestry\nand rational agriculture; to surveying and exact cartography; and to public\nhygiene and climatology.\" 104\n\nAlthough the purposes of the state were broadening, what the state wanted to\nknow was still directly related to those purposes. The nineteenth-century\nPrussian state, for example, was very much interested in the ages and sexes of\nimmigrants and emigrants but not in their religions or races; what mattered to\nthe state was keeping track of possible draft dodgers and maintaining a supply\nof men of military age. 101 The state's increasing concern with productivity,\nhealth, sanitation, education, transportation, mineral resources, grain\nproduction, and investment was less an abandonment of the older objectives of\nstatecraft than a broadening and deepening of what those objectives entailed\nin the modern world.\n\n\n# 2 Cities, People, and  \nLanguage\n\n![](img0013.jpg)\n\nAnd the Colleges of the Cartographers set up a Map of the Empire which had the\nsize of the Empire itself and coincided with it point by point.... Succeeding\ngenerations understood that this Widespread Map was Useless, and not without\nImpiety they abandoned it to the Inclemencies of the Sun and the Winters.\n\n-Suarez Miranda, Viajes de varones prudentes (1658)\n\nAn aerial view of a town built during the Middle Ages or the oldest quarters\n(rnedina) of a Middle Eastern city that has not been greatly tampered with has\na particular look. It is the look of disorder. Or, to put it more precisely,\nthe town conforms to no overall abstract form. Streets, lanes, and passages\nintersect at varying angles with a density that resembles the intricate\ncomplexity of some organic processes. In the case of a medieval town, where\ndefense needs required walls and perhaps moats, there may be traces of inner\nwalls superseded by outer walls, much like the growth rings of a tree. A\nrepresentation of Bruges in about 1500 illustrates the pattern (figure 8).\nWhat definition there is to the city is provided by the castle green, the\nmarketplace, and the river and canals that were (until they silted up) the\nlifeblood of this textile-trading city.\n\nThe fact that the layout of the city, having developed without any overall\ndesign, lacks a consistent geometric logic does not mean that it was at all\nconfusing to its inhabitants. One imagines that many of its cobbled streets\nwere nothing more than surfaced footpaths traced by repeated use. For those\nwho grew up in its various quarters, Bruges would have been perfectly\nfamiliar, perfectly legible. Its very alleys and lanes would have closely\napproximated the most common daily movements. For a stranger or trader\narriving for the first time, however, the town was almost certainly confusing,\nsimply because it lacked a repetitive, abstract logic that would allow a\nnewcomer to orient herself. The cityscape of Bruges in 1500 could be said to\nprivilege local knowledge over outside knowledge, including that of external\npolitical authori ties.' It functioned spatially in much the same way a\ndifficult or unintelligible dialect would function linguistically. As a\nsemipermeable membrane, it facilitated communication within the city while\nremaining stubbornly unfamiliar to those who had not grown up speaking this\nspecial geographic dialect.\n\nHistorically, the relative illegibility to outsiders of some urban\nneighborhoods (or of their rural analogues, such as hills, marshes, and\nforests) has provided a vital margin of political safety from control by\noutside elites. A simple way of determining whether this margin exists is to\nask if an outsider would have needed a local guide (a native tracker) in order\nto find her way successfully. If the answer is yes, then the community or\nterrain in question enjoys at least a small measure of insulation from outside\nintrusion. Coupled with patterns of local solidarity, this insulation has\nproven politically valuable in such disparate contexts as eighteenth- and\nearly nineteenth-century urban riots over bread prices in Europe, the Front de\nLiberation Nationale's tenacious resistance to the French in the Casbah of\nAlgiers,2 and the politics of the bazaar that helped to bring down the Shah of\nIran. Illegibility, then, has been and remains a reliable resource for\npolitical autonomy'\n\nStopping short of redesigning cities in order to make them more legible (a\nsubject that we shall soon explore), state authorities endeav ored to map\ncomplex, old cities in a way that would facilitate policing and control. Most\nof the major cities of France were thus the subject of careful military\nmapping (reconnaissances militaires), particularly after the Revolution. When\nurban revolts occurred, the authorities wanted to be able to move quickly to\nthe precise locations that would enable them to contain or suppress the\nrebellions effectively.4\n\n![](img0014.jpg)\n\n8\\. Bruges circa 1500, from a painting in the Town Hall, Bruges\n\nStates and city planners have striven, as one might expect, to overcome this\nspatial unintelligibility and to make urban geography transparently legible\nfrom without. Their attitude toward what they regarded as the higgledy-\npiggledy profusion of unplanned cities was not unlike the attitude of\nforesters to the natural profusion of the unplanned forest. The origin of\ngrids or geometrically regular settlements may lie in a straightforward\nmilitary logic. A square, ordered, formulaic military camp on the order of the\nRoman castra has many advantages. Soldiers can easily learn the techniques of\nbuilding it; the commander of the troops knows exactly in which disposition\nhis subalterns and various troops lie; and any Roman messenger or officer who\narrives at the camp will know where to find the officer he seeks. On a more\nspeculative note, a far-flung, polyglot empire may find it symbolically useful\nto have its camps and towns laid out according to formula as a stamp of its\norder and authority. Other things being equal, the city laid out according to\na simple, repetitive logic will be easiest to administer and to police.\n\nWhatever the political and administrative conveniences of a geometric\ncityscape, the Enlightenment fostered a strong aesthetic that looked with\nenthusiasm on straight lines and visible order. No one expressed the prejudice\nmore clearly than Descartes: \"These ancient cities that were once mere\nstraggling villages and have become in the course of time great cities are\ncommonly quite poorly laid out compared to those well-ordered towns that an\nengineer lays out on a vacant plane as it suits his fancy. And although, upon\nconsidering one-by-one the buildings in the former class of towns, one finds\nas much art or more than one finds in the latter class of towns, still, upon\nseeing how the buildings are arranged-here a large one, there a small one-and\nhow they make the streets crooked and uneven, one will say that it is chance\nmore than the will of some men using their reason that has arranged them\nthus.\"'\n\nDescartes's vision conjures up the urban equivalent of the scientific forest:\nstreets laid out in straight lines intersecting at right angles, buildings of\nuniform design and size, the whole built according to a single, overarching\nplan.\n\nThe elective affinity between a strong state and a uniformly laid out city is\nobvious. Lewis Mumford, the historian of urban form, locates the modern\nEuropean origin of this symbiosis in the open, legible baroque style of the\nItalian city-state. He claims, in terms that Descartes would have found\ncongenial, \"It was one of the triumphs of the baroque mind to organize space,\nto make it continuous, reduce it to measure and order.\"6 More to the point,\nthe baroque redesigning of medieval citieswith its grand edifices, vistas,\nsquares, and attention to uniformity, proportion, and perspective-was intended\nto reflect the grandeur and awesome power of the prince. Aesthetic\nconsiderations frequently won out over the existing social structure and the\nmundane functioning of the city. \"Long before the invention of bulldozers,\"\nMumford adds, \"the Italian military engineer developed, through his\nprofessional specialization in destruction, a bulldozing habit of mind: one\nthat sought to clear the ground of encumbrances, so as to make a clear\nbeginning on its own inflexible mathematical lines.\"'\n\nThe visual power of the baroque city was underwritten by scrupulous attention\nto the military security of the prince from internal as well as external\nenemies. Thus both Alberti and Palladio thought of main thoroughfares as\nmilitary roads (viae militaires). Such roads had to be straight, and, in\nPalladio's view, \"the ways will be more convenient if they are made everywhere\nequal: that is to say that there will be no part in them where armies may not\neasily march.\"'\n\nThere are, of course, many cities approximating Descartes's model. For obvious\nreasons, most have been planned from the ground up as new, often utopian\ncities.9 Where they have not been built by imperial decrees, they have been\ndesigned by their founding fathers to accommodate more repetitive and uniform\nsquares for future settlement.10 A bird's-eye view of central Chicago in the\nlate nineteenth century (William Penn's Philadelphia or New Haven would do\nequally well) serves as an example of the grid city (figure 9).\n\nFrom an administrator's vantage point, the ground plan of Chicago is nearly\nutopian. It offers a quick appreciation of the ensemble, since the entirety is\nmade up of straight lines, right angles, and repetitions.\" Even the rivers\nseem scarcely to interrupt the city's relentless symmetry. For an outsider-or\na policeman-finding an address is a comparatively simple matter; no local\nguides are required. The knowledge of local citizens is not especially\nprivileged vis-a-vis that of outsiders. If, as is the case in upper Manhattan,\nthe cross streets are consecutively numbered and are intersected by longer\navenues, also consecutively numbered, the plan acquires even greater\ntransparency.\" The aboveground order of a grid city facilitates its\nunderground order in the layout of water pipes, storm drains, sewers, electric\ncables, natural gas lines, and subways-an order no less important to the\nadministrators of a city. Delivering mail, collecting taxes, conducting a\ncensus, moving supplies and people in and out of the city, putting down a riot\nor insurrection, digging for pipes and sewer lines, finding a felon or\nconscript (providing he is at the address given), and planning public\ntransportation, water supply, and trash removal are all made vastly simpler by\nthe logic of the grid.\n\nThree aspects of this geometric order in human settlement bear emphasis. The\nfirst is that the order in question is most evident, not at street level, but\nrather from above and from outside. Like a marcher in a parade or like a\nsingle riveter in a long assembly line, a pedestrian in the middle of this\ngrid cannot instantly perceive the larger design of the city. The symmetry is\neither grasped from a representation-it is in fact what one would expect if\none gave a schoolchild a ruler and a blank piece of paper-or from the vantage\npoint of a helicopter hovering far above the ground: in short, a God's-eye\nview, or the view of an absolute ruler. This spatial fact is perhaps inherent\nin the process of urban or architectural planning itself, a process that\ninvolves miniaturization and scale models upon which patron and planner gaze\ndown, exactly as if they were in a helicopter.13 There is, after all, no other\nway of visually imagining what a large-scale construction project will look\nlike when it is completed except by a miniaturization of this kind. It\nfollows, I believe, that such plans, which have the scale of toys, are judged\nfor their sculptural properties and visual order, often from a perspective\nthat no or very few human observers will ever replicate.\n\n![](img0015.jpg)\n\n9\\. Map of downtown Chicago, circa 1893\n\nThe miniaturization imaginatively achieved by scale models of cities or\nlandscapes was practically achieved with the airplane. The mapping tradition\nof the bird's-eye view, evident in the map of Chicago, was no longer a mere\nconvention. By virtue of its great distance, an aerial view resolved what\nmight have seemed ground-level confusion into an apparently vaster order and\nsymmetry. It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of the airplane for\nmodernist thought and planning. By offering a perspective that flattened the\ntopography as if it were a canvas, flight encouraged new aspirations to\n\"synoptic vision, rational control, planning, and spatial order.\"\"\n\nA second point about an urban order easily legible from outside is that the\ngrand plan of the ensemble has no necessary relationship to the order of life\nas it is experienced by its residents. Although certain state services may be\nmore easily provided and distant addresses more easily located, these apparent\nadvantages may be negated by such perceived disadvantages as the absence of a\ndense street life, the intrusion of hostile authorities, the loss of the\nspatial irregularities that foster coziness, gathering places for informal\nrecreation, and neighborhood feeling. The formal order of a geometrically\nregular urban space is just that: formal order. Its visual regimentation has a\nceremonial or ideological quality, much like the order of a parade or a\nbarracks. The fact that such order works for municipal and state authorities\nin administering the city is no guarantee that it works for citizens.\nProvisionally, then, we must remain agnostic about the relation between formal\nspatial order and social experience.\n\nThe third notable aspect of homogeneous, geometrical, uniform property is its\nconvenience as a standardized commodity for the market. Like Jefferson's\nscheme for surveying or the Torrens system for titling open land, the grid\ncreates regular lots and blocks that are ideal for buying and selling.\nPrecisely because they are abstract units detached from any ecological or\ntopographical reality, they resemble a kind of currency which is endlessly\namenable to aggregation and fragmentation. This feature of the grid plan suits\nequally the surveyor, the planner, and the real-estate speculator.\nBureaucratic and commercial logic, in this instance, go hand in hand. As\nMumford notes, \"The beauty of this mechanical pattern, from the commercial\nstandpoint, should be plain. This plan offers the engineer none of those\nspecial problems that irregular parcels and curved boundary lines present. An\noffice boy could figure out the number of square feet involved in a street\nopening or in a sale of land: even a lawyer's clerk could write a description\nof the necessary deed of sale, merely by filling in with the proper dimensions\nthe standard document. With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal\nengineer could, without the slightest training as either an architect or a\nsociologist, 'plan' a metropolis, with its standard lots, its standard blocks,\nits standard width streets.... The very absence of more specific adaptation to\nlandscape or to human purpose only increased, by its very indefiniteness, its\ngeneral usefulness for exchange.' 15\n\nThe vast majority of Old World cities are, in fact, some historical amalgam of\na Bruges and a Chicago. Although more than one politician, dictator, and city\nplanner have devised plans for the total recasting of an existing city, these\ndreams came at such cost, both financial and political, that they have rarely\nleft the drawing boards. Piecemeal planning, by contrast, is far more common.\nThe central, older core of many cities remains somewhat like Bruges, whereas\nthe newer outskirts are more likely to exhibit the marks of one or more plans.\nSometimes, as in the sharp contrast between old Delhi and the imperial capital\nof New Delhi, the divergence is formalized.\n\nOccasionally, authorities have taken draconian steps to retrofit an existing\ncity. The redevelopment of Paris by the prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann,\nunder Louis Napoleon was a grandiose public works program stretching from 1853\nto 1869. Haussmann's vast scheme absorbed unprecedented amounts of public\ndebt, uprooted tens of thousands of people, and could have been accomplished\nonly by a single executive authority not directly accountable to the\nelectorate.\n\nThe logic behind the reconstruction of Paris bears a resemblance to the logic\nbehind the transformation of old-growth forests into scientific forests\ndesigned for unitary fiscal management. There was the same emphasis on\nsimplification, legibility, straight lines, central management, and a synoptic\ngrasp of the ensemble. As in the case of the forest, much of the plan was\nachieved. One chief difference, however, was that Haussmann's plan was devised\nless for fiscal reasons than for its impact on the conduct and sensibilities\nof Parisians. While the plan did create a far more legible fiscal space in the\ncapital, this was a byproduct of the desire to make the city more governable,\nprosperous, healthy, and architecturally imposing.16 The second difference\nwas, of course, that those uprooted by the urban planning of the Second Empire\ncould, and did, strike back. As we shall see, the retrofitting of Paris\nforeshadows many of the paradoxes of authoritarian high-modernist planning\nthat we will soon examine in greater detail.\n\nThe plan reproduced in figure 10 shows the new boulevards constructed to\nHaussmann's measure as well as the prerevolutionary inner boulevards, which\nwere widened and straightened.\" But the retrofit, seen merely as a new street\nmap, greatly underestimates the transformation. For all the demolition and\nconstruction required, for all the new legibility added to the street plan,\nthe new pattern bore strong traces of an accommodation with \"old-growth\"\nParis. The outer boulevards, for example, follow the line of the older customs\n(octroi) wall of 1787\\. But Haussmann's scheme was far more than a traffic\nreform. The new legibility of the boulevards was accompanied by changes that\nrevolutionized daily life: new aqueducts, a much more effective sewage system,\nnew rail lines and terminals, centralized markets (Les Halles), gas lines and\nlighting, and new parks and public squares.\" The new Paris created by Louis\nNapoleon became, by the turn of the century, a widely admired public works\nmiracle and shrine for would-be planners from abroad.\n\nAt the center of Louis Napoleon's and Haussmann's plans for Paris lay the\nmilitary security of the state. The redesigned city was, above all, to be made\nsafe against popular insurrections. As Haussmann wrote, \"The order of this\nQueen-city is one of the main pre-conditions of general [public] security.\" 1\nBarricades had gone up nine times in the twenty-five years before 1851. Louis\nNapoleon and Haussmann had seen the revolutions of 1830 and 1848; more\nrecently, the June Days and resistance to Louis Napoleon's coup represented\nthe largest insurrection of the century. Louis Napoleon, as a returned exile,\nwas well aware of how tenuous his hold on power might prove.\n\n![](img0016.jpg)\n\n10\\. Map of Paris, 1870, showing the principal new streets built between 1850\nand 1870\n\nThe geography of insurrection, however, was not evenly distributed across\nParis. Resistance was concentrated in densely packed, workingclass quartiers,\nwhich, like Bruges, had complex, illegible street plans.20 The 1860 annexation\nof the \"inner suburbs\" (located between the customs wall and the outer\nfortifications and containing 240,000 residents) was explicitly designed to\ngain mastery over a ceinture sauvage that had thus far escaped police control.\nHaussmann described this area as a \"dense belt of suburbs, given over to\ntwenty different administrations, built at random, covered by an inextricable\nnetwork of narrow and tortuous public ways, alleys, and dead-ends, where a\nnomadic population without any real ties to the land [property] and without\nany effective surveillance, grows at a prodigious speed.\"21 Within Paris\nitself, there were such revolutionary foyers as the Marais and especially the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine, both of which had been determined centers of\nresistance to Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat.\n\nThe military control of these insurrectionary spaces-spaces that had not yet\nbeen well mapped-was integral to Haussmann's plan.22 A series of new avenues\nbetween the inner boulevards and the customs wall was designed to facilitate\nmovement between the barracks on the outskirts of the city and the subversive\ndistricts. As Haussmann saw it, his new roads would ensure multiple, direct\nrail and road links between each district of the city and the military units\nresponsible for order there.23 Thus, for example, new boulevards in\nnortheastern Paris allowed troops to rush from the Courbevoie barracks to the\nBastille and then to subdue the turbulent Faubourg Saint-Antoine.24 Many of\nthe new rail lines and stations were located with similar strategic goals in\nmind. Where possible, insurrectionary quartiers were demolished or broken up\nby new roads, public spaces, and commercial development. Explaining the need\nfor a loan of 50 million francs to begin the work, Leon Faucher emphasized\nstate security needs: \"The interests of public order, no less than those of\nsalubrity, demand that a wide swath be cut as soon as possible across this\ndistrict of barricades.\"25\n\nThe reconstruction of Paris was also a necessary public-health mea sure. And\nhere the steps that the hygienists said would make Paris more healthful would\nat the same time make it more efficient economically and more secure\nmilitarily. Antiquated sewers and cesspools, the droppings of an estimated\nthirty-seven thousand horses (in 1850), and the unreliable water supply made\nParis literally pestilential. The city had the highest death rate in France\nand was most susceptible to virulent epidemics of cholera; in 183 1, the\ndisease killed 18,400 people, including the prime minister. And it was in\nthose districts of revolutionary resistance where, because of crowding and\nlack of sanitation, the rates of mortality were highest.26 Haussmann's Paris\nwas, for those who were not expelled, a far healthier city; the greater\ncirculation of air and water and the exposure to sunlight reduced the risk of\nepidemics just as the improved circulation of goods and labor (healthier\nlabor, at that) contributed to the city's economic well-being. A utilitarian\nlogic of labor productivity and commercial success went hand in hand with\nstrategic and public-health concerns.\n\nThe politico-aesthetic tastes of the driving force behind the transformation\nof Paris, Louis Napoleon himself, were also decisive. When Haussmann was\nappointed prefect of the Seine, Louis Napoleon handed him a map that provided\nfor the central market, the Bois de Bologne, and many of the streets\neventually built. There is no doubt that Louis Napoleon's plans drew heavily\nfrom the ideas of the Saint Simonists in their visionary journal Le globe and\nfrom the model urban communities sketched by Fourier and Cabet.27 Their\ngrandiose designs appealed to his own determination to have the new grandeur\nof the capital city serve as testimony to the grandeur of the regime.\n\nAs happens in many authoritarian modernizing schemes, the political tastes of\nthe ruler occasionally trumped purely military and functional concerns.\nRectilinear streets may have admirably assisted the mobilization of troops\nagainst insurgents, but they were also to be flanked by elegant facades and to\nterminate in imposing buildings that would impress visitors.2R Uniform modern\nbuildings along the new boulevards may have represented healthier dwellings,\nbut they were often no more than facades. The zoning regulations were almost\nexclusively concerned with the visible surfaces of buildings, but behind the\nfacades, builders could build crowded, airless tenements, and many of them\ndid.29\n\nThe new Paris, as T. J. Clark has observed, was intensely visualized: \"Part of\nHaussmann's purpose was to give modernity a shape, and he seemed at the time\nto have a measure of success in doing so; he built a set of forms in which the\ncity appeared to be visible, even intelligible: Paris, to repeat the formula,\nwas becoming a spectacle.\"30\n\nLegibility, in this case, was achieved by a much more pronounced segregation\nof the population by class and function. Each fragment of Paris increasingly\ntook on a distinctive character of dress, activity, and wealth-bourgeois\nshopping district, prosperous residential quarter, industrial suburb, artisan\nquarter, bohemian quarter. It was a more easily managed and administered city\nand a more \"readable\" city because of Haussmann's heroic simplifications.\n\nAs in most ambitious schemes of modern order, there was a kind of evil twin to\nHaussmann's spacious and imposing new capital. The hierarchy of urban space in\nwhich the rebuilt center of Paris occupied pride of place presupposed the\ndisplacement of the urban poor toward the periphery.\" Nowhere was this more\ntrue than in Belleville, a popular working-class quarter to the northeast\nwhich grew into a town of sixty thousand people by 1856. Many of its residents\nhad been disinherited by Haussmann's demolitions; some called it a community\nof outcasts. By the 1860s, it had become a suburban equivalent of what the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine had been earlier-an illegible, insurrectionary foyer.\n\"The problem was not that Belleville was not a community, but that it became\nthe sort of community which the bourgeoisie feared, which the police could not\npenetrate, which the government could not regulate, where the popular classes,\nwith all their unruly passions and political resentments, held the upper\nhand.\"32 If, as many claim, the Commune of Paris in 1871 was partly an attempt\nto reconquer the city (\"la reconquete de la Ville par la Ville\")33 by those\nexiled to the periphery by Haussmann, then Belleville was the geographical\nlocus of that sentiment. The Communards, militarily on the defensive in late\nMay 1871, retreated toward the northeast and Belleville, where, at the\nBelleville town hall, they made their last stand. Treated as a den of\nrevolutionaries, Belleville was subjected to a brutal military occupation.\n\nTwo diagnostic ironies marked the suppression of the Commune. The first was\nthat the strategic design of Haussmann was triumphant. The boulevards and rail\nlines that the Second Empire had hoped would foil a popular insurrection had\nproved their value. \"Thanks to Haussmann, the Versailles army could move in\none fell swoop from the Place du Chateau d'eau to Belleville .\"14 The second\nirony was that, just as the Faubourg Saint-Antoine had been effaced by\nHaussmann's demolitions, so too was much of the newly offending quarter\nobliterated by the building of the Eglise Sacre Coeur, built \"in the guilty\ntown ... as restitution made on the site of the crime.\"\"\n\n#### The Creation of Surnames\n\nSome of the categories that we most take for granted and with which we now\nroutinely apprehend the social world had their origin in state projects of\nstandardization and legibility. Consider, for example, something as\nfundamental as permanent surnames.\n\nA vignette from the popular film Witness illustrates how, when among\nstrangers, we do rely on surnames as key navigational aids.36 The detective in\nthe film is attempting to locate a young Amish boy who may have witnessed a\nmurder. Although the detective has a surname to go on, he is thwarted by\nseveral aspects of Amish traditionalism, including the antique German dialect\nspoken by the Amish. His first instinct is, of course, to reach for the\ntelephone book-a list of proper names and addresses-but the Amish don't have\ntelephones. Furthermore, he learns, the Amish have a very small number of last\nnames. His quandary reminds us that the great variety of surnames and given\nnames in the United States allows us to identify unambiguously a large number\nof individuals whom we may never have met. A world without such names is\nbewildering; indeed, the detective finds Amish society so opaque that he needs\na native tracker to find his way.\n\nCustomary naming practices throughout much of the world are enormously rich.\nAmong some peoples, it is not uncommon for individuals to have different names\nduring different stages of life (infancy, childhood, adulthood) and in some\ncases after death; added to these are names used for joking, rituals, and\nmourning and names used for interactions with same-sex friends or with in-\nlaws. Each name is specific to a certain phase of life, social setting, or\ninterlocutor. A single individual will frequently be called by several\ndifferent names, depending on the stage of life and the person addressing him\nor her. To the question \"What is your name?\" which has a more unambiguous\nanswer in the contemporary West, the only plausible answer is \"It depends.\"37\n\nFor the insider who grows up using these naming practices, they are both\nlegible and clarifying. Each name and the contexts of its use convey important\nsocial knowledge. Like the network of alleys in Bruges, the assortment of\nlocal weights and measures, and the intricacies of customary land tenure, the\ncomplexity of naming has some direct and often quite practical relations to\nlocal purposes. For an outsider, however, this byzantine complexity of names\nis a formidable obstacle to understanding local society. Finding someone, let\nalone situating him or her in a kinship network or tracing the inheritance of\nproperty, becomes a major undertaking. If, in addition, the population in\nquestion has reason to conceal its identity and its activities from ex ternal\nauthority, the camouflage value of such naming practices is considerable.\n\nThe invention of permanent, inherited patronyms was, after the administrative\nsimplification of nature (for example, the forest) and space (for example,\nland tenure), the last step in establishing the necessary preconditions of\nmodern statecraft. In almost every case it was a state project, designed to\nallow officials to identify, unambiguously, the majority of its citizens. When\nsuccessful, it went far to create a legible peo- ple.38 Tax and tithe rolls,\nproperty rolls, conscription lists, censuses, and property deeds recognized in\nlaw were inconceivable without some means of fixing an individual's identity\nand linking him or her to a kin group. Campaigns to assign permanent patronyms\nhave typically taken place, as one might expect, in the context of a state's\nexertions to put its fiscal system on a sounder and more lucrative footing.\nFearing, with good reason, that an effort to enumerate and register them could\nbe a prelude to some new tax burden or conscription, local officials and the\npopulation at large often resisted such campaigns.\n\nIf permanent surnames were largely a project of official legibility, then they\nshould have appeared earliest in those societies with precocious states. China\nprovides a striking example.39 By roughly the fourth century B.C. (although\nthe exact timing and comprehensiveness are in dispute), the Qin dynasty had\napparently begun imposing surnames on much of its population and enumerating\nthem for the purposes of taxes, forced labor, and conscription.40 This\ninitiative may well have been the origin of the term \"laobaixing,\" meaning,\nliterally, \"the old one hundred surnames,\" which in modern China has come to\nmean \"the common people.\" Before this, the fabled Chinese patrilineage, while\nestablished among ruling houses and related lines, was absent among commoners.\nThey did not have surnames, nor did they even imitate elite practices in this\nrespect. The assigning of patronyms by family was integral to state policy\npromoting the status of (male) family heads, giving them legal jurisdiction\nover their wives, children, and juniors and, not incidentally, holding them\naccountable for the fiscal obligations of the entire family.41 This (Qin)\npolicy required registering the entire population, after which the \"hodgepodge\nof terms by which people were called were all classified as hsing [surname],\nto be passed down to their patrilineal descendants indefinitely.\"42 On this\naccount, both the establishment of permanent patronyms and the creation of the\npatrilineal family itself can be attributed to early state simplification.\n\nUntil at least the fourteenth century, the great majority of Europeans did not\nhave permanent patronymics.43 An individual's name was typically his given\nname, which might well suffice for local identi fication. If something more\nwere required, a second designation could be added, indicating his occupation\n(in the English case, smith, baker), his geographical location (hill,\nedgewood), his father's given name, or a personal characteristic (short,\nstrong). These secondary designations were not permanent surnames; they did\nnot survive their bearers, unless by chance, say, a baker's son went into the\nsame trade and was called by the same second designation.\n\nWe can learn something about the creation of permanent patronyms in Europe by\nthe documentation left behind from the failed census (catasto) of the\nFlorentine state in 1427.44 The catasto was an audacious attempt to\nrationalize the state's revenues and military strength by specifying its\nsubjects and their wealth, residences, landholdings, and ages.45 Close study\nof these records demonstrates, first, that, as in the Chinese case, state\ninitiative created new surnames rather than simply recording existing\nsurnames. It is thus often impossible to know whether a state-recorded surname\nhas any social existence outside the role of the text in which it is\ninscribed. Second, the variable imposition of permanent surnames within a\nterritory-in this case Tuscanyserves as a rough-and-ready gauge of state\ncapacity.\n\nFamily names in early fifteenth-century Tuscany were confined to a very few\npowerful, property-owning lineages (such as the Strozzi). For such lineages, a\nsurname was a way of achieving social recognition as a \"corporate group,\" and\nkin and affines adopted the name as a way of claiming the backing of an\ninfluential lineage. Beyond this narrow segment of society and a small urban\npatriciate that copied its practices, there were no permanent family names.\n\nHow, in this case, was the catasto office to pinpoint and register an\nindividual, let alone his location, his property, and his age? When making his\ndeclaration, a typical Tuscan provided not only his own given name but those\nof his father and perhaps his grandfather as well, in quasi-biblical fashion\n(Luigi, son of Giovanni, son of Paolo). Given the limited number of baptismal\nnames and the tendency of many families to repeat names in alternate\ngenerations, even this sequence might not suffice for unambiguous\nidentification. The subject might then add his profession, his nickname, or a\npersonal characteristic. There is no evidence that any of these designations\nwas a permanent patronym, although this exercise and others like it might have\neventually served to crystallize surnames, at least for documentary purposes.\nIn the final analysis, the Florentine state was inadequate to the\nadministrative feat intended by the catasto. Popular resistance, the\nnoncompliance of many local elites, and the arduousness and cost of the census\nexercise doomed the project, and officials returned to the earlier fiscal\nsystem.\n\nWhat evidence we have suggests that second names of any kind became rarer as\ndistance from the state's fiscal reach increased. Whereas one-third of the\nhouseholds in Florence declared a second name, the proportion dropped to one-\nfifth for secondary towns and to one-tenth in the countryside. It was not\nuntil the seventeenth century that family names crystallized in the most\nremote and poorest areas of Tuscanythe areas that would have had the least\ncontact with officialdom.\n\nA comparable connection between state building and the invention of permanent\npatronyms exists for fourteenth- and fifteenth-century England. As in Tuscany,\nin England only wealthy aristocratic families tended to have fixed surnames.\nIn the English case such names referred typically to families' places of\norigin in Normandy (for example, Bau- mont, Percy, Disney) or to the places in\nEngland that they held in fief from William the Conqueror (for example, Gerard\nde Sussex). For the rest of the male population, the standard practice of\nlinking only father and son by way of identification prevailed.46 Thus,\nWilliam Robertson's male son might be called Thomas Williamson (son of\nWilliam), while Thomas's son, in turn, might be called Henry Thompson\n(Thomas's son). Note that the grandson's name, by itself, bore no evidence of\nhis grandfather's identity, complicating the tracing of descent through names\nalone. A great many northern European surnames, though now permanent, still\nbear, like a fly caught in amber, particles that echo their antique purpose of\ndesignating who a man's father was ( Fitz-, 0'-, -sen, -son, -s, Mac-,\n-vich).41 At the time of their establishment, last names often had a kind of\nlocal logic to them: John who owned a mill became John Miller; John who made\ncart wheels became John Wheelwright; John who was physically small became John\nShort. As their male descendants, whatever their occupations or stature,\nretained the patronyms, the names later assumed an arbitrary cast.\n\nThe development of the personal surname (literally, a name added to another\nname, and not to be confused with a permanent patronym) went hand in hand with\nthe development of written, official documents such as tithe records, manorial\ndues rolls, marriage registers, censuses, tax records, and land records.48\nThey were necessary to the successful conduct of any administrative exercise\ninvolving large numbers of people who had to be individually identified and\nwho were not known personally by the authorities. Imagine the dilemma of a\ntithe or capitation-tax collector faced with a male population, 90 percent of\nwhom bore just six Christian names (John, William, Thomas, Robert, Richard,\nand Henry). Some second designation was absolutely essential for the records,\nand, if the subject suggested none, it was invented for him by the recording\nclerk. These second designations and the rolls of names that they generated\nwere to the legibility of the population what uniform measurement and the\ncadastral map were to the legibility of real property. While the subject might\nnormally prefer the safety of anonymity, once he was forced to pay the tax, it\nwas then in his interest to be accurately identified in order to avoid paying\nthe same tax twice. Many of these fourteenth-century surnames were clearly\nnothing more than administrative fictions designed to make a population\nfiscally legible. Many of the subjects whose \"surnames\" appear in the\ndocuments were probably unaware of what had been written down, and, for the\ngreat majority, the surnames had no social existence whatever outside the\ndocument.49 Only on very rare occasions does one encounter an entry, such as\n\"William Carter, tailor,\" that implies that we may be dealing with a permanent\npatronym.\n\nThe increasing intensity of interaction with the state and statelike\nstructures (large manors, the church) exactly parallels the development of\npermanent, heritable patronyms. Thus, when Edward I clarified the system of\nlandholding, establishing primogeniture and hereditary copyhold tenure for\nmanorial land, he provided a powerful incentive for the adoption of permanent\npatronyms. Taking one's father's surname became, for the eldest son at least,\npart of a claim to the property on the father's death.50 Now that property\nclaims were subject to state validation, surnames that had once been mere\nbureaucratic fantasies took on a social reality of their own. One imagines\nthat for a long time English subjects had in effect two names-their local name\nand an \"official,\" fixed patronym. As the frequency of interaction with\nimpersonal administrative structures increased, the official name came to\nprevail in all but a man's intimate circle. Those subjects living at a greater\ndistance, both socially and geographically, from the organs of state power, as\ndid the Tuscans, acquired permanent patronyms much later. The upper classes\nand those living in the south of England thus acquired permanent surnames\nbefore the lower classes and those living in the north did. The Scottish and\nWelsh acquired them even later.51\n\nState naming practices, like state mapping practices, were inevitably\nassociated with taxes (labor, military service, grain, revenue,) and hence\naroused popular resistance. The great English peasant rising of 1381 (often\ncalled the Wat Tyler Rebellion) is attributed to an unprecedented decade of\nregistrations and assessments of poll taxes.\" For English as well as for\nTuscan peasants, a census of all adult males could not but appear ominous, if\nnot ruinous.\n\nThe imposition of permanent surnames on colonial populations offers us a\nchance to observe a process, telescoped into a decade or less, that in the\nWest might have taken several generations. Many of the same state objectives\nanimate both the European and the colonial exercises, but in the colonial\ncase, the state is at once more bureaucratized and less tolerant of popular\nresistance. The very brusqueness of colonial naming casts the purposes and\nparadoxes of the process in sharp relief.\n\nNowhere is this better illustrated than in the Philippines under the\nSpanish.S3 Filipinos were instructed by the decree of November 2 1, 1849, to\ntake on permanent Hispanic surnames. The author of the decree was Governor\n(and Lieutenant General) Narciso Claveria y Zal- dua, a meticulous\nadministrator as determined to rationalize names as he had been determined to\nrationalize existing law, provincial boundaries, and the calendar.54 He had\nobserved, as his decree states, that Filipinos generally lacked individual\nsurnames, which might \"distinguish them by families,\" and that their practice\nof adopting baptismal names drawn from a small group of saints' names resulted\nin great \"confusion.\" The remedy was the catalogo, a compendium not only of\npersonal names but also of nouns and adjectives drawn from flora, fauna,\nminerals, geography, and the arts and intended to be used by the authorities\nin assigning permanent, inherited surnames. Each local official was to be\ngiven a supply of surnames sufficient for his jurisdiction, \"taking care that\nthe distribution be made by letters [of the alphabet].\"\" In practice, each\ntown was given a number of pages from the alphabetized catalogo, producing\nwhole towns with surnames beginning with the same letter. In situations where\nthere has been little in-migration in the past 150 years, the traces of this\nadministrative exercise are still perfectly visible across the landscape: \"For\nexample, in the Bikol region, the entire alphabet is laid out like a garland\nover the provinces of Albay, Sorsogon, and Catanduanes which in 1849 belonged\nto the single jurisdiction of Albay. Beginning with A at the provincial\ncapital, the letters B and C mark the towns along the coast beyond Tabaco to\nTiwi. We return and trace along the coast of Sorso- gon the letters E to L;\nthen starting down the Iraya Valley at Daraga with M, we stop with S to\nPolangui and Libon, and finish the alphabet with a quick tour around the\nisland of Catanduanes.\"50\n\nThe confusion for which the decree is the antidote is largely that of the\nadministrator and the tax collector. Universal last names, they believe, will\nfacilitate the administration of justice, finance, and public order as well as\nmake it simpler for prospective marriage partners to calculate their degree of\nconsanguinity.57 For a utilitarian state builder of Claveria's temper,\nhowever, the ultimate goal was a complete and legible list of subjects and\ntaxpayers. This is abundantly clear from the short preamble to the decree: \"In\nview of the extreme usefulness and practicality of this measure, the time has\ncome to issue a directive for the formation of a civil register [formerly a\nclerical function], which may not only fulfill and ensure the said objectives,\nbut may also serve as a basis for the statistics of the country, guarantee the\ncollection of taxes, the regular performance of personal services, and the\nreceipt of payment for exemptions. It likewise provides exact information of\nthe movement of the population, thus avoiding unauthorized migrations, hiding\ntaxpayers, and other abuses..\"\"\n\nDrawing on the accurate lists of citizens throughout the colony, Claveria\nenvisioned each local official constructing a table of eight columns\nspecifying tribute obligations, communal labor obligations, first name,\nsurname, age, marital status, occupation, and exemptions. A ninth column, for\nupdating the register, would record alterations in status and would be\nsubmitted for inspection every month. Because of their accuracy and\nuniformity, these registers would allow the state to compile the precise\nstatistics in Manila that would make for fiscal efficiency. The daunting cost\nof assigning surnames to the entire population and building a complete and\ndiscriminating list of taxpayers was justified by forecasting that the list,\nwhile it might cost as much as twenty thousand pesos to create, would yield\none hundred thousand or two hundred thousand pesos in continuing annual\nrevenue.\n\nWhat if the Filipinos chose to ignore their new last names? This possibility\nhad already crossed Claveria's mind, and he took steps to make sure that the\nnames would stick. Schoolteachers were ordered to forbid their students to\naddress or even know one another by any name except the officially inscribed\nfamily name. Those teachers who did not apply the rule with enthusiasm were to\nbe punished. More efficacious perhaps, given the minuscule school enrollment,\nwas the proviso that forbade priests and military and civil officials from\naccepting any document, application, petition, or deed that did not use the\nofficial surnames. All documents using other names would be null and void.\n\nActual practice, as one might expect, fell considerably short of Claveria's\nadministrative utopia of legible and regimented taxpayers. The continued\nexistence of such non-Spanish surnames as Magsaysay or Macapagal suggests that\npart of the population was never mustered for this exercise. Local officials\nsubmitted incomplete returns or none at all. And there was another serious\nproblem, one that Claveria had foreseen but inadequately provided for. The new\nregisters rarely recorded, as they were supposed to, the previous names used\nby the registrants. This meant that it became exceptionally difficult for\nofficials to trace back property and taxpaying to the period before the\n\ntransformation of names. The state had in effect blinded its own hindsight by\nthe very success of its new scheme.\n\nWith surnames, as with forests, land tenure, and legible cities, actual\npractice never achieved anything like the simplified and uniform perfection to\nwhich its designers had aspired. As late as 1872, an attempt at taking a\ncensus proved a complete fiasco, and it was not tried again until just before\nthe revolution of 1896. Nevertheless, by the twentieth century, the vast\nmajority of Filipinos bore the surnames that Claveria had dreamed up for them.\nThe increasing weight of the state in people's lives and the state's capacity\nto insist on its rules and its terms ensured that.\n\nUniversal last names are a fairly recent historical phenomenon. Tracking\nproperty ownership and inheritance, collecting taxes, maintaining court\nrecords, performing police work, conscripting soldiers, and controlling\nepidemics were all made immeasurably easier by the clarity of full names and,\nincreasingly, fixed addresses. While the utilitarian state was committed to a\ncomplete inventory of its population, liberal ideas of citizenship, which\nimplied voting rights and conscription, also contributed greatly to the\nstandardization of naming practices. The legislative imposition of permanent\nsurnames is particularly clear in the case of Western European Jews who had no\ntradition of last names. A Napoleonic decree \"concernant les Juifs qui n'ont\npas de nom de famille et de prenoms fixes,\" in 1808, mandated last names.\"\nAustrian legislation of 1787, as part of the emancipation process, required\nJews to choose last names or, if they refused, to have fixed last names chosen\nfor them. In Prussia the emancipation of the Jews was contingent upon the\nadoption of surnames.60 Many of the immigrants to the United States, Jews and\nnon-Jews alike, had no permanent surnames when they set sail. Very few,\nhowever, made it through the initial paperwork without an official last name\nthat their descendants carry still.\n\nThe process of creating fixed last names continues in much of the Third World\nand on the \"tribal frontiers\" of more developed countries .61 Today, of\ncourse, there are now many other state-impelled standard designations that\nhave vastly improved the capacity of the state to identify an individual. The\ncreation of birth and death certificates, more specific addresses (that is,\nmore specific than something like \"John-on-the-hill\"), identity cards,\npassports, social security numbers, photographs, fingerprints, and, most\nrecently, DNA profiles have superseded the rather crude instrument of the\npermanent surname. But the surname was a first and crucial step toward making\nindividual citizens officially legible, and along with the photograph, it is\nstill the first fact on documents of identity.\n\n#### The Directive for a Standard, Official Language\n\nThe great cultural barrier imposed by a separate language is perhaps the most\neffective guarantee that a social world, easily accessible to insiders, will\nremain opaque to outsiders.62 Just as the stranger or state official might\nneed a local guide to find his way around sixteenthcentury Bruges, he would\nneed a local interpreter in order to understand and be understood in an\nunfamiliar linguistic environment. A distinct language, however, is a far more\npowerful basis for autonomy than a complex residential pattern. It is also the\nbearer of a distinctive history, a cultural sensibility, a literature, a\nmythology, a musical past.63 In this respect, a unique language represents a\nformidable obstacle to state knowledge, let alone colonization, control,\nmanipulation, instruction, or propaganda.\n\nOf all state simplifications, then, the imposition of a single, official\nlanguage may be the most powerful, and it is the precondition of many other\nsimplifications. This process should probably be viewed, as Eugen Weber\nsuggests in the case of France, as one of domestic colonization in which\nvarious foreign provinces (such as Brittany and Oc- citanie) are\nlinguistically subdued and culturally incorporated.64 In the first efforts\nmade to insist on the use of French, it is clear that the state's objective\nwas the legibility of local practice. Officials insisted that every legal\ndocument-whether a will, document of sale, loan instrument, contract, annuity,\nor property deed-be drawn up in French. As long as these documents remained in\nlocal vernaculars, they were daunting to an official sent from Paris and\nvirtually impossible to bring into conformity with central schemes of legal\nand administrative standardization. The campaign of linguistic centralization\nwas assured of some success since it went hand in hand with an expansion of\nstate power. By the late nineteenth century, dealing with the state was\nunavoidable for all but a small minority of the population. Petitions, court\ncases, school documents, applications, and correspondence with officials were\nall of necessity written in French. One can hardly imagine a more effective\nformula for immediately devaluing local knowledge and privileging all those\nwho had mastered the official linguistic code. It was a gigantic shift in\npower. Those at the periphery who lacked competence in French were rendered\nmute and marginal. They were now in need of a local guide to the new state\nculture, which appeared in the form of lawyers, notaires, schoolteachers,\nclerks, and soldiers.61\n\nA cultural project, as one might suspect, lurked behind the linguistic\ncentralization. French was seen as the bearer of a national civiliza tion; the\npurpose of imposing it was not merely to have provincials digest the Code\nNapoleon but also to bring them Voltaire, Racine, Parisian newspapers, and a\nnational education. As Weber provocatively puts it, \"There can be no clearer\nexpression of imperialist sentiment, a white man's burden of Francophony,\nwhose first conquests were to be right at home.\"66 Where the command of Latin\nhad once defined participation in a wider culture for a small elite, the\ncommand of standard French now defined full participation in French culture.\nThe implicit logic of the move was to define a hierarchy of cultures,\nrelegating local languages and their regional cultures to, at best, a quaint\nprovincialism. At the apex of this implicit pyramid was Paris and its\ninstitutions: ministries, schools, academies (including the guardian of the\nlanguage, 1'Academie Francaise). The relative success of this cultural project\nhinged on both coercion and inducements. \"It was centralization,\" says\nAlexandre Sanguinetti, \"which permitted the making of France despite the\nFrench, or in the midst of their indifference.... France is a deliberate\npolitical construction for whose creation the central power has never ceased\nto fight.\"67 Standard (Parisian) French and Paris were not only focal points\nof power; they were also magnets. The growth of markets, physical mobility,\nnew careers, political patronage, public service, and a national educational\nsystem all meant that facility in French and connections to Paris were the\npaths of social advancement and material success. It was a state\nsimplification that promised to reward those who complied with its logic and\nto penalize those who ignored it.\n\n#### The Centralization of Traffic Patterns\n\nThe linguistic centralization impelled by the imposition of Parisian French as\nthe official standard was replicated in a centralization of traffic. Just as\nthe new dispensation in language made Paris the hub of communication, so the\nnew road and rail systems increasingly favored movement to and from Paris over\ninterregional or local traffic. State policy resembled, in computer parlance,\na \"hardwiring\" pattern that made the provinces far more accessible, far more\nlegible, to central authorities than even the absolutist kings had imagined.\n\nLet us contrast, in an overly schematic way, a relatively uncentralized\nnetwork of communication, on one hand, with a relatively centralized network,\non the other. If mapped, the uncentralized pattern would be the physical image\nof the actual movements of goods and people along routes not created by\nadministrative fiat. Such movements would not be random; they would reflect\nboth the ease of travel along valleys, by watercourses, and around defiles and\nalso the location of important resources and ritual sites. Weber captures the\nwealth of human activities that animate these movements across the landscape:\n\"They served professional pursuits, like the special trails followed by\nglassmakers, carriers or sellers of salt, potters, or those that led to\nforges, mines, quarries, and hemp fields, or those along which flax, hemp,\nlinen, and yarn were taken to market. There were pilgrimage routes and\nprocession trails .\"61\n\nIf we can imagine, for the sake of argument, a place where physical resources\nare evenly distributed and there are no great physical barriers to movement\n(such as mountains or swamps), then a map of paths in use might form a network\nresembling a dense concentration of capillaries (figure 11). The tracings\nwould, of course, never be entirely random. Market towns based on location and\nresources would constitute small hubs, as would religious shrines, quarries,\nmines, and other important sites.69 In the French case as well, the network of\nroads would have long reflected the centralizing ambitions of local lords and\nthe nation's monarchs. The point of this illustrative idealization, however,\nis to depict a landscape of communication routes that is only lightly marked\nby state centralization. It would resemble in many ways the cityscape of late\nfourteenth-century Bruges, shown earlier.\n\n![](img0017.jpg)\n\n11\\. Paths created by use and topography\n\nBeginning with Colbert, the state-building modernizers of France were bent on\nsuperimposing on this pattern a carefully planned grid of administrative\ncentralization.70 Their scheme, never entirely realized, was to align\nhighways, canals, and ultimately rail lines to radiate out from Paris like the\nspokes of a wheel (figure 12). The similarity between this grid and the tire-\naire of the well-managed state forest as conceived by Colbert was not\naccidental. They were both devised to maximize access and to facilitate\ncentral control. And the kind of simplification involved was, again, entirely\nrelative to location. For an official at the hub, it was now much easier to go\nto A or to B along the new routes. The layout was designed \"to serve the\ngovernment and the cities and lacking a network of supporting thoroughfares\nhad little to do with popular habit or need. Administrative highways, a\nhistorian of the center called them, [were] made for troops to march on and\nfor tax revenues to reach the treasury.\"71 For anyone wanting to travel or\nmove goods between A and B, however, things were not so simple. Just as all\ndocuments had to \"pass through\" the official legal language, so too did much\nof the commercial traffic have to pass through the capital.\n\nThe driving intellectual force behind this esprit geometrique was, and has\nremained, the renowned engineers of the Corps des Ponts et Chaussees.71 Victor\nLegrand, the director of Ponts et des Chaussees, was the originator of the\nbelle idee of seven grand lines of junction linking Paris to points from the\nAtlantic to the Mediterranean. His plan became known as the Legrand Star and\nwas proposed first for canals and then, with greater effect, for railroads\n(among them the Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est).73\n\n![](img0018.jpg)\n\n12\\. Centralized traffic hub\n\nAs a centralizing aesthetic, the plan defied the canons of commercial logic or\ncost-effectiveness. The first phase of the grid, the line from Paris east to\nStrasbourg and the frontier, ran straight through the plateau of Brie rather\nthan following the centers of population along the Marne. By refusing to\nconform to the topography in its quest of geometric perfection, the railway\nline was ruinously expensive compared to English or German railroads. The army\nhad also adopted the Ponts et Chaussees logic, believing that direct rail\nlines to the borders would be militarily advantageous. They were proven\ntragically wrong in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71.74\n\nThis retrofitting of traffic patterns had enormous consequences, most of which\nwere intended: linking provincial France and provincial French citizens to\nParis and to the state and facilitating the deployment of troops from the\ncapital to put down civil unrest in any department in the nation. It was aimed\nat achieving, for the military control of the nation, what Haussmann had\nachieved in the capital itself. It thus empowered Paris and the state at the\nexpense of the provinces, greatly affected the economics of location,\nexpedited central fiscal and military control, and severed or weakened lateral\ncultural and economic ties by favoring hierarchical links. At a stroke, it\nmarginalized outlying areas in the way that official French had marginalized\nlocal dialects.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nOfficials of the modern state are, of necessity, at least one step-and often\nseveral steps-removed from the society they are charged with governing. They\nassess the life of their society by a series of typifications that are always\nsome distance from the full reality these abstractions are meant to capture.\nThus the foresters' charts and tables, despite their synoptic power to distill\nmany individual facts into a larger pattern, do not quite capture (nor are\nthey meant to) the real forest in its full diversity. Thus the cadastral\nsurvey and the title deed are a rough, often misleading representation of\nactual, existing rights to land use and disposal. The functionary of any large\norganization \"sees\" the human activity that is of interest to him largely\nthrough the simplified approximations of documents and statistics: tax\nproceeds, lists of taxpayers, land records, average incomes, unemployment\nnumbers, mortality rates, trade and productivity figures, the total number of\ncases of cholera in a certain district.\n\nThese typifications are indispensable to statecraft. State simplifications\nsuch as maps, censuses, cadastral lists, and standard units of measurement\nrepresent techniques for grasping a large and complex reality; in order for\nofficials to be able to comprehend aspects of the ensemble, that complex\nreality must be reduced to schematic categories. The only way to accomplish\nthis is to reduce an infinite array of detail to a set of categories that will\nfacilitate summary descriptions, comparisons, and aggregation. The invention,\nelaboration, and deployment of these abstractions represent, as Charles Tilly\nhas shown, an enormous leap in state capacity-a move from tribute and indirect\nrule to taxation and direct rule. Indirect rule required only a minimal state\napparatus but rested on local elites and communities who had an interest in\nwithholding resources and knowledge from the center. Direct rule sparked\nwidespread resistance and necessitated negotiations that often limited the\ncenter's power, but for the first time, it allowed state officials direct\nknowledge of and access to a previously opaque society.\n\nSuch is the power of the most advanced techniques of direct rule, that it\ndiscovers new social truths as well as merely summarizing known facts. The\nCenter for Disease Control in Atlanta is a striking case in point. Its network\nof sample hospitals allowed it to first \"discover\"-in the epidemiological\nsense-such hitherto unknown diseases as toxic shock syndrome, Legionnaires'\ndisease, and AIDS. Stylized facts of this kind are a powerful form of state\nknowledge, making it possible for officials to intervene early in epidemics,\nto understand economic trends that greatly affect public welfare, to gauge\nwhether their policies are having the desired effect, and to make policy with\nmany of the crucial facts at hand.75 These facts permit discriminating\ninterventions, some of which are literally lifesaving.\n\nThe techniques devised to enhance the legibility of a society to its rulers\nhave become vastly more sophisticated, but the political motives driving them\nhave changed little. Appropriation, control, and manipulation (in the\nnonpejorative sense) remain the most prominent. If we imagine a state that has\nno reliable means of enumerating and locating its population, gauging its\nwealth, and mapping its land, resources, and settlements, we are imagining a\nstate whose interventions in that society are necessarily crude. A society\nthat is relatively opaque to the state is thereby insulated from some forms of\nfinely tuned state interventions, both welcomed (universal vaccinations) and\nresented (per sonal income taxes). The interventions it does experience will\ntypically be mediated by local trackers who know the society from inside and\nwho are likely to interpose their own particular interests. Without this\nmediation-and often with it-state action is likely to be inept, greatly\novershooting or undershooting its objective.\n\nAn illegible society, then, is a hindrance to any effective intervention by\nthe state, whether the purpose of that intervention is plunder or public\nwelfare. As long as the state's interest is largely confined to grabbing a few\ntons of grain and rounding up a few conscripts, the state's ignorance may not\nbe fatal. When, however, the state's objective requires changing the daily\nhabits (hygiene or health practices) or work performance (quality labor or\nmachine maintenance) of its citizens, such ignorance can well be disabling. A\nthoroughly legible society eliminates local monopolies of information and\ncreates a kind of national transparency through the uniformity of codes,\nidentities, statistics, regulations, and measures. At the same time it is\nlikely to create new positional advantages for those at the apex who have the\nknowledge and access to easily decipher the new state-created format.\n\nThe discriminating interventions that a legible society makes possible can, of\ncourse, be deadly as well. A sobering instance is wordlessly recalled by a map\nproduced by the City Office of Statistics of Amsterdam, then under Nazi\noccupation, in May 1941 (figure 13).76 Along with lists of residents, the map\nwas the synoptic representation that guided the rounding up of the city's\nJewish population, sixty-five thousand of whom were eventually deported.\n\nThe map is titled \"The Distribution of Jews in the Municipality.\" Each dot\nrepresents ten Jews, a scheme that makes the heavily Jewish districts readily\napparent. The map was compiled from information obtained not only through the\norder for people of Jewish extraction to register themselves but also through\nthe population registry (\"exceptionally comprehensive in the Netherlands\")\"\nand the business registry. If one reflects briefly on the kind of detailed\ninformation on names, addresses, and ethnic backgrounds (determined perhaps by\nnames in the population registry or by declaration) and the cartographic\nexactitude required to produce this statistical representation, the\ncontribution of legibility to state capacity is evident. The Nazi authorities,\nof course, supplied the murderous purpose behind the exercise, but the\nlegibility provided by the Dutch authorities supplied the means to its\nefficient implementation.78 That legibility, I should emphasize, merely\namplifies the capacity of the state for discriminating interventions-a\ncapacity that in principle could as easily have been deployed to feed the Jews\nas to deport them.\n\n![](img0019.jpg)\n\n13\\. Map produced by the City Office of Statistics of Amsterdam and entitled\n\"The Distribution of Jews in the Municipality (May 1941)\"\n\nLegibility implies a viewer whose place is central and whose vision is\nsynoptic. State simplifications of the kind we have examined are designed to\nprovide authorities with a schematic view of their society, a view not\nafforded to those without authority. Rather like U.S. highway patrolmen\nwearing mirrored sunglasses, the authorities enjoy a quasimonopolistic picture\nof selected aspects of the whole society. This privileged vantage point is\ntypical of all institutional settings where command and control of complex\nhuman activities is paramount. The monastery, the barracks, the factory floor,\nand the administrative bureaucracy (private or public) exercise many statelike\nfunctions and often mimic its information structure as well.\n\nState simplifications can be considered part of an ongoing \"project of\nlegibility,\" a project that is never fully realized. The data from which such\nsimplifications arise are, to varying degrees, riddled with inaccuracies,\nomissions, faulty aggregations, fraud, negligence, political distortion, and\nso on. A project of legibility is immanent in any statecraft that aims at\nmanipulating society, but it is undermined by intrastate rivalries, technical\nobstacles, and, above all, the resistance of its subjects.\n\nState simplifications have at least five characteristics that deserve\nemphasis. Most obviously, state simplifications are observations of only those\naspects of social life that are of official interest. They are interested,\nutilitarian facts. Second, they are also nearly always written (verbal or\nnumerical) documentary facts. Third, they are typically static facts.79\nFourth, most stylized state facts are also aggregate facts. Aggregate facts\nmay be impersonal (the density of transportation networks) or simply a\ncollection of facts about individuals (employment rates, literacy rates,\nresidence patterns). Finally, for most purposes, state officials need to group\ncitizens in ways that permit them to make a collective assessment. Facts that\ncan be aggregated and presented as averages or distributions must therefore be\nstandardized facts. However unique the actual circumstances of the various\nindividuals who make up the aggregate, it is their sameness or, more\nprecisely, their differences along a standardized scale or continuum that are\nof interest.\n\nThe process by which standardized facts susceptible to aggregation are\nmanufactured seems to require at least three steps. The first, indispensable\nstep is the creation of common units of measurement or coding. Size classes of\ntrees, freehold tenure, the metric system for measuring landed property or the\nvolume of grain, uniform naming practices, sections of prairie land, and urban\nlots of standard sizes are among the units created for this purpose. In the\nnext step, each item or instance falling within a category is counted and\nclassified according to the new unit of assessment. A particular tree\nreappears as an instance of a certain size class of tree; a particular plot of\nagricultural land reappears as coordinates in a cadastral map; a particular\njob reappears as an instance of a category of employment; a particular person\nreappears bearing a name according to the new formula. Each fact must be\nrecuperated and brought back on stage, as it were, dressed in a new uniform of\nofficial weave-as part of \"a series in a total classificatory grid.\"80 Only in\nsuch garb can these facts play a role in the culmination of the process: the\ncreation of wholly new facts by aggregation, following the logic of the new\nunits. One arrives, finally, at synoptic facts that are useful to officials:\nso many thousands of trees in a given size class, so many thousands of men\nbetween the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, so many farms in a given size\nclass, so many students whose surnames begin with the letter A, so many people\nwith tuberculosis. Combining several metrics of aggregation, one arrives at\nquite subtle, complex, heretofore unknown truths, including, for example, the\ndistribution of tubercular patients by income and urban location.\n\nTo call such elaborate artifacts of knowledge \"state simplifications\" risks\nbeing misleading. They are anything but simple-minded, and they are often\nwielded with great sophistication by officials. Rather, the term\n\"simplification\" is meant in two quite specific senses. First, the knowledge\nthat an official needs must give him or her a synoptic view of the ensemble;\nit must be cast in terms that are replicable across many cases. In this\nrespect, such facts must lose their particularity and reappear in schematic or\nsimplified form as a member of a class of facts.81 Second, in a meaning\nclosely related to the first, the grouping of synoptic facts necessarily\nentails collapsing or ignoring distinctions that might otherwise be relevant.\n\nTake, for example, simplifications about employment. The working lives of many\npeople are exceptionally complex and may change from day to day. For the\npurposes of official statistics, however, being \"gainfully employed\" is a\nstylized fact; one is or is not gainfully employed. Also, available\ncharacterizations of many rather exotic working lives are sharply restricted\nby the categories used in the aggregate statis- tics.82 Those who gather and\ninterpret such aggregate data understand that there is a certain fictional and\narbitrary quality to their categories and that they hide a wealth of\nproblematic variation. Once set, however, these thin categories operate\nunavoidably as if all similarly classified cases were in fact homogeneous and\nuniform. All Normalbaume in a given size range are the same; all soil in a\ndefined soil class is statistically identical; all autoworkers (if we are\nclassifying by industry) are alike; all Catholics (if we are classifying by\nreligious faith) are alike. There is, as Theodore Porter notes in his study of\nmechanical objectivity, a \"strong incentive to prefer precise and\nstandardizable measures to highly accurate ones,\" since accuracy is\nmeaningless if the identical procedure cannot reliably be performed\nelsewhere.83\n\nTo this point, I have been making a rather straightforward, even banal point\nabout the simplification, abstraction, and standardization that are necessary\nfor state officials' observations of the circumstances of some or all of the\npopulation. But I want to make a further claim, one analogous to that made for\nscientific forestry: the modern state, through its officials, attempts with\nvarying success to create a terrain and a population with precisely those\nstandardized characteristics that will be easiest to monitor, count, assess,\nand manage. The utopian, immanent, and continually frustrated goal of the\nmodern state is to reduce the chaotic, disorderly, constantly changing social\nreality beneath it to something more closely resembling the administrative\ngrid of its observations. Much of the statecraft of the late eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries was devoted to this project. \"In the period of movement\nfrom tribute to tax, from indirect rule to direct rule, from subordination to\nassimilation,\" Tilly remarks, \"states generally worked to homogenize their\npopulations and break down their segmentation by imposing common languages,\nreligions, currencies, and legal systems, as well as promoting the\nconstruction of connected systems of trade, transportation, and\ncommunication.\"84\n\nAs the scientific forester may dream of a perfectly legible forest planted\nwith same-aged, single-species, uniform trees growing in straight lines in a\nrectangular flat space cleared of all underbrush and poachers,RS so the\nexacting state official may aspire to a perfectly legible population with\nregistered, unique names and addresses keyed to grid settlements; who pursue\nsingle, identifiable occupations; and all of whose transactions are documented\naccording to the designated formula and in the official language. This\ncaricature of society as a military parade ground is overdrawn, but the grain\nof truth that it embodies may help us understand the grandiose plans we will\nexamine later.86 The aspiration to such uniformity and order alerts us to the\nfact that modern statecraft is largely a project of internal colonization,\noften glossed, as it is in imperial rhetoric, as a \"civilizing mission.\" The\nbuilders of the modern nation-state do not merely describe, observe, and map;\nthey strive to shape a people and landscape that will fit their techniques of\nobservation.R7\n\nThis tendency is perhaps one shared by many large hierarchical organizations.\nAs Donald Chisholm, in reviewing the literature on administrative\ncoordination, concludes, \"central coordinating schemes do work effectively\nunder conditions where the task environment is known and unchanging, where it\ncan be treated as a closed system.\"\" The more static, standardized, and\nuniform a population or social space is, the more legible it is, and the more\namenable it is to the techniques of state officials. I am suggesting that many\nstate activities aim at transforming the population, space, and nature under\ntheir jurisdiction into the closed systems that offer no surprises and that\ncan best be observed and controlled.\n\nState officials can often make their categories stick and impose their\nsimplifications, because the state, of all institutions, is best equipped to\ninsist on treating people according to its schemata. Thus categories that may\nhave begun as the artificial inventions of cadastral surveyors, census takers,\njudges, or police officers can end by becoming categories that organize\npeople's daily experience precisely because they are embedded in state-created\ninstitutions that structure that exper- ience.89 The economic plan, survey\nmap, record of ownership, forest management plan, classification of ethnicity,\npassbook, arrest record, and map of political boundaries acquire their force\nfrom the fact that these synoptic data are the points of departure for reality\nas state officials apprehend and shape it. In dictatorial settings where there\nis no effective way to assert another reality, fictitious facts-on-paper can\noften be made eventually to prevail on the ground, because it is on behalf of\nsuch pieces of paper that police and army are deployed.\n\nThese paper records are the operative facts in a court of law, in an\nadministrative dossier, and before most functionaries. In this sense, there\nare virtually no other facts for the state than those that are contained in\ndocuments standardized for that purpose. An error in such a document can have\nfar more power-and for far longer-than can an unreported truth. If, for\nexample, you want to defend your claim to real property, you are normally\nobliged to defend it with a document called a property deed, and to do so in\nthe courts and tribunals created for that purpose. If you wish to have any\nstanding in law, you must have a document that officials accept as evidence of\ncitizenship, be that document a birth certificate, passport, or identity card.\nThe categories used by state agents are not merely means to make their\nenvironment legible; they are an authoritative tune to which most of the\npopulation must dance.\n\n\n# Part 2\n\n## Transforming Visions\n\n\n# 3 Authoritarian High Modernism\n\n![](img0020.jpg)\n\nThen, as this morning on the dock, again I saw, as if for the first time in my\nlife, the impeccably straight streets, the glistening glass of the pavement,\nthe divine parallelepipeds of the transparent dwellings, the square harmony of\nthe grayish blue rows of Numbers. And it seemed to me that not past\ngenerations, but I myself, had won a victory over the old god and the old\nlife.\n\n-Eugene Zamiatin, We\n\nModern science, which displaced and replaced God, removed that obstacle\n[limits on freedom]. It also created a vacancy: the office of the supreme\nlegislatorcum-manager, of the designer and administrator of the world order,\nwas now horrifyingly empty. It had to be filled or else.... The emptiness of\nthe throne was throughout the modern era a standing and tempting invitation to\nvisionaries and adventurers. The dream of an all-embracing order and harmony\nremained as vivid as ever, and it seemed now closer than ever, more than ever\nwithin human reach. It was now up to mortal earthlings to bring it about and\nto secure its ascendancy.\n\n-Zygmunt Bauman, Modernity and the Holocaust\n\nAll the state simplifications that we have examined have the character of\nmaps. That is, they are designed to summarize precisely those aspects of a\ncomplex world that are of immediate interest to the mapmaker and to ignore the\nrest. To complain that a map lacks nuance and detail makes no sense unless it\nomits information necessary to its function. A city map that aspired to\nrepresent every traffic light, every pothole, every building, and every bush\nand tree in every park would threaten to become as large and as complex as the\ncity that it depicted.' And it certainly would defeat the purpose of mapping,\nwhich is to abstract and summarize. A map is an instrument designed for a\npurpose. We may judge that purpose noble or morally offensive, but the map\nitself either serves or fails to serve its intended use.\n\nIn case after case, however, we have remarked on the apparent power of maps to\ntransform as well as merely to summarize the facts that they portray. This\ntransformative power resides not in the map, of course, but rather in the\npower possessed by those who deploy the perspective of that particular map.' A\nprivate corporation aiming to maximize sustainable timber yields, profit, or\nproduction will map its world according to this logic and will use what power\nit has to ensure that the logic of its map prevails. The state has no monopoly\non utilitarian simplifications. What the state does at least aspire to,\nthough, is a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. That is surely why, from\nthe seventeenth century until now, the most transformative maps have been\nthose invented and applied by the most powerful institution in society: the\nstate.\n\nUntil recently, the ability of the state to impose its schemes on society was\nlimited by the state's modest ambitions and its limited capacity. Although\nutopian aspirations to a finely tuned social control can be traced back to\nEnlightenment thought and to monastic and military practices, the eighteenth-\ncentury European state was still largely a machine for extraction. It is true\nthat state officials, particularly under absolutism, had mapped much more of\ntheir kingdoms' populations, land tenures, production, and trade than their\npredecessors had and that they had become increasingly efficient in pumping\nrevenue, grain, and conscripts from the countryside. But there was more than a\nlittle irony in their claim to absolute rule. They lacked the consistent\ncoercive power, the fine-grained administrative grid, or the detailed\nknowledge that would have permitted them to undertake more intrusive\nexperiments in social engineering. To give their growing ambitions full rein,\nthey required a far greater hubris, a state machinery that was equal to the\ntask, and a society they could master. By the mid-nineteenth century in the\nWest and by the early twentieth century elsewhere, these conditions were being\nmet.\n\nI believe that many of the most tragic episodes of state development in the\nlate nineteenth and twentieth centuries originate in a particularly pernicious\ncombination of three elements. The first is the aspiration to the\nadministrative ordering of nature and society, an aspiration that we have\nalready seen at work in scientific forestry, but one raised to a far more\ncomprehensive and ambitious level. \"High modernism\" seems an appropriate term\nfor this aspiration.' As a faith, it was shared by many across a wide spectrum\nof political ideologies. Its main carriers and exponents were the avant-garde\namong engineers, planners, technocrats, high-level administrators, architects,\nscientists, and visionaries. If one were to imagine a pantheon or Hall of Fame\nof highmodernist figures, it would almost certainly include such names as\nHenri Comte de Saint-Simon, Le Corbusier, Walther Rathenau, Robert McNamara,\nRobert Moses, Jean Monnet, the Shah of Iran, David Lilienthal, Vladimir I.\nLenin, Leon Trotsky, and Julius Nyerere.4 They envisioned a sweeping, rational\nengineering of all aspects of social life in order to improve the human\ncondition. As a conviction, high modernism was not the exclusive property of\nany political tendency; it had both right- and left-wing variants, as we shall\nsee. The second element is the unrestrained use of the power of the modern\nstate as an instru ment for achieving these designs. The third element is a\nweakened or prostrate civil society that lacks the capacity to resist these\nplans. The ideology of high modernism provides, as it were, the desire; the\nmodern state provides the means of acting on that desire; and the\nincapacitated civil society provides the leveled terrain on which to build\n(dis)utopias.\n\nWe shall return shortly to the premises of high modernism. But here it is\nimportant to note that many of the great state-sponsored calamities of the\ntwentieth century have been the work of rulers with grandiose and utopian\nplans for their society. One can identify a highmodernist utopianism of the\nright, of which Nazism is surely the diagnostic example.' The massive social\nengineering under apartheid in South Africa, the modernization plans of the\nShah of Iran, villagization in Vietnam, and huge late-colonial development\nschemes (for example, the Gezira scheme in the Sudan) could be considered\nunder this rubric.' And yet there is no denying that much of the massive,\nstateenforced social engineering of the twentieth century has been the work of\nprogressive, often revolutionary elites. Why?\n\nThe answer, I believe, lies in the fact that it is typically progressives who\nhave come to power with a comprehensive critique of existing society and a\npopular mandate (at least initially) to transform it. These progressives have\nwanted to use that power to bring about enormous changes in people's habits,\nwork, living patterns, moral conduct, and worldview.' They have deployed what\nVaclav Havel has called \"the armory of holistic social engineering.\"' Utopian\naspirations per se are not dangerous. As Oscar Wilde remarked, \"A map of the\nworld which does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it\nleaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing.\"° Where the\nutopian vision goes wrong is when it is held by ruling elites with no\ncommitment to democracy or civil rights and who are therefore likely to use\nunbridled state power for its achievement. Where it goes brutally wrong is\nwhen the society subjected to such utopian experiments lacks the capacity to\nmount a determined resistance.\n\nWhat is high modernism, then? It is best conceived as a strong (one might even\nsay muscle-bound) version of the beliefs in scientific and technical progress\nthat were associated with industrialization in Western Europe and in North\nAmerica from roughly 1830 until World War I. At its center was a supreme self-\nconfidence about continued linear progress, the development of scientific and\ntechnical knowledge, the expansion of production, the rational design of\nsocial order, the growing satisfaction of human needs, and, not least, an\nincreasing control over nature (including human nature) commensurate with\nscientific understanding of natural laws. 10 High modernism is thus a\nparticularly sweeping vision of how the benefits of technical and scientific\nprogress might be applied-usually through the state-in every field of human\nactivity.\" If, as we have seen, the simplified, utilitarian descriptions of\nstate officials had a tendency, through the exercise of state power, to bring\nthe facts into line with their representations, then one might say that the\nhigh-modern state began with extensive prescriptions for a new society, and it\nintended to impose them.\n\nIt would have been hard not to have been a modernist of some stripe at the end\nof the nineteenth century in the West. How could one fail to be impressed-even\nawed-by the vast transformation wrought by science and industry?\" Anyone who\nwas, say, sixty years old in Manchester, England, would have witnessed in his\nor her lifetime a revolution in the manufacturing of cotton and wool textiles,\nthe growth of the factory system, the application of steam power and other\nastounding new mechanical devices to production, remarkable breakthroughs in\nmetallurgy and transportation (especially railroads), and the appearance of\ncheap mass-produced commodities. Given the stunning advances in chemistry,\nphysics, medicine, math, and engineering, anyone even slightly attentive to\nthe world of science would have almost come to expect a continuing stream of\nnew marvels (such as the internal combustion engine and electricity). The\nunprecedented transformations of the nineteenth century may have impoverished\nand marginalized many, but even the victims recognized that something\nrevolutionary was afoot. All this sounds rather naive today, when we are far\nmore sober about the limits and costs of technological progress and have\nacquired a postmodern skepticism about any totalizing discourse. Still, this\nnew sensibility ignores both the degree to which modernist assumptions prevail\nin our lives and, especially, the great enthusiasm and revolutionary hubris\nthat were part and parcel of high modernism.\n\n#### The Discovery of Society\n\nThe path from description to prescription was not so much an inadvertent\nresult of a deep psychological tendency as a deliberate move. The point of the\nEnlightenment view of legal codes was less to mirror the distinctive customs\nand practices of a people than to create a cultural community by codifying and\ngeneralizing the most rational of those customs and suppressing the more\nobscure and barbaric ones.13 Establishing uniform standards of weight and\nmeasurement across a kingdom had a greater purpose than just making trade\neasier; the new standards were intended both to express and to promote a new\ncultural unity. Well before the tools existed to make good on this cultural\nrevolution, Enlightenment thinkers such as Condorcet were looking ahead to the\nday when the tools would be in place. He wrote in 1782: \"Those sciences,\ncreated almost in our own days, the object of which is man himself, the direct\ngoal of which is the happiness of man, will enjoy a progress no less sure than\nthat of the physical sciences, and this idea so sweet, that our descendants\nwill surpass us in wisdom as in enlightenment, is no longer an illusion. In\nmeditating on the nature of the moral sciences, one cannot help seeing that,\nas they are based like physical sciences on the observation of fact, they must\nfollow the same method, acquire a language equally exact and precise,\nattaining the same degree of certainty.\"\" The gleam in Condorcet's eye became,\nby the mid-nineteenth century, an active utopian project. Simplification and\nrationalization previously applied to forests, weights and measures, taxation,\nand factories were now applied to the design of society as a whole\"\nIndustrial-strength social engineering was born. While factories and forests\nmight be planned by private entrepreneurs, the ambition of engineering whole\nsocieties was almost exclusively a project of the nation-state.\n\nThis new conception of the state's role represented a fundamental\ntransformation. Before then, the state's activities had been largely confined\nto those that contributed to the wealth and power of the sovereign, as the\nexample of scientific forestry and cameral science illustrated. The idea that\none of the central purposes of the state was the improvement of all the\nmembers of society-their health, skills and education, longevity,\nproductivity, morals, and family life-was quite novel. 16 There was, of\ncourse, a direct connection between the old conception of the state and this\nnew one. A state that improved its population's skills, vigor, civic morals,\nand work habits would increase its tax base and field better armies; it was a\npolicy that any enlightened sovereign might pursue. And yet, in the nineteenth\ncentury, the welfare of the population came increasingly to be seen, not\nmerely as a means to national strength, but as an end in itself.\n\nOne essential precondition of this transformation was the discovery of society\nas a reified object that was separate from the state and that could be\nscientifically described. In this respect, the production of statistical\nknowledge about the population-its age profiles, occupations, fertility,\nliteracy, property ownership, law-abidingness (as demonstrated by crime\nstatistics) -allowed state officials to characterize the population in\nelaborate new ways, much as scientific forestry permitted the forester to\ncarefully describe the forest. Ian Hack ing explains how a suicide or homicide\nrate, for example, came to be seen as a characteristic of a people, so that\none could speak of a \"budget\" of homicides that would be \"spent\" each year,\nlike routine debits from an account, although the particular murderers and\ntheir victims were unknown.\" Statistical facts were elaborated into social\nlaws. It was but a small step from a simplified description of society to a\ndesign and manipulation of society, with its improvement in mind. If one could\nreshape nature to design a more suitable forest, why not reshape society to\ncreate a more suitable population?\n\nThe scope of intervention was potentially endless. Society became an object\nthat the state might manage and transform with a view toward perfecting it. A\nprogressive nation-state would set about engineering its society according to\nthe most advanced technical standards of the new moral sciences. The existing\nsocial order, which had been more or less taken by earlier states as a given,\nreproducing itself under the watchful eye of the state, was for the first time\nthe subject of active management. It was possible to conceive of an\nartificial, engineered society designed, not by custom and historical\naccident, but according to conscious, rational, scientific criteria. Every\nnook and cranny of the social order might be improved upon: personal hygiene,\ndiet, child rearing, housing, posture, recreation, family structure, and, most\ninfamously, the genetic inheritance of the population.\" The working poor were\noften the first subjects of scientific social planning. 19 Schemes for\nimproving their daily lives were promulgated by progressive urban and public-\nhealth policies and instituted in model factory towns and newly founded\nwelfare agencies. Subpopulations found wanting in ways that were potentially\nthreatening-such as indigents, vagabonds, the mentally ill, and criminals-\nmight be made the objects of the most intensive social engineering.20\n\nThe metaphor of gardening, Zygmunt Bauman suggests, captures much of this new\nspirit. The gardener-perhaps a landscape architect specializing in formal\ngardens is the most appropriate parallel-takes a natural site and creates an\nentirely designed space of botanical order. Although the organic character of\nthe flora limits what can be achieved, the gardener has enormous discretion in\nthe overall arrangement and in training, pruning, planting, and weeding out\nselected plants. As an untended forest is to a long-managed scientific forest,\nso untended nature is to the garden. The garden is one of man's attempts to\nimpose his own principles of order, utility, and beauty on nature.21 What\ngrows in the garden is always a small, consciously selected sample of what\nmight be grown there. Similarly, social engineers consciously set out to\ndesign and maintain a more perfect social order. An Enlightenment belief in\nthe self-improvement of man became, by degrees, a belief in the perfectibility\nof social order.\n\nOne of the great paradoxes of social engineering is that it seems at odds with\nthe experience of modernity generally. Trying to jell a social world, the most\nstriking characteristic of which appears to be flux, seems rather like trying\nto manage a whirlwind. Marx was hardly alone in claiming that the \"constant\nrevolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social\nrelations, everlasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois\nepoch from all earlier times.\"\" The experience of modernity (in literature,\nart, industry, transportation, and popular culture) was, above all, the\nexperience of disorienting speed, movement, and change, which self-proclaimed\nmodernists found exhilarating and liberating.23 Perhaps the most charitable\nway of resolving this paradox is to imagine that what these designers of\nsociety had in mind was roughly what designers of locomotives had in mind with\n\"streamlining.\" Rather than arresting social change, they hoped to design a\nshape to social life that would minimize the friction of progress. The\ndifficulty with this resolution is that state social engineering was\ninherently authoritarian. In place of multiple sources of invention and\nchange, there was a single planning authority; in place of the plasticity and\nautonomy of existing social life, there was a fixed social order in which\npositions were designated. The tendency toward various forms of \"social\ntaxidermy\" was unavoidable.\n\n#### The Radical Authority of High Modernism\n\nThe real thing is that this time we're going to get science applied to social\nproblems and backed by the whole force of the state, just as war has been\nbacked by the whole force of the state in the past.\n\n-C. S. Lewis, That Hideous Strength\n\nThe troubling features of high modernism derive, for the most part, from its\nclaim to speak about the improvement of the human condition with the authority\nof scientific knowledge and its tendency to disallow other competing sources\nof judgment.\n\nFirst and foremost, high modernism implies a truly radical break with history\nand tradition. Insofar as rational thought and scientific laws could provide a\nsingle answer to every empirical question, nothing ought to be taken for\ngranted. All human habits and practices that were inherited and hence not\nbased on scientific reasoning-from the structure of the family and patterns of\nresidence to moral values and forms of production-would have to be reexamined\nand redesigned. The structures of the past were typically the products of\nmyth, super stition, and religious prejudice. It followed that scientifically\ndesigned schemes for production and social life would be superior to received\ntradition.\n\nThe sources of this view are deeply authoritarian. If a planned social order\nis better than the accidental, irrational deposit of historical practice, two\nconclusions follow. Only those who have the scientific knowledge to discern\nand create this superior social order are fit to rule in the new age. Further,\nthose who through retrograde ignorance refuse to yield to the scientific plan\nneed to be educated to its benefits or else swept aside. Strong versions of\nhigh modernism, such as those heed by Lenin and Le Corbusier, cultivated an\nOlympian ruthlessness toward the subjects of their interventions. At its most\nradical, high modernism imagined wiping the slate utterly clean and beginning\nfrom zero.24\n\nHigh-modernist ideology thus tends to devalue or banish politics. Political\ninterests can only frustrate the social solutions devised by specialists with\nscientific tools adequate to their analysis. As individuals, high modernists\nmight well hold democratic views about popular sovereignty or classical\nliberal views about the inviolability of a private sphere that restrained\nthem, but such convictions are external to, and often at war with, their high-\nmodernist convictions.\n\nAlthough high modernists came to imagine the refashioning of social habits and\nof human nature itself, they began with a nearly limitless ambition to\ntransform nature to suit man's purposes-an ambition that remained central to\ntheir faith. How completely the utopian possibilities gripped intellectuals of\nalmost every political persuasion is captured in the paean to technical\nprogress of the Communist Manifesto, where Marx and Engels write of the\n\"subjection of nature's forces to man, machinery, and the application of\nchemistry to agriculture and industry, steam navigation, railways, electric\ntelegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalization of\nrivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground.\"25 In fact, this\npromise, made plausible by capitalist development, was for Marx the point of\ndeparture for socialism, which would place the fruits of capitalism at the\nservice of the working class for the first time. The intellectual air in the\nlate nineteenth century was filled with proposals for such vast engineering\nprojects as the Suez Canal, which was completed in 1869 with enormous\nconsequences for trade between Asia and Europe. The pages of Le globe, the\norgan of utopian socialists of Saint-Simon's persuasion, featured an endless\nstream of discussions about massive projects: the construction of Panama\nCanal, the development of the United States, far-reaching schemes for energy\nand transportation. This belief that it was man's destiny to tame nature to\nsuit his interests and preserve his safety is perhaps the keystone of high\nmodernism, partly because the success of so many grand ventures was already\nmanifest.','\n\nOnce again the authoritarian and statist implications of this vision are\nclear. The very scale of such projects meant that, with few exceptions (such\nas the early canals), they demanded large infusions of monies raised through\ntaxes or credit. Even if one could imagine them being financed privately in a\ncapitalist economy, they typically required a vast public authority empowered\nto condemn private property, relocate people against their will, guarantee the\nloans or bonds required, and coordinate the work of the many state agencies\ninvolved. In a statist society, be it Louis Napoleon's France or Lenin's\nSoviet Union, such power was already built into the political system. In a\nnonstatist society, such tasks have required new public authorities or\n\"superagencies\" having quasi-governmental powers for sending men to the moon\nor for constructing dams, irrigation works, highways, and public\ntransportation systems.\n\nThe temporal emphasis of high modernism is almost exclusively on the future.\nAlthough any ideology with a large altar dedicated to progress is bound to\nprivilege the future, high modernism carries this to great lengths. The past\nis an impediment, a history that must be transcended; the present is the\nplatform for launching plans for a better future. A key characteristic of\ndiscourses of high modernism and of the public pronouncements of those states\nthat have embraced it is a heavy reliance on visual images of heroic progress\ntoward a totally transformed future.27 The strategic choice of the future is\nfreighted with consequences. To the degree that the future is known and\nachievablea belief that the faith in progress encourages-the less future\nbenefits are discounted for uncertainty. The practical effect is to convince\nmost high modernists that the certainty of a better future justifies the many\nshort-term sacrifices required to get there.2\" The ubiquity of five-year plans\nin socialist states is an example of that conviction. Progress is objectified\nby a series of preconceived goals-largely material and quantifiable-which are\nto be achieved through savings, labor, and investments in the interim. There\nmay, of course, be no alternative to planning, especially when the urgency of\na single goal, such as winning a war, seems to require the subordination of\nevery other goal. The immanent logic of such an exercise, however, implies a\ndegree of certainty about the future, about means-ends calculations, and about\nthe meaning of human welfare that is truly heroic. That such plans have often\nhad to be adjusted or abandoned is an indication of just how heroic are the\nassumptions behind them.\n\nIn this reading, high modernism ought to appeal greatly to the classes and\nstrata who have most to gain-in status, power, and wealth-from its worldview.\nAnd indeed it is the ideology par excellence of the bureaucratic\nintelligentsia, technicians, planners, and en- gineers.29 The position\naccorded to them is not just one of rule and privilege but also one of\nresponsibility for the great works of nation building and social\ntransformation. Where this intelligentsia conceives of its mission as the\ndragging of a technically backward, unschooled, subsistence-oriented\npopulation into the twentieth century, its selfassigned cultural role as\neducator of its people becomes doubly grandiose. Having a historic mission of\nsuch breadth may provide a ruling intelligentsia with high morale, solidarity,\nand the willingness to make (and impose) sacrifices. This vision of a great\nfuture is often in sharp contrast to the disorder, misery, and unseemly\nscramble for petty advantage that the elites very likely see in their daily\nforeground. One might in fact speculate that the more intractable and\nresistant the real world faced by the planner, the greater the need for\nutopian plans to fill, as it were, the void that would otherwise invite\ndespair. The elites who elaborate such plans implicitly represent themselves\nas exemplars of the learning and progressive views to which their compatriots\nmight aspire. Given the ideological advantages of high modernism as a\ndiscourse, it is hardly surprising that so many postcolonial elites have\nmarched under its banner.30\n\nAided by hindsight as it is, this unsympathetic account of highmodernist\naudacity is, in one important respect, grossly unfair. If we put the\ndevelopment of high-modernist beliefs in their historical context, if we ask\nwho the enemies of high modernism actually were, a far more sympathetic\npicture emerges. Doctors and public-health engineers who did possess new\nknowledge that could save millions of lives were often thwarted by popular\nprejudices and entrenched political interests. Urban planners who could in\nfact redesign urban housing to be cheaper, more healthful, and more convenient\nwere blocked by realestate interests and existing tastes. Inventors and\nengineers who had devised revolutionary new modes of power and transportation\nfaced opposition from industrialists and laborers whose profits and jobs the\nnew technology would almost certainly displace.\n\nFor nineteenth-century high modernists, the scientific domination of nature\n(including human nature) was emancipatory. It \"promised freedom from scarcity,\nwant and the arbitrariness of natural calamity,\" David Harvey observes. \"The\ndevelopment of rational forms of social organization and rational modes of\nthought promised liberation from the irrationalities of myth, religion,\nsuperstition, release from the arbi trary use of power as well as from the\ndark side of our human natures.\"\" Before we turn to later versions of high\nmodernism, we should recall two important facts about their nineteenth-century\nforebears: first, that virtually every high-modernist intervention was\nundertaken in the name of and with the support of citizens seeking help and\nprotection, and, second, that we are all beneficiaries, in countless ways, of\nthese various high-modernist schemes.\n\n#### Twentieth-Century High Modernism\n\nThe idea of a root-and-branch, rational engineering of entire social orders in\ncreating realizable utopias is a largely twentieth-century phenomenon. And a\nrange of historical soils have seemed particularly favorable for the\nflourishing of high-modernist ideology. Those soils include crises of state\npower, such as wars and economic depressions, and circumstances in which a\nstate's capacity for relatively unimpeded planning is greatly enhanced, such\nas the revolutionary conquest of power and colonial rule.\n\nThe industrial warfare of the twentieth century has required unprecedented\nsteps toward the total mobilization of the society and the economy.32 Even\nquite liberal societies like the United States and Britain became, in the\ncontext of war mobilization, directly administered societies. The worldwide\ndepression of the 1930s similarly propelled liberal states into extensive\nexperiments in social and economic planning in an effort to relieve economic\ndistress and to retain popular legitimacy. In the cases of war and depression,\nthe rush toward an administered society has an aspect of force majeure to it.\nThe postwar rebuilding of a war-torn nation may well fall in the same\ncategory.\n\nRevolution and colonialism, however, are hospitable to high modernism for\ndifferent reasons. A revolutionary regime and a colonial regime each disposes\nof an unusual degree of power. The revolutionary state has defeated the ancien\nregime, often has its partisans' mandate to remake the society after its\nimage, and faces a prostrate civil society whose capacity for active\nresistance is limited.33 The millennial expectations commonly associated with\nrevolutionary movements give further impetus to high-modernist ambitions.\nColonial regimes, particularly late colonial regimes, have often been sites of\nextensive experiments in social engineering.34 An ideology of \"welfare\ncolonialism\" combined with the authoritarian power inherent in colonial rule\nhave encouraged ambitious schemes to remake native societies.\n\nIf one were required to pinpoint the \"birth\" of twentieth-century high\nmodernism, specifying a particular time, place, and individual in what is\nadmittedly a rather arbitrary exercise, given high modernism's many\nintellectual wellsprings-a strong case can be made for German mobilization\nduring World War I and the figure most closely associated with it, Walther\nRathenau. German economic mobilization was the technocratic wonder of the war.\nThat Germany kept its armies in the field and adequately supplied long after\nmost observers had predicted its collapse was largely due to Rathenau's\nplanning.35 An industrial engineer and head of the great electrical firm A.E.G\n(All- gemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft), which had been founded by his\nfather, Rathenau was placed in charge of the Office of War Raw Materials\n(Kriegsrohstoffabteilung).36 He realized that the planned rationing of raw\nmaterials and transport was the key to sustaining the war effort. Inventing a\nplanned economy step by step, as it were, Germany achieved feats-in industrial\nproduction, munitions and armament supply, transportation and traffic control,\nprice controls, and civilian rationing-that had never before been attempted.\nThe scope of planning and coordination necessitated an unprecedented\nmobilization of conscripts, soldiers, and war-related industrial labor. Such\nmobilization fostered the idea of creating \"administered mass organizations\"\nthat would encompass the entire society.37\n\nRathenau's faith in pervasive planning and in rationalizing production had\ndeep roots in the intellectual connection being forged between the physical\nlaws of thermodynamics on one hand and the new applied sciences of work on the\nother. For many specialists, a narrow and materialist \"productivism\" treated\nhuman labor as a mechanical system which could be decomposed into energy\ntransfers, motion, and the physics of work. The simplification of labor into\nisolated problems of mechanical efficiencies led directly to the aspiration\nfor a scientific control of the entire labor process. Late nineteenth-century\nmaterialism, as Anson Rabinbach emphasizes, had an equivalence between\ntechnology and physiology at its metaphysical core.3R\n\nThis productivism had at least two distinct lineages, one of them North\nAmerican and the other European. An American contribution came from the\ninfluential work of Frederick Taylor, whose minute decomposition of factory\nlabor into isolable, precise, repetitive motions had begun to revolutionize\nthe organization of factory work.39 For the factory manager or engineer, the\nnewly invented assembly lines permitted the use of unskilled labor and control\nover not only the pace of production but the whole labor process. The European\ntradition of \"energetics,\" which focused on questions of motion, fatigue,\nmeasured rest, rational hygiene, and nutrition, also treated the worker\nnotionally as a machine, albeit a machine that must be well fed and kept in\ngood\n\nworking order. In place of workers, there was an abstract, standardized worker\nwith uniform physical capacities and needs. Seen initially as a way of\nincreasing wartime efficiency at the front and in industry, the Kaiser Wilhelm\nInstitut fur Arbeitsphysiologie, like Taylorism, was based on a scheme to\nrationalize the body.40\n\nWhat is most remarkable about both traditions is, once again, how widely they\nwere believed by educated elites who were otherwise poles apart politically.\n\"Taylorism and technocracy were the watchwords of a three-pronged idealism:\nthe elimination of economic and social crisis, the expansion of productivity\nthrough science, and the reenchant- ment of technology. The vision of society\nin which social conflict was eliminated in favor of technological and\nscientific imperatives could embrace liberal, socialist, authoritarian, and\neven communist and fascist solutions. Productivism, in short, was politically\npromiscuous.\"41\n\nThe appeal of one or another form of productivism across much of the right and\ncenter of the political spectrum was largely due to its promise as a\ntechnological \"fix\" for class struggle. If, as its advocates claimed, it could\nvastly increase worker output, then the politics of redistribution could be\nreplaced by class collaboration, in which both profits and wages could grow at\nonce. For much of the left, productivism promised the replacement of the\ncapitalist by the engineer or by the state expert or official. It also\nproposed a single optimum solution, or \"best practice,\" for any problem in the\norganization of work. The logical outcome was some form of slide-rule\nauthoritarianism in the interest, presumably, of all .41\n\nA combination of Rathenau's broad training in philosophy and economics, his\nwartime experience with planning, and the social conclusions that he thought\nwere inherent in the precision, reach, and transforming potential of electric\npower allowed him to draw the broadest lessons for social organization. In the\nwar, private industry had given way to a kind of state socialism; \"gigantic\nindustrial enterprises had transcended their ostensibly private owners and all\nthe laws of prop- erty.\"43 The decisions required had nothing to do with\nideology; they were driven by purely technical and economic necessities. The\nrule of specialists and the new technological possibilities, particularly huge\nelectric power grids, made possible a new social-industrial order that was\nboth centralized and locally autonomous. During the time when war made\nnecessary a coalition among industrial firms, technocrats, and the state,\nRathenau discerned the shape of a progressive peacetime society. Inasmuch as\nthe technical and economic requirements for reconstruction were obvious and\nrequired the same sort of collaboration in all countries, Rathenau's\nrationalist faith in planning had an internationalist flavor. He characterized\nthe modern era as a \"new machine order ... [and] a consolidation of the world\ninto an unconscious association of constraint, into an uninterrupted community\nof production and harmony.\"44\n\nThe world war was the high-water mark for the political influence of engineers\nand planners. Having seen what could be accomplished in extremis, they\nimagined what they could achieve if the identical energy and planning were\ndevoted to popular welfare rather than mass destruction. Together with many\npolitical leaders, industrialists, labor leaders, and prominent intellectuals\n(such as Philip Gibbs in England, Ernst Junger in Germany, and Gustave Le Bon\nin France), they concluded that only a renewed and comprehensive dedication to\ntechnical innovation and the planning it made possible could rebuild the\nEuropean economies and bring social peace .41\n\nLenin himself was deeply impressed by the achievements of German industrial\nmobilization and believed that it had shown how production might be\nsocialized. Just as Lenin believed that Marx had discovered immutable social\nlaws akin to Darwin's laws of evolution, so he believed that the new\ntechnologies of mass production were scientific laws and not social\nconstructions. Barely a month before the October 1917 revolution, he wrote\nthat the war had \"accelerated the development of capitalism to such a\ntremendous degree, converting monopoly capitalism into state-monopoly\ncapitalism, that neither the proletariat nor the revolutionary petty-bourgeois\ndemocrats can keep within the limits of capitalism.\"46 He and his economic\nadvisers drew directly on the work of Rathenau and Mollendorf in their plans\nfor the Soviet economy. The German war economy was for Lenin \"the ultimate in\nmodern, large-scale capitalist techniques, planning and organization\"; he took\nit to be the prototype of a socialized economy.47 Presumably, if the state in\nquestion were in the hands of representatives of the working class, the basis\nof a socialist system would exist. Lenin's vision of the future looked much\nlike Rathenau's, providing, of course, we ignore the not so small matter of a\nrevolutionary seizure of power.\n\nLenin was not slow to appreciate how Taylorism on the factory floor offered\nadvantages for the socialist control of production. Although he had earlier\ndenounced such techniques, calling them the \"scientific extortion of sweat,\"\nby the time of the revolution he had become an enthusiastic advocate of\nsystematic control as practiced in Germany. He extolled \"the principle of\ndiscipline, organization, and harmonious cooperation based upon the most\nmodern, mechanized industry, the most rigid system of accountability and\ncontrol .\"41\n\nThe Taylor system, the last word of capitalism in this respect, like all\ncapitalist progress, is a combination of the subtle brutality of bourgeois\nexploitation and a number of its great scientific achievements in the fields\nof analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous\nand awkward motions, the working out of correct methods of work, the\nintroduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet\nRepublic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of\nscience and technology in this field.... We must organize in Russia the study\nand teaching of the Taylor system and systematically try it out and adapt it\nto our purposes.49\n\nBy 1918, with production falling, he was calling for rigid work norms and, if\nnecessary, the reintroduction of hated piecework. The first All-Russian\nCongress for Initiatives in Scientific Management was convened in 1921 and\nfeatured disputes between advocates of Taylorism and those of energetics (also\ncalled ergonomics). At least twenty institutes and as many journals were by\nthen devoted to scientific management in the Soviet Union. A command economy\nat the macrolevel and Taylorist principles of central coordination at the\nmicrolevel of the factory floor provided an attractive and symbiotic package\nfor an authoritarian, high-modernist revolutionary like Lenin.\n\nDespite the authoritarian temptations of twentieth-century high modernism,\nthey have often been resisted. The reasons are not only complex; they are\ndifferent from case to case. While it is not my intention to examine in detail\nall the potential obstacles to high-modernist planning, the particular barrier\nposed by liberal democratic ideas and institutions deserves emphasis. Three\nfactors seem decisive. The first is the existence and belief in a private\nsphere of activity in which the state and its agencies may not legitimately\ninterfere. To be sure, this zone of autonomy has had a beleaguered existence\nas, following Mannheim, more heretofore private spheres have been made the\nobject of official intervention. Much of the work of Michel Foucault was an\nattempt to map these incursions into health, sexuality, mental illness,\nvagrancy, or sanitation and the strategies behind them. Nevertheless, the idea\nof a private realm has served to limit the ambitions of many high modernists,\nthrough either their own political values or their healthy respect for the\npolitical storm that such incursions would provoke.\n\nThe second, closely related factor is the private sector in liberal political\neconomy. As Foucault put it: unlike absolutism and mercantilism, \"political\neconomy announces the unknowability for the sovereign of the totality of\neconomic processes and, as a consequence, the impossibility of an economic\nsovereignty.\" 50 The point of liberal political economy was not only that a\nfree market protected property and cre ated wealth but also that the economy\nwas far too complex for it ever to be managed in detail by a hierarchical\nadministration.5'\n\nThe third and by far most important barrier to thoroughgoing highmodernist\nschemes has been the existence of working, representative institutions through\nwhich a resistant society could make its influence felt. Such institutions\nhave thwarted the most draconian features of high-modernist schemes in roughly\nthe same way that publicity and mobilized opposition in open societies, as\nAmartya Sen has argued, have prevented famines. Rulers, he notes, do not go\nhungry, and they are unlikely to learn about and respond readily to curb\nfamine unless their institutional position provides strong incentives. The\nfreedoms of speech, of assembly, and of the press ensure that widespread\nhunger will be publicized, while the freedoms of assembly and elections in\nrepresentative institutions ensure that it is in the interest of elected\nofficials' self-preservation to prevent famine when they can. In the same\nfashion, high-modernist schemes in liberal democratic settings must\naccommodate themselves sufficiently to local opinion in order to avoid being\nundone at the polls.\n\nBut high modernism, unimpeded by liberal political economy, is best grasped\nthrough the working out of its high ambitions and its consequences. It is to\nthis practical terrain in urban planning and revolutionary discourse that we\nnow turn.\n\n\n# 4 The High-Modernist City:  \nAn Experiment and a Critique\n\n![](img0021.jpg)\n\nNo one, wise Kuublai, knows better than you that the city must never be\nconfused with the words that describe it.\n\n-Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities\n\nTime is a fatal handicap to the baroque conception of the world: its\nmechanical order makes no allowances for growth, change, adaptation, and\ncreative renewal. In short, a baroque plan was a block achievement. It must be\nlaid out at a stroke, fixed and frozen forever, as if done overnight by\nArabian nights genii. Such a plan demands an architectural despot, working for\nan absolute ruler, who will live long enough to complete their own\nconceptions. To alter this type of plan, to introduce fresh elements of\nanother style, is to break its esthetic backbone.\n\n-Lewis Mumford, The City in History\n\nIn Mumford's epigraph to this chapter, his criticism is directed at Pierre-\nCharles L: Enfant's Washington in particular and at baroque urban planning in\ngeneral.' Greatly amplified, Mumford's criticism could be applied to the work\nand thought of the Swiss-born French essayist, painter, architect, and planner\nCharles-Edouard Jeanneret, who is better known by his professional name, Le\nCorbusier. Jeanneret was the embodiment of high-modernist urban design. Active\nroughly between 1920 and 1960, he was less an architect than a visionary\nplanner of planetary ambitions. The great majority of his gargantuan schemes\nwere never built; they typically required a political resolve and financial\nwherewithal that few political authorities could muster. Some monuments to his\nexpansive genius do exist, the most notable of which are perhaps Chandigarh,\nthe austere capital of India's Punjab, and :Unite d'Habitation, a large\napartment complex in Marseilles, but his legacy is most apparent in the logic\nof his unbuilt megaprojects. At one time or another he proposed city-planning\nschemes for Paris, Algiers, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires,\nStockholm, Geneva, and Barcelona.2 His early politics was a bizarre\ncombination of Sorel's revolutionary syndicalism and Saint-Simon's utopian\nmodernism, and he designed both in Soviet Russia (1928-36)3 and in Vichy for\nMarshal Philippe Petain. The key manifesto of modern urban planning, the\nAthens charter of the Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (c1AM),\nfaithfully reflected his doctrines.\n\nLe Corbusier embraced the huge, machine-age, hierarchical, centralized city\nwith a vengeance. If one were looking for a caricaturea Colonel Blimp, as it\nwere, of modernist urbanism-one could hardly do better than to invent Le\nCorbusier. His views were extreme but influential, and they were\nrepresentative in the sense that they celebrated the logic implicit in high\nmodernism. In his daring, his brilliance, and his consistency, Le Corbusier\ncasts the high-modernist faith in sharp relief.4\n\n#### Total City Planning\n\nIn The Radiant City (La ville radieuse), published in 1933 and republished\nwith few changes in 1964, Le Corbusier offers the most complete exposition of\nhis views.5 Here as elsewhere, Le Corbusier's plans were self-consciously\nimmodest. If E. F. Schumacher made the case for the virtue of smallness, Le\nCorbusier asserted, in effect, \"Big is beautiful.\" The best way to appreciate\nthe sheer extravagance of his reach is to look briefly at three of his\ndesigns. The first is the core idea behind his Plan Voisin for central Paris\n(figure 14); the second, a new \"business city\" for Buenos Aires (figure 15);\nand the last, a vast housing scheme for about ninety thousand residents in Rio\nde Janeiro (figure 16).\n\nIn their magnitude, these plans speak for themselves. No compromise is made\nwith the preexisting city; the new cityscape completely supplants its\npredecessor. In each case, the new city has striking sculptural properties; it\nis designed to make a powerful visual impact as a form. That impact, it is\nworth noting, can be had only from a great distance. Buenos Aires is pictured\nas if seen from many miles out to sea: a view of the New World \"after a two-\nweek crossing,\" writes Le Corbusier, adopting the perspective of a modern-day\nChristopher Columbus.,Rio is seen at several miles remove, as if from an\nairplane. What we behold is a six-kilometer-long highway elevated one hundred\nmeters and enclosing a continuous ribbon of fifteen-story apartments. The new\ncity literally towers over the old. The plan for a city of 3 million in Paris\nis seen from far above and outside, the distance emphasized by dots\nrepresenting vehicles on the major avenue as well as by a small airplane and\nwhat appears to be a helicopter. None of the plans makes any reference to the\nurban history, traditions, or aesthetic tastes of the place in which it is to\nbe located. The cities depicted, however striking, betray no context; in their\nneutrality, they could be anywhere at all. While astoundingly high\nconstruction costs may explain why none of these projects was ever adopted, Le\nCorbusier's refusal to make any appeal to local pride in an existing city\ncannot have helped his case.\n\n![](img0022.jpg)\n\n14\\. Le Corbusier's Plan Voisin for Paris, a city of 3 million people\n\n![](img0023.jpg)\n\n15\\. Le Corbusier's plan for the \"business city\" of Buenos Aires, as if seen\nfrom an approaching ship\n\n![](img0024.jpg)\n\n16\\. Le Corbusier's plan for roads and housing in Rio de Janeiro\n\nLe Corbusier had no patience for the physical environment that centuries of\nurban living had created. He heaped scorn on the tangle, darkness, and\ndisorder, the crowded and pestilential conditions, of Paris and other European\ncities at the turn of the century. Part of his scorn was, as we shall see, on\nfunctional and scientific grounds; a city that was to become efficient and\nhealthful would indeed have had to demolish much of what it had inherited. But\nanother source of his scorn was aesthetic. He was visually offended by\ndisarray and confusion. And the disorder he wished to correct was not so much\na disorder at ground level but a disorder that was a function of distance, a\nbird'seye view.' His mixed motives are nicely captured in his judgment on\nsmall rural properties as seen from the air (figure 17). \"From airplanes, a\nlook down on infinitely subdivided, incongruously shaped plots of land. The\nmore modern machinery develops, the more land is chopped up into tiny holdings\nthat render the miraculous promise of machinery useless. The result is waste:\ninefficient, individual scrabbling.\"' The purely formal order was at least as\nimportant as the accommodation with the machine age. \"Architecture,\" he\ninsisted, \"is the art above all others which achieves a state of platonic\ngrandeur, mathematical order, speculation, the perception of harmony that lies\nin emotional relationships.\"9\n\nFormal, geometric simplicity and functional efficiency were not two distinct\ngoals to be balanced; on the contrary, formal order was a precondition of\nefficiency. Le Corbusier set himself the task of inventing the ideal\nindustrial city, in which the \"general truths\" behind the machine age would be\nexpressed with graphic simplicity. The rigor and unity of this ideal city\nrequired that it make as few concessions as possible to the history of\nexisting cities. \"We must refuse to afford even the slightest concession to\nwhat is: to the mess we are in now,\" he wrote. \"There is no solution to be\nfound there.\" Instead, his new city would preferably rise on a cleared site as\na single, integrated urban composi tion. Le Corbusier's new urban order was to\nbe a lyrical marriage between Cartesian pure forms and the implacable\nrequirements of the machine. In characteristically bombastic terms, he\ndeclared, \"We claim, in the name of the steamship, the airplane, and the\nautomobile, the right to health, logic, daring, harmony, perfection.\"10 Unlike\nthe existing city of Paris, which to him resembled a \"porcupine\" and a \"vision\nof Dante's Inferno,\" his city would be an \"organized, serene, forceful, airy,\nordered entity.\" 11\n\n##### Geometry and Standardization\n\nIt is impossible to read much of Le Corbusier or to see many of his\narchitectural drawings without noticing his love (mania?) for simple,\nrepetitive lines and his horror of complexity. He makes a personal commitment\nto austere lines and represents that commitment as an essential characteristic\nof human nature. In his own words, \"an infinity of combinations is possible\nwhen innumerable and diverse elements are brought together. But the human mind\nloses itself and becomes fatigued by such a labyrinth of possibilities.\nControl becomes impossible. The spiritual failure that must result is\ndisheartening.... Reason ... is an unbroken straight line. Thus, in order to\nsave himself from this chaos, in order to provide himself with a bearable,\nacceptable framework for his existence, one productive of human well-being and\ncontrol, man has projected the laws of nature into a system that is a\nmanifestation of the human spirit itself: geometry.\"\"\n\n![](img0025.jpg)\n\n17\\. Aerial view of Alsace, circa 1930, from Le Corbusier's La ville radieuse\n\nWhen Le Corbusier visited New York City, he was utterly taken by the geometric\nlogic of midtown Manhattan. The clarity of what he called the \"skyscraper\nmachines\" and the street plan pleased him: \"The streets are at right angles to\neach other and the mind is liberated.\"\" Elsewhere Le Corbusier answered what\nhe saw as the criticism of those who were nostalgic for the variety of the\nexisting city-in this case, Paris. People may complain, he noted, that in\nreality streets intersect at all sorts of angles and that the variations are\ninfinite. \"But,\" he replied, \"that's precisely the point. I eliminate all\nthose things. That's my starting point.... I insist on right-angled\nintersections.\" 14\n\nLe Corbusier would have liked to endow his love of straight lines and right\nangles with the authority of the machine, of science, and of nature. Neither\nthe brilliance of his designs nor the heat of his polemic, however, could\nsucceed in justifying this move. The machines to which he most adoringly\nreferred-the locomotive, the airplane, and the automobile-embody rounder or\nmore elliptical shapes than right angles (the teardrop being the most\nstreamlined of shapes). As for science, any shape is geometrical: the\ntrapezoid, the triangle, the circle. If sheer simplicity or efficiency was the\ncriterion, why not prefer the circle or sphere-as the minimum surface\nenclosing the maximum space-to the square or the rectangle? Nature, as Le\nCorbusier claimed, might be mathematical, but the complex, intricate,\n\"chaotic\" logic of living forms has only recently been understood with the aid\nof computers.15 No, the great architect was expressing no more, and no less,\nthan an aesthetic ideology-a strong taste for classic lines, which he also\nconsidered to be \"Gallic\" lines: \"sublime straight lines, and oh, sublime\nFrench rigor.\" 16 It was one powerful way of mastering space. What's more, it\nprovided a legible grid that could be easily grasped at a glance and that\ncould be repeated in every direction, ad infinitum. As a practical matter, of\ncourse, a straight line was often impractical and ruinously expensive. Where\nthe topography was irregular, building a straight, flat avenue without\ndaunting climbs and descents would require great feats of digging and\nleveling. Le Corbusier's kind of geometry was rarely cost effective.\n\nHe took his utopian scheme for an abstract, linear city to impressive lengths.\nHe foresaw that the industrialization of the construction trades would lead to\na welcome standardization. He foresaw, too, the prefabrication of houses and\noffice blocks, whose parts were built at factories and then assembled at the\nbuilding sites. The sizes of all elements would be standardized, with\nmultiples of standard sizes allowing for unique combinations determined by the\narchitect. Door frames, windows, bricks, roof tiles, and even screws would all\nconform to a uniform code. The first manifesto of c1AM in 1928 called for the\nnew standards to be legislated by the League of Nations, which would develop a\nuniversal technical language to be compulsorily taught throughout the world.\nAn international convention would \"normalize\" the various standard\nmeasurements for domestic equipment and appliances.\" Le Corbusier made efforts\nto practice what he preached. His design for the mammoth Palace of Soviets\n(never built) was intended to appeal to Soviet high modernism. The building,\nhe claimed, would establish precise and universal new standards for all\nbuildings-standards that would cover lighting, heating, ventilation,\nstructure, and aesthetics and that would be valid in all latitudes for all\nneeds.\"\n\nThe straight line, the right angle, and the imposition of international\nbuilding standards were all determined steps in the direction of\nsimplification. Perhaps the most decisive step, however, was Le Corbusier's\nlifelong insistence on strict functional separation. Indicative of this\ndoctrine was the second of fourteen principles he enunciated at the beginning\nof La ville radieuse, namely, \"the death of the street.\" What he meant by this\nwas simply the complete separation of pedestrian traffic from vehicle traffic\nand, beyond that, the segregation of slowfrom fast-moving vehicles. He\nabhorred the mingling of pedestrians and vehicles, which made walking\nunpleasant and impeded the circulation of traffic.\n\nThe principle of functional segregation was applied across the board. Written\nby Le Corbusier and his brother Pierre, the final report for the second\nmeeting of c1AM, in 1929, began with an assault on traditional housing\nconstruction: \"The poverty, the inadequacy of traditional techniques have\nbrought in their wake a confusion of powers, an artificial \"tingling of\nfunctions, only indifferently related to one another.... We must find and\napply new methods ... lending themselves naturally to standardization,\nindustrialization, Taylorization.... If we persist in the present methods by\nwhich the two functions [arrangement and furnishing versus construction;\ncirculation versus structure] are mingled and interdependent, then we will\nremain petrified in the same immobility\"\"\n\nOutside the apartment block, the city itself was an exercise in planned\nfunctional segregation-an exercise that became standard urban-planning\ndoctrine until the late 1960s. There would be separate zones for workplaces,\nresidences, shopping and entertainment centers, and monuments and government\nbuildings. Where possible, work zones were to be further subdivided into\noffice buildings and factories. Le Corbusier's insistence on an urban plan in\nwhich each district had one and only one function was evident in his first act\nafter taking over the planning of Chandigarh, his only built city. He replaced\nthe housing that had been planned for the city center with an \"acropolis of\nmonuments\" on a 220-acre site at a great distance from the nearest\nresidences.20 In his Plan Voisin for Paris, he separated what he called la\nville, which was for dwelling, and the business center, which was for working.\n\"These are two distinct functions, consecutive and not simultaneous,\nrepresentative of two distinct and categorically separate areas.\"21\n\nThe logic of this rigid segregation of functions is perfectly clear. It is far\neasier to plan an urban zone if it has just one purpose. It is far easier to\nplan the circulation of pedestrians if they do not have to compete with\nautomobiles and trains. It is far easier to plan a forest if its sole purpose\nis to maximize the yield of furniture-grade timber. When two purposes must be\nserved by a single facility or plan, the trade-offs become nettlesome. When\nseveral or many purposes must be considered, the variables that the planner\nmust juggle begin to boggle the mind. Faced with such a labyrinth of\npossibilities, as Le Corbusier noted, \"the human mind loses itself and becomes\nfatigued.\"\n\nThe segregation of functions thus allowed the planner to think with greater\nclarity about efficiency. If the only function of roads is to get automobiles\nfrom A to B quickly and economically, then one can compare two road plans in\nterms of relative efficiency. This logic is eminently reasonable inasmuch as\nthis is precisely what we have in mind when we build a road from A to B.\nNotice, however, that the clarity is achieved by bracketing the many other\npurposes that we may want roads to serve, such as affording the leisure of a\ntouristic drive, providing aesthetic beauty or visual interest, or enabling\nthe transfer of heavy goods. Even in the case of roads, narrow criteria of\nefficiency ignore other ends that are not trivial. In the case of the places\nthat people call home, narrow criteria of efficiency do considerably greater\nviolence to human practice. Le Corbusier calculates the air (1a respiration\nexacte), heat, light, and space people need as a matter of public health.\nStarting with a figure of fourteen square meters per person, he reckons that\nthis could be reduced to ten square meters if such activities as food\npreparation and laundering were communal. But here the criteria of efficiency\nthat may apply to a road can hardly do justice to a home, which is variously\nused as a place for work, recreation, privacy, sociability, education,\ncooking, gossip, politics, and so on. Each of these activities, moreover,\nresists being reduced to criteria of efficiency; what is going on in the\nkitchen when someone is cooking for friends who have gathered there is not\nmerely \"food preparation.\" But the logic of efficient planning from above for\nlarge populations requires that each of the values being maximized be sharply\nspecified and that the number of values being maximized simultaneously be\nsharply restricted-preferably to a single value.22 The logic of Le Corbusier's\ndoctrine was to carefully delineate urban space by use and function so that\nsingle-purpose planning and standardization were possible.23\n\n##### Rule by the Plan, the Planner, and the State\n\nThe first of Le Corbusier's \"principles of urbanism,\" before even the death of\nthe street,\" was the dictum \"The Plan: Dictator.\"24 It would be difficult to\nexaggerate the emphasis that, like Descartes, Le Corbusier placed on making\nthe city the reflection of a single, rational plan. He greatly admired Roman\ncamps and imperial cities for the overall logic of their layouts. He returned\nrepeatedly to the contrast between the existing city, which is the product of\nhistorical chance, and the city of the future, which would be consciously\ndesigned from start to finish following scientific principles.\n\nThe centralization required by Le Corbusier's doctrine of the Plan (always\ncapitalized in his usage) is replicated by the centralization of the city\nitself. Functional segregation was joined to hierarchy. His city was a\n\"monocephalic\" city, its centrally located core performing the \"higher\"\nfunctions of the metropolitan area. This is how he described the business\ncenter of his Plan Voisin for Paris: \"From its offices come the commands that\nput the world in order. In fact, the skyscrapers are the brain of the city,\nthe brain of the whole country. They embody the work of elaboration and\ncommand on which all activities depend. Everything is concentrated there: the\ntools that conquer time and space-telephones, telegraphs, radios, the banks,\ntrading houses, the organs of decision for the factories: finance, technology,\ncommerce.\"25\n\nThe business center issues commands; it does not suggest, much less consult.\nThe program of high-modernist authoritarianism at work here stems in part from\nLe Corbusier's love of the order of the factory. In condemning the \"rot\" (la\npourriture) of the contemporary city, its houses, and its streets, he singles\nout the factory as the sole exception. There, a single rational purpose\nstructures both the physical layout and the coordinated movements of hundreds.\nThe Van Nelle tobacco factory in Rotterdam is praised in particular. Le\nCorbusier admires its auster ity, its floor-to-ceiling windows on each floor,\nthe order in the work, and the apparent contentment of the workers. He\nfinishes with a hymn to the authoritarian order of the production line. \"There\nis a hierarchical scale, famously established and respected,\" he admiringly\nobserves of the workers. \"They accept it so as to manage themselves like a\ncolony of worker-bees: order, regularity, punctuality, justice and\npaternalism.\"26\n\nThe scientific urban planner is to the design and construction of the city as\nthe entrepreneur-engineer is to the design and construction of the factory.\nJust as a single brain plans the city and the factory, so a single brain\ndirects its activity-from the factory's office and from the city's business\ncenter. The hierarchy doesn't stop there. The city is the brain of the whole\nsociety. \"The great city commands everything: peace, war, work.\"27 Whether it\nis a matter of clothing, philosophy, technology, or taste, the great city\ndominates and colonizes the provinces: the lines of influence and command are\nexclusively from the center to the periphery\"\n\nThere is no ambiguity to Le Corbusier's view of how authority relations should\nbe ordered: hierarchy prevails in every direction. At the apex of the pyramid,\nhowever, is not a capricious autocrat but rather a modern philosopher-king who\napplies the truths of scientific understanding for the well-being of all.29 It\nis true, naturally, that the master planner, in his not infrequent bouts of\nmegalomania, imagines that he alone has a monopoly on the truth. In a moment\nof personal reflection in The Radiant City, for example, Le Corbusier\ndeclares: \"I drew up plans [for Algiers], after analyses, after calculations,\nwith imagination, with poetry. The plans were prodigiously true. They were\nincontrovertible. They were breathtaking. They expressed all the splendor of\nmodern times.\"30 It is not, however, the excess of pride that concerns us here\nbut the sort of implacable authority Le Corbusier feels entitled to claim on\nbehalf of universal scientific truths. His high-modernist faith is nowhere so\nstarkly-or so ominously-expressed as in the following, which I quote at\nlength:\n\nThe despot is not a man. It is the Plan. The correct, realistic, exact plan,\nthe one that will provide your solution once the problem has been posited\nclearly, in its entirety, in its indispensable harmony. This plan has been\ndrawn up well away from the frenzy in the mayor's office or the town hall,\nfrom the cries of the electorate or the laments of society's victims. It has\nbeen drawn up by serene and lucid minds. It has taken account of nothing but\nhuman truths. It has ignored all current regulations, all existing usages, and\nchannels. It has not considered whether or not it could be carried out with\nthe constitution now in force. It is a biological creation destined for human\nbeings and capable of realization by modern techniques.3\"\n\nThe wisdom of the plan sweeps away all social obstacles: the elected\nauthorities, the voting public, the constitution, and the legal structure. At\nthe very least, we are in the presence of a dictatorship of the planner; at\nmost, we approach a cult of power and remorselessness that is reminiscent of\nfascist imagery\" Despite the imagery, Le Corbusier sees himself as a technical\ngenius and demands power in the name of his truths. Technocracy, in this\ninstance, is the belief that the human problem of urban design has a unique\nsolution, which an expert can discover and execute. Deciding such technical\nmatters by politics and bargaining would lead to the wrong solution. As there\nis a single, true answer to the problem of planning the modern city, no\ncompromises are possible.33\n\nThroughout his career, Le Corbusier is clearly aware that his kind of root-\nand-branch urban planning requires authoritarian measures. \"A Colbert is\nrequired,\" he declares to his French reading public in an early article\nentitled \"Toward a Machine Age Paris.\"34 On the title page of his major work,\none finds the words, \"This work is Dedicated to Authority.\" Much of Le\nCorbusier's career as a would-be public architect can be read as a quest for a\n\"Prince\" (preferably an authoritarian one) who would anoint him as the court's\nColbert. He exhibited designs for the League of Nations, lobbied the Soviet\nelite to accept his new plan for Moscow, and did what he could to get himself\nappointed as regulator of planning and zoning for the whole of France and to\nwin the adoption of his plan for the new Algiers. Finally, under the patronage\nof Jawaharlal Nehru, he built a provincial capital at Chandigarh in India.\nAlthough Le Corbusier's own political affiliations in France were firmly\nanchored on the right,35 he would clearly have settled for any state authority\nthat would give him a free hand. He was appealing to logic rather than\npolitics when he wrote, \"Once his [the scientific planner's] calculations are\nfinished, he is in a position to say-and he does say: It shall be thus!\"36\n\nWhat captivated Le Corbusier about the Soviet Union was not so much its\nideology as the prospect that a revolutionary, high-modernist state might\nprove hospitable to a visionary planner. After building the headquarters of\nthe Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives (Cen- trosoyuz),37 he proposed, in\nplans prepared in only six weeks, a vast design for the rebuilding of Moscow\nin line with what he thought were Soviet aspirations to create an entirely new\nmode of living in a classless society. Having seen Sergey Eisenstein's film\nabout the peasantry and technology, The General Line, Le Corbusier was utterly\ntaken with its celebration of tractors, centrifuge creamers, and huge farms.\nHe referred to it often in his plan to work a comparable transformation of\nRussia's urban landscape.\n\nStalin's commissars found his plans for Moscow as well as his project for the\nPalace of Soviets too radical.38 The Soviet modernist El Lis- sitzky attacked\nLe Corbusier's Moscow as a \"city of nowhere, ... [a city] that is neither\ncapitalist, nor proletarian, nor socialist, ... a city on paper, extraneous to\nliving nature, located in a desert through which not even a river must be\nallowed to pass (since a curve would contradict the style).\"39 As if to\nconfirm El Lissitzky's charge that he had designed a \"city of nowhere,\" Le\nCorbusier recycled his design virtually intact-aside from removing all\nreferences to Moscow-and presented it as La ville radieuse, suitable for\ncentral Paris.\n\n##### The City as a Utopian Project\n\nBelieving that his revolutionary urban planning expressed universal scientific\ntruths, Le Corbusier naturally assumed that the public, once they understood\nthis logic, would embrace his plan. The original manifesto of CLAM called for\nprimary school students to be taught the elementary principles of scientific\nhousing: the importance of sunlight and fresh air to health; the rudiments of\nelectricity, heat, lighting, and sound; the right principles of furniture\ndesign; and so on. These were matters of science, not of taste; instruction\nwould create, in time, a clientele worthy of the scientific architect. Whereas\nthe scientific forester could, as it were, go right to work on the forest and\nshape it to his plan, the scientific architect was obliged to first train a\nnew clientele that would \"freely\" choose the urban life that Le Corbusier had\nplanned for them.\n\nAny architect, I imagine, supposes that the dwellings she designs will\ncontribute to her clients' happiness rather than to their misery. The\ndifference lies in how the architect understands happiness. For Le Corbusier,\n\"human happiness already exists expressed in terms of numbers, of mathematics,\nof properly calculated designs, plans in which the cities can already be\nseen.\"40 He was certain, at least rhetorically, that since his city was the\nrational expression of a machine-age consciousness, modern man would embrace\nit wholeheartedly. 41\n\nThe kinds of satisfactions that the citizen-subject of Le Corbusier's city\nwould experience, however, were not the pleasures of personal freedom and\nautonomy. They were the pleasures of fitting logically into a rational plan:\n\"Authority must now step in, patriarchal authority, the authority of a father\nconcerned for his children.... We must build places where mankind will be\nreborn. When the collective functions of the urban community have been\norganized, then there will be individual liberty for all. Each man will live\nin an ordered relation to the whole .\"41 In the Plan Voisin for Paris, the\nplace of each individual in the great urban hierarchy is spatially coded. The\nbusiness elite (industrials) will live in high-rise apartments at the core,\nwhile the subaltern classes will have small garden apartments at the\nperiphery. One's status can be directly read from one's distance from the\ncenter. But, like everyone in a well-run factory, everyone in the city will\nhave the \"collective pride\" of a team of workers producing a perfect product.\n\"The worker who does only a part of the job understands the role of his labor;\nthe machines that cover the floor of the factory are examples to him of power\nand clarity, and make him part of a work of perfection to which his simple\nspirit never dared to aspire.\"43 Just as Le Corbusier was perhaps most famous\nfor asserting that \"the home is a machine for living,\" so he thought of the\nplanned city as a large, efficient machine with many closely calibrated parts.\nHe assumed, therefore, that the citizens of his city would accept, with pride,\ntheir own modest role in a noble, scientifically planned urban machine.\n\nBy his own lights Le Corbusier was planning for the basic needs of his fellow\nmen-needs that were ignored or traduced in the existing city. Essentially, he\nestablished them by stipulating an abstract, simplified human subject with\ncertain material and physical requirements. This schematic subject needed so\nmany square meters of living space, so much fresh air, so much sunlight, so\nmuch open space, so many essential services. At this level, he designed a city\nthat was indeed far more healthful and functional than the crowded, dark slums\nagainst which he railed. Thus he spoke of \"punctual and exact respiration,\" of\nvarious formulas for determining optimal sizes for apartments; he insisted on\napartment skyscrapers to allow for park space and, above all, for efficient\ntraffic circulation.\n\nThe Le Corbusian city was designed, first and foremost, as a workshop for\nproduction. Human needs, in this context, were scientifically stipulated by\nthe planner. Nowhere did he admit that the subjects for whom he was planning\nmight have something valuable to say on this matter or that their needs might\nbe plural rather than singular. Such was his concern with efficiency that he\ntreated shopping and meal preparation as nuisances that would be discharged by\ncentral services like those offered by well-run hotels.44 Although floor space\nwas provided for social activities, he said almost nothing about the actual\nsocial and cultural needs of the citizenry.\n\nHigh modernism implies, as we have seen, a rejection of the past as a model to\nimprove upon and a desire to make a completely fresh start. The more utopian\nthe high modernism, the more thoroughgoing its implied critique of the\nexisting society. Some of the most vituperative prose of The Radiant City was\ndirected at the misery, confusion, \"rot,\" \"decay,\" \"scum,\" and \"refuse\" of the\ncities that Le Corbusier wanted to transcend. The slums he showed in pictures\nwere labeled \"shabby\" or, in the case of the French capital, \"history,\nhistoric and tubercular Paris.\" He deplored both the conditions of the slums\nand the people they had created. \"How many of those five million [those who\ncame from the countryside to make their fortune] are simply a dead weight on\nthe city, an obstacle, a black clot of misery, of failure, of human garbage?\n\"41\n\nHis objection to the slums was twofold. First, they failed aesthetically to\nmeet his standards of discipline, purpose, and order. \"Is there anything,\" he\nasked rhetorically, \"more pitiful than an undisciplined crowd?\" Nature, he\nadded, is \"all discipline\" and will \"sweep them away\" even if nature operates\nby a logic \"contrary to the interests of mankind.\"46 Here he signals that the\nfounders of the modern city must be prepared to act ruthlessly. The second\ndanger of the slums was that, besides being noisy, dangerous, dusty, dark, and\ndisease-ridden, they harbored a potential revolutionary menace to the\nauthorities. He understood, as Haussmann had, that crowded slums were and had\nalways been an obstacle to efficient police work. Switching back and forth\nbetween Louis XIV's Paris and imperial Rome, Le Corbusier wrote: \"From the\nhuddle of hovels, from the depths of grimy lairs (in Rome-the Rome of the\nCaesars-the plebes lived in an inextricable chaos of abutting and warren-like\nskyscrapers), there sometimes came the hot gust of rebellion; the plot would\nbe hatched in the dark recesses of an accumulated chaos in which any kind of\npolice activity was extremely difficult.... St. Paul of Tarsus was impossible\nto arrest while he stayed in the slums, and the words of his Sermons were\npassed like wildfire from mouth to mouth\"47\n\nIn case they were wondering, Le Corbusier's potential bourgeois backers and\ntheir representatives could rest assured that his legible, geometric city\nwould facilitate police work. Where Haussmann managed to retrofit the baroque\ncity of absolutism, Le Corbusier proposed to clear the decks completely and\nreplace the center of Haussmann's city with one built with control and\nhierarchy in mind.48\n\n##### A Textbook Case of High-Modernist Architecture\n\nLe Corbusier's intellectual influence on architecture was out of all\nproportion to the actual structures he built. Not even the Soviet Union was\nquite up to his sweeping ambition. It is as an exemplar, a textbook case, of\nthe key elements of high-modernist planning-often exaggerated-that he belongs\nin this analysis. His commitment to what he called the \"total efficiency and\ntotal rationalization\" of a new machineage civilization was uncompromising.49\nAlthough he was obliged to deal with nation-states, his vision was universal.\nAs he put it, \"city planning everywhere, universal city planning, total city\nplanning\"10 His actual plans for Algiers, Paris, and Rio were, as we have\nseen, on a scale that was virtually without precedent. Le Corbusier was\ninfluenced, as were others of his generation, by the spectacle of total\nmilitary mobilization in World War I. \"Let's make our plans,\" he urged, \"plans\non a scale with twentieth century events, plans equally as big as Satan's\n[war].... Big! Big!\"\"\n\nThe visual, aesthetic component of his bold plans was central. Clean, smooth\nlines were something he associated with the \"all-business\" leanness of the\nmachine. He was positively lyrical about the beauty of the machine and its\nproducts. And houses, cities, and agrovilles could also \"emerge properly\nequipped, glitteringly new, from the factory, from the workshop, faultless\nproducts of smoothly humming machines.\"\"\n\nIntegral, finally, to Le Corbusier's ultramodernism was his repudiation of\ntradition, history, and received taste. After explaining the origin of the\ntraffic congestion in contemporary Paris, he warned against temptations to\nreform. \"We must refuse even the slightest consideration to what is: to the\nmess we are in now.\" He emphasized, \"There is no solution to be found here.\"\"\nInstead, he insisted, we must take a \"blank piece of paper,\" a \"clean\ntablecloth,\" and start new calculations from zero. It was in this context that\nhe was drawn to the USSR and to the ambitious rulers of developing countries.\nThere, he hoped, he would not be cramped by the \"grotesquely inadequate sites\"\navailable in the West, where it was possible to practice only what he called\nan \"orthopedic architecture\"54 The long-established cities of the West, their\ntraditions, their interest groups, their slow-moving institutions, and their\ncomplex legal and regulatory structures could only shackle the dreams of a\nhigh-modernist Gulliver.\n\n#### Brasilia: The High-Modernist City Built-Almost\n\nCities also believe they are the work of the mind or of chance, but neither\nthe one nor the other suffices to hold up their walls.\n\n-Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities\n\nNo utopian city gets built precisely as designed by its prophet-architect.\nJust as the scientific forester is foiled by the vagaries of unpredictable\nnature and by the divergent purposes of both his employers and those who have\naccess to the forest, so the urban planner must contend with the tastes and\nfinancial means of his patrons as well as the resistance of builders, workers,\nand residents. Even so, Brasilia is about the closest thing we have to a high-\nmodernist city, having been built more or less along the lines set out by Le\nCorbusier and c1AM. Thanks to an excellent book by James Holston, The\nModernist City: An Anthropological Critique of Brasilia,\" it is possible to\nanalyze both the logic of the plan for Brasilia and the extent of its\nrealization. An appreciation of the slippage between what Brasilia meant for\nits originators on one hand and for its residents on the other will in turn\npave the way (no pun intended) for Jane Jacob's thoroughgoing critique of\nmodern urban planning.\n\nThe idea of a new capital in the interior predates even the independence of\nBrazil.56 Its realization, however, was the pet project of Jus- celino\nKubitschek, the populist president from 1956 to 1961, who promised Brazilians\n\"fifty years of progress in five\" and a future of selfsustaining economic\ngrowth. In 1957 Oscar Niemeyer, who had already been named the chief architect\nfor public buildings and housing prototypes, organized a design competition\nthat was won, on the basis of very rough sketches, by Lucio Costa. Costa's\nidea-for it was no more than that-was of a \"monumental axis\" to define the\ncenter of the city, which consisted of terraced embankments describing an arc\nintersected in its center by a straight avenue, and of a triangle to define\nthe city's limits (figure 18).\n\nBoth architects were working within the doctrines of c1AM and Le Corbusier.\nNiemeyer, a longtime member of the Brazilian Communist Party, was also\ninfluenced by the Soviet version of architectural modernism. After the design\ncompetition, construction began almost immediately on an empty site on the\nCentral Plateau in the state of Goias, nearly 1000 kilometers from Rio de\nJaneiro and the coast and 1620 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean in the\nnortheast. It was indeed a new city in the wilderness. No \"orthopedic\"\ncompromises were necessary now that the planners had, thanks to Kubitschek,\nwho made Brasilia his top priority, a \"clean tablecloth.\" The state planning\nagency controlled all the land at the site, so there were no private-property\nowners with whom to negotiate. The city was then designed from the ground up,\naccording to an elaborate and unified plan. Housing, work, recreation,\ntraffic, and public administration were each spatially segregated as Le\nCorbusier would have insisted. Inasmuch as Brasilia was itself a single-\nfunction, strictly administrative capital, the planning itself was greatly\nsimplified.\n\n![](img0026.jpg)\n\n18\\. The Costa plan of 1957, showing A, the Plaza of the Three Powers; B, the\nministries; C, superquadra residential zones; D, the president's residence;\nand E, single-family housing\n\n##### Brasilia as the Negation (or Transcendence) of Brazil\n\nBrasilia was conceived of by Kubitschek and by Costa and Niemeyer as a city of\nthe future, a city of development, a realizable utopia. It made no reference\nto the habits, traditions, and practices of Brazil's past or of its great\ncities, Sao Paulo, Sao Salvador, and Rio de Janeiro. As if to emphasize the\npoint, Kubitschek called his own residence in Brasilia the Dawn Palace. \"What\nelse will Brasilia be,\" he asked, \"if not the dawn of a new day for Brazil?\"57\nLike the Saint Petersburg of Peter the Great, Brasilia was to be an exemplary\ncity, a center that would transform the lives of the Brazilians who lived\nthere-from their personal habits and household organization to their social\nlives, leisure, and work. The goal of making over Brazil and Brazilians\nnecessarily implied a disdain for what Brazil had been. In this sense, the\nwhole point of the new capital was to be a manifest contrast to the\ncorruption, backwardness, and ignorance of the old Brazil.\n\nThe great crossroads that was the plan's point of departure has been variously\ninterpreted as a symbol of Christ's cross or an Amazonian bow. Costa, however,\nreferred to it as a \"monumental axis,\" the same term that Le Corbusier used to\ndescribe the center of many of his urban plans. Even if the axis represented a\nsmall attempt to assimilate Brasilia in some way to its national tradition, it\nremained a city that could have been anywhere, that provided no clue to its\nown history, unless that history was the modernist doctrine of c1AM. It was a\nstate-imposed city invented to project a new Brazil to Brazilians and to the\nworld at large. And it was a state-imposed city in at least one other sense:\ninasmuch as it was created to be a city for civil servants, many aspects of\nlife that might otherwise have been left to the private sphere were minutely\norganized, from domestic and residential matters to health services,\neducation, child care, recreation, commercial outlets, and so forth.\n\nIf Brasilia was to be Brazil's urban future, what was Brazil's urban past and\npresent? What, precisely, was the new capital intended to negate? A large part\nof the answer can be inferred from Le Corbusier's second principle of the new\nurbanism: \"the death of the street.\" Brasilia was designed to eliminate the\nstreet and the square as places for public life. Although the elimination of\nlocal barrio loyalties and rivalries may not have been planned, they were also\na casualty of the new city.\n\nThe public square and the crowded \"corridor\" street had been venues of civic\nlife in urban Brazil since colonial days. As Holston explains, this civic life\ntook two forms. In the first, which had been sponsored by the church or state,\nceremonial or patriotic processions and rituals were typically held in the\nprincipal square of the town.5\" The second form encompassed a nearly\ninexhaustible range of popular uses of all the town squares. Children might\nplay there; adults might simply shop, stroll and run into acquaintances, meet\nfriends for a meal or coffee, play cards or chess, enjoy the social diversions\nof seeing and being seen. The point is that the square, as a confluence of\nstreets and a sharply enclosed, framed space, become what Holston aptly calls\na \"public visiting room.\"S`' As a public room, the square is distinguished by\nits accessibility to all social classes and the great variety of activities it\naccommodates. Barring state proscriptions, it is a flexible space that enables\nthose who use it to use it for their mutual purposes. The square or the busy\nstreet attracts a crowd precisely because it provides an animated scene-a\nscene in which thousands of unplanned, informal, improvised encounters can\ntake place simultaneously. The street was the spatial focus for public life\noutside the usually cramped family dwelling.60 The colloquialism for \"I'm\ngoing downtown\" was \"I'm going to the street.\" As the focus for sociability,\nthese spaces were also crucial sites for the development of public opinion as\nwell as for \"barrio nationalism,\" which could take institutional form in\nsports teams, bands, patron-saint celebrations, festival groups, and so on. It\ngoes without saying that the street or the public square, under the right\ncircumstances, could also become the site of public demonstrations and riots\ndirected against the state.\n\nA mere glance at the scenes of Brasilia, juxtaposed to the urban Brazil that\nwe have been describing, shows at once how radical is the transformation.\nThere are no streets in the sense of public gathering places; there are only\nroads and highways to be used exclusively by motorized traffic (compare\nfigures 19 and 20).\n\nThere is a square. But what a square! The vast, monumental Plaza of the Three\nPowers, flanked by the Esplanade of the Ministries, is of such a scale as to\ndwarf even a military parade (compare figures 21 and 22, and figures 23 and\n24). In comparison, Tiananmen Square and the Red Square are positively cozy\nand intimate. The plaza is best seen, as are many of Le Corbusier's plans,\nfrom the air (as in figure 24). If one were to arrange to meet a friend there,\nit would be rather like trying to meet someone in the middle of the Gobi\ndesert. And if one did meet up with one's friend, there would be nothing to\ndo. Functional simplification demands that the rationale for the square as a\npublic visiting room be designed out of Brasilia. This plaza is a symbolic\ncenter for the state; the only activity that goes on around it is the work of\nthe ministries. Whereas the vitality of the older square depended on the mix\nof residence, commerce, and administration in its catchment area, those who\nwork in the ministries must drive to their residences and then again to the\nseparate commercial centers of each residential area.\n\nOne striking result of Brasilia's cityscape is that virtually all the public\nspaces in the city are officially designated public spaces: the stadium, the\ntheater, the concert hall, the planned restaurants. The smaller, unstructured,\ninformal public spaces-sidewalk cafes, street corners, small parks,\nneighborhood squares-do not exist. Paradoxically, a great deal of nominally\nopen space characterizes this city, as it does Le Corbusier's city plans. But\nthat space tends to be \"dead\" space, as in the Plaza of the Three Powers.\nHolston explains this by showing how CLAM doctrines create sculptural masses\nwidely separated by large voids, an inversion of the \"figure-ground\" relations\nin older cities. Given our perceptual habits, these voids in the modernist\ncity seem to be not inviting public spaces but boundless, empty spaces that\nare avoided.61 One could fairly say that the effect of the plan was to design\nout all those unauthorized locations where casual encounters could occur and\ncrowds could gather spontaneously. The dispersal and functional segregation\nmeant that meeting someone virtually required a plan.\n\n![](img0027.jpg)\n\n19\\.

They believed that they were also banishing crowded slums,\nwith their darkness, disease, crime, pollution, traffic jams and noise, and\nlack of public services. There were definite advantages to beginning with an\nempty, bulldozed site belonging to the state. At least the problems of land\nspeculation, rent gouging, and property-based inequalities that beset most\nplanners could be circumvented. As with Le Corbusier and Haussmann, there was\nan emancipating vision here. The best and most current architectural knowledge\nabout sanitation, education, health, and recreation could be made part of the\ndesign. Twenty-five square meters of green space per resident reached the\nUNESCO-designed ideal. And as with any utopian plan, the design of Brasilia\nreflected the social and political commitments of the builders and their\npatron, Kubitschek. All residents would have similar housing; the sole\ndifference would be the number of units they were allotted. Following the\nplans of progressive European and Soviet architects, the planners of Brasilia\ngrouped the apartment buildings into what were called superquadra in order to\nfacilitate the development of a collective life. Each superquadra (roughly 360\napartments housing 1,500-2,500 residents) had its own nursery and elementary\nschool; each grouping of four superquadra had a secondary school, a cinema, a\nsocial club, sports facilities, and a retail sector.\n\nVirtually all the needs of Brasilia's future residents were reflected in the\nplan. It is just that these needs were the same abstract, schematic needs that\nproduced the formulas for Le Corbusier's plans. Although it was surely a\nrational, healthy, rather egalitarian, state-created city, its plans made not\nthe slightest concession to the desires, history, and practices of its\nresidents. In some important respects, Brasilia is to Sao Paulo or Rio as\nscientific forestry is to the unplanned forest. Both plans are highly legible,\nplanned simplifications devised to create an efficient order that can be\nmonitored and directed from above. Both plans, as we shall see, miscarry in\ncomparable respects. Finally, both plans change the city and the woods to\nconform to the simple grid of the planner.\n\n##### Living in Brasilia\n\nMost of those who have moved to Brasilia from other cities are amazed to\ndiscover \"that it is a city without crowds.\" People complain that Brasilia\nlacks the bustle of street life, that it has none of the busy street corners\nand long stretches of storefront facades that animate a sidewalk for\npedestrians. For them, it is almost as if the founders of Brasilia, rather\nthan having planned a city, have actually planned to prevent a city. The most\ncommon way they put it is to say that Brasilia \"lacks street corners,\" by\nwhich they mean that it lacks the complex intersections of dense neighborhoods\ncomprising residences and public cafes and restaurants with places for\nleisure, work, and shopping. While Brasilia provides well for some human\nneeds, the functional separation of work from residence and of both from\ncommerce and entertainment, the great voids between superquadra, and a road\nsystem devoted exclusively to motorized traffic make the disappearance of the\nstreet corner a foregone conclusion. The plan did eliminate traffic jams; it\nalso eliminated the welcome and familiar pedestrian jams that one of Holston's\ninformants called \"the point of social conviviality.\"61\n\nThe term brasilite, meaning roughly Brasil(ia)-itis, which was coined by the\nfirst-generation residents, nicely captures the trauma they expe- rienced.63\nAs a mock clinical condition, it connotes a rejection of the standardization\nand anonymity of life in Brasilia. \"They use the term brasilite to refer to\ntheir feelings about a daily life without the pleasures-the distractions,\nconversations, flirtations, and little ritualsof outdoor life in other\nBrazilian cities :'64 Meeting someone normally requires seeing them either at\ntheir apartment or at work. Even if we allow for the initial simplifying\npremise of Brasilia's being an administrative city, there is nonetheless a\nbland anonymity built into the very structure of the capital. The population\nsimply lacks the small accessible spaces that they could colonize and stamp\nwith the character of their activity, as they have done historically in Rio\nand Sao Paulo. To be sure, the inhabitants of Brasilia haven't had much time\nto modify the city through their practices, but the city is designed to be\nfairly recalcitrant to their efforts.61\n\n\"Brasilite,\" as a term, also underscores how the built environment affects\nthose who dwell in it. Compared to life in Rio and Sao Paulo, with their color\nand variety, the daily round in bland, repetitive, austere Brasilia must have\nresembled life in a sensory deprivation tank. The recipe for high-modernist\nurban planning, while it may have created formal order and functional\nsegregation, did so at the cost of a sensorily impoverished and monotonous\nenvironment-an environment that inevitably took its toll on the spirits of its\nresidents.\n\nThe anonymity induced by Brasilia is evident from the scale and exterior of\nthe apartments that typically make up each residential superquadra (compare\nfigures 25 and 26). For superquadra residents, the two most frequent\ncomplaints are the sameness of the apartment blocks and the isolation of the\nresidences (\"In Brasilia, there is only house and work\").66 The facade of each\nblock is strictly geometric and egalitarian. Nothing distinguishes the\nexterior of one apartment from another; there are not even balconies that\nwould allow residents to add distinctive touches and create semipublic spaces.\nPart of the disorientation arises from the fact that apartment dwelling-\nespecially, perhaps, this form of apartment dwelling-fails to accord with\ndeeply embedded conceptions of home. Holston asked a class of nine-yearold\nchildren, most of whom lived in superquadra, to draw a picture of \"home.\" Not\none drew an apartment building of any kind. All drew, instead, a traditional\nfreestanding house with windows, a central door, and a pitched roof.67 The\nsuperquadra blocks, by contrast, resist the stamp of individuality, while the\nglass walls on their exteriors infringe on the sense of private space in the\nhome.68 Concerned with the overall aesthetic of the plan, the architects\nerased not only the external display of status distinctions but also much of\nthe visual play of difference. Just as the general design of the city\nmilitates against an autonomous public life, so the design of the residential\ncity militates against individuality.\n\nThe disorienting quality of Brasilia is exacerbated by architectural\nrepetition and uniformity. Here is a case where what seems like rationality\nand legibility to those working in administration and urban services seems\nlike mystifying disorder for the ordinary residents who must navigate the\ncity. Brasilia has few landmarks. Each commercial quarter or superquadra\ncluster looks roughly like any other. The sectors of the city are designated\nby an elaborate set of acronyms and abbreviations that are nearly impossible\nto master, except from the global logic of the center. Holston notes the irony\nbetween macro-order and micro-confusion: \"Thus, while the topologies of total\norder produce an unusual, abstract awareness of the plan, practical knowledge\nof the city actually decreases with the imposition of systematic\nrationality.\"69 From the perspective of the planners of a utopian city, whose\ngoal is more to change the world than to accommodate it, however, the shock\nand disorientation occasioned by life in Brasilia may be part of its didactic\npurpose. A city that merely pandered to existing tastes and habits would not\nbe doing its utopian job.\n\n##### Unplanned Brasilia\n\nFrom the beginning, Brasilia failed to go precisely as planned. Its master\nbuilders were designing for a new Brazil and for new Brazil ians-orderly,\nmodern, efficient, and under their discipline. They were thwarted by\ncontemporary Brazilians with different interests and the determination to have\nthem heard. Somehow, it was assumed that the huge workforce (more than sixty\nthousand strong) would respond to the call to build the city and then quietly\nleave it to the administrators for whom it was intended. The construction\nworkers, moreover, had not been adequately planned for. Kubitschek accorded\ntop priority to finishing Brasilia as quickly as possible. Although most\nconstruction laborers routinely worked overtime, the population at the\nbuilding site quickly outstripped the temporary housing allotted to them in\nwhat was called the Free City. They soon squatted on additional land on which\nthey built makeshift houses; in cases where whole families migrated to\nBrasilia (or farmed there), the houses they erected were sometimes quite\nsubstantial.\n\n![](img0033.jpg)\n\n25\\. Residential area along Rua Tiradentes in Ouro Preto, 1980\n\n![](img0034.jpg)\n\n26\\. A superquadra apartment block in Brasilia, 1980\n\nThe \"pioneers\" of Brasilia were collectively called \"bandeirantes of the\ntwentieth century,\" after the adventurers who had first penetrated the\ninterior. The label was intended as a compliment, inasmuch as Ku- bitschek's\nBrasilia was also a symbolic conquest of the interior in a nation that had\nhistorically clung to the shoreline. At the outset, however, the manual\nlaborers attracted to Brasilia were derogatorily called candangos. A candango\nwas \"a man without qualities, without culture, a vagabond, lower-class,\nlowbrow.\"70 Kubitschek changed that. He used the building of Brasilia, which\nwas, after all, devised to transform Brazil, in order to transform the\ncandangos into the proletarian heroes of the new nation. \"Future interpreters\nof Brazilian Civilization,\" he declared, \"must dwell with astonishment before\nthe bronzed rigors of this anonymous titan, who is the candango, the obscure\nand formidable hero of the construction of Brasilia.... While the skeptics\nlaughed at the intended utopia of the new city that I prepared to build, the\ncandangos shouldered the responsibility.\"71 Taking full advantage of the\nrhetorical space thus provided them, the candangos insisted on having their\nown patch of the utopian city. They organized to defend their land, to demand\nurban services, and to be given secure title. In the end, by 1980, 75 percent\nof the population of Brasilia lived in settlements that had never been\nanticipated, while the planned city had reached less than half of its\nprojected population of 557,000. The foothold the poor gained in Brasilia was\nnot just a result of the beneficence of Kubitschek and his wife, Dona Sara.\nPolitical structure played a key role as well. Squatters were able to\nmobilize, protest, and be heard by virtue of a reasonably competitive\npolitical system. Neither Kubitschek nor other politicians could possibly\nignore the opportunity to cultivate a political clientele who might vote as a\nbloc.\n\nThe unplanned Brasilia-that is, the real, existing Brasilia-was quite\ndifferent from the original vision. Instead of a classless administrative\ncity, it was a city marked by stark spatial segregation according to social\nclass. The poor lived on the periphery and commuted long distances to the\ncenter, where much of the elite lived and worked. Many of the rich also\ncreated their own settlements with individual houses and private clubs,\nthereby replicating the affluent lifestyles found elsewhere in Brazil. The\nunplanned Brasilias-that of the rich and that of the poor-were not merely a\nfootnote or an accident; one could say that the cost of this kind of order and\nlegibility at the center of the plan virtually required that it be sustained\nby an unplanned Brasilia at the margins. The two Brasilias were not just\ndifferent; they were symbiotic.\n\nRadically transforming an entire nation of Brazil's size and diversity-let\nalone in only five years-was all but inconceivable. One senses that\nKubitschek, like many rulers with great ambitions for their countries,\ndespaired of a direct assault on all Brazil and all Brazilians and turned to\nthe more plausible task of creating from zero a utopian model. Raised on a new\nsite, in a new place, the city would provide a transforming physical\nenvironment for its new residents-an environment minutely tailored to the\nlatest dictates regarding health, efficiency, and rational order. As the\nprogressive city would evolve from a unitary, integrated plan on land owned\nentirely by the state, with all contracts, commercial licenses, and zoning in\nthe hands of the planning agency (Novacap), the conditions seemed favorable\nfor a successful \"utopian miniaturization.\"\n\nHow successful was Brasilia as a high-modernist, utopian space? If we judge it\nby the degree to which it departs from cities in older, urban Brazil, then its\nsuccess was considerable. If we judge it by its capacity either to transform\nthe rest of Brazil or to inspire a love of the new way of life, then its\nsuccess was minimal. The real Brasilia, as opposed to the hypothetical\nBrasilia in the planning documents, was greatly marked by resistance,\nsubversion, and political calculation.\n\n#### Le Corbusier at Chandigarh\n\nSince Le Corbusier did not design Brasilia, it may seem like guilt by\nassociation to blame him for its manifest failings. Two considerations,\nhowever, justify the connection. The first is that Brasilia was faithfully\nbuilt according to c1AM doctrines elaborated mostly by Le Corbusier. Second,\nLe Corbusier did in fact play a major role in designing another capital city\nthat reflected precisely the human problems encountered in Brasilia.\n\n![](img0035.jpg)\n\n27\\. The chowk, or piazza, that Le Corbusier designed for Chandigarh's city\ncenter\n\nChandigarh, the new capital of the Punjab, was half planned when the architect\nin charge, Matthew Nowicki, suddenly died.72 Nehru, in search of a successor,\ninvited Le Corbusier to finish the design and supervise the construction. The\nchoice was in keeping with Nehru's own high-modernist purpose: namely, the\npromotion of modern technology in a new capital that would dramatize the\nvalues that the new Indian elite wished to convey.73 Le Corbusier's\nmodifications of Nowicki's and Albert Mayer's original plan were all in the\ndirection of monumentalism and linearity. In place of large curves, Le\nCorbusier substituted rectilinear axes. At the center of the capital, he\ninserted a huge monumental axis not unlike those in Brasilia and in his plan\nfor Paris.74 In place of crowded bazaars cramming as many goods and people as\npossible into small spaces, he substituted huge squares that today stand\nlargely empty (figure 27).\n\nWhereas road crossings in India had typically served as public gathering\nplaces, Le Corbusier shifted the scale and arranged the zoning in order to\nprevent animated street scenes from developing. Notes one recent observer: \"On\nthe ground, the scale is so large and the width between meeting streets so\ngreat that one sees nothing but vast stretches of concrete paving with a few\nlone figures here and there. The small-scale street trader, the hawker or the\nrehris (barrows) have been banned from the city center, so that even where\nsources of interest and activity could be included, if only to reduce the\nconcreted barrenness and authority of the chowk, these are not utilized.\"75\n\nAs in Brasilia, the effort was to transcend India as it existed and to present\nChandigarh's citizens-largely administrators-with an image of their own\nfuture. As in Brasilia, the upshot was another unplanned city at the periphery\nand the margins, one that contradicted the austere order at the center.\n\n#### The Case Against High-Modernist Urbanism: Jane Jacobs\n\nJane Jacobs's book The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in\n1961 against a high tide of modernist, functional urban planning. Hers was by\nno means the first criticism of high-modernist urbanism, but it was, I\nbelieve, the most carefully observed and intellectually grounded critique.76\nAs the most comprehensive challenge to contemporary doctrines of urban\nplanning, it sparked a debate, the reverberations of which are still being\nfelt. The result, some three decades later, has been that many of Jacobs's\nviews have been incorporated into the working assumptions of today's urban\nplanners. Although what she called her \"attack on current city planning and\nrebuilding\" was concerned primarily with American cities, she located Le\nCorbusier's doctrines, as applied abroad and at home, at the center of her\nfield of fire.\n\nWhat is remarkable and telling about Jacobs's critique is its unique\nperspective. She begins at street level, with an ethnography of microorder in\nneighborhoods, sidewalks, and intersections. Where Le Corbusier \"sees\" his\ncity initially from the air, Jacobs sees her city as a pedestrian on her daily\nrounds would. Jacobs was also a political activist involved in many campaigns\nagainst proposals for zoning changes, road building, and housing development\nthat she thought ill-advised.17 It was all but inconceivable that a radical\ncritique, grounded in this fashion, could ever have originated from within the\nintellectual circle of urban planners.78 Her novel brand of everyday urban\nsociology applied to the design of cities was simply too far removed from the\northodox educational routines of urban planning schools at the time.79 An\nexamination of her critique from the margins serves to underline many of the\nfailings of high modernism.\n\n##### Visual Order Versus Experienced Order\n\nA formative insight in Jacobs's argument is that there is no necessary\ncorrespondence between the tidy look of geometric order on one hand and\nsystems that effectively meet daily needs on the other. Why should we expect,\nshe asks, that well-functioning built environments or social arrangements will\nsatisfy purely visual notions of order and regularity? To illustrate the\nconundrum, she refers to a new housing project in East Harlem that sported,\nconspicuously, a rectangular lawn. The lawn was the object of general contempt\nby the residents. It was even taken as an insult by those who had been\nforcibly relocated and now lived in a project among strangers where it was\nimpossible to get a newspaper or a cup of coffee or to borrow fifty cents.80\nThe apparent order of the lawn seemed cruelly emblematic of a more keenly felt\ndisorder.\n\nA fundamental mistake that urban planners made, Jacobs claims, was to infer\nfunctional order from the duplication and regimentation of building forms:\nthat is, from purely visual order. Most complex systems, on the contrary, do\nnot display a surface regularity; their order must be sought at a deeper\nlevel. \"To see complex systems of functional order as order, and not as chaos,\ntakes understanding. The leaves dropping from the trees in the autumn, the\ninterior of an airplane engine, the entrails of a rabbit, the city desk of a\nnewspaper, all appear to be chaos if they are seen without comprehension. Once\nthey are seen as systems of order, they actually look different.\" At this\nlevel one could say that Jacobs was a \"functionalist,\" a word whose use was\nbanned in Le Corbusier's studio. She asked, What function does this structure\nserve, and how well does it serve it? The \"order\" of a thing is determined by\nthe purpose it serves, not by a purely aesthetic view of its surface order.R1\nLe Corbusier, by contrast, seemed to have firmly believed that the most\nefficient forms would always have a classical clarity and order. The physical\nenvironments Le Corbusier designed and built had, as did Brasilia, an overall\nharmony and simplicity of form. For the most part, however, they failed in\nimportant ways as places where people would want to live and work.\n\nIt was this failure of the general urban planning models that so preoccupied\nJacobs. The planners' conception of a city accorded neither with the actual\neconomic and social functions of an urban area nor with the (not unrelated)\nindividual needs of its inhabitants. Their most fundamental error was their\nentirely aesthetic view of order. This error drove them to the further error\nof rigidly segregating func tions. In their eyes, mixed uses of real estate-\nsay, stores intermingled with apartments, small workshops, restaurants, and\npublic buildings-created a kind of visual disorder and confusion. The great\nadvantage of single uses-one shopping area, one residential areawas that it\nmade possible the monofunctional uniformity and visual regimentation that they\nsought. As a planning exercise, it was of course vastly easier to plan an area\nzoned for a single use than one zoned for several. Minimizing the number of\nuses and hence the number of variables to be juggled thus combined with an\naesthetic of visual order to argue for a single-use doctrine.82 The metaphor\nthat comes to mind in this connection is that of an army drawn up on the\nparade ground as opposed to an army engaged in combat with the enemy. In the\nfirst case is a tidy visual order created by units and ranks drawn up in\nstraight lines. But it is an army doing nothing, an army on display. An army\nat war will not display the same orderly arrangement, but it will be, in\nJacobs's terms, an army doing what it was trained to do. Jacobs thinks she\nknows the roots of this penchant for abstract, geometric order from above:\n\"Indirectly through the utopian tradition, and directly through the more\nrealistic doctrine of art by imposition, modern city planning has been\nburdened from its beginnings with the unsuitable aim of converting cities into\ndisciplined works of art.\"83\n\nRecently, Jacobs notes, the statistical techniques and input-output models\navailable to planners had become far more sophisticated. They were encouraged\nto attempt such ambitious feats of planning as massive slum clearance now that\nthey could closely calculate the budget, materials, space, energy, and\ntransportation needs of a rebuilt area. These plans continued to ignore the\nsocial costs of moving families \"like grains of sand, or electrons, or\nbilliard balls.\"84 The plans were also based on notoriously shaky assumptions,\nand they treated systems of complex order as if they could be simplified by\nnumerical techniques, regarding shopping, for example, as a purely\nmathematical issue involving square footage for shopping space and traffic\nmanagement as an issue of moving a certain number of vehicles in a given time\nalong a certain number of streets of a given width. These were indeed\nformidable technical problems, but, as we shall see, the real issues involved\nmuch more besides.\n\n##### The Functional Superiority of Cross-Use and Complexity\n\nThe establishment and maintenance of social order in large cities are, as we\nhave increasingly learned, fragile achievements. Jacobs's view of social order\nis both subtle and instructive. Social order is not the result of the\narchitectural order created by T squares and slide rules. Nor is social order\nbrought about by such professionals as policemen, nightwatchmen, and public\nofficials. Instead, says Jacobs, \"the public peace-the sidewalk and street\npeace-of cities . . . is kept by an intricate, almost unconscious network of\nvoluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by\nthe people themselves.\" The necessary conditions for a safe street are a clear\ndemarcation between public space and private space, a substantial number of\npeople who are watching the street on and off (\"eyes on the street\"), and\nfairly continual, heavy use, which adds to the quantity of eyes on the\nstreet.\" Her example of an area where these conditions were met is Boston's\nNorth End. Its streets were thronged with pedestrians throughout the day owing\nto the density of convenience and grocery stores, bars, restaurants, bakeries,\nand other shops. It was a place where people came to shop and stroll and to\nwatch others shop and stroll. The shopkeepers had the most direct interest in\nwatching the sidewalk: they knew many people by name, they were there all day,\nand their businesses depended on the neighborhood traffic. Those who came and\nwent on errands or to eat or drink also provided eyes on the street, as did\nthe elderly who watched the passing scene from their apartment windows. Few of\nthese people were friends, but a good many were acquaintances who did\nrecognize one another. The process is powerfully cumulative. The more animated\nand busier the street, the more interesting it is to watch and observe; all\nthese unpaid observers who have some familiarity with the neighborhood provide\nwilling, informed surveillance.\n\nJacobs recounts a revealing incident that occurred on her mixeduse street in\nManhattan when an older man seemed to be trying to cajole an eight- or nine-\nyear-old girl to go with him. As Jacobs watched this from her second-floor\nwindow, wondering if she should intervene, the butcher's wife appeared on the\nsidewalk, as did the owner of the deli, two patrons of a bar, a fruit vendor,\nand a laundryman, and several other people watched openly from their tenement\nwindows, ready to frustrate a possible abduction. No \"peace officer\" appeared\nor was necessary.\"\n\nAnother instance of informal urban order and services is instructive. Jacobs\nexplains that when a friend used their apartment while she and her husband\nwere away or when they didn't want to wait up for a late-arriving visitor,\nthey would leave the key to their apartment with the deli owner, who had a\nspecial drawer for such keys and who held them for the friends.87 She noted\nthat every nearby mixed-use street had someone who played the same role: a\ngrocer, candy-store owner, barber, butcher, dry cleaner, or bookshop owner.\nThis is one of the many public functions of private business.88 These\nservices, Jacobs notes, are not the outgrowth of any deep friendship; they are\nthe result of people being on what she calls \"sidewalk terms\" with others. And\nthese are services that could not plausibly be provided by a public\ninstitution. Having no recourse to the face-to-face politics of personal\nreputation that underwrites social order in small rural communities, the city\nrelies on the density of people who are on sidewalk terms with one another to\nmaintain a modicum of public order. The web of familiarity and\nacquaintanceship enabled a host of crucial but often invisible public\namenities. A person didn't think twice about asking someone to hold one's seat\nat the theater, to watch a child while one goes to the restroom, or to keep an\neye on a bike while one ducks into a deli to buy a sandwich.\n\nJacobs's analysis is notable for its attention to the microsociology of public\norder. The agents of this order are all nonspecialists whose main business is\nsomething else. There are no formal public or voluntary organizations of urban\norder here-no police, no private guards or neighborhood watch, no formal\nmeetings or officeholders. Instead, the order is embedded in the logic of\ndaily practice. What's more, Jacobs argues, the formal public institutions of\norder function successfully only when they are undergirded by this rich,\ninformal public life. An urban space where the police are the sole agents of\norder is a very dangerous place. Jacobs admits that each of the small\nexchanges of informal public life-nodding hello, admiring a newborn baby,\nasking where someone's nice pears come from-can be seen as trivial. \"But the\nsum is not trivial at all,\" she insists. \"The sum of each casual, public\ncontact at a local level-most of it fortuitous, most of it associated with\nerrands, all of it metered by the person concerned and not thrust upon him by\nanyone-is a feeling for the public identity of people, a web of public respect\nand trust, and a resource in time of personal or neighborhood need. The\nabsence of this trust is a disaster to a city street. Its cultivation cannot\nbe institutionalized. And above all, it implies no private commitments.\"89\nWhere Le Corbusier began with formal, architectural order from above, Jacobs\nbegins with informal, social order from below.\n\nDiversity, cross-use, and complexity (both social and architectural) are\nJacobs's watchwords. The mingling of residences with shopping areas and\nworkplaces makes a neighborhood more interesting, more convenient, and more\ndesirable-qualities that draw the foot traffic that in turn makes the streets\nrelatively safe. The whole logic of her case depends on the creation of the\ncrowds, diversity, and conveniences that define a setting where people will\nwant to be. In addition, a high volume of foot traffic stimulated by an\nanimated and colorful neighborhood has economic effects on commerce and\nproperty values, which are hardly trivial. The popularity of a district and\nits economic success go hand in hand. Once created, such places will attract\nactivities that most planners would have specially sequestered elsewhere.\nRather than play in the large parks created for that purpose, many children\nprefer the sidewalks, which are safer, more eventful, and more convenient to\nthe comforts available in stores and at home.90 Understanding the magnetic\neffect of the busy street over more specialized settings is no more difficult\nthan understanding why the kitchen is typically the busiest room in a house.\nIt is the most versatile setting-a place of food and drink, of cooking and\neating, and hence of socialization and exchange.91\n\nWhat are the conditions of this diversity? That a district have mixed primary\nuses, Jacobs suggests, is the most vital factor. Streets and blocks should be\nshort in order to avoid creating long barriers to pedestrians and commerce.92\nBuildings should ideally be of greatly varying age and condition, thereby\nmaking possible different rental terms and the varied uses that accompany\nthem. Each of these conditions, not surprisingly, violates one or more of the\nworking assumptions of orthodox urban planners of the day: single-use\ndistricts, long streets, and architectural uniformity. Mixed primary uses,\nJacobs explains, are synergistic with diversity and density.\n\nTake, for example, a small restaurant in a single-use district-say, the\nfinancial district of Wall Street. Such a restaurant must make virtually all\nits profit between 10 A.M. and 3 P.M., the hours when office workers take\ntheir midmorning coffee breaks and lunch breaks before commuting home at the\nend of the day, leaving the street silent. The restaurant in a mixed-use\ndistrict, on the other hand, has potential clients passing by throughout the\nday and into the night. It may therefore stay open for more hours, benefiting\nnot only its own business but also that of nearby specialized shops, which\nmight be economically marginal in a single-use district but which become going\nconcerns in a lively mixed-use area. The very jumble of activities, buildings,\nand people-the apparent disorder that offended the aesthetic eye of the\nplanner-was for Jacobs the sign of dynamic vitality: \"Intricate minglings of\ndifferent uses are not a form of chaos. On the contrary they represent a\ncomplex and highly developed form of order.\"93\n\nWhile Jacobs makes a convincing case for mixed use and complexity by examining\nthe micro-origins of public safety, civic trust, visual interest, and\nconvenience, there is a larger argument to be made for cross-use and\ndiversity. Like the diverse old-growth forest, a richly differentiated\nneighborhood with many kinds of shops, entertainment centers, services,\nhousing options, and public spaces is, virtually by definition, a more\nresilient and durable neighborhood. Economically, the diversity of its\ncommercial \"bets\" (everything from funeral parlors and public services to\ngrocery stores and bars) makes it less vulnerable to economic downturns. At\nthe same time its diversity provides many opportunities for economic growth in\nupturns. Like monocropped forests, single-purpose districts, although they may\ninitially catch a boom, are especially susceptible to stress. The diverse\nneighborhood is more sustainable.\n\nI think that a \"woman's eye,\" for lack of a better term, was essential to\nJacobs's frame of reference. A good many men, to be sure, were insightful\ncritics of high-modernist urban planning, and Jacobs refers to many of their\nwritings. Nevertheless, it is difficult to imagine her argument being made in\nquite the same way by a man. Several elements of her critique reinforce this\nimpression. First, she experiences the city as far more than a setting for the\ndaily trek to and from work and the acquisition of goods and services. The\neyes with which she sees the street are, by turns, those of shoppers running\nerrands, mothers pushing baby carriages, children playing, friends having\ncoffee or a bite to eat, lovers strolling, people looking from their windows,\nshopkeepers dealing with customers, old people sitting on park benches.94 Work\nis not absent from her account, but her attention is riveted on the quotidian\nin the street as it appears around work and outside of work. A concern with\npublic space puts both the interior of the home and the office as factory\noutside her purview. The activities that she observes so carefully, from\ntaking a walk to window-shopping, are largely activities that do not have a\nsingle purpose or that have no conscious purpose in the narrow sense.\n\nCompare this perspective with most of the key elements in highmodernist urban\nplanning. Such plans all but require forms of simplification that strip human\nactivity to a sharply defined single purpose. In orthodox planning, such\nsimplifications underlie the strict functional segregation of work from\ndomicile and both from commerce. The matter of transportation becomes, for Le\nCorbusier and others, the single problem of how to transport people (usually\nin automobiles) as quickly and economically as possible. The activity of\nshopping becomes a question of providing adequate floor space and access for a\ncertain quantity of shoppers and goods. Even the category of entertainment was\nsplit up into specified activities and segregated into playgrounds, athletic\nfields, theaters, and so on.\n\nThus, the second result of Jacobs's having a woman's eye is her realization\nthat a great deal of human activity (including, by all means, work) is pursued\nfor a wide range of goals and satisfactions. An amiable lunch with co-workers\nmay be the most significant part of the day for a jobholder. Mothers pushing\nbaby carriages may also be talking to friends, doing errands, getting a bite\nto eat, and looking for a book at the local bookstore or library. In the\ncourse of these activities, still another \"purpose\" might arise, unbidden. The\nman or woman driving to work may not just be driving to work. He or she may\ncare about the scenery or companionship along the way and the availability of\ncoffee near the parking lot. Jacobs herself was an enormously gifted \"eye on\nthe street,\" and she wrote in full recognition of the great variety of human\npurposes embedded in any activity. The purpose of the city is to accommodate\nand abet this rich diversity and not to thwart it. And the persistent failure\nof urban-planning doctrines to do so, she suggested, had something to do with\ngender.\"\n\n##### Authoritarian Planning as Urban Taxidermy\n\nFor Jacobs, the city as a social organism is a living structure that is\nconstantly changing and springing surprises. Its interconnections are so\ncomplex and dimly understood that planning always risks unknowingly cutting\ninto its living tissue, thereby damaging or killing vital social processes.\nShe contrasts the \"art\" of the planner to the practical conduct of daily life:\nA city cannot be a work of art.... In relation to the inclusiveness and\nliterally endless intricacy of life, art is arbitrary, symbolic, and\nabstracted. That is its value and the source of its own kind of order and\ncoherence.... The results of such profound confusion between art and life are\nneither life nor art. They are taxidermy. In its place, taxidermy can be a\nuseful and decent craft. However, it goes too far when the specimens put on\ndisplay are exhibitions of dead, stuffed cities.\"\"' The core of Jacobs case\nagainst modern city planning was that it placed a static grid over this\nprofusion of unknowable possibilities. She condemned Ebenezer Howard's vision\nof the garden city because its planned segregation presumed that farmers,\nfactory workers, and businessmen would remain fixed and distinct castes. Such\na presumption failed to respect or provide for the \"spontaneous self-\ndiversification\" and fluidity that were the main features of the nineteenth-\ncentury city.\"\n\nUrban planners' great penchant for massive schemes of slum clearance was\nattacked on the same grounds. Slums were the first foothold of poor migrants\nto the city. As long as these areas were reasonably stable, the economy\nrelatively strong, and people and businesses not starved for credit, the slums\ncould, given time, manage to \"unslum\" themselves. Many already had. Planners\nfrequently destroyed \"unslum- ming slums\" because these areas violated their\ndoctrines of \"layout, use, ground coverage, mixture and activities \"v8-not to\nmention the land speculation and security concerns behind much \"urban\nrenewal.\"\n\nFrom time to time Jacobs stands back from the infinite and changing variety of\nAmerican cities to express a certain awe and humility: \"Their intricate\norder-a manifestation of the freedom of countless numbers of people to make\nand carry out countless plans-is in many ways a great wonder. We ought not to\nbe reluctant to make this living collection of interdependent uses, this\nfreedom, this life, more understandable for what it is, nor so unaware that we\ndo not know what it is.\"99 The magisterial assumption behind the doctrines of\nmany urban planners-that they know what people want and how people should\nspend their time-seems to Jacobs shortsighted and arrogant. They assumed, or\nat least their plans assumed, that people preferred open spaces, visual\n(zoned) order, and quiet. They assumed that people wanted to live in one place\nand work in another. Jacobs believes they were mistaken, and most important,\nshe is prepared to argue from close daily observation at street level rather\nthan stipulating human wishes from above.\n\nThe logic behind the spatial segregation and single-use zoning of the urban\nplanners that Jacobs criticized was at once aesthetic, scientific, and\npractical. As an aesthetic matter, it led to the visual regularityeven\nregimentation-that a sculptural view of the ensemble required. As a scientific\nmatter it reduced the number of unknowns for which the planner had to find a\nsolution. Like simultaneous equations in algebra, too many unknowns in urban\nplanning rendered any solution problematic or else required heroic\nassumptions. The problem the planner faced was analogous to that of the\nforester. One modern solution to the forester's dilemma was to borrow a\nmanagement technique called optimum control theory, whereby the sustained\ntimber yield could be successfully predicted by few observations and a\nparsimonious formula. It goes without saying that optimum control theory was\nsimplest where more variables could be turned into constants. Thus a\nsinglespecies, same-age forest planted in straight lines on a flat plain with\nconsistent soil and moisture profiles yielded simpler and more accu rate\noptimum control formulas. Compared to uniformity, diversity is always more\ndifficult to design, build, and control. When Ebenezer Howard approached town\nplanning as a simple, two-variable problem of relating housing needs to the\nquantity of jobs in a closed system, he was both temporally and functionally\noperating \"scientifically\" within those self-imposed limits. Formulas for\ngreen space, light, schools, and square meters per capita did the rest.\n\nIn urban planning as in forestry, it is a short step from parsimonious\nassumptions to the practice of shaping the environment so that it satisfies\nthe simplifications required by the formula. The logic of planning for the\nshopping needs of a given population serves as an example. Once planners\napplied the formula for a certain number of square feet of commercial space,\nparceled out among such categories as food and clothing, they realized that\nthey would then have to make these shopping centers monopolistic within their\nareas, lest nearby competitors draw away their clientele. The whole point was\nto legislate the formula, thereby guaranteeing the shopping center a monopoly\nof its catchment area.100 Rigid, single-use zoning is, then, not just an\naesthetic measure. It is an indispensable aid to scientific planning, and it\ncan also be used to transform formulas posing as observations into self-\nfulfilling prophesies.\n\nThe radically simplified city, provided it is viewed from above, is also\npractical and efficient. The organization of services-electricity, water,\nsewage, mail-is simplified both below and above ground. Single-use districts,\nby virtue of the repetition of functionally similar apartments or offices, are\nsimpler to produce and build. Le Corbusier looked forward to a future when all\nthe components of such buildings would be industrially prefabricated. 101\nZoning along these lines also produces a city that is, district by district,\nboth more uniform aesthetically and more \"orderly\" functionally. A single\nactivity or narrow band of activities is appropriate to each district: work in\nthe business district, family life in the residential quarter, shopping and\nentertainment in the commercial district. As a police matter, this functional\nsegregation minimizes unruly crowds and introduces as much regimentation into\nthe movement and conduct of the population as physical planning alone can\nencourage.\n\nOnce the desire for comprehensive urban planning is established, the logic of\nuniformity and regimentation is well-nigh inexorable. Cost effectiveness\ncontributes to this tendency. Just as it saves a prison trouble and money if\nall prisoners wear uniforms of the same material, color, and size, every\nconcession to diversity is likely to entail a corre sponding increase in\nadministrative time and budgetary cost. If the planning authority does not\nneed to make concessions to popular desires, the one-size-fits-all solution is\nlikely to prevail. 102\n\nAgainst the planners' eye and formulas, Jacobs juxtaposes her own. Her\naesthetic, she would claim, is pragmatic and street level, an aesthetic that\nhas as its reference the experienced working order of the city for the people\nwho live there. She asks, What physical environments draw people, facilitate\ncirculation, promote social exchange and contact, and satisfy both utilitarian\nand nonutilitarian needs? This perspective leads her to many judgments. Short\nblocks are preferable to long blocks because they knit together more\nactivities. Large truck depots or filling stations that break the continuity\nof pedestrian interest are to be avoided. To be kept to a minimum are huge\nroads and vast, forbidding open spaces that operate as visual and physical\nbarriers. There is a logic here, but it is not an a priori visual logic, nor\nis it a purely utilitarian logic narrowly conceived. Rather, it is a standard\nof evaluation that springs from how satisfactorily a given arrangement meets\nthe social and practical desires of urban dwellers as those needs are revealed\nin their actual activity.\n\n##### Planning for the Unplanned\n\nThe historic diversity of the city-the source of its value and magnetism-is an\nunplanned creation of many hands and long historical practice. Most cities are\nthe outcome, the vector sum, of innumerable small acts bearing no discernible\noverall intention. Despite the best efforts of monarchs, planning bodies, and\ncapitalist speculators, \"most city diversity is the creation of incredible\nnumbers of different people and different private organizations, with vastly\ndifferent ideas and purposes, planning and contriving outside the formal\nframework of public action.\" 103 Le Corbusier would have agreed with this\ndescription of the existing city, and it was precisely what appalled him. It\nwas just this cacophony of intentions that was responsible for the clutter,\nugliness, disorder, and inefficiencies of the unplanned city. Looking at the\nsame social and historical facts, Jacobs sees reason to praise them: \"Cities\nhave the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and\nonly when, they are created by everybody.\" 104 She is no freemarket\nlibertarian, however; she understands clearly that capitalists and speculators\nare, willy-nilly, transforming the city with their commercial muscle and\npolitical influence. But when it comes to urban public policy, she thinks\nplanning ought not to usurp this unplanned city: \"The main responsibility of\ncity planning and design should be to develop, insofar as public policy and\naction can do so, cities that are congenial places for this great range of\nunofficial plans, ideas, and opportunities to flourish.\"10S Whereas Le\nCorbusier's planner is concerned with the overall form of the cityscape and\nits efficiency in moving people from point to point, Jacobs's planner\nconsciously makes room for the unexpected, small, informal, and even\nnonproductive human activities that constitute the vitality of the \"lived\ncity.\"\n\nJacobs is more aware than most urban planners of the ecological and market\nforces continually transforming the city. The succession of harbors,\nrailroads, and highways as means of moving people and goods had already marked\nthe rise and decline of sections of the city. Even the successful, animated\nneighborhoods that Jacobs so prizes were, she recognizes, becoming victims of\ntheir own success. Areas were \"colonized\" by urban migrants because land\nvalues, and hence rents, were cheap. As an area became more desirable to live\nin, its rents rose and its local commerce changed, the new businesses often\ndriving out the original pioneers who had helped transform it. The nature of\nthe city was flux and change; a successful neighborhood could not be frozen\nand preserved by the planners. A city that was extensively planned would\ninevitably diminish much of the diversity that is the hallmark of great towns.\nThe best a planner can hope for is to modestly enhance rather than impede the\ndevelopment of urban complexity.\n\nFor Jacobs, how a city develops is something like how a language evolves. A\nlanguage is the joint historical creation of millions of speakers. Although\nall speakers have some effect on the trajectory of a language, the process is\nnot particularly egalitarian. Linguists, grammarians, and educators, some of\nthem backed by the power of the state, weigh in heavily. But the process is\nnot particularly amenable to a dictatorship, either. Despite the efforts\ntoward \"central planning,\" language (especially its everyday spoken form)\nstubbornly tends to go on its own rich, multivalent, colorful way. Similarly,\ndespite the attempts by urban planners toward designing and stablizing the\ncity, it escapes their grasp; it is always being reinvented and inflected by\nits inhabitants. 106 For both a large city and a rich language, this openness,\nplasticity, and diversity allow them to serve an endless variety of purposes-\nmany of which have yet to be conceived.\n\nThe analogy can be pressed further. Like planned cities, planned languages are\nindeed possible. Esperanto is one example; technical and scientific languages\nare another, and they are quite precise and powerful means of expression\nwithin the limited purposes for which they were designed. But language per se\nis not for only one or two purposes. It is a general tool that can be bent to\ncountless ends by virtue of its adaptability and flexibility. The very history\nof an inherited language helps to provide the range of associations and\nmeanings that sustain its plasticity. In much the same way, one could plan a\ncity from zero. But since no individual or committee could ever completely\nencompass the purposes and lifeways, both present and future, that animate its\nresidents, it would necessarily be a thin and pale version of a complex city\nwith its own history. It will be a Brasilia, Saint Petersburg, or Chandigarh\nrather than a Rio de Janeiro, Moscow, or Calcutta. Only time and the work of\nmillions of its residents can turn these thin cities into thick cities. The\ngrave shortcoming of a planned city is that it not only fails to respect the\nautonomous purposes and subjectivity of those who live in it but also fails to\nallow sufficiently for the contingency of the interaction between its\ninhabitants and what that produces.\n\nJacobs has a kind of informed respect for the novel forms of social order that\nemerge in many city neighborhoods. This respect is reflected in her attention\nto the mundane but meaningful human connections in a functioning neighborhood.\nWhile recognizing that no urban neighborhood can ever be, or should be,\nstatic, she stresses the minimal degree of continuity, social networks, and\n\"street-terms\" acquaintanceship required to knit together an urban locality.\n\"If selfgovernment in the place is to work,\" she muses, \"underlying any float\nof population must be a continuity of people who have forged neighborhood\nnetworks. These networks are a city's irreplaceable social capital. Whenever\nthe capital is lost, from whatever cause, the [social] income from it\ndisappears, never to return until and unless new capital is slowly and\nchancily accumulated.\" 107 It follows from this vantage point that even in the\ncase of slums, Jacobs was implacably opposed to the wholesale slum-clearance\nprojects that were so much in vogue when she was writing. The slum might not\nhave much social capital, but what it did have was something to build on, not\ndestroy.101 What keeps Jacobs from becoming a Burkean conservative,\ncelebrating whatever history has thrown up, is her emphasis on change,\nrenewal, and invention. To try to arrest this change (although one might try\nto modestly influence it) would be not only unwise but futile.\n\nStrong neighborhoods, like strong cities, are the product of complex processes\nthat cannot be replicated from above. Jacobs quotes with approval Stanley\nTankel, a planner who made the rarely heard case against large-scale slum\nclearance in these terms: \"The next step will require great humility, since we\nare now so prone to confuse great building projects with great social\nachievements. We will have to admit that it is beyond the scope of anyone's\nimagination to create a community. We must learn to cherish the communities we\nhave, they are hard to come by. 'Fix the buildings, but leave the people.' 'No\nrelocation outside the neighborhood.' These must be the slogans if public\nhousing is to be popular.\"1°9 In fact, the political logic of Jacobs's case is\nthat while the planner cannot create a functioning community, a functioning\ncommunity can, within limits, improve its own condition. Standing the planning\nlogic on its head, she explains how a reasonably strong neighborhood can, in a\ndemocratic setting, fight to create and maintain good schools, useful parks,\nvital urban services, and decent housing.\n\nJane Jacobs was writing against the major figures still dominating the urban\nplanning landscape of her day: Ebenezer Howard and Le Corbusier. To some of\nher critics she has seemed a rather conservative figure, extolling the virtues\nof community in poor neighborhoods that many were anxious to leave and\nignoring the degree to which the city was already being \"planned,\" not by\npopular initiative or by the state but by developers and financiers with\npolitical connections. There is some justice to these points of view. For our\npurposes, however, there is little doubt that she has put her finger on the\ncentral flaws of hubris in high-modernist urban planning. The first flaw is\nthe presumption that planners can safely make most of the predictions about\nthe future that their schemes require. We know enough by now to be\nexceptionally skeptical about forecasting from current trends in fertility\nrates, urban migration, or the structure of employment and income. Such\npredictions have often been wildly wrong. As for wars, oil embargoes, weather,\nconsumer tastes, and political eruptions, our capacity for prediction is\npractically nil. Second, thanks in part to Jacobs, we now know more about what\nconstitutes a satisfactory neighborhood for the people who live in it, but we\nstill know precious little about how such communities can be fostered and\nmaintained. Working from formulas about density, green space, and\ntransportation may produce narrowly efficient outcomes, but it is unlikely to\nresult in a desirable place to live. Brasilia and Chandigarh, at a minimum,\ndemonstrate this.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that many of the high-modernist cities actually built-\nBrasilia, Canberra, Saint Petersburg, Islamabad, Chandigarh, Abuja, Dodoma,\nCiudad Guayana\"0-have been administrative capitals. Here at the center of\nstate power, in a completely new setting, with a population consisting largely\nof state employees who have to reside there, the state can virtually stipulate\nthe success of its planning grid. The fact that the business of the city is\nstate administration already vastly simplifies the task of planning.\nAuthorities do not have to contend, as did Haussmann, with preexisting\ncommercial and cultural centers. And because the authorities control the\ninstruments of zoning, employment, housing, wage levels, and physical layout,\nthey can bend the environment to the city. These urban planners backed by\nstate power are rather like tailors who are not only free to invent whatever\nsuit of clothes they wish but also free to trim the customer so that he fits\nthe measure.\n\nUrban planners who reject \"taxidermy,\" Jacobs claims, must nevertheless invent\na kind of planning that encourages novel initiatives and contingencies,\nforeclosing as few options as possible, and that fosters the circulation and\ncontact out of which such initiatives arise. To illustrate the diversity of\nurban life, Jacobs lists more than a dozen uses which have been served over\nthe years by the center for the arts in Louisville: stable, school, theater,\nbar, athletic club, blacksmith's forge, factory, warehouse, artists' studio.\nShe then asks, rhetorically, \"Who could anticipate or provide for such a\nsuccession of hopes and services?\" Her answer is simple: \"Only an\nunimaginative man would think he could; only an arrogant man would want to.\"\nII '\n\n\n# 5 The Revolutionary Party:  \nA Plan and a Diagnosis\n\n![](img0036.jpg)\n\nFeeling, Comrade C, is a mass element, but thought is organization. Comrade\nLenin said that organization is the highest of all of us.\n\n-Andrei Platonov, Chevengur\n\nCommunism was modernity's most devout, vigorous and gallant champion.... It\nwas under communist ... auspices that the audacious dream of modernity, freed\nfrom obstacles by the merciless and omnipotent state, was pushed to its\nradical limits: grand designs, unlimited social engineering, huge and bulky\ntechnology, total transformation of nature.\n\n-Zygmunt Bauman, \"Living Without an Alternative\"\n\nLenin's design for the construction of the revolution was in many ways\ncomparable to Le Corbusier's design for the construction of the modern city.\nBoth were complex endeavors that had to be entrusted to the professionalism\nand scientific insight of a trained cadre with full power to see the plan\nthrough. And just as Le Corbusier and Lenin shared a broadly comparable high\nmodernism, so Jane Jacobs's perspective was shared by Rosa Luxemburg and\nAleksandra Kollontay, who opposed Lenin's politics. Jacobs doubted both the\npossibility and the desirability of the centrally planned city, and Luxemburg\nand Kollontay doubted the possibility and desirability of a revolution planned\nfrom above by the vanguard party.\n\n#### Lenin: Architect and Engineer of Revolution\n\nLenin, if we judge him from his major writings, was a convinced high\nmodernist. The broad lines of his thought were quite consistent; whether he\nwas writing about revolution, industrial planning, agricultural organization,\nor administration, he focused on a unitary scientific answer that was known to\na trained intelligentsia and that ought to be followed. The Lenin of practice\nwas, of course, something else again. His capacity for sensing the popular\nmood in fashioning Bolshevik propaganda, for beating a tactical retreat when\nit seemed prudent, and for striking boldly to seize the advantage was more\nrelevant than his high modernism to his success as a revolutionary. It is\nLenin as a high modernist, however, with whom we are primarily concerned.\n\nThe major text for the elaboration of Lenin's high-modernist views of\nrevolution is What Is to Be Done?' High modernism was integral to the central\npurpose of Lenin's argument: to convince the Russian left that only a small,\nselected, centralized, professional cadre of revolutionaries could bring about\na revolution in Russia. Written in 1903, well before the \"dress rehearsal\"\nrevolution of 1905, this view was never entirely abandoned, even under totally\ndifferent circumstances in 1917 between the February overthrow of the czar and\nthe Bolshevik seizure of power in October, when he wrote State and Revolution.\nI shall compare Lenin's view in these two works and in his writings on\nagriculture with Rosa Luxemburg's \"Mass-Strike, Party, and Trade Unions,\"\nwritten in reply to What Is to Be Done? and with the writings of Aleksandra\nKollontay, an important figure in what was called the Workers' Opposition, a\ngroup within the Bolshevik party who criticized many of Lenin's policies after\nthe revolution.\n\n##### The Lenin of What Is to Be Done?\n\nLenin's choice of the title What Is to Be Done? has great significance. It was\nalso the title of an exceptionally popular novel by Nicholas Chernyshevsky, in\nwhich a \"new man\" of the intelligentsia set about destroying the old order and\nthen ruling autocratically to establish a social utopia. It had been the\nfavorite book of Lenin's adored older brother, Alexander, who had been\nexecuted in 1887 for a plot against the czar's life. Even after Lenin became a\nMarxist, it was still his favorite book: \"I became acquainted with the works\nof Marx, Engels, and Plekhanov, but it was only Chernyshevsky who had an\noverwhelming influence on me.\"2 The idea that superior knowledge,\nauthoritarian instruction, and social design could transform society pervades\nboth works.\n\nCertain metaphors suffuse Lenin's analysis of the link between the vanguard\nparty and the workers in What Is to Be Done? They set the tone of the work and\nlimit what can be said within its confines. These metaphors center on the\nclassroom and the barracks.' The party and its local agitators and\npropagandists function as schoolteachers capable of raising merely economic\ncomplaints to the level of revolutionary political demands, or they function\nas officers in a revolutionary army who deploy their troops to best advantage.\nIn their roles as teachers, the vanguard party and its newspaper develop a\npedagogical style that is decidedly authoritarian. The party analyzes the many\nand varied popular grievances and, at the right time, \"dictate[s] a positive\nprogramme of action\" that will contribute to a \"universal political strug-\ngle.\"4 In fact, Lenin complained, the party's activists have been woefully\ninadequate. It is not enough to call the movement a \"vanguard,\" he insisted.\n\"We must act in such a way that all other units of the army shall see us, and\nbe obliged to admit that we are the vanguard.\" The goal of the vanguard party\nis to train willing but \"backward\" proletarians in revolutionary politics so\nthat they may be inducted into an army that will \"collect and utilize every\ngrain of even rudimentary protest,\" thereby creating a disciplined\nrevolutionary army.'\n\nIn keeping with these metaphors, the \"masses\" in general and the working class\nin particular become \"the body,\" while the vanguard party is \"the brain.\" The\nparty is to the working class as intelligence is to brute force, deliberation\nto confusion, a manager to a worker, a teacher to a student, an administrator\nto a subordinate, a professional to an amateur, an army to a mob, or a\nscientist to a layman. A brief explanation of how these metaphors work will\nhelp situate Lenin's own version of high-modern, albeit revolutionary,\npolitics.\n\nLenin realized, of course, that the revolutionary project depended on popular\nmilitancy and spontaneous protest. The problem of relying solely on popular\naction from below, however, was that such action was scattered and sporadic,\nmaking easy pickings for the czarist police. If we think of popular action as\nincendiary political material, the role of the vanguard party was to\nconcentrate and aim this explosive charge so that its detonation could bring\ndown the regime. The vanguard party \"merged the elemental destructive force of\na crowd with the conscious destructive force of the organization of\nrevolutionists.\",, It was the thinking organ of the revolution, ensuring that\nthe otherwise diffuse brute force of the masses was effectively used.\n\nThe logic of this perspective led Lenin to think of the vanguard party as a\nwould-be general staff to a vast but undisciplined army of raw recruits\nalready in combat. The more unruly the army, the greater the need for a small,\ncohesive general staff. To his competitors on the left (the Economists), who\nargued that ten wise men could easily be grabbed by the police, whereas one\nhundred fools (the revolutionary crowd) could not be stopped, Lenin replied,\n\"Without the 'dozen' of tried and talented leaders (and talented men are not\nborn by hundreds), professionally trained, schooled by long experience and\nworking in perfect harmony, no class in modern society is capable of\nconducting a determined struggle.\"'\n\nLenin's analogies to military organization were not just colorful figures of\nspeech; they were how he thought about most aspects of party organization. He\nwrote of \"tactics\" and \"strategy\" in a straightforwardly military style. Only\na general staff is capable of deploying its revolutionary forces in accord\nwith an overall battle plan. Only a general staff can see the entire\nbattlefield and anticipate enemy movements. Only a general staff would have\nthe \"flexibility ... to adapt itself immediately to the most diverse and\nrapidly changing conditions of struggle,\" the \"ability to renounce an open\nfight against overwhelming and concentrated forces, and yet capable of taking\nadvantage of the awkwardness and immobility of the enemy and of attacking at a\ntime and a place where he least expects attack :\"8 The earlier failures of\nsocial democrat revolutionaries could, he insisted, be attributed precisely to\nthe absence of organization, planning, and coordination that a general staff\ncould provide. These \"young warriors,\" who had \"marched to battle with\nastonishingly primitive equipment and training,\" were \"like peasants from the\nplough, snatching up a club.\" Their \"immediate and complete defeat\" was a\nforegone conclusion \"because these open conflicts were not the result of a\nsystematic and carefully thought-out and gradually prepared plan for a\nprolonged and stubborn struggle.\"9\n\nPart of the necessity for strict discipline arose from the fact that the\nenemies of revolution were better armed and more sophisticated. This explains\nwhy \"freedom of criticism\" among the revolutionary forces could only favor\nopportunists and the ascendancy of bourgeois values. Once again Lenin seized\non a military analogy to drive the point home: \"We are marching in a compact\ngroup along a precipitous and difficult path, firmly holding each other by the\nhand. We are surrounded on all sides by enemies, and are under their almost\nconstant fire. We have combined voluntarily, especially for the purpose of\nfighting the enemy and not to retreat into the adjacent marsh,\" that is,\nfreedom of criticism.10\n\nThe relationship envisioned by Lenin between the vanguard party and its rank\nand file is perhaps best exemplified by the terms \"mass\" or \"masses.\" Although\nthe terms became standard in socialist parlance, they are heavy with\nimplications. Nothing better conveys the impression of mere quantity and\nnumber without order than the word \"masses.\" Once the rank and file are so\nlabeled, it is clear that what they chiefly add to the revolutionary process\nare their weight in numbers and the kind of brute force they can represent if\nfirmly directed. The impression conveyed is of a huge, formless, milling crowd\nwithout any cohesion -without a history, without ideas, without a plan of\naction. Lenin was all too aware, of course, that the working class does have\nits own history and values, but this history and these values will lead the\nworking class in the wrong direction unless they are replaced by the\nhistorical analysis and advanced revolutionary theory of scientific socialism.\n\nThus the vanguard party not only is essential to the tactical cohesion of the\nmasses but also must literally do their thinking for them. The party functions\nas an executive elite whose grasp of history and dialectical materialism\nallows it to devise the correct \"war aims\" of the class struggle. Its\nauthority is based on its scientific intelligence. Lenin quoted the\n\"profoundly true and important utterances by Karl Kaut- sky,\" who said that\nthe proletariat cannot aspire to \"modern socialist consciousness\" on its own\nbecause it lacks the \"profound scientific knowledge\" required to do so: \"The\nvehicles of science are not the proletariat, but the bourgeois\nintelligentsia.\"\"\n\nThis is the core of Lenin's case against spontaneity. There are only two\nideologies: bourgeois and socialist. Given the pervasiveness and historical\npower of bourgeois ideology, the spontaneous development of the working class\nwill always lead to the triumph of bourgeois ideology. In Lenin's memorable\nformulation, \"the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to\ndevelop only trade-union conscious- ness.\"12 Social democratic consciousness,\nin contrast, must come from outside, that is, from the socialist\nintelligentsia. The vanguard party is depicted as conscious, scientific, and\nsocialist in the full sense and is contrasted with the masses who are, by\nextension, unconscious, prescientific, and in constant danger of absorbing\nbourgeois values. Lenin's stern admonitions about indiscipline-\"to deviate\nfrom it [socialist ideology] in the slightest degree means strengthening\nbourgeois ideology\" \"-leave the impression of a general staff whose tight\ncontrol is the only counterweight to a force of conscripts who might at any\nmoment disband and wander off.\n\nAnother metaphor occasionally replaces those of the army and classroom in\nLenin's discourse. It is the image of a bureaucratic or industrial enterprise\nin which only the executives and engineers can see the larger purposes of the\norganization. Lenin appeals to something like a division of labor in\nrevolutionary work, where the executive has a monopoly on the advanced theory\nwithout which revolution is impossible. Resembling factory owners and\nengineers who design rational plans for production, the vanguard party\npossesses a scientific grasp of revolutionary theory that makes it uniquely\nable to guide the entire proletarian struggle for emancipation. It was a bit\ntoo early, in 1903, for Lenin to refer to the assembly lines of mass\nproduction to make his point, but he appropriated the next best analogy from\nthe building industry. \"Pray tell me,\" he proposed. \"When a brick layer lays\nbricks in various parts of an enormous structure, the like of which has never\nbeen seen before, is it a 'paper' line that he uses to help him find the\ncorrect place to place each brick, to indicate to him the ultimate goal of the\nwork as a whole, to enable him to use not only every brick but even every\npiece of brick, which, joining with the bricks placed before and after it,\nforms a complete and all embracing line? And are we not now passing through a\nperiod in our party life, when we have bricks and bricklayers, but we lack the\nguiding line, visible to all, by which to guide our movements? \" 14 What the\nparty has is the blueprint of the entire new structure, which its scientific\ninsight has made possible. The role of the workers is to follow that part of\nthe blueprint allotted to them in the confidence that the architects of\nrevolution know what they are doing.\n\nThe analogy to the division of labor in modern capitalist production has\nimplications roughly parallel to those of the military metaphor. Both, for\nexample, require authoritarian methods and central control. Thus Lenin wrote\nof the party's need \"to distribute the thousand-andone minute functions of\ntheir organizational work,\" complained of \"technical defects,\" and called for\nthe unification of \"all these tiny fractions into one whole.\" As he concluded,\n\"specialization necessarily presupposes centralization, and in its turn\nimperatively calls for it.\" 15\n\nIt is surely a great paradox of What Is to Be Done? that Lenin takes a\nsubject-promoting revolution-that is inseparable from popular anger, violence,\nand the determination of new political ends and transforms it into a discourse\non technical specialization, hierarchy, and the efficient and predictable\norganization of means. Politics miraculously disappears from within the\nrevolutionary ranks and is left to the elite of the vanguard party, much as\nindustrial engineers might discuss, among themselves, how to lay out a factory\nfloor. The vanguard party is a machine to produce a revolution. There is no\nneed for politics within the party inasmuch as the science and rationality of\nthe socialist intelligentsia require instead a technically necessary\nsubordination; the party's judgments are not subjective and value laden but\nobjective and logically inevitable.\n\nLenin extends this line of reasoning to his characterization of the\nrevolutionary elite. They are not mere revolutionaries; they are \"professional\nrevolutionists.\" He insists on the full meaning of the term \"professional\":\nsomeone who is an experienced, full-time, trained revolutionist. This small,\nsecret, disciplined, professional cadre is specifically contrasted to workers'\norganizations, which are large, public, and established according to trades.\nThe two are never to be confused. Thus, to the analogy of the factory manager\nvis-a-vis the worker, Lenin adds that of the professional vis-a-vis the\napprentice or amateur. It is assumed that those in the second category will\ndefer to those in the first on the basis of their greater technical knowledge\nand experience. Just as Le Corbusier imagines that the public will acquiesce\nto the knowledge and calculations of the master architect, so Lenin is\nconfident that a sensible worker will want to place himself under the\nauthority of professional revolutionists.\n\nLet us return, finally, to the metaphor of the schoolroom where the vanguard\nparty is the teacher and the masses are the pupils. Lenin is hardly unique in\nhis use of this analogy. His was a pedagogical age in general, and reading\ncircles for workers and schools for socialist militants were common,\nespecially in Germany, where Rosa Luxemburg taught at the Socialist Party's\nschool in Berlin. Although the imagery of the schoolroom may have been\ncommonplace, Lenin's particular use of it to characterize socialist training\nbears emphasis. A tremendous amount of Lenin's thought and prose was devoted\nto \"socialist instruction\" broadly understood. He was preoccupied with how\nmilitants might be trained, the role of the party newspaper, Iskra, and the\ncontent of speeches, manifestos, and slogans. But Lenin's socialist schoolroom\nis fraught with danger. His constant fear is that the teachers will lose\ncontrol of the students and be swamped by the pervasive influence of narrow\neconomic demands, legislative reforms, and purely local concerns. The\nclassroom metaphor is inherently hierarchical, but Lenin's main worry is that\nhis socialist teachers will succumb and \"go native.\" Lurking near the surface\nof Lenin's writings is a powerful cultural judgment, which is evident here in\na representative passage.\n\nOur very first and most imperative duty is to help to train working-class\nrevolutionists who will be on the same level in regard to party activity as\nintellectual revolutionists (we emphasize the words \"in regard to party\nactivity\" because although it is necessary, it is not so easy and not so\nimperative to bring workers up to the level of intellectuals in other\nrespects). Therefore attention must be devoted principally to the task of\nraising the workers to the level of revolutionists, but without, in doing so,\nnecessarily degrading ourselves to the level of the \"labor masses\" as the\nEconomists wish to do, or necessarily to the level of the average worker, as\n[the newspaper] Svoboda desires to do.''\n\nThe dilemma for the party is how to train revolutionists who will be close to\nthe workers (and perhaps of worker backgrounds themselves) but who will not be\nabsorbed, contaminated, and weakened by the political and cultural\nbackwardness of the workers. Some of Lenin's worries have to do with his\nconviction at the time that the Russian working class and most of its\nsocialist intelligentsia were woefully backward compared to their German\ncounterparts. In What Is to Be Done? German social democracy and the German\ntrade-union movement function repeatedly as the model, in terms of which\nRussia is found want ing. But the principle behind Lenin's concerns transcends\nnational differences; it stems from the sharply delineated, functional roles\nthat the party and the working class each played. Class consciousness, in the\nfinal analysis, is an objective truth carried solely by the ideologically\nenlightened who direct the vanguard party.\"\n\nHowever contrary to Newton's first law of motion, the central idea informing\nLenin's logic is that the party will be an \"unmoved mover.\" An intimate\nassociation with the working class is absolutely necessary to the task of\npropaganda and agitation, but it must be a closeness that will never threaten\nthe hierarchy of knowledge, influence, and power. If professional\nrevolutionists are to be effective leaders, they require the kind of detailed\nunderstanding and knowledge of the workers that successful teachers need of\ntheir students, military officers need of their troops, or production managers\nneed of their workforce. It is knowledge for the purpose of achieving goals\nset by an elite. The relationship depicted is so asymmetrical that one is even\ntempted to compare it to the relation that a craftsman has to his raw\nmaterial. A woodworker or a mason must know his inert materials well in order\nto realize his designs. In Lenin's case, the relative inertness of the\nmaterial being shaped is implied by the global imagery of \"the masses\" or \"the\nproletariat.\" Once these flattened terms are used, it becomes difficult to\nexamine the enormous differences in history, political experience,\norganizational skills, and ideology (not to mention religion, ethnicity, and\nlanguage) that exist within the working class.\n\nThere is still another contingent and Russia-centered reason why Lenin might\nhave insisted on a small, disciplined, and secret cadre of revolutionists.\nThey were, after all, operating in an autocracy, under the noses of the\nczarist secret police. After commenting favorably on the openness of\ncompetition for office within the German Social Democratic Party, where, owing\nto certain political and press freedoms, all candidates' public records were\nknown, he exclaimed, \"Try to put this picture in the frame of our autocracy!\"\"\nWhere a revolutionary must conceal his identity, under pain of arrest, such\nopenly democratic methods were impossible. The revolutionaries in Russia must,\nLenin argued, adapt their tactics to those of their enemy-the political\npolice. If this were the only argument Lenin made for secrecy and iron\ndiscipline, then it could be treated as an incidental tactical concession to\nlocal conditions. But it was not. The secrecy of the party was designed to\nprevent contamination from below as much as arrest and exile. There is no\nother way to interpret passages like the following: \"If such an organization\n[a secret body of 'tried' revolutionists] existed on a firm theoretical basis,\nand possessed a Social-Democratic journal, we would have no reason to fear\nthat the movement will be diverted from its path by the numerous 'outside'\nelements that will be attracted to it.\"9\n\nHow would the movement be diverted? Lenin had chiefly two potential dangers in\nmind. The first was the danger of spontaneity, which makes the tactical\ncoordination of revolutionary pressure impossible. The second was, of course,\nthe virtually inevitable ideological diversion of the working class toward\ntrade unionism and legislative reform. Since authentic, revolutionary class\nconsciousness could never develop autonomously within the working class, it\nfollowed that the actual political outlook of workers was always a threat to\nthe vanguard party.\n\nIt is perhaps for these reasons that when Lenin wrote of propaganda and\nagitation, it was a one-way transmission of information and ideas that he had\nin mind. His unrelenting emphasis on a party newspaper fit nicely into this\ncontext. A newspaper, even more than \"agitation\" before heckling or sullen\ncrowds, creates a decidedly one-sided relationship.20 The organ is a splendid\nway to diffuse instructions, explain the party line, and rally the troops.\nLike its successor, the radio, the newspaper is a medium better suited to\nsending messages than to receiving them.\n\nOn many occasions, Lenin and his colleagues took the threat of contamination\nmore literally and spoke in metaphors drawn from the science of hygiene and\nthe germ theory of disease. Thus it became possible to talk of \"petit-\nbourgeois bacilli\" and \"infection.\"\" The shift in imagery was not far-fetched,\nfor Lenin did want to keep the party in an environment that was as sterile and\ngerm-free as possible lest the party contract one of the many diseases lurking\noutside.22\n\nLenin's general treatment of the working class in What Is to Be Done? is\nstrongly reminiscent of Marx's famous depiction of the smallholding French\npeasantry as a \"sack of potatoes\"-just so many \"homologous\" units lacking any\noverall structure or cohesion. This premise shapes in turn the role of the\nvanguard party. The trick is to change a formless, sporadic, fragmented, and\nlocalized anger among the masses into an organized force with purpose and\ndirection. Just as the force of a powerful magnet aligns a chaos of thousands\nof iron filings, so the party's leadership is expected to turn a crowd into a\npolitical army. At times it is hard to know what the masses actually bring to\nthe revolutionary project beyond the raw material they represent. Lenin's\ncatalogue of the functional roles that the party assumes is quite\ncomprehensive: \"We must go among all classes of people as theoreticians, as\npropagandists, as agitators, and as organizers.\"23 The inference to be drawn\nfrom this list is that the revolutionists are to provide knowledge, opinion,\nthe urge and direction to action, and organizational structure. Given this\nunidirectional flow of intellectual, social, and cultural services from above,\nit is hard to imagine what role the masses could have had beyond being\nmustered up.\n\nLenin conceived of a division of revolutionary labor that resembled what came\nto be the expectation (if rarely the practice) of Communist parties both in\nand out of power. The central committee made all the crucial decisions about\ntactics and strategy, while the mass organizations and trade unions affiliated\nwith the party served as \"transmission belts\" for instructions. If we consider\nthe vanguard party, as Lenin did, to be a machine for bringing about the\nrevolution, then we see that the vanguard party's relation to the working\nclass is not much different from a capitalist entrepreneur's relation to the\nworking class. The working class is necessary to production; its members must\nbe trained and instructed, and the efficient organization of their work must\nbe left to professional specialists. The ends of the revolutionist and the\ncapitalist are, of course, utterly different, but the problem of means that\nconfronts each is similar and is similarly resolved. The problem of the\nfactory manager is how to deploy so many factory \"hands\" (interchangeable\nunits all) for the purpose of efficient production. The problem of the\nscientific socialist party is how to efficiently deploy the masses in order to\nhasten the revolution. Such organizational logic seems more appropriate to\nfactory production, which involves steady routines, known technologies, and\ndaily wages, than to the decidedly nonroutine, high-stakes endeavor of\nrevolution. Nevertheless, it was the model of organization that structured\nmuch of Lenin's argument.\n\nTo grasp the picture of Lenin's utopian hopes for the vanguard party, one\nmight relate it to the \"mass exercises\" that were enormously popular among\nboth reactionary (mobilizing) and left-wing movements of the turn of the\ncentury. Set in huge stadiums or on parade grounds, they involved thousands of\nyoung men and women trained to move in unison. The more complicated their\nmaneuvers, which were often set to rhythmic music, the more impressive the\nspectacle. In 1891, at the Second National Congress of Sokol, a Czech\ngymnastic and physical fitness organization promoting nationalism, no fewer\nthan seventeen thousand Czechs gave an elaborate display of coordinated\nmovement.24 The whole idea of mass exercises was to create a striking\nexhibition of order, training, and discipline from above, one that would awe\nparticipants and spectators alike with its display of disciplined power. Such\nspectacles assumed and required a single centralized authority, which planned\nand executed the display.25 It is little wonder that the new mass-mobilization\nparties of all stripes should have found public exhibitions of this kind\ncompatible with their organizational ideology. Lenin was far too realistic to\nimagine that the Russian social democrats would ever resemble anything this\ncoherent and disciplined. Nevertheless, it was clearly the model of\ncentralized coordination to which he aspired and thus the yardstick by which\nhe measured his achievements.\n\nLenin and Le Corbusier, notwithstanding the great disparity in their training\nand purpose, shared some basic elements of the highmodernist outlook. While\nthe scientific pretensions of each may seem implausible to us, they both\nbelieved in the existence of a master science that served as the claim to\nauthority of a small planning elite. Le Corbusier believed that the scientific\ntruths of modern construction and efficient design entitled him to replace the\ndiscordant, chaotic historical deposit of urbanism with a utopian city. Lenin\nbelieved that the science of dialectical materialism gave the party unique\ninsight into the revolutionary process and entitled it to claim the leadership\nof an otherwise disorganized and ideologically misled working class. Both were\nconvinced that their scientific knowledge provided correct, unitary answers to\nhow cities should be designed and how revolutions might be brought to\nfruition. Their confidence in their method meant that neither the science of\ndesigning cities nor that of designing revolutions had much to learn from the\nexisting practices and values of their intended beneficiaries. On the\ncontrary, each looked forward to refashioning the human material that came\nunder their purview. Both, of course, had the improvement of the human\ncondition as their ultimate goal, and both attempted to attain it with methods\nthat were profoundly hierarchical and authoritarian. In the writings of both\nmen, metaphors of the military and the machine pervaded; for Le Corbusier, the\nhouse and city were machines for living, and for Lenin, the vanguard party was\na machine for revolution. Appeals to centralized forms of bureaucratic\ncoordination-especially the factory and the parade ground-creep naturally into\ntheir prose.26 They were, to be sure, among the most far-reaching and\ngrandiose figures of high modernism, but they were at the same time\nrepresentative.\n\n##### Theory and Practice: The Revolutions of 1917\n\nA detailed account of the two Russian Revolutions of 1917 (February and, above\nall, October) would take us too far afield. What is possible, however, is to\nsketch briefly some of the principal ways in which the actual revolutionary\nprocess resembled little the organizational doctrines advocated in What Is to\nBe Done? The high-modernist scheme for revolution was no more borne out in\npractice than were high-modernist plans for Brasilia and Chandigarh borne out\nin practice.\n\nThe most discordant fact about the Russian Revolution was that it was not to\nany significant degree brought about by the vanguard party, the Bolsheviks.\nWhat Lenin did succeed brilliantly in doing was in capturing the revolution\nonce it was an accomplished fact. As Hannah Arendt succinctly put it, \"The\nBolsheviks found power lying in the street, and picked it up\"27 E. H. Carr,\nwho wrote one of the earliest and most complete studies of the revolutionary\nperiod, concluded that \"the contribution of Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the\noverthrow of czarism was negligible\" and that indeed \"Bolshevism succeeded to\nan empty throne.\" Nor was Lenin the prescient commander in chief who could see\nthe strategic situation clearly. In January 1917, a month before the February\nRevolution, he wrote disconsolately, \"We of the older generation may not see\nthe decisive battles of the coming revolution.\"28\n\nThe Bolsheviks, on the eve of the revolution, did have a modest working-class\nbase, especially among the unskilled in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but\nSocial Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, anarchists, and unaffiliated workers\npredominated. What is more, the workers who were affiliated with the\nBolsheviks were rarely amenable to anything like the hierarchical control\nenvisioned in What Is to Be Done?\n\nLenin's aspiration for revolutionary practice was that the Bolsheviks would\ncome to form a tight, disciplined, command-and-control structure. Nothing\ncould have been further from actual experience. In all but one crucial\nrespect, the revolution of 1917 was very much like the miscarried revolution\nof 1905. Workers in revolt took over the factories and seized municipal power,\nwhile in the countryside, the peasantry began seizing land and attacking the\ngentry and tax officials. Neither of these activities, either in 1905 or in\n1917, was brought about by the Bolsheviks or any other revolutionary vanguard.\nThe workers, who spontaneously formed soviets to run each factory in 1917,\ndisregarded at will the instructions of their own Executive Committee of\nSoviets, not to mention the Bolsheviks. For their part, the peasantry took the\nopportunity created by a political vacuum at the center to restore communal\ncontrol over land and enact their local concept of justice. Most of the\npeasants had not even heard of the Bolsheviks, let alone presumed to act on\ntheir orders.\n\nWhat must forcefully strike any reader of accounts of the detailed events of\nlate October 1917 is the utter confusion and localized spontaneity that\nprevailed.29 The very idea of centralized coordination in this political\nenvironment was implausible. In the course of battle, as military historians\nand astute observers have always understood, the command structure typically\nfalters. Generals lose contact with their troops and are unable to follow the\nrapidly changing tides of battle; the commands the generals do issue are\nlikely to be irrelevant by the time they reach the battlefield.30 In Lenin's\ncase, the command-and-control structure could hardly falter, as it had never\nexisted in the first place. Ironically, Lenin himself was out of step with the\nparty's leadership (many of whom were behind bars) and was criticized on the\neve of the Revolution as a reckless putschist.\n\nThe new element in 1917 that made a revolutionary outcome far more likely than\nit had been in 1905 was World War I-specifically, the military collapse of the\nRussian offensive in Austria. Soldiers by the thousands threw down their\nweapons to return to the cities or to seize land in the countryside. The\nprovisional government of Aleksandr Kerensky had little or nothing in the way\nof coercive resources to deploy in its defense. It is in this sense that the\nBolsheviks \"succeeded to an empty throne,\" although Lenin's small military\nuprising of October 24 proved a crucial stroke. What followed in the years\nuntil 1921 is best described as the reconquest, now by the fledgling Bolshevik\nstate, of Russia. The reconquest was not simply a civil war against the\n\"Whites\"; it was also a war against the autonomous forces that had seized\nlocal power in the revolution.\" It involved, first and foremost, a long\nstruggle to destroy the independent power of the soviets and to impose\npiecework, labor control, and the abrogation of the right to strike on the\nworkers. In the countryside, the Bolshevik state gradually imposed political\ncontrol (in place of communal power), grain deliveries, and, eventually,\ncollectivization on the peasantry.\" The process of Bolshevik state making\nentailed a great deal of violence against its erstwhile beneficiaries, as the\nuprisings of Kronstadt, Tambov, and the Maknovchina in the Ukraine attested.\n\nThe model for the vanguard party depicted so sharply in What Is to Be Done? is\nan impressive example of executive command and control. Applied to the actual\nrevolutionary process, however, it is a pipe dream, bearing hardly any\nrelation to the facts. Where the model is descriptively accurate, alas, is in\nthe exercise of state authority after the revolutionary seizure of power. As\nit turned out, the structure of power that Lenin hoped would characterize the\nmaking of the revolution was more closely approximated by the long-lived\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" And in this case, of course, the workers\nand peasants did not consent to the structure of power; the state imposed it\nas a matter of imperative coordination.\n\nSince the revolutionary victors get to write the official history of how they\nachieved power, it matters little, in one sense, how snugly their account fits\nthe historical facts. Because most citizens come to believe the neatly\npackaged account, whether or not it is accurate, it further enhances their\nconfidence in the clairvoyance, determination, and power of their\nrevolutionary leaders. The standard \"just so\" story of the revolutionary\nprocess is perhaps the ultimate state simplification. It serves a variety of\npolitical and aesthetic purposes, which in turn help to account for the form\nit assumes. Surely, in the first instance, the inheritors of the revolutionary\nstate have a vested interest in representing themselves as the prime animators\nof the historical outcome. Such an account emphasizes their indispensable role\nas leaders and missionaries, and in the case of Lenin, it accorded best with\nthe stated organizational ideology of the Bolsheviks. The authorized histories\nof revolutions, as Milovan Djilas points out, \"describe the revolution as if\nit were the fruit of the previously planned action of its lead- ers.\"33 No\ncynicism or mendacity need be involved. It is perfectly natural for leaders\nand generals to exaggerate their influence on events; that is the way the\nworld looks from where they sit, and it is rarely in the interest of their\nsubordinates to contradict their picture.\n\nAfter seizing state power, the victors have a powerful interest in moving the\nrevolution out of the streets and into the museums and schoolbooks as quickly\nas possible, lest the people decide to repeat the experience.34 A schematic\naccount highlighting the decisiveness of a handful of leaders reinforces their\nlegitimacy; its emphasis on cohesion, uniformity, and central purpose makes it\nseem inevitable and therefore, it is to be hoped, permanent. The slighting of\nautonomous popular action serves the additional purpose of implying that the\nworking class is incapable of acting on its own without outside leader-\nship.35 The account is likely to take the opportunity to identify enemies\noutside and inside the revolution, singling out appropriate targets of hatred\nand suppression.\n\nThe standard account promoted by revolutionary elites is buttressed by the way\nin which the historical process itself \"naturalizes\" the world, erasing\nevidence of its contingency. Those who fought in \"The Russian Revolution\"\ndiscovered this fact about themselves only later, when the revolution was an\naccomplished fact. In the same way, none of the historical participants in,\nsay, World War I or the Battle of the Bulge, not to mention the Reformation or\nthe Renaissance, knew at the time that they were participating in anything\nthat could be so summarily described. And because things do turn out in a\ncertain way after all, with certain patterns or causes that are clear in\nretrospect, it is not surprising that the outcome should sometimes seem\ninevitable. Everyone forgets that it might all have turned out quite\ndifferently.36 In that forgetting, another step in naturalizing the\nrevolutionary triumph has been taken.37\n\nWhen victors such as Lenin get to impose their theories of revolution, not so\nmuch on the revolutionary events themselves, but on the postrevolutionary\nofficial story, the narrative typically stresses the agency, purpose, and\ngenius of the revolutionary leadership and minimizes contingency.3\" The final\nirony, then, was that the official story of the Bolshevik Revolution was made,\nfor more than sixty years, to conform closely to the utopian directions\noutlined in What Is to Be Done?\n\n##### The Lenin of State and Revolution\n\nThe later Lenin of State and Revolution is often juxtaposed to the Lenin of\nWhat Is to Be Done? to demonstrate a substantial shift in his view of the\nrelationship between the vanguard party and the masses. Without a doubt, much\nof Lenin's tone in the pamphlet, written at breakneck speed in August and\nSeptember of 1917-after the February Revolution and just before the October\nRevolution-is difficult to square with the text of 1903. There were important\ntactical reasons why, in 1917, Lenin might have wanted to encourage as much\nautonomous popular revolutionary action as possible. He and other Bolsheviks\nwere concerned that many workers, now masters of their factories, and many\nRussian urbanites would lose their revolutionary ardor, allowing Kerensky's\nprovisional government to gain control and block the Bolsheviks. For Lenin's\nrevolutionaries, everything depended on destabilizing the Kerensky regime,\neven if the crowds were not at all under Bolshevik discipline. No wonder that,\neven in early November, before the Bolsheviks had consolidated power, Lenin\nsounded very much like the anarchists: \"Socialism is not created by orders\nfrom above. State bureaucratic automatism is alien to its spirit; socialism is\nalive, creative-the creation of the popular masses themselves.\"39\n\nWhile State and Revolution has an egalitarian and utopian tone that echoes\nMarx's picture of Communism, what is striking for our purpose is the degree to\nwhich Lenin's high-modernist convictions still pervade the text. First, Lenin\nleaves no doubt that the application of state coercive power is the only way\nto build socialism. He openly avows the need for violence after the seizure of\npower: \"The proletariat needs state power, the centralized organization of\nforce, the organization of violence, ... for the purpose of guiding the great\nmass of the population-the peasantry, the petite bourgeoisie, the semi-\nproletarians-in the work of organizing Socialist economy.\"40 Once again\nMarxism provides the ideas and training that alone create a brain for the\nworking masses: \"By educating a workers' party, Marxism educates the vanguard\nof the proletariat, capable of assuming power and leading the whole people to\nSocialism, of directing and organizing the new order, of being teacher, guide\nand leader of all the toiling and exploited in the task of building up their\nsocial life without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie.\"41 The\nassumption is that the social life of the working class will be organized\neither by the bourgeoisie or by the vanguard party, but never by members of\nthe working class themselves.\n\nAt the same time, Lenin waxes eloquent about a new society in which politics\nwill have disappeared and in which virtually anyone could be entrusted with\nthe administration of things. The models for Lenin's optimism were precisely\nthe great human machines of his time: industrial organizations and large\nbureaucracies. In his picture, the growth of capitalism has built a\nnonpolitical technostructure that rolls along of its accord: \"Capitalist\nculture has created large-scale production, factories, railways, the postal\nservice, telephones, etc., and on this basis the great majority of functions\nof the old 'state power' have become so simplified and can be reduced to such\nsimple operations of registration, filing, and checking that they would be\nquite within the reach of every literate person, and it will be possible to\nperform them for working men's wages, which circumstance can (and must) strip\nthose functions of every shadow of privilege and every appearance of official\ngrandeur.\"42 Lenin conjures up a vision of the perfect technical rationality\nof modern production. Once the \"simple operations\" appropriate to each niche\nin the established division of labor are mastered, there is quite literally\nnothing more to discuss. The revolution ousts the bourgeoisie from the bridge\nof this \"ocean liner,\" installs the vanguard party, and sets a new course, but\nthe jobs of the vast crew are unchanged. Lenin's picture of the technical\nstructure, it should be noted, is entirely static. The forms of production are\neither set or, if they do change, the changes cannot require skills of a\ndifferent order.\n\nThe utopian promise of this capitalist-created state of affairs is that anyone\ncould take part in the administration of the state. The development of\ncapitalism had produced massive, socialized, bureaucratic apparatuses as well\nas the \"training and disciplining of millions of work- ers.\"43 Taken together,\nthese huge, centralized bureaucracies were the key to the new world. Lenin had\nseen them at work in the wartime mobilization of Germany under Rathenau's\nguiding hand. Science and the division of labor had spawned an institutional\norder of technical expertise in which politics and quarrels were beside the\npoint. Modern production provided the basis of a technically necessary\ndictatorship. \"In regard to ... the importance of individual dictatorial\npowers,\" Lenin observed, \"it must be said that large-scale machine\nindustrywhich is precisely ... the foundation of socialism[-] ... calls for\nabsolute and strict unity of will, which directs the joint labours of\nhundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of people.... But how can strict\nunity of will be ensured? By thousands subordinating their will to the will of\none.... We must learn to combine the public-meeting democracy of the working\npeople-turbulent, surging, overflowing its banks like a spring flood-with iron\ndiscipline while at work, with unquestioning obedience to the will of a single\nperson, the Soviet leader, while at work .\"14\n\nIn this respect, Lenin joins many of his capitalist contemporaries in his\nenthusiasm for Fordist and Taylorist production technology. What was rejected\nby Western trade unions of the time as a \"de-skilling\" of an artisanal\nworkforce was embraced by Lenin as the key to rational state planning.45 There\nis, for Lenin, a single, objectively correct, efficient answer to all\nquestions of how to rationally design production or administration.46\n\nLenin goes on to imagine, in a Fourierist vein, a vast national syndicate that\nwill virtually run itself. He sees it as a technical net whose mesh will\nconfine workers to the appropriate routines by its rationality and the\ndiscipline of habit. In a chillingly Orwellian passage-a warning, perhaps, to\nanarchist or lumpen elements who might resist its logic-Lenin indicates how\nremorseless the system will be: \"Escape from this national accounting will\ninevitably become increasingly difficult ... and will probably be accompanied\nby such swift and severe punishment (for the armed workers are men of\npractical life, not sentimental intellectuals and they will scarcely allow\nanyone to trifle with them), that very soon the necessity of observing the\nsimple, fundamental rules of social life in common will have become a\nhabit.\"47\n\nExcept for the fact that Lenin's utopia is more egalitarian and is set in the\ncontext of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the parallels with Le\nCorbusier's high modernism are conspicuous. The social order is conceived as a\nvast factory or office-a \"smoothly humming machine,\" as Le Corbusier would\nhave put it, in which \"each man would live in an ordered relation to the\nwhole.\" Neither Lenin nor Le Corbusier were unique in sharing this vision,\nalthough they were exceptionally influential. The parallels serve as a\nreminder of the extent to which much of the socialist left as well as the\nright were in thrall to the template of modern industrial organization.\nComparable utopias, a \"dream of authoritarian, military, egalitarian,\nbureaucratic socialism which was openly admiring of Prussian values,\" could be\nfound in Marx, in Saint-Simon, and in the science fiction that was widely\npopular in Rus sia at the time, especially a translation of Edward Bellamy's\nLooking Backward.41 High modernism was politically polymorphous; it could\nappear in any political disguise, even an anarchist one.\n\n##### The Lenin of The Agrarian Question\n\nIn order to clinch the argument for Lenin's consistently high-modernist\nstance, we need only turn to his writings on agriculture, a field in which\nhigh-modernist views were hotly contested. Most of our evidence can be drawn\nfrom a single work, The Agrarian Question, written between 1901 and 1907.4`'\n\nThis text was an unremitting condemnation of small-scale family farming and a\ncelebration of the gigantic, highly mechanized forms of modern agriculture.\nFor Lenin it was not just a question of aesthetics of scale but a question of\nhistorical inevitability. The difference between low-technology family farming\nand large-scale, mechanized farming was precisely the difference between the\nhand-operated looms of cottage-industry weavers on one hand and the mechanized\nlooms of large textile factories on the other. The first mode of production\nwas simply doomed. Lenin's analogy was borrowed from Marx, who frequently used\nit as a way of saying that the hand loom gives you feudalism and the power\nloom gives you capitalism. So suggestive was this imagery that Lenin fell back\non it in other contexts, claiming, for example, in What Is to Be Done? that\nhis opponents, the Economists, were using \"handicraft methods,\" whereas the\nBolsheviks operated as professional (modern, trained) revolutionaries.\n\nPeasant forms of production-not to mention the peasants themselves-were, for\nLenin, hopelessly backward. They were mere historical vestiges that would\nundoubtedly be swept away, as the cottageindustry weavers had been, by the\nagrarian equivalent of large-scale machine industry. Two decades have passed,\"\nhe wrote, \"and machinery has driven the small producer from still another of\nhis last refuges, as if telling those who have ears to hear and eyes to see\nthat the economist must always look forward, towards technical progress, or\nelse be left behind at once, for he who will not look ahead turns his back on\nhistory; there is not and there cannot be any middle path.\"\"' Here and in\nother writings Lenin denounced all the cultivation and social practices\nassociated with the customary, communal, three-field system of land allotments\nthat still pertained in much of Russia. In this case, the idea of common\nproperty prevented the full development of capitalism, which, in turn, was a\ncondition of revolution. \"Modern agricultural technique,\" he concluded,\n\"demands that all the conditions of the ancient, conservative, barbarous,\nignorant, and pauper methods of economy on peasant allotments be transformed.\nThe three-field system, the primitive implements, the patriarchical\nimpecuniosity of the tiller, the routine methods of stock breeding and crass\nnaive ignorance of the conditions and requirements of the market must all be\nthrown overboard.\"\"\n\nThe suitability of a logic drawn from manufacturing and applied to\nagriculture, however, was very much contested. Any number of economists had\ncarried out detailed studies of labor allocation, production, and expenditures\nfor rural producer households. While some were perhaps ideologically committed\nto developing a case for the productive efficiency of small property, they had\na wealth of empirical evidence that had to be confronted.52 They argued that\nthe nature of much agricultural production meant that the economic returns of\nmechanization were minimal when compared to the returns of intensification\n(which focused on manuring, careful breeding, and so on). The returns to scale\nas well, they argued, were minimal or negative beyond the average acreage of\nthe family farm. Lenin might have taken these arguments less seriously had\nthey all been based on Russian data, where the backwardness of rural\ninfrastructure impeded mechanization and commercial production. But most of\nthe data came from Germany and Austria, comparatively developed countries,\nwhere the small farmers in question were highly commercialized and responsive\nto market forces.53\n\nLenin set out to refute the data purporting to show the efficiency or\ncompetitiveness of family agriculture. He exploited the inconsistencies of\ntheir empirical evidence and introduced data from other scholars, both Russian\nand German, to make the case against them. Where the evidence seemed\nunassailable, Lenin claimed that the small farmers who did survive managed to\ndo so only by starving and overworking themselves, their wives and children,\ntheir cows, and their plow animals. Whatever profits the small farms produced\nwere the consequence of overwork and underconsumption. Although such patterns\nof \"autoexploitation\" were not uncommon within peasant families, Lenin's\nevidence was not completely convincing. For his (and Marx's) understanding of\nmodes of production, the survival of artisanal handiwork and small farming had\nto be an incidental anachronism. We have since learned how efficient and\ntenacious small-scale production can be, but Lenin was in no doubt about what\nthe future held. \"This inquiry demonstrates the technical superiority of\nlarge-scale production in agriculture ... [and] the overwork and\nunderconsumption of the small peasant and his transformation into a regular or\nday-labourer for the landlord.... The facts prove incontestably that under the\ncapitalist system the position of the small peasant in agriculture is in every\nway analogous to that of the handicraftsman in industry.\"54\n\nThe Agrarian Question also allows us to appreciate an additional facet of\nLenin's high modernism: his celebration of the most modern technology and,\nabove all, electricity.55 He was famous for claiming that \"Communism is Soviet\nPower plus the Electrification of the whole countryside.\" Electricity had, for\nhim and for most other high modernists, a nearly mythical appeal. That appeal\nhad to do, I think, with the unique qualities of electricity as a form of\npower. Unlike the mechanisms of steam power, direct waterpower, and the\ninternal combustion engine, electricity was silent, precise, and well-nigh\ninvisible. For Lenin and many others, electricity was magical. Its great\npromise for the modernization of rural life was that, once transmission lines\nwere laid down, power could be delivered over long distances and was instantly\navailable wherever it was needed and in the quantity required. Lenin imagined,\nincorrectly, that it would replace the internal combustion engine in most farm\noperations. \"Machinery powered by electricity runs more smoothly and\nprecisely, and for that reason it is more convenient to use in thrashing,\nploughing, milking, cutting fodder.\"56 By placing power within reach of an\nentire people, the state could eliminate what Marx termed the \"idiocy of rural\nlife.\"\n\nElectrification was, for Lenin, the key to breaking the pattern of petit-\nbourgeois landholding and hence the only way to extirpate \"the roots of\ncapitalism\" in the countryside, which was \"the foundation, the basis, of the\ninternal enemy.\" The enemy \"depends on small-scale production, and there is\nonly one way of undermining it, namely, to place the economy of the country,\nincluding agriculture, on a new technical basis, that of modern large-scale\nproduction. Only electricity provides that basis.\"57\n\nMuch of the attraction of electricity for Lenin had to do with its perfection,\nits mathematical precision. Man's work and even the work of the steam-driven\nplow or threshing machine were imperfect; the operation of an electric\nmachine, in contrast, seemed certain, precise, and continuous. Electricity was\nalso, it should be added, centralizing.58 It produced a visible network of\ntransmission lines emanating from a central power station from which the flow\nof power was generated, distributed, and controlled. The nature of electricity\nsuited Lenin's utopian, centralizing vision perfectly. A map of electric lines\nfrom the generating plant would look like the spokes of a centralized\ntransportation hub like Paris (see chapter 1), except that the direction of\nflow was one way. Transmission lines blanketed the nation with power in a way\nthat overcame geography. Electricity equalized access to an essential part of\nthe modern world and, not incidentally, brought light-both literally and\nculturally-to the narod (literally, the \"dark people\").59 Finally, electricity\nallowed and indeed required planning and calculation. The way that electricity\nworked was very much the way that Lenin hoped the power of the socialist state\nwould work.\n\nFor Lenin, much the same developmental logic applied to the top elite of the\nvanguard party, the factory, and the farm. Professionals, technicians, and\nengineers would replace amateurs as leaders. Centralized authority based on\nscience would prevail. As with Le Corbusier, the degree of functional\nspecificity within the organization, the degree of order provided by routines\nand the substitutability of units, and the extent of mechanization were all\nyardsticks of superior efficiency and rationality. In the case of farms and\nfactories, the larger and more capital intensive they were, the better. One\ncan already glimpse in Lenin's conception of agriculture the mania for\nmachinetractor stations, the establishment of large state farms and eventual\ncollectivization (after Lenin's death), and even the high-modernist spirit\nthat would lead to such vast colonization schemes as Khrushchev's Virgin Lands\ninitiative. At the same time, Lenin's views have a strong Russian lineage.\nThey bear a family resemblance to Peter the Great's project for Saint\nPetersburg and to the huge model military colonies set up by Alexei Arakcheev\nwith the patronage of Alexander I in the early nineteenth century-both\ndesigned to drag Russia into the modern world.\n\nBy focusing on Lenin's high-modernist side, we risk simplifying an\nexceptionally complex thinker whose ideas and actions were rich with\ncrosscurrents. During the revolution he was capable of encouraging the\ncommunal seizure of land, autonomous action, and the desire of rural Soviets\n\"to learn from their own mistakes .\"60 He decided, at the end of a devastating\ncivil war and a grain-procurement crisis, to shelve collectivization and\nencourage small-scale production and petty trade. Some have suggested that in\nhis last writings he was more favorably disposed to peasant farming and, it is\nspeculated, would not have forced through the brutal collectivization that\nStalin ordered in 1929.\n\nDespite the force of these qualifications, there is little reason, I think, to\nbelieve that Lenin ever abandoned the core of his high-modernist convictions\n.61 This is apparent even in how he phrases his tactical retreat following the\nKronstadt uprising in 1921 and the continuing urban food crisis: \"Until we\nhave remolded the peasant, ... until largescale machinery has recast him, we\nmust assure him of the possibility of running his economy without\nrestrictions. We must find forms of co existence with the small farmer...\nsince the remaking of the small farmer, the reshaping of his whole psychology\nand all his habits, is a task requiring generations.\",\" If this is a tactical\nretreat, the acknowledgment that the transformation of the peasants will take\ngenerations does not exactly sound like the words of a general who expects to\nresume the offensive soon. On the other hand, Lenin's faith in mechanization\nas the key to the transformation of a recalcitrant human nature is\nundiminished. There is a new modesty-the fruit of effective peasant\nresistance-about how tortuous and long the path to a modern, socialized\nagriculture will be, but the vista, once the journey is made, looks the same.\n\n#### Luxemburg: Physician and Midwife to the Revolution\n\nRosa Luxemburg was more than merely a contemporary of Lenin. She was an\nequally committed revolutionary and Marxist who was assassinated, along with\nKarl Liebknecht, in Berlin in 1919 at the behest of her less revolutionary\nallies on the left. Although Jane Jacobs was a critic of Le Corbusier and\nhigh-modernist urban planning in general, Le Corbusier had almost certainly\nnever heard of Jacobs before he died. Lenin, on the other hand, had met\nLuxemburg. They wrote largely for the same audience and in the knowledge of\neach other's opinions, and indeed Luxemburg specifically refuted Lenin's\narguments about the vanguard party and its relation to the proletariat in a\nrevolutionary setting. We will chiefly be concerned with the essays in which\nLuxemburg most directly confronts Lenin's high-modernist views:\n\"Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy\" (1904), \"Mass-Strike,\nParty, and Trade Unions\" (1906), and her posthumously published \"The Russian\nRevolution\" (written in 1918, first published in 1921, after the Kronstadt\nuprising).\n\nLuxemburg differed most sharply with Lenin in her relative faith in the\nautonomous creativity of the working class. Her optimism in \"Mass-Strike,\nParty, and Trade Unions\" is partly due to the fact that it was written, unlike\nWhat Is to Be Done? after the object lesson of worker militancy provided by\nthe 1905 revolution. Luxemburg was especially struck by the massive response\nof the Warsaw proletariat to the revolution of 1905. On the other hand,\n\"Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy\" was written before the\nevents of 1905 and in direct reply to What Is to Be Done? This essay was a key\ntext in the refusal of the Polish party to place itself under the central\ndiscipline of the Russian Social Democratic Party.63\n\nIn emphasizing the differences between Lenin and Luxemburg, we must not\noverlook the ideological common ground they took for granted. They shared, for\nexample, Marxist assumptions about the contradictions of capitalist\ndevelopment and the inevitability of revolution. They were both enemies of\ngradualism and of anything more than tactical compromises with\nnonrevolutionary parties. Even at the strategic level, they both argued for\nthe importance of a vanguard party on the grounds that the vanguard party was\nmore likely to see the whole situation (the \"totality\"), whereas most workers\nwere more likely to see only their local situation and their particular\ninterests. Neither Lenin nor Luxemburg had what might be called a sociology of\nthe party. That is, it did not occur to them that the intelligentsia of the\nparty might have interests that did not coincide with the workers' interests,\nhowever defined. They were quick to see a sociology of tradeunion\nbureaucracies but not a sociology of the revolutionary Marxist party.\n\nLuxemburg, in fact, was not above using the metaphor of the factory manager,\nas did Lenin, to explain why the worker might be wise to follow instructions\nin order to contribute to a larger result not immediately apparent from where\nhe stood. Where the difference arises, however, is in the lengths to which\nthis logic is pursued. For Lenin, the totality was exclusively in the hands of\nthe vanguard party, which had a virtual monopoly of knowledge. He imagined an\nall-seeing centeran eye in the sky, as it were-which formed the basis for\nstrictly hierarchical operations in which the proletariat became mere foot\nsoldiers or pawns. For Luxemburg, the party might well be more farsighted than\nthe workers, but it would nevertheless be constantly surprised and taught new\nlessons by those whom it presumed to lead.\n\nLuxemburg viewed the revolutionary process as being far more complex and\nunpredictable than did Lenin, just as Jacobs saw the creation of successful\nurban neighborhoods as being far more complex and mysterious than did Le\nCorbusier. The metaphors Luxemburg used, as we shall see, were indicative.\nEschewing military, engineering, and factory parallels, she wrote more\nfrequently of growth, development, experience, and learning.64\n\nThe idea that the vanguard party could either order or prohibit a mass strike,\nthe way a commander might order his soldiers to the front or confine them to\nbarracks, struck Luxemburg as ludicrous. Any attempt to so engineer a strike\nwas both unrealistic and morally inadmissible. She rejected the\ninstrumentalism that underlay this view. \"Both tendencies [ordering or\nprohibiting a mass strike] proceed from the same, pure anarchist [sic] notion\nthat the mass strike is merely a technical means of struggle which can be\n'decided' or 'for bidden' at pleasure, according to one's knowledge and\nconscience, a kind of pocket-knife which one keeps clasped in his packet,\n'ready for all emergencies,' or decides to unclasp and use.\"65 A general\nstrike, or a revolution for that matter, was a complex social event involving\nthe wills and knowledge of many human agents, of which the vanguard party was\nonly one element.\n\n##### Revolution as a Living Process\n\nLuxemburg looked on strikes and political struggles as dialectical, historical\nprocesses. The structure of the economy and the workforce helped to shape, but\nnever determine, the options available. Thus, if industry was small scale and\ngeographically scattered, strikes would typically be small and scattered as\nwell. Each set of strikes, however, forced changes in the structure of\ncapital. If workers won higher wages, for example, the increases might provoke\nconsolidations in the industry, mechanization, and new patterns of\nsupervision, all of which would influence the character of the next round of\nstrikes. A strike would also, of course, teach the workforce new lessons and\nalter the character of its cohesion and leadership.66 This insistence on\nprocess and human agency served Luxemburg as a warning against a narrow view\nof tactics. A strike or a revolution was not simply an end toward which\ntactics and command ought to be directed; the process leading to it was at the\nsame time shaping the character of the proletariat. How the revolution was\nmade mattered as much as whether it was made at all, for the process itself\nhad heavy consequences.\n\nLuxemburg found Lenin's desire to turn the vanguard party into a military\ngeneral staff for the working class to be both utterly unrealistic and morally\ndistasteful. His hierarchical logic ignored the inevitable autonomy of the\nworking class (singly and in groups), whose own interests and actions could\nnever be machine-tooled into strict conformity. What is more, even if such\ndiscipline were conceivable, by imposing it the party would deprive itself of\nthe independent, creative force of a proletariat that was, after all, the\nsubject of the revolution. Against Lenin's aspiration for control and order\nLuxemburg juxtaposed the inevitably disorderly, tumultuous, and living tableau\nof largescale social action. \"Instead of a fixed and hollow scheme of sober\npolitical action executed with a prudent plan decided by the highest\ncommittees,\" she wrote, in what was a clear reference to Lenin, \"we see a\nvibrant part of life in flesh and blood which cannot be cut out of the larger\nframe of the revolution: The mass strike is bound by a thousand veins to all\nparts of the revolution.\"67 When contrasting her under standing to Lenin's,\nshe consistently reached for metaphors from complex, organic processes, which\ncannot be arbitrarily carved up without threatening the vitality of the\norganism itself. The idea that a rational, hierarchical executive committee\nmight deploy its proletarian troops as it wished not only was irrelevant to\nreal political life but was also dead and hollow.,-\"\n\nIn her refutation of What Is to Be Done? Luxemburg made clear that the cost of\ncentralized hierarchy lay in the loss of creativity and initiative from below:\n\"The 'discipline' Lenin has in mind is by no means only implanted in the\nproletariat by the factory, but equally by the barracks, by the modern\nbureaucracy, by the entire mechanism of the centralized bourgeois state\napparatus.... The ultracentrism advocated by Lenin is permeated in its very\nessence by the sterile spirit of a nightwatchman (Nachtwachtergeist) rather\nthan by a positive and creative spirit. He concentrated mostly on controlling\nthe party, not on fertilizing it, on narrowing it down, not developing it, on\nregimenting and not unifying it.\"69\n\nThe core of the disagreement between Lenin and Luxemburg is caught best in the\nfigures of speech they each use. Lenin comes across as a rigid schoolmaster\nwith quite definite lessons to convey-a schoolmaster who senses the unruliness\nof his pupils and wants desperately to keep them in line for their own good.\nLuxemburg sees that unruliness as well, but she takes it for a sign of\nvitality, a potentially valuable resource; she fears that an overly strict\nschoolmaster will destroy the pupils' enthusiasm and leave a sullen,\ndispirited classroom where nothing is really learned. She argues elsewhere, in\nfact, that the German Social Democrats, by their constant efforts at close\ncontrol and discipline, have demoralized the German working class.70 Lenin\nsees the possibility that the pupils might influence a weak, timorous teacher\nand deplores it as a dangerous counterrevolutionary step. Luxemburg, for whom\nthe classroom bespeaks a genuine collaboration, implicitly allows for the\npossibility that the teacher might just learn some valuable lessons from the\npupils.\n\nOnce Luxemburg began thinking of the revolution as analogous to a complex\nnatural process, she concluded that the role of a vanguard party was\ninevitably limited. Such processes are far too complicated to be well\nunderstood, let alone directed or planned in advance. She was deeply impressed\nby the autonomous popular initiatives taken all over Russia after the shooting\nof the crowd before the Winter Palace in 1905. Her description, which I quote\nat length, invokes metaphors from nature to convey her conviction that\ncentralized control is an illusion.\n\nAs the Russian Revolution [1905] shows to us, the mass strike is such a\nchangeable phenomenon that it reflects in itself all phases of political and\neconomic struggle, all stages and moments of the revolution. Its\napplicability, its effectiveness, and the moments of its origin change\ncontinually. It suddenly opens new, broad perspectives of revolution just\nwhere it seemed to have come to a narrow pass; and it disappoints where one\nthought he could reckon on it in full certitude. Now it flows like a broad\nbillow over the whole land, now it divides itself into a gigantic net of thin\nstreams; now it bubbles forth from under the ground like a fresh spring, now\nit trickles flat along the ground.... All [forms of popular struggle] run\nthrough one another, next to each other, across one another, flow in and over\none another; it is an eternal, moving, changing sea of appearances.\"\n\nThe mass strike, then, was not a tactical invention of the vanguard party to\nbe used at the appropriate moment. It was, rather, the \"living pulse-beat of\nthe revolution and at the same time its most powerful driving-wheel.... the\nphenomenal form of the proletarian struggle in the revolution.\"72 From\nLuxemburg's perspective, Lenin must have seemed like an engineer with hopes of\ndamming a wild river in order to release it at a single stroke in a massive\nflood that would be the revolution. She believed that the \"flood\" of the mass\nstrike could not be predicted or controlled; its course could not be much\naffected by professional revolutionists, although they could, as Lenin\nactually did, ride that flood to power. Luxemburg's understanding of the\nrevolutionary process, curiously enough, provided a better description of how\nLenin and the Bolsheviks came to power than did the utopian scenario in What\nIs to Be Done?\n\nA grasp of political conflict as process allowed Luxemburg to see well beyond\nwhat Lenin considered to be failures and dead ends. Writing of 1905, she\nemphasized that \"after every foaming wave of political action a fructifying\ndeposit remains from which a thousand stalks of economic struggle shoot\nforth.\"73 The analogy she drew to organic processes conveyed both their\nautonomy and their vulnerability. To extract from the living tissue of the\nproletarian movement a particular kind of strike for instrumental use would\nthreaten the whole organism. With Lenin in mind she wrote, \"If the\ncontemplative theory proposes the artificial dissection of the mass strike to\nget at the 'pure political mass strike,' then by this dissection, as with any\nother, it will not perceive the phenomenon in its living essence, but will\nkill it all together.\"74 Luxemburg, then, saw the workers' movement in much\nthe same light as Jacobs saw the city: as an intricate social organism whose\norigin, dynamics, and future were but dimly understood. To nevertheless\nintervene and dissect the workers' movement was to kill it, just as carving up\nthe city along strict functional lines produced a lifeless, taxidermist's\ncity.\n\nIf Lenin approached the proletariat as an engineer approached his raw\nmaterials, with a view toward shaping them to his purposes, Luxemburg\napproached the proletariat as a physician would. Like any patient, the\nproletariat had its own constitution, which limited the kind of interventions\nthat could be made. The physician needed to respect the patient's constitution\nand assist according to its potential strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the\nautonomy and history of the patient would inevitably influence the outcome.\nThe proletariat could not be reshaped from the ground up and fitted neatly\ninto a predetermined design.\n\nBut the major, recurrent theme of Luxemburg's criticism of Lenin and the\nBolsheviks generally was that their dictatorial methods and their mistrust of\nthe proletariat made for bad educational policy. It thwarted the development\nof the mature, independent working class that was necessary to the revolution\nand to the creation of socialism. Thus she attacked both the German and\nRussian revolutionists for substituting the ego of the vanguard party for the\nego of the proletariat-a substitution that ignored the fact that the objective\nwas to create a self-conscious workers' movement, not just to use the\nproletariat as instruments. Like a confident and sympathetic guardian, she\nanticipated false steps as part of the learning process. \"However, the nimble\nacrobat,\" she charged, referring to the Social Democratic Party, \"fails to see\nthat the true subject to whom this role of director falls is the collective\nego of the working class which insists on its right to make its own mistakes\nand learn the historical dialectic by itself. Finally, we must frankly admit\nto ourselves that the errors made by a truly revolutionary labor movement are\nhistorically infinitely more fruitful and valuable than the infallibility of\nthe best of all possible 'central committees.' \"75\n\nNearly fifteen years later, a year after the October 1917 Bolshevik seizure of\npower, Luxemburg was attacking Lenin in precisely the same terms. Her\nwarnings, so soon after the revolution, about the direction in which the\ndictatorship of the proletariat was headed seem prophetic.\n\nShe believed that Lenin and Trotsky had completely corrupted a proper\nunderstanding of the dictatorship of the proletariat. To her, it meant rule by\nthe whole proletariat, which required the broadest political freedoms for all\nworkers (though not for enemy classes) so that they could bring their\ninfluence and wisdom to bear on the building of socialism. It did not mean, as\nLenin and Trotsky assumed, that a small circle of party leaders would exercise\ndictatorial power merely in the name of the proletariat. Trotsky's proposal\nthat the constituent assembly not convene because circumstances had changed\nsince its election struck Luxemburg as a cure that was worse than the disease.\nOnly an active public life could remedy the shortcomings of representative\nbodies. By concentrating absolute power in so few hands, the Bolsheviks had\n\"blocked up the fountain of political experience and the source of this rising\ndevelopment [the attaining of higher stages of socialism] by their suppression\nof public life.\"76\n\nBeneath this dispute was not just a difference in tactics but a fundamental\ndisagreement about the nature of socialism. Lenin proceeded as if the road to\nsocialism were already mapped out in detail and the task of the party were to\nuse the iron discipline of the party apparatus to make sure that the\nrevolutionary movement kept to that road. Luxemburg, on the contrary, believed\nthat the future of socialism was to be discovered and worked out in a genuine\ncollaboration between workers and their revolutionary state. There were no\n\"ready-made prescriptions\" for the realization of socialism, nor was there \"a\nkey in any socialist party program or textbook. \"\" The openness that\ncharacterized a socialist future was not a shortcoming but rather a sign of\nits superiority, as a dialectical process, over the cut-and-dried formulas of\nutopian socialism. The creation of socialism was \"new territory. A thousand\nproblems-only experience is capable of correcting and opening new ways. Only\nunobstructed, effervescing life falls into a thousand new forms and\nimprovisations, brings to light creative force, itself corrects all mistaken\nattempts.\"78 Lenin's use of decrees and terror and what Luxemburg called the\n\"dictatorial force of the factory overseer\" deprived the revolution of this\npopular creative force and experience. Unless the working class as a whole\nparticipated in the political process, she added ominously, \"socialism will be\ndecreed from behind a few official desks by a dozen intellectuals.\"79\n\nLooking ahead, so soon after the revolution, to the closed and authoritarian\npolitical order Lenin was constructing, Luxemburg's predictions were chilling\nbut accurate: \"But with the repression of political life in the land as a\nwhole, life in the soviets must also become crippled. Without general\nelections, without unrestricted freedom of the press and assembly, without a\nfree struggle of opinion, life dies out in every public institution.... Public\nlife gradually falls asleep.... In reality only a dozen outstanding heads\n[party leaders] do the leading and an elite of the working class is invited to\napplaud the speeches of the leaders, and to approve proposed resolutions\nunanimously-at bottom then, a clique affair... a dictatorship in the bourgeois\nsense.\"80\n\n#### Aleksandra Kollontay and the Workers' Opposition to Lenin\n\nAleksandra Kollontay was in effect the local voice of a Luxemburgian critique\namong the Bolsheviks after the revolution. A revolutionary activist, the head\nof the women's section of the Central Committee (Zhenotdel), and, by early\n1921, closely associated with the Workers' Opposition, Kollontay was a thorn\nin Lenin's side. He regarded the sharply critical pamphlet she wrote just\nbefore the Tenth Party Congress in 1921 as a nearly treasonous act. The Tenth\nParty Congress opened just as the suppression of the workers' and sailors'\nrevolt in Kronstadt was being organized and in the midst of the Makno uprising\nin the Ukraine. To attack the party leadership at such a perilous moment was a\ntreacherous appeal to \"the base instincts of the masses.\"\n\nThere was a direct connection between Luxemburg and her Russian colleague.\nKollontay had been deeply impressed by reading Luxemburg's Social Reform or\nRevolution early in the century and had actually met Luxemburg at a socialist\nmeeting in Germany. While Kollontay's pamphlet echoed most of Luxemburg's\ncriticisms of centralized, authoritarian socialist practice, its historical\ncontext was distinctive. Kollontay was making her case as part of the Workers'\nOpposition argument for an all-Russian congress of producers, freely elected\nfrom the trade unions, which would direct production and industrial planning.\nAlexander Shlyiapnikov, a close ally of Kollontay, and other trade unionists\nwere alarmed at the increasingly dominant role of technical specialists, the\nbureaucracy, and the party center and the exclusion of workers' organizations.\nDuring the civil war, martial-law techniques of management were perhaps\nunderstandable. But now that the civil war was largely won, the direction of\nsocialist construction seemed at stake. Kollontay brought to her case for\ntrade-union co-management of industry a wealth of practical experience\nacquired in the frustrating job of negotiating with state organs on behalf of\nworking women who had organized creches and canteens. In the end, the Workers'\nOpposition was outlawed and Kollontay was silenced, but not before leaving\nbehind a prophetic legacy of criticism.\"\n\nKollontay's pamphlet attacked the party state, which she compared to an\nauthoritarian schoolteacher, in much the same terms used by Luxemburg. She\ncomplained, above all, that the relationship between the central committee and\nthe workers had become a stark one-way relationship of command. The trade\nunions were seen as a mere \"connecting link\" or transmission belt of the\nparty's instructions to the workers; unions were expected to \"bring up the\nmasses\" in exactly the way a schoolteacher whose curriculum and lesson plans\nare mandated from above passes those lessons on to pupils. She castigated the\nparty for its out-of-date pedagogical theory, which left no room for the\npotential originality of the students. \"When one begins to turn over the pages\nof the stenographic minutes and speeches made by our prominent leaders, one is\nastonished by the unexpected manifestation of their pedagogical activities.\nEvery author of the thesis proposes the most perfect system of bringing up the\nmasses. But all these systems of 'education' lack provisions for freedom of\nexperiment, for training and for expression of creative abilities by those who\nare to be taught. In this respect also all our pedagogues are behind the\ntimes.\"\"\n\nThere is some evidence that Kollontay's work on behalf of women had a direct\nbearing on her case for the Workers' Opposition. Just as Jacobs was afforded a\ndifferent view of how the city functioned by virtue of her additional roles as\nhousewife and mother, so Kollontay saw the party from the vantage point of an\nadvocate for women whose work was rarely taken seriously. She accused the\nparty of denying women opportunities in organization of \"creative tasks in the\nsphere of production and development of creative abilities\" and of confining\nthem to the \"restricted tasks of home economics, household duties, etc.\"\" Her\nexperience of being patronized and condescended to as a representative of the\nwomen's section seems directly tied to her accusation that the party was also\ntreating the workers as infants rather than as autonomous, creative adults. In\nthe same passage as her charge that the party thought women fit only for home\neconomics, she mocked Trotsky's praise for the workers at a miner's congress,\nwho had voluntarily replaced shop windows, as showing that he wanted to limit\nthem to mere janitorial tasks.\n\nLike Luxemburg, Kollontay believed that the building of socialism could not be\naccomplished by the Central Committee alone, however farseeing it might be.\nThe unions were not mere instruments or transmission belts in the building of\nsocialism; they were to a great extent the subjects and the creators of a\nsocialist mode of production. Kollontay put the fundamental difference\nsuccinctly: \"The Workers' Opposition sees in the unions the managers and\ncreators of the communist economy, whereas Bukharin, together with Lenin and\nTrotsky, leave to them only the role of schools of communism and no more.\"84\n\nKollontay shared Luxemburg's conviction that the practical experience of\nindustrial workers on the factory floor was indispensable knowledge that the\nexperts and technicians needed. She did not want to minimize the role of\nspecialists and officials; they were vital, but they could do their job\neffectively only in a genuine collaboration with the trade unions and workers.\nHer vision of the form this collaboration might take closely resembles that of\nan agricultural extension service and farmers to whose needs the service is\nclosely tied. That is, technical centers concerned with industrial production\nwould be established throughout Russia, but the tasks they addressed and the\nservices they provided would be directly responsive to the demands of the\nproduc- ers.\"5 The experts would serve the producers rather than dictating to\nthem. To this end Kollontay proposed that a host of specialists and officials,\nwho had no practical factory experience and who had joined the party after\n1919, be dismissed-at least until they had done some manual labor.\n\nShe clearly saw, as did Luxemburg, the social and psychological consequences\nof frustrating the independent initiatives of workers. Arguing from concrete\nexamples-workers procuring firewood, establishing a dining hall, and opening a\nnursery-she explained how they were thwarted at every turn by bureaucratic\ndelay and pettifoggery: \"Every independent thought or initiative is treated as\na 'heresy,' as a violation of party discipline, as an attempt to infringe on\nthe prerogatives of the center, which must 'foresee' everything and 'decree'\neverything and anything.\" The harm done came not just from the fact that the\nspecialists and bureaucrats were more likely to make bad decisions. The\nattitude had two other consequences. First, it reflected a \"distrust towards\nthe creative abilities of the workers,\" which was unworthy of the \"professed\nideals of our party.\" Second, and most important, it smothered the morale and\ncreative spirit of the working class. In their frustration at the specialists\nand officials, \"the workers became cynical and said, 'let [the] officials\nthemselves take care of us.'\" The end result was an arbitrary, myopic layer of\nofficials presiding over a dispirited workforce putting in a \"bad-faith\" day\non the factory floor.\",,\n\nKollontay's point of departure, like Luxemburg's, is an assumption about what\nkinds of tasks are the making of revolutions and the creating of new forms of\nproduction. For both of them, such tasks are voyages in uncharted waters.\nThere may be some rules of thumb, but there can be no blueprints or battle\nplans drawn up in advance; the numerous unknowns in the equation make a one-\nstep solution inconceivable. In more technical language, such goals can be\napproached only by a stochastic process of successive approximations, trial\nand error, experiment, and learning through experience. The kind of knowledge\nrequired in such endeavors is not deductive knowledge from first principles\nbut rather what Greeks of the classical period called nietis, a concept to\nwhich we shall return. Usually translated, inadequately, as \"cunning,\" metis\nis better understood as the kind of knowledge that can be acquired only by\nlong practice at similar but rarely identical tasks, which requires constant\nadaptation to changing circumstances. It is to this kind of knowledge that\nLuxemburg appealed when she characterized the building of socialism as \"new\nterritory\" demanding \"improvisation\" and \"creativity.\" It is to this kind of\nknowledge that Kollontay appealed when she insisted that the party leaders\nwere not infallible, that they needed the \"everyday experience\" and \"practical\nwork of the basic class collectives\" of those \"who actually produce and\norganize production at the same timer's' In an analogy that any Marxist would\nrecognize, Kollontay asked whether it was conceivable that the cleverest\nfeudal estate managers could have invented early capitalism by themselves. Of\ncourse not, she answered, because their knowledge and skills were directly\ntied to feudal production, just as the technical specialists of her day had\nlearned their lessons within a capitalist framework. There was simply no\nprecedent for the future now being forged.\n\nEchoing, for rhetorical effect, a sentiment that both Luxemburg and Lenin had\nuttered, Kollontay claimed that \"it is impossible to decree communism. It can\nbe created only in the process of practical research, through mistakes,\nperhaps, but only by the creative powers of the working class itself.\" While\nspecialists and officials had a collaborative role of vital importance, \"only\nthose who are directly bound to industry can introduce into it animating\ninnovations.\"88\n\nFor Lenin, the vanguard party is a machine for making a revolution and then\nfor building socialism-tasks whose main lines have, it is assumed, already\nbeen worked out. For Le Corbusier, the house is a machine for living, and the\ncity planner is a specialist whose knowledge shows him how a city must be\nbuilt. For Le Corbusier, the people are irrelevant to the process of city\nplanning, although the result is designed with their well-being and\nproductivity in mind. Lenin cannot make the revolution without the\nproletariat, but they are seen largely as troops to be deployed. The goals of\nrevolution and scientific socialism are, of course, also for the benefit of\nthe working class. Each of these schemes implies a single, unitary answer\ndiscoverable by specialists and hence a command center, which can, or ought\nto, impose the correct solution.\n\nKollontay and Luxemburg, in contrast, take the tasks at hand to be unknowable\nin advance. Given the uncertainty of the endeavor, a plurality of experiments\nand initiatives will best reveal which lines of attack are fruitful and which\nare barren. The revolution and socialism will fare best, as will Jacobs's\ncity, when they are joint productions between technicians and gifted,\nexperienced amateurs. Above all, there is no strict distinction between means\nand ends. Luxemburg's and Kollontay's vanguard party is not producing a\nrevolution or socialism in the straightforward sense that a factory produces,\nsay, axles. Thus the vanguard party cannot be adequately judged, as a factory\nmight, by its output-by how many axles of a certain quality it makes with a\ngiven labor force, capitalization, and so on-no matter how it goes about\nproducing that result. Also, the vanguard party of Luxemburg and Kollontay is\nat the same time producing a certain kind of working class-a creative,\nconscious, competent, and empowered working class-that is the precondition of\nits achieving any of its other goals. Put positively, the way the trip is made\nmatters at least as much as the destination. Put negatively, a vanguard party\ncan achieve its revolutionary results in ways that defeat its central purpose.\n\n\n# Part 3\n\n## The Social Engineering of Rural  \nSettlement and Production\n\nLegibility is a condition of manipulation. Any substantial state intervention\nin society-to vaccinate a population, produce goods, mobilize labor, tax\npeople and their property, conduct literacy campaigns, conscript soldiers,\nenforce sanitation standards, catch criminals, start universal schooling-\nrequires the invention of units that are visible. The units in question might\nbe citizens, villages, trees, fields, houses, or people grouped according to\nage, depending on the type of intervention. Whatever the units being\nmanipulated, they must be organized in a manner that permits them to be\nidentified, observed, recorded, counted, aggregated, and monitored. The degree\nof knowledge required would have to be roughly commensurate with the depth of\nthe intervention. In other words, one might say that the greater the\nmanipulation envisaged, the greater the legibility required to effect it.\n\nIt was precisely this phenomenon, which had reached full tide by the middle of\nthe nineteenth century, that Proudhon had in mind when he declared, \"To be\nruled is to be kept an eye on, inspected, spied on, regulated, indoctrinated,\nsermonized, listed and checked off, estimated, appraised, censured, ordered\nabout.... To be ruled is at every operation, transaction, movement, to be\nnoted, registered, counted, priced, admonished, prevented, reformed,\nredressed, corrected.\"'\n\nFrom another perspective, what Proudhon was deploring was in fact the great\nachievement of modern statecraft. How hard-won and tenuous this achievement\nwas is worth emphasizing. Most states, to speak broadly, are \"younger\" than\nthe societies that they purport to administer. States therefore confront\npatterns of settlement, social rela tions, and production, not to mention a\nnatural environment, that have evolved largely independent of state plans.'\nThe result is typically a diversity, complexity, and unrepeatability of social\nforms that are relatively opaque to the state, often purposely so. Consider,\nfor a moment, the patterns in such urban settlements as Bruges or the medina\nof an old Middle Eastern city touched on earlier (see chapter 2). Each city,\neach quarter, each neighborhood is unique; it is the historical vector sum of\nmillions of designs and activities. While its form and function surely have a\nlogic, that logic is not derived from any single, overall plan. Its complexity\ndefies easy mapping. Any map, moreover, would be spatially and temporally\nlimited. The map of a single neighborhood would provide little guidance to the\nunique intricacies of the next neighborhood, and a description that was\nsatisfactory today would be inadequate in a few years.\n\nIf the state's goals are minimal, it may not need to know much about the\nsociety. Just as a woodsman who takes only an occasional load of firewood from\na large forest need have no detailed knowledge of that forest, so a state\nwhose demands are confined to grabbing a few carts of grain and the odd\nconscript may not require a very accurate or detailed map of the society. If,\nhowever, the state is ambitious-if it wants to extract as much grain and\nmanpower as it can, short of provoking a famine or a rebellion, if it wants to\ncreate a literate, skilled, and healthy population, if it wants everyone to\nspeak the same language or worship the same god-then it will have to become\nboth far more knowledgeable and far more intrusive.\n\nHow does the state get a handle on the society? Here and in the next two\nchapters, I am especially concerned with the logic behind large-scale attempts\nto redesign rural life and production from above. Seen from the center, the\nroyal court or the seat of state, this process has often been described as a\n\"civilizing process.\"3 I prefer to see it as an attempt at domestication, a\nkind of social gardening devised to make the countryside, its products, and\nits inhabitants more readily identifiable and accessible to the center.\nCertain elements of these efforts at domestication seem, if not universal, at\nleast very common, and they may be termed \"sedentarization,\" \"concentration,\"\nand \"radical simplification\" of both settlement and cultivation.\n\nWe shall examine in some detail two notorious schemes of agrarian\nsimplification-collectivization in Soviet Russia and ujamaa villages in\nTanzania-searching both for the larger political logic of their design and for\nthe reasons behind their manifold failures as schemes of production. First,\nhowever, it may help to provide a schematic illustration of this process from\nthe history of Southeast Asia, which reveals a great continuity of purpose\nthat joins the projects of the precolonial, colonial, and independence regimes\ntogether with the modern state's progressive capacity to realize these\nprojects of planned settlement and production.\n\nThe demography of precolonial Southeast Asia was such that control of land per\nse, unless it was a strategically vital estuary, strait, or pass, was seldom\ndecisive in state building. Control of the populationroughly five persons per\nsquare kilometer in 1700-mattered far more. The key to successful statecraft\nwas typically the ability to attract and hold a substantial, productive\npopulation within a reasonable radius of the court. Given the relative\nsparseness of the population and the ease of physical flight, the control of\narable land was pointless unless there was a population to work it. The\nprecolonial kingdom thus trod a narrow path between a level of taxes and\ncorvee exactions that would sustain a monarch's ambitions and a level that\nwould precipitate wholesale flight. Precolonial wars were more often about\nrounding up captives and settling them near the central court than asserting a\nterritorial claim. A growing, productive population settled in the ambit of a\nmonarch's capital was a more reliable indicator of a kingdom's power than its\nphysical extent.\n\nThe precolonial state was thus vitally interested in the sedentarization of\nits population-in the creation of permanent, fixed settlements. The greater\nthe concentration of people, providing that they produced an economic surplus,\nthe greater the ease of appropriating grain, labor, and military service. At\nthe crudest level, this determinist geographical logic is nothing more than an\napplication of standard theories of location. As Johann Heinrich von Thiinen,\nWalter Christaller, and G. William Skinner have amply demonstrated, the\neconomics of movement, other things being equal, tend to produce recurring\ngeographical patterns of market location, crop specialization, and\nadministrative structure.4 The political appropriation of labor and grain\ntends to obey much the same locational logic, favoring population\nconcentration rather than dispersion and reflecting a logic of appropriation\nbased on transportation costs.' In this context, much of the classical\nliterature on statecraft is preoccupied with the techniques of attracting and\nholding a population in an environment where they can flee to the nearby\nfrontier or settle under the wing of another nearby prince. The expression \"to\nvote with one's feet\" had a literal meaning in much of Southeast Asia.,,\n\nTraditional Thai statecraft hit on a novel technique for minimizing flight and\nattaching commoners to the state or to their noble lords. The Thai devised a\nsystem of tattoos for literally marking commoners with symbols making it clear\nwho \"belonged\" to whom. Such tattooing is evidence that exceptional measures\nwere required to identify and fix a subject population inclined to vote with\nits feet. So common was physical flight that a large number of bounty hunters\nmade a living coursing the forests in search of runaways to return to their\nlawful owners.' Similar problems beset the estates of Roman Catholic friars in\nthe early years of Spain's dominion in the Philippines. The Tagalogs who were\nresettled and organized for supervised production on the Latin American model\nfrequently fled the harsh labor regime. They were known as remontados, that\nis, peasants who had gone \"back up to the hills,\" where they enjoyed more\nautonomy.\n\nMore generally, for precolonial and colonial Southeast Asia, it might be\nhelpful to think in terms of state spaces and nonstate spaces. In the first,\nto put it crudely, the subject population was settled rather densely in quasi-\npermanent communities, producing a surplus of grain (usually of wet rice) and\nlabor which was relatively easily appropriated by the state. In the second,\nthe population was sparsely settled, typically practiced slash-and-burn or\nshifting cultivation, maintained a more mixed economy (including, for example,\npolyculture or reliance on forest products), and was highly mobile, thereby\nseverely limiting the possibilities for reliable state appropriation. State\nspaces and nonstate spaces were not merely preexisting ecological and\ngeographical settings that encouraged or discouraged the formation of states.\nA major objective of would-be rulers was to create and then expand state\nspaces by building irrigation works, capturing subjects in wars, forcing\nsettlement, codifying religions, and so on. The classical state envisaged a\nconcentrated population, within easy range, producing a steady supply of\neasily transportable, storable grain and tribute and providing a surplus of\nmanpower for security, war, and public works.\n\nEdmund Leach's perceptive effort to understand the frontiers of Burma\nimplicitly followed this logic in its reconstruction of the traditional\nBurmese polity. He suggested that we look at the precolonial Burmese state not\nas a physically contiguous territory, as we would in the context of modern\nstates, but as a complex patchwork that followed an entirely different logic.\nWe should picture the kingdom, he insisted, in terms of horizontal slices\nthrough the topography. Following this logic, Burma was, in practice, a\ncollection of all the sedentary, wet-rice producers settled in valleys within\nthe ambit of the court center. These would be, in the terms suggested above,\nthe state spaces. The next horizontal stratum of the landscape from, say, five\nhundred feet to fifteen hundred feet would, given its different ecology,\ncontain in habitants who practiced shifting cultivation, were more widely\nscattered, and were therefore less promising subjects of appropriation. They\nwere not an integral part of the kingdom, although they might regularly send\ntribute to the central court. Still higher elevations would constitute yet\nother ecological, political, and cultural zones. What Leach proposed, in\neffect, is that we consider all relatively dense, wet-rice settlements within\nrange of the capital as \"the kingdom\" and the rest, even if relatively close\nto the capital, as \"nonstate spaces.\"8\n\nThe role of statecraft in this context becomes that of maximizing the\nproductive, settled population in such state spaces while at the same time\ndrawing tribute from, or at least neutralizing, the nonstate spaces.`' These\nstateless zones have always played a potentially subversive role, both\nsymbolically and practically. From the vantage point of the court, such spaces\nand their inhabitants were the exemplars of rudeness, disorder, and barbarity\nagainst which the civility, order, and sophistication of the center could be\ngauged.10 Such spaces, it goes without saying, have served as refuges for\nfleeing peasants, rebels, bandits, and the pretenders who have often\nthreatened kingdoms.\n\nOf course, the ecology of different elevations is only one among many factors\nthat might characterize nonstate spaces. They also appear to share one or more\nof the following distinctive features: they are relatively impenetrable (wild,\ntrackless, labyrinthine, inhospitable); their population is dispersed or\nmigratory; and they are unpromising sites for surplus appropriation.\" Thus\nmarshes and swamps (one thinks of the now beleaguered Marsh Arabs on the\nIraqi-Iranian border), ever-shifting deltas and estuaries, mountains, deserts\n(favored by nomadic Berbers and Bedouins), and the sea (home to the so-called\nsea gypsies of southern Burma), and, more generally, the frontier have all\nserved as \"nonstate spaces\" in the sense that I have been using the term.12\n\nContemporary development schemes, whether in Southeast Asia or elsewhere,\nrequire the creation of state spaces where the government can reconfigure the\nsociety and economy of those who are to be \"developed.\" The transformation of\nperipheral nonstate spaces into state spaces by the modern, developmentalist\nnation-state is ubiquitous and, for the inhabitants of such spaces, frequently\ntraumatic. Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing's sensitive account of the attempts of the\nIndonesian state to capture, as it were, the nomadic Meratus hill peoples of\nKalimantan describes a striking case in point. The Meratus live, as she notes,\nin an area that, \"so far, has eluded the clarity and visibility required for\nmodel development schemes.\" As migratory hunter-gatherers who at the same time\npractice shifting cultivation, who live in con stantly changing kinship units,\nwho are widely dispersed over a demanding terrain, and who are, in Indonesian\neyes, pagans, the Meratus are a tough case for development. Indonesian\nofficials have tried, in their desultory fashion, to concentrate the Meratus\nin planned villages near the main roads. The implicit goal was to create a\nfixed, concentrated population that officials in charge of the management of\nisolated populations could see and instruct when touring the district.13\nMeratus immobility was the precondition of state supervision and development,\nwhereas much of the identity of the Meratus as a people depended on\n\"unhampered mobility\" 14\n\nThe inaccessibility of the Meratus was, in state-development parlance and in\nthe eyes of government officials, an index of their lamentable backwardness.\nThey were described by their would-be civilizers as \"not yet arranged\" or \"not\nyet ordered\" (belum di-ator), as \"not yet brought to religion\" (belum\nberugama), and their cultivation practices were described as \"disorderly\nagriculture\" (pertanian yang tidak ter- atur). For their part, the Meratus\ngrasped the essentials of what the government had in mind for them. They had\nbeen asked to settle along the main tracks through the forest, one local\nleader observed, \"so the government can see the people.\" The clustered houses\nthey were asked to settle in were meant, they believed, to \"look good if the\ngovernment came to visit.\"\" Cast in a discourse of development, progress, and\ncivilization, the plans of the Indonesian state for the Meratus peoples are at\nthe same time a synoptic project of legibility and concentration.\n\nIt is in the context of actual rebellion where the effort to create and\nsharply distinguish state spaces from nonstate spaces is carried to its\nlogical conclusion. The nature of military threat requires clearly defined and\neasily monitored and patrolled state spaces, such as forts, forced\nsettlements, or internment camps. Modern examples of this can be found in the\nso-called new villages in Malaya during the Emergency following World War II,\nwhich were designed particularly to sequester a Chinese smallholder and\nrubber-tapping population and prevent it from providing manpower, food, cash,\nand supplies to a largely Chinese guerrilla force in the hinterland beyond. In\nan arrangement later copied in the \"strategic hamlets\" in Vietnam, the\nreluctant residents were lodged in identical, numbered houses arrayed in\nstraight lines.16 The population's movement in and out was strictly monitored.\nThey were one short step away from the concentration camps built in wartime to\ncreate and maintain a legible, bounded, concentrated state space and seal it\noff as completely as possible from the outside. Here, direct control and\ndiscipline are more important than appropriation. In recent times there have\nbeen unprecedented efforts to reclaim non state space for the state. In any\ncase, that is one way to characterize the massive use of Agent Orange to\ndefoliate large sections of forest during the Vietnam War, thus render the\nforest legible and safe (for government forces, that is).\n\nThe concept of state spaces, suitably modified for the context of a market\neconomy, can also help us to resolve an apparent paradox in colonial agrarian\npolicy in Southeast Asia. How do we explain the decided colonial preference\nfor plantation agriculture over smallholder production? The grounds for the\nchoice can certainly not have been efficiency. For almost any crop one can\nname, with the possible exception of sugarcane,\" smallholders have been able\nhistorically to out-compete larger units of production. Time and time again,\nthe colonial states found, small producers, owing to their low fixed costs and\nflexible use of family labor, could consistently undersell state-managed or\nprivate-sector plantations.\n\nThe paradox is largely resolved, I believe, if we consider the \"efficiencies\"\nof the plantation as a unit of taxation (both taxes on profits and various\nexport levies), of labor discipline and surveillance, and of political\ncontrol. Take, for example, rubber production in colonial Malaya. At the\nbeginning of the rubber boom in the first decade of the twentieth century,\nBritish officials and investors no doubt believed that rubber produced by\nestates, which had better planting stock, better scientific management, and\nmore available labor, would prove more efficient and profitable than rubber\nproduced by smallholders.',, When they discovered they were wrong, however,\nofficials persisted in systematically favoring rubber estates at some\nconsiderable cost to the overall economy of the colony. The infamous Stevenson\nscheme in Malaya during the worldwide depression was a particularly blatant\nattempt to preserve the failing estate sector of the rubber industry by\nlimiting smallholder production. Without it, most estates would have perished.\n\nThe fact that, in protecting the estate sector, the colonizers were also\nprotecting the interests of their countrymen and those of metropolitan\ninvestors was only one factor in explaining their policy. If it were the main\nreason, one would expect the policy to lapse with the country's independence.\nAs we shall shortly see, it did not. The plantations, although less efficient\nthan smallholders as producers, were far more convenient as units of taxation.\nIt was easier to monitor and tax large, publicly-owned businesses than to do\nso for a vast swarm of small growers who were here today and gone tomorrow and\nwhose landholdings, production, and profits were illegible to the state. But\nbecause plantations specialized in a single crop, it was a simple matter to\nassess their production and profits. A second advantage of estate rubber\nproduction was that it typically provided centralized forms of residence and\nlabor that were far more amenable to central political and administrative\ncontrol. Estates were, in a word, far more legible communities than were the\nMalay kampung, which had its own history, leadership, and mixed economy.\n\nA comparable logic can be usefully applied to the establishment of federal\nland schemes in independent Malaysia. Why did the Malaysian state elect to\nestablish large, costly, bureaucratically monitored settlements in the 1960s\nand 1970s when the frontier was already being actively pioneered by large-\nscale voluntary migration? Pioneer settlement cost the state virtually nothing\nand had historically created viable household enterprises that grew and\nmarketed cash crops. As an economic proposition, the huge rubber and palm oil\nconcerns established by the government made little sense. They were enormously\ncostly to set up, the capital expenditure per settler being far beyond what a\nrational businessman would have invested.\n\nPolitically and administratively, however, the advantages of these large,\ncentrally planned, and centrally run government schemes were manifold. At a\ntime when the attempted revolution of the Malayan Communist Party was still\nfresh in the minds of the country's Malay rulers, planned settlements had some\nof the advantages of strategic hamlets. They were laid out according to a\nsimple grid pattern and were immediately legible to an outside official. The\nhouse lots were numbered consecutively, and the inhabitants were registered\nand monitored far more closely than in open frontier areas. Malaysian settlers\ncould be, and were, carefully selected for age, skills, and political\nreliability; villagers in the state of Kedah, where I worked in the late\n1970s, understood that if they wanted to be selected for a settlement scheme,\nthey needed a recommendation from a local politician of the ruling party.\n\nThe administrative and economic situation of the Malaysian settlers was\ncomparable to that of the \"company towns\" of early industrialization, where\neveryone worked at comparable jobs, were paid by the same boss, lived in\ncompany housing, and shopped at the same company store. Until the plantation\ncrops were mature, the settlers were paid a wage. Their production was\nmarketed through state channels, and they could be dismissed for any one of a\nlarge number of infractions against the rules established by the scheme's\nofficials. The economic dependency and direct political control meant that\nsuch schemes could regularly be made to produce large electoral majorities for\nthe ruling party. Collective protest was rare and could usually be snuffed out\nby the sanctions available to the administrators. It goes without saying that\nthe settlements of the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) allowed the\nstate to control the mix of export crops, to monitor production and\nprocessing, and to set producer prices in order to generate revenue.\n\nThe publicly stated rationale for planned settlement schemes was almost always\ncouched in the discourse of orderly development and social services (such as\nthe provision of health clinics, sanitation, adequate housing, education,\nclean water, and infrastructure). The public rhetoric was not intentionally\ninsincere; it was, however, misleadingly silent about the manifold ways in\nwhich orderly development of this kind served important goals of\nappropriation, security, and political hegemony that could not have been met\nthrough autonomous frontier settlement. FELDA schemes were \"soft\" civilian\nversions of the new villages created as part of counterinsurgency policy. The\ndividend they paid was less an economic return than a dividend in expanding\nstate spaces.\n\nState plans of sedentarization and planned settlement have rarely gone as\nanticipated-in Malaysia or elsewhere. Like the scientific forest or the grid\ncity, the targets of development have habitually escaped the fine-tuned\ncontrol aspired to by their inventors. But we must never overlook the fact\nthat the effect of these schemes, however inflected by local practice, lies as\nmuch in what they replace as in the degree to which they live up to their own\nrhetoric.\n\nThe concentration of population in planned settlements may not create what\nstate planners had in mind, but it has almost always disrupted or destroyed\nprior communities whose cohesion derived mostly from nonstate sources. The\ncommunities thus superseded-however objectionable they may have been on\nnormative grounds-were likely to have had their own unique histories, social\nties, mythology, and capacity for joint action. Virtually by definition, the\nstate-designated settlement must start from the beginning to build its own\nsources of cohesion and joint action. A new community is thus, also by\ndefinition, a community demobilized, and hence a community more amenable to\ncontrol from above and outside.\"\n\n\n# 6 Soviet Collectivization,  \nCapitalist Dreams\n\n![](img0037.jpg)\n\nThe master builders of Soviet society were rather more like Niemeyer designing\nBrasilia than Baron Haussmann retrofitting Paris. A combination of defeat in\nwar, economic collapse, and a revolution had provided the closest thing to a\nbulldozed site that a state builder ever gets. The result was a kind of\nultrahigh modernism that in its audacity recalled the utopian aspects of its\nprecursor, the French Revolution.\n\nThis is not the place, nor am I the most knowledgeable guide, for an extensive\ndiscussion of Soviet high modernism.' What I aim to do, instead, is to\nemphasize the cultural and aesthetic elements in Soviet high modernism. This\nwill in turn pave the way for an examination of an illuminating point of\ndirect contact between Soviet and American high modernism: the belief in huge,\nmechanized, industrial farms.\n\nIn certain vital respects, Soviet high modernism is not a sharp break from\nRussian absolutism. Ernest Gellner has argued that of the two facets of the\nEnlightenment-the one asserting the sovereignty of the individual and his\ninterests, the other commending the rational authority of experts-it was the\nsecond that spoke to rulers who wanted their \"backward\" states to catch up.\nThe Enlightenment arrived in Central Europe, he concludes, as a \"centralizing\nrather than a liberating force.\"'\n\nStrong historical echoes of Leninist high modernism can thus be found in what\nRichard Stites calls the \"administrative utopianism\" of the Russian czars and\ntheir advisers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This administrative\nutopianism found expression in a succession of schemes to organize the\npopulation (serfs, soldiers, workers, functionaries) into institutions \"based\nupon hierarchy, discipline, regimentation, strict order, rational planning, a\ngeometrical environment, and a form of welfarism.\"3 Peter the Great's Saint\nPetersburg was the urban realization of this vision. The city was laid out\naccording to a strict rectilinear and radial plan on completely new terrain.\nIts straight boulevards were, by design, twice as wide as the tallest\nbuilding, which was, naturally, at the geometric center of the city. The\nbuildings themselves reflected function and hierarchy, as the facade, height,\nand material of each corresponded to the social class of its inhabitants. The\ncity's physical layout was in fact a legible map of its intended social\nstructure.\n\nSaint Petersburg had many counterparts, urban and rural. Under Catherine the\nGreat, Prince Grigory Potemkin established a whole series of model cities\n(such as Ekaterinoslav) and model rural settlements. The next two czars, Paul\nand Alexander I, inherited Catherine's passion for Prussian order and\nefficiency.4 Their adviser, Alexei Arakcheev, established a model estate on\nwhich peasants wore uniforms and followed elaborate instructions on upkeep and\nmaintenance, to the point of carrying \"punishment books\" inscribed with\nrecords of their violations. This estate was made the basis of a far bolder\nplan for a network of widely scattered, self-sufficient military colonies,\nwhich by the late 1820s included 750,000 people. This attempt to create a new\nRussia, in contrast to the disorder, mobility, and flux of a frontier society,\nquickly succumbed to popular resistance, corruption, and inefficiency. Long\nbefore the Bolsheviks took power, in any case, the historical landscape was\nlittered with the wreckage of many miscarried experiments in authoritarian\nsocial planning.\n\nLenin and his confederates could implement their high-modernist plans starting\nfrom nearly zero. The war, the revolution, and the subsequent famine had gone\na long way toward dissolving the prerevolutionary society, particularly in the\ncities. A general collapse of industrial production had provoked a vast exodus\nfrom the cities and a virtual regression to a barter economy. The ensuing\nfour-year civil war further dissolved existing social ties as well as\nschooling the hard-pressed Bolsheviks in the methods of \"war\nCommunism\"-requisitions, martial law, coercion.\n\nWorking on a leveled social terrain and harboring high-modernist ambitions in\nkeeping with the distinction of being the pioneers of the first socialist\nrevolution, the Bolsheviks thought big. Nearly everything they planned was on\na monumental scale, from cities and individual buildings (the Palace of\nSoviets) to construction projects (the White Sea Canal) and, later, the great\nindustrial projects of the first Five Year Plan (Magnitogorsk), not to mention\ncollectivization. Sheila Fitzpatrick has appropriately called this passion for\nsheer size \"giganto- mania.\"5 The economy itself was conceived as a well-\nordered machine, where everyone would simply produce goods of the description\nand quantity specified by the central state's statistical bureau, as Lenin had\nforeseen.\n\nA transformation of the physical world was not, however, the only item on the\nBolshevik agenda. It was a cultural revolution that they sought, the creation\nof a new person. Members of the secular intelligentsia were the most devoted\npartisans of this aspect of the revolution. Campaigns to promote atheism and\nto suppress Christian rituals were pressed in the villages. New\n\"revolutionary\" funeral and marriage ceremonies were invented amidst much\nfanfare, and a ritual of \"Octobering\" was encouraged as an alternative to\nbaptism.6 Cremation -rational, clean, economical-was promoted. Along with this\nsecularization came enormous and widely popular campaigns to promote education\nand literacy. Architects and social planners invented new communal living\narrangements designed to supersede the bourgeois family pattern. Communal\nfood, laundry, and child-care services promised to free women from the\ntraditional division of labor. Housing arrangements were explicitly intended\nto be \"social condensers.\"\n\nThe \"new man\"-the Bolshevik specialist, engineer, or functionarycame to\nrepresent a new code of social ethics, which was sometimes simply called\nkultura. In keeping with the cult of technology and science, kultura\nemphasized punctuality, cleanliness, businesslike directness, polite modesty,\nand good, but never showy, manners.' It was this understanding of kultura and\nthe party's passion for the League of Time, with its promotion of time\nconsciousness, efficient work habits, and clock-driven routine, that were so\nbrilliantly caricatured in Eugene Zamiatin's novel We and that later became\nthe inspiration for George Orwell's 1984.\n\nWhat strikes an outside observer of this revolution in culture and\narchitecture is its emphasis on public form-on getting the visual and\naesthetic dimensions of the new world straight. One can perhaps see this best\nin what Stites calls the \"festivals of mustering\" organized by the cultural\nimpresario of the early Soviet state, Anatoly Lunacharsky.x In the outdoor\ndramas he produced, the revolution was reenacted on a scale that must have\nseemed as large as the original, with cannons, bands, searchlights, ships on\nthe river, four thousand actors, and thirty-five thousand spectators.`'\nWhereas the actual revolution had all the usual messiness of reality, the\nreenactment called for military precision, and the various actors were\norganized by platoon and mobi lized with semaphore and field telephones. Like\nmass exercises, the public spectacle gave a retroactive order, purpose, and\ncentral direction to the events, which were designed to impress the spectator,\nnot to reflect the historical facts.10 If one can see in Arakcheev's military\ncolonies an attempt to prefigure, to represent, a wished-for order, then\nperhaps Lunacharsky's staged revolution can be seen as a representation of the\nwished-for relationship between the Bolsheviks and the proletarian crowd.\nLittle effort was spared to see that the ceremony turned out right. When\nLunacharsky himself complained that churches were being demolished for the May\nDay celebrations, Lazar Kagan- ivich, the city boss of Moscow, replied, \"And\nmy aesthetics demand that the demonstration processions from the six districts\nof Moscow should all pour into Red Square at the same time.\"' I In\narchitecture, public manners, urban design, and public ritual, the emphasis on\na visible, rational, disciplined social facade seemed to prevail.12 Stites\nsuggests that there is some inverse relation between this public face of order\nand purpose and the near anarchy that reigned in society at large: \"As in the\ncase of all such utopias, its organizers described it in rational, symmetrical\nterms, in the mathematical language of planning, control figures, statistics,\nprojections and precise commands. As in the vision of military colonies, which\nthe utopian plan faintly resembled, its rational facade barely obscured the\noceans of misery, disorder, chaos, corruption and whimsicality that went with\nit.\"3\n\nOne possible implication of Stites's assertion is that, in some circumstances,\nwhat I call the miniaturization of order may be substituted for the real\nthing. A facade or a small, easily managed zone of order and conformity may\ncome to be an end in itself; the representation may usurp the reality.\nMiniatures and small experiments have, of course, an important role in\nstudying larger phenomena. Model aircraft built to scale and wind tunnels are\nessential steps in the design of new airplanes. But when the two are confused-\nwhen, say, the general mistakes the parade ground for the battlefield itself-\nthe consequences are potentially disastrous.\n\n#### A Soviet-American Fetish: Industrial Farming\n\nBefore plunging into a discussion of the practice and logic of Soviet\ncollectivization, we should recognize that the rationalization of farming on a\nhuge, even national, scale was part of a faith shared by social engineers and\nagricultural planners throughout the world. 14 And they were conscious of\nbeing engaged in a common endeavor. Like the architects of the Congres\nInternationaux d'Architecture Moderne, they kept in touch through journals,\nprofessional conferences, and exhibitions. The connections were strongest\nbetween American agronomists and their Russian colleagues-connections that\nwere not entirely broken even during the Cold War. Working in vastly different\neconomic and political environments, the Russians tended to be envious of the\nlevel of capitalization, particularly in mechanization, of American farms\nwhile the Americans were envious of the political scope of Soviet planning.\nThe degree to which they were working together to create a new world of large-\nscale, rational, industrial agriculture can be judged by this brief account of\ntheir relationship.\n\nThe high tide of enthusiasm for applying industrial methods to agriculture in\nthe United States stretched roughly from 1910 to the end of the 1930s.\nAgricultural engineers, a new specialty, were the main carriers of this\nenthusiasm; influenced by currents in their parent discipline, industrial\nengineering, and most particularly by the doctrines of the prophet of time-\nmotion studies, Frederick Taylor, they reconceptualized the farm as a \"food\nand fiber factory.\"\" Taylorist principles of scientifically measuring work\nprocesses in order to break them down into simple, repetitive motions that an\nunskilled worker could learn quickly might work well enough on the factory\nfloor,16 but their application to the variegated and nonrepetitive\nrequirements of growing crops was questionable. Agricultural engineers\ntherefore turned to those aspects of farm operation that might be more easily\nstandardized. They tried to rationalize the layout of farm buildings, to\nstandardize machinery and tools, and to promote the mechanization of major\ngrain crops.\n\nThe professional instincts of the agricultural engineers led them to try to\nreplicate as much as possible the features of the modern factory. This\nimpelled them to insist on enlarging the scale of the typical small farm so\nthat it could mass-produce standard agricultural commodities, mechanize its\noperation, and thereby, it was thought, greatly reduce the unit cost of\nproduction.\"\n\nAs we shall see later, the industrial model was applicable to some, but not\nall, of agriculture. It was nonetheless applied indiscriminately as a creed\nrather than a scientific hypothesis to be examined skeptically. The modernist\nconfidence in huge scale, centralization of production, standardized mass\ncommodities, and mechanization was so hegemonic in the leading sector of\nindustry that it became an article of faith that the same principles would\nwork, pari passu, in agriculture.\n\nMany efforts were made to put this faith to the test. Perhaps the most\naudacious was the Thomas Campbell \"farm\" in Montana, begun -or, perhaps I\nshould say, founded-in 1918.18 It was an industrial farm in more than one\nrespect. Shares were sold by prospectuses describing the enterprise as an\n\"industrial opportunity\"; J. P. Morgan, the financier, helped to raise $2\nmillion from the public. The Montana Farming Corporation was a monster wheat\nfarm of ninety-five thousand acres, much of it leased from four Native\nAmerican tribes. Despite the private investment, the enterprise would never\nhave gotten off the ground without help and subsidies from the Department of\nInterior and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nProclaiming that farming was about 90 percent engineering and only 10 percent\nagriculture, Campbell set about standardizing as much of his operation as\npossible. He grew wheat and flax, two hardy crops that needed little if any\nattention between planting and harvest time.19 The land he farmed was the\nagricultural equivalent of the bulldozed site of Brasilia. It was virgin soil,\nwith a natural fertility that would eliminate the need for fertilizer. The\ntopography also vastly simplified matters: it was flat, with no forests,\ncreeks, rocks, or ridges that would impede the smooth course of machinery over\nits surface. In other words, the selection of the simplest, most standardized\ncrops and the leasing of something very close to a blank agricultural space\nwere calculated to favor the application of industrial methods. In the first\nyear Campbell bought thirty-three tractors, forty binders, ten threshing\nmachines, four combines, and one hundred wagons; he employed about fifty men\nmost of the year, but hired as many as two hundred during the peak season.20\n\nThis is not the place to chronicle the fortunes of the Montana Farming\nCorporation, and in any event Deborah Fitzgerald has done so splendidly.\"\nSuffice it to note that a drought in the second year and the elimination of a\ngovernment support for prices the following year led to a collapse that cost\nJ. P. Morgan $1 million. The Campbell farm faced other problems besides\nweather and prices: soil differences, labor turnover, the difficulty of\nfinding skilled, resourceful workers who would need little supervision.\nAlthough the corporation struggled on until Campbell's death in 1966, it\nprovided no evidence that industrial farms were superior to family farms in\nefficiency and profitability. The advantages industrial farms did have over\nsmaller producers were of another kind. Their very size gave them an edge in\naccess to credit, political influence (relevant to taxes, support payments,\nand the avoidance of foreclosure), and marketing muscle. What they gave away\nin agility and quality labor they often made up for in their considerable\npolitical and economic clout.\n\nMany large industrial farms managed along scientific lines were established in\nthe 1920s and 1930s.22 Some of them were the stepchil dren of depression\nforeclosures that left banks and insurance companies holding many farms they\ncould not sell. Such \"chain farms,\" consisting of as many as six hundred\nfarmsteads organized into one integrated operation (one farm to farrow pigs,\nsay, and another to feed them out, along the lines of contemporary \"contract\nfarming\" for poultry), were quite common, and buying into them was a\nspeculative in- vestment.23 They proved no more competitive to the family farm\nthan did Campbell's corporation. In fact, they were so highly capitalized that\nthey were vulnerable to unfavorable credit markets and lower farm gate prices,\ngiven their high fixed costs in payroll and interest. The family farm could,\nby contrast, more easily tighten its belt and move into a subsistence mode.\n\nThe most striking proposal designed to reconcile the American small-property\nregime with huge economies of scale and scientific, centralized management was\nthat of Mordecai Ezekial and Sherman Johnson in 1930. They outlined a\n\"national farming corporation\" that would incorporate all farms. It would be\nvertically integrated and centralized and \"could move raw farming materials\nthrough the individual farms of the country, could establish production goals\nand quotas, distribute machinery, labor and capital, and move farm products\nfrom one region to another for processing and use. Bearing a striking\nresemblance to the industrial world, this organizational plan was a sort of\ngigantic conveyor belt.\"24 Ezekial was no doubt influenced by his recent tour\nof Russian collective farms as well as by the plight of the depression-\nstricken economy. Johnson and Ezekial were hardly alone in calling for\ncentralized industrial farming on a massive scale, not just as a response to\neconomic crisis but as a matter of confidence in an ineluctable high-modernist\nfuture. The following expression of that confidence is fairly representative:\n\"Collectivization is posed by history and economics. Politically, the small\nfarmer or peasant is a drag on progress. Technically, he is as antiquated as\nthe small machinists who once put automobiles together by hand in little\nwooden sheds. The Russians have been the first to see this clearly, and to\nadapt themselves to historical necessity.\"25\n\nBehind these admiring references to Russia was less a specifically political\nideology than a shared high-modernist faith. That faith was reinforced by\nsomething on the order of an improvised, high-modernist exchange program. A\ngreat many Russian agronomists and engineers came to the United States, which\nthey regarded as the Mecca of industrial farming. Their tour of American\nagriculture nearly always included a visit to Campbell's Montana Farming\nCorporation and to M. L. Wilson, who in 1928 headed the Department of\nAgricultural Eco nomics at Montana State University and later became a high-\nlevel official in the Department of Agriculture under Henry Wallace. The\nRussians were so taken with Campbell's farm that they said they would provide\nhim with 1 million acres if he would come to the Soviet Union and demonstrate\nhis farming methods.26\n\nTraffic in the other direction was just as brisk. The Soviet Union had hired\nthousands of American technicians and engineers to help in the design of\nvarious elements of Soviet industrial production, including the production of\ntractors and other farm machinery. By 1927, the Soviet Union had also\npurchased twenty-seven thousand American tractors. Many of the American\nvisitors, such as Ezekial, admired Soviet state farms, which by 1930 offered\nthe promise of collectivized agriculture on a massive scale. The Americans\nwere impressed not just by the sheer size of the state farms but also by the\nfact that technical specialists -agronomists, economists, engineers,\nstatisticians -were, it seemed, developing Russian production along rational,\negalitarian lines. The failure of the Western market economy in 1930\nreinforced the attractiveness of the Soviet experiment. Visitors traveling in\neither direction returned to their own country thinking that they had seen the\nfuture.27\n\nAs Deborah Fitzgerald and Lewis Feuer argue, the attraction that\ncollectivization held for American agricultural modernizers had little to do\nwith a belief in Marxism or an affinity for Soviet life.28 \"Rather it was\nbecause the Soviet idea of growing wheat on an industrial scale and in an\nindustrial fashion was similar to American ideas about the direction American\nagriculture should take .\"29 Soviet collectivization represented, to these\nAmerican viewers, an enormous demonstration project without the political\ninconveniences of American institutions; \"that is, the Americans viewed the\ngiant Soviet farms as huge experiment stations on which Americans could try\nout their most radical ideas for increasing agricultural production, and, in\nparticular, wheat production. Many of the things they wished to learn more\nabout simply could not be tried in America, partly because it would cost too\nmuch, partly because no suitable large farmsite was available, and partly\nbecause many farmers and farm laborers would be alarmed at the implications of\nthis experimentation.\"30 The hope was that the Soviet experiment would be to\nAmerican industrial agronomy more or less what the Tennessee Valley Authority\nwas to be to American regional planning: a proving ground and a possible model\nfor adoption.\n\nAlthough Campbell did not accept the Soviet offer of a vast demonstration\nfarm, others did. M. L. Wilson, Harold Ware (who had extensive experience in\nthe Soviet Union), and Guy Riggin were invited to plan a huge mechanized wheat\nfarm of some 500,000 acres of virgin land. It would be, Wilson wrote to a\nfriend, the largest mechanized wheat farm in the world. They planned the\nentire farm layout, labor force, machinery needs, crop rotations, and lockstep\nwork schedule in a Chicago hotel room in two weeks in December 1928.31 The\nfact that they imagined that such a farm could be planned in a Chicago hotel\nroom underlines their presumption that the key issues were abstract, technical\ninterrelationships that were context-free. As Fitzgerald perceptively\nexplains: \"Even in the U.S., those plans would have been optimistic, actually,\nbecause they were based on an unrealistic idealization of nature and human\nbehavior. And insofar as the plans represented what the Americans would do if\nthey had millions of acres of flat land, lots of laborers, and a government\ncommitment to spare no expense in meeting production goals, the plans were\ndesigned for an abstract, theoretical kind of place. This agricultural place,\nwhich did not correspond to America, Russia, or any other actual location,\nobeyed the laws of physics and chemistry, recognized no political or\nideological stance.\"32\n\nThe giant sovkhoz, named Verblud, which they established near Rostov-on-Don,\none thousand miles south of Moscow, comprised 375,000 acres that were to be\nsown to wheat. As an economic proposition, it was an abject failure, although\nin the early years it did produce large quantities of wheat. The detailed\nreasons for the failure are of less interest for our purposes than the fact\nthat most of them could be summarized under the rubric of context. It was the\nspecific context of this specific farm that defeated them. The farm, unlike\nthe plan, was not a hypothecated, generic, abstract farm but an unpredictable,\ncomplex, and particular farm, with its own unique combination of soils, social\nstructure, administrative culture, weather, political strictures, machinery,\nroads, and the work skills and habits of its employees. As we shall see, it\nresembled Brasilia in being the kind of failure typical of ambitious high-\nmodernist schemes for which local knowledge, practice, and context are\nconsidered irrelevant or at best an annoyance to be circumvented.\n\n#### Collectivization in Soviet Russia\n\nWhat we have here isn't a mechanism, it's people living here. You can't get\nthem squared around until they get themselves arranged. I used to think of the\nrevolution as a steam engine, but now I see that it's not.\n\n-Andrei Platonov, Chevengur\n\nThe collectivization of Soviet agriculture was an extreme but diagnostic case\nof authoritarian high-modernist planning. It represented an unprecedented\ntransformation of agrarian life and production, and it was imposed by all the\nbrute force at the state's disposal. The officials who directed this massive\nchange, moreover, were operating in relative ignorance of the ecological,\nsocial, and economic arrangements that underwrote the rural economy. They were\nflying blind.\n\nBetween early 1930 and 1934, the Soviet state waged a virtual war in the\ncountryside. Realizing that he could not depend on the rural Soviets to\n\"liquidate the kulaks\" and collectivize, Stalin dispatched twenty-five\nthousand battle-tested, urban Communists and proletarians with full powers to\nrequisition grain, arrest resistors, and collectivize. He was convinced that\nthe peasantry was trying to bring down the Soviet state. In reply to a\npersonal letter from Mikhail Sholokhov (author of And Quiet Flows the Don)\nalerting him to the fact that peasants along the Don were on the verge of\nstarvation, Stalin replied, \"The esteemed grain growers of your district (and\nnot only of your district alone) carried on an 'Italian strike' (ital'ianka),\nsabotage!, and were not loathe to leave the workers and the Red Army without\nbread. That the sabotage was quiet and outwardly harmless (without bloodshed)\ndoes not change the fact that the esteemed grain growers waged what was\nvirtually a 'quiet' war against Soviet power. A war of starvation, dear\ncomrade Sholokhov.\"33\n\nThe human costs of that war are still in dispute, but they were undeniably\ngrievous. Estimates of the death toll alone, as a result of the\n\"dekulakization\" and collectivization campaigns and the ensuing famine, range\nfrom a \"modest\" 3 or 4 million to, as some current Soviet figures indicate,\nmore than 20 million. The higher estimates have, if anything, gained more\ncredibility as new archival material has become available. Behind the deaths\nrose a level of social disruption and violence that often exceeded that of the\ncivil war immediately following the revolution. Millions fled to the cities or\nto the frontier, the infamous gulag was vastly enlarged, open rebellion and\nfamine raged in much of the countryside, and more than half of the nation's\nlivestock (and draft power) was slaughtered.34\n\nBy 1934, the state had \"won\" its war with the peasantry. If ever a war earned\nthe designation \"Pyrrhic victory,\" this is the one. The sovkhoz (state farms)\nand kolkhoz (collective farms) failed to deliver on any of the specifically\nsocialist goals envisioned by Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, and most Bolsheviks.\nThey were an evident failure in raising the level of grain production or of\nproducing cheap and abundant foodstuffs for an urban, industrializing\nworkforce. They failed to become the technically efficient and innovative\nfarms that Lenin had anticipated. Even in the realm of electrification,\nLenin's touchstone of modernization, only one in twenty-five collective farms\nhad electricity by the eve of World War II. By no measure had the\ncollectivization of agriculture created \"new men and women\" in the countryside\nor abolished the cultural difference between the country and the city. For the\nnext half-century, the yields per hectare of many crops were stagnant or\nactually inferior to the levels recorded in the 1920s or the levels reached\nbefore the Revolution.35\n\nAt another level, collectivization was, in a curious state-centric way, a\nqualified success. Collectivization proved a rough-and-ready instrument for\nthe twin goals of traditional statecraft: appropriation and political control.\nThough the Soviet kolkhoz may have failed badly at generating huge surpluses\nof foodstuffs, it served well enough as a means whereby the state could\ndetermine cropping patterns, fix real rural wages, appropriate a large share\nof whatever grain was produced, and politically emasculate the countryside.36\n\nThe great achievement, if one can call it that, of the Soviet state in the\nagricultural sector was to take a social and economic terrain singularly\nunfavorable to appropriation and control and to create institutional forms and\nproduction units far better adapted to monitoring, managing, appropriating,\nand controlling from above. The rural society that the Soviet state inherited\n(and for a time encouraged) was one in which the allies of the czarist state,\nthe great landlords and the aristocratic officeholders, had been swept away\nand been replaced by smallholding and middle peasants, artisans, private\ntraders, and all sorts of mobile laborers and lumpen elements.37 Confronting a\ntumultuous, footloose, and \"headless\" (acephalous) rural society which was\nhard to control and which had few political assets, the Bolsheviks, like the\nscientific foresters, set about redesigning their environment with a few\nsimple goals in mind. They created, in place of what they had inherited, a new\nlandscape of large, hierarchical, state-managed farms whose cropping patterns\nand procurement quotas were centrally mandated and whose population was, by\nlaw, immobile. The system thus devised served for nearly sixty years as a\nmechanism for procurement and control at a massive cost in stagnation, waste,\ndemoralization, and ecological failure.\n\nThat collectivized agriculture persisted for sixty years was a tribute less to\nthe plan of the state than to the improvisations, gray markets, bartering, and\ningenuity that partly compensated for its failures. Just as an \"informal\nBrasilia,\" which had no legitimate place in official plans, arose to make the\ncity viable, so did a set of informal practices lying outside the formal\ncommand economy-and often outside Soviet law as well-arise to circumvent some\nof the colossal waste and inefficiencies built into the system. Collectivized\nagriculture, in other words, never quite operated according to the\nhierarchical grid of its production plans and procurements.\n\nWhat seems clear, in the brief account that follows, is that collectivization\nper se cannot be laid solely at the feet of Stalin, though he bore much\nresponsibility for its exceptional speed and brutality.3R A collectivized\nagriculture was always part of the Bolshevik map of the future, and the great\nprocurement struggles of the late 1920s could hardly have had any other\noutcome in the context of the decision to pursue forced-draft\nindustrialization. The party's high-modernist faith in great collectivist\nschemes survived long after the desperate improvisations of the early 1930s.\nThat faith, which claimed to be both aesthetic and scientific, is clearly\nvisible in a much later agrarian highmodernist dream: namely, Khrushchev's\nvirgin lands scheme, launched well after Stalin's death and after his crimes\nduring collectivization had been publicly denounced. What is remarkable is how\nlong these beliefs and structures prevailed, in spite of the evidence of their\nmanifold failings.\n\n##### Round One: The Bolshevik State and the Peasantry\n\nIt sometimes seems to me that if I could persuade everyone to say\n\"systematize\" each time he wanted to say \"liberate\" and to say \"mobilization\"\nevery time he wanted to say \"reform\" or \"progress\" I would not have to write\nlong books about government-peasant interaction in Russia.\n\n-George Yaney, The Urge to Mobilize\n\nIn the particular book quoted above, Yaney was writing about prerevolutionary\nRussia, but he could just as easily have been writing about the Bolshevik\nstate. Until 1930, the continuities between the rural policy of the Leninist\nstate and its czarist predecessor are more striking than their differences.\nThere is the same belief in reform from above and in large, modern, mechanized\nfarms as the key to productive agriculture. There is also, alas, the same high\nlevel of ignorance about a very complex rural economy coupled, disastrously,\nwith heavyhanded raids on the countryside to seize grain by force. Although\nthe continuities persisted even after the institutional revolution of 1930,\nwhat is new about the all-out drive to collectivize is the revolutionary\nstate's willingness to completely remake the institutional landscape of the\nagrarian sector, and at whatever cost.\n\nThe new Bolshevik state faced a rural society that was significantly more\nopaque, resistant, autonomous, and hostile than the one encountered by the\nczarist bureaucracy. If the czarist officials had pro yoked massive defiance\nand evasion in their \"crude Muscovite tributecollecting methods\" during World\nWar I,39 there was every reason to suspect that the Bolsheviks would have an\neven harder time squeezing grain from the countryside.\n\nIf much of the countryside was hostile to the Bolsheviks, the sentiment was\nabundantly reciprocated. For Lenin, as we have seen, the Land Decree, which\ngave to the peasants the land that they had seized, had been a strategic\nmaneuver designed to buy rural quiescence while power was consolidated; he had\nno doubt that peasant smallholdings must eventually be abolished in favor of\nlarge, socialized farms. For Trotsky, the sooner what he called \"the Russia of\nicons and cockroaches\" was transformed and \"urbanized,\" the better. And for\nmany of the newly urbanized, rank-and-file Bolsheviks, the abolition of the\n\"dark and backward peasant world\" was a \"vital part of their own emerging\npersonal and working-class identity.\"40\n\nThe peasantry was virtually terra incognita to the Bolsheviks. At the time of\nthe revolution, the party had throughout Russia a grand total of 494 \"peasant\"\nmembers (most of them probably rural intelligentsia).41 Most villagers had\nnever seen a Communist, although they may well have heard of the Bolshevik\ndecree confirming peasant ownership of the land that had been seized. The only\nrevolutionary party with any rural following was the Social Revolutionaries,\nwhose populist roots tended to make them unsympathetic to Lenin's\nauthoritarian outlook.\n\nThe effects of the revolutionary process itself had rendered rural society\nmore opaque and hence more difficult to tax. There had already been a sweeping\nseizure of land, dignified, retrospectively, by the inappropriate term \"land\nreform.\" In fact, after the collapse of the offensive into Austria during the\nwar and the subsequent mass desertions, much of the land of the gentry and\nchurch, as well as \"crown land;' had been absorbed by the peasantry. Rich\npeasants cultivating independent farmsteads (the \"separators\" of the Stolypin\nreforms) were typically forced back into the village allotments, and rural\nsociety was in effect radically compressed. The very rich had been\ndispossessed, and many of the very poor became smallholders for the first time\nin their lives. According to one set of figures, the number of landless rural\nlaborers in Russia dropped by half, and the average peasant holding increased\nby 20 percent (in the Ukraine, by 100 percent). A total of 248 million acres\nwas confiscated, almost always by local initiative, from large and small\nlandlords and added to peasant holdings, which now averaged about 70 acres per\nhousehold.41\n\nFrom the perspective of a tax official or a military procurement unit, the\nsituation was nearly unfathomable. The land-tenure status in each village had\nchanged dramatically. Prior landholding records, if they existed at all, were\nentirely unreliable as a guide to current land claims. Each village was unique\nin many respects, and, even if it could in principle have been \"mapped,\" the\npopulation's mobility and military turmoil of the period all but guaranteed\nthat the map would have been made obsolete in six months or sooner. The\ncombination, then, of smallholdings, communal tenure, and constant change,\nboth spatial and temporal, operated as an impenetrable barrier to any finely\ntuned tax system.\n\nTwo additional consequences of the revolution in the countryside compounded\nthe difficulties of state officials. Before 1917, large peasant farms and\nlandlord enterprises had produced nearly three-fourths of the grain marketed\nfor domestic use and export. It was this sector of the rural economy that had\nfed the cities. Now it was gone. The bulk of the remaining cultivators were\nconsuming a much larger share of their own yield. They would not surrender\nthis grain without a fight. The new, more egalitarian distribution of land\nmeant that extracting anything like the czarist \"take\" in grain would bring\nthe Bolsheviks in conflict with the subsistence needs of small and middle\npeasants .41\n\nThe second and perhaps decisive consequence of the revolution was that it had\ngreatly enhanced the determination and capacity of peasant communities to\nresist the state. Every revolution creates a temporary power vacuum when the\npower of the ancien regime has been destroyed but the revolutionary regime has\nnot yet asserted itself throughout the territory. Inasmuch as the Bolsheviks\nwere largely urban and found themselves fighting an extended civil war, the\npower vacuum in much of the countryside was unusually pronounced. It was the\nfirst time, as Orlando Figes reminds us, that the villages, although in\nstraitened circumstances, were free to organize their own affairs.44 As we\nhave seen, the villagers typically forced out or burned out the gentry, seized\nthe land (including rights to common land and forests), and forced the\nseparators back into the communes. The villages tended to behave as autonomous\nrepublics, well disposed to the Reds as long as they confirmed the local\n\"revolution,\" but strongly resistant to forced levies of grain, livestock, or\nmen from any quarter. In this situation, the fledgling Bolshevik state,\narriving as it often did in the form of military plunder, must have been\nexperienced by the peasantry as a reconquest of the countryside by the state\n-as a brand of colonization that threatened their newly won autonomy.\n\nGiven the political atmosphere in rural Russia, even a government having\ndetailed knowledge of the agricultural economy, a local base of support, and a\nknack for diplomatic tact would have confronted great difficulties. The\nBolsheviks lacked all three. A tax system based on income or wealth was\npossible only with a valid cadastral map and an upto-date census, neither of\nwhich existed. Farm income, moreover, varied greatly with regard to yields and\nprices from year to year, so any income tax would have had to have been\nexceptionally sensitive to these conditions in local harvests. Not only did\nthe new state lack the basic information it needed to govern efficiently, it\nhad also largely destroyed the czarist state apparatus of local officials,\ngentry, and specialists in finance and agronomy who had managed, however\ninadequately, to collect taxes and grain during the war. Above all, the\nBolsheviks generally lacked the village-level native trackers who could have\nhelped them to find their way in a hostile and confusing environment. The\nvillage soviets that were supposed to play this role were typically headed by\nvillagers loyal to local interests rather than to the center. An alternative\norgan, the Committee of the Rural Poor (kombedy), which purported to represent\nthe rural proletariat in local class struggles, was either successfully\ncoopted by the village or locked in often violent conflict with the village\nsoviet.41\n\nThe inscrutability of the mir to most Bolshevik officials was not simply a\nresult of their urban social origins and the admitted complexity of village\naffairs. It was also the product of a conscious local strategy, one that had\ndemonstrated its protective value in earlier conflicts with the gentry and the\nstate. The local commune had a long history of underreporting its arable land\nand overreporting its population in order to appear as poor and untaxable as\npossible.41' As a result of such deception in the census of 1917, the arable\nland in Russia had been underestimated by about 15 percent. Now, in addition\nto the woodland, pastures, and open land that the peasantry had earlier\nconverted into cropland without reporting it, they had an interest in hiding\nmuch of the land they had just seized from the landlords and the gentry.\nVillage committees did, of course, keep records for allocating allotment land,\norganizing communal plow teams, fixing grazing schedules, and so on, but none\nof these records was made available either to officials or to the kombedy. A\npopular saying of the period captures the situation nicely: the peasant \"owned\nby decree\" (that is, the Land Decree) but \"lived secretly.\"\n\nHow did the hard-pressed state find its way in this labyrinth? Where possible,\nthe Bolsheviks did try to establish large state farms or collective farms.\nMany of these were \"Potemkin collectives\" designed merely to give cover of\nlegitimacy to existing practices. But where they were not a sham, they\nrevealed the political and administrative attractiveness of a radical\nsimplification of the landholding and tax paying unit in the countryside.\nYaney's summary of the logic entailed is impeccable.\n\nFrom a technical point of view it was infinitely easier to plough up large\nunits of land without regard for individual claims than it was to identify\neach family allotment, measure its value in the peasants' traditional terms,\nand then painfully transpose it from scattered strips into a consolidated\nfarm. Then, too, a capital city administrator could not help but prefer to\nsupervise and tax large productive units and not have to deal with separate\nfarmers.... The collective had a dual appeal to authentic agrarian reformers.\nThey represented a social ideal for rhetorical purposes, and at the same time\nthey seemed to simplify the technical problems of land reform and state\ncontrol.47\n\nIn the turmoil of 1917-21, not many such agrarian experiments were possible,\nand those that were attempted generally failed badly. They were, however, a\nstraw in the wind for the full collectivization campaign a decade later.\n\nUnable to remake the rural landscape, the Bolsheviks turned to the same\nmethods of forced tribute under martial law that had been used by their\nczarist predecessors during the war. The term \"martial law,\" however, conveys\nan orderliness that was absent from actual practice. Armed bands\n(otriady)-some authorized and others formed spontaneously by hungry townsmen-\nplundered the countryside during the grain crisis of spring and summer 1918,\nsecuring whatever they could. Insofar as grain procurement quotas were set at\nall, they were \"purely mechanical accounting figures originating from an\nunreliable estimate of arable and assuming a good harvest.\" They were, from\nthe beginning, \"fictional and unfulfillable.\"4R The procurement of grain\nlooked more like plunder and theft than delivery and purchase. Over 150\ndistinct uprisings, by one estimate, erupted against the state's grain\nseizures. Since the Bolsheviks had, in March 1918, renamed themselves the\nCommunist Party, many of the rebels claimed to be for the Bolsheviks and the\nSoviets (whom they associated with the Land Decree) and against the\nCommunists. Lenin, referring to the peasant uprisings in Tambov, the Volga,\nand the Ukraine, declared that they posed more of a threat than all the Whites\nput together. Desperate peasant resistance had in fact all but starved the\ncities out of existence,49 and in early 192 1, the party, for the first time,\nturned its guns on its own rebellious sailors and workers in Kronstadt. At\nthis point the beleaguered party beat a tactical retreat, abandoning War\nCommunism and inaugurating the New Economic Policy (NEP), which condoned free\ntrade and small property. As Figes notes, \"Having defeated the White Army,\nbacked by eight Western powers, the Bolshevik government surrendered before\nits own peasants.\"10 It was a hollow victory. The deaths from the hunger and\nepidemics of 1921-22 nearly equaled the toll claimed by World War I and the\ncivil war combined.\n\n##### Round Two: High Modernism and Procurement\n\nThe conjunction of a high-modernist faith in what agriculture should look like\nin the future and a more immediate crisis of state appropriation helped to\nspark the all-out drive to collectivization in the winter of 1929-30. In\nfocusing on just these two issues, we must necessarily leave to others (and\nthey are a multitude) the gripping issues of the human costs of\ncollectivization, the struggle with the \"right\" opposition led by Bukharin,\nand whether Stalin intended to liquidate Ukrainian culture as well as many\nUkrainians.\n\nThere is no doubt that Stalin shared Lenin's faith in industrial agriculture.\nThe aim of collectivization, he said in May 1928, was \"to transfer from small,\nbackward, and fragmented peasant farms to consolidated, big, public farms,\nprovided with machines, equipped with the data of science, and capable of\nproducing the greatest quantity of grain for the market.\"\n\nThis dream had been deferred in 1921. There had been some hope that a\ngradually expanding collective sector in the 1920s could provide as much as\none-third of the country's grain needs. Instead, the collectivized sector\n(both the state farms and the collective farms), which absorbed 10 percent of\nthe labor force, produced a dismal 2.2 percent of gross farm production.52\nWhen Stalin decided on a crash industrialization program, it was clear that\nthe existing socialist agricultural sector could not provide either the food\nfor a rapidly growing urban workforce or the grain exports necessary to\nfinance the imported technology needed for industrial growth. The middle and\nrich peasants, many of them newly prosperous since the New Economic Policy,\nhad the grain he needed.\n\nBeginning in 1928, the official requisition policy put the state on a\ncollision course with the peasantry. The mandated delivery price of grain was\none-fifth of the market price, and the regime returned to using police methods\nas peasant resistance stiffened.53 When the procurements faltered, those who\nrefused to deliver what was required (who, along with anyone else opposing\ncollectivization, were called kulaks, regardless of their economic standing)\nwere arrested for deportation or execution, and all their grain, equipment,\nland, and livestock were seized and sold. The orders sent to those directly in\ncharge of grain procurement specified that they were to arrange meetings of\npoor peasants to make it seem as if the initiative had come from below. It was\nin the context of this war over grain, and not as a carefully planned policy\ninitiative, that the decision to force \"total\" (sploshnaia) collectivization\nwas made in late 1929. Scholars who agree on little else are in accord on this\npoint: the overriding purpose of collectivization was to ensure the seizure of\ngrain. Fitzpatrick begins her study of the collectives with this assertion:\n\"The main purpose of collectivization was to increase state grain procurements\nand reduce the peasants' ability to withhold grain from the market. This\npurpose was obvious to peasants from the start, since the collectivization\ndrive of the winter of 1929-30 was the culmination of more than two years of\nbitter struggle between the peasants and the state over grain procurements.\"54\nRobert Conquest concurs: \"The collective farms were essentially a chosen\nmechanism for extracting grain and other products.\"55\n\nIt appears that this was also how the vast majority of the peasantry saw it,\njudging from their determined resistance and what we know of their views. The\nseizure of grain threatened their survival. The peasant depicted in Andrei\nPlatonov's novel about collectivization sees how the seizure of grain negates\nthe earlier land reform: \"It's a sly business. First you hand over the land,\nand then you take away the grain, right down to the last kernel. You can choke\non land like that! The muzhik doesn't have anything left from the land except\nthe horizon. Who are you fooling? \"16 At least as threatening was the loss of\nwhat little margin of social and economic autonomy the peasantry had achieved\nsince the revolution. Even poor peasants were afraid of collectivization,\nbecause \"it would involve giving up one's land and implements and working with\nother families, under orders, not temporarily, as in the army, but forever-it\nmeans the barracks for life.\"57 Unable to rely on any significant rural\nsupport, Stalin dispatched twenty-five thousand \"plenipotentiaries\" (party\nmembers) from the towns and factories \"to destroy the peasant commune and\nreplace it by a collective economy subordinate to the state,\" whatever the\ncost.58\n\n##### Authoritarian High-Modernist Theory and the Practice of Serfdom\n\nIf the move to \"total\" collectivization was directly animated by the party's\ndetermination to seize the land and the crops sown on it once and for all, it\nwas a determination filtered through a high-modernist lens. Although the\nBolsheviks might disagree about means, they did think they knew exactly what\nmodern agriculture should look like in the end; their understanding was as\nmuch visual as scientific. Modern agriculture was to be large in scale, the\nlarger the better; it was to be highly mechanized and run hierarchically along\nscientific, Taylorist principles. Above all, the cultivators were to resemble\na highly skilled and disciplined proletariat, not a peasantry. Stalin himself,\nbefore practical failures discredited a faith in colossal projects, favored\ncollective farms (\"grain factories\") of 125,000 to 250,000 acres, as in the\nAmerican-assisted scheme described earlier.S9\n\nThe utopian abstraction of the vision was matched, on the ground, by wildly\nunrealistic planning. Given a map and a few assumptions about scale and\nmechanization, a specialist could devise a plan with little reference to local\nknowledge and conditions. A visiting agricultural official wrote back to\nMoscow from the Urals in March 1930 to complain that, \"on the instruction of\nthe Raion Executive Committee, twelve agronomists have been sitting for twenty\ndays composing an operational-production plan for the non-existent raion\ncommune without ever leaving their offices or going out into the field .\"60\nWhen another bureaucratic monstrosity in Velikie Lukie in the west proved\nunwieldy, the planners simply reduced the scale without sacrificing\nabstraction. They divided the 80,000-hectare scheme into thirty-two equal\nsquares of 2,500 hectares each, with one square constituting a kolkhoz. \"The\nsquares were drawn on a map without any reference to actual villages,\nsettlements, rivers, hills, swamps or other demographic and topological\ncharacteristics of the land.\"61\n\nSemiotically, we cannot understand this modernist vision of agriculture as an\nisolated ideological fragment. It is always seen as the negation of the\nexisting rural world. A kolkhoz is meant to replace a mir or village, machines\nto replace horse-drawn plows and hand labor, proletarian workers to replace\npeasants, scientific agriculture to replace folk tradition and superstition,\neducation to replace ignorance and malokulturnyi, and abundance to replace\nbare subsistence. Collectivization was meant to spell the end of the peasantry\nand its way of life. The introduction of a socialist economy entailed a\ncultural revolution as well; the \"dark\" narod, the peasants who were perhaps\nthe great remaining, intractable threat to the Bolshevik state, were to be\nreplaced by rational, industrious, de-Christianized, progressive-thinking\nkolkhoz workers.,' The scale of collectivization was intended to efface the\npeasantry and its institutions, thereby narrowing the gulf between the rural\nand urban worlds. Underlying the whole plan, of course, was the assumption\nthat the great collective farms would operate like factories in a centralized\neconomy, in this case fulfilling state orders for grain and other agricultural\nproducts. As if to drive the point home, the state confiscated roughly 63\npercent of the entire harvest in 1931.\n\nFrom a central planner's perspective, one great advantage of collectivization\nis that the state acquired control over how much of each crop was sown.\nStarting with the state's needs for grains, meat, dairy products, and so on,\nthe state could theoretically build those needs into its instructions to the\ncollective sector. In practice, the sowing plans imposed from above were often\nwholly unreasonable. The land departments, which prepared the plans, knew\nlittle about the crops they were mandating, the inputs needed to grow them\nlocally, or local soil conditions. Nevertheless, they had quotas to fill, and\nfill them they did. When, in 1935, A. Iakovlev, the head of the Central\nCommittee's agricultural department, called for collective farms to be managed\nby \"permanent cadres\" who \"genuinely knew their fields,\" he implied that the\npresent incumbents did not.63 We catch a glimpse of the disasters from the\nGreat Purges of 1936-37, when a certain amount of peasant criticism of kolkhoz\nofficials was briefly encouraged in order to detect \"wreckers.\" One kolkhoz\nwas instructed to plow meadows and open land, without which they could not\nhave fed their livestock. Another received sowing orders that doubled the\nprevious acreage allotted for hay fields by taking in private plots and\nquicksands.64\n\nThe planners clearly favored monoculture and a far-reaching, strict division\nof labor. Entire regions, and certainly individual kolkhozy, were increasingly\nspecialized, producing only, say, wheat, livestock, cotton, or potatoes.61 In\nthe case of livestock production, one kolkhoz would produce fodder for beef\ncattle or hogs while another would raise and breed them. The logic behind\nkolkhoz and regional specialization was roughly comparable to the logic behind\nfunctionally specific urban zones. Specialization reduced the number of\nvariables that agronomists had to consider; it also increased the\nadministrative routinization of work and hence the power and knowledge of\ncentral officials.\n\nProcurement followed a comparable centralizing logic. Starting with the needs\nof the plan and a usually unreliable estimate of the harvest, a series of\nquotas for every Oblast, raion, and kolkhoz was mechanically derived. Each\nkolkhoz then claimed that its quota was impossible to fulfill and appealed to\nhave it lowered. Actually meeting a quota, they knew from bitter experience,\nonly raised the ante for the next round of procurements. In this respect\ncollective farmers were in a more precarious situation than industrial\nworkers, who still received their wages and ration cards whether or not the\nfactory met its quota. For the kolkhozniki, however, meeting the quota might\nmean starvation. Indeed, the great famine of 1933-34 can only be called a\ncollectivization and procurement famine. Those who were tempted to make\ntrouble risked running afoul of a more grisly quota: the one for kulaks and\nenemies of the state.\n\nFor much of the peasantry, the authoritarian labor regime of the kolkhoz\nseemed not only to jeopardize their subsistence but to revoke many of the\nfreedoms they had won since their emancipation in 1861. They compared\ncollectivization to the serfdom their grandparents remembered. As one early\nsovkhoz worker put it, \"The sovkhozv are always forcing the peasant to work;\nthey make the peasants weed their fields. And they don't even give us bread or\nwater. What will come of all this? It's like barschina [feudal labor dues] all\nover again.\"b6 The peasants began to say that the acronym for the All-Union\nCommunist Party-vKP-stood for vtoroe krepostnoe pravo, or \"second serfdom. \"61\nThe parallel was not a mere figure of speech; the resemblances to serfdom were\nremarkable.61 The kolkhoz members were required to work on the state's land at\nleast half-time for wages, in cash or kind, that were derisory. They depended\nlargely on their own small private plots to grow the food they needed (other\nthan grain), although they had little free time to cultivate their gardens.69\nThe quantity to be delivered and price paid for kolkhoz produce was set by the\nstate. The kolkhozniki owed annual corvee labor dues for roadwork and cartage.\nThey were obliged to hand over quotas of milk, meat, eggs, and so on from\ntheir private plots. The collective's officials, like feudal masters, were\nwont to use kolkhoz labor for their private sidelines and had, in practice if\nnot in law, the arbitrary power to insult, beat, or deport the peasants. As\nthey were under serfdom, they were legally immobilized. An internal passport\nsystem was reintroduced to clear the cities of \"undesirable and unproductive\nresidents\" and to make sure that the peasantry did not flee. Laws were passed\nto deprive the peasantry of the firearms they used for hunting. Finally, the\nkolkhozniki living outside the village nucleus (khutor dwellers), often on\ntheir old farmsteads, were forcibly relocated, beginning in 1939. This last\nresettlement affected more than half a million peasants.\n\nThe resulting labor rules, property regime, and settlement pattern did in fact\nresemble a cross between plantation or estate agriculture on one hand and\nfeudal servitude on the other.\n\nAs a vast, state-imposed blueprint for revolutionary change, collectivization\nwas at least as notable for what it destroyed as for what it built. The\ninitial intent of collectivization was not just to crush the resistance of\nwell-to-do peasants and grab their land; it was also to dismantle the social\nunit through which that resistance was expressed: the mir. The peasant commune\nhad typically been the vehicle for organizing land seizures during the\nrevolution, for orchestrating land use and grazing, for managing local affairs\ngenerally, and for opposing procurements.70 The party had every reason to fear\nthat if the collectives were based on the traditional village, they would\nsimply reinforce the basic unit of peasant resistance. Hadn't the village\nsoviets quickly escaped the state's control? Huge collectives, then, had the\ndecided advantage of bypassing village structures altogether. They could be\nrun by a board consisting of cadres and specialists. If the giant kolkhoz was\nthen divided into sections, one specialist could be named manager of each,\n\"'like the bailiffs in the old days' [of serfdom] as [one] ... report wryly\nnoted.\"71 Eventually, except in frontier areas, practical considerations\nprevailed and a majority of the kolkhozy coincided roughly with the earlier\npeasant commune and its lands.\n\nThe kolkhoz was not, however, just window dressing hiding a traditional\ncommune. Almost everything had changed. All the focal points for an autonomous\npublic life had been eliminated. The tavern, rural fairs and markets, the\nchurch, and the local mill disappeared; in their places stood the kolkhoz\noffice, the public meeting room, and the school. Nonstate public spaces gave\nway to the state spaces of government agencies, albeit local ones.\n\nThe concentration, legibility, and centralization of social organization and\nproduction can be seen in the map of the state farm at Verchnyua Troitsa\n(Upper Trinity) in Tver Oblast (figure 28).72 Much of the old village has been\nremoved from the center and relocated on the outskirts (legend reference\n11).73 Two-story apartment houses containing sixteen flats each have been\nclustered near the center (legend references 13, 14, 15; see also figure 29),\nwhile the local administration and trade center, school, and community\nbuilding, all public institutions run by the state, lie close to the center of\nthe new grid. Even allowing for the exaggerated formalism of the map, the\nstate farm is a far cry from the sprawl and autonomous institutional order of\nthe precollec- tivized village; a photograph showing the old-style housing and\na lane illustrates the stark visual contrast (see figure 30).\n\nCompared to Haussmann's retrofitting of the physical geography of Paris to\nmake it legible and to facilitate state domination, the Bolsheviks'\nretrofitting of rural Russia was far more thoroughgoing. In place of an opaque\nand often obstinate mir, it had fashioned a legible kolkhoz. In place of\nmyriad small farms, it had created a single, local economic unit.14 With the\nestablishment of hierarchical state farms, a quasi-autonomous petite\nbourgeoisie was replaced with dependent employees. In place, therefore, of an\nagriculture in which planting, harvesting, and marketing decisions were in the\nhands of individual households, the party-state had built a rural economy\nwhere all these decisions would be made centrally. In place of a peasantry\nthat was technically independent, it had created a peasantry that was directly\ndependent on the state for combines and tractors, fertilizer, and seeds. In\nplace of a peasant economy whose harvests, income, and profits were well-nigh\nindecipherable, it had created units that were ideal for simple and direct\nappropriation. In place of a variety of social units with their own unique\nhistories and practices, it had created homologous units of accounting that\ncould all be fitted into a national administrative grid. The logic was not\nunlike the management scheme at McDonald's: modular, similarly designed units\nproducing similar products, according to a common formula and work routine.\nUnits can easily be duplicated across the landscape, and the inspectors coming\nto assess their operations enter legible domains which they can evaluate with\na single checklist.\n\n![](img0038.jpg)\n\n28\\.

Houses along a lane in the old village at Verchnyua Troitsa\n\nAny comprehensive assessment of sixty years of collectivization would require\nboth archival material only now becoming available and abler hands than my\nown. What must strike even a casual student of collectivization, however, is\nhow it largely failed in each of its highmodernist aims, despite huge\ninvestments in machinery, infrastructure, and agronomic research. Its\nsuccesses, paradoxically, were in the domain of traditional statecraft. The\nstate managed to get its hands on enough grain to push rapid\nindustrialization, even while contending with staggering inefficiencies,\nstagnant yields, and ecological devasta- tion.75 The state also managed, at\ngreat human cost, to eliminate the social basis of organized, public\nopposition from the rural population. On the other hand, the state's capacity\nfor realizing its vision of large, productive, efficient, scientifically\nadvanced farms growing high-quality products for market was virtually nil.\n\nThe collectives that the state had created manifested in some ways the facade\nof modern agriculture without its substance. The farms were highly mechanized\n(by world standards), and they were managed by officials with degrees in\nagronomy and engineering. Demonstration farms really did achieve large yields,\nalthough often at prohibitive costs.76 But in the end none of this could\ndisguise the many failures of Soviet agriculture. Only three sources of these\nfailures are noted here, because they will concern us later.77 First, having\ntaken from the peasants both their (relative) independence and autonomy as\nwell as their land and grain, the state created a class of essentially unfree\nlaborers who responded with all the forms of foot-dragging and resistance\npracticed by unfree laborers everywhere. Second, the unitary administrative\nstructure and imperatives of central planning created a clumsy machine that\nwas utterly unresponsive to local knowledge or to local conditions. Finally,\nthe Leninist political structure of the Soviet Union gave agriculture\nofficials little or no incentive to adapt to, or negotiate with, its rural\nsubjects. The very capacity of the state to essentially reenserf rural\nproducers, dismantle their institutions, and impose its will, in the crude\nsense of appropriation, goes a long way toward explaining the state's failure\nto realize anything but a simulacrum of the highmodernist agriculture that\nLenin so prized.\n\n#### State Landscapes of Control and Appropriation\n\nDrawing on the history of Soviet collectivization, I shall now venture a few\nmore frankly speculative ideas about the institutional logic of authoritarian\nhigh modernism. Then I shall suggest a way of grasping why such massive social\nbulldozing may have worked tolerably well for some purposes but failed\ndismally for others-an issue to which we shall return in later chapters.\n\nThe headlong drive to collectivization was animated by the shortterm goal of\nseizing enough grain to push rapid industrialization.78 Threats and violence\nhad worked, up to a point, for the harvests of 1928 and 1929, but each annual\nturn of the screw elicited more evasion and resistance from the peasantry. The\nbitter fact was that the Soviet state faced an exceptionally diverse\npopulation of commune-based smallholders whose economic and social affairs\nwere nearly unintelligible to the center. These circumstances offered some\nstrategic advantages to a peasantry waging a quiet guerrilla war (punctuated\nby open revolt) against state claims. The state, under the existing property\nregime, could only look forward to a bruising struggle for grain each year,\nwith no assurance of success.\n\nStalin chose this moment to strike a decisive blow. He imposed a designed and\nlegible rural landscape that would be far more amenable to appropriation,\ncontrol, and central transformation. The social and economic landscape he had\nin mind was of course the industrial model of advanced agriculture-large,\nmechanized farms run along factory lines and coordinated by state planning.\n\nIt was a case of the \"newest state\" meeting the \"oldest class\" and attempting\nto remake it into some reasonable facsimile of a proletariat. Compared to the\npeasantry, the proletariat was already relatively more legible as a class, and\nnot just because of its central place in Marxist theory. The proletariat's\nwork regimen was regulated by factory hours and by man-made techniques of\nproduction. In the case of new industrial projects like the great steel\ncomplex at Magnitogorsk, the planners could start virtually from zero, as with\nBrasilia. The peasants, on the other hand, represented a welter of small,\nindividual household en terprises. Their settlement pattern and social\norganization had a historical logic far deeper than that of the factory floor.\n\nOne purpose of collectivization was to destroy these economic and social\nunits, which were hostile to state control, and to force the peasantry into an\ninstitutional straitjacket of the state's devising. The new institutional\norder of collective farms would now be compatible with the state's purposes of\nappropriation and directed development. Given the quasi-civil war conditions\nof the countryside, the solution was as much a product of military occupation\nand \"pacification\" as of \"socialist transformation .\n\nIt is possible, I believe, to say something more generally about the \"elective\naffinity\" between authoritarian high modernism and certain institutional\narrangements.10 What follows is rather crude and provisional, but it will\nserve as a point of departure. High-modernist ideologies embody a doctrinal\npreference for certain social arrangements. Authoritarian high-modernist\nstates, on the other hand, take the next step. They attempt, and often\nsucceed, in imposing those preferences on their population. Most of the\npreferences can be deduced from the criteria of legibility, appropriation, and\ncentralization of control. To the degree that the institutional arrangements\ncan be readily monitored and directed from the center and can be easily taxed\n(in the broadest sense of taxation), then they are likely to be promoted. The\nimplicit goals behind these comparisons are not unlike the goals of premodern\nstatecraft.\"' Legibility, after all, is a prerequisite of appropriation as\nwell as of authoritarian transformation. The difference, and it is a crucial\none, lies in the wholly new scale of ambition and intervention entertained by\nhigh modernism.\n\nThe principles of standardization, central control, and synoptic legibility to\nthe center could be applied to many other fields; those noted in the\naccompanying table are only suggestive. If we were to apply them to education,\nfor example, the most illegible educational system would be completely\ninformal, nonstandardized instruction determined entirely by local mutuality.\nThe most legible educational system would resemble Hippolyte Taine's\ndescription of French education in the nineteenth century, when \"the Minister\nof Education could pride himself, just by looking at his watch, which page of\nVirgil all schoolboys of the Empire were annotating at that exact moment.\"\" A\nmore exhaustive table would replace the dichotomies with more elaborate\ncontinua (open commons landholding, for example, is less legible and taxable\nthan closed commons landholding, which in turn is less legible than private\nfreeholding, which is less legible than state ownership). It is no coincidence\nthat the more legible or appropriable form can more read ily be converted into\na source of rent-either as private property or as the monopoly rent of the\nstate.\n\n#### The Limits of Authoritarian High Modernism\n\nWhen are high-modernist arrangements likely to work and when are they likely\nto fail? The abject performance of Soviet agriculture as an efficient producer\nof foodstuffs was, in retrospect, \"overdetermined\" by many causes having\nlittle to do with high modernism per se: the radically mistaken biological\ntheories of Trofim Lysenko, Stalin's obsessions, conscription during World War\nII, and the weather. And it is apparent that centralized high-modernist\nsolutions can be the most efficient, equitable, and satisfactory for many\ntasks. Space exploration, the planning of transportation networks, flood\ncontrol, airplane manufacturing, and other endeavors may require huge\norganizations minutely coordinated by a few experts. The control of epidemics\nor of pollution requires a center staffed by experts receiving and digesting\nstandard information from hundreds of reporting units.\n\n![](page0268_0000.svg)\n\nOn the other hand, these methods seem singularly maladroit at such tasks as\nputting a really good meal on the table or performing surgery. This issue will\nbe addressed at length in chapter 8, but some valuably suggestive evidence can\nbe gleaned from Soviet agriculture. If we think of particular crops, it is\napparent that collective farms were successful at growing some crops,\nespecially the major grains: wheat, rye, oats, barley, and maize. They were\nnotably inefficient at turning out other products, especially fruits,\nvegetables, small livestock, eggs, dairy products, and flowers. Most of these\ncrops were supplied from the minuscule private plots of the kolkhoz members,\neven at the height of col- lectivization.8\" The systematic differences between\nthese two categories of crops helps to explain why their institutional setting\nmight vary.\n\nLet us take wheat as an example of what I will call a \"proletarian crop\" and\ncompare it with red raspberries, which I think of as the ultimate \"petit-\nbourgeois crop.\" Wheat lends itself to extensive largescale farming and\nmechanization. One might say that wheat is to collectivized agriculture what\nthe Norway spruce is to centrally managed, scientific forestry. Once planted,\nit needs little care until harvest, when a combine can cut and thresh the\ngrain in one operation and then blow it into trucks bound for granaries or\ninto railroad cars. Relatively sturdy in the ground, wheat remains sturdy once\nharvested. It is relatively easy to store for extended periods with only small\nlosses to spoilage. The red raspberry bush, on the other hand, requires a\nparticular soil to be fruitful; it must be pruned annually; it requires more\nthan one picking, and it is virtually impossible to pick by machine. Once\npacked, raspberries last only a few days under the best conditions. They will\nspoil within hours if packed too tightly or if stored at too high a\ntemperature. At virtually every stage the raspberry crop needs delicate\nhandling and speed, or all is lost.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that fruits and vegetables-petit-bourgeois crops-were\ntypically not grown as kolkhoz crops but rather as sidelines produced by\nindividual households. The collective sector in effect ceded such crops to\nthose who had the personal interest, incentive, and horticultural skills to\ngrow them successfully. Such crops can, in principle, be grown by huge\ncentralized enterprises as well, but they must be enterprises that are\nelaborately attentive to the care of the crops and to the care of the labor\nthat tends them. Even where such crops are grown on large farms, the farms\ntend to be family enterprises of smaller size than wheat farms and are\ninsistent on a stable, knowledgeable workforce. In these situations, the small\nfamily enterprise has, in the terms of neoclassical economics, a comparative\nadvantage.\n\nAnother way in which wheat production is different from raspberry production\nis that the growing of wheat involves a modest number of routines that,\nbecause the grain is robust, allow some slack or play. The crop will take some\nabuse. Raspberry growers, because successful cultivation of their crop is\ncomplex and the fruit is delicate, must be adaptive, nimble, and exceptionally\nattentive. Successful raspberry growing requires, in other words, a\nsubstantial stock of local knowledge and experience. These distinctions will\nprove germane to the Tanzanian example, to which we now turn, and later to our\nunderstanding of local knowledge.\n\n\n# 7 Compulsory Villagization in  \nTanzania:  \nAesthetics and Miniaturization\n\n![](img0041.jpg)\n\nThe ujamaa village campaign in Tanzania from 1973 to 1976 was a massive\nattempt to permanently settle most of the country's population in villages, of\nwhich the layouts, housing designs, and local economies were planned, partly\nor wholly, by officials of the central government. We shall examine the\nTanzanian experience for three reasons. First, the campaign was by most\naccounts the largest forced resettlement scheme undertaken in independent\nAfrica up to that time; at least 5 million Tanzanians were relocated.' Second,\ndocumentation of the villagization process is abundant, thanks to the\ninternational interest in the experiment and the relatively open character of\nTanzanian political life. Finally, the campaign was undertaken largely as a\ndevelopment and welfare project and not, as has often been the case, as part\nof a plan of punitive appropriation, ethnic cleansing, or military security\n(as in South Africa's forced removals and homeland schemes under apartheid).\nCompared with Soviet collectivization, the ujamaa village campaign was a case\nof large-scale social engineering by a relatively benign and weak state.\n\nMany other large-scale resettlement schemes can be subjected to much the same\nanalysis. If, in the Tanzanian case, Chinese and Russian models as well as\nMarxist-Leninist rhetoric play an important ideological role, we should not\nimagine that these were the only sources of inspiration for such schemes.' We\ncould as easily have examined the huge forced removals under apartheid\npolicies in South Africa, which were far more brutal and economically\ndestructive. We could also have analyzed any number of the many large-scale\ncapitalist schemes for production, often requiring substantial population\nmovements, that have been undertaken with international assistance in poor\ncountries.' Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's head of state, viewed the permanent\nresettlement in ways that were strikingly continuous with colonial policy, as\nwe shall see, and his ideas about both mechanization and economies of scale in\nagriculture were part and parcel of international development discourse at the\ntime. That discourse of modernization was, in turn, heavily influenced by the\nmodel of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the development of capital-intensive\nagriculture in the United States, and the lessons of economic mobilization\nfrom World War 11.4\n\nIn contrast to Soviet collectivization, Tanzanian villagization was not\nconceived as an all-out war of appropriation. Nyerere made a point of warning\nagainst the use of administrative or military coercion, insisting that no one\nshould be forced, against his or her will, into the new villages. And in fact\nthe disruptions and inhumanities of Nyerere's program, however serious for its\nvictims, were not in the same league as those inflicted by Stalin. Even so,\nthe ujamaa campaign was coercive and occasionally violent. It proved,\nmoreover, a failure, ecologically as well as economically.\n\nEven in this \"softer\" version of authoritarian high modernism, certain family\nresemblances stand out. The first is the logic of \"improvement.\" As in the\n\"unimproved\" forest, the existing patterns of settlement and social life in\nTanzania were illegible and resistant to the narrow purposes of the state.\nOnly by radically simplifying the settlement pattern was it possible for the\nstate to efficiently deliver such development services as schools, clinics,\nand clean water. Mere administrative convenience was hardly the only objective\nof state officials, and that is our second point. The thinly veiled subtext of\nvillagization was also to reorganize human communities in order to make them\nbetter objects of political control and to facilitate the new forms of\ncommunal farming favored by state policy. In this context, there are striking\nparallels between what Nyerere and Tanzanian African National Union (TANU)\nenvisioned and the program of agriculture and settlement initiated by the\ncolonial regimes in East Africa. The parallels suggest that we have stumbled\nacross something generic about the projects of the modern developmentalist\nstate.\n\nBeyond this second criterion of bureaucratic management, however, lay a third\nresemblance that had nothing directly to do with efficiency. As in the Soviet\ncase, there was also, I believe, a powerful aesthetic dimension. Certain\nvisual representations of order and efficiency, although they may have made\neminent sense in some original context, are detached from their initial\nmoorings. High-modernist plans tend to \"travel\" as an abbreviated visual image\nof efficiency that is less a scientific proposition to be tested than a quasi-\nreligious faith in a visual sign or representation of order. As Jacobs\nsuggested, they may substitute an apparent visual order for the real thing.\nThe fact that they look right becomes more important than whether they work;\nor, better put, the assumption is that if the arrangement looks right, it will\nalso, ipso facto, function well. The importance of such representations is\nmanifested in a tendency to miniaturize, to create such microenvironments of\napparent order as model villages, demonstration projects, new capitals, and so\non.\n\nFinally, like Soviet collectives, ujamaa villages were economic and ecological\nfailures. For ideological reasons, the designe:s of the new society had paid\nvirtually no attention to the local knowledge and practices of cultivators and\npastoralists. They had also forgotten the most important fact about social\nengineering: its efficiency depends on the response and cooperation of real\nhuman subjects. If people find the new arrangement, however efficient in\nprinciple, to be hostile to their dignity, their plans, and their tastes, they\ncan make it an inefficient arrangement.\n\n#### Colonial High-Modernist Agriculture in East Africa\n\nFor the colonial state did not merely aspire to create, under its control, a\nhuman landscape of perfect visibility; the condition of this visibility was\nthat everyone, everything, had (as it were) a serial number.\n\n-Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities\n\nColonial rule has always been meant to be profitable for the colonizer. This\nimplied, in a rural society, stimulating cultivation for the market. A variety\nof such means as head taxes payable in cash or in valuable crops, private-\nsector plantations, and the encouragement of white settlers were deployed to\nthis end. Beginning during World War II and especially after it, the British\nin East Africa turned to planning largescale development projects and\nmobilizing the required labor. A straw in the wind was the conscription of\nnearly thirty thousand laborers for work on plantations (particularly sisal\nplantations) during the war. Postwar schemes, although they often had prewar\nprecedents, were far more ambitious: a gigantic groundnut (peanut) scheme;\nvarious rice, tobacco, cotton, and cattle schemes; and, above all, elaborate\nsoilconservation plans mandating a strict regimen of practices. Resettlement\nand mechanization were integral parts of many schemes.' The vast majority of\nthese projects were neither popular nor successful. In fact, one of the\nstandard explanations for the successes of TANU in the countryside was\nprecisely the widespread popular resentment against colonial agricultural\npolicy-particularly forced conservation measures and such livestock\nregulations as destocking and cattle dipping.,,\n\nThe most searching account of the logic underlying these schemes of \"welfare\ncolonialism\" is William Beinert's study of neighboring Malawi (then\nNyasaland).' Although the ecology is different in Malawi, the broad lines of\nits agricultural policy varied little from that attempted elsewhere in British\nEast Africa. For our purposes, what is most striking is the degree to which\nthe assumptions of the colonial regime matched those of the independent, and\nfar more legitimate, socialist state of Tanzania.\n\nThe point of departure for colonial policy was a complete faith in what\nofficials took for \"scientific agriculture\" on one hand and a nearly total\nskepticism about the actual agricultural practices of Africans on the other.\nAs a provincial agricultural officer in the Shire (Tchiri) Valley put it, \"The\nAfrican has neither the training, skill, nor equipment to diagnose his soil\nerosion troubles nor can he plan the remedial measures, which are based on\nscientific knowledge, and this is where I think we rightly come in.\"' Although\nthe officer's sentiment was no doubt perfectly sincere, one cannot fail to\nnote how it justified, at the same time, the importance and authority of\nagricultural experts over mere practitioners.\n\nIn keeping with the planning ideology of the time, the experts were inclined\nto propose elaborate projects-a \"total development scheme,\" a \"comprehensive\nland usage scheme.\" But there were enormous obstacles to imposing a\ncomplicated and draconian set of regulations on a population of cultivators\nwell aware of environmental constraints and convinced of the logic of their\nown farming practices. Pushing ahead autocratically only courted protest and\nevasion. It was in just such contexts that the strategy of resettlement was so\nappealing. Opening new land or repurchasing the estates of white settlers\nallowed officials to start from scratch with compact village sites and\nconsolidated individual plots. The newly recruited settlers could then be\nrelocated to a prepared, legible site replacing the scattered residences and\ncomplex tenure patterns found elsewhere. The more the planners filled in the\ndetails-that is, the more that huts were built or specified, sites demarcated,\nfields cleared and plowed, and plants selected (and sometimes sown)-the\ngreater the chance of controlling the scheme and keeping it to its designed\nform.\n\nThe planning of the lower Shire Valley along these lines, Beinert makes clear,\nwas not an entirely scientific exercise. The scheme's designers were deploying\na set of technical beliefs associated with mod ern agriculture, very few of\nwhich had been verified in the context of local conditions. They were also\ndeploying a set of aesthetic and visual standards, some of them obviously\noriginating in the temperate West, which had come to symbolize an ordered and\nproductive agriculture. 10 They were driven by what Beinert called the\n\"technical imagination of what might be possible.\"\n\nIn the case of ridging and bunding in the lower river, the imagination had an\nalmost pictorial quality: they looked forward to a valley of regular fields,\nneatly ridged, between long straight contour bunds, below a line of storm\ndrains topped by forests. It was a rectangular contoured order which would\nrender the environment susceptible to control, facilitate technical\ntransformation of, and controls over, peasant agriculture and, perhaps, accord\nwith their sense of planned beauty. It was this solution which would make\nadequate production possible. But driven by their technical conviction and\nimagination, they were unresponsive to the effects of their interventions on\npeasant society and peasant culture.\"\n\nAesthetic order in the agricultural and forest landscape was replicated in the\nhuman geography as well. 12 A series of model villages, spread evenly across\nthe rectangular grid of fields and linked by roads, would become the center of\ntechnical and social services. The fields themselves were so arrayed as to\nfacilitate the dryland rotational farming built into the scheme. In fact, the\nShire Valley project was to be a miniature version of the Tennessee Valley\nAuthority, complete with dams along the river and sites indicated for capital-\nintensive processing plants. A three-dimensional model, along the lines of an\narchitect's model of a new town, was constructed to show, in miniature, what\nthe whole project would look like when completed.13\n\nThe plans for human settlement and land use in the lower Shire Valley \"failed\nalmost completely.\" The reasons for their failure presage the fiasco of the\nujamaa villages. Local cultivators, for example, resisted the generic colonial\nsolution to soil erosion: ridging. As later research showed, in this context\ntheir resistance was both economically and ecologically sound. Ridging on\nsandy soil was unstable, tending to create larger erosion gullies in the rainy\nseason, and ridging caused the soil to dry out quickly during the dry season,\nencouraging white ants to attack the roots of crops. Would-be settlers hated\nthe regimentation of the government schemes; a \"model settlement with communal\nfarming\" drew no voluntary migrants and had to be converted into a government\nmaize farm using wage labor. The prohibitions on farming the settlement's rich\nmarshland (dimba) deterred volunteers. Later, officials conceded that they,\nand not the peasants, had been mistaken in this respect.\n\nThe lower Shire Valley project miscarried for two larger reasons that are\ncrucial to our understanding of the limits of high-modernist planning. The\nfirst is that the planners operated with a model of the agricultural\nenvironment that was standardized for the entire valley. It was precisely this\nassumption that made it possible to specify the generic, and apparently\npermanent, solution of a particular dryland rotation for all cultivators. The\nsolution was a static, freeze-frame answer to a dynamic and variegated valley\nenvironment. In contrast, the peasants possessed a flexible repertoire of\nstrategies depending on the timing and extent of the floods, the microlocal\nsoil compositions, and so on-strategies that were to some degree unique to\neach farmer, each plot of land, and to each growing season. The second reason\nbehind the failure was that the planners also operated with a standardized\nmodel of the cultivators themselves, assuming that all peasants would desire\nroughly the same crop mix, techniques, and yields. Such an assumption\ncompletely ignored key variables, such as family size and composition,\nsideline occupations, gender divisions of labor, and culturally conditioned\nneeds and tastes. The fact was that each family had its own particular mix of\nresources and goals that would affect its agricultural strategy year by year\nin ways that the overall plan did not provide for. As a plan, it was both\naesthetically pleasing to its inventors and also precise and consistent within\nits own strict parameters. As a scheme for development, however, it was the\nkind of environmental and social taxidermy that doomed it almost from the\nstart. Ironically, successful, voluntary pioneer settlement outside the\ngovernment's purview and without any financial assistance continued apace.\nThis disorderly, illegible, but more productive settlement was castigated as\nsquatting and severely reproved, although without much practical effect.\n\nThe abject failure of the ambitious groundnuts scheme in Tanganyika just after\nWorld War II is also instructive as a dress rehearsal for massive\nvillagization.14 The joint venture between the United African Company (a\nsubsidiary of Unilever) and the colonial state proposed the clearing of no\nfewer than 3 million acres of bush that would, when cultivated, yield more\nthan half a million tons of peanuts to be converted to cooking oil for export.\nThe scheme was conceived during the postwar high tide of faith in the economic\nprowess of a command economy joined to large capitalist firms. By 1950, when\nless than 10 percent of the acreage had been cleared and not as many nuts had\nbeen grown as seeds had been sown, the project was abandoned.\n\nThe reasons for the failure were legion. In development circles, in fact, the\ngroundnuts scheme is one of a handful of legendary failures cited as examples\nof what not to do. At least two of the ingredients of this disaster relate to\nthe failure of the lower Shire Valley project and to the later disaster of\nlarge-scale villagization. First, the design for the scheme was narrowly\nagronomic and abstract. Very general figures for the tractor hours needed to\nclear land, the amounts of fertilizer and pesticide needed to attain a given\nyield per acre, and so forth were applied to the new terrain. No detailed\nmapping of soils, rainfall patterns, or topography and certainly no\nexperimental trials had been undertaken. Field reconnaissance was allotted a\nmere nine weeks, much of it conducted from the air! The general figures proved\nwildly erroneous precisely because they were heedless of the particularities\nof the locality: clayey soil that compacted in the dry season, irregular\nrainfall, crop diseases for which there were no resistant plant varieties,\ninappropriate machinery for the soil and terrain.\n\nThe second fatal premise in the design of the scheme was its \"blind faith in\nmachinery and large-scale operation.\"\" The project's founder, Frank Samuel,\nhad a motto: \"No operation will be performed by hand for which mechanical\nequipment is available.\"\"' The scheme was essentially a quasi-military\noperation perhaps derived from wartime experience and designed to be\ntechnically self-contained. The plan's level of abstraction resembles that of\nthe Soviet collective wheat farm laid out by Wilson, Ware, and Riggin in their\nChicago hotel room in 1928 (see chapter 6). The groundnuts scheme\nintentionally bypassed African smallholders in order to create a colossal\nindustrial farm under European management. As such, the project might have\nreflected relative factor prices on, say, the plains of Kansas, but surely not\nin Tanganyika. Had it succeeded in growing peanuts in any quantities, it would\nhave grown them on grossly uneconomic terms. Capitalist high modernism of the\nutopian kind that inspired the groundnuts scheme was no more appropriate to\nTanzania than would be the template of villagization and collectivist,\nsocialist production that inspired Nyerere.\n\n#### Villages and \"Improved\" Farming in Tanzania Before 1973\n\nThe vast majority of the Tanzanian rural population was, in terms of\nlegibility and appropriation, outside the reach of the state. At independence,\nan estimated 11 out of 12 million rural dwellers lived \"scattered\" across the\nlandscape. With the exception of densely settled areas in the cool, wet\nhighlands where substantial amounts of coffee and tea were grown and marketed,\nmuch of the population practiced subsistence farming or pastoralism. Much of\nwhat they did sell was offered at local markets largely outside the ambit of\nstate supervision and taxation. The objective of colonial agricultural policy\nand also of the inde pendent state of Tanzania (and seconded, early on, by the\nWorld Bank) was to assemble more of the population into fixed, permanent\nsettlements and to promote forms of agriculture that would yield a greater\nmarketable surplus, especially for export.\" Whether these policies took the\nform of private ventures or socialized agriculture, they were strategies\ndesigned, as Goran Hyden has said, \"to capture the peasantry.\"\" The\nnationalist regime of TANU was, of course, much more legitimate than its\ncolonial predecessor. But we should not forget that much of the popularity of\nTANU in rural areas rested on its endorsement of resistance to the onerous and\nmandatory agricultural regulations of the colonial state.'`' As in Russia, the\npeasantry had taken advantage of the interregnum at independence to ignore or\ndefy policies declared in the capital.\n\nAt the outset, villagization was a central goal of Nyerere and of TANU. The\npurpose of village formation was at this stage threefold: the delivery of\nservices; the creation of a more productive, modern agriculture; and the\nencouragement of communal, socialist forms of cooperation. Nyerere outlined\nthe importance of village living as early as 1962, in his inaugural address to\nTanzania's parliament.\n\nAnd if you ask me why the government wants us to live in villages, the answer\nis just as simple: unless we do we shall not be able to provide ourselves with\nthe things we need to develop our land and to raise our standard of living. We\nshall not be able to use tractors; we shall not be able to provide schools for\nour children; we shall not be able to build hospitals, or have clean drinking\nwater; it will be quite impossible to start small village industries, and\ninstead we shall have to go on depending on the towns for all our\nrequirements; and if we had a plentiful supply of electric power we should\nnever be able to connect it up to each isolated homestead.20\n\nBy 1967, in a major policy statement called \"Socialism and Rural Development,\"\nNyerere elaborated on the specifically socialist aspect of the campaign for\nvillage living. It was clear to him that if the present pattern of capitalist\ndevelopment continued, Tanzania would eventually develop a class of wealthy\n\"kulak\" (the Russian term then in vogue in TANU circles) farmers who would\nreduce their neighbors to the status of wage laborers. Ujamaa villages (that\nis, socialist cooperatives) would set the rural economy on a different path.\n\"What is here being proposed,\" Nyerere explained, \"is that we in Tanzania\nshould move from being a nation of individual peasant producers who are\ngradually adopting the incentives and ethics of the capitalist system. Instead\nwe should gradually become a nation of ujamaa villages where the people co-\noperate directly in small groups and where these small groups cooperate\ntogether for joint enterprises.\"21\n\nFor Nyerere, village living, development services, communal agriculture, and\nmechanization were a single indissoluble package. Farmers who were scattered\nhither and yon could not easily be educated or treated for common illnesses,\ncould not learn the techniques of modern agriculture, could not even\ncooperate, unless they first moved to villages. He declared: \"The first and\nabsolutely essential thing to do, therefore, if we want to be able to start\nusing tractors for cultivation, is to begin living in proper villages.... We\nshall not be able to use tractors [if we have no villages].\"22 Modernization\nrequired, above all, physical concentration into standardized units that the\nstate might service and administer. Little wonder that electrification and\ntractors, those emblems of development, were on the tip of Nyerere's tongue as\nwell as Lenin's.23 There is, I believe, a powerful aesthetic of modernization\nat play here. A modern population must live in communities with a certain\nphysical layout- not just villages, but proper villages.\n\nNyerere, unlike Stalin, at first insisted that the creation of ujamaa villages\nbe gradual and completely voluntary. He imagined that a few families would\nmove their houses to be closer together and would plant their crops nearby,\nafter which they might open a communal plot. Success would attract others.\n\"Socialist communities cannot be established by compulsion,\" he declared. They\n\"can only be established with willing members; the task of leadership and of\nGovernment is not to try and force this kind of development, but to explain,\nencourage, and participate.\"24 Later on, in 1973, having gauged the general\nresistance to villagization on government terms, Nyerere would change his\nmind. By then the seeds of coercion had been sown, by a politicized,\nauthoritarian bureaucracy and also by Nyerere's underlying conviction that the\npeasants did not know what was good for them. Thus, immediately after\ndisavowing \"compulsion\" in the sentence just quoted, Nyerere concedes, \"It may\nbe possible-and sometimes necessary-to insist on all farmers in a given area\ngrowing a certain acreage of a particular crop until they realize that this\nbrings them a more secure living, and then do not have to be forced to grow\nit.\"25 If the peasants could not be persuaded to act in their own interest,\nthey might have to be coerced. This logic was a replication of that in the\n1961 World Bank report associated with Tanganyika's first five-year plan. That\nreport was laced with the era's standard discourse about having to overcome\nthe habits and superstitions of a backward and obstinate peasantry. The report\nalso doubted whether persuasion alone would get the job done. While its\nauthors hoped that \"social emulation, cooperation, and the expansion of\ncommunity development services\" would transform attitudes, they warned darkly\nthat \"where incentives, emulation and propaganda are ineffective, enforcement\nor coercive measures of an appropriate sort will be considered.\"26\n\nScores of village settlements and cultivation schemes were initiated in the\n1960s. Despite their great variety-some were joint ventures between the state\nand foreign firms, some were government or parastatal schemes, and others were\nspontaneous popular initiatives-most were judged to be failures and closed\ndown, either by decree or by attrition. Three aspects of these schemes seem\nespecially relevant to understanding the all-out villagization campaign that\nbegan in 1973.\n\nThe first was a penchant for creating pilot schemes. In itself this approach\nmade sense, since policy makers could learn what would work and what would not\nbefore embarking on more ambitious plans. Many such schemes, however, became\nshowpiece demonstration farms absorbing huge amounts of scarce equipment,\nfunds, and personnel. For a time, a few of these precious miniatures of\nprogress and modernization were maintained. One influential scheme involving a\nmere three hundred settlers managed to acquire four bulldozers, nine tractors,\na field car, seven lorries, a maize mill, an electric generator, and a cadre\nof about fifteen administrators and specialists, 150 laborers, and twelve\nartisans.27 It was, after a fashion, a successful example of a modern farm,\nproviding that one overlooked its truly legendary inefficiency and the fact\nthat it was irrelevant to the Tanzanian situation.\n\nThe second aspect prefiguring the Tanzanian experience was that, given single-\nparty rule, an authoritarian administrative tradition, and a dictator (albeit\na rather benevolent one)28 who wanted results, the normal bureaucratic\npathologies were exaggerated. Sites for new settlements were often chosen, not\nby economic logic, but by finding \"blank spots\" on the map (preferably near\nroads) where the settlers might be dumped.29 In the West Lake (west of Lake\nVictoria) region (1970), a member of Parliament and five technical specialists\ndescended briefly to design a four-year plan (1970-1974) for all ujamaa\nvillages in the region. They were obviously under great pressure to please\ntheir superiors by promising huge increases in cultivation and production\nwhich were \"utterly unrealistic and completely out of touch with any possible\ndevelopment in the village.\"30 The plans were promulgated without any real\nconsultation and were based on abstract assumptions about machine use, days of\nlabor, rates of land clearance, and a new crop regimen, not unlike the\ngroundnut scheme or the Soviet collective hatched in a Chicago hotel room.\n\nFinally, where the pressure was greatest to create new villages, TANu\nactivists and officials ignored Nyerere's advice against compulsion. Thus,\nwhen he decided in 1970 that the entire population of Dodoma (a drought-prone\nregion in central Tanzania) should be relocated to ujamaa villages within\nfourteen months, officials sprang into action. Relying on everyone's sharp\nmemories of a regional famine in 1969, the officials let it be understood that\nonly those dwelling in ujamaa villages would ever receive famine relief. Those\nwho already lived in ujamaa villages with fewer than the stipulated minimum of\n250 families were often forced to amalgamate with another settlement to reach\nthe required size. Communal plots were built into the new settlements, as\nwere, in theory, labor regulations and cropping schedules. When an\nagricultural officer insisted that there be no discussion of the official\ndecision to enlarge one village's communal field to 170 acres, absorbing the\nadjacent private plots, he was thrown out of the village meeting in a rare\nopen revolt. An M.P. who sided with the village was barred from running again\nand placed under surveillance, while the district's TANU chairman, who did\nlikewise, was removed and placed under house arrest. Dodoma was a preview of\nwhat was to come.\n\nLest there be any doubt that villagization meant central control and not\nsimply village formation and communal farming, the sorry fate of the Ruvuma\nDevelopment Association (RDA) settled the matter.31 The RDA was an umbrella\norganization representing fifteen communal villages scattered over one hundred\nmiles in the Songea, a remote and poor district in the southwestern part of\nthe country. Unlike most ujamaa villages, these were the spontaneous creation\nof young local militants in TANU. They began in 1960, long before Nyerere's\npolicy declaration of 1967, with each village inventing its own forms of\ncommunal enterprise. Early on, Nyerere singled out one of the villages,\nLitowa, heralding it as a place where he could send people to see rural\nsocialism in action.32 Its school, milling cooperative, and marketing\nassociation were the envy of neighboring villages. Given the high level of\npatronage and financial backing the villagers attracted, it is hard to tell\nhow economically sound their enterprises were. They did, however, anticipate\nNyerere's declared policy of local control and nonauthoritarian cooperation.\nThe villagers were, on the other hand, independent and assertive vis-a-vis the\nstate. Having won over many of the local party officials and having pioneered\nvillage cooperation on their own, they were not about to let themselves simply\nbe absorbed into bureaucratic party routines. When each family in these\nvillages was ordered to grow one acre of fire-cured tobacco, a crop they\nconsidered to be labor-intensive and without profit, they openly protested\nthrough their organization. In 1968, following a high-level visit by TANU's\ncentral committee, the RDA was officially banned as an illegal organization,\nits assets seized, and its functions assumed by the party and bureaucracy.33\nAlthough it put into practice Nyerere's espoused goals, its refusal to fit\ninto the centralized scheme of the party was fatal.\n\n#### \"To Live in Villages Is an Order\"\n\nWith his order of December 1973,34 Nyerere ended a period of villagization\nmarked by sporadic but unauthorized coercion and put the entire machinery of\nthe state behind compulsory, universal villagization.31 Whatever restraining\ninfluence that his public disavowal of the use of force had provided was now\nnullified; it was replaced by the desire of the party and bureaucracy to\nproduce the quick results he wanted. Villagization was, after all, for their\nown benefit, as Juma Mwapachu, an official in charge of forced settlement in\nthe district of Shinyanga, explained. \"The 1974 Operation [Planned] Villages\nwas not to be a matter of persuasion but of coercion. As Nyerere argued, the\nmove had to be compulsory because Tanzania could not sit back seeing the\nmajority of its people leading a 'life of death.' The State, had, therefore,\nto take the role of the 'father' in ensuring that its people chose a better\nand more prosperous life for themselves .\"311 New villages and communal\nfarming had been an official policy priority at least since 1967, but the\nresults had been a disappointment. Now it was time to insist on village\nliving, Nyerere claimed, as the only way to promote development and increased\nproduction. The official term employed after 1973 was \"planned\" villages (not\n\"ujamaa\" villages), presumably to distinguish them both from the communal-\nproduction regime of ujamaa villages, which had failed, and from the unplanned\nsettlements and homesteads in which Tanzanians now resided.\n\nThe actual campaign was called Operation Planned Villages, conjuring in the\npopular mind images of military operations. And so it was. The operational\nplan specified, by the book, a six-phase sequence: \"educate [or \"politicize\"]\nthe people, search for a suitable site, inspect the location, plan the village\nand demarcate the land clearly, train the officials in the methodology of\nujamaa, and resettlement.\"37 The sequence was both inevitable and involuntary.\nGiven the \"crash\" nature of the campaign, educating the people did not mean\nasking their consent; it meant telling them that they had to move and why it\nwas in their best interest. The pace was, moreover, double-quick. The dress\nrehearsal in Dodoma in 1970 had allowed planning teams one day per village\nplan; the new campaign stretched the planning apparatus even thinner.\n\nNor was the speed of the operation a mere by-product of administrative haste.\nThe planners felt that the shock of lightning-quick settle ment would have a\nsalutary effect. It would rip the peasantry from their traditional\nsurroundings and networks and would put them down in entirely new settings\nwhere, it was hoped, they could then be more readily remade into modern\nproducers following the instructions of experts.31 In a larger sense, of\ncourse, the purpose of forced settlement is always disorientation and then\nreorientation. Colonial schemes for state farms or private plantations, as\nwell as the many plans to create a class of progressive yeoman farmers,\noperated on the assumption that revolutionizing the living arrangements and\nworking environments of people would transform them fundamentally. Nyerere was\nfond of contrasting the loose, autonomous work rhythms of traditional\ncultivators with the tight-knit, interdependent discipline of the factory.39\nDensely settled villages with cooperative production would move the Tanzanian\npopulation toward that ideal.\n\nRural Tanzanians were understandably reluctant to move into new communities\nplanned by the state. Their past experience, whether before independence or\nafter, warranted their skepticism. As cultivators and pastoralists, they had\ndeveloped patterns of settlement and, in many cases, patterns of periodic\nmovements that were finely tuned adaptations to an often stingy environment\nwhich they knew exceptionally well. The state-mandated movement threatened to\ndestroy the logic of this adaptation. Administrative convenience, not\necological considerations, governed the selection of sites; they were often\nfar from fuelwood and water, and their population often exceeded the carrying\ncapacity of the land. As one specialist foresaw: \"Unless villagization can be\ncoupled with infrastructural inputs to create a novel technology to master the\nenvironment, the nucleated settlement pattern may, by itself, be counter-\nproductive in economic terms and destructive of the ecological balance\nmaintained under the traditional settlement pattern. Nucleated settlement will\nmean over-crowding ... with people and domestic animals and the accompanying\nsoil erosion, gully formation, and dust bowls which are common features in\nsituations where the human initiative has suddenly overtaxed the carrying\ncapacity of the land .\"40\n\nGiven the resistance of the population and the bureaucratic-military\nimperative of a crash program, violence was inevitable. Threats were all but\nuniversal. Those slated to move were again told that famine relief would be\naccorded only to those who moved peacefully. The militia and the army were\nmobilized to provide transport and to compel compliance. People were told that\nif they did not pull down their houses and load them into the government\ntrucks, the authorities would pull down the houses. In order to prevent those\nforcibly moved from re turning, many homes were burned. Typical of the reports\nthat came out of Tanzania was the following description by a student in the\npoor region of Kigoma: \"Force and brutality was used. The police were the ones\nempowered together with some government officials. For example at Katanazuza\nin Kalinzi,... the police had to take charge physically. In some areas where\npeasants refused to pack their belongings and board the Operation lorries and\ntrucks, their houses were destroyed through burning or pulling them down.\nHouse destruction was witnessed in Nyange village. It became a routine order\nof the day. And the peasants had unconditionally to shift. It was a forceful\nvillagization in some villages .\"41 When the peasantry realized that open\nresistance was dangerous and probably futile, they saved what they could,\noften fleeing the new village at the first opportunity.42\n\nSuch incentives as clinics, piped water, and schools were offered to those who\nwent peacefully. Sometimes they did, although they tried to insist on a\nwritten contract with officials and to require that the new services promised\nthem be established before they moved. Positive inducements were, apparently,\nmore typical of the early, voluntary phase of villagization than the later,\ncompulsory phase. A few regions were little affected; officials there simply\ndesignated many existing settlements as planned villages and left it at that.\nThere was both an economic and political logic to the exclusions. Wealthy,\ndensely settled areas such as West Lake and Kilimanjaro were largely spared\nfor three reasons: farmers there were already living in populous villages;\ntheir undisturbed productivity in cash crops was vital for state revenues and\nforeign exchange; and the groups residing in these areas were overrepresented\namong the bureaucratic elite. Some critics suggested that the higher the\nproportion of government officials from an area, the later (and more\ndesultory) its villagization.43\n\nWhen Nyerere learned exactly how thin was the fiction of persuasion and how\nwidespread were the brutalities, he expressed his dismay. He decried the\nfailure to compensate peasants for their destroyed huts and allowed that some\nofficials had moved people to unsuitable locations that lacked water or\nsufficient arable land. \"Despite our official policies and despite all our\ndemocratic institutions, some leaders do not listen to the people,\" he\nadmitted. \"They find it much easier to tell people what to do.\"44 But it was\n\"absurd to pretend that these cases were typical of villagization;'45 let\nalone to call off the campaign. Nyerere wanted local authorities to be\nknowledgeable, close to the people, and persuasive in putting across state\npolicy; he did not, any more than Lenin did, want them to obey the people's\nwishes. Not surprisingly, the sources agree that virtually all village\nmeetings were one way affairs of lectures, explanations, instructions,\nscoldings, promises, and warnings. The assembled villagers were expected to be\nwhat Sally Falk Moore has appropriately called \"ratifying bodies public,\"\ngiving populist legitimacy to decisions made elsewhere.46 Far from achieving\nthis populist legitimacy, the villagization campaign created only an\nalienated, skeptical, demoralized, and uncooperative peasantry for which\nTanzania would pay a huge price, both financially and politically.47\n\n##### A Streamlined People and Their Crops\n\nThe planned new villages followed both a bureaucratic logic and an aesthetic\nlogic. Nyerere and his planners had a visual idea of just how a modern village\nshould look. Such visual ideas become powerful tropes. Take the word\n\"streamline,\" for example. \"Streamlining\" has become a powerful image for\nmodern forms, conveying economy, sleekness, efficiency, and minimal friction\nor resistance. Politicians and administrators hasten to cash in on the\nsymbolic capital behind the term by declaring that they will streamline this\nagency or that corporation, allowing the audience's visual imagination to fill\nin the details of a bureaucratic equivalent of a sleek locomotive or jet. Thus\nit is that a term that has a specific, contextual meaning in one field\n(aerodynamics) comes to be generalized to subjects where its meaning is more\nvisual and aesthetic than scientific. Above all, as we shall see, the\naesthetic of the new village was a negation of the past. First, however, to\nthe administrative logic.\n\nWhat greeted Nyerere when he visited new villages in the district of Shinyanga\n(northwest Tanzania) in early 1975 was fairly typical of bureaucratic haste\nand insensibility.48 Some of the villages were laid out as \"one long street of\nhouses stretching for miles like the wagons of a locomotive.\"49 It appeared to\nNyerere that this was a crude case of simply \"dumping\" the settlers. But such\nlinear villages did have a curious logic behind them. Administrators had a\npenchant for locating new villages along the major roads, where they could be\nmost easily reached and monitored.SO Roadside siting rarely made economic\nsense; it did, on the other hand, demonstrate how the goal of extending the\nstate's control over the peasantry often trumped the state's other goal of\nraising agricultural production. As Stalin had learned, a captured peasantry\nwas not necessarily a productive peasantry.\n\nThe visual aesthetics of how a proper new village should look combined\nelements of administrative regularity, tidiness, and legibility linked to an\noverall Cartesian order. This was the modern administra tive village, and it\nwas implicitly associated with a modern, disciplined, and productive\npeasantry. One astute observer, sympathetic to the aims of villagization,\nnoted the overall effect. \"The new approach,\" he explained, \"was more in line\nwith bureaucratic thinking and with what a bureaucracy can do effectively:\nenforced movement of the peasants into new 'modern' settlements, i.e.,\nsettlements with houses placed close together, in straight lines, along the\nroads, and with the fields outside the nucleated village, organized in block\nfarms, each block containing the villager's individual plots, but with only\none type of crop, and readily accessible for control by the agricultural\nextension officer and eventual cultivation by government tractors.\"\"\n\nAs the exercise of village creation was repeated, the administrative image of\nthe modern village became increasingly codified, a known protocol that almost\nany bureaucrat could reproduce. \"The first response of the West Lake leaders,\nwhen they were called upon to implement ujamaa in the Region, was to think of\nresettlement. Creating new settlements had several advantages. They were\nhighly visible, and easy to organize right from the beginning in the orderly,\nnice looking way preferred by bureaucrats with the houses and shambas\n[gardens, farms] in straight lines, etc.\"\" Reconstructing the historical\nlineage of this composite picture of modern rural life would be fascinating,\nalthough tangential to our purposes. No doubt it owes something to colonial\npolicy and hence to the look of the modern European rural landscape, and we\nalso know that Nyerere was impressed with what he saw on his trips to the\nSoviet Union and to China. What is significant, however, is that the modern\nplanned village in Tanzania was essentially a point-by-point negation of\nexisting rural practice, which included shifting cultivation and pastoralism;\npolycropping; living well off the main roads; kinship and lineage authority;\nsmall, scattered settlements with houses built higgledy-piggledy; and\nproduction that was dispersed and opaque to the state. The logic of this\nnegation seemed often to prevail over sound ecological or economic\nconsiderations.\n\n##### Communal Farming and Intensive Production\n\nCollecting Tanzanians into villages was seen from the very beginning as a\nnecessary step in establishing completely new forms of agricultural production\nin which the state would play the major role. The first five-year plan was\nexplicit.\n\nAlthough the improvement approach [as opposed to the transformation approach]\ncan contribute to increasing production in ... zones [with low and irregular\nrainfall], it cannot in all events give rise to very sub stantial results\nbecause of the dispersal of the farm producers, the impoverishment of the\nsoils by the practice of bush burning and considerable difficulties in\nmarketing products. The policy which Government has decided to pursue with\nrespect to all these zones consists in re-grouping and re-settling farmers on\nthe most favorable soil, installing there a system of private or collective\nownership and introducing supervised crop rotation and mixed farming that\nwould permit the maintenance of soil fertility.53\n\nThe population concentrated in planned villages would, by degrees, grow cash\ncrops (as specified by the agricultural experts) on communal fields with\nstate-supplied machinery. Their housing, their local administration, their\nagricultural practices, and, most important, their workdays would be overseen\nby state authorities.\n\nThe forced villagization campaign itself had such a disastrous effect on\nagricultural production that the state was in no position to press ahead\nimmediately with full-scale communal farming. Huge imports of food were\nnecessary from 1973 through 1975.54 Nyerere declared that the 1.2 billion\nshillings spent for food imports would have bought one cow for every Tanzanian\nfamily. Roughly 60 percent of the new villages were located on semiarid land\nunsuitable for permanent cultivation, requiring peasants to walk long\ndistances to reach viable plots. The chaos of the move itself and the slow\nprocess of adapting to a new ecological setting meant further disruptions of\nproduction.55\n\nUntil 1975, the state's effort to control production outside its own state\nschemes took the classic colonial form: laws mandating that each household\ngrow certain crops on a minimum number of acres. A variety of fines and\npenalties were deployed to enforce these measures. In one region, officials\nannounced that no one would be allowed to go to market or ride a bus unless he\ncould prove that he was cultivating the required seven and one-half acres of\nland. In another case, famine relief was withheld until each villager had\nplanted one acre of cassava in accordance with the minimum acreage law.',' One\nmajor source of the conflict leading to the dissolution of the Ruvuma ujamaa\nvillages was the forced cultivation of fire-cured tobacco at what the\nvillagers took to be confiscatory prices. As the colonizers had understood\nlong before, forced cultivation of this kind could be successfully imposed\nonly on a peasantry that was physically concentrated and therefore able to be\nmonitored and, if necessary, disciplined.57\n\nThe next step was regulated, communal production.5\" This form of cultivation\nwas anticipated in the Villages and Ujamaa Villages Act (1975), which\nestablished \"village collective farms\" and required village authorities to\ndraw up annual work plans and production targets.\n\nIn practice, the size of each communal field and its production plan were\ntypically set by an agricultural field officer (who was eager to please his\nsuperiors) and the village chief, with little or no wider con- sultation.19\nThe result was a labor plan that bore no relation to the seasonal supply of\nlocal labor, let alone the peasants' own goals. Work on the collective village\nfarm was experienced as little different from corvee labor. Villagers had no\nchoice in the matter, and it was rare for their work to yield a profit. Even\nthough extension agents were directed to devote their efforts exclusively to\nthe communal fields, the crops were often unsuitable, the soil infertile, the\nseed and fertilizer late to arrive, and the promised tractor with plow nowhere\nin sight. These shortcomings, plus the provision that any profit (a very rare\nevent) from the communal field could be counted as revenue for the village\ncommittee, meant that the work was deeply resented.\n\nIn theory, the system of political and labor control was thorough and\ninescapable. Villages were divided into sections (mitaa) and each section into\nseveral cells (mashina, made up of ten households). The residential order was\nreplicated on the communal fields. Each section was responsible for the\ncultivation of a segment of the communal field, and within that segment, each\ncell was responsible for a corresponding fragment. Again in theory, the cell\nleader was responsible for labor mobilization and surveillance.60\nStructurally, then, the parallels in the residential and labor-disciplinary\nhierarchies were designed to make them perfectly transparent and legible to\nthe authorities.\n\nIn practice, the system broke down quickly. The areas actually under communal\ncultivation were typically far smaller than the figures officially reported.61\nMost section and village authorities were content to go through the motions\nwhen it came to communal cultivation. And they were reluctant to impose fines\non their neighbors who neglected the labor rules in order to tend to their\nall-important private plots.\n\nAs a response to such pervasive foot-dragging, many communal fields were\ndivided up, and each household was made responsible for cultivating, say, half\nan acre.62 It was no longer necessary to coordinate labor for working a single\nlarge field, and the responsibility for cultivation, and hence sanctions,\ncould now be pinpointed. The new system resembled the colonial forced\ncultivation system, with one difference: the plots were physically\nconsolidated for easier supervision. Still, the absence of any appreciable\nreturn from this labor meant that each household focused on its private\nholding and treated the communal plot as an onerous residual activity, despite\noccasional official warnings that the priorities should be inverted.63 The\ndisparity in yields naturally reflected the disparity in attention.\n\nThe aim of Tanzanian rural policy from 1967 through the early 1980s was to\nreconfigure the rural population into a form that would allow the state to\nimpose its development agenda and, in the process, to control the work and\nproduction of cultivators. Nowhere is this more explicit than in the document\nfor the third five-year plan (1978): \"In the rural sector, the Party has had\ngreat success in resettling the rural peasantry in villages where it is now\npossible to identify able-bodied individuals able to work and also to identify\nthe acreage available for agricultural purposes.... The plan intends to make\nsure that in every workplace, rural or urban, our implementing organs set\nspecific work targets each year.... The village government will see to it that\nall Party policies in respect of development programmes are adhered to.\"64 In\ncase the purpose of visibility and control was doubted, the plan went on to\nexplain that agricultural development \"in our present conditions\" calls for\n\"setting up work timetables and production targets.\"65 Communal farms (now\ncalled village government farms) were mandated. But as Henry Bernstein notes,\nwith the incomplete collectivization of land and the unwillingness to resort\nto truly draconian enforcement measures, these communal farms were bound to\nfounder.66\n\nThe underlying premise of Nyerere's agrarian policy, for all its rhetorical\nflourishes in the direction of traditional culture, was little different from\nthat of colonial agrarian policy. That premise was that the practices of\nAfrican cultivators and pastoralists were backward, unscientific, inefficient,\nand ecologically irresponsible. Only close supervision, training, and, if need\nbe, coercion by specialists in scientific agriculture could bring them and\ntheir practices in line with a modern Tanzania. They were the problem to which\nthe agricultural experts were the solution.\n\nIt was precisely the assumption, to quote a Tanzanian civil servant, of a\n\"traditional outlook and unwillingness to change\"6' that required the entire\nseries of agricultural schemes, from ujamaa villages to forced relocation to\nthe supervised cultivation launched by the colonial and the independent\nregimes. This view of the peasantry permeates the 1964 World Bank report and\nthe first Tanganyikan five-year plan. Although the plan notes that\n\"significant inroads have been made into the conservatism of the rural\npopulation, who as they become organized into co-operatives, respond\nencouragingly,\"61 it argues that more extensive measures are called for. Thus\nthe 1964 plan declares: \"How to overcome the destructive conservatism of the\npeople, and generate the drastic agrarian reforms which must be effected if\nthe country is to survive is one of the most difficult problems the political\nleaders of Tanzania have to face.\"69\n\nNyerere entirely agreed with the majority of the extension officials, who\nbelieved that their job was to \"overcome [the farmers'] apathy and attachment\nto outmoded practices.\"70 He and the World Bank saw eyeto-eye in having the\nfirst plan provide for sixty new settlement schemes in which farmers who\nfollowed the rules would receive land. There is no mistaking this picture of a\nwillfully ignorant and less than diligent class of cultivators in Nyerere's\nfirst broadcast as prime minister in 1961: \"If you have cotton unpicked on\nyour shamba, if you have cultivated half an acre less than you could\ncultivate, if you are letting the soil run needlessly off your land, or if\nyour shamba is full of weeds, if you deliberately ignore the advice given you\nby the agricultural experts, then you are a traitor in the battle.\"\"\n\nThe logical counterpart to the lack of faith of the ordinary cultivator was\nthe hyperfaith of the agricultural experts and the \"blind faith in machines\nand large scale operations.\"72 Just as the planned village was a vast\n\"improvement\" in legibility and control over past settlement practices, the\nplanned agriculture offered by the experts was, in its legibility and order,\nan \"improvement\" on the infinite variety and muddle of smallholdings and their\nexisting techniques.73 In the new villages, the settlers' private plots\n(shambas) were generally mapped out by surveyors and were trim, square or\nrectangular plots of equal size, placed side by side in straight rows (figure\n31). Their design followed the same logic as the segmented communal plots: a\nlogic of clarity and administrative ease rather than agronomic sense. Thus\nwhen a scheme for tea cultivation was begun, the smallholders were required to\nplant their tea in a single block \"because it was easier for the extension\nstaff to work on tea that was planted in the same place.\"74\n\nThe order of the fields was replicated in the order of the plants within the\nfields. Tanzanian farmers often planted two or more crops together in the same\nfield (a technique variously called polycropping, intercropping, or relay\ncropping). In the coffee-growing areas, for example, coffee was often\ninterplanted with bananas, beans, and other annuals. For most agronomists,\nthis practice was anathema. As one dissenting specialist explained, \"The\nagricultural extension service has been encouraging farmers to plant pure-\nstand coffee and considering this practice the sine qua non of modern\nfarming.\"75 If the crop were bananas, the banana trees must also be in pure\nstands. Agricultural field officers judged their accomplishments by whether\neach crop under their supervision was planted in straight, properly spaced\nrows and was not mixed with any other cultigen.76 Like large-scale mechanized\nfarming, monocropping had a scientific rationale in particular contexts, but\nextension officers often promoted monocropping uncritically as an article of\nfaith in the catechism of modern farming. While empirical evidence was even\nthen mounting in favor of the ecological soundness and productivity of some\nintercropping regimes, the faith continued unabated. What is clear, however,\nis that monocropping and row planting vastly facilitate the work of\nadministrators and agronomists. Both techniques facilitate inspection and\ncalculations of acreage and yield; they greatly simplify field trials by\nminimizing the number of variables at play in any one field; they streamline\nthe job of extension recommendations and the supervision of cultivation; and,\nfinally, they simplify control of the harvest. The simplified and legible\nfield crop offers to state agricultural officers many of the same advantages\nthat the \"stripped-down\" commercial forest offered to scientific foresters and\nrevenue officers.\n\n##### Bureaucratic Convenience, Bureaucratic Interests\n\nAuthoritarian social engineering is apt to display the full range of standard\nbureaucratic pathologies. The transformations it wishes to effect cannot\ngenerally be brought about without applying force or without treating nature\nand human subjects as if they were functions in a few administrative routines.\nFar from being regrettable anomalies, these behavioral by-products are\ninherent in high-modernist campaigns of this kind. I am purposely ignoring\nhere the more obvious inhumanities that are inevitable whenever great power is\nplaced in the hands of largely unaccountable state authorities who are under\npressure from above to produce results despite popular resistance. Instead, I\nstress two key elements of the bureaucratic response typified by the ujamaa\nvillage campaign: first, the civil servants' inclination to reinterpret the\ncampaign so that it called for results that they could more easily deliver,\nand second, their disposition to reinterpret the campaign in line with what\nwas in their corporate interests.\n\n![](img0042.jpg)\n\n31\\. Plan for a ujamaa village: Makazi Mapya, Omulunazi, Rushwa, Tanzania\n\nThe first tendency was most readily apparent in the displacement of goals\ntoward strictly quantitative criteria of performance. What might be called a\n\"substantive ujamaa village,\" whose residents had freely consented to move,\nhad agreed on how to manage a communal plot, and were productive farmers\nmanaging their own local affairs (Nyerere's initial vision), was replaced by a\n\"notional ujamaa village,\" an integer that could be added to an avalanche of\nstatistics. Thus party cadres and civil servants, in showing how much they had\naccomplished, emphasized the numbers of people moved, new villages created,\nhouse lots and communal fields surveyed, wells drilled, areas cleared and\nplowed, tons of fertilizer delivered, and TANu branches set up. No matter if a\ngiven ujamaa village was not much more than a few truckloads of angry peasants\nand their belongings, unceremoniously dumped at a site marked off with a few\nsurveyors' stakes; it still counted as one ujamaa village to the officials'\ncredit. In addition, a pettifogging aesthetics might prevail over substance.\nThe desire to have all the houses in a planned village perfectly aligned,\nwhich was presumably linked to easy surveying and the desire to please the\ninspecting officials, might require that a house be dismantled in order to\nmove it a scant fifty feet to the surveyor's line.\"\n\nThe \"productivity of the political apparatus\" was judged by numerical results\nthat permitted aggregation and, perhaps more important, comparisons.\" And when\nofficials realized that their futures depended on producing impressive figures\nquickly, a process of competitive emulation was unleashed. One official\ndescribed the atmosphere that caused him to abandon an initial strategy of\nselective implementation and to plunge ahead.\n\nThis [strategy] was found to be unworkable, for two main reasons. First, there\nwas a competitive attitude (particularly between regions) with all its\npolitical overtones. Here was a moment for self-aggrandizement by proving\nability to mobilize a rural population wholesale. Reports were coming in from\nMara Region that they were about to complete their op eration when we had not\nstarted at all. Top party officials were heralding and positively reinforcing\nthe achievements of resettlement in Geita District. Who, in such\ncircumstances, would have wished to lag behind? Political leaders therefore\ncalled for quick measures to complete the resettlement exercise in a short\ntime. Such a rushed exercise caused problems, of course, in the form of poorly\nplanned villages.79\n\nNyerere, necessarily perceiving the campaign largely through sets of\nstatistics and self-congratulatory official reports, exacerbated the\ncompetitive atmosphere. His glowing report to TANU was a delirium of numbers,\ntargets, and percentages.80\n\nConsider, for example, the question of villagization. In my report to the 1973\nTANU Conference I was able to say that 2,028,164 people were living in\nvillages. Two years later, in June 1975, I reported to the next TANU\nConference that approximately 9,100,000 people were living in village\ncommunities. Now there are about 13,065,000 people living together in 7,684\nvillages. This is a tremendous achievement. It is an achievement of TANU and\nGovernment leaders in cooperation with the people of Tanzania. It means that\nsomething like 70% of our people have moved their homes in the space of about\nthree years.R1\n\nThe second, and surely most ominous, deflection of the ujamaa campaign brought\noff by state authorities was to see that its implementation systematically\nserved to underwrite their status and power. As Andrew Coulson has\nperceptively noted, in the actual process of creating new villages, the\nadministrators and party officials (themselves competitors) effectively evaded\nall those policies that would have diminished their privileges and power while\nexaggerating those that reinforced their corporate sway. Thus such ideas as\nallowing small ujamaa villages like Ruvuma to operate free of government\ninterference (before 1968), pupils' involvement in decision making in schools\n(1969), workers' participation in management (1969-70), and the power to elect\nvillage councils and leadership (1973-75) were all honored in the breach.\"'\nHigh-modernist social engineering is ideal soil for authoritarian pretensions,\nand Tanzanian officialdom made the most of this chance to consolidate its\nposition.83\n\n##### The Idea ova \"National Plantation\"\n\nVillagization was meant to radically concentrate Tanzania's peasantry in order\nto regiment it politically and economically. If it worked, it would transform\nthe dispersed, autonomous, and illegible populations that had thus far eluded\nmost of the state policies they found onerous. The planners pictured, instead,\na population settled in government designed villages under tight\nadministrative control, planting communal fields in which pure-stand crops\nwere grown according to state specifications. If we allow for the continued\nexistence of substantial private plots and the (related) weakness of labor\ncontrol, the whole scheme came perilously close to looking like a vast, albeit\nnoncontiguous, state plantation. What a neutral observer might have taken as a\nnew form of servitude, however benevolent, was largely unquestioned by the\nelites, for the policy sailed under the banner of \"development.\"\n\nIt seems incredible, in retrospect, that any state could proceed with so much\nhubris and so little information and planning to the dislocation of so many\nmillion lives. It seems, again in retrospect, a wild and irrational scheme\nwhich was bound to fail both the expectations of its planners and the material\nand social needs of its hapless victims.\n\nThe inhumanities of compulsory villagization were magnified by the deeply\ningrained authoritarian habits of the bureaucracy and by the pell-mell rush of\nthe campaign. To concentrate on such administrative and political\nshortcomings, however, is to miss the point. Even if the campaign had been\ngranted more time, more technical skill, and a better \"bedside manner,\" the\nparty-state could not possibly have assembled and digested the information\nnecessary to make a fundamentally schematic plan succeed. The existing\neconomic activity and physical movement of the Tanzanian rural population were\nthe consequences of a mind-bogglingly complex, delicate, and pliable set of\nadaptations to their diverse social and material environment.84 As in the\ncustomary land-tenure arrangements examined in chapter 1, these adaptations\ndefy administrative codification because of their endless local variability,\ntheir elaboration, and their plasticity in the face of new conditions. If land\ntenure defies codification, then, it stands to reason that the connections\nstructuring the entire material and social life of each particular group of\npeasants would remain largely opaque to both specialists and administrators.\n\nUnder the circumstances, wholesale, by-the-book resettlement made a havoc of\npeasant lives. Only a few of the most obvious ecological failures of\nvillagization will serve to illustrate the pattern of ignorance. Peasants were\nforcibly moved from annually flooded lands that were vital to their cropping\nregime and shifted to poor soils on high ground. They were, as we have seen,\nmoved to all-weather roads where the soil was unfamiliar or unsuitable for the\ncrops envisaged. Village living placed cultivators far from their fields, thus\nthwarting the crop watching and pest control that more dispersed homesteads\nmade possible. The concentration of livestock and people often had the\nunfortunate consequence of encouraging cholera and livestock epidemics. For\nthe highly mobile Maasai and other pastoralists, the scheme of creating ujamaa\nranches by herding cattle to a single location was an unmitigated disaster for\nrange conservation and pastoral livelihoods.,\"\n\nThe failure of ujamaa villages was almost guaranteed by the highmodernist\nhubris of planners and specialists who believed that they alone knew how to\norganize a more satisfactory, rational, and productive life for their\ncitizens. It should be noted that they did have something to contribute to\nwhat could have been a more fruitful development of the Tanzanian countryside.\nBut their insistence that they had a monopoly on useful knowledge and that\nthey impose this knowledge set the stage for disaster.\n\nSettling people into supervised villages was emphatically not uniquely the\nbrainchild of the nationalist elites of independent Tanzania. Villagization\nhad a long colonial history in Tanzania and elsewhere, as program after\nprogram was devised to concentrate the population. The same techno-economic\nvision was shared, until very late in the game, by the World Bank, United\nStates Agency for International Development (usAID), and other development\nagencies contributing to Tanzanian development.\" However enthusiastic they\nwere in spearheading their campaign, the political leaders of Tanzania were\nmore consumers of a high-modernist faith that had originated elsewhere much\nearlier than they were producers.\n\nWhat was perhaps distinctive about the Tanzanian scheme was its speed, its\ncomprehensiveness, and its intention to deliver such collective services as\nschools, clinics, and clean water. Although considerable force was applied in\nseeing the scheme through, even then its consequences were not nearly as\nbrutal or irremediable as those of Soviet collectivization.\" The Tanzanian\nstate's relative weakness and unwillingness to resort to Stalinist methods\" as\nwell as the Tanzanian peasants' tactical advantages, including flight,\nunofficial production and trade, smuggling, and foot-dragging, combined to\nmake the practice of villagization far less destructive than the theory.\"'\n\n#### The \"Ideal\" State Village: Ethiopian Variation\n\nThe pattern of compulsory villagization in Ethiopia uncannily resembles that\nof Russia in its coerciveness and Tanzania in its ostensible rationale. Beyond\nthe obvious shared socialist terrain and official visits by Ethiopian\nofficials to Tanzania to observe its program in action,\" there seems to be a\ndeeper affinity at work between the assertion of state authority in the\ncountryside, on one hand, and the results in terms of process and actual\nphysical plans, on the other. The continuity of Nyerere's plans with those of\nthe colonizers is obvious in the Tanzanian case. In Ethiopia, which was never\ncolonized, resettlement can be seen as a century-old project of the imperial\ndynasty to subjugate nonAmharic-speaking peoples and, more generally, to bring\nfractious provinces under central control.\n\nAlthough the Marxist revolutionary elite that seized power in early 1974\nresorted to forced settlement at an early stage, its leader, Lieutenant\nColonel Mengistu Haile Mariam and the Dergue-the shadowy ruling body of the\nrevolutionary regime-did not call for full-scale villagization until 1985. The\npolicy anticipated the eventual resettlement of all 33 million rural\nEthiopians. Echoing Nyerere, Mengistu declared, \"The scattered and haphazard\nhabitation and livelihood of Ethiopian peasants cannot build socialism....\nInsofar as efforts are dispersed and livelihood is individual, the results are\nonly hand-to-mouth existence amounting to fruitless struggle and drudgery,\nwhich cannot build a prosperous society.\"`\" The other explanations for village\nsettlement were no different from those given in Tanzania: concentration would\nbring services to scattered populations, permit state-designed social\nproduction (producer cooperatives), and allow mechanization and political\neducation.92\n\nSocialism and its precondition, villagization, were virtually Men- gistu's way\nof saying \"modern.\" In his justification for massive resettlement, he decried\nEthiopia's reputation as \"a symbol of backwardness and a valley of ignorance.\"\nHe called on Ethiopians to \"rally together to free farming from the ugly\nforces of nature.\" Finally, he condemned pastoralism per se, praising\nvillagization as a way \"to rehabilitate our nomad society.\"93\n\nThe pace of resettlement, however, was far more brutal in Ethiopia,\ninadvertently helping to lay the groundwork for the subsequent rebellions that\nbrought down the regime. By March 1986, a scant year into the operation, the\nregime claimed that 4.6 million peasants had been settled in 4,500 villages.94\nOnly three months were allotted between the first \"agitation and propaganda\"\n(read, \"command\") and the move itself-often over huge distances. All accounts\nsuggest that many of the new settlements received almost nothing in the way of\nservices and had more of the aspect of a penal colony than of a functioning\nvillage.\n\nForced villagization in the Arsi region was apparently planned directly from\nthe center in Addis Ababa, with little or no local participation. There was a\nstrict template which local surveyors and administrators were ordered to\nfollow. The plan was carefully replicated in each location, inasmuch as this\nwas not a regime inclined to tolerate local improvisation. \"But the local\nrecruits learned their jobs well, for the villages and their 1,000 [square]\nmeter compounds, carefully marked by pegs and sod cuts, have followed the\ngeometric grid pattern required by the guidelines. In fact, some villages have\nbeen too rigidly laid out; for example, one farmer had to move his large,\nwellconstructed tukul [traditional thatched house] some 20 feet so that it\nwould be 'in line' with all the other buildings in its row.\"95\n\nThe close alignment between theory and practice can be seen by comparing the\nlayout of a government plan for an ideal village with an aerial photograph of\na new village (figures 32 and 33). Notice the central location of all key\ngovernment functions. A standardizing, round-number, bureaucratic mentality is\nobvious from the fact that each village was expected to have one thousand\ninhabitants and each compound one thousand square meters.96 If every village\nhad the same population and the same land allotment, a single model could\nsimply be applied everywhere; no local knowledge would be required. The\nidentical disposition of land in each settlement would make it that much\neasier for the authorities to send out general directives, to monitor crop\nproduction, and to control the harvest through the new Agricultural Marketing\nCorporation (AMC). The generic plan was particularly convenient for the hard-\npressed surveyors, precisely because it bore no relation whatever to local\necological, economic, or social patterns. In order to facilitate the uniform\ndesign of the cookie-cutter villages, the planning officials were directed to\nchoose flat, cleared sites and to insist on straight roads and similar,\nnumbered houses.97\n\nThe objects of this exercise in geometry were under no illusions about its\npurpose. When they were finally free to talk, refugees in Somalia told their\ninterviewers that the new settlement pattern was devised to control dissidence\nand rebellion, to prevent people from leaving, to \"make it easier to watch the\npeople,\" to control the crops, to register possessions and livestock, and (in\nWollega) to \"allow them to take our boys to war more easily.\"99\n\nIn \"model producer cooperatives,\" standardized housing was provided: square,\ntin-roofed houses (chika bets). Elsewhere, traditional housing (tukuls) were\ndisassembled and reconstructed in the rigidly stipulated order. As in Russia,\nall the private shops, tea houses, and small trading establishments were\nabolished, leaving only such state spaces as the village's mass organization\nand peasant association offices, literacy shed, health clinic, or state\ncooperative shop as public gathering places. In contrast to the Tanzanian\nexperience, the Ethiopian campaign had a much stronger military component, as\npeasants were moved great distances with a view to military pacification and\npolitical emasculation.99 Needless to say, the draconian conditions of\nEthiopian villagization meant that it was even more destructive of peasant\nlivelihoods and of the environment than its Tanzanian counterpart.100\n\nA full appreciation of the toll of forced resettlement in Ethiopia extends far\nbeyond the standard reports of starvation, executions, deforestation, and\nfailed crops. The new settlements nearly always failed their inhabitants as\nhuman communities and as units of food production. The very fact of massive\nresettlement nullified a precious legacy of local agricultural and pastoral\nknowledge and, with it, some thirty to forty thousand functioning communities,\nmost of them in regions that had regularly produced food surpluses.\n\nA typical cultivator in Tigray, a location singled out for harsh measures,\nplanted an average of fifteen crops a season (such cereal crops as teff,\nbarley, wheat, sorghum, corn, millet; such root crops as sweet potatoes,\npotatoes, onions; some legumes, including horsebeans, lentils, and chickpeas;\nand a number of vegetable crops, including peppers, okra, and many others).101\nIt goes without saying that the farmer was familiar with each of several\nvarieties of any crop, when to plant it, how deeply to sow it, how to prepare\nthe soil, and how to tend and harvest it. This knowledge was place specific in\nthe sense that the successful growing of any variety required local knowledge\nabout rainfall and soils, down to and including the peculiarities of each plot\nthe farmer cultivated. 101 It was also place specific in the sense that much\nof this knowledge was stored in the collective memory of the locality: an oral\narchive of techniques, seed varieties, and ecological information.\n\n![](img0043.jpg)\n\n32\\. A government plan for a standard socialist village, Arsi region,\nEthiopia. The layout shows 1, a mass organization office; 2, a kindergarten;\n3, a health clinic; 4, a state cooperative shop; 5, peasant association\noffice; 6, reserve plots; 7, a primary school; 8, a sports field; 9, a seed-\nmultiplication center; 10, a handicrafts center; and 11, an animal-breeding\nstation. Detail 12 depicts an enlargement of compound sites, and detail 13 is\nan enlargement of two sites, showing the neighborhood latrine at 14.\n\nOnce the farmer was moved, often to a vastly different ecological setting, his\nlocal knowledge was all but useless. As Jason Clay emphasizes, \"Thus, when a\nfarmer from the highlands is transported to settlement camps in areas like\nGambella, he is instantly transformed from an agricultural expert to an\nunskilled, ignorant laborer, completely dependent for his survival on the\ncentral government.\"\"' Resettlement was far more than a change in scenery. It\ntook people from a setting in which they had the skills and resources to\nproduce many of their own basic needs and hence the means of a reasonably\nselfsufficient independence. It then transferred them to a setting where these\nskills were of little or no avail. Only in such circumstances was it possible\nfor camp officials to reduce migrants to mendicants whose obedience and labor\ncould be exacted for subsistence rations.\n\n![](img0044.jpg)\n\n33\\. Aerial view of a resettlement site in southwestern Ethiopia, 1986\n\nAlthough the drought that coincided with forced migration in Ethiopia was real\nenough, much of the famine to which international aid agencies responded was a\nproduct of the massive resettlement. 104 The destruction of social ties was\nalmost as productive of famine as were the crop failures induced by poor\nplanning and ignorance of the new agricultural environment. Communal ties,\nrelations with kin and affines, networks of reciprocity and cooperation, local\ncharity and dependence had been the principal means by which villagers had\nmanaged to survive periods of food shortage in the past. Stripped of these\nsocial resources by indiscriminate deportations, often separated from their\nimmediate family and forbidden to leave, the settlers in the camps were far\nmore vulnerable to starvation than they had been in their home regions.\n\nThe immanent logic, never achieved, of the Dergue's rural policy is telling.\nIf implemented successfully, rural Ethiopians would have been permanently\nsettled along the main roads in large, legible villages, where uniform,\nnumbered houses would have been set in a grid centered on the headquarters of\nthe peasant association (that is, the party), where the chairman, his\ndeputies, and the militia maintained their posts. Designated crops would have\nbeen grown collectively, with machinery, on flat fields laid out uniformly by\nstate surveyors and then harvested for delivery to state agencies for\ndistribution and sale abroad. Labor would have been closely supervised by\nexperts and cadres. Intended to modernize Ethiopian agriculture and, not\nincidentally, to strengthen the control of the Dergue, the policy was\nliterally fatal to hundreds of thousands of cultivators and, finally, to the\nDergue itself.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn quiet and untroubled times, it seems to every administrator that it is only\nby his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going, and in\nthis consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief\nreward of his labor and efforts. While the sea of history remains calm the\nruleradministrator in his frail bark, holding it with a boat hook to the ship\nof the people and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the\nship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to\nheave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship\nmoves independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer\nreaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead of\nappearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless,\nfeeble man.\n\n-Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace\n\nThe conflict between the officials and specialists actively planning the\nfuture on one hand and the peasantry on the other has been billed by the first\ngroup as a struggle between progress and obscurantism, rationality and\nsuperstition, science and religion. Yet it is apparent from the high-modernist\nschemes we have examined that the \"rational\" plans they imposed were often\nspectacular failures. As units of production, as human communities, or as a\nmeans of delivering services, the planned villages failed the people they were\nintended, sometimes sincerely, to serve. In the long run they even failed\ntheir originators as units of growing appropriation or as a way of securing\nthe loyalty of the rural population, although they may have still served\neffectively, in the short run at least, as a way of detaching a population\nfrom its customary social network and thus thwarting collective protest.\n\n##### High Modernism and the Optics of Power\n\nIf the plans for villagization were so rational and scientific, why did they\nbring about such general ruin? The answer, I believe, is that such plans were\nnot scientific or rational in any meaningful sense of those terms. What these\nplanners carried in their mind's eye was a certain aesthetic, what one might\ncall a visual codification of modern rural production and community life. Like\na religious faith, this visual codification was almost impervious to criticism\nor disconfirming evidence. The belief in large farms, monocropping, \"proper\"\nvillages, tractorplowed fields, and collective or communal farming was an\naesthetic conviction undergirded by a conviction that this was the way in\nwhich the world was headed-a teleology. 101 For all but a handful of\nspecialists, these were not empirical hypotheses derived from particular\ncontexts in the temperate West that would have to be carefully examined in\npractice. In a given historical and social context-say, wheat growing by\nfarmers breaking new ground on the plains of Kansas-many elements of this\nfaith might have made sense.106 As a faith, however, it was generalized and\napplied uncritically in widely divergent settings with disastrous results.\n\nIf the proverbial man from Mars were to stumble on the facts here, he could be\nforgiven if he were confused about exactly who was the empiricist and who was\nthe true believer. Tanzanian peasants had, for example, been readjusting their\nsettlement patterns and farming practices in accordance with climate changes,\nnew crops, and new markets with notable success in the two decades before\nvillagization. They seemed to have an eminently empirical, albeit cautious,\noutlook on their own practices. By contrast, specialists and politicians\nseemed to be in the unshakable grip of a quasi-religious enthusiasm made even\nmore potent in being backed by the state.\n\nThis was not just any faith. It had a direct relation to the status and\ninterests of its bearers. Because the bearers of this visual codification saw\nthemselves as self-conscious modernizers of their societies, their vision\nrequired a sharp and morally loaded contrast between what looked modern (tidy,\nrectilinear, uniform, concentrated, simplified, mechanized) and what looked\nprimitive (irregular, dispersed, complicated, unmechanized). As the technical\nand political elite with a monopoly on modern education, they used this visual\naesthetic of progress to define their historic mission and to enhance their\nstatus.\n\nTheir modernist faith was self-serving in other respects as well. The very\nidea of a national plan, which would be devised at the capital and would then\nreorder the periphery after its own image into quasi-military units obeying a\nsingle command, was profoundly centralizing. Each unit at the periphery was\ntied not so much to its neighboring settlement as to the command center in the\ncapital; the lines of communication rather resembled the converging lines used\nto organize perspective in early Renaissance paintings. \"The convention of\nperspective ... centers everything in the eye of the beholder. It is like a\nbeam from a lighthouse-only instead of travelling outward, appearances travel\nin. The conventions called those appearances reality. Perspective makes the\nsingle eye the center of the visible world. Everything converges on the eye as\nto the vanishing point of infinity. The visible world is arranged for the\nspectator as the universe was once thought to be arranged for God.\"107\n\nThe image of coordination and authority aspired to here recalls that of mass\nexercises-thousands of bodies moving in perfect unison according to a\nmeticulously rehearsed script. When such coordination is achieved, the\nspectacle may have several effects. The demonstration of mass coordination,\nits designers hope, will awe spectators and participants with its display of\npowerful cohesion. The awe is enhanced by the fact that, as in the Taylorist\nfactory, only someone outside and above the display can fully appreciate it as\na totality; the individual participants at ground level are small molecules\nwithin an organism whose brain is elsewhere. The image of a nation that might\noperate along these lines is enormously flattering to elites at the apex-and,\nof course, demeaning to a population whose role they thus reduce to that of\nciphers. Beyond impressing observers, such displays may, in the short run at\nleast, constitute a reassuring self-hypnosis which serves to reinforce the\nmoral purpose and self-confidence of the elites. 101\n\nThe modernist visual aesthetic that animated planned villages has a curiously\nstatic quality to it. It is rather like a completed picture that cannot be\nimproved upon.109 Its design is the result of scientific and technical laws,\nand the implicit assumption is that, once built, the task then becomes one of\nmaintaining its form. The planners aim to have each new village look like the\nlast. Like a Roman military commander entering a new camp, the official\narriving from Dar es Salaam would know exactly where everything could be\nfound, from the TANU headquarters to the peasant association and the health\nclinic. Every field and every house would also, in principle, be nearly\nidentical and located according to an overall scheme. To the degree that this\nvision had been realized in practice, it would have made absolutely no\nconnections to the particularities of place and time. It would be a view from\nnowhere. Instead of the unrepeatable variety of settlements closely adjusted\nto local ecology and subsistence routines and instead of the constantly\nchanging local response to shifts in demography, climate, and markets, the\nstate would have created thin, generic villages that were uniform in\neverything from political structure and social stratification to cropping\ntechniques. The number of variables at play would be minimized. In their\nperfect legibility and sameness, these villages would be ideal, substitutable\nbricks in an edifice of state planning. Whether they would function was\nanother matter.\n\n##### The Failure of Grids\n\nIdeas cannot digest reality.\n\n-Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nIt is far easier for would-be reformers to change the formal structure of an\ninstitution than to change its practices. Redesigning the lines and boxes in\nan organizational chart is simpler than changing how that organization in fact\noperates. Changing the rules and regulations is simpler than eliciting\nbehavior that conforms to them. 10 Redesigning the physical layout of a\nvillage is simpler than transforming its social and productive life. For\nobvious reasons, political elitesparticularly authoritarian high-modernist\nelites-typically begin with changes in the formal structure and rules. Such\nlegal and statutory changes are the most accessible and the easiest to\nrearrange.\n\nAnyone who has worked in a formal organization-even a small one strictly\ngoverned by detailed rules-knows that handbooks and written guidelines fail\nutterly in explaining how the institution goes successfully about its work.\nAccounting for its smooth operation are nearly endless and shifting sets of\nimplicit understandings, tacit coor dinations, and practical mutualities that\ncould never be successfully captured in a written code. This ubiquitous social\nfact is useful to employees and labor unions. The premise behind what are\ntellingly called work-to-rule strikes is a case in point. When Parisian taxi\ndrivers want to press a point on the municipal authorities about regulations\nor fees, they sometimes launch a work-to-rule strike. It consists merely in\nfollowing meticulously all the regulations in the Code routier and thereby\nbringing traffic throughout central Paris to a grinding halt. The drivers thus\ntake tactical advantage of the fact that the circulation of traffic is\npossible only because drivers have mastered a set of practices that have\nevolved outside, and often in contravention, of the formal rules.\n\nAny attempt to completely plan a village, a city, or, for that matter, a\nlanguage is certain to run afoul of the same social reality. A village, city,\nor language is the jointly created, partly unintended product of many, many\nhands. To the degree that authorities insist on replacing this ineffably\ncomplex web of activity with formal rules and regulations, they are certain to\ndisrupt the web in ways that they cannot possibly foresee.\"' This point is\nmost frequently made by such proponents of laissez-faire as Friedrich Hayek,\nwho are fond of pointing out that a command economy, however sophisticated and\nlegible, cannot begin to replace the myriad, rapid, mutual adjustments of\nfunctioning markets and the price system.' 12 In this context, however, the\npoint applies in important ways to the even more complex patterns of social\ninteraction with the material environment that we call a city or a village.\nCities with a long history may be called \"deep\" or \"thick\" cities in the sense\nthat they are the historical product of a vast number of people from all\nstations (including officialdom) who are long gone. It is possible, of course,\nto build a new city or a new village, but it will be a \"thin\" or \"shallow\"\ncity, and its residents will have to begin (perhaps from known repertoires) to\nmake it work in spite of the rules. In cases like Brasilia or Tanzania's\nplanned villages, one can understand why state planners may prefer a freshly\ncleared site and a \"shocked\" population moved abruptly to the new setting in\nwhich the planners' influence is maximized. The alternative is to reform in\nsitu an existing, functioning community that has more social resources for\nresisting and refashioning the transformation planned for it.\n\nThe thinness of artificially designed communities can be compared to the\nthinness of artificially designed languages.13 Communities planned at a single\nstroke-Brasilia or the planned village in Tanzania or Ethiopia-are to older,\nunplanned communities as Esperanto is to, say, English or Burmese. One can in\nfact design a new language that in many respects is more logical, simpler,\nmore universal, and less irreg ular and that would technically lend itself to\nmore clarity and precision. This was, of course, precisely the objective of\nEsperanto's inventor, Lazar Zamenhof, who also imagined that Esperanto, which\nwas also known as international language, would eliminate the parochial\nnationalisms of Europe.' 14 Yet it is also perfectly obvious why Esperanto,\nwhich lacked a powerful state to enforce its adoption, failed to replace the\nexisting vernaculars or dialects of Europe. (As social linguists are fond of\nsaying, \"A national language is a dialect with an army.\") It was an\nexceptionally thin language, without any of the resonances, connotations,\nready metaphors, literature, oral history, idioms, and traditions of practical\nuse that any socially embedded language already had. Esperanto has survived as\na kind of utopian curiosity, a very thin dialect spoken by a handful of\nintelligentsia who have kept its promise alive.\n\n##### The Miniaturization of Perfection and Control\n\nThe pretense of authoritarian high-modernist schemes to discipline virtually\neverything within their ambit is bound to encounter intractable resistance.\nSocial inertia, entrenched privileges, international prices, wars,\nenvironmental change, to mention only a few factors, ensure that the results\nof high-modernist planning will look substantially different from what was\noriginally imagined. Such is even the case where, as in Stalinist\ncollectivization, the state devotes great resources to enforcing a high degree\nof formal compliance with its directives. Those who have their hearts set on\nrealizing such plans cannot fail to be frustrated by stubborn social realities\nand material facts.\n\nOne response to this frustration is a retreat to the realm of appearances and\nminiatures-to model cities and Potemkin villages, as it were.1' It is easier\nto build Brasilia than to fundamentally transform Brazil and Brazilians. The\neffect of this retreat is to create a small, relatively self-contained,\nutopian space where high-modernist aspirations might more nearly be realized.\nThe limiting case, where control is maximized but impact on the external world\nis minimized, is in the museum or the theme park. \"°\n\nThis miniaturization of perfection, I think, has a logic all its own, in spite\nof its implicit abandonment of large-scale transformations. Model villages,\nmodel cities, military colonies, show projects, and demonstration farms offer\npoliticians, administrators, and specialists an opportunity to create a\nsharply defined experimental terrain in which the number of rogue variables\nand unknowns are minimized. If, of course, such experiments make it\nsuccessfully from the pilot stage to general application, then they are a\nperfectly rational form of policy planning. There are advantages to\nminiaturization. The constriction of focus makes possible a far higher degree\nof social control and discipline. By concentrating the material and personnel\nresources of the state at a single point, miniaturization can approximate the\narchitecture, layout, mechanization, social services, and cropping patterns\nthat its vision calls for. Small islands of order and modernity, as Potemkin\nwell understood, are politically useful to officials who want to please their\nsuperiors with an example of what they can accomplish. If their superiors are\nsufficiently closeted and misinformed, they may mistake, as Catherine the\nGreat apparently did with Potemkin's convincing scenery, the exemplary\ninstance for the larger reality. '7 The effect is to banish at one place and\none time, in a kind of high-modernist version of Versailles and Le Petit\nTrianon, the larger loss of control.\n\nThe visual aesthetic of miniaturization seems significant as well. Just as the\narchitectural drawing, the model, and the map are ways of dealing with a\nlarger reality that is not easily grasped or manageable in its entirety, the\nminiaturization of high-modernist development offers a visually complete\nexample of what the future looks like.\n\nMiniaturization of one kind or another is ubiquitous. It is tempting to wonder\nwhether the human tendency to miniaturization-to create \"toys\" of larger\nobjects and realities that cannot so easily be manipulated-does not also have\na bureaucratic equivalent. Yi-fu Tuan has brilliantly examined how we\nminiaturize, and thereby domesticate, the larger phenomena that are outside\nour control, often with benign intentions. Under this elastic rubric, he\nincludes bonsai, bonseki, and gardens (a miniaturization of the plant world)\nalong with dolls and dollhouses, toy locomotives, toy soldiers and weapons of\nwar, and \"living toys\" in the form of specially bred fish and dogs.\"\" While\nTuan concentrates on more or less playful domestication, something of the same\ndesire for control and mastery can also, it would seem, operate on the larger\nscale of bureaucracies. Just as substantive goals, the achievement of which\nare hard to measure, may be supplanted by thin, notional statistics-the number\nof villages formed, the number of acres plowed-so may they also be supplanted\nby microenvironments of modernist order.\n\nCapital cities, as the seat of the state and of its rulers, as the symbolic\ncenter of (new) nations, and as the places where often powerful foreigners\ncome, are most likely to receive close attention as veritable theme parks of\nhigh-modernist development. Even in their contemporary secular guises,\nnational capitals retain something of the older tradition of being sacred\ncenters for a national cult. The symbolic power of high-modernist capitals\ndepends not, as it once did, on how well they represent a sacred past but\nrather on how fully they symbolize the utopian aspirations that rulers hold\nfor their nations. As ever, to be sure, the display is meant to exude power as\nwell as the authority of the past or of the future.\n\nColonial capitals were fashioned with these functions in mind. The imperial\ncapital of New Delhi, designed by Edwin Lutyens, was a stunning example of a\ncapital intended to overawe its subjects (and perhaps its own officials) with\nits scale and its grandeur, with its processional axes for parades\ndemonstrating military power and its triumphal arches. New Delhi was naturally\nintended as a negation of what then became Old Delhi. One central purpose of\nthe new capital was captured nicely by the private secretary to George V in a\nnote about the future residence of the British viceroy. It must, he wrote, be\n\"conspicuous and commanding,\" not dominated by the structures of past empires\nor by the features of the natural landscape. \"We must now let [the Indian] see\nfor the first time the power of Western science, art, and civilization.\"' 19\nStanding at its center for a ceremonial occasion, one might forget for a\nmoment that this tiny gem of imperial architecture was all but lost in a vast\nsea of Indian realities which either contradicted it or paid it no heed.\n\nA great many nations, some of them former colonies, have built entirely new\ncapitals rather than compromise with an urban past that their leaders were\ndetermined to transcend; one thinks of Brazil, Pakistan, Turkey, Belize,\nNigeria, the Ivory Coast, Malawi, and Tanza- nia.120 Most were built following\nthe plans of Western or Westerntrained architects, even when they attempted to\nincorporate references to vernacular building traditions. As Lawrence Vale\npoints out, many new capitals seem intended as completed and self-contained\nobjects. No subtraction, addition, or modification is contemplated-only\nadmiration. And in their strategic use of hills and elevation, of complexes\nset behind walls or water barriers, of finely graded structural hierarchy\nreflecting function and status, they also convey an impression of hegemony and\ndomination which was unlikely to prevail beyond the city limits.\",\n\nNyerere planned a new capital, Dodoma, that was to be somewhat different. The\nideological commitments of the regime were to be expressed in an architecture\nthat was purposely not monumental. Several interconnected settlements would\nundulate with the landscape, and the modest scale of the buildings would\neliminate the need for elevators and air conditioning. Dodoma was very\ndefinitely, however, intended to be a utopian space that both represented the\nfuture and explicitly negated Dar es Salaam. The master plan for Dodoma\ncondemned Dar as a \"dominant focus of development.... the antithesis of what\nTanzania is aiming for, and is growing at a pace, which if not checked, will\ndamage the city as a humanist habitat and Tanzania as an egalitarian\nsocialist-state.\"122 While planning villages for everyone else whether they\nliked it or not, the rulers also designed for themselves a new symbolic center\nincorporating, not by accident, I think, a hilltop refuge amidst manicured,\norderly surroundings.\n\nIf the intractable difficulties of transforming existing cities can lead to\nthe temptation to erect a model capital city, so can the difficulties of\ntransforming existing villages prompt a retreat into miniaturization. One\nmajor variant of this tendency was the creation of carefully controlled\nproduction environments by frustrated colonial extension officers. Coulson\nnotes the logic involved: \"If a farmer could not be forced, or persuaded, the\nonly alternatives were to ignore them altogether and go for mechanized\nagriculture controlled by outsiders (as in the Groundnuts Scheme, or on\nsettler farms controlled by Europeans), or to take them right away from the\ntraditional surroundings, to settlement schemes where in return for receiving\nland they might perhaps agree to follow the instructions of the agricultural\nstaff.\"\"'\n\nStill another variant was the attempt to distill out of the general population\na cadre of progressive farmers who would then be mobilized to practice modern\nagriculture. Such policies were followed in elaborate detail in Mozambique and\nwere important in colonial Tanzania as well. 124 When the state confronted a\n\"brick wall of peasant conservatism,\" notes a 1956 document from the\nTanganyika Department of Agriculture, it became necessary \"to withdraw the\neffort from some portions so as to concentrate on small selected points, a\nprocedure which has come to be known as the 'focal-point approach.\"' 121 In\ntheir desire to isolate the small sector of the agricultural population that\nthey thought would respond to scientific agriculture, the extension agents\nfrequently overlooked other realities that bore directly on their substantive\nmission-realities that were under their nose but not under their aegis.\nPauline Peters thus describes an effort in Malawi to depopulate a rural area\nof all but those whom the agricultural authorities had designated \"master\nfarmers.\" Extension agents were attempting to create a microlandscape of\n\"neatly-bounded, mixed-farming lot[s] based on rotation of single-stand crops\nwhich would replace the scattered, multi-cropped farming they considered\nbackward. In the meantime, they entirely ignored an autonomous and general\nrush to plant tobacco-the very transformation they were trying to bring about\nby force.\" 126\n\nThe planned city, the planned village, and the planned language (not to\nmention the command economy) are, we have emphasized, likely to be thin\ncities, villages, and languages. They are thin in the sense that they cannot\nreasonably plan for anything more than a few schematic aspects of the\ninexhaustibly complex activities that characterize \"thick\" cities and\nvillages. One all-but-guaranteed consequence of such thin planning is that the\nplanned institution generates an unofficial reality-a \"dark twin\"-that arises\nto perform many of the various needs that the planned institution fails to\nfulfill. Brasilia, as Holston showed, engendered an \"unplanned Brasilia\" of\nconstruction workers, migrants, and those whose housing and activities were\nnecessary but were not foreseen or were precluded by the plan. Nearly every\nnew, exemplary capital city has, as the inevitable accompaniment of its\nofficial structures, given rise to another, far more \"disorderly\" and complex\ncity that makes the official city work-that is virtually a condition of its\nexistence. That is, the dark twin is not just an anomaly, an \"outlaw reality\";\nit represents the activity and life without which the official city would\ncease to function. The outlaw city bears the same relation to the official\ncity as the Parisian taxi drivers' actual practices bear to the Code routier.\n\nOn a more speculative note, I imagine that the greater the pretense of and\ninsistence on an officially decreed micro-order, the greater the volume of\nnonconforming practices necessary to sustain that fiction. The most rigidly\nplanned economies tend to be accompanied by large \"underground, 'gray,'\ninformal,\" economies that supply, in a thousand ways, what the formal economy\nfails to supply\"' When this economy is ruthlessly suppressed, the cost has\noften been economic ruin and starvation (the Great Leap Forward and the\nCultural Revolution in China; the autarkic, moneyless economy of Pol Pot's\nCambodia). Efforts to force a country's inhabitants to maintain permanent,\nfixed residences tend to produce large, illegal, undocumented populations in\nurban areas where they have been forbidden to go. 121 The insistence on a\nrigid visual aesthetic at the core of the capital city tends to produce\nsettlements and slums teeming with squatters who, as often as not, sweep the\nfloors, cook the meals, and tend the children of the elites who work in the\ndecorous, planned center. 129\n\n\n# 8 Taming Nature:  \nAn Agriculture of Legibility  \nand Simplicity\n\n![](img0045.jpg)\n\nYes, enumerate the carriage partsStill not a carriage.\n\nWhen you begin making decisions and cutting it up rules and names appear And\nonce names appear, you should know when to stop.\n\n-Tao-to-ching\n\nThe necessarily simple abstractions of large bureaucratic institutions, as we\nhave seen, can never adequately represent the actual complexity of natural or\nsocial processes. The categories that they employ are too coarse, too static,\nand too stylized to do justice to the world that they purport to describe.\n\nFor reasons that will become apparent, state-sponsored highmodernist\nagriculture has recourse to abstractions of the same order. The simple\n\"production and profit\" model of agricultural extension and agricultural\nresearch has failed in important ways to represent the complex, supple,\nnegotiated objectives of real farmers and their communities. That model has\nalso failed to represent the space in which farmers plant crops-its\nmicroclimates, its moisture and water movement, its microrelief, and its local\nbiotic history. Unable to effectively represent the profusion and complexity\nof real farms and real fields, high-modernist agriculture has often succeeded\nin radically simplifying those farms and fields so they can be more directly\napprehended, controlled, and managed. I emphasize the radical simplification\nof agricultural high modernism because agriculture is, even in its most\nrudimentary, neolithic forms, inevitably a process of simplifying the floral\nprofusion of nature.' How else are we to understand the process by which man\nhas encouraged certain species of flora that he found useful and discouraged\nothers that he found a nuisance?\n\nThe logic behind the radical simplification of the field is almost precisely\nidentical to the logic behind the radical simplification of the forest. In\nfact, a simplified agriculture, which was developed earlier, served as the\nmodel for scientific forestry. The guiding idea was the maximization of the\ncrop yield or profit.2 The forests were reconceptualized as \"timber farms\" in\nwhich a single species of tree was planted in straight rows and harvested like\na crop when it was \"mature\" The preconditions of such simplifications were the\nexistence of a commodity market and competitive pressure, on states as well as\non entrepreneurs, to maximize profits or revenue. In the monocropped field and\nsingle-species forest alike, the innumerable other members of the biotic\ncommunity were ignored unless they had some direct bearing on the health and\nyield of the species to be harvested. Such narrowing of attention to a single\noutcome-invariably the one of most commercial or fiscal interest-confers an\nanalytical power that allows foresters and agronomists to track carefully the\ninfluence of other factors on this single dependent variable. Within its\nambit, there is no denying the extraordinary power of this approach to\nincrease yields. As we shall see, however, this potent but narrow perspective\nis troubled both by certain inevitable blind spots and by phenomena that lie\noutside its restricted field of vision. To continue the metaphor, this\nnarrowness in turn means that production agronomy is occasionally blindsided\nby factors outside its analytical focus and is forced, by the resulting\ncrisis, to take a broader perspective.\n\nThe question we shall address in this chapter is why a model of modern,\nscientific agriculture that has apparently been successful in the temperate,\nindustrializing West has so often foundered in the Third World. In spite of\nthese indifferent results, the model has been pressed by colonial modernizers,\nindependent states, and international agencies. In Africa, where the results\nhave been particularly sobering, an agronomist with great experience has\nclaimed that \"one of the crucial lessons of the past fifty years or so of\necological research focused on African agriculture is that the 'dramatic\nmodernization' option has a track record so poor that a return to slower and\nmore incremental approaches must now be given serious and sustained\nattention.\"3\n\nWe will not be much concerned in this discussion with the particular reasons\nthat made this scheme or that cropping plan fail. To be sure, the familiar\nbureaucratic pathologies as well as openly predatory practices have often\ngreatly compounded these failures. My claim, however, is that the origin of\nthese failures can be traced to a deeper level; these were, in other words,\nsystemic failures and would have occurred under the best assumptions about\nadministrative efficiency and probity.\n\nAt least four elements seem to be at work in these systemic failures. The\nfirst two are linked to the historical origin and institutional nexus of high-\nmodernist agriculture. First, given their discipline's origin in the\ntemperate, industrializing West, the bearers of modernism in agricultural\nplanning inherited a series of unexamined assumptions about cropping and field\npreparation that turned out to work badly in other contexts. Second, given the\npresumptions about expertise embodied in modernist agricultural planning, the\nactual schemes were continually bent to serve the power and status of\nofficials and of the state organs they controlled.4\n\nThe third element, however, operates at a deeper level: it is the systematic,\ncyclopean shortsightedness of high-modernist agriculture that courts certain\nforms of failure. Its rigorous attention to productionist goals casts into\nrelative obscurity all the outcomes lying outside the immediate relationship\nbetween farm inputs and yields. This means that both long-term outcomes (soil\nstructure, water quality, land-tenure relations) and third-party effects, or\nwhat welfare economists call \"externalities,\" receive little attention until\nthey begin to affect production.\n\nFinally, the very strength of scientific agricultural experimentationits\nsimplifying assumptions and its ability to isolate the impact of a single\nvariable on total production-is incapable of dealing adequately with certain\nforms of complexity. It tends to ignore, or discount, agricultural practices\nthat are not assimilable to its techniques.\n\nLest there be any misunderstanding about my purpose here, I want to emphasize\nthat this is not a general offensive against modern agronomic science, let\nalone an attack on the culture of scientific research. Modern agronomic\nscience, with its sophisticated plant breeding, plant pathology, analysis of\nplant nutrition, soil analysis, and technical virtuosity, is responsible for\ncreating a fund of technical knowledge that is by now being used in some form\nby even the most traditional cultivators. My purpose, rather, is to show how\nthe imperial pretensions of agronomic science-its inability to recognize or\nincorporate knowledge created outside its paradigm-sharply limited its utility\nto many cultivators. Whereas farmers, as we shall see, seem pragmatically\nalert to knowledge coming from any quarter should it serve their purposes,\nmodern agricultural planners are far less receptive to other ways of knowing.\n\n#### Varieties of Agricultural Simplification\n\n##### Early Agriculture\n\nCultivation is simplification. Even the most cursory forms of agriculture\ntypically produce a floral landscape that is less diverse than an unmanaged\nlandscape. The crops that mankind has cultivated have, when fully\ndomesticated, become dependent for their survival upon the management of\ncultivators-such activities as making a clearing, burning brush, breaking the\nsoil, weeding, pruning, manuring. Strictly speaking, a crop in the field is\nnot an artificial landscape, inasmuch as all fauna, not excluding human\nbeings, modify their environment in the course of food gathering. What is\ncertain, however, is that most of Homo sapiens's cultivars have been so\nadapted to their altered landscape that they have become \"'biological\nmonsters'\" which could not survive in the wild.'\n\nMillennia of variation and conscious human selection have favored cultivars\nthat are systematically different from their wild and weedy cousins., Our\nconvenience has led us to prefer plants that have large seeds and are easy to\ngerminate, have more blossoms and hence more fruit, and whose fruits are more\neasily threshed or shelled. Cultivated maize thus has a few large ears with\nlarge kernels whereas wild or semidomesticated maizes have very small cobs\nwith small kernels. The difference is most starkly captured by the contrast\nbetween the huge, seed-laden commercial sunflower and its diminutive woodland\nrelative.\n\nBeyond the question of the harvest itself, of course, cultivators have also\nselected for scores of other properties: texture, flavor, color, storage\nquality, aesthetic value, grinding and cooking qualities, and so on. The\nbreadth of human purposes has led not to a single, ideal cultivar of each\nspecies but rather to a great many varieties, each distinctive in some\nimportant way. Thus we have the varieties of barley grown for porridge, for\nbread, for beer, and for feeding livestock; and thus \"sweet sorghum for\nchewing, white-seeded types for bread, small, dark, redseeded types for beer,\nand strong-stemmed, fibrous types for houseconstruction and basketry.\"'\n\nThe greatest selection pressure, however, came from the dominant anxiety of\ncultivators: that they not starve. This most basic of existential concerns\nalso led to a great variety of cultivars, termed the \"landraces\" of the\nvarious crops. Landraces are genetically variable populations that respond\ndifferently to different soil conditions, levels of moisture, temperature,\nsunlight, diseases and pests, microclimates, and so forth. Over time,\ntraditional cultivators, operating as experienced applied botanists, have\ndeveloped literally thousands of landraces of a single species. A working\nknowledge of many, if not all, of these landraces provided cultivators with\nenormous flexibility in the face of environmental factors that they could not\ncontrol.'\n\nFor our purposes, the long development of so many landraces is significant in\nat least two respects. First, while early farmers were transforming and\nsimplifying their natural environment, they also had a surpassing interest in\nfostering a certain kind of diversity. A combination of their wide interests\nand their concern about the food supply impelled them to select and protect\nmany landraces. The genetic variability of the crops they grew provided some\nbuilt-in insurance against drought, flooding, plant diseases, pests, and the\nseasonal vagaries of climate.`' A pathogen might affect one landrace but not\nanother; some landraces would do well in a drought, others in wet conditions;\nsome would do well in clayey soil, others in sandy soil. Placing a large\nnumber of prudent bets, finely tuned to microlocal conditions, the cultivator\nmaximized the dependability of a tolerable harvest.\n\nThe variety of landraces is significant in another sense. All modern crops of\nany economic significance are the product of landraces. Until about 1930 all\nscientific crop breeding was essentially a process of selection from among the\nexisting landraces.10 Landraces and their wild progenitors and \"escapes\"\nrepresent the \"germ plasm\" or seed-stock capital upon which modern agriculture\nis based. In other words, as James Boyce has put it, modern varieties and\ntraditional agriculture are complements, not substitutes.\"\n\n##### Twentieth-Century Agriculture\n\nModern, industrial, scientific farming, which is characterized by\nmonocropping, mechanization, hybrids, the use of fertilizers and pesticides,\nand capital intensiveness, has brought about a level of standardization into\nagriculture that is without historical precedent. Far beyond mere monocropping\non the model of scientific forestry explored earlier, this simplification has\nentailed a genetic narrowing fraught with consequences that we are only\nbeginning to comprehend.\n\nOne of the basic sources of increasing uniformity in crops arises from the\nintense commercial pressures to maximize profits in a competitive mass market.\nThus the effort to increase planting densities in order to stretch the\nproductivity of land encouraged the adoption of varieties that would tolerate\ncrowding. Greater planting densities have, in turn, intensified the use of\ncommercial fertilizers and therefore the selection of subspecies known for\nhigh fertilizer (especially nitrogen) uptake and response. At the same time,\nthe growth of great supermarket chains, with their standardized routines of\nshipping, packaging, and display, has inexorably led to an emphasis on\nuniformity of size, shape, color, and \"eye appeal.\"\" The result of these\npressures was to concentrate on the small number of cultivars that met these\ncriteria while abandoning others.\n\nThe production of uniformity in the field is best grasped, however, through\nthe logic of mechanization. As factor prices in the West have, since at least\n1950, favored the substitution of farm machinery for hired labor, the farmer\nhas sought cultivars that were compatible with mechanization. That is, he\nselected crops whose architecture did not interfere with tractors or sprayers,\nwhich ripened uniformly, and which could be picked in a \"once-over\" pass of\nthe machine.\n\nGiven the techniques of hybridization being developed at roughly the same\ntime, it was but a short step to creating new crop varieties bred explicitly\nfor mechanization. \"Genetic variability,\" as Jack Ralph Kloppenberg notes, \"is\nthe enemy of mechanization.\"\" In the case of corn, hybridization-the progeny\nof two inbred lines-produces a field of the genetically identical individuals\nthat are ideal for mechanization. Varieties developed with machinery in mind\nwere available as early as 1920, when Henry Wallace joined forces with a\nmanufacturer of harvesting equipment to cultivate his new, stiff-stalked\nvariety with a strong shank connecting the ear to the stalk. An entire field\nof plant breeding, termed \"phytoengineering,\" was thus born in order to adapt\nthe natural world to machine processing. \"Machines are not made to harvest\ncrops,\" noted two proponents of phytoengi- neering. \"In reality, crops must be\ndesigned to be harvested by machine.\" 14 Having been adapted to the cultivated\nfield, the crop was now adapted to mechanization. The \"machine-friendly\" crop\nwas bred to incorporate a series of characteristics that made it easier to\nharvest it mechanically. Among the most important of these characteristics\nwere resilience, a concentrated fruit set, uniformity of plant size and\narchitecture, uniformity of fruit shape and size, dwarfing (in the case of\ntree crops especially), and fruits that easily break away from the plant.\"\n\nThe development of the \"supermarket tomato\" by G. C. (Jack) Hanna at the\nUniversity of California at Davis in the late 1940s and 1950s is an early and\ndiagnostic case.16 Spurred by the wartime shortage of field labor, researchers\nset about inventing a mechanical harvester and breeding the tomato that would\naccommodate it. The tomato plants eventually bred for the job were hybrids of\nlow stature and uniform maturity that produced similarly sized fruits with\nthick walls, firm flesh, and no cracks; the fruits were picked green in order\nto avoid being bruised by the grasp of the machinery and were artificially\nripened by ethylene gas during transport. The results were the small, uniform\nwinter tomatoes, sold four to a package, which dominated supermarket shelves\nfor several decades. Taste and nutritional quality were secondary to machine\ncompatibility. Or to put it more charitably, the breeders did what they could\nto develop the best tomato within the very sharp constraints of mechanization.\n\nThe imperatives of maximizing profits and hence, in this case, of mechanizing\nthe harvest worked powerfully to transform and simplify both the field and the\ncrop. Relatively inflexible, nonselective machines work best in flat fields\nwith identical plants growing uniform fruits of perfectly even maturity.\nAgronomic science was deployed to approximate this ideal: large, finely graded\nfields; uniform irrigation and nutrients to regulate growth; liberal use of\nherbicides, fungicides, and insecticides to maintain uniform health; and,\nabove all, plant breeding to create the ideal cultivar.\n\n##### The Unintended Consequences of Simplification\n\nReviewing the history of major crop epidemics, beginning with the Irish potato\nfamine in 1850, a committee of the United States National Research Council\nconcluded: \"These encounters show clearly that crop mono-culture and genetic\nuniformity invite epidemics. All that is needed is the arrival on the scene of\na parasite that can take advantage of the vulnerability. If the crop is\nuniformly vulnerable, so much the better for the parasite. In this way virus\ndiseases have devastated sugar beets with 'yellows,' peaches with yellows,\npotatoes with leaf roll and X and Y viruses, cocoa with swollen shoot, clover\nwith sudden death, sugarcane with mosaic, and rice with hoja blanca.\"7 After a\ncorn leaf blight had devastated much of the 1970 corn crop, the committee had\nbeen convened in order to consider the genetic vulnerability of all major\ncrops. One of the pioneer breeders of hybrid corn, Donald Jones, had foreseen\nthe problems that the loss of genetic diversity might bring: \"Genetically\nuniform pure line varieties are very productive and highly desirable when\nenvironmental conditions are favorable and the varieties are well-protected\nfrom pests of all kinds. When these external factors are not favorable, the\nresult can be disastrous ... due to some new virulent parasite.\"\"\n\nThe logic of epidemiology in crops is relatively straightforward in principle.\nAll plants have some resistance to pathogens; otherwise they and the pathogen\n(if it preyed upon only that plant) would disappear. At the same time, all\nplants are genetically vulnerable to certain pathogens. If a field is\npopulated exclusively by genetically identical individuals, such as single-\ncross hybrids or clones, then each plant is vulnerable in exactly the same way\nto the same pathogen, be it a virus, fungus, bacterium, or nematode.'`' Such a\nfield is an ideal genetic habitat for the proliferation of precisely those\nstrains or mutants of path ogens that thrive and feed on this particular\ncultivar. The uniform habitat, especially one in which plants are crowded,\nexerts a naturalselection pressure, as it were, that favors such pathogens.\nGiven the right seasonal conditions for the pathogen to multiply (temperature,\nhumidity, wind, and so on), the classic conditions for the geometric\nprogression of an epidemic are in place.20\n\nIn contrast, diversity is the enemy of epidemics. In a field with many species\nof plants, only a few individuals are likely to be susceptible to a given\npathogen, and they are likely to be widely scattered. The mathematical logic\nof the epidemic is broken.21 A monocropped field, as the National Research\nCouncil report noted, increases vulnerability appreciably inasmuch as all\nmembers of the same plant species share much of their genetic inheritance. But\nwhere a field is populated by many genetically diverse landraces of a given\nspecies, the risk is vastly reduced. Any agricultural practice that increases\ndiversity over time and space, such as crop rotation or mixed cropping on a\nfarm or in a region, acts as a barrier to the spread of epidemics.\n\nThe modern regime of pesticide use, which has arisen over the past fifty\nyears, must be seen as an integral feature of this genetic vulnerability, not\nas an unrelated scientific breakthrough. It is precisely because hybrids are\nso uniform and hence disease prone that quasiheroic measures have to be taken\nto control the environment in which they are grown. Such hybrids are analogous\nto a human patient with a compromised immune system who must be kept in a\nsterile field lest an opportunistic infection take hold. The sterile field, in\nthis case, has been established by the blanket use of pesticides.22\n\nCorn, as the most widely planted crop in the United States (85 million acres\nin 1986)23 and the first one to be hybridized, has provided nearly ideal\nconditions for insect, disease, and weed buildup. Pesticide use is\ncorrespondingly high. Corn accounts for one-third of the total market for\nherbicides and one-quarter of the market for insecticides .14 One of the long-\nterm effects, which is readily predictable according to the theory of natural\nselection, has been the emergence of resistant strains among insects, fungi,\nand weeds, necessitating either larger doses or a new set of chemical agents.\nSome pathogens, again predictably, have developed what is termed \"cross-\nresistance\" to a whole class of pesticides.25 As more generations of the\npathogen are exposed to the pesticide, the likelihood that resistant strains\nwill emerge is correspondingly greater. Above and beyond the troubling\nconsequences of pesticide use for the organic matter in the soil, groundwater\nquality, human health, and the ecosystem, pesticides have exacerbated some\nexisting crop diseases while creating new ones.26\n\nJust prior to the corn leaf blight in the South in 1970, 71 percent of all\nacreage in corn was planted to only six hybrids. The specialists investigating\nthe blight stressed the pressures of mechanization and product uniformity that\nled to a radically narrower genetic crop base. \"Uniformity,\" the report\nasserted, \"is the key word.\"27 Most of the hybrids had been developed by the\nmale-sterile method using \"Texas cytoplasm.\" It was this uniformity that was\nattacked by the fungus Helmin- thosporium maydis; those hybrids created\nwithout Texas cytoplasm suffered only trivial damage. The pathogen was not\nnew; in its report, the National Research Council committee imagined that it\nwas probably in existence when Squanto showed the Pilgrims how to plant corn.\nWhile H. maydis may have from time to time produced more virulent strains,\n\"American corn was too variable to give the new strain a very good\nfoothold.\"28 What was new was the vulnerability of the host.\n\nThe report went on to document the fact that \"most major crops are\nimpressively uniform genetically and impressively vulnerable [to epi-\ndemics].\"29 Exotic germ plasm from a rare Mexican landrace proved to be the\nsolution to breeding new hybrids that were less susceptible to the blight. In\nthis and many other cases, it was only the genetic diversity created by a long\nhistory of landrace development by nonspecialists that provided a way out.30\nLike the formal order of the planned section of Brasilia or collectivized\nagriculture, modern, simplified, and standardized agriculture depends for its\nexistence on a \"dark twin\" of informal practices and experience on which it\nis, ultimately, parasitic.\n\n#### The Catechism of High-Modernist Agriculture\n\nThe model and promise of American agricultural modernism was absolutely\nhegemonic in the three decades from 1945 to 1975. It was the prevailing\n\"export model.\" Hundreds of irrigation and dam projects modeled roughly on the\nTennessee Valley Authority (TvA) were begun; many large and highly capitalized\nagricultural schemes were inaugurated with great fanfare; and thousands of\nadvisers were dispatched. There was a continuity in personnel as well as in\nideas. Economists, engineers, agronomists, and planners who had served in the\nTvA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the Department of the Treasury\nmoved to the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization, or USAID,\nbringing their experience and ideas with them. A combination of American\npolitical, economic, and military hegemony, the promise of loans and\nassistance, concerns about world population and food supply, and the great\nproductivity of American agriculture made for a degree of self-confidence in\nthe American model that is hard to overestimate.\n\nA few skeptics like Rachel Carson were beginning to question the model, but\nthey were greatly outnumbered by a chorus of visionaries who saw an unlimited\nand brilliant future ahead. Typical of the optimism was an article by James B.\nBillard entitled \"More Food for Our Multiplying Millions: The Revolution in\nAmerican Agriculture,\" which appeared in a 1970 issue of National\nGeographic.31 Its vision of the farm of the future, reproduced here in figure\n34, was not an idle fantasy; it was, we are told, drawn \"with the guidance of\nU.S. Department of Agriculture specialists.\" Billard's text is one long paean\nto mechanization, scientific marvels, and huge scale. For all the technical\nwizardry, he envisions a process of simplification of the landscape and\ncentralization of command. Fields will be larger, with fewer trees, hedges,\nand roads; plots may be \"several miles long and a hundred yards wide\";\n\"weather control\" will prevent hailstorms and tornadoes; atomic energy will\n\"level hills\" and make irrigation water from seawater; satellites, sensors,\nand airplanes will spot plant epidemics while the farmer sits in his control\ntower.\n\nAt the operational level, the credo of American agriculture for export\nincorporated the same fundamental convictions. Both the exporters and the vast\nmajority of their eager clients were committed to the following truths: the\nsuperior technical efficiency of large-scale farms, the importance of\nmechanization to save labor and break technical bottlenecks, the superiority\nof monocropping and hybrids over polycropping and landraces, and the\nadvantages of high-input agriculture, including commercial fertilizers and\npesticides. Above all, they believed in large, integrated, planned projects\nrather than piecemeal improvements, partly because the large, capital-\nintensive schemes could be planned as nearly pure technical exercises, rather\nlike the design of the Soviet collective farm that was invented in a Chicago\nhotel room. The greater the industrial content of a scheme and the more its\nenvironment could be made uniform (through controlled irrigation and\nnutrients, the use of tractors and combines, the development of flat fields),\nthe less was left to chance.32 Local soils, local landscape, local labor,\nlocal implements, and local weather appeared to be almost irrelevant to the\nprepackaged projects. At the same time, schemes conceived along these lines\nemphasized the technical expertise of the planners, the possibility of central\ncontrol, and, not least, a \"module\" that could be redeployed to almost any\nlocale. For local elites anxious to have a modern show project over which they\ncould preside, the advantages were also obvious.\n\nThe lamentable fate of the vast majority of these projects, whether private or\npublic, is by now a matter of record.33 They failed in most cases despite\nlavish credit subsidies and strong administrative backing. While each failure\nhad its own peculiarities, the level of abstraction at which most projects\nwere conceived was fatal. Imported faith and abstraction prevailed, as we\nshall see, over close attention to the local context.\n\n![](img0046.jpg)\n\n![](page0329_0000.svg)\n\n![](page0329_0001.svg)\n\n#### Modernist Faith Versus Local Practices\n\nWe can explore the contrast between imported faith and local context by\njuxtaposing several tenets of the catechism of high-modernist agriculture with\nthe local practices that appeared to violate them. And as we shall see,\ncontrary to contemporary expectations, these practices turned out to be\nscientifically sound and in some cases superior to the program of farming\nbeing urged or imposed by the agricultural reformers.\n\n##### Monoculture and Polyculture\n\nNothing better illustrates the myopic credo of high-modernist agriculture,\noriginating in temperate zones and brought to the tropics, than its nearly\nunshakable faith in the superiority of monoculture over the practice of\npolyculture found in much of the Third World.\n\nTo take West African indigenous farming systems as an example, colonial\nagricultural specialists encountered what seemed to them to be an\nastonishingly diverse regime of polycropping, with as many as four crops (not\nto mention subspecies) in the same field simultaneously.34 A fairly\nrepresentative instance of what met their eyes is depicted in figure 35. The\nvisual effect, to Western eyes, was one of sloppiness and disorder. Given\ntheir visual codification of modern agricultural practice, most specialists\nknew, without further empirical investigation, that the apparent disorder of\nthe crops was a symptom of backward techniques; it failed the visual test of\nscientific agriculture. Campaigns to replace polyculture with pure-stand\nplanting were pushed with equal fervor by colonial officials and, after\nindependence, by their local successors.\n\nWe have gradually come to understand a quite specific logic of place-in\nparticular, tropical soils, climate, and ecology-that helps to explain the\nfunctions of polyculture. The diversity of species naturally occurring in a\ntropical setting is, other things being equal, consistently greater than the\ndiversity of species in a temperate setting. An acre of tropical forest will\nhave far more species of plants, although fewer individuals of each species,\nthan will an acre of temperate woodland. Thus unmanaged nature in temperate\nclimates looks more or derly because it is less diverse, and this may play a\nrole in the visual culture of Westerners.35 In favoring polyculture, the\ntropical cultivator also imitates nature in his techniques of cultivation.\nPolyculture, like the tropical forest itself, plays an important role in\nprotecting thin soils from the erosive effects of wind, rain, and sunlight.\nFurthermore, the seasonality of tropical agriculture is governed more by the\ntiming of rains than by temperature. For this reason, a variety of\npolycropping strategies allows farmers to hedge their bets about the rains,\nholding the soil with drought-resistant crops and interspersing among them\ncrops that can take best advantage of the rains. Finally, the creation of a\nuniform, controlled farming environment is intrinsically more difficult in a\ntropical setting than in a temperate one, and, where popula tion densities are\nlow, the labor requirements of extensive terracing or irrigation are\nuneconomic in the strict neoclassical sense of the word.\n\n![](img0047.jpg)\n\n35\\. Construction of stick bunds across incipient gullies in a Sierra Leone\nrice field\n\nHere one may recall Jane Jacobs's important distinction between visual\norderliness on one hand and functional working order on the other. The city\ndesk of a newspaper, a rabbit's intestines, or the interior of an aircraft\nengine may certainly look messy, but each one reflects, sometimes brilliantly,\nan order related to the function it performs. In such instances the apparent\nsurface disarray obscures a more profound logic. Polyculture was a floral\nvariant of such order. Only a very few colonial specialists managed to peer\nbehind the visual confusion to its logic. One of them was Howard Jones, a\nmycologist in Nigeria, who wrote in 1936:\n\n[To the European] the whole scheme seems ... laughable and ridiculous, and in\nthe end he would probably conclude that it is merely foolish to crowd\ndifferent plants together in this childish way so that they may choke one\nanother. Yet if one looks at it more closely there seems a reason for\neverything. The plants are not growing at random, but have been planted at\nproper distances on hillocks of soil arranged in such a way that when rain\nfalls it does not waterlog the plants, nor does it pour off the surface and\nwash away the fine soil.... The soil is always occupied and is neither dried\nup by the sun nor leached out by the rain, as it would be if it were left\nbare.... This is but one of many examples that might be given that should warn\nus to be very cautious and thorough before we pass judgement upon native\nagriculture. The whole method of farming and outlook of the farmer are so\nentirely new to us that we are strongly tempted to call it foolish from an\ninstinctive conservatism.',,\n\nElsewhere in the tropical world, a few astute observers were uncovering a\ndifferent agricultural logic. A striking example of visual order versus\nworking order was provided by Edgar Anderson, on the basis of his botanical\nwork in rural Guatemala. He realized that what appeared to be overgrown,\n\"riotous\" dump heaps that no Westerner would have taken for gardens exhibited,\non closer inspection, an exceptionally efficient and well-thought-out order.\nAnderson sketched one of these gardens (figures 36 and 37), and his\ndescription of the logic he discerned in it is worth quoting at length.\n\nThough at first sight there seems little order, as soon as we started mapping\nthe garden, we realized that it was planted in fairly definite crosswise rows.\nThere were fruit trees, native and European in great variety: annonas,\ncherimoyas, avocados, peaches, quinces, plums, a fig, and a few coffeebushes.\nThere were giant cacti grown for their fruit. There was a large plant of\nrosemary, a plant of rue, some poinsettias, and a fine semiclimbing tea rose.\nThere was a whole row of the native domesticated hawthorn, whose fruits like\nyellow, doll-size apples, make a de licious conserve. There were two varieties\nof corn, one well past bearing and now serving as a trellis for climbing\nstring beans which were just coming into season, the other, a much taller\nsort, which was tasseling out. There were specimens of a little banana with\nsmooth wide leaves which are the local substitute for wrapping paper, and are\nalso used instead of cornhusks in cooking the native variant of hot tamales.\nOver it all clambered the luxuriant vines of the various cucurbits. Chayote,\nwhen finally mature, has a large nutritious root weighing several pounds. At\none point there was a depression the size of a small bathtub where a chayote\nroot had recently been excavated; this served as a dump heap and compost for\nthe waste from the house. At one end of the garden was a small beehive made\nfrom boxes and tin cans. In terms of our American and European equivalents,\nthe garden was a vegetable garden, an orchard, a medicinal garden, a dump\nheap, a compost heap, and a beeyard. There was no problem of erosion though it\nwas at the top of a steep slope; the soil surface was practically all covered\nand apparently would be during most of the year. Humidity would be kept during\nthe dry season and plants of the same sort were so isolated from one another\nby intervening vegetation that pests and diseases could not readily spread\nfrom plant to plant. The fertility was being conserved; in addi tion to the\nwaste from the house, mature plants were being buried in between the rows when\ntheir usefulness was over.\n\n![](img0048.jpg)\n\n36\\. Edgar Anderson's drawing of an orchard garden in Santa Lucia, Guatemala\n\nIt is frequently said by Europeans and European Americans that time means\nnothing to an Indian. This garden seemed to me to be a good example of how the\nIndian, when we look more than superficially into his activities, is budgeting\nhis time more efficiently than we do. The garden was in continuous production\nbut was taking only a little effort at any one time: a few weeds pulled when\none came down to pick the squashes, corn and bean plants dug in between the\nrows when the last of the climbing beans were picked, and a new crop of\nsomething else planted above them a few weeks later.\"\n\n![](img0049.jpg)\n\n37\\. In his drawing of an orchard garden in Santa Lucia, Anderson used glyphs\nthat identify not only the plants but also their general categories. Circular\nglyphs indicate fruit trees of European origin (plum, peach); rounded,\nirregular glyphs indicate fruit trees of American origin (manzanilla). Dotted\nlines stand for climbing vegetables, small circles for subshrubs, large stars\nfor succulents, and wedge-shaped figures for plants in the banana family. The\nnarrow mass seen at the right side of figure 36 represents a hedge of\nchichicaste, a shrub used by the Mayas.\n\nLike the micrologic of the Guatemalan garden, the logic of West African\npolycropping systems, long dismissed as being primitive, has finally been\nrecognized. In fact, they came under investigation partly as a reaction\nagainst the many monocropping schemes that miscarried. The advantages were\noften evident even at the level of narrow productivist outcomes; and once\nother goals such as sustainability, conservation, and food security were\nconsidered, their advantages seemed especially striking.\n\nVarious forms of polyculture are the norm in 80 percent of West Africa's\nfarmland.38 Given what we now know, this should occasion little surprise.\nIntercropping systems are best adapted to soils of low fertility, which\ncharacterize much of West Africa. Their use produces greater gains in yield on\nsuch soils than on soils of high fertility.39 One reason seems to be that\noptimal planting densities are greater in intercropping than in monocropping,\nand the resulting crowding appears, for reasons that are poorly understood but\nmay have to do with root fungi interactions, to improve the performance of\neach cultivar. Crowding at the later stage of cropping also helps to suppress\nweeds, which are otherwise a major constraint in tropical farming. Since the\nmixture of cultivars usually combines grains and legumes (maize and sorghum,\nfor example, with cowpeas and groundnuts), each crop has complementary\nnutritional needs and rooting systems that extract nutrients from different\nlevels in the soil.40 In the case of relay cropping, it appears that the\nresidues of the first crop gathered benefit the remaining crop. The diversity\nof cultivars on the same field also has a beneficial effect on the health of\nthe crops and hence on yields. Mixed crops and the scattering of particular\ncultivars limit the habitat of various pests, diseases, and weeds that\notherwise might build up to devastating proportions, as they do on monocropped\nplots.41 In fact, two specialists who were very much out of step with the\nagronomic establishment of the 1930s and 1940s went so far as to suggest that\n\"the systematic study of mixed cropping and other native practices might lead\nto comparatively minor modifications in Yoruba and other forms of agriculture,\nwhich might in the aggregate do more to increase crop production and soil\nfertility than revolutionary changes to green manuring or mixed farming.\"42\n\nThe multistoried effect of polyculture has some distinct advantages for yields\nand soil conservation. \"Upper-story\" crops shade \"lowerstory\" crops, which are\nselected for their ability to thrive in the cooler soil temperature and\nincreased humidity at ground level. Rainfall reaches the ground not directly\nbut as a fine spray that is absorbed with less damage to soil structure and\nless erosion. The taller crops often serve as a useful windbreak for the lower\ncrops. Finally, in mixed or relay cropping, a crop is in the field at all\ntimes, holding the soil together and reducing the leaching effects that sun,\nwind, and rain exert, particularly on fragile land. Even if polyculture is not\nto be preferred on the grounds of immediate yield, there is much to recommend\nit in terms of sustainability and thus long-term production.\n\nOur discussion of mixed cropping has thus far dealt only with the narrow\nissues of yield and soil conservation. It has overlooked the cultivators\nthemselves and the various other ends that they seek by using such techniques.\nThe most significant advantage of intercropping, Paul Richards claims, is its\ngreat flexibility, \"the scope [it] offers for a range of combinations to match\nindividual needs and preferences, local conditions, and changing circumstances\nwithin each season and from season to season.\"43 Farmers may polycrop in order\nto avoid labor bottlenecks at planting and at harvest.44 Growing many\ndifferent crops is also an obvious way to spread risks and improve food\nsecurity. Cultivators can reduce the danger of going hungry if they sow,\ninstead of only one or two cultivars, crops of long and short maturity, crops\nthat are drought resistant and those that do well under wetter conditions,\ncrops with different patterns of resistance to pests and diseases, crops that\ncan be stored in the ground with little loss (such as cassava), and crops that\nmature in the \"hungry time\" before other crops are gath- ered.4S Finally, and\nperhaps most important, each of these crops is embedded in a distinctive set\nof social relations. Different members of the household are likely to have\ndifferent rights and responsibilities with respect to each crop. The planting\nregimen, in other words, is a reflection of social relations, ritual needs,\nand culinary tastes; it is not just a production strategy that a profit-\nmaximizing entrepreneur took straight out of the pages of a text in\nneoclassical economics.\n\nThe high-modernist aesthetic and ideology of most colonial agronomists and\ntheir Western-trained successors foreclosed a dispassionate examination of\nlocal cultivation practices, which were regarded as deplorable customs for\nwhich modern, scientific farming was the corrective. A critique of such\nhegemonic ideas comes, if it comes at all, not from within, but typically from\nthe margins, where the intellectual point of departure and operating\nassumptions, as was the case with Jacobs, are substantially different. Thus\nthe case for the rationality of mixed cropping has largely come from rogue\nfigures outside the establishment.\n\nPerhaps the most striking of these figures was Albert Howard (later Sir\nAlbert), an agricultural researcher who worked under local patronage for more\nthan three decades in India. He was known chiefly for the Indore process, a\nscientific procedure of making humus from organic wastes, and unlike most\nWestern agronomists, he was an avid observer of forest ecology and indigenous\npractices. Concerned above all with soil fertility and sustainable\nagriculture, Howard observed that the natural diversity of the forest and\nlocal polycropping practices were both successful means of maintaining or\nincreasing soil health and fertility. Soil fertility was a matter of not\nsimply chemical composition but also structural properties: the soil's tilth\n(or crumb structure), its degree of aeration, its moisture-holding power, and\nthe \"fungus bridge\" (the mycorrhizal association) necessary to humus\ncreation.46 Some but not all elements in this complex soil interaction could\nbe precisely measured, while others could be recognized by a practiced\nobserver but not readily measured. Howard undertook elaborate experiments in\nhumus production, soil structure, and plant response and was able to show\nfieldtrial yield results superior to those achieved by standard Western\npractices. His main concern, however, was not with how many bushels of wheat\nor maize could be gotten from an acre as with the health and quality of the\ncrops and soil over the long haul.\n\nThe case for polyculture has worked its way back to the West, although it\nremains one voiced by only a tiny minority. Rachel Carson, in her\nrevolutionary book Silent Spring, published in 1962, traced the destructive\nuse of massive doses of pesticides and herbicides to monocropping itself. The\nproblem with insects, she explained, resulted from the \"devotion of immense\nacreage to a single crop. Such a system set the stage for explosive increases\nin specific insect populations. Single crop farming does not take advantage of\nthe principles by which nature works, it is agriculture as an engineer might\nconceive it to be. Nature has introduced great variety into the landscape, but\nman has displayed passion for simplifying it.... One important check is a\nlimit on the amount of suitable habitat for each species.\"47 Just as Howard\nbelieved that monoculture had contributed to the loss of soil fertility and\nits corrective, the growing use of chemical fertilizers (260 pounds per acre\nin the United States in 1970), so Carson argued that monoculture spawned the\nexploding population of pests and its corrective, the massive application of\ninsecticides-a cure that turned out to be worse than the disease.\n\nFor these and other reasons, there are at least faint indications that some\nforms of polycropping might be suitable for Western farmers as well as\nAfricans.41 This is not the place to attempt to demonstrate the superiority of\npolyculture over monoculture, nor am I qualified to do so. There is no single,\ncontext-free answer to this issue, for answers would depend on any number of\nvariables, including the goals sought, the crops sown, and the microsettings\nin which they were planted. What I have tried to demonstrate, however, is that\npolyculture, even on the narrow production-oriented grounds favored by Western\nagronomy, merited empirical examination as one among many agricultural\nstrategies. That it was instead dismissed summarily by all but a handful of\nrogue agronomists is a tribute to the power both of imperialist ideology and\nof the visual aesthetic of agricultural high modernism.\n\nThe case of polyculture also raises an issue relevant to both agricultural\npractice and social structure, an issue that we will ponder at greater length\nin the remainder of this book: the resilience and durability of diversity.\nWhatever its other virtues or demerits, polyculture is a more stable, more\neasily sustainable form of agriculture than monocropping. It is more likely to\nproduce what economists call Hicksian income: income that does not undermine\nfactor endowments, which will permit that income flow to continue indefinitely\ninto the future. Polyculture is, at the same time, more supple and adaptable.\nThat is, it is more easily able to absorb stress and damage without being\ndevastated. Elegant research has recently shown that, at least up to a point,\nthe more cultivars that a given plot has, the more productive and resilient it\nis.49 Polyculture, as we have seen, is more resistant to the insults of\nweather and pests, not to mention more generous in the improvements it effects\nin the soil. Even if monoculture could be shown to always give superior yields\nin the short run, polyculture might still be considered to have decisive long-\nterm advantages.50 The evidence from forestry has some application to\nagriculture as well: monocropped forests like those in Germany and Japan have\nled to ecological problems so severe that restoration ecology has been called\nto the rescue in order to reestablish something approaching the earlier\ndiversity (in insects, flora, and fauna) necessary to the health of the\nforests'\n\nHere it is worth noting the strong parallel between the case for diversity in\ncultivation and forestry and the case that Jacobs made for diversity in urban\nneighborhoods. The more complex the neighborhood, she reasoned, the better it\nwill resist short-term shocks in business conditions and market prices.\nDiversity, by the same token, provides many potential growth points which can\nbenefit from new opportunities. A highly specialized neighborhood, by\ncontrast, is like a gambler placing all his bets on one turn of the roulette\nwheel. If he wins, he wins big; if he loses, he may lose everything. For\nJacobs, of course, a key point about the diversity of a neighborhood is the\nhuman ecology it fosters. The variety of locally available goods and services\nand the complex human networks that it makes possible, the foot traffic that\npromotes safety, the visual interest that an animated and convenient\nneighborhood provides-all interact to make such a location's advantages cu-\nmulative.52 The diversity and complexity that cause systems of flora to become\nmore durable and resilient work, at another level apparently, to cause human\ncommunities to become more nimble and satisfactory.\n\n##### Permanent Fields Versus Shifting Cultivation\n\nMost West African farmers practiced some form of shifting cultivation.\"\nVariously called slash-and-burn cultivation, swiddening, and rotational bush\nfallow, shifting cultivation involves the temporary cultivation of a field\ncleared by cutting and burning most of the vegetation. After being worked for\na few years, the field is abandoned for a new plot. Eventually, when new\ngrowth has restored the original field to something like its original\nfertility, it is cultivated again. Polycropping and minimum tillage were often\ncombined with shifting cultivation.\n\nLike polycropping, shifting cultivation, as we shall see, turns out to be a\nrational, efficient, and sustainable technique under the soil, climate, and\nsocial conditions where it is generally practiced. Polycropping and shifting\ncultivation are almost invariably associated. Harold Conklin's early,\ndetailed, and still unsurpassed account of shifting cultivation in the\nPhilippines noted that, for a newly cleared plot, the average number of\ncultivars in a single season was between forty and sixty.54 At the same time,\nshifting cultivation is an exceptionally complex and hence quite illegible\nform of agriculture from the perspective of a sovereign state and its\nextension agents. The fields themselves are \"fugitive;' going in and out of\ncultivation at irregular intervals-hardly promising material for a cadastral\nmap. The cultivators themselves, of course, are often fugitive as well, moving\nperiodically to be near their new clearings. Registering or monitoring such\npopulations, let alone turning them into easily assessable taxpayers, is a\nSisyphean task.55 The project of the state and the agricultural authorities,\nas we saw in the Tanzanian case, was to replace this illegible and potentially\nseditious space with permanent settlements and permanent (preferably\nmonocropped) fields.\n\nShifting cultivation also gave offense to agricultural modernizers of whatever\nrace, because it violated in almost every respect their understanding of what\nmodern agriculture had to look like. \"Early attitudes to shifting cultivation\nwere almost entirely negative,\" Richards notes. \"It was a bad system:\nexploitative, untidy, and misguided.'16 The finely adapted logic of shifting\ncultivation depended on disturbing the landscape and ecology as little as\npossible and mimicking, where it could, many of the symbiotic associations of\nlocal plants. This meant that such fields looked far more like unimproved\nnature than the neatly manicured, rectilinear fields that most agricultural\nofficers were used to. The ecological caution of shifting cultivation, in\nother words, was the reason behind the appearances that so offended\ndevelopment officials.\n\nRotational bush fallow had a good many other advantages that were rarely\nappreciated. It upheld the physical properties of upland and hill soils which,\nonce destroyed, were difficult to restore. The rotation itself, where land was\nabundant, ensured the long-run stability of the practice. Shifting cultivators\nrarely removed large trees or stumps-a custom that limited erosion and helped\nthe soil structure but that struck agricultural officials as sloppy and\nunsightly. With some exceptions, swidden plots were cultivated by hoe or\ndibble stick rather than plowed. To Westernized agronomists, it appeared that\nthe farmers were merely \"scratching the surface\" of their soils out of a\ndeplorable ignorance or sloth. Where they encountered farming systems\ninvolving deep plowing and monocropping, they believed they had encountered a\nmore advanced and industrious population.57 The burning of the brush\naccumulated in clearing a new swidden was also condemned as wasteful. After a\ntime, however, both shallow cultivation and burning were found to be highly\nbeneficial; the former preserved the soil, especially in areas of high\nrainfall, while the latter reduced pest populations and provided valuable\nnutrients to the crop. Experiments showed, in fact, that burning the brush in\nthe field (rather than hauling it off) contributed to better yields, as did a\ncarefully timed burn.5\"\n\nTo someone trained to a Western perspective, the total effect of such\ncultivation practices had \"backwardness\" written all over it-heaps of brush\nwaiting to be burned on unplowed, half-cleared fields littered with stumps and\nplanted with several interspersed crops, none of them sown in straight rows.\nAnd yet, as the hard evidence accumulated, it was clear that appearances were\ndeceiving, even in productionist terms. As Richards concludes, \"The proper\ntest for any practice was whether it worked in the environment concerned, not\nwhether it looked 'advanced' or 'backward.' Testing requires carefully\ncontrolled input-output trials. If 'shallow' cultivation on 'partially\ncleared' land gives better returns relative to the inputs expended than rival\nsystems, and these results can be sustained over time, then the technique is a\ngood one, irrespective of whether it was invented yesterday or a thousand\nyears ago \"51 Lost in the early blanket condemnations of shifting cultivation\nwas the realization that the practice was deployed in a highly discriminating\nway by African cultivators. Most farmers combined permanent bottomland\ncultivation of some kind with swidden cultivation of the more fragile\nhillsides, uplands, or forests. Rather than not knowing any better, as was\noften assumed, most shifting cultivators were familiar with a range of\ncropping techniques among which they selected with care.\n\n##### Fertilizer Versus Fertility\n\nThe best fertilizer on any farm is the footsteps of the owner.\n\n-Confucius\n\nCommercial fertilizers have often been touted as magical inoculations for\nimproving poor soils and raising yields; extension agents have routinely\nreferred to fertilizers and pesticides as medicine for the soil. The actual\nresults have often been disappointing. Two major reasons for the\ndisappointment are directly relevant to our larger argument.\n\nFirst, recommendations for fertilizer applications are inevitably gross\nsimplifications. Their applicability to any particular field is questionable,\nsince a map of soil classes is likely to overlook an enormous degree of\nmicrovariation between and within fields. The conditions under which\nfertilizers are applied, the \"dosage,\" the soil structure, the crops for which\nthey are intended, and the weather immediately prior and subsequent to their\napplication can all greatly influence their uptake and effect. As Richards\nobserves, the unavoidable variation by farm and field \"requires a more open-\nended approach, with, in all probability, farmers doing much of the necessary\nexperimentation for themselves.\"60\n\nSecond, fertilizer formulas suffer from an analytical narrowness. The formulas\nthemselves derive from the work of a remarkable German scientist, Justus\nFreiherr von Liebig, who, in a classic manuscript published in 1840,\nidentified the main chemical nutrients present in the soil and to whom we\nstill owe the current standard fertilizer recipe (N, P, K). It was a brilliant\nscientific advance, with far-reaching and usually beneficial results. Where it\ntended to get into trouble, however, was when it posed as \"imperial\"\nknowledge-when it was touted as the way in which all soil deficiencies could\nbe remedied .61 As Howard and others have painstakingly shown, there are a\nrange of intervening variables-including the physical structure of the soil,\naeration, tilth, humus, and the fungus bridge-that greatly influence plant\nnutrition and soil fertility.62 Chemical fertilizers can in fact so thoroughly\noxidize beneficial organic matter as to destroy its crumb structure and\ncontribute to a progressive alkalization and a loss of fertility.63\n\nThe details are less important than the larger point: an effective soil\nscience must not stop at chemical nutrients; it must encompass elements of\nphysics, bacteriology, entomology, and geology, and that is at a minimum.\nIdeally, then, a practical approach to fertilizers requires, simultaneously, a\ngeneral, interdisciplinary knowledge, which a single specialist is unlikely to\nhave, and attention to the particularity of a given field, which only the\nfarmer is likely to have. A procedure that blends a purely chemical nutrient\nperspective with soil classification grids and that leaves the particular\nfield far behind is a recipe for ineffectiveness or even disaster.\n\n##### A History of \"Unauthorized\" Innovation\n\nFor most colonial officials and their successors, high-modernist commitments\nled them to form inaccurate assumptions about indigenous agriculture and\nblinded them to its dynamism. Far from being timeless, static, and rigid,\nindigenous agricultural practices were constantly being revised and adapted.\nSome of this plasticity was part of a broad repertoire of techniques that\ncould be adjusted, for example, to different patterns of rainfall, soils,\npitches of land, market opportunities, and labor supplies. Most African\ncultivators were typically utilizing more than one cultivation technique\nduring a season and knew many more that might come in handy. When entirely\nnovel cultivars from the New World became available, they were adopted with\nalacrity where appropriate. Thus maize, cassava, potatoes, chiles, and a\nvariety of New World pulses and gourds were incorporated into many African\nplanting regimens.64\n\nThe history of \"on-farm\" experimentation, selection, and adaptation was, of\ncourse, a very old story indeed, both in Africa and elsewhere. Ethnobotany and\npaleobotany have been able to trace in some historical detail how hybrids and\nvariants of, for example, the main Old World grains or New World maize were\nselected and propagated for a host of different uses and growing conditions.\nThe same observation holds true for those plants that are vegetatively\npropagated-that is, propagated by cuttings rather than by seeds.65\n\nOn a strictly dispassionate view, more specialists would have concluded that\nthere were many grounds for considering every African farm as something of a\nsmall-scale experimental station. It stands to reason that any community of\ncultivators who must wrest their living from a stingy and variable environment\nwill rarely overlook the opportunity to improve their security and food\nsupply. The limits to local knowledge must also be emphasized. Indigenous\ncultivators knew their own environment and its possibilities remarkably well.\nBut they of course lacked the knowledge that such tools of modern science as\nthe microscope, aerial photography, and scientific plant breeding could\nprovide. They often lacked, as did many cultivators elsewhere, the technology\nor the access to technology that make, say, large-scale irrigation schemes and\nhighly mechanized agriculture possible. Like peasants in the Mediterranean\nBasin, China, and India, they were capable of damaging their ecosystem, even\nif low population densities had thus far spared them from making this\nmistake.66 But if most agricultural specialists had appreciated how much the\nindigenous farmer did know, had appreciated her practical, experimental temper\nand willingness to adopt new crops and techniques when they met local needs,\nsuch specialists would have concluded, with Robert Chambers, that \"indigenous\nagricultural knowledge, despite being ignored or overridden by consultant\nexperts, is the single largest knowledge resource not yet mobilized in the\ndevelopment enterprise.\"67\n\n#### The Institutional Affinities of High-Modernist Agriculture\n\nThe willful disdain for local competence shown by most agricultural\nspecialists was not, I believe, simply a case of prejudice (of the educated,\nurban, and Westernized elite toward the peasantry) or of the aesthetic\ncommitments implicit in high modernism. Rather, official attitudes were also a\nmatter of institutional privilege. To the degree that the cultivators'\npractices were presumed reasonable until proven otherwise, to the degree that\nspecialists might learn as much from the farmer as vice versa, and to the\ndegree that specialists had to negotiate with farmers as political equals,\nwould the basic premise behind the officials' institutional status and power\nbe undermined. The unspoken logic behind most of the state projects of\nagricultural modernization was one of consolidating the power of central\ninstitutions and diminishing the autonomy of cultivators and their communities\nvis-a-vis those institutions. Every new material practice altered in some way\nthe existing distribution of power, wealth, and status; and the agricultural\nspecialists' claims to be neutral technicians with no institutional stake in\nthe outcome can hardly be accepted at face value.68\n\nThe centralizing effects of Soviet collectivization and ujamaa villages were\nperfectly obvious. So are those of large irrigation projects, where\nauthorities decide when to release the water, how to distribute it, and what\nwater fees to charge, or of agricultural plantations, where the workforce is\nsupervised as if it were in a factory setting.69 For colonialized farmers, the\neffect of such centralization and expertise was a radical de-skilling of the\ncultivators themselves. Even in the context of family farms and a liberal\neconomy, this was in fact the utopian prospect held up by Liberty Hyde Bailey,\na plant breeder, apostle of agricultural science, and the chairman of the\nCountry Life Commission under Theodore Roosevelt. Bailey declared, \"There will\nbe established in the open country plant doctors, plant breeders, soil\nexperts, health experts, pruning and spraying experts, forest experts,\nrecreation experts, market experts, ... [and] housekeeping experts, ... [all\nof whom are ] needed for the purpose of giving special advice and\ndirection.\"70 Bailey's future was one organized almost entirely by a\nmanagerial elite: \"Yet we are not to think of society as founded wholly on\nsmall separate tracts, of 'family farms,' occupied by persons who live merely\nin contentment; this would mean that all landsmen would be essentially\nlaborers. We need to hold on the land many persons who possess large powers of\norganization, who are managers, who can handle affairs in a bold way: it would\nbe fatal to the best social and spiritual results if such persons could find\nno adequate opportunities on the land and were forced into other\noccupations:\"71\n\nIn spite of these hopeful pronouncements and intentions, if one examines\ncarefully many of the agricultural innovations of the twentieth century-\ninnovations that seemed purely technical and hence neutral -one cannot but\nconclude that many of them created commercial and political monopolies that\ninevitably diminished the autonomy of the farmer. The revolution in hybrid\nseeds, particularly corn, had this ef- fect.72 Since hybrids are either\nsterile or do not breed \"true,\" the seed company that has bred the parents of\nthe hybrid-cross has valuable property in hybrid seed, which it can sell every\nyear, unlike the openpollinated varieties which the farmer can select\nhimself.73\n\nA similar but not identical centralizing logic applied to the highyielding\nvarieties (tIYvs) of wheat, rice, and maize developed over the past thirty\nyears. Their enormous impact on yields (an impact that varied widely by crop\nand growing conditions) depended on combining a massive response to nitrogen\napplication with short, tough stalks that prevented lodging. Realizing their\npotential yield required abundant water (usually via irrigation), large\napplications of commercial fertilizer, and the periodic application of\npesticides. Mechanization of field preparation and harvesting was also\npromoted. As with hybrids, the lack of biological diversity in the fields\nmeant that each generation of HYVVS was likely to succumb to infestations of\nfungus, rust, or insects, necessitating the purchase of new seeds and new\npesticides (as the insects built up resistance). The resulting biological arms\nrace, which plant breeders and chemists believe that they can continue to win,\nis one that puts the cultivator increasingly in the hands of public and\nprivate specialists. As with the truly democratic aspects of Nyerere's\npolicies, those elements of research and policy that might threaten the\nposition of a managerial elite tended either not to be explored at all or, if\nexplored, to be \"selected against\" in policy implementation.\n\n#### The Simplifying Assumptions of Agricultural Science\n\nThis attempt at total control is an invitation to disorder. And the rule seems\nto be that the more rigid and exclusive is the specialist's boundary, and the\nstricter the control within it, the more disorder rages around it. One can\ntake a greenhouse and grow summer vegetables in the wintertime, but in doing\nso one creates a vulnerability to the weather and to the possibility of\nfailure where none existed before. The control by which a tomato plant lives\nthrough January is much more problematic than the natural order by which an\noak tree or a titmouse lives through January.\n\n-Wendell Berry, The Unsettling of America\n\nMost of the elements of state development programs have not been merely the\nwhims of powerful elites. Even villagization in Tanzania had long been the\nsubject of apparently sound agroeconomic analysis. Schemes for the\nintroduction of such new crops as cotton, tobacco, groundnuts, and rice as\nwell as plans for mechanization, irrigation, and fertilizer regimens had been\npreceded by lengthy technical studies and field trials. Why, then, have such a\nlarge number of these schemes failed to deliver anything like the results\nforeseen for them? A closely related question, which we will address in the\nnext chapter, is why so many successful changes in agricultural practices and\nproduction have been pioneered, not by the state, but by the autonomous\ninitiative of cultivators themselves.\n\n##### The Isolation of Experimental Variables\n\nThe record shows, it seems to me, that a substantial part of the problem lies\nin the systematic and necessary limitations of scientific work whenever the\nultimate purpose of that work is practical adoption by a diverse set of\npractitioners working in a large variety of conditions. That is, some of the\nproblems lie deeper than the institutional temptations to central control, the\npathologies of administration, or the penchant for aesthetically satisfying\nbut uneconomic show projects. Even under the best of circumstances, the\nlaboratory results and the data from the experimental plots of research\nstations are a long country mile from the human and natural environments where\nthey must ultimately find a home.\n\nThe normal procedure in scientific agricultural research has historically been\nto focus almost exclusively on crop-by-crop experiments designed to test the\nimpact of variations in inputs on yields. More recently, other variables have\ncome under scrutiny. Thus experiments might test yields under different soil\nand moisture conditions or determine which hybrids resisted lodging or ripened\nin a way that facili tated machine harvesting. Ecologically conscious research\nhas often proceeded in the same fashion: by isolating one by one the variables\nthat might contribute, say, to biological resistance of a certain variety of\nfruit to a particular pest.\n\nThe isolation of a very few variables-ideally just two, while controlling all\nothers-is a key tenet of experimental science.74 As a procedure, it is both\nvaluable and necessary to scientific work. Only by radically simplifying the\nexperimental situation is it possible to guarantee unambiguous, verifiable,\nimpersonal, and universal results .71 As a pioneer in chaos theory has put it:\n\"There is a fundamental presumption in physics that the way you understand the\nworld is that you keep isolating its ingredients until you understand the\nstuff you think is truly fundamental. Then you presume that the other things\nyou don't understand are details. The assumption is that there are a small\nnumber of principles that you can discern by looking at things in their pure\nstatethis is the truly analytic notion-and somehow you put these together in\nsome more complicated ways when you want to solve more dirty problems. If you\ncan .\"16 In agricultural research, controlling for all possible variables\nexcept those under experimental scrutiny required normalizing assumptions\nabout such things as weather, soils, and landscapes, not to mention\nnormalizing assumptions, often implicit, about farm size, labor availability,\nand the desires of cultivators. \"Test-tube research,\" of course, most closely\napproximated the ideal of controls.77 Even the experimental plot on a research\nstation, however, was itself a radical simplification. It maximized the degree\nof control \"within a small and highly simplified enclosure\" and ignored the\nrest, leaving it \"totally out of control.\"78\n\nIt is easy to see how monoculture and attention to quantitative yields would\nfit most comfortably within this paradigm. Monoculture eliminates all other\ncultivars that might complicate the design, while concern with quantitative\nyields avoids the thorny measurement problems that would arise if a particular\nquality or taste were the objective. The science of forestry is easiest when\none is interested only in the commercial wood from a single species of tree.\nThe science of agriculture is easiest when it is a question of the most\nefficient way of getting as many bushels as possible of one hybrid of maize\nfrom a \"normalized\" acre.\n\nA progressive loss of experimental control occurs when one moves from the\nlaboratory to the research plot on an experimental station and then to field\ntrials on actual farms. Richards notes the unease such a move aroused among\nresearchers in West Africa, who were anxious about making their research more\npractical yet concerned about any relaxing of experimental conditions. After\ndiscussing how the farms selected for trials ought to be relatively\nhomogeneous so that they would respond in uniform ways to the experimental\nresults, the researchers went on to lament the experimental control that they\nthey lost by leaving the research station. \"It may be difficult,\" they wrote,\n\"to plant at all locations within a few days and almost impossible to find\nfarm plots of uniform soil.\" They continued, \"Other types of interference,\nsuch as pest attacks or bad weather, may affect some treatments and not oth-\ners.\"79 This is, Richards explains, a \"salutary reminder of one of the reasons\nwhy 'formal' scientific research procedures on experimental stations, with the\nstress on controlling all variables except the one or two under direct\ninvestigation, 'miss the point' as far as many small-holders are concerned.\nThe main concern of farmers is how to cope with these complex interactions and\nunscheduled events. From the scientist's point of view (particularly in\nrelation to the need to secure clear-cut results for publication), on-farm\nexperimentation poses a tough challenge.\"80\n\nTo the extent that science is obliged to deal simultaneously with the complex\ninteractions of many variables, it begins to lose the very characteristics\nthat distinguish it as modern science. Nor does the accumulation of many\nnarrow experimental studies add up to the same thing as a single study of such\ncomplexity. This is not, I must repeat, a case against the experimental\ntechniques of modern scientific research. Any extensive, on-farm research\nstudy that did not reduce the complexity of interactions might be able to\nshow, as farmers can, that a set of practices produced \"good results\": say,\nhigh yields. But it would not be able to isolate the key factors responsible\nfor this result. The case that I am making instead recognizes the power and\nutility of scientific work, within its domain, and recognizes its limitations\nin dealing with the kinds of problems for which its techniques are ill suited.\n\n##### Blind Spots\n\nReturning once again to the case of polyculture, we can see why agronomists\nmight have scientific as well as aesthetic and institutional grounds for\nopposing polycropping. Complex forms of intercropping introduce too many\nvariables into simultaneous play to offer much chance of unambiguous\nexperimental proof of causal relations. We know that certain polycultural\ntechniques, particularly those combining nitrogen-fixing legumes with grains,\nare quite productive, but we know little about the precise interactions that\nbring about these results.81 And we find problems in teasing out causation\neven when we confine our attention to the single dependent variable of\nquantitative yields.82 If we relax this restriction of focus and begin to\nconsider a wider range of dependent variables (outcomes), such as soil\nfertility, interactions with livestock (fodder, manuring), compatibility with\nfamily labor supply, and so on, the difficulties of comparison rapidly become\nintractable to scientific method.\n\nThe nature of the scientific problem here is strongly analogous to that of\ncomplexity in physical systems. The elegantly simple formulas of Newton's laws\nof mechanics make it relatively easy to calculate the orbits of two heavenly\nbodies once we know their respective masses and the distance between them. Add\none more body, however, and the calculation of orbits resulting from the\ninteraction becomes far more complex. When there are ten bodies interacting\n(this is the simplified version of our solar system),\"' no orbits ever exactly\nrepeat themselves, and there is no way to predict the long-term state of the\nsystem. As each new variable is introduced, the number of ramifying\ninteractions to be taken into account grows geometrically.\n\nIt does not stretch the facts too far, I think, to claim that scientific\nagricultural research has an elective affinity with agricultural techniques\nthat lie within reach of its powerful methods. Maximizing the yields of pure-\nstand crops is one technique where its power can be used to best advantage.\nInsofar as its institutional power has permitted, agricultural agencies, like\nscientific foresters, have tended to simplify their environments in ways that\nmake them more amenable to their system of knowledge. The forms of agriculture\nthat conformed to their modernist aesthetic and their politico-administrative\ninterests also happened to fit securely within the perimeter of their\nprofessional scientific vocation.84\n\nWhat of the \"disorder\" outside the realm of the experimental design? Extra-\nexperimental interactions can in fact prove beneficial when they strengthen\nthe desired effect.85 There is no a priori reason for anticipating what their\neffects might be; what is significant is that they lie wholly outside the\nexperimental model.\n\nOccasionally, however, these effects have been both important and potentially\nthreatening. A striking example from the years between 1947 and 1960 was the\nmassive, worldwide use of pesticides, the most infamous of which was DDT. DDT\nwas sprayed to kill mosquito populations and thereby reduce the many diseases\nthat the pests carry. The experimental model was largely confined to\ndetermining the dosage concentrations and application conditions required for\neradicating mosquito populations. Within its field of vision, the model was\nsuccessful; DDT did kill mosquitos and dramatically reduced the incidence of\nendemic malaria and other diseases.116 It also had, as we slowly be came\naware, devastating ecological effects, as residues were absorbed by organisms\nall along the food chain, of which humans are of course also a part. The\nconsequences of the use of DDT and other pesticides on soil, water, fish,\ninsects, birds, and fauna were so intricate that we have not yet gotten to the\nbottom of them.\n\n##### Weak Peripheral Vision\n\nPart of the problem was that the side effects were constantly ramifying. A\nfirst-order effect-say, the decline or disappearance of a local insect\npopulation-led to changes in flowering plants, which changed the habitat for\nother plants and for rodents, and so on. Another part of the problem was that\nthe effects of pesticides on other species were examined only under\nexperimental conditions. Yet the application of DDT was under field\nconditions, and as Carson pointed out, scientists had no idea what the\ninteractive effects of pesticides were when they were mixed with water and\nsoil and acted upon by sunlight.\n\nThat awareness of these interaction effects came from outside the scientific\nparadigm itself is both interesting and, I think, diagnostic. It began, in\nparticular, when people gradually came to realize that the songbird population\nhad suffered a radical decline. Public alarm at what was not happening anymore\noutside their kitchen windows led, eventually (through scientific research),\nto a tracing of how DDT concentrations in the organs of birds led to fragile\neggshells and reproductive failure. This finding in turn stimulated a host of\nrelated inquiries into the effects of pesticides and ultimately to legislation\nbanning the use of DDT. In this case, as in others, the power of the\nscientific paradigm was achieved partly by its exclusion of extra-experimental\nvariables that have often circled back, as it were, to take their revenge.\n\nThe logic of agroeconomic analysis of farming efficiency and profits also wins\nits power by a comparable restriction of the field of focus. Its tools are\nused to best advantage in examining the microeconomics of the farm as a firm.\nOn the basis of its necessary simplifying assumptions about factor costs,\ninputs, weather, labor use, and prices, it can show how profitable or\nunprofitable it might be to use a particular piece of machinery, to buy\nirrigation equipment, or to raise one crop rather than another. Studies of\nthis kind and also of marketing have tended to demonstrate the economies of\nscale achievable by large, highly capitalized, and highly mechanized\noperations. Outside this narrow perspective are hundreds of considerations\nthat are necessarily bracketed, in a manner similar to that used in\nexperimental science. But here, in agroeconomic analysis, the human agents\nadopting this view have the political capacity, in the short run at least, to\nmake certain that they are not held economically responsible for the larger\n\"extra-firm\" consequences of their logic. The pattern in agriculture in the\nUnited States was clearly outlined by a rogue economist testifying to Congress\nin 1972.\n\nOnly in the past decade has serious attention been given to the fact that the\nlarge agricultural firm is ... able to achieve benefits by externalizing\ncertain costs. The disadvantages of large scale operation fall largely outside\nthe decision-making framework of the large farm firm. Problems of waste\ndisposal, pollution control, added burdens on public service, deterioration of\nrural social structures, impairment of the tax base, and the political\nconsequences of a concentration of economic power have typically not been\nconsidered as costs of large scale, by the firm. They are unquestionably costs\nto the larger community.\n\nIn theory, large scale operation should enable the firm to bring a wide range\nof both costs and benefits within its internal decision-making framework. In\npractice the economic and political power that accompanies large scale\nprovides constant temptation to the large firm to take the benefits and pass\non the costs.\"\n\nIn other words, although the business analysts of the agricultural firms have\nweak peripheral vision, the political clout that such firms possess both\nindividually and collectively can help them avoid being blindsided.\n\n##### Shortsightedness\n\nNearly all studies purporting to evaluate decisions of interest to farmers are\nexperiments that last one or at most a few seasons. Implicitly, the logic\nbehind a research design of this kind is that the long-run effects will not\ncontradict the short-run findings. The question of the time horizon of\nresearch is directly relevant even to those for whom the maximization of\nyields is the holy grail. Unless they are exclusively interested in immediate\nyields, no matter what the consequences, their attention must be directed to\nthe issue of sustainability or to Hicksian income. Perhaps the most\nsignificant practical division is thus not between those who would design\nagricultural policy with cultural and social goals in mind (such as the\npreservation of the family farm, the landscape, or diversity) and those who\nwant to maximize production and profit, but rather between productionists with\na short view and productionists with a long view. After all, concern about\nsoil erosion and water supply was motivated less often by regard for the\nenvironment than by regard for the sustainability of current production.\n\nThe relatively short-run orientation of crop studies and farm economics works\nto exclude even those long-run results of interest to the productionists. Many\nof the claims for polyculture, for example, assert its superiority over the\nlong haul as a system of production. A polycropping trial of twenty or more\nyears, as Stephen Marglin has suggested, might well reach conclusions that are\nquite different from those derived from a trial that lasts a season or two.88\nIt is not at all implausible that the process of open pollination and\nselection by farmers, as opposed to hybridization, might have developed\ncultivars roughly equal in yield to the best hybrids and superior to them in\nmany other respects, including profitability. 89 The paper profits of\nscientific, monocropped forests, we now realize, were achieved at considerable\ncost to the long-term health and productivity of the forest. One would have\nsupposed that since most farms are family enterprises, there would have been\nmore studies of cropping and firm economics that took as their analytical unit\nof time the entire family cycle of one generation.90\n\nNothing in the logic of the scientific method itself seems to require that a\nshort-run perspective prevail; rather, such a perspective seems to be a\nresponse to institutional and perhaps commercial pressures. On the other hand,\nthe need to isolate a few variables while assuming everything else constant\nand the bracketing of interaction effects that lie outside the experimental\nmodel are very definitely inscribed in scientific method. They are a condition\nof the formidable clarity it achieves within its field of vision. Taken\ntogether, the parts of the landscape occluded by actual scientific practice-\nthe blind spots, the periphery, and the long view-also constitute a formidable\nportion of the real world.\n\n#### The Simplifying Practice of Scientific Agriculture\n\n##### Some Yields Are More Equal Than Others\n\nModern agricultural research commonly proceeds as if yields, per unit of\nscarce inputs, were the central concern of the farmer. The assumption is\nenormously convenient; like the commercial wood of scientific forestry, the\ngeneric, homologous, uniform commodities thus derived create the possibility\nboth of quantitative comparisons between the yield of different cultivation\ntechniques and of aggregate statistics. The familiar tabulations of acres\nplanted, yields per acre, and total production from year to year are usually\nthe decisive measure of success in a development program.\n\nBut the premise that all rice, all corn, and all millet are \"equal,\" however\nuseful, is simply not a plausible assumption about any crop unless it is\npurely a commodity for sale in the market.9' Each subspecies of grain has\ndistinctive properties, not just in how it grows but in its qual ities as a\ngrain once harvested. In some cultures, certain varieties of rice are grown\nfor use in certain distinctive dishes; other varieties of rice may be used\nonly for specific ritual purposes or in the settlement of local debts. Some of\nthe complex considerations that go into distinguishing one rice from another\nin terms of their cooking properties alone can be appreciated from Richards's\nobservations about how the considerations are weighed in Sierra Leone.\n\nA phrase like \"it cooks badly\" is often a catch-all for a range of properties\nconnected with storage, preparation and consumption, going well beyond\nsubjective questions of \"taste.\" Is the variety concerned welladapted to local\nfood processing techniques? Is it readily peeled, milled, and pounded? How\nmuch water and fuel does it require in cooking? How long does it keep, prior\nto cooking and once cooked? Mende women claim that improved swamp rices are\nmuch less palatable than the harder \"upland\" rices when served up a second\ntime. With the right kind of rice, it is possible to cut down the number of\ntimes it is necessary to cook during busy periods on the farm. Since cooking\nsometimes takes up to 3-4 hours per day (including the time taken to husk\nrice, prepare a fire and collect water) this is a factor of no small\nimportance when labour is short.92\n\nSo far, we have considered only the husked grain. What if we broaden our view\nto take in the rest of the plant? At once we see that there is a great deal\nmore to be harvested from a plant than its seed grains. Thus a Central\nAmerican peasant may not be interested only in the number and size of the corn\nkernels she harvested. She may also be interested in using the cobs for fodder\nand scrub brushes; the husk and leaves for wrappers, thatch, and fodder; and\nthe stalks as trellises for climbing beans, as fodder, and as temporary\nfencing. The fact that Central American farmers know of many more maize\nvarieties than do their counterparts in the Corn Belt of the United States is\npartly related to the uses to which different varieties are put. Maize may\nalso be sold in the market for any of these purposes and thus prized for\nqualities other than its kernels. The same story could, of course, be told\nabout virtually any widely grown cultivar. Its various parts from various\nstages of growth may come in handy as twine, vegetable dyes, medicinal\npoultices, greens to eat raw or to cook, packaging material, bedding, or items\nfor ritual or decorative purposes.\n\nEven from a commercial point of view, then, the plant is not simply its grain.\nNor are all grains of all subspecies and hybrids of maize and rice equal. The\nyield of seeds by weight or volume may therefore be only one of many ends-and\nperhaps not the most important one-for a cultivator. But once scientific\nagriculture or plant breeding begins to introduce this enormous range of value\nand uses into its own calcula tions, it is once again in the Newtonian dilemma\nof the ten heavenly bodies. And even if it were able to represent some of this\ncomplexity in its models, these usages are subject to change without notice.\n\n##### Experimental Plots Versus Actual Fields\n\nAll environments, as we noted earlier, are intractably local. There is always\nwhat we might call the translation problem in converting the generic,\nstandardized High Church Latin which emanates from labs and experimental\nstations into the vernacular of the local parish. Standardized solutions to\nfield preparation, planting schedules, and fertilizer requirements always have\nto be adjusted when they are applied to, say, a stony, low-lying, north-facing\nfield which has just grown two crops of oats. Agricultural scientists at\nresearch stations and extension agents are very much aware of this translation\nproblem, as are specialists in any applied science. The question is always how\nto discover and convey findings so that they will be helpful to farmers. As\nlong as the findings or solutions are not simply imposed, the farmer must\ndecide if they meet his needs.\n\nLike cadastral maps, the experimental plots of agricultural research stations\ncannot begin to represent the diversity and variability of farmers' fields.\nThe researchers must operate on the basis of standard, normal-range\nassumptions about soil, field preparation, weeding, rainfall, temperature, and\nso on, whereas each farmer's field is a unique concatenation of circumstances,\nactions, and events, some of which are knowable in advance (soil composition)\nand some of which are out of anyone's hands (the weather). The interactions\namong these and other variables are at least as important as the status of\neach; thus the effects of an early monsoon on rocky soil that has just been\nweeded are different from those of an early monsoon on waterlogged land that\nhas not been weeded.\n\nThe averages and normalizations of experimental work obscure the fact that an\naverage weather year or a standard soil is a statistical fiction. As Wendell\nBerry puts it:\n\nThe industrial version of agriculture has it that farming brings the farmer\nannually, over and over again, to the same series of problems, to each one of\nwhich there is always the same generalized solution, and therefore, that\nindustry's solution can be simply and safely substituted for his solution. But\nthat is false. On a good farm, because of weather and other so-called\nvariables, neither the annual series of problems nor any of the problems\nindividually is ever quite the same two years running. The good farmer (like\nthe artist, the quarterback, the statesman) must be master of many possible\nsolutions, one of which he must choose under pressure and apply with skill in\nthe right place at the right time.93\n\nSoil, although it is not as capriciously variable day by day as the weather,\nis often exceptionally variable within the same field. The essential\nsimplifications of agricultural science require, first, that soil be sorted\ninto a small number of categories based on acidity, nitrogen levels, and other\nqualities. For analyzing the soil of a single field, the practice is to gather\nbits of soil from several parts of the field and to combine them in the sample\nto be analyzed so that it will represent an average. This procedure implicitly\nrecognizes the substantial variation in soil quality over a given field. The\nrecommended fertilizer application may therefore not be right for any part of\nthe field, but compared to applications derived from other formulas, it will\nbe \"less wrong,' on average, for the field as a whole. Once again, Berry\ncautions us against these generalizations: \"Most farms, even most fields, are\nmade up of different kinds of soil patterns and soil sense. Good farmers have\nalways known this and have used the land accordingly; they have been careful\nstudents of the natural vegetation, soil depth, and structure, slope and\ndrainage. They are not appliers of generalizations, theoretical or\nmethodological or mechanical.\"94 When, to the complexity and variation of the\nsoil conditions, we add the practice of polyculture, the obstacles to a\nsuccessful application of a general formula become virtually insurmountable.\nThe knowledge we do have of the limits on some plants' tolerance of\ntemperature and moisture does not ensure that they will necessarily thrive\nwithin these limits. The typical plant is \"awfully finicky about just where\nand when it will grow, under exactly what conditions it will germinate,\" as\nEdgar Anderson explains. \"The vastly more intricate business of which plants\nthey will and will not tolerate as neighbors and under what conditions, has\nnever been looked into except in a preliminary way for a few species °95\n\nIndigenous farmers are exceptionally alert to microfeatures of terrain and\nenvironment that are important to cultivation. Two examples from Richards's\nanalysis of West Africa will serve to illustrate the small details that are\nsimply too minute to be visible within a standardizing grid. Among the\nbewildering variety of small-scale, local irrigation practices, Richards\nclassifies at least eleven different kinds, some with subvariations. All\ndepend directly on locally specific details of topography, soil, flooding,\nrainfall, and so on, with the type of irrigation used depending on whether the\narea is a seasonally flooded delta, saucer-shaped depression with poor\ndrainage, or an inland valley swamp. These small \"schemes,\" which take\nadvantage of the existing possibilities of the landscape, are a far cry from\nvast engineered schemes in which no effort is spared to modify the landscape\nin conformity with the engineering plan.\n\nRichards's second example shows how West African farmers used a rather simple\nbut ingenious choice in what strain of rice to plant to help them cope with a\nlocal pest. Mende farmers on one area of Sierra Leone had, against the\ntextbook advice on the varieties of rice to be preferred, selected a variant\nof rice with long awns (beard or bristles) and glumes (bracts). The textbook\nreasoning was probably that such varieties were lower yielding or that the\nawns and glumes would simply add more chaff that would have to be winnowed\nafter threshing. The farmers' reasoning was that the long awns and glumes\ndiscouraged birds from eating the bulk of their rice before it ever made it to\nthe threshing floor. These details about microirrigation and the damage caused\nby birds are vital for local cultivators, but such details do not and cannot\nappear on the high-flying mapping of modern agricultural planning.\n\nMany critics of scientific agriculture have claimed not only that it has\nsystematically favored large-scale, production-oriented monoculture but that\nits research findings are of at best limited use, since all agriculture is\nlocal. Howard argued for a fundamentally different practice, basing it on two\npremises. The first was that experimental plots could not yield helpful\nresults.\n\nSmall plots and farms are very different things. It is impossible to manage a\nsmall plot as a self-contained unit in the same way as a good farm is\nconducted. The essential relation between livestock and the land is lost;\nthere are no means of maintaining the fertility of the soil by suitable\nrotations as is the rule in good farming. The plot and the farm are obviously\nout of relation; the plot does not even represent the field in which it\noccurs. A collection of field plots cannot represent the agricultural problem\nthey set out to investigate.... What possible advantage therefore can be\nobtained by the application of higher mathematics to a technique which is so\nfundamentally unsound?96\n\nHoward's second premise is that many of the most important indications of a\nfarm and a crop's health are qualitative: \"Can a mutually interacting system\nlike the crop and the soil, for example, dependent on a multitude of factors\nwhich are changing from week-to-week and yearto-year, ever be made to yield\nquantitative results corresponding to the precision of mathematics?\"97 As\nHoward sees it, the danger is that the narrow, experimental, and exclusively\nquantitative approach will succeed in completely driving out the other forms\nof local knowledge and judgment possessed by most cultivators.\n\nBut Howard and others, it seems to me, miss the most important abstraction of\nexperimental work in scientific agriculture. How can we define how useful this\nresearch is until we know the ends to which cultivators will put it? Useful\nfor what? It is at the level of human agency where scientific agriculture\nconstructs its greatest abstraction: the creation of a stock character, the\nEveryman cultivator, who is interested only in realizing the greatest yields\nat the least cost.\n\n##### Fictional Farmers Versus Real Farmers\n\nNot only are the weather, the crops, and the soil complex and variable; the\nfarmer is, too. Season by season and frequently day by day, millions of\ncultivators are pursuing an innumerable variety of complicated goals. These\ngoals and the shifting mix between them defy any simple model or description.\n\nProfitable production of one or more major crops, the usual standard of\nagricultural research, is obviously one purpose shared by most cultivators. It\nis instructive, nevertheless, to observe how deeply mediated this goal is by\nother purposes that may indeed usurp it altogether. The complexities I suggest\nbelow merely scratch the surface.\n\nEach farm family has its unique endowment of land, skills, tools, and labor,\nwhich greatly constrain how it farms. Consider only one aspect of labor\nsupply: a \"labor-rich\" farm with many able-bodied young workers has options in\ngrowing labor-intensive crops, in planting schedules, and in developing\nartisan sidelines that are not easily available to \"labor-poor\" farms.\nFurthermore, the same family farm will go through several stages in the course\nof a family cycle of development.98 Farmers who migrate out for wage work\nduring part of the year may plant crops of early or late maturity or crops\nrequiring little care in order to accommodate their migratory schedule.\n\nAs we saw earlier, a particular crop's profit may be tied to more than just\nits yield in grain and the cost of producing it. The stubble of a crop may be\ncrucial as fodder for livestock or waterfowl. A crop may be vital because of\nwhat it does to the soil in rotation with other crops or how it assists\nanother crop with which it is interplanted. A crop may be less important for\nits grain that for what it supplies, in raw material, for artisanal\nproduction, whether that material is sold in the market or used at home.\nFamilies who live close to the subsistence line may choose their crops, not on\nthe basis of their profitability, but on the basis of how steady their yields\nare and whether they can be eaten if their market price plunges.\n\nThe complexities thus far introduced could, at least in principle, be\naccommodated within a drastically modified, neoclassical notion of economic\nmaximization, even though it would be too elaborate to model easily. Once we\nadd such considerations as aesthetics, rituals, taste, and social and\npolitical considerations, this is no longer the case. There are any number of\nperfectly rational but noneconomic reasons for wanting to grow a certain crop\nin a certain way, whether because one wishes to maintain cooperative relations\nwith neighbors or because a particular crop is linked to group identity. Such\ncultural habits are perfectly compatible with commercial success, as the\nexperience of the Amish, Mennonites, and Hutterites demonstrates. As long as\nwe are pointing to the high level of abstraction of \"the farm family\" for whom\nscientific agricultural research does its work, we should note that, in much\nof the world, an understanding of the practices in use on almost any farm will\nrequire distinguishing the purposes of the various members of the family. Each\nfamily enterprise is, on closer inspection, a partnership-albeit typically\nunequal-with its own internal politics.\n\nThe units of \"farmer\" and \"farm community\" are, finally, every bit as\nintricate and fluid as the weather, soil, and landscape. Mapping them is even\nmore problematic than, say, analyzing the soil. The reason, I think, is that\nwhile the farmer's expertise may occasionally fail him in assessing his own\nsoil, we will not doubt the farmer's expertise in knowing his own mind and\ninterests.99\n\nJust as the buzzing complexity and plasticity of customary land tenure\npractices cannot be satisfactorily represented in the straitjacket of modern\nfreehold property law, so the complex motives and goals of cultivators and the\nland they farm cannot be effectively portrayed by the standardizations of\nscientific agriculture. The schematic representations so important for\nexperimental work can and have produced important new knowledge, which,\nsuitably adapted, has been incorporated into most agricultural routines. But\nsuch abstractions, again like those of freehold tenure, are powerful\nmisrepresentations that usually circle back to influence reality. They\noperate, at a minimum, to generate research and findings most applicable to\nfarms that meet the description of their schematization: large, monocropped,\nmechanized, commercial farms producing solely for the market. In addition,\nthis standardization is typically linked to public policy in the form of tax\nincentives, loans, price supports, marketing subsidies, and, significantly,\nhandicaps imposed on enterprises that do not fit the schematization, which\nsystematically operate to nudge reality toward the grid of its observations.\nThe effect is nothing like the shock therapy of the campaigns for Soviet\ncollectivization or ujamaa villages, which relied more on sticks than carrots.\nBut over the long haul such a powerful grid can, and does, change the\nlandscape.\n\n#### Two Agricultural Logics Compared\n\nIf the logic of actual farming is one of an inventive, practiced response to a\nhighly variable environment, the logic of scientific agriculture is, by\ncontrast, one of adapting the environment as much as possible to its\ncentralizing and standardizing formulas. Thanks to the pioneering work of Jan\nDouwe van der Ploeg, it is possible to spell out how this logic works for\npotato cultivation in the Andes. 100\n\nVan der Ploeg calls indigenous potato cultivation in the Andes a \"craft\" 101\nThe cultivator begins with an exceptionally diverse local ecology and aims at\nboth successfully adapting to it and gradually improving it. Andean farmers'\nskills have allowed them to achieve results that are quite respectable in\nterms of narrow productionist goals and extraordinarily so in terms of\nreliability of yields and sustainability.\n\nThe typical farmer cultivates anywhere from twelve to fifteen distinct parcels\nas well as other plots on a rotating basis. 101 Given the great variety of\nconditions on each plot (altitude, soil, history of cultivation, slope,\norientation to wind and sun), each field is unique. The very idea of a\n\"standard field\" in this context is an empty abstraction. \"Some fields contain\nonly one cultivar, others between two and ten, sometimes interplanted in the\nsame row or with each in its own row.\" 101 Each cultivar is a well-placed bet\nin its niche. The variety of cultivars makes for local experimentation with\nnew crosses and hybrids, each of which is tested and exchanged among farmers,\nand the many landraces of potatoes thus developed have unique characteristics\nthat become well known. From the appearance of a new variety to its\nsubstantial use in the fields takes at least five or six years. Each season is\nthe occasion for a new round of prudent bets, with last season's results in\nterms of yield, disease, prices, and response to changed plot conditions\nhaving been carefully weighed. These farms are market-oriented experiment\nstations with good yields, great adaptability, and reliability. Perhaps more\nimportant, they are not just producing crops; they are reproducing farmers and\ncommunities with plant breeding skills, flexible strategies, ecological\nknowledge, and considerable self-confidence and autonomy.\n\nCompare this \"craft-based\" potato production with the inherent logic of\nscientific agriculture. The process begins with the definition of an ideal\nplant type. \"Ideal\" is defined mainly, but not only, in terms of yields.\nProfessional plant breeders then begin synthesizing the strains that might\ncombine to form a new genotype with the desired charac teristics. Then, and\nonly then, are the plant strains grown in experimental plots in order to\ndetermine the conditions under which the potential of the new genotype will be\nrealized. The basic procedure is exactly the reverse of Andean craft\nproduction, where the cultivator begins with the plot, its soil, and its\necology and then selects or develops varieties that will likely thrive in this\nsetting. The variety of cultivars in such a community is in large part a\nreflection of the variety of both local needs and ecological conditions. In\nscientific potato growing, by contrast, the point of departure is the new\ncultivar or genotype, in service of which every effort is made to transform\nand homogenize field conditions so that the field meets the genotype's\nspecific requirements.\n\nThe logic of beginning with an ideal genotype and then transforming nature to\naccord with its growing conditions has some predictable consequences.\nExtension work essentially becomes the attempt to remake the farmer's field to\nsuit the genotype. This usually requires the application of nitrogen\nfertilizer and pesticides, which must be purchased and applied at the right\nmoment. It usually also requires a watering regimen that in many cases only\nirrigation can possibly satisfy., 04 The timing of all operations for this\ngenotype (planting, cultivating, fertilizer spreading, and so forth) are\nspelled out carefully. The logic of the process-a logic not even remotely\nrealized on the ground-is to transform the farmers into \"standard\" farmers\ngrowing the required genotype on similar soils and leveled fields and\naccording to the instructions printed right on the seed packages, applying the\nsame fertilizers, pesticides, and amounts of water. It is a logic of\nhomogenization and the virtual elimination of local knowledge. To the degree\nthat this homogenization is successful, the genotype will likely succeed in\nterms of production levels in the short run. Conversely, to the degree that\nsuch homogenization is impossible, the genotype will fail.\n\nOnce the job of the agricultural specialist is defined as one of raising all\nfarmers' plots to the uniform condition that will realize the new cultivar's\npromise, there is no further need to attend to the great variety of\nconditions-some of which are unalterable-on actual farmers' fields. Rather\nthan have the facts on the ground muddy a simple, unitary research issue, it\nwas more convenient to try to impose a research abstraction on the fields (and\nlives) of farmers. Given the intractable ecological variety of the Andes, this\nwas a nearly fatal step.101 Rarely have agricultural specialists asked\nthemselves, as did the Russian S. P. Fridolin well before the revolution,\nwhether they might not be working from the wrong angle: \"He realized that his\nwork was actually harming the peasants. Instead of learning what local\nconditions were and then making agricultural practice fit these conditions\nbetter, he had been trying to 'improve' local practice so that it would\nconform to abstract standards.\"106 It is little wonder that scientific\nagriculture tends to favor the creation of large artificial practices and\nenvironmentsirrigation schemes, large and leveled fields, the application of\nfertilizer by formula, greenhouses, pesticides-all of which allow a\nhomogenization and control of nature within which \"ideal\" experimental\nconditions for its genotypes can be maintained.\n\nThere is, I think, a larger lesson here. An explicit set of rules will take\nyou further when the situation is cut-and-dried. The more static and one-\ndimensional the stereotype, the less the need for creative interpretation and\nadaptation. In the Andes, van der Ploeg implies, the \"rules\" attached to the\nnew potato were so restrictive that they could never be successfully\ntranslated to the great variety of local farming vernaculars. One of the major\npurposes of state simplifications, collectivization, assembly lines,\nplantations, and planned communities alike is to strip down reality to the\nbare bones so that the rules will in fact explain more of the situation and\nprovide a better guide to behavior. To the extent that this simplification can\nbe imposed, those who make the rules can actually supply crucial guidance and\ninstruction. This, at any rate, is what I take to be the inner logic of\nsocial, economic, and productive de-skilling. If the environment can be\nsimplified down to the point where the rules do explain a great deal, those\nwho formulate the rules and techniques have also greatly expanded their power.\nThey have, correspondingly, diminished the power of those who do not. To the\ndegree that they do succeed, cultivators with a high degree of autonomy,\nskills, experience, self-confidence, and adaptability are replaced by\ncultivators following instructions. Such reduction in diversity, movement, and\nlife, to recall Jacobs's term, represents a kind of social \"taxidermy.\"\n\nThe new potato genotype, as van der Ploeg shows, usually fails, if not\nimmediately, within three or four years. Unlike the ensemble of indigenous\nvarieties, the new cultivar thrives within a narrower band of environmental\nconditions. Many things, in other words, must go right for the new cultivar to\nproduce well, and if any of these things goes wrong (too much hot weather,\nlate delivery of fertilizer, and so forth), the yields suffer dramatically.\nWithin a few years the new genotypes \"become incapable of generating even low\nlevels of production.\" 101\n\nIn practice, however, the vast majority of Andean cultivators are neither\npurely traditional cultivators nor mindless followers of the scientific\nspecialists. They are, instead, crafting unique amalgams of strategies that\nreflect their aims, their resources, and their local conditions. Where the new\npotatoes seem to fit their purposes, they may plant some, but they may\ninterplant them with other cultivars and may sub stitute dung, or plow in\ngreen manure (alfalfa, clover), rather than apply the standard fertilizer\npackage. They are constantly inventing and experimenting with different\nrotations, timing, and weeding techniques. But because of the very\nparticularity of these thousands of \"infield experiments\" and the specialists'\nstudied inattention to them, they are illegible, if not invisible, to\nscientific research. Farmers, being polytheists when it comes to agricultural\npractice, are quick to seize whatever seems useful from the epistemic work of\nformal science. But the researchers, trained as monotheists, seem all but\nincapable of absorbing the informal experimental results of practice.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe great confidence that high-modernist agriculture has inspired among its\npractitioners and partisans should not surprise us. It is associated with\nunparalleled agricultural productivity in the West and with the power and\nprestige of the scientific and industrial revolutions. Little wonder, then,\nthat the tenets of high modernism, as talismans of the true faith, should have\nbeen carried throughout the world uncritically and indeed with the conviction\nthat they lighted the way to agricultural progress. 10,1 I believe that this\nuncritical, and hence unscientific, trust in the artifacts and techniques of\nwhat became codified as scientific agriculture was responsible for its\nfailures. The logical companion to a complete faith in a quasi-industrial\nmodel of highmodernist agriculture was an often explicit contempt for the\npractices of actual cultivators and what might be learned from them. Whereas a\nscientific spirit would have counseled skepticism and dispassionate inquiry\ninto these practices, modern agriculture as a blind faith preached scorn and\nsummary dismissal.\n\nActual cultivators in West Africa and elsewhere should more accurately have\nbeen understood as lifelong experimenters conducting infield seasonal trials,\nthe results of which they incorporated into their ever-evolving repertoire of\npractices. Inasmuch as these experimenters were and are surrounded by hundreds\nor thousands of other local experimenters with whom they share research\nfindings and the knowledge of generations of earlier research as codified in\nfolk wisdom, they could be said to have instant access to the popular\nequivalent of an impressive research library. Now it is also undeniably the\ncase that they carry out most of their research without the proper\nexperimental controls and are therefore prone to drawing false inferences from\ntheir findings. They are also limited by what they can observe; micropro-\ncesses only visible in the laboratory necessarily escape them. Nor is it clear\nthat the ecological logic that seems to work well on a single farm over the\nlong haul will at the same time produce sustainable aggregate results for an\nentire region.\n\nThat said, it is also the case, however, that West African cultivators have at\ntheir disposal a lifetime of careful, local observation and the fine-grained\nknowledge of the locality that no research scientist can hope to duplicate for\nthe same terrain. And let us not fail to note what kind of experimenters these\nare. Their lives and the lives of their families depend directly on the\noutcomes of their field experiments. Given these important positional\nadvantages, one would have imagined that agricultural scientists would have\npaid attention to what these farmers did know. It was their failure to do so,\nHoward claims, that constitutes the great shortcoming of modern scientific\nagriculture: \"The approach to the problems of farming must be made from the\nfield, not from the laboratory. The discovery of the things that matter is\nthree quarters of the battle. In this the observant farmer and labourer, who\nhave spent their lives in close contact with nature, can be of greatest help\nto the investigator. The views of the peasantry in all countries are worthy of\nrespect; there is always good reason for their practices; in matters like the\ncultivation of mixed crops they themselves are still the pioneers\" 109 Howard\ncredits most of his own findings about soil, humus, and root action to a\ncareful observation of indigenous farming practice. And he is rather\ndisdainful of agricultural specialists who \"do not have to take their own\nadvice\"-that is, who have never had to see their own crop through from\nplanting to harvest. 10\n\nWhy, then, the unscientific scorn for practical knowledge? There are at least\nthree reasons for it, as far as I can tell. The first is the \"professional\"\nreason mentioned earlier: the more the cultivator knows, the less the\nimportance of the specialist and his institutions. The second is the simple\nreflex of high modernism: namely, a contempt for history and past knowledge.\nAs the scientist is always associated with the modern and the indigenous\ncultivator with the past that modernism will banish, the scientist feels that\nhe or she has little to learn from that quarter. The third reason is that\npractical knowledge is represented and codified in a form uncongenial to\nscientific agriculture. From a narrow scientific view, nothing is known until\nand unless it is proven in a tightly controlled experiment. Knowledge that\narrives in any form other than through the techniques and instruments of\nformal scientific procedure does not deserve to be taken seriously. The\nimperial pretense of scientific modernism admits knowledge only if it arrives\nthrough the aperture that the experimental method has constructed for its\nadmission. Traditional practices, codified as they are in practice and in folk\nsayings, are seen presumptively as not meriting attention, let alone\nverification.\n\nAnd yet, as we have seen, cultivators have devised and perfected a host of\ntechniques that do work, producing desirable results in crop production, pest\ncontrol, soil preservation, and so forth. By constantly observing the results\nof their field experiments and retaining those methods that succeed, the\nfarmers have discovered and refined practices that work, without knowing the\nprecise chemical or physical reasons why they work. In agriculture, as in many\nother fields, \"practice has long preceded theory.\"\"' And indeed some of these\npractically successful techniques, which involve a large number of\nsimultaneously interacting variables, may never be fully understood by the\ntechniques of science. We turn, then, to a closer examination of practical\nknowledge, a kind of knowledge that high modernism has ignored to its peril.\n\n\n# Part 4\n\n## The Missing Link\n\n\n# 9 Thin Simplifications and  \nPractical Knowledge:  \nMetis\n\n![](img0050.jpg)\n\nNo battle-Tarutino, Borodino, or Austerlitz-takes place as those who planned\nit anticipated. That is an essential condition.\n\n-Tolstoy, War and Peace\n\nWe have repeatedly observed the natural and social failures of thin, formulaic\nsimplifications imposed through the agency of state power. The utilitarian\ncommercial and fiscal logic that led to geometric, monocropped, same-age\nforests also led to severe ecological damage. Where the formula had been\napplied with the greatest rigor, it eventually became necessary to attempt to\nrestore much of the forest's original diversity and complexity-or rather, to\ncreate a \"virtual\" forest that would mimic the robustness and durability of\nthe \"prescientific\" forest.\n\nThe planned \"scientific city,\" laid out according to a small number of\nrational principles, was experienced as a social failure by most of its\ninhabitants. Paradoxically, the failure of the designed city was often\naverted, as was the case in Brasilia, by practical improvisations and illegal\nacts that were entirely outside the plan. Just as the stripped-down logic\nbehind the scientific forest was an inadequate recipe for a healthy,\n\"successful\" forest, so were the thin urban-planning schemata of Le Corbusier\nan inadequate recipe for a satisfactory human community.\n\nAny large social process or event will inevitably be far more complex than the\nschemata we can devise, prospectively or retrospectively, to map it. Lenin had\nevery reason, as a would-be head of the vanguard party, to emphasize military\ndiscipline and hierarchy in the revolutionary project. After the October\nRevolution, the Bolshevik state authorities had every reason, once again, to\nexaggerate the central, allseeing role of the party in bringing the revolution\nabout. And yet we know-and Lenin and Luxemburg knew-that the revolution had\nbeen a close call, relying more on the improvisations, missteps, and strokes\nof luck that Tolstoy described in War and Peace than on the precision of a\nparade-ground drill.\n\nThe thin simplifications of agricultural collectivization and centrally\nplanned production have met a comparable fate, whether on the collective farms\nof the former Soviet Union or in the ujamaa villages of Nyerere's Tanzania.\nHere again, the schemes that did not collapse altogether managed to survive\nthanks largely to desperate measures either not envisaged or else expressly\nprohibited by the plan. Thus an informal economy developed in Russian\nagriculture, operating on tiny private plots and and the \"theft\" of time,\nequipment, and commodities from the state sector and supplying most of the\ndairy products, fruit, vegetables, and meat in the Russian diet.' Thus the\nforcibly resettled Tanzanians successfully resisted collective production and\ndrifted back to sites more suitable for grazing and cultivation. At times, the\nprice of an unyielding imposition of state simplifications on agrarian life\nand production-Stalin's forced collectivization or China's Great Leap Forward-\nwas famine. As often as not, however, state officials recoiled before the\nabyss and came to tolerate, if not condone, a host of informal practices that\nin fact underwrote the survival of the official scheme.\n\nThese rather extreme instances of massive, state-imposed social engineering\nillustrate, I think, a larger point about formally organized social action. In\neach case, the necessarily thin, schematic model of social organization and\nproduction animating the planning was inadequate as a set of instructions for\ncreating a successful social order. By themselves, the simplified rules can\nnever generate a functioning community, city, or economy. Formal order, to be\nmore explicit, is always and to some considerable degree parasitic on informal\nprocesses, which the formal scheme does not recognize, without which it could\nnot exist, and which it alone cannot create or maintain.\n\nThis homely insight has long been of great tactical value to generations of\ntrade unionists who have used it as the basis of the work-torule strike. In a\nwork-to rule action (the French call it greve du zele), employees begin doing\ntheir jobs by meticulously observing every one of the rules and regulations\nand performing only the duties stated in their job descriptions. The result,\nfully intended in this case, is that the work grinds to a halt, or at least to\na snail's pace. The workers achieve the practical effect of a walkout while\nremaining on the job and following their instructions to the letter. Their\naction also illustrates pointedly how actual work processes depend more\nheavily on informal understandings and improvisations than upon formal work\nrules. In the long work-to-rule action against Caterpillar, the large\nequipment manufacturer, for example, workers reverted to following the\ninefficient proce dures specified by the engineers, knowing they would cost\nthe company valuable time and quality, rather than continuing the more\nexpeditious practices they had long ago devised on the job.' They were relying\non the tested assumption that working strictly by the book is necessarily less\nproductive than working with initiative.\n\nThis perspective on social order is less an analytical insight than a\nsociological truism. It does offer, however, a valuable point of departure for\nunderstanding why authoritarian, high-modernist schemes are potentially so\ndestructive. What they ignore-and often suppress-are precisely the practical\nskills that underwrite any complex activity. My aim in this chapter is to\nconceptualize these practical skills, variously called know-how (savoir faire\nor arts de faire),] common sense, experience, a knack, or metis. What are\nthese skills? How are they created, developed, and maintained? What is their\nrelation to formal epistemic knowledge? I hope to show that many forms of high\nmodernism have replaced a valuable collaboration between these two dialects of\nknowledge with an \"imperial\" scientific view, which dismisses practical\nknowhow as insignificant at best and as dangerous superstitions at worst. The\nrelation between scientific knowledge and practical knowledge is, as we shall\nsee, part of a political struggle for institutional hegemony by experts and\ntheir institutions. Taylorism and scientific agriculture are, on this reading,\nnot just strategies of production, but also strategies of control and\nappropriation.\n\n#### Metis: The Contours of Practical Knowledge\n\nFollowing the illuminating studies of Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant,\nwe can find in the Greek concept of metis a means of comparing the forms of\nknowledge embedded in local experience with the more general, abstract\nknowledge deployed by the state and its technical agencies.4 Before\nelaborating the concept and its use, we will turn to a brief example in order\nto illustrate the vernacular character of local knowledge and ground the\ndiscussion that follows.\n\nWhen the first European settlers in North America were wondering when and how\nto plant New World cultivars, such as maize, they turned to the local\nknowledge of their Native American neighbors for help. They were told by\nSquanto, according to one legend (Chief Massasoit, according to another), to\nplant corn when the oak leaves were the size of a squirrel's ear.' Embedded in\nthis advice, however folkloric its ring today, is a finely observed knowledge\nof the succession of natural events in the New England spring. For Native\nAmericans it was this orderly succession of, say, the skunk cabbage appearing,\nthe willows be ginning to leaf, the red-wing blackbird returning, and the\nfirst hatch of the mayfly that provided a readily observable calendar of\nspring. While the timing of these events might be earlier or later in a given\nyear and while the pace of their succession might be more drawn out or\naccelerated, the sequence of the events was almost never violated. As a rule\nof thumb, it was a nearly foolproof formula for avoiding a frost. We almost\ncertainly distort Squanto's advice, as the colonists perhaps did, by reducing\nit to a single observation. Everything we know about indigenous technical\nknowledge suggests that it relies on an accumulation of many partly redundant\nsignals. If other indications did not confirm the oak-leaf formula, a prudent\nplanter might delay further.\n\nCompare this advice to that based on more universalistic units of measurement.\nA typical local edition of The Farmer's Almanac is a case in point. It may\nsuggest planting corn after the first full moon in May or after a specified\ndate, such as May 20. In New England, at any rate, this advice would require\nconsiderable adjustment by latitude and altitude. A date that would serve for\nsouthern Connecticut would not suit Vermont; a date that worked in the valleys\nwould not be right for the hills (especially the north-facing slopes); a date\nthat worked near the coast would not work inland. And the almanac's date is\nalmost certainly a fail-safe date, since the worst thing that could happen to\nan almanac publisher would be to have his or her advice lead to a crop\nfailure. As a result of this commercial caution, some valuable growing time\nmay have been lost in the interest of certainty.6\n\nThe Native American maxim, by contrast, is vernacular and local, keyed to\ncommon features of the local ecosystem; it inquires about oak leaves in this\nplace, and not oak leaves in general. Despite its specificity, it travels\nremarkably well. It can be deployed successfully anywhere in temperate North\nAmerica where there are oak trees and squirrels. The precision provided by the\nobserved sequence almost certainly gains a few days of growing time while not\nappreciably raising the risk of planting before a hard frost.\n\nPractical knowledge like Squanto's can, of course, be translated into more\nuniversalistic scientific terms. A botanist might observe that the first\ngrowth of oak leaves is made possible by rising ground and ambient\ntemperatures, which also assure that maize will grow and that the probability\nof a killing frost is negligible. The mean soil temperature at a given depth\nmight do just as well. Along these lines, the early nineteenth-century\nmathematician, Adolph Quetelet, turned his scientific eye to the mundane\nproblem of when the lilacs would bloom in Brussels. He concluded, after much\nrigorous observation, that the lilacs burst into bloom \"when the sum of the\nsquares of the mean daily temperature since the last frost added up to (4264C)\nsquared:'' Knowledge this certainly is! Given the techniques for making the\nrequired observations, it is probably quite accurate. But it is hardly\npractical. Quetelet's playful formula alerts us to a hallmark of most\npractical, local knowledge: it is as economical and accurate as it needs to\nbe, no more and no less, for addressing the problem at hand.\n\nOne hesitates before introducing yet another unfamiliar term, such as \"metis,\"\ninto this discussion. In this case, however, \"metis\" seems to better convey\nthe sorts of practical skills that I have in mind than do such plausible\nalternatives as \"indigenous technical knowledge,\" \"folk wisdom,\" \"practical\nskills,\" techne, and so on.8\n\nThe concept comes to us from the ancient Greeks. Odysseus was frequently\npraised for having metis in abundance and for using it to outwit his enemies\nand make his way home. Metis is typically translated into English as \"cunning\"\nor \"cunning intelligence.\" While not wrong, this translation fails to do\njustice to the range of knowledge and skills represented by metis. Broadly\nunderstood, metis represents a wide array of practical skills and acquired\nintelligence in responding to a constantly changing natural and human\nenvironment. Odysseus's metis was in evidence, not only in his deceiving of\nCirce, the Cyclops, and Polyphemus and in binding himself to the mast to avoid\nthe Sirens, but also in holding his men together, in repairing his ship, and\nin improvising tactics to get his men out of one tight spot after another. The\nemphasis is both on Odysseus's ability to adapt successfully to a constantly\nshifting situation and on his capacity to understand, and hence outwit, his\nhuman and divine adversaries.\n\nAll human activities require a considerable degree of metis, but some\nactivities require far more. To begin with skills that require adapting to a\ncapricious physical environment, the acquired knowledge of how to sail, fly a\nkite, fish, shear sheep, drive a car, or ride a bicycle relies on the capacity\nfor metis. Each of these skills requires hand-eye coordination that comes with\npractice and a capacity to \"read\" the waves, the wind, or the road and to make\nthe appropriate adjustments. One powerful indication that they all require\nmetis is that they are exceptionally difficult to teach apart from engaging in\nthe activity itself. One might imagine trying to write down explicit\ninstructions on how to ride a bicycle, but one can scarcely imagine that such\ninstructions would enable a novice to ride a bicycle on the first try. The\nmaxim \"Practice makes perfect\" was devised for such activities as this,\ninasmuch as the continual, nearly imperceptible adjustments necessary for\nriding a bicycle are best learned by having to make them. Only through an\nacquired \"feel\" for balanced motion do the required adjustments become\nautomatic.9 No wonder that most crafts and trades requiring a touch or feel\nfor implements and materials have traditionally been taught by long\napprenticeships to master craftsmen.\n\nThere is no doubt that some individuals seem to get the hang of a particular\nskill and master it more quickly than most other people. But beyond this\nineffable difference (which often spells the difference between competence and\ngenius), riding a bike, sailing, fishing, shearing sheep, and so on can be\nlearned through practice. Since every road, wind, stream, and sheep is\ndifferent and continually changing, the best practitioner, like Odysseus, will\nhave had experience under many different conditions. If your life depended on\nyour ship coming through rough weather, you would surely prefer a successful\ncaptain with long experience to, say, a brilliant physicist who had analyzed\nthe natural laws of sailing but who had never actually sailed a vessel.\n\nThose specialists who deal with emergencies and disasters are also exemplary\nof metis. Firefighters, rescue squads, paramedics, minedisaster teams, doctors\nin hospital emergency rooms, crews that repair downed electrical lines, teams\nthat extinguish fires in oil fields, and, as we shall see, farmers and\npastoralists in precarious environments must respond quickly and decisively to\nlimit damage and save lives. Although there are rules of thumb that can be and\nare taught, each fire or accident is unique, and half the battle is knowing\nwhich rules of thumb to apply in which order and when to throw the book away\nand improvise.\n\nRed Adair's team, which has been hired worldwide to cap wellhead fires, was a\nstriking and diagnostic case. Before the Gulf War of 1990, his was the only\nteam with any appreciable \"clinical\" experience, and he could set his own\nprice. Each fire presented new problems and required an inspired mixture of\nexperience and improvisation. We can imagine, at almost opposite ends of a\nspectrum, Adair on one hand and a minor clerk performing highly repetitive\nsteps on the other. Adair's job cannot, by definition, be reduced to a\nroutine. He must begin with the unpredictable-an accident, a fire-and then\ndevise the techniques and equipment (from an existing repertoire, to be sure,\nbut one invented largely by him) required to extinguish that fire and cap that\nwell. 10 The clerk, by contrast, deals with a predictable, routinized\nenvironment that can often be ordered in advance and down to the smallest\ndetail. Adair cannot simplify his environment in order to apply a cookie-\ncutter solution.\n\nThe examples thus far introduced have been mostly concerned with the relation\nbetween people and their physical environment. But metis equally applies to\nhuman interaction. Think of the complex physical activities that require\nconstant adjustment to the movement, values, desires, or gestures of others.\nBoxing, wrestling, and fencing require instant, quasi-automatic responses to\nan opponent's moves, which can be learned only through long practice of the\nactivity itself. Here the element of deception enters as well. The successful\nboxer will learn to feint a move in order to provoke a response of which he\ncan then take advantage. If we move from physical contests to such cooperative\nactivities as dancing, music, or lovemaking, a similar practiced\nresponsiveness born of experience is essential. Many sports combine both the\ncooperative and the competitive aspects of metis. A soccer player must learn\nnot only the moves of his or her teammates but also which team moves and fakes\nwill deceive their opponents. Such skills, it is important to note, are both\ngeneric and particular; while each player may be more or less skilled at\ndifferent facets of the game, each team has its particular combination of\nskills, its \"chemistry,\" and each contest with an opposing team represents a\nchallenge that is in some ways unique.\"\n\nOn a much bigger, higher-stakes canvas, war diplomacy and politics more\ngenerally are metis-laden skills. The successful practitioner, in each case,\ntries to shape the behavior of partners and opponents to his own ends. Unlike\nthe sailor, who can adjust to the wind and the waves but not influence them\ndirectly, the general and the politician are in constant interaction with\ntheir counterparts, each of whom is trying to outfox the other. Adapting\nquickly and well to unpredictable events-both natural events, such as the\nweather, and human events, such as the enemy's move-and making the best out of\nlimited resources are the kinds of skills that are hard to teach as cut-and-\ndried disciplines.\n\nThe necessarily implicit, experiential nature of metis seems central. A simple\nexperiment in implicit learning conducted by the philosopher Charles Peirce\nmay help to convey something of the process. Peirce had people lift two\nweights and judge which of the two was heavier. At first, their discrimination\nwas rather crude. But as they practiced for long periods, they became able to\ndistinguish accurately quite minute differences in weight. They could not\npinpoint what it was that they sensed or felt, but their actual capacity to\ndiscriminate grew enormously. Peirce took the results as evidence for a kind\nof subliminal communication via \"faint sensations\" between people. For our\npurposes, however, it illustrates a rudimentary kind of knowledge that can be\nacquired only by practice and that all but defies being communicated in\nwritten or oral form apart from actual practice.\"\n\nSurveying the range of examples that we have touched on, we can venture some\npreliminary generalizations about the nature of metis and about where it is\nrelevant. Metis is most applicable to broadly sim ilar but never precisely\nidentical situations requiring a quick and practiced adaptation that becomes\nalmost second nature to the practitioner. The skills of metis may well involve\nrules of thumb, but such rules are largely acquired through practice (often in\nformal apprenticeship) and a developed feel or knack for strategy. Metis\nresists simplification into deductive principles which can successfully be\ntransmitted through book learning, because the environments in which it is\nexercised are so complex and nonrepeatable that formal procedures of rational\ndecision making are impossible to apply. In a sense, metis lies in that large\nspace between the realm of genius, to which no formula can apply, and the\nrealm of codified knowledge, which can be learned by rote.\n\n##### The Art of the Locality\n\nWhy are the rules of thumb that can be derived from any skilled craft still\nwoefully inadequate to its practice? Artists or cooks, Michael Oakeshott has\nnoted, may in fact write about their art and try to boil it down to technical\nknowledge, but what they write represents not much of what they know but\nrather only that small part of their knowledge that can be reduced to\nexposition. Knowing a craft's shorthand rules is a very long way from its\naccomplished performance: \"These rules and principles are mere abridgements of\nthe activity itself; they do not exist in advance of the activity, they cannot\nproperly be said to govern it and they cannot provide the impetus of the\nactivity. A complete mastery of the principles may exist alongside a complete\ninability to pursue the activity to which they refer, for the pursuit of the\nactivity does not consist in the application of these principles; and even if\nit did, the knowledge of how to apply them (the knowledge of actually pursuing\nthe activity) is not given in a knowledge of them.\"\"\n\nKnowing how and when to apply the rules of thumb in a concrete situation is\nthe essence of metis. The subtleties of application are important precisely\nbecause metis is most valuable in settings that are mutable, indeterminant\n(some facts are unknown), and particular. 14 Although we shall return to the\nquestion of indeterminacy and change, here I want to explore further the\nlocalness and particularity of metis.\n\nIn seamanship, the difference between the more general knowledge of navigation\nand the more particular knowledge of piloting is instructive. When a large\nfreighter or passenger liner approaches a major port, the captain typically\nturns the control of his vessel over to a local pilot, who brings it into the\nharbor and to its berth. The same procedure is followed when the ship leaves\nits berth until it is safely out into the sealanes. This sensible procedure,\ndesigned to avoid accidents, reflects the fact that navigation on the open sea\n(a more \"abstract\" space) is the more general skill, while piloting a ship\nthrough traffic in a particular port is a highly contextual skill. We might\ncall the art of piloting a \"local and situated knowledge.\" What the pilot\nknows are local tides and currents along the coast and estuaries, the unique\nfeatures of local wind and wave patterns, shifting sandbars, unmarked reefs,\nseasonal changes in microcurrents, local traffic conditions, the daily\nvagaries of wind patterns off headlands and along straits, how to pilot in\nthese waters at night, not to mention how to bring many different ships safely\nto berth under variable conditions. 'I Such knowledge is particular, by\ndefinition; it can be acquired only by local practice and experience. Like a\nbird or an insect that has adapted brilliantly to a narrow ecological niche,\nthe pilot knows one harbor. Much of his knowledge would be irrelevant if he\nwere suddenly transposed to a different port.',, Despite the rather narrow\ncontext of this knowledge, it is agreed by captains, harbormasters, and, not\nleast, those who insure maritime commerce against losses that the pilot's\nknowledge of a particular port must prevail. The pilot's experience is locally\nsuperior to the general rules of navigation.\n\nMark Twain's classic Life on the Mississippi reflects at great length on the\nknowledge acquired by riverboat pilots. Part of that knowledge consists of\nrules of thumb about surface features that may signal shallows, currents, or\nother navigational hazards. Much of it, however, consists of a quite specific\nfamiliarity with their particular stretch of the Mississippi at different\nseasons and water levels-knowledge that could have been gained in that\nparticular place only through experience. Although there is something that\nmight properly be called a knowledge of rivers in general, it is a quite thin\nand unsatisfactory knowledge when it comes to making a particular trip on a\nparticular river. A native pilot is no less necessary on a given river than a\nnative tracker for a given jungle or a local guide in Bruges or in the medina\nof an ancient Arab city.\n\nThe practice and experience reflected in metis is almost always local. Thus a\nguide on mountain climbing may be best at Zermatt, which she has scaled often;\nan airplane pilot best on Boeing 747s, on which he was trained; and the\northopedic surgeon best at knees, where her surgical experience has given her\na certain expertise. It is not entirely clear how much of these experts' metis\nwould be transferable if they were suddenly shifted to Mont Blanc, DC3s, and\nhands.\n\nEvery instance of the application of a given skill will require specific\nadjustments for local conditions. For a weaver, each new supply of yarn or\nthread handles differently. For a potter, a new supply of clay \"works\"\ndifferently. Long experience with different materials will have the effect of\nmaking such adjustments quasi-automatic. The specificity of knowledge goes\neven deeper, in the sense that each loom or potter's wheel has its own\ndistinctive qualities, which an artisan comes to know and appreciate (or work\naround). Every general knowledge that is actually applied, then, requires some\nimaginative translation. A consummate knowledge of looms in general does not\ntranslate directly into the successful operation of this particular loom with\nits peculiarities of design, use, woods, and repairs. To speak of the art of\none loom, the art of one river, the art of one tractor, or the art of one\nautomobile is not preposterous; it is to point to the size and importance of\nthe gap between general knowledge and situated knowledge.\n\nWe might reasonably think of situated, local knowledge as being partisan\nknowledge as opposed to generic knowledge. That is, the holder of such\nknowledge typically has a passionate interest in a particular outcome. An\ninsurer of commercial shipping for a large, highly capitalized maritime firm\ncan afford to rely on probability distributions for accidents. But for a\nsailor or captain hoping for a safe voyage, it is the outcome of the single\nevent, a single trip, that matters. Metis is the ability and experience\nnecessary to influence the outcome-to improve the odds-in a particular\ninstance.\n\nThe state simplifications and utopian schemes we have examined in earlier\nchapters all concern activities that are carried out in spatially and\ntemporally unique settings. While something can indeed be said about forestry,\nrevolution, urban planning, agriculture, and rural settlement in general, this\nwill take us only so far in understanding this forest, this revolution, this\nfarm. All farming takes place in a unique space (fields, soil, crops) and at a\nunique time (weather pattern, season, cycle in pest populations) and for\nunique ends (this family with its needs and tastes). A mechanical application\nof generic rules that ignores these particularities is an invitation to\npractical failure, social disillusionment, or most likely both. The generic\nformula does not and cannot supply the local knowledge that will allow a\nsuccessful translation of the necessarily crude general understandings to\nsuccessful, nuanced, local applications. The more general the rules, the more\nthey require in the way of translation if they are to be locally successful.\nNor is it simply a matter of the captain or navigator realizing at what point\nhis rules of thumb are inferior to the intimate local knowledge of the pilot.\nRather, it is a matter of recognizing that the rules of thumb themselves are\nlargely a codification derived from the actual practices of sailing and\npiloting.\n\nOne last analogy may help to clarify the relationship between gen eral rules\nof thumb and metis. Metis is not merely the specification of local values\n(such as the local mean temperature and rainfall) made in order to\nsuccessfully apply a generic formula to a local case. Taking language as a\nparallel, I believe that the rule of thumb is akin to formal grammar, whereas\nmetis is more like actual speech. Metis is no more derivative of general rules\nthan speech is derivative of grammar. Speech develops from the cradle by\nimitation, use, trial and error. Learning a mother tongue is a stochastic\nprocess-a process of successive, selfcorrecting approximations. We do not\nbegin by learning the alphabet, individual words, parts of speech, and rules\nof grammar and then trying to use them all in order to produce a grammatically\ncorrect sentence. Moreover, as Oakeshott indicates, a knowledge of the rules\nof speech by themselves is compatible with a complete inability to speak\nintelligible sentences. The assertion that the rules of grammar are derivative\nof the practice of actual speech is nearer to the truth. Modern language\ntraining that aims at competence in speaking recognizes this and begins with\nsimple speech and rote repetition in order to imprint pattern and accent while\nleaving the rules of grammar implicit, or else introducing them later as a way\nof codifying and summarizing practical mastery.\n\nLike language, the metis or local knowledge necessary to the successful\npractice of farming or pastoralism is probably best learned by daily practice\nand experience. Like serving a long apprenticeship, growing up in a household\nwhere that craft is continually practiced often represents the most\nsatisfactory preparation for its exercise. This kind of socialization to a\ntrade may favor the conservation of skills rather than daring innovation. But\nany formula that excludes or suppresses the experience, knowledge, and\nadaptability of metis risks incoherence and failure; learning to speak\ncoherent sentences involves far more than merely learning the rules of\ngrammar.\n\n##### The Relation with Episteme and Techne\n\nFor the Greeks and particularly for Plato, episteme and techne represented\nknowledge of an order completely different from metis.\" Technical knowledge,\nor techne, could be expressed precisely and comprehensively in the form of\nhard-and-fast rules (not rules of thumb), principles, and propositions. At its\nmost rigorous, techne is based on logical deduction from self-evident first\nprinciples. As an ideal type, it radically differs from metis in terms of how\nit is organized, how it is codified and taught, how it is modified, and the\nanalytical precision it exhibits.\n\nWhere metis is contextual and particular, techne is universal. In the logic of\nmathematics, ten multiplied by ten equals one hundred everywhere and forever;\nin Euclidean geometry, a right angle represents ninety degrees of a circle; in\nthe conventions of physics, the freezing point of water is always zero degrees\ncentigrade.'\" Techne is settled knowledge; Aristotle wrote that techne \"came\ninto being when from many notions gained from experience, a universal\njudgement about a group of similar things arises.\" The universality of techne\narises from the fact that it is organized analytically into small, explicit,\nlogical steps and is both decomposable and verifiable. This universality means\nthat knowledge in the form of techne can be taught more or less completely as\na formal discipline. The rules of techne provide for theoretical knowledge\nthat may or may not have practical applications. Finally, techne is\ncharacterized by impersonal, often quantitative precision and a concern with\nexplanation and verification, whereas metis is concerned with personal skill,\nor \"touch,\" and practical results.\n\nIf the description of techne as an ideal or typical system of knowledge\nresembles the self-image of modern science, that is no accident. The actual\npractice of science, however, is something else again.20 The rules of techne\nare the specification of how knowledge is to be codified, expressed, and\nverified, once it has been discovered. No rules of techne or episteme can\nexplain scientific invention and insight. Discovering a mathematical theorem\nrequires genius and perhaps metis; the proof of the theorem, however, must\nfollow the tenets of techne.21 Thus the systematic and impersonal rules of\ntechne facilitate the production of knowledge that can be readily assembled,\ncomprehensively documented, and formally taught, but they cannot by themselves\nadd to that knowledge or explain how it came into being.22\n\nTechne is characteristic, above all, of self-contained systems of reasoning in\nwhich the findings may be logically derived from the initial assumptions. To\nthe degree that the form of knowledge satisfies these conditions, to that\ndegree is it impersonal, universal, and completely impervious to context. But\nthe context of metis, as Detienne and Vernant emphasize, is characteristically\n\"situations which are transient, shifting, disconcerting and ambiguous,\nsituations which do not lend themselves to precise measurement, exact\ncalculation, or rigorous logic.\"23 Nussbaum shows convincingly how Plato\nattempted, especially in the Republic, to transform the realm of love-a realm\nthat almost by definition is one of contingency, desire, and impulse-into a\nrealm of techne or episteme.24 Plato regarded mundane love as subject to the\nlower appetites, and he hoped to purge it of these base instincts so that it\ncould more closely resemble the philosopher's pure search for truth. The\nsuperiority of pure reasoning, especially scientific and mathematical logic,\nlay in the fact that it was \"pure of pain, maximally stable, and directed at\nthe truth.\" The objects of such reasoning \"are eternally what they are\nregardless of what human beings do and say.\"25 What one loved, or should love,\nPlato claimed, was not the beloved himself but rather the pure forms of\nunalloyed beauty reflected in the beloved.21, Only in this way could love\nremain straight and rational, free of the appetites.\n\nThe spheres of human endeavor that are freest of contingency, guesswork,\ncontext, desire, and personal experience-and thus free of metis-hence came to\nbe perceived as man's highest pursuits. They are the philosopher's work. One\ncan see why, on the strength of such criteria, Euclidean geometry,\nmathematics, some self-contained forms of analytical philosophy, and perhaps\nmusic are considered to be among the purest of pursuits.2' Unlike the natural\nsciences and concrete experiments, these disciplines exist as realms of pure\nthought, untouched by the contingencies of the material world. They begin in\nthe mind or on a blank sheet of paper. The Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2,\nis true for all right triangles everywhere and forever.\n\nA recurrent theme of Western philosophy and science, including social science,\nhas been the attempt to reformulate systems of knowledge in order to bracket\nuncertainty and thereby permit the kind of logical deductive rigor possessed\nby Euclidean geometry.-'\" In the natural sciences, the results have been\nrevolutionary. Where philosophy and the human sciences are concerned, the\nefforts have been just as persistent but the results far more ambiguous.\nDescartes's famous episteme \"I think, therefore I am\" mimicked the first step\nin a mathematical proof and was an \"answer to the disorder that threatened to\nundo society. \"22 The aim of Jeremy Bentham and the utilitarians was, through\ntheir calculus of pleasure and pain (hedonism), to reduce the study of ethics\nto a pure natural science, to an examination of \"every circumstance by which\nan individual can be influenced, being remarked and inventoried, nothing ...\nleft to chance, caprice, or unguided discretion, everything being surveyed and\nset down in dimension, number, weight, and measure.\" 30\n\nEven chance (tuche) itself, which techne was designed to master, was\neventually, thanks to statistics and probability theory, transformed into a\nsingular fact that might enter the formulas of techne. Risk, providing it\ncould be assigned a known probability, became a fact like any other, whereas\nuncertainty (where the underlying probabilities are not known) still lay\noutside techne's reach.31 The intellectual \"career\" of risk and uncertainty is\nindicative of many fields of inquiry in which the realm of analysis was\nreformulated and narrowed to exclude elements that could not be quantified and\nmeasured but could only be judged. Better put, techniques were devised to\nisolate and domesticate those aspects of key variables that might be expressed\nin numbers (a nation's wealth by gross national product, public opinion by\npoll numbers, values by psychological inventories). Neoclassical economics,\nfor example, has undergone a transformation along these lines. Consumer\npreferences are first taken as a given and then counted, in order to bracket\ntaste as a major source of uncertainty. Invention and entrepreneurial activity\nare treated as exogenous and cast outside the perimeter of the discipline as\ntoo intractable to submit to measurement and prediction.32 The discipline has\nincorporated calculable risk while exiling those topics where genuine\nuncertainty prevails (ecological dangers, shifts in taste).33 As Stephen\nMarglin shows, \"the emphasis on self-interest, calculation, and maximization\nin economics\" are classical examples of \"selfevident postulates\" and reflect\n\"more an ideological commitment to the superiority of episteme than a serious\nattempt to unravel the complexities and mysteries of human motivation and\nbehavior.\"34\n\nThe logic of such reformulations is analogous to the experimental practice and\nself-imposed boundaries of modern scientific agriculture. By constricting its\nfield of inquiry, it gained enormously in precision and scientific power at\nthe possible expense of irrelevance or unpleasant surprises from beyond its\nartificial perimeters.35 Techne is most suitable to activities \"that have a\nsingular end or goal, an end that is specifiable apart from the activity\nitself, and one susceptible to quantitative measurement.\"36 Thus the problem\nmost successfully addressed by scientific agriculture is how to grow the\nlargest number of bushels of a crop at the least cost per acre, as revealed\nthrough one-variable-at-atime trials conducted on experimental plots. Issues\nof farming life and community, family needs, long-term soil structure,\necological diversity, and sustainability are either difficult to incorporate\nor excluded altogether. Formulas of efficiency, production functions, and\nrational action are specifiable only when the ends sought are simple, sharply\ndefined, and hence measurable.\n\nThe problem, as Aristotle recognized, is that certain practical choices\ncannot, \"even in principle, be adequately and completely captured in a system\nof universal rules.\"37 He singled out navigation and medicine as two\nactivities in which the practical wisdom of long experience is indispensable\nto superior performance. They were metis-laden activities in which\nresponsiveness, improvisation, and skillful, successive approximations were\nrequired. If Plato can be credited, Socrates deliberately refrained from\nwriting down his teachings, because he believed that the activity of\nphilosophy belonged more to metis than to episteme or techne. A written text,\neven if it takes the form of a philosophical dialogue, is a cut-and-dried set\nof codified rules. An oral dialogue, by contrast, is alive and responsive to\nthe mutuality of the participants, reaching a destination that cannot be\nspecified in advance. Socrates evidently believed that the interaction between\nteacher and students that we now call the Socratic method, and not the\nresulting text, is philosophy.'\"\n\n##### Practical Knowledge Versus Scientific Explanation\n\nOnly by grasping the potential achievement and range of metis is it possible\nto appreciate the valuable knowledge that high-modernist schemes deprive\nthemselves of when they simply impose their plans. One major reason why metis\nis denigrated, particularly in the hegemonic imperium of scientific knowledge,\nis that its \"findings\" are practical, opportune, and contextual rather than\nintegrated into the general conventions of scientific discourse.\n\nWe have seen the idiosyncracies of metis at work in the historical vernaculars\nof measurement of area, weight, and volume. The aim was always to achieve a\nlocal purpose or to express an important local feature (such as \"a farm of two\ncows\") rather than to accommodate some universal unit of measurement. Like\nSquanto's maxim, such vernacular measures apparently often conveyed more\ninformation than an abstract measure could. They certainly conveyed\ninformation that was more locally relevant. It was just this local, practical\nindex, which varied from place to place, that ensured that metis would be\nconfusing, incoherent, and unassimilable for purposes of statecraft.\n\nThe classification of flora follows much the same logic among indigenous\npeople. What matters is local use and value. Thus the categories into which\nvarious plants are sorted follow a logic of practical use: good for making\nsoup, good for making twine, helpful in healing cuts, effective for settling\nan upset stomach, poisonous for cattle, useful for weaving our cloth, favored\nby rabbits as food, good for making fences, and so on. This knowledge is never\nstatic, however; it is constantly being expanded through practical\nexperimentation. And the categories into which floral reality is divided are\nclearly not the occasionally invisible Linnaean botanical categories favored\nby scientific researchers.39\n\nThe litmus test for metis is practical success. Did the navigator make the\ntrip safely? Did Odysseus's stratagems outwit the Cyclops? Did the poultice\ncure the boil? Was the farmer's harvest abundant? If a technique works\neffectively and repeatedly for the purpose intended, the practitioners of\nmetis do not pause long to ask why and how it worked, to define the precise\nmechanism of cause and effect. Their intent is not to contribute to a wider\nbody of knowledge but to solve the concrete problems they face. This does not\nmean that the practitioners of metis do not invent new solutions. They most\ndecidedly do. Until quite recently virtually all the improvements in\nagriculture have come from the field rather than from industry or science.\nWhat it does mean, however, is that the innovations of metis will typically\nrepresent a recombination (bricolage, to use Levi-Strauss's term)40 of\nexisting elements; farmers did not invent the tractor to solve their problems\nof traction power .41 By the same token, the bricolage of practical knowledge\nhas often produced complex techniques-such as polycropping and soil-building\nstrategies-that work admirably but that science has not (yet?) understood.\n\nThe power of practical knowledge depends on an exceptionally close and astute\nobservation of the environment. It should by now be rather obvious why\ntraditional cultivators like Squanto are such consummate observers of their\nenvironment, but the reasons bear repeating in the context of a comparison\nwith scientific knowledge. First, these cultivators have a vital, direct stake\nin the results of close observation. Unlike the research scientist or\nextension agent who does not have to take her own advice, the peasant is the\nimmediate consumer of his own conclusions. Unlike the typical modern-day\nfarmer, the peasant has no outside experts to rely on beyond his experienced\nneighbors; he must make decisions based on what he knows.\n\nSecond, the poverty or marginal economic status of many of these cultivators\nis itself, I would argue, a powerful impetus to careful observation and\nexperimentation. Consider the hypothetical case of two fishermen, both of whom\nmust make their living from a river. One fisherman lives by a river where the\ncatch is stable and abundant. The other lives by a river where the catch is\nvariable and sparse, affording only a bare and precarious subsistence. The\npoorer of the two will clearly have an immediate, life-and-death interest in\ndevising new fishing techniques, in observing closely the habits of fish, in\nthe careful siting of traps and weirs, in the timing and signs of seasonal\nruns of different species, and so forth.\n\nNor should we forget that the peasant cultivator or pastoralist lives year in\nand year out in the field of observation. He or she will likely know things\nthat neither an absentee cultivator nor a research scientist would ever\nnotice.42 Finally, as mentioned in the previous chapter, such a cultivator is\nalways a member of a community that serves as a living, oral reference library\nfor observations, practices, and experiments-a body of knowledge that an\nindividual could never amass alone.\n\nThe experimental temper of \"prescientific\" peoples, often impelled by mortal\nthreats, resulted in many important, efficacious discoveries. South American\nIndians discovered that chewing the bark of the cinchona tree was an effective\nremedy for malaria, without knowing that its active ingredient was quinine or\nwhy it worked. Westerners knew that certain foods consumed in the early\nspring, such as rhubarb, could relieve the symptoms of wintertime scurvy,\nwithout knowing anything about Vitamin C. The mold from certain breads was\nused to stem infections long before the isolation of penicillin.43 According\nto Anil Gupta, roughly three-quarters of the modern pharmacopoeia are\nderivatives of traditionally known medicines.44 Even in the absence of\nremedies, people often knew what measures would lessen their chances of\ncontracting a dreaded contagious disease. The Londoners in Daniel Defoe's\nJournal of the Plague Year knew that moving to the country or, failing that,\nsealing oneself up in one's rooms vastly improved one's chances of surviving\nthe bubonic plague of 1665.45 Knowing, as we now do, that the vectors of the\nplague were the fleas carried by rats, we can appreciate why these strategies\noften worked, but Defoe's contemporaries hit on these effective solutions even\nthough they thought that the plague was caused by vapors.\n\nA most striking illustration of practice preceding science is the widespread\nuse of variolation to check the spread of smallpox long before Sir William\nJenner's heralded development of vaccination in 1798. The story, which\nFrederique Apffel Marglin analyzes in impressive detail, is valuable because\nit demonstrates how purely metis skills led to a form of inoculation that\nmimicked or presaged what is justifiably seen as a great milestone in\nscientific medicine.41' Let me make it clear that the last thing I intend here\nis a defense of traditional medicine visa-vis modern medical research and\nexperimental method.47 What this account does highlight, however, is how\nfrequently local knowledge, trial and error, or what we might more generously\ncall the stochastic method have produced practical solutions without benefit\nof scientific method.\n\nBy at least the sixteenth century, the technique of variolation was widely\npracticed in India, the Middle East, Europe, and China. The practice consisted\nof using human smallpox matter, scratched into the skin or inhaled, which gave\nthe recipient a mild, rarely fatal case of smallpox. \"Fresh\" smallpox matter-\nfrom the pustules or scabs of someone with an active infection contracted in\nthe usual way-was never used. The inoculation was typically made with\nattenuated matter saved from those who had had mild cases during last year's\nepidemic or with matter taken from the pustules of those who had been inocu\nlated the previous year. Dosage could be regulated according to the size and\nage of the patient.\n\nThe principle behind variolation, the same principle that forms the basis of\nhomeopathy, reflected a much older practice. Inoculation in one form or\nanother was widely practiced well before the rise of modern medicine. In\nIndia, variolation was carried out by ritual specialists and was thoroughly\nintegrated with the worship of the goddess Sithala.41 In other societies, its\ncultural setting was no doubt different, although the actual procedures were\nremarkably parallel.\n\nJenner's discovery of vaccination using cowpox matter was therefore not\nentirely novel. A young girl had told him that she was protected against\nsmallpox because she had already had cowpox. Jenner, following this lead,\ninoculated his own children with cowpox matter and observed that they showed\nno reaction to a subsequent smallpox vaccination. Vaccination was, of course,\na great advance over variolation. Because it used live smallpox matter,\nvariolation induced a mild but active case that was contagious, and I to 3\npercent of those so treated died from the treatment, a ratio that nonetheless\ncompared favorably with the one or two in six who perished in an epidemic.\nJenner's technique used killed virus, thus avoiding contagion, and his\nvaccination had a remarkably low iatrogenic rate: only one in a thousand died\nof the vaccination itself. His achievement is rightly celebrated, but it is\nimportant to recognize that \"Jennerian vaccination was not an abrupt break\nwith the past, but the direct descendant and heir of inoculation.\"49\n\nVariolation, though hardly to be preferred to vaccination, was an impressive\naccomplishment of practical prescientific medicine. The principle of\ninoculation had long been grasped, and, one imagines, a great many\npractitioners in affected communities were trying to develop a successful\ntechnique. Once the efficacy of a new treatment was established, the news must\nhave traveled faster than any epidemic and quickly displaced less successful\npreventative measures. There is no magic here. The ingredients of such\npractical knowledge are simple: a pressing need (in this case, a matter\nliterally of life and death), a few promising leads that worked in analogous\ncontexts (inoculation), a vast army of freelance experimenters willing to try\nalmost anything,50 time to \"simmer\" (as the experimenters and their clients\nobserved the results of various stratagems through successive epidemics), and\nthe sharing (through chains of communication) of the experimental results. As\nlong as it didn't require an electron microscope, it would in fact be\nsurprising if such a combination of passionate interest, close observation,\nlarge numbers of amateur specialists trying different pos sibilities, and the\ntime necessary for trial and error did not produce many novel solutions to\npractical problems. The variolators before Jenner were not unlike the\npolycropping cultivators described by Paul Richards. They had devised, not\njust stumbled upon, something that worked, without quite knowing exactly why\nit worked. While this increased their risk of drawing false inferences from\nwhat they saw, it did not diminish the practical achievements of their\nbricolage.\n\nMetis, with the premium it places on practical knowledge, experience, and\nstochastic reasoning, is of course not merely the now-superseded precursor of\nscientific knowledge. It is the mode of reasoning most appropriate to complex\nmaterial and social tasks where the uncertainties are so daunting that we must\ntrust our (experienced) intuition and feel our way. Albert Howard's\ndescription of water management in Japan offers an instructive example:\n\"Erosion control in Japan is like a game of chess. The forest engineer, after\nstudying his eroding valley, makes his first move, locating and building one\nor more check dams. He waits to see what Nature's response is. This determines\nthe forest engineer's next move, which may be another dam or two, an increase\nin the former dam, or the construction of side retaining walls. Another pause\nfor observation, the next move is made, and so on, until erosion is\ncheckmated. The operations of natural forces, such as sedimentation and re-\nvegetation, are guided and used to the best advantage to keep down costs and\nto obtain practical results. No more is attempted than Nature has already done\nin the region.\"\" The engineer in Howard's account recognizes implicitly that\nhe is dealing with \"an art of one valley.\" Each prudent, small step, based on\nprior experience, yields new and not completely predictable effects that\nbecome the point of departure for the next step. Virtually any complex task\ninvolving many variables whose values and interactions cannot be accurately\nforecast belongs to this genre: building a house, repairing a car, perfecting\na new jet engine, surgically repairing a knee, or farming a plot of land.SZ\nWhere the interactions involve not just the material environment but social\ninteraction as well-building and peopling new villages or cities, organizing a\nrevolutionary seizure of power, or collectivizing agriculture-the mind boggles\nat the multitude of interactions and uncertainties (as distinct from\ncalculable risks).\n\nMore than thirty-five years ago, in recognition of the refractory complexity\nof ambitious social policy, Charles Lindblom coined the memorable expression\n\"the science of muddling through.\"\" The phrase was meant to capture the spirit\nof a practical approach to large-scale policy problems that could not be\ncompletely understood, let alone comprehensively addressed. Models of public\nadministration, Lind blom complained, implicitly assumed a synoptic mastery of\na policy initiative, when in practice, knowledge was both limited and\nfragmentary, and means could never be neatly separated from goals. His\ncharacterization of actual policy practice emphasized a piecemeal approach of\nlimited comparisons, a sequence of trials and errors followed by revised\ntrials, reliance on past experience, and \"disjointed in- crementalism.\"S4\nAlbert Hirschman has made the same point, rather more metaphorically, by\ncomparing social policy to house building: \"The architect of social change can\nnever have a reliable blueprint. Not only is each house he builds different\nfrom any other that was built before, but it necessarily uses new construction\nmaterials and even experiments with untested principles of stress and\nstructure. Therefore what can be most usefully conveyed by the builders of one\nhouse is an understanding of the experience that made it at all possible to\nbuild under these trying circumstances. 15\n\nTaken together, Lindblom's and Hirschman's positions amount to a well-reasoned\nstrategic retreat from the ambition to comprehensive, rational planning. If we\ncan make allowances for the social-science jargon, the concepts behind such\nterms as \"bounded rationality\" (rather than \"synoptic mastery\") and\n\"satisficing\" (rather than \"maximizing\"), terms invented to describe a world\nworking by educated guesswork and rules of thumb, sound very much like metis.\n\n##### Learning Beyond the Book\n\nA step-by-step \"muddling through\" approach would seem to be the only prudent\ncourse in a field like erosion management or public policy implementation,\nwhere surprises are all but guaranteed. The fact that in these cases the level\nof uncertainty and hence of potential disaster can be reduced by breaking down\nthe process into more manageable steps does not imply that any novice could\nthen take charge. On the contrary, only someone with wide experience will be\nable to interpret the results of and reactions to an initial step in order to\ndetermine the next step. One would want hydrologists and policy managers who\nhad been surprised many times and have had many successes behind them. Their\nrepertoire of responses would be larger, their judgment in reading the\nenvironment surer, their sense of what surprises might await them more\naccurate. Once again, some of their competence could be interpreted and\ntaught, but much of it would remain implicit-a sixth sense that comes with\nlong practice. At the risk of trying to pinpoint the ineffable, I want to\nsuggest how important such knowledge is and how difficult it is to translate\nit into codified form.','\n\nMetis knowledge is often so implicit and automatic that its bearer is at a\nloss to explain it.57 A staple of early medical training, I have been told, is\nthe story of a physician who, at the turn of the century, had a spectacularly\nhigh success rate in diagnosing syphilis in its early stages. Laboratory tests\nconfirmed his diagnoses, but he himself did not know precisely what it was\nthat he detected in the physical exams that led him to his conclusions.\nIntrigued by his success, hospital administrators asked two other doctors to\nclosely observe his examination of patients over several weeks and to see if\nthey could spot what he was picking up. At long last, they and the doctor\nrealized that he was unconsciously registering the patients' slight eye\ntremor. The eye tremor then became a universally recognized symptom of\nsyphilis. Although this insight could be codified, what is instructive here is\nthat it could have been achieved only through close observation and long\nclinical experience and that, even before then, it could have been known\nsubliminally.\n\nAny experienced practitioner of a skill or craft will develop a large\nrepertoire of moves, visual judgments, a sense of touch, or a discriminating\ngestalt for assessing the work as well as a range of accurate intuitions born\nof experience that defy being communicated apart from practice. A few brief\nexamples will help to convey the subtlety and nuance of this knowledge. In\nIndonesia, older Bugis sea captains, sound asleep below decks, will awaken the\nmoment there is a change in direction, weather, current, or some combination\nof the three. As the ocean's waves change amplitude or begin striking the ship\nfrom a different direction, a captain immediately senses the change through\nthe resulting slight alterations in the roll and pitch of the ship.\n\nIn the days when a case of diphtheria in town was still an occasion for\nquarantining the patient at home, a doctor was taking a young medical student\nalong with him on his rounds. When they had been admitted to the front hall of\na quarantined house but before they had seen the patient, the older man paused\nand said, \"Stop. Smell the odor! Never forget this smell; this is the smell of\na house with diphtheria .\"51 Another doctor once told me that, after seeing\nthousands of infants at a busy clinic, he believed that he could tell with a\nhigh degree of accuracy, just by looking, whether an infant was seriously ill\nand needed immediate attention. He couldn't quite put his finger on the exact\nvisual cue that informed his judgment, but he supposed that it was some\ncombination of complexion, the expression of the eyes, body tone, and\nanimation. Albert Howard once again makes a persuasive case for the \"practiced\neye\": \"An experienced farmer can tell the health of the soil and the quality\nof the humus by the plants-their vigor, their growth, the profuse roots, the\n'glow' of health.... The same is true for the health of animals on good land.\"\nIndeed, he continues, \"it is not necessary to weigh or measure them. A glance\non the part of the successful grazier, or a butcher accustomed to deal with\nhigh class animals, is sufficient to tell him whether all is well or whether\nthere is something wrong with the soil or the management of the animals, or\nboth.\"59\n\nWhat is the status of such insight or intuition? We might call these skills\nthe \"tricks of the trade\" (in the nondeceptive sense) that most \"crafty\"\npractitioners acquire.60 Notice that virtually all the experienced judgments\ndescribed in these anecdotes could be verified by tests and measurements.\nDiphtheria can be detected in the laboratory, a child's anemia can be verified\nby blood tests, and the Bugis sea captain can go on deck to confirm the shift\nin the wind. It is doubtless reassuring to those who have both the intuition\nand access to formal measurement to know that their judgment can be checked.\nBut the epistemic alternative to metis is far slower, more laborious, more\ncapital intensive, and not always decisive. When rapid judgments of high (not\nperfect) accuracy are called for, when it is important to interpret early\nsigns that things are going well or poorly, then there is no substitute for\nmetis. In the case of the experienced doctor, in fact, it is metis that\ninforms a decision about whether tests are needed and, if so, which tests.\n\nEven the part of metis that can be conveyed by rules of thumb is the\ncodification of practical experience. The boiling down of maple sap into syrup\nis a tricky business. If one goes too far, the sap will boil over. The\nstopping point can be determined by a thermometer or by a hydrometer (which\nindicates specific gravity). But those with experience look for the mass of\nsmall bubbles that forms on the surface of the sap just before it begins to\nboil over- a visual rule of thumb that is far easier to use. Achieving the\ninsight, however, requires that, at least once, the syrup maker make a mistake\nand go too far. Chinese recipes, it has always amused me, often contain the\nfollowing instruction: \"Heat the oil until it is almost smoking.\" The recipes\nassume that the cook has made enough mistakes to know what oil looks like just\nbefore it begins smoking. The rule of thumb for maple syrup and for oil are,\nby definition, the rules of experience.\n\nThose who do not have access to scientific methods and laboratory verification\nhave often relied on metis to develop rich knowledge systems that are\nremarkably accurate. Traditional navigation skills before the eras of\nsextants, magnetic compasses, charts, and sonar are a case in point. I refer\nagain to the Bugis in this context, because their skills have been so\nbrilliantly documented by Gene Ammarell.61 In the absence of formal tide\ntables, the Bugis have elaborated a thoroughly reliable scheme for forecasting\nrising and falling tides, the direction of currents, and the relative strength\nof tides-all of which are vitally important to their sailing plans and\nsafety.\"' Calculating on the basis of time of day, the number of days into the\nlunar cycle, and the monsoon season, the Bugis captain holds in his head a\nsystem that provides all the accurate information he needs about tides. From\nan astronomer's perspective, it seems odd that the scheme makes no reference\nto the angle of declination of the moon. But since the monsoon is directly\nrelated to the declination of the moon, it serves effectively as a proxy. The\ncognitive map of the Bugis captain can be reconstructed in written form, as\nAmmarell has done, for illustrative purposes, but it was learned orally and by\ninformal apprenticeship among the Bugis. Given the complexity of the phenomena\nit is meant to address, the system for evaluating and predicting tides is\nelegantly simple and eminently effective.\n\n##### The Dynamism and Plasticity of Metis\n\nThe term \"traditional,\" as in \"traditional knowledge\"-a term that I have\ncarefully avoided-is a misnomer, sending all the wrong sig- nals.63 In the\nmid-nineteenth century, explorers in West Africa stumbled upon groups growing\nmaize, a New World grain, as their main staple. Although it was unlikely that\nthe West Africans had been growing maize for longer than two generations, its\ncultivation was already surrounded by elaborate rituals and myths about a\nmaize goddess or spirit who had given them the first kernels. What was\nstriking was both the alacrity with which they had adopted maize and the speed\nwith which they had integrated it into their traditions.64 The apparent spread\nof variolation across four continents is a further instance of how widely and\nhow rapidly \"traditional peoples\" will embrace techniques that solve vital\nproblems. Examples could be multiplied. Sewing machines, matches, flashlights,\nkerosene, plastic bowls, and antibiotics are only a tiny sample of the\nproducts that solved vital problems or eliminated great drudgery and were thus\nreadily accepted.,' Practical efficacy is, as we have noted, the key test of\nmetis knowledge, and all these products passed with flying colors.\n\nThe point that I am making would hardly need emphasis or elaborate\nillustration except for the fact that a certain understanding of science,\nmodernity, and development has so successfully structured the dominant\ndiscourse that all other kinds of knowledge are regarded as backward, static\ntraditions, as old wives' tales and superstitions. High modernism has needed\nthis \"other,\" this dark twin, in order to rhetorically present itself as the\nantidote to backwardness.°b The binary oppo sition also comes from a history\nof competition between the institutions and personnel that sprang up around\nthese two forms of knowledge. Modern research institutions, agricultural\nexperiment stations, sellers of fertilizer and machinery, high-modernist city\nplanners, Third World developers, and World Bank officials have, to a\nconsiderable degree, made their successful institutional way in the world by\nthe systematic denigration of the practical knowledge that we have called\nmetis.\n\nTheir characterization could not, in this context, be further from the truth.\nMetis, far from being rigid and monolithic, is plastic, local, and\ndivergent.61 It is in fact the idiosyncracies of metis, its contextualness,\nand its fragmentation that make it so permeable, so open to new ideas. Metis\nhas no doctrine or centralized training; each practitioner has his or her own\nangle. In economic terms, the market for metis is often one of nearly perfect\ncompetition, and local monopolies are likely to be broken by innovation from\nbelow and outside. If a new technique works, it is likely to find a clientele.\n\nIn his defense of traditionalism against rationalism, Michael Oakeshott\nemphasizes the pragmatism of real, existing traditions: \"The big mistake of\nthe rationalist-though it is not inherent in the method-is to assume that\n'tradition,' or what is better called 'practical knowledge,' is rigid, fixed\nand unchanging-in fact it is 'preeminently fluid.' \"61 Tradition, in part\nbecause of its local variation, is pliable and dynamic. \"No traditional way of\nbehavior, no traditional skill ever remains fixed,\" he says elsewhere. \"Its\nhistory is one of continual change.\"69 The changes are likely to be small and\ngradual (incrementalism) rather than sudden and discontinuous.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing the degree to which oral cultures, as opposed to\nwritten cultures, may avoid the rigidity of orthodoxy. Because an oral culture\nhas no textual reference point for marking deviations, its religious myths,\nrituals, and folklore are likely to drift. The tales and traditions currently\nin circulation vary with the speaker, the audience, and local needs. Having no\nyardstick like a sacred text to measure the degree of drift from its Ur-\ntradition, such a culture can change greatly over time and simultaneously\nthink of itself as remaining faithful to tradition.70\n\nPerhaps the best analogy for a society's stock of metis is its language. Yes,\nthere are rules of thumb for expression: cliches, formulas of politeness,\ncustoms for swearing, and conventional conversations. But unless there is a\ncentral committee of grammarians with draconian police powers, the language is\nalways being added to as new expressions and novel combinations are invented\nand puns and irony undermine old formulas. Under great pressure and rapid\nchange, the language may change rather dramatically and new hybrids arise, but\nfor the people who speak it, it remains recognizably their language. Influence\nover the direction of a language is never equally distributed, but innovation\ncomes from far and wide, and if others find a particular innovation useful or\napposite, they will adopt it as part of their language. In language as in\nmetis, seldom is the name of an innovator remembered, and this, too, helps to\nmake the result a joint, mutual product.\n\n#### The Social Context of Metis and Its Destruction\n\nWhile doing fieldwork in a small village in Malaysia, I was constantly struck\nby the breadth of my neighbors' skills and their casual knowledge of local\necology. One particular anecdote is representative. Growing in the compound of\nthe house in which I lived was a locally famous mango tree. Relatives and\nacquaintances would visit when the fruit was ripe in the hope of being given a\nfew fruits and, more important, the chance to save and plant the seeds next to\ntheir own house. Shortly before my arrival, however, the tree had become\ninfested with large red ants, which destroyed most of the fruit before it\ncould ripen. It seemed nothing could be done short of bagging each fruit.\nSeveral times I noticed the elderly head of household, Mat Isa, bringing dried\nnipah palm fronds to the base of the mango tree and checking them. When I\nfinally got around to asking what he was up to, he explained it to me, albeit\nreluctantly, as for him this was pretty humdrum stuff compared to our usual\ngossip. He knew that small black ants, which had a number of colonies at the\nrear of the compound, were the enemies of large red ants. He also knew that\nthe thin, lancelike leaves of the nipah palm curled into long, tight tubes\nwhen they fell from the tree and died. (In fact, the local people used the\ntubes to roll their cigarettes.) Such tubes would also, he knew, be ideal\nplaces for the queens of the black ant colonies to lay their eggs. Over\nseveral weeks he placed dried nipah fronds in strategic places until he had\nmasses of black-ant eggs beginning to hatch. He then placed the egg-infested\nfronds against the mango tree and observed the ensuing week-long Armageddon.\nSeveral neighbors, many of them skeptical, and their children followed the\nfortunes of the ant war closely. Although smaller by half or more, the black\nants finally had the weight of numbers to prevail against the red ants and\ngain possession of the ground at the base of the mango tree. As the black ants\nwere not interested in the mango leaves or fruits while the fruits were still\non the tree, the crop was saved.\n\nThis successful field experiment in biological controls presupposes several\nkinds of knowledge: the habitat and diet of black ants, their egg-laying\nhabits, a guess about what local material would substitute as movable egg\nchambers, and experience with the fighting proclivities of red and black ants.\nMat Isa made it clear that such skill in practical entomology was quite\nwidespread, at least among his older neighbors, and that people remembered\nsomething like this strategy having worked once or twice in the past. What is\nclear to me is that no agricultural extension official would have known the\nfirst thing about ants, let alone biological controls; most extension agents\nwere raised in town and in any case were concerned entirely with rice,\nfertilizer, and loans. Nor would most of them think to ask; they were, after\nall, the experts, trained to instruct the peasant. It is hard to imagine this\nknowledge being created and maintained except in the context of lifelong\nobservation and a relatively stable, multigenerational community that\nroutinely exchanges and preserves knowledge of this kind.\n\nOne purpose of this illustration is to alert us to the social conditions\nnecessary for the reproduction of comparable practical knowledge. These social\nconditions, at a minimum, would seem to require a community of interest,\naccumulated information, and ongoing experimentation. Occasionally there are\nformal institutions that seem almost perfectly tailored to the collection and\nexchange of practical information, such as the veillees of nineteenth-century\nFrance. The veillee, as its name implies, was a traditional pattern of\ngathering practiced by farm families during winter evenings, often in barns to\ntake advantage of the warmth generated by the livestock and thus save on fuel.\nWith no agenda save sociability and economy, the gatherings amounted to local\nassemblies where opinions, stories, agricultural news, advice, gossip, and\nreligious or folk tales were exchanged while the participants shelled nuts or\nembroidered. Given the fact that each member there possessed a lifetime of\ninterested observation and practice in which every family paid for the\nconsequences of its agricultural decisions, the veillee was an unheralded\ndaily seminar on practical knowledge.\n\nThis brings us squarely to two of the great ironies of metis. The first is\nthat metis is not democratically distributed. Not only does it depend on a\ntouch or a knack that may not be common, but access to the experience and\npractice necessary for its acquisition may be restricted. Artisan guilds,\ngifted craftsmen, certain classes, religious fraternities, entire communities,\nand men in general often treat some forms of knowledge as a monopoly they are\nreluctant to share. Better stated, the availability of such knowledge to\nothers depends greatly on the social structure of the society and the\nadvantages that a monopoly in some forms of knowledge can confer.\" In this\nrespect metis is not unitary, and we should perhaps speak of metises,\nrecognizing its nonhomo- geneity. The second irony is that, however plastic\nand receptive metis is, some forms of it seem to depend on key elements of\npreindustrial life for their elaboration and transmission. Communities that\nare marginal to markets and to the state are likely to retain a high degree of\nmetis; they have no choice, as they have to rely disproportionately on the\nknowledge and materials at hand. If, while shopping at the local store or\nvisiting at the farmers' association, Mat Isa had found a cheap pesticide that\nwould have finished off the red ants, I don't doubt that he would have used\nit.\n\nSome forms of metis are disappearing every day.72 As physical mobility,\ncommodity markets, formal education, professional specialization, and mass\nmedia spread to even the most remote communities, the social conditions for\nthe elaboration of metis are undermined. One could; with great justice,\nwelcome a great many of these extinctions of local knowledge. Once matches\nbecome widely available, why would anyone want to know, except as a matter of\nidle curiosity, how to make fire with flint and tinder? Knowing how to scrub\nclothes on a washboard or on a stone in the river is undoubtedly an art, but\none gladly abandoned by those who can afford a washing machine. Darning skills\nwere similarly lost, without much nostalgia, when cheap, machinemade stockings\ncame on the market. As the older Bugis seamen say, \"These days, with charts\nand compasses, an can steer.\"73 And why not? The production of standardized\nknowledge has made certain skills more broadly-more democratically-available,\nas they are no longer the preserve of a guild that may refuse admission or\ninsist on a long apprenticeship.74 Much of the world of metis that we have\nlost is the all but inevitable result of industrialization and the division of\nlabor. And much of this loss was experienced as a liberation from toil and\ndrudgery.\n\nBut it would be a serious error to believe that the destruction of metis was\nmerely the inadvertent and necessary by-product of economic progress. The\ndestruction of metis and its replacement by standardized formulas legible only\nfrom the center is virtually inscribed in the activities of both the state and\nlarge-scale bureaucratic capitalism. As a \"project,\" it is the object of\nconstant initiatives which are never entirely successful, for no forms of\nproduction or social life can be made to work by formulas alone-that is,\nwithout metis. The logic animating the project, however, is one of control and\nappropriation. Local knowledge, because it is dispersed and relatively\nautonomous, is all but unappropriable. The reduction or, more utopian still,\nthe elimination of metis and the local control it entails are preconditions,\nin the case of the state, of administrative order and fiscal appropriation\nand, in the case of the large capitalist firm, of worker discipline and\nprofit.\n\nThe subordination of metis is fairly obvious in the development of mass\nproduction in the factory. A comparable de-skilling process is, I believe,\nmore compelling and, given the intractable obstacles to complete\nstandardization, ultimately less successful in agricultural production.\n\nAs Stephen Marglin's early work has convincingly shown, capitalist profit\nrequires not only efficiency but the combination of efficiency and control.75\nThe crucial innovations of the division of labor at the subproduct level and\nthe concentration of production in the factory represent the key steps in\nbringing the labor process under unitary control. Efficiency and control might\ncoincide, as in the case of the mechanized spinning and weaving of cotton. At\ntimes, however, they might be unrelated or even contradictory. \"Efficiency at\nbest creates a potential profit,\" notes Marglin. \"Without control the\ncapitalist cannot realize that profit. Thus organizational forms which enhance\ncapitalist control may increase profits and find favor with capitalists even\nif they affect productivity and efficiency adversely. Conversely, more\nefficient ways of organizing production which reduce capitalist control may\nend up reducing profits and being rejected by capitalists.\"76 The typical\nstructure of artisanal production was often an impediment to efficiency. But\nit was nearly always an obstacle to capitalist profits. In the \"puttingout\"\nsystem in textiles that prevailed before factory organization, cottage workers\nhad control over the raw material, could set the pace of the work, and could\nincrease their return by various stratagems that were difficult to monitor.\nThe crucial advantage of the factory, from the boss's point of view, was that\nhe could more directly fix the hours and the intensity of the work and control\nthe raw materials.77 To the degree that efficient production could still be\norganized on an artisanal basis (such as early woolen manufacturing and silk\nribbon weaving, according to Marglin), to that degree was it difficult for the\ncapitalist to appropriate the profits of a dispersed craft population.\n\nThe genius of modern mass-production methods, Frederick Taylor, saw the issue\nof destroying metis and turning a resistant, quasiautonomous, artisan\npopulation into more suitable units, or \"factory hands,\" with great clarity.\n\"Under scientific management ... the managers assume ... the burden of\ngathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been\npossessed by the workmen and then of classifying, tabulating, and reducing\nthis knowledge to rules, laws, formulae.... Thus all of the planning which\nunder the old system was done by the workmen, must of necessity under the new\nsystem be done by management in accordance with the law of science.\"\" In the\nTaylorized factory, only the factory manager had the knowledge and command of\nthe whole process, and the worker was reduced to the execution of a small,\noften minute, part of the overall process. The result was often remarkably\nefficient, as in the early Ford plants; it was always, however, a great boon\nto control and profit.79\n\nThe utopian dream of Taylorization-a factory in which every pair of hands was\nmore or less reduced to automatic movements, on the model of programmed\nrobots-was unrealizable. Not that it wasn't tried. David Noble has described\nthe well-funded attempt to make machine tools through numerical controls\nbecause it promised \"emancipation from the human worker.\"10 Its ultimate\nfailure came precisely because the system had designed out metis-the practical\nadjustments that an experienced worker would make to compensate for slight\nchanges in material, temperatures, the wear on or irregularities in the\nmachine, mechanical malfunction, and so forth. As one operator said,\n\"Numerical controls are supposed to be like magic, but all you can do\nautomatically is produce scrap.\"\"' This conclusion could be generalized. In a\nbrilliant ethnography of the work routines of machine operators whose jobs\nappeared to have been thoroughly de-skilled, Ken Kusterer has shown how the\nworkers nevertheless had to develop individual skills that were absolutely\nnecessary to successful production but that could never be reduced to formulas\na novice could immediately use. One machine operator, whose job was classified\nas \"unskilled;' drew an analogy between performing his job and driving a car:\n\"Cars are basically the same but every car is different.... At first when\nyou're learning, you just learn rules about driving. But as you get to know\nhow to drive, you get a feel for the car you're driving-you know, things like\nhow it feels at different speeds, how well the brakes work, when it's going to\noverheat, how to start it when it's cold.... Then if you think about old cars\nlike these machines, been running three shifts for twenty years, some of them,\nlike maybe you've got a car with no horn, that wants to turn right when you\nhit the brake, that don't start right unless you pump the gas in a certain\nway-then maybe you see what it's like trying to run these old machines they've\ngot down here\"82\n\nTaylorization has its analogue in agricultural production as well, an analogue\nwith a far longer and more variegated history. In agriculture, as in\nmanufacturing, the mere efficiency of a form of production is not sufficient\nto ensure the appropriation of taxes or profits. Independent smallholder\nagriculture may, as we have noted, be the most efficient way to grow many\ncrops. But such forms of agriculture, although they may present possibilities\nfor taxation and profit when their products are bulked, processed, and sold,\nare relatively illegible and hard to control. As is the case with autonomous\nartisans and petit-bourgeois shopkeepers, monitoring the commercial fortunes\nof small-fry farms is an administrative nightmare. The possibilities for\nevasion and resistance are numerous, and the cost of procuring accurate,\nannual data is high, if not prohibitive.83\n\nA state mainly concerned with appropriation and control will find sedentary\nagriculture preferable to pastoralism or shifting agriculture. For the same\nreasons, such a state would generally prefer largeholding to smallholding and,\nin turn, plantation or collective agriculture to both. Where control and\nappropriation are the overriding considerations, only the last two forms offer\ndirect control over the workforce and its income, the opportunity to select\ncropping patterns and techniques, and, finally, direct control over the\nproduction and profit of the enterprise. Although collectivization and\nplantation agriculture are seldom very efficient, they represent, as we have\nseen, the most legible and hence appropriable forms of agriculture.\n\nThe large capitalist agricultural producer faces the same problem as the\nfactory owner: how to transform the essentially artisanal or metis knowledge\nof farmers into a standardized system that will allow him greater control over\nthe work and its intensity. The plantation was one solution. In colonial\ncountries, where able-bodied men were pressed into service as gang labor, the\nplantation represented a kind of private collectivization, inasmuch as it\nrelied on the state for the ex- tramarket sanctions necessary to control its\nlabor force. More than one plantation sector has made up what it lacked in\nefficiency by using its political clout to secure subsidies, price supports,\nand monopoly privileges.\n\nThe control made possible by the plantation, not to mention the collective\nfarm, has proved, with few exceptions, to entail such high costs in\nsupervision, rigidity, and overhead as to be inefficient. Now that plantation\nagriculture has been discredited, some of the newer alternatives devised to\nreplicate its control and standardization are instructive, as they indicate\nthe functional similarity that may lie behind different forms.84 The invention\nof contract farming worldwide is just one noteworthy example.85 When chicken\nfarmers realized that huge, centralized operations for raising fryers not only\nwere inefficient but posed serious disease and environmental problems, they\ndevised a kind of high-tech putting-out system.16 The large firm contracts\nwith a farmer to supply him with chicks and then to buy back (after six weeks\nor so) a certain number of chickens meeting their standards. The farmer, for\nhis part, is obliged to construct and pay for a building that meets corporate\nspecifications and to feed, water, and medicate the chickens with rations\nsupplied by the corporation and according to their precise timetable. An\ninspector frequently verifies compliance. For the corporation, the advantages\nare enormous: it risks no capital except what is invested in the birds; it\nneeds no land of its own; its management expenses are small; it achieves\nuniform product standards; and, not least, it can fail to renew a contract or\nchange the price paid after each round at no cost to itself.\n\nThe logic, although not the form, is the same as on the plantation. Given its\nnational or international market, what the corporation requires is absolute,\nguaranteed uniformity of product and a stable sup- ply.87 The need to\nadminister the production of uniform fryers in many different localities\nrequires an optic of standardization and aggregation. As we saw in the case of\nscientific forestry, this is not merely a question of inventing measures that\naccurately reflect the facts on the ground and that can be conveyed to\nadministrators. It is, above all, a question of changing the environment so\nthat it is more standardized to begin with. Only the standardized breeding,\nthe building constructed to specifications, the fixed formula for feed, and\nthe mandatory feeding schedule-all disciplined by the contract-make it\npossible for a single specialist to inspect one hundred poultry farms raising\nfryers for, say, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and to ensure that the variation is\nminimal. One can visualize his handy checklist. The purpose of contract\nfarming is not to understand farms and adapt to them; rather, it is to\ntransform farms and farm labor at the outset so that they fit the grid of the\ncontract.\n\nFor farmers who sign up, as long as the contracts are rolled over, there are\nprofits to be made, although at considerable risk. The contracts are short\nterm, the work schedules detailed, and the set-up and supplies mandatory. The\ncontract farmers are in theory small-business entrepreneurs, but aside from\nthe fact that they risk their land and buildings, they have not much more\ncontrol over their working day than do assembly-line workers.\n\n#### The Case Against Imperial Knowledge\n\nThey said ... that he was so devoted to Pure Science ... that he would rather\nhave people die by the right therapy than be cured by the wrong.\n\n-Sinclair Lewis, Arrowsmith\n\nThe argument that I have been venturing is not a case against high modernism\nor state simplifications per se or, to be sure, against epistemic knowledge\nper se. Our ideas about citizenship, public-health pro grams, social security,\ntransportation, communication, universal public education, and equality before\nthe law are all powerfully influenced by state-created, high-modernist\nsimplifications. I will go further and say that the initial land reforms in\nBolshevik Russia and in postrevolutionary China were state-abetted\nsimplifications that effectively enfranchised millions who had lived in\nvirtual serfdom. Epistemic knowledge, though never separate in its practice\nfrom metis, has provided us with a knowledge of the world that, for all its\ndarker aspects, few of us would want to surrender.\n\nWhat has proved to be truly dangerous to us and to our environment, I think,\nis the combination of the universalist pretensions of epistemic knowledge and\nauthoritarian social engineering. Such a combination has been at work in city\nplanning, in Lenin's view of revolution (but not his practice), in\ncollectivization in the Soviet Union, and in villagization in Tanzania. The\ncombination is implicit in the logic of scientific agriculture and explicit in\nits colonial practice. When schemes like these come close to achieving their\nimpossible dreams of ignoring or suppressing metis and local variation, they\nall but guarantee their own practical failure.\n\nUniversalist claims seem inherent in the way in which rationalist knowledge is\npursued. Although I am no philosopher of knowledge, there seems to be no door\nin this epistemic edifice through which metis or practical knowledge could\nenter on its own terms. It is this imperialism that is troubling. As Pascal\nwrote, the great failure of rationalism is \"not its recognition of technical\nknowledge, but its failure to recognize any other.\"88 By contrast, metis does\nnot put all its eggs in one basket; it makes no claim to universality and in\nthis sense is pluralistic. Of course, certain structural conditions can thwart\nthis imperialism of epistemic claims. Democratic and commercial pressures\nsometimes oblige agricultural scientists to premise their work on practical\nproblems as defined by farmers. During the Meiji Restoration, three-person\ntechnical teams began by investigating farmers' innovations and then taking\nthem back to the laboratory to perfect them. The construction workers who\nrefused to leave Brasilia as planned or the disillusioned ujamaa villagers who\nfled from their settlements to some degree undid the plans made for them. Such\nresistance, however, comes from outside the paradigm of epistemic knowledge\nitself. When someone like Albert Howard, himself a meticulous scientist,\nrecognizes the \"art\" of farming and the nonquantifiable ways of knowing, he\nsteps outside the realm of codified, scientific knowledge.\n\nAuthoritarian high-modernist states in the grip of a self-evident (and usually\nhalf-baked) social theory have done irreparable damage to human communities\nand individual livelihoods. The danger was compounded when leaders came to\nbelieve, as Mao said, that the people were a \"blank piece of paper\" on which\nthe new regime could write. The utopian industrialist Robert Owen had the same\nvision for the factory town New Lanark, although on a civic rather than\nnational level: \"Each generation, indeed each administration, shall see\nunrolled before it the blank sheet of infinite possibility, and if by chance\nthis tabula rasa had been defaced by the irrational scribblings of tradition-\nridden ancestors, then the first task of the rationalist must be to scrub it\nclean.\"8\n\nWhat conservatives like Oakeshott miss, I think, is that high modernism has a\nnatural appeal for an intelligentsia and a people who may have ample reason to\nhold the past in contempt.90 Late colonial modernizers sometimes wielded their\npower ruthlessly in transforming a population that they took to be backward\nand greatly in need of instruction. Revolutionaries have had every reason to\ndespise the feudal, poverty-stricken, inegalitarian past that they hoped to\nbanish forever, and sometimes they have also had a reason to suspect that\nimmediate democracy would simply bring back the old order. Postindependence\nleaders in the nonindustrial world (occasionally revolutionary leaders\nthemselves) could not be faulted for hating their past of colonial domination\nand economic stagnation, nor could they be faulted for wasting no time or\ndemocratic sentimentality on creating a people that they could be proud of.\nUnderstanding the history and logic of their commitment to high-modernist\ngoals, however, does not permit us to overlook the enormous damage that their\nconvictions entailed when combined with authoritarian state power.\n\n\n# 10 Conclusion\n\n![](img0051.jpg)\n\nThey would reconstruct society on an imaginary plan, much like the astronomers\nfor their own calculation would make over the system of the universe.\n\n-Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, on the utopian socialists\n\nYet a man who uses an imaginary map, thinking that it is a true one, is likely\nto be worse off than someone with no map at all; for he will fail to inquire\nwhenever he can, to observe every detail on his way, and to search\ncontinuously with all his senses and all his intelligence for indications of\nwhere he should go.\n\n-E. F. Schumacher, Small Is Beautiful\n\nThe great high-modernist episodes that we have examined qualify as tragedies\nin at least two respects. First, the visionary intellectuals and planners\nbehind them were guilty of hubris, of forgetting that they were mortals and\nacting as if they were gods. Second, their actions, far from being cynical\ngrabs for power and wealth, were animated by a genuine desire to improve the\nhuman condition-a desire with a fatal flaw. That these tragedies could be so\nintimately associated with optimistic views of progress and rational order is\nin itself a reason for a searching diagnosis. Another reason lies in the\ncompletely ecumenical character of the high-modernist faith. We encounter it\nin various guises in colonial development schemes, planned urban centers in\nboth the East and the West, collectivized farms, the large development plans\nof the World Bank, the resettlement of nomadic populations, and the management\nof workers on factory floors.\n\nIf such schemes have typically taken their most destructive human and natural\ntoll in the states of the former socialist bloc and in revolutionary Third\nWorld settings, that is surely because there authoritarian state power,\nunimpeded by representative institutions, could nullify resistance and push\nahead. The ideas behind them, however, on which their legitimacy and appeal\ndepended, were thoroughly Western. Order and harmony that once seemed the\nfunction of a unitary God had been replaced by a similar faith in the idea of\nprogress vouchsafed by scientists, engineers, and planners. Their power, it is\nworth remembering, was least contested at those moments when other forms of\ncoordination had failed or seemed utterly inadequate to the great tasks at\nhand: in times of war, revolution, economic collapse, or newly won\nindependence. The plans that they hatched bore a family resemblance to the\nschemes of legibility and standardization devised by the absolutist kings of\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. What was wholly new, however, was\nthe magnitude of both the plans for the wholesale transformation of society\nand the instruments of statecraft -censuses, cadastral maps, identity cards,\nstatistical bureaus, schools, mass media, internal security apparatuses-that\ncould take them farther along this road than any seventeenth-century monarch\nwould have dreamed. Thus it has happened that so many of the twentieth\ncentury's political tragedies have flown the banner of progress, emancipation,\nand reform.\n\nWe have examined in considerable detail how these schemes have failed their\nintended beneficiaries. If I were asked to condense the reasons behind these\nfailures into a single sentence, I would say that the progenitors of such\nplans regarded themselves as far smarter and farseeing than they really were\nand, at the same time, regarded their subjects as far more stupid and\nincompetent than they really were. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to\nexpanding on this cursory judgment and advancing a few modest lessons.\n\n#### \"It's Ignorance, Stupid!\"\n\nThe mistake of our ancestors was to think that they were \"the last number,\"\nbut since numbers are infinite, they could not be the last number.\n\n-Eugene Zamiatin, We\n\nThe maxim that serves as the heading for this section is not simply suitable\nfor bumper stickers mimicking the insider slogan of Bill Clinton's 1992\npresidential campaign, \"It's the economy, stupid!\" It is meant to call\nattention to how routinely planners ignore the radical contingency of the\nfuture. How rare it is to encounter advice about the future which begins from\na premise of incomplete knowledge. One small exception-a circular on nutrition\npublished by the health clinic at Yale University, where I teach-will\nunderscore its rarity. Normally, such circulars explain the major food groups,\nvitamins, and minerals known to be essential for balanced nutrition and advise\na diet based on these categories. This circular, however, noted that many new,\nessential elements of proper nutrition had been discovered in the past two\ndecades and that many more elements will presumably be identified by\nresearchers in the decades ahead. Therefore, on the basis of what they did not\nknow, the writers of this piece recommended that one's diet be as varied as\npossible, on the prudent assumption that it would contain many of these yet\nunidentified essentials.\n\nSocial and historical analyses have, almost inevitably, the effect of\ndiminishing the contingency of human affairs. A historical event or state of\naffairs simply is the way it is, often appearing determined and necessary when\nin fact it might easily have turned out to be otherwise. Even a probabilistic\nsocial science, however careful it may be about establishing ranges of\noutcomes, is apt to treat these probabilities, for the sake of analysis, as\nsolid facts. When it comes to betting on the future, the contingency is\nobvious, but so is the capacity of human actors to influence this contingency\nand help to shape the future. And in those cases where the bettors thought\nthat they knew the shape of the future by virtue of their grasp of historical\nlaws of progress or scientific truth, whatever awareness they retained of the\ncontingency seemed to dissolve before their faith.\n\nAnd yet each of these schemes, as might also have been predicted, was largely\nundone by a host of contingencies beyond the planners' grasp. The scope and\ncomprehensiveness of their plans were such that they would have had\nindeterminate outcomes even if their historical laws and the attendant\nspecification of variables and calculations had been correct. Their temporal\nambitions meant that although they might, with some confidence, guess the\nimmediate consequences of their moves, no one could specify, let alone\ncalculate, the second- or thirdorder consequences or their interaction\neffects. The wild cards in their deck, however, were the human and natural\nevents outside their models-droughts, wars, revolts, epidemics, interest\nrates, world consumer prices, oil embargoes. They could and did, of course,\nattempt to adjust and improvise in the face of these contingencies. But the\nmagnitude of their initial intervention was so great that many of their\nmissteps could not be righted. Stephen Marglin has put their problem\nsuccinctly: If \"the only certainty about the future is that the future is\nuncertain, if the only sure thing is that we are in for surprises, then no\namount of planning, no amount of prescription, can deal with the contingencies\nthat the future will reveal.\"'\n\nThere is a curiously resounding unanimity on this point, and on no others,\nbetween such right-wing critics of the command economy as Friedrich Hayek and\nsuch left-wing critics of Communist authoritarianism as Prince Peter\nKropotkin, who declared, \"It is impossible to legislate for the future.\" Both\nhad a great deal of respect for the diversity of human actions and the\ninsurmountable difficulties in successfully coordinating millions of\ntransactions. In a blistering critique of failed development paradigms, Albert\nHirschman made a comparable case, calling for \"a little more 'reverence for\nlife,' a little less straitjacketing of the future, a little more allowance\nfor the unexpectedand a little less wishful thinking.\"'\n\nOne might, on the basis of experience, derive a few rules of thumb that, if\nobserved, could make development planning less prone to disaster. While my\nmain goal is hardly a point-by-point reform of development practice, such\nrules would surely include something along the following lines.\n\nTake small steps. In an experimental approach to social change, presume that\nwe cannot know the consequences of our interventions in advance. Given this\npostulate of ignorance, prefer wherever possible to take a small step, stand\nback, observe, and then plan the next small move. As the biologist J. B. S.\nHaldane metaphorically described the advantages of smallness: \"You can drop a\nmouse down a thousandyard mineshaft; and on arriving at the bottom, it gets a\nslight shock and walks away. A rat is killed, a man broken, a horse\nsplashes.\"3\n\nFavor reversibility. Prefer interventions that can easily be undone if they\nturn out to be mistakes.4 Irreversible interventions have irreversible\nconsequences.5 Interventions into ecosystems require particular care in this\nrespect, given our great ignorance about how they interact. Aldo Leopold\ncaptured the spirit of caution required: \"The first rule of intelligent\ntinkering is to keep all the parts\"°\n\nPlan on surprises. Choose plans that allow the largest accommodation to the\nunforeseen. In agricultural schemes this may mean choosing and preparing land\nso that it can grow any of several crops. In planning housing, it would mean\n\"designing in\" flexibility for accommodating changes in family structures or\nliving styles. In a factory it may mean selecting a location, layout, or piece\nof machinery that allows for new processes, materials, or product lines down\nthe road.\n\nPlan on human inventiveness. Always plan under the assumption that those who\nbecome involved in the project later will have or will develop the experience\nand insight to improve on the design.\n\n#### Planning for Abstract Citizens\n\nThe power and precision of high-modernist schemes depended not only on\nbracketing contingency but also on standardizing the subjects of development.\nSome standardization was implicit even in the noblest goals of the planners.\nThe great majority of them were strongly committed to a more egalitarian\nsociety, to meeting the basic needs of its citizens (especially the working\nclass), and to making the amenities of a modern society available to all.\n\nLet us pause, however, to consider the kind of human subject for whom all\nthese benefits were being provided. This subject was singularly abstract.\nFigures as diverse as Le Corbusier, Walther Rathenau, the collectivizers of\nthe Soviet Union, and even Julius Nyerere (for all his rhetorical attention to\nAfrican traditions) were planning for generic subjects who needed so many\nsquare feet of housing space, acres of farmland, liters of clean water, and\nunits of transportation and so much food, fresh air, and recreational space.\nStandardized citizens were uniform in their needs and even interchangeable.\nWhat is striking, of course, is that such subjects-like the \"unmarked\ncitizens\" of liberal theory-have, for the purposes of the planning exercise,\nno gender, no tastes, no history, no values, no opinions or original ideas, no\ntraditions, and no distinctive personalities to contribute to the enterprise.\nThey have none of the particular, situated, and contextual attributes that one\nwould expect of any population and that we, as a matter of course, always\nattribute to elites.\n\nThe lack of context and particularity is not an oversight; it is the necessary\nfirst premise of any large-scale planning exercise. To the degree that the\nsubjects can be treated as standardized units, the power of resolution in the\nplanning exercise is enhanced. Questions posed within these strict confines\ncan have definitive, quantitative answers. The same logic applies to the\ntransformation of the natural world. Questions about the volume of commercial\nwood or the yield of wheat in bushels permit more precise calculations than\nquestions about, say, the quality of the soil, the versatility and taste of\nthe grain, or the wellbeing of the community.' The discipline of economics\nachieves its formidable resolving power by transforming what might otherwise\nbe considered qualitative matters into quantitative issues with a single\nmetric and, as it were, a bottom line: profit or loss.' Providing one\nunderstands the heroic assumptions required to achieve this precision and the\nquestions that it cannot answer, the single metric is an invaluable tool.\nProblems arise only when it becomes hegemonic.\n\nWhat is perhaps most striking about high-modernist schemes, despite their\nquite genuine egalitarian and often socialist impulses, is how little\nconfidence they repose in the skills, intelligence, and experience of ordinary\npeople. This is clear enough in the Taylorist factory, where the logic of work\norganization is to reduce the factory hands' contribution to a series of\nrepetitive, if practiced, movements-operations as machinelike as possible. But\nit is also clear in collectivized farms, ujamaa villages, and planned cities,\nwhere the movements of the populace have been to a large degree inscribed in\nthe designs of these communities. If Nyerere's aspirations for cooperative\nstate farm ing were frustrated, it was not because the plans had failed to\nintegrate a scheme of cooperative labor. The more ambitious and meticulous the\nplan, the less is left, theoretically, to chance and to local initiative and\nexperience.\n\n#### Stripping Reality to Its Essentials\n\nThe quantitative technologies used to investigate social and economic life\nwork best if the world they aim to describe can be remade in their image.\n\n-Theodore M. Porter, Trust in Numbers\n\nIf the facts-that is, the behavior of living human beings-are recalcitrant to\nsuch an experiment, the experimenter becomes annoyed and tries to alter the\nfacts to fit the theory, which, in practice, means a kind of vivisection of\nsocieties until they become what the theory originally declared that the\nexperiment should have caused them to be.\n\n-Isaiah Berlin, \"On Political Judgment\"\n\nThe clarity of the high-modernist optic is due to its resolute singularity.\nIts simplifying fiction is that, for any activity or process that comes under\nits scrutiny, there is only one thing going on. In the scientific forest there\nis only commercial wood being grown; in the planned city there is only the\nefficient movement of goods and people; in the housing estate there is only\nthe effective delivery of shelter, heat, sewage, and water; in the planned\nhospital there is only the swift provision of professional medical services.\nAnd yet both we and the planners know that each of these sites is the\nintersection of a host of interconnected activities that defy such simple\ndescriptions. Even something as apparently monofunctional as a road from A to\nB can at the same time function as a site for leisure, social intercourse,\nexciting diversions, and enjoying the view between A and B.9\n\nFor any such site, it is helpful to imagine two different maps of activity. In\nthe case of a planned urban neighborhood, the first map consists of a\nrepresentation of the streets and buildings, tracing the routes that the\nplanners have provided for the movements between workplaces and residences,\nthe delivery of goods, access to shopping, and so on. The second map consists\nof tracings, as in a time-lapse photograph, of all the unplanned movements-\npushing a baby carriage, window shopping, strolling, going to see a friend,\nplaying hopscotch on the sidewalk, walking the dog, watching the passing\nscene, taking shortcuts between work and home, and so on. This second map, far\nmore complex than the first, reveals very different patterns of circulation.\nThe older the neighborhood, the more likely that the second map will have\nnearly superseded the first, in roughly the same way that planned, suburban\nLevittowns have, after fifty years, become thoroughly different settings from\nwhat their designers envisioned.\n\nIf our inquiry has taught us anything, it is that the first map, taken alone,\nis misrepresentative and indeed nonsustainable. A same-age, monocropped forest\nwith all the debris cleared is in the long run an ecological disaster. No\nTaylorist factory can sustain production without the unplanned improvisations\nof an experienced workforce. Planned Brasilia is, in a thousand ways,\nunderwritten by unplanned Brasilia. Without at least some of the diversity\nidentified by Jacobs, a strippeddown public housing project (like Pruitt-Igoe\nin Saint Louis or Cabrini Green in Chicago) will fail its residents. Even for\nthe limited purposes of a myopic plan-commercial timber, factory output-the\none-dimensional map will simply not do. As with industrial agriculture and its\ndependency on landraces, the first map is possible only because of processes\nlying outside its parameters, which it ignores at its peril.\n\nOur inquiry has also taught us that such maps of legibility and control,\nespecially when they are backed by an authoritarian state, do partly succeed\nin shaping the natural and social environment after their image. To the degree\nthat such thin maps do manage to impress themselves on social life, what kind\nof people do they foster? Here I would argue that just as the monocropped,\nsame-age forest represents an impoverished and unsustainable ecosystem, so the\nhigh-modernist urban complex represents an impoverished and unsustainable\nsocial system.\n\nHuman resistance to the more severe forms of social straitjacketing prevents\nmonotonic schemes of centralized rationality from ever being realized. Had\nthey been realized in their austere forms, they would have represented a very\nbleak human prospect. One of Le Corbusier's plans, for example, called for the\nsegregation of factory workers and their families in barracks along the major\ntransportation arteries. It was a theoretically efficient solution to\ntransportation and production problems. If it had been imposed, the result\nwould have been a dispiriting environment of regimented work and residence\nwithout any of the animation of town life. This plan had all the charm of a\nTaylorist scheme where, using a comparable logic, the efficient organization\nof work was achieved by confining the workers' movements to a few repetitive\ngestures. The cookie-cutter design principles behind the layout of the Soviet\ncollective farm, the ujamaa village, or the Ethiopian resettlement betray the\nsame narrowness of vision. They were designed, above all, to facilitate the\ncentral administration of production and the control of public life.\n\nAlmost all strictly functional, single-purpose institutions have some of the\nqualities of sensory-deprivation tanks used for experimental purposes. At the\nlimit, they approach the great social control institutions of the eighteenth\nand nineteenth centuries: asylums, workhouses, prisons, and reformatories. We\nhave learned enough of such settings to know that over time they can produce\namong their inmates a characteristic institutional neurosis marked by apathy,\nwithdrawal, lack of initiative and spontaneity, uncommunicativeness, and\nintractability. The neurosis is an accommodation to a deprived, bland,\nmonotonous, controlled environment that is ultimately stupifying.10\n\nThe point is simply that high-modernist designs for life and production tend\nto diminish the skills, agility, initiative, and morale of their intended\nbeneficiaries. They bring about a mild form of this institutional neurosis.\nOr, to put it in the utilitarian terms that many of their partisans would\nrecognize, these designs tend to reduce the \"human capital\" of the workforce.\nComplex, diverse, animated environments contribute, as Jacobs saw, to\nproducing a resilient, flexible, adept population that has more experience in\nconfronting novel challenges and taking initiative. Narrow, planned\nenvironments, by contrast, foster a less skilled, less innovative, less\nresourceful population. This population, once created, would ironically have\nbeen exactly the kind of human material that would in fact have needed close\nsupervision from above. In other words, the logic of social engineering on\nthis scale was to produce the sort of subjects that its plans had assumed at\nthe outset.\n\nThat authoritarian social engineering failed to create a world after its own\nimage should not blind us to the fact that it did, at the very least, damage\nmany of the earlier structures of mutuality and practice that were essential\nto metis. The Soviet kolkhoz hardly lived up to its expectations, but by\ntreating its workforce more like factory hands than farmers, it did destroy\nmany of the agricultural skills the peasantry had possessed on the eve of\ncollectivization. Even if there was much in the earlier arrangements that\nought to have been abolished (local tyrannies based on class, gender, age, and\nlineage), a certain institutional autonomy was abolished as well. Here, I\nbelieve, there is something to the classical anarchist claim-that the state,\nwith its positive law and central institutions, undermines individuals'\ncapacities for autonomous self-governance-that might apply to the planning\ngrids of high modernism as well. Their own institutional legacy may be frail\nand evanescent, but they may impoverish the local wellsprings of economic,\nsocial, and cultural self-expression.\n\n#### The Failure of Schematics and the Role of Metis\n\nEverything is said to be under the leadership of the Party. No one is in\ncharge of the crab or the fish, but they are all alive.\n\n-Vietnamese villager, Xuan Huy village\n\nNot long after the decisive political opening in 1989, in what was then still\nthe Soviet Union, a congress of agricultural specialists was convened to\nconsider reforms in agriculture. Most participants were in favor of breaking\nup the collectives and privatizing the land in the hope of recreating a modern\nversion of the private sector that had thrived in the 1920s and that Stalin\nhad destroyed in 1930. And yet they were nearly unanimous in their despair\nover what three generations had done to the skills, initiative, and knowledge\nof the kolkhozniki. They compared their situation unfavorably to that of\nChina, where a mere twenty-five years of collectivization had, they imagined,\nleft much of the entrepreneurial skill of the peasantry intact. Suddenly a\nwoman from Novosibirsk scolded them: \"How do you think the rural people\nsurvived sixty years of collectivization in the first place? If they hadn't\nused their initiative and wits, they wouldn't have made it through! They may\nneed credit and supplies, but there's nothing wrong with their initiative.\" I\n'\n\nDespite the manifold failures of collectivization, it seems, the kolkhozniki\nhad found ways and means to at least get by. We should not forget in this\ncontext that the first response to collectivization in 1930 was determined\nresistance and even rebellion. Once that resistance was broken, the survivors\nhad little choice but to comply outwardly. They could hardly make the rural\ncommand economy a success, but they could do what was necessary to meet\nminimal quotas and ensure their own economic survival.\n\nAn indication of the kinds of improvisations both tolerated and required may\nbe inferred from an astute case study of two East German factories before the\nWall came down in 1989.12 Each factory was under great pressure to meet\nproduction quotas-on which their allimportant bonuses depended-in spite of old\nmachinery, inferior raw materials, and a lack of spare parts. Under these\ndraconian conditions, two employees were indispensable to the firm, despite\ntheir modest place in the official hierarchy. One was the jack-of-all-trades\nwho improvised short-term solutions to keep machinery running, to correct or\ndisguise production flaws, and to make raw materials stretch further. The\nsecond was a wheeler-dealer who located and bought or bartered for spare\nparts, machinery, and raw material that could not be obtained through official\nchannels in time. To facilitate the wheeler-dealer's work, the factory\nroutinely used its funds to stock up on such valued nonperishable goods as\nsoap powder, cosmetics, quality paper, yarn, good wine and champagne,\nmedicines, and fashionable clothes. When it seemed that the plant would fall\nshort of the quota because it lacked a key valve or machine tool, these\nknowledgeable dealers would set off across the country, their small Trabant\nautos jammed with barter goods, to secure what was needed. Neither of these\nroles was provided for in the official table of organization, and yet the\nsurvival of the factory depended more on their skills, wisdom, and experience\nthan on those of any other employee. A key element in the centrally planned\neconomy was underwritten, always unofficially, by metis.\n\nCases like the one just described are the rule, not the exception. They serve\nto illustrate that the formal order encoded in social-engineering designs\ninevitably leaves out elements that are essential to their actual functioning.\nIf the factory were forced to operate only within the confines of the roles\nand functions specified in the simplified design, it would quickly grind to a\nhalt. Collectivized command economies virtually everywhere have limped along\nthanks to the often desperate improvisation of an informal economy wholly\noutside its schemata.\n\nStated somewhat differently, all socially engineered systems of formal order\nare in fact subsystems of a larger system on which they are ultimately\ndependent, not to say parasitic. The subsystem relies on a variety of\nprocesses-frequently informal or antecedent-which alone it cannot create or\nmaintain. The more schematic, thin, and simplified the formal order, the less\nresilient and the more vulnerable it is to disturbances outside its narrow\nparameters. This analysis of high modernism, then, may appear to be a case for\nthe invisible hand of market coordination as opposed to centralized economies.\nAn important caution, however, is in order. The market is itself an\ninstituted, formal system of coordination, despite the elbow room that it\nprovides to its participants, and it is therefore similarly dependent on a\nlarger system of social relations which its own calculus does not acknowledge\nand which it can neither create nor maintain. Here I have in mind not only the\nobvious elements of contract and property law, as well as the state's coercive\npower to enforce them, but antecedent patterns and norms of social trust,\ncommunity, and cooperation, without which market exchange is inconceivable.\nFinally, and most important, the economy is \"a subsystem of a finite and\nnongrowing eco-system,\" whose carrying capacity and interactions it must\nrespect as a condition of its persistence.13\n\nIt is, I think, a characteristic of large, formal systems of coordination that\nthey are accompanied by what appear to be anomalies but on closer inspection\nturn out to be integral to that formal order. Much of this might be termed\n\"metis to the rescue,\" although for people ensnared in schemes of\nauthoritarian social engineering that threaten to do them in, such\nimprovisations bear the mark of scrambling and desperation. Many modern\ncities, and not just those in the Third World, function and survive by virtue\nof slums and squatter settlements whose residents provide essential services.\nA formal command economy, as we have seen, is contingent on petty trade,\nbartering, and deals that are typically illegal. A formal economy of pension\nsystems, social security, and medical benefits is underwritten by a mobile,\nfloating population with few of these protections. Similarly, hybrid crops in\nmechanized farm operations persist only because of the diversity and\nimmunities of antecedent landraces. In each case, the nonconforming practice\nis an indispensable condition for formal order.\n\n#### A Case for Metis-Friendly Institutions\n\nThe invention of scientific forestry, freehold tenure, planned cities,\ncollective farms, ujamaa villages, and industrial agriculture, for all their\ningeniousness, represented fairly simple interventions into enormously complex\nnatural and social systems. After being abstracted from systems whose\ninteractions defied a total accounting, a few elements were then made the\nbasis for an imposed order. At best, the new order was fragile and vulnerable,\nsustained by improvisations not foreseen by its originators. At worst, it\nwreaked untold damage in shattered lives, a damaged ecosystem, and fractured\nor impoverished societies.\n\nThis rather blanket condemnation must be tempered, especially in the case of\nsocial systems, by at least four considerations. First, and most important,\nthe social orders they were designed to supplant were typically so manifestly\nunjust and oppressive that almost any new order might seem preferable. Second,\nhigh-modernist social engineering usually came cloaked in egalitarian,\nemancipatory ideas: equality before the law, citizenship for all, and rights\nto subsistence, health, education, and shelter. The premise and great appeal\nof the high-modernist credo was that the state would make the benefits of\ntechnological progress available to all its citizens.\n\nThe two remaining reasons for tempering our condemnation of such schemes have\nless to do with their potentially destructive consequences than with the\ncapacity of ordinary human actors to modify them or, in the end, to bring them\ndown. Where functioning representative institutions were at hand, some\naccommodation was inevitable. In their absence, it is still remarkable how the\ndogged, day-to-day re sistance of thousands of citizens forced the abandonment\nor restructuring of projects. Given sufficient time and leeway, of course, any\nhigh-modernist plan will be utterly remade by popular practice. Soviet\ncollective farms, the most draconian case, were finally brought down as much\nby the dispirited work and resistance of the kolkhozniki as by the political\nshifts in Moscow.\n\nWithout denying the incontestable benefits either of the division of labor or\nof hierarchical coordination for some tasks, I want to make a case for\ninstitutions that are instead multifunctional, plastic, diverse, and\nadaptable-in other words, institutions that are powerfully shaped by metis.\nThe fact that those ensnared in confining systems of formal order seem\nconstantly to be working, in their own interest, to make the systems more\nversatile is one indication of a common process of \"social domestication.\" A\nsecond indication is the social magnetism of autonomy and diversity as seen,\nfor example, in the popularity of Jacobs's mixed-use neighborhoods and in the\ncontinued attraction of self-employment.\n\nDiversity and certain forms of complexity, apart from their attractiveness,\nhave other advantages. In natural systems, we know, these advantages are\nmanifold. Old-growth forests, polycropping, and agriculture with open-\npollinated landraces may not be as productive, in the short run, as single-\nspecies forests and fields or identical hybrids. But they are demonstrably\nmore stable, more self-sufficient, and less vulnerable to epidemics and\nenvironmental stress, needing far less in the way of external infusions to\nkeep them on track. Every time we replace \"natural capital\" (such as wild fish\nstocks or old-growth forests) with what might be called \"cultivated natural\ncapital\" (such as fish farms or tree plantations), we gain in ease of\nappropriation and in immediate productivity, but at the cost of more\nmaintenance expenses and less \"redundancy, resiliency, and stability.\" 14 If\nthe environmental challenges faced by such systems are both modest and\npredictable, then a certain simplification might also be relatively stable.15\nOther things being equal, however, the less diverse the cultivated natural\ncapital, the more vulnerable and nonsustainable it becomes. The problem is\nthat in most economic systems, the external costs (in water or air pollution,\nfor example, or the exhaustion of nonrenewable resources, including a\nreduction in biodiversity) accumulate long before the activity becomes\nunprofitable in a narrow profit-and-loss sense.\n\nA roughly similar case can be made, I think, for human institutions -a case\nthat contrasts the fragility of rigid, single-purpose, centralized\ninstitutions to the adaptability of more flexible, multipurpose, decentral\nized social forms. As long as the task environment of an institution remains\nrepetitive, stable, and predictable, a set of fixed routines may prove\nexceptionally efficient. In most economies and in human affairs generally,\nthis is seldom the case, and such routines are likely to be counterproductive\nonce the environment changes appreciably. The long-term survival of certain\nhuman institutions-the family, the small community, the small farm, the family\nfirm in certain businesses-is something of a tribute to their adaptability\nunder radically changing circumstances. They are by no means infinitely\nadaptable, but they have weathered more than one prediction of their\ninevitable demise. The small family farm, by virtue of its flexible labor\n(including the exploitation of its children), its capacity to shift into new\ncrops or livestock, and its tendency to diversify its risks, has managed to\npersist in competitive economies when many huge, highly leveraged, mechanized,\nand specialized corporate and state farms have failed. 16 In a sector of the\neconomy where local knowledge, quick responses to weather and crop conditions,\nand low overhead (smallness) are more important than in, say, large industry,\nthe family farm has some formidable advantages.\n\nEven in huge organizations, diversity pays dividends in stability and\nresilience. A one-product city like the Stalinist steel-making jewel of\nMagnitogorsk is vulnerable when its technology is superseded and more\nspecialty products are required, whereas a nonspecialized city with a host of\nindustries and a diverse labor force can weather greater shocks. Within the\nmost industrialized economies, it is still striking that complex and often\nlow-income subsistence strategies, self-provisioning, and working off the\nbooks are both widespread and essential, although they are nearly invisible in\nmost forms of economic accounting.\" Much has also been made of the rather\ncomplex family firms in EmiliaRomagna, Italy, which have thrived for\ngenerations in an extremely competitive world textile market by virtue of\nnetworks of mutuality, adaptability, and a highly skilled and committed\nworkforce. The family firms are at the same time embedded in a much-studied\nlocal society that is several centuries deep in associational life and civic\nskills.\" These firms and the dense, diverse societies upon which they depend\nhave increasingly seemed less like archaic survivals and more like forms of\nenterprise ideally suited to postindustrial capitalism. Even within the narrow\nconfines of market competitiveness in liberal industrial societies, the case\nfor polyvalent, adaptive, small units is stronger than any high modernist of\nthe 1920s could possibly have imagined.\n\nOnce we measure such polyvalent institutions by broader criteria, moreover,\nthe case becomes even more powerful. Much of the argument at this level comes\nback to the question posed earlier: what kind of person does this sort of\ninstitution foster? No one has established the link between economic\nenterprise and political skills better than Thomas Jefferson in his\ncelebration of the yeoman farmer. The autonomy and the skills required in\nindependent farming, Jefferson believed, helped to nurture a citizen with a\nhabit of responsible decision making, enough property to avoid social\ndependence, and a tradition of reasoning and negotiation with his fellow\ncitizens. The yeomanry was, in short, an ideal training ground for democratic\ncitizenship.\n\nTo any planned, built, or legislated form of social life, one may apply a\ncomparable test: to what degree does it promise to enhance the skills,\nknowledge, and responsibility of those who are a part of it? On narrower\ninstitutional grounds, the question would be how deeply that form is marked by\nthe values and experience of those who compose it. The purpose in each case\nwould be to distinguish \"canned\" situations that permit little or no\nmodification from situations largely open to the development and application\nof metis.\n\nA brief example comparing war memorials may be helpful. The Vietnam Memorial\nin Washington, D.C., is surely one of the most successful war memorials ever\nbuilt, if one is to judge by the quantity and intensity of the visits it\nreceives. Designed by Maya Lin, the memorial consists simply of a gently\nundulating site marked (not dominated) by a long, low, black marble wall\nlisting the names of the fallen. The names are listed neither alphabetically\nnor by military unit but chronologically, in the order in which they fell-thus\ngrouping those who had fallen on the same day in the same engagement. 19 No\nlarger claim is made about the war either in prose or in sculpture-which is\nhardly surprising, in view of the stark political cleavages the war still\ninspires.20 What is most remarkable, however, is the way that the Vietnam\nMemorial works for those who visit it, particularly those who come to pay\ntheir respects to the memory of a comrade or loved one. They touch the names\nincised on the wall, make rubbings, and leave artifacts and mementos of their\nown-everything from poems and a woman's highheeled shoe to a glass of\nchampagne and a poker hand of a full house, aces high. So many of these\ntributes have been left, in fact, that a museum has been created to house\nthem. The scene of many people together at the wall, touching the names of\nparticular loved ones who fell in the same war, has moved observers regardless\nof their position on the war itself. I believe that a great part of the\nmemorial's symbolic power is its capacity to honor the dead with an openness\nthat allows visitors to impress upon it their own meanings, their own\nhistories, their own memories. The memorial virtually requires participation\nin order to complete its meaning. Although one would not compare it to a\nRorschach test, the memorial nevertheless does achieve its meaning as much by\nwhat citizens bring to it as by what it imposes.\n\nCompare the Vietnam Memorial to a very different American war memorial: the\nsculpture depicting the raising of the American flag at the summit of Mount\nSuribachi on Iwo Jima in World War II. Moving in its own right, referring as\nit does to the final moment of a victory gained at an enormous cost in lives,\nthe Iwo Jima statue is manifestly heroic. Its patriotism (symbolized by the\nflag), its reference to conquest, its larger-than-life scale, and its implicit\ntheme of unity in victory leave little room for wondering what is expected\nfrom the viewer. Given the virtual unanimity with which that war was, and is,\nviewed in the United States, it is hardly surprising that the Iwo Jima\nmemorial should be monumental and explicit about its message. Although not\nexactly \"canned,\" the Iwo Jima site is more symbolically self-sufficient, as\nare most war memorials. Visitors can stand in awe, gazing on an image that\nthrough photographs and sculpture has become a virtual icon for the War in the\nPacific, but they receive its message rather than completing it.21\n\nAn institution, social form, or enterprise that takes much of its shape from\nthe evolving metis of the people engaged in it will thereby enhance their\nrange of experience and skills. Following the advice of the saying \"Use it or\nlose it,\" the metis-friendly institution both uses and renews a valuable\npublic good. As an exclusive litmus test for all social forms, this is clearly\ninsufficient. All social forms are \"artificially\" constructed to serve some\nhuman purpose. Where that purpose is narrow, simple, and invariable over time,\nit may well be that codified, hierarchical routines are adequate and possibly\nthe most efficient in the short run. Even in such cases, however, we should be\naware of the human costs of stultifying routines and the likely resistance to\nrote performance.\n\nWhenever, on the contrary, the quality of the institution and its product\ndepends on engaging the enthusiastic participation of its people, then such a\nlitmus test makes sense. In the case of housing, for example, its success\ncannot be severed from the opinions of its users. Housing planners that take\nas a given the variety of human tastes and the inevitable (but unpredictable)\nchanges in the shape of families will accommodate that variation from the\noutset by providing flexible building designs and adjustable floor plans.\nDevelopers of neighborhoods, by the same token, will promote the sort of\ndiversity and complexity that will help to ensure their vitality and\ndurability. Above all, those with planning and zoning powers will not see\ntheir task as one of making sure that neighborhoods hold, through thick and\nthin, to their designed forms. One can imagine many types of institutions-\nschools, parks, playgrounds, civic associations, business enterprises,\nfamilies, even planning bodies-that might well be evaluated through the same\nlens.\n\nA good many institutions in liberal democracies already take such a form and\nmay serve as exemplars for fashioning new ones. One could say that democracy\nitself is based on the assumption that the metis of its citizenry should, in\nmediated form, continually modify the laws and policies of the land. Common\nlaw, as an institution, owes its longevity to the fact that it is not a final\ncodification of legal rules, but rather a set of procedures for continually\nadapting some broad principles to novel circumstances. Finally, that most\ncharacteristic of human institutions, language, is the best model: a structure\nof meaning and continuity that is never still and ever open to the\nimprovisations of all its speakers.\n\n\n# Notes\n\n![](img0052.jpg)\n\n###### Chapter 1: Nature and Space\n\n1\\.

Instead of\naltering the phenomenon observed through the act of observation, so that the\npre-observation state of the phenomenon is unknowable in principle, the effect\nof (interested) obser vation in this case is to alter the phenomenon in\nquestion over time so that it, in fact, more closely resembles the stripped\ndown, abstract image the lens had revealed.\n\n7\\. See Keith Tribe, Governing Economy: The Reformation of German Economic\nDiscourse, 1750-1840 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988). The more\ngeneral process of codifying the principles of state administration in\nseventeenthand eighteenth-century Europe is examined by Michel Foucault under\nthe (misleading) heading of \"police state\" (from Polizeiwissenschaft) in his\nlectures on \"governmentality,\" delivered at the College de France. See Graham\nBurchell, Colin Gordon, and Peter Miller, eds., The Foucault Effect: Studies\nin Governmentality (London: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1991), especially chap. 4.\n\n8\\. In the late seventeenth century, Jean-Baptiste Colbert had extensive plans\nto \"rationalize\" forest administration in order both to prevent poaching and\nto generate a more reliable revenue yield. To this end, Etienne Dralet's\nTraite du regime forestier proposed regulated plots (tire-wire) \"so that the\ngrowth is regular and easy to guard\" Despite these initiatives, nothing much\ncame of it in France until 1820, when the new German techniques were imported.\nSee Peter Sahlins, Forest Rites: The War of the Demoiselles in Nineteenth-\nCentury France, Harvard Historical Studies no. 115 (Cambridge: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 1994.\n\n9\\. Lowood, The Calculating Forester,\" p. 338.\n\n10\\. Various techniques were tried, including cutting an actual tree into bits\nand then compressing them to find the volume of the tree, and putting wood in\na barrel of known volume and adding measured amounts of water to calculate the\nvolume of the barrel not occupied by the wood (ibid., p. 328).\n\n11\\. The utilitarian framework could, in principle, have been used to\nemphasize some other calculable \"end\" of the forest-e.g., game populations,\nmast-quality timber, or grazing acreage. Where several agencies superintending\nthe forest have conflicting utilitarian agendas, the result can be incoherence\nand room for the local population to maneuver. See the fine study by K.\nSivaramakrishnan, \"Forests, Politics, and Governance in Bengal, 1794-1994\"\n(Ph.D. diss., Department of Anthropology, Yale University, 1996).\n\n12\\. 1 was tempted to add that, with regard to the use of forests, the view of\nthe state might be longer and broader than that of private firms, which can,\nand have, plundered old-growth forests and then sold their acreage or\nsurrendered it for back taxes (e.g., the \"cutover\" in the Upper Midwest of the\nUnited States at the turn of the century). The difficulty is that in cases of\nwar or a fiscal crisis, the state often takes an equally shortsighted view.\n\n13\\. Lowood, \"The Calculating Forester,\" p. 341. See also Harrison, Forests,\npp. 122-23.\n\n14\\. The recent cloning of tree stock to produce genetically uniform members\nof a given species is a yet more dramatic step in the direction of uniformity\nand control.\n\n15\\. One of the innovations such experimentation gave rise to was \"financial\nrotation.\" Close attention to annual rates of growth over the life of a pure\nstand and the surer knowledge about timber yields enabled foresters to\ncalculate precisely the point at which the added value of another year of\ngrowth was exceeded by the added value (minus the amortized cost of earlier\nfelling and replanting) of new growth. The precision was, of course,\npredicated on the comparisons made possible by the assumption of homogeneous\nunits of timber and market prices.\n\n16\\. The term \"redesigned\" is adopted from Chris Maser's valuable book, The\nRedesigned Forest (San Pedro: R. and E. Miles, 1988). Much of his argument can\nbe inferred from the oppositions he emphasizes in the headings of the early\nsections: \"Nature designed a forest as an experiment in unpredictability....\nWe are trying to design a regulated forest\"; \"Nature designed a forest of\nlong-term trends.... We are trying to design a forest of short-term\nabsolutes\"; \"Nature designed a forest with diversity.... We are designing a\nforest with simplistic uniformity\"; \"Nature designed a forest with\ninterrelated processes.... We are trying to design a forest based on isolated\nproducts\" (p. vii).\n\n17\\. See, for example, Honore de Balzac's Les pavsans (Paris: Pleiades, 1949);\nE. P. Thompson, Whigs and Hunters: The Origin of the Black Act (New York:\nPantheon, 1975); Douglas Hay, \"Poaching on Cannock Chase,\" in Douglas Hay et\nal., eds., Albion's Fatal Tree (New York: Pantheon, 1975); and Steven Hahn,\n\"Hunting, Fishing, and Foraging: Common Rights and Class Relations in the\nPostbellum South,\" Radical History Review 26 (1982): 37-64. For an apposite\nGerman case, see one of Karl Marx's first published articles linking the theft\nof wood to the business cycle and unemployment in the Rhineland: reported in\nPeter Linebaugh, \"Karl Marx, the Theft of Wood, and Working-Class Composition:\nA Contribution to the Current Debate,\" Crime and Social Justice, Fall-Winter\n1976, pp. 5-16.\n\n18\\. The results of three rotations might require as much as two hundred\nyears, or the working lives of perhaps six foresters, to observe. Compare this\nwith, say, the results of three rotations of maize, which would require only\nthree years. For most contemporary forests, the results of the third rotation\nare not yet in. In forest experimentation, the experimental period easily\nstretches well beyond a single lifetime. See Maser, The Redesigned Forest.\n\n19\\. There was within Germany a debate between the utilitarian outlook I have\ndescribed and an anti-utilitarian, anti-Manchester School stream of thought\nrepresented by, among others, Karl Geyer, an exponent of the Alisclnvald and\nnatural regeneration. But the short-run success of the utilitarians ensured\nthat their view became the hegemonic \"export model\" of German scientific\nforestry. I am grateful to Arvid Nelson for this information and for sharing\nhis deep knowledge about the history of forest policy in Germany. In 1868,\nDeitrich Brandes, the German chief of colonial India's forests, proposed a\nplan that would have encouraged community forests as well as state production\nforests, but the first part of his plan was vetoed by British administrators.\nThe interests of state officials, it appears, tended to select out of the\nmixed heritage of German forestry those elements most favorable to legibility,\nmanagement, and revenue.\n\n20\\. Pinchot toured Prussian and Swiss forests after his studies in Nancy.\nCarl Schenk, the founder of the first forestry school in the United States,\nwas a German immigrant trained in German universities, and Bernhard Fernow,\nthe chief of the federal government's forestry division from 1886 to 1898\n(before Pinchot), was a graduate of the Prussian Forest Academy at Meunden. I\nam grateful to Carl Jacoby for this information.\n\n2 1. For a detailed and analytically searching account of colonial forest\npolicy in India, see Sivaramakrishnan, \"Forests, Politics, and Governance in\nBengal.\" In chap. 6 he shows how three principles of scientific forestry-that\npure stands of commercial timber did better than mixed stands, that fire was a\ndestructive factor to be avoided, and that grazing or firewood collecting\ncould only threaten the forest management program-were overthrown by\naccumulating evidence in India.\n\n22\\. Richard Plochmann, Forestry in the Federal Republic of Germany, Hill\nFamily Foundation Series (Corvallis: Oregon State University School of\nForestry, 1968), pp. 24-25; quoted in Maser, The Redesigned Forest, pp.\n197-98. The elided sentences, for those interested in the specific\ninteractions, continue: \"A spruce stand may serve as an example. Our spruce\nroots are normally very shallow. Planted on former hardwood soil, the spruce\nroots could follow the deep root channels of the former hardwoods in the first\ngeneration. But in the second gen oration the root systems turned shallow on\naccount of progressive soil compaction. As a result, the available nutrient\nsupply for the trees became smaller. The spruce stand could profit from the\nmild humus accumulated in the first generation by the hardwoods, but it was\nnot able to produce a mild humus itself. Spruce litter rots much more slowly\nthan broadleaf litter and is much more difficult for the fauna and flora of\nthe upper soil layer to decompose. Therefore a raw humus developed in most\ncases. Its humic acids started to leach the soil under our humid climate and\nimpoverished the soil fauna and flora. This caused an even poorer\ndecomposition and a faster development of raw humus.\" Plochmann points out\nthat the process in pine plantations is roughly similar. I have confirmed this\npattern with David Smith of Yale's School of Forestry and Environmental\nStudies, author of The Practice of Silviculture, an important reference on\nmodern forestry techniques. For a similar account of how the techniques of\nscientific forestry, particularly its aversion to fire and its preference for\nmonoculture, negatively affected forest health and production, see Nancy\nLangston, Forest Dreams, Forest Nightmares: The Paradox of Old Growth in the\nInland West (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995).\n\n23\\. \"When snags are removed from short-rotation stands, 10% of the wildlife\nspecies (excluding birds) will be eliminated; 29% of the wildlife species will\nbe eliminated when both snags and fallen trees (logs) are removed from\nintensively managed young growth forests. As pieces are continually removed\nfrom the forest with the notion of the simplistic uniformity that is termed\n'intensive timber management,' we come closer to the ultimate simplistic view\nof modern forestry-the plantation or 'Christmas tree farm'\" (Maser, The\nRedesigned Forest, p. 19).\n\n24\\. The key step in this process seems to be the below-ground, symbiotic\nfungusroot structures (mycorrhizal association) studied closely by Sir Albert\nHoward. See chapter 7.\n\n25\\. Some of the pests in question included the \"pine looper moth, pine\nbeauty, pine moth, Nun moth, saw flies, bark beetles, pine needle cast fungus,\npine bluster rust, honey fungus, red rot\" (Maser, The Redesigned Forest, p.\n78).\n\n26\\. For a brief description of these practices, see Rachel Carson, Silent\nSpring (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962, 1987). Carson praised these advances\nbecause they seemed to herald the use of biological controls rather than\npesticides.\n\n27\\. The untoward consequences of engineering a forest in order to maximize\nthe production of a single commodity is by now a worldwide experience. After\nWorld War 11, Japan adopted a policy of replacing many of the forests that had\nbeen plundered for fuelwood and building materials with a single species: the\nJapanese cedar, selected for its rapid growth and commercial value. Now it is\nclear that the miles of tall, slender, uniform cedars have caused heavy soil\nerosion and landslides, have reduced the water table, and are easily felled by\nstorms. They allow little sunlight to filter through to the forest floor and\nprovide little protection or food for fauna. For urban Japanese, the chief\nshort-term inconvenience of the cedars is their seasonal massive release of\npollen, which triggers severe allergic responses. But allergies are just the\nmost manifest symptom of the deeper consequences of such radical\nsimplification. See James Sterngold, \"Japan's Cedar Forests Are a Man-Made\nDisaster,\" New York Tintes, January 17, 1995, pp. C 1, C 10.\n\n28\\. Maser, The Redesigned Forest, pp. 54-55. The \"commodity\" in question in a\ngreat many contemporary forests is not wood per se but pulp for making paper.\nThis has led, in turn, to the genetic engineering of species and cloned stock\nthat will produce the ideal quality and quantity of pulp.\n\n29\\. In the context of welfare economics, the practice of scientific forestry\nwas able to externalize a large number of costs to the community at large\nwhich did not appear on its own balance sheet: e.g., soil depletion, loss of\nwater retention capacity and water quality, reduction of game, and loss of\nbiodiversity.\n\n30\\. Plochmann, Forestry in the Federal Republic of Germany, p. 25. There are,\nof course, naturally occurring pure stands of timber, usually in constrained\necological conditions, including, diagnostically, those found on severely\ndegraded sites. For a range of views on this issue, see Matthew J. Kelty,\nBruce C. Larson, and Chadwick D. Oliver, eds., The Ecology and Silviculture of\nMixed-Species Forests: A Festschrift for David W. Smith (Dordrecht and Boston:\nKluwer Academic Publishing, 1992).\n\n31\\. Nancy Langston has a more global assessment: \"Everyone who has ever tried\nto fix the forests has ended up making them worse\" (Forest Dreams, Forest\nNightmares, p. 2).\n\n32\\.

It was precisely this\ncapacity for evading taxes that gave the fiscal regime a degree of unintended\n(from the top, at least) flexibility and helped states to avoid even more\nrebellion in the troubled seventeenth century.\n\n35\\. J. L. Heilbron notes that in 1791 an English colonel in the militia\nobliged the Scottish clergy to send him inventories of their population by\nthreatening to quarter troops in their parish (introduction to Tore Frangsmyr,\nJ.

This assumes that the crown wanted to maximize its proceeds in the long\nrun. It was and is common, of course, for regimes in political or military\ncrises to mortgage their futures by squeezing as much as possible from their\nforests or their subjects. See, in this context, the superb analytical\nsynthesis of Charles Tilly, Coercion, Capital, and European States, A.D.\n990-1992 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990), who stresses the influence of preparation\nfor war and war-making in state formation and describes the transition from\n\"tributary\" states to states that extract directly from citizens.\n\n37\\.

The same motive was at work in the folk categories of stratification used\nby Javanese villagers: the Kekurangans (those-who-have-less-than-enough) and\nthe Kecukupans (those-who-have-enough). See Clifford Geertz, Agricultural\nInvolution (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1963).\n\n42\\. What was seen as customary might not have had a very long pedigree. It\nwas always in the interests of at least one party, who feared a\ndisadvantageous renegotiation, to treat the existing arrangement as fixed and\nsacrosanct.\n\n43\\. Occasionally, the balance of power might swing in the other direction.\nSee, in this connection, the evidence for a long decline in tithe payments in\nFrance: Emmanuel LeRoi Ladurie and Joseph Gay, Tithe and Agrarian History from\nthe Fourteenth Century to the Nineteenth Century: An Essay in Comparative\nHistory, trans. Susan Burke (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982), p.\n27.\n\n44\\. Kula, Measures and Men, p. 150. In Lower Burma in the 1920s and '30s, the\nlandlord's paddy basket for receiving tenants' rent in kind was nicknamed \"the\ncartbreaker\" (James C.

The famous iron toile of Paris, for example, was set in one of the walls\nof the Grand Chatelet; see Ken Alder, \"A Revolution Made to Measure: The\nPolitical Economy of the Metric System in France,\" in Norton W.

Marsenne, in the seventeenth-century spirit of exactitude, calculated\nthat a striked boisseau held 172,000 grains of wheat, whereas a heaped measure\nheld 220,160 (Kula, Measures and Men, p. 172). The advantage with oats, a\nlarger grain, is less.\n\n47\\. Ibid., pp. 73-74. As with the other challenges to customary measures,\nthis one provoked municipal authorities and the populace to insist on weighing\nand measuring, in this case bakers' loaves, to prevent such practices.\n\n48\\. Ibid., pp. 98-99.\n\n49\\. Ibid., p. 173.\n\n50\\. It was, in fact, the active evasion of regions that were fiscally hard-\npressed that provided the \"drag\" or gyroscope that often prevented an ill-\nconsidered tax claim from provoking an actual resistance.\n\n51\\. As Ken Alder points out, the absence of a central authority that could\nimpose standardization does not seem to have impeded the growth of national\nmarkets in Britain, Germany, or the United States (\"A Revolution Made to\nMeasure,\" p. 62). Mobility and economic growth alone seem to produce common\nstandards of exchange. For a more general historical treatment, see Frank J.\nSwetz, Capitalism and Arithmetic: The New Math of the Fifteenth Century (La\nSalle, Ill.: Open Court, 1987).\n\n52\\.

The meter was only one shell in a barrage of measurement\nreforms. For a time, there was a concerted effort to divide the day into ten\nhours of one hundred minutes, with each minute containing one hundred seconds,\nas well as an initiative to create a duodecimal, or base-twelve, system of\nnumbers.\n\n56\\. Ibid., pp. 122-23.\n\n57\\. I believe that the recent impassioned debate in France about whether\nMuslim schoolgirls should be allowed to wear head scarves in class was about\npreserving this tradition of the unmarked citizen in secular education.\n\n58\\. Alder, \"A Revolution Made to Measure,\" p. 211.\n\n59\\. As Tony Judt has astutely noted, the difference between citizens' rights\nas established by revolutionary decrees and natural or individual rights is\nthat the former are in principle contingent on the state and its law and hence\nrevocable by statute, whereas the latter are in principle unabridgeable. See\nJudt, Past Imperfect: French Intellectuals, 1944-1956 (Berkeley: University of\nCalifornia Press, 1992).\n\n60\\. The revolutionary conception of citizenship in France swept away the\nlegal impediments under which the Jewish community had labored. Wherever\nFrench armies penetrated after the Revolution and in the Napoleonic conquests,\ntheir arrival was accompanied by the extension of full citizenship to Jews.\nSee Pierre Birn- baum and Ira Katznelson, eds., Paths of Emancipation: Jews,\nStates, and Citizenship (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995).\n\n61\\. Gianfranco Poggi, The Development of the Modern State: A Sociological\nIntroduction (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1978), p. 78. For all the\nadvance in human rights that equal citizenship carried with it, it is worth\nrecalling that this momentous step also undercut the intermediary structures\nbetween the state and the citizen and gave the state, for the first time,\ndirect access to its subjects. Equal citizenship implied not only legal\nequality and universal male suffrage but also universal conscription, as those\nmobilized into Napoleon's armies were shortly to discover. From the heights of\nthe state, the society below increasingly appeared as an endless series of\nnationally equal particuliers with whom it dealt in their capacity as\nsubjects, taxpayers, and potential military draftees.\n\n62\\. Quoted in Kula, Measures and Men, p. 286.\n\n63\\. As E. P. Thompson wrote in Whigs and Hunters: The Origin of the Black Act\n(New York: Pantheon, 1975): \"During the eighteenth century one legal decision\nafter another signaled that the lawyers had become converted to notions of\nabsolute property ownership, and that (wherever the least doubt could be\nfound) the law abhorred the messy complexities of coincident use-right\" (p.\n241).\n\n64\\. The code civil did not deal with agriculture explicitly, with one\nexception: it specified guidelines for tenant farming (fermage), in\nrecognition of the wealthy and influential large tenants in the Paris basin\nand to the north. I am grateful to Peter Jones for bringing to my attention\nthe study on which this brief discussion is based: Serge Aberdam, Aux origines\ndu code rural, 1789-1900: Un siecle de debat (n.d., but probably 1978-80).\n\n65\\. \"En resume, la ligne generale du projet de 1807 est de refuser toute\nspecificite au droit rural en ramenant, autant que possible, les rapports\nsocieux a la campagne a la forme d'authorite legale que la bourgeoisie\nprojette sur l'ensemble de la population\" (In brief, the general policy of the\nproposal of 1807 is to deny any particularity to rural law, placing rural\nsocial relations as much as possible in the context of the legal authority\nthat the bourgeoisie applied to the population as a whole [my translation];\nibid., p. 19).\n\n66\\. No such political scruples were in evidence in the colonies, where\nadministrative convenience and commercial logic prevailed over popular opinion\nand practice. See, for example, the fine case study by Dennis Galvan, \"Land\nPawning as a Response to the Standardization of Tenure,\" chap. 4 of \"The State\nIs Now Master of Fire: Peasant Lore, Land Tenure, and Institutional Adaptation\nin the Siin Region of Senegal\" (Ph.D. dirs., Department of Political Science,\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, 1996).\n\n67\\. Ibid., p. 18.\n\n68\\. Ibid., p. 22.\n\n69\\. In colonial Vietnam, the head tax, or capitation, was levied on whole\ncommunities on the basis of their presumed population. If the sum were not\nremitted, the police would come and hold an auction of whatever they could\nseize (e.g., water buffalos, furniture, jewelry) until they had the required\nsum. This system gave the village notables, who owned most of the goods worth\nseizing, an incentive to make sure that the taxes were remitted on time.\n\n70\\. This generalization also has validity for modern socialist forms of\ncollective farming. A considerable amount of farmland, for example,\n\"disappeared\" from the books when Hungary's collective farms were created; see\nIstvan Rev, \"The Advantages of Being Atomized: How Hungarian Peasants Coped\nwith Collectivization,\" Dissent 34 (Summer 1987): 335-49. In China, after the\ndeadly Great Leap Forward, many collective farms systematically hid production\nfrom central authorities in the interest of local survival; see Daniel\nKelliher, Peasant Power in China (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992).\n\n71\\. Cadastral surveys might also be undertaken by aristocratic holders of\nlarge fiefs who were convinced that they could thereby uncover taxable land\nand subjects who had hitherto eluded them.\n\n72\\. Both the Danish and Norwegian examples are from the valuable historical\nanalysis in Roger J. P. Kain and Elizabeth Baigent, The Cadastral Map in the\nService of the State: A History of Property Mapping (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press, 1992), p. 116.\n\n73\\. The great efficiency of the Hutterite grain farmers in the northern\nPlains states and Canada is but one of many pieces of conflicting evidence.\nFor more, see George Yaney, The Urge to Mobilize: Agrarian Reform in Russia\n(Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1982), pp. 165-69.\n\n74\\. A contemporary example from Mexico can be found in a fine analysis by\nSergio Zendejas in \"Contested Appropriation of Governmental Reforms in the\nMexican Countryside: The Ejido as an Arena of Confrontation of Political\nPractices,\" in Sergio Zendejas and Pieter de Vries, eds., Rural Transformation\nas Seen from Below: Regional and Local Perspectives from Western Mexico (La\nJolla, Calif.: Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, University of California, San\nDiego, 1997). As Zendejas shows, the ejido system emerging from the Mexican\nrevolution has had the effect of depriving the state of a great deal of\nknowledge about agricultural patterns, house lots, or village common-land\ntenure in most of the twenty-eight thousand ejidos in the country. Michoacan\nvillagers have regarded a national program to survey, register, and title\nevery plot of rural land as a prelude to the individualization of property\nrights, the division of the common lands, and the imposition of property\ntaxes, and they have therefore resisted having their lands measured. Under the\nchanges made to article 27 of the constitution, which envisions a national,\nfreehold land market, their fears have proven justified. It has not been a\nquestion of establishing local land markets; as one villager said, \"Haven't we\nalways been selling and renting [ejido] parcels with or without certificates?\"\nIt has been, rather, a question of creating a regional and national market for\nland, backed by state power. To do this, the first task of the state has been\nto make legible a tenure landscape that the local autonomy achieved by the\nrevolution had helped make opaque. See also, in this context, Luin Goldring,\nHaving One's Cake and Eating It, Too: Selective Appropriation of Ejido Reform\nin an Urbanizing Ejido in Michoacan (forthcoming).\n\n75\\. Here I am guilty of conveying a false sense of uniformity. In fact, there\nwere a host of land arrangements, even in \"black earth\" Russia, and many\nvillages did not redistribute land (Yaney, The Urge to Mobilize, p. 169).\n\n76\\. Ibid., p. 212.\n\n77\\. Yaney points out that Mennonite land that was interstripped was just as\nproductive as Mennonite land that was organized into consolidated farms\n(ibid., p. 160).\n\n78\\. And not always in such newly settled lands, inasmuch as group land\nsettlement, with common property and against the government's wishes, was also\ncommon.\n\n79\\. Ibid., chaps. 7 and 8. The Peasant Bank, under great pressure to loan\nmoney to poor peasants, inadvertently encouraged the older allotment system.\nThe bank needed collateral that it could seize in the event of default, but\npoorer peasants farming allotment land had no fixed land that could serve as\nsecurity. Faced with this quandary, the bank found itself loaning to whole\nvillages or to groups of peasants farming adjacent, identifiable plots. It is\nworth noting that, like the modern tax system, the modern credit system\nrequires a legible property regime for its functioning.\n\n80\\. Ibid., pp. 412-42.\n\n81\\.

Before comprehensive cadastral surveys, some land was open to all and\nbelonged to no one, though social arrangements might regulate its use. With\nthe first cadastral map, such land was generally designated as state land. All\nland was accounted for; everything not owned privately became the property of\nthe state.\n\n83\\. Kain and Biagent, The Cadastral Map, p. 33. Seas, rivers, and wastes were\nto be omitted since they did not bear revenue. The whole operation was guided\nby a manual entitled Mode d'arpentage pour l'impot foncier.\n\n84\\. Quoted in ibid., p. 5.\n\n85\\. In a Third World setting, as Peter Vandergeest points out, a cadastral or\nland-use map using global positioning technology allows experts to formulate\nlanduse policies and rules without having the inconvenience of visiting the\nterrain itself (\"Mapping Resource Claims, or, The Seductive Appeal of Maps:\nThe Use of Maps in the Transformation of Resource Tenure,\" paper presented at\na meeting of the Association for the Study of Common Property, Berkeley, June\n1996).\n\n86\\. The land itself occasionally moves, due to landslides, erosion, avulsion,\nand accretion. For an interesting account of property law as it tries to deal\nwith the \"mobility\" of its subject, see Theodore Steinberg, Slide Mountain, or\nThe Folly of Owning Nature (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995).\n\n87\\. In an earlier work, I examined this problem in some detail in its\nSoutheast Asian context. See Scott, The Moral Economy of the Peasant, chap. 4.\n\n88\\. In 1785 Austria's Franz Joseph had to choose between using net income or\ngross income as a basis for land taxation. Gross income was chosen because it\nwas far simpler (e.g., average crop per unit of land x units of land x average\ngrain price = gross income). It was necessary to sacrifice accuracy and\nfairness to create a procedure that was administratively feasible. See Kain\nand Biagent, The Cadastral Map, p. 193.\n\n89\\. Ibid., p. 59.\n\n90\\. Issue of mineral rights and mineral income from subsoil deposits was a\nsignificant exception to this generalization.\n\n91\\.

As\nGuha notes, the existing system of tenure that the British colonial rulers\nencountered in the eighteenth century was completely mystifying: \"At every\nstep they came up against quasi-feudal rights and obligations which defied any\nattempt at interpretation in familiar western terms. The hieroglyphics of\nPersian estate-accounts baffled them. It was only a part of the difficulty\nthat they could not easily master the languages in which the ancient and\nmedieval texts relating to the laws of property were written; for tradition\nrecorded only in memory and customs embedded in a variety of local usages\nwielded an authority equal to that of any written code\" (p. 13).\n\n93\\. For a remarkably thoughtful and thorough examination of how the colonial\nlegal code transformed land-dispute settlement, land tenure, and social\nstructure, see Sally Falk Moore, Social Facts and Fabrications: \"Customary\"\nLaw on Mount Kilimanjaro, 1880-1980 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1986).\n\n94\\. The combination of a complete cadastral register, freehold tenure, and a\nnational market in land makes for a level of legibility that is as\nadvantageous to the land speculator as it is to the tax collector.\nCommoditization in general, by denom inating all goods and services according\nto a common currency, makes for what Tilly has called the \"visibility [of] a\ncommercial economy.\" He writes, \"In an economy where only a small share of\ngoods and services are bought and sold, a number of conditions prevail:\ncollectors of revenue are unable to observe or evaluate resources with any\naccuracy, [and] many people have claims on any particular resource\" (Coercion,\nCapital, and European States, pp. 89, 85).\n\n95\\. The equality was, of course, purely areal. See Kain and Biagent, The\nCadastral Map, p. 225. Colbert's Forest Code of 1667 was also the first\ncoherent attempt to codify forest space in France along sharp Cartesian lines.\nIn this connection, see Sahlins, Forest Rites, p. 14.\n\n96\\. In Malaysia, Chinese are legally barred from owning certain kinds of\nagricultural land. To get around this barrier, a Chinese man will register\nland in the name of a Malay confederate. To ensure that the confederate does\nnot attempt to exercise his formal property rights, he will simultaneously\nsign loan papers worth far more than the property, with the Chinese man named\nas creditor.\n\n97\\. Revolutionary legislation in France, rather than abolishing tithes\noutright, attempted to phase them out with temporary \"tithe redemption\npayments.\" Popular defiance was so massive and intractable that the payments\nwere finally abandoned.

The fiction that North American and Australian landscapes were\nessentially empty, which in turn meant that they were not being used as a\nfactor of production in market exchange, was the basis on which such lands\nwere \"redesig- nated.\" This is a fiction that joins the Highland Clearances\nand the expropriation of land from Native Americans, New Zealand Maoris,\nAustralian native peoples, Argentine indigenous peoples, and so on.\n\n100\\.

The inability of many U.S. municipal authorities to effectively govern\ninner cities has prompted attempts to bring back the \"cop on the beat\" in the\nform of .community policing.\" The purpose of community policing is to create a\ncadre of local police who are intimately familiar with the physical layout of\nthe community and especially the local population, whose assistance is now\njudged vital to effective police work. Its aim is to turn officials who had\ncome to be seen as outsiders into insiders.\n\n4\\. 1 am grateful to Ron Aminzade for sending me the explanatory notes (mem-\noires) meant to accompany two of the maps the military officials had prepared\nas part of this haute reconnaissance in the city of Toulouse in 1843.

The\nBabylonians, Egyptians, and, of course, the Romans built \"grid-settlements\"\nLong before the Enlightenment, right angles were seen as evidence of cultural\nsuperiority. As Richard Sennett writes, \"Hippodamus of Miletus is\nconventionally thought the first city builder to conceive of these grids as\nexpressions of culture; the grid expressed, he believed, the rationality of\ncivilized life. In their military conquests the Romans elaborated the contrast\nbetween the rude and formless camps of the barbarians and their own military\nforts, or castra\" (The Conscience of the Eye: The Design and Social Life of\nCities [New York: Norton, 1990], p. 47).\n\n11\\. Well, almost. There are a few streets-among them Lincoln, Archer, and\nBlue Island-that follow old Indian trails and thus deviate from the geometric\nlogic.\n\n12\\. It may have occurred to the reader that certain grid sections of upper\nManhattan and Chicago are, despite their formal order, essentially ungoverned\nand dangerous. No amount of formal order can overcome massive countervailing\nfactors such as poverty, crime, social disorganization, or hostility toward\nofficials. As a sign of the illegibility of such areas, the Census Bureau\nacknowledges that the number of uncounted African-Americans was six times the\nnumber of uncounted whites. The undercount is politically volatile since\ncensus figures determine the number of congressional seats to which a state is\nentitled.\n\n13\\.

There was an older, quasi-planned, baroque city bequeathed to Paris by\nher absolutist rulers, especially those prior to Louis XIV, who for his part\nchose to lavish his planning on a \"new space,\" Versailles.\n\n18\\. As Mark Girouard notes, the plan included public facilities and\ninstitutions such as parks (notably the huge Bois de Boulogne), hospitals,\nschools, colleges, barracks, prisons, and a new opera house (Cities and\nPeople: A Social and Architectural History [New Haven: Yale University Press,\n19851, p. 289).

Mumford writes, \"Were not the ancient medieval streets of Paris one of\nthe last refuges of urban liberties?

The parallels with the later\nceinture rouge, the leftist working-class suburbs ringing Paris, are striking.\nSoweto and other black townships in South Africa under apartheid, although\nestablished explicitly for the purposes of segregation, also became illegible,\nsubversive spaces from the perspective of the authorities.\n\n22\\. Since the planners lacked a reliable map of the city, the first step was\nto build temporary wooden towers in order to achieve the triangulation\nnecessary for an accurate map. See David H.

A commonplace of demographic history has\nbeen that urban populations in Western Europe, beset with epidemics and\ngenerally high mortality, did not successfully reproduce themselves until well\ninto the nineteenth century; the growth of cities came largely from in-\nmigration from the healthier countryside. Although this position has been\nchallenged, the evidence for it is still convincing.

See Anderson, Imagined Comunities: Reflections on\nthe Origin and Spread of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1983), and also the\nremarkable book by Thongchai Winichakul, Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-\nBodv of a Nation (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1994).\n\n37\\. See, for example, William E. Wormsley, \"Traditional Change in Imbonggu\nNames and Naming Practices,\" Names 28 (1980): 183-94.\n\n38\\. The adoption of permanent, inherited patronyms went far, but not the\nwhole way. How is a state to associate a name, however unique and unambiguous,\nwith an individual? Like identity cards, social security numbers, and pass\nsystems, names require that the citizenry cooperate by carrying them and\nproducing them on the demand of an official. Cooperation is secured in most\nmodern state systems by making a clear identity a prerequisite for receiving\nentitlements; in more coercive systems, harsh penalties are exacted for\nfailure to carry identification documents. If, however, there is widespread\ndefiance, individuals will either fail to identify themselves or use false\nidentities. The ultimate identity card, then, is an ineradicable mark on the\nbody: a tattoo, a fingerprint, a DNA \"signature\"\n\n39\\. I am especially grateful to Bill Jenner and Ian Wilson of the Australian\nNational University and to Paul Smith of Haverford College for their generous\nadvice about China. The Qin and Han administrative plans for population\nregistration were ambitious, but how completely their goals were realized in\npractice remains an important question. Jenner contends that the goals were\nlargely realized, whereas Alexander Woodside claims that slippage must have\nbeen considerable.\n\n40\\. See, for example, W. J. F. Jenner, \"Freedom and Backwardness: Europe and\nChina,\" paper delivered at \"Ideas of Freedom in Asia,\" Humanities Research\nCentre, Australian National University, July 4-6, 1994; and Patricia Ebrey,\nThe Chinese Family and the Spread of Confucian Values,\" in Gilbert Rozman,\ned., The East Asian Region: Confucian Heritage and Its Modern Adaptation\n(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991), pp. 45-83.\n\n41\\.

To my knowledge, Iceland is the only European nation that had not adopted\npermanent surnames by the late twentieth century.\n\n44\\. This account of the Florentine census is drawn entirely from David\nHerlihy and Christiane Klapisch-Zuber, Tuscans and Their Families: A Study of\nthe Florentine Catasto of 1427 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985).\n\n45\\. The matter of age, like the matter of landholding, was a vastly different\nconcept in the state's hands than it was in popular practice. See ibid., pp.\n162-69. In local practice, exact ages were unimportant. Approximate ages and\nbirth order (e.g., oldest son, youngest son) were more useful; in the catasto\nthis is reflected by the tendency to declare ages in units of five or ten\nyears (e.g., thirty-five, forty, fortyfive, fifty, and sixty years). For the\nstate, however, exact age was important for several reasons. The age of\n\"fiscal adulthood\" as well as liability for conscription was eighteen, and,\nbeyond age sixty, one was no longer responsible for capitation taxes. As one\nmight expect, there was a demographically improbable clustering of\ndeclarations just below age eighteen and just above sixty. Like the surname,\nthe designation of age, in the strict, linear, chronological sense, originates\nas a state project.\n\n46\\. In the West, women, domestic servants, and tied laborers were typically\nthe last to adopt surnames (and to be given the vote), because they were\nlegally subsumed as minors in the charge of the male head of family.\n\n47\\. Other surnames referring to fathers are not quite so obvious. Thus the\nname \"Victor Hugo\" would originally have meant simply \"Victor, son of Hugo.\"\n\n48\\. 1 am indebted to Kate Stanton, an astute research assistant, for her\nbackground research on this issue.\n\n49\\. See C. M. Matthews, English Surnames (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson,\n1966), pp. 35-48.\n\n50\\. As Matthews notes, \"The humble peasant with only one virgate of land was\nas anxious to claim it by right of being his father's eldest son as the rich\nman inheriting a large estate. The land could be claimed and awarded only at\nthe Manorial Court, being held 'by copy of the Court Roll' [that is, being a\ncopyhold], which meant that the life tenant's name was inscribed there on\npermanent record. This system provided a direct incentive to men to keep the\nsame surname that had been put down on the roll for their father and\ngrandfather\" (ibid., p. 44). And given the vagaries of the mortality rate in\nfourteenth-century England, younger sons might want to keep the name as well,\njust in case.\n\n51\\. In historical documents one can occasionally glimpse a moment when a\npermanent surname seems to gel. Under Henry VIII in the early sixteenth\ncentury, for example, a Welshman who appeared in court was asked for his name,\nand he answered, in the Welsh fashion, \"Thomas Ap [son of] William, Ap Thomas,\nAp Richard, Ap Hoel, Ap Evan Vaughan.\" He was scolded by the judge, who\ninstructed him to \"leave the old manner... whereupon he after called himself\nMoston, according to the name of his principal house, and left that name to\nhis posteritie\" (William Camden, Remains Concerning Britain, ed. R. D. Dunn\n[1605; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984], p. 122). This\n\"administrative\" last name almost certainly remained unknown to Thomas's\nneighbors.\n\n52\\. See the classic study by Rodney Hilton, Bond Men Made Free: Medieval\nPeasant Movements and the English Rising of 1381 (New York: Viking Press,\n1977), pp. 160-64.\n\n53\\.

For the best treatment of permanent patronyms in France and their\nrelation to state-building, see the insightful book by Anne Lefebvre-Teillard,\nLe nom: Droit et histoire (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1990). She\nexamines the process whereby state officials, both administrative and\njudicial, gradually authorized certain naming practices and limited the\nconditions under which names might be changed. The civil registers, along with\nthe livret de fantille (family pass book), established toward the end of the\nnineteenth century, became important tools for police administration,\nconscription, civil and criminal justice, and elections monitoring. The\nstandard opening line of an encounter between a policeman and a civilian-\"Vos\npapiers, Monsieur\"-dates from this period. Having experienced the \"blinding\"\nof the administration caused by the destruction of civil registers in the\nburning of the Hotel de Ville (city hall) and the Palais de Justice at the end\nof the Commune in 1871, officials took care to keep duplicate registers.\n\n60\\. Robert Chazon, \"Names: Medieval Period and Establishment of Surnames,\"\nEncyclopedia Judaica (Jerusalem and Philadelphia: Keter Publishers and Coronet\nBooks, 1982), 12:809- 13. In the 1930s the Nazis passed a series of \"name\ndecrees\" whose sole purpose was to distinguish what they had determined as the\nJewish population from the Gentile population. Jews who had Aryan-sounding\nnames were required to change them (or to add \"Israel\" or \"Sarah\"), as were\nAryans who had Jewish-sounding names. Lists of approved names were compiled,\nand contested cases were submitted to the Reich Office for Genealogical\nResearch. Once the administrative exercise was complete, a person's name alone\ncould single out him or her for deportation or execution. See Robert M.\nRennick, \"The Nazi Name Decrees of the Nineteen Thirties,\" Journal of the\nAmerican Name Society 16 (1968): 65-88.\n\n61\\. Turkey, for example, adopted surnames only in the 1920s as a part of\nAtaturk's modernization campaign. Suits, hats (rather than fezzes), permanent\nlast names, and modern nationhood all fit together in Ataturk's scheme. Reze\nShah, the father of the deposed Shah, ordered all Iranians to take the last\nname of their town of residence in order to rationalize the country's family\nnames. Ali Akbar Rafsan jani thus means All Akbar from Rafsanjan. Although\nthis system has the advantage of designating the homes of the generation that\nadopted it, it certainly doesn't clarify much locally in Rafsanjan. It may\nwell be that the state is particularly concerned with monitoring those who are\nmobile or \"out of place.\"\n\n62\\. Dietary laws that all but preclude commensality are also powerful devices\nfor social exclusion. If one were designating a set of cultural rules in order\nto wall off a group from surrounding groups, making sure its members cannot\neasily speak to or eat with others is a splendid beginning.\n\n63\\. This is true despite the fact, as Benedict Anderson insightfully points\nout, that the \"national past\" is so often fitted with a bogus pedigree.\n\n64\\. Eugen Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France,\n1870-1914 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1976), chap. 6. Weber points\nout that in the last twenty-five years of the nineteenth century, fully half\nof the Frenchmen reaching adulthood had a native tongue other than French. See\nPeter Sahlins's remarkable book Boundaries: The Making of France and Spain in\nthe Pyrenees (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989) for a discussion\nof French language policy at its periphery. Although administrative official\nlanguages have a lineage that goes back to at least the sixteenth century, the\nimposition of a national language in other spheres comes in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury at the earliest.\n\n65\\.

Some of this history can be\nfound in Francois Caron, Histoire de l'exploitation d'un grand reseau: La\ncompagnie des chemins de fer du Nord (Paris: Mouton, 1973), and Louis-Maurice\nJouffroy, L'ere du rail (Paris: A.

The technical affinity of rail travel to straight lines and exact\ntimetables becomes, along with \"streamlining,\" an important aesthetic in\nmodernism generally.\n\n74\\. Smith, \"The Longest Run.\" pp. 685-71. Smith claims that the Legrand Star\nmeant that many reservists being mustered for World War I had to funnel\nthrough Paris, whereas, under a more decentralized rail plan, there would have\nbeen far more direct routes to the front: \"Some reservists in Strasbourg\n[were] journeying via the capital to don their uniforms in Bordeaux before\nreturning to fight in Alsace.\" General Von Moltke observed that he had six\ndifferent rail lines for moving troops from the North German Confederation to\nthe war zone between the Moselle and the Rhine, while French troops coming to\nthe front had to detrain at Strasbourg or Metz, with the Vosges mountains in\nbetween. Finally, and perhaps most important, once Paris was surrounded, the\nLegrand Star was left headless. After the war, the high command insisted on\nbuilding more transverse lines to correct the deficiency.\n\n75\\.

Since, as we know best from the case of Anne Frank, a good many citizens\nwere willing to hide Jews in the city and the countryside, deportation as a\nsystematic administrative exercise eventually failed. As the Jewish population\nbecame increasingly opaque to the authorities, they were increasingly forced\nto rely on Dutch collaborators who became their local trackers.\n\n79\\. Even when these facts appear dynamic, they are usually the result of\nmultiple static observations through time that, through a \"connect the dots\"\nprocess, give the appearance of continuous movement. In fact, what actually\nhappened between, say, observation A and observation B remains a mystery,\nwhich is glossed over by the convention of merely drawing a straight line\nbetween the two data points.\n\n80\\. This is the way that Benedict Anderson puts it in Imagined Communities,\np. 169.\n\n81\\. I am grateful to Larry Lohmann for insisting to me that officials are not\nnecessarily any more abstract or narrow of vision in their representation of\nreality than laypeople are. Rather, the facts that they need are facts that\nserve the interests and practices of their institutional roles. He would have\npreferred, I think, that I drop the term \"simplification\" altogether, but I\nhave resisted.\n\n82\\. There are at least three problems here. The first is the hegemony of the\ncategories. How does one classify someone who usually works for relatives, who\nmay sometimes feed him, let him use some of their land as his own, or pay him\nin crops or cash? The sometimes quite arbitrary decisions about how to\nclassify such cases are obscured by the final result, in which only the\nprevailing categories appear. Theodore Porter notes that officials in France's\nOffice of National Statistics report that even trained coders will code up to\n20 percent of occupational categories differently (Trust in Numbers, p. 41).\nThe goal of the statistical office is to ensure the maximum reliability among\ncoders, even if the conventions applied to achieve it sacrifice something of\nthe true state of affairs. The second problem, to which we shall return later,\nis how the categories and, more particularly, the state power behind the\ncategories shape the data. For example, during the recession in the United\nStates in the 1970s, there was some concern that the official unemployment\nrate, which had reached 13 percent, was exaggerated. A major reason, it was\nclaimed, was that many nominally unemployed were working \"off the books\" in\nthe informal economy and were not reporting their income or employment for\nfear of being taxed. One could say then and today that the fiscal system had\nprovoked an offstage reality that was designed to stay out of the data bank.\nThe third problem is that those who collect and assemble the information may\nhave special interests in what the data show. During the Vietnam War the\nimportance of body counts and pacified villages as a measure of\ncounterinsurgency success led commanders to produce inflated figures that\npleased their superiors-in the short run-but increasingly bore little relation\nto the facts on the ground.\n\n83\\. The goal is to get rid of intersubjective variability on the part of the\ncensus takers or coders. And that requires standard, mechanical procedures\nthat leave no room for personal judgment. See Porter, Trust in Numbers, p. 29.\n\n84\\. Charles Tilly, Coercion, Capital, and European States, A.D. 990-1992\n(Oxford: Blackwell, 1990), p. 100.\n\n85\\. Indicative of this tendency in scientific forestry is the substantial\nliterature on \"optimum control theory,\" which is imported from management\nscience. For an application and bibliography, see D. M. Donnelly and D. R.\nBetters, \"Optimum Control for Scheduling Final Harvest in Even-Aged Forest\nStands,\" Forest Ecology and Management 46 (1991): 135-49.\n\n86\\. The caricature is not so far-fetched that it does not capture the lyrical\nutopianism of early advocates of state sciences. I quote the father of\nPrussian statistics, Ernst Engel: \"In order to obtain an accurate\nrepresentation, statistical research accompanies the individual through his\nentire earthly existence. It takes account of his birth, his baptism, his\nvaccination, his schooling and the success thereof, his diligence, his leave\nof school, his subsequent education and development, and, once he becomes a\nman, his physique and his ability to bear arms. It also accompanies the\nsubsequent steps of his walk through life; it takes note of his chosen\noccupation, where he sets up his household and his management of the same, if\nhe saved from the abundances of his youth for his old age, if and when and at\nwhat age he marries and whom he chooses as his wife-statistics look after him\nwhen things go well for him and when they go awry. Should he suffer shipwreck\nin his life, undergo material, moral, or spiritual ruin, statistics take note\nof the same. Statistics leave a man only after his death-after it has\nascertained the precise age of his death and noted the causes that brought\nabout his end\" (quoted in Ian Hacking, The Taming of Chance [Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1990], p. 34). One could hardly ask for a more\ncomplete list of early nineteenth-century state interests and the paper trail\nthat it generated.\n\n87\\. Tilly, echoing the colonial theme, describes much of this process within\nthe European nation-state as the replacement of indirect rule with direct rule\n(Coercion, Capital, and European States, pp. 103-26).\n\n88\\. Donald Chisholm, Coordination Without Hierarchy: Informal Structures in\nMultiorganizational Systems (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989),\np. 10.\n\n89\\. This process is best described by Benedict Anderson: \"Guided by its [the\ncolonial state's] imagined map, it organized the new educational, juridical,\npublichealth, police and immigration bureaucracies it was building on the\nprinciple of ethno-racial hierarchies which were, however, always understood\nin terms of parallel series. The flow of subject populations through the mesh\nof differential schools, courts, clinics, police stations and immigration\noffices created 'traffic-habits' which in time gave real social life to the\nstate's earlier fantasies\" (Imagined Communities, p. 169). A related argument\nabout the cultural dimension of state-building in England can be found in\nPhilip Corrigan and Derek Sayer, The Great Arch: English State Formation as\nCultural Revolution (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991).\n\n###### Chapter 3: Authoritarian High Modernism\n\n1\\. My colleague Paul Landau recalls the story by Borges in which a king,\nunhappy at maps that do not do justice to his kingdom, finally insists on a\nmap with a scale of one-to-one. When complete, the new map exactly covers the\nexisting kingdom, submerging the real one beneath its representation.\n\n2\\. A commonplace example may help. One of the ordinary frustrations of the\nmodern citizen, even in liberal democracies, is the difficulty of representing\nhis unique case to a powerful agent of a bureaucratic institution. But the\nfunctionary operates with a simplified grid designed to cover all the cases\nthat she confronts. Once a decision has been made as to which \"bin\" or\n\"pigeonhole\" the case falls into, the action to be taken or the protocol to be\nfollowed is largely cut-and-dried. The functionary endeavors to sort the case\ninto the appropriate category, while the citizen resists being treated as an\ninstance of a category and tries to insist, often unsuccessfully, that his\nunique case be examined on its singular merits.\n\n3\\. I have borrowed the term \"high modernism\" from David Harvey, The Condition\nof Post-Modernity: An Enquiry into the Origins of Social Change (Oxford: Basil\nBlackwell, 1989). Harvey locates the high-water mark of this sort of modernism\nin the post-World War II period, and his concern is particularly with\ncapitalism and the organization of production. But his description of high\nmodernism also works well here: \"The belief 'in linear progress, absolute\ntruths, and rational planning of ideal social orders' under standardized\nconditions of knowledge and production was particularly strong. The modernism\nthat resulted was, as a result, 'positivistic, technocratic, and\nrationalistic' at the same time as it was imposed as the work of an elite\navant-garde of planners, artists, architects, critics, and other guardians of\nhigh taste. The 'modernization' of European economies proceeded apace, while\nthe whole thrust of international politics and trade was justified as bringing\na benevolent and progressive 'modernization process' to a backward Third\nWorld\" (p. 35).\n\n4\\. For case studies of \"public entrepreneurs\" in the United States, see\nEugene Lewis's study of Hyman Rickover, J. Edgar Hoover, and Robert Moses,\nPublic Entrepreneurs: Toward a Theory of Bureaucratic Political Power: The\nOrganizational Lives of Hyman Rickover, J. Edgar Hoover, and Robert Moses\n(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1980).\n\nMonnet, like Rathenau, had experience in economic mobilization during World\nWar I, when he helped organize the transatlantic supply of war material for\nBritian and France, a role that he resumed during World War II. By the time he\nhelped plan the postwar integration of French and German coal and steel\nproduction, he had already had several decades of experience in supranational\nmanagement. See Francois Duchene, Jean Monnet: The First Statesman of In (New\nYork: Norton, 1995).\n\n5\\. 1 will not pursue the argument here, but I think Nazism is best understood\nas a reactionary form of modernism. Like the progressive left, the Nazi elites\nhad grandiose visions of state-enforced social engineering, which included, of\ncourse, extermination, expulsion, forced sterilization, and selective breeding\nand which aimed at \"improving\" genetically on human nature. The case for\nNazism as a virulent form of modernism is made brilliantly and convincingly by\nZygmunt Bauman in Modernity and the Holocaust (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 1989). See also, along the same lines, Jeffrey Herf, Reactionary\nModernism: Technology, Culture, and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), and Norbert Frei, National\nSocialist Rule in German v: The Fiihrer State, 1933-1945, trans. Simon B.\nSteync (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993).\n\n6\\. 1 am grateful to James Ferguson for reminding me that reactionary\nhighmodernist schemes are about as ubiquitous as progressive variants.\n\n7\\. This is not by any means meant to be a brief for conservatism.\nConservatives of many stripes may care little for civil liberties and may\nresort to whatever brutalities seem necessary to remain in power. But their\nambitions and hubris are much more limited; their plans (in contrast to those\nof reactionary modernists) do not necessitate turning society upside down to\ncreate new collectivities, new family and group loyalties, and new people.\n\n8\\.

What is new in high modernism, I believe,\nis not so much the aspiration for comprehensive planning. Many imperial and\nabsolutist states have had similar aspirations. What are new are the\nadministrative technology and social knowledge that make it plausible to\nimagine organizing an entire society in ways that only the barracks or the\nmonastery had been organized before. In this respect, Michel Foucault's\nargument, in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, trans. Alan\nSheridan (New York: Vintage Books, 1977), is persuasive.\n\n12\\. Here I want to distinguish between advances in scientific knowledge and\ninventions (many of which occurred in the eighteenth century or earlier) and\nthe massive transformations that scientific inventions wrought in daily\nmaterial life (which came generally in the nineteenth century).\n\n13\\.

Quoted in Ian Hacking, The Tanning of Chance (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1990), p. 38. A few years later, the Jacobins were, one\ncould argue, the first to attempt to actually engineer happiness by\ntransforming the social order. As Saint-Just wrote, \"The idea of happiness is\nnew in Europe.\" See Albert 0.

Hacking, The Taming of Chance, p. 105. Hacking shows brilliantly how a\nstatistical \"average\" metamorphosed into the category \"normal,\" and \"normal,\"\nin turn, into a \"normative\" standard to be achieved by social engineering.\n\n18\\. By now, a great deal of historical research has made crystal clear how\nwidespread throughout the West was the support for eugenic engineering. The\nbelief that the state must intervene to protect the races' physical and mental\ncharacteristics was common among progressives and animated a well-nigh\ninternational social movement. By 1926, twenty-three of the forty-eight U.S.\nstates had laws permitting sterilization.\n\n19\\. See Gareth Stedman-Jones, Languages of Class: Studies in English\nWorkingClass History, 1832-1982 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983).\nIt is important to recognize that, among Western powers, virtually all the\ninitiatives associated with the \"civilizing missions\" of colonialism were\npreceded by comparable programs to assimilate and civilize their own lower-\nclass populations, both rural and urban. The difference, perhaps, is that in\nthe colonial setting officials had greater coercive power over an objectified\nand alien population, thus allowing for greater feats of social engineering.\n\n20\\. For a science-fiction account of the attempt to create a \"technocratic\nand objective man\" who would be free of \"nature,\" see C. S. Lewis, That\nHideous Strength: A Modern Fairy Tale For Grown-Ups (New York: Macmillan,\n1946).\n\n21\\. There is the interesting and problematic case of the \"wild\" garden, in\nwhich the precise shape of \"disorder\" is minutely planned. Here it is a matter\nof an aesthetic plan, designed to have a certain effect on the eye-an attempt\nto copy untended nature. The paradox is just as intractable as that of a zoo\ndesigned to mimic nature-intractable, that is, until one realizes that the\ndesign does not extend to allowing the critters to eat one another!\n\n22\\. Karl Marx, from the Communist Manifesto, quoted in Berman, All That Is\nSolid Melts into Air, p. 95.\n\n23\\. The airplane, having replaced the locomotive, was in many respects the\ndefining image of modernity in the early twentieth century. In 1913, the\nfuturist artist and playwright Kazimir Malevich created the sets for an opera\nentitled Victory over the Sun. In the last scene, the audience heard from\noffstage a propeller's roar and shouts announcing that gravity had been\novercome in futurist countries. Le Corbusier, Malevich's near contemporary,\nthought the airplane was the reigning symbol of the new age. For the influence\nof flight, see Robert Wohl, A Passion for Wings: Aviation and the Wester\nImagination, 1908-1918 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996).\n\n24\\. The Jacobins intended just such a fresh start, starting the calendar\nagain at year one\" and renaming the days and months according to a new,\nsecular system. To signal its intention to create a wholly new Cambodian\nnation, the Pol Pot regime began with \"year zero\"\n\n25\\. Quoted in Harvey, The Condition of Post-Modernity, p. 99.\n\n26\\.

The eye now sees in substance what the mind could\nonly subjectively conceive.

After the war he joined the\nCommunist Party, \"for his hope was that an authoritarian regime would use its\npower to relocate war-devastated cities according to an optimal pattern as\ndemanded by central place theory.\" It was a classic case of the attempt to\nimpose what had begun as a simplified analytical description of the economics\nof location.

Le Corbusier, The Radiant City, p. 181.\n\n31\\. Ibid., p. 154 (emphasis added).\n\n32\\. 1 try to be exceptionally cautious in using such loaded terms as\n\"fascism;' but I think this one is justified here. When Le Corbusier writes of\nthe beauty of the Parthenon, the celebration of violence is just beneath the\nsurface. \"Remember the Parthenon,\" he writes. \"Remember its clarity, its clear\nlines, its intensity, its economy, its violence, remember its great cry in the\nmidst of that landscape created by grace and terror. Strength and purity\"\n(ibid., p. 187 [emphasis added]). Le Corbusier also has the tendency, as we\nshall presently see, to dehumanize his opponents and the urban poor:\n\"Everything depends upon the wisdom of the plans.... I am talking here of a\nsociety that has already provided itself with a planned economy and swept away\nall the parasites present in the society we know today\" (p. 73 [emphasis\nadded]).\n\n33\\. Mumford condemns for its similar hubris the spirit of baroque planning,\nwhich, to a twentieth-century eye, seems far less expansive. In his commentary\non the passage from Descartes (quoted in chapter 1), Mumford contrasts two\norders of thinking: the organic and the mechanical. \"The first springs out of\nthe total situation, the other simplifies the facts of life for the sake of an\nartful system of concepts, more dear to the mind than life itself. One works\ncooperatively with the 'materials of others,' perhaps guiding them, but first\nacknowledging their existence and understanding their purpose; the other, that\nof the baroque despot, insisting on his law, his order, his society, is\nimposed by a single professional authority, working under his command\" (The\nCity in History: Its Origins, Its Transformations, and Its Prospects [New\nYork: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1961 ], p. 394). The appeal of a centrally\nconceived city over a city grown up largely by unplanned accretions stemmed\nnot necessarily from an esprit geon:etrique, as it did with Descartes; the\nplanned city was seen to demonstrate royal power and to be more healthful,\neven in the seventeenth century. Thus John Evelyn, recently back from European\nexile with Charles 11, wrote that London was \"a city consisting of a wooden,\nnorthern, and inartificial congestion of houses, some of its principal streets\nso narrow, as there is nothing more deformed and unlike the prospect of it at\na distance, and its assvrnnietrie within the walls\" (quoted in Mark Jenner,\n\"The Politics of London Air: John Evelyn's Ftunifiigium and the Restoration,\"\nHistorical Journal 38, no. 3 [1995]: 542 [emphasis added]).\n\n34\\. Quoted in Fishman, Urban Utopias, p. 213.\n\n35\\. Le Corbusier was a member of Redressment Fran4ais, a circle of\nindustrialists linked to the right. Regarding this connection and especially\nLe Corbusier's work in the Soviet Union, see Cohen, Le Corbusier and the\nMystique of the USSR.\n\n36\\. Le Corbusier, The Radiant City, p. 131 (emphasis in original). He\ncontinued, \"The power of calculation is such that the imprudent might be\ntempted to raise altars to it forthwith, and worship it\"\n\n37\\. Le Corbusier was particularly proud of the transparency and line of this\nbuilding, which, like many of his buildings in the 1920s, was set up on\npilings (pilotis). Describing it, he wrote, \"Appreciate the entirely new and\nformidable virtues of this architecture; the impeccable line of the\nsubstructure. The building resembles an object in a window display, and it is\nperfectly legible\" (Le Corbusier, \"Les Techniques sont I'assiette meme du\nlyricisme: Elles ouvrent un nouveau cycle de ('architecture;' in Precisions\nsur un etat present de 1'architecture et de l'urbanisme [Paris, 1930], quoted\nin Cohen, Le Corbusier and the Mystique of the ussR, p. 77 [emphasis added]).\n\n38\\. In the end, Le Corbusier was bitter about his Soviet experience: \"On\nseveral occasions I have been asked to draw up plans of cities for the Soviet\nUnion; unfortunately it was all hot air. I am extremely sorry about this.... I\nhave studied the basic social truths in such depth that I have been the first\nto create, in a natural way, THE GREAT CLASSLESS CITY, harmonious and joyful.\nIt sometimes pains me to think that in the USSR I am resisted for reasons that\nto me do not appear to be valid\" (quoted in Cohen, Le Corbusier and the\nMystique of the USSR, p. 199).\n\n39\\. Quoted in ibid., p. 109. In justifying the linear rigor of his Moscow\nplans, Le Corbusier wrote, \"curved lines constitute paralysis, and the winding\npath is the path of donkeys\" (quoted in ibid., p. 15).\n\n40\\. Quoted in ibid., p. 93 (emphasis in original). Like so much of The\nRadiant City, this passage reflects Le Corbusier's constant appeal to the\npolitical authorities who alone can give substance to his plans.\n\n41\\. See Colin Rowe, The Architecture of Good Intentions: Towards a Possible\nRetrospect (London: Academy Editions, 1995), for a discussion of Le Corbusier\nand the concept of the sublime.\n\n42\\.

See Mumford's comment about the Neapolitan king\nFerrante's fear of dark and crooked streets (The City in History, p. 348).\n\n48\\. Le Corbusier, The Radiant City, p. 120. In a whimsical footnote Le\nCorbusier imagines a monument in bronze with Louis XIV, Napoleon I, and\nNapoleon III joining hands in the foreground and a smiling Colbert and\nHaussmann, also holding hands, in the background. With their free hands the\nthree in the foreground raise a scroll bearing the admonition, \"Keep at it,\nfor God's sake.\"\n\n49\\. Ibid., p. 27.\n\n50\\. Ibid., p. 187.\n\n51\\.

See David Harvey, The Condition of Post-Modernity: An Enquiry into the\nOrigins of Social Change (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1989), pp. 35-44. Le\nCorbusier was, after his first two decades of professional work, firmly\nassociated with purism and constructivism. For constructivists, the most\nefficient shape of an object was the ideal shape; decorative touches were\nforbidden, as they only detracted from the pure beauty of functional design.\nThe design of a house conceived in this spirit would begin from the inside,\nwith its function and the available materials determining its shape and look.\nDespite his ideological commitments, Le Corbusier was always concerned with\nthe painterly line of his designs, which he associated with classical or\nnatural forms. In his later years, he forbade the use of the word\n\"functionalism\" in his studio. For discussions of Le Corbusier's early designs\nand intellectual milieu, see Russel Walden, ed., The Open Hand: Essays on Le\nCorbusier (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1975), especially the selections by Charles\nJencks, Anthony Sutcliffe, and Mary Patricia May Sekler.\n\n53\\. Le Corbusier, The Radiant City, p. 121.\n\n54\\. Ibid., p. 128 (emphasis added). Curiously enough, when compared to Le\nCorbusier's grand schemes, his smaller projects seem to have been more\nsuccessful, both aesthetically and practically. In particular, his small\nChapel of Notre Dame du Haut at Ronchamp is considered a brilliant\nachievement, and his early houses at La Chaux-de-Fonds are much admired for\ndecorative features that he later renounced.\n\n55\\. James Holston, The Modernist City: An Anthropological Critique of\nBrasilia (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989).\n\n56\\. Brazil has something of a history of making ambitious plans to claim the\ninterior and then seeing them come to grief. In 1972, the trans-Amazonian\nhighway was opened amid much fanfare (and ecological concern); by the late\n1980s, much of the road was overgrown and impassible.\n\n57\\. Quoted in Lawrence J.

We must kill the street\" (Towards a New Architecture,\ntrans. Frederick Etchells [New York: Praeger, 1959], pp. 56-59).\n\n61\\. See Holston's interesting analysis in The Modernist City, pp. 119-36.\n\n62\\. Ibid., pp. 105-7.

Ibid., p. 149. See also Kevin Lynch, The Image of the City (Cambridge:\nMIT Press, 1960). Lynch's concept of \"imageability\" has more to do with how a\nplace or neighborhood can be \"pictured\" by its inhabitants than the legibility\nit might have to a planner or administrator. The two forms of order might\noften, as Holston reminds us, be negatively correlated.\n\n70\\. Holston, The Modernist City, p. 209.\n\n71\\. Quoted in ibid., p. 210.\n\n72\\. My information about Chandigarh comes from the following sources: Ravi\nKalia, Chandigarh: In Search of an Identity (Carbondale: Southern Illinois\nUniversity Press, 1987), and three articles in Russell Walden, ed., The Open\nHand: Essays on Le Corbusier (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1977): Maxwell Fry, \"Le\nCorbusier at Chandigarh,\" pp. 351-63; Madhu Sarin, \"Chandigarh as a Place to\nLive In;' pp. 375-411; and Stanislaus von Moos, \"The Politics of the Open\nHand: Notes on Le Corbusier and Nehru at Chandigarh,\" pp. 413-57.\n\n73\\. Punjabi politicians also embraced the project, seeing it as compensation\nfor the loss of Lahore, the pre-partition capital of the Punjab, a focus of\nMogul power, and capital of the Sikh kingdom of Ranjit Singh. I'm grateful to\nRamachandra Guha for this information.\n\n74\\. As Maxwell Fry describes it, Le Corbusier was preoccupied at the time\nwith the visual effects of buildings in large spaces. He had brought with him\na plan of the grand axis that joined the Louvre to the Arc de Triomphe via the\nChamps Elysees and tried to work out the farthest extension of grandeur\ncomprehensible, at a single view,\" in the new setting. See Fry, \"Le Corbusier\nat Chandigarh,\" p. 357.\n\n75\\. Sarin, \"Chandigarh as a Place to Live In;\" p. 386.\n\n76\\. See, for example, the book published a decade and a half earlier by\nPercival Goodman and Paul Goodman, Communitas: Means of Livelihood and Ways of\nLife (New York: Vintage Books, 1947), which touches on many of the same themes\nfound in Jacobs's work but which promotes decentralization and appropriate\ntechnology.\n\n77\\. In New York City, Jacobs was seen as a prominent enemy of the master\nbuilder Robert Moses.\n\n78\\. On the other hand, Jacobs had a great deal of knowledge about\narchitecture. She was married to an architect and had worked her way up from\nnewspaper and editing jobs to become associate editor of the journal\nArchitectural Forum.\n\n79\\. An interesting parallel case from the same time period is Rachel Carson's\nSilent Spring (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962). Carson began her influential\nattack on the profligate use of insecticides by asking a homely but powerful\nquestion: \"Where have all the songbirds gone?\"\n\n80\\. Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (New York:\nVintage Books, 1961), p. 15.\n\n81\\. Ibid., p. 376. The early constructivist Le Corbusier would not have\ndisavowed this view as a matter of principle, but as a matter of practice he\nwas always greatly concerned with the sculptural properties of an urban plan\nor a single buildingsometimes with brilliant results, as in Notre-Dame-du-\nHaut, Ronch amp (1953).\n\n82\\. A useful critique of current zoning practice may be found in James Howard\nKunstler, \"Home from Nowhere,\" Atlantic Monthly, September 1996, pp. 43-66.\n\n83\\. Jacobs, Death and Life, p. 375. This seems especially reasonable so long\nas the disciplined works of art one is talking about are those of a Josef\nAlbers rather than a Jackson Pollock. In this connection, it is useful to\nrecall that Le Corbusier began as an artist and never stopped painting.\n\n84\\. Ibid., p. 437.\n\n85\\. Ibid., pp. 31 -32. The recent social science literature on social trust\nand social capital, demonstrating the economic costs of their absence, signals\nthat this homely truth is now a subject of formal inquiry. It is important to\nspecify that Jacobs's point about \"eyes on the street\" assumes a rudimentary\nlevel of community feeling. If the eyes on the street are hostile to some or\nall members of the community, as Talja Potters has reminded me, public\nsecurity is not enhanced.\n\n86\\. Ibid., pp. 38-40. It is worth noting that the linchpin of this informal\nsurveillance and social order is the fast-disappearing and much maligned\npetite bourgeoisie.\n\n87\\. Ibid., pp. 59-62.\n\n88\\. Ibid., pp. 60-61. Jacobs offers a catalogue of nonreimbursed services\nprovided by a typical candy-store proprietor in the course of a single\nmorning, acknowledging that many of these small services allow the shopkeeper\nto further \"entangle\" his or her clientele.\n\n89\\. Ibid., p. 56 (emphasis in original).\n\n90\\. Ibid., pp. 84-88. Jacobs quotes a 1928 regional planning report on recre\nation, which noted that only about one-fourth of the population whose ages\nranged from five to fifteen years actually played in playgrounds, which could\nnot compete with city streets that were \"teeming with life and adventure.\"\n\n91\\. In the modern home, if the kitchen also has a television, its status as\nthe most heavily used room in the home is likely to be without competition.\nTalja Potters, a Dutch colleague, tells me that in working-class apartments\nbuilt in Holland between 1920 and 1970, the dimensions of the kitchen were\ndeliberately minimized so that laborers would be obliged to dine and socialize\nin the living room, like decent middle-class people.\n\n92\\. Jacobs's chapter \"The Need for Small Blocks\" is a model of her mode of\nanalysis. See Death and Life, pp. 178-86.\n\n93\\. Ibid., p. 222.\n\n94\\. Jacobs, in addition to holding several jobs, was a wife and mother in the\n1950s.\n\n95\\. In explaining why children often prefer to play on sidewalks rather than\nin playgrounds, Jacobs writes: \"Most city architectural designers are men.\nCuriously, they design and plan to exclude men as part of normal, daytime life\nwherever people live. In planning residential life, they aim at filling the\npresumed daily needs of impossibly vacuous housewives and preschool tots. They\nplan, in short, strictly for matriarchal societies\" (Death and Life, p. 83).\n\n96\\. Ibid., pp. 372-73 (emphasis in original). Compare Jacobs's critique with\nMumford's criticism of baroque city planning as being \"ruthless, one-sided,\nnoncooperative, ... [and] indifferent to the slow, complex interactions, the\npatient adjustments and modifications, through trial and selection, which mark\nmore organic methods of city development\" (The City in History, p. 350).\n\n97\\. Jacobs, Death and Life, p. 289. For an extensive analysis of the process\nof economic diversification, see Jacobs later book, The Economy of Cities (New\nYork: Random House, 1970). Carol Rose, the legal theorist, makes the\ninteresting point that the visual representations of property-fences, walls,\nhedges, windows, gates-function as a rhetoric of a static and timeless\nproperty that ignores historical change. See Rose, Property and Persuasion:\nEssays in the History, Theory, and Rhetoric of Ownership (Boulder: Westview\nPress, 1994), especially chap. 9, \"Seeing Property,\" pp. 267-303.\n\n98\\. Jacobs, Death and Life, p. 287.\n\n99\\. Ibid., p. 391. The echoes of such influential anarchist thinkers as\nPierreJoseph Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin reverberate in this passage. I do\nnot know whether Jacobs intended these resonances, which may have come from\nthe work of Paul Goodman. But what is missing is a recognition that, in the\nabsence of statebased urban planning, large commercial and speculative\ninterests are transforming the urban landscape every day. The effect of her\nargument is to \"naturalize\" the unplanned city by treating it as the\nconsequence of thousands of small and notionally equal acts.\n\n100\\. Ibid., p. 737.\n\n101\\. Some small components of buildings have of course been mass produced for\na long time, from standard lumber stock, Sheetrock, and shingles to flooring\nand, most famously, nails. Sears and Roebuck home kits were available as early\nas the 1890s.\n\n102\\. Where performance is critical-say, in an army-this logic is superseded\nby other criteria. Thus soldiers will typically have different-sired boots\nthat fit well but haircuts that are identical.\n\n103\\. Jacobs, Death and Life, p. 241.\n\n104\\. Ibid., p. 238. The caveat, \"and only when,\" may be a rare recognition by\nJa cobs that, in the absence of extensive planning in a liberal economy, the\nasymmetrical market forces which shape the city are hardly democratic.\n\n105\\. Ibid., p. 241.\n\n106\\. For an elaboration of this argument applied to urban design, see Michel\nde Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life (Arts de faire: La pratique du\nquotidien), trans. Steven Rendall (Berkeley: University of California Press,\n1984). Another analogy that may be made in this context is to the market,\nalong the lines developed by Friedrich Hayek. The problem that I see with this\nanalogy is that the market in the modern sense is not synonymous with\n\"spontaneous social order,\" but rather had to be imposed by a coercive state\nin the nineteenth century, as Karl Polanyi has convincingly shown. Hayek's\ndescription of the development of common law is, I believe, somewhat closer to\nthe mark. In any event, city, market, and common law are all creators of\nhistorical power relations that are neither \"natural\" nor creative of\n\"spontaneous social order.\" In her telling critique of planning, Jacobs is\nfrequently tempted to naturalize the unplanned city rather as Hayek\nnaturalizes the market.\n\n107\\. Ibid., p. 138.\n\n108\\. Some of Jacobs's insights appear to be behind the early stages of\nrecuperation in a few blighted sections of New York City's South Bronx, once a\nsynonym for the worst in urban decay. A combination of refurbishing existing\nbuildings and apartments, promoting mixed-use development and urban\nhomesteading, making small loans more readily available, and keeping to a\nmodest scale appears to have facilitated the creation of viable neighborhoods.\n\n109\\. Quoted in ibid., pp. 336-37. Tankel's plea appeared in a symposium\ncalled \"The Architecture Forum\" in June 1957.\n\n110\\.

The metaphors of the classroom and the barracks were in keeping with\nLenin's reputation in the party, where his comrades referred to him as \"the\nGerman\" or \"Herr Doktor,\" alluding not so much to his time in Zurich or the\nassistance he received from Germany but simply to \"his tidiness and self-\ndiscipline\" (Conquest, \"The Somber Monster\").\n\n4\\.

In the Tenth Party Congress in 1921, while troops under Trotsky were\ncrushing a genuine proletarian revolt against Bolshevik autocracy, Bukharin\nand others condemned the \"petit-bourgeois infection\" that had spread from the\npeasantry to parts of the working class. See Paul Averich, Kronstadt, 1921\n(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1970), chap. 3, especially pp. 129-30.\n\n22\\. When it came to preventing actual disease and infection, Lenin took it on\nhimself to ensure that the Kremlin was a clean, germ-free environment by\nwriting its sanitary regulations himself. He instructed, for example, that\n\"all those arriving (by train) shall before entering their accommodation take\na bath and hand their dirty clothes to the disinfector at the baths.... Anyone\nrefusing to obey the sanitary regulations will be expelled from the Kremlin at\nonce and tried for causing social harm.\" From Dimitri Volkogonov, Lenin: Life\nand Legacy, trans.

For more on the machine as a metaphor for social movements, see Chap.\n6.\n\n25\\. Nicolae Ceau§escu's nearly built Palace of the Republic in Bucharest\ncontained many design features along these lines. The legislative assembly\nhall had tiered balconies encircling Ceauti'escu's \"hydraulically lifted\npodium, and the palace's six hundred clocks were all centrally set from a\nconsole in Ceausescu's suite (Near York Times, December 5, 1991, p. 2). Lenin,\nin contrast, was always opposed to any cult of personality; the party itself\nwas to be the conductor of the revolutionary orchestra.\n\n26\\. Even so, it should be noted, neither Le Corbusier nor Lenin was of a\nsteady, methodical, bureaucratic temperament.\n\n27\\. Hannah Arendt, On Revolution (New York: Viking, 1965).\n\n28\\. E. H.

Carr extends this judgment to\nall parties in the February Revolution: \"The revolutionary parties played no\ndirect part in the making of the revolution. They did not expect it, and were\nat first somewhat nonplussed by it. The creation at the moment of the\nrevolution of a Petrograd Soviet of Workers' Deputies was a spontaneous act of\ngroups of workers without central direction. It was a revival of the\nPetersburg Soviet which had played a brief but glorious role in the revolution\nof 1905\" (p. 81).\n\n29\\.

See also John\nKeegan, The Face of Battle (New York: Viking Press, 1976).\n\n31\\. The role of autonomous action in driving the revolution forward even\nafter October 1917 was recognized by Lenin when he said, in 1918, 'Anarchist\nideas have now taken on living form.\" See Daniel Guerin, Anarchism: From\nTheory to Practice, trans. Mary Klopper (New York: Monthly Review Press,\n1970), p. 85. Much of the early Bolshevik legislation, Guerin notes, was the\nex post facto legalization of autonmous actions and practices.\n\n32\\.

The official story, even though it may partly shape collective memory,\ncannot entirely supplant the individual and collective experiences of those\nwho actually participated in the revolutionary process. For those who have no\npersonal recollection and who thus come to the revolution via the schoolbook\nor patriotic speech, however, the official story will prevail unless there is\nanother conflicting source of information.\n\n36\\. This is the point of the ditty \"For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for\nwant of a shoe the horse was lost; for want of a horse the messenger was lost;\nfor want of a message the battle was lost; for want of a victory a kingdom was\nlost ...\" (John M. Merriman, ed., For Want off' a Horse: Choice and Chance in\nHistory [Lexington, Mass.: S. Greens Press, 1985]).\n\n37\\. It is exceptionally rare to find any historical account that stresses the\ncontingencies. The very exercise of producing an account of a past event\nvirtually requires an often counterfactual neatness and coherence. Anyone who\nhas ever read a newspaper account of an event in which he or she participated\nwill recognize this phenomenon. Consider, too, the fact that a person who\ncommits murder, say, or who takes his own life by jumping off a bridge will\nthereafter be known as the person who shot so-and-so or the person who jumped\noff such-and-such bridge. The events of that person's life will be reread in\nlight of that ending, with an air of inevitability being given to an act that\nmay have been highly contingent.\n\n38\\. In the case of the Bolshevik Revolution, it was also necessary that the\nofficial narrative include a genuinely popular mass movement of which the\nBolsheviks eventually assumed leadership. Marxist historiography required a\nmilitant, revolutionary proletariat. This was an aspect of the February and\nOctober events that did not have to be invented. What had to be written out of\nthe account, however, was the ferocious struggle between the new state\napparatus on one hand and the autonomous soviets and peasantry on the other.\n\n39\\. Lenin, quoted in Averich, Kronstadt, 1921, p. 160. 1 believe that Lenin\nis consciously copying Luxemburg here, although I have no direct proof. One\ncan find a precedent for this in Lenin's momentary euphoria about the 1905\nrevolution: \"Revolutions are the festival of the oppressed and the\nexploited.... At no other time are the masses of the people in a position to\ncome forward so actively as creators of a new social order as at the time of\nrevolution. At such times, the people are capable of performing miracles\"\n(from \"Two Tactics of Social Democracy,\" quoted by Richard Stites,\nRevolutionary Dreams: Utopian Vision and Experimental Life in the Russian\nRevolution New York: Oxford University Press, 1989], p. 42).\n\n40\\. V. I. Lenin, State and Revolution (New York: International Publishers,\n1931), p. 23 (emphasis in original). Note that those who are to be \"guided\" by\nforce are not the bourgeoisie, the enemies of the revolution, but the\nexploited classes, with the exception of the proletariat, for whom coercion\nwill be unnecessary.\n\nLest one imagine that the state coercion to be applied would be decided\ndemocratically by the proletariat or its representatives, Lenin makes it clear\njust after the revolution that, as Leszek Kolakowski puts it, \"the point about\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat ... is the absolute power, constrained by\nno laws, based on sheer, direct violence. And he said that there would be no\nfreedom and no democracy (those were his very words) until the complete\nvictory of Communism all over the world\" (\"A Calamitous Accident,\" Times\nLiterary Supplement, November 6, 1992, p. 5).\n\n41\\.

See David Harvey, The Condition of Post-Modernity: An Enquiry into the\nOrigins o/ Cultural Change (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1989), p. 126.

In fact, of course, there is no rationally efficient solution to any\nproblem of this kind that ignores human subjectivity. An efficient production\ndesign depends vitally on the positive response of the workforce. The\nautoworkers who hated the \"efficient\" mass-assembly line in Lordsville, Ohio,\nresponded by working so sloppily that they made it an inefficient assembly\nline.\n\n47\\. Lenin, State and Revolution, pp. 84-85 (emphasis in original). Marx,\nEngels, and Lenin used the term \"lumpen\" proletariat to designate all those\nmarginals who had escaped working-class discipline.

Lenin's basic position on agriculture had\nbeen worked out long before in his 1889 book, The Development of Capitalism in\nRussia. That book, however, had predicted a spontaneous development of\ncapitalism in the countryside that had not occurred to anything like the\nextent he had forecast.

The German and Austrian schools of empirical household surveys of farm\noperations were very influential at the turn of the century. The great Russian\neconomist in this tradition was A. V. Chayanov. A careful scholar, a partisan\nof small property (he wrote a utopian novel of his own), and a Soviet\nofficial, he was arrested by the Stalinist police in 1932 and is believed to\nhave been executed in 1936.

H. G.\nWells, following a visit to the Soviet Union, wrote glowingly of his\nconversation with Lenin in October 1920: \"For Lenin, who like a good orthodox\nMarxist denounces all 'Utopians,' has succumbed at last to a Utopia, the\nUtopia of the electricians\" (Russia in the Shadows [New York: George H. Doran,\n1921], p. 158).\n\n56\\. Lenin, The Agrarian Question, p. 46. It is easy today to forget how\nbreathtaking electricity was for those experiencing it for the first time. As\nVladimir Mayakovsky was reported to have said, After electricity, I lost\ninterest in nature\" (Stites, Revolutionary Dreams, p. 52). In fact, for all\nthe activities mentioned by Lenin, the tractor, as a moveable power source\nwithout transmission lines, has proven more practical than electricity.\n\n57\\.

Tucker, ed., The Lenin Anthology (New\nYork: Norton, 1975), p. 494.\n\n58\\. The centralization that electrification makes possible also sets the\nstage for large-scale power failures and brownouts. The practice of this\ntechnical centralization is often in stark, if not comic, contrast to its\nutopian promise. See, for an illuminating example from the Philippines under\nMarcos, Otto van den Muijzenberg, \"As Bright Lights Replace the Kingke: Some\nSociological Aspects of Rural Electrification in the Philippines,\" in Margaret\nM. Skutsch et al., eds., Towards a Sustainable Development (forthcoming).\n\n59\\. As might be expected, the analogy between the light of electricity and\nthe \"enlightenment\" of the narod was often evoked in Soviet rhetoric,\ncombining, as it were, the Bolshevik technical project with its cultural\nproject. Lenin wrote, To the non-Party peasant masses electric light is an\n'unnatural' light; but what we consider unnatural is that the peasants and\nworkers should have lived for hundreds and thousands of years in such\nbackwardness, poverty and oppression under the yoke of the landowners and the\ncapitalists.... What we must now try is to convert every electric power\nstation we build into a stronghold of enlightenment to be used to make the\nmasses electricity-conscious\" (quoted in Tucker, The Lenin Anthology, p. 495).\n\n60\\. Figes, Peasant Russia, Civil War, p. 67.\n\n61\\. Nor did he abandon his belief in the role of violence in ensuring party\nrule. In 1922, when religious believers in provincial Shuya openly\ndemonstrated against the seizure of church treasures, Lenin argued for massive\nretaliation. \"The more of them we manage to shoot the better,\" he declared.\n\"Right now we have to teach this public a lesson so that for several decades\nthey won't even dare think of resisting\" (quoted in John Keep, \"The People's\nTsar,\" Times Literary Supplement, April 7, 1995, p. 30).\n\n62\\.

Wolfe, in Mary-Alice Waters, ed., Rosa Luxemburg Speaks (New York:\nPathfinder Press, 1970), pp. 367-95. It is interesting to speculate how much\nof Luxemburg's faith would have remained had she actually come to power in\nGermany. What is clear, however, is that her view when she was out of power is\nradically different from Lenin's view when he was out of power.\n\n64\\. Elzbieta Ettinger suggests that one likely source of Luxemburg's faith in\nthe wisdom of ordinary workers was her love of the great Polish nationalist\npoet, Adam Mickiewicz, who celebrated the insight and creativity of ordinary\nPoles. See Rosa Luxemburg: A Life (Boston: Beacon Press, 1986), pp. 22-27.\n\n65\\. Luxemburg, \"Mass-Strike, Party, and Trade Unions,\" 4). 229. Despite\nLuxemburg's dismissive reference to anarchism, her views overlap considerably\nwith an anarchist view of the independent, creative role of ordinary actors in\na revolution. See, for example, G. D. Maximoff, ed., The Political Philosophy\nof Bakunin: Scientific Anarchism (New York: Free Press, 1953), p. 289, in\nwhich Bakunin's view of the limitations of leadership by a central committee\nprefigures Luxemburg's own modest opinion of a central committee's role.\n\n66\\. This way of analyzing working-class movements grew directly out of\nLuxemburg's research for her 1898 doctoral thesis at the University of Zurich,\n\"The Industrial Development of Poland.\" See J. P. Nettl, Rosa Luxemburg, vol.\n1 (London: Oxford University Press, 1966).\n\n67\\. Luxemburg, \"Mass-Strike, Party, and Trade Unions,\" p. 236.\n\n68\\. Luxemburg was something of an aesthetic free spirit as well. Continually\nscolded by her lover and comrade, Leo Jogiches, for her petit-bourgeois tastes\nand desires, she defended the value of a private life while devoting herself\nto the revolution. Her clan is nicely captured by her advice on the design of\nthe Spartacist newspaper Die Rote Fahne (The red banner): \"I do not think a\nnewspaper should be symmetrical, trimmed like an English lawn.... Rather, it\nshould be somewhat untamed, like a wild orchard, should bristle with life and\nshine with young talents\" (quoted in Ettinger, Rosa Luxemburg, p. 186).\n\n69\\. Luxemburg, \"Organizational Questions,\" p. 291 (emphasis added).\n\n70\\. \"An awakening of the revolutionary energy of the working class in Germany\ncan never again be called forth in the spirit of the guardianship methods of\nthe German Social Democracy of late-lamented memory.... [The awakening of\nrevolutionary energy could be effected) only by an insight into all the\nfearful seriousness, all the complexity of the tasks involved, only as a\nresult of political maturity and independence of spirit, only as a result of a\ncapacity for critical judgment on the part of the masses, which capacity was\nsystematically killed by the social democracy for decades under various\npretexts\" (Luxemburg, \"The Russian Revolution,\" pp. 369-70; emphasis added).\n\n71\\.

Luxemburg, \"Organizational Questions,\" p. 306.\n\n76\\. Luxemburg, The Russian Revolution,\" p. 389. By constantly stressing the\nethical and idealistic side of the working class, Luxemburg probably\nunderestimated the importance of bread-and-butter concerns. Such concerns\ncould as easily, in 1917 at least, lead to revolutionary action as to narrow\ntrade unionism. Neither she nor Lenin had the respect for working-class\nmaterialism to be found, for example, in Orwell's Road to Wigan Pier or Down\nand Out in Paris and London. While Lenin treated the workers as truant\nschoolboys constantly in need of monitoring and instruction, Luxemburg\nprobably missed, among other things, their proclivities for nationalism and\ntheir occasional timorousness.\n\n77\\. Ibid., p. 390. The reference to a textbook is not mocking; what strikes a\ncontemporary observer of turn-of-the-century socialism is how extraordinarily\nbookish and pedagogical it was. The classroom metaphor prevailed in socialist\nthought, and formal instruction was the norm. Luxemburg spent much of her\ncareer meeting classes and grading papers at the higher party school of the\nSDP.\n\n78\\. Ibid. (emphasis added). Compare this with the approach of the Italian\nanarchist Errico Malatesta, who in 1907 stated in Anarchy that even if rule by\nbeneficent authoritarian socialists were possible, it \"would immensely\ndiminish [productive force], because the government would restrict initiative\nto the few\" (quoted in Irving Louis Horowitz, The Anarchists [New York: Dell,\n1964], p. 83).\n\n79\\.

It may be more accurate to say that societies are likely to exhibit not\nonly the purposes and activities of their members (including, of course, their\nresistance) but also traces of many previous state \"projects,\" each of which\nhas laid down its particular geological stratum.\n\n3\\. The phrase comes from the title of Norbert Elias's great work, The\nCivilizing Process, vol. 1 of The History of Manners, trans. Edmund Jephcott\n(New York: Pantheon, 1982), but it applies also, as we shall see, to the self-\ndescriptions of the \"modernizers\" outside the West who have implemented these\nschemes. See also Elias's Power and Civility, the second volume of The History\nof Manners.\n\n4\\. See Von Thunen's Isolated State (1966), trans. Carla M. Wartenberg\n(Oxford: Pergamon Press), and G. William Skinner, Marketing and Social\nStructure in China (Tucson: Association of Asian Studies, 1975). Walter\nChristaller was the founder of central place theory. That theory, elaborated\nin his thesis at the University of Erlangen in 1932, forms the premise of\nSkinner's work.\n\n5\\. Waterborne movement was far easier than overland movement, so proximity\nwas measured less by physical distance, abstractly measured, than by \"travel\ntime.\" As these kingdoms had a tradition of long-distance trade, they were\nthus interested in appropriation, often by tribute relations, of not only\ngrain and manpower but also valuable goods, such as gems, precious metals,\nmedicines, and resins, that were profitable and manageable for trade conducted\nover long distances.\n\n6\\. An illustration of this is found in the following admonition directed to\nKing Narathihapate from Queen Saw, taken from The Glass Palace Chronicle of\nthe Kings of Burma, trans. Pe Maung Tin and G. H. Luce (London: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1923), p. 177: \"'Consider the state of the realm. Thou hast\nno folk or people, no host of countrymen and countrywomen around thee.... Thy\ncountrymen and countrywomen tarry and will not enter thy kingdom. They fear\nthy domination; for thou, 0 King Alaung, art a hard master.\"'\n\nThe classic analysis of the phenomenon in Southeast Asia may be found in\nMichael Adas, \"From Avoidance to Confrontation: Peasant Protest in Pre-\nColonial and Colonial Southeast Asia,\" Comparative Studies in Society and\nHistory 23, no. 2 (1981): 217-47. Coastal and riverine populations could be\nsaid to have \"voted with their oars.\"\n\n7\\. The problem of population flight was hardly unique to Southeast Asia. In\nthe late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, after the Black Plague had\nreduced the population of Western Europe by nearly one-third, the nobility\nfaced a serious problem in attracting serfs on favorable terms now that they\ncould so easily flee to land that had been abandoned by those felled by the\nplague. Slave states with open frontiers have always been vulnerable on this\nscore; in the pre-Civil War United States, escaping slaves could head to the\nNorth, Canada, or the \"free states\" of the West. In Russia, the majority of\nczarist decrees addressed the subject of runaway serfs. In general, wherever\nthere is an open frontier, unfree forms of labor are difficult to sustain\nunless sufficient coercion can be mobilized to contain the population.\n\n8\\. This logic works best for inland (kraton-style) kingdoms. It breaks down\nwhenever there are strategic locations that function as natural monopolies or\nchoke points and control of which can serve as a basis for appropriation. I\nhave in mind the control of river mouths (the bolo-hilir distinction in the\nMalay world), straits, mountain passes, or deposits of vital resources.\n\n9\\. Abstracting from the Southeast Asian case, one might say that state\nformation is abetted by concentrated, intensive cultivation, a population who\nproduces a consistent surplus and who finds it costly to leave (having had,\nfor example, high sunk-costs in field creation and water control), who produce\ngoods that, if bulky (such as food), can be stored and moved easily (such as\ngrain) and that have relatively high value per unit volume and weight.\n\n10\\. Those who dwell in such spaces, of course, saw the matter differently,\ncon trasting their freedom, mobility, and honor, to the bondage of those under\nthe thumb of the court. An evocative and evenhanded Afghan proverb captures\nthe distinction: \"Taxes ate the valleys; honor ate the hills.\"\n\n11\\. One of the best ways to conjure up such places is to ask where runaway\nserfs and slaves repaired to and where Maroon communities of fugitive slaves\nestablished themselves. Such places were nonstate spaces, which the\nauthorities tried to efface if possible. In the United States, a telling\nexample is the enormous effort made in the postbellum South to eliminate the\nlarge commons on which free blacks could eke out an independent existence and\nto drive the blacks into the labor market, often to work for their former\nmasters. Most freed slaves preferred to make a precarious living by farming,\nfishing, hunting, trapping, and grazing a few animals on open land over the\nsubordination of permanent wage labor. A series of fencing and trespassing\nlaws, hunting and trapping prohibitions, grazing restrictions, vagrancy laws,\nand so on were, as Steven Hahn has shown, designed to eliminate this nonwage\nlabor (and nonstate) space. See Hahn, \"Hunting, Fishing, and Foraging: Common\nRights and Class Relations in the Post-Bellum South,\" Radical History Review\n26 (1982): 37-64.\n\n12\\. Lest this seem geographically determinist, let me emphasize that human\nagency plays a large role in creating and maintaining a nonstate space. At the\nlimit, even parts of great cities may come to be nonstate spaces when the\nstate essentially cedes control toa rebellious or resistant population.\n\n13\\. A goal related to dispossessing the Meratus of \"their\" forest was to make\nthe land more easily available for inclusion in state logging and revenue\nplans.\n\n14\\. Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing, In the Realm of the Diamond Queen: Marginality in\nan Out-of-the-Way Place (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), pp.\nxiii, 28, 41.\n\n15\\. Ibid., pp. 48, 93.\n\n16\\. I recall seeing such settlements in the Philippine provinces of Tarlac\nand Pangasinan, where each house displayed, in large letters on the front near\nthe steps, the names and ages of all the family members who slept there,\nallowing security forces on their nightly patrols to more easily identify any\nunauthorized visitors.\n\n17\\. Once it is cut, sugarcane must be crushed quickly in order to avoid\nlosses through evaporation and fermentation. The need for a large crushing\nmill (often called a sugar \"central,\" for good reason), problems relating to\ntransportation of the cane, and the great bulk reduction through processing\nprovide a kind of natural bottleneck that allows the mill owner to control\nproduction directly or else through tied contracts. Compared to coffee,\ntobacco, tea, rubber, or palm oil, sugarcane is unique in this advantage to\ncentralized production.\n\n18\\. The difficulties of recruiting Malays, who were independent cultivators,\nto work on the estates proved insurmountable, and thus it seemed more\nconvenient to import Indian and Chinese laborers for the growing estate labor\nforce. This fact alone favored plantations unless the colonizers were willing\nto risk the political dangers of creating a class of imported yeomen to\ncompete with the Malays for land. Elsewhere, there were other solutions to\ncreating a legible sphere of appropriation. On Java, the Culture System\nrequired the village, in lieu of taxes, to plant an export crop every so often\non village lands. Where it was vital to force an economically independent\npeasantry into wage labor or plantation work, a universal, annual head tax\npayable in cash was often found to be useful.\n\n19\\. Thus the morally obtuse but sociologically correct observation by Samuel\nHuntington during the Vietnam War: the massive bombing of the countryside and\nthe subsequent creation of huge refugee settlements on the outskirts of major\ncities provided many advantages to those who wanted to influence and mobilize\nthe electorate. Those in the camps, he reasoned, were more easily manipulable\nthan those still living in their rural communities. The implicit but macabre\nlogic was impeccable; the more bombs rained on the countryside, the greater\nthe opportunities for the United States and its allies in Saigon to dominate\nany peaceful electoral competition that followed. From Huntington, \"Getting\nReady for Political Competition in South Vietnam,\" paper presented at the\nSoutheast Asia Development Advisory Group of the Asia Society, circa 1970.\n\nI believe that this logic of social demobilization is the key element in the\ncommonly observed fact that, at the beginning of industrialization, the\ndeclining rural community is often more likely to be a source of collective\nprotest than is the newly constituted proletariat, notwithstanding standard\nMarxist reasoning to the contrary. Resettlement, whether forced or unforced,\noften eliminates a prior community and replaces it with a temporarily\ndisaggregated mass of new arrivals. It is ironically just such a population\nthat may, for the time being, more closely resemble the \"potatoes in a sack\"\nthan the peasantry of the bocage described by Marx in The Eighteenth Brumiare.\n\n###### Chapter 6: Soviet Collectivization, Capitalist Dreams\n\n1\\. The best source for a discussion about Soviet high modernism is probably\nRichard Stites, Revolutionary Dreams: Utopian Vision and Experimental Life in\nthe Russian Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989). Its generous\nbibliography appears to cover most of the available sources.\n\n2\\. This inference, we know, is not a distortion of the doctrines of\nliberalism. J. S. Mill, whose credentials as a liberal son of the\nEnlightenment are not in doubt, considered backwardness a sufficient\njustification for placing authoritarian powers in the hands of a modernizer.\nSee Ernest Gellner, \"The Struggle to Catch Up,\" Times Literary Supplement,\nDecember 9, 1994, p. 14. For a more detailed argument along these lines, see\nalso Jan P. Nederveen Pieterse and Bhikhu Parekh, eds., The Decolonization of\nthe Imagination: Culture, Knowledge, and Power (London: Zed Press, 1995).\n\n3\\. Stites, Revolutionary Dreams, p. 19.

Sheila Fitzpatrick, The Russian Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 1982), p. 119. The term \"gigantomania\" was, I believe, also in use in\nthe Soviet Union. The ultimate failure of most of the USSR's great schemes is\nin itself an important story, the significance of which was captured\nepigrammatically by Robert Conquest, who observed that \"the end of the Cold\nWar can be seen as the defeat of Magnitogorsk by Silicon Valley\" (\"Party in\nthe Dock,\" Times Literary Supplement, November 6, 1992, p. 7). For an\nindustrial, cultural, and social history of Magnitogorsk, see Stephen Kotkin,\nMagnetic Mountain: Stalinism as a Civilization (Berkeley: University of\nCalifornia Press, 1995).\n\n6\\. An interesting parallel can be seen in the French countryside following\nthe Revolution, when campaigns called for \"de-Christianization\" and offered\nassociated secular rituals.\n\n7\\.

Lenin, almost certainly influenced by another of his favorite books,\nCampanella's City of the Sun, wanted public sculptures of revolutionaries,\ncomplete with inspiring inscriptions, to be erected throughout the city: a\npropaganda of monuments.

As many commentators have emphasized, this redesigning of work processes\nwrested the control of production from skilled artisans and laborers and\nplaced it in the hands of management, whose ranks and prerogatives grew as the\nlabor force was \"dc-skilled.\"\n\n17\\. Around 1920, much of the market for agricultural machinery made by U.S.\nmanufacturers was not in the United States, where farm sizes were still\nrelatively small, but outside the country, in such places as Canada,\nArgentina, Australia, and Russia, where farms were considerably larger.\nFitzgerald, Yeoman No More, chap. 2, p. 31.\n\n18\\. For a fascinating and more complete account of the Campbell enterprise,\nsee \"The Campbell Farm Corporation,\" chap. 5, ibid. It's worth adding here\nthat the economic depression for agriculture in the United States began at the\nend of World War I, not in 1930. The time was thus ripe for bold\nexperimentation, and cost of buying or leasing land was cheap.\n\n19\\. Wheat and flax are, in the terminology developed later in this chapter,\n\"proletarian\" crops as opposed to \"petit-bourgeois\" crops.\n\n20\\. Fitzgerald, Yeoman No More, chap. 4, pp. 15-17.\n\n21\\. See above, nn. 14 and 18.\n\n22\\. Another such farm, and one with direct links to New Deal experimentation\nin the 1930s, was the Fairway Farms Corporation. Founded in 1924 by M. L.\nWilson and Henry C. Taylor, both of whom were trained in institutional\neconomics at the University of Wisconsin, the corporation was designed to turn\nlandless farmers into scientific, industrial farmers. The capital for the new\nenterprise came, through intermediaries, from John D. Rockefeller. \"Fair Way\"\nFarms would become the model for many of the New Deal's more ambitious\nagricultural programs as Wilson, Taylor, and many of their progressive\ncolleagues in Wisconsin moved to influential positions in Washington under\nRoosevelt. A more searching account of the connection is in Jess Gilbert and\nEllen R. Baker, \"Wisconsin Economists and New Deal Agricultural Policy: The\nLegacy of Progressive Professors\" (unpublished paper, 1995). The 1920s were a\nfertile time for agricultural experimentation, partly because the economic\nslump for agricultural commodities after World War I prompted policy\ninitiatives designed to alleviate the crisis.\n\n23\\. Fitzgerald, Yeoman No More, chap. 4, pp. 18-27.

Enthusiastic visitors included the likes of John Dewey, Lincoln Steffens,\nRexford Tugwell, Robert LaFollette, Morris Llewellyn Cooke (at the time the\nforemost exponent of scientific management in the United States), Thurman\nArnold, and, of course, Thomas Campbell, who called the Soviet experiment \"the\nbiggest farming story the world has ever heard.\" Typical of the praise for\nSoviet plans for a progressive, modernized rural life was this appraisal by\nBelle LaFollette, the wife of Robert LaFollette: \"If the Soviets could have\ntheir way, all land would be cultivated by tractors, all the villages lighted\nby electricity, each community would have a central house serving for the\npurpose of school, library, assembly hall, and theatre. They would have every\nconvenience and advantage which they plan for the industrial workers in the\ncity\" (quoted in Lewis S. Feuer, \"American Travelers to the Soviet Union,\n1917-1932: The Formation of a Component of New Deal Ideology,\" American\nQuarterly 14 [Spring 1962]: 129).

Quoted in Robert Conquest, The Harvest o% Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization\nand the Terror-Famine (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 232. An\neven more explicit recognition that this was a \"war\" appears in this statement\nby M. M. Khateyevich: \"A ruthless struggle is going on between the peasantry\nand our regime. It's a struggle to the death. This year was a test of our\nstrength and their endurance. It took a famine to show them who was master\nhere. It has cost millions of lives, but the collective farm system is here to\nstay, we've won the war\" (quoted in ibid., p. 261).\n\n34\\. The so-called Great Leap Forward in China was at least as deadly and may\nbe analyzed in comparable terms. I have chosen to concentrate on Soviet Russia\nlargely because events there occurred some thirty years before the Great Leap\nForward and hence have received much more scholarly attention, especially\nduring the past seven years, when the newly opened Russian archives have\ngreatly expanded our knowledge. For a recent popular account of the Chinese\nexperience, see Jasper Becker, Hungry Ghosts: China's Secret Famine (London:\nJohn Murray, 1996).\n\n35\\. In cases where yields were high among state farms and show projects, they\nwere typically achieved with such costly inputs of machinery, fertilizers,\npesticides, and herbicides that the results were economically irrational.\n\n36\\. For an exceptionally perceptive account of collectivization and its\nresults, see Moshe Lewin, The Making of the Soviet System: Essays in the\nSocial History of Interwar Russia (New York: Pantheon, 1985), especially part\n2, pp. 89-188.\n\n37\\. I use the term \"lumpen\" here to designate a huge floating population of\ngreat variety and shifting occupations. Although Marx and Lenin always used\nthe term scornfully, implying both criminal tendencies and political\nopportunism, I intend no such denigration.\n\n38\\. Stalin, it is now believed, was personally responsible for drafting in\nAugust 1932 a secret decree branding all those who withheld grain, now\ndeclared to be \"sacred and untouchable\" state property, as \"enemies of the\npeople\" and ruling that they should be summarily arrested and shot. The same\nStalin, at the Second Congress of Outstanding Kolkhozniks in 1935, championed\nthe retaining of adequate private plots: \"The majority of kolkhozniks want to\nplant an orchard, cultivate a vegetable garden or keep bees. The kolkhozniks\nwant to live a decent life, and for that this 0.12 hectares is not enough. We\nneed to allocate a quarter to half a hectare, and even as much as one hectare\nin some districts\" (quoted in Sheila Fitzpatrick, Stalins Peasants: Resistance\nand Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization [New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1995], pp. 73, 122).\n\n39\\. Ibid., p. 432.\n\n40\\. Orlando Figes, \"Peasant Aspirations and Bolshevik State-Building in the\nCountryside, 1917-1925,\" paper presented at the Program in Agrarian Studies,\nYale University, New Haven, April 14, 1995, p. 24. Figes also links these\nviews to socialist tracts that date from at least the 1890s and that\npronounced the peasantry doomed by economic progress (p. 28).\n\n41\\. R. W. Davies, The Socialist Offensive: The Collectivisation of Soviet\nAgriculture, 1929-1930 (London: Macmillan, 1980), p. 51.\n\n42\\. Conquest, Harvest of Sorrow, p. 43.\n\n43\\. Also, the collapse of urban enterprises, which would normally have\nsupplied consumer goods and farm implements to the rural areas, meant that\nthere was less incentive for the peasantry to sell grain in order to make\npurchases in the market.\n\n44\\. See Orlando Figes's remarkably perceptive and detailed book, Peasant\nRussia, Civil War: The Volga Countryside in Revolution, 1917-1921 (Oxford:\nClarendon Press, 1989). Even near revolutions create a similar vacuum.\nFollowing the 1905 revolution, it took the czarist government nearly two years\nto reassert its control over the countryside.\n\n45\\. The relative unity of the village was itself enhanced by the\nrevolutionary process. The richest landlords had left or been burned out, and\nthe poorest, landless families had typically gotten some land. As a result,\nthe villagers were more socioeconomically similar and therefore more likely to\nrespond similarly to external demands. Since many of the independent farmers\nwere pressured to return to the commune, they were now dependent on the entire\nvillage for their household's allotment of the communal lands. Thus it is not\nhard to understand why, in those instances where the kombedy was an instrument\nof Bolshevik policy, it faced determined opposition from the more\nrepresentative village soviet. \"One government official from Samara Province\nclaimed, with conscious irony, that the conflicts between the kombedy and the\nSoviets represented the main form of 'class struggle' in the rural areas\nduring this period\" (ibid., p. 197). In the larger villages, some support for\nBolshevik agrarian plans could be found among educated youth, schoolteachers,\nand veterans who had become Bolsheviks while serving with the Red Army during\nWorld War I or the civil war (and who might have imagined themselves occupying\nleading roles in the new collective farms). See Figes, \"Peasant Aspirations\nand Bolshevik State-Building.\"\n\n46\\. There was also a tendency to hide income from craft, artisanal, and\ntrading sidelines as well as \"garden\" crops. During this same period, it\nshould be added, insufficient resources-manpower, draft animals, manure, and\nseed-meant that some of the arable either could not be planted or could only\nproduce yields that were far lower than usual.\n\n47\\. Yaney, The Urge to Mobilize, pp. 515-16. For Yaney, the continuity in\naspirations from what he terms \"messianic social agronomists\" under the\nczarist regime to the Bolshevik collectivizers was striking. In a few cases,\nthey were the same people.\n\n48\\. Figes, Peasant Russia, Civil War, p. 250.\n\n49\\. Hunger and flight from the towns had reduced the number of urban\nindustrial workers from 3.6 million in 1917 to no more than 1.5 million in\n1920 (Fitzpatrick, The Russian Revolution, p. 85).\n\n50\\. Figes, Peasant Russia, Civil War, p. 321.\n\n51\\. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, Stalin's Peasants, p. 39.\n\n52\\. In theory, at least, the most \"advanced\" were the state farms-the\nproletarian, industrial, collective farms in which workers were paid wages and\nno private plots were allowed. These farms also received the bulk of state\ninvestment in machinery in the early years. For production statistics, see\nDavies, The Socialist Offensive, p. 6.\n\n53\\. Ibid., pp. 82-113.\n\n54\\.

Hindus, Red Breed (London, 1931), quoted in Davies, The Socialist\nOffensive, p. 209.\n\n58\\. Davies, The Socialist Offensive, p. 205.\n\n59\\. The size of collective farms remained enormous, even by American\nstandards, throughout the Soviet period. Fred Pryor calculates that in 1970\nthe average state farm comprised more than 100,000 acres, while the average\ncollective farm comprised over 25,000 acres. The state farms were greatly\nfavored in access to inputs, machinery, and other subsidies.

Fitzgerald, Stalin's Peasants, p. 105.\n\n61\\. Ibid., pp. 105-6. One imagines that the soils and existing cropping\npatterns were also ignored.\n\n62\\. As the Bolsheviks explained, \"The kolkhozy are the only means by which\nthe peasantry can escape from poverty and darkness\" (Davies, The Socialist\nOffensive, p. 282). Perhaps the best visual images of the culturally\ntransforming properties of electricity, machinery, and collectivization are\nfound in Sergey Eisenstein's film The General Line, a veritable technological\nromance set in rural Russia. The film masterfully conveys the utopian\naspirations of high modernism by contrasting the plodding dark narod with his\nhorse and scythe with images of electric cream separators, tractors, mowing\nmachines, engines, skyscrapers, engines, and airplanes.\n\n63\\. Fitzpatrick, Stalin's Peasants, p. 194.\n\n64\\. Ibid., pp. 306-9.\n\n65\\. For an account of how an even more extreme version of regional\nspecialization was imposed on the Chinese countryside, in violation of local\nsoil and climatological conditions, see Ralph Thaxton, Salt of the Earth: The\nPolitical Origins of Peasant Protest and Communist Revolution in China\n(Berkeley: University of California Press, forthcoming).\n\n66\\. Figes, Peasant Russia, Civil War, p. 304. The analogy took concrete form\nin many of the early revolts against collectivization, during which the\npeasantry destroyed all the records of labor dues, crop deliveries, debts, and\nso on, just as they had under serfdom.\n\n67\\. Conquest, Harvest of Sorrow, p. 152.\n\n68\\. The resemblances to serfdom are spelled out in some detail in Fitzgerald,\nStalin's Peasants, pp. 128-39.

I am persuaded by the historical accounts that characterize the mir as\nthe peasantry's adaptation to a gentry and state that treated it as a\ncollective unit for the purposes of taxation, conscription, and some forms of\nservile dues. The periodic redivision of land among the households ensured\nthat all had the means of paying their share of the head taxes, which were\nlevied on the commune collectively. That is, the relative solidarity of the\nRussian repartitional commune is itself a result of a distinct history of\nrelations with overlords. This claim is perfectly compatible with the fact\nthat such solidarity, once in place, can serve other purposes, including\nresistance.\n\n71\\. Fitzgerald, Stalin's Peasants, p. 106 (emphasis added).\n\n72\\. I am immensely grateful to my colleague Teodor Shanin and his research\nteams, who are conducting comparative work on more than twenty collective\nfarms, for making available to me the maps and photographs for this chapter.\nParticular thanks to Galya Yastrebinskaya and Olga Subbotina for the\nphotograph of the older village of Utkino, founded in 1912 and located twenty\nmiles from the city of Vologda.\n\n73\\. Notice that the old-style houses that were not moved (legend reference\n12) are themselves laid out on roughly equal plots along the main road. I do\nnot know whether there were administrative reasons behind these forms in the\neighteenth century, when the village was founded, or whether the original\npioneers themselves laid out the grid. How the older houses that have been\nrelocated were originally disposed is also a mystery.\n\n74\\. The same logic, of course, applied to industry, in which large units are\nfavored over small factories or artisanal production. As Jeffrey Sachs has\nobserved: \"Central planners had no desire to coordinate the activities of\nhundreds or thousands of small firms in a sector if one large firm could do\nthe job. A standard strategy, therefore, was to create one giant firm wherever\npossible\" (Poland's Jump into the Market Economy [Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1993]). In the context of the Soviet economy, the largest\nindustrial unit was the huge steel complex at Magnitogorsk. It is now a\nstunning example of an industrial and ecological ruin. See also Kotkin,\nMagnetic Mountain.\n\n75\\. For a more extensive treatment of the ecological effects of Soviet\nagriculture, see Murray Feshbach, Ecological Disaster: Cleaning Up the Hidden\nLegacy of the Soviet Regime (New York: 1995), and Ze'ev Wolfson (Boris\nKomarov), The Geography of 'Survival: Ecology in the Post-Soviet Era (New\nYork: M. E. Sharpe, 1994).\n\n76\\. 1 worked for six weeks in 1990 on a cooperative (ex-collective) farm in\neastern Germany, on the Mecklenburg Plain, not too far from Neubrandenburg.\nThe local officials were exceptionally proud of their world-class yields per\nhectare in rye and potatoes with high starch content grown for industrial\nuses. It was clear, however, that as an economic matter, the market cost of\nthe inputs (labor, machin ery, and fertilizer) needed to produce these yields\nmade this enterprise an inefficient producer by any cost accounting standard.\n\n77\\. There is no doubt that a number of bureaucratic \"pathologies\" amplified\nthe disaster of Soviet collectivization. They include the tendency of\nadministrators to concentrate on specified, quantifiable results (e.g., grain\nyields, tons of potatoes, tons of pig iron) rather than on quality and the\nfact that long chains of specialization and command shielded many officials\nfrom the larger consequences of their behavior. Also, the difficulty of making\nofficials accountable to their clientele, as opposed to their superiors, meant\nthat the pathology of group \"commandism,\" on one hand, or individual\ncorruption and self-serving, on the other, were rampant. Highmodernist schemes\nin revolutionary, authoritarian settings like that of the Soviet Union are\nthus likely to go off the rails more easily and remain off the rails far\nlonger than in a parliamentary setting.\n\n78\\. The rush toward collectivization was momentarily halted by Stalin's\nfamous \"Dizzy with Success\" speech of March 1930, which prompted many to leave\nthe collectives; however, it was not long before the pace of collectivization\nresumed. In order to have enough capital for rapid industrialization, 4.8\nmillion tons of grain were exported in 1930 and 5.2 million tons in 1931,\nhelping to set the stage for the famine of the years immediately following.\nSee Lewin, The Making of the Soviet Sys- tern, p. 156.\n\n79\\. Compare this with Bakunin's forecast of what state socialism would amount\nto: \"They will concentrate all of the powers of government in strong hands,\nbecause the very fact that the people are ignorant necessitates strong,\nsolicitous care by the government. They will create a single state bank,\nconcentrating in its hands all the commercial, industrial, agricultural, and\neven scientific producers, and they will divide the masses of people into two\narmies-industrial and agricultural armies under the direct command of the\nState engineers who will constitute the new privileged scientific-political\nclass\" (quoted in W. D. Maximoff, The Political Philosophy of Bakunin:\nScientific Anarchism [New York: Free Press, 1953], p. 289).\n\n80\\. The term \"elective affinity\" comes from Max Weber's analysis of the\nrelation between capitalist norms and institutions on one hand and\nProtestantism on the other. His argument is not one of direct causation but of\n\"fit\" and symbiosis.\n\n81\\. See books 4 and 5 in vol. 2 of Gabriel Ardant, Theorie sociologique de\nl'impot (Paris: CEVPEN, 1965).\n\n82\\. Quoted in Michel Crozier, The Bureaucratic Phenomenon (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1964), p. 239. As Abram de Swaan has noted, \"The\nnineteenthcentury school regime does reveal some unmistakable similarities\nwith the factory regime of that time: standardization, formalization and the\nimposition of punctuality and discipline were paramount in both\" (In Care of\nthe State, p. 61).\n\n83\\. For a detailed account of the relationship between the private plot and\nthe collective just prior to 1989, see Timofeev, Soviet Peasants, or The\nPeasants' Art of Starving.\n\n###### Chapter 7: Compulsory Villagization in Tanzania\n\n1\\. Julius Nyerere claimed that over 9 million people had been moved to ujamaa\nvillages, but since a good many of these villages were administrative fictions\nand others had preexisting population bases that were probably included in the\nselfcongratulatory government statistics, a more modest figure is probably\ncloser to the truth. See Goran Hyden, Beyond Ujaniaa in Tanzania:\nUnderdevelopment and an Uncaptured Peasantry (Berkeley: University of\nCalifornia Press, 1980), p. 130 n. 2.\n\n2\\. During his presidency, Nyerere visited almost every socialist-bloc state.\nFor an enlightening survey of Marxism-inspired development plans throughout\nthe Third World, see Forrest D. Colburn, The Vogue of Revolution in Poor\nCountries (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994).\n\n3\\.

Ruttan, \"Why Are Farms So Small?\" World Development 22, no. 5\n(1994): 691-706.\n\n4\\. These influences were quite direct, as we have noted, for many of the\npersonnel in the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Bank for\nReconstruction and Development, the World Bank, and development agencies from\nthe United Nations were American economists, agronomists, engineers, and\nbureaucrats.\n\n5\\. See, for example, Lionel Cliffe and Griffiths L. Cunningham, \"Ideology,\nOrganization, and the Settlement Experience of Tanzania,\" in Lionel Cliffe and\nJohn S.

Ibid., p. 103.\n\n9\\. Such schemes often included, as Beinert explains, \"storm drains, contour\nbunding, ridging, protection of stream banks, compulsory grass fallows,\nrestorative crops and eventually a full system of rotational strip cropping\"\n(ibid., p. 104).\n\n10\\. There is nothing odd about this displacement, which occurs almost\nunconsciously. The \"look\" of agriculture is stamped with specific,\nhistorically contingent features that tend to be forgotten in practice until\none's visual expectations are upset. When, for example, I first visited\nnorthern Bohemia before 1989, I was taken aback by huge collectivized maize\nfields that extended two or three miles, unbroken by fences or lines of trees.\nI realized that my visual expectations about the countryside included the\nphysical evidence of small private properties: tree lines, fences, smaller and\nmore irregular plots, the physical features of independent farmsteads. (Had I\ngrown up in, say, Kansas, I would not have been quite so surprised.)\n\n11\\. Beinert, \"Agricultural Planning,\" p. 113.\n\n12\\.

I owe much of my early\nappreciation for the Tanzanian material to Joel Gao Hiza's exceptionally\nperceptive senior essay in anthropology, \"The Repetition of 'Traditional'\nMistakes in Rural Development: Compulsory Villagization in Tanzania,\" April\n1993, and to his invaluable bibliographic assistance.

It is worth\nnoting here that the abolition of individual freehold title shortly after\nindependence was one of the legal preconditions for forced villagization, as,\nin Nyerere's words, \"all land now be- long[ed] to the nation\" (p. 307).\nNyerere justified this move in terms of African traditions of \"communal\nownership,\" thus eliding the difference between communal ownership and state\nownership.\n\n22\\. Quoted in Coulson, Tanzania, p. 237 (emphasis added).\n\n23\\. One imagines that Nyerere had a powerful visual image of what a \"proper\"\nvillage should look like-its layout, tractors crisscrossing communal fields, a\nclinic, a school, a government service center, small village industries, and\nperhaps, looking ahead, electric engines and lights. Where did this image come\nfrom? From Russia, China, the West?\n\n24\\. Quoted in Nyerere, Freedom and Socialism, p. 356.\n\n25\\. Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\n26\\.

The authors omit the actual location and name of the\nvillage, almost certainly for political reasons. Although I have no way of\nproving it, I would guess that this Xanadu was close to the capital at Dar es\nSalaam so that officials could visit and admire it.\n\n28\\. By the contemporary standards of rule in neighboring states like\nEthiopia, Uganda, South Africa, Mozambique, and Zaire, Nyerere's Tanzania was\nparadise itself. Nevertheless, TANU routinely suborned the legal system or\ncircumvented it altogether. The Preventive Detention Act of 1962 provided no\nsafeguards against flagrant abuse. In early 1964, after an army mutiny, it was\nused liberally to round up about five hundred opponents of the regime, most of\nwhom had no connection to the conspiracy. In addition to the Preventive\nDetention Act, the regime also had frequent recourse to a number of\nauthoritarian colonial laws.

He reminded his audience of \"all that the TANU\nGovernment had done for the people after the Arusha Declaration: abolishing\nthe poll tax, abolishing primary school fees, building permanent, clean water\nsupplies in the villages, expanding the number of health clinics and\ndispensaries in the rural areas, increasing primary school facilities. He then\nwent on to ask what the peasants had done in return for these favors. In\nanswering that question, President Nyerere suggested that they had done\nvirtually nothing. They had remained idle and evaded their responsibility to\nmake a contribution to the country's socialist development. He concluded his\nspeech by saying that he knew he could not turn people into socialists by\nforce, but what his government could do was to ensure that everybody lived in\nvillage. He said he wanted that to be done before the end of 1976\" (Hyden,\nBeyond Ujamaa in Tanzania, p. 130).\n\n35\\. The stage had already been set when, in early October, the Sixteenth\nBiennial Conference of TANU ended with an urgent call to the government to\n\"map village areas\" with a view to making the ujamaa village movement national\nrather than relying on local initiative (Daily News [Dar es Salaam], October\n2, 1973). Accordingly, there were calls in the next months for land officers\nand professional surveyors to train local cadres in the simpler techniques of\nsurveying so that they could lay out new villages (Daily News [Dar es Salaam],\nJanuary 30, 1974). \"Frontal\" approaches to ujamaa villages, however, had been\nurged from at least 1969 by TANU, the Ministry of Rural Development, and the\nsecond five-year plan. See Bismarck U. Mwansasu and Cranford Pratt, Towards\nSocialism in Tanzania (Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 1979), p. 98.\n\n36\\. Quoted in Coulson, \"Agricultural Policies in Mainland Tanzania,\" p. 74.\nSee also Juma Volter Mwapachu, \"Operation Planned Villages in Rural Tanzania:\nA Revolutionary Strategy of Development,\" African Review 6, no. I (1976): 1 -\n16. The discourse begs for closer analysis. The subject of the last two\nsentences is the impersonal actor \"the State\" or \"Tanzania,\" represented in\npractice, of course, by Nyerere and the TANU elite. In the context of coercion\nthe linguistic fiction of choice is still maintained. Finally, using the\nphrase \"life of death\" to describe the lives most Tanzanians are leading\nelevates Nyerere and the party to the role of saviors raising their people\nfrom the dead, as Jesus did with Lazarus.\n\n37\\.

In the antiseptic terminology of the 1961 World Bank report, \"When people\nmove to new areas, they are likely to be more receptive of change than when\nthey remain in their familiar surroundings\" (quoted in Coulson, Tanzania, p.\n75). This was presumably the psychological premise behind forced settlement. I\nwas told by a World Bank official that early in the campaign to transplant\nthousands of Javanese on the outer islands of Indonesia, it was thought better\nto move them by airplane rather than by boat, which would have been cheaper,\nbecause their first experience of flight would suitably disorient them and\nconvey to them the revolutionary and permanent nature of their relocation.\n\n39\\.

One could argue that it is far easier to impose high-\nmodernist schemes of transformation on a population that is somehow\nconstructed as \"the other\" than on a group that is part of \"us\" This would\nhelp to explain why villagization was imposed first in poor areas such as\nKigoma and Dodoma and why it went particularly hard on the pastoral Maasai.\n\n44\\.

Here, incidentally, is where I think Goran Hyden's otherwise interesting\nbook misses the boat altogether. The resistance of the Tanzanian peasantry\nseems less a consequence of some age-old \"economy of affection\" than a\nrational response to painful memories of the dire consequences of many state\nschemes, most of which had miscarried.\n\n48\\.

Unfavorable price and currency movements meant that a five-\nfold increase in the volume of imports from 1973 to 1975 now represented a\nthirty-fold increase in value.\n\n55\\. Here the key is perhaps the difference between subsistence production and\nproduction for the market. I am grateful to Bruce McKim for emphasizing that\nthe macroeconomic incentives for market production were minimal. Producer\nprices, which were set by the state marketing boards, were all but\nconfiscatory, and in any case the shops contained few goods on which the\nproceeds could have been spent.\n\n56\\. The intention of this law, which had a long colonial history, was to\nforce the peasantry into planting crops that did well under and conditions,\nthus lowering the government's food relief expenditures during times of\nfamine.\n\n57\\. The system of cotton cultivation in Mozambique was a draconian model of\nthis policy. The Portuguese made great efforts to concentrate the population\n(con- centra(!aoes) so that officials or concessionaires could enforce cotton\ncultivation and delivery. In one variant, plots were marked off by surveyors,\nand every family was assigned a plot. The scheme was enforced by a system in\nwhich personalized passes indicated whether their bearers had acquitted their\ncotton quotas for the year; those found in default could be arrested, beaten,\nor sent off as draft labor to the dreaded sisal plantations. For an\nexceptionally detailed and comprehensive account, see Allen Isaacman, Cotton\nIs the Mother of Poverty: Peasants, Work, and Rural Struggle in Colonial\nMozambique, 1938-1961 (Portsmouth, N.H.: Heinemann, 1996).\n\n58\\. Officials aspired to control not only production but also consumption. In\nmid-1974 in the Dodoma district, for example, all private retail trade in\nessential food items was banned in favor of the monopoly formed by the state's\nconsumer cooperative societies and Ujamaa shops. See \"Only Co-ops Will Sell\nFood in Dodoma,\" Daily News (Dares Salaam), June 6, 1974. This move was\nprobably provoked by the losses experienced by \"official\" shops, which were\nusually run by party cadres and lower-level officials. It would be surprising\nif such a monopoly over retail trade in food ever became much more than an\naspiration.\n\n59\\. Boesen, Madsen, and Moody, Ujamaa, p. 105.\n\n60\\.

Thus Ndugu Lyander, the regional part secretary for the Kilombero\ndistrict along the Great Uhuru Railway (built with Chinese assistance),\nreminded the people that each family must cultivate its two assigned acres,\nwarning them (in language suggestive of the resistance that he was meeting)\n\"that action will be taken against anyone who does not have a farm and no\nexcuses will be entertained\" (\"100,000 Move to Uhuru Line Villages,\" Daily\nNews [Dar es Salaam], October 28, 1974).\n\n64\\. Bernstein, \"Notes on State and the Peasantry,\" p. 48.\n\n65\\. Ibid. Bernstein points out astutely that the Tanzanian state faced an\nimposing fiscal crisis at the time. The growth of the state budget and\npersonnel had for a long time outpaced the growth of the economy and of\ngovernment revenues, including foreign exchange. The effort to regiment the\npeasant economy in the hope of both raising production and increasing state\nrevenues was virtually the only alternative available.\n\n66\\. There had also been considerable growth in parastatal corporations where\nproduction was carried out by wage labor. A good many of these corporations\ntook to farming (grains, sugar, and fodder for dairy cows). These operations,\nespecially the sugar parastatal plantations, were large and capital intensive,\nas were the nationalized sisal and tea plantations.\n\n67\\.

Quoted in Coulson, African Socialism in Practice, p. 65. The relentless\nemphasis on quantitative achievements was echoed in the newspapers: so many\npeople moved to new villages, so many new villages formed, so many acres of\ncrops sown, such and such a percentage of a district rehoused, so many plots\nof land allocated, etc. See, for example, typical articles in Daily Neivs [Dar\nes Salaam]: \"14,133 Move into Villages in Chjunya,\" February 19, 1974; \"Two\nMonths After Op eration Arusha: 13,928 Families Move into Ujamaa Villages,\"\nOctober 21, 1974; \"Iringa: Settling the People into Planned Villages,\" April\n15, 1975.\n\nNyerere did not, as had Stalin, make a \"Dizzy with Success\" speech and call a\ntemporary halt in villagization. On the other hand, Tanzanian villagization\nwas not nearly as brutal. Nyerere continued on in this speech to explain again\nhow this concentration of population would permit the delivery of social\nservices \"necessary to a life of dignity.\"\n\n82\\. Coulson, Tanzania, pp. 320-31.\n\n83\\. For a powerfully argued parallel case, see James Ferguson, The Anti-\nPolitics Machine: \"Development,\" Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in\nLesotho (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). Ferguson concludes that\n\"the 'development' apparatus in Lesotho is not a machine for eliminating\npoverty that is incidentally involved with the state bureaucracy; it is a\nmachine for reinforcing and expanding the exercise of bureaucratic state\npower, which incidentally takes 'poverty' as its point of entry\" (pp. 255-56).\nIn Tanzania, there were still more important ways in which the official\nclasses gained power, including the displacement of the Asian trading minority\nas buyers of rural produce and in retailing, as well as the nationalization of\ntrade and industry in general. It is indicative that the size of the\ngovernment's budget and the number of state employees increased at rates well\nabove the rate of economic growth until the mid-1970s, when a fiscal crisis\nprevented any further expansion.\n\n84\\. In a stingy landscape, to stay put is suicide and to move is the\ncondition of survival. See, for an extended and poetic case along these lines,\nBruce Chatwin, The Songlines (London: Cape, 1987).\n\n85\\. M. L. Ole Parkipuny, \"Some Crucial Aspects of the Maasai Predicament,\" in\nCoulson, African Socialism in Practice, chap. 10, pp. 139-60.\n\n86\\. See, for example, Raikes, \"Eating the Carrot and Wielding the Stick\":\n\"Many policies rest on assumptions about agricultural 'modernization' held in\ncommon by the Tanzanian Government and its anti-socialist critics, while no\nsmall proportion of policy has been carried over (with or without change) from\nthe colonial period\" (p. 106). See also the brilliant analysis of the\napplication of the World Bank development paradigm to Lesotho in Ferguson, The\nAnti-Politics Machine, which also discusses World Bank plans for villagization\nin Lesotho.\n\n87\\. Ron Aminzade (personal communication, September 22, 1995) claims that\nNyerere's continued popularity, despite the failures of villagization, may be\npartly due to the ways in which resettlement and other national policies have\nworked to erode hierarchies of age and gender, thus improving the relative\nposition of younger people and of women.\n\n88\\. The pace of villagization slowed precipitously in late 1974, when a\ndrought that reduced the harvest by 50 percent followed on the heels of poor\nharvests from the preceding two years. It is difficult to specify the extent\nto which villagization and mandated cultivation exacerbated the food-supply\nshortage. Tanzania was, at any rate, obliged to import unprecedented amounts\nof foodstuffs at precisely the time when the costs of foreign oil and\nmachinery had skyrocketed. Although the food shortage made many peasants more\nwilling to move in exchange for food rations, they were less willing to hand\nover the food that they had grown to the state marketing boards. Under the\nstraitened circumstances, large-scale social experimentation was shelved. See\nHyden, Beyond Ujamaa in Tanzania, pp. 129-30, 141, 146, and Deborah Bryceson,\n\"Household, Hoe, and Nation: Development Policies of the Nyerere Era,\" in\nMichael Hodd, ed., Tanzania After Nyerere (London: Pinter, 1988), pp. 36-48.\n\n89\\. Much of the surplus-producing population of Tanzania has the decided tac\ntical advantage of living near the country's borders, making smuggling in both\ndirections a ready option.\n\n90\\. Here again, for the best source on the copying of administrative\nstructures, development plans, and economic organization among Marxist\nregimes, see Colburn, The Vogue of Revolution, especially chaps. 4 and 5, pp.\n49-77.\n\n91\\.

These\nfigures are a bit fishy. As each village was planned for a notional one\nthousand inhabitants, it looks as if they multiplied the number of villages by\nthe mandated population, adding perhaps a few additional inhabitants to\naccount for officials. Cohen and Isaksson were more inclined to take the\nregime at its word than were Clay and his colleagues at Cultural Survival.\n\n95\\. Ibid., p. 449.\n\n96\\. A similar geometrical meticulousness was followed in Pol Pot's Cambodia.\nWalls of earth were thrown up to make long, straight canals, eliminating\nirregular paddies and creating hectare squares of riceland. Concentration of\npopulation, forced labor, the prohibition of foraging or departure, the\ncontrol of food rations, and executions were carried to an extreme rarely seen\nin Ethiopia. See Ben Kiernan, The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in\nCambodia Under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979 (New Haven: Yale University Press,\n1996), chap. 5.\n\n97\\. Clay, Steingraber, and Niggli, The Spoils of Famine, p. 121. Like the\nSoviet Union, Ethiopia had a separate category of state farms that were run on\nthe basis of hired labor and were, at least initially, very highly mechanized.\nThey were expected to produce a supply of major grains and export crops that\nwould be under direct control of the government. In the late 1970s, as a\nresult of the slow voluntary move toward collectivization, the government\nbegan to identify for future state farms, flat, fertile areas for mechanized\nagriculture. The clearing of residents off such areas so that they could be\nused to produce directly for the state appears to be a primary reason for the\nvillagization in Bale\" (ibid., p. 149).\n\n98\\. Ibid., pp. 190-92, 204.\n\n99\\. The roots of this program can be traced to a 1973 World Bank report that\nrecommended the relocation of peasants from northern areas suffering from high\npopulation pressure, soil erosion, and deforestation,\" although it was termed\na policy response to famine in 1984-85 (Cohen and Isaksson, \"Villagization in\nEthiopia's Arsi Region,\" p. 443). Something of the logic of social control\nbehind these schemes can be found in the fine paper by Donald Donham,\n\"Conversion and Revolution in Maale, Ethiopia,\" Program in Agrarian Studies,\nYale University, New Haven, December 1, 1995.\n\n100\\. See, especially, Kebbede, The State and Development, pp. 5- 102, and\nClay, Steingraber, and Niggli, The Spoils of Famine, passim.\n\n101\\.

As one farmer told Clay, \"There are six kinds of sorghum I plant: two\nred kinds, two white kinds that are intermediate and ripen very fast. There\nare also types we eat while the fruit is still green. There are five kinds of\nteff and three kinds of corn: red, orange, and white. Each is planted\naccording to its season, and each has its own time to plant\" (ibid., p. 23).\n\n103\\. Ibid., p. 55.\n\n104\\. Food aid was, in turn, used to round up people for resettlement and,\nwhen resettled, to hold them there. A standard technique of the Dergue was to\nannounce a time and place for food distribution and then ship off the crowd\nthat assembled.\n\n105\\. An extreme version of this visual codification can be seen in\nCeausmescu's Romania, where hundreds of villages were destroyed in order to\nmake room for nonfunctioning towns with \"modern apartment flats\" (easier to\ncontrol) and where the countryside was divided up into zones of strict\nagricultural specialization as if it were a single enterprise with its own\ndivision of labor. The regime termed the entire exercise \"systematization.\"\nPerhaps the best treatment is to be found in Katherine Verdery, What Was\nSocialism and What Comes Next (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996),\nespecially chap. 6, pp. 133-67.\n\n106\\.

Zygmunt Bauman, in Modernity and the Holocaust (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1989), makes the same point with regard to the \"gardening\nmetaphor,\" which he sees as characteristic of modernist thought in general and\nNazi racial policies in particular.\n\n110\\. This point is made exceptionally well, both empirically and\nanalytically, in Sally Falk Moore, Social Facts and Fabrications, especially\nchap. 6.\n\n111\\. See, in this connection, the classic article arguing that our modest\ndegree of knowledge about the likely consequences of any major policy\ninitiative makes a strategy of \"crab-wise\" adjustments, which can be undone\nwithout great damage, the more prudent course: Charles E. Lindblom, \"The\nScience of Muddling Through,\" Public Administration Review 19 (Spring 1959):\n79-88. A follow-up article published twenty years later, \"Still Muddling, Not\nYet Through,\" may be found in Lindblom, Democracy and the Market System (Oslo:\nNorwegian University Presses, 1979), pp. 237-59.\n\n112\\. Proponents of this view forget or ignore, I think, the fact that in\norder to do its work, the market requires its own vast simplifications in\ntreating land (nature) and labor (people) as factors of production\n(commodities). This, in turn, can and has been profoundly destructive of human\ncommunities and of nature. In a sense, the simplification of the scientific\nforest compounds the simplification of scientific measurement and the\nsimplification made possible by the commercial market for wood. Karl Polanyi's\nclassic, The Great Transformation (Boston: Beacon Press, 1957), is still\nperhaps the best case against pure market logic.\n\n113\\. I am aware that the binary distinction between \"artificial\" and\n\"natural\" is ultimately untenable when it comes to things like languages and\ncommunities. By \"artificial,\" I mean languages and communities that are\nplanned centrally and at a single stroke, as it were, as opposed to\ncommunities that grow by accretion.\n\n114\\. See J. C.

One political advantage of a new capital is precisely that it does not\nbelong to any existing community. Founding a new capital avoids certain\ndelicate, if not explosive, choices that would otherwise have to be made. By\nthe same logic, English became the national language of India because it was\nthe only widely spoken language that did not belong exclusively to any\nparticular traditional community. It did belong, however, to India's English-\nspeaking intelligentsia, which was enormously privileged when its \"dialect\"\nbecame the national language. The United States and Australia, with no urban\npast to transcend, created planned capitals that represented a vision of\nprogress and order and that were, not incidentally, in stark contrast to\nindigenous settlement practices.\n\n121\\.

The large gap that thus develops between an inevitably thin\nauthoritarian high-modernist social fiction and the informal, \"deviant\"\npractices that cannot be openly avowed but that are its necessary complement\nis diagnostically characteristic. Although we shall return to this theme, here\nit is relevant to recall that the hypocrisy, cynicism, and comedy generated by\nthe gulf between the official pieties of a mendacious public sphere and the\npractices necessary to the reproduction of daily life often become the raw\nmaterial for such a society's finest literature, poetry, and song.\n\n###### Chapter 8: Taming Nature\n\n1\\.

For marketed crops in a fully commercialized system, profit maximization\nwould rarely be precisely the same as crop-volume maximization. Where labor\nwas scarce, cultivators would be more concerned about maximizing the crop\nreturn per unit of labor, whereas if land was scarce, the return per acre\nwould be the focus.\n\n3\\. Paul Richards, Indigenous Agricultural Revolution: Ecology and Food\nProduction in West Africa (London: Unwin Hyman, 1985), p. 160; in this chapter\nI rely heavily on this brilliant book. Richards is committed to scientific\nagricultural research but insists that it examine, without prejudice, the\nexisting practices of African farmers and that it reflect the actual problems\nand goals of local cultivators.\n\n4\\. The specifically structural and institutional interests that lead to\nagricultural policies favoring state power, urban consumption, and elite\neconomic interests have been spelled out persuasively by Robert Bates in\nMarkets and States in Tropical Africa: The Political Basis of Agricultural\nPolicies (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1981).

Each major grain has in the same family one or more\nlookalike \"obligate weeds,\" which thrive under precisely the same field\nconditions as the cultivar but which shatter their hardy seeds early and thus\nreseed themselves in the cultivated field.\n\n7\\. Harlan, Crops and Man, p. 127 (emphasis in original).\n\n8\\. In a Malay village where I carried out fieldwork for two years, each of\nthe older cultivators knew of roughly eighty varieties of rice by name and by\nits properties.\n\n9\\. In fact, the clearing or field is itself a powerful selector for\nresistance. Even if the cultivator were to randomly choose the seed stock for\nthe next season or, for that matter, leave the crop standing in the field to\nreseed itself, the resistance of next year's crop will increase, in a\nphenomenon called field resistance. Whichever landraces (including random\ncrosses and mutants) do best over time against pests, adverse weather, and so\non will contribute, willy-nilly, more of their seed to the subsequent season's\ncrop. See Harlan, Crops and Alan, pp. 117-33.\n\n10\\. \"Probably, the total genetic change achieved by farmers over the\nmillennia was far greater than that achieved by the last hundred or two years\nof more systematic, science-based efforts\" (Norman Simmonds, Principles of\nCrop Improvement [New York: Longman, 19791, cited by Jack Ralph Kloppenberg,\nJr., First the Seed: The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology, 1492-2000\n[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 19881, p. 185). As will be apparent, I\nam much indebted to Kloppenberg's fine analysis throughout much of this\nchapter.\n\n11\\. James Boyce, \"Biodiversity and Traditional Agriculture: Toward a New\nPolicy Agenda-a Pre-Proposal\" (unpublished paper, January 1996). See also\nBoyce, \"The Environmental Impact of North-South Trade: A Political Economy\nApproach,\" Working Paper 1996-3, Department of Economics, University of\nMassachusetts, Amherst, 1996. Actually, the relation between modern varieties\nand traditional agriculture is one of dependence rather than complementarity.\nTraditional agriculture does not require modern agriculture as a condition of\nits existence, whereas modern agriculture would appear to depend on the\ngenetic capital of the landraces. On this basis, Boyce argues for in situ\npreservation (as opposed to storage in seed banks) and development of\nlandraces by protecting traditional cultivators in these centers.\n\n12\\. Eye appeal has depended on aesthetic values that have often diverged\nmarkedly from matters of yields, taste, and even profitability. In the\nAmerican tradition of awarding prizes to fruits, vegetables, and livestock\nentered in competition at agricultural fairs, first prize has generally gone\nto the ideal ear of corn or the ideal pig despite the fact that they might be\neconomically inferior in terms of profitability. Of course, if a buyer was\nwilling to pay a sufficient \"aesthetic premium\" for the ideal pig, then\naesthetics and profit might coincide. See Kloppenberg, First the Seed, p. 96.\n\n13\\.

Kloppenberg continues, \"Hybrids were particularly attractive to\nthe vegetable industry, and spinach, carrots, cucumbers, and the brassicas\n(cabbage, cauliflower, etc.) have been hybridized and redesigned to permit\nnon-selective, once-over, machine harvesting\" (ibid.). It is worth noting\nthat, quite apart from the harvest, the mechanical cultivating, sorting, and\npacking of some crops had earlier influenced crop selection and breeding.\n\n15\\.

Ibid., p. 12.\n\n19\\. Another effect of genetic uniformity is to make the entire population of\nplants also vulnerable to the same environmental stresses.\n\n20\\. The first scientist to work out the mathematical model of plant epidemics\nwas van der Plank. See Committee on Genetic Vulnerability of Major Crops,\nGenetic Vulnerability of Major Crops, pp. 28-32.\n\n21\\. The same logic, of course, holds true for human diseases. Other things\nbeing equal, scattered populations are healthier than concentrated\npopulations. Urban populations in Western Europe did not successfully\nreproduce themselves until at least the nineteenth century; they depended on\nbeing demographically replenished from the comparatively healthy population in\nthe countryside. For the epidemiological reasons behind the association of\ndiversity and dispersion with health and the association of bio-uniformity and\nconcentration with high mortality, see Alfred Crosby, Ecological Imperialism:\nThe Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (New York: Cambridge University\nPress, 1988), and Mark Ridley, \"The Microbes' Opportunity,\" Times Literary\nSupplement, January 13, 1995, pp. 6-7. The logic of dispersion during\nepidemics was recognized long before anyone understood the causes or vectors\nof major epidemic diseases. See, for example, Daniel Defoe, A Journal of the\nPlague Year (1722; Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1966).\n\n22\\. Well, not quite. As we have learned, the profligate use of antibiotics on\nhumans and pesticides on crops runs up against the problem that the pathogens,\nwhich are the target of the attack, often adapt and mutate, through selection\npressures, faster than the human and plant defenses do. For this reason, new\ngenerations of pesticides must be created to keep one jump ahead of the\npathogens, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera, once\nthought extinct, have returned in more virulent strains. See, in this context,\nRandolph M. Nesse and George C. Williams, Evolution and Healing: The New\nScience of Darwinian Medicine (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1995).\n\n23\\.

Worldwide, cotton and\nhighyielding varieties of rice absorb the largest share of pesticides.\n\n25\\. Once again, there are striking parallels in human epidemics with the\ndevelopment of resistant strains of viral and bacterial diseases and resistant\nvectors of disease. See John Wargo's discussion of malaria and its carrier,\nthe Anopheles mosquito, in Our Children's Toxic Legacy: How Science and Law\nFail to Protect Us from Pesticides (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996),\npp. 15-42.\n\n26\\. \"The extensive use of herbicides has not been without its costs. Of\nforty-five iatrogenically (i.e., caused by our use of pesticides) induced\ndiseases of crop plants, thirty were found to be caused by herbicides\"\n(Kloppenberg, First the Seed, p. 247). The literature also abounds with cases\nof insecticides and other agents having indirect but equally devastating\nconsequences. In 1995, for example, the massive application of malathion to\ncontrol the boll weevil in Texas also killed many beneficial insects, thereby\ntouching off an explosion of army worms who ate most of the beet crop. See\n\"Where Cotton's King, Trouble Reigns,\" New York Times, October 9, 1995, p.\nA10, and Sam Howe Verhovek, \"In Texas, an Attempt to Swat an Old Pest Stirs a\nRevolt,\" New York Times, January 24, 1996, p.

To take a minor crop, of the peas planted commercially in\n1969, 96 percent were in only two varieties. A small dress rehearsal for the\ncorn blight of 1970 could have been witnessed in the case of oats. A \"miracle\noat,\" Victoria, was bred to resist all forms of crown rust fungus. It was\nplanted throughout the country in 1940 and, in 1946, succumbed to a\ndevastating epidemic. Because oats by that time were not as widely planted as\nearlier in the century, the disaster was not much reported.\n\n30\\.

This article is the subject of a scathing critique by\nWendell Berry in The Unsettling of America: Culture and Agriculture (San\nFrancisco: Sierra Club Books, 1977), chap. 5. It is remarkable how little of\nthe article, as an \"informed\" fantasy, holds up from the vantage point of\n1997.

In this\ndiscussion I shall use the terms \"polycropping\" and \"mixed cropping\"\ninterchangeably. Intercropping is a form of polycropping in which a second\ncultigen in planted between rows of the first. Relay cropping refers to a\nsequence of crops that overlap in the field and is thus also a form of\npolyculture.\n\n35\\. The more stringent the climate, the less the biodiversity. As one\napproaches the tundra, the number of species of trees, mammals, and insects\ndiminishes. The same, of course, applies to the climatic zones created by\nsuccessively higher elevations in mountainous terrains.\n\n36\\. Quoted in Paul Richards, \"Ecological Change and the Politics of African\nLand Use,\" African Studies Review 26, no. 2 (June 1983): 40. Richards also\nquotes Dudley Stamp, who at about the same time wrote enthusiastically about\nthe wider applicability of African techniques for combating soil erosion: \"A\nrecent tour of Nigeria has convinced the writer that the native farmer has\nalready evolved a scheme of farming which cannot be bettered in principle even\nif it can be improved in detail and that, as practised in some areas, this\nscheme affords almost complete protection against soil erosion and loss of\nfertility. It may be that the African has thus a contribution to make towards\nthe solution of the great soil erosion problems in other regions\" (p. 23).\n\n37\\. Edgar Anderson, Plants, Man, and Life (Boston: Little, Brown, 1952), pp.\n140-41. It goes without saying that the gardens Anderson is describing are so\ndiverse in part because the villagers in question wish to grow many of the\nfoods needed for subsistence rather than paying for them in the market. The\npoint, however, is the plan behind the visual disorder.\n\n38\\. Richards, Indigenous Agricultural Revolution, p. 63.\n\n39\\. Ibid., p. 70.\n\n40\\. Most traditional cropping systems, whether polyculture or crop rotation,\ncombine a grain and a legume in this fashion.\n\n41\\. Richards, Indigenous Agricultural Revolution, pp. 66-70.\n\n42\\. H.

Mixed cropping\n(polyculture) must not be confused with mixed farming, which indicates a farm\nproducing a variety of crops (each typically on its own plot) and livestock on\nthe European smallholder model.\n\n43\\. Richards, \"Ecological Change and the Politics of African Land Use,\" p.\n27.\n\n44\\. This is just one example of how the choice of technique is influenced by\nthe factor endowments of the farmer-a large consideration, but by no means the\nonly one.\n\n45\\. Strictly speaking, many of these advantages could also be obtained by\nplanting many tiny parcels to single cultivars. What would be lost are the\nspecific advantages of polycropping mentioned earlier.\n\n46\\. \"Mycorrhizal association\" refers to the symbiotic relation between the\nmycelium of certain fungi and the roots of a seed plant.\n\n47\\. Rachel Carson, Silent Spring (1962; Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p.\n10.\n\n48\\. Organic farmers have occasionally opted for mixed cropping as a way of\navoiding the heavy use of fertilizers and insecticides. The most common\nobstacle to certain (not all) forms of polyculture is that they are too labor\nintensive in a context where labor is the scarce factor of production. It is\nhard to know how much of this labor intensiveness is the result of the fact\nthat virtually all machine implements have been designed with monoculture\nexclusively in mind. One pioneer, Wes Jackson, has demonstrated that, over a\nthree-year period and in production terms alone, polyculture can outperform\nmonoculture. The fact that the gains to polyculture are greater in the second\nand third years suggests that the interaction effects between the two crops\nare responsible for the performance (Jackson, \"Becoming Native to This Place,\"\npaper presented at the Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University, New\nHaven, November 18, 1994). Jackson, like Howard, is primarily concerned with\ndeveloping a form of agriculture that will preserve or enhance its soil\ncapital. Such preservation is less urgent in stable bottomland but vital in\necological zones with fragile soils (e.g., hillsides and uplands). The\npolycropping of perennials seems particularly suitable to achieving this end.\n\n49\\. Comparative experimental studies of prairie ecologies have confirmed\nDarwin's original premise that more diverse ecosystems are more productive and\nresilient. Ecologists at the University of Minnesota compared 147 one-\nhundredsquare-foot plots sown with different numbers of randomly chosen grass\nspecies. \"The more species a plot had, the greater its biomass of plants and\nthe more nitrogen it had taken up in its increased growth\"; \"the fewer the\nspecies, the sparser the growth and the greater the amount of nitrogen\nleaching out of upper soil layers.\" After a drought, the plots with the larger\nnumber of species returned more rapidly to full productivity than did the\nplots with fewer species. Productivity increased dramatically with each\nspecies added up to ten species, and each species added thereafter offered\nmuch less to overall productivity. In the long run, it has been theorized,\nadditional species might prove vital in protecting the ecosystem against\nextremes of weather or pest infestations. See Carol Kaesuk Yoon, \"Ecosystem's\nProductivity Rises with Diversity of Its Species,\" New York Times, March 5,\n1996, p. C4.\n\n50\\. These advantages might include, on the cost side, lower expenditures for\nsuch inputs as fertilizers and pesticides.\n\n51\\. Those who investigate the order that lies behind seemingly turbulent\nnatural systems (clouds, water flows, air turbulence, epidemics, etc.) have\ncome to contrast what they call fractal systems with linear systems. The key\ndifference of relevance to us is the flexibility and sturdiness of fractal\nprocesses, which can survive perturbations and function over a wide range of\nfrequencies-a quality com mon to many biological processes. In contrast,\nlinear processes, once they are knocked off the rails, continue to veer off on\nthe new tangent, never to return to the original equilibrium range.\nPolyculture, in just this sense, has a greater tolerance of disturbances.\n\n52\\. Up to a point. Jacobs shows how a neighborhood's success can have effects\non property values that will undermine some uses and will eventually transform\nthe place. There is no equilibrium in Jacobs's view, only a cycle that begins\nrepeatedly in different parts of a city.\n\n53\\. Shifting cultivation is also common throughout much of Southeast Asia and\nLatin America.\n\n54\\. Harold C. Conklin, Hanunoo Agriculture: A Report on an Integral System of\nShifting Cultivation in the Philippines (Rome: Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations, 1957), p. 85. One cannot come away from\nConklin's meticulous account without a sense of awe at the breadth of\nknowledge and skills of these cultivators.\n\n55\\. And that, of course, was part of the reason why such populations often\nremained in, or fled to, non-state spaces.\n\n56\\. Richards, Indigenous Agricultural Revolution, p. 50. Richards continues:\n\"The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, W. G. A.\nOrmsbyGore, summed up the attitude of the day when noting that in Sierra\nLeone, for example, 'the natural forest has been ruthlessly destroyed to find\nvirgin soil for the cultivation of \"hill\" or \"land\" rice'\" (pp. 50-51).\n\n57\\. Ibid., p. 42.\n\n58\\. See ibid., chap. 2. Richards concludes: \"From the point of view of\nfertilization, modern soil science confirms the validity of the forest\nfarmer's emphasis on ash and the savannah farmer's emphasis on 'manure' and\n'compost'\" (p. 61). For an excellent analysis of the techniques of burning in\nHonduras, see Kees Jansen, \"The Art of Burning and the Politics of Indigenous\nAgricultural Knowledge.\" paper presented at a congress entitled \"Agrarian\nQuestions: The Politics of Farming Anno 1995,\" May 22-24, 1995, Wageningen,\nThe Netherlands.\n\n59\\. Richards, Indigenous Agricultural Revolution, p. 43. In this context\nRichards is accepting the premise that the only test is market efficiency,\nproviding that it is sustainable.\n\n60\\. Ibid., p. 61.\n\n61\\. Liebig did believe that his formula could cure all soil problems.\n\n62\\. Among the many experiments that Howard conducted were elaborate trials of\n\"green manuring\" (the plowing under of a nitrogen-fixing, leguminous crop\nprior to the planting of a grain crop), which showed that its effect depended\ngreatly on these other variables as well as the right timing and the amount of\nmoisture in the soil in order to promote the chemical reactions (first aerobic\nand then anaerobic) necessary for the production of more humus. See Sir Albert\nHoward, An Agricultural Testament (London: Oxford University Press, 1940).\n\n63\\. Alkalization occurs as well with the salts left behind in the course of\nintensive irrigation. Growers in those areas of the Imperial Valley in\nCalifornia suffering from alkalization have had to install drainage tiles at\nshorter and shorter intervals over the years in order to prevent the buildup\nfrom reaching ruinous proportions.\n\n64\\. Rice, an Old World plant, had come much earlier and been adapted.\nAlthough a perennial, rice is planted as if it were an annual.\n\n65\\. Just how deep this history is, is reflected in the fact that modern man\nhas added no important domesticated species of plant or animal in the last\nfour thousand years. This story can be followed in Carl O. Sauer, Agricultural\nOrigins and Dispersals (New York: American Geographical Society, 1952). Sauer\nrelies heavily on an important work by the pioneer Russian scientist in this\narea, N. 1. Vavilov: The Origin, Variation, Immunity, and Breeding of\nCultivated Plants, trans. K. Starr Chester, vol. 13, nos. 1-6, of Chronica\nbotanica (1949-50). Potatoes are a good example of a plant that must be\nvegetatively propagated by cuttings.\n\n66\\. There are exceptions, one of which seems to be the ecologically\ndevastated northern part of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is worth adding that\nneither does the record of the industrialized world in soil erosion, pollution\nor exhaustion of groundwater, and global warming represent an edifying example\nof foresight.\n\n67\\. Robert Chambers, Rural Development: Putting the Last First (London:\nLongman, 1983), quoted in Richards, Indigenous Agricultural Revolution, p. 40.\nThere is a case to be made for Howard's claim that \"agricultural revolutions\"\nare always acts of autonomous farmers rather than states. From the\nagricultural revolution in Britain that laid the groundwork for\nindustrialization to the broad adoption of such new crops as cocoa, tobacco,\nand maize in Africa, Howard's generalization rings true. It does not hold\ntrue, however, for large-scale irrigation projects or for the more recent,\nresearch-driven breeding of high-yielding varieties of wheat, rice, and maize.\nThese state-sponsored innovations typically have powerful implications for\ncentralization.\n\n68\\. James Ferguson, The Anti-Politics Machine: \"Development,\"\nDepoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1990). Ferguson shows brilliantly how the institutional\npower of international and national development agencies depends vitally on\ntheir representing their activities as neutral interventions by scientific\nspecialists.\n\n69\\. It might be objected that, in the case of large irrigation works, a\ncentralized logic is mandatory for the apportionment of water rights between\nupstream and downstream users. The fact is that quite large irrigation systems\nhave been successfully organized for hundreds of years without centralized\npolitical authorities exercising coercive powers. For a remarkable study\nshowing how such a system worked and how it was nearly destroyed by the\n\"simplifications\" imposed by hydrological experts and agronomists from the\nAsian Development Bank, see J. Steven Lansing, Priests and Programmers:\nTechnologies of Power in the Engineered Landscape of Bali (Princeton:\nPrinceton University Press, 1991). Also useful is Elinor Ostrom, Governing the\nCommons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1990).\n\n70\\. Quoted in Stephen A. Marglin, \"Farmers, Seedsmen, and Scientists: Systems\nof Agriculture and Systems of Knowledge\" (unpublished paper, May 1991, revised\nMarch 1992). Marglin's account is an astute analysis of the ecological and\ninstitutional consequences of scientific agriculture. His analysis of\nknowledge systems has strong parallels with my own analysis of metis in\nchapter 8. We each independently discovered the value of using concepts of\nknowledge from Greek philosophy to distinguish practical knowledge from\ndeductive knowledge. I have found his discussion helpful and clarifying.\nMarglin's analysis of American agricultural practice is usefully read along\nwith Deborah Fitzgerald, Yeomen No More: The Industrialization of American\nAgriculture (forthcoming).\n\n71\\. Marglin, \"Farmers, Seedsmen, and Scientists,\" p. 7.\n\n72\\. The term \"hybrid\" has changed in meaning. Originally, it referred to any\ncross; now it refers only to crosses between two inbred \"pure\" lines.\n\n73\\. Marglin notes the close collaboration between the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture and the large seed companies, which helped the latter achieve\ndominance in maize hybrids. The same dominance is less likely for wheat and\nrice, which are self-pollinating. Improved yields for these crops are achieved\nwith new varieties which are genetically stable. Marglin, \"Farmers, Seedsmen,\nand Scientists,\" p. 17.\n\n74\\. Since such control is only approximated in most real experiments, every\nexperiment is followed by a great deal of discussion about the \"extraneous\nvariables,\" or variables other than those singled out by the experimental\ndesign, which might have produced the findings. The findings in such cases are\nambiguous until a subsequent experiment controls the rogue variables.\n\n75\\. Marglin, \"Farmers, Seedsmen, and Scientists,\" p. 5.\n\n76\\. Mitchell Feigenbaum, quoted in James Gleick, Chaos: Making a New Science\n(New York: Penguin, 1988), p. 185.\n\n77\\. Experimental laboratory science is necessarily carried out using a\nstandardized and purified nature (e.g., purified reagents from catalogues) and\nman-made instruments of observation. The reliable manipulation of such objects\nmakes for successful experiments and a certain level of self-vindication in\nlaboratory practice. See Theodore M. Porter, Trust in Numbers: The Pursuit of\nObjectivity in Science and Public Life (Princeton: Princeton University Press,\n1995), chap. 1.

Berry, The Unsettling of'America, pp. 70-71. There is no reason, in\nprinciple, why the dependent variable of greatest interest cannot be, say,\nnutritional value, the timing of tillering, taste, or hardiness. But the\nresearch is more manageable when the variable of interest is less subjective\nand more easily quantifiable.\n\n79\\. D. S. Ngambeki and G. F.

In addition to the difficulties in finding the \"active\" cause among many\npossibilities, such a study of polycropping would have to find and justify a\nformula for comparing different combinations of yields. Assuming the same\ncosts, which is superior: a yield of two hundred bushels of lima beans and\nthree hundred bushels of corn, or a yield of three hundred bushels of lima\nbeans and two hundred bushels of corn? Does one arrive at a common denominator\nby using market prices (which would mean the answer would vary week by week\nand year by year), caloric content, overall nutritive value, or some other\nmeasure? The difficulties rapidly pile up.\n\n83\\. That is, this is a version of the solar system that discounts all the\nvarious moons, asteroids, nearby stars, and so on.\n\n84\\. Writing in 1977, Wendell Berry rhetorically asked the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture: \"Where are the control plots which test the various systems of\nsoil management? Where are the performance figures for present-day small farms\nusing draft animals, small scale technologies, and alternative energy sources?\nWhere are the plots kept free of agricultural chemicals? If these exist, then\nthey are the best-kept secrets of our time. But if they do not exist, whence\ncomes the scientific authority of scientific agriculture? Without appropriate\ncontrols, one has no proof; one does not, in any respectable sense, have an\nexperiment\" (The Unsettling of America, p. 206). Since that time, such\ncomparisons have been made, with many of the results reported in a USDA study\non organic farming entitled Report and Recommendations on Organic Fanning,\nprepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Team on Organic Farming\n(Washington: USDA, 1980). The parallels with the West African story are\nstriking. In each case certain practices were deemed not to be worth\ninvestigating, partly because they and their practitioners were presumed to be\nbackward and inefficient. Only when the anomalies and long-run consequences of\nmainstream doctrines became apparent were such practices examined carefully.\n\n85\\. Aspirin, for example, which has long been used to alleviate headaches,\nhas turned out to have a number of other beneficial effects that were\ndiscovered only recently.\n\n86\\. With hindsight, one could still argue that, in terms of a cost-benefit\nanalysis, the reduction in disease was so valuable that it outweighed any harm\ncaused to the environment. But that is not the point. The point is that the\ncosts in this case were outside the experimental model and could not have been\nassessed in any event.\n\n87\\. Philip M. Raup, University of Minnesota, testifying before the U.S.\nSenate Small Business Committee (March 1, 1972), quoted in Wendell Berry, The\nUnsettling of America, p. 171.\n\n88\\.

Harlan, Crops and\nMan, p. 129, reports that a selection of barley left in the field as seed\nstock over a trial of sixty years produced 95 percent of the yield that plant\nbreeders would have been able to achieve and were almost certainly hardier and\nmore disease resistant strains of barley.\n\n90\\. The classic study of the family development cycle is A. V. Chayanov, The\nTheory of Peasant Economy, introduction by Teodor Shanin (Madison: University\nof Wisconsin Press, 1986). One of the policy arguments for the stable family\nfarm as an institution is that it is more likely than a capitalist firm to\nhave an intergenerational interest in maintaining or improving the quality of\nthe land and environment. The same logic has traditionally been deployed to\nargue that many forms of sharecropping and tenancy lead to destructive\npractices.\n\n91\\.

Berry, The Unsettling of America, p. 87. I do not consider myself to be a\ngood farmer in Berry's sense of the term, but in a three-acre sheep pasture on\nmy small farm, I can recognize at least six different soil conditions from the\npatterns of vegetation alone.

One can see why the logic of scientific agriculture would make extension\nagents the implacable enemies of multiple plots and multiple cultivars.\nTogether they place far too many variables in play for scientific method to\nmodel.\n\n103\\. Van der Ploeg, \"Potatoes and Knowledge,\" p. 213.\n\n104\\. In a larger sense, irrigation, standard fertilizer applications,\ngreenhouses, cloud seeding, and hybridization and cloning represent the\ndecision to adapt the climate and environment to the crop rather than the crop\nto the environment. These are what Vernon W. Ruttan has called \"land\nsubstitutes.\" See \"Constraints on the Design of Sustainable Systems of\nAgricultural Production;' Ecological Economics 10 (1994): 209-19.\n\n105\\. Some agricultural environments lend themselves to abstract treatment\nmore easily than others. Well-watered bottomlands with rich soils not subject\nto erosion can be treated more homogeneously without great immediate harm,\nwhereas fragile, semiarid hillsides subject to sheet and gully erosion need to\nbe treated with great care.\n\n106\\. Yaney, The Urge to Mobilize, p. 445.\n\n107\\. Van der Ploeg, \"Potatoes and Knowledge,\" p. 222. The author does not\nspecify the precise reasons for the decline. It is possible that the strongly\nrecommended monocropping of the new variety encourages the buildup of pest\npopulations and disease, that it depletes the soil of vital nutrients or\ndamages its structural properties, or that the genotype loses its vigor over\ntwo or three generations.\n\n108\\. The talisman of vitamins offers something of a parallel. The discovery\nof their existence and their role in health was an important breakthrough, but\nthey are now taken by masses of people, most of whom may not need them, in\none-size-fitsall dosages, rather in the way some of our ancestors felt\nprotected by wearing garlands of garlic around their necks.\n\n109\\.

The version of the story that I know appears not to specify the species of\noak, whether white, red, burr, or other variety, or the species of squirrel,\nwhich was pre sumably the common gray squirrel. For the Native Americans, the\ncontext must have served to specify such details as these.\n\n6\\. I am ignoring, in my treatment of the almanac's advice, the fact that\nEuropean settlers quickly developed their own comparable rules of thumb, and\nlike farmers everywhere, they were paying close attention to what other\ncultivators were doing. One usually does not want to be the first to plow and\nplant, nor does one want to be the last.\n\n7\\. Quoted in Ian Hacking, The Taming of Chance (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1990), p. 62. Note that even in Quetelet's formula, the\ncalculations must begin with an unpredictable event: the \"last frost.\" Since\nthe date of the last frost can be known only in retrospect, Quetelet's formula\nfails as a useful guide for action.\n\n8\\. Such terms as \"indigenous technical knowledge\" and \"folk wisdom\" seem to\nme to confine this knowledge to \"traditional\" or \"backward\" peoples, whereas I\nwant to emphasize how these skills are implicit in the most modern of\nactivities, whether on the factory floor or in a research laboratory. \"Local\nknowledge\" and \"practical knowledge\" are better, but both terms seem too\ncircumscribed and static to capture the constantly changing, dynamic aspect of\nmetis.\n\nThe term descends to us from Greek mythology. Metis, the first bride of Zeus,\nhad tricked Cronos into swallowing an herb that caused him to regurgitate\nZeus's elder brothers, whom Cronos feared would rise against him. Zeus in turn\nswallowed Metis, thereby incorporating all her intelligence and wiles, before\nshe could give birth to Athena. Athena was then born from Zeus's thigh.\n\n9\\. The difference between the first halting, awkward steps of a toddler and\nthe gait of a child who has been walking for a year is a measure of the\ncomplexity and \"on-the-job training\" necessary to master such an apparently\nsimple skill.\n\n10\\. During the Gulf War, teams with little experience were hired from all\nover the world to cope with an unprecedented number of fires. A great many new\ntechniques were tried, and much new field experience gained. One team hit on\nthe use of a mounted jet engine (as opposed to dynamite or water) to literally\nblow out the fire at the wellhead, as if it were a candle on a birthday cake.\n\n11\\. It is in part this aspect of team sports that often makes the outcomes\nnontransitive. That is, team A may routinely beat team B, and team B may\nroutinely beat team C, but because of the particular relation of skills\nbetween teams A and C, team C may often beat team A.\n\n12\\. Taoism emphasizes precisely this kind of knowledge and skill. Compare\nPeirce's observation with that of Chuang Tzu: \"Cook Ting laid down his knife\nand replied. What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I\nfirst began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three\nyears I no longer saw the whole ox. And now-now I go at it by spirit and don't\nlook with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and the\nspirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the\nbig hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and follow things as\nthey are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a joint\"\n(Chuang Tzu: Basic Writings, trans. Burton Watson [New York: Columbia\nUniversity Press, 1964], p. 47).\n\n13\\. Michael Oakeshott, Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays (New York:\nBasic Books, 1962). As a conservative thinker in the Burkean sense of the\nterm, Oakeshott tends to be an apologist for whatever the past has bequeathed\nto the present in terms of power, privilege, and property. On the other hand,\nhis criticism of purely rationalist schemes for the design of human life and\nhis understanding of the contingency of practice are astute and telling.\n\n14\\. Martha C. Nussbaum, The Fragility of Goodness: Luck and Ethics in Greek\nTragedy and Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 302.\nNussbaum is concerned particularly with the differences between moral systems\nthat allow for the passions and attachments of human life and closed, self-\nsufficient moral systems that achieve \"moral safety and rational power\" at the\nexpense of a fully human life. Plato, depending upon how one interprets the\nSymposium, is an exemplar of the latter, and Aristotle an exemplar of the\nformer.\n\n15\\. I am greatly indebted for this distinction to the brilliant doctoral\nthesis of Gene Ammarell, \"Bugis Navigation\" (Ph.D. diss., Department of\nAnthropology, Yale University, 1994). Ammarell's analysis of traditional Bugis\nnavigation techniques is the most compelling understanding of indigenous\ntechnical knowledge that I have encountered.\n\n16\\. Compare the pilot's knowledge with this observation, from Bruce Chatwin's\nSonglines (London: Jonathan Cape, 1987): \"The dry heart of Australia ... was a\njigsaw of microclimates, of different minerals in the soil and different\nplants and animals. A man raised in one part of the desert would know its\nflora and fauna backwards. He knew which plant attracted game. He knew his\nwater. He knew where there were tubers underground. In other words, by naming\nall the 'things' in his territory, he could always count on survival.... But\nif you took him blindfolded to another country... he might end up lost and\nstarving\" (p. 269).\n\n17\\. In what follows I am heavily indebted to the discussions of Nussbaum, The\nFragility of Goodness, and to Stephen A. Marglin, \"Losing Touch: The Cultural\nConditions of Worker Accommodation and Resistance,\" in Frederique Apffel\nMarglin and Stephen A. Marglin, eds., Dominating Knowledge: Development,\nCulture, and Resistance (Oxford: Clarendon, 1990), pp. 217-82. Marglin's\nargument has been elaborated in two subsequent papers: \"Farmers, Seedsmen, and\nScientists: Systems of Agriculture and Systems of Knowledge\" (unpublished\npaper, May 1991, revised March 1992); and \"Economics and the Social\nConstruction of the Economy,\" in Stephen Gudeman and Stephen A. Marglin, eds.,\nPeople's Ecology, People's Economy (forthcoming). Readers of both texts will\nnote the disparity between Nussbaum's and Marglin's uses of the term \"techne:\"\nFor Nussbaum, techne is analogous to episteme, at least through the work of\nPlato, and both are sharply distinguished from metis or practical knowledge.\nMarglin uses the word \"techne\" (\"T/Knowledge\") in much the same way that I use\n\"metis,\" and he distinguishes it sharply from \"episteme\" (\"E/Knowledge)\"). I\nhave elected to adopt the terminology of the classicist Nussbaum, who\nconvinces me that her usage has a far stronger grounding in the original texts\nof Plato and Aristotle. Support for Nussbaum's understanding comes also from\nPierre Vidal-Naquet: \"As G. Cambiano justly [correctly] observes, in the\nPlatonic view, episteme, dynamis, and techne comprise a system of concepts\nthat mutually reinforce one another,\" he writes. \"The Republic, for example,\nputs under the control of mathematics a unit composed of technai, dianoiai,\nand epistemai: skills, intellectual processes, and sciences\" (The Black\nHunter: Forms of Thought and Forms of Society in the Greek World, trans.\nAndrew Szegedy-Maszak [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1986], p. 228). Even\nso, those who are familiar with Marglin's argument will note how, in drawing\nformal comparisons, I have relied on his contrasts while not using his terms.\n\n18\\. As I recall, this holds only at sea level, as with the standard\ntemperature for water's boiling point. The constant is, then, a universal\nconvention and does in fact vary by altitude.\n\n19\\. Quoted in Nussbaum, The Fragility of Goodness, p. 95.\n\n20\\. There is a large and rapidly growing literature on the practice or\nethnomethodology of science, particularly laboratory science. Most of this\nliterature emphasizes the difference between actual scientific practice on one\nhand and its codified form (in articles and lab reports, for example) on the\nother. For an intro duction to this literature, see Bruno Latour, Science in\nAction: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society (Cambridge:\nHarvard University Press, 1987); Ian Hacking, \"The Self-Vindication of the\nLaboratory Sciences,\" in Andrew Pickering, ed., Science as Practice and\nCulture (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), pp. 29-64; and Andrew\nPickering, \"From Science as Knowledge to Science as Practice,\" ibid., pp.\n1-26. See also Pickering, \"Objectivity and the Mangle of Practice,\" in Allan\nMegill, ed., Rethinking Objectivity (Durham: Duke University Press, 1994), pp.\n109-25.\n\n21\\. Marglin, \"Losing Touch,\" p. 234.\n\n22\\. In many ways the most searching philosophical treatment of these issues\nis found in Michael Polanyi, Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical\nPhilosophy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958).\n\n23\\.

I use \"himself\" because Plato is talking about what he considered to be\nthe highest form of love: that between men and boys.\n\n27\\. Music is, in a sense, pure form, but Plato was deeply suspicious of\nmusic's emotional appeal and in fact believed that the ideal republic should\nban certain modes of music.\n\n28\\. An important critique of social science might well take this observation\nas a point of departure. Borrowing the prestige of scientific language and\nmethods from the biological sciences, many social scientists have envisioned\nand tried to effect an objective, precise, and strictly replicable set of\ntechniques-a set of techniques that gives impartial and quantitative answers.\nThus most forms of formal policy analysis and cost-benefit analysis manage,\nthrough heroic assumptions and an implausible metric for comparing\nincommensurate variables, to produce a quantitative answer to thorny\nquestions. They achieve impartiality, precision, and replicability at the cost\nof accuracy. A brief and persuasive case along these lines can be found in\nTheodore M. Porter, \"Objectivity as Standardization: The Rhetoric of\nImpersonality in Measurement, Statistics, and Cost-Benefit Analysis,\" in Allan\nMegill, ed., Rethinking Objectivity (Durham: Duke University Press, 1994), pp.\n197-237.\n\n29\\.

See Hacking, The Taming of Chance. Warren Weaver long ago distinguished\nbetween what he termed \"disorganized complexity,\" which could be dealt with\nthrough statistical techniques that captured average outcomes, and \"organized\ncomplexity\" (including, most notably, organic systems), which could not yield\nto such techniques because the complexity of their nonrandom, systemic\nrelationships prevents us from fully understanding first-order effects of an\nintervention, let alone second- or third-order effects (\"Science and\nComplexity,\" American Scientist 36 [1948]: 536-44).\n\n32\\. Marglin, \"Economics and the Social Construction of the Economy,\" pp.\n44-45.\n\n33\\. But while the focus has narrowed in economics, the reach has grown.\nWitness the efforts of William D. Nordhaus to treat such ecological issues as\nglobal warming with an often spurious precision. See Nordhaus, \"To Slow or Not\nto Slow: The Economics of the Greenhouse Effect,\" Economic Journal, July 1991,\npp. 920-37.\n\n34\\. Marglin, \"Economics and the Social Construction of the Economy,\" p. 31.\nMarglin also describes and critiques the attempts within the boundaries of\nepistemic economics to deal with such issues as public goods, sustainability,\nand un certainty. Friedrich Hayek himself was a skeptic: \"The delusion that\nadvancing theoretical knowledge places us everywhere increasingly in a\nposition to reduce complex interconnections to ascertainable particular facts\noften leads to new scientific errors.... Such errors are largely due to an\narrogation of pretended knowledge, which in fact no one possesses and which\neven the advance of science is not likely to give us\" (Studies in Philosophy,\nEconomics, and Politics [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967], p. 197).\n\n35\\. At its most extreme, this strategy is analogous to that of tracking body\ncounts during the Vietnam War-a technique that offered at least one precise\nmeasure, it was thought, for military progress.\n\n36\\.

Thus in the Phaedrus, Socrates, speaking through Plato,\ndeplores the invention of writing and claims that books cannot reply to\nquestions. He argues for the organic unity of a work of art, one whose\narguments and style should take into account the prospective audience.

There are different models of scientific medicine as well, some of which\nrequire a fundamentally different optic than standard allopathic practice.\nThus Darwinian medicine looks at the adaptive functions of what are otherwise\nseen as pathological conditions. One example is morning sickness, which occurs\nfor many women during the first trimester of pregnancy and which is thought to\nbe an adaptive rejection of foods, particularly of fruits and vegetables, that\nare most likely to carry toxins harmful to the fetus. Another example is fever\nduring the course of ordinary influenza or a cold, which is thought to be an\nadaptive mechanism for triggering elements of the immune system to combat\ninfection. To the degree that the Darwinian perspective is correct, it forces\nus to ask what the beneficial or, more precisely, the adaptive functions of a\nmedical condition might be. Surely, a view of plant disease from this angle\nmight lead to novel insights. For an accessible introduction, see Randolph M.\nNesse and George C. Williams, Evolution and Healing: The New Science of\nDarwinian Medicine (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1995).\n\n48\\. Much of F. A. Marglin's account is concerned with the undoubtedly\nwellintended but coercive efforts made by the British to suppress variolation\nand to substitute vaccination, as well as the popular resistance to these\nefforts. Marglin implies that the British pretty quickly succeeded in\nreplacing variolation with vaccination, but Sumit Guha, an Indian colleague\nwho has also studied these matters, believes that it is unlikely that the\nBritish had either the personnel or the power to stamp out variolation so\nquickly.\n\n49\\.

For the case of jet engines, the performance of which \"remains\nnotoriously uncertain in the development process\" and which have to be\nadjusted by engineers with long experience after pilots conduct in-flight\ntesting, see Nathan Rosenberg, Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics\n(New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982), especially pp. 120-41. Rosenberg\nmakes it clear that the limits of scientific methodology in this case have to\ndo with the impossibility of anticipating the interactive consequences of the\nenormous number of independent variables (including different technologies) at\nwork in a jet engine.

A similar story tells of a man dying in a Chicago hospital of a disease\nthat the physicians could not diagnose. Although they knew that the man's\ntrips abroad meant that he could have been suffering from a tropical ailment,\ntheir tests and researches were to no avail. One day, an experienced doctor\nfrom India was simply walking through the ward with a colleague on his way to\nan appointment when he stopped, sniffed the air, and said, \"There's a bloke\nhere with X\" (I don't recall the name of the disease). He was correct, but\nunfortunately the patient was too far gone to be saved.\n\n59\\. Howard, An Agricultural Testament, pp. 29-30.\n\n60\\.

Bugis sailors are exceptionally astute observers of their environment at\nsea and have assembled a large array of signs to forecast weather, wind,\nlandfall, and tides. The dominant color of rainbows carries meaning: yellow\nmeans more rain, blue means more wind. A morning rainbow in the northwest\nsignals the beginning of the western monsoon. The slaty-breasted rail's call,\nif it is a buzzing \"kech, kech, kech,\" means a change in the wind. When\nraptors soar very high, rain is no more than two days away. Many of these\nreliable associations could perhaps be explained more \"scientifically,\" but\nthey have served as rapid, accurate, and occasionally lifesaving signals for\ngenerations.\n\n62\\. Ammarell, \"Bugis Navigation,\" chap. 5, pp. 220-82.\n\n63\\. An alternative, the subject of a growing literature, is the term\n\"indigenous knowledge\" or \"indigenous technical knowledge.\" Although I have\nnothing against this term per se, inasmuch as it points to the skills and\nexperience already in the possession of the subjects of development schemes,\nit has come in some hands to connote something self-contained, completely\nsufficient, and intractably opposed to modern scientific knowledge, when in\nfact it is constantly changing through experimentation and through contact\nwith the outside. For two exceptionally perceptive critiques of the term, see\nAkil Gupta, \"The Location of 'the Indigenous' in Critiques of Modernity,\"\nNinety-First Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association, San\nFrancisco, December 2-6, 1992, and Arun Agrawal, \"Indigenous and Scientific\nKnowledge,\" Indigenous Knowledge and Development Monitor 4, no. 1 (April\n1996): 1-11, and the commentary following it. See also Agrawal, \"Dismantling\nthe Divide Between Indigenous and Scientific Knowledge.\" Development and\nChange 26, no. 3 (1995): 413-39.\n\n64\\. For a general argument along these line, see Eric Hobsbawm and T. O.\nRanger, The Invention o/ Tradition (New York: Cambridge University Press,\n1983). Although Hobsbawm and Ranger are largely concerned with traditions\n\"invented\" by elites to legitimate their rule and legitimacy, their general\npoint about the nonantiquity of many so-called traditions is well taken.\n\n65\\. 1 do not deal here with such related issues as how readily people abandon\nhabits and norms that are perhaps closer to the center of their self-identity:\ndeath rituals, religious beliefs, ideas about friendship, and so on. One of\nthe most curious and important aspects of adaptation, however, is that the\npoor and marginal are often in the vanguard of innovations that do not require\na lot of capital. This is not at all surprising when one considers that, for\nthe poor, a gamble often makes sense if their current practices are failing\nthem. Occasionally, when a whole community or a culture experiences an\noverwhelming sense of powerlessness and its categories no longer make sense of\nthe world, such gambles take on millennial tones, with new prophets arising to\nproclaim the way forward. The colonial conquest of preindustrial peoples, the\nGerman Peasant War at the time of the Reformation, the English Civil War, and\nthe French Revolution seem to belong in this category.\n\n66\\. James Ferguson, The Anti-Politics Machine: \"Development,\"\nDepoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1990).\n\n67\\. See Arturo Escobar's elaboration of the concept of hybridization in\nMarglin and Gudeman, People's Economy, People's Ecology.\n\n68\\. Oakeshott, \"Rationalism in Politics,\" in Rationalism in Politics, p. 31.\n\n69\\. Oakeshott, \"The Tower of Baal,\" in Rationalism in Politics, p. 64.\n\n70\\. If innovation in such societies must be represented as compatible with\ntradition in order to gain acceptance, this is another reason for the\nplasticity of tradition.\n\n71\\. Access to codified, epistemic knowledge is also sharply restricted by\nsuch markers as wealth, gender, social position, and region in developed\ncountries as well. The difference is that, in principle, in developed\nsocieties the secrets of medicine, science, engineering, ecology, and so on\nare open secrets, available to all to use and modify.\n\n72\\. It goes without saying that new forms of metis are constantly being\ncreated. Computer hacking would fall into this category. Metis, it should be\nquite clear, is ubiquitous in modern and in less modern societies alike, and\nperhaps the crucial difference is that, compared to preindustrial societies,\nmodern societies are particularly reliant on codified, epistemic knowledge,\nusually conveyed through formal instruction.\n\n73\\. Ammarell, \"Bugis Navigation,\" p. 372.\n\n74\\. There is little doubt that many apprenticeships were longer than\nnecessary for training a young craftsmen and were a thinly disguised form of\nindentured labor designed to increase the profits of an oligopoly of master\ncraftsmen.\n\n75\\. The desire for control over the work process is not merely a short-term\nprerequisite to capturing profits; it is crucial to the capacity of managers\nto transform the work process from above for adapting to the market and\nmeeting the demands of their superiors. Ken C. Kusterer calls management\ncontrol over the production process the \"steerability\" of a firm. See\nKusterer, Know-How on the Job: The Important Working Knowledge of \"Unskilled\"\nWorkers (Boulder: Westview Press, 1978).\n\n76\\. Marglin, \"Losing Touch,\" p. 220.\n\n77\\. Ibid., p. 222. But as the capitalists were shortly to discover, one\nadvantage of the putting-out system was a diminished exposure to large-scale\nindustrial strikes and equipment breakdowns.\n\n78\\. Taylor, quoted in ibid., p. 220 n. 3.\n\n79\\. As Marglin notes, \"Only a recapitulation of workers' knowledge in the\nform of an episteme to which management alone had access would provide a firm\nbasis for managerial control\" (ibid., p. 247).\n\n80\\. David F. Noble, Forces of Production: A Social History of Automation (New\nYork: Oxford Press, 1984), p. 250, quoted in ibid., p. 248.\n\n81\\. Noble, Forces of Production, p. 277, quoted in Marglin, \"Losing Touch,\"\np. 250.\n\n82\\. Quoted in Kusterer, Know-How on the Job, p. 50.\n\n83\\. This is why, before the income tax, the administrators of the older\nsystems of taxation found it easiest to assess taxes by relying solely on the\nmore permanent fact of land or real property ownership.\n\n84\\. A branch of social theory called principal-agent analysis is devoted to\nthe various techniques by which one person can be persuaded to do another\npersons bidding. As one might imagine, its most immediate applications have\nbeen in management science.\n\n85\\. Michael J. Watts, \"Life Under Contract: Contract Farming, Agrarian\nRestructuring, and Flexible Accumulation,\" in Michael J. Watts and Peter O.\nLittle, eds., Living Under Contract: Contract Farming and Agrarian\nTransformation in Sub Saharan Africa (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press,\n1974), pp. 21-77. See also Allan Pred and Michael J. Watts, Reworking\nModernity: Capitalism and Symbolic Discontent (New Brunswick: Rutgers\nUniversity Press, 1992).\n\n86\\. The system with fryers also involved farms that specialized in hatching\nand caring for chicks and farms that grew certain elements of the feed.\nContract farming for vegetables is widespread in the Third World and has\nrecently been extended to the raising of pigs.\n\n87\\. The uniformity is achieved at the outset, of course, by means of\nscientific breeding.\n\n88\\. Quoted in Oakeshott, \"Rationalism in Politics,\" p. 20 (emphasis added).\n\n89\\. Quoted in ibid., p. 5.\n\n90\\. It is in fact impossible for most modern readers to take in the vast\ncomplacency with which Oakeshott regards what the past has bequeathed to him\nin its habits, practices, and morals without wondering if Jews, women, the\nIrish, and the working class in general might not feel as blessed by the\ndeposit of history as did this Oxford don.\n\n###### Chapter 10: Conclusion\n\n1\\. Stephen A. Marglin, \"Economics and the Social Construction of the\nEconomy,\" in Stephen Gudeman and Stephen Marglin, eds., People's Ecology,\nPeople's Economy (forthcoming).\n\n2\\. Albert O. Hirschman, \"The Search for Paradigms as a Hindrance to\nUnderstanding,\" World Politics 22 (April 1970): 239. Elsewhere Hirschman takes\nsocial science in general to task in much the same fashion: \"But after so many\nfailed prophecies, is it not in the interest of social science to embrace\ncomplexity, be it at some sacrifice of its claim to predictive power?\" (\"Rival\nInterpretations of Market Society: Civilizing, Destructive, or Feeble?\"\nJournal of Economic Literature 20 [December 1982]: 1463-84).\n\n3\\. Quoted in Roger Penrose, \"The Great Diversifier,\" a review of Freeman\nDyson, From Eros to Gaia, in the New York Review of Books, March 4, 1993, p.\n5.\n\n4\\. Like all rules of thumb, this rule is not absolute. It could be waived,\nfor example, if catastrophe seems imminent and quick decisions are essential.\n\n5\\. This is, I believe, the strongest argument against capital punishment for\nthose who are not opposed to it on other grounds.\n\n6\\. Aldo Leopold, quoted in Donald Worster, Nature's Economy, 2nd ed. (New\nYork: Cambridge University Press, 1994), p. 289.\n\n7\\. The typical social science solution to this sort of issue is to turn it\ninto a quantitative exercise by, say, asking citizens to assess the well-being\nof the community on a predetermined scale.\n\n8\\. \"Everything becomes crystal clear after you have reduced reality to oneone\nonly-of its thousand aspects. You know what to do.... There is at the same\ntime the perfect measuring rod for the degree of success or failure.... The\npoint is that the real strength of the theory of private enterprise lies in\nits ruthless simplification, which fits so admirably into the mental patterns\ncreated by the phenomenal successes of science. The strength of science too\nderives from its 'reduction' of reality to one or another of its many aspects,\nprimarily the reduction of quality to quantity\" (E. F. Schumacher, Small Is\nBeautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered [London: Blond and\nBriggs, 1973], pp. 272 -73).\n\n9\\. See John Brinckerhoff Jackson, A Sense of Place, a Sense of Time (New\nHaven: Yale University Press, 1994), p. 190.\n\n10\\.

Daly, \"Policies for Sustainable Development,\" paper presented\nat the Program in Agrarian Studies, Yale University, New Haven, February 9,\n1996, p. 4.\n\n14\\. Ibid., pp. 12-13. Daly adds, \"In the limit, all other species become\ncultivated natural capital, bred, managed at the smaller population size to\nmake more room for humans and their furniture. Instrumental values such as\nredundancy, resiliency, stability, sustainability, would be sacrificed, along\nwith the intrinsic value of life enjoyment by sentient human species, in the\ninterests of 'efficiency' defined as anything that increases the human scale\"\n(p. 13).\n\n15\\. I am grateful to my colleague Arun Agrawal for emphasizing this point.\n\n16\\. The classic elaboration of this argument, empirically grounded in many\ncase studies, may be found in Robert M. Netting, Smallholders, Householders:\nFarm Families and the Ecology of Intensive, Sustainable Agriculture (Stanford:\nStanford University Press, 1993).\n\n17\\.

This ordering of the names of the dead, which was insisted on by Maya\nLin, caused quite a controversy at the time the memorial was built.\n\n20\\. Near the site of the Vietnam Memorial is the statue of a small squad of\nsoldiers carrying a wounded comrade. This statue was the original proposal by\na good many veterans' organizations who had opposed the present wall as a\nfitting monument.\n\n21\\.

You shall see this tireless sapper, this \nnibbler, gnawing the land into little bits, carving an acre into a hundred pieces, and invited always to this feast by a \npetite bourgeoisie which finds in him, at the same time, its ally and its prey. . . . Out of the reach of the law by virtue \nof his insignificance, this Robespierre, with a single head and twenty million hands, works ceaselessly, crouching in \nevery commune . . . bearing arms in the National Guard in every district of France, since by 1830, France does not \nrecall that Napoleon preferred to run the risk of his misfortunes rather than to arm the masses. \nHonoré de Balzac Letter to P. S. B. Gavault introducing Les Paysans\nDo not imagine that Tonsard, or his old mother or his wife and children ever said in so many words, \"we steal for a \nliving and do our stealing cleverly.\" These habits had grown slowly. The family began by mixing a few green \nboughs with the dead wood; then, emboldened by habit and by a calculated impunity (part of the scheme to be \ndeveloped in this story), after twenty years the family had gotten to the point of taking the wood as if it were their \nown and making a living almost entirely by theft. The rights of pasturing their cows, the abuse of gleaning grain, of \ngleaning grapes, had gotten established little by little in this fashion. By the time the Tonsards and the other lazy \npeasants of the valley had tasted the benefits of these four rights acquired by the poor in the countryside, rights \npushed to the point of pillage, one can imagine that they were unlikely to renounce them unless compelled by a \nforce stronger than their audacity. \nBalzac, Les Paysans\n . . . the binary division between resistance and non-resistance is an unreal one. The existence of those who seem \nnot to rebel is a warren of minute, individual, autonomous tactics and strategies which counter and inflect the \nvisible facts of overall domination, and whose purposes and calculations, desires and choices resist any simple \ndivision into the political and the apolitical. The schema of a strategy of resistance as a vanguard of politicisation \nneeds to be subjected to re-examination, and account must be taken of resistances whose strategy is one of evasion \nor defencethe Schweijks as well as the Solzhenitsyns. There are no good subjects of resistance. \nColin Gordon on Michel Foucault, Power/Knowledge\n  \n< previous page\npage_vii\nnext page >\n",

A \ngreat deal of the recent work on the peasantrymy own as well as that of othersconcerns rebellions and revolutions. \nExcepting always the standard ethnographic accounts of kinship, ritual, cultivation, and languageit is fair to say that \nmuch attention has been devoted to organized, large-scale, protest movements that appear, if only momentarily, to pose \na threat to the state. I can think of a host of mutually reinforcing reasons why this shared understanding of relevance \nshould prevail. On the left, it is apparent that the inordinate attention devoted to peasant insurrections was stimulated by \nthe Vietnam war and by a now fading left-wing, academic romance with wars of national liberation. The historical \nrecord and the archivesboth resolutely centered on the state's interestsabetted this romance by not mentioning peasants \nexcept when their activities were menacing. Otherwise the peasantry appeared only as anonymous contributors to \nstatistics on conscription, crop production, taxes, and so forth. There was something for everyone in this perspective. \nFor some, it emphasized willy-nilly the role of outsidersprophets, radical intelligentsia, political partiesin mobilizing an \notherwise supine, disorganized peasantry. For others, it focused on just the kinds of movements with which social \nscientists in the West were most familiarthose with names, banners, tables of organization, and formal leadership. For \nstill others, it had the merit of examining precisely those movements that seemed to promise large-scale, structural \nchange at the level of the state.\nWhat is missing from this perspective, I believe, is the simple fact that most subordinate classes throughout most of \nhistory have rarely been afforded the luxury of open, organized, political activity. Or, better stated, such activity was \ndangerous, if not suicidal. Even when the option did exist, it is not clear that the same objectives might not also be \npursued by other stratagems. Most subordinate classes are, after all, far less interested in changing the larger structures \nof the state and the law than in what Hobsbawm has appropriately called ''working the system . . . to their minimum \ndisadvantage.\"1 Formal, organized political activity, even if clandestine and revolutionary, is typically the preserve of \nthe middle class and the intelligentsia; to look for peasant politics in this realm is to look largely in vain. It is alsonot \nincidentallythe first step toward concluding that the peasantry is a political nullity unless organized and led by outsiders.\nAnd for all their importance when they do occur, peasant rebellionslet alone\n1.

When, more rarely, they do \nsucceed, it is a melancholy fact that the consequences are seldom what the peasantry had in mind. Whatever else \nrevolutions may achieveand I have no desire to gainsay these achievementsthey also typically bring into being a vaster \nand more dominant state apparatus that is capable of battening itself on its peasant subjects even more effectively than \nits predecessors.\nFor these reasons it seemed to me more important to understand what we might call everyday forms of peasant \nresistancethe prosaic but constant struggle between the peasantry and those who seek to extract labor, food, taxes, rents, \nand interest from them. Most forms of this struggle stop well short of outright collective defiance. Here I have in mind \nthe ordinary weapons of relatively powerless groups: foot dragging, dissimulation, desertion, false compliance, \npilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson, sabotage, and so on. These Brechtianor Schweikianforms of class struggle \nhave certain features in common. They require little or no coordination or planning; they make use of implicit \nunderstandings and informal networks; they often represent a form of individual self-help; they typically avoid any \ndirect, symbolic confrontation with authority. To understand these commonplace forms of resistance is to understand \nmuch of what the peasantry has historically done to defend its interests against both conservative and progressive \norders. It is my guess that just such kinds of resistance are often the most significant and the most effective over the \nlong run. Thus, Marc Bloch, the historian of feudalism, has noted that the great millenial movements were \"flashes in \nthe pan\" compared to the \"patient, silent struggles stubbornly carried on by rural communities\" to avoid claims on their \nsurplus and to assert their rights to the means of productionfor example, arable, woodland, pastures.2 Much the same \nview is surely appropriate to the study of slavery in the New World. The rare, heroic, and foredoomed gestures of a Nat \nTurner or a John Brown are simply not the places to look for the struggle between slaves and their owners. One must \nlook rather at the constant, grinding conflict over work, food, autonomy, ritualat everyday forms of resistance. In the \nThird World it is rare for peasants to risk an outright confrontation with the authorities over taxes, cropping patterns, \ndevelopment policies, or onerous new laws; instead they are likely to nibble away at such policies by noncompliance, \nfoot dragging, deception. In place of a land invasion, they prefer piecemeal squatting; in place of open mutiny, they \nprefer desertion; in place of attacks on public or private grain stores, they prefer pilfering. When such stratagems are \nabandoned in favor of more quixotic action, it is usually a sign of great desperation.\nSuch low-profile techniques are admirably suited to the social structure of the\n2.

Their individual acts of foot dragging and evasion, reinforced by a venerable \npopular culture of resistance and multiplied many thousand-fold, may, in the end, make an utter shambles of the policies \ndreamed up by their would-be superiors in the capital. Everyday forms of resistance make no headlines. But just as \nmillions of anthozoan polyps create, willy-nilly, a coral reef, so do the multiple acts of peasant insubordination and \nevasion create political and economic barrier reefs of their own. It is largely in this fashion that the peasantry makes its \npolitical presence felt. And whenever, to pursue the simile, the ship of state runs aground on such reefs, attention is \nusually directed to the shipwreck itself and not to the vast aggregation of petty acts that made it possible. For these \nreasons alone, it seems important to understand this quiet and anonymous welter of peasant action.\nTo this end, I spent two years (197880) in a Malaysian village. The village, which I call Sedaka, not its real name, was a \nsmall (seventy-household), rice-farming community in the main paddy-growing area of Kedah, which had begun double-\ncropping in 1972. As in so many other \"green revolutions\" the rich have gotten richer and the poor have remained poor \nor grown poorer. The introduction of huge combine-harvesters in 1976 was perhaps the coup de grace, as it eliminated \ntwo-thirds of the wage-earning opportunities for smallholders and landless laborers. In the course of two years I \nmanaged to collect an enormous amount of relevant material. My attention was directed as much to the ideological \nstruggle in the villagewhich underwrites resistanceas to the practice of resistance itself. Throughout the book I try to \nraise the larger issues of resistance, class struggle, and ideological domination that give these issues their practical and \ntheoretical significance.\nThe struggle between rich and poor in Sedaka is not merely a struggle over work, property rights, grain, and cash. It is \nalso a struggle over the appropriation of symbols, a struggle over how the past and present shall be understood and \nlabeled, a struggle to identify causes and assess blame, a contentious effort to give partisan meaning to local history. \nThe details of this struggle are not pretty, as they entail backbiting, gossip, character assassination, rude nicknames, \ngestures, and silences of contempt which, for the most part, are confined to the backstage of village life. In public \nlifethat is to say, in power-laden settingsa carefully calculated conformity prevails for the most part. What is remarkable \nabout this aspect of class conflict is the extent to which it requires a shared worldview. Neither gossip nor character \nassassination, for example, makes much sense unless there are shared standards of what is deviant, unworthy, impolite. \nIn one sense, the ferociousness of the argument depends on the fact that it appeals to shared values that have been, it is \nclaimed, betrayed. What is in dispute is not values but the facts to which those values might apply: who is rich, who is \npoor, how rich, how poor, is so-and-so stingy, does so-and-so shirk work?

The perspective adopted amounts to an implicit plea for the value of a \"meaning-\ncentered\" account of class relations. In the final chapter I try to spell out the implications of the account for broader \nissues of ideological domination and hegemony.\nThe fourteen months I spent in Sedaka were filled with the mixture of elation, depression, missteps, and drudgery that \nany anthropologist will recognize. As I was not a card-carrying anthropologist, the whole experience was entirely new \nto me. I do not know what I would have done without the very practical lectures on fieldwork sent to me by F. G. \nBailey. Even with this wise advice, I was not prepared for the elementary fact that an anthropologist is at work from the \nmoment he opens his eyes in the morning until he closes them at night. In the first few months, perhaps half my trips to \nthe outhouse were for no purpose other than to find a moment of solitude. I found the need for a judicious neutralitythat \nis, biting my tongueto be well-advised and, at the same time, an enormous psychological burden. The growth of my own \n\"hidden transcript\" (see chapter 7) made me appreciate for the first time the truth of Jean Duvignaud's comment: \"For \nthe most part, the village yields itself to the investigator and often he is the one to take refuge in concealment.\"3 I also \nfound neighbors who were forgiving of my inevitable mistakes, who were tolerantto a pointof my curiosity, who \noverlooked my incompetence and allowed me to work beside them, who had the rare ability to laugh at me and with me \nat the same time, who had the dignity and courage to draw boundaries, whose sense of sociability included talking \nliterally all night if the talk was animated and it was not harvest season, and whose kindness meant that they adapted \nbetter to me than I to them. What my time among them meant for my life and my work, the word gratitude cannot begin \nto cover.\nDespite a determined effort to trim the manuscript, it remains long. The main reason for this is that a certain amount of \nstorytelling seems absolutely essential to convey the texture and conduct of class relations. Since each story has at least \ntwo sides, it becomes necessary to allow also for the \"Roshomon effect\" that social conflict creates. Another reason for \nincluding some narrative has to do with the effort, toward the end, to move from a close-to-the-ground study of class \nrelations to a fairly high altitude. These larger considerations require, I think, the flesh and blood of detailed instances to \ntake on substance. An example is not only the most successful way of embodying a generalization, but also has the \nadvantage of always being richer and more complex than the principles that are drawn from it.\n3.

As I never used a tape recorder, except for formal speeches given by outsiders, I worked from \nfragmentary notes made while talking or immediately afterward. The result is that the Malay has something of a \ntelegraphic quality, since only the more memorable fragments of many sentences were recoverable. Early in my stay, as \nwell, when the rural Kedah dialect was strange to my ears, quite a few villagers spoke to me in the simpler Malay they \nmight use at the market. A glossary of specific Kedah dialect terms that appear in the text and notes will be found in \nappendix D.\nThis book is for a special reason, I suspect, more the product of its subjects than most village studies. When I began \nresearch, my idea was to develop my analysis, write the study, and then return to the village to collect the reactions, \nopinions, and criticisms of villagers to a short oral version of my findings. These reactions would then comprise the \nfinal chaptera kind of \"villagers talk back\" section or, if you like, \"reviews\" of the book by those who should know. I \ndid in fact spend the better part of the last two months in Sedaka collecting such opinions from most villagers. Amidst a \nvariety of commentsoften reflecting the speaker's classwere a host of insightful criticisms, corrections, and suggestions \nof issues I had missed. All of this changed the analysis but presented a problem. Should I subject the reader to the \nearlier and stupider version of my analysis and only at the end spring the insights the villagers had brought forward? \nThis was my first thought, but as I wrote I found it impossible to write as if I did not know what I now knew, so I \ngradually smuggled all those insights into my own analysis. The result is to understate the extent to which the villagers \nof Sedaka were responsible for the analysis as well as raw material of the study and to make what was a complex \nconversation seem more like a soliloquy.\nFinally, I should emphasize that this is, quite self-consciously, a study of local class relations. This means that peasant-\nstate relations, which might easily justify a volume on resistance, are conspicuously absent except as they impinge on \nlocal class relations. It means that issues of ethnic conflict or religious movements or protest, which would almost \ncertainly become important in any political crisis, are also largely bracketed. It means that economic origins of the petty \nclass relations examined here, which might easily be traced all the way to the board rooms of New York City and \nTokyo, are not analyzed. It means that formal party politics at the provincial or national level is neglected. From one \npoint of view all these omissions are regrettable. From another perspective the effort here is to show how important, \nrich, and complex local class relations can be and what we can potentially learn from an analysis that is not centered on \nthe state, on formal organizations, on open protest, on national issues.\n \nThe unseemly length of the acknowledgments that follow is indicative of how much I had to learn and of the patience \nand generosity of those who taught me.\n  \n< previous page\npage_xix\nnext page >\n",

The Centre for Policy Research at USM has conducted much of the finest research on the Muda Scheme \nin Kedah and, for that matter, on agrarian policy anywhere. Lim Teck Ghee and David Gibbons of the Centre not only \nhelped me plan the research but became valued friends and critics whose efforts are evident throughout the bookeven \nwhen I decided to go my own way. Thanks are also due Sukur Kasim, Harun Din, Ikmal Said, George Elliston, and, of \ncourse, the Director of the Centre, K. J. Ratnam. Officials of the Muda Agricultural Development Authority's \nheadquarters in Teluk Chengai near Alor Setar were unfailingly generous with their time, their statistics, and above all \ntheir great experience.

Datuk Tamin Yeop, then General Manager of \nMADA, was also very helpful.\nMembers of the \"invisible college\" working and writing on rural Malaysian society whose paths crossed my own \ncontributed enormously to my understanding.

Two staff members from Universiti Sains who came to Yale for graduate work, Mansor \nHaji Othman and S. Ahmad Hussein, were important sources of advice and criticism. Finally, I should single out the \ngenerosity of Kenzo Horii of the Institute of Developing Economies in Tokyo, who conducted a study of land tenure in \nSedaka in 1968 and made the results available to me so that I could establish what a decade of change had meant.\nThe final manuscript was much changed thanks to the detailed criticism of\n  \n< previous page\npage_xx\nnext page >\n",

A symposium on \"History and Peasant Consciousness in \nSoutheast Asia\" sponsored by the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, Japan, and arranged by Shigeharu Tanabe \nand Andrew Turton helped sharpen my perspective.

It \nis to say, on the contrary, that every contradiction is a conflict of value as well as a conflict of interest; that inside \nevery ''need\" there is an affect, or \"want,\" on its way to becoming an \"ought\" (and vice versa); that every class \nstruggle is at the same time a struggle over values. \nE. P. Thompson, The Poverty of Theory\nRazak\nThe narrow path that serves as the thoroughfare of this small rice-farming village was busier than usual that morning. \nGroups of women were on their way to transplant the irrigated crop and men were bicycling their children to the early \nsession of school in the nearby town of Kepala Batas. My children were all gathered, as usual, at the windows to watch \nas each passerby gazed our way from the moment the house came into view until it passed from view. This scene had \nbecome, in the space of a few weeks, a daily ritual. The villagers of Sedaka were satisfying their curiosity about the \nstrange family in their midst. My children, on the other hand, were satisfying a more malevolent curiosity. They had \ncome to resent mildly their status of goldfish in a bowl and were convinced that sooner or later someone would forget \nhimself while craning his neck and walk or bicycle straight into the ditch alongside the path. The comic possibility had \ncaught their imagination and, when it inevitably happened, they wanted to be there.\nBut something was amiss. A small, quiet knot of people had formed in front of the house next door and some passersby \nhad paused to talk with them. Hamzah and his older brother, Razak, were there, as was Razak's wife, Azizah, and the \nvillage midwife, Tok Sah Bidan.1 The tone was too subdued and grave to be casual and Azizah, along with other \nwomen from poor families, would normally have already left for work with her transplanting group.

Two days ago the child had come down with a fever. It was the end of the dry season \nin Kedah when fevers are expected, but this seemed to be more than the ordinary fever, perhaps measles, someone \nsuggested. Yesterday she had been taken to Lebai Sabrani, a highly venerated religious teacher and traditional healer in \nthe adjoining village of Sungai Tongkang. He recited verses of the Koran over her and suggested a poultice for her \nforehead. I am implicated in this too, Razak told me later. Had I not been visiting another village, he would have asked \nme to drive the child to a clinic or to the hospital in the state capital, Alor Setar. As it was, he did ask Shamsul, the only \nother automobile owner in the village, and was told that it would cost M$15 for gas. Razak did not have any money or, I \nsuspect, enough confidence in hospitals to press the matter, and his daughter died shortly before dawn the next day.\nInstinctively, I started for Razak's place, behind Hamzah's house, where the body would customarily be on view. Razak \nstopped me and said, \"No, not there. We put her in Hamzah's house; it's nicer here.\" His embarrassment was evident \nfrom the way he avoided meeting my eyes.\nRazak is the \"down-and-out\"3 of the village, and his house was not only an embarrassment to him; it was a collective \nhumiliation for much of Sedaka. When I had arrived in the village, Razak and his family were living under the house, \nnot in it. Two walls of attap4 and bamboo had fallen away and much of the roof had collapsed. \"They live like chickens \nin a henhouse, a lean-to, not like Malays,\" villagers said with derision. Not long after that, the local leader of the ruling \nparty, Basir, mindful of the fact that Razak had joined his party and embarrassed that any Malays in his village should \nlive on the ground like the beasts of the field, got the subdistrict chief to provide a modest sum from his discretionary \nfunds for lumber to repair the house. A small voluntary work party, all members of the ruling party, then repaired three \nwalls, leaving the last wall and the roof for Razak to finish. After all, Razak and Azizah made attap roofing for a living. \nThe roof remains as it was, however, and the boards to repair the last wall are gone. Razak sold them twiceonce to \nRokiah and once to Kamil,\n2.Habuan dia, nasib tak baik.

She swears she \nwill never buy anything from him again unless she takes delivery first.\nAs we mounted the ladder to Hamzah's house, I realized that this was the first time I had actually entered his family's \none-room living and sleeping quarters. I never did enter Razak's house or the houses of six of the other poorest families \nin the village. They chose instead always to receive me outside, where we squatted or sat on simple benches. We \nremained outside because they were embarrassed about the condition of their houses and because actually entering the \nhouse would imply a level of hospitality (coffee, biscuits) that would strain their meager resources. When possible, I \nmade an effort to meet on neutral groundsin the rice fields, on the pathor perhaps in one of the two small shops in the \nvillage or at the twice-weekly nearby market, where I could legitimately play host. For the rich people of the village the \nproblem never arose; they never went to the homes of the poor. Visiting, except between equals, was always done up \nthe status ladder in the village, and particularly so during the ritual visits following the end of the Moslem fasting \nmonth.5 In fact, the pattern of visits served to define the village status hierarchy. This pattern was broken significantly \nonly in the case of grave illness or death in a poor household, when the normal rules of hospitality were suspended out \nof respect for a more universal human drama.\nThus it was that the death of Maznah (Razak's daughter) had opened Hamzah's house to me and to many others. She \nwas lying on a tiny mattress surrounded by mosquito netting strung from the rafters. Her body was wrapped in a new \nwhite cloth, and her face was barely visible beneath a lace shawl of the kind women wear for prayer. Beside the netting \nwas incense and a tin plate. Each new visitor would, after lifting the netting to look at the child, place money on the \nplate: as little as 50¢, or as much as M$2. The contributions to funeral expenses, known as \"lightening\" or \"instant \ndonations,\"6 were especially necessary in this case since neither Razak nor many of the other very poor villagers \nsubscribed to a death benefit society that ''insures\" for funeral expenses. The money on the plate at the end of the day \nwould provide for at least the minimal decencies.\nThere were perhaps twenty-five villagers, mostly women, sitting on the floor of the bare room talking quietly in small \ngroups. A few men remained to talk among themselves, but most left quickly to join the other men outside. Razak, \nsitting by the door, was ignored, but his isolation was not a collective act of respect for his private grief. At feasts, at \nother funerals, at the village shops, and even at market stalls, the other men always sat somewhat apart from Razak. He \ndid not intrude himself.

On the rare occasions when he was addressed, the tone \nwas unmistakable. A group of men sitting in one of the village stores having ice drinks and smoking would hail his \narrival with \"Here comes Tun Razak\" followed by knowing smiles all around. \"Tun Razak\" was the aristocratic title of \nMalaysia's second prime minister, and its application to this ragtag, frail, obsequious village pariah was intended to put \nhim in his place. Whoever was treating that day would pay for his drink, and Razak would help himself to the tobacco \nand cut nipah leaves used to make peasant cigarettes. He was extended the minimal courtesies but otherwise ignored, \njust as today the village was burying his daughter but he himself might as well have been invisible.\nDirectly across the path, outside the combination village hall, religious school (madrasah),7 and prayer house, a few \nyoung men had begun measuring the spare boards they had rounded up for a coffin. Yaakub thought the boards were far \ntoo long and Daud, the son of the village headman, was sent back to Hamzah's house with string to measure. Meanwhile \nBasir arrived with hot tea and the special canvas used for the bottom of the casket. The talk turned, as it often did in the \ncoffee shops, to an exchange of stories about Razak's many capers, most of which were established staples of village \ngossip. Amin shared the most recent installment having to do with the subsidies given by the government for house \nimprovement and permanent outdoor toilets.8 Razak, along with other members of the ruling partyand only themwas \nthe recipient of a porcelain toilet bowl. Despite explicit warnings against selling such material, Razak had exchanged his \nfor Amin's plastic bowl and cash and in turn sold the plastic toilet to Nor for M$15. Yaakub, to the general merriment, \nasked why Razak should build a toilet anyway, when he did not even have a house.9\nYaakub then wondered whether anyone else had seen Razak dig into the curry at the wedding feast for Rokiah's \ndaughter two days before, a feast to which he had not been invited. Shahnon added that only yesterday, when Razak \nturned up at the coffee stall in the town market, he invited him to have some coffee, it being understood that Shahnon \nwould pay. The next thing he noticed, Razak had left after having not only drunk coffee but taken three cakes and two \ncigarettes. Others recalled, partly for my benefit, how Razak took payment for\n7.

Accosted a week later, he claimed his friend with the seed had not been at \nhome. Accosted again the following week, he claimed his friend had already sold the seed. The money was never \nreturned. On various occasions, they claimed, Razak had begged seed paddy for planting or rice for his family. In each \ncase, the gift had been sold for cash, not planted or eaten. Ghazali accused him of helping himself to nipah fronds from \nbehind his house for roofing without ever asking permission and of having begged for a religious gift of paddy (zakat) \neven before the harvest was in. \"I lost my temper,\" he added as many shook their heads.\nWhen the well-to-do villagers lament, as they increasingly do, the growing laziness and independence of those they hire \nfor work in the fields, the example of Razak is always close at hand. They have other illustrations, but Razak is by far \nthe most serviceable. Any number of times, they claim, he has taken advance wages in cash or rice and then failed to \nshow up for work. As for his poverty, they are skeptical. He has, after all, half a relong (.35 acre), which he rents out \nlike a landlord rather than farming himself.10 The general verdict is that he is simply not capable of getting ahead.11 \nWhen the subdistrict chief (penghulu), Abdul Majid, confides to me that the poor are reluctant to work anymore and \nnow insist on unrealistic wages, he seizes the example of Razak. \"He has made himself hard up, it's his own doing.\"12\nBy now the simple coffin was nearly finished and Amin, the best carpenter in the village, began to add some small \ndecorative touches at the ends. \"No need to add decorations,\" put in Ariffin, and Amin left off. As they carried the \ncoffin across to Hamzah's house, where Maznah lay, someone sized up the work and said, \"shabby.\"13\nReturning to my house I encountered a small group of Pak Haji Kadir's wife's friends talking about the child's death. \nThey all seemed to agree that Razak and Azizah were largely to blame. After all, they took their sick daughter to \nRokiah's feast the day before yesterday, fed her food she should not have had, and kept her up to all hours. \"They don't \neat at all well,\" said Tok Kasim's\n10. Razak claims, with some justice, that he is too weak and ill to cultivate and that, in any case, he does not \nhave the money for tractor charges, fertilizer, or seed.\n11.Tak pandai pusing. The implication of this phrase is that Razak does not take pains, does not hustle.\n12.Dia buat susah. Abdul Majid went on to describe many local Chinese families who had begun with nothing and \nwere now rich. One might possibly translate this phrase as: \"He is pretending to be hard up,\" since the verb for \n\"shamming\" (membuatbuat) is occasionally abbreviated.\n13.Lekeh. This word in Kedah carries the meaning of \"vulgar, common, shabby, not refined,\" and is much like the \nuse of kasar in standard Malay. It is variously applied to people, feasts, commodities, music, cloth, personal \nbehavior, and so forth.\n  \n< previous page\npage_5\nnext page >\n",

Otherwise, only water. And Razak's family, someone added, drank water from the same ditch used for \nbathing. Rarely any porridge, never any milk, and almost never any sugar unless Azizah brought some back from her \nrelatives in Dulang. By contrast, the village headman, Haji Jaafar, usually took his morning meal in the town coffee \nshop, where he had porridge or fried flat bread with sugar or curry, assorted cakes and sweets made with sticky rice, and \ncoffee with sweetened condensed milk. The midday meal, the main one in the village, for Razak's family would \ntypically include rice, vegetables that could be gathered free in the village,15 and, if finances permitted, some dried fish \nor the cheapest fish from the market. No one had ever seen Razak buy vegetables. Fresh fish, when they had it, was \nnormally cooked over an open fire, for it was rare that they could afford the 30¢ minimum purchase of the cheapest \ncooking oil. Haji Jaafar's midday meal, on the other hand, reflected both his wealth and his rather sumptuous tastes: a \ntasty curry made from the most expensive fish and market vegetables and, at least twice a week, a luxury that Razak \nnever boughtmeat.\nRazak's household, like its food, was distinguished less by what it had than by what it lacked. The couple had no \nmosquito netting, which helped explain why their children's arms and legs were often covered with the scabs of old \nbites. Maybe once a year they bought a bar of the cheapest soap. They had to share three tin plates and two cups when \nthey ate. They lacked even the traditional mats to sleep on, using instead an old cast-off plastic sheet Razak found at the \nmarket. As for clothes, Azizah had not bought a sarong since her wedding, making do instead with worn-out cloth given \nher by Basir's wife. Razak's one pair of pants and shirt were bought three years ago when there was a sale of \nsecondhand clothing that had not been redeemed at the pawnbrokers. As Cik Puteh pointed out, the responsibility for \nthis deplorable situation rested squarely with Razak. \"He has land but he doesn't want to plant it.\" \"He's always looking \nfor short cuts.\"16 \"He takes the money first but doesn't want to come thresh paddy.\" \"Now, those who are hardup are \ngetting cleverer; there's more cheating these days.\"\n14.Makanan tak jenuh, kena tumpang kenduri orang.\n15. The generic term for such vegetables, which can be eaten raw with rice, is ulam. Some of the locally available \nulam include kangkong, daun cemamak, daun pegaga, bebuas, daun putat, and the banana spadix. Both Razak and \nhis wife would also occasionally catch rice-paddy fish with line and hook. Since the beginning of double-cropping \nand the increased used of pesticides, however, such fish have become less plentiful and may in fact have serious \nlong-run health consequences for the poor who continue to eat them.\n16.Selalu cari jalan pendek.\n  \n< previous page\npage_6\nnext page >\n",

Normally, in the case of an adult, the coffin would have been carried the two miles to the mosque \nwith a cortege of men following on foot, on bicycle, and on motorcycle. Since Maznah was so small and light, Hamzah, \nher uncle, carried her wrapped in a new batik cloth slung over his shoulder like a bandolier as he rode pillion behind \nBasir on his Honda 70. The plain coffin was carried athwart Amin's motorcycle by Ghani Lebai Mat. Counting Razak \nand myself, there were only eleven men, and it was the first entirely motorcycle-born cortege I had ever seen. The \nvillagers and later the Chinese shopkeepers in Kepala Batas paused briefly to watch us pass.\nIn the graveyard next to the mosque, Tok Siak (caretaker of the mosque) and his assistant were still digging the grave. \nMaznah, covered with a cotton winding sheet, was taken gently from the batik cloth and placed in the coffin on her side \nso that she would be facing Mecca. A large clod of clay from the grave was lodged against her back to prevent her \nposition from shifting. Tok Siak was now bailing water from the grave with an old biscuit tin; the burial plot was on \nreclaimed paddy land and the seasonal rains had begun. The prayers, led by Lebai Sabrani, took less than ten minutes \nand it was over. Most of the men then entered the mosque to pray for Maznah's soul. When they emerged, Basir handed \nthem envelopes containing a dollar, as is the custom.17 The six men who had prayed returned the envelopes. Villagers \nbelieve that these prayers help lighten the burden of sin and speed the soul on its way to heaven; the more who pray, the \nmore rapid the soul's progress. On the way back to the village, I asked Amin why there were so few people at the burial. \nHe replied that, since Maznah was so young, her sins were few, and thus it was not so important that many people pray \non her behalf. But it was a sensitive question, for we both remembered the burial of Tok Sah's infant granddaughter a \nmonth earlier when two or three times that number had come to the graveyard.\nThat night, again at Hamzah's house, there was a small funeral feast.18 Not more than fifteen men came, and Haji Kadir \nled the brief Islamic prayers and chants.

Razak, as usual, was \nignored, invisible. Later, as Yaakub and I walked back home along the village path, he asked if I had noticed how the \ntobacco had run short because Razak had pocketed some for later use. \"Shabby,\" was his summary.\nEarly in the morning, three or four days later, Razak appeared at the foot of my steps waiting to be asked up. Whenever \nhe came to see me it was always early enough so that no one else was about; if someone else did happen by, he would \nfall silent and take the first opportunity to leave. Despite the fact that the gossip about him had long aroused my \ncuriosity, I had already found myself avoiding much talk with him in public, having sensed that it could only set village \ntongues wagging. Was he taking advantage of me? What tales and slanders would he put in my ear? Did I actually \napprove of this good-for-nothing?\nRazak had come to thank me for my large contribution to the funeral expenses. I had made a discreet donation directly \ninto Razak's hands the day his daughter died, knowing that if I had put M$20 directly on the plate near the body, I \nwould have received no end of scolding.19\nBefore long we passed on to the topic I had been raising recently in conversations with villagers: the enormous changes \nthat have come to Sedaka since the beginning of double-cropping eight years ago. It was clear to Razak that things were \ngenerally worse now than before irrigation. \"Before it was easy to get work, now there's no work in the village and the \nestates (rubber and oil palm) don't want anyone.\" \"The poor are poorer and the rich are richer.\"20 The trouble, he added, \nis mostly because of the combine-harvesters that now cut and thresh paddy in a single operation. Before, his wife could \nearn over M$200 a season cutting paddy and he could earn M$150 threshing, but this last season they only managed M\n$150 between them.21 \"People weren't happy when the ma-\n19. I should add that much of this was conscience money in the sense that I felt guilty for having been out of \nthe village the day before, when I might have driven the child to the hospital. Another reason for discretion \nwas that such a large sum, given openly, would, I felt, have demeaned the smaller contributions on the plate, \nwhich represented a more than comparable sacrifice for others, and would have publicly placed Razak in my \npermanent debt.\n20.Orang susah, lagi susah; orang kaya, lagi kaya. The fact that he should use the term susah, which might be \ntranslated as \"hard up,\" for his class rather than the term miskin (poor) and the term kaya (rich) for those who are \nwell-to-do rather than the term senang (comfortable), which would make a logical pair with susah, is significant. \nFor further discussion, see chapter 5.\n21. Figures on the loss of wages due to combine-harvesters may be found in chapters 3 and 4.

Money that might have gone to paddy reapers and threshers from the \nvillage and in turn been used partly for local feasts within Sedeka was now paid directly to the owners of these \nexpensive machines. As Razak put it, \"They carry it away for their own feasts.\"23\nNot only was wage work harder and harder to come by, but it was almost impossible now to find land to rent. In the old \ndays, he said, landlords wanted you to take land and hardly bothered about the rent. Today, they farm all the land \nthemselves or else rent out large plots under long-term leases to wealthy Chinese contractors with machinery. \"They \nwon't give (land) to their own people.\" \"They won't even give five cents to someone who is hard up.\"24\nRazak has begun to warm up to one of his favorite laments, one he shares with many of the other village poor: the \ngrowing arrogance and stinginess of the rich. It is reflected in what he sees as their attitude toward charity. Little \nwonder that Razakwith a tiny patch of rice land, four (now three) young children, and a frail physique (and many would \nsay a reluctance to work)should be concerned about charity. The official poverty-level income for a family of Razak's \nsize would be M$2,400.25 Their actual income, not counting charity, last year was less than M$800, by far the lowest in \nthe village. It would be misleading to say they get by, for Maznah's death may be evidence that they do not. Without the \nsmall amount of charity they receive, without Azizah's frequent flights with the children back to her parents' village of \nDulang when the food gives out, and perhaps without Razak's capers, which offend the village, it would be hard to \nimagine the rest of them surviving at all.\nIf others blamed Razak's situation on his own moral failings, he hurled the charge back at them. \"There are lots of \nMalays who are not honest.\"26 \"Now, Malays who get wages of even three or four hundred dollars have become arro-\n22.La 'ni, katok pun tak boleh buat.

In the village, they don't even give you a single cup of coffee.\" The charge is not \nstrictly true. As nearly as I could calculate over a year, Razak's family received enough gifts of paddy and rice (milled \npaddy) to feed them for perhaps three months. At the end of Ramadan it is the duty of each Moslem to make a religious \ngift of rice, called fitrah. In addition to the customary gifts to the mosque, the imam, and the village prayer house, rice is \noften given, one gallon at a time, to poor relatives and neighbors, particularly those who have worked during the season \nfor the farmer making the gift. Razak was given nearly ten gallons of rice as fitrah, although not without a residue of \nbitterness. Rather than waiting politely to be summoned to collect his fitrah as is customary, Razak went from house to \nhouse asking for it. Only a few refused;28 after all, a family ought to be able to eat rice on the major Islamic feast day, \nand such gifts are seen as a way of cleansing one's own possessions. Razak collected smaller gifts, in the same fashion, \non the second major Islamic feast day a month later.29 The third occasion for religious gifts is at harvest time, when all \nMuslims are enjoined to tithe 10 percent of their harvest (the zakat). Despite the fact that official responsibility for zakat \ncollection has recently been taken over by the provincial authorities, informal zakat payments along traditional lines \npersist. It is given in paddy, not rice, and is an important supplement to the income of poor, landless families. Razak \nreceived a gunny sack of paddy from his eldest brother in Yan, for whom he had threshed, and four or five gallons from \nwithin the village, by using his usual aggressive methods. From time to time, Razak also asks for small gifts of rice \nfrom likely prospects. Usually, he puts it in terms of advance wages, using language that masks the nature of the \ntransaction, but the fiction is paper thin. Those who are importuned say he is \"begging for alms.\"30\nBeing pushy has its rewards. Razak receives a good deal more food than many\n27.Sombong. Along with the charge of being stingy, this is probably the most serious personal charge that is \ncommonly heard in village society. People who are sombong have, in effect, removed themselves from the \ncommunity by acting superior to their fellows. The opposite of sombong is merendahkan diri, \"to act \nmodestly\" or \"to lower oneself.\"\n28. One wonders how much Razak would have gotten had he behaved less aggressively. I suspect much less, but I \nhave no way of knowing.\n29.Hari Raya Haji, when pilgrims leave for Mecca. Donations of rice on this occasion are normally given by the \nquarter gallon (cupak).\n30.Minta sedekah. The social definition of what Razak is doing is important. As Simmel understands: \"no one is \nsocially poor until he has been assisted. . . . And this has general validity: sociologically speaking, poverty does \nnot come first and then assistance . . . but a person is called poor who receives assistance.\" Georg Simmel on \nIndividuality and Social Forms, ed. Donald N. Levine (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1971), 175. In the same \nsense no one is a beggar in Sedaka until he is perceived to have asked for alms.\n  \n< previous page\npage_10\nnext page >\n",

The additional \ncost to his reputation is minimal; his standing is already virtually the definition of rock bottom.31 On the other hand, he \ndoes not do nearly so well as his younger brother, Hamzah, who is often held up as an example of the deserving poor. \nHamzah is an acknowledged hard worker, as is his wife; he serves as caretaker of the madrasah and he unfailingly \nappears to help with the cooking at feasts, to assist in house moving,32 and to help repair the village path. After last \nseason's harvest, and partly out of sympathy for a month-long illness that prevented him from working as usual, he \nreceived eight gunny sacks of paddy from villagers and relatives. Basir calls him the \"zakat champ,\"33 contrasting the \nresults with the meager return from Razak's more aggressive style. \"We don't want to give alms to Razak, he's a liaronly \nto honest poor like Hamzah.\"34 Fadzil, another influential villager, echoed these sentiments. \"There are lots of poor \nwho lie, cheat, and are lazy.'' \"They look for a shady tree to perch on.\" \"They want to gobble up the well-to-do.\"35 In a \nreflective moment, however, he noticed the potential for a vicious cycle here. \"If we don't give them alms because they \nsteal, then maybe they have to keep stealing.\" This was as close as anyone I spoke with ever came to recognizing \nexplicitly the importance of charity for the social control of the village poor.\nOn the political front, Razak has done what a prudent poor man might do to safeguard his and his family's interests. \nFour of five years ago he paid the M$1 subscription to join the village branch of the ruling party, which dominates \npolitics and the division of whatever loaves and fishes filter down to the village level. \"If you go with the crowd, there's \na lot to be had. With the minority, it would be difficult. I used my head. I want to be on the side of the majority.\"36\n31. Erving Goffman has captured the strange power that those without shame can exercise. \"Too little \nperceptiveness, too little savoir-faire, too little pride and considerateness, and the person ceases to be someone \nwho can be trusted to take a hint about himself or give a hint that will save others embarrassment. . . .

When a drought, \na year earlier, forced the cancellation of the irrigated paddy season, the government created a work-relief program. \nPolitics weighed heavily in the selection of workers and Razak was a winner. The local Farmer's Association office \nhired him to take care of their poultry for forty days at M$4.50 a day, and he was paid M$50 to help clear weeds from a \nsection of the irrigation canal. None of the poor villagers who were on the wrong side of the political fence did nearly as \nwell. The wood with which his house was partly repaired came through the political influence of Basir. More free wood \nand the toilet bowl that Razak sold were part of a subsidy scheme that, in Sedaka at least, was available only to \nfollowers of the ruling party. If the figure of speech were not so inappropriate to the Malay diet, one might say that \nRazak knew which side his bread was buttered on.\nAs a beneficiary of local patronage and charity, however reluctantly given, one might expect Razak to entertain a \nfavorable opinion of his \"social betters\" in the village. He did not. He also sensed what they said behind his back. \"I \ndon't go to the houses of rich people; they don't ask me in. They think poor people are shabby (vulgar) people. They \nthink we are going to ask for money as alms. They say we're lazy, that we don't want to work; they slander us.\"37 What \noffended Razak as much as anything was that these same rich people were not above calling on the poor when they \nneeded help. But when it came to reciprocity, there was none. ''They call us to catch their (runaway) water buffalo or to \nhelp move their houses, but they don't call us for their feasts.\"\nIt has not escaped his notice either that he and many others like him are invisible men. \"The rich are arrogant. We greet \nthem and they don't greet us back. They don't talk with us; they don't even look at us! If the rich could hear us talking \nlike this, they'd be angry.\"38 Razak is special in some respects, but he is not unique. Compare what he has to say with \nthis couplet from the agricultural laborers of Andalusia:\n37. The word Razak used for \"shabby,\" \"vulgar,\" is lekeh, the same word used to describe Maznah's coffin \nand Razak's behavior. The word used here for slander is mengumpat.\n38.Orang kaya sombong. Kita tabik, depa tak tabik balik. Tak chakap, tak tengok pun. Kalau orang senang dengar \nkita sembang, depa marah (I find it impossible to determine whether Razak's use of kita here means \"I\" or whether \nhe wishes to include other poor people like himself in the statement). Just how deeply humiliating it is to be \nbeneath notice, to be invisible, not to have one's greeting returned is at the core of Hegel's notion of the dialectic of \nself-consciousness. It is in an act as banal as a greeting that it becomes clear that one's own self-esteem is \ndependent on being accorded recognition by another, even if this greeting, as in Hegel's famous example of the \nduel, must come at the cost of life. See, for example, Hans Georg Gadamer, Hegel's Dialectic: Five Hermeneutical \nStudies, trans. Christopher Smith (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1972), chap. 3.\n  \n< previous page\npage_12\nnext page >\n",

The emblem on the door said \"Ministry of Health.\" Presently, two nurses emerged from behind Hamzah's house \nwhere Razak lived. They had instructions, they said, to make an inquiry whenever a young child's death was reported \nand to try to help the family with nutritional advice. They had left some powdered milk, but they seemed profoundly \ndiscouraged by what they had seen and learned. \"What can you do with people like that?\" they asked no one in \nparticular as they climbed into the land-rover for the trip back to the capital.\nHaji \"Broom\"\nBefore considering the significance of Razak for class relations in Sedaka, it is instructive to introduce his symbolic, \nmirror-image twin, his fellow outcast from the opposite end of the social pyramid, Haji Broom. My stories about him \nare all secondhand, for he died some five or six years before I arrived in the village, but they are plentiful.\nNot long after I moved to Sedaka, Lebai Hussein invited me to attend a wedding feast for his son Taha, who was \nmarrying a woman from a village near the town of Yan Kechil, six miles to the south. To accommodate the large \nnumber of guests, the bride's family had built a covered pavilion outside their house where the male guests sat. Talk \ncentered on the prospects for the current main-season crop and on how the cancellation of the previous irrigated-season \ncrop due to the drought had postponed many marriages until the main-season crop could be harvested.\nNoticing what seemed to be a huge new warehouse on the horizon, I idly asked my neighbor what it was. He told me \nthat it was a rice mill being built by Haji Rasid and his brother Haji Ani. At the mention of these two names most of the \nother conversations in the pavilion stopped. I had somehow, it was clear, stumbled on a subject of lively interest. For the \nnext hour or so the men regaled one another with stories about the two brothers and especially about their father, Haji \nAyub. In fact, as I quickly learned, the name of Haji Ayub was a sure-fire conversational gambit in any company, \nsufficient to set off a small avalanche of tales.\n39.

At the time of his death, he was reputed to have owned more than 600 \nrelong (426 acres) of paddy fields in addition to his other holdings of rubber and orchard land. The magnitude of his feat \nmust be viewed against an agrarian setting in which the median holding is less than three relong and a farmer who owns \ntwenty relong is considered to be quite rich. Alarmed at the astonishing speed with which Kedah's rice land was passing \ninto the hands of Haji Ayub, the State Assembly at one point actually forbade him to acquire more.\nThe stories that swirl around the career and exploits of Kedah's rice-land baron, however, touch less on his fabulous \nholdings per se than on his style of life and the manner in which he built his empire. What makes Haji Ayub such a \nconversational staple is his legendary cheapness. To judge from the popular accounts I was introduced to that afternoon, \nKedah's richest landowner maintained, by choice, a style of life that was hardly distinguishable from Razak's. Like \nRazak, he lived in a broken-down house that had never been repaired or rebuilt.40 Rather than buy manufactured \ncigarettes, he continued till the end of his life to roll his own peasant cigarettes, using the cheapest tobacco and nipah \nwrappers he cut from his own plants.41 Like the poorest of the poor, Haji Ayub bought only a single sarong cloth a year \nand, if you passed him, you would have thought he was the village beggar. Surpassing even Razak, he was said to have \neaten nothing but dried fish, except on feast days. Although he could have afforded a luxurious car, and a surfaced road \npassed near his house, he traveled by foot or on bicycle. Haji Kadir, at this point, brought down the house with a \npantomime of Haji Ayub on his ancient Raleigh, weaving back and forth, accompanied by an approximation of the loud \nsqueaking noises only the rustiest bicycles could possibly have made. It was in this fashion that Kedah's rice baron \nissued forth to collect rents from scores of tenants who had not already come of their own accord. The spirit of self-\ndenial touched all aspects of his life save one: he had allowed himself three wives.42\nThe humor of Haji Ayub's tight-fisted ways depended of course on their contrast with his fabulous wealth. He had \nclearly become a legend because he represented the apotheosis of the rich miser, the unapproachable standard by\n40. The condition of his house is often the first remark about Haji Ayub. In contrast, one of the very first \ninvestments that even modest peasants made with the first proceeds of double-cropping in 1971 was to repair \nor make additions to their houses.\n41. It is a poor peasant indeed in Sedaka who does not buy (for 10¢) a bundle of nipah cigarette wrappers in the \nmarket.\n42. The miser is the symbol of pure accumulation in the sense that he acquires money and property as an end in \nitself, not as a means to the pleasures they may provide. In this respect, Haji Ayub's three wives, one short of the \nmaximum allowed by the Koran, may have represented simply another aspect of accumulation. On this subject, \nsee Simmel's essay \"Miser and Spendthrift,\" in Georg Simmel, 17986.\n  \n< previous page\npage_14\nnext page >\n",

But while Razak's \nfame was purely local, Haji Ayub was the pacesetter for the district if not the state of Kedah.\nWhen it came to describing how Haji Ayub acquired all this land, the conversation was just as animated but not nearly \nso jovial. The whole process is perhaps best captured in the nickname by which he is widely known: Haji \"Broom.\" \nPeasants prefer the English word in this case because, I suspect, its sound suggests a single, vigorous sweeping motion. \nQuite literally, Haji Broom swept up all the land in his path. The force of the word also connotes something akin to \nwhat is meant by saying that one has \"cleaned up\" at poker (that is, swept up all the chips on the table) or \"cleaned out\" \none's opponents.43 The image is more powerful precisely because it is joined with \"Haji,\" a term of respect for those \nwho have made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Thus the nickname ''Haji Broom\" accomplished for Haji Ayub more or less \nwhat the nickname \"Tun Razak\" accomplished for Razak.\nHaji Broom's name came up not long afterward when I was asking a few villagers gathered under Pak Yah's house \nabout moneylending and credit practices before double-cropping. Nor was explaining to me the notorious padi kunca \nsystem of credit and began his account with, \"This is the way Haji Broom would do it.\" It involved an advance of cash \nroughly six months before harvest, repayable by a fixed quantity (a kunca) of paddy at harvest time, which typically \namounted to an effective annual rate of interest approaching 150 percent. For at least half a century, until 1960, it was \nthe standard form of seasonal credit extended by shopkeepers, rice millers, moneylenders, and not a few wealthy \nlandlords. Virtually all observers of rice farming cited it both as a major reason for persistent poverty in the paddy \nsector and as the cause of defaults that further concentrated land ownership.44 It was clear, moreover, that in this area \nHaji Broom and padi kunca were nearly synonymous.\n43. The Malay verb \"to sweep\" (sapu, menyapu) carries the same metaphorical force. Thus when someone \nwished to describe how a rich man had rented up all the available land in the area, he would say, Dia sapu \nsemua (He swept it all up).\n44. See, for example, Unfederated Malay States, Annual Report of the Advisor to the Kedah Government, \nDecember 11, 1912, to November 30, 1913, W. George Maxwell (Alor Setar: Government Printer, 1914), 23; \nAnnual Report of the Advisor to the Kedah Government, 1914, L. E. D. Wolferston (Alor Setar: Government \nPrinter, 1915), 14; and Government of Malaysia, Report of the Rice Production Committee, 1953 (Kuala Lumpur: \n1954), vol. 1, p. 82. The Rice Production Committee describes the system as follows: \"a man borrows, say M$50 \nfor the purpose of obtaining credit over the planting season and promises to pay a kunca (160 gallons) of padi at \nharvest worth $102 at current government guaranteed minimum price, but $140 at the market average.\" It is worth \nnoting here there is no necessary symmetry between the gain of the moneylender and the distress of the borrower. \nHigh interest rates in rural Southeast Asia have often reflected the actual cost of money and the high risk of debtor \ndefault. Thus, while these interest terms may have been punishing to smallholders, they do not imply a fabulous \nreturn to the lender.\n  \n< previous page\npage_15\nnext page >\n",

Mat \"halus\" said that Haji Broom regularly lent money, usually in \nM$100 amounts, for six months, requiring repayment of M$130 or M$140. \"His sons, Haji Rasid and Haji Ani, do the \nsame thing. It's sinful.45 They've been doing it for seven generations. They only care about this world.\" Part of this \nlending, they said, was secondhand. That is, Haji Broom would take money from large Chinese moneylenders at 40 \npercent interest and relend it to peasants at 80 percent interest, pocketing the difference. In the eyes of these villagers, \nthe fact that he worked hand-in-glove with the Chinese creditors in town made for an even worse transgression than if \nhe had operated alone. The Chinese practice of lending cash at interest, on the other hand, occasions virtually no \ncommentary; it is expected. After all, it is their normal business practice and nothing in their religion forbids it. For a \nMalaya member of their own community, their own religion, and in this case a Hajito practice usury despite its explicit \ndenunciation in the Koran is to call forth the most profound censure.46\nBut the keystone of Haji Broom's fortune, the means by which most land fell into his hands, was the practice of jual \njanji (literally, promised sale).47 Nor, Pak Yah, and Mat \"halus\" can each tick off easily the names of families in the \narea who lost land to Haji Broom in this fashion. The practice worked as follows: Haji Broom would lend a man a \nsubstantial sum in return for which the title to all or a part of the borrower's land would be transferred to Haji Broom. \nThe written contract of sale provided that if, by a specified date, the borrower repaid the initial sum (nearly always less \nthan the market value of the land), he could recover his land.48 For the borrower, the loss of the land was, in principle at \nleast, not irrevocable. In practice, of course, it often was, and most of the large landholdings in Kedah were acquired in \nthis fashion. Haji Broom and a few\n45.Haram here means \"forbidden by Islamic law,\" but the force of the word as it is actually used conveys the \ndeep sinfulness of taking interest; makan bunga (literally to \"eat\" interest).\n46. One of the many relevant passages in the Koran reads as follows: \"They who swallow down usury, shall arise \nin the resurrection only as he ariseth whom Satan hath infected by his touch. This, for that they say, Selling is only \nthe like of usury, and yet God hath allowed selling, and forbidden usury. He then who when this warning shall \ncome to him from his Lord, abstaineth, shall have pardon for the past, and his lot shall be with God. But they who \nreturn {to usury}, shall be given over to the fire; therein shall they abide forever.\" Surah II: 275. The Koran, trans. \nJ. M. Rodwell (London: Everyman's Library, 1977), 369.\n47. Analogous practices could be found throughout colonial Southeast Asia, for example in the Philippines, \nVietnam, and Burma.\n48. There are variants in the actual timing of the formal transfer of property and in the use rights to the land while \nit is thus \"mortgaged,\" but the basic arrangements remain the same.\n  \n< previous page\npage_16\nnext page >\n",

A few days before the final date, he would go into hiding so \nthat a peasant who was lucky enough to have amassed the cash to redeem his land could not find him. Once the date had \npassed, he would then immediately ask the court to award him the land of the defaulting borrower.49 By such \nstratagems, Haji Broom turned nearly all his jual janji loans into land sales. As if to dramatize the finality of a loan from \nHaji Broom, Pak Yah noted that a visitor to the land baron's house would have found him seated in front of a large \ncupboard filled from top to bottom with land titles.\nSomething of a lighthearted competition had developed among the three men to tell the most outrageous stories about \nHaji Broom. Nor provided the finale by describing how the man treated his own sons. He would come to visit his son \nHaji Ani, Nor said, bearing a sack of one hundred sapodilla fruits (an inexpensive brownish fruit from the same tropical \nevergreen that produces chicle), ostensibly as a gift. Before leaving, he would ask Haji Ani to give him one hundred \nduck eggs in return. \"Which is more expensive?\" Nor asked me rhetorically. This is not just another story of Haji \nBroom's sharp dealing. Here he had violated the spirit of a gift to make a profit, he had actually asked for a return, and \nhe had, above all, exploited his own family for his private gain. Mat \"halus\" summarized it all by describing his \nbehavior as ''the politics of getting ahead.\"50\nWhen I remarked that I had never heard of a man so \"stingy,\" Pak Yah corrected me, \"Not stingy but greedy,\"51 thereby \nemphasizing that Haji Broom was not so much husbanding what he already had as plundering others. \"He is without \nshame.\" In a sense, this last is the ultimate accusation, one that I have heard applied to Razak as well. For it is shame, \nthat concern for the good opinion of one's neighbors and friends, which circumscribes behavior within the moral \nboundaries created by shared values. A man without shame is, by definition, capable of anything.52\n49. While in theory a borrower could have deposited the required amount in an escrow account and informed \nthe court, thereby saving his land, it was a rare peasant indeed who knew about, let alone exercised, this \noption.\n50.Politik hidup. The term is not easy to translate; it also implies that Haji Broom is concerned solely with getting \nahead in this world at the expense of his immortal soul.\n51.Bukan lokek, haloba.\n52.

If he \nhad a feast, villagers would bring gifts of rice, even if he had a hundred gunny sacks in his granary already. But if he is \nnot good-hearted, we don't want to help him at all.\"53 Neither the fortune of Haji Broom nor the poverty of Razak \nwould have become so notorious were it not for the shamelessness of their behavior, a shamelessness that breaks all the \nrules and makes of them virtual outcasts: the one becoming the symbol for the greedy rich, the other the symbol of the \ngrasping poor.\nOnly in Haji Broom's case, however, does the condemnation take on a somewhat mythical, religious dimension.

And when he was borne to the cemetery, they said, smoke (some say fire) was already rising from \nthe freshly dug grave. When I once asked Ghazali, with deliberate naïveté, whether this had really happened, he replied, \n\"Maybe, but it could be a fairy tale too.\"54 The point of course does not depend on the actual truth value of such \nreports, but rather on the social fact that villagers should conjure up the fires of hell waiting to consume Haji Broom \neven before he was finally laid to rest.\nMost of that class of wealthy landowners of which Haji Broom is simply the most blatant and therefore serviceable \nexample are also Hajis. That is, they are also men who have fulfilled the fifth \"pillar\" of Islam by making the pilgrimage \nto Mecca. Some have in fact made more than a single pilgrimage. The pattern of association between religious status \nand landowning wealth evidently has its origins in the late nineteenth century when much of the Kedah rice plain was \nsettled by migrants led by respected religious teachers. Land grants, voluntary gifts, and the Islamic tithe allowed much \nof this class to become something of a landed gentry, while strategic marriage alliances with officials and the lower \naristocracy solidified their position.55 By 1916, the Acting British Advisor was\n53. Compare this with the comment made by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie in the course of his portrait of a \nthirteenth-century Albigensian village in southern France: \"Wealth in itself was not the real object of attack. \nWhat the people of Montaillou hated was the unhealthy fat of the undeserving rich, clerics, and mendicants \nwho exploited the village without giving in return any spiritual aid or even those services of help and \nprotection habitually provided by a well-to-do domus or by wealthy local nobles.\" Montaillou: Promised \nLand of Error, trans.

On the \none hand, there is a genuine veneration for the act of pilgrimage itself and for the religious charisma that pilgrims \nthereby acquire. On the other hand, not a few of these pilgrims have accumulated the necessary capital for the Haji only \nby decades of sharp practices (for example, moneylending, taking jual janji land mortgages, renting land at the highest \npossible rates, being tightfisted with relatives and neighbors, minimizing ceremonial obligations), which most of the \ncommunity judges abhorrent. Small wonder that villagers should be less than completely worshipful of a returning Haji \nwhose trip to Mecca was financed by their land, their labor, and their rents.\nPerhaps this is why the term Haji is often joined in popular parlance to adjectives that are anything but complimentary. \nHaji Sangkut58 refers literally to a man who wears the cap and robe of a Haji without having made the pilgrimage, but \nit is also used to describe, behind their backs, actual pilgrims whose subsequent behavior continues to violate what the \ncommunity would expect of a religious man. Haji Merduk and Haji Karut59 refer to \"false\" or \"fake\" Hajis who have \nmade the voyage to Mecca but whose conduct is anything but saintly. Since one of the main purposes of the Haj in \nvillage terms is to cleanse oneself of sin and prepare for Allah's judgment, it is an especially grave transgressiona sign \nof bad faithto persist in sinful ways. As Basir says, \"God will not accept Hajis like that. They have just wasted their \nmoney. There's no benefit. It's useless.\" The sins of such a Haji are worse than those of ordinary Muslims, Fazil adds, \nbecause \"He knows it's wrong but he does it anyway. A false Haji is the very worst.60 He goes to Mecca to wash his \nsins clean but . . . God doesn't like signs like that.\"\n56.

From the verb sangkut meaning \"to hang something up on a peg,\" hence \"to drape clothes on oneself.\" It is also \npossible that sangkut is a corruption of songkok, the Malay cap, thereby implying an imposter who wears the small \nskullcap of a Haji without having made the pilgrimage.\n59.Merduk means \"a thing or possession of no value\" and karut means \"false or untrue.\"\n60.Haji karut yang teruk sekali.\n  \n< previous page\npage_19\nnext page >\n",

The \nterms most in vogue are Haji Kedekut and Haji Bakhil, each of which means stingy or miserly Haji.

I was visiting a nearby village with Sedaka's ragtag soccer team,64 \nand after the game some of our hosts asked where I was staying. When I replied that we stayed in the front of \"Pak\" \nHaji Kadir's house, I was greeted by blank stares of nonrecognition. I tried to describe the location of the house,\n61.Hukuman melayu lagi teruk. Here the literal translation is \"Malay punishment,\" but the reference is to \nreligion, since the two are synonymous.

The confusion continued until someone said, \"Oh, that must \nbe Kadir Ceti\" and the smiles around then reflected both recognition and some embarrassment. Ceti refers to the \nnotorious southern Indian Chettiar moneylending caste which, in Malaya and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, provided \nmuch of the finance capital for agrarian production from 1900 until the Second World War. As a caste specialized \nentirely to a profession forbidden by the Koran, they became, and remain, a symbol of usurious exploitation and debt \nbondage.\nAlthough Haji Kadir was the only man with the nickname Pak Ceti in Sedaka, other villages in the vicinity had their \nownHaji Lah Ceti and Pak Ali Ceti to name just two.65 Once it became known that I had learned my landlord's \nnickname, the ice was broken and the stories came thick and fast. Much of the nearly twenty relong of paddy fields that \nhe owned locally were acquired by default on money he had lent out, that is by jual janji. Abu Hassan's father had lost \nthree relong to Pak Haji Kadir in this fashion, which explained why he occasionally, and to no avail, asked to rent back \nthis plot of land. Villagers said that, like Haji Broom, Haji Kadir had re-lent money borrowed from one of the wealthy \nChinese shopkeepers in Kepala Batas. Hamzah, his poor neighbor, complained that he would charge 20¢ for a coconut \nfrom his yard rather than simply make a gift of it as others would. Hamzah had another complaint. Last season he had \nworked as a laborer more often for Haji Kadir than for anyone else in the village and thus expected a gift of paddy \n(zakat) after the harvest. He got absolutely nothing, although far poorer farmers for whom he had worked had been quite \ngenerous.\nThe diet of Kadir Ceti, like that of the Haji Kedekut in the ditty, was the object of popular derision. Rather than buying \nfish from the market, he would, by choice, eat the same tiny, bony fish from the paddy fields that the poorest villagers \nate of necessity. Even his brother-in-law, Pak Kasim, did not think he had changed since making the pilgrimage. \"Even \nthe Chinese in town call him Ceti. He always sits in the same chair. How could he change?\"\nAlthough Haji Broom and Kadir Ceti dominated the conversational landscape of miserly Hajis in Sedaka, there was no \nshortage of stories about other Hajis, living and dead, in the district. The torrent of abusive accounts was such that I \neventually tired of them, although the villagers never did. There were Hajis who stole water buffalo; Hajis who boldly \ntook things from stores without paying; Hajis who harvested crops planted in good faith by their tenants; Hajis who \nrented all their land to Chinese rather than to their own people; Hajis who\n65.

And, of course, there were many good, pious, modest Hajis (perhaps a \nmajority) whose pilgrimage and conduct were a great credit to Islam. The fact remains, however, that a vast majority of \nthe rich landlords who had earned the animosity of the community were also Hajis. It was impossible to tell whether the \ncascade of stories was due simply to the inherent richness of the source material or to its social value as a cautionary \ntale for the rich and would-be rich who had not yet gone astray. Both, I suspect.\nTwo things were clear, though. First, nearly everyone thought that the problem of the shameless, greedy rich in general, \nand of shameless, greedy, rich Hajis in particular, was worse now than in the past. Even rich Hajis concurred, while \nexcepting themselves from the charge. Sukur spoke for most when he said: \"The old Hajis were real Hajis. These days, \nthey aren't real Hajis. They only wear the robes. They just took a trip to Mecca (not a real pilgrimage). When they came \nback from Mecca they should be true, but they even practice padi kunca. They just want more money; the sky's the \nlimit.\"66 Second, it is clear that, when such Hajis die, their transgressions will earn them the most exquisite punishment \ntheir God can prepare. What that punishment will be precisely is a matter for conjecture. But Abdul Rahman captured \nthe flavor of this speculation by concluding: \"When they enter hell, they will swim in blood.\"\nThe Symbolic Balance of Power\nThe tales about Razak and Haji Broomsuitably embroidered, elaborated, and retoldhave far more than mere \nentertainment value. They amount to an exchange of small arms fire, a small skirmish, in a cold war of symbols \nbetween the rich and poor of Sedaka. Hostilities, in this war as in most, are conducted over a shifting terrain in which \nthere are many neutrals, bystanders, and reluctant combatants with divided loyalties. For the time being, at least, it \nremains a cold war both because many of the potential participants have important shared interests that would be \njeopardized in an all-out confrontation and because one side, the poor, is under no illusions about the outcome of a \ndirect assault. Thus, the \"war news\" consists almost entirely of words, feints, and counterfeints, threats, a skirmish or \ntwo, and, above all, propaganda.\nThe stories that circulate about Razak and Haji Broom are perhaps understood in this sense as propaganda. Like \neffective propaganda, they signifythey embodyan entire argument about what is happening in this small place. The mere \nmention of Razak's name by rich villagers conjures up a vision of the\n66.

In their view Razak is the negative \nmodel toward which the poor in general are, alas, heading. The mere mention of Haji Broom's name by poor villagers \nconjures up a vision of the greedy, penny-pinching rich, who likewise violate the accepted standards of village conduct. \nIn their view, Haji Broom is the negative model toward which the rich in general are heading.\nHaji Broom and Razak gain much of their power as symbols by virtue of their reality as concrete human examples of \nthe behavior they have come to signify. Everyone in the village can observe Razak as he adds daily to his own legend. \nFor Haji Broom, the experience is only slightly less direct. Nearly everyone has seen or met him and every adult has \nheard firsthand stories about his land grabbing and moneylending. Given the availability of palpable, local legends that \nvillagers can check against their own experience, this kind of propaganda does not have to rely much on mere credulity \nto state its case. What one chooses to make of these living legendsprecisely what they signifyis of course another matter. \nBut they originate in social facts.\nThe value of Razak and Haji Broom as social banners, however, stems as much from the extravagance of their conduct \nas from their palpability. It is this extravagance that not only makes the tales engrossing67 but makes them effective \nvehicles of propaganda. Even the poor of Sedaka agree that Razak's capers place him beyond the pale. Even Kadir Ceti \nwill agree that Haji Broom's fortune was gotten by breaking the commands of Allah and of village society. The rich and \nthe poor have each availed themselves of precisely the extreme examples that will best serve their case, examples that \nwill have to be conceded by the \"other side.\"\nThe stories that swirl around these two men must also be recognized as cornerstones of an ideological edifice under \nconstruction. They embody, as ideology, a critique of things as they are as well as a vision of things as they should be. \nThey are attempts to create and maintain a certain view of what decent, acceptable human behavior ought to be. As \nnegative examples of totally unacceptable behavior, they accomplish their purpose in the same way that any socially \nsanctioned account of deviance helps to define what is normal, correct, preferred behavior. Such stories can thus be read \nas a kind of social text on the subject of human decency. They are necessary precisely because the maintenance of a \ngiven symbolic order is always as problematic as its change. The ideological work of repair and renovation is never-\nending.\nThe implicit purpose of these competing ideologies is not just to convince but to control; better stated, they aim to \ncontrol by convincing. To the extent that they succeeded in shaping behavior, they achieve a class purpose as well.\n67.

The benefits for the poor of such an arrangement are obvious. Should the poor, on the other \nhand, take the infamous example of Razak to heart, they would not importune the rich for gifts, they would not come to \nfeasts uninvited, they would be faithful workers, and they would be as good as their word. The advantages for the rich \nof such an arrangement are equally obvious. There is a kind of symbolic equilibrium here. The message to the rich is: If \nyou behave like Haji Broom, you can count on being villified as he is. To the poor, the message is: If you behave like \nRazak, you will be despised as he is. And if wishes became deeds, if ideology became practice, Sedaka would be a \nsmall utopia peopled by generous, sympathetic landlords and honest, hardworking tenants and laborers.\nAlas, the equilibrium is only symbolic. These cautionary tales, after all, adjure the rich and the poor to forgo their \nimmediate material interest in order to protect their reputation. But how important is a good name? Or, to put it the other \nway around, what is the cost of a bad name? The answer unfortunately depends a great deal on who you are, for the cost \nof a bad name hinges directly on the social and economic sanctions that can be brought into play to punish its bearer. In \nclass terms, one must ask how dependent the poor are on the good opinion of the rich and vice versa. The politics of \nreputation is, in this respect, something of a one-sided affair.68 It amounts to this: The rich have the social power \ngenerally to impose their vision of seemly behavior on the poor, while the poor are rarely in a position to impose their \nvision on the rich. A good name is something like a social insurance policy for the poor against the thousand \ncontingencies of agrarian life. It is built by a record of deferential behavior, service at feasts and house movings, a \nwillingness to work without quibbling too much about wages, and tacit support for the village leadership. It brings \ntangible rewards in terms of employment, charity, help at times of death or illness, and access to whatever subsidies the \nruling party in the village has to distribute. It brings intangible rewards in terms of inclusion both in the informal \npleasantries and in the ritual of village life. Razak, having forfeited his good name, thereby acquires a certain freedom \nto breach the etiquette of village life.69 But he pays heavily for that freedom in work and public scorn. His only \nconcession to form is his calculated membership in the ruling party. Hamzah, by contrast, has established and \nmaintained a good name. It costs him the time\n68. For an analysis of \"the politics of reputation\" and empirical studies, see F. G. Bailey, Gifts and Poison: \nThe Politics of Reputation (New York: Schocken, 1971).\n69. \"Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose\" is quite apt in this instance. See also A.

It also costs him a certain amount of swallowed up bile, as we shall see, to feign a respect for his \nsocial betters that he does not always feel. But his reputation pays dividends in employment, zakat gifts, help when he is \nill, and a public show of respect and consideration. Such rewards are significant; they are sufficient to ensure that all but \nthree or four of the poor in Sedaka choose to conform in most respects to the standard of seemly behavior that is defined \nand imposed by the village elite.\nThe Haji Brooms and Kadir Cetis of this small world are heavily insulated from the effects of a bad name. They need \nlittle or nothing from the poor. It is ironic that their insulationland and the income and power it provideswas acquired \nonly by violating precisely those rules of generosity and consideration70 that might have given them a good name. Now \nthey are virtually beyond sanction.\nThere is one exception, however. The rich, while they may be relatively immune to material sanctions, cannot escape \nsymbolic sanctions: slander, gossip, character assassination. But even on this small terrain, the contest is an unequal \none. Nowhere is this more evident than in the fact that Razak is demeaned to his face, while Haji Broom and Kadir Ceti \nare invariably demeaned behind their backs. Thus Kadir Ceti is always addressed \"Pak Haji\" to his face, and I would be \nsurprised if he was even aware of his popular nickname. The scorn in which he is held need never reach his ears nor \ntrouble his sleep.\nOf course, much of the public deference shown to Haji Kadir is \"false\" deference.71 Poor villagers, and not only they, \nchoose to dissemble, knowing full well the penalties of any other course. Thus when an old villager, Ishak, ventures to \ntalk disparagingly about Haji Broom, he ends by asking me not to breathe a word of it to anyone in Yan or Mengkuang \nfor fear of retaliation. What we have here is a difference between \"onstage\" and \"offstage\" behavior; to the extent that \nthe deference expressed in public, power-laden situations is negated in the comparative safety of offstage privacy, we \ncan speak unambiguously of false deference.\nBut even false deference is an unmistakable exhibition of the social power of the well-to-do. It is no small matter that \nthe village elite continues to control the public stage. The public symbolic order is maintained through outward \ndeference, to which there is no open challenge. On this largely symbolic plane, as well as in the sphere of material \nexchange, then, the social imbalance of power\n70. The equivalent for \"consideration\" in Malay is timbang rasa, which means literally \"to weigh feelings\" (of \nothers).\n71.

They may write the basic script for the \nplay but, within its confines, truculent or disaffected actors find sufficient room for maneuver to suggest subtly their \ndisdain for the proceedings. The necessary lines may be spoken, the gesture made, but it is clear that many of the actors \nare just going through the motions and do not have their hearts in the performance. A banal example, familiar to any \nmotorist or pedestrian, will illustrate the kind of behavior involved. The traffic light changes when a pedestrian is \nhalfway across the intersection. As long as the pedestrian is not in imminent danger from the oncoming traffic, a small \ndramatization is likely to ensue. He lifts his knees a bit higher for a step or two, simulating haste, thereby implicitly \nrecognizing the motorist's right-of-way. In fact, in nearly all cases, if my impression is correct, the actual progress of \nthe pedestrian across the intersection is no faster than it would have been if he had simply proceeded at his original \npace. What is conveyed is the impression of compliance without its substance. But the symbolic order, the right of the \nmotorist to the road, is not directly challenged; indeed, it is confirmed by the appearance of haste.72 It is almost as if \nsymbolic compliance is maximized precisely in order to minimize compliance at the level of actual behavior.\nIt is with analogous forms of minimal compliance that poor villagers are able to insinuate the insincerity of their \nperformance. They may come to the feast of a rich villager but stay only long enough to eat quickly and leave. They \nhave compiled with the custom of accepting the invitation, but their compliance skirts the edge of impropriety. They \nmay also bring a gift in cash or kind that is less than what might be expected but not so little as to constitute a direct \ninsult. They may, as \"required,\" greet a big landowner on the village path, but their greeting is abbreviated and not as \nwarm as it might be. All these and other forms of reluctant compliance stop short of overt defiance and at least conform \nto the minimal standards of politeness and deference that the rich are normally in a position to require. And yet they also \nsignal an intrusion, however slight, of \"offstage\" attitudes into the performance itself, an intrusion sufficient to convey \nits meaning to the directors but not so egregious as to risk a confrontation.73\n72. The opposite case, in which the pedestrian openly reufses to make even an appearance of haste (or \nactually slows down) also occurs. Here there is a direct defiance of the motorist's right to the road, an open \nbreach of the symbolic order. The community of pedestrians in effect announces its prior right to the road. \nSuch an open dare invites a game of \"chicken\" in which the motorist, alas, is usually best equipped to prevail.\n73. A good deal of attention, as one might expect, has been devoted to such forms of \"protest within compliance\" \nunder slavery. For two fine examples, see Eugene Genovese, Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made (New \nYork: Pantheon, 1974), and Lawrence W. Levine, Black Culture and Black Consciousness (New York: Oxford \nUniv. Press, 1977).\n  \n< previous page\npage_26\nnext page >\n",

At one level it is a contest over the \ndefinition of justice, a struggle to control the concepts and symbols by which current experience is evaluated. At another \nlevel it is a struggle over the appropriateness of a given definition of justice to a particular case, a particular set of facts, \na particular behavior. Assuming the rich ought to be generous, for example, is a certain landowner's refusal to make a \ngift a violation of that principle or is it a legitimate rebuff to a man who is only feigning poverty or who has, by his \ncomportment, forfeited his right to charity? Finally, at a third level, of course, it is a struggle over land, work, income, \nand power in the midst of the massive changes brought about by an agricultural revolution.\nThe resources the different contestants bring to this contest hardly bear comparison. The local elite nearly always has its \nown way in the economic life of the village. Given its sway over resources, it can also largely control public ritual \nlifethat is, the ''onstage\" conduct of most of the poor in the community. Only \"backstage,\" where gossip, tales, slander, \nand anonymous sabotage mocks and negates the public ritual order, does elite control fall away. To return to the \nmilitary metaphor, it is only here that the terrain is relatively favorable to the meager arsenal of the disadvantaged.\nOne might well ask: Why are we here, in a village of no particular significance, examining the struggle of a handful of \nhistory's losers? For there is little doubt on this last score. The poor of Sedaka are almost certainly, to use Barrington \nMoore's phrase, members of \"a class over whom the wave of progress is about to roll.\"74 And the big battalions of the \nstate, of capitalist relations in agriculture, and of demography itself are arrayed against them. There is little reason to \nbelieve that they can materially improve their prospects in the village and every reason to believe they will, in the short \nrun at least, lose out, as have millions of peasants before them.\nThe justification for such an enterprise must lie precisely in its banalityin the fact that these circumstances are the \nnormal context in which class conflict has historically occurred. By examining these circumstances closely, it may be \npossible to say something meaningful about normal class consciousness, about everyday resistance, about commonplace \nclass relations where, as is most often the case, neither outright collective defiance nor rebellion is likely or possible.\n74.

Not only are the circumstances that favor large-scale peasant uprisings comparatively rare, but when \nthey do appear the revolts that develop are nearly always crushed unceremoniously. To be sure, even a failed revolt may \nachieve something: a few concessions from the state or landlords, a brief respite from new and painful relations of \nproduction2 and, not least, a memory of resistance and courage that may lie in wait for the future. Such gains, however, \nare uncertain, while the carnage, the repression, and the demoralization of defeat are all too certain and real. It is worth \nrecalling as well that even at those extraordinary historical moments when a peasant-backed revolution actually \nsucceeds in taking power, the results are, at the very best, a mixed blessing for the peasantry. Whatever else the \nrevolution may achieve, it almost always creates a more coercive and hegemonic state apparatusone that is often able to \nbatten itself on the rural population like no other before it. All too frequently the peasantry finds itself in the ironic \nposition of having helped to power a ruling group whose plans for industrialization, taxation, and collectivization are \nvery much at odds with the goals for which peasants had imagined they were fighting.3\nFor all these reasons it occurred to me that the emphasis on peasant rebellion was misplaced. Instead, it seemed far more \nimportant to understand what we might call everyday forms of peasant resistancethe prosaic but constant struggle \nbetween the peasantry and those who seek to extract labor, food, taxes, rents, and interest from them. Most of the forms \nthis struggle takes stop well short of collective outright defiance. Here I have in mind the ordinary weapons of relatively \npowerless groups: foot dragging, dissimulation, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson, sabotage, \nand so forth. These Brechtian forms of class struggle have certain features in common. They require little or no \ncoordination or planning; they often represent a form of individual self-help; and they typically avoid any direct \nsymbolic confrontation with authority or with elite norms. To understand these commonplace forms of resistance is to \nunderstand what much of the peasantry does \"between revolts\" to defend its interests as best it can.\nIt would be a grave mistake, as it is with peasant rebellions, to overly romanticize the \"weapons of the weak.\" They are \nunlikely to do more than mar-\n2. For an example of such temporary gains, see the fine study by E. J. Hobsbawm and George Rude, Captain \nSwing (New York: Pantheon, 1968), 28199.\n3. Some of these issues are examined in James C.

Furthermore, the peasantry has no monopoly on \nthese weapons, as anyone can easily attest who has observed officials and landlords resisting and disrupting state \npolicies that are to their disadvantage.\nOn the other hand, such Brechtian modes of resistance are not trivial. Desertion and evasion of conscription and of \ncorvée labor have undoubtedly limited the imperial aspirations of many a monarch in Southeast Asia4 or, for that \nmatter, in Europe. The process and its potential impact are nowhere better captured than in R. C. Cobb's account of draft \nresistance and desertion in postrevolutionary France and under the early Empire:\nFrom the year V to the year VII, there are increasingly frequent reports, from a variety of Departments . . . of \nevery conscript from a given canton having returned home and living there unmolested. Better still, many of \nthem did not return home; they had never left it in the first place. . . . In the year VII too the severed fingers of \nright handsthe commonest form of self-mutilationbegin to witness statistically to the strength of what might \nbe described as a vast movement of collective complicity, involving the family, the parish, the local \nauthorities, whole cantons.\nEven the Empire, with a vastly more numerous and reliable rural police, did not succeed in more than \ntemporarily slowing down the speed of the hemorrhage which . . . from 1812, once more reached catastrophic \nproportions. There could have been no more eloquent referendum on the universal unpopularity of an \noppressive regime; and there is no more encouraging spectacle for a historian than a people that has decided it \nwill no longer fight and that, without fuss, returns home . . . the common people, at least, in this respect, had \ntheir fair share in bringing down France's most appalling regime.5\nThe collapse of the Confederate army and economy in the course of the Civil War in the United States is a further \nexample of the decisive role of silent and undeclared defections. Nearly 250,000 eligible whites are estimated to have \ndeserted or to have avoided conscription altogether.6 The reasons appear to have\n4.

Poor whites, especially those from the nonslaveholding hill country, \nwere deeply resentful of fighting for an institution whose principal beneficiaries were often excluded from service by \nlaw.7 Military reverses and what was called the \"subsistence crisis of 1862\" prompted many to desert and return to their \nhard-pressed families. On the plantations themselves, the shortage of white overseers and the slaves' natural affinity \nwith the North's objective, gave rise to shirking and flight on a massive scale. As in France, one could claim here too \nthat the Confederacy was undone by a social avalanche of petty acts of insubordination carried out by an unlikely \ncoalition of slaves and yeomena coalition with no name, no organization, no leadership, and certainly no Leninist \nconspiracy behind it.\nIn a similar fashion, flight and evasion of taxes have classically curbed the ambition and reach of Third World \nstateswhether precolonial, colonial, or independent. As we shall learn, for example, the official collection of the Islamic \ntithe in paddy is, in Sedaka, only a small fraction of what is legally due, thanks to a network of complicity and \nmisrepresentation that eviscerates its impact. Small wonder that a large share of the tax receipts of Third World states is \ncollected in the form of levies on imports and exports; the pattern is in no small measure a tribute to the tax resistance \ncapacities of their subjects. Even a casual reading of the literature on rural \"development\" yields a rich harvest of \nunpopular government schemes and programs nibbled to extinction by the passive resistance of the peasantry. The \nauthor of a rare account detailing how peasantsin this case in East Africahave managed over several decades to undo or \nevade threatening state policy concludes in the following tone:\nIn this situation, it is understandable if the development equation is often reduced to a zero-sum game. As this \nstudy has shown, the winners of those games are by no means always the rulers. The African peasant is hardly \na hero in the light of current development thinking, but by using his deceptive skills he has often defeated the \nauthorities.8\nOn some occasions this resistance has become active, even violent. More often, however, it takes the form of passive \nnoncompliance, subtle sabotage, evasion, and deception. The persistent efforts of the colonial government in Malaya to \ndiscourage the peasantry from growing and selling rubber that would compete\n7. This issue centered on the much resented \"Twenty-Nigger Law,\" as it was known, which provided that a \nwhite man of draft age could be excused from military service if he was needed to supervise twenty or more \nslaves. This law, coupled with the hiring of substitutes by wealthy families, encouraged the widespread belief \nthat this was \"a rich man's war, but a poor man's fight.\" Ibid., chap. 5.\n8.

The \nefforts of peasants in self-styled socialist states to prevent and then to mitigate or even undo unpopular forms of \ncollective agriculture represent a striking example of the defensive techniques available to a beleaguered peasantry. \nAgain the struggle is marked less by massive and defiant confrontations than by a quiet evasion that is equally massive \nand often far more effective.10\nThe style of resistance in question is perhaps best described by contrasting, paired forms of resistance, each aimed more \nor less at the same objective. The first of each pair is \"everyday\" resistance, in our meaning of the term; the second \nrepresents the open defiance that dominates the study of peasant and working-class politics. In one sphere, for example, \nlies the quiet, piecemeal process by which peasant squatters have often encroached on plantation and state forest lands; \nin the other a public invasion of land that openly challenges property relations. In terms of actual occupation and use, \nthe encroachments by squatting may accomplish more than an openly defiant land invasion, though the de jure \ndistribution of property rights is never publicly challenged. Turning to another example, in one sphere lies a rash of \nmilitary desertions that incapacitates an army and, in the other, an open mutiny aiming at eliminating or replacing \nofficers. Desertions may, as we have noted, achieve something where mutiny may fail, precisely because it aims at self-\nhelp and withdrawal rather than institutional confrontation. And yet, the massive withdrawal of compliance is in a sense \nmore radical in its implications for the army as an institution than the replacement of officers. As a final example, in one \nsphere lies the pilfering of public or private grain stores; in the other an open attack on markets or granaries aiming at an \nopen redistribution of the food supply.\nWhat everyday forms of resistance share with the more dramatic public confrontations is of course that they are \nintended to mitigate or deny claims made by superordinate classes or to advance claims vis-à-vis those superordinate \nclasses. Such claims have ordinarily to do with the material nexus of class struggle\n9. The best, most complete account of this may be found in Lim Teck Ghee, Peasants and Their Agricultural \nEconomy in Colonial Malaya, 18741941 (Kuala Lumpur: Oxford Univ. Press, 1977). See also the persuasive \nargument in Donald M. Nonini, Paul Diener, and Eugene E. Robkin, \"Ecology and Evolution: Population, \nPrimitive Accumulation, and the Malay Peasantry\" (Typescript, 1979).\n10. For a careful and fascinating account of the ways in which China's production teams and brigades could, until \nthe changes in 1978, have some influence on the definition of \"surplus\" grain that had to be sold to the state, see \nJean C. Oi, State and Peasant in Contemporary China: The Politics of Grain Procurement (Ph.D. diss., Univ. of \nMichigan, 1983). Nearly all of this resistance was called \"soft opposition\" by those who practiced it and who made \nit clear that it was successful only if an \"outward manifestation'' of compliance was maintained.

Where everyday resistance most strikingly departs from other \nforms of resistance is in its implicit disavowal of public and symbolic goals. Where institutionalized politics is formal, \novert, concerned with systematic, de jure change, everyday resistance is informal, often covert, and concerned largely \nwith immediate, de facto gains.11\nIt is reasonably clear that the success of de facto resistance is often directly proportional to the symbolic conformity \nwith which it is masked. Open insubordination in almost any context will provoke a more rapid and ferocious response \nthan an insubordination that may be as pervasive but never ventures to contest the formal definitions of hierarchy and \npower. For most subordinate classes, which, as a matter of sheer history, have had little prospect of improving their \nstatus, this form of resistance has been the only option. What may be accomplished within this symbolic straitjacket is \nnonetheless something of a testament to human persistence and inventiveness, as this account of lower-caste resistance \nin India illustrates:\nLifelong indentured servants most characteristically expressed discontent about their relationship with their \nmaster by performing their work carelessly and inefficiently. They could intentionally or unconsciously feign \nillness, ignorance, or incompetence, driving their masters to distraction. Even though the master could \nretaliate by refusing to give his servant the extra fringe benefits, he was still obliged to maintain him at a \nsubsistence level if he did not want to lose his investment completely. This method of passive resistance, \nprovided it was not expressed as open definace, was nearly unbeatable, it reinforced the Haviks' stereotype \nconcerning the character of low caste persons, but gave them little recourse to action.12\nSuch forms of stubborn resistance are especially well documented in the vast literature on American slavery, where \nopen defiance was normally foolhardy. The\n11. There is an interesting parallel here with some of the feminist literature on peasant society. In many, but \nnot all, peasant societies, men are likely to dominate every formal, overt exercise of power. Women, it is \noccasionally argued, can exercise considerable power to the extent that they do not openly challenge the \nformal myth of male dominance. \"Real\" gains are possible, in other words, so long as the larger symbolic \norder is not questioned. In much the same fashion one might contend that the peasantry often finds it both \ntactically convenient as well as necessary to leave the formal order intact while directing its attention to \npolitical ends that may never be accorded formal recognition. For a feminist argument along those lines, see \nSusan Carol Rogers, \"Female Forms of Power and the Myth of Male Dominance,\" American Ethnologist 2, \nno. 4 (November 1975): 72756.\n12. Edward B.

These practices, which rarely if ever called \ninto question the system of slavery as such, nevertheless achieved far more in their unannounced, limited, and truculent \nway than the few heroic and brief armed uprisings about which so much has been written. The slaves themselves appear \nto have realized that in most circumstances their resistance could succeed only to the extent that it hid behind the mask \nof public compliance. One imagines parents giving their children advice not unlike advice contemporary wage laborers \non plantations in Indonesia apparently hear from their own parents:\nI tell them [the youngsters] remember, you're selling your labor and the one who buys it wants to see that he \ngets something for it, so work when he's around, then you can relax when he goes away, but make sure you \nalways look like you're working when the inspectors are there.13\nTwo specific observations emerge from this perspective. First, the nature of resistance is greatly influenced by the \nexisting forms of labor control and by beliefs about the probability and severity of retaliation. Where the consequences \nof an open strike are likely to be catastrophic in terms of permanent dismissal or jail, the work force may resort to a \nslowdown or to shoddy work on the job. The often undeclared and anonymous nature of such action makes it \nparticularly difficult for the antagonist to assess blame or apply sanctions. In industry, the slowdown has come to be \ncalled an \"Italian\" strike; it is used particularly when repression is feared, as in Poland under martial law in 1983.14 \nPiece-work has of course often been used as a means of circumventing forms of resistance open to workers who are \npaid by the hour or day. Where piece-work prevails, as it did in silk and cotton weaving in nineteenth-century Germany, \nresistance is likely to find expression not in slowdowns, which are self-defeating, but in such forms as the \n\"shortweighting of finished cloth, defective workmanship, and the purloining of materials.\"15 Each form of labor \ncontrol or payment is thus likely, other things equal, to generate its own distinctive forms of quiet resistance and \n\"counterappropriation.\"\n13. Ann Laura Stoler, Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 18701979 (New Haven: \nYale Univ. Press, 1985), 184.\n14. See, for example, New York Times, Aug. 18, 1983, p. A6, \"Polish Underground Backs Call for Slowdown,\" in \nwhich it is noted that \"The tactic of a slowdown, known in Poland as an Italian Strike, has been used in the past by \nworkers because it reduces the risk of reprisal.\"\n15.

Inasmuch \nas the objective of the resisters is typically to meet such pressing needs as physical safety, food, land, or income, and to \ndo so in relative safety, they may simply follow the line of least resistance. Prussian peasants and proletarians in the \n1830s, beleaguered by dwarf holdings and wages below subsistance, responded by emigration or by poaching wood, \nfodder, and game on a large scale. The pace of \"forest crime\" rose as wages declined, as provisions became more \nexpensive, and where emigration was more difficult; in 1836 there were 207,000 prosecutions in Prussia, 150,000 of \nwhich were for forest offenses.16 They were supported by a mood of popular complicity that originated in earlier \ntraditions of free access to forests, but the poachers cared little whether the rabbits or firewood they took came from the \nland of their particular employer or landlord. Thus, the reaction to an appropriation in one sphere may lead its victims to \nexploit small openings available elsewhere that are perhaps more accessible and less dangerous.17\nSuch techniques of resistance are well adapted to the particular characteristics of the peasantry. Being a diverse class of \n\"low classness,\" scattered across the countryside, often lacking the discipline and leadership that would encourage \nopposition of a more organized sort, the peasantry is best suited to extended guerrilla-style campaigns of attrition that \nrequire little or no coordination. Their individual acts of foot dragging and evasion are often reinforced by a venerable \npopular culture of resistance. Seen in the light of a supportive subculture and the knowledge that the risk to any single \nresister is generally reduced to the extent that the whole community is involved, it becomes plausible to speak of a \nsocial movement. Curiously, however, this is a social movement with no formal organization, no formal leaders, no \nmanifestoes, no dues, no name, and no banner. By virtue of their institutional invisibility, activities on anything less \nthan a massive scale are, if they are noticed at all, rarely accorded any social significance.\nMultiplied many thousandfold, such petty acts of resistance by peasants may in the end make an utter shambles of the \npolicies dreamed up by their would-\n16. Ibid., 13. In 1842, for Baden, there was one such conviction for every four inhabitants. For three centuries \npoaching was perhaps the most common rural crime in England and the subject of much repressive \nlegislation. See, for example, the selections by Douglas Hay and E. P. Thompson in Albion's Fatal Tree: \nCrime and Society in Eighteenth-Century England by Douglas Hay, Peter Linebaugh, John G. Rule, E. P. \nThompson, and Cal Winslow (New York: Pantheon, 1975).\n17. Apparently the theft of wood in Germany in this period rarely touched communal forests. It goes without \nsaying that, when a poor man survives by taking from others in the same situation, we can no longer speak of \nresistance. One central question to ask about any subordinate class is the extent to which it can, by internal \nsanctions, prevent the dog-eat-dog competition among themselves that can only serve the interests of appropriating \nclasses.\n  \n< previous page\npage_35\nnext page >\n",

Policies may be recast in line with more realistic \nexpectations. They may be retained but reinforced with positive incentives aimed at encouraging voluntary compliance. \nAnd, of course, the state may simply choose to employ more coercion. Whatever the response, we must not miss the \nfact that the action of the peasantry has thus changed or narrowed the policy options available to the state. It is in this \nfashion, and not through revolts, let alone legal political pressure, that the peasantry has classically made its political \npresence felt. Thus any history or theory of peasant politics that attempts to do justice to the peasantry as a historical \nactor must necessarily come to grips with what I have chosen to call everyday forms of resistance. For this reason alone \nit is important to both document and bring some conceptual order to this seeming welter of human activity.\nEveryday forms of resistance make no headlines.18 Just as millions of anthozoan polyps create, willy-nilly, a coral reef, \nso do thousands upon thousands of individual acts of insubordination and evasion create a political or economic barrier \nreef of their own. There is rarely any dramatic confrontation, any moment that is particularly newsworthy. And \nwhenever, to pursue the simile, the ship of state runs aground on such a reef, attention is typically directed to the \nshipwreck itself and not to the vast aggregation of petty acts that made it possible. It is only rarely that the perpetrators \nof these petty acts seek to call attention to themselves. Their safety lies in their anonymity. It is also extremely rarely \nthat officials of the state wish to publicize the insubordination. To do so would be to admit that their policy is \nunpopular, and, above all, to expose the tenuousness of their authority in the countrysideneither of which the sovereign \nstate finds in its interest.19 The nature of the acts themselves and the self-interested muteness of the antagonists thus \nconspire to create a kind of complicitous silence that all but expunges everyday forms of resistance from the historical \nrecord.\nHistory and social science, because they are written by an intelligentsia using written records that are also created \nlargely by literate officials, is simply not well equipped to uncover the silent and anonymous forms of class struggle that\n18. As Hobsbawm and Rude point out, it is not only conservative elites who have overlooked this form of \nresistance, but also the urban left: \"The historians of social movements seem to have reacted very much like \nthe rest of the urban leftto which most of them have traditionally belongedi.e. they have tended to be unaware \nof it unless and until it appeared in sufficiently dramatic form or on a sufficiently large scale for the city \nnewspapers to take notice.\"\n19. But not entirely. District-level records are likely to prove rewarding in this respect, as district officials attempt \nto explain the shortfall in, say, tax receipts or conscription figures to their superiors in the capital. One imagines \nalso that the informal, oral record is abundant, for example informal cabinet or ministerial meetings called to deal \nwith policy failures caused by rural insubordination.\n  \n< previous page\npage_36\nnext page >\n",

Collectively, this unlikely cabal contributes to a stereotype of the peasantry, enshrined in both \nliterature and in history, as a class that alternates between long periods of abject passivity and brief, violent, and futile \nexplosions of rage.\nHe had centuries of fear and submission behind him, his shoulders had become hardened to blows, his soul so \ncrushed that he did not recognise his own degradation. You could beat him and starve him and rob him of \neverything, year in, year out, before he would abandon his caution and stupidity, his mind filled with all sorts \nof muddled ideas which he could not properly understand; and this went on until a culmination of injustice \nand suffering flung him at his master's throat like some infuriated domestic animal who had been subjected to \ntoo many thrashings.21\nThere is a grain of truth in Zola's view, but only a grain. It is true that the \"onstage\" behavior of peasants during times of \nquiescence yields a picture of submission, fear, and caution. By contrast, peasant insurrections seem like visceral \nreactions of blind fury. What is missing from the account of \"normal\" passivity is the slow, grinding, quiet struggle over \nrents, crops, labor, and taxes in which submission and stupidity are often no more than a posea necessary tactic. What is \nmissing from the picture of the periodic explosions is the underlying vision of justice that informs them and their \nspecific goals and targets, which are often quite rational indeed.22 The explosions themselves are frequently a sign that \nthe normal and largely covert forms of class struggle are failing or have reached a crisis point. Such declarations of open \nwar, with their mortal risks, normally come only after a protracted struggle on different terrain.\nResistance as Thought and Symbol\nThus far, I have treated everyday forms of peasant resistance as if they were not much more than a collection of \nindividual acts or behaviors.

But inasmuch as I seek to understand the resistance \nof thinking, social beings, I can hardly fail to ignore their consciousnessthe meaning they give to their acts. The \nsymbols, the norms, the ideological forms they create constitute the indispensable background to their behavior. \nHowever partial or imperfect their understanding of the situation, they are gifted with intentions and values and \npurposefulness that condition their acts. This is so evident that it would hardly merit restating were it not for the \nlamentable tendency in behavioral science to read mass behavior directly from the statistical abstracts on income, \ncaloric intake, newspaper circulation, or radio ownership. I seek, then, not only to uncover and describe the patterns of \neveryday resistance as a distinctive behavior with far-reaching implications, but to ground that description in an analysis \nof the conflicts of meaning and value in which these patterns arise and to which they contribute.\nThe relationship between thought and action is, to put it very mildly, a complicated issue. Here I wish to emphasize only \ntwo fairly straightforward points. First, neither intentions nor acts are \"unmoved movers.\" Acts born of intentions circle \nback, as it were, to influence consciousness and hence subsequent intentions and acts. Thus acts of resistance and \nthoughts about (or the meaning of) resistance are in constant communicationin constant dialogue. Second, intentions \nand consciousness are not tied in quite the same way to the material world as behavior is. It is possible and common for \nhuman actors to conceive of a line of action that is, at the moment, either impractical or impossible. Thus a person may \ndream of a revenge or a millennial kingdom of justice that may never occur. On the other hand, as circumstances \nchange, it may become possible to act on those dreams. The realm of consciousness gives us a kind of privileged access \nto lines of action that mayjust maybecome plausible at some future date. How, for example, can we give an adequate \naccount of any peasant rebellion without some knowledge of the shared values, the \"offstage\" talk, the consciousness of \nthe peasantry prior to rebellion?23 How, finally, can we understand everyday forms of resistance without reference to \nthe intentions, ideas, and language of those human beings who practice it?\nThe study of the social consciousness of subordinate classes is important for yet another reason. It may allow us to \nclarify a major debate in both the Marxist and non-Marxist literaturea debate that centers on the extent to which elites\n23. Lest this seem implicitly and one-sidedly to treat consciousness as prior to and in some sense causing \nbehavior, one could just as easily recoil one step and inquire about the construction of this consciousness. \nSuch an inquiry would necessarily begin with the social givens of the actor's position in society.

Let us assume that we can establish that a given group is exploited and that, further, \nthis exploitation takes place in a context in which the coercive force at the disposal of the elites and/or the state makes \nany open expression of discontent virtually impossible. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the only behavior \nobservable is apparently acquiescent, at least two divergent interpretations of this state of affairs are possible. One may \nclaim that the exploited group, because of a hegemonic religious or social ideology, actually accepts its situation as a \nnormal, even justifiable part of the social order. This explanation of passivity assumes at least a fatalistic acceptance of \nthat social order and perhaps even an active complicityboth of which Marxists might call \"mystification\" or \"false-\nconsciousness.\"24 It typically rests on the assumption that elites dominate not only the physical means of production but \nthe symbolic means of production as well25and that this symbolic hegemony allows them to control the very standards \nby which their rule is evaluated.26 As Gramsci argued, elites control the \"ideological sectors\" of societyculture, \nreligion, education, and mediaand can thereby engineer consent for their rule. By creating and disseminating a universe \nof discourse and the concepts to go with it, by defining the standards of what is true, beautiful, moral, fair, and \nlegitimate, they build a symbolic climate that prevents subordinate classes from thinking their way free. In fact, for \nGramsci, the proletariat is more enslaved at the level of ideas than at the level of behavior. The historic task of \"the \nparty\" is therefore less to lead a revolution than to break the symbolic miasma that blocks revolutionary thought. Such \ninterpretations have been invoked to account for lower-class quiescence, particularly in rural societies such as India, \nwhere a\n24.

Rodney Livingston (Cambridge, \nMass.: MIT Press, 1971). Marx, to my knowledge, never used the term \"false-consciousness,\" although \"the \nfetishism of commodities\" may be read this way. But the fetishism of commodities mystifies especially the \nbourgeoisie, not merely subordinate classes. For a critical view of \"hegemony\" as it might apply to the peasantry, \nsee James C.

Lower castes are said to accept their \nfate in the Hindu hierarchy in the hope of being rewarded in the next life.27\nAn alternative interpretation of such quiescence might be that it is to be explained by the relationships of force in the \ncountryside and not by peasant values and beliefs.28 Agrarian peace, in this view, may well be the peace of repression \n(remembered and/or anticipated) rather than the peace of consent or complicity.\nThe issues posed by these divergent interpretations are central to the analysis of peasant politics and, beyond that, to the \nstudy of class relationships in general. Much of the debate on these issues has taken place as if the choice of \ninterpretation were more a matter of the ideological preferences of the analyst than of actual research. Without \nunderestimating the problems involved, I believe there are a number of ways in which the question can be empirically \naddressed. It is possible, in other words, to say something meaningful about the relative weight of consciousness, on the \none hand, and repression (in fact, memory, or potential) on the other, in restraining acts of resistance.\nThe argument for false-consciousness, after all, depends on the symbolic alignment of elite and subordinate class \nvaluesthat is, on the assumption that the peasantry (proletariat) actually accepts most of the elite vision of the social \norder. What does mystification mean, if not a group's assent to the social ideology that justifies its exploitation? To the \nextent that an exploited group's outlook is in substantial symbolic alignment with elite values, the case for mystification \nis strengthened; to the extent that it holds deviant or contradictory values, the case is weakened. A close study of the \nsubculture of a subordinate group and its relation to dominant elite values should thus give us part of the answer we \nseek. The evidence will seldom be cut and dried, for any group's social outlook will contain a number of diverse and \neven contradictory currents. It is not the mere existence of deviant subcultural themes that is notable, for they are well-\nnigh universal, but rather the forms they may take, the values they embody, and the emotional attachment they inspire. \nThus, even in the absence of resistance, we are not without resources to address the question of false-consciousness.\nTo relieve the somewhat abstract nature of the argument thus far, it may be helpful to illustrate the kind of evidence that \nmight bear directly on this issue. Suppose, for example, that the \"onstage\" linguistic term for sharecropping or for \ntenancy is one that emphasizes its fairness and justice. Suppose, further, that the term used by tenants behind the backs \nof landlords to describe this rela-\n27.

When Haji Ayub and Haji \nKadir are called Haji \"Broom,\" Haji Kedikut, or Pak Ceti behind their backs, is it not plausible evidence that their claim \nto land, to interest, to rents, and to respect is at least contested at the level of consciousness, if not at the level of \n\"onstage\" acts? What are we to make of lower-class religious sects (the Quakers in seventeenth-century England, \nSaminists in twentieth-century Java, to name only two of many) that abandon the use of honorifics to address their \nsocial betters and insist instead on low forms of address or on using words like \"friend\" or \"brother\" to describe \neveryone. Is this not telling evidence that the elite's libretto for the hierarchy of nobility and respect is, at the very least, \nnot sung word for word by its subjects?\nBy reference to the culture that peasants fashion from their experiencetheir \"offstage\" comments and conversation, their \nproverbs, folksongs, and history, legends, jokes, language, ritual, and religionit should be possible to determine to what \ndegree, and in what ways, peasants actually accept the social order propagated by elites. Some elements of lower-class \nculture are of course more relevant to this issue than others. For any agrarian system, one can identify a set of key \nvalues that justify the right of an elite to the deference, land, taxes, and rent it claims. It is, in large part, an empirical \nmatter whether such key values find support or opposition within the subculture of subordinate classes. If bandits and \npoachers are made into folkheroes, we can infer that transgressions of elite codes evoke a vicarious admiration. If the \nforms of outward deference are privately mocked, it may suggest that peasants are hardly in the thrall of a naturally \nordained social order. If those who try to curry the personal favor of elites are shunned and ostracized by others of their \nclass, we have evidence that there is a lower-class subculture with sanctioning power. Rejection of elite values, \nhowever, is seldom an across-the-board proposition, and only a close study of peasant values can define the major \npoints of friction and correspondence. In this sense, points of friction become diagnostic only when they center on key \nvalues in the social order, grow, and harden.\nThe Experience and Consciousness of Human Agents\nIt was with such issues in mind that I spent more than a year and a half in the village of Sedaka listening, asking \nquestions, and trying to understand the issues that animated villagers during my stay among them.

Much of that account, though not all of it, is an account of what \nappears to be a losing class struggle against capitalist agricultural development and its human agents. It goes without \nsaying that I have thought it important to listen carefully to the human agents I was studying, to their experience, to their \ncategories, to their values, to their understanding of the situation. There are several reasons for building this kind of \nphenomenological approach into the study.\nThe first reason has to do with how social science can and ought to be conducted. It is fashionable in some of the more \nstructuralist variants of neo-Marxism to assume that one can infer the nature of class relations in any nonsocialist Third \nWorld country directly from a few diagnostic featuresthe dominant mode of production, the mode and timing of \ninsertion into the world economy, or the mode of surplus appropriation. This procedure entails a highly reductionist leap \nstraight from one or a very few economic givens to the class situation that is presumed to follow from these givens. \nThere are no human actors here, only mechanisms and puppets. To be sure, the economic givens are crucial; they define \nmuch, but not all, of the situation that human actors face; they place limits on the responses that are possible, \nimaginable. But those limits are wide and, within them, human actors fashion their own response, their own experience \nof class, their own history. As E. P. Thompson notes in his polemic against Althusser:\nnor is it [the epistemological refusal of experience] pardonable in a Marxist, since experience is a necessary \nmiddle term between social being and social consciousness: it is experience (often class experience) which \ngives a coloration to culture, to values, and to thought; it is by means of experience that the mode of \nproduction exerts a determining pressure upon other activities. . . . classes arise because men and women, in \ndeterminate productive relations, identify their antagonistic interests, and come to struggle, to think, and to \nvalue in class ways: thus the process of class formation is a process of self-making, although under conditions \nwhich are given.30\nHow else can a mode of production affect the nature of class relations except as it is mediated by human experience and \ninterpretation? Only by capturing that experience in something like its fullness will we be able to say anything \nmeaningful about how a given economic system influences those who constitute it and maintain it or supersede it. And, \nof course, if this is true for the peasantry or the proletariat, it is surely true for the bourgeoisie, the petite bourgeoisie, \nand even the lumpenproletariat.31 To omit the experience of human agents from the analysis of class relations is to have \ntheory swallow its own tail.\n30.The Poverty of Theory and Other Essays (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978), 98, 10607.\n31.

It is all very well to identify a collection of individuals who all occupy a comparable position in relation to the \nmeans of productiona class-in-itself. But what if such objective, structural determinations find little echo in the \nconsciousness and meaningful activity of those who are thus identified?32 In place of simply assuming a one-to-one \ncorrespondence between \"objective\" class structure and consciousness, is it not far preferable to understand how those \nstructures are apprehended by flesh-and-blood human actors? Class, after all, does not exhaust the total explanatory \nspace of social actions. Nowhere is this more true than within the peasant village, where class may compete with \nkinship, neighborhood, faction, and ritual links as foci of human identity and solidarity. Beyond the village level, it may \nalso compete with ethnicity, language group, religion, and region as a focus of loyalty. Class may be applicable to some \nsituations but not to others; it may be reinforced or crosscut by other ties; it may be far more important for the \nexperience of some than of others. Those who are tempted to dismiss all principles of human action that contend with \nclass identity as \"false-consciousness\" and to wait for Althusser's \"determination in the last instance\" are likely to wait \nin vain. In the meantime, the messy reality of multiple identities will continue to be the experience out of which social \nrelations are conducted. Neither peasants nor proletarians deduce their identities directly or solely from the mode of \nproduction, and the sooner we attend to the concrete experience of class as it is lived, the sooner we will appreciate both \nthe obstacles to, and the possibilities for, class formation.\nA further justification for a close analysis of class relations is that in the village, and not only there, classes travel under \nstrange and deceptive banners. They are not apprehended as ghostly, abstract concepts but in the all-too-human form of \nspecific individuals and groups, specific conflicts and struggles. Piven and Cloward capture the specificity of this \nexperience for the working class:\nFirst, people experience deprivation and oppression within a concrete setting, not as the end product of large \nand abstract processes, and it is the concrete experience that molds their discontent into specific grievances \nagainst specific targets. Workers experience the factory, the speeding rhythm of the assembly line, the \nforemen, the spies, the guards, the owner, and the pay check. They do not experience monopoly capitalism.33\nIn the same fashion the Malay peasant experiences increasing land rents, stingy\n32.

He does not experience the cash nexus or the capitalist pyramid of finance that makes of those \nlandlords, combine-harvester owners, moneylenders, and bureaucrats only the penultimate link in a complex process. \nSmall wonder, then, that the language of class in the village should bear the birthmarks of its distinctive origin. \nVillagers do not call Pak Haji Kadir an agent of finance capital; they call him Kadir Ceti because it was through the \nChettiar moneylending caste, which dominated rural credit from about 1910 until World War II, that the Malay peasant \nmost forcibly experienced finance capital. The fact that the word Chettiar has similar connotations for millions of \npeasants in Vietnam and Burma as well is a tribute to the homogenization of experience which the capitalist penetration \nof Southeast Asia brought in its wake. Nor is it simply a question of recognizing a disguise and uncovering the real \nrelationship that lies behind it. For the disguise, the metaphor, is part of the real relationship. The Malays historically \nexperienced the moneylender as a moneylender and as a Chettiarthat is, as a foreigner and a non-Muslim. Similarly, the \nMalay typically experiences the shopkeeper and the rice buyer not only as a creditor and wholesaler but as a person of \nanother race and another religion. Thus the concept of class as it is lived is nearly always an alloy containing base \nmetals; its concrete properties, its uses, are those of the alloy and not of the pure metals it may contain. Either we take it \nas we find it or we abandon the empirical study of class altogether.\nThat the experienced concept of class should be found embedded in a particular history of social relations is hardly to be \ndeplored. It is this rootedness of the experience that gives it its power and its meaning. When the experience is widely \nshared, the symbols that embody class relations can come to have an extraordinary evocative power. One can imagine, \nin this context, how individual grievances become collective grievances and how collective grievances may take on the \ncharacter of a class-based myth tied, as always, to local experience. Thus, a particular peasant may be a tenant of a \nlandlord whom he regards as particularly oppressive. He may grumble; he may even have fantasies about telling the \nlandlord what he thinks of him or even darker thoughts of arson or homicide. If this is an isolated, personal grievance, \nthe affair is likely to stop thereat fantasy. If, however, many tenants find themselves in the same boat, either because \nthey share the same landlord or because their landlords treat them in comparable ways, there arises the basis for a \ncollective grievance, collective fantasy, and even collective acts. Peasants are then likely to find themselves trading \nstories about bad landlords and, since some landlords are likely to be more notorious than others, they become the focus \nof elaborate stories, the repository of the collective grievances of much of the community against that kind of landlord \nin general. Thus, we have the legend of Haji Broom, which has become a kind of metaphorical shorthand for large-scale \nlandlordism in the region. Thus,\n  \n< previous page\npage_44\nnext page >\n",

The way was already \nsymbolically prepared. But the central point to be emphasized is simply that the concept of class, if it is to be found at \nall, is to be found encoded in concrete, shared experience that reflects both the cultural material and historical givens of \nits carriers. In the West, the concept of food is expressed most often by bread. In most of Asia, it means rice.34 The \nshorthand for capitalist in America may be Rockefeller, with all the historical connotations of that name; the shorthand \nfor bad landlord in Sedaka is Haji Broom, with all the historical connotations of that name.\nFor all these reasons, the study of class relations in Sedaka, as elsewhere, must of necessity be as much a study of \nmeaning and experience as it is of behavior considered narrowly. No other procedure is possible inasmuch as behavior \nis never self-explanatory. One need cite only the famous example of a rapid closing and opening of a single eyelid, used \nby Gilbert Ryle and elaborated on by Clifford Geertz, to illustrate the problem.35 Is it a twitch or a wink? Mere \nobservation of the physical act gives no clue. If it is a wink, what kind of wink is it: one of conspiracy, of ridicule, of \nseduction? Only a knowledge of the culture, the shared understandings, of the actor and his or her observers and \nconfederates can begin to tell us; and even then we must allow for possible misunderstandings. It is one thing to know \nthat landlords have raised cash rents for rice land; it is another to know what this behavior means for those affected. \nPerhaps, just perhaps, tenants regard the rise in rents as reasonable and long overdue. Perhaps they regard the rise as \noppressive and intended to drive them off the land. Perhaps opinion is divided. Only an inquiry into the experience of \ntenants, the meaning they attach to the event, can offer us the possibility of an answer.

A \ntheft of grain, an apparent snub, an apparent gifttheir import is inaccessible to us unless we can construct it from the \nmeanings only human actors can provide. In this sense, we concentrate at least as much on the experience of behavior as \non behavior itself, as much on history as carried in people's heads as on \"the flow of events,\"36 as much on how class is \nperceived and understood as on \"objective class relations.\"\nThe approach taken here certainly relies heavily on what is known as phenomenology or ethnomethodology.37 But it is \nnot confined to that approach, for it is only slightly more true that people speak for themselves than that behavior speaks \nfor itself. Pure phenomenology has its own pitfalls. A good deal of behavior, including speech, is automatic and \nunreflective, based on understandings that are seldom if ever raised to the level of consciousness. A careful observer \nmust provide an interpretation of such behavior that is more than just a repetition of the \"commonsense\" knowledge of \nparticipants. As an interpretation, it has to be judged by the standards of its logic, its economy, and its consistency with \nother known social facts. Human agents may also provide contradictory accounts of their own behavior, or they may \nwish to conceal their understanding from the observer or from one another. Hence, the same standards of interpretation \napply, although the ground is admittedly treacherous. Beyond this, there simply are factors in any situation that shed \nlight on the action of human agents, but of which they can scarcely be expected to be aware. An international credit \ncrisis, changes in worldwide demand for food grains, a quiet factional struggle in the cabinet that affects agrarian policy, \nsmall changes in the genetic makeup of seed grain, for example, may each have a decided impact on local social \nrelations whether or not they are known to the actors involved. Such knowledge is what an outside observer can often \nadd to a description of the situation as a supplement to, not a substitute for, the description that human agents \nthemselves provide. For however partial or even mistaken the experienced reality of the human agents, it is that \nexperienced reality that provides the basis for their understanding and their action. Finally, there is no such thing as a \ncomplete account of experienced reality, no \"full verbal transcript of the conscious experience.\"38 The fullness of the \ntranscript is limited both by the empirical and analytical interests of the transcriberin this case, class relations broadly \nconstruedand by the practical limits of time and space.\n36.

Even then of course they were scarcely autonomous.1 The state was already mobilizing labor to \ndig drainage canals, thereby opening new paddy land and enlarging its revenue base. The trade in rice through Penang \nhad already monetized the economy sufficiently to expose it to larger market forces. Beyond these social forces that \nshaped their world, there were, above all, the vagaries of a capricious nature that, year in and year out, determined how \nwell they ate, or if they ate at all.\nThe shift has been a shift of degree, but massive enough to constitute a qualitative change. It is not so much that \nagriculture is no longer a gamble, but rather that the terms of the season-by-season wager are now decisively set by \nsocial forces that originate far outside the village sphere. Everything from the timing of water supply, and hence the \nschedule of transplanting and harvesting, to the cost of fertilizer and tractor services, the price of paddy, the cost of \nmilling, the conditions of credit, and the cost of labor is so much an artifact of state policy and the larger economy that \nthe sphere of local autonomy has shrunk appreciably.\nA detailed account of the social history of Sedaka and of the outside forces that impinge on it is neither necessary nor \nplausible here. What is necessary, however, is a sketch of the major features of the landscape that forms the context of \nvillage class relations. The background of this landscape, the basic countours of the postcolonial state and of the \neconomy, though definitely man-made, is for all practical purposes a given that is rarely, if ever, noticed by the petty \nactors who are the center of our attention. One cannot, after all, expect the fish to talk about the water; it is simply the \nmedium in which they live and breathe. Most of the elaborate, commonsense knowledge that villagers have in great \nabundance is of course ultimately predicated on these gross features of their taken-for-granted landscape. In any \ndifferent context, much of what they know would make little\n1.

The characteristic features of this basic landscape create palpable limits to what, in the short run at least, is \npossible; they also create opportunities and exert a determinate pressure on the nature of class relations. Thus, it is the \nlegally enforced system of private property in land that makes landlord-tenant relations both possible and common as a \nfocus of class conflict. Thus, it is the practice of electoral competition, however severely circumscribed, that permits \npolitical conflict to be channeled and institutionalized in certain ways. Private property in land and elections, as social \ncreations, are hardly immutable but, so long as they persist, they come to be assumed as \"natural\" facts like the clayey \nsoils or monsoon rains in Sedaka.2\nIn what might be called the middle ground of this landscape stand the economic and social facts of, say, the past ten \nyears. The most prominent of the landmarks here are the consequences of double-cropping for tenure, income, work, \nmobility, stratification, and social structure in the entire region, of which Sedaka is but a small fragment. Scarcely less \nprominent is the change in both the scope and nature of government activity. This middle ground is in sharper focus; it \nmanifests itself more palpably in the daily lives of rice farmers; it represents the environment to which they have had to \nadjust; it is, finally, a subject about which peasants have very decided, if divergent, opinions. To sketch the contours of \nthis middle ground is to establish the basic social and economic facts that are then subject to the interpretations that \nvillagers give them. If, for example, the loss of wage labor income attributable to combine-harvesters is strongly \ndeplored by many villagers, it would be helpful to know both how widespread this pattern is and what the typical losses \nare. The purpose of sketching this middle ground is not to let the facts speak for themselves (they never do), but rather \nto establish something of a baseline of experienced givens that form the point of departure for relations between classes.\nThe foreground of the landscapethe changes of the past decade as they have become manifest within the village of \nSedakawill be depicted in chapter 4. These two chapters constitute the setting for local experience and activity.\nThe array of facts presented have been chosen with two principles of selection in mind. First, I have judged that the \nmassive transformation in techniques of production and production relations attendant on double-cropping were the \ncentral facts for class relations in Sedaka. Second, in selecting among those facts, I have also been guided by the \nconcerns that seemed to preoccupy villagers themselves. If the levels of land rents or the loss of harvest work aroused \ngreat worry, I let that worry influence my selection of facts. No doubt I have left out some\n2. It is in this sense, and only in this sense, that one may perhaps speak of \"false-consciousness.\" Even in this \nrealm, peasants are quite capable of imagining a different system of property or a political system without \nelections and of expressing an opinion on such issues. Speculations of this kind are, however, of little \npractical relevance to the context of daily social action.\n  \n< previous page\npage_49\nnext page >\n",

But it appeared preferable to be guided by their experience rather than my own, for it is from \ntheir experience that their reactions are shaped.\nBackground:  \nMalaysia and the Paddy Sector\nIf one had to be a peasant somewhere in Southeast Asia, there is little doubt that Malaysia would be the first choice by \nnearly any standard. Its advantages include an open, buoyant, capitalist economy with an abundance of natural \nresources, a relatively favorable population-to-land ratio, a political system that, if not democratic, does at least allow \nsome political opposition, and a state that is less predatory than most of its neighbors. In terms of health services, \neducation, water and electricity supply, transportation, flood control, and irrigation, it has almost surely done more for \nits population than any other Southeast Asian state.3 Its rate of growth over the past twenty years has made it the envy \nof its neighbors and the darling of international lending agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development \nBank. Gross national product per capita has grown at an average annual rate of 3.9 percent from 1960 to 1976, a rate far \nhigher than the median for low-income countries or middle-income countries and higher also than the median for \nindustrial nations.4 Thus, despite rapid population growth (3 percent annually), Malaysia achieved a per capita gross \nnational product of over US$1, 100 by 1978, a figure that dwarfed, by a factor of 2, that of any major Southeast Asian \ncountry.5\nIf ever there was a case of export-led growth, it is Malaysia. In 1980 the country was the world's largest exporter of \ntropical hardwoods, tin, rubber, and palm oil, and it has been a net exporter of petroleum since 1975. One result of a \nconsistently favorable balance of trade has been to swell government revenue nearly fourfold between 1966 and 1976, \nthereby enormously expanding the policy options and development expenditures of the state. By Southeast Asian \nstandards at least the Malaysian treasury is literally awash with revenue. Another result has been to reinforce the \ndependence of the economy on the markets for its mostly primary export commodities. That dependence is now far \nmore diversified than in the past when it rested on tin and rubber, but it is a marked dependence nontheless. As is so \noften the case, even the impressive growth of\n3.

Foreign \ndomination of the economy has also persisted, albeit in modified form. Once entrenched, primarily in the plantation \nsector, foreign enterprises became prominent both in import substitution (for example, textiles, steel, motor vehicle \nassembly) and in export-goods industries (for example, electrical machinery, transistors) in free-trade zones. As of 1974 \nmore than 60 percent of the share capital of Malaysian corporations was held by foreigners.\nIn this context, the needs of smallholder agriculture in general and the paddy sector in particular have never been a top \npriority of either the colonial or the postcolonial state. As the main source of foreign exchange and government revenue, \nthe plantation sector has always had its requirements for infrastructure, labor, land, and capital take precedence. Now, \nwith a growing urban work force, the effort to minimize labor costs by keeping the domestic price of rice (the major \nstaple) low has become even more compelling.\nAs elsewhere, the pattern of capitalist development, export-led growth, and encouragement of foreign investment has \nalso resulted in a growing maldistribution of income. This has occurred despite a remarkable overall rate of growth and \ngovernment programs directly aimed at redressing poverty. It is reflected in the growing disparity between average \nincomes in the traditional agricultural sector and the remainder of the economy from 1960 to 1970. While the gap was \non the order of 1 to 2.5 in 1960, it grew to more than 1 to 3 in 1970.6 It is reflected as well in the widening gulf between \nthe incomes of those below the official poverty line and those above it. From 1960 to 1970, for example, the real \nincomes of the rural poor actually declined by as much as 0.4 percent per annum, while the incomes of the rest of the \npopulation grew at about 2.4 percent annually.7 Over the next eight years (197078) the real incomes of the rural poor \ngrew (2.4 percent annually), but at a rate less than half that of the rest of the population (5.2 percent). Not only have the \ndisparities in income grown markedly over nearly two decades, but by 1978 the real incomes of the two major groups of \nrural poor-paddy smallholders and rubber tapperswere not appreciably better than they had been in 1960. What we have, \nin effect, then is a pattern of overall capitalist growth that has generated greater inequities\n6. Young et al., Malaysia's Growth, 31. The \"traditional agricultural sector\" here excludes the estate sector, \nwhich accounted for only 18 percent of the agricultural labor force in 1970. Three-fourths of agricultural \nemployment is, by contrast, concentrated in rubber and rice smallholdings.\n7.

The first is the concern of the \nstate to assure the steady domestic supply of rice.9 When imported rice was cheap and abundant and when rubber and \ntin prices were buoyant, the colonial policy of using export earnings to buy rice from abroad seemed to make sense. \nFrom time to time, however, the assumptions on which the policy was based failed to hold. In 1931, for example, the \nslump in export prices called into question the colony's ability to pay for the rice it needed. For the first time, the \ngovernment began to address the question of self-sufficiency in rice; Malay Reservation laws were passed to prevent \nland from passing out of Malay hands and out of paddy cultivation and in 1939 a guaranteed minimum paddy price was \nestablished. Despite these initiatives, Malaya continued to import, on average, half of the rice it consumed, for even at \nthe depth of the Depression rubber tapping was more profitable than growing rice. A rice-provisioning crisis following \nWorld War II and then, in 1954, a paddy price slump that threatened producer incomes and prompted large \ndemonstrations of farmers in Alor Setar gave renewed urgency to the issue of self-sufficiency. The result was a modest \nprogram of loans to help indebted farmers redeem their mortgaged land and a Padi Cultivators' Ordinance designed to \ncontrol paddy rents and ensure security of tenure. This last has remained virtually a dead letter to this day. Such \nineffective patchwork solutions were inevitable, inasmuch as the state was unwilling to raise greatly the farm-gate price \nfor fear of what this would imply for the wages of the plantation and urban work force. Progress toward self-sufficiency \nwould have to await the new inputs and double-cropping technology of the last two decades.\nThe second, and by far most important, stimulus for addressing the needs of the paddy sector has been the nature of \npolitical competition since independence. To put it crudely, the dominant political party since independence (the United \nMalay Nationalists' Organization, UMNO) is an exclusively Malay party that depends largely on Malay votes to keep it \nin power. Many of those votes must come from paddy farmers, who are overwhelmingly Malays. The electoral system\n8. If one were to shift one's focus from income to amenities such as health services and education, the picture \nwould be more encouraging. For it is in this area that government policies have made a substantial impact. It \nis also true of course that, without the government programs directed toward the rural poor, the income \nstatistics would have been even more dismaying.\n9. For a fine account of rice policy, see Otto Charles Doering, III, \"Malaysian Rice Policy and the Muda Irrigation \nProject\" (Ph.D. diss., Cornell University, 1973).\n  \n< previous page\npage_52\nnext page >\n",

There is virtually no municipal self-government, thereby ensuring \nthat the largely Chinese towns will not fall into the hands of Chinese opposition parties. An internal security act allows \nthe government to hobble the activities of both religious and left-wing opposition with preventive detention. Finally, a \npattern of parliamentary constituencies of unequal population size makes the Malay vote far more influential than it \nwould otherwise be. The electoral system has nevertheless played a vital role since 1957 in legitimizing the rule of the \nMalay political elite and of the National Front (Barisan Nasional), which it dominates.\nThe juxtaposition of a modified electoral regime with an open, export-oriented economy that has exacerbated inequities \nin income distribution provides a setting in which the Malay paddy farmer has become a vital political factor. Consider \nthe following facts. First, the average per capita income of Malays in 1970 was roughly one-half that of Chinese, the \nother major ethnic community.10 Taking only poor households, nearly three-quarters were Malay and over four-fifths \nwere rural.11 The incidence of poverty, moreover, is far higher among paddy farmers than any other major occupational \ngroup, and those paddy farmers are predominantly (84 percent) Malays. The regional distribution of this poverty is also \nnoteworthy: It is concentrated in the northern states of the peninsula (Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu), which \nproduce most of the nation's paddy and which are most heavily Malay. Little wonder that the combination of a large, \npoor, rural Malay population, together with growing income disparities, has provided the most fertile ground for inroads \nby the major Malay opposition party, PAS (Partai Islam). Following the general elections of 1969, UMNO had every \nreason to be concerned about its political hegemony among Malays; PAS had won virtually as many Malay votes \noverall as UMNO, and in the 43 seats where there was a straight fight between the two PAS is estimated to have \nreceived more Malay votes than UMNO.12 PAS has, at one time, controlled the state governments of Kelantan and \nTrengganu and in 1969 came within striking distance of winning in Kedah as well.\nThe third reason why the ruling party was forced to confront the problems of poverty and growing income disparities is \nthat they became a threat not only to its electoral hegemony but also to the fragile peace of the civil society itself. The \ncommunal riots in Kuala Lumpur and in other cities following the 1969\n10. Young et al., Malaysia's Growth, 10405, and Merrman, Public Expenditure, 89.

One major result of this concern, not \nto say panic, was what is now called the New Economic Policy. It was designed to eradicate poverty by the end of the \ncentury and restructure the economy so that race would be no longer identified with economic function.\nThe main threat to the political hegemony of the ruling party has thus been concentrated largely in the poor, Malay, \npaddy-growing states of the north, where race is very much identified with economic function. UMNO's effort to secure \nits political base in these areas is reflected in policies aimed at benefitting Malay rice producers. Virtually all of these \npolicies can be regarded as \"soft\" options. What I mean by soft options is that there has been no attempt to restructure \neither the basic pattern of property relations or the rights attached to them. The redistribution of paddy or rubber \nholdings has never been actively considered, though the inequities in both sectors are founded on unequal access to \nproductive land. Tenancy reform, a far more modest step, has been addressed, but the existing law has been effectively \nsabotaged by landlord resistance and the unwillingness of officials to enforce either registration of tenancy agreements \nor rental ceilings. Such hard options have been avoided because they have been both inconvenient and, in a sense, \nunnecessary. They are inconvenient (some would claim, impossible) because the source of UMNO's rural Malay \nsupport has always been among the influential large farmers and landlordsthe class that would have most to lose in a \nredistribution of land or a reform of tenancy. They have proven unncessary because the bonanza of overall growth and \nexport earnings has provided the wherewithal for such a lavish treatment of the symptoms of uneven development that \nthe underlying malady could, for the time being at least, be safely ignored.\nThe fiscal and administrative resources devoted to soft options have been quite impressive. Rural development \nexpenditures grew in real terms more than sixfold from independence (1957) to 1975. Much of it went to the provision \nof infrastructure and collective goodsroads, schools, clinics, piped water, electricity,\n13. The riots, which constitute a significant political watershed, were, significantly, confined to cities on the \nwest coast of the peninsula. It was particularly in such areas that Chinese and Malays were not only in \nproximity in large numbers but also felt themselves to be in economic competition. The countryside was \nimplicated in these events in at least three ways: First, the large-scale migration of Malays from a stagnant \nrural economy was seen as a source of political volatility in the cities; second, poverty in the paddy, rubber, \nand fishing sectors seemed, by itself, to increase the risk of communal violence in rural areas; and third, rural \npoverty seemed certain to increase the appeal of the Malay opposition party, then called the PMIP (Pan-\nMalayan Islamic Party).\n  \n< previous page\npage_54\nnext page >\n",

While such measures are hardly redistributive in intent, there is no doubt that they have materially improved the \nstandard of living of all rural Malays, including the poor.\nA further soft option pursued with great vigor has been the creation of government-sponsored resettlement schemes in \nthe form of rubber and oil-palm estates.14 Spending on such schemes since the mid-1960s has approached half of the \ntotal rural development expenditure and had accommodated over seventy thousand families by 1975.15 Settler incomes \nin these schemes, especially oil-palm schemes, are far above average paddy farmer incomes, and it is the dream of \nnearly every young villager in Sedaka to be chosen in the sweepstakes. In fact, very few get to go and those who do are \nnot by any means always the poorest, for settler selection is highly politicized.16 There is little doubt, however, that the \nschemes have had some impact on reducing poverty not only for the actual settlers but also for those who remain \nbehind, by at least marginally reducing the competition for land and work. Their effect is much like that of the industrial \nand construction boom in urban areas, which draws off (temporarily or permanently) a portion of the hard-pressed labor \nforce in the countryside. The land schemes, however, are the ultimate in soft options; they are only possible in a nation \nthat can afford to spend M$40,000 for each settler family and has an ample frontier of arable land.17\nBeyond supplying collective amenities and providing some alternative employment, state policy toward the paddy \nsector has also aimed directly at increasing the productivity and incomes of rice growers. The centerpieces of this \nstrategy are the Muda and Kemubu Irrigation Projects (in Kedah and Kelantan, respectively), which have allowed \nroughly eighty thousand families to double-crop rice on nearly 270,000 acres. Double cropping began in the early 1970s \nin both schemes and the overall results to date have been impressive. The combination of a second crop, fertilizers, and \nnew seeds has pushed production to about 2.5 times its previous level. Average incomes, in real terms, have grown\n14.

The profits from this \"green revolution\" have gone disproportionately, as we shall see, to the large \nowners of the scarce factors of production: land and capital. The poorest farm households have benefited only \nmarginally, and the distribution of income is now more skewed than it was previously. Direct government subsidies in \nthe form of fertilizer and production loans offered through farmers' organizations were distributed on the basis of \nacreage farmed and thus compounded the advantages already enjoyed by large-scale commercial operators.19 UMNO \ncould hardly be expected to go against the interest of its main rural supporters, the rich farmers, who were in any case \nthe source of most of the marketed paddy.\nThe impact of state intervention in paddy production on class relations was not by any means confined to its \nimplications for income distribution. By the very logic of its policy, the state displaced both the private sector and to \nsome degree even the weather as the crucial factor in farm incomes. Minimum farm-gate paddy prices had been set by \nthe state since 1939, but after independence the price level became a hot political issue, sparking major demonstrations \nin 1954 and again in 1980. Production credit and fertilizer, once the nearly exclusive domain of the Chinese shopkeeper, \nbecame by 1970 a service offered through the farmers' associations to their members. Rice milling, also once a private \nsector preserve, has come to be increasingly dominated by large state mills and drying facilities. For those seeking \noutside work, which was previously available only through the private sector, the state is now a possible employer, \nwhether through its settler schemes or through short-term employment, as during the 1978 drought. Finally, the very \nprocess of cultivation, once dependent on the onset of monsoon rains, is now for both seasons largely determined by the \nschedule of water release fixed in advance by the authorities. The state was once largely a bystander or mediator in \nthese relations with nature and the private sector. It is now a direct participant, decision maker, allocator, and antagonist \nin nearly all vital aspects of paddy growing. Most of the buffers between the state and rice farmers have fallen away, \nthereby vastly increasing both the role of politics and the possibilities for direct confrontation between the ruling party \nand its peasantry.\nAll of the state policies thus far identifiedcollective amenities, settler\n18. This estimate is for the largest scheme, Muda, as the income figures for Kemubu are a matter of current \ndispute.\n19. In theory, the fertilizer subsidy implemented in 1979 was limited to 6 acres (or 8.5 relong) per farmer, but \nlarge farmers, with the tacit complicity of the farmers' organizations, quickly found ways around this restriction. \nLike the Padi Cultivators Act before it, the limitation remained a dead letter. Even in 1955, the Rice Committee \nmade it clear that the loan fund it was providing to help redeem mortgaged lands was intended for commercial \nfarmers, not for subsistence producers.

It is hardly worth noting that these inequities may have been unintended, for the state has \ncontinued to pursue them and has made no serious effort to undo their impact. Far from it. The ruling party has in fact \nrecently embarked on a systematic policy that aims at creating what might be called a wealthy, Malay, \"hothouse\" \nbourgeoisie. This policy is pursued under the banner of increasing Malay participation in the modern sectors of the \neconomy. Nearly M$1.5 billion in expenditures on commerce and industry under the third Malaysian Plan (197680) are \ndevoted to the training and financing of Malay entrepreneurs or to direct government investment in corporations to be \nheld in trust for Malays. Other dimensions of this policy include selling of private equity shares at concessionary rates \nto Malays, reserving a certain share of government construction and supply contracts for Malays, and making certain \nthat licenses for certain trades are awarded preferentially to Malays. Whatever worthy rationales exist for this policy in \ntheory, there is little doubt that in practice it has proven to be a bonanza for well-placed Malays and has provoked more \nthan its share of scandals in a very short time.21 It has also produced an instant Malay commercial class operating with \nspecial licenses, in protected markets, with guaranteed credit from public loan funds, selling goods or servicesoften to \nthe stateat fixed prices with guaranteed profit. In the countryside, a good many rich farmers have taken advantage of the \nopportunities to obtain loans for taxis, small paddy mills, lorries, fish ponds, thereby becoming a new, \"protected \nspecies\" of petite bourgeoisie. As most of this recent class of state-sponsored capitalists is aligned with the ruling party \nand comes from the ranks of the already well-to-do, the nature of the traditional rural class cleavage based on land \nownership has taken on a new dimensionone fraught with novel possibilities for political and economic conflict.\nUMNO is a well-organized and well-financed political machine providing both individual and collective blandishments \nthat reach into every Malay village. Following its impressive electoral victory in 1978, it controlledalone or together \nwith its non-Malay coalition partners in the National Front (Barison Nasional)every state government on the peninsula \nand held over four-fifths of\n20. It might however be argued that such collective amenities as health clinics and primary schools have \nactually been redistributive in the sense that the poor were previously the most deprived of these services and \nare now the major beneficiaries.\n21.

In most rural areas UMNO represents a dominant faction of wealthy farmersmany of \nwhom have branched out into other businessestogether with their kinsmen and retainers and supported by a host of petty \nofficeholders in the area.\nUMNO's main opposition among the Malay population (Partai Islam, or PAS) has managed to retain strong support \namong Malays22 despite the fact that it cannot offer any of the material incentives that UMNO's control of the \ngovernment provides. While it is not my purpose to examine party politics per se, the persistence of political opposition \nin PAS reflects a populist amalgam of class and ethnic and religious protest that merits brief comment. In the \ncountryside, of course, PAS and UMNO may be seen partly as factions whose history predates parties. Thus many of \nthe leaders of PAS are wealthy landlords and farmers much like their UMNO counterparts. Since the PAS leaders have \nrarely had access to government patronage, however, they are less likely to have the sideline businesses that require \npolitical connections. For the rank and file of PAS, as Clive Kessler has so brilliantly shown, the party has an appeal \nthat combines class issues (touching on the income and economic security of Malay cultivators, fishermen, and rubber \ntappers), ethnic and religious issues (touching on respect for the rights and religious beliefs of the indigenous \npopulation), and, not least, a more general political opposition to a state and ruling party that are seen to have failed \nmost of the Malay population in both respects.23 PAS, unlike UMNO, seems to be rather informally organized. It relies \nheavily on popular religious teachers and their centers (pondok), which can be found throughout rural Malaysia and are \ndistinct from the official religious establishment that is typically aligned with UMNO. The way in which, say, class and \nreligious issues may be combined may be conveyed by noting the appeals made by a PAS speaker during a \nparliamentary by-election in Kedah (Bukit Raya) narrowly won by UMNO in 1980. The speaker noted the trivial profit \nfarmers could expect for each gunny sack of paddy or for tapping rubber and then asked why UMNO gave out huge \nsums of money to build Chinese and Indian temples. \"If the rubber price {per sheet} is M$2.00,\" he continued, \"the \ngovernment takes thirty cents ($.30) as its cess\n22. For example, in at least four of the parliamentary constituencies in Kedahthose of Jerlun-Langkawi, Kuala \nKedah, Ulu Muda, and Jerai (where Sedaka is located)the UMNO winning margin in 1978 was so slim as to \nindicate that PAS had won a majority of Malay votes in those constituencies but had lost because the Chinese \nminority in each case threw its votes to UMNO. Despite the fact that PAS lost seats in this election, it got 38.5 \npercent of the total vote, just one percentage point less than it received in 1969 when it came near to capturing \nthe state.

In this fashion a \npopulist understanding of Islam that extends naturally to issues of income distribution, employment, and other class \nissues as well as to matters of piety and religious law provides an ideal medium of political protest.

Most of that cultivation takes place within the five hundred or so square miles of the Kedah/Perlis \nalluvial plain, with its vast expanse of fertile, dense, marine-clay soil. (See Map 2) On an exceptionally clear day, from \natop four-thousand-foot Gunung Jerai (Kedah Peak), which lies at its southern extremity, it is possible to take in the \nentire forty-mile-long rice plain bounded on the west by the Straits of Malacca and on the east by intruding foothills of \nthe Central Range. The view is of one enormous rice paddy interrupted only by cross-hatching tree lines that indicate \nthe typically linear villages of the region and, more rarely, by a larger urban agglomeration, such as the state capital of \nAlor Setar. Depending on the stage of rice cultivation during the main, monsoon-fed season, one may view what \nappears as a vast shallow lake of flooded paddy fields not much differentiated from the straits that border it, a sea of \nvariegated greens, an expanse of golden ripening grain, or a great stretch of drab soil and stubble left after the harvest.\nThe political and social history of the Muda Plain has marked contemporary class relations in at least two significant \nways. We must first keep in mind that we are dealing with a society composed largely of pioneers and newcomersa \nfrontier societyuntil well into this century. Despite the fact that paddy has been grown here since the fourteenth century, \nmuch of the Muda Plain was only recently cleared, drained, and brought under cultivation. What continuous settlement \nthere had been was profoundly disrupted by the Siamese invasion of 1821, which reduced the population (through \nemigration) to roughly fifty thousand, or half its preinvasion level.24 Kedah did not recover its former population until \nnear the turn of the century, when a period of comparative peace and new drainage schemes stimulated a substantial \nimmigration. It is in this period\n24. R. D. Hill, Rice in Malaysia: A Study in Historical Geography (Kuala Lumpur: Oxford Univ. Press, \n1977), 54.\n  \n< previous page\npage_59\nnext page >\n",

Initial grants of land for colonization and canal digging \nwere usually given by the Sultan to favored aristocratic retainers, but they were quickly superseded and outnumbered by \na \"non-aristocratic, capitalist, 'commercial' land-owning group.\"25 The importance of this frontier history is simply that \nclass in rural Kedah is pretty much a straightforward affair of rich and poor, big and little, rather than being \ncompounded by ancient feudal distinctions between lords and serfs, aristocrats and plebeians, as they are in those areas \nin Southeast Asia much longer settled and in close proximity to royal courts.26\nThe second notable feature of regional history, and indeed of Malay history generally, is that the state has not generally \nbeen an effective instrument for the exploitation of the peasantry. As Gullick concludes in his study of precolonial \nMalay states, \"flight\" was the peasant's most common reaction to oppression,27 and owing to the mobile, frontier \ncharacter of Malay society and the limited coercive power at the disposal of the court it was usually a successful, though \npainful, remedy. Attempts by the court to mobilize corvée labor (Krah) for the building of a road across the peninsula in \n1864, for example, touched off a mass emigration to the south, and it appears that much, if not all, of the huge Wan Mat \nSaman Canal from Alor Setar, begun in 1885, had to be dug with paid Chinese labor despite the fact that its guiding \nspirit was the chief minister (Menteri Besar) of the Sultan. By the turn of the century at the latest, the growth of trade \nand of the Chinese population provided alternative sources of revenue that made it even less necessary to squeeze the \nMalay peasantry. Virtually all revenue collection in Kedah at this time was leased by auction to entrepreneurs who then \nendeavored to turn a profit by collecting more revenue than the rent for their monopoly or \"farm.\" Opium and gambling \nfarms were easily the most significant sources of state revenue, bringing in more than three times the revenue from \nduties on rice and paddy export.28 It was the Chinese poor and\n25.

Compare, for example, this situation with Kessler's fine analysis of politics in the east coast state of Kelantan, \nwhich shows how much of the strong opposition to the ruling party there derived not only from class issues but \nwas compounded by a lively resentment against the aristocratic families in the state capital, who had come to \ndominate the colonial bureaucracy in their own interests.

Even after independence, as we shall see, the \nstate, in fiscal terms at least, has rested rather lightly on the Malay peasantry. Here again, the rather unique pattern of \ndevelopment in Malaysia largely avoided the familiar and often brutal struggle in most agrarian kingdoms between a \nstate voracious for corvée and taxes and a peasantry fighting to keep its subsistence intact. Even today the fiscal basis of \nthe Malaysian state reposes on export-import taxes, excise taxes, concessions and loans, and commercial levies far more \nthan on any direct appropriation from rice producers. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that the modern Malaysian \nstate depends on paddy growers for food supply and political stability, but not for its financial wherewithal, which is \nextracted in ways that only marginally affect peasant incomes. Hostility, suspicion, and resentment toward the state are \nhardly absent, but these attitudes lack the long history of direct oppression that they have taken on elsewhere in \nSoutheast Asia.\nBy 1970, the rural population in the Muda region had reached well over half a million, the vast majority of whom were \nMalays engaged almost exclusively in rice growing. The much smaller urban population (112,000) was scattered \nthrough nineteen townships in which Chinese and Malays were represented in nearly equal proportions. Well before \ndouble-cropping, Kedah politicians were fond of referring to their state as Malaysia's \"rice bowl,\" inasmuch as it has by \nfar the largest paddy acreage of any state in the country and has consistently been the major supplier to the domestic \nmarket.29 Much of its commercial importance in the paddy sector is due to its traditionally high yields per acre and its \ncomparatively large farm size, which have combined to produce a large marketable surplus above subsistence needs. \nFarm incomes, though low compared with those outside the paddy sector, were traditionally well above the norm for \npaddy farmers as a whole on the peninsula. To pursue a comment made earlier, if one had to be a paddy farmer \nsomewhere in Malaysia, one could not do much better than on the Kedah Plain.\nThe rather favorable ecological and social conditions in the Muda area make it apparent that it has hardly been singled \nout as a promising site for the more dramatic forms of class conflict. Here one finds poverty but not great misery, \ninequalities but not stark polarization, burdensome rents and taxes but not crushing exactions.

One advantage of studying class conflict in such a setting is precisely that it is something of a hard case. If we \nencounter a rich domain of class-based resistance even in a region where a majority of the rural population is probably \nbetter off than it was a decade ago, then it is reasonable to suppose that the unwritten history of resistance in other rice-\ngrowing areas of Southeast Asia might be correspondingly richer.\nDespite the blessings of good soil, a favorable climate, and relative prosperity, other aspects of the social structure and \neconomy of the Kedah Plain were troubling. If the soil was suitable for paddy, it was not suitable for much else and the \nresult was an increasing pattern of monoculture, with its attendant vulnerabilities. If the average farm size was \nsubstantial (4.0 acres, or 5.6 relong), most of the region's farmers worked smaller plots, which left them well below the \npoverty line and provoked an annual stream of migrants to towns and plantations where work was available during the \noff-season. If yields were above average, so was the rate of tenancy (35 percent), which meant that many farmers had \nonly a tenuous hold on the means of their subsistence.30 If nearly half of the paddy households owned the land they \nworked, their numbers had been steadily diminishing over the past six decades as the cycle of debt and crop failures \npried the land from many hands.31\nThe Muda Irrigation Project, begun in 1966 and in full operation by 1973, was intended to solve some, if not all, of \nthese problems. Basically, it consisted of two large dams, headworks, main and secondary canals, together with the \ninstitutional infrastructure to make possible the double-cropping of rice on some 260,000 acres. As elsewhere, the \n\"green revolution\" in Muda was coupled with the introduction of new fast-growing, high-yielding strains of rice, \nintensified fertilizer use, new technology and mechanization, credit facilities, and new milling and marketing channels. \nNearly all the official principals involvedthe\n30.

Selvadurai, Padi Farming in West Malaysia, Bulletin No. 27 (Kuala \nLumpur: Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 1972).\n31. The inequities in landholding and hence the poverty of a large section of the Muda population, which the \nirrigation scheme was intended to address, were the historical deposit of initial land grabbing compounded by this \ncycle of debt.

A number of major studies \ndocumented that success in terms of production, technology, employment, and incomes.33 From the vantage point of \n1980, the evaluation of the project, especially in terms of employment and income, is far less clear-cut, although there is \nno doubt that without the project the Muda peasantry would be far worse off both relatively and absolutely.\nWhat follows is essentially an attempt to establish the nature and degree of the major shifts in land tenure, employment, \nincome, and institutions that have been brought about, directly or indirectly, by the ''green revolution\" in Muda. These \nchanges can, and have been, documented. Once the basic contours have been sketched, they can serve as the raw \nmaterial with which the human agents in this small drama must somehow come to grips.\nMany of the dramatic changes in the Muda region since double-cropping began in 1970 are visually apparent to anyone \nfamiliar with rural Kedah earlier. Quite a few of these changes are attributable not to double-cropping but to the \ngovernment's concerted political effort to supply amenities to rural Malaysmosques, prayer houses, electricity, roads, \nschools, clinics. Others stem more directly from the increases in average incomes that double-cropping has made \npossible. Once sleepy crossroads towns now bristle with new shops and crowded\n32.

They can in fact be described as beneficial absences, as catastrophic events that were once common and \nare now rare. Before double-cropping, for example, one-third of the farm households in the region rarely grew enough \nrice for the annual subsistence needs of the family. If they were unable to earn the cash necessary to purchase rice on the \nmarket, they were reduced to subsisting on tapioca, maize, and cassava (ubi kayu) at least until the next harvest was in. \nFollowing a crop disaster in the regionand there were many (1919, 1921, 1925, 1929, 1930, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1959, \n1964)most of the rural population found itself in the same boat. Double-cropping in this respect has been a great boon. \nEven smallholding tenants with a single relong (.71 acre) can now grow enough rice at least to feed a family, though \nthey may be desperately short of cash. It is a rare peasant these days who does not eat rice twice a day.38 The provision \nof irrigation water and the use of fertilizer not only raised yields somewhat but has also made those yields more reliable, \nseason by season. The new agricultural regime is hardly invulnerable, as witnessed by the cancellation of the irrigated \nseason in 1978\n34. For quantitative details showing the scheme's effect on the regional economy, see Bell et al., Evaluation of \nProjects; chap. 7.\n35. The number of motorcycles registered in Kedah and Perlis jumped from 14,292 in 1966 to 95,728 in 1976, an \nincrease of more than sixfold. In the same period the number of private cars grew more than fourfold, buses nearly \nfourfold, and commercial vehicles nearly threefold.

Ibid., 2: table 21.\n38. A strong case can be made, however, that this benefit has come at a considerable cost in nutritional diversity. \nDouble-cropping has eliminated many of the vegetables that were previously planted between seasons. Small \nlivestock such as ducks, geese, and chickens are also rarer now that off-season grazing is cut short and now that \npesticides threaten waterfowl. Rice-paddy fish, once a poor man's staple, are both less plentiful and often \ncontaminated with pesticides. For those who can afford to buy vegetables, fish, and occasionally meat from the \nmarket, the effect is negligible. For those of slender means, however, the effect is likely to be a diet that is at best \nmonotonous and at worst nutritionally deficient and/or toxic.\n  \n< previous page\npage_66\nnext page >\n",

Nevertheless, the prospect \nof going without rice has been largely removed from the fears of even poor villagers.\nThe closely related scourge of malnutrition and its inevitable toll in human, especially children's, lives appears from \nsketchy data to have been sharply reduced, though not eliminated. Figures for the incidence of nutrition-related diseases \nand for infant and toddler mortality from such causes show a marked decline that correlates well with the progress of \ndouble-cropping.39 Between 1970 and 1976 the rate of infant mortality in the Muda region was cut by nearly half, from \na figure that was above the rates for the nation and for Kedah as a whole to a level below both. It is ironic testimony to \n\"progress\" on the rice plain that anemia and malnutrition, the seventh most common cause of death in 1970, had \ndisappeared from the top ten by 1976, while motor vehicle accidents had moved from sixth to second place.\nAnother beneficial absence that can be largely attributed to double-cropping was the decline in out-migration during the \noff-season. Both temporary and permanent migration were systematic features of the regional economy before 1970. \nThis was reflected in the fact that the population within Muda grew at only half the rate of natural increase, and the rates \nof out-migration seemed to be highest in the paddy districts.40 It was, moreover, a rare smallholder or tenant family that \ndid not have to send someone out, at least temporarily, to raid the cash economy between rice seasons. The beginning of \ndouble-cropping in Muda brought temporary relief and fostered a process that might be called \"repeasantization.\" Many \nvillagers, for the first time, were afforded the luxury of remaining at home the entire year. Small farms that were \ninadequate for subsistence with only a single crop now became viable enterprises. It was not just a matter of reaping two \nharvests from the same plot but also the opportunities for wage labor that two seasons provided. Adding to the good \nfortune of wage laborers were the restriction of Thai migrant laborers in 1969 and a tobacco boom in the poor, labor-\nexporting state of Kelantan, which reduced dramatically the competition for employment. As we shall see, however, this \nwelcome respite was only temporary. Combine-harvesters had by 1978 eliminated much of the new work that irrigation \nhad made possible and laborers from the land-poor classes in Muda were once again on the road.\n39. Ajit Singh, \"Laporan Kesihatan Kawasan Kedah-Perlis, 19701977\" (Alor Setar: Jabatan Pengarah \nPerkhidmatan Perubatan dan Kesihatan, October 1978, mimeo). These figures are not decisive because only \nthree districts are examined, one of which is the district of Kota Setar, the location of the major urban area in \nthe region. The declines in nutritionally related mortality are far more striking for Kota Setar than for either \nKubang Pasu or for Yan (the district in which Sedaka is located).\n40. Economic Consultants Ltd.

Two harvests, steadier yields, and paddy prices that no longer fluctuated wildly over the crop season served in \nmost cases to break the cycle of indebtedness which, following a bad season, might mean the loss of land to creditors. \nSeasonal credit from shopkeepers and pawnbrokers is still the rule for much of the Muda peasantry, but such loans are \ntypically cleared with each harvest and only rarely take the form of jual janji, which jeopardizes future ownership. The \neffect has been to stabilize the class of smallholders and to slow the process of proletarianization in the countryside.41\nThe changes noted thus farin amenities, consumer goods, rice supply, nutrition, employment, and household \nsolvencymight be appropriately termed the good news of the past decade in Muda. There is, however, other news \ntoonews that can only be termed ambiguous, inasmuch as its evaluation depends a great deal on one's class position. \nHere again, the effort is to convey merely the basic documented facts, leaving the social interpretation to chapter 5. In \ndealing with the entire Muda region, resort to some statistical presentation should be helpful before we move to the \nvillage level (\"foreground\"), where such data acquire flesh and blood.\nLand Ownership\nThe first fact that one would wish to know about any agrarian setting is how the ownership of the principal means of \nproductionlandis distributed.42 In Muda the land is distributed quite unequally (Gini coefficient of 0.538), although this \nis not a latifundia situation where a few massive holdings dominate most of the landscape. There is, furthermore, no \nevidence that the distribution\n41. No precise figures are available but, as we shall see below, the statistics on the distribution of paddy-land \nownership from 1966 to 1976 suggest the survival, if not the proliferation, of smallholding. Such holdings, \nhowever, are also produced by the fragmentation of ownership through inheritance.\n42. Data in this section and in those immediately following are derived largely from the superb, detailed report by \nD. S. Gibbons, Lim Teck Ghee, G. B. Elliston, and Shukur Kassim, Hak Milik Tanah di Kawasan Perairan Muda: \nLapuran Akhir (Land tenure in the Muda irrigatiaon area: Final report), Pt. 2, Findings (Pulau Pinang: Pusat \nPenyelidekan Dasar and Universiti Sains Malaysia, 1981). It will be cited henceforth as USM-MADA Land Tenure \nStudy. It is based on a 197576 survey of all farms in the Muda region. Comparisons are drawn with previous \nsample surveys in the Muda region to reach conclusions about shifts in land tenure over time. For my purposes it \nhas only two disadvantages: it provides no information beyond 1976, and the scope of the inquiry is limited to \nquestions of land ownership, farm size, and tenure. Thus, for data since 1976 and for issues not covered in this \nstudy, I have had to rely on other sources that are less comprehensive. The care with which the basic data in this \nreport were collected, checked, and interpreted make it a model for emulation elsewhere.\n  \n< previous page\npage_68\nnext page >\n",

The basic \nsituation is summarized in table 3.1.43 It must be kept in mind that the figures in table 3.1 cover only owners of paddy land and \ntherefore exclude nearly 14,600 pure tenant and 8,000 landless labor households (37 percent of paddy sector households). Even \nthen, the disparity is striking. Large holdings above 7 acres (10 relong) account for only 11 percent of the holdings but occupy \n42 percent of the total paddy land. It is this strata of relatively well-to-do owners who, together with some large-scale tenants, \nfrom the core of the commercial farming class in Muda, selling perhaps three-quarters of all the paddy marketed in the \nregion.44 At the other end of the scale stand the great majority (61.8 percent) of owners with holdings below what is required \nfor a poverty-line income. Fully 40 percent, in fact, own less than 1.42 acres (half the paddy land necessary for a subsistence-\nlevel income) and are insignificant as sellers of paddy.\nTable 3.1 · Size Distribution of Paddy-Land Holdings, Muda Irrigation Scheme, 19751976\nSize \nClass \n(Acres)\nHoldings: \nAbsolute \nFrequency \n(No. farm owners)\nHoldings: \nRelative \nFrequency \n(%)\nArea: \nAbsolute \nFrequency \n(Acres)\nArea: \nRelative \nFrequency (%)\n0.012.83\n27,898\n61.8\n32,198\n21.7\n2.847.09\n12,198\n27.1\n54,028\n36.3\n7.1 and above\n5,019\n11.1\n62,499\n42.0\nTotals\n45,115\n100.0\n148,725\n100.0\n \nAlong with double-cropping has come a roughly fivefold leap in paddy-land prices, far outdistancing the rise of the consumer \nprice index or paddy incomes and fraught with implications for future social mobility.

Thus 0.01 to 2.83 \nacres is equivalent to 0.01 to 3.9 relong; 2.84 to 7.09 acres is equivalent to 4.0 to 9.9 relong; and above 7.1 acres is \nequivalent to 10 relong and above.\n44.

A traditional, if limited, avenue of upward mobility has been all but definitely closed.\nFarm Size\nThe distribution of operated farm size is a good indication of access (whether by ownership or rental) to the primary factor of \nproduction. Comparative figures for before and after double-cropping are given in table 3.2.45 Inequalities in actual farm size, while \nnot as marked as in the case of ownership, are nonetheless apparent. Small farms, nearly half of Muda's households, cultivate a mere \n17 percent of the paddy land, but large farms, only 14 percent of households, claim virtually 40 percent of the rice land. Between \nthese two classes is a large middle peasantry cultivating modest farms. The most striking trend in the past decade is the growth in the \nproportion of small farms coupled with no appreciable change in their share of land resources, such that the mean small farm size has \nbeen driven down to a historic low of 1.4 acres.\nTable 3.2 · Size Distribution of Farms, 1966 and 197576\nFarm-Size Class \n(Acres)\n1966\n19751976\n% \nFarms\n% \nArea\nMean Farm \nSize (Acres)\n% \nFarms\n% \nArea\nMean Farm \nSize (Acres)\n<2.83\n38.1\n17.3\n1.8\n46.7\n17.0\n1.4\n2.847.09\n46.4\n44.9\n3.8\n38.9\n43.2\n4.5\n>7.1\n15.3\n37.8\n9.9\n14.6\n39.8\n10.9\n \nTenure\nIt is above all in the social arrangements for cultivation that the most dramatic transformations have taken place. Land tenure in \nMuda is both complex and flexible: It is not uncommon, for example, to encounter farmers who farm some of their own land, rent \nout a small plot, rent in another, and even harvest others' land for wages occasionally. Nevertheless it is possible to identify three \nmajor tenure categories: owner-operators who farm their own land, pure tenants who rent all the paddy land they cultivate, and \nowner-tenants who farm land that is both rented and owned.46 The precipitous decline in the proportion of pure tenants is the most \nstriking feature of land tenure patterns since 1966, as shown in Table 3.3. There is some evidence that this trend was observable even \nbefore double-cropping, but there is no doubt that it has accelerated greatly since\n45.USM-MADA Land Tenure Study, 167.\n46.

The evidence suggests that we are witnessing the not-so-gradual liquidation \nof Muda's pure tenant class. The overall picture from farm size and tenure data is one of gradual polarizationan increase in the \nproportion of small farms (mostly owner-operated) that produce a bare subsistence income, an across-the-board decline in tenancy, \nand a growing class of larger-scale commercial farms. This is very much in keeping with the results of the green revolution \nelsewhere in monsoon Asia.48\nThe explanation for these structural changes, which have produced a numerous, marginal poverty-sharing class of small farmers at \nthe bottom of the heap, a robust class of capitalist farmers at the top, and a still significant middle peasantry in between, is complex. \nDouble-cropping, higher yields, and mechanization have made it increasingly profitable and feasible for landlords to resume \ncultivation. This would help account for the displacement of tenants and the growing share of owner-operators in both small and \nlarge farm categories. Demography has also played a role. Despite steady out-migration from Muda, the population grew by nearly \n30 percent between 1957 and 1976. In the decade ending in 1980, Muda's population grew by more than 18 percent to 539,000. \nGiven the nearly static area of paddy land over this period, population growth has encouraged owners to take back tenanted land for \ntheir children and to divide among their heirs land they previously farmed alone. This would also help account for the proliferation \nof small farms and the dismissal of tenants.\n47. Ibid., 167, gives comparable figures for 1955 and for 197273 as well. It is not clear exactly what happened to these ex-\ntenants. Some have undoubtedly become landless laborers in the village, while others, particularly if young, have \nemigrated temporarily or permanently to urban areas for work. A small proportion have perhaps been tenants who have \nretired from active farming and who have then not been replaced.\n48. See Keith Griffin, The Political Economy of Agrarian Change: An Essay on the Green Revolution (Cambridge, Mass.: \nHarvard Univ. Press, 1974), chap. 3. The one exception is that, while the green revolution has occasionally resulted in the near \nliquidation of small owner-operators, this class has more than held its own in Muda despite the fact that it is increasingly \nmarginalized in economic terms.\n  \n< previous page\npage_71\nnext page >\n",

More important, changes in technology, costs of production, and rice prices since 1976 provide \nfurther incentives to displace small tenants. Combine-harvesters, by reducing supervision costs and by gathering the off-\nseason harvest quickly, favor owner cultivation of larger farms. The provision of free fertilizer since the off-season of \n1979 and a 30 percent increase in the farm-gate paddy price in late 1980 have also, given the \"stickiness\" of rents in \nMuda,49 made self-cultivation more attractive than ever. What recent evidence is available supports this contention.50\nTwo other notable changes have taken place in the form of tenancy since 1966, both of which tend to favor large-scale \ntenants with capitalin particular, owner-tenantsat the expense of small-scale tenants. The first concerns when and how \nthe rent is paid each season. In 1955 more than three-quarters of Muda's tenants paid their rents after the harvest was in \nand paid that rent in the form of a fixed quantity of paddy51 or its cash equivalent. Cash rents (sewa\n49. A majority of tenants in Muda are related to their landlord and rent land at prices below market rates. See \nthe fine case study by Mohd. Shadli Abdullah, \"The Relationship of the Kinship System to Land Tenure: A \nCase Study of Kampung Gelung Rambai, Kedah\" (Master's thesis, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 1978), and the \nremarkable analysis of the same phenomenon elsewhere in Malaysia by Akimi Fujimoto, \"Land Tenure, Rice \nProduction, and Income Sharing among Malay Peasants: Study of Four Villages\" (Ph.D. diss., Flinders \nUniversity, Australia, 1980). Paradoxically, it is easier to withdraw the land from related tenants in order to \nfarm it oneselfvillagers accept that the owner and his children take precedence over more distant relativesthan \nto raise rents that kin must pay. This explains why landlords cannot simply take advantage of land hunger and \nhigher returns from cultivation by extracting the full economic rent from tenants who are close relatives.\n50. A recent restudy of a village near Alor Setar by Rosemary Barnard notes the importance of combine-harvesters \nin influencing landlords to rent out less land. \"Recent Developments in Agricultural Employment in a Kedah Rice-\nGrowing Village\" (Paper presented at the Second Colloquium of the Asian Studies Association of Australia, James \nCook University, August 29-31, 1979), 30. Increasing displacement of tenants is also noted by the head of the \nagricultural division of the Muda Agricultural Development Authority, Afifuddin Haji Omar, in \"The Pivotal Role \nof an Integrated Institutional Reform in Socioeconomic Development of Rice Peasantry in Malaysia\" (Paper \npresented at Conference on Development: The Peasantry and Development in the ASEAN Region, University \nKebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, May 2629, 1980), 12.\n51. For the statistics on paddy rents and cash rents from 1955 to 1976, see USM-MADA Land Tenure Study, 66. \nThe term \"paddy rent\" (sewa padi) is always treated by studies as if it was actually paid in kind. It is my \nexperience, however, that it has come to mean only that the rent is fixed in terms of the market price of a \npredetermined amount of paddy, which is usually given to the landlord in cash. It should also be noted that paddy \nrents were not crop-sharing arrangements, as the paddy rent was a fixed amount of grain, not a fixed share of the \ncrop, which would have fluctuated with the harvest.\n  \n< previous page\npage_72\nnext page >\n",

By 1966 \ncash rents had become nearly as common as paddy rents, and by 1975 three-fourths of all tenancies were for cash rents, \na reversal of the pattern twenty years earlier. While paddy rents may be paid out of the proceeds of the harvest and were \ntherefore often negotiable depending on the size of the crop, cash rents require that the tenant raise the capital before the \nseason opens and are not negotiable. At the moment the landlord moves to cash rent, the tenant is therefore subject to a \none-time-only double rent, one for the past season and one for the coming season. No study has ever been made of the \nconsequences of this shift, but there is no doubt that a good many poor tenants who were unable to raise the cash \nrequired were replaced by those who could.52 Except for land rented from parents by children, most tenancy in Muda \nhas now become pure rentier tenancy in which all the risks of cultivation are borne exclusively by the cultivator, who \npays an invariable cash rent before the season opens.\nA more momentous shift in tenancy relations is the increasing resort to pajak, or leasehold, tenancy in recent years. \nPajak tenancy is the long-term rental of land over at least two seasons and may in fact extend to as many as ten or \ntwelve seasons. The entire rent is paid in a lump sum and is in most cases covered by a written, notarized contract. As a \nform of tenancy, pajak has existed for a long time and was often a means by which farmers of modest means raised a \nsubstantial sum for such purposes as an important marriage, a new house, a pilgrimage to Mecca, or paying off an \noutstanding debt. The pressing need of the family renting out the land was usually reflected in rental rates that worked \nout to be well below the current market rents for seasonal tenancy. Now, however, pajak tenancy is increasingly at, or \nabove,53 market rents and is often resorted to by wealthy landowners seeking to raise cash for investment purposes.\nFor the landowner, leasehold rental has the advantage over jual janji that ownership of the land is retained even though \nuse rights may be transferred for many years. For the small tenant, however, the effect is to price him out of the land \nrental market. A typical pajak contract (in 1979) involving, say, only 3 relong for six seasons (three years) would \nrequire raising anywhere from M$2,700 to M$4,000 in advance. As this represents two to three times the mean income \nof Muda peasants, it is far beyond the reach of the vast majority\n52. The only figures I have are for Sedaka, where something like one in seven tenants may have been \ndisplaced, but it would be hazardous to project similar rates for all of Muda.\n53. The authors of the USM-MADA Land Tenure Study found, to their surprise, that pajak rents worked out to M\n$122.74 for the main season as compared with M$112.49 for cash renting season by season. One interpretation \nthey offer is that such leases \"are highly commercial transactions struck up between landlords who are sensitive to \nmarket conditions of rent and well-to-do tenants (possibly including non-Malays who experience more difficulty \nin obtaining land and are anxious to obtain some degree of security of tenure).\" P. 72.\n  \n< previous page\npage_73\nnext page >\n",

Leasehold tenants are increasingly drawn from the ranks of the wealthy Malay \nlandowners and Chinese businessmen armed with capital and machinery (tractors, combine-harvesters) and looking for \nprofitable investment opportunities. They are willing to pay premium rents and prefer to rent large tracts of paddy land. \nWhat is emerging, then, is a rich, fully commercial tenant class whose entry into the rental market serves to displace \nsmall, capital-poor tenants.\nHow much of the diminution of the tenant class before 1976 was due to the replacement of many small tenants by their \ncapitalist competitors is impossible to estimate. What is clear, however, is that since 1976 there has been a marked \nacceleration of large-scale, long-term leasehold tenancy. Very few of the village studies conducted since then have \nfailed to note its growing use or to express alarm at the likely consequences for the poor peasantry in the Muda region.54\nMechanization\nGrowing wet rice under traditional conditions can absorb an astounding amount of labor. Most of this labor is devoted \nto the four main stages of cultivation: land preparation, transplanting, reaping, and threshing. If hired labor is used, it is \nlargely confined to these four operations, since other activities such as weeding or repairing bunds can be spread out \nconveniently and accomplished with family labor. Land-poor peasant households in Muda typically relied on just such \nwage labor opportunities to patch together their meager subsistence. The introduction of tractors for land preparation \nand combine-harvesters for reaping and threshing has thus effectively eliminated most of those opportunities;\n54. Mohd. Shadli Abdullah, for example, found that in Gelung Rambal village nearly one-third of the tenancy \nagreements took the form of pajak leasehold, \"Relationship of the Kinship System,\" 110. Diana Wong, in a \nsubsequent study of the same village, writes that \"An even more disturbing trend is the increasing shift to \npajak.\" \"A Padi Village in North Malaya\" (1980, mimeo.), 18. Jon R. V. Daane, in his analysis of farmers' \norganizations, noted that pajak was increasingly used by even poor landlords to raise cash while avoiding the \nnumerous claims of relatives who wished to rent land from them cheaply. See Farmers and Farmers \nOrganizations: A Study of Changing Resource Use Patterns in the Muda Area, Preliminary Report No. 2 \n(August 1978, mimeo.). Afifuddin Haji Omar has also noted with alarm the tendency of syndicates that own \ncombine-harvesters to lease in large plots at premium rents. \"Pivotal Role,\" 12. In Province Wellesley, a \nhighly commercialized rice-growing area to the south of Kedah, Fujimoto has found that 24 percent of all \nrental contracts are leasehold tenancies. ''Land Tenure,\" 80. The only exception is Rosemary Barnard's restudy \nof Kampung Asam Riang, in which pajak seems to have disappeared in the past decade. \"The Modernization \nof Agriculture in a Kedah Village, 19671968\" (Paper presented at Second National Conference of the Asian \nStudies Association of Australia, University of New South Wales, Sydney, May 1519, 1978, mimeo.), 1920.\n  \n< previous page\npage_74\nnext page >\n",

Most of the paddy land in Muda was ploughed by tractors before 1970, but speed in ploughing \nbecame vital if double-cropping was to take place. Thus, initially at least, tractors facilitated double-cropping, which in \nturn doubled the annual wage work in transplanting, reaping, and harvesting. Because tractors helped to create far more \nemployment than they destroyed, their introduction caused no concern at the time.55\nCombine-harvesters were a different matter. In 1975, virtually all the paddy in Muda was cut and threshed by hand. By \n1980, huge Western-style combines costing nearly M$200,000 and owned by syndicates of businessmen were \nharvesting roughly 80 percent of the rice crop. If it is hard to imagine the visual impact on the peasantry of this mind-\nboggling technological leap from sickles and threshing tubs to clanking behemoths with thirty-two-foot cutting bars,56 \nit is not so hard to calculate their impact on the distribution of rural income.\nThe consequences for income of combine-harvesting are especially applicable to households farming less than 2.8 acres \n(over 46 percent of Muda's families) and wage laborers (7 percent). The former depended on paddy wage labor for at \nleast one-fourth of their net income, while the latter were often totally dependent on it. Calculations based on the share \nof cutting (usually women's work) and threshing (usually men's work) in total hired labor and the intensity of combine-\nharvester use suggest that the combines have cut paddy wage labor receipts by 44 percent.57 For the poorest class of \nsmall farmers, this represents a 15 percent\n55. It is instructive, however, to note the shift in income transfers that the use of tractors prompted. Before \ntheir use, large operators would often hire modest local farmers with water buffalo to plough (menggembur) \nand to harrow (menyisir) their land. The effect was mildly redistributive. With the use of tractors, the \npayments are typically made to outside businessmen and rich farmers who own this expensive item of capital.\n56. Alas, it seems to have occurred to no one that an oral history of their appearance in the fields in 1975 would \nhave been worth collecting.\n57. Wages paid for transplanting, cutting, threshing, and in-field transportation comprise about 90 percent of the \nhired labor component in rice cultivation in Muda. Of that, cutting and threshing, which are carried out in one \noperation by the combines, comprise abut 55 percent. Combine-harvesters also eliminate a substantial amount of \nin-field transportation by transporting paddy directly to the bunds or to the roadside. This loss, however, is more or \nless compensated for by employment created in the bagging of rice. As of 1980, combines harvested about 80 \npercent of Muda's paddy land. Assuming that this figure is likely to remain the norm, I arrive at a net loss of hired \nlabor income of 44 percent (80 percent of 55 percent). Farm income figures for 1974, before the combines were \nused, show that paddy wage labor\n(footnote continued on next page)\n  \n< previous page\npage_75\nnext page >\n",

For full-time wage \nlaborers, of course, the results are catastrophic and it is hard to imagine how they can survive as a class in the new \ncircumstances. Combine-harvesting has meant, then, a loss of nearly half the wages previously received for paddy work \nby the poorer strata of Muda's peasantry. The loss in the volume of work has by no means been compensated for by a \nrise in wage rates for the work still available.\nThe direct impact of combine-harvesting on wage income is obvious and dramatic, but in the long run the indirect \nconsequences may prove more damaging. Mechanization, by promoting large-scale farming and leaseholding, has \ngreatly reduced the opportunity for small-scale tenancy. It has also eliminated gleaning, shifted local hiring patterns, \nreduced transplanting wages, and transformed local social relations. These last changes, which are rarely captured in the \naggregate regional statistics, are best deferred to our detailed discussion of Sedaka in the next chapter.\nFrom Exploitation to Marginalization\nThe impact of double-cropping has thus far been considered as if it were largely a matter of access to land, work, and \nwages. It is well worth pausing briefly to suggest its implications for class relations as well. What the transformations \nbrought about by Muda's green revolution have done is nearly to sever the bonds of economic interdependence between \nagrarian classes. Prior to double-cropping and, to some extent, even until 1975, the land-rich class and the land-poor \nclass of Muda were joined by an exchange of work and wages, cultivation and rents which, however exploitative, fused \nthem together in the enterprise of rice farming. Rich landlords and farmers had more paddy fields than they could \ncultivate alone; they needed tenants, ploughing services, transplanters, reapers, and threshers. The land-poor and \nlandless, having more labor than property, provided these services. Because of the labor peaks typical of rice \ncultivation, it was not uncommon for employers to help secure timely labor by modest gifts and loans or, in more \ngeneral terms, to \"cultivate\" not only the land but also the poorer villagers whom they needed to make the land \nprofitable.\nWith mechanization, tenancy became an expensive luxury. Those tenants who remained, aside from close kin, were \ntypically paying fixed market rents with\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nincome for small farm households (below 2.84 acres) was approximately M$350 per annum. A loss of 44 \npercent of that income would reduce it to M$196. For a tenant in this category, the loss in total net income is \n15 percent; for an owner-operator, the loss is 11 percent. For a wage laborer the loss is far larger. As these \nclasses comprise the more than half of Muda's population that lives below the official poverty line, the income \nconsequences are grave. For a careful case study of the wage impact of combine-harvesting, see \"MADA-\nTARC Farm Management Studies, 1980,\" 4754.\n  \n< previous page\npage_76\nnext page >\n",

More important, cultivation \ncould now be undertaken largely independent of village labor. Except for transplanting and for those occasions when a \nplot that ripened early or lodged (was beaten flat by wind and/or rain) had to be harvested by hand, large farmers simply \nhad little need to hire poor villagers. Thus, they had correspondingly little incentive to cultivate their goodwill. The \nlinkage between classes has by no means totally disappeared, but there is little doubt that it is far more constricted than \nit was and that all indications point toward its eventual demise. If poor villagers were earlier tied to their richer \nemployers by bonds of interdependence and exploitation, they now find themselves cut adrift and marginalized. If they \nare no longer exploited, if they are now \"free,\" this is the freedom of the unemployed, the redundant.\nIncome\nThe effect of the Muda Irrigation Scheme on incomes and on the distribution of those incomes throughout the region is \nbest examined in two phases: an initial phase from 1966 to 1974 and a subsequent phase from 1974 to 1979. The basic, \nsummary figures are shown in table 3.4, covering five tenure categories of farmers that are most common in Muda. \nThey are, as all averages must be, abstractions hiding an enormous variation of circumstances and conditions in order to \ncreate some measure of central tendency. Whenever judgments were necessary, they were made so as to avoid \nunderstating the income of small farmers.58\nThe initial impact of double-cropping in Muda was to raise incomes on a broad front in both nominal and real terms. \nThis gain, however, was at the expense of a much worse distribution of that income.59 Owner-tenants, the\n58. For example, there is good reason to believe that gross paddy income may be overstated by as much as 20 \npercent because of differences between crop-cutting surveys and actual yields as well as reductions in sale \nprice made for moisture content. \"Other income\" for most farmers is almost certainly overstated as well since \nthe averages are inflated by a few farmers with steady off-farm salaries or wages. The picture given here is \nperhaps even more optimistic than a more complete account would allow.\n59. Virtually all of the major studies in Muda concur with this conclusion. Thus the authors of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization/World Bank Cooperative Program report, Muda Study, write, \"This increase in income at \nthe farm level, however, has not been evenly distributed across the already unequal pattern of income distribution \nand has, therefore, served to worsen that distribution\" 1:2.

The incomes of average tenants and average owner-operators grew by 72 and 89 percent respectively. By \ncontrast, the gains of small tenants and owners (nearly half of Muda's farm households) were far more modest: 35 \npercent and 51 percent. Even the percentages are misleading here, given the different base incomes, for while the typical \nowner-tenant gained M$2,577 in real income, the average small tenant gained only M$335: a ratio of 8 to 1. Both the \ngains in income and their maldistribution, it should be added, were not due solely to the production effects of double-\ncroppings. They were due as much to the doubling of farm-gate paddy prices in the worldwide economic crisis and \ninflation of 197374.60\nThe five-year period from late 1974 to 1979 was, by contrast, one of declining nominal and real income for all \ncategories of farmers.61 Losses for average tenants and small owners meant that, at the end of the period, they were less \nthan 20 percent ahead of their 1966 real incomes. Small tenants suffered most dramatically, as their real incomes were, \nif anything, below what they had been thirteen years before. Only owner-tenants and owner-operators remained \nsubstantially ahead of their 1966 real incomes.\nThe causes of this retreat across a broad front may be traced to three factors. First, the earlier increase in production \nbrought about by double-cropping had leveled off and yields remained stagnant throughout this period. Second, paddy \nprices after 1974 were steady for the next five years.62 The cost of inputs to farmers, on the other hand, continued to \nrise as did the consumer price index (up 22 percent), thereby eroding the real incomes of all tenure categories. There\n60. For a superb and meticulous analysis of the relative impact of production and prices in this period, see \nJegatheesan, Green Revolution, 3150.\n61. As Jegatheesan notes, \"Such estimates (i.e. yields, farm size, tenure, cost of production, paddy price) have \nalways to be treated with care in the actual quantitative assessments of net income, but have as yet never been \nproven wrong in showing a continuing decline in average net farm incomes in Muda since 1975 owing to \nrelatively static yields, a stable padi price, and rising production costs.\" \"Monitoring and Evaluation in the Muda \nIrrigation Scheme, Malaysia'\" (n.d., circa 1979, mimeo.), 39. Bell et al., Evaluation of Projects, on a related issue, \nhave estimated the capital flow out of the Muda region following gains in production and reached pessimistic \nconclusions about the possibility for self-sustaining regional growth. \"The conclusion that the project's effects \nwere of a once-and-for-all kind seem to us virtually inescapable.\" Chap. 9, p. 35.\n62. In 1981, after my research was completed, the government raised the paddy price by roughly one-third. The \neffect of this change by itself would have been to restore average real incomes to their 1974 level or slightly \nabove. Income distribution would, however, have become even worse. The increase in the official support price \nwas most certainly motivated in part by the farmers' demonstrations for a price hike held in January 1980 in Alor \nSetar.\n  \n< previous page\npage_79\nnext page >\n",

All the disparities, it is clear, \nwere essentially generated in the first stage of double-cropping. Ironically, the second stage arrested (but did not \nreverse) these new inequities, although at the cost of lower real incomes all around. Small tenants who had half the \nincome of owner-tenants in 1966 now have roughly one-quarter of their income. To put it more accurately, those tenants \nwho are lucky enough still to be tenants have slid to about one-fourth the income of owner-tenants. Small owner-\noperators, even more numerous, had over half the income of owner-tenants thirteen years ago and now have roughly \none-third that income. The declining position of Muda's small peasants is the result of their small farm size and of the \ndirect and indirect effects of an irrigation scheme that disproportionately rewards the owners of scarce factors of \nproduction. They were poor to begin with; they remain poor; and they have grown relatively poorer. There is no need, \non the basis of this data, to question the general assessment of the green revolution by Keith Griffin that \"the changes \nwhich are at present occurring tend to increase relative inequality.\"63\nTable 3.5 · Income Comparisons between Tenure Categories 1966, 1974, 1979\n1966\n1974\n1979\nI.

Taking 1966 as a point of comparison, it is still the case that a majority of Muda's households are more \nprosperous than before. It is also the case that the distribution of income has worsened appreciably and that a substantial \nminorityperhaps 3540 percenthave been left behind with very low incomes which, if they are not worse than a decade \nago, are not appreciably better.

Thus it is that the \nhuman misery known as poverty is signified by numbersa certain amount of cash per household, a certain number of \ncalories ingested each day. While we shall have ample occasion later to explore the meaning of povertyhow it is \nexperienced and understoodthe gross numerical description of poverty does provide something of a baseline from which \nto begin.\nThe figures presented in table 3.6 are based on the official poverty-line income and show how the income of various \ntenure groups has changed since 1966 in relation to that standard.\nThe remarkable and sobering fact is that much of the gain made between 1966 and 1974 had been largely undone by \n1979. Not even the initial boom in prices and production had raised small farmers, whether owners or tenants, above the \npoverty line, and by 1979 they were once again far below. Average tenants and owner-operators had improved their \nincomes appreciably but many, if not most, were still below poverty-line incomes. At a bare minimum there were \n33,000 \"officially\" poor households in Muda in 1979.65 These households\n64. There is some dispute about how the poverty level has been established, with some claiming that it should \nbe set lower for rural areas where the cost of living is lower. Without pretending to judge this issue, I believe \nit is clear that there may be strong political reasons for the government to set the poverty level reasonably high \nin order to justify certain programs aimed at attracting Malay votes. Quite aside from the question of what an \nappropriate poverty level might be, it should be added that, given the official level, the estimate of 30 percent \nis quite conservative. This is the conclusion reached by the most thorough recent study of poor households in \nthe Muda region, in which households interviewed in 197273 were reinterviewed a decade later. The study \nconfirms that half or more of Muda's population is still below the official poverty line and the \"downstream\" \nemployment created by double-cropping has gone largely to wealthier households, not to those who need it \nmost. See the excellent preliminary report by Sukur Kasim, \"Evolution of Sources of Income in the Muda \nIrrigation Project (1972/731981/82)\" (Paper presented at Conference on Off-Farm Employment in the \nDevelopment of Rural Asia, Chengmai, Thailand, August 1983, mimeo.).\n65. This very conservative figure is derived by adding the number of small farm households to that of nonfarming \nwage laborers. Of course a small percentage of small farm households are in fact above the poverty line. By the \nsame token, however, a fair number of average tenants and owner-operators with farm sizes above 3 acres are \nbelow the poverty level.\n  \n< previous page\npage_81\nnext page >\n",

Far from remaining merely passive \nrecipients of services, the Farmers' Associations, both individually and collectively, have become active and vociferous \nspokesmen for the interests of paddy farmers. They have come to constitute the functional equivalent of a paddy \nproducer's lobby, which has consistently brought pressure to bear through annual resolutions, petitions, and delegations \nfor changes in policy that would benefit their membership. The competitive political atmosphere, especially in Kedah, \ncontributes to their influence, and all but one or two of the local bodies are controlled effectively by members of the \nruling party.\nNearly 40 percent of Muda's farmers have at one time or another joined a Farmers' Association, but this membership is \nby no means a cross-section of Muda's peasantry. Table 3.7 reveals just how skewed participation is. Farmers \ncultivating less than 2.84 acres (4 relong) comprise nearly half the farm population but only 12.4 percent of Farmers' \nAssociation members.

As Norman Uphoff and Milton Esman note, \"if such organizations become institutionalized, they would \nbe as instruments of the large and middle farmers, while small farmers would be thrown back on traditional \nlinks of dependency on patrons or be compelled to rely wholly on their own meagre resources.\" Local \nOrganization for Rural Development: Analysis of Asian Experience (Ithaca: Rural Development Committee, \nCornell University, 1974), 66.\n67. Originally, membership and annual subscription fees were nominal (M$3), but as members began to subscribe \nto equity shares, new members were required to purchase a block of shares equivalent in value to the amount held \nby members of long standing. It is now rare for membership to cost less than M$30 and it often runs as high as M\n$100. For small farmers, whose production credit allowance, given their acreage, might be less than M$100, this \nprovision is an effective bar to entry.\n(footnote continued on next page)\n  \n< previous page\npage_83\nnext page >\n",

Large farmers operating more than 5.7 \nacres are less than 23 percent of the farm population, yet they constitute more than 60 percent of the credit recipients \nand of course a much higher share of the actual credit extended. Small farmers, who are nearly half Muda's population, \nconstitute a mere 6 percent of those who get subsidized credit. Those who are most in need of credit on easy terms are \ndenied access, while those who could borrow from banks or finance inputs from their own savings are provided for in \nabundance. Increasing rates of delinquency in repayment, moreover, indicate that many large farmers have managed to \nturn the loans into outright subsidies.68 The accumulated bad debts have gone unprosecuted because the debtors, drawn \nlargely from the ranks of local, ruling party stalwarts, are well-nigh untouchable. To this extent, MADA, the ruling \nparty, and the Kedah state government are hostages to the interests of the relatively prosperous strata of farmers which \nthe green revolution has helped create and solidify.\nAs the economic distance between rich and poor has grown, so has this privileged class's access to influence and credit. \nIf the interests of paddy farmers are heard at all, they are increasingly the interests of larger farmers. On some questions, \nsuch as paddy support prices or fertilizer subsidies, this may make little difference, for the interests of rich and poor will \nlargely coincide. But on many other issuesmechanization, agricultural wage policy, credit eligibility, land rents, land \nreformtheir interests are sharply conflicting. The vise-like grip with which large operators now control the Farmers' \nAssociations means both that the vital interests of Muda's poor are systematically excluded even from the policy agenda \nand that those who have already profited most from the green revolution will continue to have things their own way.69\nThese facts about agricultural ''progress\" are all too familiar from analyses of the green revolution elsewhere in Asia. As \nKeith Griffin has concluded:\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nEven were they to join, the annual deduction of at least M$15 for compulsory share purchase from their credit \nallowance makes joining less attactive than the familiar alternative of credit from shopkeepers.

Here the focus is even sharper, for they are \"facts\" that have been directly experiencedfor example, changes \nin rental forms, mechanization, wages, land tenure, credit, charity. These facts are not simply the replication of the \nmiddle ground in the village context. This particular village is, as any other particular village would be, to some extent \nunique. Put another way, Sedaka has had its own special green revolution in keeping with its particular history, its \nparticular cast of characters. It is this special, local variant of the green revolution that Sedaka's villagers have helped to \nfashion and to which they are responding.\nThe village of Sedaka falls within the administrative district of Yan, which straddles the southern frontier of the Muda \nIrrigation Scheme.1 (See map 2) The small town of Yan itself, some eight miles to the south, houses the district office \ncomplex, including the local land office, police station, and a nearby clinic. It is to this town that villagers must go to \nexecute and notarize land transactions of long-term rentals as well as to pawn gold jewelry at the licensed pawn shop. If \nYan is the main focus of administrative life for Sedaka, the nearby town of Kepala Batas might be described as the main \nfocus of commercial life. Villagers buy most of their food and provisions at its shops and at its twice-weekly rotating \nmarket on Wednesday and Sunday. It is also the center for credit and marketing, whether through the Chinese \nshopkeepers who extend loans and buy paddy or through the Farmers' Association and the local branch of the Paddy \nMarketing Authority (LPN), which has a large rice-drying facility on the outskirts of town\n1. Sample data collected in 1982 indicate that the district of Yan, which was relatively poor by Muda region \nstandards before double-cropping, appears to have benefited less in the past decade than other districts. In \n1982 it had the highest proportion of poor households; more than 75 percent of Yan's households were below \nthe official poverty level. Furthermore, only one of the other four districts studied had fared as badly in \nreducing the poverty rate. More of Yan's households, by far, described themselves as \"hardup\" (susah), \ndespite the likelihood that real incomes for a majority of households in the district have improved somewhat. \nThe fact that Yan is so heavily monocultural (paddy) that man/land ratios are comparatively high and that it is \nrather isolated from urban employment may help account for its relatively lackluster performance. For details \nsee Sukur Kasim, \"Evolution of Sources of Income in the Muda Irrigation Project (1972/731981/82)\" (Paper \npresented at Conference on Off-Farm Equipment in the Development of Rural Asia, Chengmai, Thailand, \nAugust 1983, mimeo.). In this respect, Yan and Sedaka may be somewhat poorer than more representative \ndistricts within the Muda scheme.\n  \n< previous page\npage_86\nnext page >\n",

Kepala Batas is also the site of the subdistrict (Mukim Sungai Daun) chief's (penghulu) office, at which \nminor administrative matters such as the registration or sale of water buffalo are handled, and of a once-a-week \nmaternity clinic staffed by government nurses.\nThe seventy-four households of Sedaka are strung out along a nearly mile-long dirt path. (See map 3) This path leads \nfrom the all-weather road joining Yan to Kepala Batas and ending abruptly at the rice fields separating the village from \nthe neighboring settlement to the east, Sungai Bujur. Like most villages on the Muda Plain established in this century, \nthe pattern of settlement follows the linear plan of the drainage canals that originally brought the land into production. \nThis ribbon of settlement is often contrasted with the pattern of nucleated or clustered villages, where social and ritual \ncohesion is said to be greater.2 It is certainly true that villagers themselves are not quite sure where Sedaka ends and \nwhere Sungai Tongkang, the village along the main road, begins. Despite these vagaries of geography, the village is, as \nwe shall see, far more than just a collection of households in close proximity. If its boundaries are ill defined, all but a \nfew families are nevertheless quite unambiguously of Sedaka. If neighborhoods subdivide it, the prayer house (surau) as \na focus for religious life and the large feasts to which all villagers are typically invited serve to ritually unify it. \nAdministratively as well, it is usually treated as a distinct unit. When it is not, as in the case of the Farmer's Association \nuntil recently, villagers have lobbied to have Sedaka recognized as a separate branch. Above all, the moral existence of \nthe village is recognized in discourse. When the collector of the Islamic tithe (amil) explains why he does not report \nvillagers who fail to pay the full amount, he says, \"We all live in the same village.\"3 When a tenant tells me why he \nwould not try to expand his farm by outbidding another local tenant, he says, \"Everyday I see his face.\"4 And when the \nrules are broken, as they occasionally are, the culprit is shamed in precisely the same terms.\nLooking straight down the path, no houses are visiblejust the solid archway of coconut palms, banana fronds, nipah, and \nthe water hyacinths and grasses growing in the ditches alongside. Idris's store, facing the surfaced road leading north to \nKepala Batas and south to Yan Kecil, is the first building in Sedaka. Idris takes advantage of his roadside location and \nthe electricity it provides to sell drinks and cigarettes to the young men who gather there in the evenings and to offer the \nonly popsicles available locally. A little farther along is a hinged timber spanning the path, which is fastened by chain \nand lock preventing trucks from entering. This village gate is, as we shall see, an object of some controversy.\n2.

Houses interspersed with paddy fields line the \npath for the next two hundred yards; the dwellings (see photos) of the well-to-do with zinc roofs and clapboard siding \nand those of most poor with attap roofing and siding made of bamboo split and beaten flat (pelupoh). Even the condition \nof the houses is an acrimonious political issue, which we shall explore, inasmuch as the local ruling party and its \nsupporters are accused of having monopolized a government subsidy for house repair. Mansur, a landless laborer, and \nTaib, a poor smallholder, live in this stretch and their houses contrast sharply with the refurbished and repainted house \nof Shamsul, a ruling party stalwart who owns 6 relong (4.2 acres) and has a rare and covered job at the government \npaddy-drying installation nearby.\nNear the middle of the village stand the two most substantial houses in the village, each with high roofs, louvered \nshutters, and verandas. One belongs to Haji Kadir, the richest villager, and makes a stark contrast with the dilapidated \nhouses of Hamzah and Razak just beside it. The other is the house of Haji Jaafar, the village headman (ketua kempung). \nAs headman, Haji Jaafar is influential but rather retiring; his married son Daud, who lives with him, and the shopkeeper, \nBasir, are far more visibly active. Haji Jaafar prefers to emphasize his unifying role by giving an annual feast (Kenduri) \nto which the entire village is invited and by occasionally leading prayers at the village surau across the path (see photo). \nWhile there are many public gatherings in Sedaka, the surau, whose lower floor serves as a village meeting hall, \nclassroom for religious teachers, and lecture hall for sermons and political speeches, is the only designated public space \nin the community.\nThe informal gathering places, however, the places where idle chatter and gossip are exchanged, are around the tables of \nthe two small shops (see photo). Each shop carries a small inventory of daily items such as dried chillies, soap, matches, \nkerosene, tobacco, sweets, spices, tinned fish for last-minute purchase. After the day's work and during slack periods, \nmen will gather to pass the time smoking and drinking homemade soft drinks, with the circle constantly changing as \nsome arrive and others leave. Basir, the owner of the first store, is the acknowledged leader of the local ruling party \n(UMNO) branch and his shop thus serves as a gathering place for his allies. The same holds for Samat's store nearby, \nexcept that he and his father, Tok Mahmud, are staunch supporters of the opposition party and their clientele is drawn \nespecially from its ranks. A few strongly partisan villagers will, on principle, never go to the \"other\" shop, but a \nmajority claim that they go to both, being above such petty considerations.\nThe three best-known and most outspoken women live within shouting distance of the stores, farther along the path. All \nthree are, as it were, honorary men in the sense that they have all had to assume male roles and responsibilities. Rokiah \nand Rosni are both heads of transplanting groups, which requires them\n  \n< previous page\npage_89\nnext page >\n",

The third, the midwife Tok Sah Bidan, is a widow whose training and forty-odd \nyears of midwifery give her a unique place in village life.\nAt the very end of the village path stand a number of houses of poor villagers, most of whom belong to the opposition. \nMany of the most pointed criticisms and opinions I heard were expressed by Pak Yah, a landless laborer, when he was \ntalking with his equally poor brother-in-law, Mat \"halus,\" and his friend Dullah. They and the other friends and relatives \nwho occasionally joined them on the rough benches below Pak Yah's house could always be counted on for a \nperspective that broke sharply with that coming from the UMNO stalwarts at Basir's store or with that held by wealthy \nmembers (for example, Haji Kadir) of their own party.\nIn its pattern of settlement, its economy, its size, and its history, Sedaka is fairly typical of the rice-farming villages on \nthe Kedah plain. But so are hundreds of other villages, and the choice of this particular village as a place to settle and \nconduct research merits a brief explanation. The first requirement I had was a village more or less exclusively devoted \nto rice cultivation. Sedaka fits this particular perfectly. Only two heads of household are salaried; one is a truck driver \nfor the Farmers' Association, and the other examines paddy for moisture content at the local government purchasing \ncomplex. Both also farm in their spare time. There is in fact not a single household in the village that does not now or, \nin the case of aged couples, did not once grow rice. The advantage of rice monoculture is not only that it is \nrepresentative of most villages in Muda but also that the task of determining incomes and economic stratification is \nrelatively straightforward. Villages on the fringes of the irrigation scheme, by contrast, have far more mixed economies, \nwhich may include fishing, rubber smallholding, and estate work. A paddy-farming community, on the other hand, is \nrather like a fishing village with only two catches a year.\nAnother requirement was by far the most restrictive: that the village be one that had been studied before 1971, when \ndouble-cropping was introduced, so that it would be possible to establish at least the basic changes in the local \neconomy. Only three or four villages satisfied this condition. The first one I visited was Sedaka. Not only was the \nvillage headman, Haji Jaafar, hospitable to the idea of a strange family settling in his midst but it seemed possible, after \na brief talk, that a part of Haji Kadir's large house might be rented out now that his own children had grown and left \nhome. The ease with which such basic questions were resolved, together with the euphoria contributed by a remarkable \nsunset and the knowledge that the imposing beauty of Gunung Jerai (Kedah Peak) would always be visible to the south, \nwere enough to settle the matter on the spot.5\n5. I was not the first foreigner to settle in Sedaka.

They remain so today. \nThey are apparent from the most casual visual evidence of clothing, housing, food, furniture, kitchen or farm \nequipment, radios and, in a few cases now, television sets. They are, on closer inspection, produced and maintained by \nequally glaring disparities in the distribution of land ownership, of farm size, and hence of income.\nIncomes in Sedaka were highly skewed in 197879. Despite the fact that there are no comparable figures for 1967, what \nwe do know about land and farm-size distribution then suggests inequalities of a similar magnitude at the very least. \nThe present situation can be seen from table 4.1, which reports net income for each household in the village, together \nwith rice land owned and operated and the dominant occupation of the head of household. Families are ranked from \npoorest to richest on the basis of income per capita in the household. Readers may find it helpful to refer to this listing \nwhen they wish to identify the income, tenure status, major source of household income, party affiliation, and so forth \nof families who will appear and reappear throughout the text.\nUsing the standard government procedures to calculate per capita incomeby which children and adults are counted \nequallya total of forty households, or 54 percent, of village families would fall below the official poverty-line income of \n$572 per capita per year. A less stringent formula, employed in table 4.1, which counts infants below age six as only \none-third of an adult equivalent and children aged six through twelve as two-thirds, places twenty-two households, or 30 \npercent, of Sedaka's families below the poverty line. It is for these twenty-two families and the eight or ten families who \nhave incomes just above the poverty line that the problems of food and daily necessities take their most severe form. For \nthese families, an illness of a working adult, a poor yield, a decline in harvest work, an increase in rents, or the \nwithdrawal of a tenancy can easily spell disaster. Their income contrasts starkly with that of the best-off twenty-two \nfamilies in the village. The poorest twenty-two households have an average net annual income of M$2,291 while the \nrichest twenty-two households earn an average of M$6,044. The contrast is more pronounced if we consider per capita\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nbasic economic data on landholding, tenure, and social organization.

Between them, the twenty-two poorest families in Sedaka own only 22.5 relong of landan average of \nbarely 1 relong (1 relong = .71 acres). Keeping in mind that the standard for a poverty-line income from paddy farming \nalone is a minimum of 4 relong, the poorest households own scarcely one-quarter of the land required to provide for \ntheir essential needs. The wealthiest twenty-two households, on the other hand, own a total of more than 142 relong, \ngiving them an average owned holding of nearly 6.5 relong. The disparity in farm size, which includes land rented in, at \nthe two poles of the village hierarchy is actually slightly less skewed only because the land owned by many richer \nfamilies makes it unnecessary for them to rent in additional paddy acreage. Nevertheless, the poorest twenty-two \nfamilies are able to rent in only enough land to give them an average farm size of less than two relong (1.89) while the \nrichest families have an average farm size of 7.25 relong. Put another way, relatively well-to-do households actually \nmanage to rent in almost as much additional paddy land as poor families, although they need it far less.\nIn fact, the figures on land ownership, seen from a slightly different perspective, reveal far more glaring inequities. If \nwe disregard for a moment the income figures in table 4.1 and simply count the households that own no paddy land \nwhatever, thirty families (41 percent) fall in this category.6 Thus nearly half the village lacks legal control over the \nmajor productive asset in rice farming. If we take the half (thirty-seven families) of Sedaka's households who own the \nleast land, we find that they own a mere 7 relong between them. As the total rice land owned by all villagers is 235.5 \nrelong, we have a situation in which half the village owns less than 3 percent of locally owned paddy land. The ten \nbiggest village landowners, by contrast, represent only 14 percent of the households but own outright 133.75 relong, or \n47 percent of the rice land owned by villagers.\nIt is possible to compare the land ownership pattern in 1979 with the situation in 1967 and thereby assess the impact of \ndouble-cropping and new technology. There is essentially no change over the past thirteen years, that is, no change in a \ndistribution of land ownership that was, at the outset, extremely skewed. Once account is taken of the increase in the \nvillage population from fifty-six to seventy-four households, even the marginal improvement in the proportion of land \nowned by land-poor households proves to be misleading. Thus, by 1979 the land-poor half of the village was comprised \nof nine more families than in\n6. This finding places Sedaka close to the region-wide norm for the percentage of pure tenants and pure wage \nlaborers in Muda's paddy sector, which is 37 percent.

There are today more families (thirty) owning \nno paddy land in Sedaka than there were in 1967 (twenty-seven), despite the fact that the proportion of landless \nhouseholds has declined somewhat.\nThe relation between land ownership and income in this one-crop economy is obvious. Only four of the richest twenty-\ntwo families own no land. In all four cases the anomaly is accounted for by various combinations of small family size \nand outside wages and above all by the renting in of paddy land averaging more than 8 relong per household. For that \nhalf of the village with the lowest incomes, conversely, land ownership is conspicuous by its absence. Roughly 60 \npercent of these poor villagers own no land at all and only three families own more than 2 relong.\nThe distribution of ownership within the village in paddy land is unlikely to shift markedly in the near future. Higher \nand steadier yields, when coupled with the traditional Malay reluctance to part with land, has served to slow \ndramatically the process of land concentration through indebtedness. In the three decades before 1970, Haji Kadir (#74), \nnow the largest landowner in the village, managed to purchase 25 relong in eight separate transactions from \nsmallholders with insurmountable debts. Although he remains as avid for land as in the past, he has not added anything \nto his holdings since the beginning of double-cropping. Not only are the small landowners whose land he might covet \nless likely to find themselves in such dire straits, but the market for rental land is now so buoyant that a hard-pressed \nsmallholder can clear his debts more easily by renting his land out for several seasons at a time (pajak) and retain title.\nBy the same token, the marked increase in paddy-land prices has also elim-\nTable 4.2 · Distribution of Ownership of Paddy Land in Sedaka, 19671979\n1967\n1979\nTotal No. of Village Households\n56\n74\nLand-poor\nPercentage of total villager-owned paddy land held by land-poor half of village\n1%\n3%\ntotal area (relong)\n1.25\n7.00\naverage owned per household (relong)\n.04\n.19\nno. of households\n28\n37\nLand-rich\nPercentage of total villager-owned paddy land held by top 14% of village landowners\n54%\n57%\ntotal area (relong)\n114.50 133.75\naverage owned per household (relong)\n14.3\n13.3\nno. of households\n8\n10\nTotal paddy land owned by villagers (relong)\n210.25\n235.5\n \n  \n< previous page\npage_96\nnext page >\n",

Such upward mobility through land purchase was \ncertainly not common, even before double-cropping, but five villagers who now own from 3 to 7 relong had managed to \nbuy at least a portion of that land. Since 1970 not a single smallholder in this category has added to his holdings. And if \nthis category is effectively barred from purchasing land, it follows that those with less than 3 relong of their own, which \nis to say most of the village households, do not even contemplate the possibility.\nSince double-cropping began, only nine villagers have either bought or sold land. The pattern of these transactions \nreveals not only the diminished pace of land concentration but the fact that the process, if slowed, still moves in the \nsame direction. The buyers are without exception well-to-do, and the sellers are predominantly poor. Four villagers \nhave, since 1970, bought a total of 19.25 relong, much of it located outside the village. Daud, the son of the village \nheadman, Haji Jaafar (#70), has with his father's help purchased 8 relong, including 3 relong from a villager. Nor (#68) \nhas bought 8.25 relong with the help of his father (an outsider who already owns over 50 relong), all of it land at some \ndistance from the village. Amin (#73) has from his own savings purchased 2.5 relong of local land from a wealthy \nlandowning Haji in a neighboring village. Taken collectively, these three households illustrate which class in the village \nis still able to add to its holdings; they represent three of the six richest households in Sedaka. The one exception, Fadzil \n(#42), who bought 2.5 relong from another villager, is the exception that proves the rule. While he is not among the \nwealthiest ten villagers, he does own 8 relong, and his currently modest income is simply a reflection of the fact that he \nhad to lease out much of his land to raise the capital for this purchase.\nFive villagers have sold land. The two largest sales, for 5 and 10 relong respectively, were made by villagers who were \nadmitted to government settlement schemes and were liquidating their local holdings.7 All but 2.5 relong of this land \nwas sold to wealthy outsiders for premium prices. A third sale, of 3 relong, illustrates the circumstances under which \npoor families may still have to part with their land. Mat \"Halus\" 's wife (#6) was co-heir, along with at least eight other \nbrothers and sisters, of 3 relong. The heirs could not agree on a mutual division of paddy fields and after a year decided \nto sell the land and divide the proceeds. The land passed to Daud, son of Haji Jaafar, that is, from one of the poorest \nhouseholds to one of the richest. The two remaining sales were made by two poor widowed sisters, Hasnah (#15) and \nSalmah (#20), each of whom sold half a relong to a much wealthier brother living in a nearby village. Both sales were \nmade under rather exceptional circumstances; normally neither sister would\n7.

Two \nof the sellers were well-off themselves, and their selling could reasonably be seen as investment decisions. For the \nothers, however, the sales were a further step toward landlessness.\nThe inequities described in a pattern of land ownership can occasionally be mitigated by the actual pattern of tenure. \nThat is, if those with the largest holdings rent out much of their paddy land to poorer farmers, the actual distribution of \nfarm size may be more equitable than ownership statistics would imply. In the case of Sedaka, the actual distribution of \ncultivated acreage, though it is more equitable than ownership, is nevertheless highly skewed. The ten largest farms, for \nexample, which constitute no more than 14 percent of village households, cultivate a total of 115.5 relong, or 36 percent \nof the total paddy land cultivated by villagers. The average size of their farms is 11.6 relong (8.2 acres). The half of the \nvillage (thirty-seven families) with the smallest farm sizes, by contrast, cultivates only 58.75 relong, or a mere 18 \npercent of the paddy land worked by villagers.9 Their average farm size is only 1.6 relong, or slightly more than 1 acre. \nHere we have a replication of the general situation in the Muda region: much of the village's farm population does not \nhave access to the productive resources that would allow them to achieve a reliable subsistence. While their small plots \nmay provide many of them with their daily rice, they could not make ends meet without the cash they earn as wage \nlaborers in the paddy fields or elsewhere.\nAs with the figures on land ownership, it is possible to contrast the distribution of farm size in 1979 with the situation in \n1967, using Horii's data for the earlier period (table 4.3). The relative stability of the percentage distributions masks far \nmore dramatic changes. The small farmers in Sedaka have quite literally lost ground. Their share of the total land \nfarmed has diminished from nearly one-quarter to less than one-fifth; the total acreage they farm has declined by\n8. The exceptional circumstances were that still another brother who lives on a government rubber estate \nelsewhere in Kedah and who inherited adjacent land, which he came to farm, simply took over these two \nsmall plots and farmed them himself. All entreaties failed and the two sisters, afraid to go to the police or \ncourts, given their brother's reputation for violence, finally decided to sell their plots to another brother, since \nthey had been unable to cultivate them for five seasons. The brother who bought the land was, as of 1981, still \nunable to farm it and had begun a costly law suit to enforce his title. The case illustrates the tenuous influence \nof the state and its agents in enforcing property law where anyone is willing to use violence to frustrate its \nworking. According to villagers, however, it is quite an exceptional case.\n9. I have included ten families who farm no land at all. While the usual practice in computing farm-size \ndistributions is to include only those families who cultivate at least some land, the results of this procedure \nunderestimate the extent of land hunger. Seven of the ten families in question would jump at the chance to rent in \nland if it were available; only three are retired cultivators who choose not to farm.\n  \n< previous page\npage_98\nnext page >\n",

Coupled with the growth in the population of the village, this has cut the average farm size for this \nhard-pressed sector of the village from 3 relong before double-cropping to only 1.6 relong in 1979. This change alone \nhas been sufficient to more than negate the additional income that double-cropping could have provided.10 It would \nappear from the figures that large-scale farmers have lost considerable ground as well, especially in terms of average \nfarm size. Much of this loss, however, can be traced to a single farmer, Kamil (#55), who in 1967 rented in an amazing \n38 relong, most of which has since been reclaimed by the outside landowner and distributed to his heirs.\nThe reasons for this basic structural change, which threatens the livelihood of the poorest villagers, are important and \ncomplex enough to merit extended analysis later; a few reasons have already been mentioned in the preceding chapter. \nHere it is sufficient to note that demography has played a role. Many rather poor families who have moved into the \nvillage have either no land to farm or, more typically, only a relong or two. The process of inheritance has also meant \nthat\n10. Double-cropping does not, other things equal, simply double income. The necessary inputs for double-\ncropping, including fertilizer, tractor preparation, and increased labor costs, drain away a portion of the new \ngains. In Kedah, it was initially estimated that the net return for rice land was raised by 60 percent because of \nirrigation. Thus 1.6 relong would, if double-cropped, be equivalent to 2.66 relong of single-cropped land. The \ndecline by half in the average holding of small farmers in Sedaka has thus left them worse off in terms of farm \nincome despite the fact that they harvest two crops a year.\n  \n< previous page\npage_99\nnext page >\n",

Some of this is evident from the \ndecline in total paddy land cultivated by villagers between 1967 and 1979.\nVillage Composition\nSedaka was not, in 1979, quite the same village it was in 1967. Some households had broken up or moved out. Still \nmore households had established themselves. The total number of households had grown by 25 percent (from fifty-six \nto seventy), and the total village population had grown at roughly the same pace.11 Simply by looking at such changes \nin detail we can learn a good deal not only about mobility in Malay society but also about how that mobility is linked to \nthe vital issues of land, income, and kinship.\nA more detailed analysis of changing village composition may be found in appendix A, but for my immediate purposes \nthe following points merit special note. Of those leaving the village, the poor tended to leave as individualsyoung men \nand women typically leaving to work in urban areas (as construction workers, manual laborers, factory workers, and \ndomestic servants). Families that left Sedaka as families, on the other hand, tended to be well-offbuying land in a \nfrontier area or being accepted as a \"settler\" on a government estate (rancangan). Fifteen new families have moved to \nSedaka, and it is significant that they are among the poorest half of the village. As villagers put it, \"People have \nchildren, but the land does not have children.\" There is no niche in the village economy that could accommodate most \nof the population increase already born.\nLand Tenure\nMany of the major changes in the economic life of Sedaka are reflected in the basic data on overall land tenure shown in \ntable 4.4. Detailed comparisons may be found in tables 1 and 2 of appendix C. The discussion here is confined to only \nthe most striking findings.\nThe most obvious trend over the past dozen years has been an increase in both the number and proportion of marginally \nsized farms and a decline in the share of large farms. The number of households farming 3 relong or less has doubled \nfrom twelve to twenty-four. Five of those farms are less than a single\n11. Expansion from fifty-six to seventy-four households would yield an increase of 32 percent, but my \nhousehold figures include four \"frontier\" households that Horii chose not to consider as falling in Sedaka.\n  \n< previous page\npage_100\nnext page >\n",

Thus a farmer who operates 15 relong \nand rents out another 15 relong falls in the 20 + -40 category. There is a small degree of double counting of \nplots that figure once as land owned by a village landlord and again if the land is cultivated by a local \ntenant. Since the great bulk of tenanted land in Sedaka is rented from outsiders, the double counting is not \nsubstantial.\n \nrelong, a size category that Horii could justifiably ignore altogether in 1967. Over the same period, the average size of \nthese minuscule farms has declined to less than 2 relong, or 1.4 acres. The decline in small farm size is not a \nconsequence of a stable class of smallholders squeezed onto less and less land; on the contrary, the proportion of village-\nheld land that such small operators farm has actually grown nearly twofold from 7 to 13 percent. As a class, they have \nlost ground in part because they are so much more numerous and in part because the total paddy land farmed by \nvillagers has diminished by nearly 10 percent (from 357.75 relong to 325 relong).\nThe compression of farm size among a growing number of poor cultivators has not been accompanied by a parallel \nexpansion of farm size by larger-scale cultivators in the village. In fact, nearly the reverse has occurred. Before double-\ncropping there were seventeen farmers who owned and/or operated more than 10 relong; collectively they monopolized \nmore than 57 percent of village-held land (206.5 relong). Today, when the village is more populous, there are only \nthirteen such households, and they farm only 37 percent of village-held land (123 relong). The average farm cultivated \nby this strata shrank in the same period from over 12 relong to 9.5 relong. Thus we find a situation in which the size of \nboth small farms and large farms has diminished, but the number of small farmers has doubled while that of large-scale \nfarmers has declined.\nLooking at the average farm size for the village as a whole, the trend is comparable. The average paddy farm in 1967 \nwas nearly 7 relong; now it is less than 5. This represents a farm size decline of 32 percent which, using the\n  \n< previous page\npage_101\nnext page >\n",

Its population of farm \nhouseholds has grown by nearly one-third while the paddy land it cultivates has diminished by nearly 10 percent. Even \nif the village had not lost farm land, population growth alone would have reduced the average farm size from nearly 7 \nrelong to 5.2. The balance of the decrease in average farm size to its present level of 4.7 can be attributed to loss of \nnearly 33 relong of the farm land that villagers cultivated in 1967. How has this reduction come about? It has not come \nabout, we can be certain, because village landowners have withdrawn land from village tenants. The amount of land that \nvillage landowners rent out to their fellow villagers, usually close kin, has remained stable over the last twelve years. \nAll of the land withdrawn from village cultivation in this period has instead been withdrawn by outside landlords, many \nof them quite rich, who have chosen to farm the land themselves, give it to their grown children to farm, or rent it out on \nlong-term lease (pajak) to other large-scale operators.\nIf we examine the distribution of tenure categories in 1967 and again in 1979, the pattern is one of relative stability. A \npartial exception is the emergence, for the first time, of five households of pure noncultivating landlords in the village. \nBut two of these landlords rent out tiny plots because they are too poor even to finance a crop and see it through to the \nharvest. The rest are mostly old men who can no longer cultivate and, in one case, a man whose debts have temporarily \nforced him to rent out his land to meet his creditors' demands. The only other notable change has been a modest \ndecrease in the proportion of village farmers who are pure tenants (from 44 to 35 percent). Far more striking, however, \nhas been the decline in farm size for these pure tenants. They remain, as in 1967, by far the most numerous tenure \ncategory, but they had cultivated an average of 6.1 relong in 1967; by 1979, their average farm size had declined to 4.1 \nrelong. If the three tenants who now cultivate more than 7 relong are removed, the average holding of the remaining \ntenants falls to 3.3 relong. As in the Muda region as a whole, the loss of land is largely confined to the class of pure \ntenants. Collectively, while their absolute numbers have grown from twenty-three to twenty-six, they have lost more \nthan one-fifth of the land they cultivated before double-cropping. The farm size of the smaller class of pure owner-\noperators, by contrast, has remained small but stable over the same period.\n12. The 1979 average farm size of 4.7 relong under double-cropping would represent the equivalent of 7.5 \nrelong under single-cropping (see n. 10 above). The average farmer in Sedaka in 1967, however, had 6.9 \nrelong to farm, or 92 percent of that figure.\n  \n< previous page\npage_102\nnext page >\n",

One key change, as noted earlier, was the virtual disappearance of what were called \npaddy rents (sewa padi) and their replacement by what are known as cash rents (sewa tunai).13 In 1967, Horii found \nthat just under half (48 percent) of the land rental contracts in Sedaka were cash denominated rather than tied to \npaddy.14 By 1979, however, paddy-denominated rents were conspicuous by their absence, and over 90 percent of all \ntenancy contracts now provided for stipulated cash rents.\nTable 4.5 · Classification of Tenancy Agreements in Sedaka by Timing of Rental Payment, 1967, 1979\nPreplanting Payment of Rent\nPost-harvest Payment of Rent\n%\n(N)*\n%\n(N)*\n1967\n7\n(3)\n93\n(43)\n1979 42\n(28)\n58\n(38)\n*\"N\" represents the number of parcels rented in during a given year and is thus greater than the \nnumber of farmers renting in land because quite a few rent in more than a single parcel.\n \nBefore 1970, the payment of cash rent before planting season was quite rare, as shown in table 4.5. By 1979, however, \nprepayment of rent had become quite common and was approaching one-half of all tenancy agreements. Most of this \nshift occurred in the first two years of double-cropping, when the initial profits from the new irrigation scheme \ncombined to give most tenants the means to pay, and hence landlords the possibility of requiring, rents in advance. For \npoorer tenants, the burden was considerable. Exactly how many villagers were unable to raise the cash and lost land in \nthis fashion is, as we shall see, a matter of lively disputea dispute that basically follows class lines.15\n13. See Horii, \"Land Tenure System,\" 57, 58, who writes, \"In connection with fixed rent in kind (sewa padi) it \nis important to note that the actual payment is made in cash received from the sale of the stated amount of \npadi. Tenants will sell the amount of padi determined in the agreement to merchants right after the harvest and \nuse the money thus obtained to pay the landowner.\"\n14. Ibid., 57.\n15. It is not, of course, simply a matter of how good one's memory is for the facts, but a question of interpretation. \nOne villager, typically well-to-do, may claim that the change of tenants was due to a personal dispute about other \nmatters or that the previous tenant no longer wanted to farm the land. Another villager, typically poorer, may claim \nthat the point at issue was precisely paying the rent in advance. For more discussion of how \"social facts\" are the \nsubject of varying class-based interpretations, see chapter 5.\n  \n< previous page\npage_103\nnext page >\n",

The local term for \nnegotiable rents is ''living rent\" (sewa hidup) to denote their flexibility, as opposed to \"dead rent\" (sewa mati), which is \nrigidly enforced. Non-negotiable rents include all tenancies in which rent must be paid before planting as well as a \nnumber of post-harvest-rent tenancies that are rigidly enforced. This is particularly the case with post-harvest rents \nbetween landlords and tenants who have no kinship tie.\nTable 4.6 · Classification of Tenancy Agreements in Sedaka by Negotiability of Rents, 1967, 1979\nRents May be Adjusted\nRents Not Negotiable\n%\n(N)\n%\n(N)\n1967\n72\n(33)\n28\n(13)\n1979\n47\n(31)\n53\n(35)\nNOTE: For 1967, the figures are estimates based on Horii, who indicates that, in addition to leasehold \ntenancies, rentals between non-kin are rarely adjustable (\"Land Tenure System,\" 60). Elsewhere, \nhowever, Horii also says that rent reduction is only possible in the case of paddy-denominated rents. I \nam confident that this last statement is partly in error, for even in 1979 cash-denominated rents \nbetween close kin were often negotiable. Accordingly, I have added non-kin rentals and leasehold \ntenancies together to approximate non-negotiable tenancies in 1969. The figures for 1979, by contrast, \nare based on direct inquiries I made about the possibility of adjustments in each case.\n \nAs table 4.6 shows, tenancies with inflexible rents were, before double-cropping, the exception, whereas by 1979 they \nhad become common enough to constitute a majority of all tenancy agreements. A tenant paying average-to-high rents \nmust harvest, depending on his production costs, anywhere from seven to eleven gunny sacks of paddy in order simply \nto break even.16 Average yields in Sedaka are roughly thirteen to fourteen gunny sacks and occasionally drop as low as \nseven to eight. Under the older system of tenancy, the actual rent would typically be reduced to compensate, at least in \npart, for harvest losses. Now when the rice crop, which even with irrigation is still subject to the caprice of nature, is \ndamaged, the tenant must absorb the entire loss and still come up with full rent in advance of the coming season. While \nthe tenant will in almost every case continue to rent the land, the cost in a bad year is likely to be severe in terms of belt \ntightening, short-term migration to seek work, and new debts. The landlord-tenant relationship has in the meantime been \ntransformed in such cases into a rigid, if unwritten, impersonal contract.

They averaged M$71 per relong in 1967 and by 1979 had climbed to M$112, a rate of \nincrease that was slightly below the increase in rice production costs generally.17 For many tenants, especially those \nclosely related to their landlord, land rents are no more burdensome a share of the harvest proceeds now than they were \nin 1967. But the fact that rent increases have been relatively modest by no means implies that landlords have suffered \nproportionally. The reverse is the case, for, with the onset of double-cropping, all landlords instantly received a \npermanent windfall doubling of their annual rental income, thanks to the irrigation scheme.\nIn Sedaka, as in the rest of Kedah, all but a very few tenancy agreements are oral contracts struck up informally between \nthe two parties. This pattern is in violation of the Padi Cultivators' Ordinance of 1955 (reenacted in 1967), which \nprovides for the registration of tenancy contracts and sets maximum rents (as a proportion of the average harvest) for \neach soil class. Needless to say, most rents in Sedaka exceed that ceiling today as they did in 1967. No serious effort has \nbeen made to enforce the act against what would surely be the stiff opposition of the landowning class, which forms the \ncore of the ruling party in the countryside. For tenants renting from close relatives, the act is unnecessary, as they \ntypically have fairly secure tenure and pay flexible, concessionary rents. For those who pay market rents, requesting \nregistration would be an invitation to immediate dismissal and in any case would be pointless inasmuch as registration \ndoes not prevent the landlord from resuming cultivation himself or, in practice, from insisting on illegally high rents \nunder the table.\nAverage rent levels are, however, quite misleading when what we have in Sedaka and in Kedah generally is a highly \nfragmented land rental market with rents that ran the gamut in 1979 from M$200 per relong to virtually zero.18\n17. For 1967 I have combined the cash value of paddy-denominated rents with cash-denominated rents to \narrive at an average.\n18. The question of rent-free tenancies, nearly always between parents and their children, is not straightforward. \nMany quick surveys of land tenure using formal interview schedules seem to indicate that quite a lot of land is \n\"rented\" in this fashion. It is common for parents to claim that they charge no rent to their children and for children \nto say that they are charged no rent. This situation is in keeping with village-wide values concerning the relations \nthat ought to obtain between parents and children. In practice, however, closer inquiry reveals that very few \ntenancies of this sort are actually free of rent. The one exception is the common practice of parents with sufficient \nland to rent a plot to a newly married son or daughter free of charge for the first year of their marriage, as a \nwedding present to the new couple. Aside from this exception, children nearly always pay something for the land \neach\n(footnote continued on next page)\n  \n< previous page\npage_105\nnext page >\n",

The \ndisparity in rent levels reflects a bifurcated tenancy system in which a substantial share (42 percent) of those who rent in \nland are the beneficiaries of concessionary terms from their parents or grandparents. Within this protected market, \nseasonal paddy-land rents are substantially below those prevailing outside. Rents between non-kin are, as would be \nexpected, by far the highest, with rentals between more distant kin falling roughly midway between the two extremes. \nDespite the commercialization brought about by the green revolution, land tenure is still dominated by kinship \ntenancies, which form fully two-thirds of all land rentals, as they do in Muda as a whole, and which provide some \nshelter from the full effects of a thoroughly capitalist market for land. Concessionary kinship tenancies between close \nkin, however, represent only 40 percent of land farmed by tenants in Sedaka, since the average size of the plot rented \nfrom close kin is smaller than the plot rented to non-kin.\nTable 4.7 · Rental Rates for Tenancies Classified by Degree of Kinship between Landlord and \nTenant in Sedaka, 1979\nClose Kinship\nLess Close Kinship\nNo Kinship\nNo. of cases\n28\n16\n22\nPercentage of all tenancy \ncases\n42%\n24%\n33%\nAverage rent per relong, per \nseason\nM$98.82\nM$117.61\nM$131.80\n \nKinship is not the only social tie that mitigates the terms of tenancy. When landlord and tenant both live in the village, \nthe rent is typically below what the market will bear. Thus the rent paid by an unrelated tenant to his landlord outside \nthe village averages M$129 per relong a season, while rent to an unrelated\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nseason whether in kind, if they live in the same household, or in cash. This payment is viewed by both parties \nas a gift and not rent, as the amount is often left to the discretion of the son or daughter. Even when no \npayment at all is made, it is usually the case that labor services in the household or farm or occasional gifts are \ngiven that are in part linked to the provision of land. For evidence of this practice elsewhere in Kedah, see \nMohd. Shadli Abdullah, \"The Relationship of the Kinship System to Land Tenure: A Case Study of Kampung \nGelung Rambai\" (Master's thesis, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang), 108, 13435, and Diana Wong, \"A Padi \nVillage in North Malaysia\" (1980, mimeo.).\n  \n< previous page\npage_106\nnext page >\n",

Three-quarters of tenants who have some relation (but not a parent-child relation) to their \nlandlord are permitted to pay after the harvest, while less than half of those renting from relatives outside the village are \ngiven this concession.20 All this is palpable evidence, if one needed it, that the village is a community in modest but \nsignificant ways. Unfortunately, the land available under such terms is in no way equal to the land hunger and \ndemographic pressures it confronts.\nOutside the somewhat sheltered customary market for tenancy between kin and neighbors, the winds of a competitive \nmarket blow briskly. The average rent for land rented to non-kinsmen is one indication of this competition. Another \nindication is what might be termed the Haji landlord market for rents. As noted earlier, many members of the well-to-do \nHaji landowning class are highly commercial operators who in many cases have branched out into other related \nenterprises such as tractor rental, rice milling, and trucking. There are in fact nine villagers who rent land from Hajis to \nwhom they are not closely related. The average rent for these nine tenancies is M$140 (per relong, per season), which is \nwell above even the mean rent for all tenants who rent from outside landlords with whom they have no kinship relation. \nThough none of these Hajis operates on anything like the scale of Haji Broom, they are a key segment of a small but \npowerful landowning class operating on strict commercial principles.\nNowhere is the competition for land more apparent than in the dramatic transformation of long-term leasehold or pajak \ntenancy over the past decade. It was possible in 1967 to view leasehold tenancy as part and parcel of customary\n19.

Even the exceptions to the pattern are instructive. Only four of twenty-seven close kin pay rents before the \nseason begins, and in three of these cases the parents who rent out the land are so poor that their children pay the \nrent in advance in order to help them out. The spirit of making a concession is still at work, but in these cases it is \na concession made by tenants to their parents. Of non-kin tenants, only six of twenty-one are permitted to pay rents \nafter the harvest, and here special circumstances are at work as well. In five cases the land has been rented to the \nsame family for over twenty years, thus providing for a degree of familiarity and trust that is rare in most tenancy \nagreements between non-kin. The remaining anomalous case is one in which the land is so subject to flooding and \nharvest losses that no one would take the risk of renting it if the rent were not negotiable after the harvest.\n  \n< previous page\npage_107\nnext page >\n",

Horii found three cases of leasehold tenancy in Sedaka, all of which were between relatives, \nand the average rent charged was well below the standard for cash rents at the time.21 He concluded justifiably that \nsuch multiseason tenancies with rent paid in advance were not instances of a \"landlord's hard-hearted demand for \nadvance payment\" of a large sum but rather \"an expression of mutual aid between kin . . . a kind of subsistence credit \nsystem between related landowners and tenants.\"22\nBy 1979, leasehold tenancy had become a thoroughly commercial transaction reflecting the new profits available to \nsome landowners and tenants under double-cropping. The number of cases of pajak tenancy had grown from three to \nseven; the amount of land involved had doubled from 10 to 20 relong and, most striking, the mean pajak rental, adjusted \nto a seasonal basis, worked out to M$142 per relong, well above even the mean rents between nonrelatives. If anything, \nthe high rent is an understatement of current pajak rents, since a number of the existing agreements were struck well \nbefore 1979, when lower rents prevailed, and since one would also expect that lump-sum, long-term rents such as these \nwould be discounted at something approaching the current rate of interest and result in lower, not higher, seasonal rents. \nThe current levels of pajak rents are best indicated by the most recently concluded agreement, which allows the tenant \n(Tok Omar, #37) to cultivate 3 relong for two seasons in return for a rent of M$1,110the equivalent of a seasonal rent \nper relong of $185.\nIf, as most observers agree, highly commercial pajak tenancies are becoming increasingly common in Muda as a whole \nas well as in Sedaka, the impact on access to land is ominous.23 What leasehold tenancy along these lines implies, as \nwe have noted earlier, is that it will no longer be predominantly the poor who rent in land but the wealthy commercial \noperators with the ready capital to bid for such tenancies. An example of the obstacles that confront even middle \npeasants who attempt to compete in this market is the case of Rokiah (the wife of Mat Buyong, #34) who was offered a \nlease of 2.5 relong for four seasons from her brother at a lump-sum rent of M$1,600. To raise this amount, all the gold \njewelry in the house was pawned and $500 in loans were taken from two shopkeepers at the usual high interest. Now \nher brother has announced that he wants to tack another year (M$800) onto the lease, before the initial term has\n21. Two of these three cases involved Chinese landlords who have written contracts, governed under the Padi \nCultivators Act, with their tenants. In these two cases the element of trust is supplemented by the landlord's \npossible fear that, if the timing of the rent were changed, the tenant might question the illegally high rents \ncurrently being charged for these plots.\n22. Horii, \"Land Tenure System,\" 62.\n23. See chap. 3, n. 50. It is possible, though there is no evidence on the subject, that a portion of the higher rents \n(when calculated seasonally) may be accounted for by leasehold land being, on average, more productive.\n  \n< previous page\npage_108\nnext page >\n",

Even Lazim, one \nof the largest farm operators in the village, was hard-pressed to raise the M$3000 pajak rent for the 4 relong he leased \n(for seven seasons) from Fadzil. Despite both the long-run attractiveness of the contract (on a per season basis the rent \nper relong was only M$107) and the fact that Fadzil allowed him to delay by one season the payment of a M$1,000 \nbalance, much of the initial sum had to be borrowed from a nearby Chinese trader. It is thus no coincidence that not a \nsingle leasehold tenant in the village comes from among the poorest third of its households, while it is precisely these \nhouseholds that most desperately need land to farm. It is also indicative of the commercial nature of such leaseholds that \nthey are now always written and notarized even when the parties are closely related.24\nFour villagers have already lost land they previously rented when the owner insisted on shifting to a long-term lease and \nthey were unable to come up with the necessary cash. Nearly 18 relong have passed out of village cultivation in this \nfashion. More worrisome still are the reports villagers receive almost daily at the market or from relatives about larger \nblocks of land passing into the hands of well-heeled, commercial tenants, many of whom they say are Chinese who \nalready own tractors and in some cases shares in a combine-harvester syndicate. Thus a villager in nearby Sungai Bujur \nhas rented 8 relong for fifteen seasons, at a rent of M$15,000, to a Chinese shopkeeper and tractor owner. On a \nsomewhat more modest scale, Tok Kasim (#60) in Sedaka has leased out 4 relong for ten seasons in order to raise the M\n$6,000 down payment for a taxi his son now drives. The tenant is the Chinese tractor owner for whom Tok Kasim \nworks as a broker, lining up ploughing jobs and collecting fees.25 He says he would have liked to rent to a Malay but no \none he knew had the cash when he needed it. Coupled with these reports is daily evidence of the competition for \nfarming land by outside commercial entrepreneurs. Hardly a week passes according to Lebai Pendek (#73), a well-to-do \nlandowner in Sedaka, that he is not asked by the Chinese shopkeepers with whom he trades if he would be willing to \nlease land to them.\nIt is not only that the initial capital outlay for any but the smallest leasehold tenancies is more than the annual net \nincome of all but a few households in the village. Beyond this, the current rent levels for such leaseholds work out to\n24. The tenant, of course, will insist on a written lease to protect his rights to cultivate for the specified \nnumber of seasons. There are a few stories circulating about leasehold tenants in the past who failed to insist \non a written contract (surat perjanjian) and discovered one fine morning that their landlord had sold the land \nbefore the agreement had lapsed.\n25. There are no reliable data available, locally or for the Muda region as a whole, that would indicate how \nsignificant the Chinese business class is in the leasehold market. Until there are, it is impossible to know whether \nlocal impressions are accurate or, if accurate, representative.\n  \n< previous page\npage_109\nnext page >\n",

It is a risk that most local cultivators, assuming they had the capital, would be fearful of running. Only those \nwho already own tractors and/or combine-harvesters, which reduce their production costs, and who farm enough land to \nspread their risks and absorb short-term losses can compete in this market. In effect, what appears to be happening is \nthat the owners of capitalmachinery, rice mills, cash reservesare now moving directly into the production process and \ncultivating themselves. The landowners who give over their land to pajak tenants may be rich or poor, but the new \ntenants leasing this land are increasingly drawn from the ranks of the wealthiest Malay and Chinese rural entrepreneurs. \nOwnership may remain basically unchanged while the concentration of operation, a kind of usufruct monopoly, grows \napace.26\nChanges in Rice Production and Wages\nThe five years following the beginning of double-cropping in Sedaka until roughly 1977 is now the object of justified \nnostalgia for the poorer households of the village: work was not only plentiful, with two crops to transplant, cut, thresh, \nand carry from the fields, but the peaks of labor demand at planting and harvesting time so improved the bargaining \nposition of laborers as to substantially raise their real wages. From the vantage point of, say, 1976, there was ample \ncause for optimismnearly everyone had gained. Large farmers and landowners, of course, were the major beneficiaries \nof the increased yields and higher paddy prices, even if higher production costs ate away a portion of that gain. \nSmallholders who had been barely making do found for the first time that double-cropping afforded them a modest \nsurplus and some relief from growing debts. Even the poorest villagers, with little or no land to farm, who relied heavily \non wage labor to feed their families, could find enough local work throughout the two rice seasons to make ends meet \nwithout leaving the village each year in search of wages.\nFrom the outside, it looked as if double-cropping had put the local peasantry\n26. This usufruct monopoly seems to be taking another form as well: the selling of \"green\" rice in the fields to \nsyndicates that own combine-harvesters. Under this practice, called jual pokok padi by villagers, the crop in \nthe fields, after transplanting but before harvest, is sold at a discount. It is resorted to not only by cultivators in \nfinancial difficulties but by large-scale farmers who want cash before the harvest. In Mengkuang, directly to \nthe south, it is said to be widespread, and there were at least six cases in Sedaka as well during my period \nthere. As with pajak, the seller may be poor or rich, but the buyer is nearly without exception rich. In this \nconnection, it should be added that there is no evidence that small farmers and small tenants with less capital \nhave inferior yields to those of larger farmers, although of course they market a smaller proportion of their \nproduction.\n  \n< previous page\npage_110\nnext page >\n",

From the inside, the villagers of Sedaka responded with the classic signs of peasant \noptimism. They rebuilt their houses with sturdier materials; they celebrated marriages and other rites of passage more \nlavishly; they bought new bicycles or even small motorcycles; they treated themselves to small luxuries of food, \nclothing, furniture, and even jewelry; they traveled to visit relatives whom they had scarcely seen before. For the first \ntime in their lives, the poorer households in the village found that the food, amenities, and ritual typical of the solid, \nmiddle peasantry before irrigation were within their grasp. Those who were already fairly well-to-do were in turn \naspiring to styles of consumption, ritual, and investment that only the wealthiest might have considered possible a \ndecade before. Small wonder that growing disparities in income were largely ignored in the general euphoria.\nBy 1978, and certainly by 1979, much of that euphoria had dissipated along with many of the material conditions that \nhad underwritten it. But if the euphoria had been rather general, disillusionment was more selective, affecting especially \nthe poor. Farm-gate prices had not changed since 1974, while production costs had mounted to erode incomesan \ninconvenience for large farmers but a serious blow to small tenants and owners. A drought forced the complete \ncancellation of the irrigated crop in 1978, thus cutting farm incomes in half and depriving the poor of the wage incomes \non which they had come to depend. At the same time, the very economic forces that had been responsible for the brief \nspurt of relative prosperity had begun to foster changes in tenure patterns and production techniques which served to \nundermine that prosperity, especially for those in the community who had benefited least. Large landlords, as we have \nseen, were encouraged by greater profits either to resume cultivation themselves or to rent out large blocks of land to \nwell-heeled leasehold tenants who paid premium rents in advance. In either case, the pool of land available for rental by \nsmallholders and modest tenants was reduced.\nAt about the same time, combine-harvesters began to make their appearance on the landscape. They were made possible \nin large part by the same economic forces that had earlier improved the incomes of village wage workers. Only in the \ncontext of relatively higher harvest labor costs and the possibility of harvesting virtually year round under double-\ncropping did the investment in large combine-harvesters become profitable.27 The direct and indirect impact of \nmachine harvesting has been enormous. The biggest losers have been almost ex-\n27. These were not, of course, the only factors. Both the large increase in paddy prices in 197374 and the \nrestriction of Thai harvest labor, coupled with the decline in migrant labor for Kelantan, were instrumental as \nwell. The federal government, by lowering or eliminating import duties on harvesting machines, also lowered \ntheir capital cost to the syndicates that purchased them.\n  \n< previous page\npage_111\nnext page >\n",

Reeling from the lost income when the off-season crop of 1978 was cancelled outright, they \nsoon realized that the entry of combine-harvesters would prevent them from recouping their losses by hand-harvesting \nin 1979. They tightened their belts again. Feasts (kenduri) and marriages were foregone, postponed, or celebrated on a \nmuch smaller scale; the small luxuries they had permitted themselves all but disappeared; and by 1979 many of the poor \nwere once again leaving for temporary work in the city in the familiar effort to make ends meet.\nBy examining the economic repercussions of these changes in Sedaka alone, it becomes possible to observe the larger \nchanges described in the last chapter writ small. The local effects of this shift in production techniques also will reveal a \nvariety of other, subsidiary consequences that are simply lost in any aggregate analysis of the Muda region as a whole. \nHere again we are concerned with the local \"facts\" and leave the all-important questions of their social meaning and the \nreaction to them for subsequent chapters.\nThe mechanization of rice cultivation naturally posed the most direct threat to the sector of the village that depended \nmost heavily on agricultural wage labor as a source of income. The small class of pure wage laborers were most \ngrievously affected. There are, however, only four such households in Sedaka; in Muda as a whole, the estimates of the \nproportion of pure wage labor households range anywhere from 7 to 10 percent. It is perhaps for this reason that so little \nattention has been devoted to the loss of wages brought about by mechanization. If the impact were confined to this \nclass, such inattention might possibly be justified, given the buoyant labor market outside the rice economy. But the \nimpact is far wider, embracing to some extent all those families historically dependent on farm labor for a portion of \ntheir income. The extent of this dependence in Sedaka during the main season of 197778 is striking, as can be seen in \ntable 4.8.\nTable 4.8 · Proportion of Total Net Income Derived from Paid Paddy-Field Labor* by \nHouseholds in Sedaka: Main Season, 19771978\n100%\nOver 50%\n25%49%\n024%\n0\nNo. of households\n4\n15\n9\n24\n22\nPercentage of total village \nhouseholds\n5%\n20%\n12%\n32%\n30%\n*Such labor includes, above all, transplanting, cutting, threshing, and in-field transportation. It \nalso includes less common wage work: harrowing with water buffalo, pulling, bundling, and \ntransporting of seedlings, repairing bunds, replanting (sulam) damaged areas after transplanting, \nweeding, and spreading fertilizer.

All but two of these families are from among the poorest half of the village, \nand they typically have either so little land or such large families (or both) that only paddy wage labor allows them to \nkeep their heads above water. Another nine households (12 percent) rely on such wages for more than one-quarter of \ntheir income, while a further twenty-four households receive at least some cash income from field labor. Thus more \nthan two-thirds of Sedaka's families have some stake in agricultural labor; for more than one-third, that stake is \nsubstantial. Even these figures may understate the vital importance of field work for wages.28 In fact, of the twenty-two \nhouseholds that have no income from wage labor, half are composed of retired or disabled members unfit for such work.\nThe first step in the mechanization of rice cultivation was the use of tractors for field preparation. Tractor hire was \nwidespread well before double-cropping began but usually in conjunction with the use of water buffalo for breaking up \nclods of the clayey soil (lanyak), leveling (menggiling), and harrowing (sisir, menyisir). The importance of water \nbuffalo in rice cultivation until as late as 1967 is reflected by Horii's finding that there were nearly as many water \nbuffalo as households in Sedaka and that most of the villagers who did not own an animal leased one. Double-cropping, \nby putting a premium on speed in ploughing, favored the use of tractors for nearly all stages of field preparation. The \nadded expense and the loss of income to owners and drivers of buffalo were considerable, but the peasants of Sedaka \nsaw no reason to dwell on what, at the time, seemed like petty losses in the context of far more substantial gains.\nThe losses sustained by two of the poorer households in the village are fairly typical. Hamzah (#8), Razak's younger \nbrother, used to earn as much as M$200 a year before double-cropping by cutting stalks and secondary growth \n(merumput)\n28. First, when the rice yield is poor, many more villagers seek paddy wage work both inside and outside the \nvillage. The figures in table 4.8, however, reflect the importance of wage labor following a good season. \nFurthermore, combine-harvesters had already put in a modest appearance by 197778, thereby slightly cutting \nthe wage-labor receipts of some households. Exchange labor (derau), which was a fairly common practice at \nthis time for smallholders for both transplanting and cutting paddy, is also not calculated here since no cash \nchanges hands. If it were counted, on the premise that it is labor that is in a sense \"paid\" in the amount by \nwhich it reduces production costs, the reliance on labor income would appear to be greater. I have also chosen \nnot to include wage labor receipts by youngsters, which are typically kept as pocket-money and not given \nover to the household. Since such earnings, especially in poorer households, reduce expenses for the upkeep \nof children to some extent, they might arguably have been included in the figures, thus further increasing the \nimportance of farm wages. Finally, the figures in the table were collected after the combine had already made \ninroads into wage work. Figures from 197374 would thus show more dependence on wage work.\n  \n< previous page\npage_113\nnext page >\n",

By 1973, this work had all but \nevaporated. Samad (#17), who still owns a water buffalo, figured that he earned as much as M$500 a year by ploughing \nand harrowing over 20 relong for other farmers at a piece-rate of M$25 per relong. Now he is lucky to earn M$100 a \nyear for such work and thinks he may soon sell his buffalo. It is nearly impossible to estimate the average losses \nsuffered by the poorer households of Sedaka inasmuch as they were gradual and unevenly distributed. But an \nagroeconomic survey, which found that the labor input per unit of land per crop immediately following double-cropping \nin Muda fell by 17 percent, would probably not be far off the mark for income losses as well.29 The tractors that now \ndo almost all the field preparation in Sedaka are nearly all large, four-wheeled machines owned by wealthy \nentrepreneurs, both Malay and Chinese, living outside the village. Only four villagers own tractors. Three are owned by \nthe three richest villagers (Haji Kadir, Lebai Pendek, and Amin), although the machines are two-wheeled pedestrian \ntractors used largely on the owners' paddy land. The ownership of water buffalo was, by contrast, much more evenly \ndistributed throughout the village.30\nIf the mechanization of field preparation in Sedaka was generally applauded amidst the new wage-labor opportunities \nprovided by double-cropping, the mechanization of paddy harvesting was far more divisive, not to say explosive. It is \nno exaggeration to say that the commercial combine-harvesters swept through the rice plain around the village. They \nfirst made their appearance during the irrigated season harvest in mid-1976, but only one or two outside\n29. Clive Bell, Peter Hazell, and Roger Slade, The Evaluation of Projects in Regional Perspective: A Case \nStudy of the Muda Irrigation Project (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, forthcoming), chap. 2, p. 40. \nLabor input for land preparation alone fell by one-half between 1970 and 1973.\n30. Today water buffalo have become almost more of a financial liability than a capital asset. Their number has \nfallen from forty-two to twenty-two over the past dozen years, reflecting not only their declining value but also the \nincreased difficulty of feeding and breeding them. The costs for ploughing and harrowing that once circulated \nlargely within the village sphere are now paid to the well-to-do, outside owners of this new factor of production. In \nthe mukim of Sungai Daun, embracing Sedaka and many other villages, the number of water buffalo has fallen \nfrom 1,670 head in 1970 to 1,014 head in 1977, or nearly 40 percent. The current owners still use them for \nharrowing their own land and occasionally that of others, as well as for pulling seedlings or harvested paddy \nthrough flooded fields on a sled (andur). The labor time required to keep a water buffalo has also risen \nappreciably. Before double-cropping, the buffalo could be released to graze on the stubble and along the bunds and \ncanals. Now, with two seasons, either fodder must be cut and brought to them or they must be carefully tethered \nlest they damage someone's crop. At least one animal in the past seven years was slashed and left to die by an \n(unknown) villager who presumably found it marauding in his field. Breeding is also more difficult now that open \ngrazing is restricted.\n  \n< previous page\npage_114\nnext page >\n",

By the irrigated season of 1979, five seasons later, they were harvesting fully 60 percent of \nSedaka's paddy land. A year later they harvested more than 80 percent.\nThe first villagers to hire combine-harvesters were almost exclusively large operators of 6 relong or more. Given their \nfarm size, they seldom had sufficient family labor to harvest their crop themselves or to exchange labor (berderau) with \nother neighbors. The costs of hired labor for harvesting their paddy had grown appreciably in real terms due to the \nprohibition of Thai laborers and the curtailing of migrants from Kelantan.31 The new double-cropping regimen had also \nplaced a premium on speed. The new high-yielding varieties shattered more easily when ripe; they were, in the irrigated \nseason particularly, harvested under wet conditions that promoted spoilage; and, when the season had begun late, it was \nimportant to harvest quickly in order to ready the land for the next planting.\nSmall farmers and tenants were understandably more reluctant to hire the combine-harvesters. It had been both more \nfeasible and more important for them to do part or all of the harvesting themselves: more feasible because they were \ntypically ''richer\" in labor than in land and more important because the potential savings in the cash costs of cultivation \nwere of greater significance for them.32 They were also, of course, well aware that combine-harvesters could and did \nthreaten the main sources of wage-labor earnings for the low-income families in the village. And yet, the matter was not \nquite so straightforward even for the small farmer. The harvest period was by far the most lucrative for the men and \nwomen of poor households; women working in small gangs could earn as much as M$7 a day cutting paddy, and strong \nmen could, by threshing eight or nine gunny sacks, earn M$1618 a dayprovided they were available for work. Here was \nthe rub. Each day that they harvested their own land or exchanged labor with their neighbors, they were foregoing the \nopportunity of earning high wages at the peak of harvest demand. Individually, it might make short-run sense to use the \ncombine for their own small parcel, thus freeing themselves for many more days of wage labor on the land of others. \nCollectively, of course, it added up to a beggar-thy-neighbor policy in the long run as combine-harvesters replaced hand-\nharvesting on more and more of Sedaka's paddy land. For some,\n31. The costs of cutting and threshing a relong of paddy had more than doubled from roughly M$28 in 1971 \nto M$60 in 1976. By contrast, the consumer price index had risen by only 44 percent. See S. Jegatheesan, \n\"Progress and Problems of Rice Mechanization in Peninsular Malaysia,\" Working Paper No. 17 (Persidangan \nPadi Kebangsaan Malaysia [Malaysian National Conference on Paddy], Kuala Lumpur, February 2628, \n1980), 11.\n32. Jagatheesan, (\"Progress and Problems,\" 2), reports that for Muda as in 1975, farms below 2 relong in size \nrelied on hired labor for only 39 percent of the total labor required for cultivation, while for farms above 15 relong \nhired labor formed nearly 90 percent of total labor required.\n  \n< previous page\npage_115\nnext page >\n",

Inasmuch as the figures in table 4.9 rely on recollections of earlier wage \nearnings, they must be regarded as rough approximations.33\nTable 4.9 · Reported Losses of Net Household Income in Sedaka due to the Mechanization of Rice \nHarvesting: Irrigated Season, 1977, Compared with Irrigated Season, 1979\nProportion of Total Net Income Derived from Paid Paddy-Field Labor, \n1977\n100%\nOver 50%\n2549%\n023%\n0\nNo. of households\n4\n15\n9\n24\n22\nPercentage of net household \nincome lost, 1979\n31%\n16%\n8%\n4%\n0%\nApproximate cash lost per \nhousehold\nM$550\nM$269\nM$258\nM$156\nM$0\n \nThe losses, as expected, fall heaviest on the poorest households in Sedaka. For the households of pure wage laborers, \ncombine-harvesters represent an economic disaster. For an additional twenty-two families who rely on agricultural labor \nfor more than one-fourth of their income, the consequences are severe and unambiguous given their generally low \nincomes. But for over half the village (forty-six families) the use of combine-harvesters is either a boon or, at worst, a \nmixed blessing. This fact helps explain both the general acceptance of combine-harvesting and the class basis of support \nand opposition to it, which we shall examine in the next chapter.\nThe pattern and variety of losses in the village is best reflected in a few concrete examples. Karim (#10) rents only 2 \nrelong and counted on threshing wages for much of his cash income. Before the harvesters were widely used, he might \nearn as much as M$300 or M$400 a season by threshing paddy nonstop in Sedaka and nearby. Now he counts himself \nlucky if he can find enough threshing work to bring in M$100. As he details his losses, he adds, \"If it\n33. For example, a farmer might say that he earned anywhere from M$200 to M$250 threshing rice in 1977 \nand this season (1979) earned only M$100. His answer is really an order of magnitude and may reflect the \nearnings he typically expected before 1978. Despite the rough quality of these estimates, they are likely to be \nfairly accurate, given the striking ability of peasants to recall prices and wages over long periods of time.\n  \n< previous page\npage_116\nnext page >\n",

For some women who are heads of households, the combine-\nharvesters have spelled great hardship. Rosni (#26) is a forty-five-year-old widow with five children at home, famous \nfor her hard work, and the head of a gang of women from poorer households who transplant and cut paddy. Although \nshe rents in 4 relong, the rent is high, and she depends heavily on wage work to keep her large family going. Working \nwith her eldest daughter cutting paddy, the two earned M$350 during the main season of 1978, but these earnings had \ndropped to a mere M$70 by the irrigated season of 1979. Even their transplanting earnings were down, because two of \ntheir past employers had chosen to broadcast seed directly. She is afraid that the belt tightening now required will mean \nthat her thirteen-year-old son will have to drop out of secondary school. For households with no farming land, the \nconsequences of combine-harvesting have been nearly catastrophic. Mat \"halus\" (#6), a poor landless laborer, could \nhave expected to earn M$300 a season threshing paddy and his wife nearly the same amount cutting. Now their \ncombined wages are only $200 a season. They have made up a portion of that loss by both planting rice35 nearly ten \nmiles north of Sedaka but fear that he or the whole family will have to move out of Kedah to find work. Pak Yah (#11), \nanother landless laborer with an even larger family (nine children at home), is in the same boat. He and his wife, \ntogether with the four of their children who are of working age, could collectively earn as much as M$1400 in harvest \nlabor. Their combined income from cutting and threshing paddy has now dropped to roughly M$800, and one of their \nsons has decided to strike out on his own and find work in the city.\nThe wage losses recounted here became even more serious by the 1980 main season, when another 20 percent of the \nvillage land was harvested by combines. Some work hand-cutting and threshing paddy is still available, but villagers \nmust range farther afield to find it, and in any case it is only a small fraction of the work once available. Contrary to \nwhat one might expect, the piece-rates for hand harvestingroughly M$40 a relong for cutting and M$2.50 per gunny\n34. Here he is being somewhat sarcastic at my expense, as I had just finished helping to crush unripe padi \nwith a large pestle (antan) to make a preharvest delicacy (emping), widely eaten in the village, and it was well-\nknown how copiously I sweated when working. His words were: Kalau mesin tak musuk, saya pun kerja, \nberpeloh macham Jim. There is also in his remark an indication of the humiliation of idleness that we shall \nencounter later among other harvest laborers who have been displaced by the machine.\n35. Normally, transplanting is exclusively women's work. But, as elsewhere, the gender-based division of work \ntends to break down for the very poorest families, with men transplanting and/or cutting paddy and women on \noccasion even threshing. In the past, poor migrant couples from Kelantan would routinely cut and thresh paddy \nwithout regard to any sexual division of labor.\n  \n< previous page\npage_117\nnext page >\n",

Most of the paddy that is still \nhand harvested is planted in deep fields that are inaccessible to the machine or in which untimely winds or rain have \ncaused widespread lodging of the plants. As a result, such hand labor is often done in water that is knee deep and where \nstalks cannot be easily cut or threshed. It may thus take nearly twice the usual time for women to cut a relong of paddy, \nand men who under good conditions might thresh four gunny sacks in a morning might be lucky if they manage two. As \nwages are still paid by the task rather than the hour, the effective wage rate has been substantially cut. As Mustafa (#45) \ncomplains, \"These days they give poor people only the ditches to harvest.\"36\nThe impact of the combine-harvesters is by no means confined to the hand work they directly replace. For \nmechanization of the harvest has also set in motion a series of second-order consequencesnew possibilities that, once \ngrasped, have been nearly as devastating for the poor of the village. The first of these consequences is the virtual \nelimination of gleaning as a subsistence strategy of the poor. In 1978, before combine-harvesters were widely used, \nwomen and children from at least fourteen families regularly descended into the paddy fields, armed with mats (tikar \nmengkuang) and flails to collect the paddy grains that still clung to the threshed stalks. Such gleaning was more \ncommon in the main season when the ground was dry at harvest time than during the off-season when rain and mud \nmade gleaning more difficult. A poor family might typically glean three or four gunny sacks of paddy in this fashion.37 \nThis represented a vital addition to the food supply of landless or near-landless households; it involved no cash outlay, \nand the work of gleaning occurred at a time when there were few other wage opportunities for women. For at least one \nfamily, gleaning was the main source of food supply. Mat \"halus,\" his wife, and his daughter managed, by diligent \ngleaning for the better part of a month, to collect as much as fifteen sacks of paddyenough to feed the family for much \nof the year. As one might expect, the gleaners in Sedaka came typically from the poorest families; eleven of the fourteen \nfamilies that gleaned were from among the half of the village households with the lowest incomes.\nNow that combine-harvesting has all but eliminated gleaning, it is rare to see gleaners after the harvest except in those \nfew plots that have been threshed by hand. Only Mat \"halus\" and his wife, spurred on by the food needs of their large \nfamily, have managed to recoup a portion of their losses. Observing that\n36.La ni, alur sahaja bagi kat orang susah.\n37. The imputed rate of pay for such work is quite high. Four mornings of gleaning will yield, on average, one \ngunny sack of paddy, which, valued at M$35, represents nearly M$9 per morning, or three times the then current \nstandard rate of pay for a morning's labor.\n  \n< previous page\npage_118\nnext page >\n",

Hired labor, generally speaking, had typically taken two forms. The first, which \nprevailed for the transplanting and cutting of paddy (locally defined as women's work), was a group, piece-work system \nin which the head (ketua kumpulan share) negotiated a price per relong with the farmer doing the hiring. The proceeds \nwere then divided by the members of the labor gang. Threshing typically was by piece-work as well but was paid \nindividually, or to a group of two working at the same tub, on the basis of the amount threshed. Other work done outside \nthe busy planting and harvesting seasonsfor example, repairing of bunds, weeding, replanting, digging pits to catch \nwater during the dry seasonwas paid according to what is known as the kupang system: a fixed cash wage for a morning \nor day of work. Occurring at slack times in the paddy cycle, these wages were, and are, well below the effective wage \nrate for harvesting and transplanting.\nOver the past two years, however, the kupang system has increasingly been used for the reaping of paddy that must still \nbe done by hand. This shift is made possible precisely because combine-harvesting has displaced enough labor to \nstrengthen substantially the bargaining position of the farmer doing the hiring. If he must have his paddy cut by hand, \nthe farmer can now hire women by the morning. The effect is twofold. First, it is cheaper; the standard gang labor price \nfor cutting a relong of paddy was in 1979 at least M$35, while under the kupang system the cost is M$30 or less. \nSecond, it allows the hiring farmer to select laborers individually and to avoid having to negotiate with a group that is \nready-made and led by women with something of an incipient trade-union ethos. By the main season harvest of 1980, \nnearly half the hand-reaped paddy in Sedaka was cut in this fashion. In some nearby villages, the kupang system has \nbecome standard practice for reaping. It is less commonly found in transplanting labor, but here too it appears to be \nmaking small inroads, and the savings to the farmers (losses to laborers) seem comparable.39 For threshing,\n38. He calls such deposits tahi mesin, or \"machine droppings.\"\n39. Haji Kadir, for example, planted 3 relong in this way during the main season in 197879. He thereby saved M$7 \na relong over the prevailing gang-labor rate. There appear to be three reasons why the kupang system is less \ntypically used for transplanting than for reaping. First, quality control is far more important in planting. Second, \nsince planting is still done largely by hand and the labor surplus is not\n(footnote continued on next page)\n  \n< previous page\npage_119\nnext page >\n",

How widespread kupang payment will become for planting and threshing \nis difficult to foresee but already, in the case of reaping, it has served to lower wages somewhat and to weaken one of \nthe few forms of informal labor organization in the village.\nThe stronger bargaining position now enjoyed by the farmer who employs labor is reflected in other aspects of the \ninformal \"labor contract\" in the village. Until 1978, it had always been customary for the farmer hiring a transplanting \ngroup to feed them a full midday meal. By the off season of 1979, such meals were conspicuous by their absence. In \nsome cases the employing farmers unilaterally scaled down what had been an ample fish curry or glutinous rice with \nprawns to dry bread and tea. In response, women began bringing their own food along. Other farmers offered the \nwomen two transplanting piece-rates: M$35 a relong without food or M$32 a relong with food. Inasmuch as M$35 had \nbeen the standard wage the season before and had included the meal, the new dispensation effectively lowered the cost \nof planting. Most groups preferred to forego the food, which had been in any case reduced to the barest essentials, and it \nnow can be safely assumed that food for transplanters is past history.\nIn the days of single-cropping and during the halcyon period at the beginning of double-cropping it was common for \nfarmers, especially large landowners, also to advance wages to transplanters and harvesters well before the work began. \nThe advance might be in the form of rice or cash. This practice had advantages for both parties, for the farmer assured \nhimself field labor during the peak season, while the worker, especially under single-cropping, received a welcome \ninfusion of cash or rice at that point during the agricultural cycle when his family was most strapped financially and \nwhen his rice supply was nearly exhausted. The laborers, of course, paid a price for taking their pay early inasmuch as \nthe wage was discounted by as much as 30 percent from the prevailing wage at harvest time. By 1979, when combine-\nharvesting had made significant inroads into the demand for harvest labor, almost all farmers had abandoned the \npractice, reasoning that, even if hand harvesting was necessary, laborers could easily be recruited on the spot.\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nso marked at this period, the farmer is less often in a position to dictate terms. The exceptions are farmers who \nplant much earlier or later than the rest and thus have abundant supplies of labor from which to select. Finally, \nand perhaps most decisive, the effective wage rate (return per hour) for transplanting is already lower than for \nreaping, and a shift to the kupang system would yield little or no savings. Transplanting now includes the \npulling and bundling of seedlings as well and costs roughly M$35 per relong. Moving to the kupang system \nwould still entail piece-rates for pulling and bundling (at 6 cents a bundle, with roughly 240 bundles per \nrelong, or $14.40), and morning wages for ten women (at M$3 a head, or M$30), for a total of M$44.40. Only \nwhen family labor can be deployed to pull and bundle seedlings, as in Haji Kadir's case, would the kupang \nsystem appear to be advantageous.\n  \n< previous page\npage_120\nnext page >\n",

This was the common practice of farmers making a small gift of paddy \nover and above wages to laborers who had helped with the harvest. The gift was made as a kind of \"private Islamic \ntithe\" (zakat peribadi) and, although the practice was never universal, it was widespread enough to become part of the \nanticipated wage for many harvest workers. For the farmer, such a gift served much the same purpose as an advance \nagainst wages; it was a kind of premium that increased the likelihood that he could recruit the necessary work force \nwhen his next crop was ready. The practice has not entirely disappeared, but it has become the exception to the rule. Of \ncourse, in the case of machine harvesting, the question of tithe gifts or prior wages is irrelevant, for there is no labor \nforce save the machine operators, who are well-paid outsiders. But even in the cases of hand harvesting, the bagging of \npaddy, or the hauling of sacks, it is now extremely rare for the farmer to make any additional gift to workers.\nIn an indirect and somewhat perverse way, combine-harvesting has also contributed to the growth of broadcasting \n(tabor kering), a technique that now has made substantial inroads into the last major wage-labor opportunity in paddy \ngrowing: transplanting. Fields sown in this fashion have, unlike transplanted seedlings, no rows whatever, and the plants \nare far more likely to be of unequal height. For these reasons, they are more difficult to cut and thresh by handa \ndifficulty that would be reflected normally in the costs of hand harvesting.40 Neither the absence of rows or unevenness \nin growth, however, is an obstacle to the combine-harvesters, which charge a standard fee per relong regardless of how \nit has been sown. A farmer can now broadcast his seed, secure in the knowledge that he will not thereby simply raise the \ncost of gathering the crop.\nThe advantages of dry sowing are manifest. First and foremost, the cultivator saves the cash costs of transplanting as \nwell as the time and labor devoted to raising, tending, uprooting and transplanting the seedlings to the main field. Cash \nsavings at this point in the paddy cycle are particularly important, since transplanting costs must come from past savings \nwhile harvesting costs may be paid from the proceeds of the crop. Dry sowing also has special advantages in the Sedaka \narea, which is among the last areas to receive irrigation water. By broadcasting during the irrigated season, the farmer \nhas a better chance of\n40. This is especially the case when the crop must be gathered at the peak harvesting season. A few farmers \nwho broadcast quite early and whose crop is ready before others may take advantage of harvesting before the \npeak labor season and employ otherwise idle women on the kupang system, thereby paying less for reaping \nthan the contract system would have cost them. Normally, farmers avoid planting too early (or too late) as the \nearliest (or latest) ripening fields fall prey to pests such as rats and birds. In addition, early harvesters, unless \ntheir land lies along a road, cannot hire combine-harvesters, since the machines cannot enter the field without \ndestroying the unripe crops of one or more surrounding cultivators.\n  \n< previous page\npage_121\nnext page >\n",

If erratic rains or poor \ndrainage should ruin part or all of the broadcast crop, the farmer still has the alternative of reploughing and \nrebroadcasting or of buying surplus seedlings from neighbors and going back to transplanting.41\nSince the irrigated season of 1979, the progress of broadcasting in Sedaka has been striking to all and disquieting to \nmany. In the previous season, at least three large landowners in the neighboring village of Sungai Bujur, all of them \nHajis incidentally, tried broadcasting in an effort to get their crop in early.42 Two achieved better-than-average yields \nand their experience encouraged Abdul Rahman (#41), an owner of 16.5 relong, to try it himself on a portion of his \nland. His yield was not satisfying (eight gunny sacks per relong), but this was attributed more to his failure to tend the \ncrop closely than to the technique itself. By the main season of 197980 seventeen households in Sedaka were broadcast \nsowing roughly 50 relong, or 15 percent of the acreage cultivated by villagers.\nFour seasons later (main season 198182), nearly 40 percent of Sedaka's land was broadcast. A clear majority of those \nwho broadcast are relatively well-to-do;43 these are normally the villagers who first innovate and who are best able\n41. Broadcasting has its drawbacks as well, and these together with its possible benefits are the subject of \nwide debate within the village. Debate centers on the yields that broadcasters may expect. Some say that \nbroadcast yields are as high or higher than for transplanting, while others claim yields are lower. I have \nobserved yields as low as six and eight gunny sacks per relong and as high as eighteen and twenty. One \nshould remember, of course, that the savings in production costs that broadcasting makes possible mean that \nyields only slightly below those of transplanted fields will entail no net loss to the farmer. What is certain, \nhowever, is that the crop from dry-sown paddy is far more variable than for transplanted rice and thus \ninvolves greater risk. A few poor farmers have tried dry sowing, lost much of their crop, and are wary of \nattempting it again. Quite apart from the advantages and disadvantages of broadcasting, the option is not open \nto all villagers. Dry sowing requires fairly flat field conditions and good water control. Unless the farmer's \nland has direct access to an adjacent canal, it requires permission from and coordination with the farmers \nthrough whose fields the water must pass during the irrigated season. This permission may not be \nforthcoming. These technical and social structures place some limits on the possible growth of broadcasting.\n42. The technique was not new; it was known to all but used only rarely before. The fact that the irrigated season \nof 1978 had been cancelled due to drought, that the next main seasonowing to the dryness of the soilwas late and \nthreatened to lap over into the subsequent irrigated season, and that combine-harvesting was now available \nundoubtedly encouraged the experiment.\n43. In the main season of 197980, for example, eight of seventeen broadcasters were among Sedaka's wealthiest \ntwenty-five families (per capita income), while only three were from among the poorest twenty-five.\n  \n< previous page\npage_122\nnext page >\n",

Even they were unlikely to broadcast more than half their land.44\nWhat is more surprising is that a few of the poorest villagers have also resorted to dry sowing. In each such case, the \ndecision to broadcast seems less of a calculated gamble than a response to the force of circumstances. Lacking the cash \nto pay transplanting costs and lacking the family labor either to exchange transplanting labor (berderau) or to transplant \ntheir own land, a few poor households have chosen to broadcast. For Bakri bin Haji Wahab (#7) who rents 4 relong \nfrom his father and whose wife has just given birth, broadcasting 3 relong was a means of conserving cash. For Wahid \n(#2), whose wife is ill and who felt he would earn more by leaving the village to do urban construction work at the time \nwhen the nursery is usually prepared, broadcasting half of his 6 rented relong both saved money and freed him for wage \nlabor. Most of the poor in Sedaka, however, are reluctant to take such risks unless they are forced to, and broadcasting is \nlikely, for the time being, to be confined largely to big operators. By the same token, it is precisely by transplanting the \nland of the larger farmers that poor women have earned most of their transplanting wages. As broadcasting gains \nground, poor households lose ground. How general broadcasting will become is impossible to predict, but it appears to \nhave the backing of the agricultural authorities in Muda.45\nThe second-order effects of combine-harvesting have thus been at least as massive as their direct impact. In addition to \nthe virtual elimination of cutting and threshing, the combine-harvesters have made gleaning impossible. They have \nfacilitated the shift to a new form of labor payment (kupang), which effectively lowers wages for what little work is left. \nThey have favored the growth of broadcast planting, thereby reducing by nearly half the wages for transplanting. They \nhave encouraged large landowners to dismiss small tenants in order to cultivate directly, and they have helped to create \na commercial class of tenants with the cash and machinery to lease in large tracts for long periods at premium\n44. There are other reasons for broadcasting as well. Nor, a well-to-do villager, farms six widely scattered \nplots; to establish six separate nurseries or transport mature seedlings from a single large nursery to the \nseparate plots would have been time-consuming and/or expensive. Thus he had decided to broadcast much of \nhis land. One or two others who have high land that must normally be planted later than the rest and is \ntherefore subject to deprivations from rats find that broadcasting allows them to get the crop in earlier, \nkeeping them in phase with surrounding fields.\n45. Thus the Operation Manual for the MUDA II Project has a section entitled \"Extension and Agricultural \nSupport Services,\" which in part reads as follows: \"He {that is, the specialist on rice agronomy} is responsible for \nthe continuous improvement of all aspects in agricultural management practices, including better land preparation, \nbetter planting techniques, such as the possibility of direct seeding.\" Despite these straws in the wind, MADA had \nnot, as of 1983, in fact adopted an \"official\" position on broadcast sowing.\n  \n< previous page\npage_123\nnext page >\n",

All, \nwithout exception, have driven down the incomes of poor households.46\nTaken collectively, however, we are not simply dealing with a quantitative growth in relative inequality but rather with \na series of quantitative changes that amount to a qualitative changewhere \"degree\" passes into \"kind.\" It is enough to \nobserve that a large farmer who broadcasts his seed and hires a combine-harvester when the crop is ripe need never \nemploy a single poor villager for wages. A large landlord, for his part, need never rent land to his poor neighbors nor \nhire them to work on his fields. The traditional economic connection between rich and poorthat is, wage labor and \ntenancyhas been all but sundered. We have on one side an increasingly commercial class of large operators and on the \nother side a far more numerous class of what might only loosely be called \"semiproletarians.\" The \"looseness\" is \nnecessary because, although they continue to hold on to their small paddy fields, they are decidedly less and less an \nagrarian proletariat, since production is now conducted largely without them. If they are to be a proletariat at all it will \nbe in the cities and plantations of Malaysia and not in the paddy fields where their services are no longer required.\nIn the meantime, a process of quasi proletarianization has already set ina process that links many villagers not to rice \nproduction at all, but to the urban economy outside Sedaka and indeed outside Kedah. If the first stage of double-\ncropping allowed smallholders to stay at home, the second stage has proven to be a dramatic reversal. The steady \nexodus that was a permanent feature of agrarian Kedah after World War II has again become a hemorrhage. Eight heads \nof households, seven from among the poorer village households, have since 1978 regularly left the village to find \ntemporary construction work in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and other urban centers. Still more would have left if they were \nnot, as they see it, too old for such work or were assured of finding jobs. Twelve married men have applied for \nresettlement schemes outside Kedah, although\n46. I have neglected, in this account, another form of \"mechanization\" that is not related to combine-\nharvesting but that has reduced the incomes of poor households substantially. This is the general use of \nmotorcycles to replace bicycles in the hauling of paddy in gunny sacks from the bund or granary to the main \nroad, where it is picked up by trucks, or directly to the mill. This work, called tarik by villagers, was \npreviously done by bicycles that both rich and poor generally possessed. Now the work, which often meant as \nmuch as M$100 or M$200 a season for poor families, is performed almost exclusively by motorcycles. The \ndistribution of motorcycles, however, is very highly skewed. More than three-quarters of the twenty-eight \nmotorcycles in Sedaka (1979) are owned by the wealthiest half of village households, and only one family \namong the poorest twenty-five households has one. Thus the proceeds from such lucrative labor, while \nremaining within the village, are now virtually the exclusive preserve of relatively well-off families.\n  \n< previous page\npage_124\nnext page >\n",

No doubt quite a few of them would have left eventually in any case, but the \nchanges in local land tenure and employment since 1977 precipitated their early departure.\nThe proximate cause for the exodus was the outright cancellation of the 1978 irrigated season due to drought. Losing an \nentire crop and the wage labor it might have brought was enough to send many small farmers and laborers to the city \ntemporarily. Those who stayed on in the village, accumulating debts, not only found that the next harvest was mediocre \nbut that their harvest earnings had been substantially reduced by competition from combine-harvesters. Many of them \nleft with their grown sons immediately after planting the subsequent crop, in the hope of recouping their losses and \nrepaying debts to pawnbrokers and shopkeepers.\nThe result was probably the largest emigration of villagers seeking work in memory.48 In a month or two of work most \nmarried men among them were able to save M$200 or more from their earnings to support their families back in \nSedaka. Although it is something of an exaggeration, one small tenant who joined the exodus said that ''the only ones \nremaining were those who were not up to the work.\"49 In nearby villages the exodus has been, if anything, even more \npronounced, and there is little doubt that, for those poor households and small farmers who remain in Sedaka, temporary \nwage-labor migration is becoming a way of life. So long as the urban economy provides this safety valve, it will be the \nonly means by which Sedaka's marginal families can maintain a foothold in the community.\nLocal Institutions and Economic Power\nThe Farmers' Association\nThe enormous impact that double-cropping in Muda has had on tenure, incomes, and social relations has inevitably \nfound expression in the character of local institutions. In Sedaka, this process can be seen most palpably in the brief \nhistory of the Farmers' Association, established by law in 1967 and designed originally to provide extension and credit \nfacilities for paddy production for all farmers in the locality. It may never quite have lived up to its original promise,\n47. Settlers must, in theory, be younger than forty-five years old, although in practice it is possible to bribe to \nhave an identity card (Kad pengenalan) altered to show a later birth date.\n48. The only possible exception was after a major drought and crop failure in 1954 in Kedah, when many able-\nbodied villagers left to find work on rubber estates and in the cities.\n49.Tinggal orang tak larat sabaja.\n  \n< previous page\npage_125\nnext page >\n",

The local branch in nearby Kepala Batas theoretically serves over twenty villages \nand a population of some eighteen hundred families. Only six hundred families have ever become members. The vast \nmajority of smallholders and tenants have never joined, judging the costs too great and the benefits too small. Local \nmembers of the Malay opposition political party (PAS), including many who are quite well-to-do, have never joined, \njudgingin most cases correctlythat the Farmers' Association was run by the state in the interests of the ruling party. The \nKepala Batas branch has, like most others, thus become the creature of rich peasants affiliated with UMNO.\nWhen farmers speak of the Farmers' Association they call it MADA, referring not to the Farmers' Association or its \nelected leadership, but to the government agency that directs its activities. Its main function, both as they view it and in \npractice, is the provision of production credit and fertilizer. Credit is allocated to members, on the basis of area farmed, \nto cover tractor costs (M$30 a relong for two passes in 1979) and fertilizer, which is supplied in kind.50 When the 1978 \nirrigated season was cancelled, creating much hardship, MADA also served as the manager of a large program of \ndrought relief (bantuan kemarau) consisting of generous wages paid to labor gangs for clearing draining and irrigation \ncanals. MADA also makes small loans for such ventures as fish ponds and beef cattle raising as well as organizes \noccasional \"study tours\" at state expense to such farflung places as Sumatra and Singapore. MADA is thus seen not so \nmuch as the seat of an autonomous Farmers' Association but as the font of credit and patronage distributed, above all, to \nits membership.\nThe principal beneficiaries of this largesse in Sedaka are the eighteen village members (sixteen families) listed in table \n4.10. They stand out in several respects from the village as a whole. All but two are from among the richest half of the \nhouseholds in Sedaka. Twelve are from the richest twenty families. They farm an average of 8.3 relong apiece, far \nabove the village mean, and, taken collectively, a total of 139.5 relong, or fully 43 percent of the total paddy land \ncultivated by villagers. Politically, all but two are members of the local branch of the ruling party.51 In fact, all but three \nof the UMNO households among the richest twenty families have joined the Persatuan Peladang.52 None of the seven\n50. Since 1979 fertilizer has been supplied through MADA to all farmers, whether members or not, thereby \nfurther reducing the potential benefits of membership.\n51. The two exceptions are Mat Buyong, an opposition PAS member who once paid dues to UMNO to hedge his \nbets and who has in any case not paid back his initial loan from MADA, and Kamil, who is a genuine fence-sitter \nconsidering moving to the UMNO camp.\n52. Two of these anomalies are also easily explained. One, Tok Mah, is a widow who would not join what is \nnearly exclusively a men's organization and another, Ghazali, although a discreet UMNO member, is also the son-\nin-law of the wealthiest PAS landowner in the village and wishes to avoid a too open identification with the local \nUMNO elite.\n  \n< previous page\npage_126\nnext page >\n",

So close is this linkage that the four \nelected leaders of the local unit of the Farmers' Association (Daud bin Haji Jaafar, son of #70, Basir, #64, Amin, #72, \nand Fadzil, #42) are precisely those who form the small cabal which, in practice, controls village politics. As for the \npoor of Sedaka, no matter which party they belong to, they are conspicuous by their almost complete absence from the \nFarmers' Association; only two have ventured to join.54\nThis small elite has profited substantially from its control over the Farmers' Association. In the matter of crop and \nproduction loans, the profiteering is most blatant. With four exceptions, the members of the Farmers' Association take \nloans for considerably more land than they actually farm (see table 4. 10). They thus assure themselves an additional \nloan at subsidized rates and a surplus of fertilizer they can sell at a profit to nonmembers.55 The salaried staff of \nMADA in Kepala Batas, where this petty but systematic loan fraud takes place, are well aware of what is happening. \nTheir complicity in registering inflated acreage represents their effort to keep their present membership and to avoid \nantagonizing the rural leadership of the ruling party. Thus Daud bin Haji Jaafar, son of the village headman (#70), \nregisters 30 relong and receives M$900 in cash when in fact he is entitled only to register 7 relong and borrow M$210; \nBasir (#64), shopkeeper and Sedaka's political kingpin, farms only 7 relong but takes loans for 20 relong, thus availing \nhimself of working capital at subsidized interest rates.\nIt is only by the most charitable definition that these production credits could in fact be termed \"loans.\" By June 1979 \nsix of the eighteen members had, in effect, transformed these loans into outright grants by the simple expedient of not \nrepaying them (the \"ineligibles\" of table 4.10). At least four others do not appear on the list of members, because they \ndefaulted on their loans some time ago and no longer bother to pay dues. Of the remaining twelve members in more or \nless good standing in mid-1979, at least twoBasir (#64) and Ghani Lebai Mar (#54)defaulted in the following season \nand became ineligible for further loans. Basir owes the Farmers' Association nearly M$2,000.\n53. Four of these seven families are, in effect, one extended family: Haji Kadir, his father, his sister and her \nhusband, and his daughter and her husband.\n54. One of these exceptions is Mat Buyong, whose special situation is described in n. 51 above, while the other, \nLebai Hussein, is the brother-in-law of the village headman, Haji Jaffar, while his son is treasurer of the local \nUMNO branch. Both are very close (ranks 34 and 35 respectively) to the middle of the village income distribution.\n55. The free fertilizer given to all farmers beginning with the main season of 197980 eliminated this advantage as \nwell as making loan repayments to MADA less attractive.\n  \n< previous page\npage_128\nnext page >\n",

Delinquency has grown despite the easing of repayment schedules following the drought in 1978, \nwhich hurt even well-to-do cultivators. The reasons for default, however, have nothing to do with the capacity of the \nmembership to pay. As a group, they come from that wealthy strata of the village that can most easily borrow from \nChinese shopkeepers or, more likely, finance production costs from their own ample savings. Thus the sanction of being \ndenied further credit from MADA is only a minor inconvenience for them, an inconvenience that is, moreover, far \noutweighed by the attraction of simply appropriating as much as M$2,000 in a de facto grant. They know, with a \npolitical wisdom born of experience, that they will not be prosecuted, and they lightheartedly ignore the letters they \nperiodically receive demanding repayment. As the local Agricultural Officer laments, \"It's because politics is mixed in; \nif we take action, the courts will press hard }for repayment{ and the political party wants the votes of the people.\"56 \nThe logic is impeccable but incomplete. Prosecuting for debt collection would not alienate the UMNO rank and file. It \nwould, however, alienate precisely that class of large farmers who form the rural leadership of UMNO in the village.57 \nA headlong pursuit of debtors would probably be the coup de grâce for the institution itself.\nThe partisan and class character of the Farmers' Association has never been in serious doubt. From the beginning, it has \nbeen run for and by that class of large cultivators and landowners affiliated to the ruling party. This acknowledged fact \nwas, in itself, not much more than a minor irritant in village politics and class relationsthe grating evidence that a small \noligarchy enjoyed privileged access to credit from the Persatuan Peladang. In mid-1978, however, the partisan character \nof MADA and the Farmers' Association became more visibly and acrimoniously manifest in the course of administering \na drought relief program. The drought, to the rare good fortune of many cultivators, coincided with the general election \ncampaign in 1978, thus allowing the ruling party to kill two birds with one stone through its patronage. MADA, with its \noffices scattered throughout the rice plain, a professional administrative staff, and strong ties to UMNO, seemed the \nlogical vehicle to distribute relief on a large scale. The results bore the distinctive marks of MADA's political and class \ncharacter.\nThe drought relief was designed as a labor-intensive public works program. In practice, the wages were more intensive \nthan the labor; many villagers received as much as M$80 for two days of canal clearing in a region where the typical\n56.Oleh Kerana politik campur kalau ambil tindakan, makamah nak tekan . . . dan parti politik mau suara \nrakyat.

Not incidentally, it would also almost certainly further erode the membership base of the Farmers' Association, \nthereby weakening its already hollow claim to speak for all farmers in the Muda region.\n  \n< previous page\npage_129\nnext page >\n",

The recruitment of laborers was preceded, in Sedaka, by a household-\nby-household survey conducted by Farmers' Association clerks inquiring about family size, income, and cultivated \nacreage, from which an index of eligibility was constructed based on need. Actual recruitment and supervision of work \nwas handled by the elected head of the small agricultural unit (Ketua yunit), who was, in this case, an UMNO stalwart, \nMat Tamin, from the adjoining village of Sungai Tongkang. Once the work was under way, the nearby MADA office \nwas besieged by a storm of complaints as it became clear that the partisan affiliation of the needy mattered a great deal. \nThus, for example, poor villagers known to favor PAS were lucky if they got to work once, while poor villagers linked \nto UMNO were hired an average of twice.58 Complaints were not confined to PAS members alone as even small \nfarmers favoring UMNO observed that wealthy members of their own party were taking full advantage of the \nopportunity to make easy money. The two sons of Haji Salim, an exceptionally wealthy farmer with 40 relong, lorries, \nand tractors, living just outside Sedaka, were each hired twice. Likewise, the son of the richest UMNO landowner in the \nvillage, Lebai Pendek (#73), was hired twice, while his other brother got the contract to build a chicken coop for the \nFarmers' Association as part of its relief programnetting him over M$500. Many PAS members applying for work were \ntold that no more forms were available. In the scramble for jobs, charges flew thick and fast: the heads of work gangs \nwere charged with listing fictitious workers and pocketing their pay, with extorting commissions from those they did \nhire, and with favoring their relatives and political allies. Villagers claimed that the unit chiefs who hired workers made \nanywhere from two to three thousand dollars each from the drought relief program. The residue of bitterness left by this \nmanipulation of drought aid was largely responsible for the overwhelming defeat of Mat Tamin by Farmers' Association \nmembers of his own party when he stood for reelection a few months later. The younger brother of Basir, who lives near \nthe village and serves as an Information Officer in the government, went so far as to claim that the scandals in \nadministering drought relief were directly responsible for the poor UMNO showing in many Muda constituencies in the \nsubsequent general election.\nThe Ruling Party in Sedaka\nTo speak of the membership of the Farmers' Association in Sedaka is to speak in the same breath of both the local \nleadership of UMNO and the \"officials\" of what passes as village government. Thus, thirteen of the eighteen current \nmembers of the Persatuan Peladang are now, or have been, elected by the local UMNO\n58. Eight UMNO members among the poorest twenty villagers were hired an average of two times, while the \ntwelve PAS members among the poorest twenty villagers were hired an average of 0.9 times.\n  \n< previous page\npage_130\nnext page >\n",

This count, however, masks a wide variation in how open and active this membership is. \nBeyond a small core of militants in each party, drawn in UMNO's case from among the most substantial villagers, there \nlies a rank-and-file membership whose affiliation is largely passive. Quite a few villagers, in fact, describe themselves \nopenly as Pak Turut (followers) only, who have affiliated with UMNO to \"be on the side of the majority\" (sebelah \nbanyak) and to qualify for petty patronage.\nThe benefits available to UMNO members are substantial. For wealthy villagers membership may mean the opportunity \nto receive a taxi license, a small business loan, a permit to operate a small rice mill or a lorry, or a local government job. \nAt the district UMNO annual meeting in early 1979, a prominent party leader from Guar Cempedak openly complained \nabout those who joined the fold simply to apply for a taxi license and then promptly ceased paying dues or attending \nmeetings once it was granted. For rank-and-file members the benefits are more modest but no less vital. The dream of \nmany young men to be accepted as a settler on a government land scheme is one likely to be realized only by those who \nhave cast their lot with UMNO, as political criteria are openly used in the selection process. A number of small grants-\nin-aid to cover the cost of school uniforms and exercise books are available to poor village families from the principal \nof the nearby primary school. These grants are awarded on the basis of a list provided by the local UMNO leader, Basir, \non which the names of children from poor PAS families rarely figure at all. Such patronage is, of course, supplemented \nby the distribution of loans and jobs conferred by the Farmers' Association, which works through the same interlocking \nvillage directorate.\nBy far the largest and most contentious distribution of patronage, however, occurred in late 1979, when the village was \nselected as a recipient of over M$20,000 in funds for a \"village improvement scheme\" (Rancangan Pemulihan \nKampung, RPK). As with the drought relief scheme, a census was conducted of each village household to determine its \nincome and needs, after which grants were made to families for such things as lumber, zinc roofing material, cement, \nseptic tanks, and toilets. We shall examine this episode in some detail later, but it is worth noting here that the funds \nwere distributed in a wholly partisan manner by the small \"gang of four\" who informally control UMNO and the Village \nDevelopment Committee: Basir, Daud bin Haji Jaafar (son of the head-\n59.

This was so true that by early 1980 it became possible to identify the political affiliation of \nvirtually each household in the village in the course of a casual stroll down the path; no elaborate interviews were \nnecessary. Houses with new roofs, new lumber in the walls, and/or a new outhouse were UMNO households and the \nremainder were PAS households.\nThe sociology of village UMNO is therefore a reasonably straightforward affair. It is dominated by a few well-off \nfamilies who have taken full advantage of the benefits of their rolebenefits that come almost entirely from government \npatronage of one kind or another. Much of the UMNO rank and file consists of families who are closely related to \nmembers of this petty oligarchy and/or who are often hired by them. Thus, ten of the sixteen poorest UMNO households \nhave strong ties of blood, marriage, or employment to wealthier UMNO households which, while they may not explain \nparty loyalty, at least serve to solidify it.61 Village UMNO is only the ultimate link in a vast chain of kinship and \npatronage that extends on to the mukim, the district, and the state. Outside the village, the importance of kinship \ndiminishes while the role of patronage is paramount. UMNO leaders at the district level are drawn disproportionately \nfrom among government clerks, schoolteachers, and wealthy farmers with business interests that depend on state loans \nor contracts. While the stakes are naturally greater at the apex of the party edifice than at the base, the cement that keeps \nthe structure intact at each level is recognizably similar.\nDespite the palpable advantages of UMNO membership, there are still many PAS members in the village, although, as \nan institution, the opposition can hardly be said to be thriving. A decade ago PAS members were a majority in Sedaka. \nSince then, however, the village headman, Haji Jaafar, and a few strategically placed families have switched sides, and \nthe bulk of the new households moving in have joined UMNO. The drift toward the ruling party was brusquely \nreinforced following the 1978 general elections, when the Kedah state government conducted a purge of all village \ndevelopment committees (JKKs) to ensure that their membership was exclusively from UMNO. In some villages that \nwere PAS-dominated, this entailed either abolishing the JKK or, more likely, appointing the one or two UMNO families \nin the hamlet to the JKK. In Sedaka it entailed throwing out the two members of PAS who had been elected to the JKK \nand who until then had helped preserve a facade of local nonpartisanship. Since then, PAS has led a shadowy local \nexistence. With the exception of a death benefit society (Khairat Kematian), which pays funeral costs for many party\n61.

Two of the remaining \nsixRazak (#1) and Bakri bin Haji Wahab (#7)have recently switched from PAS to UMNO and make no bones \nabout their desire to be considered for benefits such as school loans, short-term public works employment, etc.\n  \n< previous page\npage_132\nnext page >\n",

Open confrontation is rare, although a few shun Basir and boycott his \nstore. PAS members now have their own joke about the JKK. They call it jangan kacau kerja kami which, freely \ntranslated, means \"don't stick your nose into our business.\"62\nWith all the material incentives favoring membership in UMNO, it is the more surprising that such a large minority of \nSedaka's households should have so far resisted such blandishments. (See table 4.11)\nTable 4.11 · Political Affiliation of Households in Sedaka by Income Level, in Percentages\nOpposition \nParty \n(PAS)\nRuling \nParty \n(UMNO)\n \nFence- \nSitters\n \n \nTotal\n%\n(N)\n%\n(N)\n%\n(N)\n%\n(N)\nPoorest half of households\n54%\n(20)\n43%\n(16)\n3%\n(1)\n100\n(37)\nRichest half of households\n22%\n(8)\n73%\n(27)\n5%\n(2)\n100\n(37)\nEntire village\n38%\n(28)\n58%\n(43)\n4%\n(3)\n100\n(74)\n \nThe resistance is particularly marked among the poorest strata of the village, who are more than twice as likely to \nbelong to the opposition as are their wealthier neighbors. That a majority of the village should have affiliated with \nUMNO requires little explanation, given the manifest advantages. Why a majority of the poorer villagers (and a \nminority of the rich) have chosen, against their material interests, to remain in the PAS camp, however, does require \nanalysis. There appear to be several reasons. One is that the pattern of village partisanship has its roots in older, family-\nbased factions that existed well before the formation of political parties. Thus, Haji Kadir, the richest man in the village, \nwith his father and his two brothers in tow have constituted something of a minority faction in village politics for at \nleast thirty years. But since all four of these households are quite well-to-do, it only helps to explain what might be \ntermed the \"leading\" PAS faction and not the appeal of PAS to most of Sedaka's poor. For that explanation we must rely \non a combination of family ties, special material interests, UMNO strategy, and, not least, the moral appeal of the \nopposition. Family ties are influential in at least four or five cases of sons whose fathers (often not residents) have been \nopen and vociferous PAS supporters.\n62. The pun here is more effective in Malay by the use of the word kami, rather than kita, for \"we/us/our.\" \nKami is used when the person(s) spoken to are explicitly excluded from the group referred to as \"us.\"\n  \n< previous page\npage_133\nnext page >\n",

For in only seven of the twenty poorest PAS households can one find \nlinks of kinship or employment that might plausibly explain membership in the opposition. What is more striking is that \nthere are at least five poorer PAS members whose partisan affiliation is, as it were, not compatible with their apparent \neconomic intereststhat is, PAS members who depend upon UMNO members for much of their wage labor.\nSecond, with the exception of the very poorest, many PAS supporters have long been dues-paying members of a PAS \ndeath benefit society. Were they to leave PAS, they would automatically forfeit the right to funeral costs, in which they \nhave already made a substantial investment. In fact, the success with which PAS has tied this traditional form of social \ninsurance to party membership has prompted recent efforts by UMNO to copy the formula.\nThird, UMNO village strategy has not strongly encouraged substantial defections from PAS. The leadership of Sedaka's \nleading party has, it appears, adopted what game theorists have aptly called a \"minimal winning coalition\" policy. That \nis, having succeeded in controlling the village, they are not anxious to so enlarge their majority that the material \nadvantages of UMNO membership would be further diluted and dispersed.\nFourth, while little is to be gained materially from aligning with the opposition, PAS has considerable moral appeal. \nThis appeal stems only in small part from its claim to be more faithful to the tenets of Islam. PAS members, in this \nrespect, are no more outwardly observant or orthodox as a group than members of the ruling party in Sedaka. What is \ninvolved, rather, seems to be a fusion of class issues, ethnic and religious sentiment, and a populist opposition to \ngovernment policy and the inequalities it has fostered. Such a fusion is not surprising in view of the fact that PAS is the \nonly open, institutional vehicle of opposition that is toleratedif only barelywithin the Malay community.63 When poor \nPAS members talk about UMNO locally, they do not mean its rank and file, many of whom are as poor as they, but \nrather the wealthy families in Sedaka who run it and the coalition of government employees and rich landowners and \nbusinessmen with connections above them who control UMNO in the district. UMNO is, for them, nearly synonymous \nwith \"the haves\" (gologan berada) and with \"the government.\" Despite PAS's failure to win power in Kedah, it appeals \nto many poor farmers because it is \"a religiously informed popular movement for the defense of peasant interests.\"64 \nMembers of PAS in Sedaka emphasize that it represents only one race and one religion, while UMNO, with its coalition \npartners, cannot just defend Malays and their religion. Issues of race and religion\n63. Indicative of this was the widespread local disillusionment with PAS when, for a time, it joined the ruling \ncoalition. There were few actual defections from the party, but members commented bitterly, \"Datuk Asri \n(leader of PAS) makan gagi kerajaan\" (Datuk Asri is taking {literally, \"eating\"} a government salary).\"\n64.

Thus, as we shall see, notions about exploitation, about rights to \nemployment, land, and charityall vital material issuesfind expression through what are experienced as the norms of the \nMalay community and the requirements of Islam for pious conduct. To say that UMNO defends the well-off and has \ndone little or nothing to help the poorer farmers is at the same time to say that it has violated both Malay and Islamic \nvalues.65\nFinally, it would be a mistake to ignore the element of sheer pride and stubbornness that keeps PAS members from \nswitching parties, despite the price they pay in foregone patronage. Having held out for so long, they now make a virtue \nof what UMNO leaders might call necessity and are unwilling to give up the public and private satisfaction of having \nfollowed a political path without material rewards for the sake of principle. This atmosphere is strong and reinforcing \nenough so that Taib, a poor man who told friends he was thinking of switching at the urging of his wife, has not taken \nthe plunge because he says he fears the contempt for his opportunism that will come from his PAS friends. Recent \nepisodes of blatant partisanship in the village, such as drought relief and the ''village improvement scheme\" have served, \nif anything, to increase the bitterness and resolve of PAS members.\nArrayed against PAS is a formidable coalition of well-to-do families who have come to monopolize UMNO affairs in \nthe community. (See appendix C, table 4) The eleven villagers who are now, or have recently been, officers or members \nof the Village Development Committee farm an average of nearly 13 relong (close to three times the local average) and \nare, with a single exception, from among the wealthiest half of households.66 The other link that fuses their politics is \nthat all but two of the eleven are tied to the government by employment, licenses, or loans.67 In one or two cases these \nties antedated their political activity; for\n65. Many of the conclusions Kessler reached in his study of Kelantan are applicable in Kedah as well. As he \nnotes (ibid., 125), many of the leaders of PAS are drawn from the ranks of religious teachers, prayer leaders, \nand traditional headmen, many of whom feel threatened by the civil servants and licensed businessmen who \nappear to have taken over. There is, then, something of a displaced elite aspect to the PAS leadership. It is \nalso the case, as Kessler asserts, that PAS represents a \"revival and coalescence of the radical and Islamic \nvariants of Malay nationalism (p. 126).\"\n66. The average is particularly inflated, because the son of Haji Salim, a very wealthy entrepreneur owning 45 \nrelong and living, technically, just outside the village, is a member of the JKK.\n67.

What had initially, \nperhaps, been a mere political preference has become so cemented by the flow of material benefits as to make the \nchoice all but irreversible.\nThe \"inner circle\" of four men, noted earlier, who control not only UMNO but also the local unit of the Farmers' \nAssociation and the Prayer House (surau) Committee, are connected by a dense network of kinship ties. Thus, for \nexample, Basir is: the nephew of the village headman, whose son, in turn, is part of the inner circle; the uncle of another \nmember and, beyond this, also the nephew of Haji Salim, who is head of the district-level party. Basir's grandfather was \na subdistrict official (penghulu), and his brother is a full-time local employee of the Ministry of Information. He has \nparlayed his wealth, his family connections, and his considerable personal energy into a nearly unchallenged dominance \nof the local UMNO and the village unit of the Farmers' Association. He sits on the executive committees of the \ngovernment primary school, the private religious school (Sekolah Arab), the mosque, the cooperative rice mill, and the \nnearby market, all located in nearby Kepala Batas. His preeminence is not only acknowledged by other members of the \ninner circle but his role has far eclipsed that of the nominal village headman, Haji Jaafar, who chooses to remain a \nrespected bystander.\nThe UMNO leadership, then, is distinguished from its local competitor not only, or even primarily, by its wealth. The \nPAS leadership is also well-to-do, although it represents but a small minority of the \"substantial\" households.68 What \nhas come to distinguish Sedaka's UMNO leaders is their increasing reliance, as households, on various forms of state \npatronage and its privileged access to the institutions that distribute that patronage: the Farmers' Association, the \nsubdistrict chief (penghulu), the primary school, the district office, and so forth. To be sure, their influence is not \nexclusively based upon patronage. Kinship relations continue to tie many of the leaders to one another and to a portion \nof the rank and file. Such family ties are further elaborated and extended by traditional village institutions such as a \ndeath benefit society (khairat Kematian), a \"plate and bowl society\" (syarikat pinggan mangkuk), which lends crockery \nfor feasts, and rotating credit associations (kut)all of which function basically along party lines.\nWhat is largely missing from the village party today, however, is the social cohesion provided a decade ago by the \nenduring material ties of tenancy, employment, and charity. Before double-cropping, patronage was a largely village\n68. Sedaka is, perhaps, rather special in this respect. A study of large landowners in the Muda area has shown \nthat they are more or less evenly distributed among the two major Malay parties, UMNO and PAS. See the \nfine study by Mansor Haji Othman, \"Hak Millik Tanah Padi dan Politik di Kedah\" (Master's thesis, Universiti \nSains Malaysia, 1978), chaps. 13.\n  \n< previous page\npage_136\nnext page >\n",

As we have seen, \nthe economic opportunities presented by double-cropping have served to weaken, if not eliminate, this more traditional \nbasis of leadership. Having become well-nigh redundant in village rice production, the village poor have become, in \nturn, more socially redundant as well. Put differently, if the rich peasants of Sedaka now spend less time and effort \n\"cultivating\" their poorer neighbors, it is precisely because their poor neighbors are no longer cultivating their fields.\nThe votes of the poor are still important, but they can no longer be secured quite so automatically through pre-existing \neconomic and social ties. Politically, at least, the rich peasantry, which has always dominated Sedaka, is now composed \nincreasingly of dependent brokers rather than patrons in their own right. They now operate largely with \"borrowed\" \nresources that emanate directly from the state. These resources may provide them with the wherewithal to reinforce \ntheir waning social domination of village life, but by the same token they have become far more vulnerable. Their fate \nis now largely out of their own hands. So long as Malaysian growth, state revenue, and a national leadership solicitous \nof its rural constituency continue to prevail, they are in no real danger. Should any or all of these assumptions, which \nnow underwrite their position, cease to exist, however, they would find themselves in serious difficulty.\n  \n< previous page\npage_137\nnext page >\n",

It has at least the advantage of indicating how the \"big battalions\" of \ncontemporary agrarian changecommercialization, capital, and irrigationhave reordered the relations of production in a \nvery small place. To stop there, however, would merely add another small brick to an edifice that is the by now familiar \nand somewhat demoralizing story of the local effects of the green revolution.\nAs a social historyas human historythat account is inadequate. It is to real social history as the description of the \ntechnical features of an assembly line and a table of organization would be to a social history of the work force. To put \nthis another way, the previous chapter did no more than sketch the determinate conditions with which the peasantry of \nSedaka has had to come to grips.\nIf it is true that events are not self-explanatory, that they do not speak for themselves, it is also, alas, true that human \nsubjects do not entirely speak for themselves. If they did, it would suffice merely to turn on the tape recorder and offer a \ncomplete transcript to the reader. This social-scientist-as-recorder technique has been tried with illuminating results, \nmost notably by what might be called the \"Oscar Lewis school of anthropology.\" Even Oscar Lewis, however, has \nfound it necessary to arrange and edit the transcript and to add a preface or postscript. The necessity arises, I believe, for \nat least three reasons. First, the human subjects themselves often speak with a kind of linguistic shorthandwith similes \nand metaphors that they have no need to clarify to their neighbors but that would, without explanation, mystify an \noutsider. Thus, the fact that someone in Sedaka said of another villager that \"he behaves like Razak\" or that an \nAmerican said of someone that he \"struck out\" when looking for a job, remain opaque until we know something about \nRazak and about baseball, respectively. Second, there are larger orders of meaning and coherence that human subjects \n\"know\" but have no need to verbalize in the taken-for-granted world of daily discourse. The standards for decorum at a \nfuneral, the expectations about what gifts are appropriate for certain occasions might fall into this category. Such \nstandards are, as it were, embedded in the pattern of activity and are only, if\n  \n< previous page\npage_138\nnext page >\n",

Finally, the observer may find certain themes or values that appear to unify what might otherwise appear to be \nseparate realms of practice, belief, or discourse. Ideals of \"manhood\" in some Mediterranean societies are a possible \ncase in point.1 Here, the observer is creating a synthesis or interpretation that is perhaps consistent with the record but is \nunlikely ever to be consciously thought or spoken by those who have created that record. Such interpretations are, as \nGeertz notes, \"our own constructions of other people's [the human subjects in question] construction of what they and \ntheir compatriots are up to.\"2\nThe problem necessarily arises of how to evaluate these constructions; on what basis is one construction to be preferred \nover another? The conceptual ground is treacherous here and proof, in the strict sense of natural sciences, is unavailable. \nNevertheless, some standards of evidence and inference are possible. Such constructions should be economical and, at \nthe very least, consistent with the practices and beliefs they purport to illuminate. To the degree that they also make \nsense of what would otherwise be unrelated or anomalous data from the record of human action, they are to be preferred \nover competing constructions. One final standard by which interpretations might be judged is the object of considerable \ndispute; it is that our interpretation or characterization should, in principle, be found plausible by those whose actions \nare being interpreted. The problem here, of course, is not only that all human actors have interests that lead them to \nconceal or misrepresent their intentions, but that this standard must also contend both with Freudian doctrine that judges \nmany motivations to be inaccessible to the actor and with the notion of \"false-consciousness.\" Thus, while it may be \nunrealistic to insist that human actors confirm our construction of their actions, we can insist that our interpretations \ntake account of the full range of self-descriptions they do offer.\nThe last ten years have been momentous for the villagers of Sedaka and for their compatriots on the Muda Plain. One \nwould be hard-pressed to find another decade in which their material life and production relations changed so \ndramatically or in which older patterns of social and economic life came unstuck so radically.3 These are the gross facts \nall villagers have had to grapple with, to\n1. A healthy skepticism is surely called for when such claims are made. This is particularly the case when \nsupposedly unifying themes are detached from their historical roots and appear to hover over a culture like \nsome Hegelian spirit. This brand of \"idealism\" makes human actors into mere vectors or pawns of ideas that \nare, after all, human creations. Only when such ideas are linked firmly to the historical conditions that have \nfavored their appearance and influence and that could, if altered, spell their weakening or disappearance do \nthey merit being taken seriously at all.\n2.

It should not surprise us that their constructions of what has happened, its meaning, who is \nto blame, and what it all portends should vary greatly. There are significant variations by individual, by age, by status, \nand, not least, by property relationsthat is to say, by class. Whose ox is being gored makes a striking difference. One \ncannot expect a landless laborer to look on combine-harvesters with quite the same equanimity or satisfaction as does \nthe large-scale farmer. And yet their divergent experiences and interests form part of the same community of discourse. \nTheir disparate and often contradictory understandings of events are intended to speak to, to appeal to, one another and \nare fashioned from the same cultural materials available to all.\nWhat follows here and in the next chapter is thus an attempt to describe and analyze the beginnings of this new \nexperience of class in Sedaka.\nIf, in the last chapter, I surveyed the impact of the green revolution with the eyes of an economic or social historian, in \nthis chapter I propose to survey the same events through the partisan eyes of two sets of villagerswinners and losers. \nDepending on whom one talks to, there are at least two green revolutions at work here. Before plunging in however, it \nshould be perfectly obvious that class is hardly the only social experience available to villagers. Factions, \nneighborhoods, and kinship ties, to mention only a few, create their own fracture lines, which do not often coincide \nneatly with class. Villagers are also united for some purposes with their local antagonists as members of the same ethnic \ngroup, the same religion, the same village, the same sector of the economy (paddy). Depending on the issue and context, \nthese other experienced selves may be decisive. What is undeniable, though, is that property relations have become far \nmore salient since double-cropping. But property relations are, as always, rather tangled and do not serve to divide the \nvillage neatly in two or three parts like some sharp sociological scalpel. Each aspect of the changes since 1972 defines a \nsomewhat different collection of winners and losers; small landowners who would like to expand their farms by renting, \nfor example, may share a distaste for leasehold tenancy with the poor while not sharing their aversion to the use of \ncombine-harvesters. And yet, as we shall see, there is enough of a cumulative impact at the top and at the bottom of the \nvillage stratification to provide the existential basis for the generation of something like a class point of view.\nThe \"poor\" for the purposes of this analysis will generally mean the thirty-seven households with the lowest per capita \nincome. The \"rich,\" in turn, refers to those twenty-five households with the highest per capita incomes.4 While per \ncapita income is, by itself, a better measure of local class position than total\n4. In practice, however, a disproportionate amount of the actual material comes from the poorer strata of \"the \npoor\" and from the richer strata of \"the rich.\" This is the case, I think, both because the class interests of those \nat opposite ends of the class spectrum are less ambiguous and because I chose to devote more time listening to \nthe poorest and the richest.\n  \n< previous page\npage_140\nnext page >\n",

Apart from a \"zone of agreement,\" only those views of double-cropping and its \nconsequences that divided the rich and the poor and that were held by a substantial number of either group are discussed.\nIn a village deeply embedded in a larger economy, where a share of the local paddy land is owned by outsiders and \nwhere villagers seek work and land outside the community, class issues can hardly be confined to the local sphere alone. \nMost of these issues, however, have a clear local manifestation. Thus, for virtually every change in production relations \nthat the poor have come to resentfor example, mechanization, rents in advance, decline in charity, shifts in wage \nratesthere are local, as well as outside, targets for their resentment. For a few mattersmost notably leasehold \ntenancywhich are most definitely class issues, there are few local antagonists. Here the \"winners\" are largely outside the \nvillage, and most of the local population is largely in accord although, as we shall see, at quite different levels of \nenthusiasm.\nShips Passingand Signalingin the Night\nTwo brief commentaries on the present state of affairs in Sedaka will serve to illustrate how the facts reported in the \nprevious chapter can take on widely divergent meanings. I have chosen them to highlight a style of argument and for the \ncontrast they provide. But they are neither the most divergent examples available nor the least. They are, in fact, fairly \nrepresentative. Presented here with a minimum of interpretation, their meaning in the larger discourse between winners \nand losers will become apparent only later.\nPak Yah, a landless laborer with eight children, has always been hard-pressed to make ends meet. His situation is \nreflected not only in his house, which is a better maintained version of Razak's, but in his nickname. He is called Yah\n5. For example, Hamid (#38) is in the middle of the income distribution, but nearly all villagers think of him \nas well-to-do since he owns nearly 10 relong and a tractor. It is his gambling, they say, that has forced him to \nlease out his land, thus making him appear temporarily poorer. Fadzil (#42) and Abdul Rahman (#41) are \nanalogous cases, each being a substantial landowner; the former, however, has had to lease out some of his \nland to pay for a recent purchase of paddy land while the latter has had a string of crop failures. Both are \nconsidered among the well-to-do. Another anomalous case is Tok Mahmud (#56), who has always been a \nfairly poor man but is now a widower with only a single granddaughter at home. His per capita income is thus \nrather high, but villagers, taking a longer view of his life history, place him among the poor.\n  \n< previous page\npage_141\nnext page >\n",

It is at the same time a \nreference to his poverty, since he can seldom afford more than the 30¢ minimum purchase and must therefore buy oil \ndaily. Unlike Razak, he is widely regarded as an honest and reliable worker. I have heard him complain bitterly before \nabout the difficulty of finding work and about his futile efforts to rent in even a small piece of paddy land. On this \noccasion, however, he is angrier than usual about having been denied any of the funds recently distributed by local \nUMNO leaders as part of the Village Improvement Scheme (RPK). Spurred on by a couple of neighbors (Nor and Mat \n\"halus\"), who were also ignored at the handout, he launches into a more global assessment of the situation.\n\"The well-to-do are throwing those who are hard up aside.\" \"The more we want to lift ourselves, the more we are \npushed down, the more cruel {they are to us}.\" \"They want to bury us.\"7 As he says this last phrase, Pak Yah thrusts the \nheel of his hand toward the ground at his feet as if pushing something into the earth and adds, \"We want to be higher.\" \nTo illustrate what he means, he notes that in the past it was possible to get loans of rice from well-off villagers. But \nnow, he claims, they sell their rice for cash and then claim they have no money.\nThis last charge, which I had heard several times before from other poor villagers, deserves some comment. The \ntraditional medium for loans and advances was, fittingly, paddy or polished rice (beras), the basic food staple. Loans of \ncash were exceptionally rare, as they are today. The poor appear to believe that the sale of paddy for cash is, in part, an \nattempt by the wealthy to avoid being importuned for loans. Having sold most of their harvest, the rich can now claim \nthat they have only enough paddy to feed their own family and that their cash is spent. This procedure has the added \nadvantage of concealment, for while it is generally possible to know whether a man's granary is full, it is not possible to \nknow whether he has any cash.8\n6. Malay nicknames are typically formed by the last syllable of the given name: thus, Osman becomes \"man\"; \nZakariah becomes \"Ya\"; Ahmad becomes \"Mat.\" Appended to these nicknames is usually a reference to some \npersonal characteristic of the individual or to his father or grandfather. Thus Mat Din is known, behind his \nback, as \"Mat Kabur\" (kabur is a coconut palm beetle that he is said to resemble); Mat Sarif is known as ''Mat \nRabit\" (rabit means \"torn\" and is shorthand for his harelip); Jamil is known as Jamil Pak Ngah (Pak Ngah is a \nreference to his father, who as middle son was called Ngah, a shortening of tengah meaning \"middle\").\n7.Orang senang tauk orang susah ke-tefi.

This debate is, moreover, cast in terms of rich \nand poor, although the immediate issue that has aroused Pak Yah's ire is one between UMNO members, by no means all \nof whom are rich, and PAS members, by no means all of whom are poor.\nOn an afternoon nearly a month later, I am listening to much the same group assembled below Pak Yah's house, and the \nanger at the partisan distribution of patronage is still rife. Their anger is focused particularly on what they regard as a \nfraudulent survey of households conducted before allocations were made. One of the questions the clerk asked was, \nquite literally, \"Where do you shit?\" Pak Yah's reply was to squat on the ground, flick his heel, and then to add that he \neven \"had to shit on someone else's land.\" This expression is the standard, in village parlance, for real poverty.10\nWhen the money was handed out, however, it was clear that the survey had been a mockery. As Pak Yah says, it was \n\"thrown in the trash.\" He then does a short pantomime of a clerk checking a list of names with his index finger. \"They \nsay Pak Yah is well-to-do, even Dullah is well-to-do, even Sukur is well off.\"11 Those assembled find this hilarious as \nthey know that these three house-\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nwhich wealth is more easily hidden.

Pak Yah continues his sketch: \n\"They say Lebai Pendek is hard up, Shamsul is so hard up they have to give him house paint, Abu Hassan is hard up.\" \nThese three men are, of course, from among the wealthiest UMNO supporters in the village, and all received assistance. \nThe ridicule is so biting in large part because the village UMNO leadership wantonly disregarded its own facade of fair, \nimpersonal procedures in order simply to reward themselves and their followers. Once again, however, the issue is cast \nin terms of rich and poor and the distortion of the facts by wealthy UMNO leaders.\nIf we listen briefly to other villagers, however, we hear a very different story. The occasion for this story was special. It \nwas not, like most of my conversations with villagers, simply a casual encounter. When Haji Kadir, his brother-in-law \nTok Kasim, and his son-in-law Ghazali sat down to talk with me one evening, it was clear that they had something to \nsay which they had worked out together. The context in which they came was undoubtedly significant. I had spent much \nof the previous two weeks threshing paddy along with many of the poorer men in the village.12 In the course of the \nwork I had come to know quite a few heads of poor households whom I had known only slightly before. Their concerns \nabout the loss of work to combine-harvesters and the decline of \"charity\" payments (zakat peribadi) previously given to \nthreshers had found its way into the questions I had begun to ask other villagers. These three men appeared to be \nconcerned that I was getting the wrong picture; they had come to set me straight.13 All three were, as one might expect, \nwell-off by village standards. Haji Kadir (Pak Ceti) is, of course, the richest man in the village; his son-in-law farms 8.5 \nrelong, much of which he can expect to inherit; and his brother-in-law farms 6 relong, most of which he owns.\nHaji Kadir begins with a rhetorical question: \"Why is it,\" he asks, \"that we call some people poor when they are really \nwell-off, and others well-off when they are really poor?\" He then proceeds to answer his own question with some\n12. The rhythm of hand threshing normally requires that two men work at each threshing tub; while one is \nfetching a bundle of paddy stalks, the other is flailing the grain into the tub. Whenever I found that there were \nan odd number of threshers I would join the \"odd man out\" when invited. Although I was a good deal slower \nat threshing than most, my partner benefited since he collected the piece-rate (then M$2 per gunny sack) for \nthe grain we both threshed.\n13. It is of course true that my presence is the stimulus for their small \"presentation.\" The argument they are \nmaking to me is not an argument they would bother making directly to Pak Yah. In this sense, what they say is \nartificialan argument designed to impress and convince an outsider who might be powerful. What is notable, \nhowever, is that in making their case they must necessarily fall back on the values and standards embedded in \nvillage life and make more explicitfor someone quite ignorantwhat could perhaps be conveyed among them by a \nmere gesture or phrase.\n  \n< previous page\npage_144\nnext page >\n",

They are \ntwo of only five heads of household who own no paddy land and have no prospect of inheriting any but nonetheless \nhave incomes that put them well above the median for the village. Kamil has, for decades, been the largest tenant in \nSedaka and now farms 15 relong of productive paddy land, while Mat Khir rents in only two relong but has a stable and \ncoveted job with a successful Chinese shopkeeper and paddy dealer in the nearby town. Both men are able to provide \ncomfortably for their large families. They are striking exceptions to the general rule that landowning is the basis of \nwealth in the village. And yet, as Haji Kadir implies, their income is more precarious than that of a landowner and each \nmust work unstintingly to achieve it.\nHaving cited two cases of families who are poor in property but nevertheless manage to do well by virtue of their \nresourcefulness, Haji Kadir takes up the opposite side of the coin. Here the examples he uses are Hamzah and his older \nbrother, the ever-serviceable Razak. \"They have property, they have land,\" says Haji Kadir, \"as much as 2 or 3 relong, \nso much that they rent it out like big landlords.\" With the vigorous assent of his companions, Haji Kadir notes that, if \nHamzah and Razak were clever and thought ahead, they could plant this land and harvest twenty to thirty gunny sacks \nof paddy a year, enough to feed their families. The fact that they do not is not because they are poor but because they \nare not \"resourceful.\" Again, the illustrations are carefully selected. Only five of the poorest fourteen villagers own any \npaddy land at all, and Razak and Hamzah are among them. Strictly speaking, neither actually owns the land, inasmuch \nas they do not have the capital to pay the fees and Islamic inheritance tax (faraid) required to transfer ownership from \ntheir long-since-deceased father.15 Nor is it clear that Hamzah would get title to the 2 relong his mother has let him rent \nout, as there are claims on the land by two additional sons who live outside the village. At the moment, Hamzah rents \nout his 2 relong as does Razak his .25 relong. Both claim that the loss of work during the drought-cancelled season, \ntheir large families, and their reduced wage-labor earnings make it impossible for them to finance a rice crop through \ntill harvest. Hamzah actually planted a crop in the irrigated season of 1977 but claimed that he had to sell the standing \npaddy in the field before harvest to feed his family. But Haji Kadir and his friends obviously believe that it is \nimprovidence, not poverty, that\n14. \"Resourceful\" seems the best translation for pandai pusing, which literally means \"clever at moving \naround.\" \"To hustle,\" \"to be diligent,\" or ''to shift for oneself\" also capture the spirit of this verb.\n15. This process, known locally as ambil kuasa (to take legal title), costs roughly M$50 for legal fees plus 1 \npercent of the estimated market value of the land for the Moslem inheritance tax.\n  \n< previous page\npage_145\nnext page >\n",

Who is correct is a matter of charged opinion that no resort \nto financial evidence alone could settle.\nTok Kasim and Haji Kadir then address themselves to the case of Hamzah in particular, taking it for granted that \nRazak's reputation speaks for itself. Although they stop short of calling Hamzah lazy, they do claim that he is \"not very \nindustrious.\"16 \"That's why,\" Tok Kasim says, \"we don't much want to give him assistance or work all the time.\" \"He \nhas property; he's like us.\" When I ask who, then, is really poor in the village, they manage, after some discussion, to \ncome up with three possible candidatesPak Yah, Mansur, and Mat ''halus,\" all of whom, they say, would be \"finished\" if \nthey fell ill and could not work. The rest, they claim, are either not so badly off or are not resourceful.\nWarming to the main theme after having been sidetracked momentarily by my question, Haji Kadir returns to the \nproblem of those who ask for work and alms in bad faith. As an exhibit, he offers his nephew Hashim, from Yan. He \nregularly comes shortly before the harvest, Haji Kadir claims, to announce that he will help thresh and to ask for a \nportion of his wages in advance. When threshing time comes, however, he often goes to Megat Dewa in the neighboring \nstate of Perlis where the wages and zakat gifts are better. Once, he adds, Hashim told him in the evening, after having \nbeen given an advance, to have the coffee ready early next morning as he would be coming to thresh. Early next \nmorning Haji Kadir spied him walking along the canal to the south of Sedaka, but he turned off to work for someone \nelse. He also suspects that the rice he and two other relatives had given Hashim before Hari Raya (Ramadan) was sold \nrather than eaten, and he once told Hashim that he should beg rice only from those for whom he threshes. Still, he \ncontinues, Hashim has come begging every year for the past decade like clockwork. When Haji Kadir offered to rent \nhim nearly 2 relong he owns in Megat Dewa for a couple of years, Hashim declined. \"He wasn't that interested,\" \nconcluded Haji Kadir.17\nHashim is thus assimilated to the cases of Razak and Hamzah. None of them, by this account, are particularly interested \nin work; none are particularly resourceful, except perhaps when it comes to asking for alms or for wages in advance. \nSome, if not all of them, are pretty well-off after all. And certainly none of them, to judge by their conduct and \nresources, are worthy of the sympathy and help they have gotten.\nThe discourse, at a distance, between Pak Yah and Haji Kadir is as remarkable for what it ignores as for what it \nincludes. The material facts of the present situationwage rates, the loss of fieldwork, actual loans and charity given and \nreceivedare conspicuous by their relative absence. Perhaps this is merely because they are taken for granted as common \nknowledge. What is emphasized, however, are the social facts, the quality of human relations.

Just as in the \nstories of Razak and Haji Broom, there is a text here on what decent and seemly social relations should be.\nWhat is also striking is the attempt in these opinions to \"place\" people both in terms of their actual economic situation \nand in terms of social reputation. Pak Yah derides the village leadership for willfully distorting the \"facts\" of poverty \nand affluence to serve their own purposes. Haji Kadir devotes a great deal of effort to showing how it is that many of \nthe poor are responsible for their own poverty and to distinguishing real destitution from feigned destitution. Why this \nstruggle over the \"facts\" should be such a central feature of the dialogue between rich and poor in Sedaka will become \nclearer as we proceed.\nTwo Subjective Class Histories of the Green Revolution\nAt the core of the social experience of class is the growth of a distinctive and shared understanding of historyan \nunderstanding that sets one class apart from others. Taken collectively, these perspectives amount to a shared worldview \nembodying both standards of justice and their application to events past and present. One could, for example, capture a \ngreat deal of the worldview of different classes in France from an examination of their outlook on the major watersheds \nof French history: the revolutions of 1789 and 1848, the Paris Commune, the Popular Front, Vichy, and May 1968. In \nthe tiny world of Sedaka, the shifts in production relations associated with double-cropping define such a historical \nwatershed. What makes these shifts decisive for class relations is simply the fact that their impact has marked out \nwinners and losers largely along class lines. As a set of historical experiences they have provided both the basis and the \noccasion for muted struggles between rich and poor.\nDespite the painful setbacks the poor have suffered in the past few years, there is no question of a class war developing \non the Muda Plain now or in the foreseeable future. The prospect is rather one of continuing class struggle, sporadic \nresistance, and the war of words we have already witnessed. There are several reasons why escalation is unlikely. First, \nit is undeniable that nearly half the village is better off than they were before double-cropping. Whatever their residual \ndissatisfactions and fears, they can be counted, by and large, as winners. Second, those who have seen their fortunes \nreversed are rarely at the brink of a crisis that would threaten their livelihood or subsistence. The options they face of \nbelt tightening, temporary and permanent migration, a marginal subsistence in the village are surely painful but are \nnothing like the draconian choices faced by their counterparts in Indonesia or India. Third, the social structure of Sedaka\n  \n< previous page\npage_147\nnext page >\n",

This is not Morelos in 1910. The \nstratification of Sedaka, while not a seamless web from top to bottom, is diverse enough to militate against the creation \nof a solid phalanx of victims. The presence of bystanders and neutrals tempers what might otherwise be a sharper \nconflict. Finally, the local conflict that does exist is further tempered by the fact that virtually all paddy cultivators share \ncertain interests (for example, Malay political domination and a high support price for paddy) despite their class \nantagonisms. All of these factors make for \"ordinary\" forms of class struggle rather than a conflagration.\nI turn, with these qualifications in mind, to a brief social history of Sedaka's green revolution by class. I shall ask how \neach of the major changes in production relations has been experienced and interpreted by the rich and by the poorby \nwinners and losers. From these interpretations, which can be seen as two, class counterpoints to the economic facts \npresented in the previous chapter, it should be possible to construct a picture of village class relations.\nDouble-Cropping and Double Vision\nThere are by now scores of studies of the consequences of double-cropping in Muda, many of them quite sophisticated. \nReflecting the interests of international donors and the Malaysian state, they are virtually all concerned with production, \nincomes, and growth. In their entirety, it might seem they offer a more or less exhaustive account of the consequences \nof the green revolution in Kedah.\nWe should scarcely be surprised, however, if the overall assessment of double-cropping held by the actual participants \nin this drama differs significantly in tone and content from the official account. After all, the participants have their own \nnarrow and homely concerns. Nor should it surprise us if the vantage point of the well-to-do should diverge sharply \nfrom that of the poor. If one asks villagers about the impact of double-cropping, what emerges is a core zone of general \nagreement that gives way to a zone of dispute as well as a zone of differences in perspective. It is in these last two zones \nthat class is decisive.\nVirtually everyone agrees that double-cropping has brought with it some beneficial changes. They note the rebuilding \nand patching of houses, the fact that only two of the richest villagers had motorcycles before 1972 while many of the \nwealthier households now have them, that the roads and bus service now allow them to visit Alor Setar and nearby \nrelatives. But the big news that completely overshadows these welcome conveniences is the simple fact that, for the first \ntime in living memory, virtually everyone has enough rice to eat throughout the year. Even well-off villagers rarely fail \nto mention this, for they can remember crop failures when even their supply gave out. For the poor, of course, the basic \nfear that has always plagued the peasantry has been all but\n  \n< previous page\npage_148\nnext page >\n",

It is the first thing that comes to their minds: \"Even the poor can hold out now, they can eat\" (Dullah); \n\"There's enough rice\" (Sukur); \"The rice is never used up.\" (Wahid). Their subsequent complaints about recent \nhardships must be seen against the backdrop of this cardinal achievement. And yet, one may look in vain through piles \nof official reports to find any recognition of the single result of double-cropping that dominates all others so far as the \npeasants are concerned.\nBeyond this narrow but important zone of consensus, evaluations diverge. Neither the rich nor the poor of Sedaka are \nuniformly enthusiastic about the changes double-cropping has brought about. Given the recent setbacks the poor have \nexperienced, their complaints are to be expected. The complaints of the larger farmers, however, are curious, since they \nhave been the principal beneficiaries of this highly touted scheme. At first one is tempted to refer their grumbling to a \nuniversal human (at any rate, peasant) perverseness that only grudgingly admits to good fortune, but the nature of their \ncomplaints betrays an unmistakeable class perspective. They are resentful, above all, that it is no longer possible to buy \nland. Thus Haji Kadir says that things were \"better before\" irrigation when \"we could save money and buy land at only \nM$1,000 a relong.\" Kamil, who rents 15 relong, grumbles that he is no better off now than he was ten years ago and that \nland is now out of reach. What is involved here is not only a nostalgia for the days when land went for M$1,000 a \nrelong but also for the days when poor smallholders were forced by debts (jual janji) to forfeit their land to creditors. \nThis is, in fact, how Haji Kadir and others made their small fortunes. Kamil senses that this avenue of mobility is now \nclosed to him.\nThis does not exhaust their complaints. They grumble about the high cost of living, the difficulty and expenses of \ngetting fieldhands when they need them, and the fact that even they often need loans. In more reflective moods, \nprosperous villagers occasionally regret the loss of leisure and the entertainment they once enjoyed between the harvest \nand the next plantinga time when most of their poorer neighbors were off looking for work. Now they are busy all year \nround. They miss especially the small feasts, games, and Islamic chanting that had graced the off-season before 1972.18 \nSeldom is this lament terribly acute, for no one would be willing to forego a second crop of rice in order to recover \nthese cultural amenities.\n18. The feast they most often mention is the kenduri berendul, literally \"cradle feast,\" celebrated for recently \nborn infants, which includes a ceremonial haircutting and, for girls, circumcision. During my stay this was \ncelebrated only twice. The games they mentioned included main gasing, or competitions with spinning tops, \nand bersilat, the Malay/Indonesian act of self-defense, both of which are very rarely seen today. The Islamic \nchanting from the Koran includes berdikir and berzanji, which are still occasionally performed, often by \ngroups that are paid a fee, at feasts in the village. All of these activities are described as hiboran, or \n\"entertainment.\"\n  \n< previous page\npage_149\nnext page >\n",

All these families have benefited \nsubstantially, to judge from their incomes and possessions. And yet, many of them acknowledge no improvement; they \nsay things are about the same as before. If pressed, they may admit to some slight easing: \"I'm a bit better off\"; \"We \ndon't have to scrimp so\"; \"We can just get enough to eat.\"19 When it comes to what irrigation has done for the village \npoor, though, these men are far more expansive. To hear them tell it, the poor have done very well. One of them says, \n\"Since the change in seasons, even coolies (that is, landless laborers) are using motorcyles.'' Another, complaining of \nthe cost of labor, insists that wage workers have become so comfortable that they can afford to be choosy. They often \nclaim that nowadays the poor are as comfortable (senang) as the rich were before double-cropping. In effect, they \ngreatly underplay their own gains and at the same time overdramatize the new prosperity of the poora pattern that we \nshall see repeated.\nFor villagers in more precarious circumstances, matters are more straightforward. After acknowledging that their basic \nfood supply is secure, they generally go on to emphasize how their prospects have worsened. As Hamzah notes, \"I work \nnonstop, {but} there's not a chance of becoming comfortable.\" He and others in the same boat contrast the substantial \ngains of the well-off with their own difficulty in providing their families with necessities such as fish, clothing, and \nschool expenses. While the rich complain that they have no leisure, the poor have the mirror-image complaint: that they \nhave no work. They can and do recite in minute detail who hired them and how much they earned in the past, \ncomparing that income with the current lack of work. For them, unlike the rich, the watershed is not the beginning of \ndouble-cropping but the entry of combine-harvesters. Their sense of time, the significant dates in their lives, are \nnecessarily different, as is their experience. A majority of them, it is true, are almost certainly no worse off than they \nwere prior to the irrigation scheme. But their point of reference is now the first four or five years of double-cropping \n(197276) when work was plentiful and wages high. It is from that point that they measure their current hardships and it \nis perhaps only in the context of these hardships that the early years of irrigation have become \"the good old days.\"\nAt the core of this reversal of fortunes, in their view, is not simply the impersonal working out of technological change, \nbut the elimination of human dependencies. Karim, whom Haji Kadir once cited as a rare example of the hard-working \npoor, captures the perspective of many poor villagers. Before, he\n19.Sudah tambah sikit; tak kena layang macham dulu; boleh makan saja. Layang means \"to slice thinly,\" \nhence \"to scrimp.\"\n  \n< previous page\npage_150\nnext page >\n",

Mansur, another landless villager, covers much the same ground as he \ndeplores the evaporation of postharvest zakat peribadi he once received from cultivators for whom he threshed but who \nno longer need his help. The village poor, then, not only realize precisely what they have lost in wages, in work, and in \ngifts but are quite well aware that they are no longer an integral part of rice production at all.21\nFrom Living Rents to Dead Rents\nFixed cash rents payable before planting were not unknown before double-cropping, but it was only with the expanding \ncash economy after 1971 that they became the rule rather than the exception. We encounter once again a nearly \nintractable zone of disagreement about the facts when it comes to determining how many tenants actually lost part or all \nof their farms when the switch to prepaid rents was made. Estimates range from a maximum of about ten to a minimum \nof three or four. The higher figure is closer to the village consensus while the lower figure finds support among a \nhandful of wealthy villagers. There seems no way to decide the matter. Razak, for example, had rented 5 relong under \nthe traditional arrangements from his older brother (an outsider) until 1972, when his brother announced that he was \ntaking it back to give to his own son to cultivate. Razak claims that his brother used this as an excuse to kick him off the \nland and gives as evidence the fact that two seasons later his brother rented the land out again to a new tenant, with the \nrent to be paid in advance. The story is plausible, in part, because dismissing a tenant to give the land to one's own child \nis one of the few ways of displacing a tenant that is seen as legitimate. For precisely that reason, it is often viewed as a \npoly used by landlords who wish to act discreetly. But it is impossible to be certain of the facts in this case or in many \nothers, where the landlord claims that the tenant simply decided to give up the land. In any event, the \"damage estimate\" \nattributed to the shift to sewa tunai is extensive if one listens to most villagers and relatively paltry if one listens to a \nfew of the wealthiest.\nFor those who rent out land on any appreciable scale, the advantages of sewa tunai are obvious. As the rent is no longer \ndenominated in paddy equivalents,\n20.Orang susah-lah bergantung kapada orang senang.\n21. This is, of course, especially true of the pure wage laborers in Sedaka, but it is also true of the more numerous \nmarginal smallholders and tenants who have traditionally relied on fieldwork wages for a larger share of their \nincome.\n  \n< previous page\npage_151\nnext page >\n",

Should the paddy price increase, the cash rent can simply be \nraised the following season; should it decrease, the tenant absorbs the loss. Prepaid rents, of course, arrive five or six \nmonths earlier under the new arrangement, giving the landlord the use of the capital for that much longer. Above all, \nsewa tunai avoids disputes and confrontations on the threshing floor in the case of crop damage or failure. It was never \nan easy matter to determine the cause of a harvest shortfall, whether it was due to the negligence of the cultivator, in \nwhich case no remission was granted, or whether it was due to weather or pests, in which case a remission was \nordinarily negotiated. The size of the remission was also a source of acrimonious exchanges that often left both sides \nfeeling shortchanged. Now the landlord need never even look at his fields or listen to the dubious pleas of his tenants \nafter a bad season. Only one option is open to a dissatisfied tenant: giving up the tenancy.\nThose who adopt a landlord's perspective are naturally delighted. Kamil, himself a large tenant, but whose rents are very \nmodest (M$120 per relong, per season), notes that \"cheating\" was common under the older, sewa padi system.22 The \ncheating might take the form of surreptitious harvesting at night before the official harvest began, spiriting away some \nof the grain at the actual harvest if supervision was lax, shoddy threshing so as to leave much paddy on the stalks to be \ngleaned and kept later, and above all spurious claims of crop damage to cover any or all of these subterfuges and \nthereby reduce the rent. Tenants, to be sure, walked a fine line in pursuing these strategies which, if pushed too far too \noften, might lead to their dismissal. Under sewa tunai, however, all of these ploys are simply irrelevant. Haji Salim, a \nvery large landowner and entrepreneur who lives just outside the village, makes it clear that prepaid cash rents provide \nan element of labor discipline. \"These people {tenants} are scoundrels,\" he says.23 Before sewa tunai, he adds, they \ncould cultivate carelessly and then ask for a reduction in rent, claiming that worms or caterpillars had damaged the \npaddy. Now, however, ''If they give the money first, they have to look after the crop carefully, they can't just play \naround. They have to take it a bit more seriously.\"24\nThe disadvantages of sewa tunai for tenants are as palpable as the advantages for landlords. Those who know most \npoignantly about the disadvantages are, of course, those who actually lost their tenancy when the shift was imposed. \nEven for the majority who managed to raise the cash in time, the costs were considerable. They typically took loans on \ntheir wives' gold jewelry (given to most\n22.Masa sewa padi, penyewa boleh tipu, senang-lah!

If the paddy crop was good, this proved a minor inconvenience; if the crop was poor, \nhowever, it became a financial crisis.25 The jewelry might be forfeit, the husband might have to leave the village to find \nwork elsewhere, or debts might simply accumulate. As sewa tunai has become more prevalent, it has also exerted a \nsubtle but unmistakable influence on other forms of tenancy. Those lucky enough to have tenancies in which the rent is \npayable after the harvest and thus, in principle, is negotiable are increasingly reluctant to avail themselves of this \nprivilege for fear that the landlord will retaliate by moving to prepaid rents.26\nThe key objection from the tenants' perspective is simply that the rent is fixed and bears no relation to the paddy yields \nof a particular season, that is, to the tenant's ability to pay. As they say, \"You can't take it into account, you can't \nbargain, you can't compromise, you can't do anything.\"27 This is not simply a statement of fact delivered in an \nimpersonal way. The phrase most often heard in connection with sewa tunaioften enough to have become almost a \nsloganis, \"If the paddy is ruined, that's your {the tenant's} lookout.\"28 It is spoken with gestures and facial expressions \nto imitate a callous landlord announcing the facts of life to his tenant. It implies, of course, that the state of the paddyand \ntherefore of his tenantmost definitely ought to concern any self-respecting landlord.\nWhat is involved here, as most villagers see it, is thus a shift in rents that mirrors a portentous shift in the quality of \nclass relations. The attitude of landlords when rents were adjustable was described as magnanimous (senang kira).29 \nThis term is the opposite of berkira, or \"stingy\" and \"calculating,\" which is normally the most devastating charge made \nagainst the rich, as we have seen. To be senang kira is to inhabit a social world in which an amicable reciprocity \nprevails and in which no one is trying to take undue advantage of others. It is a value as much breached as observed but \nis no less powerful for that reason. The contrast between how things were and how they are is apparent from Amin's \ndescription. \"Before they said, 'If the harvest is bad, {we'll} reduce {the rent} a\n25. Wahid is an illustration: he rents 6 relong and would ordinarily be expected to fall in the middle range of \nvillage incomes despite his large family. For the past two seasons, however, he has had quite poor yields of \nnine or ten gunny sacks per relong and fairly high rents that are not negotiable. As a result his earnings have \nbeen minimal and he is openly debating giving up two of his three rented plots and working much of the year \nin Penang.\n26. This holds true for many tenancies in which the landlord is a close relative as well.\n27.Tak boleh rundingkan, tak boleh tawar-menawar, tak boleh tolak ansur, tak boleh apa-apa.\n28.Padi rosak, hang punya pasal.\n29.Senang kira might be translated literally as \"easygoing about calculating.\"\n  \n< previous page\npage_153\nnext page >\n",

The social construction of \nsewa tunai on the part of most others is that it puts an end to an arrangement in which the landlord showed a due regard \nfor the circumstances and needs of his tenants.31\nCombine-Harvesters\nMesin makan kerja (\"the machine eats work\") \nSeveral villagers\nWe have examined in some detail the consequences of combine-harvesting that are amenable to statistical analysis. \nMany of the \"facts\" of the matterthe loss of direct harvest work, the loss of gleaning, the extent of lost income, the strata \nthat have been most directly touchedare established with some assurance. Here I turn to the social construction of these \nfacts by the inhabitants of Sedaka. At the crudest level, there are at least two social histories of the entry of combine-\nharvesters: one propagated by winners and one propagated by losers. The winners and losers, in this case, are not \ntenants and landlords but rather large-scale cultivators (whether owners or tenants) on the one hand and smaller-scale \ncultivators together with landless laborers on the other. In between lies a strata of modest farmers whose gains and \nlosses are roughly offsetting and whose view is therefore ambivalent.32 Size of farm is, of course, a fairly reliable \nindicator of income in Sedaka, so that winners and losers correspond closely to the rich and\n30.La, depa kata, kalau tak boleh padi, potong sikit.

Amin, in village terms, is a \nwealthy man, but he also rents in 7.5 relong and thus has a tenant's perspective on this issue.\n31. Ships are once again passing in the night and the distance between them has much to do with class. There is, as \nalways, a reconstruction of history being undertaken here. Under sewa padi, there were some landlords who did \nnot allow reductions after a bad harvest. Karim can remember a landlord who found after a bad harvest that the \nrent (this time paid in kind) was short by four gantags (a trivial amount). He came to collect it anyway, claiming \nthat it had \"been promised.\" The point is that, for tenants anyway, the older system has taken on a rosier hue now \nthat they confront sewa tunai.\n32. To these must also be added a few (five) small farmers who use the machine because it frees them quickly for \nwage work elsewhere and/or because they have little or no household labor that would allow them either to \nexchange labor (berderau) or harvest their own crop themselves.\n  \n< previous page\npage_154\nnext page >\n",

Their respective social histories of the combines are an integral part of class conflict as it is in fact waged in \nthe kampung.\nCertain social facts about combine-harvesters are so apparent and indisputable that they are acknowledged by all \nconcerned. These facts make up something of a zone of consensus. At the core of this consensus is the fact that the poor, \nwho depended on harvest labor, have been hurt and that the well-to-do have benefited. How great the hurt, how \nsubstantial the benefitthe magnitudesis another matter altogether, but the overall impact is not in dispute. As Abu \nHassan, who has a steady job with the Farmers' Association and farms 6 relong notes, \"Since the machine came in, \nthose peasants who work for wages have just sat around.\"33 Tok Kasim, also fairly well-to-do himself, adds, \"It's \ncertain that the poor have lost.\" Most often when talking of machine harvesting, the well-to-do are less reticent about \nacknowledging the losses of the poor than their own gains. For poorer villagers, it is typically the combine-harvester \nthat brings to their lips the saying, ''The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\" In the process they often make it clear \nthat the machines bring the rich pleasure as well as profit. Hamzah, a landless laborer, makes it clear just where the \ndividing line between pleasure and pain fell and which side he is on: \"The friends who work for wages couldn't get \nenough {work} but those who don't earn wages were happy.\"34 Even in the joint recognition of social facts, there is \nthus a special twist to the remarks of the poor, who are likely to link their losses to the profits of others, their pain to the \npleasure of others.\nWhen it comes to how efficient and profitable the machines are, we enter a zone of claims and counterclaims that divide \nthe rich and poor. The claims of the well-off are essentially a series of assertions about the advantages of machine \nharvesting over hand harvesting. The large farmers note, above all, the speed with which the combine gathers and bags \nthe crop. They believe that their harvest per relong is increased by anywhere from one to two gunny sacks of paddy over \nhand harvesting, and they note the savings in labor and cash over having to haul rice from the field to a nearby bund. \nThis last operation often costs as much as one or two dollars a sack, thereby raising the cost of production \nappreciably.35 Large cultivators such as Haji Jaafar, the village headman, contin-\n33. Abu Hassan is to some degree showing off his school learning here by using petani for peasants. The \nterm, common in official talk and newspapers, is not frequently used by villagers, who are likely to call \nthemselves \"villagers\" (orang kampung). The term for combine-harvester in everyday use is simply mesin or \nmesin padi.\n34.Kawan yang ambil upah, tak jenuh, orang yang tak ambil upah, seronok.\n35. If the field is very wet the sacks are often hauled on wooden sleds (andur) pulled by water buffalo. Otherwise \nthey are carried on men's backs to the narrow bunds to be transferred to bicycles and then, on larger bunds, to \nmotorcycles or lorries. Piece-wages vary according to the distance and mode of transport. If the charge per gunny \nsack is M$1.50, the total cost per relong for an average yield (twenty-four gunny sacks) will amount to roughly 15 \npercent of production costs and between 12 and 13 percent of net profit for a tenant paying normal rents.\n  \n< previous page\npage_155\nnext page >\n",

Not counting the \nelements of speed and reduced spoilage, they estimate that they save anywhere from M$18 to $30 a relongdepending on \nthe season, the location of the field, the yield, and so forthby hiring the combine.\nMachine use has at least two additional advantages, one of which is mentioned frequently while the other is, \nsignificantly, never noted openly by the well-to-do. Large farmers are pleased to be relieved of the management and \nsupervision problems involved in recruiting harvest labor. This not only includes arranging for a group of reapers and \nthreshers at the right time, when others may want them too, but also overseeing the threshing to make certain that it is \nthorough and providing meals and snacks for the work force. Hiring the combine-harvester not only saves labor and \nexpense; it also eliminates a task that is complicated and liable to come unstuck at any moment.36 The wage laborers in \nSedaka point out another factor that they claim motivates the large farmers to mechanize. Machines, Karim pointedly \nnotes, do not ask for wages in advance nor do they expect to receive Islamic charity (zakat peribadi) over and above \ntheir wages. This is a point on which the well-to-do are silentperhaps because it would reflect a callous attitude toward \ntime-honored customs now being breached. In any event, it is clear that most large cultivators have moved with alacrity \nfrom a harvesting system that enmeshed them in a series of customary social ties and obligations to their poorer \nneighbors to one in which only a single, impersonal contract with a machine broker is necessary. Others, particularly \nthose who have most to lose, contest some if not all of these advantages and cite other drawbacks of machine use. The \nfact most often contested is that yields are greater with the combine. A low-keyed dispute that once took place between \nMat \"halus,\" a landless laborer, and Ghazali, a tenant on 9 relong, is fairly representative of many other such \ndiscussions. Mat \"halus\" claimed that the combine-harvester often missed rows close to the bund and flattened the \npaddy at the point where it entered the field. Furthermore, he said, the machine often jams and spills paddy when it is \nturning or when its bin is full. As the inventor of gleaning behind the machine, Mat \"halus\" is something of an expert in \nthis area. Ghazali politely disagrees; he says he gets at least an extra gunny sack when he uses the combine and that, in \nany case, his neighbor's son, who hand threshed for him last season, spilled much paddy from the tub and left a great \ndeal of grain on the stalks.\nIn other ways as well, the poor attempt to prove that, apart from the ethics involved, the use of combine-harvesters is \nnot in the self-interest of cultivators. They claim, with some justice, that the huge machines create deep ruts, par-\n36. Thus, hand harvesting is often described by large cultivators as renyah (troublesome, intricate) as \ncompared with the machine, which requires only a single transaction.\n  \n< previous page\npage_156\nnext page >\n",

They cite the destruction of bunds as the machines pass from one plot to another and the inconvenience of having \nto coordinate planting times in order to ensure that the combine will have a route through cleared fields to any parcel \nthat is not beside an access road. Large farmers are, with few exceptions, unmoved by this litany of disadvantages; they \nhave made their decision and are satisfied with the results.\nThe richer peasants in Sedaka would, however, be loath to admit that they had in effect taken away a major part of the \nlivelihood of poorer villagers merely because the machine was more convenient and saved them a few dollars. To do so \nwould be to announce openly that their own marginal private advantage was paramount and to disavow openly any \nresponsibility for the welfare of the rest of their community. Having acknowledged, as virtually all have, that the \ncombine-harvester has meant economic hardship for the poor, the larger farmers are at pains to present a description of \ntheir behavior that justifies it in terms that their neighbors can understand if not accept. They endeavor to do this by \nasserting that there is a labor shortage and they have no choice but to use the combine-harvester if they are to harvest \ntheir paddy in good time. This is their second and more substantial line of social defense; practicality gives way to \nnecessity. It is, as we shall see, a line of defense that is under constant sniper fire from the poor but is in no danger of \nbeing abandoned.\nThe concept of a labor shortage is tricky. At one level it simply means that some people are paying more for labor than \nthey would like to pay. If labor were more abundant, its wage would decline. At another levela more objective levelit \ncould certainly be claimed that a labor shortage existed if paddy rotted in the fields for want of harvest workers. Not \neven the rich make this claim, for even before the combines came to the Muda region, but after double-cropping, the \npaddy crop was successfully gotten in. Their assertion instead is the more modest but no less insistent one that labor is \nshort, hence too expensive, and that their crops are endangered if they rely on fieldhands. Thus Haji Jaafar, the village \nheadman, and his brother Lazim, who farms 13.5 relong, explain that before combine-harvesting the village poor would \noften leave to thresh paddy elsewhere if the wages were higher than in Sedaka. The ripe paddy, they claim, was \nharvested late and was lighter than it should have been, thereby reducing the price it would fetch. \"The cultivator lost,\" \nLazim adds. Tok Kasim echoes these sentiments. He claims that at the last minute he would be short of both reapers and \nthreshers, who did not show up, and would have to raise wages to recruit extra hands. Even then, he says, his crop was \nlate. Mat Isa, a tenant on 5 relong who hires the combine, says he would prefer to hire workers from the kampung but he \nhas no choice. He is especially concerned about the irrigated season harvest, which will sprout (padi tumbuh) if not \nthreshed promptly, and recalls that two seasons ago some of his paddy was ruined in this way. The government drying \nmill would only give him half price for it. He admits that\n  \n< previous page\npage_157\nnext page >\n",

Labor was tight in Muda at the peak harvest \nseason even before double-cropping. Migrant labor from Thailand and Kelantan regularly supplemented the local work \nforce. With irrigation, wages did initially rise nearly twofold, but between 1972 and 1974 the real wages of harvest \nworkers actually declined.37 And there is no evidence that crop damage due to labor shortages was a serious problem \nfrom 1972 until combines became available.38 What the large-scale users of combines wish to assert is that their hands \nare tied, that if they do not hire machines they will lose part or all of their crop. Once accepted, this assertion justifies \ntheir behavior, for no one in Sedaka would blame a farmer for using combines if that was the only way to save his crop.\nThose who depend heavily on field labor for their income see little merit in this claim. Rokiah, who works regularly as a \ntransplanter and a reaper, says, \"If they didn't want to hire the machine they could hire villagers; there are enough \nlooking for work.\" Another woman, Rosni, a widow widely admired for her hard work, believes that those who hire the \ncombine are \"only interested in speed,\" implying, as do others, that large farmers are willing to sacrifice the welfare of \nthe village poor for the sake of cutting their paddy two or three days early. It is clear to the wage workers in the village \nthat the rich use the combine out of a desire for convenience and speed, not out of necessity.\nIf we scratch a bit deeper we find that, as the rich see it, the labor shortage in Sedaka is not just an impersonal statistic \nof too much work and not enough hands to do it. Instead, it is a question of whether the poor actually want to work. Haji \nSalim (three wives, tractor, lorry, and many relong of paddy fields) is a typical representative of this view. After \nconceding that \"the poor just barely manage,\" that \"they have no luxuries,\"39 he hastens to add that they will not do the \nwork. \"They're sluggards;40 they don't want to work; they're well-off {so}\n37.

Press, forthcoming), chap. 2.\n38. It is quite possible that some farmers did occasionally experience losses due to delays in harvesting the off-\nseason crop. What is missing, however, is any indication that agricultural authorities thought this was a serious \nproblem between 1972 and 1977. On the other hand, it is certainly plausible that, now that migration from \nThailand has been sharply curtailed, a withdrawal of combine-harvesters would, today, result in serious crop losses.\n39.Orang susah bertahan saja, mewah tak ada.\n40.Penyegan pun.\n  \n< previous page\npage_158\nnext page >\n",

They are not simply increasing their profits but \nare saving their paddy crops, which are threatened by the shiftlessness of local workers. No Victorian entrepreneur \ncould have wished for a more satisfactory exoneration of his own behavior.\nThis outlook, it is worth noting, receives ample support and encouragement from the ranks of officialdom. Abdul Majid, \nthe subdistrict chief (penghulu), claims that villagers do not want to work. \"People say they are arrogant, they decline,42 \nthey won't even show up unless the wages are high.\" \"If the wages are high, then only do they want {to work}.\" \n\"Villagers are difficult.\"43 The only difference between his view and that of Fadzil or Haji Salim is that he talks, from \nhis exalted post, more globally of villagers in general (orang kampung), failing to make any distinctions. He concludes \nby comparing these intractable villagers with the combine-harvester, which he says is \"fast, cheap, and doesn't have to \nbe fed.\" At the annual meeting of the Farmers' Association membership from Sedaka and adjacent Sungai \nTongkangcomprised almost exclusively of prosperous farmersmuch the same sentiments were expressed. They were put \nbluntly and publicly by Ismail Arshad, the UMNO member of Parliament for this constituency and a member of a \nprincely Kedah family. \"People don't want to work for wages as they once did.\" \"They work only in the morning and \nthen pull out and go back home.\"44 Basir, Sedaka's UMNO leader, concurs heartily. \"People like that are hard to keep \nwatch on; they climb up coconut trees {to escape work}; you can't believe them.\" The officials and their well-off \nsupporters\n41.Setengah-setengah tak ada gerek buruk pun masa dulu, la' ni ada moto. Haji Salim, it should be added, has \nsome special reasons for defending himself. During the main season of 1979 he went to the central office of \nthe Muda Scheme to request permission to import Thai transplanters, claiming he could not find help locally. \nMore than a dozen Thai planters were brought, for which he is roundly criticized by the village poor, who \nbelieve that he simply wanted to find cheaper labor than he could get nearby and to have all his land planted \nsimultaneously so that it could later be harvested in a single combine pass.\n42.Orang kata sombong, tarik diri.\n43.Orang Kampung payah.

As Hamid notes, \nthere are not many in the kampung who depend on wages alone for their income. It is hardly surprising that those who \nhave borne the brunt of mechanization should speak with less equanimity. When they recount the precipitous decline in \ntheir earnings over the past three years, a frantic tone is apt to enter their assessment. Rokiah speaks for most of them \nwhen she says, \"People can't make any money if the machine comes and takes it all.\" \"The rich get more profit and the \npoor lose.\" \"You can't even lay your hands on ten cents.\" \"It's no use looking for work; now there's nothing at all.''45 \nHamzah puts the matter more succinctly: \"We are being ruined.\" Mat \"halus\" rounds out this apocalyptic view: \n\"{Since} the machine came in, what are the Malays going to eat?\" \"The machine can now take it all.\" It is not, of \ncourse, a question of starvation, as Mat \"halus\" 's rhetoric implies. It is instead a choice between a life of permanent \npenury in the village or the alternative, for the young, of permanent or semipermanent migration. The growing tendency \nfor large farmers to broadcast some or all of their fields, thus eliminating transplanting, only serves to make the sense of \nforeboding that much more palpable.46\nJust as substantial farmers see the \"labor shortage\" as a human problem rather than as a statistic, the poor see the \nintroduction of combine-harvesters as a human problem rather than as machinery. If the rich think the poor are largely \nto blame for labor problems, the poor think the rich are largely to blame for mechanization. On the face of it, others \nmight plausibly be held responsible for the combines: for example, the government, which has encouraged their use, \nand the syndicates of largely Chinese businessmen, who purchase and deploy them. The overwhelming consensus \namong the village poor, however, is that the cultivators who hire them are to blame. When I asked if MADA was at \nfault, Mat \"halus\" promply replied, \"Not the government but kampung people; it is they who call and use the machines.\" \n\"If they refused to use them, the machines wouldn't have come.\" \"How could they even pay for the gas?\" \"It's as\n45. \"It's no use looking for work\" is a translation of Tak payah cari makan, literally, \"it's no use looking to \neat.\" Cari makan is the universal phrase in Malay for \"making a living\" and thus covers both work and the \ngoods, particularly food goods, which that work makes it possible to buy.\n46. The social construction of broadcasting (tabur kering) follows much the same pattern by class as the dialogue \nabout combines. Whether yields are higher or lower with broadcasting than with hand transplanting is a subject of \nconstant discussion and dispute, with most of the large cultivators favoring it and most of the wage workers and \nsmall farmers opposing it. For many of the village poor it is the coup de grace to their livelihood; as Rokiah says, \n\"If they braodcast, that will kill us (mampus).\"\n  \n< previous page\npage_160\nnext page >\n",

Comments along similar lines are frequently heard; thus, when Karim supposes that the rich prefer the \ncombines because they thereby avoid paying advance wages and zakat to workers, he concludes, \"Rich people don't \nbother themselves {about us}.\"48 The calculus of blame, on this issue as on most others, finds a target quite close to \nhome. It is not, I suspect, that poor villagers hold either the government or the syndicates blameless for their suffering. \nIt is rather that large cultivators are, after all, within moral reach; they are a part of the community and therefore ought \nnot to be indifferent to the consequences of their acts for their neighbors.\nMuch of the same calculus appears to be at work in the praise given to those cultivators who continued to hire local \nlabor even after the combines became available. Altogether there are seven or eight farmers who are often singled out as \nexamples of \"compassion,\" as \"good people.\"49 The effect of this praise is to turn these men into positive symbolic \nexamples, just as Haji Broom and Razak were used as negative examples. What is being said here is that, if other \ncultivators had due consideration for their fellow villagers, they would behave in the same way.\nThis modest propaganda offensive seems to have had little impact on the sensibilities of the rich unless, of course, one \nreads a certain defensiveness into their elaborate justification of combine-harvesting. The one exception is Tok Kasim, \nwho is clearly at pains to justify his work as a combine brokeras someone who lines up a local harvesting schedule for \nhis Chinese employer in return for a fee of M$5 per relong.50 He is, in effect, the agent for the combine owner and is \nwell aware of the contempt in which some of his poorer neighbors\n47.Tak ada timbang rasa.\n48.Orang kaya tak ingat. This might also be translated more literally as \"Rich people don't remember (give a \nthought to) such matters.\"\n49. Among them are Tajuddin, Bakri bin Haji Wahab, his brother Dzulkifli bin Haji Wahab, Tok Mahmud, Samat, \nLebai Pendek, Abdul Rahman, Basir, and Kamil. Aside from Basir, whose political role might impel him to hire \nmore labor than he might otherwise wish, there is nothing that distinguishes these cultivators from their neighbors \nexcept, perhaps, public-spiritedness. Even this list is somewhat controversial, since some suggest that X or Y \nactually employ villagers because their land is too waterlogged, etc., to take the machine.\n50. As with tractors, combine brokers (berokar) are always Malays living in the village who then become \npersonally responsible for seeing that the fees are paid to him. Any shortfall comes from his pocket. In this way, \nthe machine owners make use of mutual obligations between Malays of the same village. It would be tempting to \ncheat the machine owner of his fee, but to cheat one's neighbor is another matter.

The signs of embarrassment seem \nobvious.53\nThere is in the village as a whole, but especially among the poor, a strong sense that the natural order of village \neconomic relations has been turned topsyturvy by combine-harvesting. The direction of wages has been reversed; they \ntraditionally moved, as one might expect, from the rich to the poor. Now, lo and behold, they move in the opposite \ndirection, for cultivators pay wages to tractor and combine owners who are far richer than themselves. Amin's \ncomments capture the paradox:\nIn the old days you had to seek the poor and pay them wages. Nowadays, you have to seek the rich and pay \nthem wages. Before the Chinese {who owned or rented land} hired us; now we hire the Chinese. Even Pak \nYah has to pay wages to rich people. Poor people go back home and sit quietly.\nAgan and again the phrases, \"Now the rich earn wages,\" or \"Now the poor hire the rich\" are repeated in wonderment, \nreflecting the irony of a situation that seems fundamentally out of joint. For the rich of the village, it is a noteworthy \ncuriosity; for the poor, however, it is a bitter ironywork and income to which they were traditionally entitled now go to \nwealthy businessmen. Wage earners in Sedaka are pointing not to one but two ironies which, taken together, amount to \nan argument of sorts. The first is that it is now a \"machine that takes all the money.\" The second is that the \"money now \nleaves the village\" and, in fact, the country (they mention Hong Kong, Japan, Australia) and is lost forever from the \nvillage sphere of circulation. The implication is that the hiring of fellow villagers should take priority over the hiring of \noutsiderslet alone machinesbecause the money remains a part of the local ritual cycle of religious feasts that benefit all.\nA brief episode in local agricultural history perhaps best captures the relationship between the poor and combine-\nharvesting.

Some villagers claim that another form of \"squirming\" is reflected in the fairly common practice of selling \npaddy in the field (jual pokok padi). In this way the landowner escapes censure by transferring the crop, prior to \nharvest, to someone else, often a machine owner. This, if true, has many parallels with the tebasan system in Java, \nwhere the object is not to avoid censure for use of combines but to avoid censure for hiring outsiders who harvest \nwith sickles. In any event, there are a multitude of other reasons why a cultivator might wish to sell his standing \ncrop.\n  \n< previous page\npage_162\nnext page >\n",

Immediately, since the afternoon work was over, eight or \nten villagers on bicycles and motorcycles went off to have a look. They returned an hour or so later to report that it was \nindeed stuck and that its operator's efforts to drive it out had only mired it more firmly. Beginning the following dayand \nfor the next week and a halfthe crowd of onlookers from Sedaka and surrounding villages grew. Within a few days the \ncombine in Sungai Kering had become something of a pilgrimage site. All efforts to extract it had failed and each day a \nnew strategy was triedwinches, tow trucks, cables attached to dump trucks fully loaded for extra traction, bulldozersto \nno avail. Two owners from the syndicate were in daily attendance, visibly worried and angry, shouting and gesticulating \nto their workers as each new scheme was implemented and failed. Their spirits were not buoyed by the growing crowds, \nwho were openly rooting against the combine and its owners and in favor of the gradually encroaching Kedah mud. In \nfact, after a week, the line of sight from a hundred yards across the paddy fields offered only a view of the cab; time was \ndefinitely on the side of the Kedah mud. Meanwhile, local laborers were cutting and threshing around the stricken \ncombine, now covered with mud and looking for all the world like the site of an archeological excavation.\nNever in the course of my fieldwork had I seen a happier, more self-satisfied crowd.54 The mood was definitely more \nand more festive as it appeared likely that the combine might actually be swallowed up. Talk centered on speculation \nabout the fabulous sums that were daily being lost by the owners as the harvest proceeded and on the possibility that \nyear-round flooding of the fields since 1972 and repeated machine use might make such events commonplace. At last \nthe owners, despairing of other solutions, hired a gang of coolies who literally dug around the combine, creating a \ngentle ramp ahead of it, permitting it to be towed out.55 The impromptu pilgrimage and festival abruptly ended, but it \nhad provided a brief interlude of poetic justice.\nWhat should also not be overlooked here is the way in which combine-harvesting has brought large cultivators and \nwage laborers into a more directly\n54. One possible exception was the scene of another misfortune, when a local police officer from the station \nin Kepala Batas wrecked his new Volvo (purchased under a special car-loan plan for civil servants) after \ncolliding with a lorry that had turned in front of him to deliver goods to a shop. The officer, a fairly new \nrecruit, was infamous for extracting bribes from motorcyclists living nearby. Most motorcycle owners are in \nsystematic contravention of the law, as they have not paid the necessary road tax or insurance fees to the state. \nThey are thus easy game.\n55. I was not there when the combine was finally freed, but it was widely believed that the combine owners had, in \ndesperation, finally hired a Malay bomoh (specialist in traditional medicine and curing rituals), whose incantations \nwere mainly responsible for releasing it from the clay.\n  \n< previous page\npage_163\nnext page >\n",

Any setback to the process of mechanization is a setback to big farmers and, at the same time, \na boon to those who seek fieldwork. This is particularly noticeable during the irrigated season harvest period. In the \npast, a good crop for larger farmers was also a gain for fieldworkers; it meant more work and more pay. Now, however, \na bad season for large farmers is a direct gain for wage laborers. The more paddy that has been lodged (rebah) by wind \nand rain, the deeper the water level in the fields, the less scope there is for combine-harvesting, leaving that much more \nemployment for the poor. Due entirely to the combines, the poor thus find themselves for the first time actually looking \nforward to the kind of crop damage and flooding that serves their interests. Even the weather has become something of a \nclass issue.\nLosing Ground:  \nAccess to Paddy Land\nThe proposition that it is becoming harder and harder to find paddy land to rent in is universally accepted in Sedaka and \njust as universally deplored. Old villagers can still recall when the father of Ghani Lebai Mat and a few others bought \nland in 20- and 30-relong lots from Tengku Jiwa for a nominal sum. Middle-aged peasants can recall a time, not long \nago, when no one in the village was without land to farm, whether as a tenant or an owner. \"Then,\" Abdul Rahman \nadds, \"rents were figured with compassion,56 the land was cheap, and there was a lot of it; a rich man couldn't farm \nmore than 20 relong at most by himself.\" This phenomenon of \"the good old days\" is, of course, socially created for the \nexplicit purpose of comparison with the current situation. ''Now,\" says Abdul Rahman, completing the contrast, \"one \nman can farm 50 or even 100 relong himself; he keeps all the money and he keeps all the rice.\" Tok Mahmud's \ncomparison is different but complementary: \"Now there are more people, rents are high, and landlords are using \nleasehold tenancy\" (pajak). The two causes most often often cited for today's state of affairs (omitting population and \nsewa tunai) are, in ascending order of importance, the resumption of cultivation by large landowners and the growth of \nlong-lease pajak rentals.\nThese are not issues on which there is much dispute within Sedaka.57 After all, there is no landlord class worthy of the \nname in Sedaka. Most of the land rented out by villagers is to children or grandchildren on concessionary terms and in \nsmall parcels. The remainder is either inherited land that is too far away to farm conveniently or land that is leased out \ndue only to the temporary financial embarrassment of the owner. Thus the widespread resentment over the shortage\n56.Senang berkira.\n57. There are, however, other villages such as Mengkuang, immediately to the south, in which there are substantial \nlandlords residing in the village and either farming themselves or renting out pajak, large parcels of land. Here, \nsome of the conflict to be described shortly would be internalized.\n  \n< previous page\npage_164\nnext page >\n",

There is, however, a marked difference in the passion and intensity with which this issue is raised by \nvillagersa difference that depends very much on class. For the dozen or so well-to-do farmers who own and/or farm \nmore than, say, 8 relong, the issue is not momentous. If they could rent in more land, some of them would welcome the \nopportunity, but it is not a matter of pressing concern. For the rest of the villagers, and particularly for the landless or \nnearly landless, by contrast, the issue is highly charged, inasmuch as it bears on whether or not they have a future at all \nin Sedaka.\nA common way in which land is lost to poorer cultivators is when a landlord decides to resume cultivation in his own \nright, dismissing his tenants. Spurred by the profits of double-cropping and the ease of hiring the combine, many of \nKedah's biggest landlords have taken back land once farmed by small tenants.58 Haji Ani, the son of Haji Broom, has \ndone precisely this with more than 100 relong in nearby Mengkuang. Another big landowner in Mengkuang, from a \nprincely family living in Penang, has resumed cultivation of over 50 relong by employing a Chinese manager. Shamsul \nand Tok Ahmad in Sedaka were threatened with dispossession by their landlord, Haji Din, who claimed he wanted to \nfarm the land himself or have his son farm it. By complaining at the district office they were able, luckily, to negotiate a \ncompromise by which Haji Din resumed cultivating only half the land for the time being.59 Landlords who take back \nlarge blocks of land in this fashion are generally hated for their avarice. Thus Tok Ahmad condemns Haji Din: \"He \ndoesn't care whether we eat or not; he wants to eat us up.\"60 No such opprobrium attaches to petty landlords who\n58. Wahid and others claim that the increasing resort to selling crops in the field (jual pokok padi) is a \nmodified version of the same practice. In this case a landowner prepares the field, plants the crops, and then \nsells the standing crop to an entrepreneur, often a Chinese combine owner. The planter gets back his money \nquickly and avoids much of the risk associated with the harvest. This practice, common in Mengkuang, is \nsomewhere between full cultivation and rental, but in any case the small tenant is excluded.\n59. This was made possible by the fact that, unlike most tenancies, this one was of long duration and was actually \nregistered under the Padi Act of 1955. This act regulates rents and dismissals, although most rents, even under \nregistered tenancy, are well above the maximum provided for in the statute. The law allows for resumption of use \nof such plots by the landlord, but if a complaint is made the local land officer (usually the Assistant District \nOfficer) is likely to seek a compromise or a delay. Such a delay, for example, explains why the aristocratic family \nmentioned above has resumed cultivation of only 50 relong of the more than 100 relong it owns in Mengkuang.\n60. The supple use of the verb \"to eat\" (makan) here in the sense of consuming food and in the sense of \nexploitation is notable. Boleh makan, tak makan, dia tak kira. Dia mau makan kita.\n  \n< previous page\npage_165\nnext page >\n",

The logic is rather that those who have more than enough for their own needs ought to rent the surplus to \nthose who are poorer. If they refuse, they are called hard-hearted (keras hati) or greedy (tamak, haloba).\nHigh rents and the resumption of cultivation by large landowners, while they excite much concern, are completely \novershadowed by what appears to be a menacing trend to leasehold tenancy (pajak). Unlike traditional Pajak \narrangements under which smallholders in need of cash rented their small plots over several seasons for rents that \nworked out to be quite modest, the newer leaseholds involve larger plots and premium rents. Villagers keep their ears \nclose to the ground and each reported leasehold rent in the area is typically the basis of morbid speculation. Thus a \nrecent report that Mat Buyong's son in Sungai Tongkang had rented 3.5 relong for three seasons for a sum of M$2,000 \nwas deplorable news, for the rent comes to more than M$190 per relong, per season. Most villagers thought that Mat \nBuyong's son was \"daring to take on\"61 a lease at this pricethat it would be a losing proposition.\nIt is not simply a question of the calculated rent that stirs such consternation, but the lump-sum capital that pajak \nrequires. Nizam's landlord, Haji Zahir, who as we have seen extracted premium rents on a seasonal basis, announced in \nearly 1979 that he wanted to switch to pajak for two seasons. Although the rent was no higher, it required Nizam to \nraise over M$1,000 immediately, which he managed to do only by scrambling to raise loans from his father and the \npawnshop. Had he failed to raise the capital, the land would have passed to someone else. As Nizam says, \"He wants to \nexploit us; he wants to take it all.\"62 Others have not been this fortunate. Samad and Fadzil have each lost tenanted land \nwhen they were unable to come up with the capital for a longer lease on which the landowner insisted. In each case a \nwealthy villager, Ghani Lebai Mat, took the tenancy. Their anger is not so much directed at Ghani Lebai Mat as at the \ntwo outside landlords who would not compromise on the length or price of the lease. For young farmers seeking land, \nthe pajak system is a formidable barrier. Mat Nasir, Rokiah's recently married son, for example, has been actively \nlooking for a tenancy the past three years. Recently he heard of a possible leasehold on 4 relong for four seasons. The \ntotal cost was M$2,400 which, although it worked out to a modest rent of M$150 per relong, per season, was far beyond \nwhat Mat Nasir could raise. Despite the fact that the landlord was his wife's relation and might be expected to prefer \nhim as a tenant, it was futile to pursue it without capital. As he bitterly observed, \"Now they think only of their stomach \nfirst. Relatives are pushed aside.\"63\nIf the poorer villagers have most to lose in the move to pajak tenancy, the\n61.Berani ambil.\n62.Dia mau tekan; dia mau makan semua.\n63.Sekarang ini, depa mau perut dulu, adek-beradek tolak tepi.\n  \n< previous page\npage_166\nnext page >\n",

Their worries are reflected in their reaction to the most widely discussed leasehold \ncontract struck during my stay in Sedaka. This contract was made between a very wealthy Malay landowner from \nMengkuang, Haji Hassan (a grandson of Haji Broom), and his new tenant, the wealthiest Chinese shopkeeper in Kepala \nBatas, nicknamed Cina Cerut.64 Fifty relong, an enormous expanse, was rented for eight seasons in return for a lump \nsum of M$88,000. The per relong, per season rent was itself unprecedented (M$220), but what was staggering was the \nfabulous sum involveda sum well beyond the reach of even the wealthiest Malay landowners in the district. Together \nwith stories of other large leasehold deals between very rich Malay landowners and Chinese tenants, most of whom \nwere part-owners of combine syndicates, this episode created a sense of despair among rich villagers. While they might \naspire to raising the capital for much smaller leaseholds, rents of anything like this magnitude (both in terms of the per \nrelong cost and the capital required) would henceforth, they surmised, be monopolized by rich Chinese with their own \nmachinery.65 With these \"auction\" (lelong) rents, as Haji Nayan calls them, \"Only the very rich can take {the land}; \nthey {landowners} don't care about race, many {of the tenants} are Chinese.\" Rich and poor alike, then, have ample \nreason to worry about pajak, though their worries are not the same. For the rich, it means that an avenue of further \naccumulation is being choked off; for the poorespecially the tenantsit represents a threat to their precarious livelihood.66\nThe practice of leasehold tenancy reproduces in another form the topsy-turvy\n64. So nicknamed because he always has a cigar (cheroot) stuck in his mouth.\n65. At a rent of M$220 per relong, and ignoring the interest on the lump sum if it were borrowed, the net cash \nreturn would be only M$71 per relong, assuming an average yield of fourteen gunny sacks. Only someone with \ncapital who is able to spread his risks across, say, 100 relong would be willing to accept such a small profit \nmargin. If, on the other hand, one has access to tractors and combines at minimal cost (maintenance, fuel, and \ndepreciation) the profits per relong are substantially higher. Although a good many wealthy Malays own tractors, \nonly a handful in Kedah are members of a combine syndicate. Mechanization has thus had the double impact of \nraising the break-even rent for large tenants and increasing the optimum farm size.\n66. Poor and modest peasants in the village who are leasehold tenants frequently complain bitterly about the \npractice of tacking on additional years at the whim of the landowner. A lease will be three or four seasons from \nexpiration when the landowner suddenly shows up and announces that he wants rent for another so many seasons \nimmediately. There follows a rush by the tenant to raise the required cash for fear of losing the land when the \ncurrent contract runs out. When such sudden demands are condemned, it is usually in terms of the wealth of the \nlandlord who, it is implied, has no business making such demands on tenants who are poorer than he. Thus \nRokiah, who leases land from her younger brother (an outsider), who often comes to ask to extend the contract, \nnotes that he has rubber land, a car, and three wives and denounces him as \"very stingy\" (sangat berkira).\n  \n< previous page\npage_167\nnext page >\n",

Before, wealthy landlords rented to tenants who were poorer \nthan themselves and that relationship was reflected in the traditional social ideology of tenancy. Now, however, \nlandlords rent to a new breed of tenants who are as rich and, in many cases, richer than themselves. Few poor villagers \nfail to note with bitter irony that, today, harvesting and increasingly tenancy is becoming the preserve of the rich, not the \npoor. Sukur, a landless laborer speaks for most: \"Before they rented land to the poor. Now you can't rent land at all. The \nrich rent to the rich and the poor live off (tumpang) the poor.\"\nWho should be blamed for leasehold tenancy? The answer is not obvious. One might hold the Chinese responsible, as \nthey are commonly seen as the successful bidders. One might hold the Malay landlords responsible. Or perhaps one \nmight even hold the state responsible for allowing pajak tenancy.67 In fact, the bitterest resentment is reserved for the \nMalay landlords, whose desire for the greatest profit has led them to ignore the needs of their relatives, their fellow \nvillagers, and their race. When I occasionally asked directly who was to \"blame\" (salah) for a particular leasehold \ntenancy, the landlord or the (Chinese) tenant, I nearly always got the same answer. For example:\nThe landowner is to blame; he won't give {the land} to Malay people. (Rokiah)\nThe landowner, he wants only the money and he auctions the land, saying, \"Who will bid most?\" (Lazim)\nThey {landlords} won't rent land to their own race. (Razak)\nTaib, one of the poorest men in the village, has discovered that his younger sister, who lives nearby and owns 1 relong, \nhas leased it for ten seasons (M$500) to a Chinese shopkeeper. Mustapha, a young man looking to rent in land, is in the \nsame boat; his mother has rented, pajak, her 2 relong for eight seasons to a Chinese tractor owner. While neither of \nthem have any affection for the Chinese who have taken land which they would like to rent themselves, they are most \ndismayed by the failure of their own immediate family to consider their interests. As Mustapha says with an air of \nhelplessness, \"I can't even work my mother's land.\"\nWe have encountered this \"logic of accusation\" before in the view of combine-harvesters. It is not the strangers, the \noutsiders, who are most often singled out for censure. After all, they are beyond the moral reach of the community; they \ncan only be expected to take advantage of opportunities that come their way. Relatives, fellow villagers, Malays, on the \nother hand, are seen as members of\n67. One reason why the state might be held responsible is that the Paddy Act of 1967 in effect prohibits \nleasehold tenancy by limiting tenancy agreements to one year.\n  \n< previous page\npage_168\nnext page >\n",

Thus, it is possible to appeal to \ntheir sense of responsibility. Mat Nasir, for example, could say that he had appealed (rayu) to his relative to rent to him \nby the season rather than to lease land to a stranger. When that relative ignored his appeal, it was entirely appropriate \nthat he should feel a sense of betrayal. Appeal and betrayal are concepts that are, quite simply, inapplicable beyond the \nfrontiers of an imagined community. It makes no sense to appeal to a Chinese combine owner to forgo his profits to \nsave Malay jobs or to feel betrayed when he pays no heed. For the large Malay landowner who hires the combine or \nleases out his land to a Chinese shopkeeper, however, matters are different. Something more can be expected from him; \nhe is seen to have obligations to friends, neighbors, and relatives that can be betrayed. It is largely for this reason that \nmany of the changes associated with the green revolution in Kedah have had a more profound impact on class relations \namong Malays than on relations between races.\nRituals of Compassion and Social Control\nIn Sedaka, as in any peasant society, there is a large variety of ritual ties that lie beyond immediate relations of \nproduction and serve both to create and to signify the existence of a communityone that is more than just an aggregation \nof producers. The particular ritual ties that involve gifts and exchanges between rich and poor are sensitive barometers \nof the vicissitudes of class relations. While they are not, by any means, connected to production relations in some crude \nmechanical fashion, they are nonetheless sensitive to changes in the realm of production. Using these gifts and \nexchanges as a valuable window on the transformation of class relations, it will become apparent that, as the poor have \nbecome increasingly marginal to the growing of paddy, so have they become increasingly marginal to the ritual life of \nthe village. There have traditionally been three major forms of ritual gift giving joining the rich and poor in Sedaka. \nThey include what villagers call the zakat peribadi, or \"private\" Muslim tithe, sedekah, or derma gifts, and kenduri, or \nritual feasts to which other villagers are invited. All are either required or at least sanctioned by Muslim law as it is \nunderstood in the village. After a brief explanation of each form, I will examine how each has changed and how these \nchanged have been experienced by classes in the village.\nThe zakat peribadi is to be distinguished from what most peasants call the zakat raja, the sultan's or government's zakat. \nThe latter is the \"official\" zakat, owed by all but the very smallest cultivators, collected in paddy by an appointed local \nofficial (the amil, in this case Basir), and paid to Kedah's Department of Religious Affairs. Although the proceeds are \ndevoted to specified works of Islamic charity, the tithe is generally resentedand widely evadedby cultivators for\n  \n< previous page\npage_169\nnext page >\n",

A part of this zakat peribadi is actually collected by the amil at the same time the zakat raja is \ncollected and is designated by the giver, according to his or her wishes, as a contribution to the mosque (zakat mesjid) in \nnearby Kepala Batas, to the village hall, which functions as prayer house, religious school room, and meeting place \n(zakat madrasah), and/or to the imam of the mosque. Private donations are also given personally to the mosque \ncaretaker (Tok Siak) and to the popular religious teacher Lebai Sabrani, whose religious classes include many local \nchildren. Collectively, this portion of zakat peribadi might be termed gifts for religious services, and it comprises \nroughly two-thirds of all zakat peribadi. The remainder is given to other individuals, including especially poorer \nrelatives, neighbors, friends, and wage workers who have helped with the planting and harvesting.69\nIt is this last category alone that might be called redistributive. We are by no means, however, dealing with vast \nquantities of paddy; the total zakat peribadi given out by villagers amounts to something like one hundred and ten \ngunny sacks or less than 2.5 percent of an average village harvest.70 Of that amount, the potentially redistributive share \nis not more than forty gunny sacks, or less than 1 percent of the harvest. Even if we were to add the small voluntary\n68. Evasion of the zakat raja merits a study in itself as an example of peasant resistance to the state. Here I \ncan note only a few particulars. Of those seventeen small-scale cultivators whose harvest is sufficient to \nsubject them to the zakat raja but is less than fifty gunny sacks, only three pay anything at all to the amil. \nAmong middle and well-to-do peasants, no one, not even the amil, paid the full zakat due the state. For the \nentire village, the zakat raja actually paid is something on the order of 15 percent of what would be required if \nthe regulations were adhered to strictly. Villagers complain that only paddy farmers are systematically taxed, \nwhereas others who are richer (settlers on rubber and palm oil schemes, businessmen, non-cultivating \nlandlords) are rarely taxed. They observe that none of the proceeds has ever found its way back to the village, \nand they suspect that much of it is siphoned off along the way to Alor Setar.\n69. These categories often overlap. Thus a cultivator may give zakat peribadi to a brother or nephew whom he has \nemployed as a wage laborer and who may also be a neighbor.\n70. Nor is all of this distributed within the village, since gifts are often given to relatives and wage laborers living \noutside Sedaka. By the same token, however, a certain amount of zakat peribadi is also received by the poor of \nSedaka from relatives and employers residing elsewhere. The figures cited here are necessarily approximate, as the \namount of zakat given or received by any individual is frequently a matter of dispute, with the rich often \nexaggerating their generosity and the poor minimizing their receipts.\n  \n< previous page\npage_170\nnext page >\n",

The religious and social reasoning behind it is \nbest illustrated by the pamphlet distributed by the State Religious Council of Kedah.71 After noting that Islam does not \ndiscourage the faithful from becoming rich, it asserts that the rich have an obligation to share a portion of their wealth \nwith those who are poor and without property, and it quotes an injunction from the Koran: \"And those who store up \ngold and silver and do not follow the path of Allah, let them know with the sharpest torment.\"72 The purpose of the \nzakat, it continues, is not only to discourage stinginess (sifat-sifat bakhil) but to promote social harmony among the rich \nand the poor: \"To cleanse those who receive zakat of jealousy and hatred toward the owners of property (tuan-tuan \nharta). To harmonize (merapatkan) the social relation between the haves (golongan berada) and the have-nots.\" The \nzakat is accepted by villagers in much the same spirit. They typically say that they give zakat peribadi in order to \n\"cleanse {from sin} (cuci) their property.\"\nThe degree to which property is cleansed by voluntary zakat gifts varies enormously in the village. A few substantial \nproperty owners are quite generous with zakat peribadi, while others give almost nothing. Thus, Abdul Rahman gives \nover eight gunny sacks of paddy to relatives, workers, and religious officials, while Haji Kadir gives less than one sack. \nA small number of quite modest peasants give prodigiously, considering their means. Bakri bin Haji Wahab, a modest \ntenant on 4 relong, gives six gunny sacksone eachto the families of those who have transplanted or harvested for him, \nand Rosni, a wage worker and tenant herself, gives away six gunny sacks divided between religious officials, poorer \nrelatives, and a villager who worked for her (Pak Yah).73 Others give nothing.\nThe amount of grain that poor villagers receive as zakat depends on their reputation, how good the paddy crop has been, \nand how much they have worked in a particular season. Thus Pak Yah and Mansur each received three or four gunny \nsacks of paddy after the irrigated season harvest of 1979, during which there was more manual work available than \nusual, owing to flooding. In each case, they received zakat only from those for whom they had threshed but not from all \nof them. Hamzah, the \"zakat champ,\" does somewhat better, but a portion of the grain he is given is in recognition of his \nservices as caretaker of the village prayer house (surau). Impoverished villagers who do not enjoy a good reputation \nfare much worse, even when they thresh regularly; Taib and Dullah\n71.

What is notable here is that when the poor receive zakat is \nalmost entirely from their employers and its payment is rather carefully calculated according to the respectability of the \nrecipient. It functions not only to \"cleanse property\" but also to promote labor control and social conformity.\nSedekah and derma are almost interchangeable as forms of alms or contributions. Unlike zakat, sedekah is not tied to \nthe harvest, is not always paid in paddy, is as often requested by the needy as simply given unasked, and is almost \nexclusively given to the poor. Derma differs only in that it is more often a collection made house-to-house for a \ncharitable purposecommonly to help a poor family pay funeral expenses, as in the case of Razak's daughter.74 Both \nsedekah and derma are seen as \"good works\" in the context of Islam for which the benefactor, if of pure heart, will be \nrewarded. In the village context, at least, such gifts are smallfor example, enough milled rice (beras) for a few meals.\nThe third major form of what might be considered \"charity\" are the kenduri, or feasts that constitute the basis of much \nof the village's ritual life. Unlike zakat or sedekah, these are collective rituals marked by both prayer and a communal \nmeal the sponsoring family provides to invited guests.75 Kenduris may be held for a host of reasons, but the most \ncommon, roughly in order of frequency and importance, are: marriage feasts (kenduri perkhawinan, kenduri \nbersanding, kenduri emas khawin); feasts to pray for the dead, which often double as feasts to celebrate some good \nfortune such as a son passing his exams (kenduri kesyukuran, kenduri arwah); circumcision feasts (kenduri berkhatan, \nkenduri masuk Jawi); pregnancy feasts (kenduri mandi tian); cradle feasts (kenduri berendul, kenduri buaian); infant \nhair-cutting feasts (kenduri cukur rambut); house-moving feasts (kenduri usung rumah); new house feasts (kenduri naik \nrumah baru); and feasts for a fulfilled wishoften for a child of the sex desired (kenduri berniat). Both rich and poor \nsponsor kenduri, but the rich are naturally expected to sponsor them more often, more lavishly, and for a larger number \nof guests. Expenses, especially for sponsors of modest means, are met partly by donations in kind or cash by guests, \nalthough\n74. Occasionally house-to-house collections are made by older Muslims from outside the village, who hope \nthereby to raise funds for the pilgrimage to Mecca. These donations are called derma as are donations to \nreligious schools. Thus derma appears to have a more specifically religious connotation.\n75. More rarely, as in a keduri kekah (haircutting ceremony, but in Sedaka, at least, seen as a religious feast in \nwhich three or seven families slaughter a larger animal and hold a feast to pray for the souls of their ancestors), \nkenduri masuk Jawi (circumcision ceremony), or kenduri tolak bala (feast, held in a field to ward off misfortune \nsuch as drought), several families will collaborate (berpakat) in a single feast. This last feast, held to have \ndisappeared by many authorities and frowned upon by official Islam, was held twice in Sedaka during my stay, in \neach case because the rains were late.\n  \n< previous page\npage_172\nnext page >\n",

Ritual \nfeasts of this kind are the traditional means by which the well-to-do validate their status by conspicuous consumption in \nwhich their friends, neighbors, relatives, and often the entire village are invited to share.\nWhen any form of charity is discussed by villagers, there is virtual unanimity for the view that, as a species of social \nrelations, it has declined precipitously. Even the well-to-do farmers are in accord on this point, although many of them \nhasten to exclude themselves individually from the charge while pointing their finger at those who are even better-off. \nThe village headman, Haji Jaafar, says the decline in charity began with double-cropping. Abdul Rahman, a substantial \nlandowner who is renowned for his generosity, notes that even zakat peribadi is rarely given today and that sedekah \nhardly exists at all. The rich would rather, he says, sell their paddy and invest the cash in buying or renting in more land. \nMat Isa, a fairly well-off tenant, gives voice to the general consensus when he claims, \"The rich are arrogant (sombong); \nthey don't take {the plight of} the poor seriously; {they're} cheap with sedekah, and {they're} reluctant to give it.\"77 \nThe village poor often put the facts bluntly. In the words of Rokiah, \"The rich don't give anything to the poor.\"\nFor kenduri, there is also a consensus, albeit one with a slight wrinkle. Initially, the new profits of double-cropping in \n1972 unleashed a memorable burst of feast giving that was unprecedented in Sedaka. Pak Haji Kadir, who then owned a \nbattery-operated loudspeaker, can remember renting it out over seventy times in little over a year for kenduri. Nearly \neveryone, including small tenants and landless laborers, took advantage of their new-found prosperity to celebrate \nrituals they could not have afforded earlier. The kenduri of the poorer villagers were necessarily more modest, but even \nthey were able, for a time at least, to emulate the ritual decencies that help to define citizenship in this small community.\nAfter this short period of euphoria, both the frequency and scale of feasts has, by all accounts, been sharply reduced. \nFew villagers would find much to disagree with in Kamil's account of what has happened since then. \"Before,\" he \nclaims, \"kenduri were big, even to the point of leasing out 10 relong for a few years {to cover expenses}.\" \"Now,\" he \nsays, ''people are a bit more clever\"; they figure\n76. I have heard that in some villages kenduri, especially for marriages (kenduri bersanding), can turn a profit \nwhen many guests are invited from town who will contribute M$ 10 or more toward expenses. A cursory \nexamination of the gifts (which are generally noted down in writing for later reciprocation when the guest in \nturn gives a feast) and expenses for kenduri suggests that this is unlikely in Sedaka. Paid entertainment of \nvarous kinds is also provided at large kenduri.\n77.Orang kaya sombong; tak ambil berat orang susah.

The \nreason for the curtailing of ritual feasts by poor peasants is obvious; since at least 1976, their income has become more \nprecarious. For richer peasants, the decline in the quality and number of kenduri is more a question of attitude than of \nresources. Most villagers would agree with Dullah's explanation that ''The rich cut corners; they don't want to waste \nmoney.\"79\nThe affluent farmers in Sedaka are by no means tongue-tied when it comes to explaining why so little zakat peribadi or \nsedekah is given to the poor. They make, in effect, three arguments, any one of which would be sufficient to justify their \nposition. The first is nearly a point of law, inasmuch as the nonhandicapped, working poor do not fall into any one of \nthe eight categories of recipients who, according to Islamic regulations, are eligible to receive zakat gifts. Kamil takes \nthe position that the government, since it established the state zakat system a decade or so ago, does not approve of \nzakat peribadi outside official channels. The implication is that private gifts of this kind are not only wrong but possibly \nillegal now.\nA second argument, typically thrown in for good measure, is that there is virtually no one in the village who is truly in \nneed of charity. Thus Haji Salim, the richest man in the immediate vicinity, asks rhetorically, \"Why give zakat to those \nwho are hard up? They have land, they grow paddy like us.\" Here, the appeal is to a kind of conceptual equality \nbetween all those who cultivate rice. We are, he implies, all on basically the same footing here and hence there is no \nneed for zakat or sedekah. It is true, of course, that most of the poor in Sedaka do own or rent rice land, however \nlilliputian its size; that fact allows Haji Salim to make something of an abstraction of the difference between those who \nrent 1 relong and those who own 20. Another rich villager, Lebai Pendek, avails himself of the same argument and adds \nthat, since those who thresh his\n78. The shorthand ranking of kenduri, a nearly infallible guide to their sumptuousness, is by the kind and \nnumber of animals slaughtered for food. Thus, to say that the kenduri was an affair of twenty chickens is to \ndescribe what a modest feast it was. In order of declining prestige value, the meats in question are: water \nbuffalo, cows, goats and sheep, chickens, and more rarely, fish, the everyday staple. The mythical granddaddy \nof kenduri in village lore is one held by the Sultan of Kedah at the marriage of his daughter; he is believed to \nhave sold Penang and Province Wellesley to pay for it, and over two hundred water buffalo were eaten.\n79.Orang kaya pakai nipis; tak mau membazir duit.\n  \n< previous page\npage_174\nnext page >\n",

If one \naccepts his logic, then it becomes pertinent to wonder why the practice of giving zakat peribadi to wage laborers was so \nwidespread until at least 1975. The anomaly, I believe, is resolved by considering zakat peribadi as, in part, a system of \nlabor control that was necessary when harvest labor was scarce but is no longer required now that combine-harvesters \nare easily available. Mat \"halus,\" a landless laborer, captures what has occurred in precisely these terms: \"The well-off \ngave out zakat peribadi so that they could call forth the work (panggil kerja). Poor people went everywhere. They \ncalled and we went. Now we go even without zakat peribadi because we need the work.\" It is certainly possible that \nwealthy villagers always considered the zakat given to harvest workers as an illegitimate imposition, perhaps even as a \nform of labor blackmail. The difference may be that now, thanks to the combine, they are able to make their opposition \nto zakat peribadi stick.\nThe third and last line of defense against zakat to harvest workers is one that is familiar by nowthe claim that many, if \nnot most, of the village poor are not fitting objects for charity. Thus Haji Salim asks, \"Why should we give zakat \nwithout good reason to people who don't want to work?\" He then illustrates the improvidence of the poor by saying that \nsomeone who got zakat last year sold the paddy to buy an expensive (M$35) pair of shoes. \"He wears fancier {shoes} \nthan the well-off.\"80 Prosperous villagers invariably mention the ever serviceable Razak and other poor villagers whom \nthey consider more or less disreputable (for example, Dullah, Midon, Taib, Mat \"halus\") to explain the decline in zakat \nand sedakah. The charges include lying (bohong), cheating (tipu), and laziness (segan). To the extent that this category \nbegins to include most of the village poor the problem of charity is thus solved at one stroke. Giving help to such \npeople, they imply, would only encourage such behavior. And here too we can see that the practice of zakat peribadi \nserves the purpose of social control as well as that of labor control. The rich put the poor on notice that only those who \nconform closely to their standard of correct conduct are eligible for their largesse. The only notable exception to this \npattern is when death intervenes and even the poorest villager is accorded the minimal decencies.81\nAs for kenduri, there are still a few well-off villagers who have a reputation for not scrimping. Abdul Rahman and the \nheadman, Haji Jaafar, in particular, rarely let a season go by without a sizable kenduri to which all the village is invited. \nOther substantial villagers typically admit, sometimes with a trace of embarrassment, that they have become more \nclever (bijak, cerdik) about feasts to\n80.Dia pakai lagi hebat dairpada orang senang.\n81. The other possible exception is before Hari Raya Puasa (the feast day to celebrate the end of the fasting \nmonth), when a spirit of greater generosity prevails comparable, perhaps, to the Christmas spirit in Christian \ncountries.\n  \n< previous page\npage_175\nnext page >\n",

It is a rare landowner who, like Haji Nayan, rejects the custom altogether and says, \"Stupid \npeople give kenduris.\"\nThe potential beneficiaries of zakat gifts, alms, and feasts have, as one would imagine, a quite different view. There is, \nof course, the lament for the loss of income they and their families have suffered; each of them can recount exactly what \nthey have lost in grain and from whom. But that is by no means the whole story. There is also anger and bitterness made \nall the more galling by the fact that their losses have come at a time when prosperous villagers have been reaping the \nprofits of double-cropping. The blame, as usual, is personalized; it is laid at the door of the rich, whose desire for further \nprofit has led them to repudiate their obligations to their poorer neighbors. When the poor say, as they frequently do, \nthat the rich are becoming stingier, it is above all the refusal of charity they have in mind. The account given by Sukur \nwould be familiar to the other poor peasants in Sedaka. He remembers when zakat peribadi was given immediately after \nthe threshing to all those who had worked. Now, he says, the paddy is all sold and loaded directly onto the trucks bound \nfor the rice mill. The employer then has little grainthe traditional currency of charityin storage and will contend that his \ncash has gone to pay off debts. This ploy allows him to plead poverty when in fact, Sukur explains, the rightful zakat \n(zakat betul) for 10 relong would be enough (fifteen gunny sacks) to take care of many village poor.\nThere is also the humiliation of asking for sedekah, and occasionally for zakat, and being refusedan experience that is \nfar more common today. Hamzah, one of the more \"reputable\" poor, speaks with more feeling about this humiliation \nthan about the gain he is denied. Before the harvest last season, when work was scarce and his family had nearly run out \nof rice and cash, he asked some of his usual employers for loans of rice as an advance on future wages. The results were \nmeager. \"I felt embarrassed asking friends {for help}. It's a pity; it reaches the point where I have to go everyday to ask. \nI'm ashamed.\"82 When his mother died, he had to ask for help with funeral expenses. Rokiah, with few resources of her \nown, gave him M$150 immediately but Haji Kadir, the richest man in Sedaka, for whom he often worked, gave him \nnothing. \"I went to ask Haji Kadir; he didn't give {anything}; I knew he wouldn't.\" As is usual in these cases, the refusal \nwas not a blunt rejection but a cold shouldersilence (sengap). Later in the year I listened to Hamzah grumble to a friend \nabout being short-changed on wages by Haji Kadir. He had helped fill and sew gunny sacks with paddy disgorged from \nthe combine-harvester, for which he expected a wage of 50¢ a gunny or M$25 for the fifty gunny sacks he had done. He \nwas given only M$5. When I asked whether he complained (merungut), he explained, \"Poor people can't {complain}. \nWhen I'm sick or need work, I may have to ask him again. I am angry in my heart.\" Here then is the bitterness, the \nswallowed bile,\n82.Berasa malu minta kawan. Sayang; sampai hari-hari pe minta. Malu.\n  \n< previous page\npage_176\nnext page >\n",

They say 'you grow rice, too.' They say, 'If you don't have enough to eat, you're lazy.' \nThey never help.\" Like Pak Yah and others, he knows what the rich say about the poor. The village poor are caught in a \nsituation where the old assumptions are no longer valid. Before, they could expect zakat from employers and ask for \nsedekah, or advance wages, with a reasonable expectation of receiving something. Now they may ask, but only at the \npotential price of a humiliating rebuff. A gift refused in this fashion is not simply grain foregone but, above all, a stark \nsocial signal that the relationship between the rich and poor, which the request assumed to be in force, has been \nunilaterally declared null and void. The rich have given notice that they are no longer responsible for the pressing needs \nof the village poor.\nIn the decline of the feast-giving cycle in Sedaka, the poor see the same symptoms of social withdrawal and selfishness \nby the well-to-do. No longer, says Mat \"halus,\" are there feasts that last the whole night and at which three or four cows \nare eaten. Instead, the rich \"think about money; they just want to invest their money.\"84 \"Before, rich people wanted to \nmake a big name (buat besar). Now they do just a little bit; they're clever. Before they wanted to show off (tunjuk-\nmenunjuk) and now they don't want to waste money.\" Where they might have spent M$2,000, he adds, they now spend \nonly M$200. Sukur, putting himself in the shoes of the rich, performs what he imagines to be their calculations. \"If a \nkenduri will cost $500, they ask, 'How many things can we buy for that?'\" Instead of a kenduri, they decide to buy a \ntelevision set. The rich, he concludes, ''think only of this world.\" For others, like Taib, what is most grating is to be \nhired for work but not invited to his employers' feast. As he puts it, \"If it's a question of work, the well-off have to go \nlooking for the poor; if it's a feast they go look for a lebai or haji [someone who can lead chants and recite from the \nKoran], not poor people.\"\nIn this last comment by Sukur, we can capture the religious tone of his accusation. To think beyond this world is to \nthink of Allah's judgment (hukum Allah) and thus to be generous and sympathetic to those who are less fortunate.\n83. Tok Mahmud's 4 relong, 3 of which he farms, are now more than adequate for his modest household of \ntwo. Ten years ago, however, he was substantially poorer owing to his large family.\n84.Kira duit, mau pusing duit saja.

Moreover, according to folk beliefs among \nthe poor, the punishment for a failure of generosity is not confined to Allah's final judgment. Hamzah, with others, \nbelieves that generosity with feasts, zakat, and sedekah serves to protect rich people against such misfortunes as \naccidents and illnesses. This is why, he says, those who make the pilgrimage to Mecca always give a kenduri before \nsetting out. When I wonder out loud how this applies to Haji Kadir, whose tightfistedness is renowned but who appears \nto enjoy robust health, Hamzah immediately reminds me of his wife's long stay in the hospital, her fall down the steps, \nand Haji Kadir's recurring back trouble. All of these misfortunes, he implies, are a sign of Allah's displeasure. It is \nhardly far-fetched to read into this interpretation an attempt, albeit feeble, by the poor to exert their own modest form of \nsocial control over the rich. Nor is it farfetched to suggest that there is only a very short step between believing that the \nmiserly rich will be punished in this world and the next and actually wishing on them the misfortunes and judgments \nwhich, by their conduct, they have called down on their own heads.\nThe Remembered Village\nAs we listen to the rich and poor of Sedaka attempting to make sense of the massive changes they have all experienced \nover the past decade, we find ourselves in the midst of an ideological struggle, however small in scale. It is a struggle \nover facts and their meaning, over what has happened and who is to blame, over how the present situation is to be \ndefined and interpreted. Having lived through this history, every villager is entitled, indeed required, to become \nsomething of a historiana historian with an axe to grind. The point of such histories is not to produce a balanced or \nneutral assessment of the decade but rather to advance a claim, to levy praise and blame, and to justify or condemn the \nexisting state of affairs.\nAs in any history, assessing the present forcibly involves a reevaluation of what has gone before. Thus, the ideological \nstruggle to define the present is a struggle to define the past as well. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the accounts \ngiven by poor villagers, who have had the least to be thankful for over the past decade and whose current prospects are \nbleak. They have collectively created a remembered village and a remembered economy that serve as an effective \nideological backdrop against which to deplore the present.85 They remember when rents\n85. Lest this seems a particularly peasant form of consciousness, it is worth noting that Francis Hearn regards \nthis imaginative appropriation of the past as a key element in the early solidarity of the English working class. \nDomination, Legitimation, and Resistance: The Incorporation of the Nineteenth Century English Working \nClass (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood, 1978), chap. 1.\n  \n< previous page\npage_178\nnext page >\n",

They remember the time before mechanization, when \nlarge landowners sought them out as tenants and when rents were modest. They remember when harvest work was \nplentiful and larger farmers curried favor with them by giving advance wages, loans, and zakat gifts and throwing larger \nfeasts to which they were always invited.\nIt is not that their memory is faulty. The older customs and practices to which they point did exist and worked to their \nadvantage. Their memory is, however, quite selective. It focuses precisely on those beneficial aspects of tenure and \nlabor relations that have been eroded or swept away over the last ten years. That they do not dwell upon other, less \nfavorable, features of the old order is hardly surprising, for those features do not contribute to the argument they wish to \nmake today. Their nostalgia, if one may call it that, is thus, like their memory, a highly selective affair. The central \nreason why the account of the village poor smacks of nostalgia is that so many of the innovations of the past decade \nhave worked decisively against their material interests. They have ample cause to look back fondly at older \narrangements. The well-to-do of Sedaka, as we have seen, are not above nostalgia themselves. But it is not so \npronounced precisely because they have a far greater stake in the current arrangements, which are decisively in their \nfavor.\nSuch reconstructions of the past in the service of present interests recall Hegel's dictum that \"the owl of Minerva flies \nonly at dusk.\" There is no doubt, for example, that the losses suffered by Sedaka's poor in the last few years have \ninspired them to cast a new and sympathetic eye on the older arrangements. Ten years ago these arrangements would \nnot, in all probability, have elicited such praise; they were then part of the taken-for-granted practices that had governed \nrice production for some time. It is only against the background of the new threats posed by double-cropping that such \nroutines have been elevated to the status of revered customs, rights, and entitlements. It is only now that the revalued \npast has become necessary to assess a menacing present.\nThe ideological work of the poor can be seen as an attempt to right a world that has been almost literally turned upside \ndown by double-cropping. Everywhere they look they see dramatic reversals of the traditional production relationsall of \nwhich undermine both their sources of livelihood and their status in the village. Before, large landowners rented land \nout to poorer tenants; now they rent increasingly to wealthy entrepreneurs or farm their land themselves with \nmachinery. Before, large farmers hired poorer neighbors to plough and harrow their fields with water buffalo; now they \nhire wealthy tractor owners to prepare their land. Before, larger farmers hired poorer neighbors to transplant their \npaddy; now many of them broadcast their own seed. Before, these same farmers hired the poor to reap and thresh their \ncrop; now they hire wealthy combine owners for the same job. Before, well-to-do villagers had good reason to provide \nadvance wages and give zakat payments to their work force; now, if\n  \n< previous page\npage_179\nnext page >\n",

Before, the village rich had good reason to build a \nreputation with lavish feasts; now many of them regard such large feasts as a waste of money. Taken together, these \nreversals call into question virtually every assumption that governed the social relations of production before double-\ncropping.\nThe new dispensation has also transformed the preexisting class structure of Sedaka and most other paddy villages on \nthe Muda Plain. In that earlier class structure, rich peasants and larger landowners were joined to land-poor villagers in \na symbiosis of dependency and exploitation. So long as land was reasonably plentiful and labor, at peak seasons, was \nreasonably scarce, there were limits to exploitation, although land concentration proceeded apace through moneylending \nand default. This symbiosis found expression in village ritual lifefor example, zakat peribadi, kenduri, advance \nwagesand also in political life, where local party leaders, who were invariably well-to-do, could be relied upon to bring \nmost of their dependent tenants and laborers into the fold. The middle peasantry was, by contrast, somewhat more \nautonomous, since they were less reliant on the rich for land to farm or for wages and they rarely hired workers, \npreferring to use (or exchange) household labor.\nThe new relations of production have broken most of the direct dependencies that characterized the earlier class system. \nEconomically marginalized by mechanization and shifts in tenancy, poor villagers increasingly find themselves ritually \nmarginalized as well. Kinship and indirect patronage (distributed by the state through local elites) still tie many of them \nto the ruling party, but their subordination is no longer embedded in village relations of production. Before double-\ncropping, one might describe them as poor, second-class, citizens of Sedaka. Now, they remain poorthough spared the \nextremes of malnutrition and hungerand certainly second-class, but it is increasingly difficult to justify calling them \ncitizens.\nThe question naturally arises, in this or in any other economic transformation in which a subordinate class has suffered a \nreversal in its fortunes, as to how such reversals are understood and interpreted. Later in my analysis I will want to \nexamine the heavy consequences an answer to this question has for the larger issues of class consciousness, false-\nconsciousness, resistance, and ideological hegemony. Here, however, it is sufficient only to note the general tenor of the \nanswer as reflected in the discourse of the village poor.\nThere is no way in which the participants' interpretation of the impact of the green revolution in Kedah can be deduced \nfrom the crude economic facts. Such facts are compatible with any number of intepretations: they could be accepted as \nfatalistically as a drought or flood; they could be seen as the fulfillment of prophecy or of Allah's punishment for \nstraying from the true faith; they could be seen as the malevolent effects of government policy or the result of the greed \nand resources of Chinese syndicates.\nIn fact, as we have seen, none of these interpretations figures very prominently,\n  \n< previous page\npage_180\nnext page >\n",

Instead, the poorer strata of Sedaka see the causes of their present distress as primarily personal \n(that is, a result of human agency), local, and largely confined to the Malay community. The increasing use of leasehold \ntenancy and the dismissal of smaller tenants, for example, is seen as caused by the desire of large landowners (mostly \nMalays) to capture more of the profits of cultivation for themselves. The growth of labor-displacing combine hire is \nsimilarly viewed as a result of large farmers hoping to save the money and bother of hiring harvest hands. The reduction \nin local charity likewise reflects the new willingness of the rich to protect their wealth at the expense of their reputation. \nIn each case, the logic of blame and condemnation is much the same as that applied to the class of landowning Hajis \nwho were held responsible for the loss of mortgaged land. The more distant and impersonal causes that most assuredly \nplay a role here are upstaged by a perspective that emphasizes moral lapses, selfishness, and the violation of social \ndecencies. As the poor see it, the rich have callously chosen to ignore their obligations to their neighbors. How else are \nwe to understand the tendency of the poor to focus at least as much on the disrespect and contempt they now confront as \non the material losses they have suffered?\nThe poor are, of course, not the only ones in the village to make use of such logic. While wealthier farmers \nacknowledge the speed and profitability of combine-harvesters, they also insist that the poor have become unreliable, \nchoosy, and indolent workers who are no longer entitled to their consideration. In this fashion, the rich, too, find a \npersonal and moral rationale for the dramatic reversals in village social relations.\nNeither the rich nor the poor, however, fail to see the broader and more impersonal forces that have shaped their \ncircumstances. The poor, and many of the well-to-do, understand that the desire for accumulation and investment lies \nbehind the new dispensation. Both understand the new possibilities that double-cropping and mechanization have made \navailable. Every villager carries in his head an impressive personal and collective economic history replete with time \nseries for fertilizer, seed, rents, paddy, rice, fish, consumer durable prices, wage rates, and crop yields that may, for \nolder peasants, go back as much as half a century. As in any oral history of this kind, the dates are tied to events\"the \nJapanese period\" (masa Jepun), \"when my first child was born,\" \"before double-cropping\" (se-belum dua kali padi), and \nthe focus is on the consequences of these figuresfor example, income, access to land, the availability of work. The poor \nknow exactly how much they have lost to the combines; the rich know exactly how much they have gained. Within the \nambit of their local experience, they understand the workings of capitalism. Rich and poor alike see that Chinese \nentrepreneurs pay premium rents for land leases because they own farm machinery and because they cannot let their \ncapital lie idle. As they say: \"the Chinese have to keep their money circulating (pusing duit).\" They understand that the \nowners of the new means of productiontractors, combines, trucksnow capture the returns previously destined for water \nbuffalo owners, harvest\n  \n< previous page\npage_181\nnext page >\n",

The poor fully understand that \nmany of them have been proletarianized as they have lost their tenancies. Rokiah is not by any means the only one who \nhas noted that \"they want to make coolies of us,\" though she adds defiantly, \"They can't do it.\" The poor also understand \nthat they are being progressively marginalized; they talk about having no work, of being pushed aside (tolak tepi), of \nfacing the prospect of leaving the village altogether.\nIf the poor dwell upon the local and personal causes of their distress, it is thus not because they are particularly \n\"mystified\" or ignorant of the larger context of agrarian capitalism in which they live. They do not, of course, use the \nabstract, desiccated terminology of social scienceproletarianization, differentiation, accumulation, marginalizationto \ndescribe their situation. But their own folk descriptions of what is happening: being made into coolies, the rich getting \nricher and the poor becoming poorer, and being \"pushed aside\"are adequate and, at the same time, far richer in emotive \nmeaning than anything academic political-economy could possibly provide.\nThe choicefor it is a choiceto fasten on the more immediate sources of their difficulties contains elements of both \nconvenience and strategy. It is convenient for the poor to blame those who are most immediately and directly \nresponsible for their recent reverses. They observe their Malay landlord taking his land from them to farm himself or to \nrent out to a Chinese entrepreneur; they do not directly observe the concentration of capital in land use. They observe \nthe large farmer who stops hiring his neighbors and calls in the combine-harvester; they do not directly observe the \nsyndicates or government policies that have made this possible.\nTheir choice is also strategic because it focuses on precisely those human agents who are plausibly within their sphere \nof social action.86 They have some hope of influencing their landlord or the larger farmer for whom they work; they do \nnot have a prayer of influencing either the Chinese commercial farmer or the syndicates of machine owners. After all, \nthose who rented them land or hired them in the past described their action as \"helping them out\" (tolong), thus \nimplying a kind of noblesse oblige in keeping with village norms. It is only\n86. In this context it is worth recalling Simmel's analysis of the differences in class conflict in early capitalism \nas opposed to what he calls \"mature capitalism.\" In the latter, labor conditions are, he claims, seen as the \nproduct of \"objective conditions\" or \"forms of production.\" \"The personal bitterness of both general and local \nbattles has greatly decreased. The entrepreneur is no longer a bloodsucker and damnable egoist.\" To the \ndegree that it prevails, this larger, more ''objective,\" view is likely to reduce conflict. Whether it is a more \n\"objective\" view, however, is questionable; the \"personal\" view, however narrow, has the merit of recognizing \nthat processes like the market and technological innovations are social creations.

Each man, finally . . . carries on some form of intellectual \nactivity . . . he participates in a particular conception of the world, has a conscious line of moral conduct, and \ntherefore contributes to sustain a conception of the world or to modify it, that is, to bring into being modes of \nthought. \nAntonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks\nIdeological Work in Determinate Conditions\nDouble-cropping and mechanization in Sedaka have presented rich peasants and landlords with a host of unprecedented \nnew opportunities for profit. These opportunities have, with few exceptions, been eagerly seized.\nTo exploit these new chances for capital accumulation, however, large farmers and landlords have stripped away many \nof the economic and social ties that previously bound them to poorer villagers. They have had to hire machines in place \nof village laborers, raise rents, dismiss tenants, and cut back their ceremonial and charitable obligations within the \ncommunity. In doing so, they have found themselves operating in something of an ideological vacuum. What we \nobserve in Sedaka and elsewhere on the Muda Plain is an emerging capitalist agrarian class which has been steadily \nshedding its ties to laborers and tenants but which acts in a largely precapitalist normative atmosphere that makes it \nextremely difficult to justify the actions it has taken. They are, in this sense, capitalists who are obliged to explain \nthemselvesto justify their conduct publiclywithout the benefit of the elaborated doctrines of a Malaysian Adam Smith, \nlet alone a Bentham or a Malthus. This ideological handicap is, as we shall see, only partially circumvented by a rather \ntortured but creative attempt by rich farmers to bend the facts of the case to suit themselves.\nThe historically given, negotiated, moral context of village life is one in which, if only ideologically, the cards are \nstacked against the newer forms of capitalist behavior. This moral context consists of a set of expectations and \npreferences about relations between the well-to-do and the poor. By and large, these expectations are cast in the idioms \nof patronage, assistance, consideration, and helpfulness. They apply to employment, tenancy, charity, feast giving, and \nthe conduct of daily social encounter. They imply that those who meet these expectations will be treated with respect, \nloyalty, and social recognition. What is\n  \n< previous page\npage_184\nnext page >\n",

It was once in their interest to employ \nharvest laborers and to ensure their loyalty with advance wages, gifts (for example, zakat peribadi after harvest), and \ninvitations to feasts. It was once in their interest to take on tenants to farm their surplus land and to adjust rents after a \npoor harvest in order to keep good cultivators. It was not only in their interest to behave in this fashion, but it was also \nin their interest to describe this behavior in ideological terms as assistance, help, kindness, and sympathy. They thus \nclothed their behaviorbehavior that made eminent good sense when land was relatively plentiful and labor relatively \nscarcein the language of patronage and liberality. No cynicism is implied here, only the universal tendency to put the \nbest possible face on one's actions. Nor is anything necessarily implied about whether poorer villagers fully accepted \nthis social construction of their behavior, although it is unlikely they would have challenged it publicly.\nA word of qualification is in order about the social scope of this professed patronage and liberality. It applied with \ngreatest force to the bilateral kinship group and to residents of the same village. Where close kin lived in the same \nvillage, the claim to consideration was particularly strong. The greater the distance from the core of this charmed circle, \nthe more attenuated the claim to special consideration.\nWithin these limits, both the \"ideology\" and the practice of liberality are, today, more than just a fading historical \nmemory. They exist, albeit in truncated form, in kinship tenure, lower rents for village tenants, surviving forms of \ncharity, village feasts, and preferential hiring. Not even mechanization has completely eliminated the need for casual \nlabor from time to time, for transplanters, or for a loyal political following. Thus, the rich farmers of Sedaka are not yet \nable to dispense entirely with the precapitalist normative context of village life.\nThey do, however, wish to limit radically the applicability of these values in which they once had a far greater vested \ninterest. The full application of these values today would prevent them from stripping away the social obligations that \nstand between them and the profits of the green revolution. How they go about this \"ideological work\"their strategy, its \nlogic, its applications, and the resistance they encounteris the subject of this chapter. I begin with the concept of \nexploitation as it is embedded in language and practice and then show how the rich and poor each manage to bend the \nfacts so as to make these values serve partisan, class goals. Since these values are fashioned only through social conflict, \nI examine their practical use in three social conflicts: the attempt to raise land\n1. See F. G.

Finally, I pause to explore the meaning of \nsymbolic and ideological struggle in Sedaka.\nThe Vocabulary Exploitation\nBefore examining how different classes of villagers maneuver to reinforce or alter the normative context of local \nconduct, it is essential to establish what that context is. The beliefs and practices surrounding class relations are by no \nmeans cut-and-dried, for like any set of norms they are the historical product of continuous struggle and negotiation. It \nis possible, however, to identify the broad outlines of what this process of struggle has yielded, and what now forms the \nnormative environment of current discourse. This normative environment is perhaps best reflected in the vocabulary of \nexploitation as it is used in Sedaka.\nAs is so often the case, the terms and categories used by intellectuals and/or bureaucrats are an indifferent guide to the \nterms that humbler citizens use to describe the same situation. Thus, the loaded term green revolution (revolusi hijau) \nused in official papers and documents describing irrigated rice cultivation on the Muda Plain is rarely heard in the \nvillage; instead it is simply called \"double-paddy-cropping\" (dua kali padi). The same divergence of elite and \"folk\" \ncategories of discourse is even more apparent in the case of exploitation.\nThere is a standard Malay verb (tindas, menindas), which may be accurately translated as \"to exploit, to oppress, to \ncrush, to rule unjustly.\" It is in common village use to cover such banal acts as the crushing of body lice between one's \nfingernails. Except for one or two younger villagers who were obviously showing off their school learning, however, it \nis not used to express the concept of exploitation.2 Other words that carry much the same meaningamong them tekan, \nkejam, peras, desak, sesakare occasionally heard in village conversations. Each conveys the sense of physical \npressurepressing, squeezing, pushing, chokingthat makes it an appropriate vehicle for suggesting extortion and \noppression. Thus, when Nizam bin Haji Lah's landlord, Haji Zahir, insisted on shifting to a higher rent and a two-year \nleasehold contract, Nizam told me, \"He wants to squeeze (tekan), he wants to gobble up (makan) everything.\" And \nwhen local members of the opposition complain that only ruling party members have a chance of being accepted as \nsettlers on government land schemes, Dullah adds, \"The government really oppresses (tekan sunggoh) us; we can't stir \n(bergerak) at\n2. The term is in use both in left-wing scholarship in the Malay language and occasionally in the speeches of \nopposition political leaders. The government, wary of the Marxist tone the word has acquired, uses it \nsparingly and then usually only to condemn Chinese middlemen, who are said to exploit Malay peasants, \nfishermen, and rubber tappers.\n  \n< previous page\npage_186\nnext page >\n",

    "chunk_full": "< previous page\npage_187\nnext page >\nPage 187\nall.\" Some phrases that suggest exploitation carry this physical metaphor even further and imply that exploiters insist on \ntheir pound of flesh. Thus a poor villager refers to officials who \"sit on soft chairs\" and \"beat on (tutuh) the backs of \nvillagers.\" Another mentions landlords who \"plough the backs (menenggala atas belakang) of villagers.\"3\nThere is, then, hardly any linguistic shortage when it comes to expressing the notion of exploitation. And yet the verb \nmost consistently in favorthe one most often heard in daily conversation and the one with the richest connotationis the \nverb \"to eat\" (makan). To get a salary is \"to eat a salary (makan gaji), to collect interest is \"to eat interest\" (makan \nbunga), to take bribes is \"to eat bribes\" (makan duit), to betray one's friends is \"to eat one's friends\" (makan kawan \nsindiri), to drive someone hard is ''to eat their bones\" (makan tulang), to exploit another is \"to eat their sweat\" (makan \npeluh orang).4 The most common formulation is simply, \"He wants to eat us\" (Dia mau makan kita). Here the \npeasantry's historical preoccupation with food and the accusation of what amounts to cannibalism are joined together in \na powerful, suggestive metaphor.5 As we have seen, moreover, the metaphor is used not only by the poor to describe \nwhat is done to them by the powerful but is used also by the rich to describe the demands for loans and charity pressed \non them by the poor.\nWhat is remarkable, though, is that the local vocabulary of exploitation is to be found less in this collection of verbs, \ntaken together, than in the concepts of stinginess and arrogance. When a tenant rails against his landlord for raising the \nrent, he may or may not say privately that the landlord is extorting (tekan) from him or \"eating\" (makan) him. But he \nwill almost certainly accuse the landlord of being stingy or greedy (kedikut, kikir, bakhil, berkira, lokek, tamak, keras \nhati, tankai jering, haloba) and, often, of being proud or arrogant (sombong). A poor villager whose request for a loan \nor charity from an employer has been spurned may not say privately that his employer is oppressing him, but he will \nrarely fail to complain that he is tightfisted and without shame. The terms in which these backstage accusations are cast \nconstitute the core of \"folk\" concepts of exploitation in Sedaka. Taken collectively, they embody something close to an\n3.Gabus (pronounced gabuih in Kedah dialect), \"to rub or scour,\" is also used occasionally in this same sense.\n4. The concept of blood sucking is also in popular use, and an oppressive landlord or moneylender may be called a \n\"land leech\" (lintah darat) or be accused of sucking blood (isap darah). The \"land\" in land leech is to distinguish \nthe real thing, which is to be found in water or wet areas, from its human equivalent on dry land.\n5. The same verb with the same connotation is encountered elsewhere historically in Southeast Asia. A district \nofficial in precolonial Burma, for example, was called a myo-sa, the \"eater\" of a district. The Thai equivalent is kin \nmuang. The Malay official appointed by the Sultan to rule a district was known as the Akan Pemakannya. In most \nof these permutations, the use of the verb \"to eat\" also implies that the activity is an alternative to honest work.\n  \n< previous page\npage_187\nnext page >\n",

That he exploited his fellow Malays is hardly in doubt, but it is his surpassing \nstinginess that is the center of attention. We have seen in the previous chapter how frequently the accusation of \nstinginess rises to the lips of villagers. When Nizam bin Haji Lah complains of his landlord's oppression (tekan), he also \nexplains that oppression by citing his stinginess (berkira) and heartlessness (keras hati). Rosni characterizes her \nlandlord as very calculating or stingy (sangat berkira), and the fact of exploitation is left to be inferred from his \nconduct. Rokiah cannot expect any leniency from her landlord, who is her own brother, after a poor season and speaks \nbitterly of his heartlessness (keras hati) as well. When Taib laments the difficulty of renting in land these days he \npoints, as do others, to the \"greed\" (lokek) of landowners as the cause. Yaakub, who depends on wage labor that has \nlargely evaporated since the combines arrived, attributes their use to the fact that large farmers are \"more stingy\" (lagi \nkedekut) these days. Tok Kasim, when he notes that charity and large kenduri are much rarer now, adds, by way of \nexplanation, that the rich are now stingier (susab berkira la'ni). Even the wealthy outside landowner Haji Nayan, noting \nthat many dismissed tenants have had to emigrate, attributes their plight to landlords who have resumed cultivation by \nmachine because they are now \"more calculating\" (lagi susah kira).\nThe perceived changes in the attitude of wealthy villagers and the manner in which they are condemned are not entirely \nnew phenomena on the Muda Plain. In his study of credit in the nearby state of Perlis just before the initiation of \nirrigated double-cropping, Mokhzani reported:\nWhenever village conversation was steered to the subject of mutual help and the offer of cash loans as part of \nsuch help to fellow villagers, it rarely failed to raise statements bemoaning the decreasing cooperation \nbetween villagers and the increasing difficulty of raising friendly loans. Such statements were always \naccompanied with reference to the fact that people in the village are becoming increasingly calulating \n(berkira) in their approach to money matters. Villagers would then unfailingly hark back to what was termed \nas the \"old days\" when people were always ready to offer aid.6\n6.

What has occurred, surely, is that the impact of mechanization has greatly sharpened these \ncomplaints and swelled the backstage chorus of accusations to a new level.\nAll of the accusations of stinginess contain, as we saw in the case of Haji Broom, a clear viewan ideology of sortsof the \nrelations that should obtain between the rich and the poor. In their dealings with the poor, most especially those who are \nkin and fellow villagers, the rich should be considerate (timbangrasa), helpful (tolong), and unselfish (senang kirathe \nopposite of berkira or susah kira). Such behavior, as the poor see it, would involve providing employment, tenancies, \nloans, charity, and suitable feasts. The well-to-do who lived up to this standard of conduct would provide the standard \nof nonexploitive, proper conduct.\nThat these standards are embedded to a considerable degree in the very language of accusation receives odd \nconfirmation from the sentences used to illustrate some of the key terms in standard Malay dictionaries.8\nWord\nMalay Illustrative Sentence (Translation)\nKedekut (stingy)\nIt is not easy to request alms from him, because he is a stingy \n(kedekut) person.\nBakhil (stingy)\nThat stingy (bakhil) rich person doesn't give alms to poor \npeople.\nTimbang rasa (sympathy, considerateness) Assistance that shows sympathy (timbang) toward people who \nsuffer hardship.\nMiskin (poor)\nHe always contributes money to people who are poor (miskin).\nSegan (unwilling, reluctant, shy, lazy)\nHe is reluctant to give assistance, even though he is a rich man.\n \nIn each case, \"stinginess\" is associated with the refusal of the rich, specifically, to help the poor; sympathy is associated \nwith charity, and the poor are defined as fitting objects of that charity.\n7.

Raymond Firth's classic study, Malay Fishermen: \nTheir Peasant Economy, was based on fieldwork in the east coast state of Kelantan before the Japanese occupation. His \ndiscussion of wealth and charity would be very familiar to the villagers of Sedaka:\nOn the whole, in this area men of wealth have accumulated their property by industry and saving. These two \nfeatures, combined with the practice of charity enjoined on the rich, probably account to a considerable extent \nfor the absence of any marked feeling of resentment towards the wealthy on the part of the poorer elements of \nthe community . . . Where resentment and criticism do enter is when the rich man does not show himself \ngenerous, when \"his liver is thin,\" when he does not practice charity to the poor, build wayside shelters or \nprayer houses, or entertain liberally.10\nMuch the same ethos was reported by M. G. Swiftthis time in Jelebu, Negri Sembilan, during research in the mid-1950s.\nThe relations of the rich with villagers not poor enough to be dependents are also not good. The strength of \nbitterness and jealousy are striking . . . The rich are the obvious source of material help, but since there are \nonly a few of them in each village, they are continually subject to demands, while they do not have occasion \nto seek help themselves. The recipients accept the help they give not with gratitude, but as a right, for the rich \nare their kin, or their neighbors, and they are wealthy; a small gift is nothing to them. This one-sided \nrelationship creates resentment, for the rich resent having to give all the time while their good nature is not \nsufficiently recognized. The recipient of help resents having to ask for it, and not receiving more.11\nIn the mid-1960s, S. Ali Husin conducted a comparative study of leadership in three villages, one of which was no more \nthan twelve miles from Sedaka. His comments on wealth and status in all three communities reflect the findings of Firth \nand Swift.\n9. For an argument that this ethos is relevant in many peasant contexts, see James C. Scott, The Moral \nEconomy of the Peasant: Subsistence and Rebellion in Southeast Asia (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1976), \nchaps. 1 and 6.\n10.

A mean or squandering wealthy man is detested, but on the other hand, those who \nare generous with their money are often held in affection and respect.12\nFinally, in a recent sociological study of a village in the state of Melaka (Malacca), Narifumi Maeda examined the \npractice of charity and the sanctions surrounding it. He concluded:\nUnilateral gift-giving is supported by the ethos of Islam, and mutual help, which may be more strongly \nperceived as an insurance against future contingencies, by communal feeling. In the former case {zakat raja}, \nrecipients are anonymous under the category of poor and needy. In the latter, the helper and the helped have a \nspecific relationship, for example, they are neighbors or relatives. Those who are in a position to help a \nparticular individual are expected to do so in case of need.13\nFrom these diverse studies it appears that quite similar expectations circumscribe the relations between rich and poor in \nthe Malay village. The point here is not whether these expectations are consistently observed in practice but rather that \nthey do exist and that, when they are violated, their violation calls forth the resentment and condemnation we have \nobserved. The legitimacy of these expectations is triply guaranteed. First and foremost, they correspond with the \ncustomary values of Malay village life. They are, in addition, powerfully reinforced by a popular Islam that enjoins \ncharity and compassion from the rich. Nor, finally, should we overlook the way in which two decades of electoral \npolitics by the ruling Malay party (UMNO) has contributed to sustaining this normative legacy. The party has fashioned \nan electoral machine based largely on patronage politics within the Malay community and has counted on its largesse to \ngain for it the deference and loyalty to win elections. Its implicit model for state-peasant relations is remarkably like the \nethos we have been examining.\nThe ethos described above is gradually losing its sanctioning power in Sedaka, but it is far from moribund even among \nwealthier villagers. It is invoked, in effect, whenever a large farmer describes the work, or zakat peribadi, he gives to a \npoorer villager as \"help\" (tolong). It is invoked in the shared ideology of Islam, which requires charity as a means of \n\"cleansing\" wealth and promoting social harmony. It is invoked, by implication, whenever a relative or neighbor is given\n12.Malay Peasant Society and Leadership (Kuala Lumpur: Oxford Univ. Press, 1975), 76.

Though under \nsiege, all of these practices are still a part of the reality of contemporary village life. It is invoked as well whenever rich \nvillagers criticize even wealthier outsiders for renting their land in huge parcels to big entrepreneurs rather than \nconsidering the needs of their own people.\nSome quite remarkable and unique empirical findings, reported recently, shed further light on this ethos and its \noperation. Akimi Fujimoto examined four paddy villages in Malaysia (two in Province Wellesley, two in Kelantan) to \ndetermine whether rent levels, land prices, the amount of land rented out, and the wages and volume of agricultural \nlabor in these communities can be explained entirely by neoclassical assumptions of maximizing net return.14 He \nconcluded in each case that actual practice did not coincide with these assumptions and that noneconomic income-\nsharing assumptions were necessary to explain sub-optimizing outcomes. Thus a good many landowners did in fact take \non more tenants, charge lower rents, hire more laborers at higher wages than were compatible with maximizing their net \nreturn. They did so, it is clear, less from a spirit of liberality than as a response to the palpable pressures their neighbors \nand kin brought to bear upon them. The small redistribution that results is hardly sufficient to affect materially the \nexisting inequalities; it does, however, indicate that the ethos has some impact on existing practices.\nBoth the ideology that enjoins a certain liberality by the well-to-do and its actual practice are realms of constant, if low-\nlevel, ideological conflict. This is to be expected, inasmuch as they have far-reaching implications for the distribution of \nland, work, and income as well as for the distribution of prestige, status, and subordination. Nowhere is this more \napparent than in the use and interpretation given the verb tolong (to help, aid, assist), which is typically used to describe \nsuch liberality.\n\"Help\" extended by one villager to another, when it is described as tolong, carries the implication of a mutuality that \ntakes place among conceptual equals. It covers such common occurrences as the short-term loan of water buffalo or \nkitchen utensils, the last-minute request for a cooking ingredient from a neighbor, and the (now disappearing) mutual \nexchange of field labor for transplanting or harvesting (derau).15 For my purposes, what is important about tolong is \nthat it implies an equivalent (not identical) return favor by the recipient at some later time. To help, in this fashion, does \nnot imply any subordination of the receiver to the giver. Even when the help is given by the manifestly well-to-do to a\n14.

A landless peasant who inquires \nabout renting land from a large landowner is likely to ask if the landowner will \"help\" (tolong) him. Requests for \ntemporary loans or advance wages take virtually the same linguistic form. In all these cases, a term implying reciprocity \nis appropriate in part because a return is built into the situation; the tenant will pay rents and cultivate, the borrower \nexpects to repay, and the laborer will work for his or her advance wages. When it is a better-off villager who asks for \nservices from a poorer person, tolong is also employed. The farmer who approaches his neighbor for help with \ntransplanting, with repairing bunds, with cutting or threshing, will invariably ask if the neighbor can \"help\" him, even \nthough the work will be paid.\nThe effect of the use of tolong in such exchanges is to emphasize the conceptually equal status of the parties involved, \nalthough the \"facts\" of the matter may be otherwise. It is to the advantage of richer villagers to use this formula because, \nas we have seen, they have a stake in minimizing the actual differences of property and income that exist. For the poor, \nthe use of tolong is, quite literally, a face-saving formula that spares them the humiliation of being seen openly as \ninferiors or dependents. The exchange of \"help\" is thus to be sharply distinguished from relations of charity, which do \nindeed imply subordination and inferiority. To ask for alms (minta sedekah), which implies no reciprocal favor, is to \nplace oneself in a permanent position of debtand hence, subordinationto one's benefactor.16 Razak is the only person in \nthe village who has been systematically willing to go to this demeaning length to seek assistance.\nJust who is helping whom and how muchwho is the social creditor and who the debtorin relations described as tolong is \nalways a contested social fact. The matter is further complicated by the fact that shifts in land tenure and demography \nhave upset the rules of the game. When harvest labor was scarce, before combines were available, it was at least \nplausible that the reapers and threshers were doing a favor by gathering in a farmer's crop in good time. This \ninterpretation was reflected in the widespread practice of farmers giving zakat peribadi bonuses in paddy to those who \nhad worked on the harvest. One purpose of the bonus was certainly to create a sense of gratitude and thereby socially \nobligate the wage laborer to the same promptness and diligence in the coming season. For their part, however, laborers \ncame to view the zakat bonus not as a gift but as a rightas a part of the normal, anticipated pay for the harvest work. \nMuch the same might be said of the tenant's relation to the landlord well before double-cropping. Then, villagers \nmaintain, tenants were in short supply and land to farm was plentiful. Given his other opportunities, it was arguable that \na good cultivator who accepted a tenancy was helping his landlord. Re-\n16. Even here, however, folk Islam holds that the recipient of alms is in effect doing a favor for the almsgiver \nby providing him with the opportunity to perform an act of religious merit and thus to earn a reward (pahala) \nfrom God.\n  \n< previous page\npage_193\nnext page >\n",

Members of the \nupper class wish to maximize the discretionary character of the benefits at their disposal, because it is precisely this \naspect of their power that yields the greatest social control and, hence, conformity. For their part, members of the lower \nclass strive to transform discretionary favors into rights to which they are automatically entitled to lay claim. Should \nthey succeed, there is no longer a favor to be recognized with deference, no social subordination, no humiliation. The \nmost likely outcome, of course, is a continuing struggle, expressed in language and gestures, over the meaning of such \ntransactions in which no one view entirely prevails.17\nNow, of course, the opportunities for wage labor and tenancy are sharply reduced. It is no longer so ambiguous who is \ndoing the greatest favor for whom; both the tenant and the wage laborer count themselves fortunate to have land and \nwork and acknowledge, by their public deference, their indebtedness. Landlords and farmers hiring labor can, and do, \nplausibly, contend that they are \"helping\" a tenant or a laborer merely by engaging him, even though the rents may be \nhigher and inflexible and the work more sporadic and onerous. The meaning of \"help\" and its social weight is thus \ndependent, to some degree, on the need of the recipient, and this need is in turn an artifact of the near monopoly that \nlarger farmers now enjoy over income-earning opportunities. The poor of Sedaka, as we have seen, privately resent the \nloss of status inherent in the new situation, but a due regard for their livelihood obliges them to steer a course of public \nprudence.\nDespite the fact that the use of tolong preserves the facade of conceptual equality between villagers, it has always been \nclear that \"help\" is expected to flow predominantly in one directionfrom the relatively well-off to the needy. This \nexpectation is best seen in the astonished anger provoked when the norm is flagrantly violated. For five years Tok \nAhmad and Shamsul had jointly rented nearly 10 relong of paddy land from Haji Din, a very wealthy outsider, at a high \nseasonal rent. When Haji Din announced that he expected his tenants to pay him, above and beyond the rent, a few \nsacks of paddy as zakat, they were indignant. As Tok Ahmad put it to me, \"He came himself to ask. He wanted to eat \nzakat from us! How is that possible? It is as if we {are expected} to help\n17. One of the best discussions of this process is to be found in Georg Simmel, \"The Poor,\" pp. 15078 in \nGeorg Simmel on Individuality and Social Forms, ed. Donald N. Levine (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, \n1971). Another insightful analysis focusing on similar relations between staff and inmates in prisons may be \nfound in Thomas Mathiesen, The Defenses of the Weak: A Sociological Study of a Norwegian Correctional \nInstitution (London: Tavistock, 1965), 15564.\n  \n< previous page\npage_194\nnext page >\n",

That he could \nmake such a request directly is a further sign that he is without shame. Here, as elsewhere, social values are reinforced \nby religion. Islam, in this respect and in others, is not a reason for resignation and meekness but a set of values from \nwhich a condemnation of the rich may be fashioned. It would be difficult to find any disagreement with Tok Kasim's \nunderstanding that \"The rich are enjoined to help (di-suruh tolong)\" and that those who violate this injunction \"are not \nafraid of God.\" It is certainly from the poorer villagers that one hears this norm most insistently evoked. But it is firmly \nembedded in the language of their better-off neighbors as well.\nWhen, as is increasingly the case, the well-off farmers of Sedaka fail to help their needy relations and neighbors with \nwork, loans, zakat, and smaller favors, they open themselves to two charges. The first is the familiar one of stinginess \nand tightfistedness. As Tok Kasim notes, \"The rich were generous (senang kira) before. We could ask for help (minta \ntolong). Now it's hard to ask for their assistance. Now they 'watch the pennies' (pakai nipis).\" Abu Hassan, speaking of \nHaji Kadir's unwillingness to rent out any land to him, also links the refusal to help with the accusation of stinginess. \n\"Some time ago, those who had more land wanted to help (tolong) those without land. They were generous but now \nthey're clever (cerdik), they really calculate (kira sungguh).\"\nThe second charge is broader and quite revealing. It is the charge of being arrogant, proud, conceitedof placing oneself \nabove and hence outside the village community. If the charge of stinginess implies the denial of generosity, of help, the \ncharge of arrogance implies the denial of the conceptual equality of villagers. Accusations to the effect that someone is \nconceited (sombong, bongak, bongkak) are perhaps the most common and most damaging popular form of character \nassassination in Sedaka. They are most often, but not exclusively, directed at the well-to-do. The opposite characteristic, \nthat of acting modestly (merendahkan diri, malu) is highly valued, and the best-respected local figure, Lebai Sabrani, is \ntypically praised in precisely these terms. His religious learning and healing skills give him great prestige, but he has \nnever put on airs.\nAt its simplest, the charge of arrogance can result from any denial of the common decencies of social intercourse that \none villager expects of another. A villager who refuses or fails to return a greeting on the village path is open to the \ncharge. Anyone who fails to invite certain of his neighbors to a feast runs a\n18.Dia datang sindiri minta. Dia mau makan zakat sama kita. Macham mana boleh? Macham kita tolong dia. \nIn effect, of course, Haji Din was after what is called tea money (duit teh), a premium for the privilege of \ncontinuing to rent, which he chose to exact in kind and to legitimize as zakat. Such requests, if made at all, \nwould be expected to come indirectly in view of how morally offensive they are.\n  \n< previous page\npage_195\nnext page >\n",

Even someone who keeps to himself and avoids the lively banter that is the small change of village \nreciprocity may be accused. And, of course, anyone who, by the way he or she dresses, speaks, or walks, betrays an \nattempt at superiority will be singled out for being sombong.19 Young men who stay in the village studying, usually in \nvain, for years to pass the High School Certificate Exam and find a government job, and who refuse to work in the \nfields, are often considered sombong. In all of these instances, what is involved is not the failure of villagers to \nrecognize the existing differences in income, property, education, religious knowledge, or skills that are part and parcel \nof village life. Rather, it is a question of requiring that villagers act in a way that recognizes a common local citizenship \nand mutuality or, in other words, the conceptual equality of other villagers.20\nWealthy villagers are especially liable to the charge of being sombong for two reasons. First, it is they who are most \nlikely to place themselves above others and who have the means of doing so with comparative impunity. Second, since \nthey are more able to help their fellow villagers, their obligations of citizenship, as it were, are conceived to be that \nmuch greater. On the analogy that Sedaka is \"one family\"an analogy frequently made by villagers in the context of \npointing out the shortcomings of somea wealthy man who turns a blind eye to the needs of his kin and neighbors is \nthereby placing himself above others and is seen as sombong. As Mokhzani points out in his study of rural credit, the \nwell-off who refuse loans to their neighbors in an emergency will be called sombong.21 The terms stingy and arrogant \nthus form a natural pair when applied to the rich. When Mat \"halus\" talks about how the attitude of the well-off has \nchanged in the last decade, he says, \"They're stingier, they're more arrogant\" as if it amounted, in his mind, to the same \nthing. Mat Isa, referring to outside landowners in the same context, comments, \"The rich are arrogant, as before;\n19. As a case in point, two teenage women who lived in the village and attended the nearby Sekolah Arab \ntook it into their heads to begin wearing the robe and head covering required for school as their normal dress, \neven when school was out. They were obviously attempting to show their piety by adopting self-consciously \nIslamic dress. It was interpreted by villagers, however, as an attempt to place themselves above others \nreligiously. The two braved the resulting storm of quiet abuse and shunning for more than a week before \nsuccumbing and resuming the standard sarong without head covering when at home.\n20. Of course, the accusation of arrogance is often directed at outsiders with whom villagers must deal as well. \nThis includes, among others, district officials, clerks in the district office, staff of the Farmers' Association, clerks \nat the government rice mill (LPN), nurses and doctors at hospitals and clinics. The difference is that, with such \noutsiders, arrogance is expected and anything short of arrogance is a welcome exception. Within the village, by \ncontrast, arrogance is an unwelcome exception.\n21. Mokhazani, \"Credit,\" 71.\n  \n< previous page\npage_196\nnext page >\n",

The view is hardly confined to them, \nhowever, and it is common to hear well-to-do villagers criticize in precisely the same terms large, outside landowners \nwho resume cultivation or who lease huge plots to commercial tenants. But we miss much of the social import behind \nthe charge of sombong by seeing it merely as an effort to call the rich to order by appealing to shared values. To avoid \nthe accusation, a wealthy villager must not only attend to the most pressing needs of his kin and neighbors, but he must \ndo so in a spirit of tolong, that is, in a manner that does not shame or humiliate the recipient. The benefactor must act in \na fashion that preserves at least the form, if not the substance, of mutuality. To do otherwise will not exempt even the \ncharitable rich from the accusation of being arrogant. What is demanded, ironically, is patronage that is not patronizing. \nHere it is as if the poor of the village want to have their cake and eat it too. They attempt, symbolically, not only to \nenjoin charity and assistance but simultaneously to negate the \"social premium\" the rich might expect to extract as \ncompensation for their generosity.22 They attempt, in other words, to protect their vital material interests while at the \nsame time minimizing the public social stigma that systematic relations of one-sided charity usually bring in their wake.\nThe charge of arrogance is, however, a double-edged sword. If modest peasants in Sedaka make use of it to influence \nthe rich, the rich for their part also make use of it, more successfully, to control socially the behavior of the poor. In the \ntalk of wealthy farmers, arrogance is often imputed to the more aggressive, less deferential poor who violate their view \nof what constitutes seemly behavior. The accusation covers especially those villagers who demand help (tolong) or \ncharity as a matter of right and who thus fail to evince the appropriate gratitude to their benefactors, whether by \ndeference, small services, loyalty, or social support. It also covers wage laborers, men or women, who insist on settling \nthe wage rate before they come to work. From the farmer's point of view, these matters should be left to his discretion \nand so should the timing of the payment for harvest work after he has sold his paddy. Laborers who violate these \nexpectations (often because of bitter past experience) are seen as \"uppity\" (sombong). The poor who refuse work or, \nworse, accept and fail to appear, fall in the same category. Thus Lebai Hussein privately castigates a number of poor \nvillagers who shun work but still expect zakat from farmers. He claims they are difficult (payah), uncooperative (rukun \ntidak mau bikin), and proud (sombong). Haji Kadir criticizes\n22.

In fact, Shahnon provides a sketch of this \"ideal type\" in the course of \npraising a man who comes seasonally from his mother's village to work for him. This man, a distant relative, always \ncomes when Shahnon needs him to thresh; he works carefully to thresh each sheaf thoroughly; he returns every day \nuntil the harvest is completed, he never asks what the wage is and when it will be paid but leaves that up to Shahnon; \nand he never asks for a zakat bonus, leaving that, as well, to Shahnon's discretion. For workers from Sedaka itself, the \ncriteria are similar but more extensive. A good worker should not only take any work at any wage when an employer \nasks, but, unlike many of the poor, he should not be given to slandering the rich behind their backs. He should be \ndeferential, that is, not sombong or payah.\nThat this composite sketch of \"the good poor\" is an \"idea type\" of which any actual poor person is a pale reflection \nbecomes evident if one classifies the village poor by their reputation among the well-to-do. The category of \"good poor\" \nis, then, nearly empty! Abdul Rahim, Hamzah, Mansur, and Pak Yah have the best reputations for being willing workers \nwho defer to their employers; but even here, opinion is divided. A good many more poor villagers have an unambiguous \nreputation for being proud and choosy, including Mat Nasir, Dullah, Taib, Mat \"halus,\" Rokiah, Rosni, Omar, Sukur, \nand, of course, Razak. As one might expect, the most deferential poor are not so highly thought of by their poor \nneighbors as by the rich. I have heard other wage laborers in the village disparage particularly Abdul Rahim and Mansur \nas ''yes men\" or slaves (tukang suruh, hamba) who simply do the bidding of their employers.\nHere again, in the petty realm of pride and arrogance, we encounter a small ideological struggle over the social control \nof poor village workers. The traits of deference and loyal service that are necessary to qualify as one of the \"good poor\" \nin the eyes of the well-to-do are traits that are seen as demeaning by other wage workers. Inasmuch as the poor have few \njobs or charity to offer one another, the struggle is an unequal one in which public behavior, at least, conforms largely \nwith the expectations of the well-to-do.\nBending the Facts:  \nStratification and Income\nThe normative context is just that: a context and not a straightjacket. It provides the setting for conflict between winners \nand losers in Sedaka. The parties to this conflict are all bricoleurs with a given set of tools or a set of variations on \nthemes that are, for the time being, largely given. Those themes include the normative expectations that those who are \ncomparatively well-off should be generous to\n  \n< previous page\npage_198\nnext page >\n",

Just who is well-off, just how generous \nthey should be, just what forms their generosity should take, just which forms of help are compatible with dignity, and \njust what behavior is arrogant and shameful are questions that form the substance of the drama.\nWithin these broad confines, both rich and poor have developed working strategies designed to make the normative \nprinciples serve their interests as much as possible.23 The rich, whose interests are most directly threatened by these \nvalues, attempt to bend them so as to minimize their obligations and to place themselves in the most favorable light. Of \ncourse, at some level, they are increasingly able simply to impose themselvesto use machines, to forego taking on \ntenants and laborers, to trim back their ceremonial and charitable burdens. They are, however, concerned with justifying \ntheir behavior, not only to others but to themselves, for they too work within the same moral confines. For the village \npoor, somewhat less bending and squeezing of existing understandings is necessary, if only because these \nunderstandings already work, symbolically at least, to their advantage. They seek, more straightforwardly, to maximize \nthe obligations due them under the existing rules.\nThe more or less constant ideological struggle that ensues is fought out, always inconclusively, on several terrains. One \nsuch terrain, the central one in some respects, is the terrain of stratification and income. Unless it is first known who is \nrich and who is poor and just how rich and poor they are, it is impossible to evaluate their conduct. Thus the first issue, \nthe first terrain of conflict, is precisely over the facts that, once established, form the framework in which social \nexpectations are played out.\nThe resounding and insistent battle cry of Sedaka's wealthy families across this terrain is, \"We are not rich.\" It is \nrepeated and repeated in a bewildering, but consistent variety of formsforms that go well beyond mere modesty. For \nexample, the rich are never caught referring to themselves, individually or collectively, by the term \"rich\" (kaya). In \nfact, they only rarely use even the term senang, or \"comfortable,\" which is most often applied to the modestly well-off \nin the village. To take what they say about their economic status purely at face value would lead to the conclusion that \nthey were barely making ends meet.\n23. For an interesting analysis of a French village in which the social ideology of patron and client are treated \nas symbolic weapons in a continuing conflict, see Alain Morel, \"Power and Ideology in the Village \nCommunity of Picardy: Past and Present,\" pp. 10725 in Robert Forster and Orest Ranum, eds., Rural Society \nin France: Selections from the Annales (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1977). As Morel notes, \n\"These two ideologies, that of the 'deserving worker' and that of the patron-employer as 'father of the village,' \nare part of a consensus, a framework that permits both parties to develop their strategies, since each can count \non certain predictable reactions.\" P. 118.\n  \n< previous page\npage_199\nnext page >\n",

Cik Yah, a divorced woman fairly well-off considering her small household, describes herself as \"just hanging \non\" (tahan duduk). Lebai Pendek, head of the second wealthiest family in the village, who farms 13 relong and owns a \ntractor, allows that he has just \"a little paddy land\" (bendang sedikit sahaja). If he is a large farmer, a man emphasizes \nhow much of his land is rented in rather than owned. If he owns a sizable plot, he emphasizes how poor the land is and \nhow many children he has.24\nWealthy villagers, in other respects as well, took great pains to emphasize that they were fundamentally no better off \nthan the generality of their neighbors. Thus they lost no opportunity to point out that they, like everyone else, were \nfarmers and that they, like everyone else, planted rice. This was, to be sure, largely true providing one was willing to \nequate the planting of 20 relong with the planting of half a relong and to ignore quite a few villagers with no land at all \nto plant. Here they took full advantage of the slender facts that still provide for the conceptual equality of all villagers so \nas to avoid standing out as privileged.\nThe local terms of stratification are not, however, symmetrical. While the rich portray themselves as barely managing, \nthe poor describe them as \"rich\" (kaya) almost without exception. They take care never to do so within earshot, but only \nprivately or in the company of other villagers of modest circumstances. The public stage is once again controlled by \nwealthy villagers but, offstage, the poor lose no time in calling a spade a spade. A few, like Bakar \"halus,\" speak of the \nwealthy collectively as the \"group\"or classof \"haves'' (golongan berada).\n24. Questions of wealth and income are of course inherently comparative, and to some extent the rich in \nSedaka have a standard of comparison different from that of the poor. Compared, say, to really big outside \nlandowners such as Haji Broom, to government clerks with a steady salary, or to Chinese storekeepers and \ntraders, they are, indeed, not so comfortable. Although something of the kind is involved in their modesty, it \nis, as we shall see, neither the only nor even the main reason for their self-description. One might also imagine \nthat much of this pattern was simply an effort to throw dust in the eyes of a naive outsider regarded with \nhealthy suspicion. Yet the pattern continued long after wealthy villagers knew that I had become familiar with \ntheir actual economic circumstances, and it was sustained, especially in any situation in which other villagers \nwere present.\nA small number of wealthy villagers, notably Haji Jaafar and Haji Kadir, would, when talking privately with me, \ndrop the pretense and occasionally boast of their holdings. This I took to be an effort to match or outdistance the \nstranger, who was paid, it seemed, a princely salary. Whenever the situation was public, however, the guarded \nfinancial modesty resumed. The occasional exception to the pattern of minimizing income and property is when \nthe question of paddy yields is involved. Here a man's reputation as a good cultivator is at war with his desire to \nminimize his wealth, and the former occasionally wins out.\n  \n< previous page\npage_200\nnext page >\n",

The poor, as we shall see, have a vested class \ninterest in emphasizing, and exaggerating, the income and property of their wealthy neighbors.\nIf the rich consistently understate and downplay their economic comfort, the poor in Sedaka follow a parallel strategy of \nemphasizing their own poverty. They insist, \"We are extremely poor.\" Thus they describe themselves to others, and \nespecially to the rich, as \"hardup\" (susah) or \"extremely hardup'' (sangat susah). Instead of using the standard Malay \nword for \"poor\" (miskin), they avoid this Arab loanword, with its demeaning connotations of begging, and use susah. \nAs part of a contrasting pair with senang, susah focuses on the quality of lifeon how difficult it is to make ends \nmeetrather than on a fixed economic status. They avail themselves of every opportunity to reiterate that they have little \nor no land to farm, that they cannot find enough work, that they have to buy some of the rice which they eat, that the \nprospect of renting in more land at a rent that would leave them some profit has all but disappeared.\nWell-to-do villagers emphatically reject this self-description of the poor as fraudulent. Haji Salim provides, in this \ncontext, what might be termed the gospel according to the rich:\nBefore we had hard-up peoplereally hard-up people. So much so that they couldn't eat. Before 10 percent had \nto buy rice, but now no one has to buy rice. Before, the hard up were many and the comfortable, few. Now we \nstill have some hard up, but they are not so many and not so hard up. When we want to call them [for work] \nwe can't find enough. They have enough (cukup banyak) and with the new comforts (kesenangan), even if \nthey don't work, they can get enough to eat and wear. [That's why] they are less diligent (rajin) about working.\nThe link here between an alleged labor shortage and the prosperity that must account for it is particularly important, for \nit is Haji Salim who is bitterly criticized by the poor for having gotten permission to bus in Thai laborers last season to \ntransplant his rice. In one form or another, however, his views are echoed by nearly all the comfortable farmers of \nSedaka. They seize on the fact that a few small tenants now hire combine-harvesters as evidence of both their prosperity \nand their laziness. Daud, the son of headman Haji Jaafar, thus notes that Rosni and Taib hired the machine once and \ncalls them lazy, because \"It's proper (sepatutnya) that those who farm only 2 or 3 relong should do their own work.\" \"If \nthey really needed money, they'd do the work themselves.\" Whenever a poor man is seen eating in a coffee shop, \nwhenever poor men or women are seen in new clothes or shoes, whenever they buy anything but the cheapest fish, \nwhenever they go off by bus to visit relatives, it is taken as further evidence that those who claim to be poor are \ndissimulating.\n  \n< previous page\npage_201\nnext page >\n",

In the \nfirst few months in Sedaka, I made a point of visiting each family to establish the basic \"facts\" of household farming \nand income. Given the pattern of local sociability, most of these conversations were joined by curious neighbors who \nhappened to be around at the time. An interesting pattern emerged. If I asked, say, a poor man how much cash he and \nhis wife had earned in planting, reaping, threshing, and other work, he would do some mental arithmetic and arrive at a \nset of figures, usually with his wife's help.25 But the figure was often contested by one or more bystanders. If the man \nsaid, for example, that he had earned M$150 threshing, someone else might say, \"No, it was a bit more; you must have \nthreshed five days for so-and-so and another week for your uncle and Haji so-and-so in Sungai Bujur.\" \"You must have \nearned at least M$200 threshing last season.'' Some time elapsed before I realized that it was invariably a relatively \nwealthy villager who disputed the poor man's estimate and that he invariably claimed the man had earned more.26 A \nsimilar quarrel often swirled around how much zakat peribadi a poor man had received from wealthier households, with \nthe well-to-do invariably asserting that the poor man had gotten one or two more sacks, or naleb, of paddy than he had \nclaimed. Such disputes were rarely acrimonious and they were always inconclusive, with each party defending a \ndifferent figure.\nA mirror-image of this pattern, with one significant difference, developed when I spoke with well-off men about their \nincome, yields, and rents. They too would arrive at a figure. In this case, however, the figure was never openly \ncontested, as it was in the case of the poor. Instead, in the next few days, the matter might come up in a conversation \nwith another small group, or I might be approached privately by someone who had been there. If the large farmer had\n25. Women typically manage most of the cash resources of the Malay family. For a fine analysis of the \nhistorical pattern of gender-based economic roles in the Malay world, see Marie-André Couillard, \"A Brief \nExploration into the Nature of Men/Women Relations among Pre-Colonial Malayan People\" (Paper presented \nat Second International Conference of the Canadian Council for Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore, June \n1982).\n26. The reader may reasonably wonder how it was possible, under these difficult circumstances, to establish the \nfacts at all. It was not a simple matter, but the disputes were typically about income at the margin; depending on \nwhose opinion one accepted, the difference was seldom more than 10 percent on either side of an average. Many \nof the facts could in fact be checked by direct observation, by asking those least likely to have a stake in \ndissimulating, or by actual records (in the case of owned land or of formal rental agreements for pajak) in order to \nestablish an estimate in which some confidence could be placed. Data bearing on actual cultivationexpenses, \nyields, area farmedwere the easiest to establish by observation over two years, while income earned outside the \nvillage was hardest to pin down precisely, although I made a point of inquiring of outside employers and \ncoworkers to cross-check quite a few figures.\n  \n< previous page\npage_202\nnext page >\n",

The men offering the revised figures, I soon realized, were invariably from the poorer \nstratum of Sedaka, and they invariably offered figures that further elevated the income and wealth reported by better-off \nvillagers. When it came to the zakat peribadi which the large farmer said he had given to laborers, the pooroften the \nlaborer in questionwould invariably insist that the zakat gifts were below what had been claimed.27\nThe fact that rich and poor peasants alike should make themselves outto me and to each otheras somewhat poorer than \nthey are is hardly of much interest. This is nothing more than the usual dissimulating pose of a class that is historically \nsubject to onerous claims which it seeks to minimize. What is of note, however, is the clear pattern found both in each \nlocal class's view of the village stratification and in disputes about income. The economic gap between rich and poor is \ndramatically different depending on which point of view one adopts. As seen by the rich, the gap is quite small; they \nthemselves are barely making do, while those who claim to be poor are actually doing quite nicely. Consistent with this \nperspective is their insistence, evident in their view of the impact of double-cropping detailed in the last chapter, that \ntheir gains have been modest and the gains of the poor, substantial. The view of Sedaka's stratification which they \npromote is one of a rather egalitarian setting where all plant rice, where neither real destitution nor real affluence exists, \nand where those who do have a bit more are generous to a fault. As seen by the poor, the economic gap is much greater; \nthe rich are much better off than they let on and the poor are very poor indeed. The view of Sedaka's stratification that \nthey in turn promote is one of great inequities, where a few privileged monopolize the land and income, where the poor \nlive from hand to mouth and are without prospects, and where generosity is rare and insignificant.28\n27. Again, the truth of such matters was not simple to determine, although the differences were small. As I \nremained through four crop seasons in the village, however, much of this information could be directly or \nindirectly ascertained. Thus, by observing actual zakat peribadi gifts, I could normally infer the most likely \nlevel for a previous season with a given yield and given paddy price. It was, in fact, in the matter of zakat \nperibadi that the claims of the well-to-do were most inflated, although the inflation declined as they realized I \nwas increasingly familiar with village patterns.\n28. In summarizing these opinions I have looked back over my fieldnotes to verify that these views were in fact \nheld by a substantial majority of rich and poor, respectively. As many as eleven of the poorest thirty-seven \nhouseholds could not be counted as part of the consensus among the poor; among these eleven, seven household \nheads did not actually disagree but were reserved or silent on many of these issues. Among the wealthiest fifteen \nhouseholds, only four were substantially out of line with the general view.\n  \n< previous page\npage_203\nnext page >\n",

These interpretations \nare provoked by the fact that the \"rules of the game,\" which impose certain standards of liberality on the rich, are largely \naccepted by most participants. What is not given, what is not fixed, however, and what can therefore be manipulated \nwithin limits is the position of a particular family or household within this pattern of established obligations. The \n\"haves\" of Sedaka minimize the inequalities because, by doing so, they also minimize their obligations to provide work, \nrice, and land to their poorer neighbors. If their neighbors are not poor and they themselves are not rich, then the \nquestion of their obligations does not even arise. As an afterthought, in effect, they add that the small differences that \nmay exist have come about for reasons (laziness, stupidity, improvidence) that disqualify the few poor in the village \nfrom any special consideration. The \"have-nots\" of Sedaka, in contrast, exaggerate the inequalities because, by doing so, \nthey also maximize the obligations the rich ought to have toward them under the existing values. Once these huge \ninequities are accepted as social fact, then it follows that the stingy and self-centered behavior of the village rich is in \nflagrant violation of a shared normative code. What we observe, in brief, is not some trivial difference of opinion over \nthe facts, but rather the confrontation of two social constructions of the facts, each designed and employed to promote \nthe interests of a different class.29\nRationalizing Exploitation\nIt is manifestly clear that most of the changes in land tenure, rents, and employment in the past decade have either \nviolated or sharply limited the applicability of earlier understandings. The question I would like to consider here is how \nthese changes have been put across ideologically, how they have been represented. How have different classes inside \nand outside Sedaka asserted their claims and pressed them in the face of resistance? To examine this issue at close range \nis to watch ideology at work where it really countsin the rationalization of exploitation and in the resistance to that \nrationalization.\nHere we are concerned with appearances, with the mask that the exercise of economic or political power typically \nwears. Things in this domain are rarely what they seem; we should expect disguises, whether they are self-conscious or \nnot. There is nothing either surprising or mysterious in this process. The executive who fires some of his work force is \nlikely to say that he \"had to let them go.\" This description of his action not only implies that he had no choice in the \nmatter but that those he \"let go\" were being done a favor, rather like dogs on\n29. What might be termed the \"middle\" peasantryroughly the twenty households directly below the richest \ntwenty householdsis difficult to classify in these terms. Their view of the village stratification is ambiguous or \nmixed; if there is any tendency at all, it is to see things rather more the way the richer villagers see them.\n  \n< previous page\npage_204\nnext page >\n",

Those who are the beneficiaries of this magnanimous act are likely to take a \ndifferent view; their metaphors are usually more colorful: \"I got the sack,\" \"I was axed.\" The victim may be excused if \nhe fails to share the executioner's perspective. Whatever term the Vietnamese peasantry used to describe what was done \nto them by U.S. forces, one may be sure that it was not \"pacification.\"30\nThe disguises, however, are diagnostic. This is particularly the case where two parties are in a continuing relationship \nthat is partly antagonistic and partly collaborative. Here the mutual claims and counterclaims are likely to be phrased in \nlanguage that each party has reason to believe the other will consider relevant and legitimate. Thus, someone asking his \nemployer for a raise is more likely to cite his diligent work, his loyalty, and his contribution to his employer's enterprise \nin support of his claim than, say, his desire for a new automobile or an expensive vacation. And the employer wishing to \ndeny the raise is more likely to cite stagnant profits, equity among employees, and the fact that the present salary is \ncomparatively generous than, say, the employer's desire to increase his own profit or to invest in a new business. What \nis of interest here is not the true value of such claims but the way in which they help us define what appears to each \nparty to be a mutually acceptable terrain of discourse.\nIn this context, it occurred to me to wonder what happened when a landlord decided to raise the rent, change the form of \ntenure, or actually dismiss a tenant. How was such a decision presented, justified, and rationalized to the tenant? In what \nterms did the tenant resist the claim? Such cases are diagnostic, because they typically involve what would seem in \nprinciple to be a serious breach of shared values. With few exceptions, someone who is relatively well-off is, in such \nencounters, attempting to extract more rent from a poorer person or to deny him or her access to the means of \nproduction. How could such a demand possibly be rationalized if it flew in the face of the injunction that wealthy \npeasants should, within their means, assist their less fortunate neighbors and relatives? To answer this question, I \ncollected as many accounts as I could of what actually was said in such confrontations.\nRaising the rent has always been a delicate matter, and yet it has of course happened with great regularity since the \n1960s. Before that, when land prices and paddy prices varied little, both tenure and rent levels were comparatively \nstable, and this stability was in part due to social pressure. As the Rice Production Committee report noted in 1953, \narbitrary rent increases were rare, \"since public opinion would make itself felt against any landlord who insisted on \nhigher rent, or who sought to eject a tenant who was cultivating with normal\n30.

I know of \nonly a single case in the village where this custom was perhaps violated.32\nJust how ticklish a matter it is to raise a tenant's rent depends, of course, on a variety of other factors. We are never \ndealing with an abstract landlord and his abstract tenant confronting one another in an abstract situation. Some of the \ncrucial factors that color the social view of the transaction are the price of paddy,33 the closeness of the kinship tie \nbetween landlord and tenant, the number of years the tenant has been farming the land, and the relative wealth of the \nowner vis-à-vis the cultivator. Generally speaking, a rent increase is easiest to put across when the price of paddy has \nrisen sharply (increasing the tenant's return under fixed cash rents), when the landlord and tenant are unrelated, when \nthe tenant is a short-term renter, and when the landlord, as occasionally happens, is manifestly poorer than the tenant. A \nhigher rent is hardest to justify when, in contrast, the reverse of all these conditions applies.\nThe case of Rosni and her landlord, Abu Saman (an outsider), falls toward the \"ticklish\" end of the spectrum. When \nAbu Saman moved to raise the rent a year ago, the price of paddy had not changed since the last rent increase in 1974 to \nM$600 (or $150 for each of 4 relong per season). Rosni's own return, due to increasing production costs, had been \ndeclining. While there was only a rather distant kinship tie between her late husband and the landlord, she and her \nhusband had rented the land from the landlord's grandfather and had farmed it for more than twenty years. Rosni is not \nwell-off; she has no land aside from these 4 relong and has managed only by dint of prodigious wage labor transplanting \nand reaping to raise her seven children since she was widowed nine years ago. Abu Saman, in contrast, is a rich man \nwith more than 25 relong of paddy land and a profitable shop.\nUnder the circumstances it is not surprising that Abu Saman avoided broaching the subject directly. He chose instead to \n\"let it be known\" (cara sembunyi\n31. Government of Malaya, Report of the Rice Production Committee, 1953 (Kuala Lumpur: 1953), vol. 1, pp. \n4546.\n32. Lebai Hussein and his son Taha claim that Tok Mah gave the 3 relong they had been farming to Pak Yah \nwithout giving them a chance to accept a higher rent. In her defense, Tok Mah claims that she had told them of her \nintention of raising the rent and took their grumbling as a refusal. The truth of the matter will perhaps never be \nknown but, for my purposes, what is instructive is that Tok Mah recognizes the custom by claiming that she had \ngiven them the right of first refusal and that they had refused.\n33. The rental increases that occurred following the sharp 1973 increase in farm-gate paddy prices were generally \naccepted as legitimate, providing they were modest. The reasoning was that the new profits could be divided \nequitably between the landowner and the tenant.\n  \n< previous page\npage_206\nnext page >\n",

Abdul Rahman, who was listening in when Rosni noted her landlord's roundabout \ntactics, explained for my benefit why he did this: \"He didn't want to come himself; he was embarrassed (malu) and \nreluctant (segan), because he's related to (adek-beradek dengan) Rosni.\"34 His interpretation is plausible because this \nindirect approach is a common practice in ticklish situations when a confrontation or a humiliating rebuff is possible. It \nis used as a means of conveying criticism35 and of broaching the delicate matter of marriage negotiations. If the \ncriticism misfires or the marriage proposal is turned down, it allows the initiator to beat a dignified retreat or even \ndisown the initiative. Abu Saman's use of an intermediary is a strong, though not definitive, sign that he knew his \ndemand ran counter to what was considered legitimate. When Rosni sent no reply back through the same channels, Abu \nSaman had little choice but to come and push his demand directly.\nAfter the required pleasantries, coffee, and cakes, Abu Saman got to the point of his visit. He needed more rent because, \nhe claimed, \"I am also in bad shape\" (saya pun teruk). His wife was ill and he had large doctor and hospital bills; he had \nborrowed money against other land he owned and had to pay this debt or lose the land. From Rosni's point of view, his \nsad tale was a completely bad-faith performance, of which not a word could be believed. But, of course, she did not \nchallenge his story openly and replied in terms of her own situation: last season's crop had been bad, her oldest daughter \nwas pregnant and could not earn anything transplanting, the children needed school uniforms, and she had little cash to \nlast her until the harvest was in. For our purposes, what is significant is that Abu Saman's case for the rent increase is \nbased entirely on need. Whether that case has any merit or notmost likely it does notAbu Saman, in effect, makes \nhimself out to be as poor or poorer than Rosni. By doing so, he affirms in effect the normative straitjacket within which \nhe must operate. The only way to justify extracting a higher rent is to portray himself\n34. The tactic of sembunyi-tau is used to broach delicate matters even between parties who are closely related \nand see one another constantly. Thus, when Haji Kadir decided that he would like his son-in-law Ghazali to \npay his rent before the season rather than after the harvest, he had his wife tell her sister-in-law, who in turn \ntold Ghazali's wife. Next season, the rent appeared in advance without a word ever having passed directly \nbetween the two principals. Had the rent not appeared, Haji Kadir would have had a choice between simply \ndropping the matter and making a direct suggestion.\n35. Criticism of my frequent social missteps early in my stay was invariably conveyed in this way. Thus, when I \nunthinkingly would occasionally whistle a tune in the house, Haji Kadir, my co-resident landlord, chose to inform \nme through his brother-in-law Shahnon that whistling in the house was dangerous, as it was believed to entice \nsnakes into the dwelling.\n  \n< previous page\npage_207\nnext page >\n",

The same logic prevails here as in \nthe question of stratification and income; a working strategy is followed that pays symbolic homage to the shared value \nof the rich helping the poor, but the facts are turned upside down to the advantage of the landlord. Abu Saman, however, \nplays his trump card toward the end of the exchange by mentioning that someone else has asked about the land. He \nneeds to say no more. The meeting ends inconclusively, but within a week Rosni sends her son with the higher rent, but \nfor only a single season, not two season. By accepting the cash and by his subsequent silence, it appears that Abu \nSaman has accepted this tacitly negotiated compromise.\nThe case of Tok Ahmad and Shamsul, who jointly rent 6 relong from another outside landlord, Haji Din, also lies \ntoward the ticklish end of the spectrum. They too have rented this land for a long time, nearly thirty years, and Tok \nAhmad is distantly related to the landlord. Tok Ahmad, who farms 4 of the 6 relong, is a middle peasant by Sedaka \nstandards but has no land other than what he rents from Haji Din, while Shamsul is relatively well-off due to his salary \nas an examiner of paddy for moisture content at the nearby government rice mill. Both, however, are far poorer than \nHaji Din, who is a retired paddy dealer owning at least 20 relong and two tractors. Unlike Abu Saman, Haji Din did not \nattempt a roundabout method of raising the rent but came directly.36 His argument, when he came to insist on M$180 a \nseason per relong rather than M$150, differed only in particulars, not in substance, from Abu Saman's claim. He also \npleaded that he was hard up (teruk) and elaborated by saying how expensive materials had become for the planned \naddition to his house, by emphasizing that he had fourteen children and grandchildren in his house who had to be \nclothed and fed, and by talking of the debts he owed on a small piece of orchard land. In a word, he claimed poverty. \nHis plight left Tok Ahmad and Shamsul unmoved. Privately, they said he was lying (dia membobong)this is, after all, \nthe man who tried to extract zakat from them, and they know how wealthy he is. In his presence, however, they pleaded \npoverty as well: the paddy price had not improved; fertilizer and tractor costs were going up; after the harvest was in \nthey had only eating rice left (tinggal makanan sahaja). The dialogue is already familiar. It is all but forced on the \nparticipants by a set of prevailing values that legitimate the claim to concessions by the poorer party. While the claim in \nthe case of Tok Shaway and Shamsul is at least plausible, Haji Din's posturing is almost pure theater, as there is no other \nway, within existing values, of justifying his claim.\nLest his story fail to win his tenants' sympathy, Haji Din availed himself of the ultimate threat. He mentioned that his \ngrandson was clamoring for land to\n36. The fact that, since 1955, this particular tenancy had been covered by a written contract extending for at \nleast two seasons at a time (pajak) perhaps precluded the informal approach, since a new agreement would in \nany case have to be filed.\n  \n< previous page\npage_208\nnext page >\n",

Faced with this warning, it did not take long for the tenants to settle reluctantly on the landlord's terms.\nAdditional accounts of a comparable kind could be multiplied indefinitely. Sukur notes that landlords have to say (kena \nkata) that they do not have any money, that they are hard up, when they come to ask for more rent. He captures the \nbelief that such performances are a mandatory routine by adding that this is also the \"tune\" (lagu) that Haji Kadir used \nwhen denying loans or advance wages. The outcome is rarely in doubt, of course, since the tenant is always afraid of \nlosing the land. \"You have to take it (terpaksa ambil) or else he'll change {tenants}.\" \"If you lose the land, it's finished, \nand you're back to hoeing for wages.\" Wahid says that his landlord always claims he \"doesn't have enough money\" (duit \ntidak cukup) when he wants more rent, although both the landlord and his wife are salaried schoolteachers who have \nbought much rubber and rice land with their savings. Ghani Lebai Mat's cousin, from whom he rents, invariably claims \nthat he is hard-pressed (sesak) financially when he wants more rent, despite the fact that he is very comfortable. Lazim \nrents land from his brother, who has a fat salary but uses the same ploy of being hard-pressed (sesak) to justify higher \nrents. The claim, in his case and others, is typically backed by details designed to justify a higher levy.\nAside from personal reversesdebts, illness, a son's improvidence, poor cropsthe landlord is likely to note anything that \nhas reduced his own return, such as land taxes and inflation, and to mention any improvement in the tenant's return from \nhigher paddy prices or a new fertilizer subsidy. The logic here is one of appealing to changes in the relative return of \nowner and tenant. If the current rent is clearly below the average rent for the area, the landlord will point that out too. In \nsuch a case, the landlord can argue that he has been too generous in the past. A fair amount of time is then usually \ndevoted to disagreements over what is the average rent, how good the land in question is, how large the harvests have \nbeen, and how much profit the tenant has received after rents and expenses. As with questions of income, the landlord \nexaggerates the quality of the land and the tenant's profits, while the cultivator loses no opportunity to denigrate the \nfield and understate his harvest and profits. These details, taken collectively, are footnotes to a discourse intended to \nestablish the relative need of each party, which in turn is the fulcrum on which shared notions of mutual obligation rest.\nThe standard scenario for these encounters is perhaps most remarkable for the homage it pays, in however distorted and \neven cynical a form, to precapitalist niceties. It is extremely rare for a landlord to forgo the ritual and present the tenant \nwith an unvarnished take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Haji Nayan claims that such crude (kasar) approaches do occur in \nwhich the owner simply says, \"This year I'm raising the rent to M$175; it you don't want the land, I'll give it to someone \nelse.\" Given the shortage of land and work, of course, it is precisely this coercive choice the tenant normally faces; \nknuckle under or lose the land.\n  \n< previous page\npage_209\nnext page >\n",

As Mat Sarif \nsays, \"The landlord has to (terpaksa) say he is hard up (susah). How else could he raise the rent?\" This is so, he \ncontinues, even though \"he really (sebenarnya) wants to buy even more land.\" It is, of course, not for me to say \nanything meaningful about the actual sincerity of the landlord's performance. The fact that its sincerity is doubted by \nmost of its intended audience, however, is an important social fact. What is, in addition, very clear is that the landlord \nhas little in the way of raw material and propsvalues, customs, or ideologythat would allow him to strike a convincing \npose.\nWhen the landlord wishes to make other changes in tenure conditions that are disadvantageous to the tenant, the logic is \nidentical. Thus when Haji Zahir (an outside landlord) announced that he wanted Nizam and his father to pay the rent in \nadvance (pajak) for two seasons on 8 relong, he told a tale of financial woe worthy of a poor man at the end of his luck. \nNizam and his father believe, with good reason, that Haji Zahir merely wants the lump sum to lend out to someone else \nin order to gain the use of the debtor's land. When Samat's landlord decided to collect rents before the season began \nrather than after the harvest, he used his penury as the excuse. The landlord, Samat commented, \"read (bacha) {his \nlines} as usual,\" implying that this was the routine performance that could be expected in the circumstances.\nThe same social logic can be seen in action whenever a landlord wishes to dismiss a tenant. This, of course, is a far \nmore threatening possibility than an increase in rents or a switch to leasehold (pajak) tenancy, as it often spells ruin for \nthe small cultivator. In terms of shared values, there is scarcely any way in which a rich landlord can rationalize taking \nthe means of subsistence from a poor tenant. The qualifier \"scarcely\" is used purposely here, because the landlord's \nposition is not ethically hopeless. One possibility for the landlord is to claim that he needs the land to provide for his son \nor son-in-law. Everyone recognizes and accepts that one's obligations to children should take precedence over any \nobligation to poorer but more distant relatives, let alone non-kin. A good many verbal tenancy contracts are, in fact, \nstruck in just these terms: a landlord agrees to rent out the land with the understanding that he will reclaim part or all of \nit when his children marry or begin to farm. Thus, when Haji Din took back 4 relong from Tok Ahmad and Shamsul in \n1975, he gave the only acceptable excuse. One of his sons, he said, had lost his tenancy and needed this to farm. \nKnowing his reputation, neither Tok Ahmad nor Shamsul took his explanation at face value and, since they had a rare \nwritten tenancy contract, they went to the District Office to lodge a complaint. The Assistant District Officer who deals \nwith land matters forced a compromise in which Haji Din took back only 4 of the 10 relong he wanted. The next season, \nthe ex-tenants' suspicions were confirmed as Haji Din's son never appeared, and the cultivation was done by a hired \nlaborer. The following season the land was sold to a wealthy Malay paddy trader.\n  \n< previous page\npage_210\nnext page >\n",

The landowner \nannounced that his son was going to be married at the end of the main season and would need the land that Taib rented \nin order to provide for his new family. As the landlord had at least 15 relong of paddy land, much of it closer to his own \nvillage, Taib thought he was lying. The usual protestations, in this case quite accurate, that the loss of the land would be \na disaster, got Taib nowhere. During the following season, his landlord's son actually did cultivate the land, occasionally \nhiring Taib to spread fertilizer and harrow. But sure enough, the second season after his dismissal, Taib discovered that \nthe land had been leased for ten season to a Chinese shopkeeper and tractor owner. He surmises that this is what his \nlandlord had in mind all along, but he was too embarrassed (malu) to reveal his deception immediately. Other landlords \nhave been less concerned with appearances; in any event, hardly a tenancy has been lost in Sedaka in which the \nlandlord's duty to his children has not been invoked.37\nIn a few cases, of course, the landlord's justification is not mere rhetoric. Some landlords have no other way of \nproviding for their children; some do fall on hard times and have little choice but to resume cultivation. Often, however, \nthe landlord's goal is further accumulation of land or other productive assets or else a new house or a sumptuous \nwedding feast. As the land is his and his right to dispose of it as he pleases is protected, with few qualifications, by the \nforce of law, he need not give any justification at all for his action. Nevertheless, he typically appeals to the only shared \nvalues that might possibly justify his behavior in the eyes of its victims by dramatizing his hardships or the needs of his \nchildren. His appeal, whether based on fact or not, serves to confirm and consolidate the existing symbolic order. The \nlandlord's performance, like that of Dickens's Mr. Wegg, places him securely \"with that very numerous class of \nimpostors, who are quite as determined to keep up appearances to themselves as to their neighbors.\"38 The tenant, for \nhis part, contributes to the same\n37. This is the case even when other reasonably legitimate grounds exist for dismissing a tenant. Razak's other \nbrother (not Hamzah), who lives outside the village, once rented land to Razak. Villagers claim, plausibly, \nthat Razak seldom actually paid the agreed rent for the land. Although the brother would have been justified, \nin terms of local values, if he had taken back the land for that reason alone, he also told Razak that he had to \ntake the land for his son. So strong is the obligation to provide sons or sons-in-law with land whenever \npossible that parents are criticized when they fail to do it, and not a few sons fail to pay rents regularly \nknowing that it will be difficult for parents, even if poor, to revoke their tenancy. Parents, for their part, rarely \ntransfer the land legally long before their death, since the question of inheritance is one of the few material \nsanctions they have to ensure that they are adequately provided for in their old age.\n38.

But not \nalways; this is not pure theater. Occasionally, the landlord appears, at least, to concede something. Perhaps he takes \nback only a portion of the land he originally insisted on; perhaps, as in Rosni's case, he accepts a higher rent while \ngiving way on the issue of advance payment; perhaps he settles on a rent slightly lower than his initial demand. I have, \nof course, no way of telling whether the original demand was a bluff intended to produce the final settlement, which \nmay now appear as a concession due to his generosity. Kamil claims, for example, that his landlord, Haji Azaudin, who \nhad wanted to sell the 5 relong Kamil rents from him, changed his plans when he (Kamil) could not raise the M$18,000 \nto purchase them. He chose instead to sell another rented parcel, where the tenant did have the cash for purchase. On \nthis basis, Kamil calls him a good (bagus) landlord. Tenants are generally quite cynical and thus not easily \nimpressionable, but there are a few landlords who consistently go easy (senang kira) on their tenantscharging lower than \nnormal rents, collecting after the harvest, and making allowances following a poor harvest. Such landlords, by their \nliberality, help keep the symbolic edifice I have described intact; they help to animate the amateur theatrics that even the \ntight-fisted landlord feels obliged to stage when he puts the screws to his tenant.\nIdeological \nConflict:  \nThe Village Gate\nIf the richer farmers of Sedaka operate under some disadvantages, those disadvantages are more a matter of ideology \nthan of action. There is, however, a small but significant exception to this pattern. It concerns virtually the only \ncollective and public recognition that the village has an obligation to protect the livelihood of its members. As a rare and \nformal impediment to capitalist relations of production, it is little wonder that it would have come under attack. The \nattack was, as it happens, beaten back for the time being. The victory for older values was a small one, but the struggle \nwas diagnostic for the issues we have been considering.\nWhat the stakes were is perhaps best expressed in the crude lettering that adorns a wooden, swinging gate that bars the \nentrance to the main village path: ''LORI PADI, LORI LAIN, DAN KUBOTA TIDAK BOLEHJKKK.\" Translated, it \nsays simply that \"Paddy trucks, other trucks, and tractors cannot [enter]\" and the warning is \"signed\" by the Village \nDevelopment Committee. The gate is a single timber about six feet high, which spans the path and is secured by a \nlocked chain. It does not impede the passage of pedestrians, bicycles, motorcycles, small \"walk-behind\" tractors, or \neven automobiles, but it does effectively bar entry to trucks or large tractors.

Many, \nbut not all, of the neighboring villages have similar gates, and this one has been here for at least the past fifteen years.39\nThe purpose of the gate is twofold. First, it is meant to restrict traffic along the dirt path, which during much of the year \nis muddy and slippery and therefore easily rutted. During the wettest months, a heavily loaded truck will be required to \nstop and unload its freightfor example, firewood, bricks, lumber, zinc roofing, furniturewhich will then be carried by \nfoot or cycle. At other times a fee of M$3 is collected for opening the gate and the truck is allowed to pass. The purpose \nof the fee was to create a small fund that was used annually to buy additional fill (tanah merah) to repair the damage \ndone to the path in the previous monsoon.40 A second and, for my concerns, critical purpose of the gate was to prevent \npaddy dealers' trucks from entering the village at all and thereby encroaching on the wages paid largely to villagers for \nhauling gunny sacks of paddy out to the main road. If the rice was to be sold or milled, as was usually the case, in \nnearby Kepala Batas, and if no large number of gunny sacks was involved, it made sense to pay villagers to haul it, a \nsack at a time, directly to the mill or buyer. The potential earnings for a villager were significant. It is not uncommon for \na young man to earn as much as M$150 during a normal harvest and now, with double-cropping, such earnings were \ndoubled.\nThe gate, then, was a collectively enforced example of tolong, a protected monopoly of work reserved for villagers \nalone.41 When it was first established, it was of particular advantage to poor villagers, since the gunny sacks were \ntransported\n39. No one seems to remember exactly when it was erected, but most agree that it was the gradual \nimprovement of the road near the village and the attendant growth of lorry traffic that explain its construction. \nThus it is not as if villagers decided to protect this opportunity for wage work only in early 1960; it is rather \nthat no real threat to bicycle hauling had existed until that time. Villagers also agree that their initial concern \nwas that farmers who cultivated land near the village but did not live there would be the first to avail \nthemselves of trucks to haul paddy.\n40.Tanah merah, literally \"red earth,\" is not available in the immediate vicinity. Local soils of marine clay, while \nthey harden to the consistency of concrete during the dry season, are not suitable for roads because they become \nextremely viscous and slippery when wet. It is common to use tanah merah not only for roads and heavily \ntrafficked paths but also to build up the elevation of the compound around and under the house.\n41. There is some evidence that similar customs are observed outside Kedah as well. Fujimoto, for example, \nreports that in the Province Wellesley village of Guar Tok Said, \"There was an agreement among the villagers that \na rice dealer's lorry should be parked outside the village, at the time of the sale of padi, so that sacks of rice must \nbe carried to the lorry, thus providing jobs especially to young boys in the village. . . . The road was narrow and it \nwas difficult for a lorry to enter the village, but it was certainly possible.\" \"Land Tenure,\" 196.\n  \n< previous page\npage_213\nnext page >\n",

Now that motorcycles are more common, the principal beneficiaries \nhave changed too, as we shall see. The gate itself was a fitting symbol for what it represented. It said that, in this small \nrespect at least, Sedaka was a closed economy, that the hauling (tanggung, tarik) of paddy was open only to villagers, \nthat the local monopoly on such work would not be lifted to accommodate the commercial paddy buyers and millers \n(mostly Chinese) who might provide the service more cheaply. Economically, of course, the gate represented a subsidy \nthe larger farmers in the village paid to those of their neighbors who hauled paddy. The amount of the subsidy varied \nwith the distance of the farmer's rice fields from the gate and with the size of his harvest. He would, with or without the \ngate, have to pay hauling fees (per gunny sack) from the field to the main village path. But once the bagged paddy had \nreached the village path, he had to pay the haulers for each sack they took to the head of the village track where the \npaddy could then be loaded onto a truck, if he wished, or to pay the village haulers themselves to continue on into town. \nIf there had been no gateif the paddy dealer's truck could come directly to that point on the village path closest to his \npaddy fielda farmer might save as much as M$2 a gunny sack. For a large farmer, of say 8 relong, the savings for two \nseasons might be as much as M$500. Farmers of 2 relong or less were little affected, since they were likely to keep most \nof their paddy at home and, when they did sell or mill some paddy, they could transport it themselves, a sack at a time.\nIn late March 1980, toward the end of a late harvest season, the gate was opened briefly to admit two paddy dealers' \ntrucks, thus stirring up a bitter controversy, the effects of which still reverberate in Sedaka. It was opened initially by \nFadzil, a middle-aged farmer who owns 8.5 relong and has for some time been a member of the UMNO committee \n(JKK) that runs village affairs. Fadzil is not much liked, even by his factional allies; he is reputed to be one of the two \nor three most careless cultivators, with consistently low yields, and spoiled (sayang manja) from an early age as the \nfavorite adopted son of the late Tok Halim. Despite his air of superiority (sombong), his literacy and skills as a public \nspeaker are valued by Bashir and others on the JKK. His position on the JKK is notable here because, as everyone in \nSedaka knows, he spoke and voted for keeping the ban on paddy trucks a few years back when the issue was raised.\nFadzil's story is that, after his harvest was bagged and lying in the fields, he approached Lebai Pendek's son, Musa, who \nis a member of a small group that hauls paddy. Musa told him that the price per gunny sack would be M$1.80. Fadzil \nwas furious, not only because he thought the rate was far too high but also because the rate is often left to the discretion \nof the farmer. But he did not negotiate further, simply saying that M$1.80 seemed too much. His reasoning was that the \nexistence of the gate had allowed these young men to \"extort\" (tekan) from the farmers. The previous year, he noted, the \nfee was only M$1.20 and there was no justification for it to jump to M$1.80. The price of consumer\n  \n< previous page\npage_214\nnext page >\n",

He added that the road \nitself had been improved recently by the addition of fill, making the transport by motorcycle much easier, especially \nnow, late in the dry season (musim kemarau), when it was not slippery. Since it was the tail end of the harvest and there \nwas not much paddy left to be hauled, the piece-rate should have declined.\nHad the paddy been hauled that afternoon, the matter might have ended with no more than Fadzil's grumbling. But the \nhaulers did not show up. Fadzil went again to see Musa, who promised that the paddy would be hauled early the next \nday. By noon the following day Fadzil's fifty sacks of paddy were still stacked in the middle of the field, and Musa sent \nword that it would be hauled that afternoon. By 3 P.M. nothing had happened; Fadzil was, he said, concerned that sacks \nmight be stolen that night, and he was also scanning the horizon for the storm clouds that might soak his paddy. He \nbriefly considered approaching another group of paddy haulers but thought better of it. Musa and his friends were all \nfrom UMNO families, politically aligned with Fadzil and the JKK, while the other group (puak lain) were from the PAS \nfaction of the village. To have PAS men haul the paddy of an UMNO stalwart such as Fadzil would have been a serious \nbreach of factional loyalties.\nAt this point, Fadzil apparently decided to attack the issue of the gate head on. He claims that he went to talk with \nBashir, who while not the village headman is acknowledged as UMNO leader, to explain the situation and ask that the \ngate be opened. Here the stories diverge somewhat. Bashir denies that he was ever approached about opening the gate, \nwhile Fadzil claims that Bashir told him to open it. At any rate, Fadzil then went to Kepala Batas to contact his Chinese \npaddy dealer, who sent a truck to the village, led by Fadzil on his motorcycle. Reaching the gate, Fadzil dismounted and \ngot the key from Lebai Pendek's wife, claiming that he had Bashir's permission to open it. By 5 P.M. the Chinese driver \nand his two Malay laborers had loaded Fadzil's crop aboard the truck and had left to deliver it to the dealer in town.\nMeanwhile, word spread quickly, and many angry men were soon assembled in Bashir's village shop, a gathering place \nfor the UMNO faction in Sedaka. Their tone was unmistakable. A few had already torn down the gate itself, as if to \nmagnify Fadzil's crime. What he had done, they said, was \"wrong\" and \"dishonest\" (karut). He had done it, moreover, \n''as if he were in charge,\" as if \"he wanted to take over\" (dia mau jadi kuasa). Others spoke of violence. \"He should be \nshot\" (kena peluru), \"He should be shot straight away\" (kena tembak terus). The members of the UMNO paddy-hauling \ngroup (golongan moto-tarik) were, not surprisingly, the most inflammatory, but the anger was general.\n42. The reasoning here is significant, as it manifests a belief that the piece-rate should be tied to the cost of \nlivingto needand that any increase in the cultivator's profits, as reflected in the farm-gate price, should be \nshared with laborers.\n  \n< previous page\npage_215\nnext page >\n",

As they gathered at \"their own store,\" Samat's, only two \ndoors down from Bashir's, they shared with great glee the unseemly spectacle of an open battle among members of the \nUMNO ruling group. Some realized that, once one person had disregarded the gate, others could too (mula se-orang, \nhabis) and that, if the rule was to be broken, it was important that members of the PAS faction establish their right to \nbring in paddy trucks too. Accordingly, Nizam bin Haji Lah, whose antipathy for Bashir was legendary (he neither \nspoke to Bashir nor traded at his store) and who still had bagged paddy in his field, left to call in a truck to fetch his own \nrice. Within a half hour after Fadzil's truck had left, Nizam's truck had entered and parked in front of Samat's store. The \nChinese driver, to judge from the fear written on his face, would rather have been anywhere else; he would not get down \nfrom the cab. Before loading could begin, Bashir himself came to talk to the driver. And while he did not directly order \nthe driver to leave, he made it clear that it would be better if the driver allowed the village to settle this matter before \nany more paddy trucks were loaded. Seizing this golden opportunity, the driver sped away empty, not even pausing to \nexplain his hasty retreat to Nizam.\nBasir had good reason to try to defuse a potentially violent conflict. He certainly was aware of what had happened in \nnearby villages when large farmers tried to circumvent the fees for transporting paddy to the main road. In Dulang \nKechil a farmer had tried to use his own tractor to haul his harvest to the road in order to save the local piece-rate \ncharges. The young men whose wages were at stake stopped his tractor, removed the battery, and threatened to slash his \ntires unless he abandoned the attempt. Under the circumstances, he relented. In Mengkuang a few years before a \nChinese landowner brought trucks right into his large field during the dry season to haul rice directly to the mill. Alerted \nto the threat, a large number of villagers managed to fell two large coconut trees across the road, after the first loaded \ntruck had left, to prevent the others from leaving. The other trucks were finally unloaded and the sacks of paddy taken \none by one to the main road after a large crowd shouting threats of violence persuaded the landowner that discretion \nwas the better part of valor. With this in mind, Bashir undoubtedly realized that the situation might easily take a violent \nturn, one that was as likely to involve fighting among UMNO members as between UMNO and PAS members.\nBashir's dilemma was a difficult one. There were other large farmers, including himself, who would have been only too \npleased to see the gate demolished. Other villages had already done it. But he faced determined opposition from his own \nimmediate political following, many of whom were his relatives. Amin, his cousin, Daud and Khalid, the two sons of \nheadman Haji Jaafar, Musa and Sahil, the sons of Lebai Pendek, as well as Taha, the son of Lebai Hussein, were the \nvery core of Bashir's \"kitchen-cabinet\" and, at the same time, the core of the UMNO paddy-hauling group. All of them \nrepresented influential families whose support he needed.\n  \n< previous page\npage_216\nnext page >\n",

The group was perhaps designed especially to isolate Fadzil. Bashir's position was that \nMusa had demanded too much for hauling the paddy but that Fadzil ought to have negotiated a lower piece-rate rather \nthan taken matters into his own hands by opening the gate: \"Such an important issue cannot be decided by one person.\" \nFadzil, realizing that the group would go against him, tried to justify his action but stopped short of explicitly \nimplicating Bashir in the opening of the gate. He added, significantly, that he knew that others thought that he had not \nbeen considerate (tak timbang rasa) nor compassionate (tak bersimpati) but that he believed that \"we are free (kita \nbebas) [to open the gate].\" \"Other villages have taken down their gates and we will be forced (terpaksa) to do the same.'' \nThis is the closest he came to asserting boldly the priority of his economic freedom of action over the village's right to \nprotect its diminishing sources of wage income. Lebai Pendek and the three members of the UMNO hauling group all \nargued that the work should be given to villagers, not outsiders, and that the trucks would damage the road. Bashir \nfinally spoke for closing the gate but was concerned that, if they called a general meeting on the issue, richer UMNO \npeasants who typically attend such gatherings might actually vote to let the paddy trucks in.\nThe following afternoon a small meeting was held in the room beneath the surau that doubles as a village hall (dewan) \nand classroom. Attending were about fifteen villagers, all from UMNO families, and two outsiders: Akil, a clerk at the \ngovernment rice mill (LPN) and an official of both the Farmers' Association and the District UMNO executive, and \nGaafar, the retired subdistrict official (penghulu) from Dulang. The meeting was conducted by Akil, not Bashir, in what \nappeared to be an attempt to portray the decisions shortly to be announced as those of higher officials. Lest the official \ncharacter of the occasion be misunderstood, Akil flashed a typed report for all to note.43 He began by referring to the \nevents of the day before without mentioning names and then gave Fadzil a chance to speak. Knowing what was \nrequired, Fadzil made a roundabout apology for his hasty action but also pointed out that many villagers were angry \nbecause those who hauled paddy and thus benefited from the gate had, \"in return [for the favor], gouged us (makan kita \nbalek)\"so much so, he added, that he was almost driven to hire the other group of haulers (cari puak lain). Akil then \nproceeded to read his report, which consisted entirely of the reasons for maintaining the gate. First, the road would be \nbadly damaged, especially during the wet season, if paddy trucks were admitted. Second, the men in the village \"who \ndepend on hauling wages would lose them\" and third, the farmers\n43. This report, Basir later confided, had been worked out that morning between himself, Daud bin Haji \nJaafar, and Akil.\n  \n< previous page\npage_217\nnext page >\n",

No vote was taken; the matter was closed and two days later a new \ngate was in place. Fadzil was conspicuously absent from the small work party that erected it.45\nAs word got around about the decision, it became clear that members of the opposition (PAS) faction had not been \ncalled (panggil) to the meeting. They were livid, objecting not so much to the outcome as to the manner in which the \nruling faction had conducted this affair. Everyone should have been called to the meeting, they said, and everyone \nshould be treated equally (sama-rata). Here they took full advantage of the conceptual equality of all villagers to make \ntheir point. Instead, the meeting was confidential (sulit) and the matter was decided by a small group that \"chooses \nitself\" (depa angkat sindiri) and that, in any case, is composed mostly of relatives. All this talk, which took place out of \nearshot of UMNO members, was phrased very much in \"we-they\" (kita-depa) terms.46 Bashir in particular came in for \nridicule for his lack of education, his arrogance (sombong), and his inability to prevent such quarrels within his own \nfaction. Sukur, a strong PAS man, pointed out that the high-handed manner in which Bashir and his friends ran things \nwas the reason why only a few UMNO members showed up to repair and grade the road when the government \ndelivered new fill. In the old days, when PAS and UMNO members were both in the JKK, he said, everyone would \nhelp. Even the truck fees, he and the others agreed, now disappeared (\"who knows where\") and no receipt was ever \ngiven.\nThe preservation of the village gate was certainly a modest victory for the closed economyfor the principle that the \nvillage's first obligation is to protect its own sources of wages and income. The winners were the villagers who hauled \npaddy to the main road and the losers were both the large farmers who could save substantially by loading directly onto \nthe trucks and the truck owners\n44.Orang yang bergantung kepada upah tarik padi sudah hilang. Lari ka-bangsa asing.\n45. A few adjustments in the gate's operation were discussed. Lebai Pendek would continue to hold the key and \nwould get 20 percent of the fees from the trucks permitted to enter. Shamsul and Tok Ahmad, whose fields were \nimmediately inside the gate, would be exempted from the rule.\n46. Factional feeling was at a high pitch during this period, not only because of the gate issue but because of the \nhighly partisan distribution of benefits from the Village Improvement Scheme (Ranchangan Pemulihan Kampung, \nRPK), which had just concluded. The RPK episode is described and analyzed below.\n  \n< previous page\npage_218\nnext page >\n",

The smallness of the impediment, however, merits emphasis. \nChanges in tenancy and the mechanization of the harvest have already swept away far more opportunities for work and \nincome than this quaint, isolated vestige of older values could ever hope to replace. Even this small victory was a \nqualified one. The palpable threat posed by the opening of the gate once, and the possibility that it might later be opened \nfor good, had their intended, chilling effect. Piece-rates for paddy hauling within the village the following season were \nno higher and in many cases lower than they had been earlier. Gaafar's homely lecture about the evils of selfishness was \ndirected as much at the men who hauled paddy as at Fadzil. If they did not heed his warning, they ran the risk of killing \nthe goose that laid the golden eggs.\nIt would be a grave misreading of this minor victory for local rights to interpret it as in any sense a victory for Sedaka's \npoor. The fact is that even this petty aspect of rice farming has been thoroughly mechanized over the past decade. With \nfew exceptions, all the paddy now hauled along the village path is taken by motorcycles, not bicycles. And the \nownership of motorcycles (mostly Honda 70s) is, as one might expect, highly correlated with income. The pertinent \nstatistics are that nineteen of the richest twenty-five households own a motorcycle, while only two of the poorest twenty-\nfive households own one. Even the figure of two motorcycles for the poorest families is something of an exaggeration. \nThey are so frequently repossessed for failure to pay the installment loan or not operating because the owner cannot \nafford spare sparts that their existence is an episodic affair. Nearly half the middle peasants own a motorcycle. Thus, the \nbeneficiaries of the gate are to be found exclusively among the middle and, especially, the rich households. This helps \nto explain why the gate was reestablished. Its constituency has shifted over the past few years from the poor and middle \npeasants, who all had bicycles, to the privileged, whose profits have allowed them to make a down payment on a \nmotorcycle. Although there is no way of knowing, it is unlikely that the gate would exist today if paddy were still \nhauled by bicycle. Ironically, the gate that once protected the earnings of the poor has been successfully defended \nprecisely because it now largely benefits those who have gained most from the green revolution. The poor, in fact, \nhardly\n47. A single well-to-do family can contain both winners and losers. Thus Lebai Pendek is a large farmer but \nalso has two sons who earn money hauling paddy with their motorcycles. Fadzil's position is more \ncomprehensible when one realizes that he is a large farmer without any children who haul paddy. Middle \npeasant households stand to gain less from the reduction in transport costs simply because they market less \npaddy, but they may still oppose the gate, especially if they have no one in the family who can haul paddy.\n  \n< previous page\npage_219\nnext page >\n",

It \nwas a topic of daily conversation for months; it greatly exacerbated the political divisions in the village; it came near to \nprovoking violence on several occasions; and its social repercussions are still being felt. Unlike the gate episode, which \nit preceded by five months, the RPK was manifestly a partisan political issue. But, like the question of the gate, it \nerupted into an ideological struggle in which many of the same principles were at stake. As it developed, the actual \nallocation of assistance violated both of the principles which, we have shown, animate much of the moral discourse in \nSedaka: the conceptual equality of all villagers and the obligation of the well-to-do toward their poorer neighbors. The \nruling elite in the village achieved its immediate purpose but found itself hard put to justify its actions to its own faction, \nlet alone the rest of the village. Inasmuch as the village poor are heavily overrepresented in PAS, the issue of \npartisanship took on distinctly class overtones.\nExamining this episode in some detail, it will become apparent that there is an interesting parallel here with changes in \nthe relations of production. In that domain, the large farmers and landlords have been able more or less to have their \nown way. Justifying what they have imposed, however, has required them to distort the facts, to plead necessity, to \nengage in bad-faith performances of little credibility. In parceling out the benefits of the Village Improvement Scheme, \nas well, the leading village families have been able to do as they pleased. Here again, however, they have been driven to \na series of distortions, feigned necessities, and rather lame face-saving gestures. The problem, of course, is that the \nshared values of the local society provide no justification either for the single-minded pursuit of profit at the expense of \none's neighbors or for the crude denial of benefits to an entire category of villagers. Not that profit making and political \nfavoritism are new experiences in Sedaka. It is rather that the new opportunities for each are unprecedented and that \nthese opportunities have vastly outstripped the available means for defending and legitimating their pursuit.\nThe Village Improvement Scheme (hereafter RPK) was the brainchild, credible rumor has it, of Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, \nthe current prime minister, when he\n48. Strictly speaking, the poor continue to haul paddy, particularly after the off-season when the fields are \nwet, from the field itself to a path that will accommodate a motorcycle. This hauling is necessary, however, \nregardless of whether the gate exists or not.\n  \n< previous page\npage_220\nnext page >\n",

It was conceived as an instrument of political patronage in which a number of villages \nwould be selected on the basis of need and political loyalty to receive a lump sum that would then be devoted to \nvaguely specified \"development\" purposes.49 By October 1979, the scheme was under way throughout Kedah. A dozen \nlucky villages were designated in and around the Yan area after what must have been protracted negotiations between \nUMNO officials and the District Office.50 They were all allegedly \"backward villages\" (kampung mundur). But \n\"backwardness\" was not enough; a village had also to be an UMNO stronghold.\nSedaka, having fulfilled both criteria, received M$35,000. The JKK as a whole was never assembled to discuss how the \nallocation was to be distributed. Instead, Haji Salim, a district UMNO official and large landowner living just outside \nthe village, together with Bashir, Fadzil, Amin, and Daud bin Haji Jaafar met with the subdistrict chief, Abdul Majid, to \nmake plans. As in other villages, the lump sum was allocated to different uses: M$15,000 for truckloads of fill to \nimprove the road and for outdoor toilet materials; M$20,000 for materials to improve dwellings, including lumber, zinc \nroofing, paint, and concrete pilings. The households slated to receive assistance would, as the administrative regulations \nprovided, be selected on the basis of a house-by-house survey which, in this case, would be conducted by Taha, a clerk \nat the District Office and the son of a local UMNO stalwart, Lebai Hussein. Amidst a general air of anticipation (and \nforeboding as well), the survey was in fact conducted. The questions, as noted in the previous chapter, were exclusively \nrelated to need: income, landownership, farming acreage, present housing materials, sanitary facilities, number of \nchildren, farm animals, and small livestock. Taha explained that assistance would be given not in cash but in the form of \nslips of authorization that would entitle villagers to materials, up to a certain sum, at any one of three nearby suppliers \nof building materials. A corner of the village hall (dewan) was partitioned off to create a small office with table and \nchairs and a sign reading: \"Operations Room for Village Improvement Assistance, Kampung Sedaka.\"\nIt was quickly apparent that the worst suspicions of PAS members in the village had been fully realized. The survey had \nbeen a deception. This was not a program to \"improve\" the lot of poor villagers but rather a program to improve the lot \nexclusively of UMNO villagers. Even poverty, it turned out, was not\n49.

There was a modest degree of equity among UMNO households. UMNO \nhouseholds that were poor according to the official tally got an average grant of M$672; UMNO households with \nmiddle incomes received an average of M$486; and the richest UMNO households' average was M$388. The averages \nhide a great deal of variation within each category, which seems to be related to how closely and actively the household \nin question was tied to the UMNO leadership. Since so many (sixteen of twenty-five) of the poorest villagers are from \nopposition families, this partisan allocation of the loot could hardly be redistributive. Thus, 71 percent of rich and \nmiddle peasant families were in the charmed circle, while only 36 percent of the poorest households got anything at all. \nIn the midst of these inequities, the members of the JKK did not forget themselves. Although three-quarters of the JKK \nmembers are from the wealthiest twenty-five families, they nevertheless managed, officially, to award themselves an \naverage of M$579. Unofficially, as well shall see, they may have done even better.\nEven the apparent anomalies in the pattern of assistance reveal a finely tuned partisanship. Only two opposition \nhouseholds got any assistance, and they were, not by coincidence, Hamzah (M$1,000) and Rokiah (M$200), the only \ntwo PAS households who had hedged their bets by also paying dues to UMNO. Rokiah had the further advantage of \nbeing a good friend of Taha, who had done the survey. Hamzah had the further advantage of being the caretaker of the \ndewan and prayer house and of working often for UMNO landowners. Two of the three village fence-sitters, Kamil and \nDzulkifli bin Haji Wahab, received help,51 while the latter's much poorer brother, Bakri bin Haji Wahab, who had \nremained in PAS, got nothing.\nWithin a matter of days, the air was thick with charges and countercharges, which were by no means confined to those \nwho had been excluded altogether. Nearly all of them were directed at the JKK and Bashir in particular. They were \naccused of misappropriation, bribe taking, corruption, kickbacks, diversion of funds, favoritism, and dishonestyall \nactivities for which the Malay language has amply provided.52 The charges alone might fill a book, but a few examples \nwill convey the flavor. Bashir and the JKK were widely accused of having made a deal with the Chinese lumber yards \nto receive kickbacks in return for allowing\n51. The third fence-sitter, Mustapha, is Kamil's son-in-law; since he was staying with his wife in his father-in-\nlaw's house while preparing to move his wife and young child to his parent's village, he was seen as ineligible \non those two counts. If that were not enough, he is also known to sympathize strongly with PAS.\n52.

That's why, said Mat \"halus,\" much of the lumber came in \nshort lengths, split, and had the consistency of cork (gabus). Members of the JKK were believed to have gotten more \nthan their \"official\" allotment. Thus Bashir, who claimed to have gotten only a toilet, was said to have gotten a large \nsupply of lumber which, for appearance's sake, he had stored under Fadzil's house. Shamsul, who officially got only M\n$200, was rumored to have gotten at least M$800 in materials and paint. Many poor UMNO members made invidious \ncomparisons between what they had received and what wealthier UMNO leaders had received. Karim says he was \nentitled to M$600-worth of materials and got only M$400, while Fadzil, far richer, got M$750. Rokiah, ignoring the \nfact that she is a fair-weather UMNO member, complained about her small allocation, which was no more than that of \nher wealthier neighbor, Ghazali. Mansur protested to Bashir that he, a poor man with no land, had gotten less than \nothers who owned as much as 8 relong. In each case, the complaints were based on relative need, in keeping with the \nlogic of local charity.\nNot even the three hundred truckloads of fill brought in to raise and widen the village road were free of acrimony. Some \nof the fill was sold cheaply to individuals to spread around their house lots. Bashir claims that this was done as a means \nof rewarding those who had come to help spread and grade it. No, claim others; those who worked on the road, all \nUMNO members, had gotten two or three hundred dollars as wages. The new fill, it turned out, never quite reached the \nfar end of the village. Some eighty yards short of that, just before Tok Radzi's house, a few loads of fill were simply \ndumped and left. Bashir explained that there was simply not enough in the budget to complete the work and that those \nwho lived at the far end would have to spread what was left themselves. The PAS faction has a simpler explanation. It \njust so happens that five of the mere seven families who live beyond the dumped fill are strong PAS membersthe \nstrongest geographical concentration of opposition families in the village. Since the fill had been spread largely by \nbulldozer for the rest of the village, and since it was not nearly enough for the job, these families refused to come spread \nit themselves. To do so would have been humiliating (malu), they said. In a few days much of it was gonespread in \nLebai Hussein's compound, which now looks, they say, \"like the garden of a Sultan.\"\nThe ideological contours of the struggle over the Village Improvement Scheme are best appreciated if we begin with the \nrealization that the party split between PAS and UMNO has never been entirely legitimate. It is not that the notion of \naligning with PAS or UMNO violates any sense of village decorum. In fact, as is abundantly clear, virtually every \nhousehold in Sedaka has long since chosen sides politically. What does exist, however, is a widely shared feeling that \npolitics should be kept in its place, that partisan strife should not be allowed to disrupt the ritual unity and neighborly \nrelations that villages believe should prevail in the community.

The late 1960s and early 1970s were seen as the worst period \nof factionalism, when neighbors occasionally refused to speak with one another and close relatives found themselves on \nopposite sides of the fence. For my purposes, what is instructive is that these days were always spoken of with a tone of \nembarrassment and shame. Villagers blamed themselves for having been taken in by the candidates and their \nentourages, who were in turn blamed for having promoted a fiercely partisan spirit. The entire period and the incidents \nthat marred it were seen as something of a disgrace and compared to the state of affairs in village households where \nparents and children or spouses are constantly bickering, shouting, and fighting. The relative improvement that villagers \ntypically note was no doubt due in some measure to the entry of PAS into the government coalition in 1974. The local \npartisan alignment of households was little changed, for it had roots in familial alliances that existed well before \nindependence, but its public manifestation was definitely muted. When PAS later bolted the government coalition, \nshortly before my arrival in the village in 1978, local party strife did not immediately resume its former vigor.53\nWhat the villagers found most unseemly about the earlier excesses of partisanship was their affront to traditional ritual \ndecencies. Thus Tok Kasim, himself a strong PAS member, illustrates how severe (teruk) things had become in those \ndays by telling about a marriage kenduri in Sedaka in which the next-door neighbors, because they belonged to the other \nparty, were either not invited or chose not to come. As the kenduri began, he emphasized, guests were arriving and food \nwas being cooked directly below the window of the neighbors. The sense of embarrassment was finally so great that the \nneighbors simply left the village for the day and returned only after the kenduri was over. It was the fact that \"neighbors \nin the same village\" should quarrel that so offended him. \"If the village society is ruined,\" he concluded, \"there will be \nno peace.\"54\nTok Kasim's story, in one variation or another, together with the values it embodies, is a constant refrain. Everyone has \nstories to tell about Sedaka or neighboring villages \"when the quarreling was at its worst\" (masa teruk berbalah) and, \nwithout exception, they involve ritual feasts in which neighbors or relatives\n53. For many local PAS members, the decision of Datuk Asri and the other leaders of PAS to enter the ruling \ncoalition was an act of betrayal. Their sense of having been sold out was so strong that when he later returned \nto opposition they were skeptical. It did not change their membership in PAS, which was firmly rooted in \nlocal realities, but did shake their confidence. As many put it, \"He took government wages\" (Sudah makan \ngaji kerajaan).\n54.Kalau masyarakat kampung rosak, tak jadi aman.\n  \n< previous page\npage_224\nnext page >\n",

As Rokiah laments, it went so far that neighbors might not even come when there \nwas a death, that even relatives would boycott (boikot) a kenduri.55 Explicitly or implicitly the refrain distinguishes \nbetween the values of community (masyarakat) and party (parti), with the former invariably accorded priority. Lebai \nPendek, an UMNO leader, thus thinks that \"the villagers have become a bit smarter.\" \"They know {now} that the \ncommunity is different; before, they mixed up community with politics.\"56 When Mansur, a landless member of \nUMNO, explains why he goes to all kenduris, regardless of which party the host belongs to, he says simply, \"I only take \nthe community into account.\"57 In fact, it is difficult in Sedaka even to raise with anyone the question of party \naffiliation without provoking a disclaimer that, when it comes to marriages, sickness, funerals, or even helping to move \na house (usung rumah), \"party makes no difference at all.'' Even those whose political passions have occasionally led \nthem to break this rule pay it constant lip service, thereby reinforcing its status as an ideal.\nIn this context it becomes easier to understand the basis of the principal objections raised against the allocation of RPK \nassistance. The loudest cries came, naturally, from PAS members, but many of the UMNO faithful objected too, and not \njust those who felt individually shortchanged. There were essentially three ways in which the money might have been \ndivided. First, it might have been given preferentially to the poor of the village, thus satisfying the norm that help should \nbe extended to those most in need, regardless of party loyalty. Originating in the older agrarian order and applying to \nboth individual and communal obligations, this principle might plausibly be extended to government assistance as well. \nA second possibility might have been to divide the money among all villagers, disregarding both their need and their \npolitics. This would have satisfied the norm that all villagers are, at some level, conceptually equal. The third \npossibility, and the one adopted, was to distribute the aid along strictly partisan lines. This surely was the most \nsatisfactory option for the local UMNO leadership, but it was at the same time the least defensible in moral terms. For \nhowever firmly rooted partisan loyalties may have become in practice within Sedaka, they carry little moral weight and \ncertainly not enough to begin to legitimate the JKK's actions. As in the case of double-cropping, so also in the realm of \npolitics. The new opportunities for \"profit-making\" activity have far outpaced the normative means available to justify \ntaking full advantage of them.\n55. As one might expect, the worst case of partisanship that villagers can imagine is when kin of different \nparties refuse to come to one another's funerals. It is as if the solidarity surrounding funeral rites is the \nultimate repository of both village and religious values; once this is breached something irretrievable has been \nlost.

Here were \nsome of the wealthiest men in the villageLebai Pendek, Shamsul, and Aminserving themselves while most of the \npoorest villagers got nothing. Pak Yah (Yah Botol) was mentioned most often as the outstanding example of a \ndemonstrably poor man who ought to have been helped. Was his house not in disrepair (buruk) for lack of funds? This \nwas, after all, a program designed to help people fix up their houses! Pak Yah was also a strategic example because of \nhis reputation as an honest, hard-working laborer and, moreover, one who frequently worked for UMNO leader Bashir. \nIf anyone deserved help, he did. On the basis of this case alone, many villagers said the allocation was \"not fair\" (tak \nadil), \"not proper\" (tak patut), \"not right\" (tak betul). Quite a few UMNO members who benefited nevertheless declared \nthat the poor should have been helped first. Kamil, for example, said that ''{only} when the strata (lapisan) of the worst-\noff was helped, should those who were less badly off be taken.\" Mansur, who as a poor UMNO member got M$750 in \nmaterials, agrees: \"We should help the condition of the poor no matter what party; first come the poor, those who have \nless than 2 relong.\"\nMuch as UMNO members were pleased with their good fortune, they felt an acute embarrassment before their PAS \nneighbors, with whom they had maintained cordial relations. As the new lumber was delivered and work began, they \nfelt the envy and resentment of adjacent families, a resentment that was often reinforced by stony silences along the \nvillage path. Many felt the need to apologize for their stroke of luck to their PAS friends by agreeing that the JKK had \nbeen unfair but saying that they could not do anything about it. A few salved their consciences and repaired their \nfriendships by selling some of their wood cheaply to PAS neighbors. Others actually hired a poorer PAS friend to help \nwith the repair or construction.58 There were, in other words, sporadic private efforts partly to undo the JKK's actions \nby redistributing the benefits to needy PAS families.\nDenunciations of the RPK for its failure to help the poorest villagers were all the more appropriate because the survey \nthat preceded the distribution had been conducted ostensibly to establish which families were most in need of aid. It was \nthe contrast between the appearance of an impartial survey and its flagrant violation in practice that allowed PAS \nmembersbut not only themto claim plausibly that the JKK had defied the wishes of the government. Much of the village \nbelieved that the government intended the money to go to the poor, regardless of party, and stories abounded about \nvillages where the grants were given first to the neediest. Yaakub, for example, claimed that in Merbuk and Jenun, \nwhere he had relatives, all the poorest families had gotten the largest grants. Mansur said that, in nearby Sungai Kering, \nnearly everyone had received\n58. Negotiations about such matters were delicate, since most PAS members were too proud to accept such \nsecondhand assistance.\n  \n< previous page\npage_226\nnext page >\n",

When the UMNO \nJKK there saw what was happening, they trooped en masse to the local Kedah member of Parliament and had the \nofficial transferred. Wood already stacked by the houses of PAS members was removed, they said, amid fistfights, and \nreal-located to UMNO families. The pretense of a survey had been such a gratuitous insult that one of the poorest PAS \nmembers, Mat \"halus,\" went to see Subdistrict Chief Abdul Majid to tell him that, if Taha ever returned to do another \nsurvey, he would \"hit him and kill him\" (saya tumbuk mampus).\nIn a more realistic mood, many PAS villagers realized that a distribution of funds by need alone, though in accord with \nlocal values, might have been utopian under the circumstances. Surely all UMNO members would have insisted on \ngetting a share of the spoils. Why not then, they argued, give everyone an equal amount? The angry Mat \"halus\" said, \n\"Even if they gave it out equally, that's all right. If each person got $300, all right. But we got nothing.\" The principle of \nequal shares to all was echoed by many others, especially those rank-and-file UMNO members who were offended by \npurely partisan criteria. Jamil, a fairly well-off UMNO member, also thought that equal awards would have been best: \n\"In terms of village society (kira masyarakat), it would have to be done equally (kena buat sama-rata).\" Abu Hassan, \nalthough nominally a member of the JKK, believed that \"equal shares are fair.''60 PAS members were quick to point out \nthat the government used one standard for collecting taxes and, in this case, another standard for distributing assistance. \nThis contradiction was best captured by Ishak, when he said, \"When they take the land tax and the irrigation tax, they \ndon't go by party, but when they give out lumber and toilets, then they go by party.\" Here too, there were stories \ncirculating about other villages, other JKKs, which had given something to everyone in the village.\nThe argument for treating all equally was reinforced by rumors about disagreements among the UMNO group that had \nmet at Haji Salim's house to decide how the RPK money should be used. Lebai Sabrani, the greatly respected religious \nteacher from Sungai Tongkang and Tok Mudin, who is in charge of circumcision ceremonies, had apparently argued for \ngiving something to everyone or at least including very poor PAS members like Pak Yah. Later, when I spoke with \nLebai Sabrani alone, he said it was true. He had suggested dividing it all equally but, he said, Haji Salim and Bashir had \nobjected by pointing out that, if all the PAS members got something, they would say, \"See, we are in the\n59. In the five or six villages about which I was able to gather reliable information, it appears that the \ndistribution was also largely along partisan lines. Mansur's comment is nonetheless true, for Sungai Kering is \nknown to be something like 90 percent in the UMNO camp.\n60.Cara rata lagi patut.\n  \n< previous page\npage_227\nnext page >\n",

Lebai Sabrani \nis reluctant to broadcast his dissent, but knowledge of it contributed a good deal to the indignation of PAS members. \nThey could now point to the views of the most respected religious figure in UMNO itself as confirmation that they had \nbeen treated unfairly. Haji Salim and Bashir then became the principal villains of the piece. PAS members reported that \nHaji Salim had openly said in the market coffee shop that \"PAS people won't get even one house pillar\" and that Bashir \nhad shown Taha a secret (sulit) list of PAS families who were on no account to be given anything.\nThe talk was angry and even violent. Dullah said, \"They're making war {on us}; we're going to make war back.\" But \nwith the exception of Mat \"halus\"'s threatening remark about Taha, most of it was safely confined to small groups of \nfriends and allies. They made their anger known by snubbing members of the JKK in the coffee shops and along the \nvillage path. Open confrontations were avoided, and the JKK learned indirectly, through the \"grapevine\" (cara \nsembunyi tau), most of what they knew about the charges made against them. The absence of direct challenges had its \norigins in both pride and fear. Rosni is a striking example of the former. When I asked her if she had complained \n(merungut) to Bashir or Amin, for whom her transplanting group often works, she explained that she would be \nembarrassed (malu) to ask.61 They both had told her, she added, that she should join UMNO, so she would be included. \nShe did not. Besides, she had fixed up her own house by herself without their wood. \"If they gave me the assistance, I \nwould take it, but I won't beg (minta) or make trouble (kacau).\" Others, however much they complained privately, were \ncareful not to provoke an open confrontation with Bashir for the harm he might do them later. Ghazali, an UMNO \nmember who married into a strong PAS family, may have been upset enough to contribute to a formal letter of \ncomplaint, but he said nothing directly to Bashir. Why? \"I don't want to break my connection (pecah perhubungan) with \nBashir; so I was silent.''\nThe protest against the JKK, however, was not just confined to private character assassination and shared indignation \nabout the injustice done. At an informal gathering in Samat's village shop, a number of PAS members urged that they all \ngo as a crowd to the District Office to complain.62 They had learned earlier that a group from Sungai Kering had \nalready gone to the District Office in Yan Besar to protest the manner in which the survey was being conducted there. \nBut there was not much enthusiasm for setting off. As Ghazali said, \"It was just talk, they weren't brave enough to go.\" \nApparently Mat \"halus\" was the only one angry and/or brave enough to protest in person, but he went to\n61. She added, incidentally, that they had been avoiding her recently, presumably because they would be hard \nput to justify their behavior to her.\n62.

Finally, a number agreed to write a letter of formal protest and send \ncopies to Kedah's chief minister (Menteri Besar), the District Officer, and the National Bureau of Investigation (Biro \nSisiatan Nasional, BSN), which deals with charges of corruption. The letter was drafted that night and signed by Mat \nIsa, Bakri bin Haji Wahab, Mat Nasiall PAS membersand by Ghazali, an UMNO member actually on the JKK, at least \nnominally. The letter respectfully complained about the unfair survey and allocation, blamed the JKK for the state of \naffairs, said village harmony was being destroyed, and asked that someone be sent to put things right.63 It appears that \nsimilar letters were pouring in from many of the other villages selected to get RPK grants.\nNothing came of this protest, although people say that someone from the BSN came to the village a couple of weeks \nlater to talk with Bashir. Bashir denies it. He is, of course, aware that letters have been sent but adds, with a self-assured \nsmile, \"They have no effect\" (tak ada kesan). Haji Salim also tells me that he knows letters have been written \ncondemning him and threatening to take him and the JKK to court. \"If they don't like it, then they should win the next \nelections and give to their own people.\"\nOne night, shortly after it became clear that only UMNO members would be helped, the sign for the RPK in the village \ndewan was painted completely over in black. The police were called the next day and made a cursory search for black \npaint brushes or cans under a few houses to no avail. The perpetrator(s) were never found.\nFor the most part, the open protest was limited to what those who were excluded were able to insinuate by shunning \nmembers of the JKK when they passed and by a kind of \"ritual boycott.\" The power of such \"understatements\" in a \nsmall village such as Sedaka is not trivial. Bashir bore the brunt of the public disdain. It happened that his daughter was \nto be married the following month, and he made a point of having every family called to the bersanding ceremony. At \nleast ten families stayed away altogether from the feast, although most of them would have gone had it not been for this \nepisode.64 A few of the poorer PAS men, such as Pak Yah and Mat \"halus,\" who occasionally worked for Bashir, felt \nobliged to put in an appearance but, to register their disapproval, remained only very briefly (sa'at saja). Haji Kadir \ncame only to eat a snack of sticky rice (menyerok pulut saja) and then left. A few, like Mansur, who would normally \nhave helped with the cooking, came only as guests. There were a host of nuanced ways of insinuating degrees of \ncontempt, and nearly all were em-\n63.

Even those PAS members who went as usual found a way to make their appearance into a political statement. \nThey explained to UMNO friends that it was not their side that had started this, it was not they who were trying to \n\"split\" (pecah) the village. By doing so, they took the high road as the defenders of village values and placed themselves \nin a position of moral superiority to the UMNO leadership.\nBashir was not the only one to experience the new chill in neighborly relations. Cik Tun had used her new lumber to \nrepair and extend a small house her son had used in front of the older, family house. Now she wanted to move the new \nhouse around to the side of the old one and attach it. The operation would require at least seventy people, who would \nsimply pick it up and move it into place. Accordingly, she arranged a house-moving feast (kenduri usung rumah), \ninvited all her neighbors, and prepared a large meal for the work force. Only thirty or forty men appeared. Most of the \nPAS families at her end of the village pointedly stayed away;65 they were understandably reluctant to help move a \nhouse built with lumber and zinc roofing they had been denied. As more than one said to me, \"If UMNO built her \nhouse, well, UMNO would just have to move her house too.\" Despite shouts, grunts, and repeated efforts, the house \ncould simply not be moved with the available manpower. To avoid prolonging what was already an acute \nembarrassment, Bashir sent out five or six UMNO men on motorcycles to fetch another twenty or thirty men. Within an \nhour they had finally scoured up enough additional help so that the house could finally be lifted and moved to its new \nlocation. But most of the new faces had not come from Sedaka, and the absent PAS members took great pleasure in \nretelling, among themselves, this small humiliation for the JKK and Cik Tun.66\nAs he surveyed the social debris of complaints, wounded feelings, boycotts, and seething anger that the Village \nImprovement Scheme had left in its wake, Bashir confided to me that it had been a political disaster. Half the UMNO \nmembers were angry with him because they thought they had been shortchanged. Some were boycotting his store, \namong them the influential midwife Tok Sah Bidan and her friends. \"A shopkeeper,\" he reminded me, \"has to stay on \nthe good side of everyone\" (kena baik dengan semua). All in all, he concluded, his \"influence\" (pengaruh) among \nvillagers had fallen, even though he had given away ''thousands\" of dollars to them. Far from making UMNO stronger, \nthe whole exercise had left it weaker.\nIn the course of presiding over the distribution of spoils, Bashir and other\n65.

The number of people one can assemble for such an occasion is an important reflection on the prestige and \nfriendship network of the host family. In this case, however, the sparse turnout was more a reflection on the JKK \nthan on Cik Tun.\n  \n< previous page\npage_230\nnext page >\n",

How was it possible to explain this \nstrictly partisan treatment of the village? How could the glaring fact that even the poorest PAS members had been \npassed over while wealthy UMNO members were rewarded be explained, let alone legitimated? The justifications that \nwere attempted, with indifferent success, depended a great deal on the audience to which they were addressed. For the \nvillage as a whole, including PAS members, one explanation was given; for UMNO members, another; and for a small \ninner circle of confidants, still a third.\nThe justification publicly offered to PAS friends by Bashir and most of the JKK was, significantly, no real justification \nat all. It was instead the time-honored refuge of petty officials everywhere, namely, that they were simply following \ninstructions from above, doing what they were told. As always in such cases, the explanation was an attempt to distance \nthemselves morally from the blame that attached to their actions. As always, it also implied that their hands were tied; \nthey had no choice in the matter. Thus Bashir explained to those in his shop shortly after the program was announced \nthat everything had been decided \"from above\" (daripada atas). \"Above\" in this case, he said, was the District Officer \nand the Executive Committee of UMNO in this constituency, Bahagian Jerai. The government had ''studied\" the matter \nand had \"ordered\" (suruh) the JKK to give the aid only to UMNO members. It was \"they who wanted to split the \nvillage.\"67 Fadzil adopted the same stance at the coffee shop in town when he knew PAS members were at the next \ntable. \"It's the higher-ups,\" he said, \"it's their (saluran) way of doing things.\" \"We didn't know; it's their decision.\" This \nlame effort to pass on the responsibility for the RPK is notable for two reasons. The first is that it is, almost certainly, a \nconvenient lie. Lebai Sabrani and others with strong UMNO credentials have made it clear that the decisions were taken \nat Haji Salim's house, with most of Bashir's \"kitchen cabinet\" present. And it is also clear that the RPK was distributed \nequally to all families in at least a few villages. The second notable aspect of this attempt to avoid blame is simply that \nit amounts to a clear admission that, at least for the village as a whole, the favoritism of the RPK cannot be justified or \nlegitimized. That being the case, the only strategy left was to shift the onus to other shoulders.\nAnother level of justification emerged when the audience was composed exclusively of UMNO beneficiaries of the \nlargesse, even those who were uneasy with the frankly partisan atmosphere. Here was at least an attempt at legitimation, \nalbeit for only one set of listeners. Against the claims of the most needy or the claims of all households in the village \nwas placed a homely metaphor from family life. The village was, in effect, divided into our children and their children, \ngood children and bad children, \"real\" children and stepchildren.

Amin: \"We have to give property to our children first.\" Fadzil: \"We must help our own children. How can \nwe give to other people's children (anak orang)?\" Haji Salim develops this theme further, perhaps along the lines he \nused when he tried to convince Lebai Sabrani and others that only UMNO families should benefit.\nThe UMNO government gives first and foremost to those people who support (sokong) them. There's not \nenough for everyone, so all of them can't get it. The rebellious children (anak derhaka) who oppose (lawan) \nthe father must wait; they are headstrong (nafsu) and stubborn (keras kepala). When there are many children, \nwe must give more to the children who listen to us, not to those who don't follow. When our own children are \n[made] comfortable, only then can we give to the stepchildren.\nThis notion of a justifiable favoritism within the family was, I suspect, designed as much to reassure the members of the \nJKK as to provide a plausible rationale to the wider UMNO membership.68 Poor UMNO members, for example, could \nwillingly accept the stepchild analogy and still justifiably wonder why there were so many anomalies in the distribution \nwithin their own party, with quite a few well-to-do UMNO activists receiving more than poor party members. Even \nhere, however, we can detect a kind of hedging that gives something away to other village values. The claim of our own \nchildren, or the loyal children, is paramount but not exclusive, and it is implied that all children, even stepchildren, have \na claim as well to the \"parents'\" largesse. This last was emphasized frequently by Bashir, who expected that there would \nbe a second stage to the RPK later in which even PAS members would be permitted to share.\nAmong the more committed and partisan members of the JKK, a rather more cynical atmosphere prevailedan \natmosphere not for public consumption even by the generality of UMNO members. Here the talk of retribution and \npunishment of the PAS faction was openly voiced. Speaking with Amin and me late one evening in the privacy of his \nhouse, Bashir adopted a frankly partisan tone, which I imagine was usually reserved for the inner circles of UMNO. \nThose who are in PAS, he said, will never change; \"Even if you cut off their heads they wouldn't change.\" So why give \nthem anything? Even if we gave assistance to them, he continued, they would still complain, just as they did about the \nfree fertilizer subsidy, saying they did not get their share or that it\n68. Once or twice the argument was made that, even if PAS members were helped, they would not return the \nkindness (balas budi) or ever say \"thank you.\" Here the principle of reciprocity was invoked and joined to the \nmetaphor of the ungrateful or rebellious child.\n  \n< previous page\npage_232\nnext page >\n",

That is their \"rule\" (undang-undang), \"always complain.\" When I interjected that even some \nUMNO members seemed to think that everyone, or at least the poor, should have been helped, he replied, \"This is not \nvillage social relations. Politics is a little different. The world is like that.\"69 This was the closest Bashir came to \nrecognizing openly that what village values required and what politics required were different and that, in this case, the \nformer would just have to be ignored.\nFinally, if one were to step outside the village altogether, even the semblance of homage to local norms tended to \nevaporate. In the course of a conversation with the penghulu Abdul Majid after hours in his office in Sungai Tongkang, \nI delicately raised the question of complaints about the RPK.

In no uncertain terms, he made it clear that the RPK is, in effect, intended to \nstarve out the \"recalcitrants\" (pembangkang). \"Sooner or later they've got to weaken; the rich may be able to hold out, \nbut the poor won't be able to last.\"70 Freed by his outsider status from any need to adopt a social mask or to prettify the \nfacts, Abdul Majid can speak without guile.\nThe smaller and more partisan the audience, the more powerful and untouchable the speaker (Haji Salim and especially \nAbdul Majid), the less tongue-tied the explanations become. The largest landowners and the secure officials can, if they \nwish, dispense with the need to explain themselves or justify their action to those beneath them whose vital interests are \nat stake. Within Sedaka, however, the niceties are largely preserved and an effort is made, however lame, to justify the \nnew opportunities for profit and patronage. The normative raw material at their disposal, alas, is not quite up to the task. \nThe winners are more or less obliged to distort the facts, to give patently bad-faith performances, to claim that their \nhands are tied, and to make do with whatever scraps of moral justification they can cobble together on short notice. \nTheir behavior may serve a higher, or at least different, rationality, but in village terms, in terms of the moral givens of \nMalay rural society, it is not convincing.\nArgument as Resistance\nTaken collectively, the arguments that the village poor have been making have a striking coherence to them. They \nsingle out the most damaging economic and social consequences of double-cropping and mechanization. They assert a \nwide array of \"facts\" about income, combine-harvesting, land-tenure shifts, and employment to bolster their case. They \npromote the view that the well-off, by reason of custom, neighborliness, kinship, and race, are called upon to provide\n69.Ini bukan masyarakat, politik lain sikit, dunia macham itu.\n70.Lama-lama depa kena lembut.

Referring to these claims, they condemn those whose callousness and \nconcern for profit has led them to violate what the poor consider their legitimate expectations. These themes, and the \nassertion of rights which they imply, are much in evidence in the disputes over the gate and the Village Improvement \nScheme. In the first case, the owners of motorcyclesthemselves comfortable familiessuccessfully availed themselves of \nthe logic that once defended the village poor. In the second case, the moral logic of tradition yielded to the logic of \nfaction but at substantial symbolic cost and only because the co-optation of the UMNO poor secured their complicity or \nsilence. Such attempts, partly successful, to preserve and promote a particular worldview, a style of normative \ndiscourse, constitutes a form of resistance that is much more than purely symbolic.\nAt a minimum, the worldview of the poor represents something of a symbolic barrier to another latent form of discourse \nthat would openly legitimize the current practices of most well-off farmers. The latent form of discourse would be the \nstraightforward language of narrow economic interests, profit maximization, accumulation, and property rightsin short, \nthe language of capitalism. As it is, such language has no moral standing in village life. This symbolic disadvantage \nunder which the wealthy labor has, in fact, material consequences. The values promoted most vigorously by the poor, \nand given tacit recognition even in the discourse of the rich, confer reputation, status, and prestige on those who observe \nthem. Conversely, they make those who systematically violate them the object of character assassination. Forced to \nchoose, in effect, between their reputation in the village and the full profits of double-cropping, many of the wealthy \nsteer a course that does not completely repudiate those norms. The choice is not, after all, a single choice, but one that \nmust be made day in and day out in a host of small transactions. Thus, there are seven farmers in the village, four well-\noff, who are praised for not using the combine-harvester on part or all of their land, at least after the irrigated season. A \nfew rent out to neighbors or relatives small plots of land, seldom more than a single relong, that they might otherwise \nfarm themselves. Abdul Rahman is particularly notable for occasionally renting a relong or two to poorer friends and \ncharging modest rents. Land rented within the village, as this and other studies have shown, is provided at lower rents \nthan land rented to outsiders. Some comfortable villagers, among them Lebai Pendek, Haji Jaafar, and Bashir, are often \npraised for the frequency with which they hold feasts to which all villagers are invited.71 At least ten villagers, not all \nof them wealthy, are known to be rather more generous with zakat to laborers and to give wages in advance. None of \nthese facts should obscure the overall tendency for wealthy villagers, and especially\n71. In Basir's case this praise is tempered with a realization by villagers that his dual role as shopkeeper and \npolitical leader requires him to make a greater effort than othersan effort that, in large part, is seen to be self-\ninterested.\n  \n< previous page\npage_234\nnext page >\n",

What they do suggest, however, is that the sanction \nof local opinion and custom continues to exert a small but perceptible influence on conduct. The desire to be thought \nwell of, or at least not despised, is a material force in the village made possible only by the symbolic mobilization of the \npoor around certain customary values.72 Put another way, the delaying of the complete transition to capitalist relations \nof production is in itself an important and humane accomplishment. It is often the only accomplishment within reach of \na beleaguered peasantry.73\nThe values the poor are defending are all, without exception, very much tied to their material interests as a class. We \nwould, however, mistake the full nature of the struggle here if we were to limit ourselves to its material effects alone. So \nlong as men and women continue to justify their conduct by reference to values, the struggle for the symbolic high \nground between groups and classes will remain an integral part of any conflict over power. In this context, the \nconclusions of E. P. Thompson, in his discussion of eighteenth-century plebian culture and protest, are applicable, with \na few adjustments, to Sedaka.\nThe gentry had three major sources of controla system of influence and preferment which could scarcely \ncontain the unpreferred poor; the majesty and terror of law; and the symbolism of their hegemony. There was, \nat times, a delicate social equilibrium, in which the rulers were forced to make concessions. Hence the contest \nfor symbolic authority may be seen, not as a way of acting out ulterior \"real\" contests, but as a real contest in \nits own right. Plebian protest, on occasion, had no further objective than to challenge the gentry's hegemonic \nassurance, strip power of its symbolic mystifications, or even just to blaspheme.74\nIf we understand that the \"protest\" in Sedaka is rarely openly manifested and that the \"symbolic hegemony\" of the \nwealthy class is far more tenuous, we are still in the presence of a \"contest for symbolic authority.\" By rewarding, if \nonly symbolically, those whose conduct is more nearly in accord with their values and by slandering those whose \nconduct most blatantly transgresses their values, the village poor undercut the moral authority of their enemies by \nallocating virtually\n72. That social pressure, of course, is not purely symbolic, since the labor of villagers is still necessary for \nsome phases of paddy cultivation. Beyond that, as we shall see, the social pressure is reinforced by threats of \nviolence and theft as well.\n73. This effort to delay capitalist relations of production is often and, I believe, mistakenly used to demonstrate the \nsuperior historical role of the proletariat.

In the process, they help unite \nmost of those disadvantaged by double-cropping behind a particular version of the facts, behind a particular set of \nclaims, behind a particular worldviewor perhaps \"villageview\" would be a more appropriate term. This symbolic barrier \nis hardly insurmountable, but it is nonetheless a real obstacle to the designs of the rich.75\nThe symbolic resistance of the poorer villagers is as important for what it rejects as for what it asserts. It rejects, nearly \nwholesale, the characterizations the rich give to themselves and their actions. Haji Kadir may be called Pak Haji to his \nface, but he is called Pak Ceti behind his back. Rich farmers may explain their use of the combine-harvester by their \ninability to find local labor on time, but this account is rejected by those most affected, who see it as an avaricious \ndesire for quick profits. Landlords may plead poverty when raising the rent, but the poor \"know\" it is a ruse and mock \nthe performance. The list could be extended indefinitely but the point is clear; at virtually every turn the self-\ncharacterizations and justifications of the rich are contested and subverted.\nAbove all, the symbolic resistance of the poor rejects the categories the rich attempt to impose upon them. They know \nthat the large farmers increasingly see them as lazy, unreliable, dishonest, and grasping. They know that, behind their \nbacks, they are blamed as the authors of their own victimization and that, in daily social encounters, they are \nincreasingly treated with little consideration or, worse, ignored. Much of what they have to say among themselves is a \ndecisive rejection of the attempt to relegate them to a permanently inferior economic and ritual status and a decisive \nassertion of their citizenship rights in this small community.\nTo understand what is at stake here, we must begin with a far broader and more penetrating appreciation of the meaning \nof poverty in this context. I fear that I may have thus far contributed to a narrow view both by emphasizing the \neconomic losses of mechanization and tenure shifts and by continually referring to \"the poor\" of Sedaka.\nPoverty is far more than a simple matter of not enough calories or cash. This is particularly the case in Sedaka, where no \none is in imminent danger of actually starving. For most of the village poor, poverty represents a far greater threat to \ntheir modest standing in the community. It is possible in any peasant community\n75. Kessler, in his study of the social basis of PAS opposition in Kelantan, puts the matter persuasively by \nemphasizing the fusion of symbolic and material action: \"It {this study} has also dispensed with the equally \nforced distinction between instrumental and symbolic political actions and goals, between material and ideal \nfactors. Local issues are but national issues in a particular guise, concrete and immediately apprehendable, \nand the articulation of responses to them, in the distinctive dialects of particular contexts, is far from \nunreal. . . . Symbols and symbolic action are viable only when they relate to real issues and popular \nexperience of them. . . . They have a real basis and also real consequences.\" Islam and Politics, 244.\n  \n< previous page\npage_236\nnext page >\n",

Both \"enough\" and \"decent\" are defined in traditional terms. A peasant should have enough \nland to support a household and enable its head to play a respectable role in the village community . . . \nWhenever an increase in commercial relationships has threatened this type of independence, it has produced \nan angry sense of injustice. . . . It is important to realize that there is much more to this anger than straight-\nforward material interest. Such people are morally outraged because they feel that their whole way of life is \nunder unfair attack.76\nAll of these decencies, as Moore indicates, assume a certain level of material resources necessary to underwrite them. \nTo fall below this level is not merely to be that much poorer materially; it is to fall short of what is locally defined as a \nfully human existence. It is as much a socially devastating loss of standing as it is a loss of income.\nIn Sedaka, the cultural and ritual standing of many poor peasants was seriously compromised even before double-\ncropping. For example, the village has more than its share of poor women who have married late or not at all. Men \nsometimes refer to them as \"unmarketable maidens\" (anak dara tak laku), but they will also add that their parents can \npromise no farming land to the groom. During the feast of Ramadan (Hari Raya Puasa), a good many men from poor \nhouseholds remain at home rather than visit wealthier neighbors. A few will admit that they are absent because they are \n\"embarrassed\" (malu), since they \"cannot afford to reciprocate\" (tak boleh membalas) the sweets and cakes that are \nexpected for this major Muslim feast day.77 The feasts that the village poor do manage to\n76.Injustice: The Social Bases of Obedience and Revolt (White Plains: M. E. Sharpe, 1978).\n77. Perhaps the comparable humiliation for poor Christian Americans is the inability to provide their children with \nthe presents that have come virtually to define what Christmas means. The sacrifices they will make, including \nmortgaging their own future, to achieve the minimal decencies are no less than what poor Malays will make to \nprovide an acceptable Hari Raya fare. Along these same lines, it is frequently said that conversion to Protestantism \nin Central and South America appeals particularly to the poor, who are unable to finance the ritual cycle that has \nbecome associated with Catholicism. By doing so, they make a virtue of necessity and dignify their \nnonparticipation.\n  \n< previous page\npage_237\nnext page >\n",

Their shabbiness is \ntypically seized upon by the better-off as a mark of the host's inability to acquit himself honorably. The poor find it \ndifficult or impossible to contribute food for the moreh {evening meals after prayer} during the fasting month. They \nactually avoid promising a feast in their prayers for recovery from an illness or in their prayers for a child of a certain \nsex (usually male) during a pregnancy, because they know they will be unable to fulfill that sacred vow. Kenduri that \nare frequently held by wealthier villagersfor example, kenduri berendul (or buaian) for a young child, kenduri cukur \nkepala (or rambut) also for a young child, kenduri to thank Allah for some good fortune or to pray for ancestorsare \nrarely celebrated by the poor. Aside from the obligatory ceremonies for the dead, there are at least seven families who \nhave held no feasts whatever for the past six years. All are among the poorest twenty families in the community. Their \nloss of status in a culture where feast giving is perhaps the main coin of exchange is severe.78 The poor are largely \nexcluded, by their penury, from both the death-benefit associations and the groups that buy and share the crockery \nnecessary for any substantial feast. It is extremely rare for a poor peasant family to be able to send any of their children \nbeyond primary school, given the expenses involved. Their children, as we have seen, are far more likely to leave early \nand permanently, since there is no paddy land to hold them in the village.\nIt is in this larger context alone that poverty as it is experienced in Sedaka takes on its full meaning. Those with little or \nno land of their own have always been relegated to a rather marginal ritual position. But as long as tenancies and work \nwere available they managed, if only barely, to achieve the minimal ritual decencies. The burst of feast giving during \nthe first four years of double-cropping when work was plentiful is an indication of the pent-up ritual deficit that was \nbeing remedied. In this brief boom, the poor were able to assert a claim to status and ritual dignity formerly available \nonly to middle and rich peasants. Now, with machine-harvesting, broadcasting, and the loss of tenancies, the resources \nto back those claims are either gone or receding fast.\nThe cultural and material consequences of double-cropping are, of course, inseparable here. The modest ritual status to \nwhich the poor could lay claim was predicated not only on their earnings but also on the fact that they remained \nessential to the process of paddy cultivation and hence essential to the large farmers who grew most of that paddy. If \nthey were treated with some consideration, if they were invited to kenduri, if they were given small gifts of zakat after \nthe harvest, if their requests for loans or advance wages were heeded, it\n78. Quite a few of them who have no farming landeither rented or ownedare thereby excluded both from the \npractice of exchanging labor and from feasts such as kenduri tolak bala designed to pray for rain or ward off \nspecifically agricultural disasters.\n  \n< previous page\npage_238\nnext page >\n",

While there is no mechanical relationship between the role of the poor in \nproduction (the \"base\" in Marxist terms) and their role in cultural life (superstructure), it is undeniable that, as the need \nfor their labor has plummeted, they have experienced a corresponding loss in the respect and recognition accorded them. \nThus, when the poor speak among themselves, they emphasize far more their loss of standing and recognition than the \nloss of income per se. How else are we to understand the many comments about the humiliation of idleness at harvest \ntime when, before, they would have been out working? How else are we to understand the bitter comments about not \nbeing invited to kenduri, about not being greeted on the village path, about not even being seen, about being treated \nrudely or \"pushed aside\" (tolak tepi)? The loss of the simple human considerations to which they feel entitled is at least \nas infuriating as the drop in their household income. Much of the local furor over the Village Improvement Scheme, and \neven the gate opening, can be seen in these terms. In each case, what is being resisted by appeal to custom is the attempt \nto revoke the claim of one group of villagers to what are considered the normal rights of local citizenship.\nAmidst the attention typically devoted by left-wing scholars to the economic privations of low wage rates, \nunemployment, poor housing, and inadequate nutrition among workers and peasants, more homely matters of ritual \ndecencies and personal respect are frequently lost sight of altogether. And yet, for the victims themselves, these issues \nappear to be central. One of the major resentments among the historically turbulent rural workers of Andalusia, for \nexample, is the \"upper-class practice of social self-removal\" called separación. As Gilmore observes:\nThey denounce separación because they feel it is a reflection of arrogance and contempt. . . . The bitterness of \nthe working-class response stems partly from a deeply felt moral postulate: the poor people of the community \nfeel that to ignore a man is actively to disparage and insult him, purposefully to treat him as something less \nthan a man.79\nCloser to our own terrain, Wan Zawawi Ibrahim's fine study of Malay plantation workers recently recruited from east \ncoast villages deals at length with the\n79. David Gilmore, \"Patronage and Class Conflict in Southern Spain,\" Man (N.S.) 12 (1978): 449. In his \ndetailed history of the German working-class movement from 1848 to 1920, Barrington Moore emphasizes \nhow frequently the demand for what he calls \"decent human treatment\" appears in the accounts of workers \nthemselves. Writing of the workers councils after the First World War, he concludes:\nThe source of the workers' anger was essentially a combination of two things: certain material \ndeprivations and what they themselves called lack of decent human treatment. Lack of decent human \ntreatment offended their sense of fairness. In their terms it apparently meant the failure to treat the \nworker as a human being in the course of ordinary routine contacts, such as excessive gruffness, failure \nto use polite forms, and the like.\n  \n< previous page\npage_239\nnext page >\n",

That threat has at least three facets: it is the palpable threat of permanent \npoverty; it is the no less palpable loss of a meaningful and respected productive role in the community; and it is the \nrelated loss of a great part of both the social recognition and cultural dignity that define full membership in this village. \nTo call such matters bread-and-butter issues is largely to miss their significance. When the poor symbolically \nundermine the self-awarded status of the rich by inventing nicknames, by malicious gossip, by boycotting their feasts, \nby blaming their greed and stinginess for the current state of affairs, they are simultaneously asserting their own claim \nto status. Even when, as frequently happens, a poor family holds a feast they can ill afford, it is a small but significant \nsign of their determination not to accept the cultural marginalization their scant means imply. It is in this sense, \nespecially, that the war of words, the ideological struggle in Sedaka, is a key part of \"everyday resistance.\" The refusal \nto accept the definition of the situation as seen from above and the refusal to condone their own social and ritual \nmarginalization, while not sufficient, are surely necessary for any further resistance.\n80.

How right the working classes are in \ntheir \"materialism\"! How right they are to realize that the belly comes before the soul, not in the scale of values but \nin point of time. \nGeorge Orwell, \"Looking Back on the Spanish War\" (1943)\nFrom the account thus far, one might justifiably assume that the struggle between rich and poor was largely confined to \na war of words. That assumption would not be entirely wrong, but it would be misleading. For the poor and wealthy \npeasants of Sedaka are not merely having an argument; they are also having a fight. Under the circumstances, the fight \nis less a pitched battle than a low-grade, hit-and-run, guerrilla action. The kind of \"fight\" to be described and analyzed \nin this chapter is, I believe, the typical, \"garden variety\" resistance that characterizes much of the peasantry and other \nsubordinate classes through much of their unfortunate history. More specifically, however, we are dealing here with the \nundramatic but ubiquitous struggle against the effects of state-fostered capitalist development in the countryside: the \nloss of access to the means of production (proletarianization), the loss of work (marginalization) and income, and the \nloss of what little status and few claims the poor could assert before double-cropping. Most readings of the history of \ncapitalist development, or simply a glance at the current odds in this context, would conclude that this struggle is a lost \ncause. It may well be just that. If so, the poor peasantry of Sedaka finds itself in distinguished and numerous historical \ncompany.\nAfter considering the major reasons why open collective protest is rare, I examine the actual patterns of resistance to \nchanges in production relations: arson, sabotage, boycotts, disguised strikes, theft, and imposed mutuality among the \npoor. I then assess the role of coercionof what might be called \"everyday forms of repression\"in producing such \ndisguised forms of struggle\n  \n< previous page\npage_241\nnext page >\n",

Finally, I take a step backward to explore, in more general terms, the definition of resistance \nand the reasons why many of the actions considered here might justifiably be termed resistance.\nObstacles to Open, Collective Resistance\nAn observer need not look long and hard to find examples of further resistance in Sedaka. In fact, they abound. They \nare, however, forms of resistance that reflect the conditions and constraints under which they are generated. If they are \nopen, they are rarely collective, and, if they are collective, they are rarely open. The encounters seldom amount to more \nthan \"incidents,\" the results are usually inconclusive, and the perpetrators move under cover of darkness or anonymity, \nmelting back into the \"civilian\" population for protective cover.\nTo appreciate why resistance should assume such guises, it is helpful to pause briefly to consider a few of the major \n\"givens\" that determine the range of available options. This will anticipate somewhat the material that follows, and a \nfew of the issues raised only schematically here will be developed at greater length later in this chapter and the next.\nPerhaps the most important \"given\" that structures the options open to Sedaka's poor is simply the nature of the changes \nthey have experienced. Some varieties of change, other things equal, are more explosive than othersmore likely to \nprovoke open, collective defiance. In this category I might place those massive and sudden changes that decisively \ndestroy nearly all the routines of daily life and, at the same time, threaten the livelihood of much of the population. Here \nin Sedaka, however, the changes that constitute the green revolution have been experienced as a series of piecemeal \nshifts in tenure and technique. As painful as the changes were, they tended to come gradually and to affect only a small \nminority of villagers at any one time. The shift from rents collected after the harvest (sewa padi) to fixed rents paid \nbefore planting (sewa tunai), for example, affected only tenants and was pushed through over several seasons, so that \nonly a few tenants found themselves simultaneously in jeopardy. Furthermore, most of them were able to hang on to \ntheir tenancy even if it meant an additional burden of debt. If we could imagine a single, large landlord insisting on \nsewa tunai from all the village tenants in the same season, the response might have been very different. The loss of \ntenancies that resulted when landlords decided to resume cultivation themselves or to lease (pajak) their land to wealthy \ncommercial operators followed a similar pattern. Much the same can be said for the raising of rents and for the \nsubstitution of broadcasting for transplanting. The screws were turned piecemeal and at varying speeds, so that the \nvictims were never more than a handful at a time. In this case as in others, each landlord or farmer insisting on the \nchange represented a particular situation confronting one or, at most, a few individuals.\nThe only exception to this pattern was the introduction of combine-harvesting\n  \n< previous page\npage_242\nnext page >\n",

Even in this case, however, the impact \nwas not instantaneous, nor was it without a certain ambiguity for many in the village. For the first two or three seasons \nthe economic impact on the poor was noticeable but not devastating. Middle peasants were genuinely torn between the \nadvantage of getting their crop in quickly and the loss of wage earning for themselves or their children. A few of the \nsmallest farmers, as I have noted, succumbed to the temptation to use the combine in order to hasten their exit for \ncontract labor in the city. At no single moment did combine-harvesting represent a collective threat to the livelihood of \na solid majority of villagers.\nAnother striking characteristic of the agricultural transformation in Kedahone that serves very powerfully to defuse \nclass conflictis the fact that it removes the poor from the productive process rather than directly exploits them. One after \nanother, the large farmers and landlords in the Muda Scheme have eliminated terrains of potential struggle over the \ndistribution of the harvest and profits from paddy growing. In place of the struggle over piece-rates for cutting and \nthreshing, there is now only a single payment to the machine broker. In place of negotiations over transplanting costs, \nthere is the option of broadcasting the seed and avoiding the conflict altogether. In place of tense and contentious \ndisputes over the timing and level of rents, there is the alternative of hiring the machines and farming oneself or leasing \nto an outsider for a lump sum. Even the shift to sewa tunai eliminates the tales of woe and ruin that previously \ndominated the post-harvest claims for rent adjustment. The changes themselves, of coursedismissing a tenant, switching \nto the machines, moving to fixed rents before plantingare not so simple to put across. But once they have been put \nacross, the ex-tenant or ex-wage laborer simply ceases to be relevant; there is no further season-by-season struggle. \nOnce the connection and the struggle in the realm of production have been severed, it is a simple matter also to sever the \nconnectionand the strugglein the realm of ritual, charity, and even sociability. This aspect of the green revolution, by \nitself, goes a long way toward accounting for the relative absence, here and elsewhere, of mass violence. If the profits of \nthe green revolution had depended on squeezing more from the tenants, rather than dismissing them, or extracting more \nwork for less pay from laborers, the consequences for class conflict would surely have been far more dramatic. As it is, \nthe profits from double-cropping depend much less on exploiting the poor directly than on ignoring and replacing \nthem.1 Class conflict, like any conflict, is played out on a sitethe threshing floor, the assembly line, the place where \npiece-rates or rents are settledwhere vital interests are at stake. What double-cropping in Muda has achieved is a gradual \nbulldozing of the sites where class conflict has historically occurred.\n1. As a recently sacked factory worker once remarked ruefully to me, \"The only thing worse than being \nexploited is not being exploited.\"\n  \n< previous page\npage_243\nnext page >\n",

The impact of each of \nthe changes we have discussed is mediated by the very complex and overlapping class structure of Sedaka. There are \nwell-off tenants and very poor tenants; there are landlords who are (or whose children are) also tenants and laborers; \nthere are smallholders who need wage work to survive but also hire the combines. Thus each of the important shifts in \ntenure and production creates not only victims and beneficiaries but also a substantial strata whose interests are not so \neasily discerned. Sedaka is not Morelos, where a poor and largely undifferentiated peasantry confronted a common \nenemy in the sugar plantation. It is in fact only in comparatively rare circumstances that the class structure of the \ncountryside was such as to produce either a decisive single cleavage or a nearly uniform response to external pressure. \nThe very complexity of the class structure in Sedaka militates against collective opinion and, hence, collective action on \nmost issues.\nThe obstacles to collective action presented by the local class structure are compounded by other cleavages and \nalliances that cut across class. These are the familiar links of kinship, friendship, faction, patronage, and ritual ties that \nmuddy the \"class waters\" in virtually any small community. Nearly without exception, they operate to the advantage of \nthe richer farmers by creating a relationship of dependence that restrains the prudent poor man or woman from acting in \nclass terms. Thus Mansur, a poor landless laborer, is related to Shamsul, one of the richest men in the village, and can \nexpect occasional free meals at his house as well as casual work now and then. While this does not prevent Mansur \nfrom privately complaining about the loss of work and the tightfisted rich in general, it does help explain his UMNO \nmembership and his deferential profile in village politics. Mat \"halus\" is extremely poor, rather outspoken privately on \nclass issues, and a member of PAS. But he rents a single relong from his father-in-law, Abdul Rahman, a fairly wealthy \nUMNO landowner, and takes care not to embarrass him by making trouble in the village. Other examples might be \ncited, but the point is clear. A small minority of the village poor are hedged in by links of kinship and/or petty economic \ndependencies they are reluctant to jeopardize. If they disagree with their relative, landlord, or employer, they are likely \nto do so with circumspection. It would be a mistake to over-emphasize such ties, for they are certainly rarer and more \nfragile than they once were, and many of the poor are not constrained in this way at all. They do, nevertheless, \nneutralize a fraction of the poor.2\n2. It goes virtually without saying that the meager possibilities for joint action among the village poor all but \nevaporate once we leave the community. Even the values that the poor use to justify their claim to work, land, \nand charity are meant to apply largely within the village itself. While kinship links join most of the poor to \nrelatives elsewhere, these are links of family and not of class. If there were a national or even regional \npolitical vehicle that gave effective voice to the class interests of the poor on such issues as land reform, \nmechanization, and employment, it would undoubtedly find a large following. But Partai Islam (PAS) is not \nthat vehicle,\n(footnote continued on next page)\n  \n< previous page\npage_244\nnext page >\n",

As Moore reminds us in \nquite another context, \"throughout the centuries one of the common man's most frequent and effective responses to \noppression {has been} flight.\"3 Nowhere has this option been more historically significant than in Southeast Asia in \ngeneral and Malaya in particular. So long as there was a land frontier and so long as control over manpower rather than \nland was the basis of surplus extraction, the possibility of what one writer has awkwardly called \"avoidance protest\" has \nalways proved more attractive than the risk of open confrontation.4 Much to the consternation of their indigenous \nleaders as well as their colonial rulers, the rural Malay population has always been exceptionally mobilemoving to \nanother petty chiefdom, leaving one plot of land to make a new clearing and homestead in the forest, switching crops \nand often occupations in the processand has classically \"voted with its feet.'' Because of its particular demography and \nsocial organization, it would not be an exaggeration to say that \"exit\" rather than \"voice\" had come to characterize the \ntraditional and preferred response to oppression in Malay society.5 Fortunately for the contemporary losers in the green \nrevolution, this traditional option is still available to many.\nFor half a century at the very least, a substantial portion of the population increase in Kedah's rice bowl has been \nmoving away. They have contributed, as pioneers, to the opening up of new paddy areas in Perak, Perlis, Pahang, Johor, \nand the inland districts of Kedah itself. Virtually every poor family in the village has, at one time or another, applied for \nacceptance to government-sponsored settlement schemes (ranchangan), where incomes from rubber and especially oil \npalm are routinely more than can be wrested from even a substantial paddy farm. Only a few have been selected, and \nthey are typically not from among the poorest villagers. Still, the slim chance of becoming a sponsored settler \n(peneroka) is a factor in preventing more open expressions of local conflict. For the children of modest and poor \nvillagers, the option of factory work and domestic service (for women) and full-time urban contract labor (for men) are \navailable. For the\n(footnote continued from previous page)\ndominated as it is by large landowners, and the socialist party (Partai Rakyat), for reasons of repression and \ncommunalism, has never established a real foothold in Kedah.\n3.

This last, and most common, resort not only reduces the economic pressure on poor families \nbut also removes the head of household from active participation in village affairs for much of the year. Such \nsemiproletarians still reside largely in the village and may even farm a small plot of paddy land, but they play an \nincreasingly marginal role in the local issues that might provoke class conflict. A major slump in off-farm employment \nwould, of course, change this picture dramatically by making local work and access to land that much more salient.6 \nFor the time being, however, the ability to raid the cash economy to make good the local subsistence deficit continues to \nprovide a less risky alternative to local conflict.\nLest one gain the impression from the foregoing that the obstacles to class conflict in Sedaka are entirely a matter of the \ncomplex local stratification, the piecemeal character of changes in production relations, and the alternative sources of \nincome, I hasten to add that repression and the fear of repression are very much involved as well. The chilling role of \nrepression as it is experienced by poor villagers will become all too apparent in the accounts that follow. Here it is \nsufficient simply to note that the efforts to halt or impede the growth of combine-harvesting occurred in a climate of \nfear generated by local elites, by the police, by the \"Special-Branch\" internal security forces, by a pattern of political \narrests and intimidation. There is good reason to believe that the local campaign against the combine would have \nassumed a more open and defiant course had it not been for the justifiable fears generated by coercion.\nThe fifth and final obstacle to open resistance makes sense only against a background of expected repression. This \nobstacle is simply the day-to-day imperative of earning a livingof household survivalwhich Marx appropriately termed \n\"the dull compulsion of economic relations.\"7 Lacking any realistic possibility, for the time being, of directly and \ncollectively redressing their situation, the village poor have little choice but to adjust, as best they can, to the \ncircumstances they confront daily. Tenants may bitterly resent the rent they must pay for their small plot, but they must \npay it or lose the land; the near landless may deplore the loss of wage work, but they must scramble for the few \nopportunities available; they may harbor deep animosities toward the clique that dominates village politics, but they \nmust act with circumspection if they wish to benefit from any of the small advantages that clique can confer.\nAt least two aspects of this grudging, pragmatic adaptation to the realities\n6. Malaysia's strong foreign-exchange position and its diversified exports make it less vulnerable than many \nother Third World economies, but it is nevertheless vulnerable to any deep and prolonged slump. Shortfalls in \nprivate investment and in export earnings and the resulting need to trim public spending over the past two \nyears (198182) have made this vulnerability increasingly apparent.\n7.

The first is that it does not rule out certain forms of resistance, although it surely sets limits that only \nthe foolhardy would transgress. The second is that it is above all pragmatic; it does not imply normative consent to those \nrealities. To understand this is simply to grasp what is, in all likelihood, the situation for most subordinate classes \nhistorically. They struggle under conditions that are largely not of their own making, and their pressing material needs \nnecessitate something of a daily accommodation to those conditions. Dissident intellectuals from the middle or upper \nclasses may occasionally have the luxury of focusing exclusively on the prospects for long-term structural change, but \nthe peasantry or the working class are granted no holiday from the mundane pressures of making a living. If we observe, \nas we shall, a good deal of \"conforming\" behavior in daily social life in Sedaka, we have no reason to assume that it \nderives from some symbolic hegemony or normative consensus engineered by elites or by the state. The duress of the \nquotidian is quite sufficient. Durkheim and Weber recognized, as did Marx, \"that human beings are forced to behave in \ncertain directions regardless of their own preferences and inclinations.\"8 Durkheim's view of the daily constraints on the \nindustrial working class could be applied with even greater emphasis to the peasantry:\nThis tension in social relations is due, in part, to the fact that the working classes are not really satisfied with \nthe conditions under which they live, but very often accept them only as constrained and forced, since they \nhave not the means to change them.9\nIn the long run, and in certain circumstances, the peasantry and the working class do have \"the means to change\" \nfundamentally their situation. But in the short runtoday, tomorrow, and the day afterthey face a situation that very \nsharply restricts their real options.10 The few opportunities for land and work remaining to Sedaka's poor depend today, \nas always, on the sufferance of the wealthy. If much of the day-to-day public behavior of the poor reflects that fact,\n8. Nicholas Abercrombie, Stephen Hill, and Bryan S.

This resistance went well beyond the arguments about its efficiency, \nthe complaints over lost wages, and the slander directed against those who hired it, which I have already described. \nThroughout the rice bowl of Kedah there were efforts physically to obstruct its entry into the fields, incidents of arson \nand sabotage, and widespread attempts to organize \"strikes\" of transplanters against those who first hired the machine. \nAll of these actions ultimately failed to prevent the mechanization of the paddy harvest, although they undoubtedly \ndelayed it somewhat. A close examination of the forms of resistance and the responses of large farmers can teach us a \ngreat deal about both the possibilities and limits that help structure this resistance.\nCombines were, of course, not the first machines that had threatened the livelihood of poorer villagers in Muda. As we \nhave seen in the preceding chapter, the use of tractors and trucks to haul paddy directly from the field to town had \nearlier sparked spirited and successful resistance in some villages. The threat posed by combines, however, was of a far \ngreater magnitude. Sporadic resistance began as early as 1970, when the first small experimental machines, adapted \nfrom a Japanese prototype, were used in field trials near the town of Jitra. Officials of the Muda Agricultural \nDevelopment Authority, who conducted the trials, recalled several incidents of sabotage, all of which they chose to call \n\"vandalism.\"11 Batteries were removed from the machines and thrown in irrigation ditches; carburetors and other vital \nparts such as distributors and air filters were smashed; sand and mud were put into the gas tank; and various objects \n(stones, wire, nails) were thrown into the augers. Two aspects of this sabotage deserve particular emphasis. First, it was \nclear that the goal of the saboteurs was not simple theft, for nothing was actually stolen. Second, all of the sabotage was \ncarried out at night by individuals or small groups acting anonymously. They were, furthermore, shielded by their \nfellow villagers who, if they knew who was involved, claimed total ignorance when the police came to investigate. As a \nresult, no prosecutions were ever made.

Poorer villagers in Sedaka can remember \nseveral incidents, which they recount with something akin to glee. Tok Mahmud, for example, told me that he knew \nexactly how to jam a combine's augerwhere to put the barbed wire or nailsbecause he had friends (kawan) who had done \nit. He declined to elaborate because, he said, if he talked openly his friends might be arrested (tangkap). Sukur described \na more dramatic incident, two seasons before I arrived, near Tokai, just a few miles south of Sedaka, where a combine \nwas set on fire. A number of poor people (orang susah), he said, surrounded the Malay night watchman and asked him \nwho owned the machine (Jentera siapa?). When he replied that it belonged to a Chinese syndicate, they ordered him to \nclimb down and then poured kerosene over the engine and cab and set it alight. Two Malay young men were arrested \nthe next day but were quickly released for lack of evidence. Villagers report several other incidents of trees being felled \nacross the combine's path into one village or another and of wire being jammed into the auger, particularly near \nSelangkuh.\nI made no effort to assemble a complete inventory of reported incidents, although it was a rare peasant who could not \nrecall one or two. No one, however, could recall any such incident in Sedaka itself. This may merely reflect an \nunderstandable reluctance to call attention to themselves. And at no time did the overall volume of sabotage reach \nanything like the level of machine breaking that accompanied the introduction of mechanical threshers into England in \nthe 1830s.12\nAt the same time that individuals and small groups of men were attacking the machines, there were the beginnings of a \nquiet but more collective effort by women to bring pressure to bear on the farmers who hired the machines. Men and \nwomenoften from the same familyhad, of course, each lost work to the combine, but it was only the women who still \nhad any real bargaining\n12. For the now classic study of this movement, see E. J. Hobsbawm and George Rude, Captain Swing (New \nYork: Pantheon, 1968). Without attempting an inevitably strained comparison, I note that the rural Luddites of \nthe early nineteenth century had several advantages over the peasantry of Kedah when it came to mobilizing \nagainst threshing machines. They were far more fully proletarianized and dependent on wage labor; they \ncould look to a set of traditional legal protections that reinforced their claim to a living wage; and they faced a \nrepressive apparatus that was less firmly planted in the countryside. They too, of course, were overcome, but \nonly by a military force that by the standards of the time was unprecedented. The resistance in Kedah was \nmuch more sporadic and abbreviated, although the saboteurs shared with their English counterparts a \npreference for the anonymity that acting under cover of darkness provided. By 1979, public warnings by \nofficials and more rigorous guarding of the machines themselves had reduced the incidence of this form of \nresistance to negligible proportions.\n  \n< previous page\npage_249\nnext page >\n",

They were, for the time being, still in control of transplanting.13 The group of women (kumpulan share, from \nthe English) who reaped a farmer's land were typically the same group that had earlier transplanted the same field. They \nwere losing roughly half their seasonal earnings, and they understandably resented transplanting a crop for a farmer who \nwould use the combine at harvest time. Thus, in Sedaka and, it appears, throughout much of the Muda region, such \nwomen resolved to organize a boycott (boikot) that would deny transplanting services to their employers who hired the \ncombine.\nThree of the five \"share groups\" in Sedaka evidently made some attempts to enforce such a boycott. Those groups of \nanywhere from six to nine women were led by Rosni (a widow), Rokiah (the wife of Mat Buyong), and Miriam (the \nwife of Mat Isa). The remaining two groups, led by the wives of Tajuddin and Ariffin, appear not to have been involved, \nbut neither group would agree to plant paddy for a farmer who was being boycotted by one of the other three gangs. \nWhy the groups of Rosni, Rokiah, and Miriam took the initiative is not entirely clear. They are composed of women \nfrom families that are, on average, slightly poorer than those in the remaining two groups, but only slightly. The first \ntwo are, as well, largely from PAS households, but this may be as much due to kinship and neighborhood as to \nfactionalism per se, and in any case they were frequently boycotting farmers from their own political faction. If we rely \non local explanations for the pattern of resistance, the consensus is that Rosni and Rokiah depend heavily on wage labor \nto support their families and are at the same time \"courageous\" (berani).14\nThe forms the boycott took were very much in keeping with the kinds of cautious resistance I have so far described. At \nno time was there ever an open confrontation between a farmer who used the combine and his transplanters. Instead, the \nanonymous and indirect approach of cara sembunyi tau with which we are familiar was employed. The women \"let it be \nknown\" through intermediaries that the group was dissatisfied (tak puas hati) with the loss of harvest work and would \nbe reluctant (segan) to transplant the fields of those who had hired the combine the previous season. They also let it be \nknown that, when and if a combine broke down in the course of the harvest, a farmer who wanted then to get his crop in \nby hand could not count on his old workers to bail him out.\n13. Broadcasting (tabor kering) only began to pose a serious threat to hand transplanting by 1979 or 1980.\n14. Rosni, as we have noted, is a widow, while Rokiah's husband is considered rather weak-minded, so that \nRokiah is normally seen as the head of her household, making all the basic decisions. Such women, especially if \nthey are past child-bearing age, are treated virtually as \"honorary\" males and are exempt from many of the \ncustomary requirements of modesty and deference expected of women in Malay society.\n  \n< previous page\npage_250\nnext page >\n",

None of the three groups refused outright to transplant paddy for those who had harvested with the combine \nin the previous season. Rather, they delayed; the head of the share group would tell the offending farmer that they were \nbusy and could not get to his land just yet. Only a dozen or so farmers had used the combine the previous season, so the \nshare groups had a good deal of work to occupy them just transplanting the crops of those who had not mechanized.15 \nThe transplanters thus kept their options open; they avoided a direct refusal to transplant, which would have provoked \nan open break. Fully abreast of the rumors of a boycott, the farmers who had been put off became increasingly anxious \nas their nursery paddy was passing its prime and as they feared their crop might not be fully mature before the \nscheduled date for shutting off the supply of water. Their state of mind was not improved by the sight of their neighbors' \nnewly transplanted fields next to their own vacant plots.\nAfter more than two weeks of this war of nervesthe seeming boycott that never fully announced itselfsix farmers \"let it \nbe known\" that they were arranging for outside laborers to come and transplant their crops. By most accounts, these six \nwere Haji Kadir, Haji Salim, Tok Kasim, Lazim, Kamil, and Cik Mah, who between them cultivate nearly 100 relong. \nThey claimed in their defense that they had pressed for a firm commitment for a transplanting date from their local \nshare group and, only after being put off again, had they moved. At this point, the boycott collapsed. Each of the three \nshare groups was faced with defections, as women feared that the transplanting work would be permanently lost to \noutsiders. They hastily sent word that they would begin transplanting the land in question within the next few days. \nThree of the six farmers canceled their arrangements with the outside gangs, while the other three went ahead either \nbecause they felt it was too late to cancel or because they wished to teach the women a lesson. Transplanters came from \nthe town of Yan (just outside the irrigation scheme) and from Singkir and Merbuk, farther away. Haji Salim, using his \nconsiderable political influence, arranged with MADA to bring in a gang of Thai transplantersa practice he has \ncontinued and for which he is bitterly resented.\nThe brief and abortive attempt to stop the combine by collective action was\n15. Not all farmers in Sedaka that season could be neatly classified either as combine hirers or share-group \nhirers, since at least four farmers had used the combine for one plot and hand labor for another. In two cases, \nthese were decisions based on the ripeness of the crops in each field when the combine was available or the \ninability of the machine to harvest a given plot (because it was on soft, waterlogged land or because it was \nsurrounded by plots or unripe paddy). In the remaining two cases, the decision was almost certainly an \nattempt by the farmer to hedge his bets and avoid the threatened boycott.\n  \n< previous page\npage_251\nnext page >\n",

Those with most to lose from mechanization realized that the women could not really move beyond talk and \nthreats. Thus, Wahid said that the rumored boycott was \"just talk and they planted anyway.\" \"What could they do?\" he \nasked, throwing up his hands. Tok Mahmud echoed this assessment: \"Other people took the work; once the work is \ngone they couldn't do anything.'' \"People are clever,\" Sukur added, \"If you don't want to transplant, they'll take the work \nand money.\" It is for this reason, Samad claimed, that the women were careful not to burn their bridges and only talked \nof a boycott well out of earshot (kot jauh saja) of large farmers. Finally, in the same vein, Hamzah summed up the long \nodds against the women:\nWhether you complain or don't complain, it's no use. You can't do anything; you can't win. If you say \nanything, they won't hire you to plant even. The women will even have to cut paddy for a farmer if the \ncombine breaks down. If you're hard up, you have to take the work. If you refuse (tolak), if you don't do it, \nothers will. Only those who are well-off (senang) can refuse.\nWe could ask for no clearer exposition of the \"dull compulsion of economic relations.\" The well-to-do were not only \naware of this \"dull compulsion\" but were counting on it. As Mat Isa noted, \"They didn't do anything; it was only idle \ntalk (mulut saja).\"16 Tok Kasim, whose stake in mechanization was higher because he was a machine broker as well as \na farmer, realized the boycott would never be carried out, since \"the poor have to work anyway; they can't hold out \n(tahan).\" And Lebai Hussein said that, although they were \"angry,\" the women could only talk about (sembang-\nsembang saja) a boycott, since they needed the money. He concluded with a Malay saying that precisely captured the \ndifficulties the women faced: \"Angry with their rice, they throw it out for the chickens to eat.\"17 The closest English \nequivalent is \"cutting off your nose to spite your face.\"\nIf we step back a few paces from our single village perspective, a wider and more melancholy pattern appears. The \nshare groups of women in Sedaka were, in this same period, occasionally hired to transplant paddy fields as much as \nthirty miles away. Rosni told me that once a woman from Setiti Batu, where their share groups was planting, had told \nher that the farmer for whom they were working had not been able to recruit local transplanters because he had\n16. He then concluded by saying padi tumpah, which, literally, means \"spilled paddy,\" but its idiomatic sense \nwould perhaps best be expressed by the English \"just chaff\" (as opposed to wheat).\n17.Marah sama nasi, tauk, bagi ayam makan.\n  \n< previous page\npage_252\nnext page >\n",

When she learned this, Rosni told the woman that she was \"sick at heart\" (sakit \nhati) but that the work was nearly finished anyway.18 It is only too likely that there were similar cases as well. Thus, \nfrom this wider perspective, the poorer women of Sedaka were inadvertently serving as \"strike-breakers\" in other Muda \nvillages. And women from these villages, or others like them, were undoubtedly coming to break the boycott in Sedaka. \nWhat we have here is a nearly classic example of the crippling effect of class action by peasants when it is confined, as \nit typically is, to one or a few villages in a much wider labor market.19\nSimilar attempts at a labor boycott occurred throughout much of the Muda region. An official at the state headquarters \nof MADA confided to me that he suspected most of the landlords, like Haji Salim, who applied there for permission to \nimport Thai transplanters were actually attempting to get around a local labor boycott. Inasmuch as they were invariably \nquite large-scale farmers, they were the ones most likely to have hired the combine at the first opportunity. Talk of a \nboycott was certainly very common. Thus Rosemary Barnard writes of a village near the state capital of Alor Setar in \nwhich (in 1978) there was \"talk of combining forces to attempt to block combine harvesters next season.\"20 In Sedaka \nitself I frequently heard the names of villages that had, it was claimed, kept the combine harvesters off their fields. \nLebai Pendek said that the village of Gelam Dua to the north still harvested all its local fields by hand. Kubang Jerai and \nother villages in the Bukit Raya district, a PAS stronghold, were often mentioned as places where the boycott and \nmachine breaking had prevented the combines from coming. Mansur said that in Kangkong, to the north, the poor were \n\"better organized\" (lagi teratur) and hand harvesting was still the rule.21\n18. The fact that the paddy field they were planting belonged to the brother of one of the women in the share \ngroup further complicated matters.\n19. This serves as a salutary reminder of the limitations of local or village studies that treat only local fragments of \nclass which stretch over wider areas and whose members are unknown personally to one another. A more accurate \nview of class would in fact include not only a spatial dimension but a temporal one as well, as the class of tenants \nas a concept must include those who have ever had this status in the past as well as those who are tenants today. \nThe spatial dimension of class by itself may, in this context, seem to argue for the role of an elite or intelligentsia \nto coordinate and unify its fragmented action. As we shall see later, this conclusion is not necessarily warranted.\n20. Rosemary Barnard, \"The Modernization of Agriculture in a Kedah Village, 19671978\" (Paper presented at \nSecond National Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia, University of New South Wales, \nSydney, May 1519, 1978), 33.\n21. The salaried head of the MADA branch office in Kepala Batas explicitly emphasized this when he explained to \nme why the attempted boycott had \"no effect\" (tak ada kesan) and added that the improvement in surfaced roads \nnow permitted large farmers to bring in labor from much farther away.\n  \n< previous page\npage_253\nnext page >\n",

The \nharvest workers and transplanters of Sedaka spoke of this community with something approaching awe, so I made a \npoint of visiting Permatang Buluh to see for myself. My companion that day was Amin, who had an uncle living there. \nThe uncle, who himself farmed over 10 relong, reported that he and most others now used combines and that the \nboycott had failed. It was only when I walked through the paddy fields unaccompanied that I heard a slightly different \naccount from a small tenant. He said that the \"poor\" in Permatang Buluh had, in fact, prevented the combine from \nharvesting paddy for three seasons, until 1978. When I asked how they had done it, he replied that the large farmers had \nbeen \"afraid.\" And when I asked why they were afraid, he simply said golok putih-putih, which might be translated as \n\"the machetes were gleaming (or very sharp).\" Perhaps sensing that he had already volunteered too much to a stranger, \nhe declined to elaborate, but it was clear from his remark that the threat of violence was a factor. Two other \ncharacteristics of Permatang Buluh may help account for its relative success in delaying mechanization. It appeared that \nthe village had more than the usual proportion of landless and smallholders who depended heavily on wages. The \nheadman of the village was also unusual in a way that might have facilitated solidarity among the poor. Although he \nwas born, like most headmen, into a well-to-do household, his father had lost nearly all his land through gambling debts \nand thus the present headman was himself a part-time harvest worker. Even with those particular ''advantages\" the \nsuccess of the Permatang Buluh had been short-lived.\nWhen the would-be boycotters and machine breakers of Sedaka spoke about their own experience or about the relative \nsuccess of others, what one heard was not just a litany of discouragement and despair. There was also more than just a \nglimmer of what might have been (or might be) if the poor had acted with more unity and force. Thus Samad saw \nPermatang Buluh as something of an inspiration: \"If we had done the same thing here, the machines wouldn't have \ncome. It would have been good (bagus) if we had, but we weren't organized (tak teratur).\"22 Rokiah herself spoke with \ndisdain of the share groups in Sedaka compared with Permatang Buluh: \"Here they didn't want {to carry it through}.\" \n\"If they had all agreed, if they had struck, {the machines} would not have been brave enough to come in.\"23 Mansur, \none of the few pure landless laborers in\n22.Teratur might in this context be translated also as \"disciplined.\"\n23.Kalau berpakat, kalau mogok, tak berani masuk.

Bakri bin Haji Wahab said that if such machines came the women would then \ncharge a dollar for uprooting each small bundle (cap) of seedlings from the nursery bed. \"It could become a war,\" he \nadded.24 Then Ishak more realistically pointed out that if the women charged M$1 for each bundle then others would \nagree to do it for 90 cents, others for 80 cents or 70 cents and that ''would be the end of it.\"\nAs the large farmers see it, the attempted boycott was \"all talk\"virtually a \"nonevent.\" There is something to this view, \ninasmuch as the boycott was never openly declared and collapsed without fanfare. The use of delays and barely \nplausible excuses meant that the intention to boycott itself could be disavowed. As the losers see it, however, it was an \neffort in the right direction that fell short. They are under no illusions about their own weak position or the obstacles in \ntheir path, but they do look to the modest successes elsewhere as something of a goad and inspiration.\n\"Routine\" Resistance\nThe attempt to halt combine-harvesting, while hardly the stuff of high drama, was at least out of the ordinarya new, if \nlargely futile, initiative. It took place against a rarely noticed background of routine resistance over wages, tenancy, \nrents, and the distribution of paddy that is a permanent feature of life in Sedaka and in any stratified agrarian setting. A \nclose examination of this realm of struggle exposes an implicit form of local trade unionism that is reinforced both by \nmutuality among the poor and by a considerable amount of theft and violence against property. Very little of this \nactivity, as we shall see, poses a fundamental threat to the basic structure of agrarian inequalities, either materially or \nsymbolically. What it does represent, however, is a constant process of testing and renegotiation of production relations \nbetween classes. On both sideslandlord-tenant, farmer-wage laborerthere is a never-ending attempt to seize each small \nadvantage and press it home, to probe the limits of the existing relationships, to see precisely what can be gotten away \nwith at the margin, and to include this margin as a part of an accepted, or at least tolerated, territorial claim. Over the \npast decade the flow of this frontier battle has, of course, rather consistently favored the fortunes of the large farmers \nand landlords. They have not only swallowed large pieces of the territory defended by wage workers and tenants, but in \ndoing so they have thereby reduced (through marginalization) the perim-\n24.Boleh jadi perang.\n  \n< previous page\npage_255\nnext page >\n",

Even along this reduced perimeter, however, there is constant pressure exerted \nby those who hope to regain at least a small patch of what they have grudgingly lost. The resisters require little explicit \ncoordination to conduct this struggle, for the simple imperative of making a tolerable living is enough to make them dig \nin their heels.\nMy goal here is only to convey something of the dimensions and conduct of this routine resistance, not its full extent, \nfor that could fill a volume in itself. Inasmuch as a great deal of this resistance concerns the disposition of the proceeds \nof paddy farming, the best place to begin is in the paddy field itself, with threshing.\nTrade Unionism without Trade Unions\nThreshers, unlike reapers, are hired and paid by the farmer as individuals. They work in pairs at a single threshing tub \nand then divide the piece-rate earnings at the end of the day. In 1979, the average piece-rate per gunny sack was M$2. \nThe piece-work organization of the work produces a conflict of interest between the thresher and the farmer whose \npaddy is being threshed. The farmer naturally wants all the rice from his field and, for that reason, prefers to have the \nthreshers beat each bundle of cut paddy until virtually all the grains are in the tub. The thresher, in contrast, is interested \nin the cash he can earn for a day's work.25 Depending on the ripeness of the paddy, roughly 8090 percent of the grains \nare dislodged in the first two or three strokes. To dislodge most of the remaining paddy may require as many as six or \nseven strokes. The tub fills up faster, and the thresher earns more for the day's work, if he beats each sheaf only two or \nthree times and moves quickly to the next sheaf.26 If he were to work in this fashion, he might thresh as many as ten \ngunny sacks (M$20) in a day, compared with, say, M$10 or M$12 if he were to thresh each sheaf thoroughly. The \ndifference is vital when one recalls that, for poor men, threshing is the best-paid work of the season, and there is a \npremium on making the most of it while it lasts. Nor does the conflict of interest between the thresher's wages and the \nfarmer's paddy end here. A thresher can, in fact, recover the paddy he has left on the stalks if there is someone in his \nfamily who gleans. The more paddy poor men leave lying beside the threshing tubs, the more paddy the women in\n25. This is especially the case if the season is a busy one and other threshing jobs are available when the \ncurrent one is finished. Frequently threshing work is in fact morning work rather than day-long work, since \nthe job is so physically demanding that the day begins at dawn and ends early in the afternoon. If the moon is \nbright, threshing is occasionally done in the evening to take advantage of the cool temperatures.\n26. There is also, to be sure, an element of competition among the threshers as well if we see each pair competing \nto thresh as much as possible of the paddy in a given field.\n  \n< previous page\npage_256\nnext page >\n",

This provides them with a further incentive to leave some behind.\nExpectations have of course developed concerning how many times each sheaf of paddy, depending on the variety and \nits ripeness, should be beaten. But these expectations require constant pressure and constant supervision to enforce. The \nfirst few times I threshed, I wondered why the farmer, even if he was relatively poor, did not thresh himself. After all, I \nreasoned, he could save as much as M$20 in wages he was paying to others. When I asked a farmer (Mat Isa) at the end \nof the day, he said that if he did not watch the threshers he would lose half his paddy. This was surely an exaggeration, \nbut it explains why most small farmers supervise their threshers rather than work themselves. As the laborers work, the \nfarmer circulates slowly and makes his presence felt. And when he is at the far corner of the field, when the matting \ninserted high around the tub to catch flying grains blocks his view, or when he is busy preparing a snack, the number of \ntimes each sheaf is beaten diminishes appreciably. The advantage to be gained is marginal and limited, since the \nfarmeror, as he is called in Malay, \"paddy owner\" (tuan padi)will notice how fast the tub fills, may casually check the \nthreshed sheaves, and in any event can always decide not to invite the worker back the following season.27 It has, I was \ntold, occasionally happened that a thresher whose work has displeased the farmer is told he will not be needed the next \nday, but this is extremely rare. The farmer also avoids, whenever possible, hiring a thresher who has many gleaners in \nhis household. Thus Mat \"halus,\" whose entire family does a prodigious amount of gleaning, is seldom if ever invited to \nthresh in Sedaka. Other poor men will occasionally send their wives or daughters to glean fields they have threshed, but \nthey are careful not to make a practice of it lest they jeopardize their employment.\nNow that there is considerably less threshing work available, the margin for such routine resistance has narrowed. It has \nnot, however, disappeared entirely. The actual number of times a sheaf of paddy is beaten is still a compromise between \nwhat the farmer would like and what he is able to enforcea compromise determined not only by the overall balance of \npower but by a daily, unremitting struggle in the paddy fields.\nAnother focus of routine resistance is the determination of the rates of pay for transplanting, reaping, and threshing. The \nscope for movement is relatively\n27. When a close relative of the farmer is threshing, a certain amount of this behavior is overlooked, and the \nrelative, if poor, may take full advantage of the leeway. A number of farmers have told me that they thus \nprefer to hire non-kinsmen (or, for that matter, to have non-kin tenants), since it is then easier to insist on \ncareful work. Kinsmen who are threshing, they add, make it that much easier for the other threshers to \nemulate their performance. Since it is difficult to deny relatives gleaning rights on one's land, that is another \nreason to avoid hiring them for threshing whenever possible.\n  \n< previous page\npage_257\nnext page >\n",

The share groups of women and the men who thresh are incredibly alert to \nnews that any farmer is paying even fractionally more than the rate for the previous season. As Rosni noted, \"once \nsomeone gets it {a higher wage}, the others will have to follow.\"28 What in fact is the going rate for given tasks is the \nobject of heated debate nearly every season, with the head of the share group quoting the highest rate she has heard of \n(or can plausibly invent) and the employer quoting the lowest in the same fashion. The workers are restrained by the \npossibility of losing the job to others and the farmer is restrained by his concern for having his crop transplanted or \nharvested in good time. So far as the laborers are concerned, the Chinese who farm in the area play a beneficial role in \nthis negotiating process inasmuch as they are the most likely to break ranks and pay more.29 It is fairly common to hear \ncomplaints by large farmers about how their workers lie and cheat (bohong, tipu), when it comes to quoting the going-\nrate. They keep their ears to the ground as well and attempt, whenever possible, to dispute a report of higher wages or to \nexplain it away by reference to special conditions (for example, deep water, or lodging, in the case of reaping and \nthreshing) that do not apply to their own fields. The advantage to be gained through these contesting representations of \nthe labor market may seem trivial but, for those at the margin, the possibility of a marginal gain is never trivial. What \nappears in Muda statistics as the seasonal \"labor market\"the average price for transplanting, reaping, and threshingis, at \nthe village level, the outcome of constant maneuvering.\nThe inroads made by mechanization now mean that much of the paddy gathered by hand comes from low-lying fields \nthat are waterlogged or from fields where wind and rain has caused the heavy panicles to lodge. Such special conditions \ncall, in principle, for special wages; precisely what those special wages should be is an arena of struggle. They way in \nwhich this struggle is conducted reveals the same elements of \"strike\" behavior and circumspection that we encountered \nin the resistance to combine harvesting. In the case of reaping, for example, the head of a share group, such as Rosni, \nwill typically look over the field in advance. Should the water be particularly deep or the paddy lodged (or both) she \nwill rarely ask the farmer directly for a higher price per relong. Instead she will \"let it be known\" (cara sembunyi tau) \nthat the reaping will take much longer than usual and that the rate should be considerably more than the standard (1979 \nmain season) of M$35. The farmer may \"reply\" in several ways: he may\n28.Satu kali dapat, lain kena turut.\n29. Whether this is due to their greater and more diversified wealth, or, more likely, to their desire as outsiders to \nbe absolutely certain of labor when they require it is uncertain, but they are looked to as the pace setters for wage \nrates.\n  \n< previous page\npage_258\nnext page >\n",

Unless the farmer's rate is clearly out of \nline and alternative work is available, however, the women will show up for work. Should the field conditions be as bad \nor worse than anticipated, they are likely to grumble openly as they cut the paddy, passing comments such as \"Your \npaddy is hard {work} {we're} losing {money}.\"30 This is a clear signal to the farmer that he is in danger of losing his \nwork force, and he often responds by indicating that he will raise the wage somewhat, though he rarely specifies by how \nmuch. If, on the other hand, he believes their claim unwarranted, he may simply remain silent, which is interpreted as a \nsign of refusal. In this case, the women are faced with a difficult choice; they can continue to work and grumble or they \ncan walk off the job.\nThe decision to walk off is not taken lightly, because the farmer may well switch to a different share group next season \nand because any loss of precious harvest income is a sacrifice. If the farmer has a generally good reputation for paying \nfair wages in the past, the women will probably continue to work while making their dissatisfaction known.31 But if the \nfarmer has a reputation for stinginess, the women will strike, as they do once or twice a year. The \"strike\" is not \nannounced, but everyone understands what is happening. Rather than leaving the fields directly, the women are more \nlikely not to return after the midday meal or on the following morning. The farmer will then typically send someone to \nthe share group leader to propose a modest increase in pay to end the strike. More rarely, the farmer may refuse to \nbudge and, if he does, he must recruit outside labor, since no village share group will agree to take the place of another, \nonce the work has begun.\nDisputes over reaping wages have become increasingly common as more farmers have turned to broadcasting. A paddy \nfield that has been broadcast-planted is a good deal harder to reap, owing to both the absence of orderly rows and to the \nmuch greater variation in the height of the mature stalks. Women have asked for, and gotten, wages as high as M$60 a \nrelong for reaping such fields, especially during the irrigated season when the fields are wet at harvest time.32 They are \nalso conscious that high reaping wages are a fitting retribution for those farmers who do not hire transplanters. As Rosni \nsaid privately when her\n30.Hang punya padi susah, rugi.\n31. The women's attitude is perhaps best captured by the English expression, \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool \nme twice, shame on me.\"\n32. Members of the share group frequently point out that both transplanting and reaping have become more time-\nconsuming since double-cropping because the density of plants per relong has increased appreciably. If \ntransplanting and reaping fees are higher than they were in 1969, the women claim that this only reflects inflation \nand the additional work required.\n  \n< previous page\npage_259\nnext page >\n",

This is an option only if the farmer's fields are \nout of phase with others, so that there is a surplus of idle labor at the time. Even then, however, many women in the \nshare groups will refuse to transplant or reap for kupang wages, as they understand that is another way of reducing their \nwage and breaking their rudimentary organization. It is too early to say whether large farmers will succeed in \nestablishing the kupang system as the norm for transplanting and reaping. What is clear, however, is that the resistance \nof poor women to kupang work is, thus far, a major factor impeding its adoption.\nConflict over piece-rates for threshing follow much the same pattern as for reaping. Under normal circumstances, those \nwho are threshing paddy can expect to thresh about four gunny sacks in a long morning; at the standard pay of M$2 per \nsack prevailing in the 197879 main season, the laborer would receive at least M$8. But if the paddy is wet or immature \nand the water deep, it may take an entire morning just to thresh one or two sacks. Open grumbling will inevitably begin, \nand the farmer understands that an adjustment is called for.33 He is under great pressure to make some concession, for \nany further delay in gathering and drying his crop will inevitably lead to its spoiling. Again, as with reaping, direct \ndemands are rarely presented, but the farmer is made to understand the implicit threat. If he makes, or promises, an \nadequate adjustmentas is typically the casethe work continues in an improved atmosphere. If he fails to raise the piece-\nrate, he may provoke a strike. Unlike the share groups, however, which strike as a unit, threshers walk out as \nindividuals, although pressure is brought to bear on those who would remain to join in the walkout. The irrigated season \nharvest of 1979 was an exceptional opportunity for village threshers in this respect, since heavy rains had caused \nwidespread lodging at the last moment, and a good part of the harvest had to be gathered by hand or not at all. Farmers \nwere desperate to save their paddy, and two such walkouts by threshers helped to establish a wage of M$3 per sack as \nthe minimum. In each case all the threshers agreed among themselves not to return the following morning and sent \nword that they were sick or had been called away\n33. Compare this with the description of Russian harvest workers' more explosive reaction to standard piece-\nrates when the crop had been beaten down by hail, thus requiring much longer to reap. The greater violence of \nthe labor gangs in this case seems particularly attributable to the fact that they were outsiders and strangers. \nTimothy Mixter, \"Of Grandfather Beaters and Fat-Heeled Pacifists: Perceptions of Agricultural Labor and \nHiring-Market Disturbances in Saratov, 18721905,\" Russian History/Histoire Russe 7, Pts.

Their unanimity helped to shield them against the possibility that the farmer would never \ninvite them back to thresh in subsequent seasons. Neither of the two farmers attempted to hire other villagers for the \nwork, as they knew none would come.34 One (Zaharuddin) thought of recruiting outsiders from his in-laws' village but \nquickly thought better of it when he learned they could not come for three days, during which he would lose most of his \nalready cut crop to the moisture. The threshers had thus seized a rather unique opportunity to press their claims. They \nand the reapers, however, continued to operate with circumspection, avoiding an open confrontation and strikes \nwhenever possible, since they knew that their future earnings depended on retaining a measure of goodwill between \nthem and their employers. Within these decorous limits they nevertheless carried on a struggle to protect their interests \nas wage earners.35\nImposed Mutuality\nIt would be apparent that even the modest forms of resistance mounted in Sedaka depend for their effect upon a certain \ndegree of mutuality among the poor. That is, the first, and minimal, requirement of class solidarity is a negative one: \nthat the poor at least refrain from undercutting one another and thereby further magnifying the considerable economic \npower of their employers and landlords. \"Otherwise,\" as Marx notes, \"they are on hostile terms with each other as \ncompetitors\"36surviving at one another's expense. The mutuality that exists can be seen in the refusal of other share \ngroups or threshers to act as strikebreakers in the village. It exists, as we shall see, in the vital realm of tenancy, where \nthose seeking land are unwilling to undercut their own neighbors. No extravagant claims can be made for this \nsanctioned self-restraint, inasmuch as it operates only within the confines of the village itself, and even in this context \nits operation is narrowly circumscribed.37 It does, however, prevent the most\n34. In this context, it is notable that there is only one man in the village, the \"adopted\" son of Haji Salim, \nAbdul Rahim, who could be considered a \"tied\" laborer working almost exclusively for one wealthy man. His \nposition is regarded with disdain by other poor villagers, who call him a \"slave\" (hamba), in part because he \nmust accept whatever terms his employer imposes.\n35. There is some indication that the threshers were less exacting when they were dealing with a relatively poor \nfarmer who enjoyed a reputation as a good man and more exacting when they were dealing with the rich and \nstingy.\n36.

Thus, for example, while a share group will not agree to replace its \"striking\" colleagues, it will accept work \nthe following season from a large farmer who wishes to hire a new group to replace those who gave him trouble \nthe previous season.\n  \n< previous page\npage_261\nnext page >\n",

Since the temptation to break ranks is always alluring to \nmembers of a class that has chronic difficulty making ends meet, these sanctions must be powerful enough to prevent an \never immanent Hobbesian struggle among the poor. The modest level of restraint that has been achieved makes ample \nuse of social sanctions such as gossip, character assassination, and public shunning. There is no surer way for poor men \nor women to call scorn upon themselves than to work at a lower wage than the prevailing rate or to take a job that \n\"belongs\" by custom to others. Nor is it merely a question of reputation, for the offender will find that he or she is \nshunned in labor exchange (derau), not included in share groups, not told about possibilities of finding work, denied the \npetty jobs that the poor can occasionally offer, and not invited to join \"rotating credit associations\" (kut) in their \nneighborhood. Each of these material sanctions, taken separately, is fairly trivial, but collectively they represent a \npotential loss of some magnitude. Nor is the threat of violence entirely absent from these sanctions, as we shall see. \nThus, the poor man who is tempted to break ranks must measure very carefully his short-term gain against the losses his \nangry neighbors may be able to impose. By their opinion and by their sanctions, the poor have erected a set of \ncustomary prohibitions that symbolize the acceptable limits of self-seeking.\nThese limits are best illustrated by examining the values that apply to the never-ending search for land by would-be \ntenants. Since access to land is so vital to the well-being of the poor, they are under constant temptation to pry land \naway from other poor families by agreeing to a higher rent. And yet, the sanctions against behaving in this way are such \nthat it happens very rarely. I often had occasion to ask poorer villagers why there were not more attempts to bid away \nland from local tenants by offering more for the privilege. Their replies are illuminating in their uniformity. They make \nclear that to do so would be an offense against another tenant. Thus, Yaakub said that such attempts are rare\n38. What prevails in Sedaka is a variant of what Alier has called \"union\" in Southern Spain. As he describes \nit, \"Labourers use the word union when trying to explain the existence of norms which make obligatoryor at \nleast commendableways of behaving which aim at maintaining or increasing wages, or at reducing \nunemployment. These ways of behaving are, on many occasions opposed to the individual workers interest, \nand they may even entail some risk or sacrifice.\" While such norms are occasionally violated, they appear to \nwork best in small villages. Thus a laborer told Alier, \"It is very rare to work for less than the prevailing wage, \nin this village, because it is small and people know each other. They do not do it; they would be badly looked \nupon.\" Alier, Labourers and Landowners in Southern Spain, 122, 136.\n  \n< previous page\npage_262\nnext page >\n",

Karim, who is always looking for land to \nrent, said that he would not try to bid away land, since he would feel \"embarrassed before his friend(s)\" (malu sama \nkawan). \"In our society (masyarakat kita), you can't do that,\" he added. Sukur and Jamil each used the identical phrase \nin explaining why such behavior was contemptible: \"You can't cut (potong) your friends.\" When Hamzah explained \nwhy it was not done, he focused on his sense of the decorum that should prevail among the poor: \"Our friends wouldn't \nagree to it; it wouldn't be seemly (tak elok) to scramble (berebut) like that.'' Even wealthier villagers recognize the force \nof these norms and are wary of breaking them. Amin thus noted that a landlord who promoted such a bidding war or a \npoor man who tried to displace another tenant in this way would \"not be respected (tak hormati). We are all friends; we \nare one village; he would feel guilty (hati-nya tak ada baik).\"\nThere are intimations by some villagers that the sanctions that restrain such self-seeeking may go well beyond the \nmatters of shame, reputation, and customary rules. Samad made it clear that any tenant who lost his land in this fashion \nwould be \"very angry and might do anything.\" Mat \"halus\" was a bit less cryptic when speaking of the offended tenant: \n\"You can't do that, he would be angry, he would look for his machete (cari golok).\"\nThe comments of Rokiah and Samat are especially noteworthy in this respect, not because they add very much to what \nhas already been reported, but because they provide the one unambiguous case in which the injunction against \ncompetition among tenants was broken. Samat explained that it was rare for a poor man to try to outbid the current \ntenant because, if he did, \"he would be accursed (jahanam) as far as we were concerned: you and I are finished {we \nwould say}.\" Rokiah's opinion was just as forceful: \"Someone who steals land like that would be despised (dengki).\" As \nit happens, rokiah has had a chance to act on her convictions. Until 1975, both Rokiah and Samat rented adjacent paddy \nfields from the same outside landlord: 4 relong were rented to Rokiah and a single relong to Samat. On the strength of \nthe fact that his mother-in-law had once owned all this land, Samat went to see the landlord before the 1975 off season \nbegan and, by offering M$20 more in rent, persuaded him to transfer an additional relong from Rokiah to him. Since \nthat day, no one in Rokiah's family has spoken to anyone in Samat's family or to his father, Tok Mahmud. It goes \nwithout saying that, although she is known to favor PAS, neither she nor anyone in her family has set foot in Samat's \nsmall store, which is a recognized PAS gathering place. In fact, some villagers claim, although Rokiah denies it, that she \nhas been responsible for an informal boycott of Samat's store by others, which may explain why it was on the verge of \nfailure during my stay.39 When Rokiah's daughter was married in 1980, Samat and Tok Mahmud told me that they were\n39. The shop finally failed and was closed the year after I left, when Samat could no longer get supplies on \ncredit, because of his outstanding debts.\n  \n< previous page\npage_263\nnext page >\n",

Rokiah claimed that she had, in fact, invited them but that \nthey were too embarrassed to put in an appearance. One sure way of finding out whether a given norm exists is to \nobserve what happens when it is violated. In this case, the episode involving Rokiah and Samat is the exception that \nproves the rule.40\nTo return to the rule for a moment, it should be made explicit that it does not prevent some forms of competition \nbetween tenants. Thus, if a landlord wants to raise the rent paid by his customary tenant to a point where the tenant is \nunwilling to continue, it is then permissible for others to ask for it under the new terms. It is also permissiblebut \nfrowned uponfor a would-be tenant to approach a landlord for land if the tenant he might displace is neither a fellow \nvillager nor a relative. Once again, as with the boycott of the combines, the restrictions of mutuality break down outside \nthe community, and their effect is partly undone by extra-village competition. What is not countenanced within the \nvillage, however, is for a poor man to take the initiative and attempt to \"steal\" a tenancy by proposing a higher rent.41\nWhat practical effect does the restraint the poor impose upon one another have? To the extent that the market for \ntenancies is still a rather localized affair, it is likely, along with kinship tenure, to impede slightly the landlord's efforts \nto extract the maximum possible rent. A good many agroeconomic studies of the Muda region have, in fact, remarked \nthat rent levels in general, even for non-kinship tenancies, are somewhat lower than a purely economic analysis would \npredict. The difference, while it is not large, is at least in part attributable to the small degree of local mutuality the poor \nhave managed to create. When it\n40. The rule in question is one of a larger category of rules that dominated classes typically develop to limit \ntheir exploitation. As Barrington Moore has noted, \"A challenge to the moral authority of precedent, to \naccustomed ways of behaving that subordinates have created to protect their own interests, vis-à-vis superiors \nas well as the integrity of their own social group, will generally produce a reaction of moral outrage. (That is \nalso true when the challenge comes from a member of the subordinate group itself, as in the case of the \nworker who is a rate-buster and exceeds informally set norms of output).\" Injustice, 3031. Samat is, in this \ncase, the agrarian equivalent of a \"rate-buster\" who has breached one of those petty but vital rules the poor \nhave fashioned to afford themselves some protection.\n41. The episode related in the previous chapter in which Tok Mah switched the tenancy for 3 relong from Lebai \nHussein and his son Taha to Pak Yah is an ambiguous one. It appears that Pak Yah approached Tok Mah for the \nland only after she had said that Lebai Hussein no longer wanted to rent it at her proposed new rent. Lebai Hussein \nand Taha made it clear that they did not hold Pak Yah at fault but rather their landlady, who chose to interpret their \ninitial grumbling over the new rent as an outright refusal. The norm is every bit as strong as the norm that tenants \nshould not try to undercut one another, and it is the former, not the latter, that was apparently violated in this \ninstance.\n  \n< previous page\npage_264\nnext page >\n",

The very \nlocalism of the mutuality is thus a more severe handicap in this sphere. Nevertheless, in small but significant ways, the \nmutuality of the poor represents a form of daily resistance that prevents, or at least delays, the worst consequences of \nthe full \"rationalization\" of production relations in the countryside.\nSelf-Help and/or Enforcement\nThus far I have dealt largely with attempts at collective actionwith \"sanctions\" that the poor bring to bear on their \nlandlords and employers, as well as on themselves, to prevent a \"dog-eat-dog\" competition. There is, however, another \nrealm of resistance that is more shadowy and individual; it includes a large variety of thefts and the murder of livestock. \nInquiry into this realm is a necessarily delicate affair, inasmuch as the silence of most of the participants is compounded \nby an understandable desire on the part of the inquirer to avoid danger. Without ever pursuing this matter actively, a \npattern of facts nevertheless emerged from casual listening over two years which suggested that such activities had \nimplications for class relations and resistance.\nRural theft by itself is unremarkable; it is a nearly permanent feature of agrarian life whenever and wherever the state \nand its agents are insufficient to control it. When such theft takes on the dimensions of a struggle in which property \nrights are contested, however, it becomes essential to any careful analysis of class relations. Such was certainly the case \nfor parts of England, where poaching was the most commonand the most popularcrime for at least two centuries, and in \nFrance, where Zola claimed without undue exaggeration that \"Every peasant had a poacher hidden inside him.\"42 Here \nthe political and class meaning of poaching was perfectly evident, since the peasantry had never fully accepted the \nproperty rights of those who claimed ownership of the forests, streams, \"wastes,\" and commons that had previously \nbeen the joint property of the community. Poaching was not simply a necessary subsistence option but an enactment of \nwhat was seen to be a natural right.43\n42. Emile Zola, The Earth, trans.

Older residents of Sedaka can recall a time not so \nvery long ago when the rustling of water buffalo was such a common occurrence that every man slept with a rope tied to \nhis wrist that led through the floor to his water buffalo's nose beneath to alert him in case rustlers approached. They can \nalso remember the names and exploits of the most famous rural bandits, such as Awang Poh, Saleh Tui, and Nayan, \nwho acquired reputations as \"social bandits,\" robbing from the rich and giving to the poor.44 At that time, settlements \nwere smaller and more scattered, and much uncleared brush and forest remained. This frontier quality of many Kedah \ndistricts, the weakness of rural police units, and the poverty and mobility of the peasantry all provided a hospitable \nenvironment for banditry and rustling.\nToday neither the physical terrain nor the freedom from pursuit provide anything like a favorable setting for bandits \nwith any large ambitions. All the land around Sedaka is flat and cultivated and the police in Kepala Batas and in Yan are \nfar more numerous, mobile, and well armed. Nor is there the class provocation of a mere one or two huge landowners, \nwho have monopolized virtually all of the land, facing a uniformly poor and united peasantry. The sort of theft one finds \nnow in Sedaka reflects all these conditions; it is carried out anonymously under cover of darkness; it appears to be the \nwork of individuals or, at most, pairs; it is what the police records would call \"petty larceny.\"\nAll kinds of things disappear regularly in Sedaka. Fruit regularly disappears from trees and around the houses of \nwealthier farmers, and few expect to harvest more than half of their small crop of mangoes, papayas, fallen coconuts, or \nbananas. Those who have the palms whose leaves are required for making mats, baskets, or the traditional attap roofing \nregularly complain that fronds frequently disappear. Those who keep small livestock, such as chickens, ducks, or geese, \ncomplain that both the eggs and the fowl themselves are regularly pilfered. During the dry season, when drinking water \nis sporadically delivered in government tank trucks, the villagers must leave their plastic or metal water cans (tong ayer) \nnear the main road to take advantage of unpredictable delivery. These containers, typically worth roughly M$5, are \noften stolen. On a somewhat larger scale there are occasional thefts of bicycles, water buffalo, and even motorcycles \n(three thefts in the last two years).\nThese petty, and not so petty, thefts have a pattern that is inscribed in the very social structure of the village. The targets \nare, with the possible exception of bicycles, the wealthier inhabitants of Sedaka. This is hardly surprising in view of the \nfact that it is the relatively well-to-do who are most likely to have the large house lot with fruit trees and palms, who \nhave the largest number of water\n44. See Cheah Boon Kheng's excellent account of Nayan and Saleh Tui in \"Social Banditry and Rural Crime \nin Kedah, 19101929: Historical and Folk Perceptions\" (Paper presented to Conference of International \nAssociation of Historians of Asia, Kuala Lumpur, 1980).\n  \n< previous page\npage_266\nnext page >\n",

The \nperpetrators, it is generally agreed, are to be found among Sedaka's poorer inhabitants. This pattern is not in itself proof \nthat such thefts are conceived by the poor as a means of resistance or some form of \"social banditry.\" Evidence on this \nscore was simply unobtainable. What is significant, however, is that the class character of theft is built into the very \nproperty relations prevailing in Sedaka. The rich, by and large, possess what is worth taking, while the poor have the \ngreatest incentive to take it. One is reminded of the reply of the American bank robber, \"Slick\" Willie Sutton, when he \nwas asked why he robbed banks: ''Because that's where the money is.\"\nApart from the disappearance of water buffalo and motorcycles, the other forms of pilfering we have encountered are \ndeplored by well-off villagers, but they are more of a nuisance than a serious threat. Their concern is focused on the \nmain product of this single-crop economy: paddy. For the would-be thief the advantages of stealing paddy are self-\nevident. It is all about him, it is easily taken in small quantities, and, once taken, it is virtually untraceable.\nThe amount of paddy stolen over a single season, while not large as a proportion of the total harvest, is alarming to large \nfarmers and, what is more, they believe that it is growing. No firm statistics are, of course, available, but I made an \neffort to record all the losses of paddy reported to me during the 197980 main season. By far the largest category of \nthefts was whole gunny sacks of threshed paddy left in the fields overnight during the harvest. These are listed in the \naccompanying table. To this total one must add paddy that was spirited away in other ways. At least four gunny sacks of \npaddy drying on mats in the sun disappeared, two of which were taken from Abu Hassan. Haji Jaafar and Kamil each \nlost a gunny sack that was stored beneath their respective houses.

How \nmuch is difficult to say, but the quantity is not substantial; villagers point out that the sound of threshing and the \ndisposal of the straw would present a problem for the thief, while the rich claim that thieves are too lazy actually to put \nthemselves to the trouble of threshing.46 Finally, a thorough accounting of paddy thefts would have to include some \nestimate of the grain that threshers are said to stuff in their pockets and inside their shirts at the end of the day's work. \nSuch pilfering is winked at by most farmers, and I have made no attempt to calculate how much paddy is appropriated \nin this way.\nCertain facts about the pattern of theft are worth noting. The first is that, with the exception of Samat and Fadzil, who \nare only modestly well-off, all of the victims are among the wealthiest third of Sedaka's households. This may indicate \nnothing more than the obvious fact that such households are likely to have more paddy lying in the field at harvest time \nand that smallholders, who can ill afford the loss, take pains to get threshed paddy to their house quickly. It is certainly \ntrue that large farmers with plots far from their houses that cannot be threshed (and hence stored) in a single day are the \nmost prone to such losses. But here again the observation made earlier still applies; the pattern of theft is an artifact of \nthe distribution of wealthin this case indicated by farm size. No one doubts either that poor men, local poor men at that, \nare responsible for the vast majority of the paddy thefts.\nThe total amount of paddy stolen, perhaps twenty to twenty-five gunny sacks, is less than one hundredth of the paddy \nharvested in a season by all village farmers. By this measure, the losses are fairly trivial and are borne largely by those \nwho produce a substantial surplus.47 If, however, we measure its significance by what it may add to the food supply of \na few of the poorest families in the village, then it may be quite significant. It is of some interest that these\n45. This is a crude estimate. Such paddy is stolen by prying apart the boards of the granary or by making a \nhole through which paddy can be collected. Although many farmers mark the level of paddy inside the \njelapang periodically, it is difficult to know precisely how much has been taken. As a rule, only well-off \nfarmers have such rice barns; the poor keep their paddy in a corner of the house. One such attempted theft was \nthwarted when Ishak was awakened by noise beneath his house and rushed down to find two abandoned pairs \nof slippers and two filled gunny sacks.\n46. A majority of the six or seven cases of this description that reached my ears were thefts from Chinese \nlandowners or tenants who lived outside the village. The problem of concealment and secret threshing would not \nbe so severe in such thefts.\n47. The 197879 main-season losses to theft were, from all reports, considerably greater than the thefts for the \nseason examined here. The reason for this, they suspect, is that the previous irrigated season had been canceled by \ndrought and the poor families in the village were more destitute than they had been since the beginning of double-\ncropping.\n  \n< previous page\npage_268\nnext page >\n",

The comparison is apt precisely because I twice heard poor men refer smilingly to \npaddy thefts (curian padi) as \"zakat peribadi that one takes on his own\" (zakat peribadi, angkat sindiri). This evidence \nis certainly not conclusive, but it is likely that some of the poor, at any rate, consider such acts as not so much theft as \nthe appropriation of what they feel entitled to by earlier customa kind of forcible poor tax to replace the gifts and wages \nthey no longer receive. In this connection, two other items of circumstantial evidence are relevant. Only one of the \nfarmers who lost paddy (Samat) was among those ever praised by the poor for their reluctance to hire the combine. All \nthe others have used the machine whenever possible. There is also some indication that paddy thefts may be used as a \nsanction by disgruntled laborers. Thus, Sukur once told me that farmers were careful to hire the threshers they had \ncustomarily invited, since anyone who was omitted might, in his anger, steal paddy from the fields. If, indeed, the theft \nof paddy has a certain element of popular justice to it, the scope for such resistance has been considerably narrowed by \nthe use of combines, which make it possible to gather and store (or sell) a farmer's entire crop in a single day. Combines \nthus not only eliminate hand reaping, hand threshing, in-field transport, and gleaning; they also eliminate theft.\nThe attitude of wealthy farmers toward such thefts is a combination of anger, as one might expect, and fear. Haji Kadir, \nfor example, was furious enough over his loss to consider spending the following night in the fields guarding his paddy \nwith his shotgun.48 He did not follow through, because he reasoned that the mere rumor that he might lie in wait would \nbe sufficient to deter any thief. The element of fear can be gauged, in part, by the fact that no police report of a paddy \ntheft has ever been made in Sedaka.49 Wealthy farmers explained to me that, if they made such a report and named a \nsuspect, word would get around quickly, and they feared that they would then become a target for more thefts. Haji \nKadir, in fact, once spied someone stealing a gunny sack at night from a neighbor's field. Not only did he fail to \nintervene to stop the theft, but he would not even inform his neighbor, though he was certain about the identity of the \nthief. When I asked him why, he replied that the thief had seen him too, would know he was the informer, and would \nsteal his paddy next. In an earlier season, Mat Sarif lost two gunny sacks but told me that he did not want to know who\n48. He is the only person in the village who owns a firearm. The use of firearms in Malaysia has been \nrigorously controlled since at least the time of the \"Emergency\" in the 1950s. When purchasing new \nammunition, for example, the owner must produce all the expended cartridges to prove that ammunition has \nnot been given to a third party.\n49. Such reports have been made elsewhere, but in each of the three cases I learned about the thefts were of three \ngunny sacks and more.\n  \n< previous page\npage_269\nnext page >\n",

Old and quite frail, he added simply, \"I'm afraid of being killed (takut mampus).\" For a handful of the more \ndaring village poor, it would appear that something of a small balance of terror has been struck that permits such limited \npilfering to continue.50\nThere is, however, a more subtle means of naming the suspect that amounts to a traditional form of \"letting it be \nknown\" (cara sembunyi tau). This consists of consulting one of the medicine men (bomoh) in the district who have \nacquired a reputation for finding lost property or identifying the thief.51 After learning the particulars, the bomoh will \nuse incantations (jampi) and conjure up the face of the thief in water prepared especially for the occasion. Not \nsurprisingly, the visage thus called forth is typically seen to be that of the man whom the client had all along suspected. \nIn the case of stolen paddy, the purpose is not so much to recover the paddy as to identify the thief. The farmer, when he \nreturns to the village, will tell his friends that the bomoh saw someone who looked like so-and-so. News will spread and \nthe suspected thief will learn that he is being watched, without a direct accusation, let alone a police report, ever having \nbeen made. Thus Haji Kadir said that the bomoh had, in his case, seen Taib and another unidentified man in the water. \nIf, indeed, Taib was the culprit, Haji Kadir hoped that this roundabout accusation would prevent any subsequent thefts \nfrom that quarter. On at least two occasions, however, villagers recall that some or all of the paddy taken has \nmysteriously reappeared after a bomoh has been consulted. The kind of circumspection employed by those few farmers \nwho actually resort to the bomoh is another indication that an open confrontation is considered dangerous.\nThe larger farmers in the village think they know who is to blame for most thefts. Three names are most frequently \nmentioned, always in guarded way that implies secrecy: Taib, Midon, and Dullah. The last of these three is the only \n\"certified\" thief in the village, having spent two months in prison for the theft of paddy from a household in nearby \nSungai Bujur. Five or six years ago, it\n50. Compare this with Georges Lefebvre's description of the sanctions of mauvais gré (ill will), by which \npoorer peasants enforced a continuation of a communal view of property. They evidently \"began with \nwarnings (grave dug in the front yard, bullet on the doorstep, unlit torch in the thatch, then if necessary \nresorted to more violent expressions of 'ill will' (animals crippled, crops devastated, barn burned) with the aim \nof driving off tenants who had consented to rent increases.\" Those familiar with Irish agrarian history will be \nstruck by the parallels. David Hunt, \"Charting the Peasant Route in the French Revolution\" (November 1982, \nmimeo.). Hunt is discussing Lefebvre's Les Paysans du nord pendant la révolution française (Paris: F. Rieder, \n1972), 93ff.\n51. In the classic Malay folktale called Pak Belalang, the bomoh has turned this trade into a lucrative racket. His \nsons steal villagers' water buffalo and tether them in the forest, and then Pak Belalang is paid by the anxious \nowners for his ability to discern where they are located.\n  \n< previous page\npage_270\nnext page >\n",

In this case the police were called and Dullah was \nconvicted. Neither of the other two have ever been caught red-handed but they know they are under suspicion. Razak \nhimself was once in the same category, but because of his bad health villagers say he is no longer up to the arduous \nwork of hauling full gunny sacks from the fields. All four men are, as we have seen, \"charter\" members of the \n\"undeserving,\" \"disreputable'' poor, so far as the rich farmers are concerned. They pay heavily for their reputation in \nterms of a kind of social and economic embargo: no one wants to rent them land; they are rarely invited to kenduri, they \nare seldom hired, they are never given loans, and they are typically denied any zakat peribadi. It is ironic, of course, \nthat, if the suspicions of the rich are correct, they appear to be helping themselves clandestinely to the zakat peribadi \nthey are openly denied.52\nThere is one final dimension to what may be termed clandestine and anonymous resistance in Sedaka. It finds \nexpression in the killing of small and, more rarely, large livestock by the poor. Most of the village's ragtag collection of \nchickens, ducks, geese, goats, water buffalo, and three beef cattle are owned by well-to-do households. They pose a \nconsiderable nuisance to the poor in many ways. Although barriers and chicken wire are often used to bar them, they \nfrequently forage into the nursery beds, paddy fields, and small gardens of the poor, doing considerable damage. The \npoor are, of course, not the only ones affected (the livestock have, as yet, no class loyalties themselves), but they are the \nones most deeply angered. Their anger does not merely stem from the fact that they can least afford the loss; it grows \nfrom something that might be called a \"moral economy of diet.\" What is at stake can be captured from Hamzah's \ncomplaints about Haji Kadir's chickens next door, which he frequently finds in his kitchen pecking rice through the \nsmall holes in the bags of rice stacked there. As Hamzah puts it, \"His meat is eating my rice.\" Once we recall that \nHamzah's family and many other poor families eat meat only when they are invited to a kenduri, the injustice is \npalpable. After a warning or two the recourse of the poor man is to kill the animal, as happens with some regularity. The \nfact that the animal is killed, not stolen, is an indication that this is a protest and not a theft.53 Two of Haji Kadir's goats \nbroke down the fence around Rokiah's small vegetable garden on the canal bund behind her house and ate everything \nexcept the watermelon. Her anger was put in nearly the same terms\n52. Recall in this context that the poor will occasionally refer to paddy thefts as zakat \"which one takes \noneself\" and that Fadzil, among the better-off villagers, has recognized the possible connection between the \ndecline of charity and theft.\n53. Chickens are stolen as well but not in cases like this. When they are stolen they must be sold, for the smell of \nchicken cooking in a poor man's compound would be a dead giveway.\n  \n< previous page\npage_271\nnext page >\n",

The \"murderer\" was never identified, \nbut that particular water buffalo had been infamous for breaking loose and grazing in the ripening paddy. Double-\ncropping has, in this context, made matters appreciably worse by eliminating the long, dry off-season when livestock \ncould roam the stubble without fear of damage. The fairly regular killing of livestock is, like the theft of grain, a petty \naffair that hardly touches the overall structure of property relations and power. But both of these acts of token resistance \nare among the few, relatively safe, methods of resistance open to peasants seeking to protect their hold on the means of \nsubsistence.55\nPrototype Resistance\nMy concern with the forms of resistance available to the poor has excluded any consideration of a host of conflicts and \nstrategies that have little or no direct bearing on local class relations. Thus, for example, I have not dealt with the many \ndisputes over water rights or with the ways in which land may be appropriated by moving boundary markers or by \ngradually shifting the bunds in one's field to add another row of paddy at the neighbor's expense. Nor have I examined \nthe resistance of the village as a whole to the Islamic tithe or to other government initiatives affecting all paddy farmers. \nThe resistance of the rich would itself make for a fascinating inquiry that could fill volumes. While I have described \nsome aspects of their resistance as it relates to wages, employment, and tenure, it takes many other forms that contribute \nto their domination of both local institutions and the local economy.56 Whatever place resistance in this larger sense \nmight justifiably occupy in a full account of social relations in Sedaka, it is marginal to my main objective.\nThe diverse forms of resistance by the poor that I have examined bear certain\n54. Not having been slaughtered by bleeding (sembelih) in the proper way, such animals cannot be eaten by \nMuslims even if they are discovered immediately after death.\n55. For a fascinating analysis of rural crime and disorder on a much larger, but still uncoordinated, scale, see Neil \nB. Weissman, \"Rural Crime in Tsarist Russia: The Question of Hooliganism, 19051914,\" Slavic Review 37, no. 2 \n(1978): 22840.\n56. The way in which the rich farmers are able to turn government policies and programsloan programs, the state \nfertilizer subsidy, development subsidies, school admissions, settlement scheme applications, small-business \nsubsidies, licenses for rice mills and taxis, government employmentto their advantage would constitute the core of \nany such analysis.\n  \n< previous page\npage_272\nnext page >\n",

Whether it is a matter of resistance to combine-harvesting, wage negotiations, the effort to prevent \nruinous competition among the poor, theft, or the murder of livestock, the relative absence of any open confrontation \nbetween classes is striking. Where resistance is collective, it is carefully circumspect; where it is an individual or small \ngroup attack on property, it is anonymous and usually nocturnal.57 By its calculated prudence and secrecy it preserves, \nfor the most part, the onstage theater of power that dominates public life in Sedaka. Any intention to storm the stage can \nbe disavowed and options are consciously kept open. Deference and conformity, though rarely cringing, continue to be \nthe public posture of the poor. For all that, however, one can clearly make out backstage a continuous testing of limits. \nAt the very least, one can say that there is much more here than simply consent, resignation, and deference.\nResistance in Sedaka has virtually nothing that one expects to find in the typical history of rural conflict. There are no \nriots, no demonstrations, no arson, no organized social banditry, no open violence. The resistance I have discovered is \nnot linked to any larger outside political movements, ideologies, or revolutionary cadres, although it is clear that similar \nstruggles have been occurring in virtually every village in the region. The sorts of activities found here require little \ncoordination, let alone political organization, though they might benefit from it. They are, in short, forms of struggle \nthat are almost entirely indigenous to the village sphere. Providing that we are careful about the use of the term, these \nactivities might appropriately be called primitive resistance, or perhaps ur resistance. The use of primitive does not \nimply, as Hobsbawm does, that they are somehow backward and destined to give way to more sophisticated ideologies \nand tactics.58 It implies only that such forms of resistance are the nearly permanent, continuous, daily strategies of \nsubordinate rural classes under difficult conditions. At times of crisis or momentous political change, they may be \ncomplemented by other forms of struggle that are more opportune. They are unlikely, however, to disappear altogether \nso long as the rural social structure remains exploitive and inequitable. They are the stubborn bedrock upon which other \nforms of resistance may grow, and they are likely to persist after such other forms have failed or produced, in turn, a \nnew pattern of inequity.\n57. For some interesting parallels, see Thompson, \"The Crime of Anonymity,\" in Albion's Fatal Tree, by Hay \net al., 255344.\n58. See E. J. Hobsbawm's Primitive Rebels: Studies in Archaic Forms of Social Movement in the 19th and 20th \nCenturies (New York: Norton, 1965). Hobsbawm's otherwise illuminating account is, I believe, burdened unduly \nwith a unilinear theory of lower-class history which anticipates that every primitive form of resistance will in due \ncourse be superseded by a more progressive form until a mature Marxist-Leninist vision is reached.\n  \n< previous page\npage_273\nnext page >\n",

One searches in vain for the \nmore depressing excesses of coercion found in much of the rest of Southeast Asia: mass arrests, liquidations, martial \nlaw, and paramilitary units with license to abduct and kill. The Malay peasantry, unlike the Indonesian peasantry, does \nnot live with the fearful memory of recent massacres that might intimidate them to utter silence.59 In the place of such \nlarge-scale brutality and morbid fear, there is instead the steady pressure of everyday repression backed by occasional \narrests, warnings, diligent police work, legal restrictions, and an Internal Security Act that allows for indefinite \npreventive detention and proscribes much political activity.\nIt is no simple matter to determine exactly how influential such repression is in constraining the forms of resistance we \nhave thus far observed. If the repression were to lighten or if it were to disappear altogether, it might be possible to \njudge, retrospectively, what its effect had been. Similarly, if the alternatives to resistancefor example, short-term wage \nwork in the citieswere suddenly to evaporate, it might become possible to gauge whether the existing level of repression \nwas sufficient to contain a more hard-pressed peasantry. In the absence of any such natural experiments, judgment must \nremain quite speculative. What we can show, however, is that the element of fear is present in the minds of many \nvillagers and that it structures their view of the options open to them.\nAn atmosphere of intimidation infects especially, but not exclusively, those villagers who are closely identified with the \nopposition party, PAS. Shortly after the 1978 elections, all PAS members were systematically dismissed from every \nvillage committee (JKK) in the state. This step not only set the stage for the denial of government benefits to all PAS \nmembers but also indicated that, henceforth, the opposition would have no legitimate role in community politics. In mid-\n1979 the Religious Affairs Office of Kedah took the further step of forbidding at least eight prominent PAS religious \nteachers, including Ustaz Fawzi from nearby Yan, from delivering sermons in any mosque or village madrasah in the \nstate. The general atmosphere was such that many PAS meetings in the district were held secretly from 1978 to 1980. \nOpposition members in Sedaka itself experienced this general intimidation as an ever-present possibility of arrest at the \nwhim of Bashir or other UMNO leaders. Thus a strong PAS member, Nizam bin Haji Lah, explains that he never goes \nto Bashir's store to buy anything because he is afraid that Bashir will claim he stole something and have him arrested. \nHe and other PAS members who haul paddy by motorcycle are always concerned that Bashir will arrange to have the \npolice stop them on the road and fine them for their unpaid road tax and insurance. Shahnon claims that he is\n59. See, for example, Ann Stoler, \"The Limits of Class Cosciousness in North Sumatra\" (Mimeo. 1979).\n  \n< previous page\npage_274\nnext page >\n",

When someone painted over the Village Improvement \nScheme sign board in the madrasah, the police were called the next morning and questioned several PAS members. No \narrests were made, but the visit had precisely the chilling effect the JKK desired. Tok Mahmud, as noted earlier, is \nafraid to tell me what he knows about machine breaking for fear of the police. To the particular fear of the JKK and the \npolice in Sedaka must be added the general suspicion that even the most seemingly innocuous activities of the state \narouse among the peasantry. This was evident when a petty official of the Information Department came to the village \nin February 1980 to prepare the way for the coming decennial census. Most of his talk was devoted to scolding villagers \nfor their false replies in the past and to reassuring them, in vain, that the census had nothing to do with taxes and that \nthey should not be afraid or run away. Thus, quite apart from specific fears, the classic peasant mistrust of the state \noperates to reinforce an atmosphere of apprehension.\nAn object lesson in the limits of permissible protest was provided by the government's reaction to a large demonstration \nheld in the state capital of Alor Setar on January 23, 1980. The origins and details of the protest need not detain us long, \nfor the purpose of this brief account is to focus on the fear created in its aftermath. The ostensible issue sparking the \ndemonstration was a demand for an increase in the farm-gate price of paddy and opposition to a recently introduced \ncupon scheme whereby M$2 of the price per pikul of paddy would be retained and saved for the seller. Although the \nforced savings would yield a profit (not \"interest,\" which is forbidden) and could be redeemed after six months, the \nscheme was almost universally unpopular. It appeared to many that the producer price had thereby been lowered by M\n$2, and it was unclear whether the majority of growers who sold their paddy to Chinese middlemen would recover the \n\"savings\" at all.60 The fact that the chief minister of Kedah had campaigned on a promise of raising the paddy price and \nthat the UMNO-dominated Farmers' Associations had themselves opposed the cupon system added a certain legitimacy \nto the discontent. At any rate, a crowd of roughly ten thousand gathered in front of the state office building on January \n23 to protest the cupon system and to demand a M$10 increase in the paddy price.61 When the chief minister finally\n60. As of that date, only 11 percent of the paddy produced in Kedah was sold directly to the state grain agency \n(LPN). Most of the rest was sold to private dealers and much of that was sold not for cash but to pay off \naccumulated debts at the shop of the paddy dealer.\n61. This summary description is based on accounts of villagers in Sedaka, four of whom attended the \ndemonstration (pertunjukan perasaan), officials of MADA near Alor Setar, and newspaper accounts in Utusan \nMalaysia, Berita Harian, The Star, and the Straits Times for the period.\n  \n< previous page\npage_275\nnext page >\n",

It \nwas, by all accounts, the largest demonstration by paddy cultivators held in Kedah since at least 1954, when thousands \nof farmers demonstrated for government relief after a disastrous season.\nOver ninety people were arrested on the spot and held. The chief minister immediately claimed that the demonstration \nwas \"provoked by certain groups of a militant persuasion\"62 and noted ominously that the Bolshevik, French, and \nIranian revolutions had all \"used\" the peasantry.63 In the weeks following the demonstration more arrests and charges \nwere made. Seven PAS officials in Kedah, including a state assemblyman, were arrested and detained. Three hundred \nspecial police officers were brought into Kedah to help with the investigation. The chief minister charged that \"the PAS \nstrategy of creating terror and fear is similar to that adopted by the communists and that the entire leadership of Kedah \nPAS must take responsibility for . . . organizing the demonstration.\"64 A shadowy underground organization sharing the \nsame initials as PAS (Pertubuhan Angkatan Sabilullah) and implying a \"holy war'' was identified as the center of the \nconspiracy.\nThe effects of the police roundups were felt immediately in Sedaka. As men in nearby villages were taken in to be \nquestioned, the word spread rapidly. Three men in neighboring Kepala Batas and one from Sungai Bujur were picked \nup, questioned, and released on bail. Well-known PAS members from Mengkuang, Guar Cempedak, Kampung Jawa, \nand villages in the Pendang and Bukit Raya areas suffered a similar fate. Most of them had not even attended the \ndemonstration. As news of continued arrests poured in, an understandable fear began to grip local PAS members, three \nof whom had actually gone to the demonstration.65 Taib, a PAS member, interpreted the government response as an \nattempt \"to smash us to pieces\" (pukul jahanam kita) and said that he wanted to get a sickle to defend himself.66 \nAnother PAS member, Sukur, spoke of \"spies\" (mata-mata gelap) in the village who might call the police and make \nfalse accusations. \"It's as if you didn't steal but they say you did; they can do anything, it is tyranny (aniaya).\" As it \nhappened, no one in Sedaka was detained or arrested.

The visits had their intended effect, as I suspect they did in countless other villages \non the rice plain. Many PAS members knew that a word from Bashir or the JKK could spell arrest and feared they \nwould be victimized. As Mustapha noted, \"Of course we're afraid; they want to crush (menindas) PAS.\"\nThe kinds of resistance and the kinds of compliance we find in Sedaka cannot be understood without reference to this \nlarger context of real and anticipated coercion. Routine repression does its work unobtrusively: an arrest here, a visit \nfrom the Special Branch there, an indirect warning from the head of the JKK are all that is normally needed to create \nboundary markers that no wary peasant would deliberately breach. The very existence of fairly stable boundaries of \npermissible dissent, however, makes this more a situation of fear than of terror, where there is no margin of safety. \nWhat is at least clear is that these boundariescreated, shifted, and occasionally reinforced by historical experienceserve \nto inhibit certain forms of open protest and defiance. Those who have benefited least from double-cropping have every \nreason to believe in \"the law of anticipated reactions\" and to avoid placing themselves in jeopardy. When they say, as \nthey have, that \"whether you complain or not it will come to nothing,\" they are referring not only to the local economic \npower of the large farmers but, beyond that, to the coercive power of the state and its local agents. The resignation this \nimplies is \"not an indigenous product of culture, but of the power situation in which the non-elite find themselves.\"67\nIt is against this background of larger constraints on resistance that the relative effectiveness of the \"dull compulsion of \neconomic relations\" must be understood. Wealthy farmers can still provide or withhold, at will, wage work in the paddy \nfields, zakat peribadi, government assistance (for example, employment, loans, subsidies), recommendations for \nsettlement schemes, aid to school children, loans, short-term credit (for example, at Bashir's shop), and can stand \nguarantor for credit in a crisis.68 It is little wonder that quite a few poor households should not wish openly to offend \nthose who control these strategic assets. But this potentially co-opting \"benevolence\" is inextricably linked with \nmalevolence. The\n67. John Gaventa, Power and Powerlessness, 145. Gaventa provides an interesting analysis of how the \nmiasma of repression and control can become \"self-sustaining,\" but in my view he never adequately addresses \nthe issue of \"false-consciousness.\" For a specifically Malaysian view that the quiescence among Malay \npeasants is rooted in culture and not in \"circumstances,\" see Chandra Muzaffar, Protector?

The occasional benevolence of the wealthy \nfarmers thus is not so very different from a protection racket. And, to the extent that it works, it works precisely because \nthe larger coercive context of rural class relations all but excludes the kinds of direct resistance that might materially \nchange the situation of the poor. That is, the coercive context creates and maintains the setting of relative powerlessness \nwithin which \"the dull compulsion of economic relations\" can then extract its daily toll.69\nRoutine Compliance and Resistance that Covers Its Tracks\nThe economic and political power of the wealthy farmers in Sedaka requires a certain minimum of public compliance \non the part of any prudent poor man or woman. For those who now leave regularly for work elsewhere and depend little \non help or wages within the village, that compliance can be minimal. But for those whose livelihood is more decisively \ntied to the village economy, the pressure for compliance is more pervasive. There is every reason for such men and \nwomen to conform to the stereotype of the \"respectable poor\" for the advantages that such a reputation can bring. The \nplace, then, to look for the symbolic \"taxes\" that this agrarian system can extract is particularly among those who most \nclosely approximate the stereotype. Even here we will find routines of deference and compliance which, while perhaps \nnot entirely cynical, are certainly calculating.\nWe have had an opportunity to hear Pak Yah's views of the UMNO leadership (\"They want to bury us\") and of the \nattitude of the village rich (\"As they see it, those who are hard up are despicable\") when he is among friends. Pak Yah, \nhowever, is not always in such secure company. Much of the wage labor he manages to find comes from Bashir, the \nleader of those who \"want to bury us.\" In his relations with Bashir, he is the very model of the deferential worker: \nreliable, never questioning the wages, never refusing any work. Even at the\n69. Perry Anderson, in a discussion of the relationship between consent and coercion, has resorted to an \nanalogy that is appropriate here. Paper currency, he writes, is backed by gold and circulates because of that \nbacking, but in normal times the gold is invisible. Only in a crisis does paper currency collapse and give way \nto a rush to gold. Consent, like paper money, prevails ordinarily, but it prevails because it is \"constituted by a \nsilent, absent force which gives . . . {it} currency: the monopoly of legitimate violence by the State. . . . \nDeprived of this, the system of cultural control would be instantly fragile, since limits of possible action \nagainst it would disappear.\" \"The Antinomies of Antonio Gramsci,\" New Left Review 100 (1976): 43.\n  \n< previous page\npage_278\nnext page >\n",

A due regard for his livelihood requires a public comportment that is not in \nkeeping with his private views.\nThe public behavior of Hamzah, another \"reputable\" poor man, is, if anything, a more delicate affair. He works fairly \nregularly for Haji Kadir and for Bashir, although they are political enemies. Perhaps because, as a next-door neighbor, I \ngot to know him quite well, he was disarmingly frank about why he, unlike most PAS members, received RPK \nassistance through Bashir and the JKK. He said he was favored because he was poor, because he worked for Bashir and \nnever complained, because he looked after the madrasah, and because he did not \"pay any attention\" (tak peduli) to \npolitical parties. He added that he bought goods from both stores in the village and went to everyone's kenduri when \ninvited. Hamzah then actually went on to tick off the benefits that his tact and circumspection had secured for him. \nBefore the last Ramadan when he was sick and could not work, he got twenty gantangs of rice, while Razak, his \nbrother, got only five or six; he was given more zakat peribadi than most others; he had a line of credit up to M$60 at \nBashir's store; he got scarce jobs when others could not find work; and when he was sick at home recently many \nvillagers stopped by and offered to help. Listening to him one had the impression of hearing an accountant self-\nconsciously adding up the profits of his investment in deference and pleased with the results for the fiscal year. He is \naware that Bashir and the others know he leans toward PAS, but he adds that he is not an active PAS member because \n\"If I were a strong PAS member, UMNO people would not want to hire me.\" Thus Hamzah's comportment is a \ndelicately balanced tightrope walk designed to bring him and his family safely through the inevitable economic crises. \nThis does not mean that he does not experience anger and indignation, only that he is careful to control it for his own \ngood. Here it is worth recalling again what he had to say when I asked him if he had complained when Haji Kadir \nunderpaid him for filling gunny sacks with paddy from the machine: \"Poor people can't {complain} when I'm sick or \nneed work, I may have to ask him again.\" \"I am angry in my heart.'' There is no false-consciousness here but just the \nnecessary daily pose of a poor man. Hamzah has no difficulty recognizing when he has been exploited or shabbily \ntreated; his effort and his achievement, in one sense, have been to swallow his anger lest it endanger his livelihood.70\n70. Robert Coles makes much the same point about American blacks when he writes, \"Until now nonviolent \naction has come naturally to Negroes because the only alternative has been to turn their suffering on \nthemselves, converting it to sullen despair. Negroes are not now becoming angry. At some levels of the mind, \nthat are out of both the white man's sight and often enough his own, the Negro has always been angry.\" \nChildren of Crisis: A Study of Courage and Fear (Boston: Little Brown, 1967), 322, emphasis in original.\n  \n< previous page\npage_279\nnext page >\n",

Seen in this way, \nthe poor imposed upon the rich some of the duties and functions of paternalism just as much as deference was \nin turn imposed upon them.71\nThe needs of the poor may also drive them actively to cultivate a rich farmer. Thus when Hamzah fell ill and could no \nlonger work for Haji Kadir, Taib began to appear regularly at Haji Kadir's house in the evening to chat. When I casually \nasked Shahnon why Taib, who had never come before, was always dropping in, he explained that Taib was coming to \n\"chat up\"72 and to flatter (jek) Haji Kadir in the hope of being given work. The strategy was successful, although it \nmust have required a certain amount of willpower on Taib's part, given the comments I had heard him make about Haji \nKadir in other contexts.73\nThe element of self-protecting compliance is most apparent in the choice of party made by a good many poor villagers. \nMansur, another \"good\" poor man, is a member of UMNO, as is the man for whom he often works, Shamsul. When \nMansur explains why, as a comparative newcomer to the village, he joined UMNO, he does not conceal the \nstraightforward calculation of possible benefits:\nI keep in mind that I am a poor man. I figure this way: If I enter UMNO I can latch on to work from a rich \nman. I can take wage work from him. If I enter on the side of the poor, they can't call me for work. I have to \nlook after my own household. Because of that I'm friendly with everyone.74\nOne could scarcely imagine a less sentimental account of the logic behind a choice of parties; it is also a formula for \nswitching parties, if the logic of advantage were reversed.\nTwo recent political \"conversions\" will help to illustrate the calculations that\n71.

The verb sembang can be a transitive verb meaning \"to chat up someone.\"\n73. The success was totally unexpected on my part, since Haji Kadir had clearly implied that Taib had been \nresponsible for thefts of his rice. It crossed my mind that Taib was applying his own version of a protection racket \nhere, but there is no way to verify that possibility.\n74.Saya ingat, saya orang susah.

Dzulkifli bin Haji Wahab comes from a strong PAS family in another village but \ndecided, in 1979, to convert to UMNO. When I asked why he shifted, he replied that \"It was a little better in UMNO; \nthere is development,\" by which he means government subsidies. \"PAS,\" he adds, \"can't do anything.\" In his case, he \nwas rewarded by a small grant (M$200) from the RPK program, while his brother Bakri next door, who remains in \nPAS, got nothing. Karim is another recent \"turncoat.'' He explains to me that if he stayed in PAS \"it would be hard to \nask for assistance (bantuan)\" and \"difficult to go see the primary school principal\" {about a special subsidy from school \nfunds for his children}. He left PAS, he said, because \"there were no services (jasa)\" while UMNO provides \"many \nservices.\" And yet, Karim may be playing a double game, since Sukur and Haji Kadir claim that Karim still votes for \nPAS, although he has paid his UMNO dues. \"He's clever,\" Haji Kadir concludes, \"he really follows us.\" Whether or not \nthis is the case is unclear, and Karim is not about to clear up the confusion. What is certain, however, is that it is quite \nplausible to anyone in Sedaka that a poor man, especially, might wish to dissimulate about his party affiliation in order \nto claim the benefits that nominal membership in the government party can provide. Rokiah and Hamzah have already \ndone so to their advantage.\nMuch the same logic of power and benefits prevail when ordinary UMNO members say they merely want to be on \"the \nmajority side\" or that they \"want benefits\" by joining UMNO. Quite a few imply that the safest course is to be with the \ngovernment partya reasoning that combines the promise of benefits with a certain element of fear. Thus Abdul Rahman \nexplained his UMNO membership by saying \"I notice {who has} the power (kuasa) every day I live under the hand of \nthe Raja.\" Not more than six or seven villagers, most of them members of the JKK, even bother to refer to any public-\nspirited reasons for siding with UMNO.\nThe pressures for deference, compliance, and political conformity in Sedaka are palpable and self-evident to all \nconcerned. In view of the rewards of compliance, it is little wonder that quite a few villagers have chosen to live up to \nthe stereotype of the \"reputable poor.\" What is perhaps more surprising is that so many others have held themselves \nrather aloof and distant, remaining in PAS, rarely currying favor with the JKK or rich farmers and, in some cases, \nbecoming examples of the \"disreputable\" poor. Even for those who comply, however, the compliance is routine in the \nsense that it is calculating and without illusions.\nIn this respect, there is a striking analogy between routine compliance and routine resistance. If routine compliance is \nconducted with a calculating eye to the structure of power and rewards in the village, so is routine resistance. If routine \ncompliance avoids unnecessary risks, so does routine resistance. Nearly all the resistance we have encountered in \nSedaka is the kind of resistance that rather effectively \"covers its own tracks.\" A snub on the village path can be excused \nlater by haste or inattention.

And, of course, acts of theft, \nsabotage, and vandalism have no authors at all. Thus, while there is a fair amount of resistance in Sedaka, there are \nvirtually no publicly announced resisters or troublemakers.\nEven the more purely symbolic resistancemalicious gossip, character assassination, nicknames, rumorswe have \nexamined follows the same pattern.75 Gossip, after all, is almost by definition a story told about an absent third party; \nonce launched, it becomes an anonymous tale with no author but many retailers. Although it is by no means a respecter \nof persons, malicious gossip is a respecter of the larger normative order within which it operates. Behind every piece of \ngossip that is not merely news is an implicit statement of a rule or norm that has been broken. It is in fact only the \nviolation of expected behavior that makes an event worth gossiping about. The rule or norm in question is often only \nformulated or brought to consciousness by the violation itself. Deviance, in this sense, defines what is normal. Thus, no \none may pay attention to the prevailing code of dress until it is breached and thereby provokes a statement of what is \nproper.76 Rules of grammar, only implicitly known, pass unnoticed until a speaker or writer makes an obvious misstep. \nMuch of the gossip and character assassination that are relevant to class relations in Sedaka are an appeal by the poor to \nnorms of tenancy, generosity, charity, employment, and feasts that were taken for granted before double-cropping. At \nthe same time that a reputation is slandered by gossip, a rule that was once generally accepted is being affirmed and \npromoted. Gossip is never \"disinterested\"; it is a partisan effort (by class, faction, family) to advance its claims and \ninterests against those of others. But this manipulation of the rules can only be successful to the extent that an appeal is \nmade to standards of conduct that are generally accepted. Gossip thus accomplishes its malicious work as an admittedly \nweak social sanction by remaining more or less within the established normative framework. In this respect the use of \ngossip by the poor also manifests a kind of prudence and respect, however manipulative, of its own.\nAs a form of resistance, then, gossip is a kind of democratic \"voice\" in conditions where power and possible repression \nmake open acts of disrespect dangerous. The rich, of course, are far freer to show openly their contempt for the \n\"undeserving poor.\" For the poor, however, gossip achieves the expression of opinion, of contempt, of disapproval \nwhile minimizing the risks of identification and reprisal. Malicious gossip symbolically chips away at the reputations of \nthe rich in Sedaka in the same fashion that anonymous thefts in the night materially chip away at the property of the \nrich. The overall impact on the structure of power of this nibbling away is not very appreciable. But it is one of the few\n75. I am indebted here to the discussion of gossip in John Beard Haviland, Gossip, Reputation, and \nKnowledge in Zinacantan (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1977).\n76.

By steering clear of any direct and open attacksymbolic or materialthe elite-controlled pattern of public \ninteraction continues to prevail. One may appreciate the importance of the domination of onstage behavior merely by \nimagining the tumult that would certainly have ensued if those who attempted an unannounced boycott had openly and \npublicly committed themselves to that course of action or if those who privately denounced the abuses of the Village \nImprovement Scheme had openly denounced the JKK at a village meeting. That the poor chose not to burn their bridges \nis altogether understandable, but their prudence preserves a surface decorum that serves the symbolic interests of the \nwealthy. Appearances are important77 and, as Bourdieu has aptly noted, \"The concessions of politeness always contain \npolitical concessions.\"78\nThe symbolic \"dues\" that the poor thus pay to the officially constituted village order is, however, not simply a reaction \nof fear and self-preservation. When, for example, poor men approach richer villagers with an eye to securing land to \nrent, work, a loan, or charity, they typically proceed very indirectly, so that the question is actually posed only after a \nfavorable reply is virtually assured. If the response is likely to be negative, the line of inquiry is quietly dropped. In this \nway, the possibility of a decisive and humiliating rebuff is avoided. What is also avoided, however, is the opening that a \ndirect question would provide for the wealthy party to repudiate the legitimacy of the request itself. Since the poor, as \nwe have seen, find themselves defending the justice of older principles of assistance (tolong), it is in their interest to \navoid creating situations in which these principles could be publicly and finally renounced.79\n77. The decisive rupture of appearances can, in many contexts, amount to a declaration of war. Three brief \nexamples from other settings are instructive. One of the most effective and inflammatory techniques used by \nopponents of Indira Ghandhi in the last general elections before her death was for thousands of her opponents \nin an audience silently to turn their backs to her when she began to address the crowd. In Java, during the \n1965 massacres of alleged communists, it is reported that peasant women occasionally lined the roads as \ntrucks carrying soldiers and their squads of civilian supporters passed and, in a gesture of total contempt, \nlifted their sarongs to display their backsides. Not a few of them paid for their gesture with their lives. In \nLodz, Poland, following the declaration of martial law and the outlawing of Solidarity, thousands of angry \ncitizens showed their contempt for the government television news broadcast by placing their television in the \nwindow, with the screen facing outside, at precisely 7:30 P.M. when the official news began.\n78.

The shift in the relations of paddy \nproduction that has eroded the value of poor households as suppliers of tenants and laborers has, at the same time, made \ntheir opinions count for less. More and more of the rich can now safely ignore what poor villagers think of them, as they \nare increasingly beyond the reach of social sanctions no longer reinforced by economic power. In this respect, the \n\"politics of reputation\" has lost much of its force as a weapon of the poor. It is almost as if part of the social arsenal of \nthe poor consisted of outmoded weapons which, however useful they may have been before double-cropping, are now \nless suitable to the unfavorable new terrain on which they are fighting.\nConformity and the Partial Transcript\nThe poor of Sedaka nearly always adopt a protective disguise in their relations with more powerful villagers or \noutsiders. This disguise is apparent both in their conformity and in their resistance. Thus, Hamzah conceals his anger \nwhen he is underpaid by Haji Kadir but, in the privacy of his home, vents his anger at being unfairly treated. Thus, Pak \nYah goes dutifully to Bashir's feast though he is seething with anger at having been excluded from the Village \nImprovement subsidy. An attempted boycott of machine users is presented as a delay in transplanting, which can be \nabandoned and disavowed. What amounts to a strike over threshing wages is conducted as if the workers had either \nbeen taken ill or had suddenly remembered prior commitments. The \"full transcript\" of class relations in Sedaka is \nsimply not ascertainable from the public interaction between rich and poor, powerful and weak. To move beyond the \ndomain in which poses and dissimulation prevail, it has in fact been necessary to talk to the poor alone or in small \ngroups where they are among friends. Only then does one encounter that part of the full transcript that would, if openly \ndeclared in other contexts, jeopardize their livelihood.\nThat the poor should dissemble in the face of power is hardly an occasion for surprise. Dissimulation is the \ncharacteristic and necessary pose of subordinate classes everywhere most of the timea fact that makes those rare and \nthreatening moments when the pose is abandoned all the more remarkable. No close account of the life of subordinate \nclasses can fail to distinguish between what is said \"backstage\" and what may be safely declared openly. One of the \nmore remarkable oral histories ever collected, that of the French tenant farmer 'Old Tiennon,' who lived from 1823 until \nthe beginning of the twentieth century, is literally filled with accounts of swallowed bile.80 Throughout his daily \nencounters with land-\n80.

He was absolutely ignorant of \nthe art of dissimulation, so necessary in life.82\nIt is probably just this necessary \"art of dissimulation\" that has been largely responsible for much of the conservative \nhistoriography of the peasantry. As the sources are almost invariably created by classes above the peasantry, they are \nlikely, quite apart from ideological intent, to see only that cautious and deferential aspect the peasantry adopts in the \npresence of power. What they may describe on this basis is not false, but it is at best a partial and misleading truth that \ntakes a necessary pose for the whole reality. When that happens, we get a picture of rural society that is distorted in the \nway that E. P. Thompson described for eighteenth-century England:\nOn the surface all is consensus, deference, accommodation; the dependents petition abjectly for favor; every \nhind is touching his forelock; not a word against the illustrious House of Hanover or the Glorious Constitution \nbreaks the agreeable waters of illusion. Then, from an anonymous or obscure level, there leaps to view for a \nmoment violent Jacobite or levelling abuse. We should take neither the obeisances nor the imprecations as \nindications of final truth; both could flow from the same mind, as circumstance and calculation of advantage \nallowed.83\nEven so close an observer as Zola was led in this fashion to a view of the peasantry as a class that oscillated between \nabject, unquestioning deference and violent outrage. What is missing is the massive middle ground, in which conformity \nis often a self-conscious strategy and resistance is a carefuly hedged affair that avoids all-or-nothing confrontations. Had \nZola taken a closer look at deference, he might have noticed what has become almost the leitmotif of modern studies of \nslavery: the gap between the beliefs and values that might find expression in the safety of the slave quarters and the \ntypically prudent conduct of these same\n81.

Allowing always for the exceptional moments of uncontrolled anger or \ndesperation, the normal tendency will be for the dependent individual to reveal only that part of his or her full transcript \nin encounters with the powerful that it is both safe and appropriate to reveal. What is safe and appropriate is of course \ndefined rather unilaterally by the powerful. The greater the disparity in power between the two parties, the greater the \nproportion of the full transcript that is likely to be concealed.86\nThus it might be possible to think of a continuum of situations ranging from the free dialogue between equals that is \nclose to what Habermas has called the \"ideal speech situation\"87 all the way to the concentration camp in which most of \nthe victims' transcript is driven underground, leaving only a virtual parody of stereotyped, stilted deference born of \nmortal fear. In fact, in the most extreme situations of Caligulan terror, where there are no rules of what is permissible,\n84. See, for example, Lawrence W. Levine, Black Culture and Black Consciousness (New York: Oxford \nUniv. Press, 1977); Genovese, Roll, Jordan, Roll; and Gerald W. Mullin, Flight and Rebellion: Slave \nResistance in Eighteenth-Century Virginia (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1972).\n85. Howard Newby, \"The Deferential Dialectic,\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 17, no. 2 (April \n1975): 146.\n86. Some qualifications should be noted here. In situations where power is balanced but each party can do \nconsiderable damage to the other, much of the full transcript will also be concealed. Superpowers, each of which \ncan destroy the other, play their cards very close to the vest. Thus, unhindered communication may be most likely \nbetween two actors who are not only equal in power but who cannot appreciably affect each other with their \npower. The rule is also less applicable to situations where the exercise of power is firmly institutionalized and law \nregarding. In such cases the weaker party may not be so constrained to conceal those parts of his transcript that fall \nclearly outside the defined domain of power. Finally, one may also wish to exclude from this rule situations of \nnormally benevolent power such as a parent-child relationship. The secure knowledge that the parent will act in \nthe child's interest may permit the child to reveal his or her full transcript without fear of victimization. In the case \nof unrequited love, however, the weaker party is led to conceal those parts of his or her transcript that are unlikely \nto win the love of the prized person.\n87.

Ranged in between these extremes are a host of more \ncommon conditions in which subordinate classes typically find themselves: the boss and the worker, the landlord and \nthe tenant, the lord and the serf, the master and the slave. In each case, the weaker party is unlikely to speak his or her \nmind; a part of the full transcript will be withheld in favor of a \"performance\" that is in keeping with the expectations of \nthe powerholder.88\nIf we wish to recover more than just the performance, we must move backstage where the mask can be lifted, at least in \npart. In the case of slaves this means moving from the \"big house\" to the slave quarters; in the case of the working class \nit may mean moving from the choreographed encounters between rich and poor to the relative privacy of the house or \nthe company of a few close companions. It is in these \"non-mask\" situations where some of what is habitually censored \nfinally leaps to view. Much of this material, as we have seen, is in direct and stark contradiction to what takes place in \nthe arena of power relations: Haji Kadir becomes Pak Ceti. The relationship between this non-mask, or backstage, \ntranscript and the center stage transcript bears very directly on the issue of false-consciousness. Much of the \nethnographic material supporting the notion of ''mystification\" and \"ideological hegemony\" is, I suspect, simply the \nresult of assuming that the transcript from power-laden situations is the full transcript. Short of total institutions such as \nthe concentration camp, however, most subordinate classes can repair occasionally to a social setting that is not so \nconfining. To the extent that the transcript found here is markedly different from or else negates what is found in the \ncontext of power relations, the case for false-consciousness is weakened.89\n88. How much of the full transcript is withheld cannot be simply deduced from the labeling of the power \nrelationship. Different forms of slavery or serfdom, for example, are likely to vary considerably in this \nrespect. Within a given form of subordination, moreover, a particular individual, say a blacksmith-slave with \nscarce and valuable skills, may enjoy a greater relative autonomy. In addition, most forms of subordination \nmay permit a good deal of unconstrained communication in areas that are defined as neutral to the power \nrelationship. Finally, in a more speculative vein, it would seem that, where the power situation drives most of \nthe transcript of subordinates underground, the culture may often provide authorized ritual occasions when it \nis possible to break the rules. The Roman Saturnalia, the court jester, the Christian tradition of Carnival, the \nHindu Feast of Holi are all rituals that allow subordinates, momentarily, to turn the tables. See, along these \nlines, James C. Scott, \"Protest and Profanation: Agrarian Revolt and the Little Tradition,\" Theory and Society \n4, no. 1 (1977): 138, and 4, no. 2 (1977): 21146.\n89.

After all, they are freer, by virtue of their power, to speak their mind with relative impunity. Razak can be \nsafely and publicly insulted in a way that Haji Kadir or Bashir cannot be. And yet the powerful are also somewhat \nconstrained both by a due regard for their reputationa commodity of declining but real valueand by the desire to uphold \nthe \"theater\" of power. Thus they will excoriate many of the village poor in the privacy of their own homes but rarely to \ntheir face. This is also not surprising; the transcript of the factory manager speaking with his workers is different from \nthe transcript when he is in the safety of his own club; the transcript of the slave owner dealing with his slaves is \ndifferent from his unguarded remarks to other slaveholders over dinner. It is only when we compare the \"unedited\" \ntranscript of elites with the unedited transcript of subordinate classes that we uncover the extent of mutual dissimulation \nthat prevails in the context of power relations. In the usual day-to-day conduct of class relations, these unedited \ntranscripts are never in direct contact. Only at rare moments of historical crisis are these transcripts and the actions they \nimply brought into a direct confrontation. When they are, it is often assumed that there has come into being a new \nconsciousness, a new anger, a new ideology that has transformed class relations. It is far more likely, however, that this \nnew \"consciousness\" was already there in the unedited transcript and it is the situation that has changed in a way that \nallows or requires one or both parties to act on that basis.\nBoth the rich and poor in Sedaka are, of course, aware that what takes place in the domain of power relations is not the \nwhole story. They suspect and often know that a good portion of village discourse takes place behind their backs. Their \nknowledge is not, however, symmetrical. Here, at least, the poor have a slight advantageif we can call it thatin the realm \nof information. They know a good deal about what the rich think of them, as we have seen from their comments. Their \ngreater knowledge is due not only to the fact that the village elite is able to speak more freely, and disparagingly, of \nthem but also to the fact that it is simply more important and vital for the poor to keep their ear to the ground. The rich, \nby contrast, know less about the unedited transcript of the poor because the poor are more discreet and because the rich \ncan more easily afford not to listen. Knowing less, they are free to suspect the worst. What they do know is that they \ncannot easily penetrate behind the pose of dissimulation, though they sense that behind the public routines of deference \nand respect lie contempt and anger. They are in precisely the situation of the\n(footnote continued from previous page)\ntory. I do not, in this analysis, mean for a moment to imply that the anthropologist-outsider is privy to the \nentire concealed transcript of various villagers. While outsider status confers some advantages, it surely \nblocks access to other information. I was, for example, always aware that most villagers were rather reluctant \nto talk about healing and magical practices that they imagined I might regard as superstitions.\n  \n< previous page\npage_288\nnext page >\n",

It is perhaps for this reason that the most dominant elites have historically so often credited their \nunderclasses with all manner of malevolent powers and intentions emanating from the desire for revenge.91 The \nsituation in Sedaka is not so extreme, but its form is qualitatively similar. The village elites suspect the worst from the \npoor in terms of anonymous thefts, slander, ingratitude, and dissimulating. Their fear, however, has a real basis in the \nnature of local power relations.92\nWhat Is Resistance?\nWe have encountered a bewildering array of resistance and compliance within Sedaka. It is no simple matter to \ndetermine just where compliance ends and resistance begins, as the circumstances lead many of the poor to clothe their \nresistance in the public language of conformity. If one takes the dictionary definition of the verb to resist\"to exert \noneself so as to withstand or counteract the force or effect of . . .\"how is one to categorize the subtle mixture of outward \ncompliance and tentative resistance involved in the attempted boycott of combine-using farmers? So far as the public \nrecord is concerned, it never happened and yet, at another level, it was a labor strike, albeit one that failed. There are \nstill other problems. Can individual acts such as theft or the murder of livestock be considered resistance even though \nthey involve no collective action\n90. See, for example, chapter 2 of George Kelly, Hegel's Retreat from Eleusis (Princeton: Princeton Univ. \nPress, 1979); Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hegel's Dialectic (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press), 5474; and G. W. F. \nHegel, Phenomenology of the Spirit, trans. A. V. Miller, with analysis and foreword by J. N. Findlay (Oxford: \nClarendon, 1977), 11119, 52023.\n91. It is at least plausible that there is something of a guilty conscience at work here that knows the poor must \nresent their marginalization from the village's economic and social life. This interpretation is very much in keeping \nwith I. M. Lewis's analysis of possession by spirits among women and low-status men in a variety of cultures. In \nthe context of a low-caste cult among the Nayar in India, he concludes, \"Thus as so often elsewhere, from an \nobjective viewpoint, these spirits can be seen to function as a sort of 'conscience of the rich.' . . . Their malevolent \npower reflects the feelings of envy and resentment which people of high caste assume the less fortunate lower \ncastes must harbour in relation to their superiors.\" Ecstatic Religions: An Anthropological Study of Spirit \nPossession and Shamanism (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971), 115.\n92.

Can largely symbolic acts such as \nboycotting feasts or defaming reputations be called resistance, although they appear to make little or no dent in the \ndistribution of resources? Behind each of these queries is the prior question, \"What is resistance?\" More accurately \nstatedsince definitions are analytical tools and not ends in themselveswhat, for my purposes, can usefully be considered \nacts of resistance?\nAt a first approximation, I might claim that class resistance includes any act(s) by member(s) of a subordinate class that \nis or are intended either to mitigate or deny claims (for example, rents, taxes, prestige) made on that class by \nsuperordinate classes (for example, landlords, large farmers, the state) or to advance its own claims (for example, work, \nland, charity, respect) vis-à-vis those super-ordinate classes. While this definition, as we shall see, is not without \nproblems, it does have several advantages. It focuses on the material basis of class relations and class struggle. It allows \nfor both individual and collective acts of resistance. It does not exclude those forms of ideological resistance that \nchallenge the dominant definition of the situation and assert different standards of justice and equity. Finally, it focuses \non intentions rather than consequences, recognizing that many acts of resistance may fail to achieve their intended result.\nWhere there is strong evidence for the intention behind the act, the case for resistance is correspondingly strengthened. \nThus it is reasonably clear that the women in the share groups intended to deny machine users transplanting services and \nthereby force them to revert to hand harvesting. The mutuality among the poor that prevents them competing for \ntenancies is also clearly intended to prevent a scramble that would eventually harm all tenants. In each case, the \nintentions are not inferred directly from the action but rather from the explanations the participants give for their \nbehavior. For \"speech acts,\" such as character assassination or malicious gossip directed against wealthy villagers, the \nact and the intention are fused into one whole; the condemnations of the stingy rich have inscribed within them the \nintention to recall them to a different standard of conduct or, failing that, to destroy their social standing and influence.\nThe insistence that acts of resistance must be shown to be intended, however, creates enormous difficulties for a whole \nrealm of peasant activity which, in Sedaka and elsewhere, has often been considered resistance. Take, for example, the \nquestion of theft or pilferage. What are we to call the poor man in Sedaka who \"appropriates\" a gunny sack of paddy \nfrom a rich man's field: a thief, tout court, or a resister as well? What are we to call the act of a thresher who takes care \nto leave plenty of paddy on the stalks for his wife and children who will glean tomorrow: an act of petty pilfering or an \nact of resistance? There are two problems here. The first is the practical problem of obtaining evidence of the intentions \nbehind the act, of what it means for the actor. The very nature of the enterprise is such that the actor is unlikely to admit \nto the action itself, let alone explain what he had in mind. That some poor men in Sedaka considered such\n  \n< previous page\npage_290\nnext page >\n",

Thus, while it may be possible to uncover a set of beliefs shared by a \nclass that legitimize theft or pilfering, it will rarely be possible to uncover the beliefs of the actor in question. The \n\"transcript\" of petty thieves, especially those not yet apprehended, is notoriously hard to come by.\nThe second problem concerns broader issues of definition and analysis. We tend to think of resistance as actions that \ninvolve at least some short-run individual or collective sacrifice in order to bring about a longer-range, beneficial goal. \nThe immediate losses of a strike, a boycott, or even the refusal to compete with other members of one's class for land or \nwork are obvious cases in point. When it comes to acts like theft, however, we encounter a combination of immediate \nindividual gain and what may be resistance. How are we to judge which of the two purposes is uppermost or decisive? \nWhat is at stake is not a petty definitional matter but rather the interpretation of a whole range of actions that seem to \nme to lie historically at the core of everyday class relations. The English poacher in the eighteenth century may have \nbeen resisting gentry's claim to property in wild game, but he was just as surely interested in rabbit stew. The slaves in \nthe antebellum U.S. South who secretly butchered their master's hog may have been asserting their right to a decent \nsubsistence, but they were just as surely indulging their fondness for roast pork. The Southeast Asian peasant who hid \nhis rice and possessions from the tax collector may have been protesting high taxes, but he was just as surely seeing to it \nthat his family would have enough rice until the next harvest. The peasant conscript who deserted the army may have \nbeen a war resister, but he was just as surely saving his own skin by fleeing the front. Which of these inextricably fused \nmotives are we to take as paramount? Even if we were able to ask the actors in question, and even if they could reply \ncandidly, it is not at all clear that they would be able to make a clear determination. Students of slavery, who have \nlooked into this matter most closely, if only because such forms of self-help were frequently the only option open to \nslaves, have tended to discount such actions as \"real\" resistance for three reasons. All three figure in Gerald Mullin's \nanalysis of slave \"rebelliousness\":\nIn addressing these observable differences in slave behavior, scholars usually ask whether a particular \nrebellious style represented resistance to slavery's abuses or real resistance to slavery itself. When slave \nbehavior is examined in light of its political context, the most menial workers, the field slaves, fare badly. \nSpeaking generally, their \"laziness,\" boondoggling, and pilferage represented a limited, perhaps self-indulgent \ntype of rebelliousness. Their reactions to unexpected abuses or to sudden changes in plantation routine were at \nmost only token acts against slavery.

The distinction for \nhim, as the following quotation indicates, lies in both the realm of consequences and the realm of intentions:\nStrictly speaking, only insurrection represented political action, which some choose to define as the only \ngenuine resistance since it alone directly challenged the power of the regime. From that point of view, those \nactivities which others call \"day-to-day resistance to slavery\"stealing, lying, dissembling, shirking, murder, \ninfanticide, suicide, arsonqualify at best as prepolitical and at worst as apolitical. . . . But \"day-to-day \nresistance to slavery\" generally implied accommodation and made no sense except on the assumption of an \naccepted status quo the norms of which, as perceived or defined by the slaves, had been violated.94\nCombining these overlapping perspectives, the result is something of a dichotomy between real resistance, on the one \nhand, and token, incidental, or even epiphenomenal activities, on the other. Real resistance, it is argued, is (a) organized, \nsystematic, and cooperative, (b) principled or selfless, (c) has revolutionary consequences, and/or (d) embodies ideas or \nintentions that negate the basis of domination itself. Token, incidental, or epiphenomenal activities, by contrast, are (a) \nunorganized, unsystematic, and individual, (b) opportunistic and self-indulgent, (c) have no revolutionary consequences, \nand/or (d) imply, in their intention or meaning, an accommodation with the system of domination. These distinctions are \nimportant for any analysis that has as its objective the attempt to delineate the various forms of resistance and to show \nhow they are related to one another and to the form of domination in which they occur. My quarrel is with the \ncontention that the latter forms are ultimately trivial or inconsequential, while only the former can be said to constitute \nreal resistance. This position, in my view, fundamentally misconstrues the very basis of the economic and political \nstruggle conducted daily by subordinate classesnot only slaves, but peasants and workers as wellin repressive settings. It \nis based on an ironic combination of both Leninist and bourgeois assumptions of what constitutes political action. The \nfirst three of the paired comparisons will be addressed here while the final, and vital issue, of whether intentions are \naccom-\n93. Mullin, Flight and Rebellion, 35, emphasis added.\n94.

Embedded in the logic \nof Genovese and, especially, of Mullins, is the assumption that such acts intrinsically lack revolutionary consequences. \nThis may often be the case, but it is also the case that there is hardly a modern revolution that can be successfully \nexplained without reference to precisely such acts when they take place on a massive scale. Take, for example, the \nmatter of desertion from the army and the role it has played in revolutions.\nThe Russian Revolution is a striking case in point. Growing desertions from the largely peasant rank and file of the \narmy in the summer of 1917 were a major and indispensable part of the revolutionary process in at least two respects. \nFirst, they were responsible for the collapse of the main institution of repression of the tsarist state, inherited by the \nProvisional Governmentan institution that had earlier, in 1905, put down another revolutionary upheaval. Second, the \ndeserters contributed directly to the revolutionary process in the countryside by participating in the seizures of land \nthroughout the core provinces of European Russia. And it is abundantly clear that the hemorrhage in the tsarist forces \nwas largely \"self-indulgent,\" \"unorganized,\" and \"individual,\" although thousands and thousands of individuals threw \ndown their arms and headed home.95 The June attack into Austria had been crushed with huge losses of troops and \nofficers; the ration of bread had been reduced and \"fast days\" inaugurated at the front; the soldiers knew, moreover, that \nif they stayed at the front they might miss the chance to gain from the land seizures breaking out in the countryside.96 \nDesertion offered the peasant conscripts the chance of saving their skins and of returning home where bread and, now, \nland were available. The risks were minimal since discipline in the army had dissolved. One can hardly imagine a set of \nmore \"self-indulgent'' goals. But it was just such self-indulgent ends, acted on\n95. See Allan Wildman, \"The February Revolution in the Russian Army,\" Soviet Studies 22, no. 1 (July \n1970): 323; Marc Ferro, \"The Russian Soldier in 1917: Undisciplined, Patriotic, and Revolutionary,\" Slavic \nReview 30, no. 3 (September 1971): 483512; Barrington Moore, Jr., Injustice, 364, and Theda Skocpol, States \nand Social Revolutions (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1979), 13538. There is a consensus that \nBolshevik propaganda at the front was not instrumental in provoking these desertions.\n96. One may wish to call the land seizures and sacking of gentry property a revolutionary act, and it was certainly \nrevolutionary in its consequences in 1917. But it was a largely spontaneous affair out of the control of any party, \nand it is extremely unlikely that those seizing the land self-consciously saw themselves as bringing about a \nrevolutionary government, let alone a Bolshevik one.

The \ndissolution of the Nationalist armies of Chiang Kai-shek in 1948 and of Saigon's army in 1975 could no doubt be \nanalyzed along similar lines. And long before the final debacle, acts of insubordination and noncompliance in each \narmyin the U.S. Army serving in Vietnam as well, it should be addedhad set sharp limits on what the \ncounterrevolutionary forces could expect and require of their own rank and file.98 Resistance of this kind is of course \nnot a monopoly of the counterrevolution, as George Washington and Emiliano Zapata, among others, discovered. We \ncan imagine that the eminently personal logic of Pedro Martinez, a sometime soldier with the Zapatista forces, was not \nmarkedly different from that of the tsarist troops leaving the front.\nThat's where {battle of Tizapan} I finally had it. The battle was something awful: The shooting was \ntremendous! It was a completely bloody battle, three days and three nights. But I took it for one day and then I \nleft. I quit the army . . . I said to myself, \"It's time now I got back to my wife, to my little children. I'm getting \nout.\" . . . I said to myself, \"No, my family comes first and they are starving. Now I'm leaving.\"99\nThe refreshing candor of Pedro Martinez serves to remind us that there is no necessary relationship between the banality \nof the act of self-preservation and of family obligations, on the one hand, and the banality of the consequences of such \nacts, on the other.\nWhile the consequences of peasant self-serving are essential to any larger analysis of class relations or of the state, I do \nnot wish to argue that resistance\n97. E. H. Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution: 19171923, vol. 1 (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1966), 103. If we \nwished to extend this account of Russian peasant \"self-demobilization\" back into history, we might plausibly \ninclude the massive and persistent flight of serfs to the frontier in the eighteenth century. The effort to retain \nthe serfs and their labor was perhaps the key to domestic statecraft throughout this period. Jerome Blum \nreminds us that \"There were more laws about runaways and their recovery than any other subjecta fact that in \nitself bears witness to the proportions of peasant flight.\" Lord and Peasant in Russia: From the 9th to the 19th \nCentury (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1961), 553.\n98. The initial successes of Solidarity in Poland can in a similar fashion be attributed largely to the fact that the \nunpopular regime could not count on its own army actively to suppress the rebellious civilian population and was \ninstead forced to rely on the hated paramilitary police, the Zomos.\n99.

Such a view runs into formidable difficulties, if for no \nreason other than the \"law of unintended consequences.\" Many acts that almost any reasonable observer would call acts \nof resistance may backfire and produce the very opposite of what was intended. The terrorism of revolutionary \nmovements that explicitly aim at crippling the state may instead usher in a more terrible and permanent dictatorship. The \neffective strike of peasant laborers explicitly intended to raise wages and increase employment may instead prompt a \nwholesale mechanization of production, thereby eliminating jobs.100\nThe problem with existing concepts of resistance is therefore not that they must inevitably deal with intentions and \nmeaning as well as with consequences. Rather, the problem lies in what is a misleading, sterile, and sociologically naive \ninsistence upon distinguishing \"self-indulgent,\" individual acts, on the one hand, from presumably \"principled,\" selfless, \ncollective actions, on the other, and excluding the former from the category of real resistance. To insist on such \ndistinctions as a means of comparing forms of resistance and their consequences is one thing, but to use them as the \nbasic criteria to determine what constitutes resistance is to miss the very wellsprings of peasant politics.\nIt is no coincidence that the cries of \"bread,\" \"land,\" and ''no taxes\" that so often lie at the core of peasant rebellion are \nall joined to the basic material survival needs of the peasant household. Nor should it be anything more than a \ncommonplace that everyday peasant politics and everday peasant resistance (and also, of course, everyday compliance) \nflows from these same fundamental material needs. We need assume no more than an understandable desire on the part \nof the peasant household to surviveto ensure its physical safety, to ensure its food supply, to ensure its necessary cash \nincometo identify the source of its resistance to the claims of press gangs, tax collectors, landlords, and employers.\nTo ignore the self-interested element in peasant resistance is to ignore the determinate context not only of peasant \npolitics, but of most lower-class politics. It is precisely the fusion of self-interest and resistance that is the vital force \nanimating the resistance of peasants and proletarians. When a peasant hides part of his crop to avoid paying taxes, he is \nboth filling his stomach and depriving the state of grain.101 When a peasant soldier deserts the army because the food is \nbad and his crops at home are ripe, he is both looking after himself and\n100. More farfetched, but still possible, is the opposite situation, where an act that we would not, by any \nstretch of the imagination, wish to call an act of resistance (for example, a completely inadvertent setting on \nfire of an aristocrat's crop land or a hunting accident in which a peasant kills the provincial governor) may set \noff a chain of events that weakens the class domination of rural elites. Any definition of resistance thus \nrequires at least some reference to the intentions of the actors.\n101. Again, such resistance is not the monopoly of lower classes. Tax evasion and the so-called black economy in \nadvanced capitalist countries are also forms of resistance, albeit pursued with most vigor and success by middle \nand upper classes.\n  \n< previous page\npage_295\nnext page >\n",

When such acts are rare and isolated, they are of little interest; but when they become a \nconsistent pattern (even though uncoordinated, let alone organized) we are dealing with resistance. The intrinsic nature \nand, in one sense, the \"beauty\" of much peasant resistance is that it often confers immediate and concrete advantages, \nwhile at the same time denying resources to the appropriating classes, and that it requires little or no manifest \norganization. The stubbornness and force of such resistance flow directly from the fact that it is so firmly rooted in the \nshared material struggle experienced by a class.\nTo require of lower-class resistance that it somehow be \"principled\" or \"selfless\" is not only utopian and a slander on \nthe moral status of fundamental material needs; it is, more fundamentally, a misconstruction of the basis of class \nstruggle, which is, first and foremost, a struggle over the appropriation of work, production, property, and taxes. \"Bread-\nand-butter'' issues are the essence of lower-class politics and resistance. Consumption, from this perspective, is both the \ngoal and the result of resistance and counterresistence. As Utsa Patnaik has noted, \"Consumption is nothing but the \nhistorically 'necessary labor,' the share of net output allowed to be retained by the petty producers as the outcome of \ntheir struggle with the surplus-appropriating classes.\"102 This is then the self-interested core of routine class struggle: \nthe often defensive effort to mitigate or defeat appropriation.103 Petty thefts of grain or pilfering on the threshing floor \nmay seem like trivial \"coping\" mechanisms from one vantage point, but, from a broader view of class relations, how the \nharvest is actually divided belongs at the center.\nA further advantage of a concept of resistance that begins with self-interested material needs is that it is far more in \nkeeping with how \"class\" is first experienced by the historical actors themselves.

Indeed, class struggle is the prior, as \nwell as the more universal, concept. To put it bluntly, classes do not exist as separate entities, look around, \nfind an enemy class, and then start to struggle. On the contrary, people find themselves in a society structured \nin determined ways (crucial, but not exclusively, in productive relations), they experience exploitation (or the \nneed to maintain power over those whom they exploit), they identify points of antagonistic interest, they \ncommence to struggle around these issues and in the process of struggling they discover themselves as \nclasses, they come to know this discovery as class-consciousness. Class and class-consciousness are always \nthe last, not the first, stage in the real historical process.104\nIt is impossible, of course, to divorce the material basis of the struggle from the struggle over valuesthe ideological \nstruggle. To resist a claim or an appropriation is to resist, as well, the justification and rationale behind that particular \nclaim. In Sedaka, this ideological resistance is generally kept from public view, but it forms a vital part of the normative \nsubculture among the poor.\nThe inclination to dismiss \"individual\" acts of resistance as insignificant and to reserve the term \"resistance\" for \ncollective or organized action is as misguided as the emphasis on \"principled\" action. The privileged status accorded \norganized movements, I suspect, flows from either of two political orientations: the one, essentially Leninist, which \nregards the only viable class action as one led by a vanguard party serving as a \"general staff,\" the other more \nstraightforwardly derived from a familiarity and preference for open, institutionalized politics as conducted in capitalist \ndemocracies. In either case, however, there is a misapprehension of the social and political circumstances of peasant \nresistance.\nThe individual and often anonymous quality of much peasant resistance is of course eminently suited to the sociology of \nthe class from which it arises. Being a class of \"low classlessness\" scattered in small communities and generally lacking \nthe institutional means to act collectively, it is likely to employ those means of resistance that are local and require little \ncoordination. Under special historical circumstances of overwhelming material deprivation, the legal protection of open \npolitical action, or a breakdown in the institutions of repression (more rarely, all three), the peasantry can and has \nbecome an organized, political, mass movement. Such circumstances are, however, extremely rare and usually short-\nlivedeven if they contribute to a revolution. In most places at most times this political option has simply been precluded. \nThe penchant for forms of resistance that are individual and unobtrusive are not only what a Marxist might expect from \npetty commodity producers and rural laborers, but have certain advantages.

What is lacking in terms of central coordination may be compensated for \nby flexibility and persistence. These forms of resistance will win no set-piece battles, but they are admirably adapted to \nlong-run campaigns of attrition.\nIf we were to confine our search for peasant resistance to formally organized activity, we would search largely in vain, \nfor in Malaysia as in many other Third World countries, such organizations are either absent or the creations of officials \nand rural elites. We would simply miss much of what is happening. The history of Malay peasant resistance to the state, \nfor example, has yet to be written. When, and if, it is written, however, it will not be a history in which open rebellion or \nformal organizations play a significant role. The account of resistance in the precolonial era would perhaps be \ndominated by flight and avoidance of corvée labor and a host of tolls and taxes. Resistance to colonial rule was marked \nfar less by open confrontations than by willful and massive noncompliance with its most threatening aspects, for \nexample, the persistent underreporting of landholdings and crop yields to minimize taxes, the relentless disregard for all \nregulations designed to restrict smallholders' rubber planting and marketing, the unabated pioneer settlement of new \nland despite a host of laws forbidding it. Much of this continues today. There is ample evidence for this resistance in the \narchives,105 but, inasmuch as its goal was to evade the state and the legal order, not to attack them, it has received far \nless historical attention than the quite rare and small revolts that had far less impact on the course of colonial rule. Even \nin advanced capitalist nations, the \"movements\" of the poor take place largely outside the sphere of formal political \nactivity.106 It follows that, if\n105. Tax evasion is evident from the steady reports of land tax arrears from Kedah and from indications of \nsystematic misreporting of yields. Thus, Unfederated Malay States, Annual Report of the Advisor to the \nKedah Government, 1921 (Alor Setar: Government Printer, 1922), 38, notes, \"The padi planter regards with \nsuspicion the collection of statistics as a possible basis for further taxation and minimizes his harvest.\" The \nReport for May 1930 to May 1931 puts the underreporting between 15 and 18 percent (p. 8), in some districts \nat nearly 50 percent (p. 55).

Formal political activity may be the \nnorm for the elites, the intelligentsia, and the middle classes which, in the Third World as well as in the West, have a \nnear monopoly of institutional skills and access. But it would be naive to expect that peasant resistance can or will \nnormally take the same form.\nNor should we forget that the forms of peasant resistance are not just a product of the social ecology of the peasantry. \nThe parameters of resistance are also set, in part, by the institutions of repression. To the extent that such institutions do \ntheir work effectively, they may all but preclude any forms of resistance other than the individual, the informal, and the \nclandestine.107 Thus, it is perfectly legitimateeven importantto distinguish between various levels and forms of \nresistance: formal-informal, individual-collective, public-anonymous, those that challenge the system of \ndominationthose that aim at marginal gains. But it should be made crystal clear that what we may actually be measuring \nin this enterprise is the level of repression that structures the available options. Depending on the circumstances they \nconfront, peasants may oscillate from organized electoral activity to violent confrontations to silent and anonymous acts \nof foot dragging and theft. This oscillation may in some cases be due to changes in the social organization of the \npeasantry, but it is as likely, if not more likely, to be due to changes in the level of repression. More than one peasantry \nhas been brutally reduced from open, radical political activity at one moment to stubborn and sporadic acts of petty \nresistance at the next. If we allow ourselves to call only the former \"resistance,\" we simply allow the structure of \ndomination to define for us what is resistance and what is not resistance.\nMany of the forms of resistance I have been examining may be individual actions, but this is not to say that they are \nuncoordinated.108 Here again, a\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nnothing political has occurred, nothing has to be explained, at least not in terms of political protest.\" Frances \nFox Piven and Richard A.

In Malay society this tradition is captured in the Sang Kancil, or mouse deer tales familiar to all \npeasants. The mouse deer is the stereotypical \"trickster\" figure: a small and weak but agile creature who survives and \ntriumphs over far more powerful beasts by his wits, his deceit, and his cunning. It takes no literary legerdemain to \nrecognize Sang Kancil as a popular metaphor for the necessary survival skills of the peasantry. They have of course \ntheir cultural equivalents in the popular traditions of other historically subordinate groupsTil Eulenspiegel and Brer \nRabbit, to name only two. At the very least, they encourage the kind of resistance celebrated in this South Carolina slave \nsaying: \"De bukrah (white) had scheme, en de nigger hab trick, en ebery time the bukrah scheme once, the nigger trick \ntwice.\"110\nIn this and in other ways (for example, tales of bandits, peasant heroes, religious myths) the peasant subculture helps to \nunderwrite dissimulation, poaching, theft, tax evasion, avoidance of conscription, and so on. While folk culture is not \ncoordination in the formal sense, it often achieves a \"climate of opinion\" which, in other more institutionalized \nsocieties, would require a public relations campaign.111 The striking thing about peasant society is the extent to which \na whole range of complex activitiesfrom labor exchange to house moving to wedding preparations to feastsare \ncoordinated by networks of understanding and practice. It is the same with boycotts, wage \"negotiations,\" the refusal of \ntenants to compete with one another, or the conspiracy of silence surrounding\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nsoul of direct action by the working class.

No formal organizations are created because none are required; and yet a form of coordination is achieved that \nalerts us that what is happening is not just individual action.\nIn light of these considerations, then, let us return briefly to the question of intention. For many forms of peasant \nresistance, we have every reason to expect that actors will remain mute about their intentions. Their safety may depend \non silence and anonymity; the kind of resistance itself may depend for its effectiveness on the appearance of \nconformity; their intentions may be so embedded in the peasant subculture and in the routine, taken-for-granted struggle \nto provide for the subsistence and survival of the household as to remain inarticulate. The fish do not talk about the \nwater.\nIn one sense, of course, their intentions are inscribed in the acts themselves. A peasant soldier who deserts the army is in \neffect \"saying\" by his act that the purposes of this institution and the risks and hardships it entails will not prevail over \nhis family or personal needs. A harvest laborer who steals paddy from his employer is \"saying\" that his need for rice \ntakes precedence over the formal property rights of his boss.\nWhen it comes to those social settings where the material interests of appropriating classes are directly in conflict with \nthe peasantry (rents, wages, employment, taxes, conscription, the division of the harvest), we can, I think, infer \nsomething of intentions from the nature of the actions themselves. This is especially the case when there is a systematic \npattern of actions that mitigate or deny a claim on the peasant surplus. Evidence about intentions is, of course, always \nwelcome, but we should not expect too much. For this reason, the definition of resistance given earlier places particular \nemphasis on the effort to thwart material and symbolic claims from dominant classes. The goal, after all, of the great \nbulk of peasant resistance is not directly to overthrow or transform a system of domination but rather to survivetoday, \nthis week, this seasonwithin it. The usual goal of peasants, as Hobsbawm has so aptly put it, is \"working the system to \ntheir minimum disadvantage.\"112 Their persistent attempts to \"nibble away\" may backfire, they may marginally \nalleviate exploitation, they may force a renegotiation of the limits of appropriation, they may change the course of \nsubsequent development, and they may more rarely help bring the system down. These are possible consequences. Their \nintention, by contrast, is nearly always survival and persistence. The pursuit of that end may, depending on \ncircumstances, require either the petty resistance we have seen or more dramatic actions of self-defense. In any event, \nmost of their efforts will be seen by appropriating classes as truculence, deceit, shirking, pilfering, arrogancein short, all \nthe labels intended to denigrate the many faces of resistance.\nIt should be apparent that resistance is not simply whatever peasants do to\n112.

Much of what they do, as we have seen, is to be understood as compliance, \nhowever grudgingly. Survival as petty commodity producers or laborers may impel some to save themselves at the \nexpense of their fellows. The poor landless laborer who steals paddy from another poor man or who outbids him for a \ntenancy is surviving, but he is surely not resisting in the sense defined here. One of the key questions that must be asked \nabout any system of domination is the extent to which it succeeds in reducing subordinate classes to purely \"beggar-thy-\nneighbor\" strategies for survival. Certain combinations of atomization, terror, repression, and pressing material needs \ncan indeed achieve the ultimate dream of domination: to have the dominated exploit each other.\nAllowing that only those survival strategies that deny or mitigate claims from appropriating classes can be called \nresistance, we are nevertheless left with a vast range of actions to consider. Their variety conceals a basic continuity. \nThat continuity lies in the history of the persistent efforts of relatively autonomous petty commodity producers to \ndefend their fundamental material and physical interests and to reproduce themselves. At different times and places they \nhave defended themselves against the corvée, taxes, and conscription of the traditional agrarian state, against the \ncolonial state, against the inroads of capitalism (for example, rents, interest, proletarianization, mechanization), against \nthe modern capitalist state, and, it must be added, against many purportedly socialist states as well. The revolution, \nwhen and if it does come, may eliminate many of the worst evils of the ancient regime, but it is rarely if ever the end of \npeasant resistance. For the radical elites who capture the state are likely to have different goals in mind than their \nerstwhile peasant supporters. They may envisage a collectivized agriculture, while the peasantry clings to its \nsmallholdings; they may want a centralized political structure, while the peasantry is wedded to local autonomy; they \nmay want to tax the countryside in order to industrialize; and they will almost certainly wish to strengthen the state vis-à-\nvis civil society. It therefore becomes possible to an astute observer like Goran Hyden to find remarkable parallels \nbetween the earlier resistance of the Tanzanian peasantry to colonialism and capitalism and its current resistance to the \ninstitutions and policies of the socialist state of Tanzania.113 He provides a gripping account of how the \"peasant mode \nof production\"by foot dragging, by privatizing work and land that have been appropriated by the state, by evasion, by \nflight, and\n113.

Seemingly straightforward social facts about who is rich and \nwho is poorand how rich and how poorare contested in this community. The poor, when they may do so with relative \nsafety, display an impressive capacity to penetrate behind the pieties and rationales of the rich farmers and to understand \nthe larger realities of capital accumulation, proletarianization, and marginalization. They emphasize and manipulate \nthose values that will serve their material and symbolic interests as a class. They reject the denigrating characterizations \nthe rich deploy against them. And within the narrow limits created by the fear of repression and the \"dull compulsion of \neconomic relations,\" they act to defend their interests by boycotts, quiet strikes, theft, and malicious gossip.\nIn this final chapter, I hope to bring these rather homely insights from Sedaka in touch with the larger issues of the \nsocial experience of class and the typical contexts of class struggle. It should be possible also to say something \nmeaningful about class-consciousness, mystification, and ideological hegemony. The objective is a deeper appreciation \nof everyday forms of symbolic resistance and the way in which they articulate with everyday acts of material resistance. \nJust as peasantsZola and many others notwithstandingdo not simply vacillate between blind submission and homicidal \nrage, neither do they move directly from ideological complicity to strident class-consciousness.

Before \naddressing these larger issues, however, it will be helpful first to clarify the nature of the ideological struggle in Sedaka.\nThe Material Base and Normative Superstructure in Sedaka\nThere is no doubt whatever that the ideological conflict now under way in Sedaka is a reaction to the massive \ntransformation of production relations made possible by double-cropping and mechanization backed by the state. It is \nthese exogenous changes in the material base that have allowed large landowners and farmers to change the tenure \nsystem, raise rents, dismiss tenants, replace wage workers with machinery, and either to lease out large plots for long \nperiods or to resume cultivation themselves. This shift in the balance of economic power has also allowed rich farmers \nto eliminate or curtail a host of social practices that were part and parcel of the earlier scheme of production relations: \nfeast giving, Islamic charity, loans and advance wages, and even much of the social recognition and respect previously \naccorded to poorer villagers. What has occurred, in short, is that those facets of earlier relations of production that are \nno longer underwritten by the material interests of wealthy farmers are being abandoned piecemeal or wholesale.\nThese transformations of the material base and their economic and social consequences for class relations have worked \nthemselves out within the context of a given, normative environment. Two general facts about this normative \nenvironment are worth noting. First, it is not some Parsonian value consensus in which actors conform to a normative \norder that is somehow outside and above themselves but rather a normative environment of conflict and divergent \ninterpretations. Well before double-cropping, for example, large farmers regarded zakat peribadi given to harvest \nworkers as a favor or gift, while the workers themselves came to regard it as a payment to which they were entitled as a \nmatter of right. Second, this normative environment was itself, in part, a product of the material conditions of \nproduction prior to double-cropping and mechanization. We are not therefore dealing with purely mental constructs \noutside day-to-day practical activity but rather with values that were firmly anchored in a host of commonplace material \npractices.1 The main point for my purposes is that the peasants of Sedaka do not simply react to objective conditions per \nse but rather to the interpretation they place on those conditions as mediated by values embedded in concrete practices.\nIn this connection, it is important to sketch briefly both the material practices associated with rice production and the \nnormative understandings of them that\n1.

As for the practices themselves, one can satisfactorily account for them almost \nentirely in terms of the concrete material interests of the actors involved. These material interests were, in turn, largely \nan artifact of the striking inequity in the distribution of the means of production (rice land) prior to double-cropping. For \nsubstantial farmers, the key production problem was the timely and reliable mobilization of a labor force for the major \noperations of transplanting, reaping, and threshing. The constraints of a rainfed production schedule produce striking \npeaks of labor demand which, even with migrant workers, required readily available local help in the inevitable rush to \nget the paddy planted and harvested. Thus it made eminent good sense for large farmers to develop a loyal work force \nby means of material and symbolic acts of social consideration and friendship. In the first few years of double-cropping, \nwhen migrant workers were no longer easily available but combines had not yet appeared, this strategy became even \nmore imperative. The same process was apparent in the relations between landlords and their tenants. When it was easy \nto rent in land, the landlord had a vested interest in making occasional concessions in order to retain a good cultivator. \nTo these more strictly economic motives must be joined the incentives for village elites, especially since independence, \nto build loyal political followings as a precondition of their preferential access to the benefits available from local state \nand party institutions.\nFor those who needed land and workor botha similar, but even more compelling calculus prevailed. For them, living \nfrom hand to mouth, often having to leave after the harvest to find work elsewhere, the prospect of a steady tenancy or \nreliable field work each season was important. The contingent but inevitable crises of crop failure, a death or illness in \nthe family, or a sudden ritual expense meant that the possibility of loans, charity, or emergency assistance was not just a \nconvenience but a virtual necessity for the household.2 If they accommodated themselves publicly to these social \nrelations of production while continually striving to redefine them to their advantage, their behavior made good sense as \nwell.\nBut it is not sufficient merely to understand the obviously self-interested basis of these social relations of production. \nWhat is critical for my purposethat is, the analysis of ideological conflictis to grasp the nature of the normative filter \nthrough which these self-interested actions must pass and how and why they are socially transformed by this passage. \nWhy, in other words, is economic power ''euphemized\" in this fashion and what are the consequences of its eu-\n2.

This social control was, of course, again convertible into labor servicesand hence again into \nmaterial wealth. Are we, as Bourdieu asks in a similar context, to see in this simply a clever sleight-of-hand, \"a \ndisguised form of purchase of labor power or a covert exaction of corvées?\" He answers:\nBy all means, as long as the analysis holds together what holds together in practice, the double reality of \nintrinsically equivocal, ambiguous conduct . . . the complete reality of this appropriation of services lies in the \nfact that it can only take place in the disguise of the thiwizi {a ritual of disinterested gift giving}, the voluntary \nassistance which is also a corvée and is thus a voluntary corvée and forced assistance.4\nThe euphemization of economic power is necessary both where direct physical coercion is not possible and where the \npure indirect domination of the capitalist market is not yet sufficient to ensure appropriation by itself.5 In such settings, \nappropriation must take place through a socially recognized form of domination. Such domination is not simply \nimposed by force but must assume a form that gains social compliance. If it is to work at all, it requires that the weaker \npartyif only publiclyacquiesce in the euphemism.\nThree consequences of this euphemization of economic control are central to\n3. The term is Pierre Bourdieu's (Outline of a Theory of Practice, trans. Richard Nice {Cambridge: Cambridge \nUniv. Press, 1977}, 191). The analysis in this and the next paragraph relies very heavily on Bourdieu's subtle \nanalysis of precapitalist forms of domination.\n4. Ibid., 179, emphasis in original. Bourdieu also elaborates that \"Gentle, hidden exploitation is the form taken by \nman's exploitation by man whenever overt, brutal exploitation is impossible. It is as false to identify this \nessentially dual economy with its official reality (generosity, mutual aid, etc.), i.e. the form which exploitation has \nto adopt in order to take place, as it is to reduce it to its objective reality, seeing mutual aid as corvée, the khammes \n{client, bondsman} as a sort of slave, and so on. The gift, generosity, conspicuous distributionthe extreme case of \nwhich is potlatchare operations of social alchemy which may be observed whenever the direct application of overt \nphysical or economic violence is negatively sanctioned, and which tend to bring about the transmutation of \neconomic capital into symbolic capital.\" Ibid., 192.\n5. In this respect, the Marxist position that feudal domination is direct, undisguised appropriation, whereas \ncapitalist domination works through the mystified form of commodity fetishism in which the worker \"appears\" to \nsell his labor as a commodity is in error. The \"gift\" as a disguised appropriation can be seen as the functional \nequivalent of commodity fetishism under capitalism. This is not, howeveras will be apparent lateran argument on \nbehalf of false-consciousness.\n  \n< previous page\npage_307\nnext page >\n",

The cultivation of people, no \nless than the cultivation of paddy land, demands time, effort, and resources. The large farmer who wanted to ensure his \nlabor supply and his political following had to handcraft his social authority link by link by means of strategic gifts, \ncharity, loans, sociability, feasts, and other concrete and symbolic services.6\nA second, and closely related, consequence is that the euphemization of economic domination could be achieved only \nby virtue of a degree of socialization of the profits of cultivation. I use the word socialization cautiously, as there has of \ncourse never been any socialization of the ownership of the means of production. Instead what occurred was a modest \nand strategic socialization of a portion of the crop itself and the proceeds from it, which took the form of gifts in \nemergencies, zakat after the harvest, feasts, liberality, and so forth. This limited socialization of wealthcarried on, to be \nsure, between private individualswas the only way in which wealth could be successfully converted into social credit \nand labor services. Here we have something of a rural analogue of what Marx called the contradiction between private \nappropriation and socialized production, except that in this case it is a contradiction between private appropriation and \nthe social use of property. When we look closely at the charges the poor make against the rich, they are almost without \nexception arguments for the social use of property. Thus, the charges about the decline of feast giving, the \ndisappearance of post-harvest zakat, the refusal of alms (sedekah), and hence the more global charge of stinginess and \ntightfistedness are directly related to the social use of property. Even the major issues of production relationscombine-\nharvester use, the resort to leasehold tenancy (pajak), accelerated rent collection, and the abuses of the Village \nImprovement Schemecan be viewed as appeals to past practices, both customary and specifically Islamic, in which the \nproperty and influence of the rich were condoned only if they also served to provide land, work, and income to the rest \nof the community. This is perhaps also why the ideological struggle is largely confined to the Malay community, the \nonly unit within which the social use of property was actively sanctioned. Such claims are now tenaciously defended \nprecisely because they are grounded in both the symbolic and material practices of a shared, if contested, tradition.\nA third aspect of the euphemization of property relations is that it is always the focus of symbolic manipulation, \nstruggle, and conflict. We must not view these patterns as merely a ploy, a mystification, as dust thrown in the eyes of \nsubordinate classes. While the symbolic conduct of the rich is certainly self-\n6. One may plausibly argue, I think, that the total of these servicesin terms of their costwas no more than what \na free market wage and tenancy market would have required to achieve the same purpose. The point, \nhowever, is not that these traditional forms of appropriation are less onerous but rather that they were \nnecessary under the circumstances.\n  \n< previous page\npage_308\nnext page >\n",

Thus, we fail to \napprehend the full significance of the occasional gift or zakat not only when we see it as the elites intend it to be seenas \ndisinterested liberalitybut also when we treat it simply as a cynical disguise for appropriation. A more complete view \nrequires us to grasp the double symbolic manipulation of the euphemization itself. As E. P. Thompson has observed in a \nrelated context:\nEven \"liberality\" and \"charity\" may be seen as calculated acts of class appeasement in times of dearth and \ncalculated extortions (under threat of riot) by the crowd: what is (from above) an \"act of giving\" is (from \nbelow) an \"act of getting.''7\nFor a moment, let us try to ground this insight in a particular example from Sedaka with which we are familiar: the \nrelationship between Hamzah and his frequent employer, Haji Kadir. Hamzah knows that Haji Kadir is in a position to \nprovide him with, say, work or a loan against future wages. He also knows that Haji Kadir and others like him have \ntypically described such actions in terms of help (tolong) or assistance (bantuan). Hamzah then uses this knowledge to \npursue his concrete ends; he approaches Haji Kadir, using all the appropriate linguistic forms of deference and \npoliteness, and requests his \"help\" and \"assistance.\"8 In other words, he appeals to the self-interested description that \nHaji Kadir would give to his own acts to place them in the most advantageous light. We know enough about Hamzah to \ngather that this is more or less what actually goes through his mind. If he wins he achieves his desired objective (work \nor a loan) and in the process he contributes willy-nilly to the public legitimacy of the principles to which he strategically \nappealed. Just who is manipulating whom in this petty enterprise is no simple matter to decide. It is best seen, perhaps, \nas a reciprocal manipulation of the symbols of euphemization.\nI shall return to this issue later, but at this stage it is sufficient to note that the key symbols animating class relations in \nSedakagenerosity, stinginess, arrogance, humility, help, assistance, wealth and povertydo not constitute a set of given \nrules or principles that actors simply follow. They are instead the normative raw material that is created, maintained, \nchanged, and above all manipulated by daily human activity. The argument I am making here about the norms \nsurrounding the relations between rich and poor is very much like\n7. E. P. Thompson, \"Eighteenth-Century English Society: Class Struggle without Class,\" Social History 3, no. \n2 (May 1978): 150.\n8. In practice, he is likely to feel his way toward a request by hinting of the work that might be done or noting his \nown financial straits in order to ascertain in advance whether a request has a good chance of success. If a refusal \nseems likely, he will go no further, since an outright \"no\" would jeopardize the possibility of asking again in the \nfuture.\n  \n< previous page\npage_309\nnext page >\n",

Thus, it is hardly surprising to find that the poor in Sedaka work incessantly at maintaining, \nstrengthening, and sanctioning a particular view of who is rich, who is poor, and how they should behave toward one \nanother. Their view of what counts as decent conduct, their gossip, their account of the \"facts,\" their use of nicknames, \ntheir view of what Islam requires, their strikes and boycotts, their selective appeals to customary practices are all bent \ntoward a normative outlook that serves their material and symbolic interests. Since, as it happens, the transformation of \nproduction relations has worked largely to their disadvantage, they find themselves defending a large array of earlier \npractices.\nThe well-to-do villagers, for their part, also make use of the plasticity in any normative discourse to present themselves, \ntheir claims, and their interests in the best possible light. Their problem, as we have seen, however, is slightly different. \nThey are unable simply to renounce the older practices and the normative assumptions lying behind them, but they are \nalso unwilling to forgo the profit that respecting them would require. Thus they are largely driven to a construction of \nthe \"facts\" that allows them to claim that the older practices are inapplicable. They assert, as we have seen, that the \ndifferences in income are negligible, that everyone here cultivates paddy on roughly the same footing, and that the \nconduct of those who are manifestly poor morally disqualifies them from any sympathetic consideration.\nTwo aspects of the ideological position of the rich deserve particular note. First, although it is rarely challenged in \npublic, we know from unguarded derisive commentary by the poor that they hardly find it convincinglet alone \nhegemonic.

They face, therefore, the classic ideological contradiction of the \ntransition to more capitalist forms of production.11 To the degree that the new production relations have prevailed, there \nis a corresponding decline in the social use of property and hence in the social authority of the propertied class.\nThe net result of the process has been that the large farmers and landlords affiliated with the ruling UMNO party have \nbeen losing their social grip on the poor. In the past, UMNO's political control of the countryside was predicated \nsquarely on the social control that wealthier families could exercise over smallholders by virtue of relations of economic \ndependence, particularly tenancy and employment. It was enough for UMNO to attach to itself a large share of the \nwealtheir villagers; their economic dependents were brought along as a matter of course. As the \"organic\" dependence \nof production relations has come unraveled, as profit has been steadily detached from social control over poorer \nvillagers, these economic networks of local authority have become far more tenuous. They have not disappeared \naltogether but have become less numerous and less reliable. Those economic relations of dependence that remain, \nmoreover, are now often organized more strictly by impersonal market forcesfor example, kupang labor, leasehold \ntenancy, full and inflexible economic rentsso as to yield far less in terms of systematic social subordination.\nIt is worth recalling in this context that the inequitable distribution of paddy land in the Muda region has never in itself \nbeen legitimate. Most of the sizable landholdings in the area were, after all, acquired by jual-janji and other sharp \ndealings that took advantage of the periodic destitution of smallholders. As the stories about Haji Broom amply \nillustrate, the extent to which the privileged\n10. Ibid., 4041.\n11. Raymond Williams, The Country and the City (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1973), 182.

Such acts serve both to symbolize and to reaffirm \nthe existing social hierarchy. Because they are so eminently divisible and discretionary, they are also used to single out \nthe \"deserving\" poor for preferential treatment and thereby reinforceat least publiclytheir compliance with the norms of \nsubordination.13 Once the strategic rationale behind such charity loses its economic and political force, a major element \nof social control is also lost. Thus many villagers have effectively been \"turned loose\" to fend for themselves, and it is \nthis that wealthy farmers are at pains to justify. The results of this \"freedom\" are as economically painful for the poor as \nthey are financially rewarding for the rich. But they also undermine the basis of social domination by the propertied \nclass.\nThis is not to imply that the large farmers of the village have lost their control of local affairs, let alone that they face an \ninsurgent peasantry. What has occurred, however, is that the basis of their domination has been transformed. Their \ncontrol, which was once embedded in the primary dependencies of production relations, is now based far more on law, \nproperty, coercion, market forces, and political patronage. They have themselves become much more dependent upon \nthe state for their credit and inputs, for their supply of patronage resources, and for the ultimate force that guarantees \ntheir continued control over scarce land and capital. The rewarding ties that now inextricably bind much of this class to \nthe state mean, of course, that its members have become increasingly vulnerable to any events (for example, a \nprolonged recession or a major political change) that might jeopardize their access and influence. It is ironic but entirely \nlogical that this class has been so securely wedded to the state at precisely the\n12. Poor villagers undoubtedly viewed such rationalizations with skepticism. The point is, however, that in \nany structure of organized inequality, the only possible justification for privilege must reside in its social \nfunction. When, as in Sedaka, the practical and self-interested actions of the rich that reinforce this rationale \nare largely abandoned, and only the rhetoric remains, the social authority of the propertied class is bound to \nsuffer.\n13.

Lacking the economic control that \ngrew from the earlier relations of production, lacking even an ideological position that is convincingly embedded in \nactual practices, this elite will now sink or swim depending on the resources for patronage, profit, and control the state \ncan put at its disposal.\nIf the poorest strata of the rural population in Muda is no longer an integral part of paddy production, if they are no \nlonger necessary to the process of surplus appropriation, one may reasonably wonder why wealthy farmers even bother \nto justify their new pattern of behavior at all. Why rationalize an agrarian system to those who are mostly irrelevant to \nit? Two observations are germane here. The first is that the justifications offered for the new behavior of rich farmers \nare in fact rather cursory, makeshift, and transparent. They are at any rate hardly convincing to those who have been \ndisadvantaged. The second is that wealthy farmers are themselves the product of the earlier agrarian system and the \nnormative ideas that underpinned it; we should hardly be surprised if they choose to understand and explain the new \narrangements in terms of the categories with which they are most familiar.\nIt might be supposed, however, that if ideological hegemony is increasingly unnecessary as a part of day-to-day \nproduction relations in rice farming, it has nevertheless been historically important for surplus appropriation by the state \nitself. Even this supposition would, I believe, be largely mistaken for any period after, say, 1900 in the paddy sector. \nThe remarkable thing about the colonial and independent states of peninsular Malaya is how little they have depended \non systematic appropriations from paddy cultivators. Taxes on paddy land have typically been minimal, and the local \nproducer's price has often been above the world market price. State revenue in Kedah, even in the earlier colonial \nperiod, was derived largely from sources that impinged little on rural incomes. In 1918 and 1919, for example, the \"tax \nfarming\" of the opium and gambling monopolies provided the major sources of provincial revenue.14 What the state \nhas wanted, and continues to want, from the peasantry of the Muda Plain is a surplus of marketable rice at reasonable \nprices with which to feed the work force in mines, on plantations, and now in the urban areas. The vast majority of \nsmallholders in Muda are, and have been, basically irrelevant even to this objective. We need only recall that the great \nbulk (roughly three-fourths) of the paddy marketed in Muda is sold by a small minority (11 percent) of cultivators, who \nfarm more than 10 relong. The surplus can, of course, now be produced largely without the labor power of the poor. \nAnd this labor power is not required elsewhere. Recent estimates show that the natural increase of the existing labor \nforce now on plantations and in the cities will be more than sufficient for the\n14.

We must instead look \nto the realm of politics. In such a diversified, open, export economy, the revenue of the state is drawn mostly from \nexport and import duties, the corporate income tax, licenses, concessions, excise taxes, and loans. If the conservative \nMalay elite is to continue benefiting from the privileges and opportunities the economy and the state provide, it must, as \na basic precondition, maintain its political domination over that state. Given the semicompetitive election system that \ncurrently prevails, this objective requires the political support of the bulk of the Malay electorate.16 The largest Malay-\nmajority states of Kedah and Kelantan, which also happen to be the main paddy-growing regions, are necessary for that \nsupport. It is in this context that one can understand the very considerable efforts in the field of development programs, \ngrants, clinics, schools, loans, and infrastructure that the state has undertaken with an acute eye to maximizing political \nsupport. One might even say that it is now the state and the ruling party that have taken over the task of euphemizing \ndomination by means of their discretionary subsidies to rural areas. This euphemization is accomplished of course \nthrough the mediation of the wealthy, landowning, local UMNO elites. In any event, the political control of the paddy-\ngrowing peasantry is not an end in itself nor a means by which to justify a pattern of direct appropriation. Political \ncontrol is an essential precondition for appropriation, which takes place elsewhere.\nRethinking the Concept of Hegemony\nOur examination of class relations in Sedaka suggests rather forcefully that the concept of hegemonyof ideological \ndominationmerits a fundamental rethinking. Such a rethinking, as I hope to show, is required not only in the context of \nthe seventy families that have preoccupied us in this account, but for subordinate classes in general.\n15. This is the import of the Kedah Perlis Development Study: Interim Report, by Economic Consultants Ltd. \n(Alor Setar: 1977), although the consultants expect an outmigration pattern similar to past experience to \ncontinue unabated. Even during the colonial period the need for urban workers and plantation labor was met \nlargely by migrants from China and India rather than from the Malay population.\n16. I do not doubt for a moment that, if this political domination were seriously threatened at the polls, the already \nhedged-about electoral system would be quickly dismantled, as it was following the riots of 1969.\n  \n< previous page\npage_314\nnext page >\n",

The ultimate source in Marx and Engels's own writings from which this analytical \ntradition arises is the well-known passage from The German Ideology cited at length below:\nThe ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas: i.e. the class which is the ruling material force \nof society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material \nproduction at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, \ngenerally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling \nideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material \nrelationships grasped as ideas; hence of the relationships which make the one class the ruling one, therefore, \nthe ideas of its dominance. The individuals composing the ruling class possess, among other things, \nconsciousness, and therefore think. Insofar, therefore, as they rule as a class and determine the extent and \ncompass of an epoch, it is evident that they do this in its whole range, hence among other things, rule also as \nthinkers, as producers of ideas, and regulate the production and distribution of the idea of their age: thus their \nideas are the ruling ideas of the epoch.18\nHegemony is simply the name Gramsci gave to this process of ideological domination. The central idea behind it is the \nclaim that the ruling class dominates not only the means of physical production but the means of symbolic production as \nwell. Its control over the material forces of production is replicated, at the level of ideas, in its control over the \nideological \"sectors\" of societyculture, religion, education, and the mediain a manner that allows it to disseminate those \nvalues that reinforce its position. What Gramsci did, in brief, was to explain the institutional basis of false-\nconsciousness.\nFor my purposes, the critical implication of hegemony is that class rule is\n17.

The term is used here, however, \nin its symbolic or idealist sense, since that is precisely where Gramsci's major contribution to Marxist thought lies. It is \nin fact the pervasiveness of ideological hegemony that normally suffices to ensure social peace and to relegate the \ncoercive apparatus of the state to the background. Only \"in anticipation of moments of crisis and command, when \nspontaneous consent has failed, is force openly resorted to.\"19\nExactly how voluntary and complete this hegemony is likely to be is not entirely clear, even on a close reading of \nGramsci.20 At times he appears to imply that hegemony involves an active belief in the legitimacy and superiority of \nthe ruling group; at other times he implies that the acceptance is a more passive act in which the main features of the \nsocial order are merely accepted as given. Gramsci does, however, draw a sharp distinction between thought and \naction.21 The concrete action of workers who defend their material interests may, for example, suggest a radical \nconsciousness but, at the level of ideasthe level at which hegemony operatesthat incipient radical consciousness is \nundermined by the substratum of values and perceptions socially determined from above. This blockage implies, as \nFemia notes, that \"left to their own devices then, the masses in Western countries are powerless to overcome their \nintellectual and moral subordination. . . . The long and arduous process of demystification requires an external \nagency.\"22 The function of the revolutionary party, then, is to provide the working class with the conceptual apparatus \nand \"critical consciousness\" it cannot produce on its own. Only such a party will be capable of breaking the hegemony \nof the bourgeoisie and replacing it with its own hegemony; this new hegemony is not, Gramsci insists, a consequence of \nrevolution, but rather a precondition of an authentic revolution.23\nGramsci and other twentieth-century Marxists have, of course, developed their analysis of ideological domination in \nlarge part to explain why the material contradictions of capitalism as depicted in Capital have thus far failed to produce \nsocialist revolution in the industrialized democracies. It was the manifest durability of capitalism that directed their \nattention forcibly to ideology and \"super-structure.\" This attention was welcome and instructive in a number of ways.\n19.

The very terms hegemony and false-consciousness are, after all, a \nclear admission that culture, values, and ideology cannot be directly read off objective, material conditions.24 But in \nmaking long overdue room for the analysis of ideological domination per se, many of Gramsci's successors have, it \nseems to me, substituted a kind of ideological determinism for the material determinism they sought to avoid. Curiously \nenough, Gramsci's own work is less open to this charge than the more purely theoretical elaborations of those who have \nfollowed in this tradition (for example, Miliband and Althusser).25\nI hope to show in what follows that the notion of hegemony and its related concepts of false-consciousness, \nmystification, and ideological state apparatuses not only fail to make sense of class relations in Sedaka, but also are just \nas likely to mislead us seriously in understanding class conflict in most situations.26 The gist of the argument to be \ndeveloped at some length is summarized very briefly below and will serve to order the subsequent discussion:\nFirst, the concept of hegemony ignores the extent to which most subordinate classes are able, on the basis of their daily \nmaterial experience, to penetrate and demystify the prevailing ideology.\nSecond, theories of hegemony frequently confound what is inevitable with what is just, an error that subordinate classes \nrarely, if ever, make. This conclusion stems from a surface examination of public action in power-laden situations that \noverlooks both the \"hidden transcript\" and the necessity of routine and pragmatic submission to the \"compulsion of \neconomic relations\" as well as the realities of coercion.\nThird, a hegemonic ideology must, by definition, represent an idealization, which therefore inevitably creates the \ncontradictions that permit it to be criticized in its own terms. The ideological source of mass radicalism is, in this sense, \nto be sought as much within a prevailing ideological order as outside it.\nFourth, a historical examination of the rank and file of nearly any manifestly revolutionary mass movement will show \nthat the objectives sought are usually\n24. See, for example, Philip Carl Salzman, \"Culture as Enhabilments,\" in The Structure of Folk Models, ed. \nLadislav Holy and Milan Stuchlik, ASA Monograph No. 20 (New York: Academic, 1981), 23356.\n25. It is perhaps not entirely surprising that intellectuals further removed from political combat and from the \nworking class itself have fastened on analysis that ascribes a nearly coercive influence to the product of their own \nclass, that is, ideology!\n26. I am indebted for parts of the following analysis to the excellent general critique of hegemony in its various \nguises by Nicholas Abercrombie, Stephen Hill, and Bryan S. Turner, The Dominant Ideology Thesis (London: \nAllen & Unwin, 1980), as well as to the more polemicaland entertainingbroadside against Althusser in E. P. \nThompson's The Poverty of Theory and Other Essays (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978), 1210.\n  \n< previous page\npage_317\nnext page >\n",

Thus, \"trade \nunion consciousness\" is not, as Lenin claimed, the major obstacle to revolution, but rather the only plausible basis for it.\nFifth, historically, the breaking of the norms and values of a dominant ideology is typically the work of the bearers of a \nnew mode of productionfor example, capitalistsand not of subordinate classes such as peasants and workers. Thus, \nsubordinate classes are often seen as backward looking, inasmuch as they are defending their own interpretation of an \nearlier dominant ideology against new and painful arrangements imposed by elites and/or the state.\nPenetration27\nIf there were a dominant, hegemonic ideology in Sedaka, it would make its presence known in several ways. At a \nminimum, it would require that the beliefs and values of the agrarian elite penetrate and dominate the worldview of the \npoor so as to elicit their consent and approval of an agrarian order which, materially, does not serve their objective \ninterests. Its function would be to conceal or misrepresent the real conflicts of class interests that we have examined and \nto make of the poor, in effect, coconspirators in their own victimization.\nWe have surely heard enough from the poorer farmers in Sedaka to reject, out of hand, such a summary characterization \nof their ideological situation. If there is any penetration to be accounted for here, it is less the penetration of elite beliefs \namong the poor than the capacity of the poor to pierce, in almost every particular, the self-serving picture presented by \nwealthy farmers, landlords, and outside officials. It is true, of course, that the rights and claims the poor assert are \nessentially those prevailing before double-cropping. Perhaps, in this sense, they can be seen as appealing to a (pre-)\nexisting hegemonic order. I shall return to this issue later, but here I should note at once that such an appeal is in their \nmaterial interest and that the rich subscribe, in their own way, to the same values, although their economic behavior is \nnow predicated along more nearly capitalist lines. Ironically, it is the wealthy of Sedaka who fail to subscribe to the \nideology that would best explain how they behave and provide a plausible rationale for that behavior.\nThere is every good reason to suppose that the effective penetration of \"official\" realities by Sedaka's poor is not unique \nor rare but, in fact, commonplace. To view the peasantry of Sedaka as particularly insightful is grossly to overestimate\n27. The term penetration as used here is borrowed from two sources: Anthony Giddens, Central Problems in \nSocial Theory: Action, Structure, and Contradiction in Social Analysis (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, \n1979), and Paul Willis, Learning to Labour (Westmead: Saxon House, 1977). I am indebted particularly to \nWillis's study of working-class school culture, which is a remarkable combination of careful ethnography and \nsubtle ideological analysis grounded securely in class experience.\n  \n< previous page\npage_318\nnext page >\n",

Here I subscribe fully to Paul Willis's trenchant critique \nof Althusser:\nStructuralist theories of reproduction present the dominant ideology (under which culture is subsumed) as \nimpenetrable. Everything fits too neatly. Ideology always pre-exists and preempts any authentic criticism. \nThere are no cracks in the billiard ball smoothness of process. All specific contradictions are smoothed away \nin the universal reproductive functions of ideology. . . . on the contrary, and in my view more \noptimistically . . . there are deep disfunctions and desperate tensions within social and cultural reproduction. \nSocial agents are not passive bearers of ideology, but active appropriators who reproduce existing structures \nonly through struggle, contestation, and a partial penetration of those structures.28\nThe penetration of official platitudes by any subordinate class is to be expected both because those platitudes are \nunlikely to be as cohesive or uniform as is often imagined and because they are subject to different interpretations \ndepending on the social position of the actors. Such divergent understandings are, in turn, rooted in daily experience. \nThe platitudes are not received as disembodied symbolic messages but are given meaning only in the context of a \ncontinuing struggle to defend material interests.29\nThe process by which any system of political or religious beliefs emanating from above is reinterpreted, blended with \npre-existing beliefs, penetrated, and transformed is characteristic of any stratified society. In this sense, one can speak in \nan agrarian society of ''folk\" socialism, \"folk\" nationalism, and \"folk\" communism just as one speaks of folk religion. If \nthe form of Christianity believed in and practiced in the slave quarters is quite distinctive from the form of Christianity \nbelieved in and taught by the masters, we should not be surprised if tenants have an understanding of paternalism that is \nnot at all like the one\n28.

Giddens writes that one of his \"leading theorems\" is that \"every social \nactor knows a great deal about the conditions of reproduction of the society of which he or she is a member.\" \nCentral Problems, 5 and see also 72.\n29. The failure to link ideology with actual class experience is often responsible for unwarranted conclusions. As \nAbercrombie et al., Dominant Ideology Thesis, 141, analyzing the research of others, concludes, \"Workers will \noften agree with dominant elements, especially when these are couched as abstract principles or refer to general \nsituations, which is normally the case in interview surveys using standardized questionnaires, but will then accept \ndeviant values when they themselves are directly involved or when these are expressed in concrete terms which \ncorrespond to everyday reality.\" They go on to note that the \"confusion\" in working-class ideology is no more than \none may find among dominant groups.

Deviant interpretationsideological heterodoxyare hardly astonishing when they \narise among subordinate classes which, by definition, have the least stake in the official description of reality.31\nOne may perhaps take this logic one step further and contend, as some have, that the normative incorporation of \nsubordinate classes is simply \"not a necessary requirement of social order.\"32 Abercrombie and his collaborators, in \ntheir general critique of \"the dominant ideology thesis,\" make a persuasive case that neither capitalism nor feudalism \nhas been successful in achieving the internalization of the dominant ideology by subordinate classes. They explain this \nfailure by the weakness of the mechanisms of socialization (another name for the strength of resistance?) and by the \neffectiveness of other forms of coercion, including the constraints that produce what we have earlier called \"routine \ncompliance.\" From this perspective, the function of the dominant ideology may be largely to secure the cohesion of \ndominant classes, while the conformity of subordinate classes rests instead primarily on their knowledge that any other \ncourse is impractical, dangerous, or both.\nIf this logic is applicable to the working class in advanced capitalist nations, as is claimed, then it is surely more \nforcefully applicable to the working class of early capitalism and to the peasantry of the Third World. This is so because \nthe institutional bases of hegemonyfor example, schools, mediaare simply thicker on the ground in late capitalism and \npresumably therefore more effective.33 By contrast, the early working class was, by most accounts, virtually\n30.

As Engels observed in his \nstudy of the nineteenth-century English working class:\nThe workers speak other dialects, have other thoughts and ideals, other customs and moral principles, a \ndifferent religion and other politics than those of the bourgeoisie. Thus they are two radically dissimilar \nnations as unlike as difference of race could make them.34\nThe peasantry, if anything, is even further removed from the institutional circuits of symbolic power. Living outside the \ncities where the agencies of hegemony are quartered, operating largely within an oral tradition that somewhat insulates \nit from printed media, being an old class (unlike the proletariat) with its own cultural traditions and patterns of \nresistance, and having its own shadow institutions (for example, informal religious schools, rituals, and festivals), the \npeasantry is simply less accessible to hegemonic practice. When we add to this the fact that the material and symbolic \ninterests of poor peasants are likely to make them skeptical of a dominant ideology that rationalizes their material \ndeprivation and low status, we can appreciate why they might resist \"symbolic incorporation.\"\nThe fact that the penetration of official reality by the poor is so apparent in the case of Sedaka is reason to wonder how \nit could escape notice in any other comparable situation. It could, however, be overlooked if one observed only the \npublic encounters between rich and poor (\"the partial transcript\") and ignored entirely the insinuations beneath the \nsurface, the discussion outside the context of power relations, and the anonymous, quiet acts of routine practical \nresistance that occur daily.35 For it is in the immediate interest of most poor villagers to uphold the official realities in \nnearly all power-laden contexts. The partial transcript, taken alone, therefore would create the impression of \nmystification. But we would commit the error of not realizing that mystification and impression management are as \nmuch a pose of the powerless as ideological domination by\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nFor example, see the fascinating discussion of \"peripheral spirits\" and forms of possession that characterize \nwomen and also men of low status in many societies in I.

Gramsci is, I believe, misled when he claims that the radicalism of subordinate classes is to be found more in \ntheir acts than in their beliefs. It is more nearly the reverse. The realm of behaviorparticularly in power-laden \nsituationsis precisely where dominated classes are most constrained. And it is at the level of beliefs and \ninterpretationswhere they can safely be venturedthat subordinate classes are least trammeled. The rich in Sedaka can \nusually insist on conforming public behavior and get it; they can neither insist on private ideological conformity, nor do \nthey need it.36\nInevitability, Naturalization, and Justice\nThere is another more sophisticated and influential argument for mystification and false-consciousness that does not \ndepend upon the presumed ability of dominant classes to impose their own beliefs on subordinate classes. If the idea of \nhegemony implies something that is done to lower orders by those above them, this second position implies that \nmystification is something that subordinate classes do, in part at least to themselves, given the force of circumstances. \nBriefly put, the argument is that a system of social domination often appears to be inevitable. Once it is considered \ninevitable, the logic goes, it is apt to be considered natural even by those who are disadvantaged by it, and there is a \ntendency to consider whatever is natural also to be just or legitimate. The most limited statement of this position, one \nthat omits the last step and carefully avoids equating natural with legitimate, is found in Richard Hoggart's fine analysis \nof English working-class culture:\nWhen people feel that they cannot do much about the main elements of their situation, feel it not necessarily \nwith despair or disappointment or resentment, but simply as a fact of life, they adopt attitudes toward that \nsituation which allow them to have a liveable life under its shadow, a life without a constant and pressing \nsense of the larger situation. The attitudes remove the main elements in the situation to the realm of natural \nlaws, the given and now, the almost implacable material from which a living has to be carved. Such attitudes, \nat their least adored, a fatalism or plain accepting, are generally below the tragic level; they have too much of \nthe conscript's lack of choice about them.37\nBarrington Moore, who is more generally concerned with historical patterns of systematic subordination, does not \nhesitate to take the final step of associating inevitability with justice and legitimacy:\n36.

Otherwise the pain might \nbe intolerable.38\nPiven and Cloward echo Moore's assessment in their study of poor people's movements in the United States:\nHowever hard their lot may be, people usually remain quiescent, conforming to the accustomed patterns of \ndaily life in their community, and believing those patterns to be both inevitable and just.39\nWhat is described appears to be akin to the \"naturalization\" of the inescapablea reification of the \"dull compulsion of \neconomic relations\" that is here to stay.40 Thus, Bourdieu writes of certain beliefs as being \"unthinkable\" and of the \ninclination of social \"agents\" ''to make a virtue of necessity,\" that is, \"to refuse what is anyway refused and to love the \ninevitable.\"41\nExcept for very rare and special circumstances to which I shall return later, I believe all of these closely related \narguments for mystification to be either misleading or wrongor both. First, they provide no convincing logic for the \nprocess by which the inevitable becomes just.

The \naddition of \"some\" and \"to a degree\" in the second sentence of the citation is a more accurate reflection of his \nposition than the final sentence. It is worth noting that the only reason he gives for the transformation of the \ninevitable into the \"just\" is similar to Hoggart's, namely, the desire of victims to somehow escape the constant \npsychological pain of living in an intolerable situation that must nevertheless be endured.\n39.

It is unlikely, the reasoning goes, that the untouchables in nineteenth-century \nIndia, the serfs in thirteenth-century France, or perhaps even the tenants in Sedaka today could seriously entertain the \npossibility of raising their basic status, let alone of living in a world without castes, lords, or landords. And even if they \ncould, they would be unlikely to devote much time or thought to possibilities that appear to be entirely excluded as \npractical goals. This argument, as I understand it, asks us to believe that, for subordinate classes, the larger structure of \ndomination is typically experienced in the same way a peasant might experience the weather. If we accept this analogy \nfor the sake of argument, it is not at all clear why the weather, which is surely inevitable, unavoidable, and even fated \nshould, on this basis alone, be considered either just or legitimate. It is far more plausible to assume that the concepts of \njustice or legitimacy are simply irrelevant to something that is inescapably there, like the weather. There is no logical \nwarrant for equating justice and inevitability virtually as a matter of definition; in the absence of further evidence, \nwhatever is inevitable is simply that and no more. In fact, the analogy with the weather is instructive at another level. \nThe inevitability of the weather has not prevented every group of traditional cultivators from personifying this natural \nforce or from developing rituals to influence its course or, when their efforts have failed, from cursing their fate. Thus, \nfar from removing it to the realm of the inevitable, the peasantry has historically considered even the weather to be \namenable to human manipulation. If there is any \"mystification\" of natural laws in traditional societies, it is in the \ndirection of bringing them under human control, not the reverse.42\nI shall return to the critique of inevitability later, but first it is worthwhile to consider why inevitability should be so \nfrequently confounded with legitimacy. Appearances, of course, nearly always seem to confirm the legitimacy of the \ninevitable. No matter how conscious members of a subordinate class may be of having gotten a raw deal, the daily \npressure of making a living and the risks of open defiance are usually enough to skew the ethnographic record \nsystematically in the direction of compliance, if not acceptance, of the inevitable. Here again, however, resignation to \nwhat seems inevitable is not the same as according it legitimacy, although it may serve just as efficiently to produce \ndaily compliance. A certain tone of resignation is entirely likely in the face of a situation that cannot, in the short run, be \nmaterially altered. When the poor in Sedaka talk about combine-harvesters and say, \"It doesn't matter whether you \nprotest or not,\n42.

To prove the case for \nideological supportfor hegemonyone would have to supply independent evidence that the values of the subordinate class \nare in fact largely in accord with those of the dominant elite. Such evidence, to be credible, would have to come from \nsocial contexts in which members of the subordinate class were least constrained by power relations.\nThere is another reason why the ethnographic record, even where it is collected with a view to minimizing the \nconstraints of power, may be skewed in the direction of apparent acceptance. This is because the record is invariably \noriented toward the quotidian and rarely contains much discussion of options that seem out of reach.44 The \nsmallholders in Sedaka, for example, do not talk about land reform. When I raised the subject with them, however, they \nwere almost uni-\n43. Thus Abercrombie, Hill, and Turner, in their analysis of the \"quiescence\" of the English working class in \nthe decades just after 1850, find no evidence of effective indoctrination or normative approval, but rather a \n\"factual\" acceptance of \"the economic order of capitalism and its class based social organization.\" Dominant \nIdeology Thesis, 122). John Gaventa, in his study of Appalachian coal miners, also finds an attitude of \nresignation and even demoralization. But this attitude, far from being evidence of ideological hegemony or \napproval, ''is not irrational. . . . It has been instilled historically through repeated experiences of failure.\" \nPower and Powerlessness: Quiescence and Rebellion in an Appalachian Valley (Urbana: Univ. of Illinois \nPress, 1980), 254. Finally, Alier's detailed analysis of Andalusian farm workers carefully distinguishes \ncompliance from legitimacy. \"Andalusian labourers choose conduct which is compatible with the \nmaintenance of latifundismo and the social structure based upon it; but they also have values which would \nresult in conduct incompatible with its maintenance. If they do not adopt these forms of conduct, it is because \nof controls, which are not social sanctions derived from the agro-town's value system, but rather political \ncontrols exercised from the provincial capital and from Madrid, and because they remember with fear the \nperiod after 1936.\" Labourers and Landowners in Southern Spain, 31415.\n44. It is just such attention to the quotidian that gives rise to the notion that traditional social structures are \naccepted as a matter of fatalismin Malay, rezeki. There is surely no doubt that, as a practical matter, adaptation to \ncircumstances that cannot be changed, at least in the short run, imposes itself coercively. To conclude that this is \nthe end of the matter, however, is not warranted, as we shall see below.\n  \n< previous page\npage_325\nnext page >\n",

But it was not a subject that ever arose spontaneously, since it was purely academic; \nit had never been broached by either of the political parties with which they are familiar nor by agricultural officials. \nTheir attention was, instead, more realistically focused on the possibility of securing a reasonable tenancy within the \nexisting system of landownership.45 However desirable, it is simply not a realistic goal under present circumstances.\nFrom a much more modest view of what hegemony is all about, it might be said that the main function of a system of \ndomination is to accomplish precisely this: to define what is realistic and what is not realistic and to drive certain goals \nand aspirations into the realm of the impossible, the realm of idle dreams, of wishful thinking. There is surely a good \ndeal to be said for this limited construction of hegemony, since it recognizes the vital impact of power on the definition \nof what is practical. If we adopt this more plausible notion of hegemony, however, at least two qualifications are in \norder. First, we are no longer speaking of justice and legitimacy, but only of the more or less rational understanding of \nwhat is achievable in a given situation. Second, and more important, this view is decidedly static, as it systematically \nexcludes from our analysis just how the realm of the possible might, in new circumstances, be expanded.46 While it is \ntrue that the poor in Sedaka do not now consider land reform a real option, it is also true that their view of current \ninequities, their resentment of large landowners, and their off-the-record bitterness all suggest powerfully that they \nmight well become enthusiastic supporters of land reform if it were to become a historical option. What is nothing more \nthan idle speculation today may become a realistic goal tomorrow, and we will best infer the possible response of the \npeasantry not from what they now consider possible but rather from their overall evaluation of the social order within \nwhich they live.47 One would not expect, for example, to find French peasants talking, in 1788, about the chateaux they \nwould be sacking in 1789 or Russian peasants discussing, in 1916, the land seizures they would be carrying out the \nfollowing year. What one could have found in all likelihood, however, were attitudes about the aristocracy and land \nrights that were entirely consistent with their later actions.\n45. I recognize that no social context is entirely free from power relations. The opinions expressed by the \npowerless are often constrained as well by the opinions of their peers. There is no \"true\" transcript in the sense \nof a transcript that is entirely unconstrained. What I am comparing here are relative degrees of constraint.\n46. Andalusian workers, similarly, do not often speak of reparto, or land distribution, although it was at one time \nlong ago a real option and is still considered the only just solution to inequity.\n47. Here I bracket temporarily the fact that it is often the action of subordinate classes that may be influential in \ncreating new possibilities, including often those not foreseen by the actors themselves.\n  \n< previous page\npage_326\nnext page >\n",

This is the case that Barrington Moore makes on the basis of accounts from Nazi concentration camps and, \nto a lesser extent, accounts of the Hindu caste system. He contends that there are situations in which oppression is \nexercised so totally and so pervasively that the poses so often necessary to the powerlessflattery, deference, and so \nforthrepresent the whole reality, the whole transcript, of subordinate groups. Noting that \"it is very difficult to act a \nmask or a role continually without acquiring the character that goes with the role,\" he asks, in effect, what happens \nwhen the mask must be worn at all times.48 The question of legitimacy and justice, he implies, hardly arises at all, since \nthe realm of necessity exhausts the whole of human conduct. At this extreme it is possible to show, as Moore does, that \nsome victims do indeed come to identify with the oppressor and to copy both his behavior and his values.49 But the \nvery extremity of the measures required to achieve this end make it, for my purpose, precisely the exception that proves \nthe rule. As the most total of institutions, the Nazi concentration camp systematically set about destroying every vestige \nof independent social life. The victims, before they were murdered, were stripped of all possessions and family, worked \nto the extremes of exhaustion, underfed to\n48. Another way of phrasing this issue is to focus on the unavoidable dualityor multiplicityof subordinate \nclass consciousness. Much of the daily struggle to make a living, as we have seen in the case of Hamzah and \nothers, necessarily involves appeals to the normative system of the dominant classflattery, deference, \nobsequious polite forms of address, and so forth. There will almost invariably be other offstage values as well \nthat may contradict such poses. And yet, we are not entirely justified in treating the former as merely insincere \nposes and the latter as the truth. In situations where the exercise of power is quite pervasive, the offstage \ndiscourse may be confined to the nooks and crannies of social life, thereby making the formulas for action \nimposed by elites hegemonic in practice. Arnold Strickon, writing of an Argentine agro-town, notes that the \ngauchos have two sets of stratification terms: one is cast entirely in patron-client terms, the other is class \nbased. The first, however, dominates daily life in the local context; it is both explanatory and strategic for \nlower-class action. The second is more appropriate to the rare occasions of provincial and national elections. \nAn observer might plausibly conclude that traditional, clientelist consciousness dominated, but this conclusion \nwould merely amount to the observation that the situational context relevant to that style of action was \ndominant. If the situational context relevant to class discourse were to become more frequent, so would class \nterminology and action. What one would be observing then would be not so much a change in consciousness \nper se as a shift in the relative frequency of situational contexts relevant to one style of action as opposed to \nanother. \"Folk Models of Stratification, Political Ideology, and Socio-cultural Systems,\" Sociological Review \nMonographs, No. 11 (1967), 93117.\n49.

No effort was spared to destroy all networks of informal solidarity and thoroughly to atomize the \nprisoners. Virtually the only autonomous choice left was that of suicide. What is remarkable is not that such extremity \nproduces a certain \"identification with the oppressor\" but rather that only \"some concentration camp inmates came to \naccept the moral authority of their oppressors.\"50\nOne might, in this context, compare different forms of oppression by the degree to which they allow their victims some \nsemblance of an autonomous social existence. By this criterion, the concentration camp would lie at one extreme, \nfollowed perhaps by mental asylums and civilian and military prisons. Here one might plausibly expect that atomization \nand nearly total control might achieve a perverse moral authority.51 The fact is, however, that all of the \"routine\" and \nhistorically common patterns of social subordination and exploitationslavery, serfdom, sharecropping, or even wage \nlaborare unlike the concentration camp in that their \"victims\" retain considerable autonomy to construct a life and a \nculture not entirely controlled by the dominant class.52 In other words there are, for each of these groups, situations in \nwhich the mask of obsequiousness, deference, and symbolic compliance may be lifted. This realm of relatively \"safe'' \ndiscourse, however narrow, is a necessary condition for the development of symbolic resistancea social space in which \nthe definitions and performances imposed by domination do not prevail.53 This social space is, moreover, defined not \nonly by the absence of vertical power relations but by the presence of sanctions and influence exercised by others who \nfind themselves in the same boat.54 Thus,\n50. In his analysis, Moore (Injustice, 64) relies heavily on Bruno Bettelheim, The Informed Heart: Autonomy \nin a Mass Age (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1960). For an account of how various forms of moral and organized \nresistance can grow in only slightly less draconian conditions, see Emmanuel Rigelblum, Notes From the \nWarsaw Ghetto, trans. Jacob Sloan (New York: Schocken, 1974).\n51. Especially, perhaps, in mental institutions and civilian prisons where there is at least an ideology claiming that \nthey are operated for the ultimate benefit of their inmates. Even here, however, control is not total and resistance is \nevident. See, for example, Erving Goffman, Asylums (New York: Anchor Books, Doubleday, 1961), and Jack \nHenry Abbot, In the Belly of the Beast (New York: Vintage, 1982).\n52. Such autonomy, it is often pointed out, is not simply a failure of control but is necessary to the very \nfunctioning of the institution.\n53. The dominant class may make efforts to infiltrate this social space with spies. The effect of such spies may be \nless the information they carry back than the way in which the fear of spies itself may neutralize a possible realm \nof autonomous discourse.\n54. The monoclass village under the domination of a single outside landlord thus has marked advantages for class \nmobilization that are not confined to the fact that the material situation of all villagers is more or less the same. \nThey also have a realm of autonomous discourse that is coterminous with the village itself.\n  \n< previous page\npage_328\nnext page >\n",

This influence is stronger by virtue of the fact that \nthese men also depend on one another for a wide array of petty favors and exchanges; there are power relations here too, \nalthough they are more nearly reciprocal and balanced. If the exercise of domination depends upon a social context for \nits creation and maintenance, so does the exercise of resistance.55\nIt is, of course, theoretically possible for the discourse found even in \"non-mask\" situations to conform in most or all \nparticulars with the dominant ideology. But whenever we are dealing with any of the large-scale structures of social \nsubordination, which invariably imply both the appropriation of labor and the assignment of inferior, if not degrading, \nstatus to its subjects, this is unlikely. Thus, there is some evidence that the untouchable castes in India, when they may \ndo so safely, reject much of the stigmatized identity assigned to them by the caste system.56 The work of Genovese and \nothers reveals that, in the slave quarters of the antebellum South, one encountered a set of values very different from \nthose that officially prevailed.57 There was a religious emphasis on liberation and equality drawn from Old Testament \ntexts, a profane view both of the masters and of slavery, justifications for resistance in the form of theft, pilfering, flight, \nand shirking. Not all of these attitudes were incompatible, as Genovese notes, with the continuation of slavery as a \nsystem, but they were decidedly different from the dominant ideology. The subculture created in the slave quarter was \nnormally hidden from the master's view. It might, however, occasionally intrude onto the public stage when strong drink \ntemporarily overcame the slaves' normal caution. As Mullin notes in his study of slavery in nineteenth-century Virginia:\nWhile drunkenness tends to leave most people either quiet and withdrawn, or out-going and loud-spoken, \nacculturating slaves when drunk and addressing their masterswith no exceptionswere always \"bold,\" \n\"obstinate,\" \"daring,'' \"impudent,\" or \"turbulent.\"58\nExcept for those rare instances when the curtain is momentarily parted, the\n55.

Given its shadowy but \npalpable existence in informal discourse, this subculture is unlikely to be a systematic refutation of the dominant \nideology. One does not expect Das Kapital to come from working-class pubs, although one may get something quite \nclose to the labor theory of value! Unless the curtains are parted by open revolt, political freedoms, or a revolution that \nallows the subculture to take on a public, institutionalized life, it will remain elusive and masked. What is certain, \nhowever, is that, while domination may be inevitable as a social fact, it is unlikely also to be hegemonic as an ideology \nwithin that small social sphere where the powerless may speak freely.\nMy argument to this point has focused on the danger of equating the possible fact of inevitability with the norms of \njustice and legitimacy, even though the ethnographic record may encourage it. I have also stressed the importance, in \nanything short of total institutions, of an autonomous sphere in which the values of elites may be contested despite their \npractical inevitability. Completing this critique requires that I also reexamine the concept of inevitability itself, a term I \nhave thus far taken for granted. The question is not whether or not a given structure of domination is inevitable at a \nfactual level, since no historically contingent state of affairs is inevitable in that sense. The question is rather the extent \nto which a system of domination can be made to appear inevitable to those who live in it and under it.\nThe first problem is to specify exactly what it is that is \"inevitable.\" If it is taken to mean a pattern of domination in all \nits historical particulars, then it is clear that no system is inevitable to its subjects in this sense. To imagine that long-\nestablished systems such as feudalism or slavery were, even in their heyday, so inevitable that those who lived within \nthem were not constantly tryingand succeedingto modify their contours is to ascribe an unwarranted \"thingness\" to any \nsocial order.\nIf, however, by \"inevitable\" we mean the central features of a mode of domination, not just its details, then the argument \nfor perceived inevitability becomes far more plausible. From one perspective, the argument is in fact both self-evident \nand coercive. How would it be possible for a thirteenth-century French serf or an eighteenth-century Indian \nuntouchable, neither of whom we may assume had any experience of any social order other than the one into which he \nwas born, to conceive of anything else than what he knew, namely, feudalism or the caste system? It is but a short \nlogical step to claim that these cognitive limitations rule out, in principle, any possible revolutionary consciousness. If \nthe fish do not talk about the water, how can we expect them to talk about the air?

It is on the day when we are able to conceive of \nanother state of affairs, that a new light is cast on our trouble and our suffering and we decide that they are \nunbearable.59\nThis position is, I believe, quite wrong. On my reading of the evidence it is in fact more plausible to contend that so far \nas the realm of ideology is concerned, no social order seems inevitable, even in this larger sense, to all of its subjects. \nThe fact that serfs, slaves, or untouchables have no direct knowledge or experience of other social orders is, I believe, \nno obstacle to their creating what would have to qualify as \"revolutionary\" thought. To argue along these lines is not so \nmuch to refute Sartre as it is to show that the imaginative capacity of subordinate groups to reverse and/or negate \ndominant ideologies is so widespreadif not universalthat it might be considered part and parcel of their standard cultural \nand religious equipment. Here again we may stand Gramsci on his head; subordinate classesespecially the peasantryare \nlikely to be more radical at the level of ideology than at the level of behavior, where they are more effectively \nconstrained by the daily exercise of power.\nThe argument against inevitability may be made at two levels. As I have made this case at much greater length \nelsewhere, I shall confine myself to a summary exposition.60 The first point to be made is that, even if one accepts that \nthe serf, the slave, and the untouchable will have trouble imagining social arrangements other than feudalism, slavery, \nor caste, they will certainly not find it difficult to imagine reversing the distribution of status and rewards within that \nsocial order. In a great many societies, such a simple feat of the imagination is not just an abstract exercise: It is \nhistorically embedded in existing ritual practice. To mention but a few, the Feast of Krishna (Holl) in large parts of \nIndia, Carnival in Western and Latin American Roman Catholic societies, Saturnalia in Roman society, the variant of \nthe water festival in Buddhist Southeast Asia, Dionysian cults in antiquityall involve to a considerable extent a reversal \nof status, the breaking of routine codes of deference, and the profanation of the existing social order. In some forms, \nthese rituals of reversal may be seen as a sanctioned and contained ritual effort to relieve temporarily the tension \nunavoidably produced by a rigid hierarchy. To stop here, however, would ignore both the degree to which such rituals \noften get out of hand and the strenuous attempts made by dominant elites to eliminate or restrict them. The centuries-\nlong campaign of Roman Catholic authorities to eliminate the pagan aspects of carnivalburlesques of the mass, \nhedonismand to replace them with the passion plays and more orthodox ritual is a striking example.\n59.

This is precisely what is involved in nearly all of the millennial religious ideologies that have \nformed the normative underpinning of a host of large-scale peasant revolts throughout history. Such movements are \noften closely linked to the reversals discussed earlier, but they are not so easily dismissed as empty rituals, given their \npractical consequences for political control. The radical vision contained in millennial and utopian ideologies can best \nbe understood as a negation of the existing pattern of exploitation and status degradation as it is experienced. At the risk \nof overgeneralizing, one can say that this reflexive symbolism often implies a society of brotherhood in which there will \nbe no rich or poor and no distinctions of rank (save those between believers and nonbelievers). Property is typically, \nthough not always, to be held in common and shared. Unjust claims to taxes, rents, and tribute are to be nullified. The \nenvisioned utopia may also include a self-yielding and abundant nature as well as a radically transformed human nature \nin which greed, envy, and hatred will disappear. While the earthly utopia is an anticipation of the future, it often harks \nback to a mythic Eden from which mankind has fallen away. It is no exaggeration to see in such historically common \nideologies a revolutionary appropriation of religious symbolism in the service of class interests.\nMillennial and utopian thought typically make their appearance in the archives only when they take the form of sects or \nmovements that pose a threat to the state. In this respect, the written record is as negligent of ordinary forms of symbolic \nresistance as it is of everyday material resistance. The prophetic tradition that underlies such sects may remain dormant \nand peripheral for long periods. But, as Marc Bloch observed, the tradition is both continuous and deeply rooted in \npopular culture. Citing peasant revolts in France from 821 through \"the blazing summer of 1789,\" which Taine had \ndescribed as \"spontaneous anarchy,\" Bloch writes:\nBut there was nothing novel about this \"anarchy.\" What appeared a newly-minted outrage in the eyes of the ill-\ninstructed philosopher was little more than the recurrence of a traditional phenomenon which had long been \nendemic. The forms rebellion took (and they were nearly always the same) were also traditional: mystical \nfantasies: a powerful preoccupation with the primitive egalitarianism of the Gospels, which took hold of \nhumble minds well before the Reformation.61\nThe circumstances under which these beliefs triggered mass action had, to modern eyes, all the marks of revolutionary \ncrises.

The \nderoutinization of daily life, in which the normal categories with which social reality is apprehended no longer apply, \nappears to be as important as material deprivation in creating the social soil for millennial activity.\nIt has occasionally been assumed that millenarianism is a particular product of the prophetic and apocalyptic tradition of \nthe Judeo-Christian world. And yet we find parallel religious traditions in both the Buddhist and Islamic regions of \nSoutheast Asia, as well as in the largely Christian Philippines. In Burma, for example, a belief in the return of a just \nking (Setkya min) who will return to set things aright exists side by side with a belief in a Buddha-Deliverer (Buddha \nyaza) who will usher in a Buddhist millennium. In Islamic Indonesia, we encounter both a traditional belief in a \nreturning monarch-savior (ratu adil) and a traditional belief in an Islamic conqueror who will sweep away the heathen \nand restore justice. The belief in a returning just king, similar to that of the tsardeliverer in Russia, represents a striking \nexample of how an erstwhile conservative myth of divine kingship can, in the hands of the peasantry, be turned into a \nrevolutionary myth by a kind of symbolic jujitsu. While kingship per se is symbolically maintained, both the actual king \nand the social order he represents are negated. It goes without saying that these religious traditions in Southeast Asia \nhave also formed the ideological basis for countless rebellions.63\nThe paradox of millennial beliefs is of course that they typically envision the most radical change in the distribution of \npower, status, and wealthnot to mention human naturewhile at the same time being very much leadership centered. At \nthe center of virtually all such movements is a leader, a prophet, a just king, a savior, who will set things right. \nCompared to everyday forms of resistance that avoid direct symbolic confrontations in the interest of concrete, \npiecemeal gains, millennial beliefs are all-or-nothing affairs64 which, once activated, aim at changing the society root \nand branch. As such they are inherently extralocal and depend on a shared collective history, with its antiestablishment \nsymbols and myths.\n62. Norman Cohn, The Pursuit of the Millennium (London: Seecker & Warburg, 1957), 32.\n63. For examples from Burma and Indonesia, see E.

Not a few millennial sects have historically settled into the social fabric as more or less permanent, district \ncommunities that aim either to live their own lives in relative isolation from the rest of society or to transform the \nworld merely by their example of piety, etc. A peaceful outcome seems to depend at least as much on how the sect \nis treated by the state as on its initial beliefs.\n  \n< previous page\npage_333\nnext page >\n",

Occasionally, prophesies circulate in the form of \n\"flying letters\" (surat layang) of anonymous authorshipletters purportedly written at some sacred Islamic site in the \nMiddle East under the inspiration of a vision or dream. (One such surat layang came into my hands and is reproduced in \ntranslation in appendix E.) In 1969, after racial riots had erupted in several Malaysian cities, a climate of fearful \nanticipation swept much of Kedah. Local religious figures, politicians, and those versed in the traditional Malay art of \nself-defense (silat) joined a group called the Red Sash Society (Pertubohan Selendang Merah), a body with shadowy \nconnections to UMNO politicians in the national capital. Its purpose was to defend the race and the religion. To this \nend, an \"oathing\" ceremony was held for at least forty men from Sedaka and Sungai Tongkang in the house of Haji \nSalim, now a prominent UMNO official in the district. Someone claiming to have been sent from Kuala Lumpur \nconducted an initiation, using chants (jampi), anointment with lime juice and water, and a demonstration of how the red \nsash worn by members would render them invulnerable to wounds from a machete (golok). In the end, the unrest did not \nspread to Kedah and the group never went into action.\nThe point of this brief account of prophesy and religious mobilization in Sedaka is not to claim that such exceptional \nevents preoccupy villagers. They do not. It is rather to suggest only that prophesy and religious mobilization are a part, \nhowever dormant in relatively ordinary times, of the cultural equipment of the Malay peasantry. In 1979 a shadowy \norganization (Nasrul Haq) which, it was said, had thirty thousand members in Kedah was banned. The government \nclaimed that it had political connections as well as teaching silat (self-defense) and that its \"un-Islamic\" promotion of \nmagical chants, trances, and female participation as well as unorthodox dress made it a threat to public order. A \nmystical cult named Auratis mailiyyah, which developed in the poor Kedah district of Sik and about which far less is \nknown, was outlawed by an Islamic (Syariah) court at about the same time.65 For Malaysia as a whole, Stockwell has \ndocumented the reappearance of millennial and ecstatic Islamic cults during virtually every episode of historical \ncrisis.66 Had I attended more carefully to it,\n65.

The historical fact is that they can and do. All three of the claims examined in this section have \nproved to be untenable. There is no basis for supposing that subordinate classes equate the inevitable with the just, \nalthough the necessity of pragmatic resignation may often make it seem so. There is no basis for imagining that any of \nthe common historical patterns of domination so completely control the social life of subordinate classes as to rule out \nthe creation of partly autonomous and resistant subcultures. Finally, there is no reason to assume that the lower orders \nare so encompassed by an existing system of domination that they cannot either imagine its revolutionary negation or \nact on that negation.\nConflict within Hegemony\nFor the sake of argument, I have thus far taken for granted what I believe to be the core assumption of the case for \nhegemony and false-consciousness. Put bluntly, the assumption is that, to the extent dominant classes can persuade \nsubordinate classes to adopt their self-serving view of existing social relations, the result will be ideological consensus \nand harmony that will in turn block the perception of conflicting interests, let alone class conflict. Hegemony is, after \nall, fundamentally about the misrepresentation of \"objective\" interests. Once this assumption is granted, we find \nourselves inquiring if and how subordinate classes can penetrate, neutralize, and negate that hegemony. But is the initial \npremise credible? I believe it is not credible for at least three reasons, one of which is theoretical or conceptual and two \nof which are empirical. The theoretical problem requires our prior attention, as it stems from what I take to be a \nmisunderstanding of the nature of any purported hegemonic ideology.\nThis misunderstanding can best be grasped by recalling the basic feature of\n67. Rarely a month goes by without a newspaper account of the prosecution of a religious teacher accused of \npropagating false doctrines. In 1979 one such teacher, a Cambodian Muslim, led an attack of his disciples on a \npolice station in the state of Pahang.\n68. The belief in invulnerability, produced both by magic and by the aid of divine sanction, is a standard feature of \nmost millennial practices. It also illustrates a final, key element of the negation of inevitability. The effect of \nmillennial ideology is not only to negate the social order itself but also to negate the very power that serves to keep \nthat social order in place. Of course, the conquest of inevitability at the level of religious ideology is, alas, not the \nsame as its conquest in practice, as the fate of the vast majority who have joined such rebellions tragically attests.\n  \n< previous page\npage_335\nnext page >\n",

The struggle is, in other words, within what most observers would call an existing hegemony.69 \nSmallholders, petty tenants, and landless laborers are continually using the values and rationale of that earlier social \norder to press their claims and disparage the claims of their opponents. They make abundant use of the values of help \n(tolong) or assistance that rich villagers have typically used to describe their own behavior. They stigmatize the rich as \nstingy and hardhearted, thereby turning the values of generosity and liberality against those who justified their property \nand privilege in just such terms. They insist, albeit in vain, on their right to employment and to tenancies, which the \nlarge landowners once claimed to bestow upon them out of a sense of helpfulness. In each respect, the claims of the \npoor derive their normative force and strategic value from the fact that lip service is still being paid to them by the \nlocally dominant elite. There is virtually no radical questioning of property rights or of the state and its local officials, \nwhose policies are designed to further capitalist agriculture. Almost everything said by the poor fits easily within the \nprofessed valueswithin the hegemonyof local elites. And if the ends sought by the village poor are modest, so are the \nmeans used to accomplish them. The modesty of means, however, is less a consequence of small ambitions than of \nother givensthe presence of economic alternatives, the fact of \"dull compulsion,\" and the knowledge of probable \nrepression.\nShort of the deroutinizing crises that are said to touch off millennial expectations, such modest claims may be found at \nthe core of most class conflict. Nor are such small demands incompatible with more violent and even revolutionary \naction when conditions permit. There is, in other words, no necessary symmetry between modesty of ends and modesty \nof means. The claims can be said to arise from the inevitable gap between the promises that any hegemony necessarily \nmakes and the equally inevitable failure of the social order to fulfill some or all of these promises. Properly understood, \nany hegemonic ideology provides, within itself, the raw material for contradictions and conflict.\nTo appreciate why this is so, we need only turn to the implications of the passage from The German Ideology quoted at \nlength earlier. \"The ruling ideas {that is, the hegemonic ideology} are nothing more than the ideal expression of the \ndominant material relationships.\" Gramsci understood, far better than many of his successors, precisely what was \ninvolved in idealizing the dominant material relationships:\nUndoubtedly, the fact of hegemony presupposes that account be taken of\n69. There is a problem with the term hegemony itself since it often implies that a hegemonic ideology is the \nsole creation of an elite, whereas in fact it is always the creation of prior struggle and compromises that are \ncontinually being tested and modified. See, in this connection, the illuminating discussion of \"counterpoints\" \nin W. F. Wertheim, Evolution or Revolution (London: Pelican Books, 1973).\n  \n< previous page\npage_336\nnext page >\n",

But there is also no doubt that such sacrifices and such a compromise cannot touch \nthe essential; for though hegemony is ethical-political, it must also be economic.70\nThus, a hegemonic ideology requires, by definition, that what are in fact particular interests be reformulated and \npresented as general interests. If it is to become an effective instrument of consent, it must meet two criteria. First, it \nmust claim that the system of privilege, status, and property it defends operates in the interest not only of elites but also \nof subordinate groups whose compliance or support is being elicited. To do this it must, in effect, make implicit \npromises of benefits for subordinate groups that will serve as the stake which they too have in the prevailing social \norder.71 Second, as Gramsci realized, the dominant class must make good on at least a portion of these promises if it is \nto have the slightest hope of gaining compliance. That is, hegemony is not just a symbolic bone tossed to subordinate \ngroups; it requires some actual sacrifices or restraint by the dominant groups.\nThe dominant ideology that developed before double-cropping in Kedah and that still, by and large, prevails as a \nnormative framework may be understood in just these terms. The large farmers rationalized their social status, their \nproperty, and their privileges by emphasizing the benefits they provided for the rest of the villagetenancies, wage labor, \ncharity, loans, feasts, zakat. This rationalization was embedded in concrete material practices and entailed a modest \nsocialization of their profit in the interest of continued domination. For the issue at hand, it matters not that this \nrationalization and the practices associated with\n70. Gramsci, Selections, 161.\n71. Writing of the state in particular, later in the same essay, Gramsci makes a similar observation about dominant \nideologies:\n{The winning party brings} about a unison of economic and political aims, but also, intellectual and \nmoral unity, posing all the questions around which the struggle rages not on a corporate but on a \n\"universal\" plane, and thus creating the hegemony of fundamental social group over a series of \nsubordinate groups. . . . In other words, the dominant group is coordinated concretely with the general \ninterests of the subordinate groups, and the life of the State is conceived of as a continuous process of \nformation and superseding of unstable equilibria . . . between the interests of the fundamental group and \nthose of the subordinate groupsequilibria in which the interests of the dominant group prevail, but only \nup to a certain point, i.e. stopping short of narrowly corporate economic interest.\nSelections, 18182. Thus a key function of the dominant ideology is to discipline elites so that their short-run \ninterests do not jeopardize the stability of the social order as a whole.\n  \n< previous page\npage_337\nnext page >\n",

The crucial \npoint is rather that the very process of attempting to legitimate a social order by idealizing it always provides its subjects \nwith the means, the symbolic tools, the very ideas for a critique that operates entirely within the hegemony. For most \npurposes, then, it is not at all necessary for subordinate classes to set foot outside the confines of the ruling ideals in \norder to formulate a critique of power. The most common form of class struggle arises from the failure of a dominant \nideology to live up to the implicit promises it necessarily makes. The dominant ideology can be turned against its \nprivileged beneficiaries not only because subordinate groups develop their own interpretations, understandings, and \nreadings of its ambiguous terms, but also because of the promises that the dominant classes must make to propagate it in \nthe first place.72\nIn this context, what we find in Sedaka is an eroding dominant ideology that never quite delivered the goods and that \nnow no longer even serves the interests of the larger cultivators. It is therefore a vanishing and even retrograde tradition \nthat has become the ideological weapon by which the rich may be further delegitimated. The irony, of course, is that the \nideological weapon the poor now find so serviceable was earlier fashioned and handed to them by the same rich \ncultivators and landlords. A \"shared\" ideology is by no means a guarantee of consent or harmony.73\nThe structure of ideological conflict in Sedaka is far from unusual. In his searching analysis of slavery in the United \nStates, for example, Genovese has shown how its legal codes and its ideology of paternalismboth violated with impunity \nin practicecame to be used by the slaves themselves to assert their claims for subsistence, humane treatment, and the \npreservation of the slave family. As in Sedaka, a large part of the critique of ruling group practice could be read directly \nfrom the text of ruling group ideology.74 Much the same analysis\n72. See, in this context, Gidden's discussion of the struggle by the working class to universalize what are \noriginally the \"sectional\" interests of the bourgeoisie. Central Problems, 193ff.\n73. Once again, the concept of hegemony is, to my mind, not sufficiently reflexive here, since both the \n\"compromise\" and the \"corporate sacrifices\" are as much won by resistance and struggle as given or imposed by \nan elite. The struggle of subordinate classes, in other words, helps determine what kind of compromise will make \nconsent possible.\n74. See, for example, Frank Parkin, Class Inequality and Political Order (New York: Praeger, 1971), 72102. \nWillis (in Learning to Labour, 110) would go much further and claim that if in fact the dominant class were \nsuccessful in inculcating the dominant ideology it would find itself with far more working-class anger and dissent. \nIn particular, he argues that if English working-class children believed what was taught them at schoolthat is, that \ndoing well in school and following its rules would result in social mobility in a working life where competence \nand skill are\n(footnote continued on next page)\n  \n< previous page\npage_338\nnext page >\n",

This is not to say that neither slaves nor \nPolish workers were able to imagine a social order run along quite different lines. It is only to claim that, in each case, \nthe ideology formulated by the ruling class to justify its own rule provided much of the symbolic raw material from \nwhich the most damning critique could be derived and sustained.\nSimilar logic might be applied to the routine forms of working-class disaffection in advanced capitalist nations. \nAlthough the work force in such countries has easier ideological access to radical alternatives, much of its critique of \nthe social order appears to rest on premises that are also, broadly speaking, drawn from the ruling ideology itself.77 \nWithout straying beyond the prevailing ideology, workers may contrast the meritocratic ethos with the reality of \n\"connections,\" favoritism, and unequal access to superior education; they may contrast the democratic ideology of \"one \nman, one vote\" with the reality of corporate influence on the media and elections; they may contrast the bountiful \npromise of capitalism with periodic recessions and unemployment. The solutions proposed by radical parties and \nintellectuals may, and frequently do, lie outside the dominant ideology. But for my purposes, it is clear that a radical \ncritique of existing arrangements may arise in virtually any subordinate class that takes the dominant ideology to heart \nand, at the same time, penetrates in daily life the realities that betray or ignore the implicit promises of that ideology. On \ncloser inspection,\n(footnote continued from previous page)\nrewardedthey would feel far more cruelly deceived later.

Indeed, \nthose working-class youngsters who pose the greatest problem for school authorities enter the work force \nthoroughly cynical but without aspirations that could possibly be betrayed. Learning to Labour is, in my \nopinion, the finest study available of hegemony in any setting.\n75.

From whom was the feudal lord protecting the serf, if not from other \nmarauding lords like himself? How can the slaveholder be said to provide a \"service\" of subsistence when it is the \nslaves who feed both themselves and him? Such hypocrisies are, however, \"the tribute vice pays to virtue\" and they \nhave real consequences.79 In Sedaka, it is tactically sound for the poor to make their case in terms of older agrarian \nnorms. They are not only the moral categories in which villagers actually think; they also allow the poor to appropriate, \nas it were, the ideological resources of the well-off and turn them to good advantage. Finally, by remaining prudently \nwithin the accepted and familiar categories of moral discourse, the poor minimize the risks of a more dramatic \nconfrontation.\nTrade Union Consciousness and Revolution\nCommon sense is not a single unique conception, identical in time and space. . . . Its most fundamental \ncharacteristic is that it is a conception which, even in the brain of one individual, is fragmentary, incoherent \nand inconsequential, in conformity with the social and cultural position of those masses whose philosophy it is.\nNone the less the starting point must always be that common sense which is the spontaneous philosophy of \nthe multitude and which has to be made ideologically coherent.80\nFor Gramsci and for many other Marxist scholars, the primary obstacle to radical\n78. In his fine study of inmates in a Norwegian prison, Thomas Mathiesen stresses that, while in practice there \nis little peer solidarity, there is a widespread attitude of \"censoriousness.\" By this he means a readiness to \nseize on the norms propagated by the prison officials themselves and accuse them of violating their own \nstandards at every turn. In this case, the progressive (paternalistic?) ideology of prison officials provided \neffective raw material to serve prisoners' interests. The inmates constantly pushed for \"mechanical\" equality, \nautomatic rights, seniority rules, and stated minimum requirements along trade union lines, while prison \nofficials strove to maintain discretionary controls just as management would.

For reasons of \"intellectual subordination,\"81 Gramsci argued, the working \nclass gets most of its ideas secondhand from dominant groups and, by itself, is therefore not able to rise above an \n\"incoherent\" and \"fragmentary\" conception of its situation. The result, at best, is a kind of ''trade union consciousness\" \nfocusing on limited and concrete benefits rather than the \"revolutionary consciousness\" that might make radical change \npossible. It is this ideological shortcoming of the proletariat, of course, that defines the intellectual role of the vanguard \nparty.\nA number of assumptions lie behind this position, each of which requires examination. The first is that dominant classes \ndo, in fact, share a well-defined and coherent ideology. I will not examine this claim here, but it is worth suggesting that \nsuch ideological coherence may be quite rareperhaps even among intellectuals whose stock in trade is the formulation of \nsystems of thought. To what standard of coherence the consciousness of the working class is being compared, in other \nwords, is not entirely clear. A second, and more nearly explicit, assumption is that revolutionary action can follow only \nfrom a thoroughly radical (Marxist?) consciousness that is not only diametrically opposed to the dominant ideology but \nthat envisions an entirely new social order that will take its place. This assumption is certainly true, but tautological, if \nwe define revolutionary action solely in terms of the consciousness of the actors. If, however, we do not adopt this \nsleight of hand, is it correct to assume that a less than revolutionary consciousness will inevitably lead to \naccommodations with the dominant classto reformism and/or \"trade union\" politics?\nWhat I wish to argue briefly here is that there is no necessary relationship between the small and limited demands \ntypical of a \"reformist\" consciousness and the kinds of actions taken to achieve these demands. One may go still further \nand assert with some assurance that the rank-and-file actors in most, if not all, revolutionary situations are in fact \nfighting for rather mundane, if vital, objectives that could in principlebut often not in practicebe accommodated within \nthe prevailing social order. The typical revolutionary crisis is, in other words, brought about by small but essential \ndemands that are experienced by large numbers of people simultaneously and, because they are thwarted, can be \nachieved only by revolutionary action. The making of a revolutionary crisis, to be sure, depends on a host of factors \noutside my immediate concern, but the one factor it does not require is revolutionary ambitions among the rank and file. \nIn this sense there is no fit between ends and means. At one level, this is no more than commonsense; the demands of \nsubordinate classes spring from their daily experience and the material they face. The only reason why this \ncommonplace merits restatement is that so many theoretical discussions appear to assume otherwise and to impose quite \nfanciful ideological requirements on working-class\n81.

Those requirements have, to my knowledge, never been met by any real working class.\nLet us turn briefly to two revolutionary situations and examine the issue of working-class consciousness in each context. \nThe groundwork has been laid by Barrington Moore's analysis of German workers in the Ruhr after World War I who \nparticipated in what he terms \"the closest approximation to a spontaneous proletarian revolution that has taken place in a \nmodern industrial state\"82 and of the Russian proletariat on the eve of the Bolshevik revolution.\nFor Germany, Moore has uncovered some remarkable evidence from open-ended surveys of proletarian values \nconducted around 1912 that allows him to address this issue. Although support for the Social Democratic Party was \ncommon, the hopes and aspirations of workers were largely personal rather than public or political. Among the most \ncommon wishes were those for better wages, enough to eat, decent humane treatment, and, more farfetched, a house of \none's own with some land. These were the modest aspirations of a working class that was already quite radical in its \nactions and would become more so. Those who had joined the socialists were a minority, and the vast majority of them \nwere, it appears, absolutely innocent of socialist theory. Even in the case of coal miners, who, prior to 1914, were the \nmost militant sector of the working class, \"there is not the slightest hint that they were the carriers of revolutionary \nsentiments.\"83\nOver and over again the evidence reveals that the mass of workers was not revolutionary. They did not want \nto overturn the existing social order and replace it with something else, least of all one where ordinary \nworkers would be in charge. They were however, very angry. They were backed into a corner and fought in \nself-defense . . .\nYet even if one grants all those points, from the standpoint of political consequences they do not really matter. \nRevolutionary objectives are generally imposed by leaders on an angry mass that serves to dynamite the old \norder when other conditions make it possible. Indeed, I would hazard a guess that in any of the great \nrevolutions that have succeeded, the mass of the followers has not consciously willed an overturn of the social \norder . . .\nTo the extent that angry little people want something new, it generally amounts to their perception of the old \norder minus the disagreeable and oppressive features that affect them.84\nTo call the issues behind the near revolution in Germany \"bread-and-butter\" issues and petty questions of decent \ntreatment is, as Moore notes, to miss their\n82.

In fact, it is fair to say that the tenacious pursuit of such small goals was \nin part generated because they appeared to lie within the normative framework of the existing order. The claims of the \nGerman working class in this period were not much more ambitious or far-reaching than those of Sedaka's poor. The \nreason why a revolutionary situation prevailed in the former case but not in the latter is due to many other factors; it \ndoes not, however, have anything to do with the presence or absence of revolutionary class consciousness per se.\nThe evidence for working-class demands in Russia immediately before the October revolutionand after the February \nrevolutioncomes from the autonomous demands of factory committees formed all over European Russia.86 Once again \nthey reflect exactly what Lenin would have termed a reformist, trade union consciousness. The most popular demand \nwas for an eight-hour day. Other demands included an end to piecework, a minimum wage, raises, and severance pay in \ncase of dismissal. In the workplace the laborers insisted on politeness from management, on an end to arbitrary fines \ndeducted from their pay, cooking and toilet facilities, and tools supplied by the factory, not the workers. Their most \nradical demand was apparently for the abolition of child labor and discrimination by sex, but they fully supported \ndifferential pay based on skills and experience. These were hardly the kinds of demands that, of themselves, suggested a \nrevolution.87 As Moore summarizes them, \"the whole thrust of these demands . . . was to improve working conditions, \nnot to change them. . . . Once again we see that the workers' idea of a good society . . . is the present order with its most \ndisagreeable features softened or eliminated.\"88\nFurther examples might be added to the weight of evidence herefor example, from the demands of the peasantry in \nMorelos during the Mexican Revolution\n85.

As for the Russian peasantry, their actions were, of course, quite radical, seizing land and burning the homes of \nthe gentry and officials. Their goals, however, were quite modest and parochial. According to one assessment:\nWhile the various elites argued constitutional and policy questions in the capital, the peasants were \nforming their own political order in the countryside. . . . They repudiated the national level, and their \nalternative was something quite different from simply a new version of the modern centralized state. . . . \nPetrograd may well have constituted the center of the national political state, but the peasants were \nboycotting the play and writing the script for their own production.\nJohn H.

Even here, however, we find not only that it is largely absent, but that petty reformist demands are \nquite compatible with revolutionary action. A revolutionary vanguard party may be necessary for revolution to occur, \nbut its necessity does not arise from the need for ideological instruction and consciousness raising among subordinate \nclasses.90 Revolutionary conflict, so far as the rank and file is concerned, is normally generated within the confines of \nthe existing hegemony. It is often only the means employed that are out of the ordinary. This observation is at least as \napplicable to peasant movements as to proletarian.\nAs Hobsbawm quite correctly observes, \"Revolution may be made de facto by peasants who do not deny the legitimacy \nof the existing power structure, law, the state, or even the landlords.\"91 The peasantry of Morelos, as a case in point, set \nout merely to recover communal lands the sugar haciendas had taken from them, not to destroy the hacienda system, let \nalone transform the Mexican state. Their dogged persistence in recovering their land, however, helped bring about both \nof these larger consequences. Just as small and uncoordinated acts of petty resistance may aggregate to a point where \nthey jeopardize state structures, so may petty, reformist, \"ideological\" goals aggregate to a point where their attainment \nimplies a revolution.\nIt is, of course, still possible to assert that outside leadership in some form\n89. Assembled just before the revolution, the cahiers were essentially lists of complaints and demands from \nevery department. As they were written by local elites, they were not quite mass opinion, though for that \nreason one might judge the cahiers to represent something closer to the eventual program of the bourgeois \nrevolution. In fact, virtually all of the cahiers focused on local grievances; the vast majority assumed the \ncontinuation of feudalism and demanded adjustments (for example, restrictions on lords' hunting rights, \nuniform weights and measures, rights to woodland, a limitation on curé salaries). No cahier outside Paris even \nhinted at popular sovereignty, and most argued their claims by reference to custom. As one historian \nconcludes, \"it follows that the revolutionary state of mind expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man \nand the decrees of 178991 was a product and not a cause of the crisis that began in 1787.\" George V.

I do not address this particular issue here except to note that, if this \nargument is admitted, it is largely a matter of taste as to whether one sees subordinate classes as helpless without a \nradical intelligentsia or the radical intelligentsia as helpless without an insurgent mass. What is definitely being asserted, \nhowever, is that neither \"revolutionary consciousness\" nor an elaborate ideology, as those terms are ordinarily \nunderstood, is necessary to create the revolutionary crisis of which such leaders might conceivably then take advantage.\nWho Shatters the Hegemony?\nTo sum up provisionally, spontaneous conceptions among pre-factory workers, factory workers, and modern \nrevolutionary peasants have been mainly backward-looking. They have been attempts to revive a social \ncontract that had been violated, most frequently they were efforts to remedy specific and concrete grievances \nin their particular occupation.92\nIs it possible to speak of a social contract that is being violated in Sedaka? I believe it is possible, providing the social \ncontract is understood as a set of practices and the norms associated with them, providing we recognize that the \ninterpretation of this contract varies markedly by class, and providing we realize that the poor have in large part created \nand recognized their version of the contract only in the context of its violation. This violation has been mediated almost \nexclusively by the larger farmers, seeking to improve their returns, although the opportunity to create new relations of \nproduction was provided by the state-built irrigation scheme. These budding capitalists have dismissed tenants, raised \nthe rent, switched to leasehold, and called in the machinery. It is they who have steadily abrogated the customs of zakat, \ncharity, loans, and large feasts. It is they who have thus all but eliminated the modest \"socialization\" of paddy profits, \nwhich once served their interest. It is they who have increasingly monopolized the supply of state subsidies and inputs \nas well as the political institutions of village life.\nThe rich of Sedaka thus find themselves in an anomalous, though powerful, position. The precondition of their new \nwealth has been the systematic dismantling of the practices that previously rationalized their wealth, status, and \nleadership. Their economic domination has come at the cost of their social standing and of their social control of their \npoorer neighborsthe cost implied by their having broken their own hegemony. The poor, by contrast, find themselves \nwith an ideologically serviceable past; they have a vital stake in defending both the norms and practices of the earlier \nagrarian order. It is useful, in this context, to distinguish two sorts of tradition: one that is taken for grantedwhat \nBourdieu\n92. Moore, Injustice, 476.\n  \n< previous page\npage_345\nnext page >\n",

It is not, of course, constructed out of whole cloth. If it were, it would have little ideological \nvalue. It is instead a recognizable but partisan facsimile of earlier values and practices drawn up to legitimize essential \nclass interests.\nIf the ideological situation in Sedaka is at all characteristic of early capitalism, as I believe it is, then the usual argument \nabout dominant ideologies will have to be fundamentally recast. Gramsci and many others assume that the key task for \nany subordinate class is to create a counterhegemony that will ultimately be capable of transforming the society.94 This \nposition may have some merit for mature capitalist societies, where an elaborated ideology may already be in place. But \nit ignores the central fact that it has been capitalism that has historically transformed societies and broken apart existing \nrelations of production. Even a casual glance at the record will show that capitalist development continually requires the \nviolation of the previous \"social contract\" which in most cases it had earlier helped to create and sustain. The \ndemystification of an existing hegemony is thus accomplished at least as much by the inevitable disregard for custom \ninherent in capitalism as by the \"penetration\" of subordinate classes themselves. The history of capitalism could, in fact, \nbe written along just such lines. The enclosures, the introduction of agricultural machinery, the invention of the factory \nsystem, the use of steam power, the development of the assembly line, and today the computer revolution and robots \nhave all had massive material and social consequences that undermined previous understandings about work, equity, \nsecurity, obligation, and rights.\nThe conflict in Sedaka can be grasped only against this background of the transforming power of capitalismits tendency \nto undermine radically the past and the present. Raymond Williams vividly captures the process:\nSince it has become dominant in one area after another, it has been uncontrollably disturbing and restless, \nreaching local stabilities only almost at once to move away from them, leaving every kind of social and \ntechnical debris, disrupting human continuities and settlements, moving on with brash confidence to its \nalways novel enterprises.95\nThis is also what Brecht must have had in mind when he claimed that it was not socialism, but capitalism, that was \nrevolutionary.\nThe backward-looking character of much subordinate class ideology and pro-\n93.

It is the revolutionary character of capitalism that casts them in a \ndefensive role. If they defend a version of the older hegemony, it is because those arrangements look good by \ncomparison with the current prospects and because it has a certain legitimacy rooted in earlier practice. The defense and \nelaboration of a social contract that has been abrogated by capitalist development is perhaps the most constant \nideological theme of the peasant and the early capitalist worker96from the Levellers and Diggers of the English \nRevolution to the craftsmen and weavers threatened with extinction to the \"Captain Swing\" rebels fighting the use of \nthreshing machines. The same defense of beleaguered traditional rights is found at the core of popular intellectual \nattacks on capitalism by figures as ideologically diverse as Cobbett, Paine, and Carlyle.97\nIn Sedaka, as in nineteenth-century England, the attack is directed less against capitalism per se than against capitalists. \nThe violation of hard-won earlier arrangements appears to its victims as a heartless and willful choice of concrete \nindividuals and not as the impersonal working out of some larger systematic logic. As in the case of Andalusian \nlaborers, described by Alier, the victims see malevolence when nothing more than economic rationality is involved:\nMy point is that there is and has been unemployment, and that labourers have attributed, and still do attribute \nunemployment to the unwillingness of landowners to give them work. As we have seen, there is some \nsubstance to this view, even though it is not as much a matter of bad will on the part of the landowners as of \ndecisions which are economically rational from the point of view of the individual enterprise.98\nAt another level, however, the personalization of the causes of distress is not a misperception at all. The choices made \nby the large farmers in Sedaka or Andalusiathough they may be constrained by economic logicare also, manifestly, the \nresult of conscious individual choice. In seeing that things might be otherwise, those who personalize the issue also \nperceive the larger fact that even capitalistic logic is a social creation and not a thing. What is certain, moreover, is that \nthe personalization evident in charges of stinginess, greed, and hardheartedness, whether in the novels of Dickens or in \nthe mouths of Sedaka's poor, are far more generative of anger and possible action than if the cause were seen as \nimpersonal and inevitable. If personalization is partly a myth, then it is a powerful, politically enabling myth.\nThe conquest of this sense of inevitability is essential to the development\n96. The creation of the modern state has many of the same rupturing effects on local arrangements and might \nbe examined in the same fashion.\n97.

For this to happen, people must perceive and define their situation as the \nconsequence of human injustice: a situation they need not, cannot, and ought not to endure. By itself of course \nsuch a perception . . . is no guarantee of political or social changes to come. But without some very \nconsiderable surge of moral anger such changes do not occur.99\nThe personalization I observed in Sedaka is to a large degree the natural consequence of the capitalist transformation \nexperienced there. For the victims as well as the beneficiaries of the large abstractions we choose to call capitalism, \nimperialism, or the green revolution, the experience itself arrives in quite personal, concrete, localized, mediated form.\nLet us suppose for a moment that poor peasants in Sedaka had instead chosen to emphasize the larger causes of their \ndifficulties. They are not, as we have seen, unaware of these larger issues. But what if they had, as an intellectual critic \n(or supporter) of Malaysian development might have, focused on such matters as the accumulation of wealth, the \ngrowth of capital-intensive agriculture, and the policies of the state, which favor the interests of rich farmers to ensure \nthe provision of cheap wage goods to the enclaves of urban industry? Can one imagine a rural protest movement with \nbanners proclaiming \"stop agrarian capitalism\" or \"down with the cash nexus\"? Of course not. Such undeniable facts are \nfar too abstract and remote; they fail completely to capture the texture of local experience. Were they in fact the center \nof attention, one imagines that the smallholders and landless laborers of the village might simply stand aside in \nrecognition of the apparently inextricable forces that will shape their future. To see the causes of distress instead as \npersonal, as evil, as a failure of identifiable people in their own community to behave in a seemly way may well be a \npartial view, but it is not a wrong view. And not incidentally, it is quite possibly the only view that could, and does, \nserve as the basis for day-to-day resistance.\nResistance in Sedaka begins as, I suspect, all historical resistance by subordinate classes begins: close to the ground, \nrooted firmly in the homely but meaningful realities of daily experience. The enemies are not impersonal historical \nforces but real people. That is, they are seen as actors responsible for their own actions and not as bearers of \nabstractions. The values resisters are defending are equally near at hand and familiar. Their point of departure is the \npractices and norms that have proven effective in the past and appear to offer some promise of reducing or reversing the \nlosses they suffer. The goals of resistance are as modest as its values. The poor strive to gain work, land, and income; \nthey are not aiming at large historical abstractions such as socialism, let alone Marxist-Leninism. The means typically \nemployed to achieve these endsbarring the rare crises that might precipitate larger dreamsare both prudent and realistic.\n99.

When outright confrontation with landlords or the state \nseems futile, it is avoided. In the enormous zone between these two polar strategies lie all the forms of daily resistance, \nboth symbolic and material, that we have examined.\nSuch resistance, conceived and conducted with no revolutionary end in mind, can, and occasionally does, contribute to \nrevolutionary outcomes. The end in such cases is ironically likely to appear to the peasantry or the working class not as \nan end at all, but rather as the necessary means to their modest goals. Even when such slogans as \"socialism\" take hold \namong subordinate classes, they are likely to mean something radically different to the rank and file than to the radical \nintelligentsia. What Orwell had to say about the English working class in the 1930s is almost surely true for lower \nclasses in general:\nThe first thing that must strike any outside observer is that socialism in its developed form is a theory \nconfined entirely to the middle class.\nFor it must be remembered that a working man . . . is seldom or never a socialist in the complete logically \nconsistent sense. . . . To the ordinary working man, the sort you would meet in any pub on Saturday night, \nsocialism does not mean much more than better wages and shorter hours and nobody bossing you about. To \nthe more revolutionary type who is a hunger-marcher and is blacklisted by employers, the word is a sort of \nrallying cry against the forces of oppression, a vague threat of future violence. . . . But I have yet to meet a \nworking miner, steelworker, cottonweaver, docker, navvy, or whatever who was \"ideologically\" sound.\nOne of the analogies between Communism and Roman Catholicism is that only the educated are completely \northodox.100\nThe observation is of course nothing more than the intellectual division of labor one might expect in any class-based \nmovement between workers or peasants whose struggle must grow directly from the realities of material life and an \nintelligentsia whose sights are set on a more distant horizon. The division of labor in this case, as in others, is not only a \ncomplimentarity but carries within it the possibility of conflict as well.\nIt is true, as Lukacs has argued, that the peasantry as a class is unlikely to envision a new plan for the total organization \nof society:\nThe outlook of other classes (petty bourgeois or peasants) is ambiguous or sterile because their existence is \nnot based exclusively on their role in the capitalist system of production but is indissolubly linked with the \nvestiges of feudal society. Their aim, therefore, is not to advance capitalism or to transcend it, but to reverse \nits action or at least to prevent it from devel-\n100.

Their class interest concentrates on symptoms of development and not on development itself.101\nWhat he might have added, however, is that the working class itself, for different reasons perhaps, is in the same boat. \nThat class too, if Moore, E. P. Thompson, Orwell, and Luxemburg are at all correct, deals with the \"symptoms\" of \ndevelopment as they are manifested in daily life. There is no point in aspiring in vain for a proletariat or peasantry that \nwill somehow detach itself from its insistence on the mundane objectives that will make for a tolerable material life and \na modicum of dignity. There is, on the contrary, every point in seeing precisely these ends and their dogged pursuit \nthrough thick and thin as the central hope for a more humane social orderas the core of the critique, in symbol and in \naction, of any and all social orders erected above peasants and workers by those who claim to serve their interests.\nThe reader will detect, correctly, a certain pessimism about the prospects for revolutionary change that will \nsystematically and reliably respect the insistence on small decencies that are at the core of peasant or working-class \nconsciousness. If the revolution cannot even deliver the petty amenities and minor humanities that animate the struggle \nof its subjects, then there is not much to be said for whatever else it may accomplish. This pessimism is, alas, not so \nmuch a prejudice as, I think, a realistic assessment of the fate of workers and peasants in most revolutionary statesa fate \nthat makes melancholy reading when set against the revolutionary promise.102 If revolution were a rare event before \nthe creation of such states, it now seems all but foreclosed.

Had the rate of household formation kept pace with natural increase, there would have been \nsomething on the order of eighty-three households by 1979, nearly twice the actual increase. This finding is neither new \nnor surprising.1 Population has been leaking away from the rice plain of Kedah for some time,2 owing both to the \nextended boom in the national and urban economy and to the fact that, even with double-cropping, the prospects for the \nchildren of tenants and smallholders are hardly encouraging. Their departure has slowed the process of involution in the \nlocal economy but has hardly reversed it.\nAside from the departure of young people, which simply reduces the size of an existing household, there were fourteen \nhouseholds present in 1967 that are absent today. Six families simply died out.3 Eight households left the village. Four \nof these bought paddy land elsewhere, renting or selling locally owned land in the process. All but one of these four \nfamilies purchased land in Seberang Perak, one of the last ''paddy frontier\" areas where suitable land can be bought at \nreasonable prices and cleared for cultivation. This form of mobility required capital; one such family owned 10 relong \nin Sedaka, another owned 6 relong, and still another had rented in at least 15 relong. Only one household, which owned \n2 relong, was anything less than a family of substance. The four remaining families had the good fortune to be accepted \nas settlers on government plantation schemes (ranchangan). Attracted by the assurance of high incomes, they left and in \nthree cases were able to arrange for one or more of their brothers to be taken in as well. Again, these families were not \nby any means poor in the village context. One owned a shop and small rice mill, two others owned nearly 5 relong \napiece, and the last owned only 1 relong but was said by villagers to have been fairly well-off. In fact, of the eleven \nindividuals who applied successfuly for\n1. This assumes, of course, that the average size of a household did not increase. Since all evidence indicates \nthat household size, even in rural areas, has been declining, this is a safe assumption.\n2. S. Jegatheesan, Land Tenure in the Muda Irrigation Scheme, MADA Monograph No. 29 (Alor Setar: MADA, \n1976), 26, notes that the rural population in Muda grew at an annual rate of only 1.54 percent from 1957 to 1970, \nwhile the national rate of population increase was 3.1 percent for the same period.\n3. In two of these cases the surviving widow or widower has moved to a nearby pondok in Yan. The pondok in this \nand many other cases is both a center for religious teaching and a kind of Islamic retirement home at which old \npeople prepare themselves spiritually for death.\n  \n< previous page\npage_351\nnext page >\n",

The reasons for this are not obscure. Incomes on the schemes are high enough to attract \nthe sons of even the wealthiest villagers. Application requires at least two trips, usually all the way to Pahang, and a \nnumber of documents that typically require bribes. The cost involved is substantial. Even when they make the effort, \nhowever, poor applicants have a lower success rate for at least two reasons.5 First, they are less likely to meet the \nliteracy standards required, as their parents are likely to have withdrawn them from primary school at an early age. \nSecond, they are less likely to have the political connections that can often mean the difference between success and \nfailure.\nBoth rich and poor quit the village, but their manner of leaving is decidedly different. The poor tend to leave as \nindividualsthe sons and, more rarely, daughters, of families whose local prospects are bleak. With the rare exception of \nthose with secondary education, they leave for such urban jobs as manual labor and construction work or, in the case of \nyoung women, domestic service or factory work. The well-to-do, when they leave at all, often go as families to land \nthey have bought or to a settlement scheme plot. In other words, the poor leave to join the ranks of the proletariat and \nthe rich leave as a propertied, if petite, bourgeoisie.\nIn the course of the past dozen years, a total of twenty-eight new families have established themselves in Sedaka. \nThirteen reflect the natural process of new family formation: six are the sons of villagers who have married and set up \nseparate households; seven are daughters of villagers whose husbands have moved in and established new households. \nAnother ten families moved in because the husband's or, more rarely, the wife's father owned land in the village (though \nhe did not reside there), which the couple could rent. Thus, in twenty-three cases, the combination of kinship and \navailable land (whether rented or inherited) explains the appearance of new households in Sedaka. The kinship tie, in \nthis context, is decisive only because it provides access to farming land. There are no hard-and-fast rules in Malay \nsociety governing whether a new family should live near the husband's or wife's parents, and it is a safe bet that in \nnearly all twenty-\n4. In cases where a son or co-resident younger brother in the same household was accepted to a ranchangan \nand left, the household remained in both the 1967 and 1979 censuses. For this reason, the number of \nindividuals going to ranchangan was greater than the number of families that dropped out of the 1979 census. \nIn two cases, also, individuals who were accepted chose not to take up the opportunity.\n5. Such is the attraction of the ranchangan that at least twelve villagers applied during my eighteen-month stay. \nHalf the applicants were from among the poorer families and had risked considerable capital (typically M$200) in \norder to apply.\n  \n< previous page\npage_352\nnext page >\n",

Of the remaining five \nfamilies, two are pure wage laborers with only a house lot in the village, and three are special cases.6\nThe economic status of these new households offers something of a window on the past decade. Despite the fact that \nnearly all established households in Sedaka because it was economically advantageous to do so, their incomes place a \nmajority of them among the poorest half of the village. Far more significant, however, is the average farm size among \nthis group.7 The land they now rent from their parents is likely, with a few notable exceptions, to represent the \nmaximum acreage they will eventually inherit; in many cases they will inherit less.8 Thus, the present size of farms for \nthis group of active rice growers is a fair indication of their future farm size as well. The average farm size for this \ngroup in 1979 was 3.5 relong, nearly 1 relong below the village average. If, however, we eliminate the five privileged \nfarmers among the twenty-eight who now farm more than 6 relong, the average farm size for the remaining twenty-three \nis a meager 2.6 relong, well below the minimum 4 relong required for a subsistence income.\nThe situation of these twenty-three families illustrates the long-term demographic dilemma of village agriculture. Put in \nmore anthropological terms, one writer has called this the problem of the \"establishment fund,\" which is the \"cost of \nsetting up a household with access to a means of living comparable to that of the previous generation.\"9 For an agrarian \nsociety, such access means above all access to land. Given the disappearance of the rice frontier and high\n6. Of the special cases, one is a pensioner from the national railways who was born in Sedaka and has chosen \nto retire there; another is a storekeeper who has set up shop next to the main road; and the third is a widow \nwho has moved from her old house to a smaller house where she lives with her niece, who is still schooling.\n7. Landownership for this group is significantly below the village average but that is to be expected, since few are \nof an age when they could expect to inherit land. The usual practice is that land is not actually transferred until the \nfather is deceased; when a farmer retires from active cultivation he is thus likely to rent land to his children.\n8. A farmer with a good deal of land may occasionally rent more land to a son than that son will inherit. This is \nlikely to happen when other sons are not yet of farming age or have taken work that does not permit them to \ncultivate. When the land is eventually inherited, these underage and noncultivating sons will typically receive a \nfull share of property. Of the new households, there were only four farmers who could expect to inherit more land \nthan they were now farming, and the amount of additional land involved was less than 6 relong.\n9.

To be sure, double-\ncropping and a buoyant urban economy provide a welcome breathing space. What space they provide, however, is \nlargely undercut by the fact that well over half the population now farms plots that are already less than adequate as well \nas by the impact of structural changes that have reduced both wage work and the land available for rental.

Though not strictly a production cost, the Islamic zakat tax is included here, but the percentage of gross \nyield paid is reduced from figures typically used in line with recent field research findings. For tenants, rent is calculated as part of production costs.\neThere is good reason to believe that this figure is overstated. Yields are based on crop-cutting surveys that systematically overstate yields by about 10 percent. Furthermore, paddy \nsales receipts do not adjust for the reduction that is made for moisture content, etc., and that averaged 14.5 percent for both seasons of 1977 and 17.5 percent for 1979.

Its form is similar to other such \nletters. They are distributed in the same way as chain letters in the West.\nIn the name of Allah, most gracious and merciful.\n{This letter has been copied sentence for sentence from a letter coming anonymously without changing its \ncontents}.\nThis letter, in the form of a will, from the holy land of Mecca is sent to all Muslims by Syed Ahmad. It was brought to \nIndonesia by Haji Malek, a member of {sect} Hara Baham Balanganum. Syed Ahmad, having fallen asleep at the grave \nof the Prophet Muhamad {blessings from Allah and peace be upon him}, was spoken to by the Prophet in his sleep.\n\"I will no longer bestow blessings upon Muslims nor protect them from God's punishment because many of them have \ncommitted grave sins such as adultery, drinking; who do not bother to pay the zakat; who always make their own selfish \ninterest the object of worship; who are conceited. Syed Ahmad, I command you to remind all those who call themselves \nMuslims. Have undivided faith in Allah, the all pure, and be patient in confronting difficulties, and do not let the faithful \nbetray Allah.\"\nSigns of the Day of Judgement (kiamat)\n1. In 1971, there were many cases of housewives leaving their houses without telling their husbands.\n2. In 1972, two stars were seen as big as hens.\n3. In 1980, the earth will be in darkness for three days and three nights; the sun will rise in the west and set in the north, \nand from that moment Allah will no longer accept repentance.\nOath of Syed ahmad\nI swear to Allah if I have lied about my dream, I will be cast out of the Muslim faith, and whoever does not believe in \nmy dream will become an unbeliever and, when the day of judgement comes soon, will be put in hell.\nAttention 1. To whoever calls himself a Muslim; this letter should be sent to Muslims in other areas. Read it carefully \nbecause this letter is a will and oath in the name of Allah from Syed Ahmad to all those of the Muslim faith. Saudi \nArabia\n2. While reading the Koran at the grave of the Prophet Muhamad, Syed Ahmad fell asleep and had this dream. 80,000 \nMuslims have passed away but, of that total,\n  \n< previous page\npage_362\nnext page >\n",

Rich men do not have \nsympathy for the poor. Many do not pay the zakat, do not wish to do good works. This is why Syed Ahmad is sending \nout this testament to the faithful in order that they follow the right path because the Day of Judgment is coming \nsuddenly. A star will rise in the sky and the door of repentence will be closed. All writings will decline and the sun will \nmove closer {to the earth}.\nOn reading a letter such as this whoever is poor will become rich. All wishes will be answered if thirty copies of this are \nprinted and circulated. In two weeks, whoever has followed these instructions will be rewarded with good life. In \nBombay there was a man who copied this will and made a profit in his business. On the other hand, whoever says this \ntestament is false, his male son will die. Whoever, having read this will and having understood it, and who does not tell \nother people, will confront all sorts of difficulties in life. But whoever copies and circulates this letter will receive great \nprofit.\nIt is only Allah who knows all \nIt is only Allah whom we can worship \nIt is only Allah who can protect and guide us.\n  \n< previous page\npage_363\nnext page >\n",

Scott and available from Yale University Press\nSEEING LIKE A STATE\nHow Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed\n\"One of the most profound and illuminating studies of this century to have been published in recent decades. . . . A \nfascinating interpretation of the growth of the modern state. . . . Scott presents a formidable argument against using the \npower of the state in an attempt to reshape the whole of society.\" \nJohn Gray, New York Times Book Review\nDOMINATION AND THE ARTS OF RESISTANCE\nHidden Transcripts\n\"Scott's argument is all the more persuasive for the wealth of cases he brings under his magnifying glass and for the \nvibrancy and liveliness of his style. . . . [A] remarkable mind-opening book.\" \nZygmunt Bauman, Times Literary Supplement\nTHE MORAL ECONOMY OF THE PEASANT\nRebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia\n\"This book will last. No one interested in peasant societies in Southeast Asia, or for that matter elsewhere, can afford to \nignore it. . . . It is as well written as it is sophisticated and enlightening. It should be assigned . . . to undergraduates . . . , \nrecommended as a matter of course to graduate students working on social change, and mentioned always to anyone \npuzzled by the intricacies of economic, social, and political structure in countries with large peasant populations.\" \nDaniel S.
