If you owe\nthe bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.\n\n—American Proverb\n\nTWO YEARS AGO, by a series of strange coincidences, I found myself attending a\ngarden party at Westminster Abbey. I was a bit uncomfortable. It’s not that\nother guests weren’t pleasant and amicable, and Father Graeme, who had\norganized the party, was nothing if not a gracious and charming host. But I\nfelt more than a little out of place. At one point, Father Graeme intervened,\nsaying that there was someone by a nearby fountain whom I would certainly want\nto meet. She turned out to be a trim, well-appointed young woman who, he\nexplained, was an attorney—“but more of the activist kind. She works for a\nfoundation that provides legal support for anti-poverty groups in London.\nYou’ll probably have a lot to talk about.”\n\nWe chatted. She told me about her job. I told her I had been involved for many\nyears with the global justice movement—“anti-globalization movement,” as it\nwas usually called in the media. She was curious: she’d of course read a lot\nabout Seattle, Genoa, the tear gas and street battles, but … well, had we\nreally accomplished anything by all of that?\n\n“Actually,” I said, “I think it’s kind of amazing how much we did manage to\naccomplish in those first couple of years.”\n\n“For example?”\n\n“Well, for example, we managed to almost completely destroy the IMF.”\n\nAs it happened, she didn’t actually know what the IMF was, so I offered that\nthe International Monetary Fund basically acted as the world’s debt\nenforcers—“You might say, the high-finance equivalent of the guys who come to\nbreak your legs.” I launched into historical background, explaining how,\nduring the ’70s oil crisis, OPEC countries ended up pouring so much of their\nnewfound riches into Western banks that the banks couldn’t figure out where to\ninvest the money; how Citibank and Chase therefore began sending agents around\nthe world trying to convince Third World dictators and politicians to take out\nloans (at the time, this was called “go-go banking”); how they started out at\nextremely low rates of interest that almost immediately skyrocketed to 20\npercent or so due to tight U.S. money policies in the early ‘80s; how, during\nthe ’80s and ’90s, this led to the Third World debt crisis; how the IMF then\nstepped in to insist that, in order to obtain refinancing, poor countries\nwould be obliged to abandon price supports on basic foodstuffs, or even\npolicies of keeping strategic food reserves, and abandon free health care and\nfree education; how all of this had led to the collapse of all the most basic\nsupports for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on earth. I spoke\nof poverty, of the looting of public resources, the collapse of societies,\nendemic violence, malnutrition, hopelessness, and broken lives.\n\n“But what was _your_ position?” the lawyer asked.\n\n“About the IMF? We wanted to abolish it.”\n\n“No, I mean, about the Third World debt.”\n\n“Oh, we wanted to abolish that too. The immediate demand was to stop the IMF\nfrom imposing structural adjustment policies, which were doing all the direct\ndamage, but we managed to accomplish that surprisingly quickly. The more long-\nterm aim was debt amnesty. Something along the lines of the biblical Jubilee.\nAs far as we were concerned,” I told her, “thirty years of money flowing from\nthe poorest countries to the richest was quite enough.”\n\n“But,” she objected, as if this were self-evident, “they’d borrowed the money!\nSurely one has to pay one’s debts.”\n\nIt was at this point that I realized this was going to be a very different\nsort of conversation than I had originally anticipated.\n\nWhere to start? I could have begun by explaining how these loans had\noriginally been taken out by unelected dictators who placed most of it\ndirectly in their Swiss bank accounts, and ask her to contemplate the justice\nof insisting that the lenders be repaid, not by the dictator, or even by his\ncronies, but by literally taking food from the mouths of hungry children. Or\nto think about how many of these poor countries had actually already paid back\nwhat they’d borrowed three or four times now, but that through the miracle of\ncompound interest, it still hadn’t made a significant dent in the principal. I\ncould also observe that there was a difference between refinancing loans, and\ndemanding that in order to obtain refinancing, countries have to follow some\northodox free-market economic policy designed in Washington or Zurich that\ntheir citizens had never agreed to and never would, and that it was a bit\ndishonest to insist that countries adopt democratic constitutions and then\nalso insist that, whoever gets elected, they have no control over their\ncountry’s policies anyway. Or that the economic policies imposed by the IMF\ndidn’t even work. But there was a more basic problem: the very assumption that\ndebts _have_ to be repaid.\n\nActually, the remarkable thing about the statement “one has to pay one’s\ndebts” is that even according to standard economic theory, it isn’t true. A\nlender is supposed to accept a certain degree of risk. If all loans, no matter\nhow idiotic, were still retrievable—if there were no bankruptcy laws, for\ninstance—the results would be disastrous. What reason would lenders have not\nto make a stupid loan?\n\n“Well, I know that sounds like common sense,” I said, “but the funny thing is,\neconomically, that’s not how loans are actually supposed to work. Financial\ninstitutions are supposed to be ways of directing resources toward profitable\ninvestments. If a bank were guaranteed to get its money back, plus interest,\nno matter what it did, the whole system wouldn’t work. Say I were to walk into\nthe nearest branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland and say ‘You know, I just got\na really great tip on the horses. Think you could lend me a couple million\nquid?’ Obviously they’d just laugh at me. But that’s just because they know if\nmy horse didn’t come in, there’d be no way for them to get the money back.\nBut, imagine there was some law that said they were guaranteed to get their\nmoney back no matter what happens, even if that meant, I don’t know, selling\nmy daughter into slavery or harvesting my organs or something. Well, in that\ncase, why not? Why bother waiting for someone to walk in who has a viable plan\nto set up a laundromat or some such? Basically, that’s the situation the IMF\ncreated on a global level—which is how you could have all those banks willing\nto fork over billions of dollars to a bunch of obvious crooks in the first\nplace.”\n\nI didn’t get quite that far, because at about that point a drunken financier\nappeared, having noticed that we were talking about money, and began telling\nfunny stories about moral hazard—which somehow, before too long, had morphed\ninto a long and not particularly engrossing account of one of his sexual\nconquests. I drifted off.\n\nStill, for several days afterward, that phrase kept resonating in my head.\n\n“Surely one has to pay one’s debts.”\n\nThe reason it’s so powerful is that it’s not actually an economic statement:\nit’s a moral statement. After all, isn’t paying one’s debts what morality is\nsupposed to be all about? Giving people what is due them. Accepting one’s\nresponsibilities. Fulfilling one’s obligations to others, just as one would\nexpect them to fulfill their obligations to you. What could be a more obvious\nexample of shirking one’s responsibilities than reneging on a promise, or\nrefusing to pay a debt?\n\nIt was that very apparent self-evidence, I realized, that made the statement\nso insidious. This was the kind of line that could make terrible things appear\nutterly bland and unremarkable. This may sound strong, but it’s hard not to\nfeel strongly about such matters once you’ve witnessed the effects. I had. For\nalmost two years, I had lived in the highlands of Madagascar. Shortly before I\narrived, there had been an outbreak of malaria. It was a particularly virulent\noutbreak because malaria had been wiped out in highland Madagascar many years\nbefore, so that, after a couple of generations, most people had lost their\nimmunity. The problem was, it took money to maintain the mosquito eradication\nprogram, since there had to be periodic tests to make sure mosquitoes weren’t\nstarting to breed again and spraying campaigns if it was discovered that they\nwere. Not a lot of money. But owing to IMF-imposed austerity programs, the\ngovernment had to cut the monitoring program. Ten thousand people died. I met\nyoung mothers grieving for lost children. One might think it would be hard to\nmake a case that the loss of ten thousand human lives is really justified in\norder to ensure that Citibank wouldn’t have to cut its losses on one\nirresponsible loan that wasn’t particularly important to its balance sheet\nanyway. But here was a perfectly decent woman—one who worked for a charitable\norganization, no less—who took it as self-evident that it was. After all, they\nowed the money, and surely one has to pay one’s debts.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nFor the next few weeks, that phrase kept coming back at me. Why debt? What\nmakes the concept so strangely powerful? Consumer debt is the lifeblood of our\neconomy. All modern nation-states are built on deficit spending. Debt has come\nto be the central issue of international politics. But nobody seems to know\nexactly what it is, or how to think about it.\n\nThe very fact that we don’t know what debt is, the very flexibility of the\nconcept, is the basis of its power. If history shows anything, it is that\nthere’s no better way to justify relations founded on violence, to make such\nrelations seem moral, than by reframing them in the language of debt—above\nall, because it immediately makes it seem that it’s the victim who’s doing\nsomething wrong. Mafiosi understand this. So do the commanders of conquering\narmies. For thousands of years, violent men have been able to tell their\nvictims that those victims owe them something. If nothing else, they “owe them\ntheir lives” (a telling phrase) because they haven’t been killed.\n\nNowadays, for example, military aggression is defined as a crime against\nhumanity, and international courts, when they are brought to bear, usually\ndemand that aggressors pay compensation. Germany had to pay massive\nreparations after World War I, and Iraq is still paying Kuwait for Saddam\nHussein’s invasion in 1990. Yet the Third World debt, the debt of countries\nlike Madagascar, Bolivia, and the Philippines, seems to work precisely the\nother way around. Third World debtor nations are almost exclusively countries\nthat have at one time been attacked and conquered by European countries—often,\nthe very countries to whom they now owe money. In 1895, for example, France\ninvaded Madagascar, disbanded the government of then–Queen Ranavalona III, and\ndeclared the country a French colony. One of the first things General Gallieni\ndid after “pacification,” as they liked to call it then, was to impose heavy\ntaxes on the Malagasy population, in part so they could reimburse the costs of\nhaving been invaded, but also, since French colonies were supposed to be\nfiscally self-supporting, to defray the costs of building the railroads,\nhighways, bridges, plantations, and so forth that the French regime wished to\nbuild. Malagasy taxpayers were never asked whether they wanted these\nrailroads, highways, bridges, and plantations, or allowed much input into\nwhere and how they were\nbuilt.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts001) To the contrary: over\nthe next half century, the French army and police slaughtered quite a number\nof Malagasy who objected too strongly to the arrangement (upwards of half a\nmillion, by some reports, during one revolt in 1947). It’s not as if\nMadagascar has ever done any comparable damage to France. Despite this, from\nthe beginning, the Malagasy people were told they owed France money, and to\nthis day, the Malagasy people are still held to owe France money, and the rest\nof the world accepts the justice of this arrangement. When the “international\ncommunity” does perceive a moral issue, it’s usually when they feel the\nMalagasy government is being slow to pay their debts.\n\nBut debt is not just victor’s justice; it can also be a way of punishing\nwinners who weren’t supposed to win. The most spectacular example of this is\nthe history of the Republic of Haiti—the first poor country to be placed in\npermanent debt peonage. Haiti was a nation founded by former plantation slaves\nwho had the temerity not only to rise up in rebellion, amidst grand\ndeclarations of universal rights and freedoms, but to defeat Napoleon’s armies\nsent to return them to bondage. France immediately insisted that the new\nrepublic owed it 150 million francs in damages for the expropriated\nplantations, as well as the expenses of outfitting the failed military\nexpeditions, and all other nations, including the United States, agreed to\nimpose an embargo on the country until it was paid. The sum was intentionally\nimpossible (equivalent to about 18 billion dollars), and the resultant embargo\nensured that the name “Haiti” has been a synonym for debt, poverty, and human\nmisery ever since.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts002)\n\nSometimes, though, debt seems to mean the very opposite. Starting in the\n1980s, the United States, which insisted on strict terms for the repayment of\nThird World debt, itself accrued debts that easily dwarfed those of the entire\nThird World combined—mainly fueled by military spending. The U.S. foreign\ndebt, though, takes the form of treasury bonds held by institutional investors\nin countries (Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the Gulf States)\nthat are in most cases, effectively, U.S. military protectorates, most covered\nin U.S. bases full of arms and equipment paid for with that very deficit\nspending. This has changed a little now that China has gotten in on the game\n(China is a special case, for reasons that will be explained later), but not\nvery much—even China finds that the fact it holds so many U.S. treasury bonds\nmakes it to some degree beholden to U.S. interests, rather than the other way\naround.\n\nSo what is the status of all this money continually being funneled into the\nU.S. treasury? Are these loans? Or is it tribute? In the past, military powers\nthat maintained hundreds of military bases outside their own home territory\nwere ordinarily referred to as “empires,” and empires regularly demanded\ntribute from subject peoples. The U.S. government, of course, insists that it\nis not an empire—but one could easily make a case that the only reason it\ninsists on treating these payments as “loans” and not as “tribute” is\nprecisely to deny the reality of what’s going on.\n\nNow, it’s true that, throughout history, certain sorts of debt, and certain\nsorts of debtor, have always been treated differently than others. In the\n1720s, one of the things that most scandalized the British public when\nconditions at debtors’ prisons were exposed in the popular press was the fact\nthat these prisons were regularly divided into two sections. Aristocratic\ninmates, who often thought of a brief stay in Fleet or Marshalsea as something\nof a fashion statement, were wined and dined by liveried servants and allowed\nto receive regular visits from prostitutes. On the “common side,” impoverished\ndebtors were shackled together in tiny cells, “covered with filth and vermin,”\nas one report put it, “and suffered to die, without pity, of hunger and jail\nfever.”[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts003)\n\nIn a way you can see current world economic arrangements as a much larger\nversion of the same thing: the U.S. in this case being the Cadillac debtor,\nMadagascar the pauper starving in the next cell—while the Cadillac debtors’\nservants lecture him on how his problems are due to his own irresponsibility.\n\nAnd there’s something more fundamental going on here, a philosophical\nquestion, even, that we might do well to contemplate. What is the difference\nbetween a gangster pulling out a gun and demanding you give him a thousand\ndollars of “protection money,” and that same gangster pulling out a gun and\ndemanding you provide him with a thousand-dollar “loan”? In most ways,\nobviously, nothing. But in certain ways there _is_ a difference. As in the\ncase of the U.S. debt to Korea or Japan, were the balance of power at any\npoint to shift, were America to lose its military supremacy, were the gangster\nto lose his henchmen, that “loan” might start being treated very differently.\nIt might become a genuine liability. But the crucial element would still seem\nto be the gun.\n\nThere’s an old vaudeville gag that makes the same point even more\nelegantly—here, as improved on by Steve Wright:\n\nI was walking down the street with a friend the other day and a guy with a gun\njumps out of an alley and says “stick ’em up.”\n\nAs I pull out my wallet, I figure, “shouldn’t be a total loss.” So I pull out\nsome money, turn to my friend and say, “Hey, Fred, here’s that fifty bucks I\nowe you.”\n\nThe robber was so offended he took out a thousand dollars of his own money,\nforced Fred to lend it to me at gunpoint, and then took it back again.\n\nIn the final analysis, the man with the gun doesn’t have to do anything he\ndoesn’t want to do. But in order to be able to run even a regime based on\nviolence effectively, one needs to establish some kind of set of rules. The\nrules can be completely arbitrary. In a way it doesn’t even matter what they\nare. Or, at least, it doesn’t matter at first. The problem is, the moment one\nstarts framing things in terms of debt, people will inevitably start asking\nwho really owes what to whom.\n\nArguments about debt have been going on for at least five thousand years. For\nmost of human history—at least, the history of states and empires—most human\nbeings have been told that they are\ndebtors.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts004) Historians, and\nparticularly historians of ideas, have been oddly reluctant to consider the\nhuman consequences; especially since this situation—more than any other—has\ncaused continual outrage and resentment. Tell people they are inferior, they\nare unlikely to be pleased, but this surprisingly rarely leads to armed\nrevolt. Tell people that they are potential equals who have failed, and that\ntherefore, even what they do have they do not deserve, that it isn’t rightly\ntheirs, and you are much more likely to inspire rage. Certainly this is what\nhistory would seem to teach us. For thousands of years, the struggle between\nrich and poor has largely taken the form of conflicts between creditors and\ndebtors—of arguments about the rights and wrongs of interest payments, debt\npeonage, amnesty, repossession, restitution, the sequestering of sheep, the\nseizing of vineyards, and the selling of debtors’ children into slavery. By\nthe same token, for the last five thousand years, with remarkable regularity,\npopular insurrections have begun the same way: with the ritual destruction of\nthe debt records—tablets, papyri, ledgers, whatever form they might have taken\nin any particular time and place. (After that, rebels usually go after the\nrecords of landholding and tax assessments.) As the great classicist Moses\nFinley often liked to say, in the ancient world, all revolutionary movements\nhad a single program: “Cancel the debts and redistribute the\nland.”[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts005)\n\nOur tendency to overlook this is all the more peculiar when you consider how\nmuch of our contemporary moral and religious language originally emerged\ndirectly from these very conflicts. Terms like “reckoning” or “redemption” are\nonly the most obvious, since they’re taken directly from the language of\nancient finance. In a larger sense, the same can be said of “guilt,”\n“freedom,” “forgiveness,” and even “sin.” Arguments about who really owes what\nto whom have played a central role in shaping our basic vocabulary of right\nand wrong.\n\nThe fact that so much of this language did take shape in arguments about debt\nhas left the concept strangely incoherent. After all, to argue with the king,\none has to use the king’s language, whether or not the initial premises make\nsense.\n\nIf one looks at the history of debt, then, what one discovers first of all is\nprofound moral confusion. Its most obvious manifestation is that most\neverywhere, one finds that the majority of human beings hold simultaneously\nthat (1) paying back money one has borrowed is a simple matter of morality,\nand (2) anyone in the habit of lending money is evil.\n\nIt’s true that opinions on this latter point do shift back and forth. One\nextreme possibility might be the situation the French anthropologist Jean-\nClaude Galey encountered in a region of the eastern Himalayas, where as\nrecently as the 1970s, the low-ranking castes—they were referred to as “the\nvanquished ones,” since they were thought to be descended from a population\nonce conquered by the current landlord caste, many centuries before—lived in a\nsituation of permanent debt dependency. Landless and penniless, they were\nobliged to solicit loans from the landlords simply to find a way to eat—not\nfor the money, since the sums were paltry, but because poor debtors were\nexpected to pay back the interest in the form of work, which meant they were\nat least provided with food and shelter while they cleaned out their\ncreditors’ outhouses and reroofed their sheds. For the “vanquished”—as for\nmost people in the world, actually—the most significant life expenses were\nweddings and funerals. These required a good deal of money, which always had\nto be borrowed. In such cases it was common practice, Galey explains, for\nhigh-caste moneylenders to demand one of the borrower’s daughters as security.\nOften, when a poor man had to borrow money for his daughter’s marriage, the\nsecurity would be the bride herself. She would be expected to report to the\nlender’s household after her wedding night, spend a few months there as his\nconcubine, and then, once he grew bored, be sent off to some nearby timber\ncamp, where she would have to spend the next year or two as a prostitute\nworking off her father’s debt. Once it was paid off, she’d return to her\nhusband and begin her married\nlife.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts006)\n\nThis seems shocking, outrageous even, but Galey does not report any widespread\nfeeling of injustice. Everyone seemed to feel that this was just the way\nthings worked. Neither was there much concern voiced among the local Brahmins,\nwho were the ultimate arbiters in matters of morality—though this is hardly\nsurprising, since the most prominent moneylenders were often Brahmins\nthemselves.\n\nEven here, of course, it’s hard to know what people were saying behind closed\ndoors. If a group of Maoist rebels were to suddenly seize control of the area\n(some do operate in this part of rural India) and round up the local usurers\nfor trial, we might hear all sorts of views expressed.\n\nStill, what Galey describes represents, as I say, one extreme of possibility:\none in which the usurers themselves are the ultimate moral authorities.\nCompare this with, say, medieval France, where the moral status of\nmoneylenders was seriously in question. The Catholic Church had always\nforbidden the practice of lending money at interest, but the rules often fell\ninto desuetude, causing the Church hierarchy to authorize preaching campaigns,\nsending mendicant friars to travel from town to town warning usurers that\nunless they repented and made full restitution of all interest extracted from\ntheir victims, they would surely go to Hell.\n\nThese sermons, many of which have survived, are full of horror stories of\nGod’s judgment on unrepentant lenders: stories of rich men struck down by\nmadness or terrible diseases, haunted by deathbed nightmares of the snakes or\ndemons who would soon rend or eat their flesh. In the twelfth century, when\nsuch campaigns reached their heights, more direct sanctions began to be\nemployed. The papacy issued instructions to local parishes that all known\nusurers were to be excommunicated; they were not to be allowed to receive the\nsacraments, and under no conditions could their bodies be buried on hallowed\nground. One French cardinal, Jacques de Vitry, writing around 1210, recorded\nthe story of a particularly influential moneylender whose friends tried to\npressure their parish priest to overlook the rules and allow him to be buried\nin the local churchyard:\n\nSince the dead usurer’s friends were very insistent, the priest yielded to\ntheir pressure and said, “Let us put his body on a donkey and see God’s will,\nand what He will do with the body. Wherever the donkey takes it, be it a\nchurch, a cemetery, or elsewhere, there will I bury it.” The body was placed\nupon the donkey which without deviating either to right or left, took it\nstraight out of town to the place where thieves are hanged from the gibbet,\nand with a hearty buck, sent the cadaver flying into the dung beneath the\ngallows.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts007)\n\nLooking over world literature, it is almost impossible to find a single\nsympathetic representation of a moneylender—or anyway, a professional\nmoneylender, which means by definition one who charges interest. I’m not sure\nthere is another profession (executioners?) with such a consistently bad\nimage. It’s especially remarkable when one considers that unlike executioners,\nusurers often rank among the richest and most powerful people in their\ncommunities. Yet the very name, “usurer,” evokes images of loan sharks, blood\nmoney, pounds of flesh, the selling of souls, and behind them all, the Devil,\noften represented as himself a kind of usurer, an evil accountant with his\nbooks and ledgers, or alternately, as the figure looming just behind the\nusurer, biding his time until he can repossess the soul of a villain who, by\nhis very occupation, has clearly made a compact with Hell.\n\nHistorically, there have been only two effective ways for a lender to try to\nwriggle out of the opprobrium: either shunt off responsibility onto some third\nparty, or insist that the borrower is even worse. In medieval Europe, for\ninstance, lords often took the first approach, employing Jews as surrogates.\nMany would even speak of “our” Jews—that is, Jews under their personal\nprotection—though in practice this usually meant that they would first deny\nJews in their territories any means of making a living except by usury\n(guaranteeing that they would be widely detested), then periodically turn on\nthem, claiming they were detestable creatures, and take the money for\nthemselves. The second approach is of course more common. But it usually leads\nto the conclusion that both parties to a loan are equally guilty; the whole\naffair is a shabby business; and most likely, both are damned.\n\nOther religious traditions have different perspectives. In medieval Hindu law\ncodes, not only were interest-bearing loans permissible (the main stipulation\nwas that interest should never exceed principal), but it was often emphasized\nthat a debtor who did not pay would be reborn as a slave in the household of\nhis creditor—or in later codes, reborn as his horse or ox. The same tolerant\nattitude toward lenders, and warnings of karmic revenge against borrowers,\nreappear in many strands of Buddhism. Even so, the moment that usurers were\nthought to go too far, exactly the same sort of stories as found in Europe\nwould start appearing. A Medieval Japanese author recounts one—he insists it’s\na true story—about the terrifying fate of Hiromushime, the wife of a wealthy\ndistrict governor around 776 ad. An exceptionally greedy woman,\n\nshe would add water to the rice wine she sold and make a huge profit on such\ndiluted saké. On the day she loaned something to someone she would use a small\nmeasuring cup, but on the day of collection she used a large one. When lending\nrice her scale registered small portions, but when she received payment it was\nin large amounts. The interest that she forcibly collected was\ntremendous—often as much as ten or even one hundred times the amount of the\noriginal loan. She was rigid about collecting debts, showing no mercy\nwhatsoever. Because of this, many people were thrown into a state of anxiety;\nthey abandoned their households to get away from her and took to wandering in\nother provinces.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts008)\n\nAfter she died, for seven days, monks prayed over her sealed coffin. On the\nseventh, her body mysteriously sprang to life:\n\nThose who came to look at her encountered an indescribable stench. From the\nwaist up she had already become an ox with four-inch horns protruding from her\nforehead. Her two hands had become the hooves of an ox, her nails were now\ncracked so that they resembled an ox hoof’s instep. From the waist down,\nhowever, her body was that of a human. She disliked rice and preferred to eat\ngrass. Her manner of eating was rumination. Naked, she would lie in her own\nexcrement.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts009)\n\nGawkers descended. Guilty and ashamed, the family made desperate attempts to\nbuy forgiveness, canceling all debts owed to them by anybody, donating much of\ntheir wealth to religious establishments. Finally, mercifully, the monster\ndied.\n\nThe author, himself a monk, felt that the story represented a clear case of\npremature reincarnation—the woman was being punished by the law of karma for\nher violations of “what is both reasonable and right.” His problem was that\nBuddhist scriptures, insofar as they explicitly weighed in on the matter,\ndidn’t provide a precedent. Normally, it was debtors who were supposed to be\nreborn as oxen, not creditors. As a result, when it came time to explain the\nmoral of the story, his exposition grew decidedly confusing:\n\nIt is as one sutra says: “When we do not repay the things that we have\nborrowed, our payment becomes that of being reborn as a horse or ox.” “The\ndebtor is like a slave, the creditor is like a master.” Or again: “a debtor is\na pheasant and his creditor a hawk.” If you are in a situation of having\ngranted a loan, do not put unreasonable pressure on your debtor for repayment.\nIf you do, you will be reborn as a horse or an ox and be put to work for him\nwho was in debt to you, and then you will repay many times\nover.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts010)\n\nSo which will it be? They can’t both end up as animals in each other’s barns.\n\nAll the great religious traditions seem to bang up against this quandary in\none form or another. On the one hand, insofar as all human relations involve\ndebt, they are all morally compromised. Both parties are probably already\nguilty of something just by entering into the relationship; at the very least\nthey run a significant danger of becoming guilty if repayment is delayed. On\nthe other hand, when we say someone acts like they “don’t owe anything to\nanybody,” we’re hardly describing the person as a paragon of virtue. In the\nsecular world, morality consists largely of fulfilling our obligations to\nothers, and we have a stubborn tendency to imagine those obligations as debts.\nMonks, perhaps, can avoid the dilemma by detaching themselves from the secular\nworld entirely, but the rest of us appear condemned to live in a universe that\ndoesn’t make a lot of sense.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe story of Hiromushime is a perfect illustration of the impulse to throw the\naccusation back at the accuser—just as in the story about the dead usurer and\nthe donkey, the emphasis on excrement, animals, and humiliation is clearly\nmeant as poetic justice, the creditor forced to experience the same feelings\nof disgrace and degradation that debtors are always made to feel. It’s all a\nmore vivid, more visceral way of asking that same question: “Who really owes\nwhat to whom?”\n\nIt’s also a perfect illustration of how the moment one asks the question “Who\nreally owes what to whom?,” one has begun to adopt the creditor’s language.\nJust as if we don’t pay our debts, “our payment becomes that of being reborn\nas a horse or an ox”; so if you are an unreasonable creditor, you too will\n“repay.” Even karmic justice can thus be reduced to the language of a business\ndeal.\n\nHere we come to the central question of this book: What, precisely, does it\nmean to say that our sense of morality and justice is reduced to the language\nof a business deal? What does it mean when we reduce moral obligations to\ndebts? What changes when the one turns into the other? And how do we speak\nabout them when our language has been so shaped by the market? On one level\nthe difference between an obligation and a debt is simple and obvious. A debt\nis the obligation to pay a certain sum of money. As a result, a debt, unlike\nany other form of obligation, can be precisely quantified. This allows debts\nto become simple, cold, and impersonal—which, in turn, allows them to be\ntransferable. If one owes a favor, or one’s life, to another human being—it is\nowed to that person specifically. But if one owes forty thousand dollars at\n12-percent interest, it doesn’t really matter who the creditor is; neither\ndoes either of the two parties have to think much about what the other party\nneeds, wants, is capable of doing—as they certainly would if what was owed was\na favor, or respect, or gratitude. One does not need to calculate the human\neffects; one need only calculate principal, balances, penalties, and rates of\ninterest. If you end up having to abandon your home and wander in other\nprovinces, if your daughter ends up in a mining camp working as a prostitute,\nwell, that’s unfortunate, but incidental to the creditor. Money is money, and\na deal’s a deal.\n\nFrom this perspective, the crucial factor, and a topic that will be explored\nat length in these pages, is money’s capacity to turn morality into a matter\nof impersonal arithmetic—and by doing so, to justify things that would\notherwise seem outrageous or obscene. The factor of violence, which I have\nbeen emphasizing up until now, may appear secondary. The difference between a\n“debt” and a mere moral obligation is not the presence or absence of men with\nweapons who can enforce that obligation by seizing the debtor’s possessions or\nthreatening to break his legs. It is simply that a creditor has the means to\nspecify, numerically, exactly how much the debtor owes.\n\nHowever, when one looks a little closer, one discovers that these two\nelements—the violence and the quantification—are intimately linked. In fact\nit’s almost impossible to find one without the other. French usurers had\npowerful friends and enforcers, capable of bullying even Church authorities.\nHow else would they have collected debts that were technically illegal?\nHiromushime was utterly uncompromising with her debtors—“showing no mercy\nwhatsoever”—but then, her husband was the governor. She didn’t have to show\nmercy. Those of us who do not have armed men behind us cannot afford to be so\nexacting.\n\nThe way violence, or the threat of violence, turns human relations into\nmathematics will crop up again and again over the course of this book. It is\nthe ultimate source of the moral confusion that seems to float around\neverything surrounding the topic of debt. The resulting dilemmas appear to be\nas old as civilization itself. We can observe the process in the very earliest\nrecords from ancient Mesopotamia; it finds its first philosophical expression\nin the Vedas, reappears in endless forms throughout recorded history, and\nstill lies underneath the essential fabric of our institutions today—state and\nmarket, our most basic conceptions of the nature of freedom, morality,\nsociality—all of which have been shaped by a history of war, conquest, and\nslavery in ways we’re no longer capable of even perceiving because we can no\nlonger imagine things any other way.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThere are obvious reasons why this is a particularly important moment to\nreexamine the history of debt. September 2008 saw the beginning of a financial\ncrisis that almost brought the entire world economy screeching to a halt. In\nmany ways the world economy did: ships stopped moving across the oceans, and\nthousands were placed in dry dock. Building cranes were dismantled, as no more\nbuildings were being put up. Banks largely ceased making loans. In the wake of\nthis, there was not only public rage and bewilderment, but the beginning of an\nactual public conversation about the nature of debt, of money, of the\nfinancial institutions that have come to hold the fate of nations in their\ngrip.\n\nBut that was just a moment. The conversation never ended up taking place.\n\nThe reason that people were ready for such a conversation was that the story\neveryone had been told for the last decade or so had just been revealed to be\na colossal lie. There’s really no nicer way to say it. For years, everyone had\nbeen hearing of a whole host of new, ultra-sophisticated financial\ninnovations: credit and commodity derivatives, collateralized mortgage\nobligation derivatives, hybrid securities, debt swaps, and so on. These new\nderivative markets were so incredibly sophisticated, that—according to one\npersistent story—a prominent investment house had to employ astrophysicists to\nrun trading programs so complex that even the financiers couldn’t begin to\nunderstand them. The message was transparent: leave these things to the\nprofessionals. You couldn’t possibly get your minds around this. Even if you\ndon’t like financial capitalists very much (and few seemed inclined to argue\nthat there was much to like about them), they were nothing if not capable, in\nfact so preternaturally capable, that democratic oversight of financial\nmarkets was simply inconceivable. (Even a lot of academics fell for it. I well\nremember going to conferences in 2006 and 2007 where trendy social theorists\npresented papers arguing that these new forms of securitization, linked to new\ninformation technologies, heralded a looming transformation in the very nature\nof time, possibility—reality itself. I remember thinking: “Suckers!” And so\nthey were.)\n\nThen, when the rubble had stopped bouncing, it turned out that many if not\nmost of them had been nothing more than very elaborate scams. They consisted\nof operations like selling poor families mortgages crafted in such a way as to\nmake eventual default inevitable; taking bets on how long it would take the\nholders to default; packaging mortgage and bet together and selling them to\ninstitutional investors (representing, perhaps, the mortgage-holders’\nretirement accounts) claiming that it would make money no matter what\nhappened, and allow said investors to pass such packages around as if they\nwere money; turning over responsibility for paying off the bet to a giant\ninsurance conglomerate that, were it to sink beneath the weight of its\nresultant debt (which certainly would happen), would then have to be bailed\nout by taxpayers (as such conglomerates were indeed bailed\nout).[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts011) In other words, it\nlooks very much like an unusually elaborate version of what banks were doing\nwhen they lent money to dictators in Bolivia and Gabon in the late ’70s: make\nutterly irresponsible loans with the full knowledge that, once it became known\nthey had done so, politicians and bureaucrats would scramble to ensure that\nthey’d still be reimbursed anyway, no matter how many human lives had to be\ndevastated and destroyed in order to do it.\n\nThe difference, though, was that this time, the bankers were doing it on an\ninconceivable scale: the total amount of debt they had run up was larger than\nthe combined Gross Domestic Products of every country in the world—and it\nthrew the world into a tailspin and almost destroyed the system itself.\n\nArmies and police geared up to combat the expected riots and unrest, but none\nmaterialized. But neither have any significant changes in how the system is\nrun. At the time, everyone assumed that, with the very defining institutions\nof capitalism (Lehman Brothers, Citibank, General Motors) crumbling, and all\nclaims to superior wisdom revealed to be false, we would at least restart a\nbroader conversation about the nature of debt and credit institutions. And not\njust a convwersation.\n\nIt seemed that most Americans were open to radical solutions. Surveys showed\nthat an overwhelming majority of Americans felt that the banks should not be\nrescued, _whatever the economic consequences_ , but that ordinary citizens\nstuck with bad mortgages should be bailed out. In the United States this is\nquite extraordinary. Since colonial days, Americans have been the population\nleast sympathetic to debtors. In a way this is odd, since America was settled\nlargely by absconding debtors, but it’s a country where the idea that morality\nis a matter of paying one’s debts runs deeper than almost any other. In\ncolonial days, an insolvent debtor’s ear was often nailed to a post. The\nUnited States was one of the last countries in the world to adopt a law of\nbankruptcy: despite the fact that in 1787, the Constitution specifically\ncharged the new government with creating one, all attempts were rejected on\n“moral grounds” until 1898.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts012)\nThe change was epochal. For this very reason, perhaps, those in charge of\nmoderating debate in the media and legislatures decided that this was not the\ntime. The United States government effectively put a three-trillion-dollar\nBand-Aid over the problem and changed nothing. The bankers were rescued;\nsmall-scale debtors—with a paltry few exceptions—were\nnot.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts013) To the contrary, in\nthe middle of the greatest economic recession since the ’30s, we are already\nbeginning to see a backlash against them—driven by financial corporations who\nhave now turned to the same government that bailed them out to apply the full\nforce of the law against ordinary citizens in financial trouble. “It’s not a\ncrime to owe money,” reports the Minneapolis-St. Paul _StarTribune_ , “But\npeople are routinely being thrown in jail for failing to pay debts.” In\nMinnesota, “the use of arrest warrants against debtors has jumped 60 percent\nover the past four years, with 845 cases in 2009 … In Illinois and southwest\nIndiana, some judges jail debtors for missing court-ordered debt payments. In\nextreme cases, people stay in jail until they raise a minimum payment. In\nJanuary [2010], a judge sentenced a Kenney, Ill., man ‘to indefinite\nincarceration’ until he came up with $300 toward a lumber yard\ndebt.”[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts014)\n\nIn other words, we are moving toward a restoration of something much like\ndebtors’ prisons. Meanwhile, the conversation stopped dead, popular rage\nagainst bailouts sputtered into incoherence, and we seem to be tumbling\ninexorably toward the next great financial catastrophe—the only real question\nbeing just how long it will take.\n\nWe have reached the point at which the IMF itself, now trying to reposition\nitself as the conscience of global capitalism, has begun to issue warnings\nthat if we continue on the present course, no bailout is likely to be\nforthcoming the next time. The public simply will not stand for it, and as a\nresult, everything really will come apart. “IMF Warns Second Bailout Would\n‘Threaten Democracy’ ” reads one recent\nheadline.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-nts015) (Of course by\n“democracy” they mean “capitalism.”) Surely it means something that even those\nwho feel they are responsible for keeping the current global economic system\nrunning, who just a few years ago acted as if they could simply assume the\ncurrent system would be around forever, are now seeing apocalypse everywhere.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIn this case, the IMF has a point. We have every reason to believe that we do\nindeed stand on the brink of epochal changes.\n\nAdmittedly, the usual impulse is to imagine everything around us as absolutely\nnew. Nowhere is this so true as with money. How many times have we been told\nthat the advent of virtual money, the dematerialization of cash into plastic\nand dollars into blips of electronic information, has brought us to an\nunprecedented new financial world? The assumption that we were in such\nuncharted territory, of course, was one of the things that made it so easy for\nthe likes of Goldman Sachs and AIG to convince people that no one could\npossibly understand their dazzling new financial instruments. The moment one\ncasts matters on a broad historical scale, though, the first thing one learns\nis that there’s nothing new about virtual money. Actually, this was the\noriginal form of money. Credit system, tabs, even expense accounts, all\nexisted long before cash. These things are as old as civilization itself.\nTrue, we also find that history tends to move back and forth between periods\ndominated by bullion—where it’s assumed that gold and silver _are_ money—and\nperiods where money is assumed to be an abstraction, a virtual unit of\naccount. But historically, credit money comes first, and what we are\nwitnessing today is a return of assumptions that would have been considered\nobvious common sense in, say, the Middle Ages—or even ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nBut history does provide fascinating hints of what we might expect. For\ninstance: in the past, ages of virtual credit money almost invariably involve\nthe creation of institutions designed to prevent everything going haywire—to\nstop the lenders from teaming up with bureaucrats and politicians to squeeze\neverybody dry, as they seem to be doing now. They are accompanied by the\ncreation of institutions designed to protect debtors. The new age of credit\nmoney we are in seems to have started precisely backwards. It began with the\ncreation of global institutions like the IMF designed to protect not debtors,\nbut creditors. At the same time, on the kind of historical scale we’re talking\nabout here, a decade or two is nothing. We have very little idea what to\nexpect.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThis book is a history of debt, then, but it also uses that history as a way\nto ask fundamental questions about what human beings and human society are or\ncould be like—what we actually do owe each other, what it even means to ask\nthat question. As a result, the book begins by attempting to puncture a series\nof myths—not only the Myth of Barter, which is taken up in the first chapter,\nbut also rival myths about primordial debts to the gods, or to the state—that\nin one way or another form the basis of our common-sense assumptions about the\nnature of economy and society. In that common-sense view, the State and the\nMarket tower above all else as diametrically opposed principles. Historical\nreality reveals, however, that they were born together and have always been\nintertwined. The one thing that all these misconceptions have in common, we\nwill find, is that they tend to reduce all human relations to exchange, as if\nour ties to society, even to the cosmos itself, can be imagined in the same\nterms as a business deal. This leads to another question: If not exchange,\nthen what? In chapter five, I will begin to answer the question by drawing on\nthe fruits of anthropology to describe a view of the moral basis of economic\nlife; then return to the question of the origins of money to demonstrate how\nthe very principle of exchange emerged largely as an effect of violence—that\nthe real origins of money are to be found in crime and recompense, war and\nslavery, honor, debt, and redemption. That, in turn, opens the way to\nstarting, with chapter eight, an actual history of the last five thousand\nyears of debt and credit, with its great alternations between ages of virtual\nand physical money. Many of the discoveries here are profoundly unexpected:\nfrom the origins of modern conceptions of rights and freedoms in ancient slave\nlaw, to the origins of investment capital in medieval Chinese Buddhism, to the\nfact that many of Adam Smith’s most famous arguments appear to have been\ncribbed from the works of free-market theorists from medieval Persia (a story\nwhich, incidentally, has interesting implications for understanding the\ncurrent appeal of political Islam). All of this sets the stage for a fresh\napproach to the last five hundred years, dominated by capitalist empires, and\nallows us to at least begin asking what might really be at stake in the\npresent day.\n\nFor a very long time, the intellectual consensus has been that we can no\nlonger ask Great Questions. Increasingly, it’s looking like we have no other\nchoice.\n\n\n# **Chapter Two**  \n  \n**THE MYTH OF BARTER**\n\n_For every subtle and complicated question, there is a perfectly simple and\nstraightforward answer, which is wrong_.\n\n—H.L. Mencken\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE between a mere obligation, a sense that one ought to\nbehave in a certain way, or even that one owes something to someone, and a\n_debt_ , properly speaking? The answer is simple: money. The difference\nbetween a debt and an obligation is that a debt can be precisely quantified.\nThis requires money.\n\nNot only is it money that makes debt possible: money and debt appear on the\nscene at exactly the same time. Some of the very first written documents that\nhave come down to us are Mesopotamian tablets recording credits and debits,\nrations issued by temples, money owed for rent of temple lands, the value of\neach precisely specified in grain and silver. Some of the earliest works of\nmoral philosophy, in turn, are reflections on what it means to imagine\nmorality as debt—that is, in terms of money.\n\nA history of debt, then, is thus necessarily a history of money—and the\neasiest way to understand the role that debt has played in human society is\nsimply to follow the forms that money has taken, and the way money has been\nused, across the centuries—and the arguments that inevitably ensued about what\nall this means. Still, this is necessarily a very different history of money\nthan we are used to. When economists speak of the origins of money, for\nexample, debt is always something of an afterthought. First comes barter, then\nmoney; credit only develops later. Even if one consults books on the history\nof money in, say, France, India, or China, what one generally gets is a\nhistory of coinage, with barely any discussion of credit arrangements at all.\nFor almost a century, anthropologists like me have been pointing out that\nthere is something very wrong with this picture. The standard economic-history\nversion has little to do with anything we observe when we examine how economic\nlife is actually conducted, in real communities and marketplaces, almost\nanywhere—where one is much more likely to discover everyone in debt to\neveryone else in a dozen different ways, and that most transactions take place\nwithout the use of currency.\n\nWhy the discrepancy?\n\nSome of it is just the nature of the evidence: coins are preserved in the\narcheological record; credit arrangements usually are not. Still, the problem\nruns deeper. The existence of credit and debt has always been something of a\nscandal for economists, since it’s almost impossible to pretend that those\nlending and borrowing money are acting on purely “economic” motivations (for\ninstance, that a loan to a stranger is the same as a loan to one’s cousin); it\nseems important, therefore, to begin the story of money in an imaginary world\nfrom which credit and debt have been entirely erased. Before we can apply the\ntools of anthropology to reconstruct the real history of money, we need to\nunderstand what’s wrong with the conventional account.\n\nEconomists generally speak of three functions of money: medium of exchange,\nunit of account, and store of value. All economic textbooks treat the first as\nprimary. Here’s a fairly typical extract from _Economics_ , by Case, Fair,\nGärtner, and Heather (1996)**:**\n\nMoney is vital to the working of a market economy. Imagine what life would be\nlike without it. The alternative to a monetary economy is barter, people\nexchanging goods and services for other goods and services directly instead of\nexchanging via the medium of money.\n\nHow does a barter system work? Suppose you want croissants, eggs and orange\njuice for breakfast. Instead of going to the grocer’s and buying these things\nwith money, you would have to find someone who has these items and is willing\nto trade them. You would also have to have something the baker, the orange\njuice purveyor and the egg vendor want. Having pencils to trade will do you no\ngood if the baker and the orange juice and egg sellers do not want pencils.\n\nA barter system requires a double coincidence of wants for trade to take\nplace. That is, to effect a trade, I need not only have to find someone who\nhas what I want, but that person must also want what I have. Where the range\nof traded goods is small, as it is in relatively unsophisticated economies, it\nis not difficult to find someone to trade with, and barter is often\nused.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts001)\n\nThis latter point is questionable, but it’s phrased in so vague a way that it\nwould be hard to disprove.\n\nIn a complex society with many goods, barter exchanges involve an intolerable\namount of effort. Imagine trying to find people who offer for sale all the\nthings you buy in a typical trip to the grocer’s, and who are willing to\naccept goods that you have to offer in exchange for their goods.\n\nSome agreed-upon medium of exchange (or means of payment) neatly eliminates\nthe double coincidence of wants\nproblem.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts002)\n\nIt’s important to emphasize that this is not presented as something that\nactually happened, but as a purely imaginary exercise. “To see that society\nbenefits from a medium of exchange” write Begg, Fischer and Dornbuch\n(_Economics_ , 2005), “imagine a barter economy.” “Imagine the difficulty you\nwould have today,” write Maunder, Myers, Wall, and Miller (_Economics\nExplained_ , 1991), “if you had to exchange your labor directly for the fruits\nof someone else’s labor.” “Imagine,” write Parkin and King (_Economics_ ,\n1995), “you have roosters, but you want\nroses.”[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts003) One could multiply\nexamples endlessly. Just about every economics textbook employed today sets\nout the problem the same way. Historically, they note, we know that there was\na time when there was no money. What must it have been like? Well, let us\nimagine an economy something like today’s, except with no money. That would\nhave been decidedly inconvenient! Surely, people must have invented money for\nthe sake of efficiency.\n\nThe story of money for economists always begins with a fantasy world of\nbarter. The problem is where to locate this fantasy in time and space: Are we\ntalking about cave men, Pacific Islanders, the American frontier? One\ntextbook, by economists Joseph Stiglitz and John Driffill, takes us to what\nappears to be an imaginary New England or Midwestern town:\n\nOne can imagine an old-style farmer bartering with the blacksmith, the tailor,\nthe grocer, and the doctor in his small town. For simple barter to work,\nhowever, there must be a double coincidence of wants … Henry has potatoes and\nwants shoes, Joshua has an extra pair of shoes and wants potatoes. Bartering\ncan make them both happier. But if Henry has firewood and Joshua does not need\nany of that, then bartering for Joshua’s shoes requires one or both of them to\ngo searching for more people in the hope of making a multilateral exchange.\nMoney provides a way to make multilateral exchange much simpler. Henry sells\nhis firewood to someone else for money and uses the money to buy Joshua’s\nshoes.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts004)\n\nAgain this is just a make-believe land much like the present, except with\nmoney somehow plucked away. As a result it makes no sense: Who in their right\nmind would set up a grocery in such a place? And how would they get supplies?\nBut let’s leave that aside. There is a simple reason why everyone who writes\nan economics textbook feels they have to tell us the same story. For\neconomists, it is in a very real sense the most important story ever told. It\nwas by telling it, in the significant year of 1776, that Adam Smith, professor\nof moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow, effectively brought the\ndiscipline of economics into being.\n\nHe did not make up the story entirely out of whole cloth. Already in 330 bc,\nAristotle was speculating along vaguely similar lines in his treatise on\npolitics. At first, he suggested, families must have produced everything they\nneeded for themselves. Gradually, some would presumably have specialized, some\ngrowing corn, others making wine, swapping one for the\nother.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts005) Money, Aristotle\nassumed, must have emerged from such a process. But, like the medieval\nschoolmen who occasionally repeated the story, Aristotle was never clear as to\nhow.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts006)\n\nIn the years after Columbus, as Spanish and Portuguese adventurers were\nscouring the world for new sources of gold and silver, these vague stories\ndisappear. Certainly no one reported discovering a land of barter. Most\nsixteenth- and seventeenth-century travelers in the West Indies or Africa\nassumed that all societies would necessarily have their own forms of money,\nsince all societies had governments and all governments issued\nmoney.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts007)\n\nAdam Smith, on the other hand, was determined to overturn the conventional\nwisdom of his day. Above all, he objected to the notion that money was a\ncreation of government. In this, Smith was the intellectual heir of the\nLiberal tradition of philosophers like John Locke, who had argued that\ngovernment begins in the need to protect private property and operated best\nwhen it tried to limit itself to that function. Smith expanded on the\nargument, insisting that property, money and markets not only existed before\npolitical institutions but were the very foundation of human society. It\nfollowed that insofar as government should play any role in monetary affairs,\nit should limit itself to guaranteeing the soundness of the currency. It was\nonly by making such an argument that he could insist that economics is itself\na field of human inquiry with its own principles and laws—that is, as distinct\nfrom, say ethics or politics.\n\nSmith’s argument is worth laying out in detail because it is, as I say, the\ngreat founding myth of the discipline of economics.\n\nWhat, he begins, is the basis of economic life, properly speaking? It is “a\ncertain propensity in human nature … the propensity to truck, barter, and\nexchange one thing for another.” Animals don’t do this. “Nobody,” Smith\nobserves, “ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for\nanother with another dog.”[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts008)\nBut humans, if left to their own devices, will inevitably begin swapping and\ncomparing things. This is just what humans do. Even logic and conversation are\nreally just forms of trading, and as in all things, humans will always try to\nseek their own best advantage, to seek the greatest profit they can from the\nexchange.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts009)\n\nIt is this drive to exchange, in turn, which creates that division of labor\nresponsible for all human achievement and civilization. Here the scene shifts\nto another one of those economists’ faraway fantasylands—it seems to be an\namalgam of North American Indians and Central Asian pastoral\nnomads:[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts010)\n\nIn a tribe of hunters or shepherds a particular person makes bows and arrows,\nfor example, with more readiness and dexterity than any other. He frequently\nexchanges them for cattle or for venison with his companions; and he finds at\nlast that he can in this manner get more cattle and venison, than if he\nhimself went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest,\ntherefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and\nhe becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers\nof their little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this\nway to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with\nvenison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to\nthis employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same manner a\nthird becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth a tanner or dresser of hides or\nskins, the principal part of the clothing of savages …\n\nIt’s only once we have expert arrow-makers, wigwam-makers, and so on that\npeople start realizing there’s a problem. Notice how, as in so many examples,\nwe have a tendency to slip from imaginary savages to small-town shopkeepers.\n\nBut when the division of labor first began to take place, this power of\nexchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in its\noperations. One man, we shall suppose, has more of a certain commodity than he\nhimself has occasion for, while another has less. The former consequently\nwould be glad to dispose of, and the latter to purchase, a part of this\nsuperfluity. But if this latter should chance to have nothing that the former\nstands in need of, no exchange can be made between them. The butcher has more\nmeat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the brewer and the baker\nwould each of them be willing to purchase a part of it. But they have nothing\nto offer in exchange …\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIn order to avoid the inconveniency of such situations, every prudent man in\nevery period of society, after the first establishment of the division of\nlabor, must naturally have endeavored to manage his affairs in such a manner,\nas to have at all times by him, besides the peculiar produce of his own\nindustry, a certain quantity of some one commodity or other, such as he\nimagined that few people would be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce\nof their industry.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts011)\n\nSo everyone will inevitably start stockpiling something they figure that\neveryone else is likely to want. This has a paradoxical effect, because at a\ncertain point, rather than making that commodity less valuable (since everyone\nalready has some) it becomes more valuable (because it becomes, effectively,\ncurrency):\n\nSalt is said to be the common instrument of commerce and exchanges in\nAbyssinia; a species of shells in some parts of the coast of India; dried cod\nat Newfoundland; tobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our West India\ncolonies; hides or dressed leather in some other countries; and there is at\nthis day a village in Scotland where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a\nworkman to carry nails instead of money to the baker’s shop or the ale-\nhouse.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts012)\n\nEventually, of course, at least for long-distance trade, it all boils down to\nprecious metals, since these are ideally suited to serve as currency, being\ndurable, portable, and able to be endlessly subdivided into identical\nportions.\n\nDifferent metals have been made use of by different nations for this purpose.\nIron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient Spartans; copper\namong the ancient Romans; and gold and silver among all rich and commercial\nnations.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThose metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in rude\nbars, without any stamp or coinage …\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very considerable\ninconveniencies; first with the trouble of weighing; and, secondly, with that\nof assaying them. In the precious metals, where a small difference in the\nquantity makes a great difference in the value, even the business of weighing,\nwith proper exactness, requires at least very accurate weights and scales. The\nweighing of gold in particular is an operation of some nicety\n…[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts013)\n\nIt’s easy to see where this is going. Using irregular metal ingots is easier\nthan barter, but wouldn’t standardizing the units—say, stamping pieces of\nmetal with uniform designations guaranteeing weight and fineness, in different\ndenominations—make things easier still? Clearly it would, and so was coinage\nborn. True, issuing coinage meant governments had to get involved, since they\ngenerally ran the mints; but in the standard version of the story, governments\nhave only this one limited role—to guarantee the money supply—and tend to do\nit badly, since throughout history, unscrupulous kings have often cheated by\ndebasing the coinage and causing inflation and other sorts of political havoc\nin what was originally a matter of simple economic common sense.\n\nTellingly, this story played a crucial role not only in founding the\ndiscipline of economics, but in the very idea that there was something called\n“the economy,” which operated by its own rules, separate from moral or\npolitical life, that economists could take as their field of study. “The\neconomy” is where we indulge in our natural propensity to truck and barter. We\nare still trucking and bartering. We always will be. Money is simply the most\nefficient means.\n\nEconomists like Karl Menger and Stanley Jevons later improved on the details\nof the story, most of all by adding various mathematical equations to\ndemonstrate that a random assortment of people with random desires could, in\ntheory, produce not only a single commodity to use as money but a uniform\nprice system. In the process, they also substituted all sorts of impressive\ntechnical vocabulary (i.e., “inconveniences” became “transaction costs”). The\ncrucial thing, though, is that by now, this story has become simple common\nsense for most people. We teach it to children in schoolbooks and museums.\nEverybody knows it. “Once upon a time, there was barter. It was difficult. So\npeople invented money. Then came the development of banking and credit.” It\nall forms a perfectly simple, straightforward progression, a process of\nincreasing sophistication and abstraction that has carried humanity, logically\nand inexorably, from the Stone Age exchange of mastodon tusks to stock\nmarkets, hedge funds, and securitized\nderivatives.[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts014)\n\nIt really has become ubiquitous. Wherever we find money, we also find the\nstory. At one point, in the town of Arivonimamo, in Madagascar, I had the\nprivilege of interviewing a Kalanoro, a tiny ghostly creature that a local\nspirit medium claimed to keep hidden away in a chest in his home. The spirit\nbelonged to the brother of a notorious local loan shark, a horrible woman\nnamed Nordine, and to be honest I was a bit reluctant to have anything to do\nwith the family, but some of my friends insisted—since after all, this was a\ncreature from ancient times. The creature spoke from behind a screen in an\neerie, otherworldly quaver. But all it was really interested in talking about\nwas money. Finally, slightly exasperated by the whole charade, I asked, “So,\nwhat did you use for money back in ancient times, when you were still alive?”\n\nThe mysterious voice immediately replied, “No. We didn’t use money. In ancient\ntimes we used to barter commodities directly, one for the other …”\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe story, then, is everywhere. It is the founding myth of our system of\neconomic relations. It is so deeply established in common sense, even in\nplaces like Madagascar, that most people on earth couldn’t imagine any other\nway that money possibly could have come about.\n\nThe problem is there’s no evidence that it ever happened, and an enormous\namount of evidence suggesting that it did not.\n\nFor centuries now, explorers have been trying to find this fabled land of\nbarter—none with success. Adam Smith set his story in aboriginal North America\n(others preferred Africa or the Pacific). In Smith’s time, at least it could\nbe said that reliable information on Native American economic systems was\nunavailable in Scottish libraries. But by mid-century, Lewis Henry Morgan’s\ndescriptions of the Six Nations of the Iroquois, among others, were widely\npublished—and they made clear that the main economic institution among the\nIroquois nations were longhouses where most goods were stockpiled and then\nallocated by women’s councils, and no one ever traded arrowheads for slabs of\nmeat. Economists simply ignored this\ninformation.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts015) Stanley\nJevons, for example, who in 1871 wrote what has come to be considered the\nclassic book on the origins of money, took his examples straight from Smith,\nwith Indians swapping venison for elk and beaver hides, and made no use of\nactual descriptions of Indian life that made it clear that Smith had simply\nmade this up. Around that same time, missionaries, adventurers, and colonial\nadministrators were fanning out across the world, many bringing copies of\nSmith’s book with them, expecting to find the land of barter. None ever did.\nThey discovered an almost endless variety of economic systems. But to this\nday, no one has been able to locate a part of the world where the ordinary\nmode of economic transaction between neighbors takes the form of “I’ll give\nyou twenty chickens for that cow.”\n\nThe definitive anthropological work on barter, by Caroline Humphrey, of\nCambridge, could not be more definitive in its conclusions: “No example of a\nbarter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the\nemergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there\nnever has been such a\nthing.”[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts016)\n\nNow, all this hardly means that barter does not exist—or even that it’s never\npracticed by the sort of people that Smith would refer to as “savages.” It\njust means that it’s almost never employed, as Smith imagined, between fellow\nvillagers. Ordinarily, it takes place between strangers, even enemies. Let us\nbegin with the Nambikwara of Brazil. They would seem to fit all the criteria:\nthey are a simple society without much in the way of division of labor,\norganized into small bands that traditionally numbered at best a hundred\npeople each. Occasionally if one band spots the cooking fires of another in\ntheir vicinity, they will send emissaries to negotiate a meeting for purposes\nof trade. If the offer is accepted, they will first hide their women and\nchildren in the forest, then invite the men of other band to visit camp. Each\nband has a chief; once everyone has been assembled, each chief gives a formal\nspeech praising the other party and belittling his own; everyone puts aside\ntheir weapons to sing and dance together—though the dance is one that mimics\nmilitary confrontation. Then, individuals from each side approach each other\nto trade:\n\nIf an individual wants an object he extols it by saying how fine it is. If a\nman values an object and wants much in exchange for it, instead of saying that\nit is very valuable he says that it is no good, thus showing his desire to\nkeep it. “This axe is no good, it is very old, it is very dull,” he will say,\nreferring to his axe which the other wants.\n\nThis argument is carried on in an angry tone of voice until a settlement is\nreached. When agreement has been reached each snatches the object out of the\nother’s hand. If a man has bartered a necklace, instead of taking it off and\nhanding it over, the other person must take it off with a show of force.\nDisputes, often leading to fights, occur when one party is a little premature\nand snatches the object before the other has finished\narguing.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts017)\n\nThe whole business concludes with a great feast at which the women reappear,\nbut this too can lead to problems, since amidst the music and good cheer,\nthere is ample opportunity for\nseductions.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts018) This sometimes\nled to jealous quarrels. Occasionally, people would get killed.\n\nBarter, then, for all the festive elements, was carried out between people who\nmight otherwise be enemies and hovered about an inch away from outright\nwarfare—and, if the ethnographer is to be believed—if one side later decided\nthey had been taken advantage of, it could very easily lead to actual wars.\n\nTo shift our spotlight halfway around the world to Western Arnhem Land in\nAustralia, where the Gunwinggu people are famous for entertaining neighbors in\nrituals of ceremonial barter called the _dzamalag_. Here the threat of actual\nviolence seems much more distant. Partly, this is because things are made\neasier by the existence of a moiety system that embraces the whole region: no\none is allowed to marry, or even have sex with, people of their own moiety, no\nmatter where they come from, but anyone from the other is technically a\npotential match. Therefore, for a man, even in distant communities, half the\nwomen are strictly forbidden, half of them fair game. The region is also\nunited by local specialization: each people has its own trade product to be\nbartered with the others.\n\nWhat follows is from a description of a _dzamalag_ held in the 1940s, as\nobserved by an anthropologist named Ronald Berndt.\n\nOnce again, it begins as strangers, after some initial negotiations, are\ninvited into the hosts’ main camp. The visitors in this particular example\nwere famous for their “much-prized serrated spears”—their hosts had access to\ngood European cloth. The trading begins when the visiting party, which\nconsisted of both men and women, enters the camp’s dancing ground of “ring\nplace,” and three of them began to entertain their hosts with music. Two men\nstart singing, a third accompanies them on the _didjeridu_. Before long, women\nfrom the hosts’ side come and attack the musicians:\n\nMen and women rise and begin to dance. The _dzamalag_ opens when two Gunwinggu\nwomen of the opposite moiety to the singing men “give _dzamalag”_ to the\nlatter. They present each man with a piece of cloth, and hit or touch him,\npulling him down on the ground, calling him a _dzamalag_ husband, and joking\nwith him in an erotic vein. Then another woman of the opposite moiety to the\npipe player gives him cloth, hits and jokes with him.\n\nThis sets in motion the _dzamalag_ exchange. Men from the visiting group sit\nquietly while women of the opposite moiety come over and give them cloth, hit\nthem, and invite them to copulate; they take any liberty they choose with the\nmen, amid amusement and applause, while the singing and dancing continue.\nWomen try to undo the men’s loin coverings or touch their penises, and to drag\nthem from the “ring place” for coitus. The men go with their _dzamalag_\npartners, with a show of reluctance, to copulate in the bushes away from the\nfires which light up the dancers. They may give the women tobacco or beads.\nWhen the women return, they give part of this tobacco to their own husbands,\nwho have encouraged them to go _dzamalag_. The husbands, in turn, use the\ntobacco to pay their own female _dzamalag_ partners\n…[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts019)\n\nNew singers and musicians appear, are again assaulted and dragged off to the\nbushes; men encourage their wives “not to be shy,” so as to maintain the\nGunwinggu reputation for hospitality; eventually those men also take the\ninitiative with the visitors’ wives, offering cloth, hitting them, and leading\nthem off into the bushes. Beads and tobacco circulate. Finally, once\nparticipants have all paired off at least once, and the guests are satisfied\nwith the cloth they have acquired, the women stop dancing and stand in two\nrows and the visitors line up to repay them.\n\nThen visiting men of one moiety dance towards the women of the opposite\nmoiety, in order to “give them _dzamalag.”_ They hold shovel-nosed spears\npoised, pretending to spear the women, but instead hit them with the flat of\nthe blade. “We will not spear you, for we have already speared you with our\npenises.” They present the spears to the women. Then visiting men of the other\nmoiety go through the same actions with the women of their opposite moiety,\ngiving them spears with serrated points. This terminates the ceremony, which\nis followed by a large distribution of\nfood.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts020)\n\nThis is a particularly dramatic case, but dramatic cases are revealing. What\nthe Gunwinggu hosts appear to have been able to do here, owing to the\nrelatively amicable relations between neighboring peoples in Western Arnhem\nLand, is to take all the elements in Nambikwara barter (the music and dancing,\nthe potential hostility, the sexual intrigue), and turn it all into a kind of\nfestive game—one not, perhaps, without its dangers, but (as the ethnographer\nemphasizes) considered enormous fun by everyone concerned.\n\nWhat all such cases of trade through barter have in common is that they are\nmeetings with strangers who will, likely as not, never meet again, and with\nwhom one certainly will not enter into any ongoing relations. This is why a\ndirect one-on-one exchange is appropriate: each side makes their trade and\nwalks away. It’s all made possible by laying down an initial mantle of\nsociability, in the form of shared pleasures, music and dance—the usual base\nof conviviality on which trade must always be built. Then comes the actual\ntrading, where both sides make a great display of the latent hostility that\nnecessarily exists in any exchange of material goods between strangers—where\nneither party has no particular reason _not_ to take advantage of the other—by\nplayful mock aggression, though in the Nambikwara case, where the mantle of\nsociability is extremely thin, mock aggression is in constant danger of\nslipping over into the real thing. The Gunwinggu, with their more relaxed\nattitude toward sexuality, have quite ingeniously managed to make the shared\npleasures and aggression into exactly the same thing.\n\nRecall here the language of the economics textbooks: “Imagine a society\nwithout money.” “Imagine a barter economy.” One thing these examples make\nabundantly clear is just how limited the imaginative powers of most economists\nturn out to be.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts021)\n\nWhy? The simplest answer would be: for there to even be a discipline called\n“economics,” a discipline that concerns itself first and foremost with how\nindividuals seek the most advantageous arrangement for the exchange of shoes\nfor potatoes, or cloth for spears, it must assume that the exchange of such\ngoods need have nothing to do with war, passion, adventure, mystery, sex, or\ndeath. Economics assumes a division between different spheres of human\nbehavior that, among people like the Gunwinngu and the Nambikwara, simply does\nnot exist. These divisions in turn are made possible by very specific\ninstitutional arrangements: the existence of lawyers, prisons, and police, to\nensure that even people who don’t like each other very much, who have no\ninterest in developing any kind of ongoing relationship, but are simply\ninterested in getting their hands on as much of the others’ possessions as\npossible, will nonetheless refrain from the most obvious expedient (theft).\nThis in turn allows us to assume that life is neatly divided between the\nmarketplace, where we do our shopping, and the “sphere of consumption,” where\nwe concern ourselves with music, feasts, and seduction. In other words, the\nvision of the world that forms the basis of the economics textbooks, which\nAdam Smith played so large a part in promulgating, has by now become so much a\npart of our common sense that we find it hard to imagine any other possible\narrangement.\n\nFrom these examples, it begins to be clear why there are no societies based on\nbarter. Such a society could only be one in which everybody was an inch away\nfrom everybody else’s throat; but nonetheless hovering there, poised to strike\nbut never actually striking, forever. True, barter does sometimes occur\nbetween people who do not consider each other strangers, but they’re usually\npeople who might as well be strangers—that is, who feel no sense of mutual\nresponsibility or trust, or the desire to develop ongoing relations. The\nPukhtun of Northern Pakistan, for instance, are famous for their open-handed\nhospitality. Barter is what you do with those to whom you are _not_ bound by\nties of hospitality (or kinship, or much of anything else):\n\nA favorite mode of exchange among men is barter, or _adal-badal_ (give and\ntake). Men are always on the alert for the possibility of bartering one of\ntheir possessions for something better. Often the exchange is like for like: a\nradio for a radio, sunglasses for sunglasses, a watch for a watch. However,\nunlike objects can also be exchanged, such as, in one instance, a bicycle for\ntwo donkeys. _Adal-badal_ is always practiced with non-relatives and affords\nmen a great deal of pleasure as they attempt to get the advantage over their\nexchange partner. A good exchange, in which a man feels he has gotten the\nbetter of the deal, is cause for bragging and pride. If the exchange is bad,\nthe recipient tries to renege on the deal or, failing that, to palm off the\nfaulty object on someone unsuspecting. The best partner in _adal-badal_ is\nsomeone who is distant spatially and will therefore have little opportunity to\ncomplain.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts022)\n\nNeither are such unscrupulous motives limited to Central Asia. They seem\ninherent to the very nature of barter—which would explain the fact that in the\ncentury or two before Smith’s time, the English words “truck and barter,” like\ntheir equivalents in French, Spanish, German, Dutch, and Portuguese, literally\nmeant “to trick, bamboozle, or rip\noff.”[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts023) Swapping one thing\ndirectly for another while trying to get the best deal one can out of the\ntransaction is, ordinarily, how one deals with people one doesn’t care about\nand doesn’t expect to see again. What reason is there _not_ to try to take\nadvantage of such a person? If, on the other hand, one cares enough about\nsomeone—a neighbor, a friend—to wish to deal with her fairly and honestly, one\nwill inevitably also care about her enough to take her individual needs,\ndesires, and situation into account. Even if you do swap one thing for\nanother, you are likely to frame the matter as a gift.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nTo illustrate what I mean by this, let’s return to the economics textbooks and\nthe problem of the “double coincidence of wants.” When we left Henry, he\nneeded a pair of shoes, but all he had lying around were some potatoes. Joshua\nhad an extra pair of shoes, but he didn’t really need potatoes. Since money\nhas not yet been invented, they have a problem. What are they to do?\n\nThe first thing that should be clear by now is that we’d really have to know a\nbit more about Joshua and Henry. Who are they? Are they related? If so, how?\nThey appear to live in a small community. Any two people who have been living\ntheir lives in the same small community will have some sort of complicated\nhistory with each other. Are they friends, rivals, allies, lovers, enemies, or\nseveral of these things at once?\n\nThe authors of the original example seem to assume two neighbors of roughly\nequal status, not closely related, but on friendly terms—that is, as close to\nneutral equality as one can get. Even so, this doesn’t say much. For example,\nif Henry was living in a Seneca longhouse, and needed shoes, Joshua would not\neven enter into it; he’d simply mention it to his wife, who’d bring up the\nmatter with the other matrons, fetch materials from the longhouse’s collective\nstorehouse, and sew him some. Alternately, to find a scenario fit for an\nimaginary economics textbook, we might place Joshua and Henry together in a\nsmall, intimate community like a Nambikwara or Gunwinggu band.\n\nSCENARIO 1\n\nHenry walks up to Joshua and says “Nice shoes!”\n\nJoshua says, “Oh, they’re not much, but since you seem to like them, by all\nmeans take them.”\n\nHenry takes the shoes.\n\nHenry’s potatoes are not at issue since both parties are perfectly well aware\nthat if Joshua were ever short of potatoes, Henry would give him some.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Of course it’s not clear, in this case, how long Henry\nwill actually get to keep the shoes. It probably depends on how nice they are.\nIf they were just ordinary shoes, this might be the end of the matter. If they\nare in any way unique or beautiful, they might end up being passed around.\nThere’s a famous story that John and Lorna Marshall, who carried out a study\nof Kalahari Bushmen in the ’60s, once gave a knife to one of their favorite\ninformants. They left and came back a year later, only to discover that pretty\nmuch everyone in the band had been in possession of the knife at some point in\nbetween. On the other hand, several Arab friends confirm to me that in less\nstrictly egalitarian contexts, there is an expedient. If a friend praises a\nbracelet or bag, you are normally expected to immediately say “take it”—but if\nyou are really determined to hold on to it, you can always say, “yes, isn’t it\nbeautiful? It was a gift.”\n\nBut clearly, the authors of the textbook have a slightly more impersonal\ntransaction in mind. The authors seem to imagine the two men as the heads of\npatriarchal households, on good terms with each other, but who keep their own\nsupplies. Perhaps they live in one of those Scottish villages with the butcher\nand the baker in Adam Smith’s examples, or a colonial settlement in New\nEngland. Except for some reason they’ve never heard of money. It’s a peculiar\nfantasy, but let’s see what we can do:\n\nSCENARIO 2\n\nHenry walks up to Joshua and says, “Nice shoes!”\n\nOr, perhaps—let’s make this a bit more realistic—Henry’s wife is chatting with\nJoshua’s and strategically lets slip that the state of Henry’s shoes is\ngetting so bad he’s complaining about corns.\n\nThe message is conveyed, and Joshua comes by the next day to offer his extra\npair to Henry as a present, insisting that this is just a neighborly gesture.\nHe would certainly never want anything in return.\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether Joshua is sincere in saying this. By doing so,\nJoshua thereby registers a credit. Henry owes him one.\n\nHow might Henry pay Joshua back? There are endless possibilities. Perhaps\nJoshua really does want potatoes. Henry waits a discrete interval and drops\nthem off, insisting that this too is just a gift. Or Joshua doesn’t need\npotatoes now but Henry waits until he does. Or maybe a year later, Joshua is\nplanning a banquet, so he comes strolling by Henry’s barnyard and says “Nice\npig …”\n\nIn any of these scenarios, the problem of “double coincidence of wants,” so\nendlessly invoked in the economics textbooks, simply disappears. Henry might\nnot have something Joshua wants right now. But if the two are neighbors, it’s\nobviously only a matter of time before he\nwill.[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts024)\n\nThis in turn means that the need to stockpile commonly acceptable items in the\nway that Smith suggested disappears as well. With it goes the need to develop\ncurrency. As with so many actual small communities, everyone simply keeps\ntrack of who owes what to whom.\n\nThere is just one major conceptual problem here—one the attentive reader might\nhave noticed. Henry “owes Joshua one.” One what? How do you quantify a favor?\nOn what basis do you say that this many potatoes, or this big a pig, seems\nmore or less equivalent to a pair of shoes? Because even if these things\nremain rough-and-ready approximations, there must be _some_ way to establish\nthat X is roughly equivalent to Y, or slightly worse or slightly better.\nDoesn’t this imply that something like money, at least in the sense of a unit\nof accounts by which one can compare the value of different objects, already\nhas to exist?\n\nIn most gift economies, there actually is a rough-and-ready way to solve the\nproblem. One establishes a series of ranked categories of _types_ of thing.\nPigs and shoes may be considered objects of roughly equivalent status, one can\ngive one in return for the other; coral necklaces are quite another matter,\none would have to give back another necklace, or at least another piece of\njewelry—anthropologists are used to referring to these as creating different\n“spheres of exchange.”[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts025) This\ndoes simplify things somewhat. When cross-cultural barter becomes a regular\nand unexceptional thing, it tends to operate according to similar principles:\nthere are only certain things traded for certain others (cloth for spears, for\nexample), which makes it easy to work out traditional equivalences. However,\nthis doesn’t help us at all with the problem of the origin of money. Actually,\nit makes it infinitely worse. Why stockpile salt or gold or fish if they can\nonly be exchanged for some things and not others?\n\nIn fact, there is good reason to believe that barter is not a particularly\nancient phenomenon at all, but has only really become widespread in modern\ntimes. Certainly in most of the cases we know about, it takes place between\npeople who are familiar with the use of money, but for one reason or another,\ndon’t have a lot of it around. Elaborate barter systems often crop up in the\nwake of the collapse of national economies: most recently in Russia in the\n’90s, and in Argentina around 2002, when rubles in the first case, and dollars\nin the second, effectively\ndisappeared.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts026) Occasionally\none can even find some kind of currency beginning to develop: for instance, in\nPOW camps and many prisons, inmates have indeed been known to use cigarettes\nas a kind of currency, much to the delight and excitement of professional\neconomists.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts027) But here too we\nare talking about people who grew up using money and now have to make do\nwithout it—exactly the situation “imagined” by the economics textbooks with\nwhich I began.\n\nThe more frequent solution is to adopt some sort of credit system. When much\nof Europe “reverted to barter” after the collapse of the Roman Empire, and\nthen again after the Carolingian Empire likewise fell apart, this seems to be\nwhat happened. People continued keeping accounts in the old imperial currency,\neven if they were no longer using\ncoins.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts028) Similarly, the\nPukhtun men who like to swap bicycles for donkeys are hardly unfamiliar with\nthe use of money. Money has existed in that part of the world for thousands of\nyears. They just prefer direct exchange between equals—in this case, because\nthey consider it more\nmanly.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts029)\n\nThe most remarkable thing is that even in Adam Smith’s examples of fish and\nnails and tobacco being used as money, the same sort of thing was happening.\nIn the years following the appearance of _The Wealth of Nations_ , scholars\nchecked into most of those examples and discovered that in just about every\ncase, the people involved were quite familiar with the use of money, and in\nfact, _were_ using money—as a unit of\naccount.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts030) Take the example\nof dried cod, supposedly used as money in Newfoundland. As the British\ndiplomat A. Mitchell-Innes pointed out almost a century ago, what Smith\ndescribes was really an illusion, created by a simple credit arrangement:\n\nIn the early days of the Newfoundland fishing industry, there was no permanent\nEuropean population; the fishers went there for the fishing season only, and\nthose who were not fishers were traders who bought the dried fish and sold to\nthe fishers their daily supplies. The latter sold their catch to the traders\nat the market price in pounds, shillings and pence, and obtained in return a\ncredit on their books, with which they paid for their supplies. Balances due\nby the traders were paid for by drafts on England or\nFrance.[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts031)\n\nIt was quite the same in the Scottish village. It’s not as if anyone actually\nwalked into the local pub, plunked down a roofing nail, and asked for a pint\nof beer. Employers in Smith’s day often lacked coin to pay their workers;\nwages could be delayed by a year or more; in the meantime, it was considered\nacceptable for employees to carry off either some of their own products or\nleftover work materials, lumber, fabric, cord, and so on. The nails were de\nfacto interest on what their employers owed them. So they went to the pub, ran\nup a tab, and when occasion permitted, brought in a bag of nails to charge off\nagainst the debt. The law making tobacco legal tender in Virginia seems to\nhave been an attempt by planters to oblige local merchants to accept their\nproducts as a credit around harvest time. In effect, the law forced all\nmerchants in Virginia to become middlemen in the tobacco business, whether\nthey liked it or not; just as all West Indian merchants were obliged to become\nsugar dealers, since that’s what all their wealthier customers brought in to\nwrite off against their debt.\n\nThe primary examples, then, were ones in which people were improvising credit\nsystems, because actual money—gold and silver coinage—was in short supply. But\nthe most shocking blow to the conventional version of economic history came\nwith the translation, first of Egyptian hieroglyphics, and then of\nMesopotamian cuneiform, which pushed back scholars’ knowledge of written\nhistory almost three millennia, from the time of Homer (circa 800 bc), where\nit had hovered in Smith’s time, to roughly 3500 bc. What these texts revealed\nwas that credit systems of exactly this sort actually _preceded_ the invention\nof coinage by thousands of years.\n\nThe Mesopotamian system is the best-documented, more so than that of Pharaonic\nEgypt (which appears similar), Shang China (about which we know little), or\nthe Indus Valley civilization (about which we know nothing at all). As it\nhappens, we know a great deal about Mesopotamia, since the vast majority of\ncuneiform documents were financial in nature.\n\nThe Sumerian economy was dominated by vast temple and palace complexes. These\nwere often staffed by thousands: priests and officials, craftspeople who\nworked in their industrial workshops, farmers and shepherds who worked their\nconsiderable estates. Even though ancient Sumer was usually divided into a\nlarge number of independent city-states, by the time the curtain goes up on\nMesopotamian civilization around 3500, temple administrators already appear to\nhave developed a single, uniform system of accountancy—one that is in some\nways still with us, actually, because it’s to the Sumerians that we owe such\nthings as the dozen or the 24-hour\nday.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts032) The basic monetary\nunit was the silver shekel. One shekel’s weight in silver was established as\nthe equivalent of one gur, or bushel of barley. A shekel was subdivided into\n60 minas, corresponding to one portion of barley—on the principle that there\nwere 30 days in a month, and Temple workers received two rations of barley\nevery day. It’s easy to see that “money” in this sense is in no way the\nproduct of commercial transactions. It was actually created by bureaucrats in\norder to keep track of resources and move things back and forth between\ndepartments.\n\nTemple bureaucrats used the system to calculate debts (rents, fees, loans …)\nin silver. Silver was, effectively, money. And it did indeed circulate in the\nform of unworked chunks, “rude bars” as Smith had put\nit.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts033) In this he was right.\nBut it was almost the only part of his account that was right. One reason was\nthat silver did not circulate very much. Most of it just sat around in Temple\nand Palace treasuries, some of which remained, carefully guarded, in the same\nplace for literally thousands of years. It would have been easy enough to\nstandardize the ingots, stamp them, create some authoritative system to\nguarantee their purity. The technology existed. Yet no one saw any particular\nneed to do so. One reason was that while debts were calculated in silver, they\ndid not have to be _paid_ in silver—in fact, they could be paid in more or\nless anything one had around. Peasants who owed money to the Temple or Palace,\nor to some Temple or Palace official, seem to have settled their debts mostly\nin barley, which is why fixing the ratio of silver to barley was so important.\nBut it was perfectly acceptable to show up with goats, or furniture, or lapis\nlazuli. Temples and Palaces were huge industrial operations—they could find a\nuse for almost anything.[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts034)\n\nIn the marketplaces that cropped up in Mesopotamian cities, prices were also\ncalculated in silver, and the prices of commodities that weren’t entirely\ncontrolled by the Temples and Palaces would tend to fluctuate according to\nsupply and demand. But even here, such evidence as we have suggests that most\ntransactions were based on credit. Merchants (who sometimes worked for the\nTemples, sometimes operated independently) were among the few people who did,\noften, actually use silver in transactions; but even they mostly did much of\ntheir dealings on credit, and ordinary people buying beer from “ale women,” or\nlocal innkeepers, once again, did so by running up a tab, to be settled at\nharvest time in barley or anything they might have had at\nhand.[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts035)\n\nAt this point, just about every aspect of the conventional story of the\norigins of money lay in rubble. Rarely has an historical theory been so\nabsolutely and systematically refuted. By the early decades of the twentieth\ncentury, all the pieces were in place to completely rewrite the history of\nmoney. The groundwork was laid by Mitchell-Innes—the same one I’ve already\ncited on the matter of the cod—in two essays that appeared in New York’s\n_Banking Law Journal_ in 1913 and 1914. In these, Mitchell-Innes matter-of-\nfactly laid out the false assumptions on which existing economic history was\nbased and suggested that what was really needed was a history of debt:\n\nOne of the popular fallacies in connection with commerce is that in modern\ndays a money-saving device has been introduced called _credit_ and that,\nbefore this device was known, all, purchases were paid for in cash, in other\nwords in coins. A careful investigation shows that the precise reverse is\ntrue. In olden days coins played a far smaller part in commerce than they do\nto-day. Indeed so small was the quantity of coins, that they did not even\nsuffice for the needs of the [Medieval English] Royal household and estates\nwhich regularly used tokens of various kinds for the purpose of making small\npayments. So unimportant indeed was the coinage that sometimes Kings did not\nhesitate to call it all in for re-minting and re-issue and still commerce went\non just the same.[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts036)\n\nIn fact, our standard account of monetary history is precisely backwards. We\ndid not begin with barter, discover money, and then eventually develop credit\nsystems. It happened precisely the other way around. What we now call virtual\nmoney came first. Coins came much later, and their use spread only unevenly,\nnever completely replacing credit systems. Barter, in turn, appears to be\nlargely a kind of accidental byproduct of the use of coinage or paper money:\nhistorically, it has mainly been what people who are used to cash transactions\ndo when for one reason or another they have no access to currency.\n\nThe curious thing is that it never happened. This new history was never\nwritten. It’s not that any economist has ever refuted Mitchell-Innes. They\njust ignored him. Textbooks did not change their story—even if all the\nevidence made clear that the story was simply wrong. People still write\nhistories of money that are actually histories of coinage, on the assumption\nthat in the past, these were necessarily the same thing; periods when coinage\nlargely vanished are still described as times when the economy “reverted to\nbarter,” as if the meaning of this phrase is self-evident, even though no one\nactually knows what it means. As a result we have next-to-no idea how, say,\nthe inhabitant of a Dutch town in 950 ad actually went about acquiring cheese\nor spoons or hiring musicians to play at his daughter’s wedding—let alone how\nany of this was likely to be arranged in Pemba or\nSamarkand.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-nts037)\n\n\n# Chapter Three  \n  \nPRIMORDIAL DEBTS\n\n_In being born every being is born as debt owed to the gods, the saints, the\nFathers and to men. If one makes a sacrifice, it is because of a debt owing to\nthe gods from birth … If one recites a sacred text, it is because of a debt\nowing to the saints … If one wishes for offspring, it is because of a debt due\nto the fathers from birth … And if one gives hospitality, it is because it is\na debt owing to men_.\n\n_—Satapatha Brahmana_ 1.7.12, 1–6  \n  \n\n_Let us drive away the evil effects of bad dreams, just as we pay off debts_.\n\n_—Rig Veda_ 8.47.17\n\nTHE REASON THAT economics textbooks now begin with imaginary villages is\nbecause it has been impossible to talk about real ones. Even some economists\nhave been forced to admit that Smith’s Land of Barter doesn’t really\nexist.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts001)\n\nThe question is why the myth has been perpetuated, anyway. Economists have\nlong since jettisoned other elements of _The Wealth of Nations_ —for instance,\nSmith’s labor theory of value and disapproval of joint-stock corporations. Why\nnot simply write off the myth of barter as a quaint Enlightenment parable, and\ninstead attempt to understand primordial credit arrangements—or anyway,\nsomething more in keeping with the historical evidence?\n\nThe answer seems to be that the Myth of Barter cannot go away, because it is\ncentral to the entire discourse of economics.\n\nRecall here what Smith was trying to do when he wrote _The Wealth of Nations_.\nAbove all, the book was an attempt to establish the newfound discipline of\neconomics as a science. This meant that not only did economics have its own\npeculiar domain of study—what we now call “the economy,” though the idea that\nthere even was something called an “economy” was very new in Smith’s day—but\nthat this economy operated according to laws of much the same sort as Sir\nIsaac Newton had so recently identified as governing the physical world.\nNewton had represented God as a cosmic watchmaker who had created the physical\nmachinery of the universe in such a way that it would operate for the ultimate\nbenefit of humans, and then let it run on its own. Smith was trying to make a\nsimilar, Newtonian argument.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts002)\nGod—or Divine Providence, as he put it—had arranged matters in such a way that\nour pursuit of self-interest would nonetheless, given an unfettered market, be\nguided “as if by an invisible hand” to promote the general welfare. Smith’s\nfamous invisible hand was, as he says in his _Theory of Moral Sentiments_ ,\nthe agent of Divine Providence. It was literally the hand of\nGod.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts003)\n\nOnce economics had been established as a discipline, the theological arguments\nno longer seemed necessary or important. People continue to argue about\nwhether an unfettered free market really will produce the results that Smith\nsaid it would; but no one questions whether “the market” naturally exists. The\nunderlying assumptions that derive from this came to be seen as common\nsense—so much so that, as I’ve noted, we simply assume that when valuable\nobjects do change hands, it will normally be because two individuals have both\ndecided they would gain a material advantage by swapping them. One interesting\ncorollary is that, as a result, economists have come to see the very question\nof the presence or absence of money as not especially important, since money\nis just a commodity, chosen to facilitate exchange, and which we use to\nmeasure the value of other commodities. Otherwise, it has no special\nqualities. Still, in 1958, Paul Samuelson, one of the leading lights of the\nneoclassical school that still predominates in modern economic thought, could\nexpress disdain for what he called “the social contrivance of money.” “Even in\nthe most advanced industrial economies,” he insisted, “if we strip exchange\ndown to its barest essentials and peel off the obscuring layer of money, we\nfind that trade between individuals and nations largely boils down to\nbarter.”[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts004) Others spoke of a\n“veil of money” obscuring the nature of the “real economy” in which people\nproduced real goods and services and swapped them back and\nforth.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts005)\n\nCall this the final apotheosis of economics as common sense. Money is\nunimportant. Economies—“real economies”—are really vast barter systems. The\nproblem is that history shows that without money, such vast barter systems do\nnot occur. Even when economies “revert to barter,” as Europe was said to do in\nthe Middle Ages, they don’t actually abandon the use of money. They just\nabandon the use of cash. In the Middle Ages, for instance, everyone continued\nto assess the value of tools and livestock in the old Roman currency, even if\nthe coins themselves had ceased to\ncirculate.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts006)\n\nIt’s money that had made it possible for us to imagine ourselves in the way\neconomists encourage us to do: as a collection of individuals and nations\nwhose main business is swapping things. It’s also clear that the mere\nexistence of money, in itself, is not enough to allow us see the world this\nway. If it were, the discipline of economics would have been created in\nancient Sumer, or anyway, far earlier than 1776, when Adam Smith’s _The Wealth\nof Nations_ appeared.\n\nThe missing element is in fact exactly the thing Smith was attempting to\ndownplay: the role of government policy. In England, in Smith’s day, it became\npossible to see the market, the world of butchers, ironmongers, and\nhaberdashers, as its own entirely independent sphere of human activity because\nthe British government was actively engaged in fostering it. This required\nlaws and police, but also, specific monetary policies, which liberals like\nSmith were (successfully)\nadvocating.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts007) It required\npegging the value of the currency to silver, but at the same time greatly\nincreasing the money supply, and particularly the amount of small change in\ncirculation. This not only required huge amounts of tin and copper, but also\nthe careful regulation of the banks that were, at that time, the only source\nof paper money. The century before _The Wealth of Nations_ had seen at least\ntwo attempts to create state-supported central banks, in France and Sweden,\nthat had proven to be spectacular failures. In each case, the would-be central\nbank issued notes based largely on speculation that collapsed the moment\ninvestors lost faith. Smith supported the use of paper money, but like Locke\nbefore him, he also believed that the relative success of the Bank of England\nand Bank of Scotland had been due to their policy of pegging paper money\nfirmly to precious metals. This became the mainstream economic view, so much\nso that alternative theories of money as credit—the one that Mitchell-Innes\nadvocated—were quickly relegated to the margins, their proponents written off\nas cranks, and the very sort of thinking that led to bad banks and speculative\nbubbles in the first place.\n\nIt might be helpful, then, to consider what these alternative theories\nactually were.\n\n## State and Credit Theories of Money\n\nMitchell-Innes was an exponent of what came to be known as the Credit Theory\nof money, a position that over the course of the nineteenth century had its\nmost avid proponents not in Mitchell-Innes’s native Britain but in the two up-\nand-coming rival powers of the day, the United States and Germany. Credit\nTheorists insisted that money is not a commodity but an accounting tool. In\nother words, it is not a “thing” at all. You can no more touch a dollar or a\ndeutschmark than you can touch an hour or a cubic centimeter. Units of\ncurrency are merely abstract units of measurement, and as the credit theorists\ncorrectly noted, historically, such abstract systems of accounting emerged\nlong before the use of any particular token of\nexchange.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts008)\n\nThe obvious next question is: If money is a just a yardstick, what then does\nit measure? The answer was simple: debt. A coin is, effectively, an IOU.\nWhereas conventional wisdom holds that a banknote is, or should be, a promise\nto pay a certain amount of “real money” (gold, silver, whatever that might be\ntaken to mean), Credit Theorists argued that a banknote is simply the promise\nto pay _something_ of the same value as an ounce of gold. But that’s all that\nmoney ever is. There’s no fundamental difference in this respect between a\nsilver dollar, a Susan B. Anthony dollar coin made of a copper-nickel alloy\ndesigned to look vaguely like gold, a green piece of paper with a picture of\nGeorge Washington on it, or a digital blip on some bank’s computer.\nConceptually, the idea that a piece of gold is really just an IOU is always\nrather difficult to wrap one’s head around, but something like this must be\ntrue, because even when gold and silver coins were in use, they almost never\ncirculated at their bullion value.\n\nHow could credit money come about? Let us return to the economics professors’\nimaginary town. Say, for example, that Joshua were to give his shoes to Henry,\nand, rather than Henry owing him a favor, Henry promises him something of\nequivalent value.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts009) Henry\ngives Joshua an IOU. Joshua could wait for Henry to have something useful, and\nthen redeem it. In that case Henry would rip up the IOU and the story would be\nover. But say Joshua were to pass the IOU on to a third party—Sheila—to whom\nhe owes something else. He could tick it off against his debt to a fourth\nparty, Lola—now Henry will owe that amount to her. Hence is money born.\nBecause there’s no logical end to it. Say Sheila now wishes to acquire a pair\nof shoes from Edith; she can just hand Edith the IOU, and assure her that\nHenry is good for it. In principle, there’s no reason that the IOU could not\ncontinue circulating around town for years—provided people continue to have\nfaith in Henry. In fact, if it goes on long enough, people might forget about\nthe issuer entirely. Things like this do happen. The anthropologist Keith Hart\nonce told me a story about his brother, who in the ‘50s was a British soldier\nstationed in Hong Kong. Soldiers used to pay their bar tabs by writing checks\non accounts back in England. Local merchants would often simply endorse them\nover to each other and pass them around as currency: once, he saw one of his\nown checks, written six months before, on the counter of a local vendor\ncovered with about forty different tiny inscriptions in Chinese.\n\nWhat credit theorists like Mitchell-Innes were arguing is that even if Henry\ngave Joshua a gold coin instead of a piece of paper, the situation would be\nessentially the same. A gold coin is a promise to pay something else of\nequivalent value to a gold coin. After all, a gold coin is not actually useful\nin itself. One only accepts it because one assumes other people will.\n\nIn this sense, the value of a unit of currency is not the measure of the value\nof an object, but the measure of one’s trust in other human beings.\n\nThis element of trust of course makes everything more complicated. Early\nbanknotes circulated via a process almost exactly like what I’ve just\ndescribed, except that, like the Chinese merchants, each recipient added his\nor her signature to guarantee the debt’s legitimacy. But generally, the\ndifficulty in the Chartalist position—this is what it came to be called, from\nthe Latin _charta_ , or token—is to establish why people would continue to\ntrust a piece of paper. After all, why couldn’t anyone just sign Henry’s name\non an IOU? True, this sort of debt-token system might work within a small\nvillage where everyone knew one another, or even among a more dispersed\ncommunity like sixteenth-century Italian or twentieth-century Chinese\nmerchants, where everyone at least had ways of keeping track of everybody\nelse. But systems like these cannot create a full-blown currency system, and\nthere’s no evidence that they ever have. Providing a sufficient number of IOUs\nto allow everyone even in a medium-sized city to be able to carry out a\nsignificant portion of their daily transactions in such currency would require\nmillions of tokens.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts010) To be\nable to guarantee all of them, Henry would have to be almost unimaginably\nrich.\n\nAll this would be much less of a problem, however, if Henry were, say, Henry\nII, King of England, Duke of Normandy, Lord of Ireland, and Count of Anjou.\n\nThe real impetus for the Chartalist position, in fact, came out of what came\nto be known as the “German Historical School,” whose most famous exponent was\nthe historian G.F. Knapp, whose _State Theory of Money_ first appeared in\n1905.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts011) If money is simply a\nunit of measure, it makes sense that emperors and kings should concern\nthemselves with such matters. Emperors and kings are almost always concerned\nto established uniform systems of weights and measures throughout their\nkingdoms. It is also true, as Knapp observed, that once established, such\nsystems tend to remain remarkably stable over time. During the reign of the\nactual Henry II (1154–1189), just about everyone in Western Europe was still\nkeeping their accounts using the monetary system established by Charlemagne\nsome 350 years earlier—that is, using pounds, shillings, and pence—despite the\nfact that some of these coins had never existed (Charlemagne never actually\nstruck a silver pound), none of Charlemagne’s actual shillings and pence\nremained in circulation, and those coins that did circulate tended to vary\nenormously in size, weight, purity, and\nvalue.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts012) According to the\nChartalists, this doesn’t really matter. What matters is that there is a\nuniform system for measuring credits and debts, and that this system remains\nstable over time. The case of Charlemagne’s currency is particularly dramatic\nbecause his actual empire dissolved quite quickly, but the monetary system he\ncreated continued to be used, for keeping accounts, within his former\nterritories for more than 800 years. It was referred to, in the sixteenth\ncentury, quite explicitly as “imaginary money,” and derniers and livres were\nonly completely abandoned, as units of account, around the time of the French\nRevolution.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts013)\n\nAccording to Knapp, whether or not the actual, physical money stuff in\ncirculation corresponds to this “imaginary money” is not particularly\nimportant. It makes no real difference whether it’s pure silver, debased\nsilver, leather tokens, or dried cod—provided the state is willing to accept\nit in payment of taxes. Because whatever the state was willing to accept, for\nthat reason, became currency. One of the most important forms of currency in\nEngland in Henry’s time were notched “tally sticks” used to record debts.\nTally sticks were quite explicitly IOUs: both parties to a transaction would\ntake a hazelwood twig, notch it to indicate the amount owed, and then split it\nin half. The creditor would keep one half, called “the stock” (hence the\norigin of the term “stock holder”) and the debtor kept the other, called “the\nstub” (hence the origin of the term “ticket stub.”) Tax assessors used such\ntwigs to calculate amounts owed by local sheriffs. Often, though, rather than\nwait for the taxes to come due, Henry’s exchequer would often sell the tallies\nat a discount, and they would circulate, as tokens of debt owed to the\ngovernment, to anyone willing to trade for\nthem.[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts014)\n\nModern banknotes actually work on a similar principle, except in\nreverse.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts015) Recall here the\nlittle parable about Henry’s IOU. The reader might have noticed one puzzling\naspect of the equation: the IOU can operate as money only as long as Henry\nnever pays his debt. In fact this is precisely the logic on which the Bank of\nEngland—the first successful modern central bank—was originally founded. In\n1694, a consortium of English bankers made a loan of £1,200,000 to the king.\nIn return they received a royal monopoly on the issuance of banknotes. What\nthis meant in practice was they had the right to advance IOUs for a portion of\nthe money the king now owed them to any inhabitant of the kingdom willing to\nborrow from them, or willing to deposit their own money in the bank—in effect,\nto circulate or “monetize” the newly created royal debt. This was a great deal\nfor the bankers (they got to charge the king 8 percent annual interest for the\noriginal loan and simultaneously charge interest on the same money to the\nclients who borrowed it), but it only worked as long as the original loan\nremained outstanding. To this day, this loan has never been paid back. It\ncannot be. If it ever were, the entire monetary system of Great Britain would\ncease to exist.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts016)\n\nIf nothing else, this approach helps solve one of the obvious mysteries of the\nfiscal policy of so many early kingdoms: Why did they make subjects pay taxes\nat all? This is not a question we’re used to asking. The answer seems self-\nevident. Governments demand taxes because they wish to get their hands on\npeople’s money. But if Smith was right, and gold and silver became money\nthrough the natural workings of the market completely independently of\ngovernments, then wouldn’t the obvious thing be to just grab control of the\ngold and silver mines? Then the king would have all the money he could\npossibly need. In fact, this is what ancient kings would normally do. If there\nwere gold and silver mines in their territory, they would usually take control\nof them. So what exactly was the point of extracting the gold, stamping one’s\npicture on it, causing it to circulate among one’s subjects—and then demanding\nthat those same subjects give it back again?\n\nThis does seem a bit of a puzzle. But if money and markets do not emerge\nspontaneously, it actually makes perfect sense. Because this is the simplest\nand most efficient way to bring markets into being. Let us take a hypothetical\nexample. Say a king wishes to support a standing army of fifty thousand men.\nUnder ancient or medieval conditions, feeding such a force was an enormous\nproblem—unless they were on the march, one would need to employ almost as many\nmen and animals just to locate, acquire, and transport the necessary\nprovisions.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts017) On the other\nhand, if one simply hands out coins to the soldiers and then demands that\nevery family in the kingdom was obliged to pay one of those coins back to you,\none would, in one blow, turn one’s entire national economy into a vast machine\nfor the provisioning of soldiers, since now every family, in order to get\ntheir hands on the coins, must find some way to contribute to the general\neffort to provide soldiers with things they want. Markets are brought into\nexistence as a side effect.\n\nThis is a bit of a cartoon version, but it is very clear that markets did\nspring up around ancient armies; one need only take a glance at Kautilya’s\n_Arthasasatra_ , the Sassanian “circle of sovereignty,” or the Chinese\n“Discourses on Salt and Iron” to discover that most ancient rulers spent a\ngreat deal of their time thinking about the relation between mines, soldiers,\ntaxes, and food. Most concluded that the creation of markets of this sort was\nnot just convenient for feeding soldiers, but useful in all sorts of ways,\nsince it meant officials no longer had to requisition everything they needed\ndirectly from the populace, or figure out a way to produce it on royal estates\nor royal workshops. In other words, despite the dogged liberal\nassumption—again, coming from Smith’s legacy—that the existence of states and\nmarkets are somehow opposed, the historical record implies that exactly the\nopposite is the case. Stateless societies tend also to be without markets.\n\nAs one might imagine, state theories of money have always been anathema to\nmainstream economists working in the tradition of Adam Smith. In fact,\nChartalism has tended to be seen as a populist underside of economic theory,\nfavored mainly by cranks.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts018)\nThe curious thing is that the mainstream economists often ended up actually\nworking for governments and advising such governments to pursue policies much\nlike those the Chartalists described—that is, tax policies designed to create\nmarkets where they had not existed before—despite the fact that they were in\ntheory committed to Smith’s argument that markets develop spontaneously of\ntheir own accord.\n\nThis was particularly true in the colonial world. To return to Madagascar for\na moment: I have already mentioned that one of the first things that the\nFrench general Gallieni, conqueror of Madagascar, did when the conquest of the\nisland was complete in 1901 was to impose a head tax. Not only was this tax\nquite high, it was also only payable in newly issued Malagasy francs. In other\nwords, Gallieni did indeed print money and then demand that everyone in the\ncountry give some of that money back to him.\n\nMost striking of all, though, was language he used to describe this tax. It\nwas referred to as the _“impôt moralisateur,”_ the “educational” or\n“moralizing tax.” In other words, it was designed—to adopt the language of the\nday—to teach the natives the value of work. Since the “educational tax” came\ndue shortly after harvest time, the easiest way for farmers to pay it was to\nsell a portion of their rice crop to the Chinese or Indian merchants who soon\ninstalled themselves in small towns across the country. However, harvest was\nwhen the market price of rice was, for obvious reasons, at its lowest; if one\nsold too much of one’s crop, that meant one would not have enough left to feed\none’s family for the entire year, and thus be forced to buy one’s own rice\nback, on credit, from those same merchants later in the year when prices were\nmuch higher. As a result, farmers quickly fell hopelessly into debt (the\nmerchants doubling as loan sharks). The easiest ways to pay back the debt was\neither to find some kind of cash crop to sell—to start growing coffee, or\npineapples—or else to send one’s children off to work for wages in the city,\nor on one of the plantations that French colonists were establishing across\nthe island. The whole project might seem no more than a cynical scheme to\nsqueeze cheap labor out of the peasantry, and it was that, but it was also\nsomething more. The colonial government was were also quite explicit (at least\nin their own internal policy documents), about the need to make sure that\npeasants had at least some money of their own left over, and to ensure that\nthey became accustomed to the minor luxuries—parasols, lipstick,\ncookies—available at the Chinese shops. It was crucial that they develop new\ntastes, habits, and expectations; that they lay the foundations of a consumer\ndemand that would endure long after the conquerors had left, and keep\nMadagascar forever tied to France.\n\nMost people are not stupid, and most Malagasy understood exactly what their\nconquerors were trying to do to them. Some were determined to resist. More\nthan sixty years after the invasion, a French anthropologist, Gerard Althabe,\nwas able to observe villages on the east coast of the island whose inhabitants\nwould dutifully show up at the coffee plantations to earn the money for their\npoll tax, and then, having paid it, studiously ignore the wares for sale at\nthe local shops and instead turn over any remaining money to lineage elders,\nwho would then use it to buy cattle for sacrifice to their\nancestors.[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts019) Many were quite\nopen in saying that they saw themselves as resisting a trap.\n\nStill, such defiance rarely lasts forever. Markets did gradually take shape,\neven in those parts of the island where none had previously existed. With them\ncame the inevitable network of little shops. And by the time I got there, in\n1990, a generation after the poll tax had finally been abolished by a\nrevolutionary government, the logic of the market had become so intuitively\naccepted that even spirit mediums were reciting passages that might as well\nhave come from Adam Smith.\n\nSuch examples could be multiplied endlessly. Something like this occurred in\njust about every part of the world conquered by European arms where markets\nwere not already in place. Rather than discovering barter, they ended up using\nthe very techniques that mainstream economics rejected to bring something like\nthe market into being.\n\n## In Search of a Myth\n\nAnthropologists have been complaining about the Myth of Barter for almost a\ncentury. Occasionally, economists point out with slight exasperation that\nthere’s a fairly simple reason why they’re still telling the same story\ndespite all the evidence against it: anthropologists have never come up with a\nbetter one.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts020) This is an\nunderstandable objection, but there’s a simple answer to it. The reasons why\nanthropologists haven’t been able to come up with a simple, compelling story\nfor the origins of money is because there’s no reason to believe there could\nbe one. Money was no more ever “invented” than music or mathematics or\njewelry. What we call “money” isn’t a “thing” at all, it’s a way of comparing\nthings mathematically, as proportions: of saying one of X is equivalent to six\nof Y. As such it is probably as old as human thought. The moment we try to get\nany more specific, we discover that there are any number of different habits\nand practices that have converged in the stuff we now call “money,” and this\nis precisely the reason why economists, historians, and the rest have found it\nso difficult to come up with a single definition.\n\nCredit Theorists have long been hobbled by the lack of an equally compelling\nnarrative. This is not to say that all sides in the currency debates that\nranged between 1850 and 1950 were not in the habit of deploying mythological\nweaponry. This was true particularly, perhaps, in the United States. In 1894,\nthe Greenbackers, who pushed for detaching the dollar from gold entirely to\nallow the government to spend freely on job-creation campaigns, invented the\nidea of the March on Washington—an idea that was to have endless resonance in\nU.S. history. L. Frank Baum’s book _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ , which\nappeared in 1900, is widely recognized to be a parable for the Populist\ncampaign of William Jennings Bryan, who twice ran for president on the Free\nSilver platform—vowing to replace the gold standard with a bimetallic system\nthat would allow the free creation of silver money alongside\ngold.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts021) As with the\nGreenbackers, one of the main constituencies for the movement was debtors:\nparticularly, Midwestern farm families such as Dorothy’s, who had been facing\na massive wave of foreclosures during the severe recession of the 1890s.\nAccording to the Populist reading, the Wicked Witches of the East and West\nrepresent the East and West Coast bankers (promoters of and benefactors from\nthe tight money supply), the Scarecrow represented the farmers (who didn’t\nhave the brains to avoid the debt trap), the Tin Woodsman was the industrial\nproletariat (who didn’t have the heart to act in solidarity with the farmers),\nthe Cowardly Lion represented the political class (who didn’t have the courage\nto intervene). The yellow brick road, silver slippers, emerald city, and\nhapless Wizard presumably speak for\nthemselves.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts022) “Oz” is of\ncourse the standard abbreviation for\n“ounce.”[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts023) As an attempt to\ncreate a new myth, Baum’s story was remarkably effective. As political\npropaganda, less so. William Jennings Bryan failed in three attempts to win\nthe presidency, the silver standard was never adopted, and few nowadays even\nremember what _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ was originally supposed to be\nabout.[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts024)\n\nFor state-money theorists in particular, this has been a problem. Stories\nabout rulers using taxes to create markets in conquered territories, or to pay\nfor soldiers or other state functions, are not particularly inspiring. German\nideas of money as the embodiment of national will did not travel very well.\n\nEvery time there was a major economic meltdown, however, conventional laissez-\nfaire economics took another hit. The Bryan campaigns were born as a reaction\nto the Panic of 1893. By the time of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the\nvery notion that the market could regulate itself, so long as the government\nensured that money was safely pegged to precious metals, was completely\ndiscredited. From roughly 1933 to 1979, every major capitalist government\nreversed course and adopted some version of Keynesianism. Keynesian orthodoxy\nstarted from the assumption that capitalist markets would not really work\nunless capitalist governments were willing effectively to play nanny: most\nfamously, by engaging in massive deficit “pump-priming” during downturns.\nWhile in the ’80s, Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the\nUnited States made a great show of rejecting all of this, it’s unclear how\nmuch they really did.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts025) And\nin any case, they were operating in the wake of an even greater blow to\nprevious monetary orthodoxy: Richard Nixon’s decision in 1971 to unpeg the\ndollar from precious metals entirely, eliminate the international gold\nstandard, and introduce the system of floating currency regimes that has\ndominated the world economy ever since. This meant in effect that all national\ncurrencies were henceforth, as neoclassical economists like to put it, “fiat\nmoney” backed only by the public trust.\n\nNow, John Maynard Keynes himself was much more open to what he liked to call\nthe “alternative tradition” of credit and state theories than any economist of\nthat stature (and Keynes is still arguably the single most important economic\nthinker of the twentieth century) before or since. At certain points he\nimmersed himself in it: he spent several years in the 1920s studying\nMesopotamian cuneiform banking records to try to ascertain the origins of\nmoney—his “Babylonian madness,” as he would later call\nit.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts026) His conclusion, which\nhe set forth at the very beginning of his _Treatise on Money_ , his most\nfamous work, was more or less the only conclusion one could come to if one\nstarted not from first principles, but from a careful examination of the\nhistorical record: that the lunatic fringe was, essentially, right. Whatever\nits earliest origins, for the last four thousand years, money has been\neffectively a creature of the state. Individuals, he observed, make contracts\nwith one another. They take out debts, and they promise payment.\n\nThe State, therefore, comes in first of all as the authority of law which\nenforces the payment of the thing which corresponds to the name or description\nin the contract. But it comes doubly when, in addition, it claims the right to\ndetermine and declare _what thing_ corresponds to the name, and to vary its\ndeclaration from time to time—when, that is to say it claims the right to re-\nedit the dictionary. This right is claimed by all modern States and has been\nso claimed for some four thousand years at least. It is when this stage in the\nevolution of Money has been reached that Knapp’s Chartalism—the doctrine that\nmoney is peculiarly a creation of the State—is fully realized … To-day all\ncivilized money is, beyond the possibility of dispute,\nchartalist.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts027)\n\nThis does not mean that the state necessarily _creates_ money. Money is\ncredit, it can be brought into being by private contractual agreements (loans,\nfor instance). The state merely enforces the agreement and dictates the legal\nterms. Hence Keynes’ next dramatic assertion: that banks create money, and\nthat there is no intrinsic limit to their ability to do so: since however much\nthey lend, the borrower will have no choice but to put the money back into\nsome bank again, and thus, from the perspective of the banking system as a\nwhole, the total number of debits and credits will always cancel\nout.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts028) The implications were\nradical, but Keynes himself was not. In the end, he was always careful to\nframe the problem in a way that could be reintegrated into the mainstream\neconomics of his day.\n\nNeither was Keynes much of a mythmaker. Insofar as the alternative tradition\nhas come up with an answer to the Myth of Barter, it was not from Keynes’ own\nefforts (Keynes ultimately decided that the origins of money were not\nparticularly important) but in the work of some contemporary neo-Keynesians,\nwho were not afraid to follow some of his more radical suggestions as far as\nthey would go.\n\nThe real weak link in state-credit theories of money was always the element of\ntaxes. It is one thing to explain why early states demanded taxes (in order to\ncreate markets.) It’s another to ask “by what right?” Assuming that early\nrulers were not simply thugs, and that taxes were not simply extortion—and no\nCredit Theorist, to my knowledge, took such a cynical view even of early\ngovernment—one must ask how they justified this sort of thing.\n\nNowadays, we all think we know the answer to this question. We pay our taxes\nso that the government can provide us with services. This starts with security\nservices—military protection being, often, about the only service some early\nstates were really able to provide. By now, of course, the government provides\nall sorts of things. All of this is said to go back to some sort of original\n“social contract” that everyone somehow agreed on, though no one really knows\nexactly when or by whom, or why we should be bound by the decisions of distant\nancestors on this one matter when we don’t feel particularly bound by the\ndecisions of our distant ancestors on anything\nelse.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts029) All of this makes\nsense if you assume that markets come before governments, but the whole\nargument totters quickly once you realize that they don’t.\n\nThere is an alternative explanation, one created to be in keeping with the\nstate-credit theory approach. It’s referred to as “primordial debt theory” and\nit has been developed largely in France, by a team of researchers—not only\neconomists but anthropologists, historians, and classicists—originally\nassembled around the figures of Michel Aglietta and Andre\nOrléans,[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts030) and more recently,\nBruno Théret, and it has since been taken up by neo-Keynesians in the United\nStates and the United Kingdom as\nwell.[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts031)\n\nIt’s a position that has emerged quite recently, and at first, largely amidst\ndebates about the nature of the euro. The creation of a common European\ncurrency sparked not only all sorts of intellectual debates (does a common\ncurrency necessarily imply the creation of a common European state? Or of a\ncommon European economy or society? Are these ultimately the same thing?) but\ndramatic political ones as well. The creation of the euro zone was spearheaded\nabove all by Germany, whose central banks still see their main goal as\ncombating inflation. What’s more, tight money policies and the need to balance\nbudgets having been used as the main weapon to chip away welfare-state\npolicies in Europe, it has necessarily become the stake of political struggles\nbetween bankers and pensioners, creditors and debtors, just as heated as those\nof 1890s America.\n\nThe core argument is that any attempt to separate monetary policy from social\npolicy is ultimately wrong. Primordial-debt theorists insist that these have\nalways been the same thing. Governments use taxes to create money, and they\nare able to do so because they have become the guardians of the debt that all\ncitizens have to one another. This debt is the essence of society itself. It\nexists long before money and markets, and money and markets themselves are\nsimply ways of chopping pieces of it up.\n\nAt first, the argument goes, this sense of debt was expressed not through the\nstate, but through religion. To make the argument, Aglietta and Orléans fixed\non certain works of early Sanskrit religious literature: the hymns, prayers,\nand poetry collected in the Vedas and the Brahmanas, priestly commentaries\ncomposed over the centuries that followed, texts that are now considered the\nfoundations of Hindu thought. It’s not as odd a choice as it might seem. These\ntexts constitute the earliest known historical reflections on the nature of\ndebt.\n\nActually, even the very earliest Vedic poems, composed sometime between 1500\nand 1200 bc, evince a constant concern with debt—which is treated as\nsynonymous with guilt and\nsin.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts032) There are numerous\nprayers pleading with the gods to liberate the worshipper from the shackles or\nbonds of debt. Sometimes these seem to refer to debt in the literal sense—Rig\nVeda 10.34, for instance, has a long description of the sad plight of gamblers\nwho “wander homeless, in constant fear, in debt, and seeking money.” Elsewhere\nit’s clearly metaphorical.\n\nIn these hymns, Yama, the god of death, figures prominently. To be in debt was\nto have a weight placed on you by Death. To be under any sort of unfulfilled\nobligation, any unkept promise, to gods or to men, was to live in the shadow\nof Death. Often, even in the very early texts, debt seems to stand in for a\nbroader sense of inner suffering, from which one begs the gods—particularly\nAgni, who represents the sacrificial fire—for release. It was only with the\nBrahmanas that commentators started trying to weave all this together into a\nmore comprehensive philosophy. The conclusion: that human existence is itself\na form of debt.\n\nA man, being born, is a debt; by his own self he is born to Death, and only\nwhen he sacrifices does he redeem himself from\nDeath.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts033)\n\nSacrifice (and these early commentators were themselves sacrificial priests)\nis thus called “tribute paid to Death.” Or such was the manner of speaking. In\nreality, as the priests knew better than anyone, sacrifice was directed to all\nthe gods, not just Death—Death was just the intermediary. Framing things this\nway, though, did immediately raise the one problem that always comes up,\nwhenever anyone conceives human life through such an idiom. If our lives are\non loan, who would actually wish to repay such a debt? To live in debt is to\nbe guilty, incomplete. But completion can only mean annihilation. In this way,\nthe “tribute” of sacrifice could be seen as a kind of interest payment, with\nthe life of the animal substituting temporarily for what’s really owed, which\nis ourselves—a mere postponement of the\ninevitable.[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts034)\n\nDifferent commentators proposed different ways out of the dilemma. Some\nambitious Brahmins began telling their clients that sacrificial ritual, if\ndone correctly, promised a way to break out of the human condition entirely\nand achieve eternity (since, in the face of eternity, all debts become\nmeaningless.)[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts035) Another way\nwas to broaden the notion of debt, so that all social responsibilities become\ndebts of one sort or another. Thus two famous passages in the Brahmanas insist\nthat we are born as a debt not just to the gods, to be repaid in sacrifice,\nbut also to the Sages who created the Vedic learning to begin with, which we\nmust repay through study; to our ancestors (“the Fathers”), who we must repay\nby having children; and finally, “to men”—apparently meaning humanity as a\nwhole, to be repaid by offering hospitality to\nstrangers.[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts036) Anyone, then,\nwho lives a proper life is constantly paying back existential debts of one\nsort or another; but at the same time, as the notion of debt slides back into\na simple sense of social obligation, it becomes something far less terrifying\nthan the sense that one’s very existence is a loan taken against\nDeath.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts037) Not least because\nsocial obligations always cut both ways. Especially since, once one has\noneself fathered children, one is just as much a debtor as a creditor.\n\nWhat primordial-debt theorists have done is to propose that the ideas encoded\nin these Vedic texts are not peculiar to a certain intellectual tradition of\nearly Iron Age ritual specialists in the Ganges valley, but that they are\nessential to the very nature and history of human thought. Consider for\nexample this statement, from an essay by French economist Bruno Théret with\nthe uninspiring title “The Socio-Cultural Dimensions of the Currency:\nImplications for the Transition to the Euro,” published in the _Journal of\nConsumer Policy_ in 1999**:**\n\nAt the origin of money we have a “relation of representation” of death as an\ninvisible world, before and beyond life—a representation that is the product\nof the symbolic function proper to the human species and which envisages birth\nas an original debt incurred by all men, a debt owing to the cosmic powers\nfrom which humanity emerged.\n\nPayment of this debt, which can however never be settled on earth—because its\nfull reimbursement is out of reach—takes the form of sacrifices which, by\nreplenishing the credit of the living, make it possible to prolong life and\neven in certain cases to achieve eternity by joining the Gods. But this\ninitial belief-claim is also associated with the emergence of sovereign powers\nwhose legitimacy resides in their ability to represent the entire original\ncosmos. And it is these powers that invented money as a means of settling\ndebts—a means whose abstraction makes it possible to resolve the sacrificial\nparadox by which putting to death becomes the permanent means of protecting\nlife. Through this institution, belief is in turn transferred to a currency\nstamped with the effigy of the sovereign—a money put in circulation but whose\nreturn is organized by this other institution which is the tax/settlement of\nthe life debt. So money also takes on the function of a means of\npayment.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts038)\n\nIf nothing else, this provides a neat illustration of how different are\nstandards of debate in Europe from those current in the Anglo-American world.\nOne can’t imagine an American economist of any stripe writing something like\nthis. Still, the author is actually making a rather clever synthesis here.\nHuman nature does not drive us to “truck and barter.” Rather, it ensures that\nwe are always creating symbols—such as money itself. This is how we come to\nsee ourselves in a cosmos surrounded by invisible forces; as in debt to the\nuniverse.\n\nThe ingenious move of course is to fold this back into the state theory of\nmoney—since by “sovereign powers” Théret actually means “the state.” The first\nkings were sacred kings who were either gods in their own right or stood as\nprivileged mediators between human beings and the ultimate forces that\ngoverned the cosmos. This sets us on a road to the gradual realization that\nour debt to the gods was always, really, a debt to the society that made us\nwhat we are.\n\nThe “primordial debt,” writes British sociologist Geoffrey Ingham, “is that\nowed by the living to the continuity and durability of the society that\nsecures their individual\nexistence.”[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts039) In this sense\nit is not just criminals who owe a “debt to society”—we are all, in a certain\nsense, guilty, even criminals.\n\nFor instance, Ingham notes that, while there is no actual proof that money\nemerged in this way, “there is considerable indirect etymological evidence”:\n\nIn all Indo-European languages, words for “debt” are synonymous with those for\n“sin” or “guilt”, illustrating the links between religion, payment and the\nmediation of the sacred and profane realms by “money.” For example, there is a\nconnection between money (German _Geld_), indemnity or sacrifice (Old English\n_Geild_), tax (Gothic _Gild_) and, of course,\nguilt.[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts040)\n\nOr, to take another curious connection: Why were cattle so often used as\nmoney? The German historian Bernard Laum long ago pointed out that in Homer,\nwhen people measure the value of a ship or suit of armor, they always measure\nit in oxen—even though when they actually exchange things, they never pay for\nanything in oxen. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this was because an\nox was what one offered the gods in sacrifice. Hence they represented absolute\nvalue. From Sumer to Classical Greece, silver and gold were dedicated as\nofferings in temples. Everywhere, money seems to have emerged from the thing\nmost appropriate for giving to the\ngods.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts041)\n\nIf the king has simply taken over guardianship of that primordial debt we all\nowe to society for having created us, this provides a very neat explanation\nfor why the government feels it has the right to make us pay taxes. Taxes are\njust a measure of our debt to the society that made us. But this doesn’t\nreally explain how this kind of absolute life-debt can be converted into\n_money_ , which is by definition a means of measuring and comparing the value\nof _different_ things. This is just as much a problem for credit theorists as\nfor neoclassical economists, even if the problem for them is somewhat\ndifferently framed. If you start from the barter theory of money, you have to\nresolve the problem of how and why you would come to select one commodity to\nmeasure just how much you want each of the other ones. If you start from a\ncredit theory, you are left with the problem I described in the first chapter:\nhow to turn a moral obligation into a specific sum of money, how the mere\nsense of owing someone else a favor can eventually turn into a system of\naccounting in which one is able to calculate exactly how many sheep or fish or\nchunks of silver it would take to repay the debt. Or in this case, how do we\ngo from that absolute debt we owe to God to the very specific debts we owe our\ncousins, or the bartender?\n\nThe answer provided by primordial-debt theorists is, again, ingenious. If\ntaxes represent our absolute debt to the society that created us, then the\nfirst step toward creating real money comes when we start calculating much\nmore specific debts to society, systems of fines, fees, and penalties, or even\ndebts we owe to specific individuals who we have wronged in some way, and thus\nto whom we stand in a relation of “sin” or “guilt.”\n\nThis is actually much less implausible than it might sound. One of the\npuzzling things about all the theories about the origins of money that we’ve\nbeen looking at so far is that they almost completely ignore the evidence of\nanthropology. Anthropologists do have a great deal of knowledge of how\neconomies within stateless societies actually worked—how they still work in\nplaces where states and markets have been unable to completely break up\nexisting ways of doing things. There are innumerable studies of, say, the use\nof cattle as money in eastern or southern Africa, of shell money in the\nAmericas (wampum being the most famous example) or Papua New Guinea, bead\nmoney, feather money, the use of iron rings, cowries, spondylus shells, brass\nrods, or woodpecker scalps.[42](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts042)\nThe reason that this literature tends to be ignored by economists is simple:\n“primitive currencies” of this sort is only rarely used to buy and sell\nthings, and even when they are, never primarily to buy and sell everyday items\nsuch as chickens or eggs or shoes or potatoes. Rather than being employed to\nacquire things, they are mainly used to rearrange relations between people.\nAbove all, to arrange marriages and to settle disputes, particularly those\narising from murders or personal injury.\n\nThere is every reason to believe that our own money started the same way—even\nthe English word “to pay” is originally derived from a word for “to pacify,\nappease”—as in, to give someone something precious, for instance, to express\njust how badly you feel about having just killed his brother in a drunken\nbrawl, and how much you would really like to avoid this becoming the basis for\nan ongoing blood-feud.[43](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts043)\n\nDebt theorists are especially concerned with this latter possibility. This is\npartly because they tend to skip past the anthropological literature and look\nat early law codes—taking inspiration here, from the groundbreaking work of\none of the twentieth century’s greatest numismatists, Philip Grierson, who in\nthe ’70s, first suggested that money might first have emerged from early legal\npractice. Grierson was an expert in the European Dark Ages, and he became\nfascinated by what have come to be known as the “Barbarian Law Codes,”\nestablished by many Germanic peoples after the destruction of the Roman Empire\nin the 600s and 700s—Goths, Frisians, Franks, and so on—soon followed by\nsimilar codes published everywhere from Russia to Ireland. Certainly they are\nfascinating documents. On the one hand, they make it abundantly clear just how\nwrong are conventional accounts of Europe around this time “reverting to\nbarter.” Almost all of the Germanic law codes use Roman money to make\nassessments; penalties for theft, for instance, are almost always followed by\ndemands that the thief not only return the stolen property but pay any\noutstanding rent (or in the event of stolen money, interest) owing for the\namount of time it has been in his possession. On the other hand, these were\nsoon followed by law codes by people living in territories that had never been\nunder Roman rule—in Ireland, Wales, Nordic countries, Russia—and these are if\nanything even more revealing. They could be remarkably creative, both in what\ncould be used as a means of payment and on the precise breakdown of injuries\nand insults that required compensation:\n\nCompensation in the Welsh laws is reckoned primarily in cattle and in the\nIrish ones in cattle or bondmaids _(cumal)_ , with considerable use of\nprecious metals in both. In the Germanic codes it is mainly in precious metal\n… In the Russian codes it was silver and furs, graduated from marten down to\nsquirrel. Their detail is remarkable, not only in the personal injuries\nenvisioned—specific compensations for the loss of an arm, a hand, a\nforefinger, a nail, for a blow on the head so that the brain is visible or\nbone projects—but in the coverage some of them gave to the possessions of the\nindividual household. Title II of the Salic Law deals with the theft of pigs,\nTitle III with cattle, Title IV with sheep, Title V with goats, Title VI with\ndogs, each time with an elaborate breakdown differentiating between animals of\ndifferent age and sex.[44](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts044)\n\nThis does make a great deal of psychological sense. I’ve already remarked how\ndifficult it is to imagine how a system of precise equivalences—one young\nhealthy milk cow is equivalent to exactly thirty-six chickens—could arise from\nmost forms of gift exchange. If Henry gives Joshua a pig and feels he has\nreceived an inadequate counter-gift, he might mock Joshua as a cheapskate, but\nhe would have little occasion to come up with a mathematical formula for\nprecisely how cheap he feels Joshua has been. On the other hand, if Joshua’s\npig just destroyed Henry’s garden, and especially, if that led to a fight in\nwhich Henry lost a toe, and Henry’s family is now hauling Joshua up in front\nof the village assembly—this is precisely the context where people are most\nlikely to become petty and legalistic and express outrage if they feel they\nhave received one groat less than was their rightful due. That means exact\nmathematical specificity: for instance, the capacity to measure the exact\nvalue of a two-year-old pregnant sow. What’s more, the levying of penalties\nmust have constantly required the calculation of equivalences. Say the fine is\nin marten pelts but the culprit’s clan doesn’t have any martens. How many\nsquirrel skins will do? Or pieces of silver jewelry? Such problems must have\ncome up all the time and led to at least a rough-and-ready set of rules of\nthumb over what sorts of valuable were equivalent to others. This would help\nexplain why, for instance, medieval Welsh law codes can contain detailed\nbreakdowns not only of the value of different ages and conditions of milk cow,\nbut of the monetary value of every object likely to be found in an ordinary\nhomestead, down to the cost of each piece of timber—despite the fact that\nthere seems no reason to believe that most such items could even be purchased\non the open market at the\ntime.[45](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts045)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThere is something very compelling in all this. For one thing, the premise\nmakes a great deal of intuitive sense. After all, we do owe everything we are\nto others. This is simply true. The language we speak and even think in, our\nhabits and opinions, the kind of food we like to eat, the knowledge that makes\nour lights switch on and toilets flush, even the style in which we carry out\nour gestures of defiance and rebellion against social conventions—all of this,\nwe learned from other people, most of them long dead. If we were to imagine\nwhat we owe them as a debt, it could only be infinite. The question is: Does\nit really make sense to think of this as a debt? After all, a debt is by\ndefinition something that we could at least imagine paying back. It is strange\nenough to wish to be square with one’s parents—it rather implies that one does\nnot wish to think of them as parents any more. Would we really want to be\nsquare with all humanity? What would that even mean? And is this desire really\na fundamental feature of all human thought?\n\nAnother way to put this would be: Are primordial-debt theorists _describing_ a\nmyth, have they discovered a profound truth of the human condition that has\nalways existed in all societies, and is it simply spelled out particularly\nclearly in certain ancient texts from India—or are they _inventing_ a myth of\ntheir own?\n\nClearly it must be the latter. They are inventing a myth.\n\nThe choice of the Vedic material is significant. The fact is, we know almost\nnothing about the people who composed these texts and little about the society\nthat created them.[46](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts046) We don’t\neven know if interest-bearing loans existed in Vedic India—which obviously has\na bearing on whether priests really saw sacrifice as the payment of interest\non a loan we owe to Death.[47](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts047)\nAs a result, the material can serve as a kind of empty canvas, or a canvas\ncovered with hieroglyphics in an unknown language, on which we can project\nalmost anything we want to. If we look at other ancient civilizations in which\nwe do know something about the larger context, we find that no such notion of\nsacrifice as payment is in\nevidence.[48](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts048) If we look\nthrough the work of ancient theologians, we find that most were familiar with\nthe idea that sacrifice was a way by which human beings could enter into\ncommercial relations with the gods, but that they felt it was patently\nridiculous: If the gods already have everything they want, what exactly do\nhumans have to bargain\nwith?[49](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts049) We’ve seen in the\nlast chapter how difficult it is to give gifts to kings. With gods (let alone\nGod) the problem is magnified infinitely. Exchange implies equality. In\ndealing with cosmic forces, this was simply assumed to be impossible from the\nstart.\n\nThe notion that debts to gods were appropriated by the state, and thus became\nthe bases for taxation systems, can’t really stand up either. The problem here\nis that in the ancient world, free citizens didn’t usually pay taxes.\nGenerally speaking, tribute was levied only on conquered populations. This was\nalready true in ancient Mesopotamia, where the inhabitants of independent\ncities did not usually have to pay direct taxes at all. Similarly, as Moses\nFinley put it, “Classical Greeks looked upon direct taxes as tyrannical and\navoided them whenever\npossible.[50](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts050) Athenian citizens\ndid not pay direct taxes of any sort; though the city did sometimes distribute\nmoney to its citizens, a kind of reverse taxation—sometimes directly, as with\nthe proceeds of the Laurium silver mines, and sometimes indirectly, as through\ngenerous fees for jury duty or attending the assembly. Subject cities,\nhowever, did have to pay tribute. Even within the Persian Empire, Persians did\nnot have to pay tribute to the Great King, but the inhabitants of conquered\nprovinces did.[51](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts051) The same was\ntrue in Rome, where for a very long time, Roman citizens not only paid no\ntaxes but had a right to a share of the tribute levied on others, in the form\nof the dole—the “bread” part of the famous “bread and\ncircuses.”[52](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts052)\n\nIn other words, Benjamin Franklin was wrong when he said that in this world\nnothing is certain except death and taxes. This obviously makes the idea that\nthe debt to one is just a variation on the other much harder to maintain.\n\nNone of this, however, deals a mortal blow to the state theory of money. Even\nthose states that did not demand taxes did levy fees, penalties, tariffs, and\nfines of one sort or another. But it _is_ very hard to reconcile with any\ntheory that claims states were first conceived as guardians of some sort of\ncosmic, primordial debt.\n\nIt’s curious that primordial-debt theorists never have much to say about Sumer\nor Babylonia, despite the fact that Mesopotamia is where the practice of\nloaning money at interest was first invented, probably two thousand years\nbefore the Vedas were composed—and that it was also the home of the world’s\nfirst states. But if we look into Mesopotamian history, it becomes a little\nless surprising. Again, what we find there is in many ways the exact opposite\nof what such theorists would have predicted.\n\nThe reader will recall here that Mesopotamian city-states were dominated by\nvast Temples: gigantic, complex industrial institutions often staffed by\nthousands—including everyone from shepherds and barge-pullers to spinners and\nweavers to dancing girls and clerical administrators. By at least 2700 bc,\nambitious rulers had begun to imitate them by creating palace complexes\norganized on similar terms—with the exception that where the Temples centered\non the sacred chambers of a god or goddess, represented by a sacred image who\nwas fed and clothed and entertained by priestly servants as if he or she were\na living person. Palaces centered on the chambers of an actual live king.\nSumerian rulers rarely went so far as to declare themselves gods, but they\noften came very close. However, when they did interfere in the lives of their\nsubjects in their capacity as cosmic rulers, they did not do it by imposing\npublic debts, but rather by canceling private\nones.[53](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts053)\n\nWe don’t know precisely when and how interest-bearing loans originated, since\nthey appear to predate writing. Most likely, Temple administrators invented\nthe idea as a way of financing the caravan trade. This trade was crucial\nbecause while the river valley of ancient Mesopotamia was extraordinarily\nfertile and produced huge surpluses of grain and other foodstuffs, and\nsupported enormous numbers of livestock, which in turn supported a vast wool\nand leather industry, it was almost completely lacking in anything else.\nStone, wood, metal, even the silver used as money, all had to be imported.\nFrom quite early times, then, Temple administrators developed the habit of\nadvancing goods to local merchants—some of them private, others themselves\nTemple functionaries—who would then go off and sell it overseas. Interest was\njust a way for the Temples to take their share of the resulting\nprofits.[54](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts054) However, once\nestablished, the principle seems to have quickly spread. Before long, we find\nnot only commercial loans, but also consumer loans—usury in the classical\nsense of the term. By c2400 bc it already appears to have been common practice\non the part of local officials, or wealthy merchants, to advance loans to\npeasants who were in financial trouble on collateral and begin to appropriate\ntheir possessions if they were unable to pay. It usually started with grain,\nsheep, goats, and furniture, then moved on to fields and houses, or,\nalternately or ultimately, family members. Servants, if any, went quickly,\nfollowed by children, wives, and in some extreme occasions, even the borrower\nhimself. These would be reduced to debt-peons: not quite slaves, but very\nclose to that, forced into perpetual service in the lender’s household—or,\nsometimes, in the Temples or Palaces themselves. In theory, of course, any of\nthem could be redeemed whenever the borrower repaid the money, but for obvious\nreasons, the more a peasant’s resources were stripped away from him, the\nharder that became.\n\nThe effects were such that they often threatened to rip society apart. If for\nany reason there was a bad harvest, large proportions of the peasantry would\nfall into debt peonage; families would be broken up. Before long, lands lay\nabandoned as indebted farmers fled their homes for fear of repossession and\njoined semi-nomadic bands on the desert fringes of urban civilization. Faced\nwith the potential for complete social breakdown, Sumerian and later\nBabylonian kings periodically announced general amnesties: “clean slates,” as\neconomic historian Michael Hudson refers to them. Such decrees would typically\ndeclare all outstanding consumer debt null and void (commercial debts were not\naffected), return all land to its original owners, and allow all debt-peons to\nreturn to their families. Before long, it became more or less a regular habit\nfor kings to make such a declaration on first assuming power, and many were\nforced to repeat it periodically over the course of their reigns.\n\nIn Sumeria, these were called “declarations of freedom”—and it is significant\nthat the Sumerian word _amargi_ , the first recorded word for “freedom” in any\nknown human language, literally means “return to mother”—since this is what\nfreed debt-peons were finally allowed to\ndo.[55](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts055)\n\nMichael Hudson argues that Mesopotamian kings were only in a position to do\nthis because of their cosmic pretensions: in taking power, they saw themselves\nas literally recreating human society, and so were in a position to wipe the\nslate clean of all previous moral obligations. Still, this is about as far\nfrom what primordial-debt theorists had in mind as one could possibly\nimagine.[56](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts056)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nProbably the biggest problem in this whole body of literature is the initial\nassumption: that we begin with an infinite debt to something called “society.”\nIt’s this debt to society that we project onto the gods. It’s this same debt\nthat then gets taken up by kings and national governments.\n\nWhat makes the concept of society so deceptive is that we assume the world is\norganized into a series of compact, modular units called “societies,” and that\nall people know which one they’re in. Historically, this is very rarely the\ncase. Imagine I am a Christian Armenian merchant living under the reign of\nGenghis Khan. What is “society” for me? Is it the city where I grew up, the\nsociety of international merchants (with its own elaborate codes of conduct)\nwithin which I conduct my daily affairs, other speakers of Armenian,\nChristendom (or maybe just Orthodox Christendom), or the inhabitants of the\nMongol empire itself, which stretched from the Mediterranean to Korea?\nHistorically, kingdoms and empires have rarely been the most important\nreference points in peoples’ lives. Kingdoms rise and fall; they also\nstrengthen and weaken; governments may make their presence known in people’s\nlives quite sporadically, and many people in history were never entirely clear\nwhose government they were actually in. Even until quite recently, many of the\nworld’s inhabitants were never even quite sure what country they were supposed\nto be in, or why it should matter. My mother, who was born a Jew in Poland,\nonce told me a joke from her childhood:\n\nThere was a small town located along the frontier between Russia and Poland;\nno one was ever quite sure to which it belonged. One day an official treaty\nwas signed and not long after, surveyors arrived to draw a border. Some\nvillagers approached them where they had set up their equipment on a nearby\nhill.\n\n“So where are we, Russia or Poland?”\n\n“According to our calculations, your village now begins exactly thirty-seven\nmeters into Poland.”\n\nThe villagers immediately began dancing for joy.\n\n“Why?” the surveyors asked. “What difference does it make?”\n\n“Don’t you know what this means?” they replied. “It means we’ll never have to\nendure another one of those terrible Russian winters!”\n\nHowever, if we are born with an infinite debt to all those people who made our\nexistence possible, but there is no natural unit called “society”—then who or\nwhat exactly do we really owe it to? Everyone? Everything? Some people or\nthings more than others? And how do we pay a debt to something so diffuse? Or,\nperhaps more to the point, who exactly can claim the authority to tell us how\nwe can repay it, and on what grounds?\n\nIf we frame the problem that way, the authors of the Brahmanas are offering a\nquite sophisticated reflection on a moral question that no one has really ever\nbeen able to answer any better before or since. As I say, we can’t know much\nabout the conditions under which those texts were composed, but such evidence\nas we do have suggests that the crucial documents date from sometime between\n500 and 400 bc—that is, roughly the time of Socrates—which in India appears to\nhave been just around the time that a commercial economy, and institutions\nlike coined money and interest-bearing loans were beginning to become features\nof everyday life. The intellectual classes of the time were, much as they were\nin Greece and China, grappling with the implications. In their case, this\nmeant asking: What does it mean to imagine our responsibilities as debts? To\nwhom do we owe our existence?\n\nIt’s significant that their answer did not make any mention either of\n“society” or states (though certainly kings and governments certainly existed\nin early India). Instead, they fixed on debts to gods, to sages, to fathers,\nand to “men.” It wouldn’t be at all difficult to translate their formulation\ninto more contemporary language. We could put it this way. We owe our\nexistence above all:\n\n• To the universe, cosmic forces, as we would put it now, to Nature. The\nground of our existence. To be repaid through ritual: ritual being an act of\nrespect and recognition to all that beside which we are\nsmall.[57](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts057)\n\n• To those who have created the knowledge and cultural accomplishments that we\nvalue most; that give our existence its form, its meaning, but also its shape.\nHere we would include not only the philosophers and scientists who created our\nintellectual tradition but everyone from William Shakespeare to that long-\nsince-forgotten woman, somewhere in the Middle East, who created leavened\nbread. We repay them by becoming learned ourselves and contributing to human\nknowledge and human culture.\n\n• To our parents, and their parents—our ancestors. We repay them by becoming\nancestors.\n\n• To humanity as a whole. We repay them by generosity to strangers, by\nmaintaining that basic communistic ground of sociality that makes human\nrelations, and hence life, possible.\n\nSet out this way, though, the argument begins to undermine its very premise.\nThese are nothing like commercial debts. After all, one might repay one’s\nparents by having children, but one is not generally thought to have repaid\none’s creditors if one lends the cash to someone\nelse.[58](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts058)\n\nMyself, I wonder: Couldn’t that really be the point? Perhaps what the authors\nof the Brahmanas were really demonstrating was that, in the final analysis,\nour relation with the cosmos is ultimately nothing like a commercial\ntransaction, nor could it be. That is because commercial transactions imply\nboth equality and separation. These examples are all about overcoming\nseparation: you are free from your debt to your ancestors when you become an\nancestor; you are free from your debt to the sages when you become a sage, you\nare free from your debt to humanity when you act with humanity. All the more\nso if one is speaking of the universe. If you cannot bargain with the gods\nbecause they already have everything, then you certainly cannot bargain with\nthe universe, because the universe _is_ everything—and that everything\nnecessarily includes yourself. One could in fact interpret this list as a\nsubtle way of saying that the only way of “freeing oneself” from the debt was\nnot literally repaying debts, but rather showing that these debts do not exist\nbecause one is not in fact separate to begin with, and hence that the very\nnotion of canceling the debt, and achieving a separate, autonomous existence,\nwas ridiculous from the start. Or even that the very presumption of positing\noneself as separate from humanity or the cosmos, so much so that one can enter\ninto one-to-one dealings with it, is itself the crime that can be answered\nonly by death. Our guilt is not due to the fact that we cannot repay our debt\nto the universe. Our guilt is our presumption in thinking of ourselves as\nbeing in any sense an equivalent to Everything Else that Exists or Has Ever\nExisted, so as to be able to conceive of such a debt in the first\nplace.[59](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts059)\n\nOr let us look at the other side of the equation. Even if it is possible to\nimagine ourselves as standing in a position of absolute debt to the cosmos, or\nto humanity, the next question becomes: Who exactly has a right to speak for\nthe cosmos, or humanity, to tell us how that debt must be repaid? If there’s\nanything more preposterous than claiming to stand apart from the entire\nuniverse so as to enter into negotiations with it, it is claiming to speak for\nthe other side.\n\nIf one were looking for the ethos for an individualistic society such as our\nown, one way to do it might well be to say: we all owe an infinite debt to\nhumanity, society, nature, or the cosmos (however one prefers to frame it),\nbut no one else could possibly tell us how we are to pay it. This at least\nwould be intellectually consistent. If so, it would actually be possible to\nsee almost all systems of established authority—religion, morality, politics,\neconomics, and the criminal-justice system—as so many different fraudulent\nways to presume to calculate what cannot be calculated, to claim the authority\nto tell us how some aspect of that unlimited debt ought to be repaid. Human\nfreedom would then be our ability to decide for ourselves how we want to do\nso.\n\nNo one, to my knowledge, has ever taken this approach. Instead, theories of\nexistential debt always end up becoming ways of justifying—or laying claim\nto—structures of authority. The case of the Hindu intellectual tradition is\ntelling here. The debt to humanity appears only in a few early texts, and is\nquickly forgotten. Almost all later Hindu commentators ignore it and instead\nput their emphasis on a man’s debt to his\nfather.[60](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts060)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nPrimordial-debt theorists have other fish to fry. They are not really\ninterested in the cosmos, but actually, in “society.”\n\nLet me return again to that word, “society.” The reason that it seems like\nsuch a simple, self-evident concept is because we mostly use it as a synonym\nfor “nation.” After all, when Americans speak of paying their debt to society,\nthey are not thinking of their responsibilities to people who live in Sweden.\nIt’s only the modern state, with its elaborate border controls and social\npolicies, that enables us to imagine “society” in this way, as a single\nbounded entity. This is why projecting that notion backwards into Vedic or\nMedieval times will always be deceptive, even though we don’t really have\nanother word.\n\nIt seems to me that this is exactly what the primordial-debt theorists are\ndoing: projecting such a notion backwards.\n\nReally, the whole complex of ideas they are talking about—the notion that\nthere is this thing called society, that we have a debt to it, that\ngovernments can speak for it, that it can be imagined as a sort of secular\ngod—all of these ideas emerged together around the time of the French\nRevolution, or in its immediate wake. In other words, it was born alongside\nthe idea of the modern nation-state.\n\nWe can already see them coming together clearly in the work of Auguste Comte,\nin early nineteenth-century France. Comte, a philosopher and political\npamphleteer now most famous for having first coined the term “sociology,” went\nso far, by the end of his life, as actually proposing a Religion of Society,\nwhich he called Positivism, broadly modeled on Medieval Catholicism, replete\nwith vestments where all the buttons were on the back (so they couldn’t be put\non without the help of others). In his last work, which he called a\n“Positivist Catechism,” he also laid down the first explicit theory of social\ndebt. At one point someone asks an imaginary Priest of Positivism what he\nthinks of the notion of human rights. The priest scoffs at the very idea. This\nis nonsense, he says, an error born of individualism. Positivism understands\nonly duties. After all:\n\nWe are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to\nour successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations\nincrease or accumulate before the point where we are capable of rendering\nanyone any service. On what human foundation, then, could one seat the idea of\n“rights”?[61](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts061)\n\nWhile Comte doesn’t use the word “debt,” the sense is clear enough. We have\nalready accumulated endless debts before we get to the age at which we can\neven think of paying them. By that time, there’s no way to calculate to whom\nwe even owe them. The only way to redeem ourselves is to dedicate ourselves to\nthe service of Humanity as a whole.\n\nIn his lifetime, Comte was considered something of a crackpot, but his ideas\nproved influential. His notion of unlimited obligations to society ultimately\ncrystallized in the notion of the “social debt,” a notion taken up among\nsocial reformers and, eventually, socialist politicians in many parts of\nEurope and abroad.[62](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts062) “We are\nall born as debtors to society”: in France the notion of a social debt soon\nbecame something of a catchphrase, a slogan, and eventually a\ncliché.[63](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-nts063) The state,\naccording to this view, was merely the administrator of an existential debt\nthat all of us have to the society that created us, embodied not least in the\nfact that we all continue to be completely dependent on one another for our\nexistence, even if we are not completely aware of how.\n\nThese are also the intellectual and political circles that shaped the thought\nof Emile Durkheim, the founder of the discipline of sociology that we know\ntoday, who in a way did Comte one better by arguing that all gods in all\nreligions are always already projections of society—so an explicit religion of\nsociety would not even be necessary. All religions, for Durkheim, are simply\nways of recognizing our mutual dependence on one another, a dependence that\naffects us in a million ways that we are never entirely aware of. “God” and\n“society” are ultimately the same.\n\nThe problem is that for several hundred years now, it has simply been assumed\nthat the guardian of that debt we owe for all of this, the legitimate\nrepresentatives of that amorphous social totality that has allowed us to\nbecome individuals, must necessarily be the state. Almost all socialist or\nsocialistic regimes end up appealing to some version of this argument. To take\none notorious example, this was how the Soviet Union used to justify\nforbidding their citizens from emigrating to other countries. The argument was\nalways: The USSR created these people, the USSR raised and educated them, made\nthem who they are. What right do they have to take the product of our\ninvestment and transfer it to another country, as if they didn’t owe us\nanything? Neither is this rhetoric restricted to socialist regimes.\nNationalists appeal to exactly the same kind of arguments—especially in times\nof war. And all modern governments are nationalist to some degree.\n\nOne might even say that what we really have, in the idea of primordial debt,\nis the ultimate nationalist myth. Once we owed our lives to the gods that\ncreated us, paid interest in the form of animal sacrifice, and ultimately paid\nback the principal with our lives. Now we owe it to the Nation that formed us,\npay interest in the form of taxes, and when it comes time to defend the nation\nagainst its enemies, to offer to pay it with our lives.\n\nThis is a great trap of the twentieth century: on one side is the logic of the\nmarket, where we like to imagine we all start out as individuals who don’t owe\neach other anything. On the other is the logic of the state, where we all\nbegin with a debt we can never truly pay. We are constantly told that they are\nopposites, and that between them they contain the only real human\npossibilities. But it’s a false dichotomy. States created markets. Markets\nrequire states. Neither could continue without the other, at least, in\nanything like the forms we would recognize today.\n\n\n# **Chapter Four**  \n  \n**CRUELTY AND REDEMPTION**\n\n_We will buy the poor for silver, the needy for a pair of sandals_.\n\n_—Amos_ 2:6\n\nTHE READER MAY have noticed that there is an unresolved debate between those\nwho see money as a commodity and those who see it as an IOU. Which one is it?\nBy now, the answer should be obvious: it’s both. Keith Hart, probably the\nbest-known current anthropological authority on the subject, pointed this out\nmany years ago. There are, he famously observed, two sides to any coin:\n\nLook at a coin from your pocket. On one side is “heads”—the symbol of the\npolitical authority which minted the coin; on the other side is “tails”—the\nprecise specification of the amount the coin is worth as payment in exchange.\nOne side reminds us that states underwrite currencies and the money is\noriginally a relation between persons in society, a token perhaps. The other\nreveals the coin as a thing, capable of entering into definite relations with\nother things.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts001)\n\nClearly, money was not invented to overcome the inconveniences of barter\nbetween neighbors—since neighbors would have no reason to engage in barter in\nthe first place. Still, a system of pure credit money would have serious\ninconveniences as well. Credit money is based on trust, and in competitive\nmarkets, trust itself becomes a scarce commodity. This is particularly true of\ndealings between strangers. Within the Roman empire, a silver coin stamped\nwith the image of Tiberius might have circulated at a value considerably\nhigher than the value of the silver it contained. Ancient coins invariably\ncirculated at a value higher than their metal\ncontent.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts002) This was largely\nbecause Tiberius’s government was willing to accept them at face value.\nHowever, the Persian government probably wasn’t, and the Mauryan and Chinese\ngovernments certainly weren’t. Very large numbers of Roman gold and silver\ncoins did end up in India and even China; this is presumably the main reason\nthat they were made of gold and silver to begin with.\n\nWhat’s true for a vast empire like Rome or China is obviously all the more\ntrue for a Sumerian or Greek city-state, let alone anyone operating within the\nkind of broken checkerboard of kingdoms, towns, and tiny principalities that\nprevailed in most of Medieval Europe or India. As I’ve pointed out, often what\nwas inside and what was outside were not especially clear. Within a\ncommunity—a town, a city, a guild or religious society—pretty much anything\ncould function as money, provided everyone knew there was _someone_ willing to\naccept it to cancel out a debt. To offer one particularly striking example, in\ncertain cities in nineteenth-century Siam, small change consisted entirely of\nporcelain Chinese gaming counters—basically, the equivalent of poker\nchips—issued by local casinos. If one of these casinos went out of business or\nlost its license, its owners would have to send a crier through the streets\nbanging a gong and announcing that anyone holding such chits had three days to\nredeem them.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts003) For major\ntransactions, of course, currency that was also acceptable outside the\ncommunity (usually silver or gold again) was ordinarily employed.\n\nIn a similar way, English shops, for many centuries, would issue their own\nwood or lead or leather token money. The practice was often technically\nillegal, but it continued until relatively recent times. Here is an example\nfrom the seventeenth century, by a certain Henry, who had a store at Stony\nStratford, Buckinghamshire:\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_001_r1.jpg)\n\nThis is clearly a case of the same principle: Henry would provide small change\nin the form of IOUs redeemable at his own store. As such, they might circulate\nbroadly, at least among anyone who did regular business at that shop. But they\nwere unlikely to travel very far from Stony Stratford—most tokens, in fact,\nnever circulated more than a few blocks in any direction. For larger\ntransactions, everyone, including Henry, expected money in a form that would\nbe acceptable anywhere, including in Italy or\nFrance.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts004)\n\nThroughout most of history, even where we do find elaborate markets, we also\nfind a complex jumble of different sorts of currency. Some of these may have\noriginally emerged from barter between foreigners: the cacao money of\nMesoamerica or salt money of Ethiopia are frequently cited\nexamples.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts005) Others arose from\ncredit systems, or from arguments over what sort of goods should be acceptable\nto pay taxes or other debts. Such questions were often matters of endless\ncontestation. One could often learn a lot about the balance of political\nforces in a given time and place by what sorts of things were acceptable as\ncurrency. For instance: in much the same way that colonial Virginia planters\nmanaged to pass a law obliging shopkeepers to accept their tobacco as\ncurrency, medieval Pomeranian peasants appear to have at certain points\nconvinced their rulers to make taxes, fees, and customs duties, which were\nregistered in Roman currency, actually payable in wine, cheese, peppers,\nchickens, eggs, and even herring—much to the annoyance of traveling merchants,\nwho therefore had to either carry such things around in order to pay the tolls\nor buy them locally at prices that would have been more advantageous to their\nsuppliers for that very\nreason.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts006) This was in an area\nwith a free peasantry, rather than serfs. They were in a relatively strong\npolitical position. In other times and places, the interests of lords and\nmerchants prevailed instead.\n\nThus money is almost always something hovering between a commodity and a debt-\ntoken. This is probably why coins—pieces of silver or gold that are already\nvaluable commodities in themselves, but that, being stamped with the emblem of\na local political authority, became even more valuable—still sit in our heads\nas the quintessential form of money. They most perfectly straddle the divide\nthat defines what money is in the first place. What’s more, the relation\nbetween the two was a matter of constant political contestation.\n\nIn other words, the battle between state and market, between governments and\nmerchants is not inherent to the human condition.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nOur two origin stories—the myth of barter and the myth of primordial debt—may\nappear to be about as far apart as they could be, but in their own way, they\nare also two sides of the same coin. One assumes the other. It’s only once we\ncan imagine human life as a series of commercial transactions that we’re\ncapable of seeing our relation to the universe in terms of debt.\n\nTo illustrate, let me call a perhaps surprising witness, Friedrich Nietzsche,\na man able to see with uncommon clarity what happens when you try to imagine\nthe world in commercial terms.\n\nNietzsche’s _On the Genealogy of Morals_ appeared in 1887. In it, he begins\nwith an argument that might well have been taken directly from Adam Smith—but\nhe takes it a step further than Smith ever dared to, insisting that not just\nbarter, but buying and selling itself, precede any other form of human\nrelationship. The feeling of personal obligation, he observes,\n\nhas its origin in the oldest and most primitive personal relationship there\nis, in the relationship between seller and buyer, creditor and debtor. Here\nfor the first time one person moved up against another person, here an\nindividual _measured himself_ against another individual. We have found no\ncivilization still at such a low level that something of this relationship is\nnot already perceptible. To set prices, to measure values, to think up\nequivalencies, to exchange things—that preoccupied man’s very first thinking\nto such a degree that in a certain sense it’s what thinking _itself_ is. Here\nthe oldest form of astuteness was bred; here, too, we can assume are the first\nbeginnings of man’s pride, his feeling of pre-eminence in relation to other\nanimals. Perhaps our word “man” (_manas_) continues to express directly\nsomething of _this_ feeling of the self: the human being describes himself as\na being which assesses values, which values and measures, as the “inherently\ncalculating animal.” Selling and buying, together with their psychological\nattributes, are even older than the beginnings of any form of social\norganizations and groupings; out of the most rudimentary form of personal\nlegal rights the budding feeling of exchange, contract, guilt, law, duty, and\ncompensation was instead first _transferred_ to the crudest and earliest\nsocial structures (in their relationships with similar social structures),\nalong with the habit of comparing power with power, of measuring, of\ncalculating.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts007)\n\nSmith, too, we will remember, saw the origins of language—and hence of human\nthought—as lying in our propensity to “exchange one thing for another,” in\nwhich he also saw the origins of the\nmarket.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts008) The urge to trade,\nto compare values, is the very thing that makes us intelligent beings, and\ndifferent from other animals. Society comes later—which means our ideas about\nresponsibilities to other people first take shape in strictly commercial\nterms.\n\nUnlike with Smith, however, it never occurred to Nietzsche that you could have\na world where all such transactions immediately cancel out. Any system of\ncommercial accounting, he assumed, will produce creditors and debtors. In\nfact, he believed that it was from this very fact that human morality emerged.\nNote, he says, how the German word _schuld_ means both “debt” and “guilt.” At\nfirst, to be in debt was simply to be guilty, and creditors delighted in\npunishing debtors unable to repay their loans by inflicting “all sorts of\nhumiliation and torture on the body of the debtor, for instance, cutting as\nmuch flesh off as seemed appropriate for the\ndebt.”[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts009) In fact, Nietzsche\nwent so far as to insist that those original barbarian law codes that\ntabulated so much for a ruined eye, so much for a severed finger, were not\noriginally meant to fix rates of monetary compensation for the loss of eyes\nand fingers, but to establish how much of the debtor’s body creditors were\nallowed to take! Needless to say, he doesn’t provide a scintilla of evidence\nfor this (none exists).[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts010) But\nto ask for evidence would be to miss the point. We are dealing here not with a\nreal historical argument but with a purely imaginative exercise.\n\nWhen humans did begin to form communities, Nietzsche continues, they\nnecessarily began to imagine their relationship to the community in these\nterms. The tribe provides them with peace and security. They are therefore in\nits debt. Obeying its laws is a way of paying it back (“paying your debt to\nsociety” again). But this debt, he says, is also paid—here too—in sacrifice:\n\nWithin the original tribal cooperatives—we’re talking about primeval times—the\nliving generation always acknowledged a legal obligation to the previous\ngenerations, and especially to the earliest one which had founded the tribe\n[…] Here the reigning conviction is that the tribe only _exists_ at all only\nbecause of the sacrifices and achievements of its ancestors—and that people\nhave to _pay them back_ with sacrifices and achievements. In this people\nrecognize a _debt_ which keeps steadily growing because these ancestors in\ntheir continuing existence as powerful spirits do not stop giving the tribe\nnew advantages and lending them their power. Do they do this for free? But\nthere is no “for free” for those raw and “spiritually destitute” ages. What\ncan people give back to them? Sacrifices (at first as nourishment understood\nvery crudely), festivals, chapels, signs of honor, above all, obedience—for\nall customs, as work of one’s ancestors, are also their statutes and commands.\nDo people ever give them enough? This suspicion remains and\ngrows.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts011)\n\nIn other words, for Nietzsche, starting from Adam Smith’s assumptions about\nhuman nature means we must necessarily end up with something very much along\nthe lines of primordial-debt theory. On the one hand, it is because of our\nfeeling of debt to the ancestors that we obey the ancestral laws: this is why\nwe feel that the community has the right to react “like an angry creditor” and\npunish us for our transgressions if we break them. In a larger sense, we\ndevelop a creeping feeling that we could never really pay back the ancestors,\nthat no sacrifice (not even the sacrifice of our first-born) will ever truly\nredeem us. We are terrified of the ancestors, and the stronger and more\npowerful a community becomes, the more powerful they seem to be, until\nfinally, “the ancestor is necessarily transfigured into a god.” As communities\ngrow into kingdoms and kingdoms into universal empires, the gods themselves\ncome to seem more universal, they take on grander, more cosmic pretentions,\nruling the heavens, casting thunderbolts—culminating in the Christian god,\nwho, as the maximal deity, necessarily “brought about the maximum feeling of\nindebtedness on earth.” Even our ancestor Adam is no longer figured as a\ncreditor, but as a transgressor, and therefore a debtor, who passes on to us\nhis burden of Original Sin:\n\nFinally, with the impossibility of discharging the debt, people also come up\nwith the notion that it is impossible to remove the penance, the idea that it\ncannot be paid off (“ _eternal_ punishment”) … until all of a sudden we\nconfront the paradoxical and horrifying expedient with which a martyred\nhumanity found temporary relief, that stroke of genius of _Christianity:_ God\nsacrificing himself for the guilt of human beings, God paying himself back\nwith himself, God as the only one who can redeem man from what for human\nbeings has become impossible to redeem—the creditor sacrificing himself for\nthe debtor, out of _love_ (can people believe that?), out of love for his\ndebtor![12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts012)\n\nIt all makes perfect sense if you start from Nietzsche’s initial premise. The\nproblem is that the premise is insane.\n\nThere is also every reason to believe that Nietzsche knew the premise was\ninsane; in fact, that this was the entire point. What Nietzsche is doing here\nis starting out from the standard, common-sense assumptions about the nature\nof human beings prevalent in his day (and to a large extent, still\nprevalent)—that we are rational calculating machines, that commercial self-\ninterest comes before society, that “society” itself is just a way of putting\na kind of temporary lid on the resulting conflict. That is, he is starting out\nfrom ordinary bourgeois assumptions and driving them to a place where they can\nonly shock a bourgeois audience.\n\nIt’s a worthy game and no one has ever played it better; but it’s a game\nplayed entirely within the boundaries of bourgeois thought. It has nothing to\nsay to anything that lies beyond that. The best response to anyone who wants\nto take seriously Nietzsche’s fantasies about savage hunters chopping pieces\noff each other’s bodies for failure to remit are the words of an actual\nhunter-gatherer—an Inuit from Greenland made famous in the Danish writer Peter\nFreuchen’s _Book of the Eskimo_. Freuchen tells how one day, after coming home\nhungry from an unsuccessful walrus-hunting expedition, he found one of the\nsuccessful hunters dropping off several hundred pounds of meat. He thanked him\nprofusely. The man objected indignantly:\n\n“Up in our country we are human!” said the hunter. “And since we are human we\nhelp each other. We don’t like to hear anybody say thanks for that. What I get\ntoday you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and\nby whips one makes dogs.”[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts013)\n\nThe last line is something of an anthropological classic, and similar\nstatements about the refusal to calculate credits and debits can be found\nthrough the anthropological literature on egalitarian hunting societies.\nRather than seeing himself as human because he could make economic\ncalculations, the hunter insisted that being truly human meant _refusing_ to\nmake such calculations, refusing to measure or remember who had given what to\nwhom, for the precise reason that doing so would inevitably create a world\nwhere we began “comparing power with power, measuring, calculating” and\nreducing each other to slaves or dogs through debt.\n\nIt’s not that he, like untold millions of similar egalitarian spirits\nthroughout history, was unaware that humans have a propensity to calculate. If\nhe wasn’t aware of it, he could not have said what he did. Of course we have a\npropensity to calculate. We have all sorts of propensities. In any real-life\nsituation, we have propensities that drive us in several different\ncontradictory directions simultaneously. No one is more real than any other.\nThe real question is which we take as the foundation of our humanity, and\ntherefore, make the basis of our civilization. If Nietzsche’s analysis of debt\nis helpful to us, then, it is because it reveals that when we start from the\nassumption that human thought is essentially a matter of commercial\ncalculation, that buying and selling are the basis of human society—then, yes,\nonce we begin to think about our relationship with the cosmos, we will\nnecessarily conceive of it in terms of debt.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nI do think Nietzsche helps us in another way as well: to understand the\nconcept of redemption. Niezsche’s account of “primeval times” might be absurd,\nbut his description of Christianity—of how a sense of debt is transformed into\nan abiding sense of guilt, and guilt to self-loathing, and self-loathing to\nself-torture—all of this does ring very true.\n\nWhy, for instance, do we refer to Christ as the “redeemer”? The primary\nmeaning of “redemption” is to buy something back, or to recover something that\nhad been given up in security for a loan; to acquire something by paying off a\ndebt. It is rather striking to think that the very core of the Christian\nmessage, salvation itself, the sacrifice of God’s own son to rescue humanity\nfrom eternal damnation, should be framed in the language of a financial\ntransaction.\n\nNietzsche might have been starting from the same assumptions as Adam Smith,\nbut clearly the early Christians weren’t. The roots of this thinking lie\ndeeper than Smith’s with his nation of shopkeepers. The authors of the\nBrahmanas were not alone in borrowing the language of the marketplace as a way\nof thinking about the human condition. Indeed, to one degree or another, all\nthe major world religions do this.\n\nThe reason is that all of them—from Zoroastrianism to Islam—arose amidst\nintense arguments about the role of money and the market in human life, and\nparticularly about what these institutions meant for fundamental questions of\nwhat human beings owed to one another. The question of debt, and arguments\nabout debt, ran through every aspect of the political life of the time. These\narguments were set amidst revolts, petitions, reformist movements. Some such\nmovements gained allies in the temples and palaces. Others were brutally\nsuppressed. Most of the terms, slogans, and specific issues being debated,\nthough, have been lost to history. We just don’t know what a political debate\nin a Syrian tavern in 750 bc was likely to be about. As a result, we have\nspent thousands of years contemplating sacred texts full of political\nallusions that would have been instantly recognizable to any reader at the\ntime when they were written, but whose meaning we now can only guess\nat.[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts014)\n\nOne of the unusual things about the Bible is that it preserves some bits of\nthis larger context. To return to the notion of redemption: the Hebrew words\n_padah_ and _goal_ , both translated as “redemption,” could be used for buying\nback anything one had sold to someone else, particularly the recovery of\nancestral land, or to recovering some object held by creditors in way of a\npledge.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts015) The example\nforemost in the minds of prophets and theologians seems to have been the last:\nthe redemption of pledges, and especially, of family members held as debt-\npawns. It would seem that the economy of the Hebrew kingdoms, by the time of\nthe prophets, was already beginning to develop the same kind of debt crises\nthat had long been common in Mesopotamia: especially in years of bad harvests,\nthe poor became indebted to rich neighbors or to wealthy moneylenders in the\ntowns, they would begin to lose title to their fields and to become tenants on\nwhat had been their own land, and their sons and daughters would be removed to\nserve as servants in their creditors’ households, or even sold abroad as\nslaves.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts016) The earlier\nprophets contain allusions to such crises, but the book of Nehemiah, written\nin Persian times, is the most\nexplicit:[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts017)\n\nSome also there were that said, “We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and\nhouses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.”\n\nThere were also those that said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s\ntribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.\n\n“Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their\nchildren: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be\nservants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither\nis it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and\nvineyards.”\n\nAnd I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.\n\nThen I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and\nsaid unto them, “Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.” And I set a great\nassembly against them.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts018)\n\nNehemiah was a Jew born in Babylon, a former cup-bearer to the Persian\nemperor. In 444 bc, he managed to talk the Great King into appointing him\ngovernor of his native Judaea. He also received permission to rebuild the\nTemple in Jerusalem that had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar more than two\ncenturies earlier. In the course of rebuilding, sacred texts were recovered\nand restored; in a sense, this was the moment of the creation of what we now\nconsider Judaism.\n\nThe problem was that Nehemiah quickly found himself confronted with a social\ncrisis. All around him, impoverished peasants were unable to pay their taxes;\ncreditors were carrying off the children of the poor. His first response was\nto issue a classic Babylonian-style “clean slate” edict—having himself been\nborn in Babylon, he was clearly familiar with the general principle. All non-\ncommercial debts were to be forgiven. Maximum interest rates were set. At the\nsame time, though, Nehemiah managed to locate, revise, and reissue much older\nJewish laws, now preserved in Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Leviticus, which in\ncertain ways went even further, by institutionalizing the\nprinciple.[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts019) The most famous\nof these is the Law of Jubilee: a law that stipulated that all debts would be\nautomatically cancelled “in the Sabbath year” (that is, after seven years had\npassed), and that all who languished in bondage owing to such debts would be\nreleased.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts020)\n\n“Freedom,” in the Bible, as in Mesopotamia, came to refer above all to release\nfrom the effects of debt. Over time, the history of the Jewish people itself\ncame to be interpreted in this light: the liberation from bondage in Egypt was\nGod’s first, paradigmatic act of redemption; the historical tribulations of\nthe Jews (defeat, conquest, exile) were seen as misfortunes that would\neventually lead to a final redemption with the coming of the Messiah—though\nthis could only be accomplished, prophets such as Jeremiah warned them, after\nthe Jewish people truly repented of their sins (carrying each other off into\nbondage, whoring after false gods, the violation of\ncommandments).[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts021) In this\nlight, the adoption of the term by Christians is hardly surprising. Redemption\nwas a release from one’s burden of sin and guilt, and the end of history would\nbe that moment when all slates are wiped clean and all debts finally lifted\nwhen a great blast from angelic trumpets will announce the final Jubilee.\n\nIf so, “redemption” is no longer about buying something back. It’s really more\na matter of destroying the entire system of accounting. In many Middle Eastern\ncities, this was literally true: one of the common acts during debt\ncancelation was the ceremonial destruction of the tablets on which financial\nrecords had been kept, an act to be repeated, much less officially, in just\nabout every major peasant revolt in\nhistory.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts022)\n\nThis leads to another problem: What is possible in the meantime, before that\nfinal redemption comes? In one of his more disturbing parables, the Parable of\nthe Unforgiving Servant, Jesus seemed to be explicitly playing with the\nproblem:\n\nTherefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts\nwith his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand\ntalents was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered\nthat he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the\ndebt.\n\nThe servant fell on his knees before him. “Be patient with me,” he begged,\n“and I will pay back everything.” The servant’s master took pity on him,\ncanceled the debt, and let him go.\n\nBut when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed\nhim a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. “Pay back what\nyou owe me!” he demanded.\n\nHis fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, “Be patient with me, and\nI will pay you back.”\n\nBut he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until\nhe could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they\nwere greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had\nhappened.\n\nThen the master called the servant in. “You wicked servant,” he said, “I\ncanceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn’t you have\nhad mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?” In anger his master\nturned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he\nowed.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts023)\n\nThis is quite an extraordinary text. On one level it’s a joke; in others, it\ncould hardly be more serious.\n\nWe begin with the king wishing to “settle accounts” with his servants. The\npremise is absurd. Kings, like gods, can’t really enter into relations of\nexchange with their subjects, since no parity is possible. And this is a king\nwho clearly _is_ God. Certainly there can be no final settling of accounts.\n\nSo at best we are dealing with an act of whimsy on the king’s part. The\nabsurdity of the premise is hammered home by the sum the first man brought\nbefore him is said to owe. In ancient Judaea, to say someone owes a creditor\n“ten thousand talents” would be like now saying someone owes “a hundred\nbillion dollars.” The number is a joke, too; it simply stands in for “a sum no\nhuman being could ever, conceivably,\nrepay.”[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts024)\n\nFaced with infinite, existential debt, the servant can only tell obvious lies:\n“a hundred billion? Sure, I’m good for it! Just give me a little more time.”\nThen, suddenly, apparently just as arbitrarily, the Lord forgives him.\n\nYet, it turns out, the amnesty has a condition he is not aware of. It is\nincumbent on his being willing to act in an analogous way to other humans—in\nthis particular case, another servant who owes him (to translate again into\ncontemporary terms), maybe a thousand bucks. Failing the test, the human is\ncast into hell for all eternity, or “until he should pay back all he owed,”\nwhich in this case comes down to the same thing.\n\nThe parable has long been a challenge to theologians. It’s normally\ninterpreted as a comment on the endless bounty of God’s grace and how little\nHe demands of us in comparison—and thus, by implication, as a way of\nsuggesting that torturing us in hell for all eternity is not as unreasonable\nas it might seem. Certainly, the unforgiving servant is a genuinely odious\ncharacter. Still, what is even more striking to me is the tacit suggestion\nthat forgiveness, in this world, is ultimately impossible. Christians\npractically say as much every time they recite the Lord’s Prayer, and ask God\nto “forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our\ndebtors.”[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts025) It repeats the\nstory of the parable almost exactly, and the implications are similarly dire.\nAfter all, most Christians reciting the prayer are aware that they do not\ngenerally forgive their debtors. Why then should God forgive them their\nsins?[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts026)\n\nWhat’s more, there is the lingering suggestion that we really couldn’t live up\nto those standards, even if we tried. One of the things that makes the Jesus\nof the New Testament such a tantalizing character is that it’s never clear\nwhat he’s telling us. Everything can be read two ways. When he calls on his\nfollowers to forgive all debts, refuse to cast the first stone, turn the other\ncheek, love their enemies, to hand over their possessions to the poor—is he\nreally expecting them to do this? Or are such demands just a way of throwing\nin their faces that, since we are clearly not prepared to act this way, we are\nall sinners whose salvation can only come in another world—a position that can\nbe (and has been) used to justify almost anything? This is a vision of human\nlife as inherently corrupt, but it also frames even spiritual affairs in\ncommercial terms: with calculations of sin, penance, and absolution, the Devil\nand St. Peter with their rival ledger books, usually accompanied by the\ncreeping feeling that it’s all a charade because the very fact that we are\nreduced to playing such a game of tabulating sins reveals us to be\nfundamentally unworthy of forgiveness.\n\nWorld religions, as we shall see, are full of this kind of ambivalence. On the\none hand they are outcries against the market; on the other, they tend to\nframe their objections in commercial terms—as if to argue that turning human\nlife into a series of transactions is not a very good deal. What I think even\nthese few examples reveal, though, is how much is being papered over in the\nconventional accounts of the origins and history of money. There is something\nalmost touchingly naïve in the stories about neighbors swapping potatoes for\nan extra pair of shoes. When the ancients thought about money, friendly swaps\nwere hardly the first thing that came to mind.\n\nTrue, some might have thought about their tab at the local ale-house, or, if\nthey were a merchant or administrator, of storehouses, account books, exotic\nimported delights. For most, though, what was likely to come to mind was the\nselling of slaves and ransoming of prisoners, corrupt tax-farmers and the\ndepredations of conquering armies, mortgages and interest, theft and\nextortion, revenge and punishment, and, above all, the tension between the\nneed for money to create families, to acquire a bride so as to have children,\nand use of that same money to destroy families—to create debts that lead to\nthe same wife and children being taken away. “Some of our daughters are\nbrought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them.” One\ncan only imagine what those words meant, emotionally, to a father in a\npatriarchal society in which a man’s ability to protect the honor of his\nfamily was everything. Yet this is what money meant to the majority of people\nfor most of human history: the terrifying prospect of one’s sons and daughters\nbeing carried off to the homes of repulsive strangers to clean their pots and\nprovide the occasional sexual services, to be subject to every conceivable\nform of violence and abuse, possibly for years, conceivably forever, as their\nparents waited, helpless, avoiding eye contact with their neighbors, who knew\nexactly what was happening to those they were supposed to have been able to\nprotect.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts027) Clearly this was\nthe worst thing that could happen to anyone—which is why, in the parable, it\ncould be treated as interchangeable with being “turned over to the jailors to\nbe tortured” for life. And that’s just from the perspective of the father. One\ncan only imagine how it might have felt to be the daughter. Yet, over the\ncourse of human history, untold millions of daughters have known (and in fact\nmany still know) exactly what it’s like.\n\nOne might object that this was just assumed to be in the nature of things:\nlike the imposition of tribute on conquered populations, it might have been\nresented, but it wasn’t considered a moral issue, a matter of right and wrong.\nSome things just happen. This has been the most common attitude of peasants to\nsuch phenomena throughout human history. What’s striking about the historical\nrecord is that in the case of debt crises, this was _not_ how many reacted.\nMany actually did become indignant. So many, in fact, that most of our\ncontemporary language of social justice, our way of speaking of human bondage\nand emancipation, continues to echo ancient arguments about debt.\n\nIt’s particularly striking because so many other things do seem to have been\naccepted as simply in the nature of things. One does not see a similar outcry\nagainst caste systems, for example, or for that matter, the institution of\nslavery.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts028) Surely slaves and\nuntouchables often experienced at least equal horrors. No doubt many protested\ntheir condition. Why was it that the debtors’ protests seemed to carry such\ngreater moral weight? Why were debtors so much more effective in winning the\near of priests, prophets, officials, and social reformers? Why was it that\nofficials like Nehemiah were willing to give such sympathetic consideration to\ntheir complaints, to inveigh, to summon great assemblies?\n\nSome have suggested practical reasons: debt crises destroyed the free\npeasantry, and it was free peasants who were drafted into ancient armies to\nfight in wars.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts029) No doubt\nthis was a factor; clearly it wasn’t the only one. There is no reason to\nbelieve that Nehemiah, for instance, in his anger at the usurers, was\nprimarily concerned with his ability to levy troops for the Persian king. It\nis something more fundamental.\n\nWhat makes debt different is that it is premised on an assumption of equality.\n\nTo be a slave, or lower-caste, is to be intrinsically inferior. We are dealing\nwith relations of unadulterated hierarchy. In the case of debt, we are dealing\nwith two individuals who begin as equal parties to a contract. Legally, at\nleast as far as the contract is concerned, they are the same.\n\nWe can add that, in the ancient world, when people who actually were more or\nless social equals loaned money to one another, the terms appear to have\nnormally been quite generous. Often no interest was charged, or if it was, it\nwas very low. “And don’t charge me interest,” wrote one wealthy Canaanite to\nanother, in a tablet dated around 1200 bc, “after all, we are both\ngentlemen.”[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts030) Between close\nkin, many “loans” were probably, then as now, just gifts that no one seriously\nexpected to recover. Loans between rich and poor were something else again.\n\nThe problem was that, unlike status distinctions like caste or slavery, the\nline between rich and poor was never precisely drawn. One can imagine the\nreaction of a farmer who went up to the house of a wealthy cousin, on the\nassumption that “humans help each other,” and ended up, a year or two later,\nwatching his vineyard seized and his sons and daughters led away. Such\nbehavior could be justified, in legal terms, by insisting that the loan was\nnot a form of mutual aid but a commercial relationship—a contract is a\ncontract. (It also required a certain reliable access to superior force.) But\nit could only have felt like a terrible betrayal. What’s more, framing it as a\nbreach of contract meant stating that this was, in fact, a moral issue: these\ntwo parties _ought_ to be equals, but one had failed to honor the bargain.\nPsychologically, this can only have made the indignity of the debtor’s\ncondition all the more painful, since it made it possible to say that it was\nhis own turpitude that sealed his daughter’s fate. But that just made the\nmotive all the more compelling to throw back the moral aspersions: “Our flesh\nis as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children.” We are all\nthe same people. We have a responsibility to take account of one another’s\nneeds and interests. How then could my brother do this to me?\n\nIn the Old Testament case, debtors were able to marshal a particularly\npowerful moral argument—as the authors of Deuteronomy constantly reminded\ntheir readers, were not the Jews all slaves in Egypt, and had they not all\nbeen redeemed by God? Was it right, when they had all been given this promised\nland to share, for some to take that land away from others? Was it right for a\npopulation of liberated slaves to go about enslaving one aother’s\nchildren?[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-nts031) But analogous\narguments were being made in similar situations almost everywhere in the\nancient world: in Athens, in Rome, and for that matter, in China—where legend\nhad it that coinage itself was first invented by an ancient emperor to redeem\nthe children of families who had been forced to sell them after a series of\ndevastating floods.\n\nThrough most of history, when overt political conflict between classes did\nappear, it took the form of pleas for debt cancellation—the freeing of those\nin bondage, and usually, a more just reallocation of the land. What we see, in\nthe Bible and other religious traditions, are traces of the moral arguments by\nwhich such claims were justified, usually subject to all sorts of imaginative\ntwists and turns, but inevitably, to some degree, incorporating the language\nof the marketplace itself.\n\n\n# Chapter Five  \n  \nA BRIEF TREATISE ON THE MORAL GROUNDS OF ECONOMIC RELATIONS\n\nTO TELL THE HISTORY of debt, then, is also necessarily to reconstruct how the\nlanguage of the marketplace has come to pervade every aspect of human\nlife—even to provide the terminology for the moral and religious voices\nostensibly raised against it. We have already seen how both Vedic and\nChristian teachings thus end up making the same curious move: first describing\nall morality as debt, but then, in their very manner of doing so,\ndemonstrating that morality cannot really be reduced to debt, that it must be\ngrounded in something else.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts001)\n\nBut what? Religious traditions prefer vast, cosmological answers: the\nalternative to the morality of debt lies in recognition of continuity with the\nuniverse, or life in the expectation of the imminent annihilation of the\nuniverse, or absolute subordination to the deity, or withdrawal into another\nworld. My own aims are more modest, so I will take the opposite approach. If\nwe really want to understand the moral grounds of economic life, and by\nextension, human life, it seems to me that we must start instead with the very\nsmall things: the everyday details of social existence, the way we treat our\nfriends, enemies, and children—often with gestures so tiny (passing the salt,\nbumming a cigarette) that we ordinarily never stop to think about them at all.\nAnthropology has shown us just how different and numerous are the ways in\nwhich humans have been known to organize themselves. But it also reveals some\nremarkable commonalities—fundamental moral principles that appear to exist\neverywhere, and that will always tend to be invoked, wherever people transfer\nobjects back and forth or argue about what other people owe them.\n\nOne of the reasons that human life is so complicated, in turn, is because many\nof these principles contradict one another. As we will see, they are\nconstantly pulling us in radically different directions. The moral logic of\nexchange, and hence of debt, is only one; in any given situation, there are\nlikely to be completely different principles that could be brought to bear. In\nthis sense, the moral confusion discussed in the first chapter is hardly new;\nin a sense, moral thought is founded on this very tension.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nTo really understand what debt is, then, it will be necessary to understand\nhow it’s different from other sorts of obligation that human beings might have\nto one another—which, in turn, means mapping out what those other sorts of\nobligation actually are. Doing so, however, poses peculiar challenges.\nContemporary social theory—economic anthropology included—offers surprisingly\nlittle help in this regard. There’s an enormous anthropological literature on\ngifts, for instance, starting with the French anthropologist Marcel Mauss’s\nessay of 1925, even on “gift economies” that operate on completely different\nprinciples than market economies—but in the end, almost all this literature\nconcentrates on the exchange of gifts, assuming that whenever one gives a\ngift, this act incurs a debt, and the recipient must eventually reciprocate in\nkind. Much as in the case of the great religions, the logic of the marketplace\nhas insinuated itself even into the thinking of those who are most explicitly\nopposed to it. As a result, I am going to have to start over here, to create a\nnew theory, pretty much from scratch.\n\nPart of the problem is the extraordinary place that economics currently holds\nin the social sciences. In many ways it is treated as a kind of master\ndiscipline. Just about anyone who runs anything important in America is\nexpected to have some training in economic theory, or at least to be familiar\nwith its basic tenets. As a result, those tenets have come to be treated as\nreceived wisdom, as basically beyond question (one knows one is in the\npresence of received wisdom when, if one challenges it, the first reaction is\nto treat one as simply ignorant—“You obviously have never heard of the Laffer\nCurve”; “Clearly you need a course in Economics 101”—the theory is seen as so\nobviously true that no one who understands it could possibly disagree.) What’s\nmore, those branches of social theory that make the greatest claims to\n“scientific status”—“rational choice theory,” for instance—start from the same\nassumptions about human psychology that economists do: that human beings are\nbest viewed as self-interested actors calculating how to get the best terms\npossible out of any situation, the most profit or pleasure or happiness for\nthe least sacrifice or investment—curious, considering experimental\npsychologists have demonstrated over and over again that these assumptions\nsimply aren’t true.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts002)\n\nFrom early on, there were those who wished to create a theory of social\ninteraction grounded in a more generous view of human nature—insisting that\nmoral life comes down to something more than mutual advantage, that it is\nmotivated above all by a sense of justice. The key term here became\n“reciprocity,” the sense of equity, balance, fairness, and symmetry, embodied\nin our image of justice as a set of scales. Economic transactions were just\none variant of the principle of balanced exchange—and one that had a notorious\ntendency to go awry. But if one examines matters closely, one finds that all\nhuman relations are based on some variation on reciprocity.\n\nIn the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, there was something of a craze for this sort of\nthing, in the guise of what was then called “exchange theory,” developed in\ninfinite variations, from George Homans’ “Social Exchange Theory” in the\nUnited States to Claude Levi-Strauss’s Structuralism in France. Levi-Strauss,\nwho became a kind of intellectual god in anthropology, made the extraordinary\nargument that human life could be imagined as consisting of three spheres:\nlanguage (which consisted of the exchange of words), kinship (which consisted\nof the exchange of women), and economics (which consisted of the exchange of\nthings). All three, he insisted, were governed by the same fundamental law of\nreciprocity.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts003)\n\nLevi-Strauss’s star is fallen now, and such extreme statements seem, in\nretrospect, a little bit ridiculous. Still, it’s not as if anyone has proposed\na bold new theory to replace all this. Instead, the assumptions have simply\nretreated into the background. Almost everyone continues to assume that in its\nfundamental nature, social life is based on the principle of reciprocity, and\ntherefore that all human interaction can best be understood as a kind of\nexchange. If so, then debt really is at the root of all morality, because debt\nis what happens when some balance has not yet been restored.\n\nBut can all justice really be reduced to reciprocity? It’s easy enough to come\nup with forms of reciprocity that don’t seem particularly just. “Do unto\nothers as you would wish others to do unto you” might seem like an excellent\nfoundation for a system of ethics, but for most of us, “an eye for an eye”\ndoes not evoke justice so much as vindictive\nbrutality.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts004) “One good turn\ndeserves another” is a pleasant sentiment, but “I’ll scratch your back, you\nscratch mine” is shorthand for political corruption. Conversely, there are\nrelationships that seem clearly moral but appear to have nothing to do with\nreciprocity. The relation between mother and child is an oft-cited example.\nMost of us learn our sense of justice and morality first from our parents. Yet\nit is extremely difficult to see the relation between parent and child as\nparticularly reciprocal.\n\nWould we really be willing to conclude that therefore it is not a moral\nrelationship? That it has nothing to do with justice?\n\nThe Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood begins a recent book on debt with a\nsimilar paradox:\n\nNature Writer Ernest Thompson Seton had an odd bill presented to him on his\ntwenty-first birthday. It was a record kept by his father of all the expenses\nconnected with young Ernest’s childhood and youth, including the fee charged\nby the doctor for delivering him. Even more oddly, Ernest is said to have paid\nit. I used to think that Mr. Seton Senior was a jerk, but now I’m\nwondering.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts005)\n\nMost of us wouldn’t wonder much. Such behavior seems monstrous, inhuman.\nCertainly Seton did: he paid the bill, but never spoke to his father again\nafterward.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts006) And in a way,\nthis is precisely why the presentation of such a bill seems so outrageous.\nSquaring accounts means that the two parties have the ability to walk away\nfrom each other. By presenting it, his father suggested he’d just as soon have\nnothing further to do with him.\n\nIn other words, while most of us can imagine what we owe to our parents as a\nkind of debt, few of us can imagine being able to actually pay it—or even that\nsuch a debt ever _should_ be paid. Yet if it can’t be paid, in what sense is\nit a “debt” at all? And if it is not a debt, what is it?\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nOne obvious place to look for alternatives is in cases of human interaction in\nwhich expectations of reciprocity seem to slam into a wall. Nineteenth-century\ntravelers’ accounts, for instance, are full of this sort of thing.\nMissionaries working in certain parts of Africa would often be astounded by\nthe reactions they would receive when they administered medicines. Here’s a\ntypical example, from a British missionary in Congo:\n\nA day or two after we reached Vana we found one of the natives very ill with\npneumonia. Comber treated him and kept him alive on strong fowl-soup; a great\ndeal of careful nursing and attention was visited on him, for his house was\nbeside the camp. When we were ready to go on our way again, the man was well.\nTo our astonishment he came and asked us for a present, and was as astonished\nand disgusted as he had made us to be, when we declined giving it. We\nsuggested that it was his place to bring us a present and to show some\ngratitude. He said to us, “Well indeed! You white men have no\nshame!”[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts007)\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century, the French philosopher Lucien\nLevy-Bruhl, in an attempt to prove that “natives” operated with an entirely\ndifferent form of logic, compiled a list of similar stories: for instance, of\na man saved from drowning who proceeded to ask his rescuer to give him some\nnice clothes to wear, or another who, on being nursed back to health after\nhaving been savaged by a tiger, demanded a knife. One French missionary\nworking in Central Africa insisted that such things happened to him on a\nregular basis:\n\nYou save a person’s life, and you must expect to receive a visit from him\nbefore long; you are now under an obligation to him, and you will not get rid\nof him except by giving him\npresents.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts008)\n\nNow, certainly, there is almost always felt to be something extraordinary\nabout saving a life. Anything surrounding birth and death almost cannot help\nbut partake of the infinite, and, therefore, throw all everyday means of moral\ncalculation askew. This is probably why stories like this had become something\nof a cliché in America when I was growing up. I remember as a child several\ntimes being told that among the Inuit (or sometimes it was among Buddhists, or\nChinese, but curiously, never Africans)—that if one saves someone else’s life,\none is considered responsible for taking care of that person forever. It\ndefies our sense of reciprocity. But somehow, it also makes a weird kind of\nsense.\n\nWe have no way of knowing what was really going on in the minds of the\npatients in these stories, since we don’t know who they were or what sort of\nexpectations they had (how they normally interacted with their doctors, for\nexample). But we can guess. Let’s try a thought experiment. Imagine that we\nare dealing with a place where, if one man saved another’s life, the two\nbecame like brothers. Each was now expected to share everything, and to\nprovide for the other when he was in need. If so, the patient would surely\nnotice that his new brother appeared to be extraordinarily wealthy, not in\nmuch need of anything, but that he, the patient, was lacking in many things\nthe missionary could provide.\n\nAlternately (and more likely), imagine that we are dealing not with a\nrelationship of radical equality but the very opposite. In many parts of\nAfrica, accomplished curers were also important political figures with\nextensive clienteles of former patients. A would-be follower thus arrives to\ndeclare his political allegiance. What complicates the matter in this case is\nthat followers of great men, in this part of Africa, were in a relatively\nstrong bargaining position. Good henchmen were hard to come by; important\npeople were expected to be generous with followers to keep them from joining\nsome rival’s entourage instead. If so, asking for a shirt or knife would be a\nway of asking for confirmation that the missionary does wish to have the man\nas a follower. Paying him back, in contrast, would be, like Seton’s gesture to\nhis father, an insult: a way of saying that despite the missionary having\nsaved his life, he would just as soon have nothing further to do with him.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThis is a thought experiment—because we don’t really know what the African\npatients were thinking. The point is that such forms of radical equality and\nradical inequality do exist in the world, that each carries within it its own\nkind of morality, its own way of thinking and arguing about the rights and\nwrongs of any given situation, and these moralities are entirely different\nthan that of tit-for-tat exchange. In the rest of the chapter, I will provide\na rough-and-ready way to map out the main possibilities, by proposing that\nthere are three main moral principles on which economic relations can be\nfounded, all of which occur in any human society, and which I will call\ncommunism, hierarchy, and exchange.\n\n## Communism\n\nI will define communism here as any human relationship that operates on the\nprinciples of “from each according to their abilities, to each according to\ntheir needs.”\n\nI admit that the usage here is a bit provocative. “Communism” is a word that\ncan evoke strong emotional reactions—mainly, of course, because we tend to\nidentify it with “communist” regimes. This is ironic, since the Communist\nparties that ruled over the USSR and its satellites, and that still rule China\nand Cuba, never described their own systems as “communist.” They described\nthem as “socialist.” “Communism” was always a distant, somewhat fuzzy utopian\nideal, usually to be accompanied by the withering away of the state—to be\nachieved at some point in the distant future.\n\nOur thinking about communism has been dominated by a myth. Once upon a time,\nhumans held all things in common—in the Garden of Eden, during the Golden Age\nof Saturn, in Paleolithic hunter-gatherer bands. Then came the Fall, as a\nresult of which we are now cursed with divisions of power and private\nproperty. The dream was that someday, with the advance of technology and\ngeneral prosperity, with social revolution or the guidance of the Party, we\nwould finally be in a position to put things back, to restore common ownership\nand common management of collective resources. Throughout the last two\ncenturies, Communists and anti-Communists argued over how plausible this\npicture was and whether it would be a blessing or a nightmare. But they all\nagreed on the basic framework: communism was about collective property,\n“primitive communism” did once exist in the distant past, and someday it might\nreturn.\n\nWe might call this “mythic communism”—or even, “epic communism”—a story we\nlike to tell ourselves. Since the days of the French Revolution, it has\ninspired millions; but it has also done enormous damage to humanity. It’s high\ntime, I think, to brush the entire argument aside. In fact, “communism” is not\nsome magical utopia, and neither does it have anything to do with ownership of\nthe means of production. It is something that exists right now—that exists, to\nsome degree, in any human society, although there has never been one in which\n_everything_ has been organized in that way, and it would be difficult to\nimagine how there could be. All of us act like communists a good deal of the\ntime. None of us acts like a communist consistently. “Communist society”—in\nthe sense of a society organized exclusively on that single principle—could\nnever exist. But all social systems, even economic systems like capitalism,\nhave always been built on top of a bedrock of actually-existing communism.\n\nStarting, as I say, from the principle of “from each according to their\nabilities, to each according to their needs” allows us to look past the\nquestion of individual or private ownership (which is often little more than\nformal legality anyway) and at much more immediate and practical questions of\nwho has access to what sorts of things and under what\nconditions.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts009) Whenever it is\nthe operative principle, even if it’s just two people who are interacting, we\ncan say we are in the presence of a sort of communism.\n\nAlmost everyone follows this principle if they are collaborating on some\ncommon project.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts010) If someone\nfixing a broken water pipe says, “Hand me the wrench,” his co-worker will not,\ngenerally speaking, say, “And what do I get for it?”—even if they are working\nfor Exxon-Mobil, Burger King, or Goldman Sachs. The reason is simple\nefficiency (ironically enough, considering the conventional wisdom that\n“communism just doesn’t work”): if you really care about getting something\ndone, the most efficient way to go about it is obviously to allocate tasks by\nability and give people whatever they need to do\nthem.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts011) One might even say\nthat it’s one of the scandals of capitalism that most capitalist firms,\ninternally, operate communistically. True, they don’t tend to operate very\ndemocratically. Most often they are organized around military-style top-down\nchains of command. But there is often an interesting tension here, because\ntop-down chains of command are not particularly efficient: they tend to\npromote stupidity among those on top, resentful foot-dragging among those on\nthe bottom. The greater the need to improvise, the more democratic the\ncooperation tends to become. Inventors have always understood this, start-up\ncapitalists frequently figure it out, and computer engineers have recently\nrediscovered the principle: not only with things like freeware, which everyone\ntalks about, but even in the organization of their businesses. Apple Computers\nis a famous example: it was founded by (mostly Republican) computer engineers\nwho broke from IBM in Silicon Valley in the 1980s, forming little democratic\ncircles of twenty to forty people with their laptops in each other’s garages.\n\nThis is presumably also why in the immediate wake of great disasters—a flood,\na blackout, or an economic collapse—people tend to behave the same way,\nreverting to a rough-and-ready communism. However briefly, hierarchies and\nmarkets and the like become luxuries that no one can afford. Anyone who has\nlived through such a moment can speak to their peculiar qualities, the way\nthat strangers become sisters and brothers and human society itself seems to\nbe reborn. This is important, because it shows that we are not simply talking\nabout cooperation. In fact, _communism is the foundation of all human\nsociability_. It is what makes society possible. There is always an assumption\nthat anyone who is not actually an enemy can be expected on the principle of\n“from each according to their abilities,” at least to an extent: for example,\nif one needs to figure out how to get somewhere, and the other knows the way.\n\nWe so take this for granted, in fact, that the exceptions are themselves\nrevealing. E.E. Evans-Pritchard, an anthropologist who in the 1920s carried\nout research among the Nuer, Nilotic pastoralists in southern Sudan, reports\nhis discomfiture when he realized that someone had intentionally given him\nwrong directions:\n\nOn one occasion I asked the way to a certain place and was deliberately\ndeceived. I returned in chagrin to camp and asked the people why they had told\nme the wrong way. One of them replied, “You are a foreigner, why should we\ntell you the right way? Even if a Nuer who was a stranger asked us the way we\nwould say to him, ‘You continue straight along that path,’ but we would not\ntell him that the path forked. Why should we tell him? But you are now a\nmember of our camp and you are kind to our children, so we will tell you the\nright way in future.”[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts012)\n\nThe Nuer are constantly engaged in feuds; any stranger might well turn out to\nbe an enemy there to scout out a good place for an ambush, and it would be\nunwise to give such a person useful information. What’s more, Evans-\nPritchard’s own situation was obviously relevant, since he was an agent of the\nBritish government—the same government that had recently sent in the RAF to\nstrafe and bomb the inhabitants of this very settlement before forcibly\nresettling them there. Under the circumstances, the inhabitants’ treatment of\nEvans-Pritchard seems quite generous. The main point, though, is that it\nrequires something on this scale—an immediate threat to life and limb, terror-\nbombing of civilian populations—before people will ordinarily consider not\ngiving a stranger accurate\ndirections.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts013)\n\nIt’s not just directions. Conversation is a domain particularly disposed to\ncommunism. Lies, insults, put-downs, and other sorts of verbal aggression are\nimportant—but they derive most of their power from the shared assumption that\npeople do not ordinarily act this way: an insult does not sting unless one\nassumes that others will normally be considerate of one’s feelings, and it’s\nimpossible to lie to someone who does not assume you would ordinarily tell the\ntruth. When we genuinely wish to break off amicable relations with someone, we\nstop speaking to them entirely.\n\nThe same goes for small courtesies like asking for a light, or even for a\ncigarette. It seems more legitimate to ask a stranger for a cigarette than for\nan equivalent amount of cash, or even food; in fact, if one has been\nidentified as a fellow smoker, it’s rather difficult to refuse such a request.\nIn such cases—a match, a piece of information, holding the elevator—one might\nsay the “from each” element is so minimal that most of us comply without even\nthinking about it. Conversely, the same is true if another person’s need—even\na stranger’s—is particularly spectacular or extreme: if he is drowning, for\nexample. If a child has fallen onto the subway tracks, we assume that anyone\nwho is capable of helping her up will do so.\n\nI will call this “baseline communism”: the understanding that, unless people\nconsider themselves enemies, if the need is considered great enough, or the\ncost considered reasonable enough, the principle of “from each according to\ntheir abilities, to each according to their needs” will be assumed to apply.\nOf course, different communities apply very different standards. In large,\nimpersonal urban communities, such a standard may go no further than asking\nfor a light or directions. This might not seem like much, but it founds the\npossibility of larger social relations. In smaller, less impersonal\ncommunities—especially those not divided into social classes—the same logic\nwill likely extend much further: for example, it is often effectively\nimpossible to refuse a request not just for tobacco, but for food—sometimes\neven from a stranger; certainly from anyone considered to belong to the\ncommunity. Exactly one page after describing his difficulties in asking for\ndirections, Evans-Pritchard notes that these same Nuer find it almost\nimpossible, when dealing with someone they have accepted as a member of their\ncamp, to refuse a request for almost any item of common consumption, so that a\nman or woman known to have anything extra in the way of grain, tobacco, tools,\nor agricultural implements can be expected to see their stockpiles disappear\nalmost immediately.[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts014)\nHowever, this baseline of openhanded sharing and generosity never extends to\neverything. Often, in fact, things freely shared are treated as trivial and\nunimportant for that very reason. Among the Nuer, true wealth takes the form\nof cattle. No one would freely share their cattle; in fact, young Nuer men\nlearn that they are expected to defend their cattle with their lives; for this\nreason, cattle are neither bought nor sold.\n\nThe obligation to share food, and whatever else is considered a basic\nnecessity, tends to become the basis of everyday morality in a society whose\nmembers see themselves as equals. Another anthropologist, Audrey Richards,\nonce described how Bemba mothers, “such lax disciplinarians in everything\nelse,” will scold their children harshly if they give one an orange or some\nother treat and the child does not immediately offer to share it with her\nfriends.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts015) But sharing is\nalso, in such societies—in any, if we really think about it—a major focus of\nlife’s pleasures. As a result, the need to share is particularly acute in both\nthe best of times and the worst of times: during famines, for example, but\nalso during moments of extreme plenty. Early missionary accounts of native\nNorth Americans almost invariably include awestruck remarks on generosity in\ntimes of famine, often to total\nstrangers.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts016) At the same\ntime,\n\nOn returning from their fishing, their hunting, and their trading, they\nexchange many gifts; if they have thus obtained something unusually good, even\nif they have bought it, or if it has been given to them, they make a feast to\nthe whole village with it. Their hospitality towards all sorts of strangers is\nremarkable.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts017)\n\nThe more elaborate the feast, the more likely one is to see some combination\nof free sharing of some things (for instance, food and drink) and careful\ndistribution of others: say, prize meat, whether from game or sacrifice, which\nis often parceled out according to very elaborate protocols or equally\nelaborate gift exchange. The giving and taking of gifts often takes on a\ndistinctly gamelike quality, continuous often with the actual games, contests,\npageants, and performances that also often mark popular festivals. As with\nsociety at large, the shared conviviality could be seen as a kind of\ncommunistic base on top of which everything else is constructed. It also helps\nto emphasize that sharing is not simply about morality, but also about\npleasure. Solitary pleasures will always exist, but for most human beings, the\nmost pleasurable activities almost always involve sharing something: music,\nfood, liquor, drugs, gossip, drama, beds. There is a certain communism of the\nsenses at the root of most things we consider fun.\n\nThe surest way to know that one is in the presence of communistic relations is\nthat not only are no accounts taken, but it would be considered offensive, or\nsimply bizarre, to even consider doing so. Each village, clan, or nation\nwithin the League of the Hodenosaunee, or Iroquois, for example, was divided\ninto two halves.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts018) This is a\ncommon pattern: in other parts of the world (Amazonia, Melanesia) too, there\nare arrangements in which members of one side can only marry someone from the\nother side, or only eat food grown on the other side; such rules are\nexplicitly designed to make each side dependent on the other for some basic\nnecessity of life. Among the Six Iroquois, each side was expected to bury the\nother’s dead. Nothing would be more absurd than for one side to complain that,\n“last year, we buried five of your dead, but you only buried two of ours.”\n\nBaseline communism might be considered the raw material of sociality, a\nrecognition of our ultimate interdependence that is the ultimate substance of\nsocial peace. Still, in most circumstances, that minimal baseline is not\nenough. One always behaves in a spirit of solidarity more with some people\nthan others, and certain institutions are specifically based on principles of\nsolidarity and mutual aid. First among these are those we love, with mothers\nbeing the paradigm of selfless love. Others include close relatives, wives and\nhusbands, lovers, one’s closest friends. These are the people with whom we\nshare everything, or at least to whom we know we can turn in need, which is\nthe definition of a true friend everywhere. Such friendships may be formalized\nby a ritual as “bond-friends” or “blood brothers” who cannot refuse each other\nanything. As a result, any community could be seen as criss-crossed with\nrelations of “individualistic communism,” one-to-one relations that operate,\nto varying intensities and degrees, on the basis of “from each according to\ntheir ability, to each according to their\nneeds.”[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts019)\n\nThis same logic can be, and is, extended within groups: not only cooperative\nwork groups, but almost any in-group will define itself by creating its own\nsort of baseline communism. There will be certain things shared or made freely\navailable within the group, others that anyone will be expected to provide for\nother members on request, that one would never share with or provide to\noutsiders: help in repairing one’s nets in an association of fisherman,\nstationery supplies in an office, certain sorts of information among commodity\ntraders, and so forth. Also, certain categories of people we can always call\non in certain situations, such as harvesting or moving\nhouse.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts020) One could go on from\nhere to various forms of sharing, pooling, who gets to call on whom for help\nwith certain tasks: moving, or harvesting, or even, if one is in trouble,\nproviding an interest-free loan. Finally, there are the different sorts of\n“commons,” the collective administration of common resources.\n\nThe sociology of everyday communism is a potentially enormous field, but one\nwhich, owing to our peculiar ideological blinkers, we have been unable to\nwrite about because we have been largely unable to see it. Rather than try to\nfurther outline it, I will limit myself to three final points.\n\nFirst, we are not really dealing with reciprocity here—or at best, only with\nreciprocity in the broadest\nsense.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts021) What is equal on\nboth sides is the knowledge that the other person _would_ do the same for you,\nnot that they necessarily _will_. The Iroquois example brings home clearly\nwhat makes this possible: that such relations are based on a presumption of\neternity. Society will always exist. Therefore, there will always be a north\nand a south side of the village. This is why no accounts need be taken. In a\nsimilar way, people tend to treat their mothers and best friends as if they\nwill always exist, however well they know it isn’t true.\n\nThe second point has to do with the famous “law of hospitality.” There is a\npeculiar tension between a common stereotype of what are called “primitive\nsocieties” (people lacking both states and markets) as societies in which\nanyone not a member of the community is assumed to be an enemy, and the\nfrequent accounts of early European travelers awestruck by the extraordinary\ngenerosity shown them by actual “savages.” Granted, there is a certain truth\nto both sides. Wherever a stranger is a dangerous potential enemy, the normal\nway to overcome the danger is by some dramatic gesture of generosity whose\nvery magnificence catapults them into that mutual sociality that is the ground\nfor all peaceful social relations. True, when one is dealing with completely\nunknown quantities, there is often a process of testing. Both Christopher\nColumbus, in Hispaniola, and Captain Cook, in Polynesia, reported similar\nstories of islanders who either flee, attack, or offer everything—but who\noften later enter the boats and help themselves to anything they take a fancy\nto, provoking threats of violence from the crew, who then did their utmost to\nestablish the principle that relations between strange peoples should be\nmediated instead by “normal” commercial exchange.\n\nIt’s understandable that dealings with potentially hostile strangers should\nencourage an all-or-nothing logic, a tension preserved even in English in the\netymology of the words “host,” “hostile,” “hostage,” and indeed “hospitality,”\nall of which are derived from the same Latin\nroot.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts022) What I want to\nemphasize here is that all such gestures are simply exaggerated displays of\nthat very “baseline communism” that I have already argued is the ground of all\nhuman social life. This is why, for instance, the difference between friends\nand enemies is so often articulated through food—and often the most\ncommonplace, humble, domestic sorts of food: as in the familiar principle,\ncommon in both Europe and the Middle East, that those who have shared bread\nand salt must never harm one another. In fact, those things that exist above\nall to be shared often become those things one _cannot_ share with enemies.\nAmong the Nuer, so free with food and everyday possessions, if one man murders\nanother, a blood feud follows. Everyone in the vicinity will often have to\nline up on one side or another, and those on opposite sides are strictly\nforbidden to eat with anyone on the other, or even to drink from a cup or bowl\none of their newfound enemies has previously used, lest terrible results\nensue.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts023) The extraordinary\ninconvenience this creates is a major incentive to try to negotiate some sort\nof settlement. By the same token, it is often said that people who have shared\nfood, or the right, archetypal kind of food, are forbidden to harm one\nanother, however much they might be otherwise inclined to do so. At times,\nthis can take on an almost comical formality, as in the Arab story of the\nburglar who, while ransacking someone’s house, stuck his finger in a jar to\nsee if it was full of sugar, only to discover it was full of salt instead.\nRealizing that he had now eaten salt at the owner’s table, he dutifully put\nback everything he’d stolen.\n\nFinally, once we start thinking of communism as a principle of morality rather\nthan just a question of property ownership, it becomes clear that this sort of\nmorality is almost always at play to some degree in any transaction—even\ncommerce. If one is on sociable terms with someone, it’s hard to completely\nignore their situation. Merchants often reduce prices for the needy. This is\none of the main reasons why shopkeepers in poor neighborhoods are almost never\nof the same ethnic group as their customers; it would be almost impossible for\na merchant who grew up in the neighborhood to make money, as they would be\nunder constant pressure to give financial breaks, or at least easy credit\nterms, to their impoverished relatives and school chums. The opposite is true\nas well. An anthropologist who lived for some time in rural Java once told me\nthat she measured her linguistic abilities by how well she could bargain at\nthe local bazaar. It frustrated her that she could never get it down to a\nprice as low as local people seemed pay. “Well,” a Javanese friend finally had\nto explain, “they charge rich Javanese people more, too.”\n\nOnce again, we are back to the principle that if the needs (for instance, dire\npoverty), or the abilities (for instance, wealth beyond imagination), are\nsufficiently dramatic, then unless there is a complete absence of sociality,\nsome degree of communistic morality will almost inevitably enter into the way\npeople take accounts.[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts024) A\nTurkish folktale about the Medieval Sufi mystic Nasruddin Hodja illustrates\nthe complexities thus introduced into the very concept of supply and demand:\n\nOne day when Nasruddin was left in charge of the local teahouse, the king and\nsome retainers, who had been hunting nearby, stopped in for breakfast.\n\n“Do you have quail eggs?” asked the king.\n\n“I’m sure I can find some,” answered Nasruddin.\n\nThe king ordered an omelet of a dozen quail eggs, and Nasruddin hurried out to\nlook for them. After the king and his party had eaten, he charged them a\nhundred gold pieces.\n\nThe king was puzzled. “Are quail eggs really that rare in this part of the\ncountry?”\n\n“It’s not so much quail eggs that are rare around here,” Nasruddin replied.\n“It’s more visits from kings.”\n\n## Exchange\n\nCommunism, then, is based neither in exchange nor in reciprocity—except, as I\nhave observed, in the sense that it does involve mutual expectations and\nresponsibilities. Even here, it seems better to use another word\n(“mutuality”?) so as to emphasize that exchange operates on entirely different\nprinciples; that it’s a fundamentally different kind of moral logic.\n\nExchange is all about equivalence. It’s a back-and-forth process involving two\nsides in which each side gives as good as it gets. This is why one can speak\nof people exchanging words (if there’s an argument), blows, or even\ngunfire.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts025) In these examples,\nit’s not that there is ever an exact equivalence—even if there were some way\nto measure an exact equivalence—but more a constant process of interaction\ntending toward equivalence. Actually, there’s something of a paradox here:\neach side in each case is trying to outdo the other, but, unless one side is\nutterly put to rout, it’s easiest to break the whole thing off when both\nconsider the outcome to be more or less even. When we move to the exchange of\nmaterial goods, we find a similar tension. Often there is an element of\ncompetition; if nothing else, there’s always that possibility. But at the same\ntime, there’s a sense that both sides are keeping accounts, and that, unlike\nwhat happens in communism, which always partakes of a certain notion of\neternity, the entire relationship can be canceled out, and either party can\ncall an end to it at any time.\n\nThis element of competition can work in completely different ways. In cases of\nbarter or commercial exchange, when both parties to the transaction are only\ninterested in the value of goods being transacted, they may well—as economists\ninsist they should—try to seek the maximum material advantage. On the other\nhand, as anthropologists have long pointed out, when the exchange is of gifts,\nthat is, the objects passing back and forth are mainly considered interesting\nin how they reflect on and rearrange relations between the people carrying out\nthe transaction, then insofar as competition enters in, it is likely to work\nprecisely the other way around—to become a matter of contests of generosity,\nof people showing off who can give more away.\n\nLet me take these one at a time.\n\nWhat marks commercial exchange is that it’s “impersonal”: who it is that is\nselling something to us, or buying something from us, should in principle be\nentirely irrelevant. We are simply comparing the value or two objects. True,\nas with any principle, in practice, this is rarely completely true. There has\nto be some minimal element of trust for a transaction to be carried out at\nall, and, unless one is dealing with a vending machine, that usually requires\nsome outward display of sociality. Even in the most impersonal shopping mall\nor supermarket, clerks are expected to at least simulate personal warmth,\npatience, and other reassuring qualities; in a Middle-Eastern bazaar, one\nmight have to go through an elaborate process of establishing a simulated\nfriendship, sharing tea, food, or tobacco, before engaging in similarly\nelaborate haggling—an interesting ritual that begins by establishing sociality\nthrough baseline communism—and continues with an often prolonged mock battle\nover prices. It’s all done on the basis of the assumption that buyer and\nseller are, at least at that moment, friends (and thus each entitled to feel\noutraged and indignant at the other’s unreasonable demands), but it’s all a\nlittle piece of theater. Once the object changes hands, there is no\nexpectation that the two will ever have anything to do with each other\nagain.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts026)\n\nMost often this sort of haggling—in Madagascar the term for it literally means\n“to battle out a sale” _(miady varotra)_ —can be a source of pleasure in\nitself.\n\nThe first time I visited Analakely, the great cloth market in Madagascar’s\ncapital, I came with a Malagasy friend intent on buying a sweater. The whole\nprocess took about four hours. It went something like this: my friend would\nspot a likely sweater hanging in some booth, ask the price, and then she would\nbegin a prolonged battle of wits with the vendor, invariably involving\ndramatic displays of insult and indignation, and simulated walkings off in\ndisgust. Often it seemed ninety percent of the argument was spent on a final,\ntiny difference of a few ariary—literally, pennies—that seemed to become a\nprofound matter of principle on either side, since a merchant’s failure to\nconcede it could sink the entire deal.\n\nThe second time I visited Analakely I went with another friend, also a young\nwoman, who had a list of measures of cloth to buy supplied by her sister. At\neach booth she adopted the same procedure: she simply walked up and asked for\nthe price.\n\nThe man would quote her one.\n\n“All right,” she then asked, “and what’s your real final price?”\n\nHe’d tell her, and she’d hand over the money.\n\n“Wait a minute!” I asked. “You can _do_ that?\n\n“Sure,” she said. “Why not?”\n\nI explained what had happened with my last friend.\n\n“Oh, yeah,” she said. “Some people enjoy that sort of thing.”\n\nExchange allows us to cancel out our debts. It gives us a way to call it even:\nhence, to end the relationship. With vendors, one is usually only pretending\nto have a relationship at all. With neighbors, one might for this very reason\nprefer _not_ to pay one’s debts. Laura Bohannan writes about arriving in a Tiv\ncommunity in rural Nigeria; neighbors immediately began arriving bearing\nlittle gifts: “two ears corn, one vegetable marrow, one chicken, five\ntomatoes, one handful\npeanuts.”[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts027) Having no idea\nwhat was expected of her, she thanked them and wrote down in a notebook their\nnames and what they had brought. Eventually, two women adopted her and\nexplained that all such gifts did have to be returned. It would be entirely\ninappropriate to simply accept three eggs from a neighbor and never bring\nanything back. One did not have to bring back eggs, but one should bring\nsomething back of approximately the same value. One could even bring\nmoney—there was nothing inappropriate in that—provided one did so at a\ndiscreet interval, and above all, that one did not bring the exact cost of the\neggs. It had to be either a bit more or a bit less. To bring back nothing at\nall would be to cast oneself as an exploiter or a parasite. To bring back an\nexact equivalent would be to suggest that one no longer wishes to have\nanything to do with the neighbor. Tiv women, she learned, might spend a good\npart of the day walking for miles to distant homesteads to return a handful of\nokra or a tiny bit of change, “in an endless circle of gifts to which no one\never handed over the precise value of the object last received”—and in doing\nso, they were continually creating their society. There was certainly a trace\nof communism here—neighbors on good terms could also be trusted to help each\nother out in emergencies—but unlike communistic relations, which are assumed\nto be permanent, this sort of neighborliness had to be constantly created and\nmaintained, because any link can be broken off at any time.\n\nThere are endless variations on this sort of tit-for-tat, or almost tit-for-\ntat, gift exchange. The most familiar is the exchange of presents: I buy\nsomeone a beer; they buy me the next one. Perfect equivalence implies\nequality. But consider a slightly more complicated example: I take a friend\nout to a fancy restaurant for dinner; after a discreet interval, they do the\nsame. As anthropologists have long been in the habit of pointing out, the very\nexistence of such customs—especially, the feeling that one really _ought_ to\nreturn the favor—can’t be explained by standard economic theory, which assumes\nthat any human interaction is ultimately a business deal and that we are all\nself-interested individuals trying to get the most for ourselves for the least\ncost or least amount of\neffort.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts028) But this feeling is\nquite real, and it can cause genuine strain for those of limited means trying\nto keep up appearances. So: Why, if I took a free-market economic theorist out\nto an expensive dinner, would that economist feel somewhat\ndiminished—uncomfortably in my debt—until he had been able to return the\nfavor? Why, if he were feeling competitive with me, would he be inclined to\ntake me to someplace even more expensive?\n\nRecall the feasts and festivals alluded to above: here, too, there is a base\nof conviviality and playful (sometimes not so playful) competition. On the one\nhand, everyone’s pleasure is enhanced—after all, how many people would really\nwant to eat a superb meal at a French restaurant all alone? On the other,\nthings can easily slip into games of one-upmanship—and hence obsession,\nhumiliation, rage … or, as we’ll soon see, even worse. In some societies,\nthese games are formalized, but it’s important to stress that such games only\nreally develop between people or groups who perceive themselves to be more or\nless equivalent in status.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts029)\nTo return to our imaginary economist: it’s not clear that he would feel\ndiminished if he received a present, or was taken out to dinner, by just\nanyone. He would be most likely to feel this way if the benefactor were\nsomeone he felt was of roughly equivalent status or dignity: a colleague, for\nexample. If Bill Gates or George Soros took him out to dinner, he would likely\nconclude that he had indeed received something for nothing and leave it at\nthat. If some ingratiating junior colleague or eager graduate student did the\nsame, he’d be likely to conclude that he was doing the man a favor just by\naccepting the invitation—if indeed he did accept, which he probably wouldn’t.\n\nThis, too, appears to be the case wherever we find society divided into fine\ngradations of status and dignity. Pierre Bourdieu has described the “dialectic\nof challenge and riposte” that governs all games of honor among Kabyle Berber\nmen in Algeria, in which the exchange of insults, attacks (in feud or\nbattles), thefts, or threats was seen to follow exactly the same logic as the\nexchange of gifts.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts030) To give\na gift is both an honor and a provocation. To respond to one requires infinite\nartistry. Timing is all-important. So is making the counter-gift just\ndifferent enough, but also just slightly grander. Above all is the tacit moral\nprinciple that one must always pick on someone one’s own size. To challenge\nsomeone obviously older, richer, and more honorable is to risk being snubbed,\nand hence humiliated; to overwhelm a poor but respectable man with a gift he\ncouldn’t possibly pay back is simply cruel, and will do equal damage to your\nreputation. There’s an Indonesian story about that too: about a rich man who\nsacrificed a magnificent ox to shame a penurious rival; the poor man utterly\nhumiliated him, and won the contest, by calmly proceeding to sacrifice a\nchicken.[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts031)\n\nGames like this become especially elaborate when status is to some degree up\nfor grabs. When matters are _too_ clear-cut, that introduces its own sorts of\nproblems. Giving gifts to kings is often a particularly tricky and complicated\nbusiness. The problem here is that one cannot really give a gift fit for a\nking (unless, perhaps, one is another king), since kings by definition already\nhave everything. On the one hand, one is expected to make a reasonable effort:\n\nNasruddin was once called up to visit the king. A neighbor saw him hurrying\nalong the road carrying a bag of turnips.\n\n“What are those for?” he asked.\n\n“I’ve been called to see the king. I thought it would be best to bring some\nkind of present.”\n\n“You’re bringing him turnips? But turnips are peasant food! He’s a king! You\nshould bring him something more appropriate, like grapes.”\n\nNasruddin agreed, and came to the king carrying a bunch of grapes. The king\nwas not amused. “You’re giving me grapes? But I’m a king! This is ridiculous.\nTake this idiot out and teach him some manners! Throw each and every one of\nthe grapes at him and then kick him out of the palace.”\n\nThe emperor’s guards dragged Nasruddin into a side room and began pelting him\nwith grapes. As they did so, he fell on his knees and began crying, “Thank\nyou, thank you God, for your infinite mercy!”\n\n“Why are you thanking God?” they asked. “You’re being totally humiliated!”\n\nNasruddin replied, “Oh, I was just thinking, ‘Thank God I didn’t bring the\nturnips!’ ”\n\nOn the other hand, to give something that a king does not already have can get\nyou in even greater trouble. One story circulating in the early Roman Empire\nconcerned an inventor who, with great fanfare, presented a glass bowl as a\ngift to the emperor Tiberius. The emperor was puzzled: What was so impressive\nabout a piece of glass? The man dropped it on the ground. Rather than\nshattering, it merely dented. He picked it up and simply pushed it back into\nits former shape.\n\n“Did you tell anyone else how you made this thing?” asked a startled Tiberius.\n\nThe inventor assured him that he had not. The emperor therefore ordered him\nkilled, since, if word of how to make unbreakable glass got out, his treasury\nof gold and silver would soon be\nworthless.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts032)\n\nThe best bet when dealing with kings was to make a reasonable effort to play\nthe game, but one that is still bound to fail. The fourteenth-century Arab\ntraveler Ibn Battuta tells of the customs of the King of Sind, a terrifying\nmonarch who took a particular delight in displays of arbitrary\npower.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts033) It was customary for\nforeign worthies visiting the king to present him with magnificent presents;\nwhatever the gift was, he would invariably respond by presenting the bearer\nwith something many times its value. As a result, a substantial business\ndeveloped where local bankers would lend money to such visitors to finance\nparticularly spectacular gifts, knowing they could be well repaid from the\nproceeds of royal one-upmanship. The king must have known about this. He\ndidn’t object—since the whole point was to show that his wealth exceeded all\npossible equivalence—and if he really needed to, he could always expropriate\nthe bankers. They knew that the really important game was not economic, but\none of status, and his was absolute.\n\nIn exchange, the objects being traded are seen as equivalent. Therefore, by\nimplication, so are the people: at least, at the moment when gift is met with\ncounter-gift, or money changes hands; when there is no further debt or\nobligation and each of the two parties is equally free to walk away. This in\nturn implies autonomy. Both principles sit uncomfortably with monarchs, which\nis the reason that kings generally dislike any sort of\nexchange.[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts034) But within that\noverhanging prospect of potential cancellation, of ultimate equivalence, we\nfind endless variations, endless games one can play. One can demand something\nfrom another person, knowing that by doing so, one is giving the other the\nright to demand something of equivalent value in return. In some contexts,\neven praising another’s possession might be interpreted as a demand of this\nsort. In eighteenth-century New Zealand, English settlers soon learned that it\nwas not a good idea to admire, say, a particularly beautiful jade pendant worn\naround the neck of a Maori warrior; the latter would inevitably insist on\ngiving it, not take no for an answer, and then, after a discreet interval,\nreturn to praise the settler’s coat or gun. The only way to head this off was\nto quickly give him a gift before he could ask for one. Sometimes gifts are\noffered in order for the giver to be able to make such a demand: if one\naccepts the present, one is tacitly agreeing to allow the giver to claim\nwhatever he deems\nequivalent.[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts035)\n\nAll this, in turn, can shade into something very much like barter, directly\nswapping one thing for another—which as we’ve seen does occur even in what\nMarcel Mauss liked to refer to as “gift economies,” even if largely between\nstrangers.[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts036) Within\ncommunities, there is almost always a reluctance, as the Tiv example so nicely\nillustrates, to allow things to cancel out—one reason that if there is money\nin common usage, people will often either refuse to use it with friends or\nrelatives (which in a village society includes pretty much everyone), or\nalternately, like the Malagasy villagers in [chapter\n3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c03_r1.htm), use it in radically different ways.\n\n## Hierarchy\n\nExchange, then, implies formal equality—or at least, the potential for it.\nThis is precisely why kings have such trouble with it.\n\nIn contrast, relations of explicit hierarchy—that is, relations between at\nleast two parties in which one is considered superior to the other—do not tend\nto operate by reciprocity at all. It’s hard to see because the relation is\noften justified in reciprocal terms (“the peasants provide food, the lords\nprovide protection”), but the principle by which they operate is exactly the\nopposite. In practice, hierarchy tends to work by a logic of precedent.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean by this, let us imagine a kind of continuum of one-\nsided social relations, ranging from the most exploitative to the most\nbenevolent. At one extreme is theft, or plunder; on the other selfless\ncharity.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts037) Only at these two\nextremes is it is possible to have material interactions between people who\notherwise have no social relation of any kind. Only a lunatic would mug his\nnext-door neighbor. A band of marauding soldiers or nomadic horsemen falling\non a peasant hamlet to rape and pillage also obviously have no intention of\nforming any ongoing relations with the survivors. But in a similar way,\nreligious traditions often insist that the only true charity is anonymous—in\nother words, not meant to place the recipient in one’s debt. One extreme form\nof this, documented in various parts of the world, is the gift by stealth, in\na kind of reverse burglary: to literally sneak into the recipient’s house at\nnight and plant one’s present so no one can know for sure who has left it. The\nfigure of Santa Claus, or Saint Nicholas (who, it must be remembered, was not\njust the patron saint of children, but also the patron saint of thieves) would\nappear to be the mythological version of the same principle: a benevolent\nburglar with whom no social relations are possible and therefore to whom no\none could possibly owe anything, in his case, above all, because he does not\nactually exist.\n\nObserve, however, what happens when one moves just a little bit less far out\non the continuum in either direction. I have been told (I suspect it isn’t\ntrue) that in parts of Belarus, gangs prey so systematically on travelers on\ntrains and busses that they have developed the habit of giving each victim a\nlittle token, to confirm that the bearer has already been robbed. Obviously\none step toward the creation of a state. Actually, one popular theory of the\norigins of the state, that goes back at least to the fourteenth-century North\nAfrican historian Ibn Khaldun, runs precisely along these lines: nomadic\nraiders eventually systematize their relations with sedentary villagers;\npillage turns into tribute, rape turns into the “right of the first night” or\nthe carrying off of likely candidates as recruits for the royal harem.\nConquest, untrammeled force, becomes systematized, and thus framed not as a\npredatory relation but as a moral one, with the lords providing protection,\nand the villagers, their sustenance. But even if all parties assume they are\noperating by a shared moral code, that even kings cannot do whatever they want\nbut must operate within limits, allowing peasants to argue about the rights\nand wrongs of just how much of their harvest a king’s retainers are entitled\nto carry off, they are very unlikely to frame their calculation in terms of\nthe quality or quantity of protection provided, but rather in terms of custom\nand precedent: How much did we pay last year? How much did our ancestors have\nto pay? The same is true on the other side. If charitable donations become the\nbasis for any sort of social relation, it will not be one based on\nreciprocity. If you give some coins to a panhandler, and that panhandler\nrecognizes you later, it is unlikely that he will give you any money—but he\nmight well consider you more likely to give him money again. Certainly this is\ntrue if one donates money to a charitable organization. (I gave money to the\nUnited Farm Workers once and I still haven’t heard the end of it.) Such an act\nof one-sided generosity is treated as a precedent for what will be expected\nafterward.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts038) It’s quite the\nsame if one gives candy to a child.\n\nThis is what I mean when I say that hierarchy operates by a principle that is\nthe very opposite of reciprocity. Whenever the lines of superiority and\ninferiority are clearly drawn and accepted by all parties as the framework of\na relationship, and relations are sufficiently ongoing that we are no longer\nsimply dealing with arbitrary force, then relations will be seen as being\nregulated by a web of habit or custom. Sometimes the situation is assumed to\nhave originated in some founding act of conquest. Or it might been seen as\nancestral custom for which there is no need of explanation. But this\nintroduces another complication to the problem of giving gifts to kings—or to\nany superior: there is always the danger that it will be treated as a\nprecedent, added to the web of custom, and therefore considered obligatory\nthereafter. Xenophon claims that in the early days of the Persian Empire, each\nprovince vied to send the Great King gifts of its most unique and valuable\nproducts. This became the basis of the tribute system: each province was\neventually expected to provide the same “gifts” every\nyear.[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts039) Similarly, according\nto the great Medieval historian Marc Bloch:\n\n[I]n the ninth century, when one day there was a shortage of wine in the royal\ncellars at Ver, the monks of Saint-Denis were asked to supply the two hundred\nhogs-heads required. This contribution was thenceforth claimed from them as of\nright every year, and it required an imperial charter to abolish it. At\nArdres, we are told, there was once a bear, the property of the local lord.\nThe inhabitants, who loved to watch it fight with dogs, undertook to feed it.\nThe beast eventually died, but the lord continued to exact the loaves of\nbread.”[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts040)\n\nIn other words, any gift to a feudal superior, “especially if repeated three\nof four times,” was likely to be treated as a precedent and added to the web\nof custom. As a result, those giving gifts to superiors often insisted on\nreceiving a “letter of non-prejudice” legally stipulating that such a gift\nwould not be required in the future. While it is unusual for matters to become\nquite so formalized, any social relation that is assumed from the start to be\nunequal will inevitably begin to operate on an analogous logic—if only\nbecause, once relations are seen as based on “custom,” the only way to\ndemonstrate that one has a duty or obligation to do something is to show that\none has done it before.\n\nOften, such arrangements can turn into a logic of caste: certain clans are\nresponsible for weaving the ceremonial garments, or bringing the fish for\nroyal feasts, or cutting the king’s hair. They thus come to be known as\nweavers or fishermen or\nbarbers.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts041) This last point\ncan’t be overemphasized because it brings home another truth regularly\noverlooked: that the logic of identity is, always and everywhere, entangled in\nthe logic of hierarchy. It is only when certain people are placed above\nothers, or where everyone is being ranked in relation to the king, or the high\npriest, or Founding Fathers, that one begins to speak of people bound by their\nessential nature: about fundamentally different kinds of human being.\nIdeologies of caste or race are just extreme examples. It happens whenever one\ngroup is seen as raising themselves above others, or placing themselves below\nothers, in such a way that ordinary standards of fair dealing no longer apply.\n\nIn fact, something like this happens in a small way even in our most intimate\nsocial relations. The moment we recognize someone as a different _sort_ of\nperson, either above or below us, then ordinary rules of reciprocity become\nmodified or are set aside. If a friend is unusually generous once, we will\nlikely wish to reciprocate. If she acts this way repeatedly, we conclude she\nis a generous person, and are hence less likely to\nreciprocate.[42](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts042)\n\nWe can describe a simple formula here: a certain action, repeated, becomes\ncustomary; as a result, it comes to define the actor’s essential nature.\nAlternately, a person’s nature may be defined by how others have acted toward\nhim in the past. To be an aristocrat is largely to insist that in the past,\nothers have _treated_ you as an aristocrat (since aristocrats don’t really do\nanything in particular, most spend their time simply existing in some sort of\nputatively superior state), and therefore should continue to do so. Much of\nthe art of being such a person is that of treating oneself in such a manner\nthat it conveys how you expect others to treat you: in the case of actual\nkings, covering oneself with gold so as to suggest that others do likewise. On\nthe other end of the scale, this is also how abuse becomes self-legitimating.\nAs a former student of mine, Sarah Stillman, pointed out: in the United\nStates, if a middle-class thirteen-year-old girl is kidnapped, raped, and\nkilled, it is considered an agonizing national crisis that everyone with a\ntelevision is expected to follow for several weeks. If a thirteen-year-old\ngirl is turned out as a child prostitute, raped systematically for years, and\nultimately killed, all this is considered unremarkable—really just the sort of\nthing one can expect to end up happening to someone like\nthat.[43](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts043)\n\nWhen objects of material wealth pass back and forth between superiors and\ninferiors as gifts or payments, the key principle seems to be that the sorts\nof things given on each side should be considered fundamentally different in\nquality, their relative value impossible to quantify—the result being that\nthere is no way to even conceive of a squaring of accounts. Even if Medieval\nwriters insisted on imagining society as a hierarchy in which priests pray for\neveryone, nobles fight for everyone, and peasants feed everyone, it never even\noccurred to anyone to establish how many prayers or how much military\nprotection was equivalent to a ton of wheat. Nor did anyone ever consider\nmaking such a calculation. Neither is it that “lowly” sorts of people are\nnecessarily given lowly sorts of things and vice versa. Sometimes it is quite\nthe opposite. Until recently, just about any notable philosopher, artist,\npoet, or musician was required to find a wealthy patron for support. Famous\nworks of poetry or philosophy are often prefaced—oddly, to the modern eye—with\ngushing, sycophantic praise for the wisdom and virtue of some long-forgotten\nearl or count who provided a meager stipend. The fact that the noble patron\nmerely provided room and board, or money, and that the client showed his\ngratitude by painting the _Mona Lisa_ , or composing the _Toccata and Fugue in\nD Minor_ , was in no way seen to compromise the assumption of the noble’s\nintrinsic superiority.\n\nThere is one great exception to this principle, and that is the phenomenon of\nhierarchical redistribution. Here, though, rather than giving back and forth\nthe same sorts of things, they give back and forth _exactly_ the same thing:\nas, for instance, when fans of certain Nigerian pop stars throw money onto the\nstage during concerts, and the pop stars in question make occasional tours of\ntheir fans’ neighborhoods tossing (the same) money from the windows of their\nlimos. When this is all that’s going on, we may speak of an absolutely minimal\nsort of hierarchy. In much of Papua New Guinea, social life centers on “big\nmen,” charismatic individuals who spend much of their time coaxing, cajoling,\nand manipulating in order to acquire masses of wealth to give away again at\nsome great feast. One could, in practice, pass from here to, say, an Amazonian\nor indigenous North American chief. Unlike big men, their role is more\nformalized; but actually such chiefs have no power to compel anyone to do\nanything they don’t want to (hence North American Indian chiefs’ famous skill\nat oratory and powers of persuasion). As a result, they tended to give away\nfar more than they received. Observers often remarked that in terms of\npersonal possessions, a village chief was often the poorest man in the\nvillage, such was the pressure on him for constant supply of largesse.\n\nIndeed, one could judge how egalitarian a society really was by exactly this:\nwhether those ostensibly in positions of authority are merely conduits for\nredistribution, or able to use their positions to accumulate riches. The\nlatter seems most likely in aristocratic societies that add another element:\nwar and plunder. After all, just about anyone who comes into a very large\namount of wealth will ultimately give at least part of it away—often in\ngrandiose and spectacular ways to large numbers of people. The more of one’s\nwealth is obtained by plunder or extortion, the more spectacular and self-\naggrandizing will be the forms in which it’s given\naway.[44](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts044) And what is true of\nwarrior aristocracies is all the more true of ancient states, where rulers\nalmost invariably represented themselves as the protectors of the helpless,\nsupporters of widows and orphans, and champions of the poor. The genealogy of\nthe modern redistributive state—with its notorious tendency to foster identity\npolitics—can be traced back not to any sort of “primitive communism” but\nultimately to violence and war.\n\n## Shifting between Modalities\n\nI should underline again that we are not talking about different types of\nsociety here (as we’ve seen, the very idea that we’ve ever been organized into\ndiscrete “societies” is dubious) but moral principles that always coexist\neverywhere. We are all communists with our closest friends, and feudal lords\nwhen dealing with small children. It is very hard to imagine a society where\npeople wouldn’t be both.\n\nThe obvious question is: If we are all ordinarily moving back and forth\nbetween completely different systems of moral accounting, why hasn’t anybody\nnoticed this? Why, instead, do we continually feel the need to reframe\neverything in terms of reciprocity?\n\nHere we must return to the fact that reciprocity is our main way of imagining\njustice. In particular, it is what we fall back on when we’re thinking in the\nabstract, and especially when we’re trying to create an idealized picture of\nsociety. I’ve already given examples of this sort of thing. Iroquois\ncommunities were based on an ethos that required everyone to be attentive to\nthe needs of several different sorts of people: their friends, their families,\nmembers of their matrilineal clans, even friendly strangers in situations of\nhardship. It was when they had to think about society in the abstract that\nthey started to emphasize the two sides of the village, each of which had to\nbury the other’s dead. It was a way of imagining communism through\nreciprocity. Similarly, feudalism was a notoriously messy and complicated\nbusiness, but whenever Medieval thinkers generalized about it, they reduced\nall its ranks and orders into one simple formula in which each order\ncontributed its share: “Some pray, some fight, still others\nwork.”[45](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts045) Even hierarchy was\nseen as ultimately reciprocal, despite this formula having nothing to do with\nthe real relations between priests, knights, and peasants really operated on\nthe ground. Anthropologists are familiar with the phenomenon: it’s only when\npeople who have never had occasion to really think about their society or\nculture as a whole, who probably weren’t even aware they were living inside\nsomething other people considered a “society” or a “culture,” are asked to\nexplain how everything works that they say things like “this is how we repay\nour mothers for the pain of having raised us,” or puzzle over conceptual\ndiagrams in which clan A gives their women in marriage to clan B who gives\ntheirs to clan C, who gives theirs back to A again, but which never seem to\nquite correspond to what real people actually\ndo.[46](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts046) When trying to imagine\na just society, it’s hard not to evoke images of balance and symmetry, of\nelegant geometries where everything balances out.\n\nThe idea that there is something called “the market” is not so very different.\nEconomists will often admit this, if you ask them in the right way. Markets\naren’t real. They are mathematical models, created by imagining a self-\ncontained world where everyone has exactly the same motivation and the same\nknowledge and is engaging in the same self-interested calculating exchange.\nEconomists are aware that reality is always more complicated; but they are\nalso aware that to come up with a mathematical model, one always has to make\nthe world into a bit of a cartoon. There’s nothing wrong with this. The\nproblem comes when it enables some (often these same economists) to declare\nthat anyone who ignores the dictates of the market shall surely be punished—or\nthat since we live in a market system, everything (except government\ninterference) is based on principles of justice: that our economic system is\none vast network of reciprocal relations in which, in the end, the accounts\nbalance and all debts are paid.\n\nThese principles get tangled up in each other and it’s thus often difficult to\ntell which predominates in a given situation—one reason that it’s ridiculous\nto pretend we could ever reduce human behavior, economic or otherwise, to a\nmathematical formula of any sort. Still, this means that some degree of\nreciprocity can be detected as potentially present in any situation; so a\ndetermined observer can always find some excuse to say it’s there. What’s\nmore, certain principles appear to have an inherent tendency to slip into\nothers. For instance, a lot of extremely hierarchical relationships can\noperate (at least some of the time) on communistic principles. If you have a\nrich patron, you come to him in times of need, and he is expected to help you.\nBut only to a certain degree. No one expects the patron to provide so much\nhelp that it threatens to undermine the underlying\ninequality.[47](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts047)\n\nLikewise, communistic relations can easily start slipping into relations of\nhierarchical inequality—often without anyone noticing it. It’s not hard to see\nwhy this happens. Sometimes different people’s “abilities” and “needs” are\ngrossly disproportionate. Genuinely egalitarian societies are keenly aware of\nthis and tend to develop elaborate safeguards around the dangers of\nanyone—say, especially good hunters, in a hunting society—rising too far above\nthemselves; just as they tend to be suspicious of anything that might make one\nmember of the society feel in genuine debt to another. A member who draws\nattention to his own accomplishments will find himself the object of mockery.\nOften, the only polite thing to do if one has accomplished something\nsignificant is to instead make fun of oneself. The Danish writer Peter\nFreuchen, in his _Book of the Eskimo_ , described how in Greenland, one could\ntell what a fine delicacy someone had to offer his guests by how much he\nbelittled it beforehand:\n\nThe old man laughed. “Some people don’t know much. I am such a poor hunter and\nmy wife a terrible cook who ruins everything. I don’t have much, but I think\nthere is a piece of meat outside. It might still be there as the dogs have\nrefused it several times.”\n\nThis was such a recommendation in the Eskimo way of backwards bragging that\neveryone’s mouths began to water …\n\nThe reader will recall the walrus hunter of the last chapter, who took offense\nwhen the author tried to thank him for giving him a share of meat—after all,\nhumans help one another, and once we treat something as a gift, we turn into\nsomething less than human: “Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and\nby whips one makes dogs.”[48](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts048)\n\n“Gift” here does _not_ mean something given freely, not mutual aid that we can\nordinarily expect human beings to provide to one another. To thank someone\nsuggests that he or she might _not_ have acted that way, and that therefore\nthe choice to act this way creates an obligation, a sense of debt—and hence,\ninferiority. Communes or egalitarian collectives in the United States often\nface similar dilemmas, and they have to come up with their own safeguards\nagainst creeping hierarchy. It’s not that the tendency for communism to slip\ninto hierarchy is inevitable—societies like the Inuit have managed to fend it\noff for thousands of years—but rather, that one must always guard against it.\n\nIn contrast, it’s notoriously difficult—often downright impossible—to shift\nrelations based on an assumption of communistic sharing to relations of equal\nexchange. We observe this all the time with friends: if someone is seen as\ntaking advantage of your generosity, it’s often much easier to break off\nrelations entirely than to demand that they somehow pay you back. One extreme\nexample is the Maori story about a notorious glutton who used to irritate\nfishermen up and down the coast near where he lived by constantly asking for\nthe best portions of their catch. Since to refuse a direct request for food\nwas effectively impossible, they would dutifully turn it over; until one day,\npeople decided enough was enough and killed\nhim.[49](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts049)\n\nWe’ve already seen how creating a ground of sociability among strangers can\noften require an elaborate process of testing the others’ limits by helping\noneself to their possessions. The same sort of thing can happen in\npeacemaking, or even in the creation of business\npartnerships.[50](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts050) In\nMadagascar, people told me that two men who are thinking of going into\nbusiness together will often become blood brothers. Blood brotherhood,\n_fatidra_ , consists of an unlimited promise of mutual aid. Both parties\nsolemnly swear that they will never refuse any request from the other. In\nreality, partners to such an agreement are usually fairly circumspect in what\nthey actually request. But, my friends insisted, when people first make such\nan agreement, they sometimes like to test it out. One may demand the other’s\nhouse, the shirt off his back, or (everyone’s favorite example) the right to\nspend the night with his wife. The only limit is the knowledge that anything\none can demand, the other one can\ntoo.[51](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts051) Here, again, we are\ntalking about an initial establishment of trust. Once the genuineness of the\nmutual commitment has been confirmed, the ground is prepared, as it were, and\nthe two men can begin to buy and sell on consignment, advance funds, share\nprofits, and otherwise trust that each will look after the other’s commercial\ninterests from then on. The most famous and dramatic moments, however, are\nthose when relations of exchange threaten to break down into hierarchy: that\nis, when two parties are acting like equals, trading gifts, or blows, or\ncommodities, or anything else, but one of them does something that completely\nflips the scale.\n\nI’ve already mentioned the tendency of gift exchange to turn into games of\none-upmanship, and how in some societies this potential is formalized in great\npublic contests. This is typical, above all, of what are often called “heroic\nsocieties”: those in which governments are weak or nonexistent and society is\norganized instead around warrior noblemen, each with his entourage of loyal\nretainers and tied to the others by ever-shifting alliances and rivalries.\nMost epic poetry—from the _Iliad_ to the _Mahabharata_ to _Beowulf_ —harkens\nback to this sort of world, and anthropologists have discovered similar\narrangements among the Maori of New Zealand and the Kwakiutl, Tlingit, and\nHaida of the American Northwest coast. In heroic societies, the throwing of\nfeasts and resulting contests of generosity are often spoken of as mere\nextensions of war: “fighting with property” or “fighting with food.” Those who\nthrow such feasts often indulge in colorful speeches about how their enemies\nare thus crushed and destroyed by glorious feats of generosity aimed in their\ndirection (Kwakiutl chiefs liked to speak of themselves as great mountains\nfrom which gifts rolled like giant boulders), and of how conquered rivals are\nthus reduced—much as in the Inuit metaphor—to slaves.\n\nSuch statements are not to be taken literally—another feature of such\nsocieties is a highly developed art of\nboasting.[52](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts052) Heroic chiefs and\nwarriors tended to talk themselves up just as consistently as those in\negalitarian societies talked themselves down. It’s not as if someone who loses\nout in a contest of gift exchange is ever actually reduced to slavery, but he\nmight end up feeling as if he were. And the consequences could be\ncatastrophic. One ancient Greek source describes Celtic festivals where rival\nnobles would alternate between jousts and contests of generosity, presenting\ntheir enemies with magnificent gold and silver treasures. Occasionally this\ncould lead to a kind of checkmate; someone would be faced with a present so\nmagnificent that he could not possibly match it. In this case, the only\nhonorable response was for him to cut his own throat, thus allowing his wealth\nto be distributed to his\nfollowers.[53](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts053) Six hundred\nyears later, we find a case from an Icelandic saga of an aging Viking named\nEgil, who befriended a younger man named Einar, who was still actively\nraiding. They liked to sit together composing poetry. One day Einar came by a\nmagnificent shield “inscribed with old tales; and between the writing were\noverlaid spangles of gold with precious stones.” No one had ever seen anything\nlike it. He took it with him on a visit to Egil. Egil was not at home, so\nEinar waited three days, as was the custom, then hung the shield as a present\nin the mead-hall and rode off.\n\nEgil returned home, saw the shield, and asked who owned such a treasure. He\nwas told that Einar had visited and given it to him. Then Egil said, “To hell\nwith him! Does he think I’m going to stay up all night and compose a poem\nabout his shield? Get my horse, I’m going to ride after him and kill him.” As\nEinar’s luck would have it he had left early enough to put sufficient distance\nbetween himself and Egil. So Egil resigned himself to composing a poem about\nEinar’s gift.[54](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts054)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nCompetitive gift exchange, then, does not literally render anyone slaves; it\nis simply an affair of honor. These are people, however, for whom honor is\neverything.\n\nThe main reason that being unable to pay a debt, especially a debt of honor,\nwas such a crisis was because this _was_ how noblemen assembled their\nentourages. The law of hospitality in the ancient world, for instance,\ninsisted that any traveler must be fed, given shelter, and treated as an\nhonored guest—but only for a certain length of time. If a guest did not go\naway, he would eventually become a mere subordinate. The role of such hangers-\non has been largely neglected by students of human history. In many\nperiods—from imperial Rome to medieval China—probably the most important\nrelationships, at least in towns and cities, were those of patronage. Anyone\nrich and important would find himself surrounded by flunkies, sycophants,\nperpetual dinner guests, and other sorts of willing dependents. Drama and\npoetry of the time are full of such\ncharacters.[55](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts055) Similarly, for\nmuch of human history, being respectable and middle-class meant spending one’s\nmornings going from door to door, paying one’s respects to important local\npatrons. To this day, informal patronage systems still crop up, whenever\nrelatively rich and powerful people feel the need to assemble networks of\nsupporters—a practice well documented in many parts of the Mediterranean, the\nMiddle East, and Latin America. Such relationships seem to consist of a\nslapdash mix of all three principles that I’ve been mapping out over the\ncourse of this chapter; nevertheless, those observing them insist on trying to\ncast them in the language of exchange and debt.\n\nA final example: in a collection called _Gifts and Spoils_ , published in\n1971, we find a brief essay by the anthropologist Lorraine Blaxter about a\nrural department in the French Pyrenees, most of whose inhabitants are\nfarmers. Everyone places a great emphasis on the importance of mutual aid—the\nlocal phrase means “giving service” _(rendre service)_. People living in the\nsame community should look out for one another and pitch in when their\nneighbors are having trouble. This is the essence of communal morality, in\nfact, it’s how one knows that any sort of community exists. So far so good.\nHowever, she notes, when someone does a particularly great favor, mutual aid\ncan turn into something else:\n\nIf a man in a factory went to the boss and asked for a job, and the boss found\nhim one, this would be an example of someone giving service. The man who got\nthe job could never repay the boss, but he could show him respect, or perhaps\ngive him symbolic gifts of garden produce. If a gift demands a return, and no\ntangible return is possible, the repayment will be through support or\nesteem.[56](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts056)\n\nThus does mutual aid slip into inequality. Thus do patron-client relations\ncome into being. We have already observed this. I chose this particular\npassage because the author’s phrasing is so weird. It completely contradicts\nitself. The boss does the man a favor. The man cannot repay the favor.\nTherefore, the man repays the favor by showing up at the boss’s house with the\noccasional basket of tomatoes and showing him respect. So which one is it? Can\nhe repay the favor, or not?\n\nPeter Freuchen’s walrus hunter would, no doubt, think he knew exactly what was\ngoing on here. Bringing the basket of tomatoes was simply the equivalent of\nsaying “Thank you.” It was a way of acknowledging that one owes a debt of\ngratitude, that gifts had in fact made slaves just as whips make dogs. The\nboss and the employee are now fundamentally different sorts of people. The\nproblem is that in all other respects, they are not fundamentally different\nsorts of people. Most likely they are both middle-aged Frenchmen, fathers of\nfamilies, citizens of the Republic with similar tastes in music, sports, and\nfood. They _ought_ to be equals. As a result, even the tomatoes, which are\nreally a token of recognition of the existence of a debt that can never be\nrepaid, has to be represented as if it was itself a kind of repayment—an\ninterest payment on a loan that could, everyone agrees to pretend, someday be\npaid back, thus returning the two members to their proper equal status once\nagain.[57](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts057)\n\n(It’s telling that the favor is finding the client a job in a factory, because\nwhat happens is not very different from what happens when you get a job in a\nfactory to begin with. A wage-labor contract is, ostensibly, a free contract\nbetween equals—but an agreement between equals in which both agree that once\none of them punches the time clock, they won’t be equals any\nmore.[58](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts058) The law does\nrecognize a bit of a problem here; that’s why it insists that you cannot sell\noff your equality permanently [you are not free to sell yourself into\nslavery]. Such arrangements are only acceptable if the boss’s power is not\nabsolute, if it is limited to work time, and if you have the legal right to\nbreak off the contract and thereby to restore yourself to full equality, at\nany time.)\n\nIt seems to me that this agreement between equals to no longer be equal (at\nleast for a time) is critically important. It is the very essence of what we\ncall “debt.”\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nWhat, then, is debt?\n\nDebt is a very specific thing, and it arises from very specific situations. It\nfirst requires a relationship between two people who do not consider each\nother fundamentally different sorts of being, who are at least potential\nequals, who _are_ equals in those ways that are really important, and who are\nnot currently in a state of equality—but for whom there is some way to set\nmatters straight.\n\nIn the case of gift-giving, as we’ve seen, this requires a certain equality of\nstatus. That’s why our economics professor didn’t feel any sense of\nobligation—any debt of honor—if taken out to dinner by someone who ranked\neither much higher or much lower than himself. With money loans, all that is\nrequired is that the two parties be of equal legal standing. (You can’t lend\nmoney to a child, or to a lunatic. Well, you can, but the courts won’t help\nyou get it back.) Legal—rather than moral—debts have other unique qualities.\nFor instance, they can be forgiven, which isn’t always possible with a moral\ndebt.\n\nThis means that there is no such thing as a genuinely unpayable debt. If there\nwas no conceivable way to salvage the situation, we wouldn’t be calling it a\n“debt.” Even the French villager could, conceivably, save his patron’s life,\nor win the lottery and buy the factory. Even when we speak of a criminal\n“paying his debt to society,” we are saying that he has done something so\nterrible that he has now been banished from that equal status under the law\nthat belongs by natural right to any citizen of his country; however, we call\nit a “debt” because it _can_ be paid, equality _can_ be restored, even if the\ncost may be death by lethal injection.\n\nDuring the time that the debt remains unpaid, the logic of hierarchy takes\nhold. There is no reciprocity. As anyone who has ever been in jail knows, the\nfirst thing the jailors communicate is that nothing that happens in jail has\nanything to do with justice. Similarly, debtor and creditor confront each\nother like a peasant before a feudal lord. The law of precedent takes hold. If\nyou bring your creditor tomatoes from the garden, it never occurs to you that\nhe would give something back. He might expect you to do it again, though. But\nalways there is the assumption that the situation is somewhat unnatural,\nbecause the debt really ought to be paid.\n\nThis is what makes situations of effectively unpayable debt so difficult and\nso painful. Since creditor and debtor are ultimately equals, if the debtor\ncannot do what it takes to restore herself to equality, there is obviously\nsomething wrong with her; it must be her fault.\n\nThis connection becomes clear if we look at the etymology of common words for\n“debt” in European languages. Many are synonyms for “fault,” “sin,” or\n“guilt;” just as a criminal owes a debt to society, a debtor is always a sort\nof criminal.[59](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts059) In ancient\nCrete, according to Plutarch, it was the custom for those taking loans to\npretend to snatch the money from the lender’s purse. Why, he wondered?\nProbably “so that, if they default, they could be charged with violence and\npunished all the more.”[60](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts060)\nThis is why in so many periods of history insolvent debtors could be jailed,\nor even—as in early Republican Rome—executed.\n\nA debt, then, is just an exchange that has not been brought to completion.\n\nIt follows that debt is strictly a creature of reciprocity and has little to\ndo with other sorts of morality (communism, with its needs and abilities;\nhierarchy, with its customs and qualities). True, if we were really\ndetermined, we could argue (as some do) that communism is a condition of\npermanent mutual indebtedness, or that hierarchy is constructed out of\nunpayable debts. But isn’t this just the same old story, starting from the\nassumption that all human interactions must be, by definition, forms of\nexchange, and then performing whatever mental somersaults are required to\nprove it?\n\nNo. All human interactions are not forms of exchange. Only some are. Exchange\nencourages a particular way of conceiving human relations. This is because\nexchange implies equality, but it also implies separation. It’s precisely when\nthe money changes hands, when the debt is cancelled, that equality is restored\n_and_ both parties can walk away and have nothing further to do with each\nother.\n\nDebt is what happens in between: when the two parties cannot yet walk away\nfrom each other, because they are not yet equal. But it is carried out in the\nshadow of eventual equality. Because achieving that equality, however,\ndestroys the very reason for having a relationship, just about everything\ninteresting happens in\nbetween.[61](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts061) In fact, just\nabout everything human happens in between—even if this means that all such\nhuman relations bear with them at least a tiny element of criminality, guilt,\nor shame.\n\nFor the Tiv women whom I mentioned earlier in the chapter, this wasn’t much of\na problem. By ensuring that everyone was always slightly in debt to one\nanother, they actually created human society, if a very fragile sort of\nsociety—a delicate web made up of obligations to return three eggs or a bag of\nokra, ties renewed and recreated, as any one of them could be cancelled out at\nany time.\n\nOur own habits of civility are not so very different. Consider the custom, in\nAmerican society, of constantly saying “please” and “thank you.” To do so is\noften treated as basic morality: we are constantly chiding children for\nforgetting to do it, just as the moral guardians of our society—teachers and\nministers, for instance—do to everybody else. We often assume that the habit\nis universal, but as the Inuit hunter made clear, it is\nnot.[62](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts062) Like so many of our\neveryday courtesies, it is a kind of democratization of what was once a habit\nof feudal deference: the insistence on treating absolutely everyone the way\nthat one used only to have to treat a lord or similar hierarchical superior.\n\nPerhaps this is not so in every case. Imagine we are on a crowded bus, looking\nfor a seat. A fellow passenger moves her bag aside to clear one; we smile, or\nnod, or make some other little gesture of acknowledgment. Or perhaps we\nactually say “Thank you.” Such a gesture is simply a recognition of common\nhumanity: we are acknowledging that the woman who had been blocking the seat\nis not a mere physical obstacle but a human being, and that we feel genuine\ngratitude toward someone we will likely never see again. None of this is\ngenerally true when one asks someone across the table to “please pass the\nsalt,” or when the postman thanks you for signing for a delivery. We think of\nthese simultaneously as meaningless formalities and as the very moral basis of\nsociety. Their apparent unimportance can be measured by the fact that almost\nno one would refuse, on principle, to say “please” or “thank you” in just\nabout any situation—even those who might find it almost impossible to say “I’m\nsorry” or “I apologize.”\n\nIn fact, the English “please” is short for “if you please,” “if it pleases you\nto do this”—it is the same in most European languages (French _si il vous\nplait_ , Spanish _por favor_). Its literal meaning is “you are under no\nobligation to do this.” “Hand me the salt. Not that I am saying that you have\nto!” This is not true; there is a social obligation, and it would be almost\nimpossible not to comply. But etiquette largely consists of the exchange of\npolite fictions (to use less polite language, lies). When you ask someone to\npass the salt, you are also giving them an order; by attaching the word\n“please,” you are saying that it is not an order. But, in fact, it is.\n\nIn English, “thank you” derives from “think,” it originally meant, “I will\nremember what you did for me”—which is usually not true either—but in other\nlanguages (the Portuguese _obrigado_ is a good example) the standard term\nfollows the form of the English “much obliged”—it actually does means “I am in\nyour debt.” The French _merci_ is even more graphic: it derives from “mercy,”\nas in begging for mercy; by saying it you are symbolically placing yourself in\nyour benefactor’s power—since a debtor is, after all, a\ncriminal.[63](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts063) Saying “you’re\nwelcome,” or “it’s nothing” (French _de rien_ , Spanish _de nada_)—the latter\nhas at least the advantage of often being literally true—is a way of\nreassuring the one to whom one has passed the salt that you are not actually\ninscribing a debit in your imaginary moral account book. So is saying “my\npleasure”—you are saying, “No, actually, it’s a credit, not a debit—you did\n_me_ a favor because in asking me to pass the salt, you gave me the\nopportunity to do something I found rewarding in\nitself!”[64](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts064)\n\nDecoding the tacit calculus of debt (“I owe you one,” “No, you don’t owe me\nanything,” “Actually, if anything, it’s me who owes you,” as if inscribing and\nthen scratching off so many infinitesimal entries in an endless ledger) makes\nit easy to understand why this sort of thing is often viewed not as the\nquintessence of morality, but as the quintessence of _middle-class_ morality.\nTrue, by now middle-class sensibilities dominate society. But there are still\nthose who find the practice odd. Those at the very top of society often still\nfeel that deference is owed primarily to hierarchical superiors and find it\nslightly idiotic to watch postmen and pastry cooks taking turns pretending to\ntreat each other like little feudal lords. At the other extreme, those who\ngrew up in what in Europe are called “popular” environments—small towns, poor\nneighborhoods, anyplace where there is still an assumption that people who are\nnot enemies will, ordinarily, take care of one another—will often find it\ninsulting to be constantly told, in effect, that there is some chance they\nmight _not_ do their job as a waiter or taxi driver correctly, or provide\nhouseguests with tea. In other words, middle-class etiquette insists that we\nare all equals, but it does so in a very particular way. On the one hand, it\npretends that nobody is giving anybody orders (think here of the burly\nsecurity guard at the mall who appears before someone walking into a\nrestricted area and says, “Can I help you?”); on the other, it treats every\ngesture of what I’ve been calling “baseline communism” as if it were really a\nform of exchange. As a result, like Tiv neighborhoods, middle-class society\nhas to be endlessly recreated, as a kind of constant flickering game of\nshadows, the criss-crossing of an infinity of momentary debt relations, each\none almost instantly cancelled out.\n\nAll of this is a relatively recent innovation. The habit of always saying\n“please” and “thank you” first began to take hold during the commercial\nrevolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—among those very middle\nclasses who were largely responsible for it. It is the language of bureaus,\nshops, and offices, and over the course of the last five hundred years it has\nspread across the world along with them. It is also merely one token of a much\nlarger philosophy, a set of assumptions of what humans are and what they owe\none another, that have by now become so deeply ingrained that we cannot see\nthem.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nSometimes, at the brink of a new historical era, some prescient soul can see\nthe full implications of what is beginning to happen—sometimes in a way that\nlater generations can’t. Let me end with a text by such a person. In Paris,\nsometime in 1540s, François Rabelais—lapsed monk, doctor, legal\nscholar—composed what was to become a famous mock eulogy, which he inserted in\nthe third book of his great _Gargantua and Pantagruel_ , and which came to be\nknown as “In Praise of Debt.”\n\nRabelais places the encomium in the mouth of one Panurge, a wandering scholar\nand man of extreme classical erudition who, he observes, “knew sixty-three\nways of making money—the most honorable and most routine of which was\nstealing.”[65](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts065) The good-natured\ngiant Pantagruel adopts Panurge and even provides him with a respectable\nincome, but it bothers him that Panurge continues to spend money like water\nand remains up to his ears in debt. Wouldn’t it be better, Pantagruel\nsuggests, to be able to pay his creditors?\n\nPanurge responds with horror: “God forbid that I should ever be out of debt!”\nDebt is, in fact, the very basis of his philosophy:\n\nAlways owe somebody something, then he will be forever praying God to grant\nyou a good, long and blessed life. Fearing to lose what you owe him, he will\nalways be saying good things about you in every sort of company; he will be\nconstantly acquiring new lenders for you, so that you can borrow to pay him\nback, filling his ditch with other men’s\nspoil.[66](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts066)\n\nAbove all else, they will always be praying that you come into money. It’s\nlike those ancient slaves destined to be sacrificed at their masters’\nfunerals. When they wished their master long life and good health, they\ngenuinely meant it! What’s more, debt can make you into a kind of god, who can\nmake something (money, well-wishing creditors) out of absolutely nothing.\n\nWorse still: I give myself to bonnie Saint Bobelin if all my life I have not\nreckoned debts to be, as it were, a connection and colligation between Heaven\nand Earth (uniquely preserving the lineage of Man without which, I say, all\nhuman beings would soon perish) and perhaps to be that great World Soul which,\naccording to the Academics, gives life to all things.\n\nThat it really is so, evoke tranquilly in your mind the Idea and Form of a\nworld—take if you like the thirtieth of the worlds imagined by Metrodorus—in\nwhich there were no debtors or lenders at all. A universe sans debts! Amongst\nthe heavenly bodies there would be no regular course whatsoever: all would be\nin disarray. Jupiter, reckoning that he owed no debt to Saturn, would\ndispossess him of his sphere, and with his Homeric chain hold in suspension\nall the Intelligences, gods, heavens, daemons, geniuses, heroes, devils,\nearth, sea and all the elements … The Moon would remain dark and bloody; why\nshould the Sun share his light with her? He is under no obligation. The Sun\nwould never shine on their Earth; the heavenly bodies would pour no good\ninfluences down upon it.\n\nBetween the elements there will be no mutual sharing of qualities, no\nalternation, no transmutation whatsoever, one will not think itself obliged to\nthe other; it has lent it nothing. From earth no longer will water be made,\nnor water transmuted into air; from air fire will not be made, and fire will\nnot warm the earth. Earth will bring forth nothing but monsters, Titans,\ngiants. The rain will not rain, the light will shed no light, the wind will\nnot blow, and there will be no summer, no autumn, Lucifer will tear off his\nbonds and, sallying forth from deepest Hell with the Furies, the Vengeances\nand the horned devils, will seek to turf the gods of both the greater and\nlesser nations out from their nests in the heavens.\n\nAnd what’s more, if human beings owed nothing to one another, life would “be\nno better than a dog-fight”—a mere unruly brawl.\n\nAmongst human beings none will save another; it will be no good a man shouting\nHelp! Fire! I’m drowning! Murder! Nobody will come and help him. Why? Because\nhe has lent nothing: and no one owes him anything. No one has anything to lose\nby his fire, his shipwreck, his fall, or his death. He has lent nothing. And:\nhe would lend nothing either hereafter.\n\nIn short, Faith, Hope and Charity would be banished from this world.\n\nPanurge—a man without a family, alone, whose entire calling in life was\ngetting large amounts of money and then spending it—serves as a fitting\nprophet for the world that was just beginning to emerge. His perspective of\ncourse is that of a _wealthy_ debtor—not one liable to be trundled off to some\npestiferous dungeon for failure to pay. Still, what he is describing is the\nlogical conclusion, the _reductio ad absurdum_ , which Rabelais as always lays\nout with cheerful perversity, of the assumptions about the world as exchange\nslumbering behind all our pleasant bourgeois formalities (which Rabelais\nhimself, incidentally, detested—the book is basically a mixture of classical\nerudition and dirty jokes).\n\nAnd what he says is true. If we insist on defining all human interactions as\nmatters of people giving one thing for another, then any ongoing human\nrelations can only take the form of debts. Without them, no one would owe\nanything to anybody. A world without debt would revert to primordial chaos, a\nwar of all against all; no one would feel the slightest responsibility for one\nanother; the simple fact of being human would have no significance; we would\nall become isolated planets who couldn’t even be counted on to maintain our\nproper orbits.\n\nPantagruel will have none of it. His own feelings on the matter, he says, can\nbe summed up with one line from the Apostle Paul: “Owe no man anything, save\nmutual love and affection.”[67](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-nts067)\nThen, in an appropriately biblical gesture, he declares, “From your past debts\nI shall free you.”\n\n“What can I do but thank you?” Panurge replies.\n\n\n# Chapter Six  \n  \nGAMES WITH SEX AND DEATH\n\nWHEN WE RETURN to an examination of conventional economic history, one thing\nthat jumps out is how much has been made to disappear. Reducing all human life\nto exchange means not only shunting aside all other forms of economic\nexperience (hierarchy, communism), but also ensuring that the vast majority of\nthe human race who are not adult males, and therefore whose day-to-day\nexistence is relatively difficult to reduce to a matter of swapping things in\nsuch a way as to seek mutual advantage, melt away into the background.\n\nAs a result, we end up with a sanitized view of the way actual business is\nconducted. The tidy world of shops and malls is the quintessential middle-\nclass environment, but at either the top or the bottom of the system, the\nworld of financiers or of gangsters, deals are often made in ways not so\ncompletely different from ways that the Gunwinggu or Nambikwara make them—at\nleast in that sex, drugs, music, extravagant displays of food, and the\npotential for violence do often play parts.\n\nConsider the case of Neil Bush (George W.’s brother) who, during divorce\nproceedings with his wife, admitted to multiple infidelities with women who,\nhe claimed, would mysteriously appear at his hotel-room door after important\nbusiness meetings in Thailand and Hong Kong.\n\n“You have to admit it’s pretty remarkable,” remarked one of his wife’s\nattorneys, “for a man to go to a hotel-room door and open it and have a woman\nstanding there and have sex with her.”\n\n“It was very unusual,” Bush replied, admitting however that this had happened\nto him on numerous occasions.\n\n“Were they prostitutes?”\n\n“I don’t know.”[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts001)\n\nIn fact, such things seem almost par for the course when really big money\ncomes into play.\n\nIn this light, the economists’ insistence that economic life begins with\nbarter, the innocent exchange of arrows for teepee frames, with no one in a\nposition to rape, humiliate, or torture anyone else, and that it continues in\nthis way, is touchingly utopian.\n\nAs a result, though, the histories we tell are full of blank spaces, and the\nwomen in them seem to appear out of nowhere, without explanation, much like\nthe Thai women who appeared at Bush’s door. Recall the passage cited in\nChapter Three, from numismatist Philip Grierson, about money in the barbarian\nlaw codes:\n\nCompensation in the Welsh laws is reckoned primarily in cattle and in the\nIrish ones in cattle or bondmaids _(cumal)_ , with considerable use of\nprecious metals in both. In the Germanic codes it is mainly in precious metal\n…[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts002)\n\nHow is it possible to read this passage without immediately stopping at the\nend of the first line? “Bondmaids”? Doesn’t that mean “slaves?” (It does.) In\nancient Ireland, female slaves were so plentiful and important that they came\nto function as currency. How did that happen? And if we are trying to\nunderstand the origins of money, here, isn’t the fact that people are using\n_one another_ as currency at all interesting or\nsignificant?[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts003) Yet none of the\nsources on money remark much on it. It would seem that by the time of the law\ncodes, slave girls were not actually traded, but just used as units of\naccount. Still, they must have been traded at some point. Who were they? How\nwere they enslaved? Were they captured in war, sold by their parents, or\nreduced to slavery through debt? Were they a major trade item? The answer to\nall these questions would seem to be yes, but it’s hard to say more because\nthe history remains largely\nunwritten.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts004)\n\nOr let’s return to the parable of the ungrateful servant. “Since he was not\nable to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all\nthat he had be sold to repay the debt.” How did that happen? Note that we’re\nnot even speaking of debt service here (he is already his creditor’s servant),\nbut outright slavery. How did a man’s wife and children come to be considered\nno different than his sheep and crockery—as property to be liquidated on the\noccasion of default? Was it normal for a man in first-century Palestine to be\nable to sell his wife? (It\nwasn’t.)[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts005) If he didn’t own\nher, why was someone else allowed to sell her if he couldn’t pay his debts?\n\nThe same could be asked of the story in Nehemiah. It’s hard not to empathize\nwith the distress of a father watching his daughter taken off by strangers. On\nthe other hand, one might also ask: Why weren’t they taking _him?_ The\ndaughter hadn’t borrowed any money.\n\nIt’s not as if it is ordinary for fathers in traditional societies to be able\nto sell their children. This is a practice with a very specific history: it\nappears in the great agrarian civilizations, from Sumer to Rome to China,\nright around the time when we also start to see evidence of money, markets,\nand interest-bearing loans; later, more gradually, it also appears in those\nsurrounding hinterlands that supplied those civilizations with\nslaves.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts006) What’s more, if we\nexamine the historical evidence, there seems good reason to believe that the\nvery obsession with patriarchal honor that so defines “tradition” in the\nMiddle East and Mediterranean world _itself_ arose alongside the father’s\npower to alienate his children—as a reaction to what were seen as the moral\nperils of the market. All of this is treated as somehow outside the bounds of\neconomic history.\n\nExcluding all this is deceptive not only because it excludes the main purposes\nto which money was actually put in the past, but because it doesn’t give us a\nclear vision of the present. After all, who were those Thai women who so\nmysteriously appeared at Neil Bush’s hotel door? Almost certainly, they were\nchildren of indebted parents. Likely as not, they were contractual debt peons\nthemselves.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts007)\n\nFocusing on the sex industry would be deceptive, though. Then as now, most\nwomen in debt bondage spend the vast majority of their time sewing, preparing\nsoups, and scouring latrines. Even in the Bible, the admonition in the Ten\nCommandments not to “covet thy neighbor’s wife” clearly referred not to lust\nin one’s heart (adultery had already been covered in commandment number\nseven), but to the prospect of taking her as a debt-peon—in other words, as a\nservant to sweep one’s yard and hang out the\nlaundry.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts008) In most such\nmatters, sexual exploitation was at best incidental (usually illegal,\nsometimes practiced anyway, symbolically important.) Again, once we remove\nsome of our usual blinders, we can see that matters have changed far less,\nover the course of the last five thousand years or so, than we really like to\nthink.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThese blinders are all the more ironic when one looks at the anthropological\nliterature on what used to be called “primitive money”—that is, the sort one\nencounters in places where there are no states or markets—whether Iroquois\nwampum, African cloth money, or Solomon Island feather money, and discovers\nthat such money is used almost exclusively for the kinds of transactions that\neconomists don’t like to have to talk about.\n\nIn fact, the term “primitive money” is deceptive for this very reason, since\nit suggests that we are dealing with a crude version of the kind of currencies\nwe use today. But this is precisely what we don’t find. Often, such currencies\nare never used to buy and sell anything at\nall.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts009) Instead, they are used\nto create, maintain, and otherwise reorganize relations between people: to\narrange marriages, establish the paternity of children, head off feuds,\nconsole mourners at funerals, seek forgiveness in the case of crimes,\nnegotiate treaties, acquire followers—almost anything but trade in yams,\nshovels, pigs, or jewelry.\n\nOften, these currencies were extremely important, so much so that social life\nitself might be said to revolve around getting and disposing of the stuff.\nClearly, though, they mark a totally different conception of what money, or\nindeed an economy, is actually about. I’ve decided therefore to refer to them\nas “social currencies,” and the economies that employ them as “human\neconomies.” By this I mean not that these societies are necessarily in any way\nmore humane (some are quite humane; others extraordinarily brutal), but only\nthat they are economic systems primarily concerned not with the accumulation\nof wealth, but with the creation, destruction, and rearranging of human\nbeings.\n\nHistorically, commercial economies—market economies, as we now like to call\nthem—are a relative newcomer. For most of human history, human economies\npredominated. To even begin to write a genuine history of debt, then, we have\nto start by asking: What sort of debts, what sort of credits and debits, do\npeople accumulate in human economies? And what happens when human economies\nbegin to give away to or are taken over by commercial ones? This is another\nway of asking the question, “How do mere obligations turn into debts?”—but it\nmeans not just asking the question in the abstract, but examining the\nhistorical record to try to reconstruct what actually did happen.\n\nThis is what I will do over the course of the next two chapters. First I will\nlook at the role of money in human economies, then describe what can happen\nwhen human economies are suddenly incorporated into the economic orbits of\nlarger, commercial ones. The African slave trade will serve as a particularly\ncatastrophic case in point. Then, in the next chapter, I will return to the\nfirst emergence of commercial economies in early civilizations of Europe and\nthe Middle East.\n\n## Money as Inadequate Substitute\n\nThe most interesting theory of the origin of money is the one recently put\nforward by a French economist-turned-anthropologist named Philippe Rospabé.\nWhile his work is largely unknown in the English-speaking world, it’s quite\ningenious, and it bears directly on our problem. Rospabé’s argument is that\n“primitive money” was not originally a way to pay debts of any sort. It’s a\nway of recognizing the existence of debts that cannot possibly be paid. His\nargument is worth considering in detail.\n\nIn most human economies, money is used first and foremost to arrange\nmarriages. The simplest and probably most common way of doing this was by\nbeing presented as what used to be called “bride-price”: a suitor’s family\nwould deliver a certain number of dog teeth, or cowries, or brass rings, or\nwhatever is the local social currency, to a woman’s family, and they would\npresent their daughter as his bride. It’s easy to see why this might be\ninterpreted as buying a women, and many colonial officials in Africa and\nOceania in the early part of the twentieth century did indeed come to that\nconclusion. The practice caused something of a scandal, and by 1926, the\nLeague of Nations was debating banning the practice as a form of slavery.\nAnthropologists objected. Really, they explained, this was nothing like the\npurchase of, say, an ox—let alone a pair of sandals. After all, if you buy an\nox, you don’t have any responsibilities _to_ the ox. What you are really\nbuying is the right to dispose of the ox in any way that pleases you. Marriage\nis entirely different, since a husband will normally have just as many\nresponsibilities toward his wife as his wife will have toward him. It’s a way\nof rearranging relations between people. Second of all, if you were really\nbuying a wife, you’d be able to sell her. Finally, the real significance of\nthe payment concerns the status of the woman’s children: if he’s buying\nanything, it’s the right to call her offspring his\nown.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts010)\n\nThe anthropologists ended up winning the argument, and “bride-price” was\ndutifully redubbed “bridewealth.” But they never really answered the question:\nWhat is actually happening here? When a Fijian suitor’s family presents a\nwhale tooth to ask for a woman’s hand in marriage, is this an advance payment\nfor the services the woman will provide in cultivating her future husband’s\ngardens? Or is he purchasing the future fertility of her womb? Or is this a\npure formality, the equivalent of the dollar that has to change hands in order\nto seal a contract? According to Rospabé, it’s none of these. The whale tooth,\nhowever valuable, is not a form of payment. It is really an acknowledgment\nthat one is asking for something so uniquely valuable that payment of any sort\nwould be impossible. The only appropriate payment for the gift of a woman is\nthe gift of another woman; in the meantime, all one can do is to acknowledge\nthe outstanding debt.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThere are places where suitors say this quite explicitly. Consider the Tiv of\nCentral Nigeria, who we have already met briefly in the last chapter. Most of\nour information on the Tiv comes from mid-century, when they were still under\nBritish colonial rule.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts011)\nEveryone at that time insisted that a proper marriage should take the form of\nan exchange of sisters. One man gives his sister in marriage to another, that\nman marries the sister of his newfound brother-in-law. This is the perfect\nmarriage because the only thing one can really give in exchange for a woman is\nanother woman.\n\nObviously, even if every family had exactly equal numbers of brothers and\nsisters, things couldn’t always work this neatly. Say I marry your sister but\nyou don’t want to marry mine (because, say, you don’t like her, or because\nshe’s only five years old). In that case, you become her “guardian,” which\nmeans you can claim the right to dispose of her in marriage to someone\nelse—for instance, someone whose sister you actually do wish to marry. This\nsystem quickly grew into a complex system in which most important men became\nguardians of numerous “wards,” often scattered over wide areas; they would\nswap and trade them and in the process accumulate numerous wives for\nthemselves, while less-fortunate men were only able to marry late in life, or\nnot at all.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts012)\n\nThere was one other expedient. The Tiv at that time used bundles of brass rods\nas their most prestigious form of currency. Brass rods were only held by men,\nand never used to buy things in markets (markets were dominated by women);\ninstead, they were exchanged only for things that men considered of higher\nimportance: cattle, horses, ivory, ritual titles, medical treatment, magical\ncharms. It was possible, as one Tiv ethnographer, Akiga Sai, explains, to\nacquire a wife with brass rods, but it required quite a lot of them. You would\nneed to give two or three bundles of them to her parents to establish yourself\nas a suitor; then, when you did finally make off with her (such marriages were\nalways first framed as elopements), another few bundles to assuage her mother\nwhen she showed up angrily demanding to know what was going on. This would\nnormally be followed by five more to get her guardian to at least temporarily\naccept the situation, and more still to her parents when she gave birth, if\nyou were to have any chance of their accepting your claims to be the father of\nher children. That might get her parents off your back, but you’d have to pay\noff the guardian forever, because you could never really use money to acquire\nthe rights to a woman. Everyone knew that the only thing you can legitimately\ngive in exchange for a woman is another woman. In this case, everyone has to\nabide by the pretext that a woman will someday be forthcoming. In the\nmeantime, as one ethnographer succinctly puts it, “the debt can never be fully\npaid.”[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts013)\n\nAccording to Rospabé, the Tiv are just making explicit the underlying logic of\nbridewealth everywhere. The suitor presenting bridewealth is never paying for\na woman, or even for the rights to claim her children. That would imply that\nbrass rods, or whale’s teeth, cowrie shells, or even cattle are somehow the\nequivalent of a human being, which by the logic of a human economy is\nobviously absurd. Only a human could ever be considered equivalent to another\nhuman. All the more so since, in the case of marriage, we are speaking of\nsomething even more valuable than one human life: we are speaking of a human\nlife that also has the capacity to generate new lives.\n\nCertainly, many of those who pay bridewealth are, like the Tiv, quite explicit\nabout all this. Bridewealth money is presented not to settle a debt, but as a\nkind of acknowledgment that there exists a debt that _cannot_ be settled by\nmeans of money. Often the two sides will maintain at least the polite fiction\nthat there will, someday, be a recompense in kind: that the suitor’s clan will\neventually provide one of its own women, perhaps even that very woman’s\ndaughter or granddaughter, to marry a man of the wife’s natal clan. Or maybe\nthere will be some arrangement about the disposition of her children; perhaps\nher clan will get to keep one for itself. The possibilities are endless.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nMoney, then, begins, as Rospabé himself puts it, “as a substitute for\nlife.”[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts014) One might call it\nthe recognition of a life-debt. This, in turn, explains why it’s invariably\nthe exact same kind of money that’s used to arrange marriages that is also\nused to pay wergeld (or “bloodwealth” as it’s sometimes also called): money\npresented to the family of a murder victim so as to prevent or resolve a\nblood-feud. Here the sources are even more explicit. On the one hand, one\npresents whale teeth or brass rods because the murderer’s kin recognize they\nowe a life to the victim’s family. On the other, whale teeth or brass rods are\nin no sense, and can never be, compensation for the loss of a murdered\nrelative. Certainly no one presenting such compensation would ever be foolish\nenough to suggest that any amount of money could possibly be the “equivalent”\nto the value of someone’s father, sister, or child.\n\nSo here again, money is first and foremost an acknowledgment that one owes\nsomething much more valuable than money.\n\nIn the case of a blood-feud, both parties will also be aware that even a\nrevenge killing, while at least it conforms to the principle of a life for a\nlife, won’t really compensate for the victim’s grief and pain either. This\nknowledge allows for some possibility of settling the matter without violence.\nBut even here, there is often a feeling that, as in the case of marriage, the\n_real_ solution to the problem is simply being temporarily postponed.\n\nAn illustration might be helpful. Among the Nuer, there is a special class of\npriestly figures who specialize in mediating feuds, referred to in the\nliterature as “leopard-skin chiefs.” If one man murders another, he will\nimmediately seek out one of their homesteads, since such a homestead is\ntreated as an inviolate sanctuary: even the dead man’s family, who will be\nhonor-bound to avenge the murder, will know that they cannot enter it, lest\nterrible consequences ensue. According to Evans-Pritchard’s classic account,\nthe chief will immediately start trying to negotiate a settlement between the\nmurderer and victim’s families, a delicate business, because the victim’s\nfamily will always first refuse:\n\nThe chief first finds out what cattle the slayer’s people possess and what\nthey are prepared to pay in compensation.… He then visits the dead man’s\npeople and asks them to accept cattle for the life. They usually refuse, for\nit is a point of honor to be obstinate, but their refusal does not mean that\nthey are unwilling to accept compensation. The chief knows this and insists on\ntheir acceptance, even threatening to curse them if they do not give way\n…[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts015)\n\nMore-distant kin weigh in, reminding everyone of their responsibility to the\nlarger community, of all the trouble that an outstanding feud will cause to\ninnocent relatives, and after a great show of holding out, insisting that it\nis insulting to suggest that any number of cattle could possibly substitute\nfor the life of a son or brother, they will usually grudgingly\naccept.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts016) In fact, even once\nthe matter has technically been settled, it really hasn’t—it usually takes\nyears to assemble the cattle, and even once they have been paid, the two sides\nwill avoid each other, “especially at dances, for in the excitement they\nengender, merely bumping into a man whose kinsman has been slain may cause a\nfight to break out, because the offense is never forgiven and the score must\nfinally be paid with a\nlife.”[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts017)\n\nSo it’s much the same as with bridewealth. Money does not wipe out the debt.\nOne life can only be paid for with another. At best those paying bloodwealth,\nby admitting the existence of the debt and insisting that they wish they could\npay it, even though they know this is impossible, can allow the matter to be\nplaced permanently on hold.\n\nHalfway around the world, one finds Lewis Henry Morgan describing the\nelaborate mechanisms set up by the Six Nations of the Iroquois to avoid\nprecisely this state of affairs. In the event one man killed another,\n\nImmediately on the commission of a murder, the affair was taken up by the\ntribes to which the parties belonged, and strenuous efforts were made to\neffect a reconciliation, lest private retaliation should lead to disastrous\nconsequences.\n\nThe first council ascertained whether the offender was willing to confess his\ncrime, and to make atonement. If he was, the council immediately sent a belt\nof white wampum, in his name, to the other council, which contained a message\nto that effect. The latter then endeavored to pacify the family of the\ndeceased, to quiet their excitement, and to induce them to accept the wampum\nas condonation.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts018)\n\nMuch as in the case of the Nuer, there were complicated schedules of exactly\nhow many fathoms of wampum were paid over, depending on the status of the\nvictim and the nature of the crime. As with the Nuer, too, everyone insisted\nthat this was _not_ payment. The value of the wampum in no sense represented\nthe value of the dead man’s life:\n\nThe present of white wampum was not in the nature of a compensation for the\nlife of the deceased, but of a regretful confession of the crime, with a\npetition for forgiveness. It was a peace-offering, the acceptance of which was\npressed by mutual friends …[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts019)\n\nActually, in many cases there was also some way to manipulate the system to\nturn payments meant to assuage one’s rage and grief into ways of creating a\nnew life that would in some sense substitute for the one that was lost. Among\nthe Nuer, forty cattle were set as the standard fee for bloodwealth. But it\nwas also the standard rate of bridewealth. The logic was this: if a man had\nbeen murdered before he was able to marry and produce offspring, it’s only\nnatural that his spirit would be angry. He had been, effectively, robbed of\nhis eternity. The best solution would be to use the cattle paid in settlement\nto acquire what was called a “ghost-wife”: a woman who would then be formally\nmarried to the dead man. In practice, she was usually paired off with one of\nthe victim’s brothers, but this was not particularly important; it didn’t\nreally matter too much who impregnated her, since he would be in no sense the\nfather of her children. Her children would be considered the children of the\nvictim’s ghost—and as a result, any boys among them were seen as having been\nborn with a particular commitment to someday avenge his\ndeath.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts020)\n\nThis latter is unusual. But Nuer appear to have been unusually stubborn about\nfeuds. Rospabé provides examples from other parts of the world that are even\nmore telling. Among North African Bedouins, for instance, it sometimes\nhappened that the only way to settle a feud was for the killer’s family to\nturn over a daughter, who would then marry the victim’s next of kin—his\nbrother, say. If she bore him a male child, the boy was given the same name as\nhis dead uncle and considered to be, at least in the broadest sense, a\nsubstitute for him.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts021) The\nIroquois, who traced descent in the female line, did not trade women in this\nfashion. However, they had another, more direct approach. If a man died—even\nof natural causes—his wife’s relatives might “put his name upon the mat,”\nsending off belts of wampum to commission a war party, which would then raid\nan enemy village to secure a captive. The captive could either be killed, or,\nif the clan matrons were in a benevolent mood (one could never tell; the grief\nof mourning is tricky), adopted: this was signified by throwing a belt of\nwampum around his shoulders, whereon he would be given the name of the\ndeceased and be considered, from that moment on, married to the victim’s wife,\nthe owner of his personal possessions, and in every way, effectively, the\nexact same person as the dead man used to\nbe.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts022)\n\nAll of this merely serves to underline Rospabé’s basic point, which is that\nmoney can be seen, in human economies, as first and foremost the\nacknowledgment of the existence of a debt that _cannot_ be paid.\n\nIn a way, it’s all very reminiscent of primordial-debt theory: money emerges\nfrom the recognition of an absolute debt to that which has given you life. The\ndifference is that instead of imagining such debts as between an individual\nand society, or perhaps the cosmos, here they are imagined as a kind of\nnetwork of dyadic relations: almost everyone in such societies was in a\nrelation of absolute debt to someone else. It’s not that we owe “society.” If\nthere is any notion of “society” here—and it’s not clear that there is—society\n_is_ our debts.\n\n## Blood Debts (Lele)\n\nObviously, this leads us to the same familiar problem: How does a token of\nrecognition that one cannot pay a debt turn into a form of payment by which a\ndebt can be extinguished? If anything, the problem seems even worse than it\nwas before.\n\nIn fact, it isn’t. The African evidence clearly shows how such things can\nhappen—though the answer is a bit unsettling. To demonstrate this, it will be\nnecessary to look at one or two African societies with a closer focus.\n\nI’ll start with the Lele, an African people who had, at the time that Mary\nDouglas studied them in the 1950s, managed to turn the principle of blood\ndebts into the organizing principle of their entire society.\n\nThe Lele were, at that time, a group of perhaps ten thousand souls, living on\na stretch of rolling country near the Kasai River in the Belgian Congo, and\nconsidered a rude backcountry folk by their richer and more cosmopolitan\nneighbors, the Kuba and Bushong. Lele women grew maize and manioc; the men\nthought of themselves as intrepid hunters but spent most of their time weaving\nand sewing raffia-palm cloth. This cloth was what the area was really known\nfor. It was not only used for every sort of clothing, but also exported: the\nLele considered themselves the clothiers of the region, and it was traded with\nsurrounding people to acquire luxuries. Internally, it functioned as a sort of\ncurrency. Still, it was not used in markets (there were no markets), and, as\nMary Douglas discovered to her great inconvenience, within a village, one\ncouldn’t use it to acquire food, tools, tableware, or really much of\nanything.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts023) It was the\nquintessential social currency.\n\nInformal gifts of raffia cloth smooth all social relations: husband to wife,\nson to mother, son to father. They resolve occasions of tension, as peace-\nofferings; they make parting gifts, or convey congratulations. There are also\nformal gifts of raffia which are neglected only at risk of rupture of the\nsocial ties involved. A man, on reaching adulthood, should give 20 cloths to\nhis father. Otherwise he would be ashamed to ask his father’s help for raising\nhis marriage dues. A man should give 20 cloths to his wife on each delivery of\na child …[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts024)\n\nCloth was also used for various fines and fees, and to pay curers. So for\ninstance, if a man’s wife reported a would-be seducer, it was customary to\nreward her with 20 cloths for her fidelity (it was not required, but not doing\nso was considered decidedly unwise); if an adulterer was caught, he was\nexpected to pay 50 or 100 cloths to the woman’s husband; if the husband and\nlover disturbed the peace of the village by fighting before the matter was\nsettled, each would have to pay two in compensation, and so forth.\n\nGifts tended to flow upward. Young people were always giving little presents\nof cloth as marks of respect to fathers, mothers, uncles, and the like. These\ngifts were hierarchical in nature: that is, it never occurred to those\nreceiving them that they should have to reciprocate in any way. As a result,\nelders, and especially elder men, usually had a few extra pieces lying around,\nand young men, who could never weave quite enough to meet their needs, would\nhave to turn to them whenever time for some major payment rolled around: for\ninstance, if they had to pay a major fine, or wished to hire a doctor to\nassist their wife in child-birth, or wanted to join a cult society. They were\nthus always slightly in debt, or at least slightly beholden, to their elders.\nBut everyone also had a whole range of friends and relatives who they had\nhelped out, and so could turn to for\nassistance.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts025)\n\nMarriage was particularly expensive, since the arrangements usually required\ngetting one’s hands on several bars of camwood. If raffia cloth was the small\nchange of social life, camwood—a rare imported wood used for the manufacture\nof cosmetics—was the high-denomination currency. A hundred raffia cloths were\nequivalent to three to five bars. Few individuals owned much in the way of\ncamwood, usually just little bits to grind up for their own use. Most was kept\nin each village’s collective treasury.\n\nThis is not to say that camwood was used for anything like bridewealth—rather,\nit was used in marriage negotiations, in which all sorts of gifts were passed\nback and forth. In fact, there was no bridewealth. Men could not use money to\nacquire women; nor could they use it to claim any rights over children. The\nLele were matrilineal. Children belonged not to their father’s clan, but to\ntheir mother’s.\n\nThere was another way that men gained control over women,\nhowever.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts026) This was the\nsystem of blood debts.\n\nIt is a common understanding among many traditional African peoples that human\nbeings do not simply die without a reason. If someone dies, someone must have\nkilled them. If a Lele woman died in childbirth, for example, this was assumed\nto be because she had committed adultery. The adulterer was thus responsible\nfor the death. Sometimes she would confess on her deathbed, otherwise the\nfacts of the matter would have to be established through divination. It was\nthe same if a baby died. If someone became sick, or slipped and fell while\nclimbing a tree, one would check to see if they had been involved in any\nquarrel that could be said to have caused the misfortune. If all else failed,\none could employ magical means to identify the sorcerer. Once the village was\nsatisfied that a culprit had been identified, that person owed a blood-debt:\nthat is, he owed the victim’s next of kin a human life. The culprit would thus\nhave to transfer over a young woman from his family, his sister or her\ndaughter, to be the victim’s ward, or “pawn.”\n\nAs with the Tiv, the system quickly became immensely complicated. Pawnship was\ninherited. If a woman was someone’s pawn, so would her children be, and so\nwould her daughters’ children. This meant that most males were also considered\nsomeone else’s man. Still, no one would accept a male pawn in payment of\nblood-debts: the whole point was to get hold of a young woman, who would then\ngo on to produce additional pawn children. Douglas’s Lele informants\nemphasized that any man would naturally want to have many of these as\npossible:\n\nAsk “Why do you want to have more pawns?” and they invariably say, “The\nadvantage of owning pawns is that if you incur a blood-debt, you can settle it\nby paying one of your pawns, and your own sisters remain free.” Ask, “Why do\nyou wish your own sisters to remain free?” and they reply, “Ah! then if I\nincur a blood-debt, I can settle it by giving one of them as a pawn …”\n\nEvery man is always aware that at any time he is liable for a blood-debt. If\nany woman he has seduced confesses his name in the throes of child-birth, and\nsubsequently dies, or if her child dies, or if anyone he has quarreled with\ndies of illness or accident, he may be held responsible … Even if a woman runs\naway from her husband, and fighting breaks out on her account, the deaths will\nbe laid at her door, and her brother or mother’s brother will have to pay up.\nSince only women are accepted as blood-compensation, and since compensation is\ndemanded for all deaths, of men as well as of women, it is obvious that there\ncan never be enough to go around. Men fall into arrears in their pawnship\nobligations, and girls used to be pledged before their birth, even before\ntheir mothers were of marriageable\nage.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts027)\n\nIn other words, the whole thing turned into an endlessly complicated chess\ngame—one reason, Douglas remarks, why the term “pawn” seems singularly\napropos. Just about every adult Lele male was both someone else’s pawn, and\nengaged in a constant game of securing, swapping, or redeeming pawns. Every\nmajor drama or tragedy of village life would ordinarily lead to a transfer of\nrights in women. Almost all of those women would eventually get swapped again.\n\nSeveral points need to be emphasized here. First of all, what were being\ntraded were, quite specifically, human lives. Douglas calls them “blood-\ndebts,” but “life-debts” would be more appropriate. Say, for instance, a man\nis drowning, and another man rescues him. Or say he’s deathly ill but a doctor\ncures him. In either case, we would likely say one man “owes his life” to the\nother. So would the Lele, but they meant it literally. Save someone’s life,\nthey owe you a life, and a life owed had to be paid back. The usual recourse\nwas for a man whose life was saved to turn over his sister as a pawn—or if not\nthat, a different woman; a pawn he had acquired from someone else.\n\nThe second point is that nothing could substitute for a human life.\n“Compensation was based on the principle of equivalence, a life for a life, a\nperson for a person.” Since the value of a human life was absolute, no amount\nof raffia cloth, or camwood bars, or goats, or transistor radios, or anything\nelse could possibly take its place.\n\nThe third and most important point is that in practice, “human life” actually\nmeant “woman’s life”—or even more specifically, “young woman’s life.”\nOstensibly this was to maximize one’s holdings: above all, one wished for a\nhuman being who could become pregnant and produce children, since those\nchildren would also be pawns. Still, even Mary Douglas, who was in no sense a\nfeminist, was forced to admit that the whole arrangement did seem to operate\nas if it were one gigantic apparatus for asserting male control over women.\nThis was true above all because women themselves could not own\npawns.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts028) They could only be\npawns. In other words: when it came to life-debts, only men could be either\ncreditors _or_ debtors. Young women were thus the credits and the debits—the\npieces being moved around the chessboard—while the hands that moved them were\ninvariably male.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts029)\n\nOf course, since almost everyone was a pawn, or had been at some point in\ntheir lives, being one could not in itself be much of a tragedy. For male\npawns it was in some ways quite advantageous, since one’s “owner” had to pay\nmost of one’s fines and fees and even blood-debts. This is why, as Douglas’s\ninformants uniformly insisted, pawnship had nothing in common with slavery.\nThe Lele did keep slaves, but never very many. Slaves were war captives,\nusually foreigners. As such they had no family, no one to protect them. To be\na pawn, on the other hand, meant to have not one, but two different families\nto look after you: you still had your own mother and her brothers, but now you\nalso had your “lord.”\n\nFor a woman, the very fact that she was the stakes in a game that all men were\nplaying afforded all sorts of opportunities to game the system. In principle,\na girl might be born a pawn, assigned to some man for eventual marriage. In\npractice, however,\n\na little Lele girl would grow up a coquette. From infancy she was the centre\nof affectionate, teasing, flirting attention. Her affianced husband never\ngained more than a very limited control over her … Since men competed with one\nanother for women there was scope for women to manoeuvre and intrigue. Hopeful\nseducers were never lacking and no woman doubted that she could get another\nhusband if it suited her.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts030)\n\nIn addition, a young Lele woman had one unique and powerful card to play.\nEveryone was well aware that, if she completely refused to countenance her\nsituation, she always had the option of becoming a “village-\nwife.”[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts031)\n\nThe institution of village-wife was a peculiarly Lele one. Probably the best\nway to describe it is to imagine a hypothetical case. Let us say that an old,\nimportant man acquires a young woman as pawn through a blood-debt, and he\ndecides to marry her himself. Technically, he has the right to do so, but it’s\nno fun for a young woman to be an old man’s third or fourth wife. Or, say he\ndecides to offer her in marriage to one of his male pawns in a village far\naway from her mother and natal home. She protests. He ignores her\nprotestations. She waits for an opportune moment and slips off at night to an\nenemy village, where she asks for sanctuary. This is always possible: all\nvillages have their traditional enemies. Neither would an enemy village refuse\na woman who came to them in such a situation. They would immediately declare\nher “wife of the village,” who all men living there would then be obliged to\nprotect.\n\nIt helps to understand that here, as in many parts of Africa, most older men\nhad several wives. This meant that the pool of women available for younger men\nwas considerably reduced. As our ethnographer explains, the imbalance was a\nsource of considerable sexual tension:\n\nEveryone recognized that the young unmarried men coveted the wives of their\nseniors. Indeed, one of their pastimes was to plan seductions and the man who\nboasted of none was derided. Since the old men wished to remain polygynists,\nwith two or three wives, and since adulteries were thought to disrupt the\npeace of the village, Lele had to make some arrangement to appease their\nunmarried men.\n\nTherefore, when a sufficient number of them reached the age of eighteen or so,\nthey were allowed to buy the right to a common\nwife.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts032)\n\nAfter paying an appropriate fee in raffia cloth to the village treasury, they\nwere permitted to build a collective house, and then they were either allotted\na wife to put in it, or allowed to form a party that would try to steal one\nfrom a rival village. (Or, alternately, if one showed up as a refugee, they\nwould ask the rest of the village for the right to accept her: this was\ninvariably granted.) This common wife is what’s referred to as a “village\nwife.” The position of village wife was more than respectable. In fact, a\nnewly married village wife was treated very much like a princess. She was not\nexpected to plant or weed in the gardens, fetch wood or water, or even to\ncook; all household chores were done by her eager young husbands, who provided\nthe best of everything, spending much of their time hunting in the forest\nvying to bring her the choicest delicacies, or plying her with palm wine. She\ncould help herself to others’ possessions and was expected to make all sorts\nof mischief to the bemused indulgence of all concerned. She was also expected\nto make herself sexually available to all members of the age-set—perhaps ten\nor twelve different men—at first, pretty much whenever they wanted\nher.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts033)\n\nOver time, a village wife would usually settle down with just three or four of\nher husbands, and finally, just one. The domestic arrangements were flexible.\nNonetheless, in principle, she was married to the village as a whole. If she\nhad children, the village was considered to be their father, and as such\nexpected to bring them up, provide them with resources, and eventually, get\nthem properly married off—which is why villages had to maintain collective\ntreasuries full of raffia and camwood bars in the first place. Since at any\ntime a village was likely to have several village wives, it would also have\nits own children and grandchildren, and therefore be in a position to both\ndemand and pay blood-debts, and thus, to accumulate pawns.\n\nAs a result, villages became corporate bodies, collective groups that, like\nmodern corporations, had to be treated as if they were individuals for\npurposes of law. However there was one key difference. Unlike ordinary\nindividuals, villages could back up their claims with force.\n\nAs Douglas emphasizes, this was crucial, because ordinary Lele men were simply\nnot able to do this to one\nanother.[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts034) In everyday\naffairs, there was an almost complete lack of any systematic means of\ncoercion. This was the main reason, she notes, that pawnship was so innocuous.\nThere were all sorts of rules, but with no government, no courts, no judges to\nmake authoritative decisions, no group of armed men willing or able to employ\nthe threat of force to back those decisions up, rules were there to be\nadjusted and interpreted. In the end, everyone’s feelings had to be taken into\naccount. In everyday affairs, Lele put great stock on gentle and agreeable\nbehavior. Men might have been regularly seized with the urge to throw\nthemselves at each other in fits of jealous rage (often they had good reason\nto), but they very rarely did. And if a fight did break out, everyone would\nimmediately jump in to break it up and submit the affair to public\nmediation.[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts035)\n\nVillages, in contrast, were fortified, and age-sets could be mobilized to act\nas military units. Here, and only here, did organized violence enter the\npicture. True, when villages fought, it was also always over women (everyone\nDouglas talked to expressed incredulity at the very idea that grown men,\nanywhere, could ever come to blows over anything else). But in the case of\nvillages, it could come to an actual war. If another village’s elders ignored\none’s claims to a pawn, one’s young men might organize a raiding party and\nkidnap her, or carry off some other likely young women to be their collective\nwife. This might lead to deaths, and to further claims for compensation.\n“Since it had the backing of force,” Douglas observes drily, “the village\ncould afford to be less conciliatory towards the wishes of its\npawns.”[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts036)\n\nIt’s at exactly this point, too, where the potential for violence enters, that\nthe great wall constructed between the value of lives and money can suddenly\ncome tumbling down.\n\nSometimes when two clans were disputing a claim to blood compensation, the\nclaimant might see no hope of getting satisfaction from his opponents. The\npolitical system offered no direct means for one man (or clan) to use physical\ncoercion or to resort to superior authority to enforce claims against another.\nIn such a case, rather than abandon his claim to a pawn-woman, he would be\nready to take the equivalent in wealth, if he could get it. The usual\nprocedure was to sell his case against the defendants to the only group\ncapable of extorting a pawn by force, that is, to a village.\n\nThe man who meant to sell his case to a village asked them for 100 raffia\ncloths or five bars of camwood. The village raised the amount, either from its\ntreasury, or by a loan from one of its members, and thereby adopted as its own\nhis claim to a pawn.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts037)\n\nOnce he held the money, his claim was over, and the village, which had now\nbought it, would proceed to organize a raid to seize the woman in dispute.\n\nIn other words, it was _only_ when violence was brought into the equation that\nthere was any question of buying and selling people. The ability to deploy\nforce, to cut through the endless maze of preferences, obligations,\nexpectations, and responsibilities that mark real human relationships, also\nmade it possible to overcome what is otherwise the first rule of all Lele\neconomic relationships: that human lives can only be exchanged for other human\nlives, and never for physical objects. Significantly, the amount paid—a\nhundred cloths, or an equivalent amount of camwood—was also the price of a\nslave.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts038) Slaves were, as I\nmentioned, war captives. There seem never to have been very many of them;\nDouglas only managed to locate two descendants of slaves in the 1950s, some\ntwenty-five years after the practice had been\nabolished.[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts039) Still, the\nnumbers were not important. The mere fact of their existence set a precedent.\nThe value of a human life could, sometimes, be quantified; but if one was able\nto move from A = A (one life equals another) to A = B (one life = one hundred\ncloths), it was only because the equation was established at the point of a\nspear.\n\n## Flesh-Debt (Tiv)\n\nI have dwelt on the Lele in such detail in part because I wanted to convey\nsome sense of why I was using the term “human economy,” what life is like\ninside one, what sort of dramas fill people’s days, and how money typically\noperates in the midst of all this. Lele currencies are, as I say,\nquintessential social currencies. They are used to mark every visit, every\npromise, every important moment in a man’s or woman’s life. It is surely\nsignificant, too, what the objects used as currency here actually were. Raffia\ncloth was used for clothing. In Douglas’s day, it was the main thing used to\nclothe the human body; camwood bars were the source of a red paste that was\nused as a cosmetic—it was the main substance used as makeup, by both men and\nwomen, to beautify themselves each day. These, then, were the materials used\nto shape people’s physical appearance, to make them appear mature, decent,\nattractive, and dignified to their fellows. They were what turned a mere naked\nbody into a proper social being.\n\nThis is no coincidence. In fact, it’s extraordinarily common in what I’ve been\ncalling human economies. Money almost always arises first from objects that\nare used primarily as adornment of the person. Beads, shells, feathers, dog or\nwhale teeth, gold, and silver are all well-known cases in point. All are\nuseless for any purpose other than making people look more interesting, and\nhence, more beautiful. The brass rods used by the Tiv might seem an exception,\nbut actually they’re not: they were used mainly as raw material for the\nmanufacture of jewelry, or simply twisted into hoops and worn at dances. There\nare exceptions (cattle, for instance), but as a general rule, it’s only when\ngovernments, and then markets, enter the picture that we begin to see\ncurrencies like barley, cheese, tobacco, or\nsalt.[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts040)\n\nIt also illustrates the peculiar progression of ideas that so often mark human\neconomies. On the one hand, human life is the absolute value. There is no\npossible equivalent. Whether a life is given or taken, the debt is absolute.\nIn places, this principle is indeed sacrosanct. More often, it is compromised\nby the elaborate games played by the Tiv, who treat the giving of lives, and\nthe Lele, who treat the taking of lives, as creating debts that can only be\npaid by delivering another human being. In each case, too, the practice ends\nup engendering an extraordinarily complex game in which important men end up\nexchanging women, or at least, rights over their fertility.\n\nBut this is already a kind of opening. Once the game exists, once the\nprinciple of substitution comes in, there was always the possibility of\nextending it. When that begins to happen, systems of debt that were premised\non creating people can—even here—suddenly become the means of destroying them.\n\nAs an example, let us once again return to the Tiv. The reader will recall\nthat if a man did not have a sister or a ward to give in exchange for one’s\nwife, it was possible to assuage her parents and guardians by gifts of money.\nHowever, such a wife would never be considered truly his. Here too, there was\none dramatic exception. A man could buy a slave, a woman kidnapped in a raid\nfrom a distant country.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts041)\nSlaves, after all, had no parents, or could be treated as if they didn’t; they\nhad been forcibly removed from all those networks of mutual obligation and\ndebt in which ordinary people acquired their outward identities. This was why\nthey could be bought and sold.\n\nOnce married, though, a purchased wife would quickly develop new ties. She was\nno longer a slave, and her children were perfectly legitimate—more so, in\nfact, than those of a wife who was merely acquired through the continual\npayment of brass rods.\n\nWe have perhaps a general principle: to make something saleable, in a human\neconomy, one needs to first rip it from its context. That’s what slaves are:\npeople stolen from the community that made them what they are. As strangers to\ntheir new communities, slaves no longer had mothers, fathers, kin of any sort.\nThis is why they could be bought and sold or even killed: because the _only_\nrelation they had was to their owners. A Lele village’s ability to organize\nraids and kidnap a woman from an alien community seems to have been the key to\nits ability to start trading women for money—even if in their case, they could\ndo so only to a very limited extent. After all, her relatives were not very\nfar away, and they would surely come around demanding an explanation. In the\nend, someone would have to come up with an arrangement that everyone could\nlive with.[42](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts042)\n\nStill, I would also insist that there is something more than this. One gets\nthe distinct sense, in much of the literature, that many African societies\nwere haunted by the awareness that these elaborate networks of debt could, if\nthings went just slightly wrong, be transformed into something absolutely\nterrible. The Tiv are a dramatic case in point.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nAmong students of anthropology, the Tiv are mainly famous for the fact that\ntheir economic life was divided into what their best-known ethnographers, Paul\nand Laura Bohannan, referred to as three separate “spheres of exchange.”\nOrdinary, everyday economic activity was mostly the affair of women. They were\nthe ones who filled the markets, and who trod the paths giving and returning\nminor gifts of okra, nuts, or fish. Men concerned themselves with what they\nconsidered higher things: the kind of transactions that could be conducted\nusing the Tiv currency, which, as with the Lele, consisted of two\ndenominations, a kind of locally made cloth called _tugudu_ , widely exported,\nand, for major transactions, bundles of imported brass\nrods.[43](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts043) These could be used\nto acquire certain flashy and luxurious things (cows, purchased foreign\nwives), but they were mainly for the give and take of political affairs,\nhiring curers, acquiring magic, gaining initiation into cult societies. In\npolitical matters, Tiv were even more resolutely egalitarian than the Lele:\nsuccessful old men with their numerous wives might have lorded it over their\nsons and other dependants within their own house compounds, but beyond that,\nthere was no formal political organization of any sort. Finally, there was the\nsystem of wards, which consisted entirely of men’s rights in women. Hence, the\nnotion of “spheres.” In principle, these three levels—ordinary consumption\ngoods, masculine prestige goods, and rights in women—were completely separate.\nNo amount of okra could get you a brass rod, just as, in principle, no number\nof brass rods could give you full rights to a woman.\n\nIn practice, there were ways to game the system. Say a neighbor was sponsoring\na feast but was short on supplies; one might come to his aid, then later,\ndiscreetly, ask for a bundle or two in repayment. To be able to wheel and\ndeal, to “turn chickens into cows,” as the saying went, and ultimately, broker\none’s wealth and prestige into a way of acquiring wives, required a “strong\nheart”—that is, an enterprising and charismatic\npersonality.[44](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts044) But “strong\nheart” had another meaning too. There was believed to be a certain actual\nbiological substance called _tsav_ that grew on the human heart. This was what\ngave certain people their charm, their energy, and their powers of persuasion.\n_Tsav_ therefore was both a physical substance and that invisible power that\nallows certain people to bend others to their\nwill.[45](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts045)\n\nThe problem was—and most Tiv of that time appear to have believed that this\nwas _the_ problem with their society—that it was also possible to augment\none’s _tsav_ through artificial means, and this could only be accomplished by\nconsuming human flesh.\n\nNow, I should emphasize right away that there is no reason to believe that any\nTiv actually did practice cannibalism. The idea of eating human flesh appears\nto have disgusted and horrified them as much as it would most Americans. Yet\nfor centuries, most appear to have been veritably obsessed by the suspicion\nthat some of their neighbors—and particularly prominent men who became de\nfacto political leaders—were, in fact, secret cannibals. Men who built up\ntheir _tsav_ by such means, the stories went, attained extraordinary powers:\nthe ability to fly, to become impervious to weapons, to be able to send out\ntheir souls at night to kill their victims in such a way that their victims\ndid not even know that they were dead, but would wander about, confused and\nfeckless, to be harvested for their cannibal feasts. They became, in short,\nterrifying witches.[46](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts046)\n\nThe _mbatsav_ , or society of witches, was always looking for new members, and\nthe way to accomplish this was to trick people into eating human flesh. A\nwitch would take a piece of the body of one of his own close relatives, who he\nhad murdered, and place it in the victim’s food. If the man was foolish enough\nto eat it, he would contract a “flesh-debt,” and the society of witches\nensured that flesh-debts are always paid.\n\nPerhaps your friend, or some older man, has noticed that you have a large\nnumber of children, or brothers and sisters, and so tricks you into\ncontracting the debt with him. He invites you to eat food in his house alone\nwith him, and when you begin the meal he sets before you two dishes of sauce,\none of which contains cooked human flesh …\n\nIf you eat from the wrong dish, but you do not have a “strong heart”—the\npotential to become a witch—you will become sick and flee from the house in\nterror. But if you have that hidden potential, the flesh will begin to work in\nyou. That evening, you will find your house surrounded by screeching cats and\nowls. Strange noises will fill the air. Your new creditor will appear before\nyou, backed by his confederates in evil. He will tell of how he killed his own\nbrother so you two could dine together, and pretend to be tortured by the\nthought of having lost his own kin as you sit there, surrounded by your plump\nand healthy relatives. The other witches will concur, acting as if all this is\nyour own fault. “You have sought for trouble, and trouble has come upon you.\nCome and lie down on the ground, that we may cut your\nthroat.”[47](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts047)\n\nThere’s only one way out, and that’s to pledge a member of your own family as\nsubstitute. This is possible, because you will find you have terrible new\npowers, but they must be used as the other witches demand. One by one, you\nmust kill off your brothers, sisters, children; their bodies will be stolen\nfrom their graves by the college of witches, brought back to life just long\nenough to be properly fattened, tortured, killed again, then carved and\nroasted for yet another feast.\n\nThe flesh debt goes on and on. The creditor keeps on coming. Unless the debtor\nhas men behind him who are very strong in _tsav_ , he cannot free himself from\nthe flesh debt until he has given up all his people, and his family is\nfinished. Then he goes himself and lies down on the ground to be slaughtered,\nand so the debt is finally\ndischarged.[48](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts048)\n\n## The Slave Trade\n\nIn one sense, it’s obvious what’s going on here. Men with “strong hearts” have\npower and charisma; using it, they can manipulate debt to turn extra food into\ntreasures, and treasures into wives, wards, and daughters, and thus become the\nheads of ever-growing families. But that very power and charisma that allows\nthem to do this also makes them run the constant danger of sending the whole\nprocess jolting back into a kind of horrific implosion, of creating flesh-\ndebts whereby one’s family is converted back into food.\n\nNow, if one is simply trying to imagine the worst thing that could possibly\nhappen to someone, surely, being forced to dine on the mutilated corpses of\none’s own children would, anywhere, be pretty high on the list. Still,\nanthropologists have come to understand, over the years, that every society is\nhaunted by slightly different nightmares, and these differences are\nsignificant. Horror stories, whether about vampires, ghouls, or flesh-eating\nzombies, always seem to reflect some aspect of the tellers’ own social lives,\nsome terrifying potential, in the way they are accustomed to interact with\neach other, that they do not wish to acknowledge or confront, but also cannot\nhelp but talk about.[49](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts049)\n\nIn the Tiv case, what would that be? Clearly, Tiv did have a major problem\nwith authority. They lived in a landscape dotted with compounds, each\norganized around a single older man with his numerous wives, children, and\nassorted hangers-on. Within each compound, that man had near-absolute\nauthority. Outside there was no formal political structure, and Tiv were\nfiercely egalitarian. In other words: all men aspired to become the masters of\nlarge families, but they were extremely suspicious of any form of mastery.\nHardly surprising, then, that Tiv men were so ambivalent about the nature of\npower that they became convinced that the very qualities that allow a man to\nrise to legitimate prominence could, if taken just a little bit further, turn\nhim into a monster.[50](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts050) In\nfact, most Tiv seemed to assume that most male elders _were_ witches, and that\nif a young person died, they were probably being paid off for a flesh-debt.\n\nBut this still doesn’t answer the one obvious question: Why is all this framed\nin terms of debt?\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nHere a little history is in order. It would appear that the ancestors of the\nTiv arrived in the Benue river valley and adjacent lands sometime around\n1750—a time when all of what’s now Nigeria was being torn apart by the\nAtlantic slave trade. Early stories relate how the Tiv, during their\nmigrations, used to paint their wives and children with what looked like\nsmallpox scars, so that potential raiders would be afraid to carry them\noff.[51](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts051) They established\nthemselves in a notoriously inaccessible stretch of country and offered up\nferocious defense against periodic raids from neighboring kingdoms to their\nnorth and west—with which they eventually came to a political\nrapprochement.[52](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts052)\n\nThe Tiv, then, were well aware of what was happening all around them.\nConsider, for example, the case of the copper bars whose use they were so\ncareful to restrict, so as to avoid their becoming an allpurpose form of\ncurrency.\n\nNow, copper bars had been used for money in this part of Africa for centuries,\nand at least in some places, for ordinary commercial transactions, as well. It\nwas easy enough to do: one simply snapped them apart into smaller pieces, or\npulled some of them into thin wires, twisted those around to little loops, and\none had perfectly serviceable small change for everyday market\ntransactions.[53](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts053) Most of the\nones current in Tivland since the late eighteenth century, on the other hand,\nwere mass-produced in factories in Birmingham and imported through the port of\nOld Calabar at the mouth of the Cross River, by slave-traders based in\nLiverpool and Bristol.[54](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts054) In\nall the country adjoining the Cross River—that is, in the region directly to\nthe south of the Tiv territory—copper bars were used as everyday currency.\nThis was presumably how they entered Tivland; they were either carried in by\npedlars from the Cross River or acquired by Tiv traders on expeditions abroad.\nAll this, however, makes the fact that the Tiv refused to use copper bars as\nsuch a currency doubly significant.\n\nDuring the 1760s alone, perhaps a hundred thousand Africans were shipped down\nthe Cross River to Calabar and nearby ports, where they were put in chains,\nplaced on British, French, or other European ships, and shipped across the\nAtlantic—part of perhaps a million and a half exported from the Bight of\nBiafra during the whole period of the Atlantic slave\ntrade.[55](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts055) Some of them had\nbeen captured in wars or raids, or simply kidnapped. The majority, though,\nwere carried off because of debts.\n\nHere, though, I must explain something about the organization of the slave\ntrade.\n\nThe Atlantic Slave Trade as a whole was a gigantic network of credit\narrangements. Ship-owners based in Liverpool or Bristol would acquire goods on\neasy credit terms from local wholesalers, expecting to make good by selling\nslaves (also on credit) to planters in the Antilles and America, with\ncommission agents in the city of London ultimately financing the affair\nthrough the profits of the sugar and tobacco\ntrade.[56](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts056) Ship-owners would\nthen transport their wares to African ports like Old Calabar. Calabar itself\nwas the quintessential mercantile city-state, dominated by rich African\nmerchants who dressed in European clothes, lived in European-style houses, and\nin some cases even sent their children to England to be educated.\n\nOn arrival, European traders would negotiate the value of their cargoes in the\ncopper bars that served as the currency of the port. In 1698, a merchant\naboard a ship called the _Dragon_ noted the following prices he managed to\nestablish for his wares:\n\none bar iron | 4 copper bars  \n---|---  \none bunch of beads | 4 copper bars  \nfive rangoes[57](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts057) | 4 copper bars  \none basin No. 1 | 4 copper bars  \none tankard | 3 copper bars  \none yard linen | 1 copper bar  \nsix knives | 1 copper bar  \none brass bell No. 1 | 3 copper bars[58](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts058)  \n  \nBy the height of the trade fifty years later, British ships were bringing in\nlarge quantities of cloth (both products of the newly created Manchester mills\nand calicoes from India), and iron and copper ware, along with incidental\ngoods like beads, and also, for obvious reasons, substantial numbers of\nfirearms.[59](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts059) The goods were\nthen advanced to African merchants, again on credit, who assigned them to\ntheir own agents to move upstream.\n\nThe obvious problem was how to secure the debt. The trade was an\nextraordinarily duplicitous and brutal business, and slave raiders were\nunlikely to be dependable credit risks—especially when dealing with foreign\nmerchants who they might never see\nagain.[60](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts060) As a result, a\nsystem quickly developed in which European captains would demand security in\nthe form of pawns.\n\nThe sort of “pawns” we are talking about here are clearly quite different from\nthe kind we encountered among the Lele. In many of the kingdoms and trading\ntowns of West Africa, the nature of pawnship appears to have already undergone\nprofound changes by the time Europeans showed up on the scene around 1500—it\nhad become, effectively, a kind of debt peonage. Debtors would pledge family\nmembers as surety for loans; the pawns would then become dependents in the\ncreditors’ households, working their fields and tending to their household\nchores—their persons acting as security while their labor, effectively,\nsubstituted for interest.[61](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts061)\nPawns were not slaves; they were not, like slaves, cut off from their\nfamilies; but neither were they precisely\nfree.[62](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts062) In Calabar and other\nports, masters of slaving ships, on advancing goods to their African\ncounterparts, soon developed the custom of demanding pawns as security—for\ninstance, two of the merchants’ own dependents for every three slaves to be\ndelivered, preferably including at least one member of the merchants’\nfamilies.[63](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts063) This was in\npractice not much different than demanding the surrender of hostages, and at\ntimes it created major political crises when captains, tired of waiting for\ndelayed shipments, decided to take off with a cargo of pawns instead.\n\nUpriver, debt pawns also played a major part in the trade. In one way, the\narea was a bit unusual. In most of West Africa, the trade ran through major\nkingdoms such as Dahomey or Asante to make wars and impose draconian\npunishments—one very common expedient for rulers was to manipulate the justice\nsystem, so that almost any crime came to be punishable by enslavement, or by\ndeath with the enslavement of one’s wife and children, or by outrageously high\nfines which, if one could not pay them, would cause the defaulter and his\nfamily to be sold as slaves. In another way, it is unusually revealing, since\nthe lack of any larger government structures made it easier to see what was\nreally happening. The pervasive climate of violence led to the systematic\nperversion of all the institutions of existing human economies, which were\ntransformed into a gigantic apparatus of dehumanization and destruction.\n\nIn the Cross River region, the trade seems to have seen two phases. The first\nwas a period of absolute terror and utter chaos, in which raids were frequent,\nand anyone traveling alone risked being kidnapped by roving gangs of thugs and\nsold to Calabar. Before long, villages lay abandoned; many people fled into\nthe forest; men would have to form armed parties to work the\nfields.[64](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts064) This period was\nrelatively brief. The second began when representatives of local merchant\nsocieties began to establish themselves in communities up and down the region,\noffering to restore order. The most famous of these was the Aro Confederacy,\nwho called themselves, “Children of\nGod.”[65](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts065) Backed by heavily\narmed mercenaries and the prestige of their famous Oracle at Arochukwu, they\nestablished a new and notoriously harsh justice\nsystem.[66](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts066) Kidnappers were\nhunted down and themselves sold as slaves. Safety was restored to roads and\nfarmsteads. At the same time, Aro collaborated with local elders to create a\ncode of ritual laws and penalties so comprehensive and severe that everyone\nwas at constant risk of falling afoul of\nthem.[67](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts067) Anyone who violated\none would be turned over to the Aro for transport to the coast, with their\naccuser receiving their price in copper\nbars.[68](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts068) According to some\ncontemporary accounts, a man who simply disliked his wife and was in need of\nbrass rods could always come up with some reason to sell her, and the village\nelders—who received a share of the profits—would almost invariably\nconcur.[69](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts069) The most ingenious\ntrick of the merchant societies, though, was to assist in the dissemination of\na secret society, called Ekpe. Ekpe was most famous for sponsoring magnificent\nmasquerades and for initiating its members into arcane mysteries, but it also\nacted as a secret mechanism for the enforcement of\ndebts.[70](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts070) In Calabar itself,\nfor example, the Ekpe society had access to a whole range of sanctions,\nstarting with boycotts (all members were forbidden to conduct trade with a\ndefaulting debtor), fines, seizure of property, arrest, and finally,\nexecution—with the most hapless victims left tied to trees, their lower jaws\nremoved, as a warning to\nothers.[71](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts071) It was ingenious,\nparticularly, because such societies always allowed anyone to buy in, rising\nthough the nine initiatory grades if they could pay the fee—these also\nexacted, of course, in the brass rods the merchants themselves supplied. In\nCalabar, the fee schedule for each grade looked like\nthis:[72](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts072)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_002_r1.jpg)\n\nIn other words, it was quite expensive. But membership quickly became the\nchief mark of honor and distinction everywhere. Entry fees were no doubt less\nexorbitant in small, distant communities, but the effect was still the same:\nthousands ended up in debt to the merchants, whether for the fees required for\njoining, or for the trade goods they supplied (mostly cloth and metal put to\nuse creating the gear and costumes for the Ekpe performances—debts that they\nthus themselves became responsible for enforcing on themselves. These debts,\ntoo, were regularly paid in people, ostensibly yielded up as pawns.)\n\nHow did it work in practice? It appears to have varied a great deal from place\nto place. In the Afikpo district, on a remote part of the upper Cross River,\nfor instance, we read that everyday affairs—the acquisition of food, for\nexample—was conducted, as among the Tiv, “without trade or the use of money.”\nBrass rods, supplied by the merchant societies, were used to buy and sell\nslaves, but otherwise mostly as a social currency, “used for gifts and for\npayments in funerals, titles, and other\nceremonies.”[73](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts073) Most of those\npayments, titles, and ceremonies were tied to the secret societies that the\nmerchants had also brought to the area. All this does sound a bit like the Tiv\narrangement, but the presence of the merchants ensured that the effects were\nvery different:\n\nIn the old days, if anybody got into trouble or debt in the upper parts of the\nCross River, and wanted ready money, he used generally to “pledge” one or more\nof his children, or some other members of his family or household, to one of\nthe Akunakuna traders who paid periodical visits to his village. Or he would\nmake a raid on some neighboring village, seize a child, and sell him or her to\nthe same willing purchaser.[74](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts074)\n\nThe passage only makes sense if one recognizes that debtors were also, owing\nto their membership in the secret societies, collectors. The seizing of a\nchild is a reference to the local practice of “panyarring,” current throughout\nWest Africa, by which creditors despairing of repayment would simply sweep\ninto the debtor’s community with a group of armed men and seize\nanything—people, goods, domestic animals—that could be easily carried off,\nthen hold it hostage as\nsecurity.[75](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts075) It didn’t matter\nif the people or goods had belonged to the debtor, or even the debtor’s\nrelatives. A neighbor’s goats or children would do just as well, since the\nwhole point was to bring social pressure on whoever owed the money. As William\nBosman put it, “If the Debtor be an honest man and the Debt just, he\nimmediately endeavours by the satisfaction of his Creditors to free his\nCountrymen.”[76](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts076) It was\nactually a quite sensible expedient in an environment with no central\nauthority, where people tended to feel an enormous sense of responsibility\ntoward other members of their community and very little responsibility toward\nanyone else. In the case of the secret society cited above, the debtor would,\npresumably, be calling in his own debts—real or imagined—to those outside the\norganization, in order not to have to send off members of his own\nfamily.[77](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts077)\n\nSuch expedients were not always effective. Often debtors would be forced to\npawn more and more of their own children or dependents, until finally there\nwas no recourse but to pawn\nthemselves.[78](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts078) And of course,\nat the height of the slave trade, “pawning” had become little more than a\neuphemism. The distinction between pawns and slaves had largely disappeared.\nDebtors, like their families before them, ended up turned over to the Aro,\nthen to the British, and finally, shackled and chained, crowded into tiny\nslaving vessels and sent off to be sold on plantations across the\nsea.[79](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts079)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIf the Tiv, then, were haunted by the vision of an insidious secret\norganization that lured unsuspecting victims into debt traps, whereby they\nthemselves became the enforcers of debts to be paid with the bodies of their\nchildren, and ultimately, themselves—one reason was because this was,\nliterally happening to people who lived a few hundred miles away. Nor is the\nuse of the phrase “flesh-debt” in any way inappropriate. Slave-traders might\nnot have been reducing their victims to meat, but they were certainly reducing\nthem to nothing more than bodies. To be a slave was to be plucked from one’s\nfamily, kin, friends, and community, stripped of one’s name, identity, and\ndignity; of everything that made one a person rather than a mere human machine\ncapable of understanding orders. Neither were most slaves offered much\nopportunity to develop enduring human relations. Most that ended up in\nCaribbean or American plantations, though, were simply worked to death.\n\nWhat is remarkable is that all this was done, the bodies extracted, through\nthe very mechanisms of the human economy, premised on the principle that human\nlives are the ultimate value, to which nothing could possibly compare.\nInstead, all the same institutions—fees for initiations, means of calculating\nguilt and compensation, social currencies, debt pawnship—were turned into\ntheir opposite; the machinery was, as it were, thrown into reverse; and, as\nthe Tiv also perceived, the gears and mechanisms designed for the creation of\nhuman beings collapsed on themselves and became the means for their\ndestruction.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nI do not want to leave the reader with the impression that what I am\ndescribing here is in any way peculiar to Africa. One could find the exact\nsame things happening wherever human economies came into contact with\ncommercial ones (and particularly, commercial economies with advanced military\ntechnology and an insatiable demand for human labor).\n\nRemarkably similar things can be observed throughout Southeast Asia,\nparticularly amongst hill and island people living on the fringes of major\nkingdoms. As the premier historian of the region, Anthony Reid, has pointed\nout, labor throughout Southeast Asia has long been organized above all through\nrelations of debt bondage.\n\nEven in relatively simple societies little penetrated by money, there were\nritual needs for substantial expenditures—the payment of bride-price for\nmarriage and the slaughter of a buffalo at the death of a family member. It is\nwidely reported that such ritual needs are the most common reason why the poor\nbecome indebted to the rich\n…[80](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts080)\n\nFor instance, one practice, noted from Thailand to Sulawesi, is for a group of\npoor brothers to turn to a rich sponsor to pay for the expenses of one\nbrother’s marriage. He’s then referred to as their “master.” This is more like\na patron-client relation than anything else: the brothers might be obliged to\ndo the occasional odd job, or appear as his entourage on occasions when he has\nto make a good impression—not much more. Still, technically, he owns their\nchildren, and “can also repossess the wife he provided if his bondsmen fail to\ncarry out his obligations.”[81](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts081)\n\nElsewhere, we hear similar stories to those in Africa—of peasants pawning\nthemselves or members of their families, or even gambling themselves into\nbondage; of principalities where penalties invariably took the form of heavy\nfines. “Frequently, of course, these fines could not be paid, and the\ncondemned man, often accompanied by his dependants, became the bondsman of the\nruler, of the injured party, or of whoever was able to pay his fine for\nhim.”[82](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts082) Reid insists that\nmost of this was relatively innocuous—in fact, poor men might take out loans\nfor the express purpose of becoming debtors to some wealthy patron, who could\nprovide them with food during hard times, a roof, a wife. Clearly this was not\n“slavery” in the ordinary sense. That is, unless the patron decided to ship\nsome of his dependents off to creditors of his own in some distant city like\nMajapahit or Ternate, whereupon they might find themselves toiling in some\ngrandee’s kitchen or pepper plantation like any other slave.\n\nIt’s important to point this out because one of the effects of the slave trade\nis that people who don’t actually live in Africa are often left with an image\nof that continent as an irredeemably violent, savage place—an image that has\nhad disastrous effects on those who do live there. It might be fitting, then,\nto consider the history of one place that is usually represented as the polar\nopposite: Bali, the famous “land of ten thousand temples”—an island often\npictured in anthropological texts and tourist brochures as if it were\ninhabited exclusively by placid, dreamy artists who spend their days arranging\nflowers and practicing synchronized dance routines.\n\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Bali had not yet obtained this\nreputation. At the time, it was still divided among a dozen tiny, squabbling\nkingdoms in an almost perpetual state of war. In fact, its reputation among\nthe Dutch merchants and officials ensconced in nearby Java was almost exactly\nthe opposite of what it is today. Balinese were considered a rude and violent\npeople ruled by decadent, opium-addicted nobles whose wealth was based almost\nexclusively on their willingness to sell their subjects to foreigners as\nslaves. By the time the Dutch were fully in control in Java, Bali had been\nturned largely into a reservoir for the export of human beings—young Balinese\nwomen in particular being in great demand in cities through the region as both\nprostitutes and concubines.[83](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts083)\nAs the island was drawn into the slave trade, almost the entire social and\npolitical system of the island was transformed into an apparatus for the\nforcible extraction of women. Even within villages, ordinary marriages took\nthe form of “marriage by capture”—sometimes staged elopements, sometimes real\nforcible kidnappings, after which the kidnappers would pay a woman’s family to\nlet the matter drop.[84](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts084) If a\nwoman was captured by someone genuinely important, though, no compensation\nwould be offered. Even in the 1960s, elders recalled how attractive young\nwomen used to be hidden away by their parents,\n\nforbidden to bear towering offerings to temple festivals, lest they be espied\nby a royal scout and hustled into the closely protected female quarters of the\npalace, where the eyes of male visitors were restricted to foot level. For\nthere was slim chance a girl would become a legitimate low-caste wife\n_(penawing)_ of the raja … More likely after affording a few years’ licentious\nsatisfaction, she would degenerate into a slave-like\nservant.[85](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts085)\n\nOr, if she did rise to such a position that the high-caste wives began to see\nher as a rival, she might be either poisoned or shipped off overseas to end up\nservicing soldiers at some Chinese-run bordello in Jogjakarta, or changing\nbedpans in the house of a French plantation-owner in the Indian Ocean island\nof Reunion.[86](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts086) Meanwhile,\nroyal law codes were rewritten in all the usual ways, with the exception that\nhere, the force of law was directed above all and explicitly against women.\nNot only were criminals and debtors to be enslaved and deported, but any\nmarried man was granted the power to renounce his wife, and by doing so render\nher, automatically, property of the local ruler, to be disposed of as he\nwished. Even a woman whose husband died before she had produced male offspring\nwould to be handed over to the palace to be sold\nabroad.[87](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts087)\n\nAs Adrian Vickers explains, even Bali’s famous cockfights—so familiar to any\nfirst-year anthropology student—were originally promoted by royal courts as a\nway of recruiting human merchandise:\n\nKings even helped put people into debt by staging large cockfights in their\ncapitals. The passion and extravagance encouraged by this exciting sport led\nmany peasants to bet more than they could afford. As with any gambling, the\nhope of great wealth and the drama of a contest fuelled ambitions which few\ncould afford and at the end of the day, when the last spur had sunk into the\nchest of the last rooster, many peasants had no home and family to return to.\nThey, and their wives and children, would be sold to\nJava.[88](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts088)\n\n## Reflections on Violence\n\nI began this book by asking a question: How is it that moral obligations\nbetween people come to be thought of as debts, and as a result, end up\njustifying behavior that would otherwise seem utterly immoral?\n\nI began this chapter by beginning to propose an answer: by making a\ndistinction between commercial economies and what I call “human\neconomies”—that is, those where money acts primarily as a social currency, to\ncreate, maintain, or sever relations between people rather than to purchase\nthings. As Rospabé so cogently demonstrated, it is the peculiar quality of\nsuch social currencies that they are never quite equivalent to people. If\nanything, they are a constant reminder that human beings can never be\nequivalent to anything—even, ultimately, to one another. This is the profound\ntruth of the blood-feud. No one can ever really forgive the man who killed his\nbrother because every brother is unique. Nothing could substitute—not even\nsome other man given the same name and status as your brother, or a concubine\nwho will bear a son who will be named after your brother, or a ghost-wife who\nwill bear a child pledged to someday avenge his death.\n\nIn a human economy, each person is unique, and of incomparable value, because\neach is a unique nexus of relations with others. A woman may be a daughter,\nsister, lover, rival, companion, mother, age-mate, and mentor to many\ndifferent people in different ways. Each relation is unique, even in a society\nin which they are sustained through the constant giving back and forth of\ngeneric objects such as raffia cloth or bundles of copper wire. In one sense,\nthose objects make one who one is—a fact illustrated by the way the objects\nused as social currencies are so often things otherwise used to clothe or\ndecorate the human body, that help make one who one is in the eyes of others.\nStill, just as our clothes don’t really make us who we are, a relationship\nkept alive by the giving and taking of raffia is always something more than\nthat.[89](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts089) This means that the\nraffia, in turn, is always something less. This is why I think Rospabé was\nright to emphasize the fact that in such economies, money can never substitute\nfor a person: money is a way of acknowledging that very fact, that the debt\ncannot be paid. But even the notion that a person can substitute for a person,\nthat one sister can somehow be equated with another, is by no means self-\nevident. In this sense, the term “human economy” is double-edged. These are,\nafter all, _economies:_ that is, systems of exchange in which qualities are\nreduced to quantities, allowing calculations of gain and loss—even if those\ncalculations are simply a matter (as in sister exchange) of 1 equals 1, or (as\nin the feud) of 1 minus 1 equals 0.\n\nHow is this calculability effectuated? How does it become possible to treat\npeople as if they are identical? The Lele example gave us a hint: to make a\nhuman being an object of exchange, one woman equivalent to another for\nexample, requires first of all ripping her from her context; that is, tearing\nher away from that web of relations that makes her the unique conflux of\nrelations that she is, and thus, into a generic value capable of being added\nand subtracted and used as a means to measure debt. This requires a certain\nviolence. To make her equivalent to a bar of camwood takes even more violence,\nand it takes an enormous amount of sustained and systematic violence to rip\nher so completely from her context that she becomes a slave.\n\nI should be clear here. I am not using the word “violence” metaphorically. I\nam not speaking merely of conceptual violence, but of the literal threat of\nbroken bones and bruised flesh; of punches and kicks; in much the same way\nthat when the ancient Hebrews spoke of their daughters in “bondage,” they were\nnot being poetic, but talking about literal ropes and chains.\n\nMost of us don’t like to think much about violence. Those lucky enough to live\nrelatively comfortable, secure lives in modern cities tend either to act as if\nit does not exist or, when reminded that it does, to write off the larger\nworld “out there” as a terrible, brutal place, with not much that can be done\nto help it. Either instinct allows us not to have to think about the degree to\nwhich even our own daily existence is defined by violence or at least the\nthreat of violence (as I’ve often noted, think about what would happen if you\nwere to insist on your right to enter a university library without a properly\nvalidated ID), and to overstate the importance—or at least the frequency—of\nthings like war, terrorism, and violent crime. The role of force in providing\nthe framework for human relations is simply more explicit in what we call\n“traditional societies”—even if in many, actual physical assault by one human\non another occurs less often than in our own. Here’s a story from the Bunyoro\nkingdom, in East Africa:\n\nOnce a man moved into a new village. He wanted to find out what his neighbors\nwere like, so in the middle of the night he pretended to beat his wife very\nseverely, to see if the neighbors would come and remonstrate with him. But he\ndid not really beat her; instead he beat a goatskin, while his wife screamed\nand cried out that he was killing her. Nobody came, and the very next day the\nman and his wife packed up and left that village and went to find some other\nplace to live.[90](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts090)\n\nThe point is obvious. In a proper village, the neighbors should have rushed\nin, held him back, demanded to know what the woman could possibly have done to\ndeserve such treatment. The dispute would become a collective concern that\nended in some sort of collective settlement. This is how people ought to live.\nNo reasonable man or woman would want to live in a place where neighbors don’t\nlook after one another.\n\nIn its own way it’s a revealing story, charming even, but one must still ask:\nHow would a community—even one the man in the story would have considered a\nproper community—have reacted if they thought _she_ was beating _him?[\n91](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts091)_ I think we all know the\nanswer. The first case would have led to concern; the second would have led to\nridicule. In Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, young\nvillagers used to put on satirical skits making fun of husbands beaten by\ntheir wives, even to parade them about the town mounted backwards on an ass\nfor everyone to jeer at.[92](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts092) No\nAfrican society, as far as I know, went quite this far. (Neither did any\nAfrican society burn as many witches—Western Europe at that time was a\nparticularly savage place.) Yet as in most of the world, the assumption that\nthe one sort of brutality was at least potentially legitimate, and that the\nother was not, was the framework within which relations between the sexes took\nplace.[93](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts093)\n\nWhat I want to emphasize is that there is a direct relation between that fact\nand the possibility of trading lives for one another. Anthropologists are fond\nof making diagrams to represent preferential marriage patterns. Sometimes,\nthese diagrams can be quite\nbeautiful:[94](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts094)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_003_r1.jpg)\n\n_Ideal pattern of bilateral cross-cousin marriage_\n\nSometimes they merely have a certain elegant simplicity, as in this diagram on\nan instance of Tiv sister\nexhange:[95](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts095)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_004_r1.jpg)\n\nHuman beings, left to follow their own desires, rarely arrange themselves in\nsymmetrical patterns. Such symmetry tends to be bought at a terrible human\nprice. In the Tiv case, Akiga is actually willing to describe it:\n\nUnder the old system an elder who had a ward could always marry a young girl,\nhowever senile he might be, even if he were a leper with no hands or feet; no\ngirl would dare to refuse him. If another man were attracted by his ward he\nwould take his own and give her to the old man by force, in order to make an\nexchange. The girl had to go with the old man, sorrowfully carrying his goat-\nskin bag. If she ran back to her home her owner caught her and beat her, then\nbound her and brought her back to the elder. The old man was pleased, and\ngrinned till he showed his blackened molars. “Wherever you go,” he told her,\n“you will be brought back here to me; so stop worrying, and settle down as my\nwife.” The girl fretted, till she wished the earth might swallow her. Some\nwomen even stabbed themselves to death when they were given to an old man\nagainst their will; but in spite of all, the Tiv did not\ncare.[96](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts096)\n\nThe last line says everything. Citing it might seem unfair (the Tiv did,\nevidently, care enough to elect Akiga to be their first parliamentary\nrepresentative, knowing he supported legislation to outlaw such practices),\nbut it serves nicely to bring home the real point: that certain sorts of\nviolence _were_ considered morally\nacceptable.[97](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-nts097) No neighbors\nwould rush in to intervene if a guardian was beating a runaway ward. Or if\nthey did, it would be to insist that he use more gentle means to return her to\nher rightful husband. And it was because women knew that this is how their\nneighbors, or even parents, would react that “exchange marriage” was possible.\n\nThis is what I mean by people “ripped from their contexts.”\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe Lele were fortunate enough to have largely escaped the devastations of the\nslave trade; the Tiv were sitting practically on the teeth of the shark, and\nthey had to make heroic efforts to keep the threat at bay. Nonetheless, in\nboth cases there were mechanisms for forcibly removing young women from their\nhomes, and it was precisely this that made them exchangeable—though in each\ncase too, a principle stipulated that a woman could only be exchanged for\nanother woman. The few exceptions, when women could be exchanged for other\nthings, emerged directly from war and slavery—that is, when the level of\nviolence was significantly ratcheted up.\n\nThe slave trade, of course, represented violence on an entirely different\nscale. We are speaking here of destruction of genocidal proportions, in world-\nhistoric terms, comparable only to events like the destruction of New World\ncivilizations or the Holocaust. Neither do I mean in any way to blame the\nvictims: we need only imagine what would be likely to happen in our own\nsociety if a group of space aliens suddenly appeared, armed with undefeatable\nmilitary technology, infinite wealth, and no recognizable morality—and\nannounced that they were willing to pay a million dollars each for human\nworkers, no questions asked. There will always be at least a handful of people\nunscrupulous enough to take advantage of such a situation—and a handful is all\nit takes.\n\nGroups like the Aro Confederacy represent an all-too-familiar strategy,\ndeployed by fascists, mafias, and right-wing gangsters everywhere: first\nunleash the criminal violence of an unlimited market, in which everything is\nfor sale and the price of life becomes extremely cheap; then step in, offering\nto restore a certain measure of order—though one which in its very harshness\nleaves all the most profitable aspects of the earlier chaos intact. The\nviolence is preserved within the structure of the law. Such mafias, too,\nalmost invariably end up enforcing a strict code of honor in which morality\nbecomes above all a matter of paying one’s debts.\n\nWere this a different book, I might reflect here on the curious parallels\nbetween the Cross River societies and Bali, both of which saw a magnificent\noutburst of artistic creativity (Cross River Ekpe masks were a major influence\non Picasso) that took the form, above all, of an efflorescence of theatrical\nperformance, replete with intricate music, splendid costumes, and stylized\ndance—a kind of alternative political order as imaginary spectacle—at the\nexact moment that ordinary life became a game of constant peril in which any\nmisstep might lead to being sent away. What was the link between the two? It’s\nan interesting question, but not one we can really answer here. For present\npurposes, the crucial question has to be: How common was this? The African\nslave trade was, as I mentioned, an unprecedented catastrophe, but commercial\neconomies had already been extracting slaves from human economies for\nthousands of years. It is a practice as old as civilization. The question I\nwant to ask is: To what degree is it actually constitutive of civilization\nitself?\n\nI am not speaking strictly of slavery here, but of that process that dislodges\npeople from the webs of mutual commitment, shared history, and collective\nresponsibility that make them what they are, so as to make them\nexchangeable—that is, to make it possible to make them subject to the logic of\ndebt. Slavery is just the logical end-point, the most extreme form of such\ndisentanglement. But for that reason it provides us with a window on the\nprocess as a whole. What’s more, owing to its historical role, slavery has\nshaped our basic assumptions and institutions in ways that we are no longer\naware of and whose influence we would probably never wish to acknowledge if we\nwere. If we have become a debt society, it is because the legacy of war,\nconquest, and slavery has never completely gone away. It’s still there, lodged\nin our most intimate conceptions of honor, property, even freedom. It’s just\nthat we can no longer see that it’s there.\n\nIn the next chapter, I will begin to describe how this happened.\n\n\n# **Chapter Seven**  \n  \n**HONOR AND DEGRADATION**\n\n# _OR, ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CIVILIZATION_\n\n_ur 5 [HAR]: n., liver; spleen; heart, soul; bulk, main body; foundation;\nloan; obligation; interest; surplus, profit; interest-bearing debt; repayment;\nslave-woman_.\n\n—early Sumerian dictionary[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts001)  \n  \n\n_It is just to give each what is owed_.\n\n—Simonides\n\nIN THE LAST CHAPTER, I offered a glimpse of how human economies, with their\nsocial currencies—which are used to measure, assess, and maintain\nrelationships between people, and only perhaps incidentally to acquire\nmaterial goods—might be transformed into something else. What we discovered\nwas that we cannot begin to think about such questions without taking into\naccount the role of sheer physical violence. In the case of the African slave\ntrade, this was primarily violence imposed from outside. Nonetheless, its very\nsuddenness, its very brutality, provides us with a sort of freeze-frame of a\nprocess that must have occurred in a much slower, more haphazard fashion in\nother times and places. This is because there is every reason to believe that\nslavery, with its unique ability to rip human beings from their contexts, to\nturn them into abstractions, played a key role in the rise of markets\neverywhere.\n\nWhat happens, then, when the same process happens more slowly? It would seem\nthat much of this history is permanently lost—since in both the ancient Middle\nEast and the ancient Mediterranean, most of the really critical moments seem\nto have occurred just before the advent of written records. Still, the broad\noutlines can be reconstructed. The best way to do so, I believe, is to start\nfrom a single, odd, vexed concept: the concept of honor, which can be treated\nas a kind of artifact, or even as a hieroglyphic, a fragment preserved from\nhistory that seems to compress into itself the answer to almost everything\nwe’ve been trying to understand. On the one hand, violence: men who live by\nviolence, whether soldiers or gangsters, are almost invariably obsessed with\nhonor, and assaults on honor are considered the most obvious justification for\nacts of violence. On the other, debt. We speak both of debts of honor, and\nhonoring one’s debts; in fact, the transition from one to the other provides\nthe best clue to how debts emerge from obligations; even as the notion of\nhonor seemed to echo a defiant insistence that financial debts are not really\nthe most important ones; an echo, here, of arguments that, like those in the\nVedas and the Bible, go back to the very dawn of the market itself. Even more\ndisturbingly, since the notion of honor makes no sense without the possibility\nof degradation, reconstructing this history reveals how much our basic\nconcepts of freedom and morality took shape within institutions—notably, but\nnot only, slavery—that we’d sooner not have to think about at all.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nTo underscore some of the paradoxes surrounding the concept and bring home\nwhat’s really at stake here, let us consider the story of one man who survived\nthe Middle Passage: Olaudah Equiano, born sometime around 1745 in a rural\ncommunity somewhere within the confines of the Kingdom of Benin. Kidnapped\nfrom his home at the age of eleven, Equiano was eventually sold to British\nslavers operating in the Bight of Biafra, from whence he was conveyed first to\nBarbados, then to a plantation in colonial Virginia.\n\nEquiano’s further adventures—and there were many—are narrated in his\nautobiography, _The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano: or,\nGustavus Vassa, the African_ , published in 1789. After spending much of the\nSeven Years’ War hauling gunpowder on a British frigate, he was promised his\nfreedom, denied his freedom, sold to several owners—who regularly lied to him,\npromising his freedom, and then broke their word—until he passed into the\nhands of a Quaker merchant in Pennsylvania, who eventually allowed him to\npurchase his freedom. Over the course of his later years he was to become a\nsuccessful merchant in his own right, a best-selling author, an Arctic\nexplorer, and eventually, one of the leading voices of English Abolitionism.\nHis eloquence and the power of his life story played significant parts in the\nmovement that led to the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807.\n\nReaders of Equiano’s book are often troubled by one aspect of the story: that\nfor most of his early life, he was not opposed to the institution of slavery.\nAt one point, while saving money to buy his freedom, he even briefly took a\njob that involved purchasing slaves in Africa. Equiano only came around to an\nabolitionist position after converting to Methodism and falling in with\nreligious activists against the trade. Many have asked: Why did it take him so\nlong? Surely if anyone had reason to understand the evils of slavery, he did.\n\nThe answer seems, oddly, to lie in the man’s very integrity. One thing that\ncomes through strikingly in the book is that this was not only a man of\nendless resourcefulness and determination, but above all, a man of honor. Yet\nthis created a terrible dilemma. To be made a slave is to be stripped of any\npossible honor. Equiano wished above all else to regain what had been taken\nfrom him. The problem is that honor is, by definition, something that exists\nin the eyes of others. To be able to recover it, then, a slave must\nnecessarily adopt the rules and standards of the society that surrounds him,\nand this means that, in practice at least, he cannot absolutely reject the\ninstitutions that deprived him of his honor in the first place.\n\nIt strikes me that this experience—of only being able to restore one’s lost\nhonor, to regain the ability to act with integrity by acting in accord with\nthe terms of a system that one knows, through deeply traumatic personal\nexperience, to be utterly unjust—is itself one of the most profoundly violent\naspects of slavery. It is another example, perhaps, of the need to argue in\nthe master’s language, but here taken to insidious extremes.\n\nAll societies based on slavery tend to be marked by this agonizing double\nconsciousness: the awareness that the highest things one has to strive for are\nalso, ultimately, wrong; but at the same time, the feeling that this is simply\nthe nature of reality. This might help explain why throughout most of history,\nwhen slaves did rebel against their masters, they rarely rebelled against\nslavery itself. But the flip side of this is that even slave-owners seemed to\nfeel that the whole arrangement was somehow fundamentally perverse or\nunnatural. First-year Roman law students, for instance, were made to memorize\nthe following definition:\n\nslavery\n\nis an institution according to the law of nations whereby one person falls\nunder the property rights of another, contrary to\nnature.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts002)\n\nAt the very least, there was always seen to be something disreputable and ugly\nabout slavery. Anyone too close to it was tainted. Slave-traders particularly\nwere scorned as inhuman brutes. Throughout history, moral justifications for\nslavery are rarely taken particularly seriously even by those who espouse\nthem. For most of human history, most people saw slavery much as we see war: a\ntawdry business, to be sure, but one would have to be naïve indeed to imagine\nit could simply be eliminated.\n\n## Honor Is Surplus Dignity\n\nSo what is slavery? I’ve already begun to suggest an answer in the last\nchapter. Slavery is the ultimate form of being ripped from one’s context, and\nthus from all the social relationships that make one a human being. Another\nway to put this is that the slave is, in a very real sense, dead.\n\nThis was the conclusion of the first scholar to carry out a broad historical\nsurvey of the institution, an Egyptian sociologist named Ali ‘Abd al-Wahid\nWafi, in Paris in 1931.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts003)\nEverywhere, he observes, from the ancient world to then-present-day South\nAmerica, one finds the same list of possible ways whereby a free person might\nbe reduced to slavery:\n\n1) By the law of force\n\na. By surrender or capture in war\n\nb. By being the victim of raiding or kidnapping\n\n2) As legal punishment for crimes (including debt)\n\n3) Through paternal authority (a father’s sale of his children)\n\n4) Through the voluntary sale of one’s\nself[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts004)\n\nEverywhere, too, capture in war is considered the only way that is considered\nabsolutely legitimate. All the others were surrounded by moral problems.\nKidnapping was obviously criminal, and parents would not sell children except\nunder desperate\ncircumstances.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts005) We read of\nfamines in China so severe that thousands of poor men would castrate\nthemselves, in the hope that they might sell themselves as eunuchs at\ncourt—but this was also seen as the sign of total social\nbreakdown.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts006) Even the judicial\nprocess could easily be corrupted, as the ancients were well aware—especially\nwhen it came to enslavement for debt.\n\nOn one level, al-Wahid’s argument is just an extended apologia for the role of\nslavery in Islam—widely criticized, since Islamic law never eliminated\nslavery, even when the institution largely vanished in the rest of the\nMedieval world. True, he argues, Mohammed did not forbid the practice, but\nstill, the early Caliphate was the first government we know of that actually\nsucceeded in eliminating all these practices (judicial abuse, kidnappings, the\nsale of offspring) that had been recognized as social problems for thousands\nof years, and to limit slavery strictly to prisoners of war.\n\nThe book’s most enduring contribution, though, lay simply in asking: What do\nall these circumstances have in common? Al-Wahid’s answer is striking in its\nsimplicity: one becomes a slave in situations where one would otherwise have\ndied. This is obvious in the case of war: in the ancient world, the victor was\nassumed to have total power over the vanquished, including their women and\nchildren; all of them could be simply massacred. Similarly, he argued,\ncriminals were condemned to slavery only for capital crimes, and those who\nsold themselves, or their children, normally faced\nstarvation.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts007)\n\nThis is not just to say, though, that a slave was seen as owing his master his\nlife since he would otherwise be\ndead.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts008) Perhaps this was true\nat the moment of his or her enslavement. But after that, a slave could not owe\ndebts, because in almost every important sense, a slave _was_ dead. In Roman\nlaw, this was quite explicit. If a Roman soldier was captured and lost his\nliberty, his family was expected to read his will and dispose of his\npossessions. Should he later regain his freedom, he would have to start over,\neven to the point of remarrying the woman who was now considered his\nwidow.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts009)\n\nIn West Africa, according to one French anthropologist, the same principles\napplied:\n\nOnce he had been finally removed from his own milieu through capture the slave\nwas considered as socially _dead_ , just as if he had been vanquished and\nkilled in combat. Among the Mande, at one time, prisoners of war brought home\nby the conquerors were offered _dege_ (millet and milk porridge)—because it\nwas held that a man should not die on an empty stomach—and then presented with\ntheir arms so that they could kill themselves. Anyone who refused was slapped\non the face by his abductor and kept as a captive: he had accepted the\ncontempt which deprived him of\npersonality.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts010)\n\nTiv horror stories about men who are dead but do not know it or who are\nbrought back from the grave to serve their murderers, and Haitian zombie\nstories, all seem to play on this essential horror of slavery: the fact that\nit’s a kind of living death.\n\nIn a book called _Slavery and Social Death_ —surely the most profound\ncomparative study of the institution yet written—Orlando Patterson works out\nexactly what it has meant to be so completely and absolutely ripped from one’s\ncontext.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts011) First of all, he\nemphasizes, slavery is unlike any other form of human relation because it is\nnot a moral relation. Slave-owners might dress it up in all sorts of\nlegalistic or paternalistic language, but really this is just window-dressing\nand no one really believes it; really, it is a relation based purely on\nviolence; a slave must obey because if he doesn’t, he can be beaten, tortured,\nor killed, and everyone is perfectly well aware of this. Second of all, being\nsocially dead means that a slave has no binding moral relations with anyone\nelse: he is alienated from his ancestors, community, family, clan, city; he\ncannot make contracts or meaningful promises, except at the whim of his\nmaster; even if he acquires a family, it can be broken up at any time. The\nrelation of pure force that attached him to his master was hence the only\nhuman relationship that ultimately mattered. As a result—and this is the third\nessential element—the slave’s situation was one of utter degradation. Hence\nthe Mande warrior’s slap: the captive, having refused his one final chance to\nsave his honor by killing himself, must recognize that he will now be\nconsidered an entirely contemptible\nbeing.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts012)\n\nYet at the same time, this ability to strip others of their dignity becomes,\nfor the master, the foundation of his honor. As Patterson notes, there have\nbeen places—the Islamic world affords numerous examples—where slaves are not\neven put to work for profit; instead, rich men make a point of surrounding\nthemselves with battalions of slave retainers simply for reasons of status, as\ntokens of their magnificence and nothing else.\n\nIt seems to me that this is precisely what gives honor its notoriously fragile\nquality. Men of honor tend to combine a sense of total ease and self-\nassurance, which comes with the habit of command, with a notorious jumpiness,\na heightened sensitivity to slights and insults, the feeling that a man (and\nit is almost always a man) is somehow reduced, humiliated, if any “debt of\nhonor” is allowed to go unpaid. This is because honor is not the same as\ndignity. One might even say: honor is surplus dignity. It is that heightened\nconsciousness of power, and its dangers, that comes from having stripped away\nthe power and dignity of others; or at the very least, from the knowledge that\none is capable of doing so. At its simplest, honor is that excess dignity that\nmust be defended with the knife or sword (violent men, as we all know, are\nalmost invariably obsessed with honor). Hence the warrior’s ethos, where\nalmost anything that could possibly be seen as a sign of disrespect—in\ninappropriate word, an inappropriate glance—is considered a challenge, or can\nbe treated as such. Yet even where overt violence has largely been put out of\nthe picture, wherever honor is at issue, it comes with a sense that dignity\n_can_ be lost, and therefore must be constantly defended.\n\nThe result is that to this day, “honor” has two contradictory meanings. On the\none hand, we can speak of honor as simple integrity. Decent people honor their\ncommitments. This is clearly what “honor” meant for Equiano: to be an\nhonorable man meant to be one who speaks the truth, obeys the law, keeps his\npromises, is fair and conscientious in his commercial\ndealings.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts013) His problem was\nthat honor simultaneously meant something else, which had everything to do\nwith the kind of violence required to reduce human beings to commodities to\nbegin with.\n\nThe reader might be asking: But what does all this have to do with the origins\nof money? The answer is, surprisingly: everything. Some of the most genuinely\narchaic forms of money we know about appear to have been used precisely as\nmeasures of honor and degradation: that is, the value of money was,\nultimately, the value of the power to turn others into money. The curious\npuzzle of the _cumal_ —the slave-girl money of medieval Ireland—would appear\nto be a dramatic illustration.\n\n## Honor Price (Early Medieval Ireland)\n\nFor much of its early history, Ireland’s situation was not very different than\nthat in many of the African societies we looked at in the end of the last\nchapter. It was a human economy perched uncomfortably on the fringe of an\nexpanding commercial one. What’s more, at certain periods there was a very\nlively slave trade. As one historian put it, “Ireland has no mineral wealth,\nand foreign luxury goods could be bought by Irish kings mainly for two export\ngoods, cattle and people.”[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts014)\nHardly surprising, perhaps, that cattle and people were the two major\ndenominations of the currency. Still, by the time our earliest records kick\nin, around 600AD, the slave trade appears to have died off, and slavery itself\nwas a waning institution, coming under severe disapproval from the\nChurch.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts015) Why, then, were\ncumal still being used as units of account, to tally up debts that were\nactually paid out in cows, and in cups and brooches and other objects made of\nsilver, or, in the case of minor transactions, sacks of wheat or oats? And\nthere’s an even more obvious question: Why _women?_ There were plenty of male\nslaves in early Ireland, yet no one seems ever to have used them as money.\n\nMost of what we know about the economy of early Medieval Ireland comes from\nlegal sources—a series of law codes, drawn up by a powerful class of jurists,\ndating roughly from the seventh to ninth centuries ad. These, however, are\nexceptionally rich. Ireland at that time was still very much a human economy.\nIt was also a very rural one: people lived in scattered homesteads, not unlike\nthe Tiv, growing wheat and tending cattle. The closest there were to towns\nwere a few concentrations around monasteries. There appears to have been a\nnear total absence of markets, except for a few on the coast—presumably,\nmainly slave or cattle markets—frequented by foreign\nships.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts016)\n\nAs a result, money was employed almost exclusively for social purposes: gifts;\nfees to craftsmen, doctors, poets, judges, and entertainers; various feudal\npayments (lords gave gifts of cattle to clients who then had to regularly\nsupply them with food). The authors of the law codes didn’t even know how to\nput a price on most goods of ordinary use—pitchers, pillows, chisels, slabs of\nbacon, and the like; no one seems ever to have paid money for\nthem.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts017) Food was shared in\nfamilies or delivered to feudal superiors, who laid it out in sumptuous feasts\nfor friends, rivals, and retainers. Anyone needing a tool or furniture or\nclothing either went to a kinsman with the relevant craft skills or paid\nsomeone to make it. The objects themselves were not for sale. Kings, in turn,\nassigned tasks to different clans: this one was to provide them with leather,\nthis one poets, this one shields … precisely the sort of unwieldy arrangement\nthat markets were later developed to get\naround.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts018)\n\nMoney could be loaned. There was a highly complex system of pledges and\nsureties to guarantee that debtors delivered what they owed. Mainly, though,\nit was used for paying fines. These fines are endlessly and meticulously\nelaborated in the codes, but what really strikes the contemporary observer is\nthat they were carefully graded by rank. This is true of almost all the\n“Barbarian Law Codes”—the size of the penalties usually has at least as much\ndo with the status of the victim as it does with the nature of the injury—but\nonly in Ireland were things mapped out quite so systematically.\n\nThe key to the system was a notion of honor: literally\n“face.”[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts019) One’s honor was the\nesteem one had in the eyes of others, one’s honesty, integrity, and character,\nbut also one’s power, in the sense of the ability to protect oneself, and\none’s family and followers, from any sort of degradation or insult. Those who\nhad the highest degree of honor were literally sacred beings: their persons\nand possessions were sacrosanct. What was so unusual about Celtic systems—and\nthe Irish one went further with this than any other—was that honor could be\nprecisely quantified. Every free person had his or her “honor price”: the\nprice that one had to pay for an insult to the person’s dignity. These varied.\nThe honor price of a king, for instance, was seven cumal, or seven slave\ngirls—this was the standard honor price for any sacred being, the same as a\nbishop or master poet. Since (as all sources hasten to point out) slave girls\nwere not normally paid as such, this would mean, in the case of an insult to\nsuch a person’s dignity, one would have to pay twenty-one milk cows or twenty-\none ounces of silver.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts020) The\nhonor price of a wealthy peasant was two and a half cows, of a minor lord,\nthat, plus half a cow additionally for each of his free dependents—and since a\nlord, to remain a lord, had to have at least five of these, that brought him\nup to at least five cows\ntotal.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts021)\n\nHonor price is not to be confused with wergeld—the actual price of a man or\nwoman’s life. If one killed a man, one paid goods to the value of seven\ncumals, in recompense for killing him, to which one then added his honor\nprice, for having offended against his dignity (by killing him).\nInterestingly, only in the case of a king are the blood price and his honor\nprice the same.\n\nThere were also payments for injury: if one wounds a man’s cheek, one pays his\nhonor price plus the price of the injury. (A blow to the face was, for obvious\nreasons, particularly egregious.) The problem was how to calculate the injury,\nsince this varied according to both the physical damage and status of the\ninjured party. Here, Irish jurists developed the ingenious expedient of\nmeasuring different wounds with different varieties of grain: a cut on the\nking’s cheek was measured in grains of wheat, on that of a substantial farmer\nin oats, on that of a smallholder merely in peas. One cow was paid for\neach.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts022) Similarly, if one\nstole, say, a man’s brooch or pig, one had to pay back three brooches or three\npigs—plus his honor price, for having violated the sanctity of his homestead.\nAttacking a peasant under the protection of a lord was the same as raping a\nman’s wife or daughter, a violation of the honor not of the victim, but of the\nman who should have been able to protect them.\n\nFinally, one had to pay the honor price if one simply insulted someone of any\nimportance: say, by turning the person away at a feast, inventing a\nparticularly embarrassing nickname (at least, if it caught on), or humiliating\nthe person through the use of\nsatire.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts023) Mockery was a\nrefined art in Medieval Ireland, and poets were considered close to magicians:\nit was said that a talented satirist could rhyme rats to death, or at the very\nleast, raise blisters on the faces of victims. Any man publicly mocked would\nhave no choice but to defend his honor; and, in Medieval Ireland, the value of\nthat honor was precisely defined.\n\nI should note that while twenty-one cows might not seem like much when we are\ndealing with kings, Ireland at the time had about 150\nkings.[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts024) Most had only a\ncouple of thousand subjects, though there were also higher-ranking, provincial\nkings for whom the honor price was\ndouble.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts025) What’s more, since\nthe legal system was completely separate from the political one, jurists, in\ntheory, had the right the demote anyone—including a king—who had committed a\ndishonorable act. If a nobleman turned a worthy man away from his door or\nfeast, sheltered a fugitive, or ate steak from an obviously stolen cow, or\neven if he allowed himself to be satirized and did not take the offending poet\nto court, his price could be lowered to that of a commoner. But the same was\ntrue of a king who ran away in battle, or abused his powers, or even was\ncaught working in the fields or otherwise engaging in tasks beneath his\ndignity. A king who did something utterly outrageous—murdered one of his own\nrelatives, for example—might end up with no honor price at all, which meant\nnot that people could say anything they liked about the king, without fear of\nrecompense, but that he couldn’t stand as surety or witness in court, as one’s\noath and standing in law was also determined by one’s honor price. This didn’t\nhappen often, but it did happen, and legal wisdom made sure to remind people\nof it: the list, contained in one famous legal text, of the “seven kings who\nlost their honor price,” was meant to ensure that everyone remembered that no\nmatter how sacred and powerful, anyone could fall.\n\nWhat’s unusual about the Irish material is that it’s all spelled out so\nclearly. This is partly because Irish law codes were the work of a class of\nlegal specialists who seem to have turned the whole thing almost into a form\nof entertainment, devoting endless hours to coming up with every possible\nabstract possibility. Some of the provisos are so whimsical (“if stung by\nanother man’s bee, one must calculate the extent of the injury, but also, if\none swatted it in the process, subtract the replacement value of the bee”)\nthat one has to assume they were simply jokes. Still, as a result, the moral\nlogic that lies behind any elaborate code of honor is laid out here in\nstartling honesty. What about women? A free woman was honored at precisely 50\npercent of the price of her nearest male relative (her father, if alive; if\nnot, her husband). If she was dishonored, her price was payable to that\nrelative. Unless, that is, she was an independent landholder. In that case,\nher honor price was the same as that of a man. And unless she was a woman of\neasy virtue, in which case it was zero, since she had no honor to outrage.\nWhat about marriage? A suitor paid the value of the wife’s honor to her father\nand thus became its guardian. What about serfs? The same principle applied:\nwhen a lord acquired a serf, he bought out that man’s honor price, presenting\nhim with its equivalent in cows. From that moment on, if anyone insulted or\ninjured the serf, it was seen an attack on the lord’s honor, and it was up to\nthe lord to collect the attendant fees. Meanwhile the lord’s honor price was\nnotched upward as a result of gathering another dependent: in other words, he\nliterally absorbs his new vassal’s honor into his\nown.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts026)\n\nAll this, in turn, makes it possible to understand both something of the\nnature of honor, and why slave girls were kept as units for reckoning debts of\nhonor even at a time when—owing no doubt to church influence—they no longer\nactually changed hands. At first sight it might seem strange that the honor of\na nobleman or king should be measured in slaves, since slaves were human\nbeings whose honor was zero. But if one’s honor is ultimately founded on one’s\nability to extract the honor of others, it makes perfect sense. The value of a\nslave is that of the honor that has been extracted from them.\n\nSometimes, one comes on a single haphazard detail that gives the game away. In\nthis case it comes not from Ireland but from the Dimetian Code in Wales,\nwritten somewhat later but operating on much the same principles. At one\npoint, after listing the honors due to the seven holy sees of the Kingdom of\nDyfed, whose bishops and abbots were the most exalted and sacred creatures in\nthe kingdom, the text specifies that\n\nWhoever draws blood from an abbot of any one of those principal seats before\nmentioned, let him pay seven pounds; and a female of his kindred to be a\nwasherwoman, as a disgrace to the kindred, and to serve as a memorial to the\npayment of the honor price.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts027)\n\nA washerwoman was the lowest of servants, and the one turned over in this case\nwas to serve for life. She was, in effect, reduced to slavery. Her permanent\ndisgrace was the restoration of the abbot’s honor. While we cannot know if\nsome similar institution once lay behind the habit of reckoning the honor of\nIrish “sacred” beings in slave-women, the principle is clearly the same. Honor\nis a zero-sum game. A man’s ability to protect the women of his family is an\nessential part of that honor. Therefore, forcing him to surrender a woman of\nhis family to perform menial and degrading chores in another’s household is\nthe ultimate blow to his honor. This, in turn, makes it the ultimate\nreaffirmation of the honor of he who takes it away.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nWhat makes Medieval Irish laws seem so peculiar from our perspective is that\ntheir exponents had not the slightest discomfort with putting an exact\nmonetary price on human dignity. For us, the notion that the sanctity of a\npriest or the majesty of a king could be held equivalent to a million fried\neggs or a hundred thousand haircuts is simply bizarre. These are precisely the\nthings that ought to be considered beyond all possibility of quantification.\nIf Medieval Irish jurists felt otherwise, it was because people at that time\ndid not use money to buy eggs or\nhaircuts.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts028) It was the fact\nthat it was still a human economy, in which money was used for social\npurposes, that it was possible to create such an intricate system whereby it\nwas possible not just to measure but to add and subtract specific quantities\nof human dignity—and in doing so, provide us with a unique window into the\ntrue nature of honor itself.\n\nThe obvious question is: What happens to such an economy when people do begin\nto use the same money used to measure dignity to buy eggs and haircuts? As the\nhistory of ancient Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean world reveals, the result\nwas a profound—and enduring—moral crisis.\n\n## Mesopotamia (The Origins of Patriarchy)\n\nIn ancient Greek, the word for “honor” was _tīme_. In Homer’s time, the term\nappears to have been used much like the Irish term “honor price”: it referred\nboth to the glory of the warrior and the compensation paid as damages in case\nof injury or insult. Yet with the rise of markets over the next several\ncenturies, the meaning of the word _tīme_ began to change. On the one hand, it\nbecame the word for “price”—as in, the price of something one buys in the\nmarket. On the other, it referred to an attitude of complete contempt for\nmarkets.\n\nActually, this is still the case today:\n\nIn Greece the word “timi” means honor, which has been typically seen as the\nmost important value in Greek village society. Honor is often characterized in\nGreece as an open-handed generosity and blatant disregard for monetary costs\nand counting. And yet the same word also means “price” as in the price of a\npound of tomatoes.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts029)\n\nThe word “crisis” literally refers to a crossroads: it is the point where\nthings could go either of two different ways. The odd thing about the crisis\nin the concept of honor is that it never seems to have been resolved. Is honor\nthe willingness to pay one’s monetary debts? Or is it the fact that one does\nnot feel that monetary debts are really that important? It appears to be both\nat the same time.\n\nThere’s also the question of what men of honor actually _do_ think is\nimportant. When most of us think of a Mediterranean villager’s sense of honor,\nwe don’t think so much of a casual attitude toward money as of a veritable\nobsession with premarital virginity. Masculine honor is caught up not even so\nmuch in a man’s ability to protect his womenfolk as in his ability to protect\ntheir sexual reputations, to respond to any suggestion of impropriety on the\npart of his mother, wife, sister, or daughter as if it were a direct physical\nattack on his own person. This is a stereotype, but it’s not entirely\nunjustified. One historian who went through fifty years of police reports\nabout knife-fights in nineteenth-century Ionia discovered that virtually every\none of them began when one party publicly suggested that the other’s wife or\nsister was a whore.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts030)\n\nSo, why the sudden obsession with sexual propriety? It doesn’t seem to be\nthere in the Welsh or Irish material. There, the greatest humiliation was to\nsee your sister or daughter reduced to scrubbing someone else’s laundry. What\nis it, then, about the rise of money and markets that cause so many men to\nbecome so uneasy about sex?[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts031)\n\nThis is a difficult question, but at the very least, one can imagine how the\ntransition from a human economy to a commercial one might cause certain moral\ndilemmas. What happens, for instance, when the same money once used to arrange\nmarriages and settle affairs of honor can also be used to pay for the services\nof prostitutes?\n\nAs we’ll see, there is reason to believe that it is in such moral crises that\nwe can find the origin not only of our current conceptions of honor, but of\npatriarchy itself. This is true, at least, if we define “patriarchy” in its\nmore specific Biblical sense: the rule of fathers, with all the familiar\nimages of stern bearded men in robes, keeping a close eye over their\nsequestered wives and daughters, even as their children kept a close eye over\ntheir flocks and herds, familiar from the book of\nGenesis.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts032) Readers of the\nBible had always assumed that there was something primordial in all this; that\nthis was simply the way desert people, and thus the earliest inhabitants of\nthe Near East, had always behaved. This was why the translation of Sumerian,\nin the first half of the twentieth century, came as something of a shock.\n\nIn the very earliest Sumerian texts, particularly those from roughly 3000 to\n2500 bc, women are everywhere. Early histories not only record the names of\nnumerous female rulers, but make clear that women were well represented among\nthe ranks of doctors, merchants, scribes, and public officials, and generally\nfree to take part in all aspects of public life. One cannot speak of full\ngender equality: men still outnumbered women in all these areas. Still, one\ngets the sense of a society not so different than that which prevails in much\nof the developed world today. Over the course of the next thousand years or\nso, all this changes. The place of women in civic life erodes; gradually, the\nmore familiar patriarchal pattern takes shape, with its emphasis on chastity\nand premarital virginity, a weakening and eventually wholesale disappearance\nof women’s role in government and the liberal professions, and the loss of\nwomen’s independent legal status, which renders them wards of their husbands.\nBy the end of the Bronze Age, around 1200 bc, we begin to see large numbers of\nwomen sequestered away in harems and (in some places, at least), subjected to\nobligatory veiling.\n\nIn fact, this appears to reflect a much broader worldwide pattern. It has\nalways been something of a scandal for those who like to see the advance of\nscience and technology, the accumulation of learning, economic growth—“human\nprogress,” as we like to call it—as necessarily leading to greater human\nfreedom, that for women, the exact opposite often seems to be the case. Or at\nleast, has been the case until very recent times. A similar gradual\nrestriction on women’s freedoms can be observed in India and China. The\nquestion is, obviously, Why? The standard explanation in the Sumerian case has\nbeen the gradual infiltration of pastoralists from the surrounding deserts\nwho, presumably, always had more patriarchal mores. There was, after all, only\na narrow strip of land along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that could\nsupport intensive irrigation works, and hence, urban life. Civilization was\nthus from early times surrounded by a fringe of desert people, who lived much\nlike those described in Genesis and spoke the same Semitic languages. It is\nundeniably true that, over the course of time, the Sumerian language was\ngradually replaced—first by Akkadian, then by Amorite, then by Aramaic\nlanguages, and finally, most recently of all, by Arabic, which was also\nbrought to Mesopotamia and the Levant by desert pastoralists. While all this\ndid, clearly, bring with it profound cultural changes as well, it’s not a\nparticularly satisfying\nexplanation.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts033) Former nomads\nappear to have been willing to adapt to urban life in any number of other\nways. Why not that one? And it’s very much a local explanation and does\nnothing, really, to explain the broader pattern. Feminist scholarship has\ninstead tended to emphasize the growing scale and social importance of war,\nand the increasing centralization of the state that accompanied\nit.[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts034) This is more\nconvincing. Certainly, the more militaristic the state, the harsher its laws\ntended to be toward women. But I would add another, complementary argument. As\nI have emphasized, historically, war, states, and markets all tend to feed off\none another. Conquest leads to taxes. Taxes tend to be ways to create markets,\nwhich are convenient for soldiers and administrators. In the specific case of\nMesopotamia, all of this took on a complicated relation to an explosion of\ndebt that threatened to turn all human relations—and by extension, women’s\nbodies—into potential commodities. At the same time, it created a horrified\nreaction on the part of the (male) winners of the economic game, who over time\nfelt forced to go to greater and greater lengths to make clear that _their_\nwomen could in no sense be bought or sold.\n\nA glance at the existing material on Mesopotamian marriage gives us a clue as\nto how this might have happened.\n\nIt is common anthropological wisdom that bridewealth tends to be typical of\nsituations where population is relatively thin, land not a particularly scarce\nresource, and therefore, politics are all about controlling labor. Where\npopulation is dense and land at a premium, one tends to instead find dowry:\nadding a woman to the household is adding another mouth to feed, and rather\nthan being paid off, a bride’s father is expected to contribute something\n(land, wealth, money …) to help support his daughter in her new\nhome.[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts035) In Sumerian times,\nfor instance, the main payment at marriage was a huge gift of food paid by the\ngroom’s father to the bride’s, destined to provide a sumptuous feast for the\nwedding.[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts036) Before long,\nhowever, this seems to have split into two payments, one for the wedding,\nanother to the woman’s father, calculated—and often paid—in\nsilver.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts037) Wealthy women\nsometimes appear to have ended up with the money: at least, many appear to\nhave to worn silver arm and leg rings of identical denominations.\n\nHowever as time went on, this payment, called the _terhatum_ , often began to\ntake on the qualities of a simple purchase. It was referred to as “the price\nof a virgin”—not a mere metaphor, since the illegal deflowering of a virgin\nwas considered a property crime against her\nfather.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts038) Marriage was\nreferred to as “taking possession” of a woman, the same word one would use for\nthe seizure of goods.[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts039) In\nprinciple, a wife, once possessed, owed her husbands strict obedience, and\noften could not seek a divorce even in cases of physical abuse.\n\nFor women with wealthy or powerful parents, all this remained largely a matter\nof principle, modified considerably in practice. Merchants’ daughters, for\nexample, typically received substantial cash dowries, with which they could go\ninto business in their own right, or act as partners to their husbands.\nHowever, for the poor—that is, most people—marriage came more and more to\nresemble a simple cash transaction.\n\nSome of this must have been an effect of slavery: while actual slaves were\nrarely numerous, the very existence of a class of people with no kin, who were\nsimply commodities, did make a difference. In Nuzi, for instance, “the\nbrideprice was paid in domestic animals and silver amounting to a total value\nof 40 shekels of silver”‘—to which the author drily adds, “there is some\nevidence that it was equal to the price of a slave\ngirl.”[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts040) This must have been\nmaking things uncomfortably obvious. It’s in Nuzi, too, where we happen to\nhave unusually detailed records, that we find examples of rich men paying cut-\nrate “brideprice” to impoverished families to acquire a daughter who they\nwould then adopt, but who would in fact be either kept as a concubine or\nnursemaid, or married to one of their\nslaves.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts041)\n\nStill, the really critical factor here was debt. As I pointed out in the last\nchapter, anthropologists have long emphasized that paying bridewealth is not\nthe same as buying a wife. After all—and this was one of the clinching\narguments, remember, in the original 1930s League of Nations debate—if a man\nwere really buying a woman, wouldn’t he also be able to sell her? Clearly\nAfrican and Melanesian husbands were not able to sell their wives to some\nthird party. At most, they could send them home and demand back their\nbridewealth.[42](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts042)\n\nA Mesopotamian husband couldn’t sell his wife either. Or, normally he\ncouldn’t. Still, everything changed the moment he took out a loan. Since if he\ndid, it was perfectly legal—as we’ve seen—to use his wife and children as\nsurety, and if he was unable to pay, they could then be taken away as debt\npawns in exactly the same way that he could lose his slaves, sheep, and goats.\nWhat this also meant was that honor and credit became, effectively, the same\nthing: at least for a poor man, one’s creditworthiness was precisely one’s\ncommand over one’s household, and (the flip side, as it were) relations of\ndomestic authority, relations that in principle meant ones of care and\nprotection, became property rights that could indeed be bought and sold.\n\nAgain, for the poor, this meant that family members became commodities that\ncould be rented or sold. Not only could one dispose of daughters as “brides”\nto work in rich men’s households, tablets in Nuzi show that one could now hire\nout family members simply by taking out a loan: there are recorded cases of\nmen sending their sons or even wives as “pawns” for loans that were clearly\njust advance payment for employment in the lender’s farm or cloth\nworkshop.[43](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts043)\n\nThe most dramatic and enduring crisis centered on prostitution. It’s actually\nnot entirely clear, from the earliest sources, whether one can speak here of\n“prostitution” at all. Sumerian temples do often appear to have hosted a\nvariety of sexual activities. Some priestesses, for instance, were considered\nto be married to or otherwise dedicated to gods. What this meant in practice\nseems to have varied considerably. Much as in the case of the later\n_devadasis_ , or “temple dancers” of Hindu India, some remained celibate;\nothers were permitted to marry but were not to bear children; others were\napparently expected to find wealthy patrons, becoming in effect courtesans to\nthe elite. Still others lived in the temples and had the responsibility to\nmake themselves sexually available to worshippers on certain ritual\noccasions.[44](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts044) One thing the\nearly texts do make clear is that all such women were considered\nextraordinarily important. In a very real sense, they were the ultimate\nembodiments of civilization. After all, the entire machinery of the Sumerian\neconomy ostensibly existed to support the temples, which were considered the\nhouseholds of the gods. As such, they represented the ultimate possible\nrefinement in everything from music and dance to art, cuisine, and\ngraciousness of living. Temple priestesses and spouses of the gods were the\nhighest human incarnations of this perfect life.\n\nIt’s also important to emphasize that Sumerian men do not appear, at least in\nthis earliest period, to have seen anything troubling about the idea of their\nsisters having sex for money. To the contrary, insofar as prostitution did\noccur (and remember, it could not have been nearly so impersonal, cold-cash a\nrelation in a credit economy), Sumerian religious texts identify it as among\nthe fundamental features of human civilization, a gift given by the gods at\nthe dawn of time. Procreative sex was considered natural (after all, animals\ndid it). Non-procreative sex, sex for pleasure, was\ndivine.[45](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts045)\n\nThe most famous expression of this identification of prostitute and\ncivilization can be found in the story of Enkidu in the epic of Gilgamesh. In\nthe beginning of the story, Enkidu is a monster—a naked and ferocious “wild\nman” who grazes with the gazelles, drinks at the watering place with wild\ncattle, and terrorizes the people of the city. Unable to defeat him, the\ncitizens finally send out a courtesan who is also a priestess of the goddess\nIshtar. She strips before him, and they make love for six days and seven\nnights. Afterward, Enkidu’s former animal companions run away from him. After\nshe explains that he has now learned wisdom and become like a God (she is,\nafter all, a divine consort), he agrees to put on clothing and come to live in\nthe city like a proper, civilized human\nbeing.[46](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts046)\n\nAlready, in the earliest version of the Enkidu story, though, one can detect a\ncertain ambivalence. Much later, Enkidu is sentenced to death by the gods, and\nhis immediate reaction is to condemn the courtesan for having brought him from\nthe wilds in the first place: he curses her to become a common streetwalker or\ntavern keeper, living among vomiting drunks, abused and beaten by her clients.\nThen, later, he regrets his behavior and blesses her instead. But that trace\nof ambivalence was there from the beginning, and over time, it grew more\npowerful. From early times, Sumerian and Babylonian temple complexes were\nsurrounded by far less glamorous providers of sexual services—indeed, by the\ntime we know much about them, they were the center of veritable red-light\ndistricts full of taverns with dancing girls, men in drag (some of them\nslaves, some runaways), and an almost infinite variety of prostitutes. There\nis an endlessly elaborate terminology whose subtleties are long since lost to\nus. Most seem to have doubled as entertainers: tavern-keepers doubled as\nmusicians; male transvestites were not only singers and dancers, but often\nperformed knife-throwing acts. Many were slaves put to work by their masters,\nor women working off religious vows or debts, or debt bondswomen, or, for that\nmatter, women escaping debt bondage with no place else to go. Over time, many\nof the lower-ranking temple women were either bought as slaves or debt peons\nas well, and there might have often been a blurring of roles between\npriestesses who performed erotic rituals and prostitutes owned by the temple\n(and hence, in principle, by the god), sometimes lodged within the temple\ncompound itself, whose earnings added to the temple\ntreasuries.[47](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts047) Since most\neveryday transactions in Mesopotamia were not cash transactions, once has to\nassume that it was the same with prostitutes—like the tavern-keepers, many of\nwhom seem to have been former prostitutes, they developed ongoing credit\nrelations with their clients—and this must have meant that most were less like\nwhat we think of as streetwalkers and more like\ncourtesans.[48](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts048) Still, the\norigins of commercial prostitution appear to have been caught up in a peculiar\nmixture of sacred (or once-sacred) practice, commerce, slavery, and debt.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\n“Patriarchy” originated, first and foremost, in a rejection of the great urban\ncivilizations in the name of a kind of purity, a reassertion of paternal\ncontrol against great cities like Uruk, Lagash, and Babylon, seen as places of\nbureaucrats, traders, and whores. The pastoral fringes, the deserts and\nsteppes away from the river valleys, were the places to which displaced,\nindebted farmers fled. Resistance, in the ancient Middle East, was always less\na politics of rebellion than a politics of exodus, of melting away with one’s\nflocks and families—often before both were taken\naway.[49](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts049) There were always\ntribal peoples living on the fringes. During good times, they began to take to\nthe cities; in hard times, their numbers swelled with refugees—farmers who\neffectively became Enkidu once again. Then, periodically, they would create\ntheir own alliances and sweep back into the cities once again as conquerors.\nIt’s difficult to say precisely how they imagined their situation, because\nit’s only in the Old Testament, written on the other side of the Fertile\nCrescent, that one has any record of the pastoral rebels’ points of view. But\nnothing there mitigates against the suggestion that the extraordinary emphasis\nwe find there on the absolute authority of fathers, and the jealous protection\nof their fickle womenfolk, were made possible by, but at the same time a\nprotest against, this very commoditization of people in the cities that they\nfled.\n\nThe world’s Holy Books—the Old and New Testaments, the Koran, religious\nliterature from the Middle Ages to this day—echo this voice of rebellion,\ncombining contempt for the corrupt urban life, suspicion of the merchant, and\noften, intense misogyny. One need only think of the image of Babylon itself,\nwhich has become permanently lodged in the collective imagination as not only\nthe cradle of civilization, but also the Place of Whores. Herodotus echoed\npopular Greek fantasies when he claimed that every Babylonian maiden was\nobliged to prostitute herself at the temple, so as to raise the money for her\ndowry.[50](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts050) In the New\nTestament, Saint Peter often referred to Rome as “Babylon,” and the Book of\nRevelation provides perhaps the most vivid image of what he meant by this when\nit speaks of Babylon, “the great whore,” sitting “upon a scarlet colored\nbeast, full of names of blasphemy”:\n\n17:4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with\ngold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of\nabominations and filthiness of her fornication:\n\n17:5 And upon her forehead was a name written, mystery, babylon the great, the\nmother of harlots and abominations of the\nearth.[51](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts051)\n\nSuch is the voice of patriarchal hatred of the city, and of the angry\nmillennial voices of the fathers of the ancient poor.\n\nPatriarchy as we know it seems to have taken shape in a see-sawing battle\nbetween the newfound elites and newly dispossessed. Much of my own analysis\nhere is inspired by the brilliant work of feminist historian Gerda Lerner,\nwho, in an essay on the origins of prostitution, observed:\n\nAnother source for commercial prostitution was the pauperization of farmers\nand their increasing dependence on loans in order to survive periods of\nfamine, which led to debt slavery. Children of both sexes were given up for\ndebt pledges or sold for “adoption.” Out of such practices, the prostitution\nof female family members for the benefit of the head of the family could\nreadily develop. Women might end up as prostitutes because their parents had\nto sell them into slavery or because their impoverished husbands might so use\nthem. Or they might become self-employed as a last alternative to enslavement.\nWith luck, they might in this profession be upwardly mobile through becoming\nconcubines.\n\nBy the middle of the second millennium B.C., prostitution was well established\nas a likely occupation for the daughters of the poor. As the sexual regulation\nof women of the propertied class became more firmly entrenched, the virginity\nof respectable daughters became a financial asset for the family. Thus,\ncommercial prostitution came to be seen as a social necessity for meeting the\nsexual needs of men. What remained problematic was how to distinguish clearly\nand permanently between respectable and non-respectable women.\n\nThis last point is crucial. The most dramatic known attempt to solve the\nproblem, Lerner observes, can be found in a Middle Assyrian law code dating\nfrom somewhere between 1400 and 1100 bc, which is also the first known\nreference to veiling in the history of the Middle East—and also, Lerner\nemphasizes, first to make the policing of social boundaries the responsibility\nof the state.[52](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts052) It is not\nsurprising that this takes place under the authority of perhaps the most\nnotoriously militaristic state in the entire ancient Middle East.\n\nThe code carefully distinguishes among five classes of women. Respectable\nwomen (either married ladies or concubines), widows, and daughters of free\nAssyrian men—“must veil themselves” when they go out on the street.\nProstitutes and slaves (and prostitutes are now considered to include\nunmarried temple servants as well as simple harlots) are not allowed to wear\nveils. The remarkable thing about the laws is that the punishments specified\nin the code are not directed at respectable women who do not wear veils, but\nagainst prostitutes and slaves who do. The prostitute was to be publicly\nbeaten fifty times with staves and have pitch poured on her head; the slave\ngirl was to have her ears cut off. Free men proven to have knowingly abetted\nan impostor would also be thrashed and put to a month’s forced labor.\n\nPresumably in the case of respectable women, the law was assumed to be self-\nenforcing: as what respectable woman would wish to go out on the street in the\nguise of a prostitute?\n\nWhen we refer to “respectable” women, then, we are referring to those whose\nbodies could not, under any conditions, be bought or sold. Their physical\npersons were hidden away and permanently relegated to some man’s domestic\nsphere; when they appeared in public veiled, they were effectively still\nostentatiously walking around, even in public, inside such a\nsphere.[53](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts053) Women who could be\nexchanged for money, on the other hand, must be instantly recognizable as\nsuch.\n\nThe Assyrian law code is one isolated instance; veils certainly did not become\nobligatory everywhere after 1300 bc. But it provides a window on developments\nthat were happening, however unevenly, even spasmodically, across the region,\npropelled by the intersection of commerce, class, defiant assertions of male\nhonor, and the constant threat of the defection of the poor. States seem to\nhave played a complex dual role, simultaneously fostering commoditization and\nintervening to ameliorate its effects: enforcing the laws of debt and rights\nof fathers, and offering periodic amnesties. But the dynamic also led, over\nthe course of millennia, to a systematic demotion of sexuality itself from a\ndivine gift and embodiment of civilized refinement to one of its more familiar\nassociations: with degradation, corruption, and guilt.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nHere I think we have the explanation for that general decline of women’s\nfreedoms that may be observed in all the great urban civilizations for so much\nof their history. In all of them, similar things were happening, even if in\neach case, the pieces came together in different ways.\n\nThe history of China, for instance, saw continual and largely unsuccessful\ngovernment campaigns to eradicate both brideprice and debt slavery, and\nperiodic scandals over the existence of “markets in daughters,” including the\noutright sale of girls as daughters, wives, concubines, or prostitutes (at the\nbuyer’s discretion) continue to this\nday.[54](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts054) In India, the caste\nsystem allowed what were otherwise differences between rich and poor to be\nmade formal and explicit. Brahmins and other members of the upper castes\njealously sequestered their daughters, and married them off with lavish\ndowries, while the lower castes practiced brideprice, allowing members of the\nhigher (“twice-born”) castes to scoff at them for selling their daughters. The\ntwice-born were likewise largely protected from falling into debt bondage,\nwhile for much of the rural poor, debt dependency was institutionalized, with\nthe daughters of poor debtors, predictably, often dispatched to brothels or to\nthe kitchens or laundries of the\nrich.[55](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts055) In either case,\nbetween the push of commoditization, which fell disproportionally on\ndaughters, and the pull of those trying to reassert patriarchal rights to\n“protect” women from any suggestion that they might be commoditized, women’s\nformal and practical freedoms appear to have been gradually but increasingly\nrestricted and effaced. As a result, notions of honor changed too, becoming a\nkind of protest against the implications of the market, even as at the same\ntime (like the world religions) they came to echo that market logic in endless\nsubtle ways.\n\nNowhere, however, are our sources as rich and detailed as they are for ancient\nGreece. This is partly because a commercial economy arrived there so late,\nalmost three thousand years later than in Sumer. As a result, Classical Greek\nliterature gives us a unique opportunity to observe the transformation as it\nwas actually taking place.\n\n## Ancient Greece (Honor and Debt)\n\nThe world of the Homeric epics is one dominated by heroic warriors who are\ndisdainful of trade. In many ways, it is strikingly reminiscent of medieval\nIreland. Money existed, but it was not used to buy anything; important men\nlived their lives in pursuit of honor, which took material form in followers\nand treasure. Treasures were given as gifts, awarded as prizes, carried off as\nloot.[56](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts056) This is no doubt how\n_tīme_ first came to mean both “honor” and “price”—in such a world, no one\nsensed any sort of contradiction between the\ntwo.[57](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts057)\n\nAll this was to change dramatically when commercial markets began to develop\ntwo hundred years later. Greek coinage seem to have been first used mainly to\npay soldiers, as well as to pay fines and fees and payments made to and by the\ngovernment, but by about 600 bc, just about every Greek city-state was\nproducing its own coins as a mark of civic independence. It did not take long,\nthough, before coins were in common use in everyday transactions. By the fifth\ncentury, in Greek cities, the _agora_ , the place of public debate and\ncommunal assembly, also doubled as a marketplace.\n\nOne of the first effects of the arrival of a commercial economy was a series\nof debt crises, of the sort long familiar from Mesopotamia and Israel. “The\npoor,” as Aristotle succinctly put it in his _Constitution of the Athenians_ ,\n“together with their wives and children, were enslaved to the\nrich.”[58](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts058) Revolutionary\nfactions emerged, demanding amnesties, and most Greek cities were at least for\na while taken over by populist strongmen swept into power partly by the demand\nfor radical debt relief. The solution most cities ultimately found, however,\nwas quite different than it had been in the Near East. Rather than\ninstitutionalize periodic amnesties, Greek cities tended to adopt legislation\nlimiting or abolishing debt peonage altogether, and then, to forestall future\ncrises, they would turn to a policy of expansion, shipping off the children of\nthe poor to found military colonies overseas. Before long, the entire coast\nfrom Crimea to Marseille was dotted with Greek cities, which served, in turn,\nas conduits for a lively trade in\nslaves.[59](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts059) The sudden\nabundance of chattel slaves, in turn, completely transformed the nature of\nGreek society. First and most famously, it allowed even citizens of modest\nmeans to take part in the political and cultural life of the city and have a\ngenuine sense of citizenship. But this, in turn, drove the old aristocratic\nclasses to develop more and more elaborate means of setting themselves off\nfrom what they considered the tawdriness and moral corruption of the new\ndemocratic state.\n\nWhen the curtain truly goes up on Greece, in the fifth century, we find\neverybody arguing about money. For the aristocrats, who wrote most of the\nsurviving texts, money was the embodiment of corruption. Aristocrats disdained\nthe market. Ideally, a man of honor should be able to raise everything he\nneeded on his own estates, and never have to handle cash at\nall.[60](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts060) In practice, they knew\nthis was impossible. Yet at every point they tried to set themselves apart\nfrom the values of the ordinary denizens of the marketplace: to contrast the\nbeautiful gold and silver beakers and tripods they gave one another at\nfunerals and weddings with the vulgar hawking of sausages or charcoal; the\ndignity of the athletic contests for which they endlessly trained with\ncommoners’ vulgar gambling; the sophisticated and literate courtesans who\nattended to them at their drinking clubs, and common prostitutes _(porne)_\n—slave-girls housed in brothels near the agora, brothels often sponsored by\nthe democratic polis itself as a service to the sexual needs of its male\ncitizenry. In each case, they placed a world of gifts, generosity, and honor\nabove sordid commercial\nexchange.[61](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts061)\n\nThis resulted in a slightly different play of push and pull than we saw in\nMesopotamia. On the one hand, we see a culture of aristocratic protest against\nwhat they saw as the lowly commercial sensibilities of ordinary citizens. On\nthe other hand, we see an almost schizophrenic reaction on the part of the\nordinary citizens themselves, who simultaneously tried to limit or even ban\naspects of aristocratic culture and to imitate aristocratic sensibilities.\nPederasty is an excellent case in point here. On the one hand, man-boy love\nwas seen as the quintessential aristocratic practice—it was the way, in fact,\nthat young aristocrats would ordinarily become initiated into the privileges\nof high society. As a result, the democratic polis saw it as politically\nsubversive and made sexual relations between male citizens illegal. At the\nsame time, almost everyone began to practice it.\n\nThe famous Greek obsession with male honor that still informs so much of the\ntexture of daily life in rural communities in Greece hearkens back not so much\nto Homeric honor but to this aristocratic rebellion against the values of the\nmarketplace, which everyone, eventually, began to make their\nown.[62](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts062) The effects on women,\nthough, were even more severe than they had been in the Middle East. Already\nby the age of Socrates, while a man’s honor was increasingly tied to disdain\nfor commerce and assertiveness in public life, a woman’s honor had come to be\ndefined in almost exclusively sexual terms: as a matter of virginity, modesty,\nand chastity, to the extent that respectable women were expected to be shut up\ninside the household and any woman who played a part in public life was\nconsidered for that reason a prostitute, or tantamount to\none.[63](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts063) The Assyrian habit of\nveiling was not widely adopted in the Middle East, but it _was_ adopted in\nGreece. As much as it flies in the face of our stereotypes about the origins\nof “Western” freedoms, women in democratic Athens, unlike those of Persia or\nSyria, were expected to wear veils when they ventured out in\npublic.[64](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts064)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nMoney, then, had passed from a measure of honor to a measure of everything\nthat honor was not. To suggest that a man’s honor could be bought with money\nbecame a terrible insult—this despite the fact that, since men were often\ntaken in war or even by bandits or pirates and held for ransom, they often did\ngo through dramas of bondage and redemption not unlike those experienced by so\nmany Middle Eastern women. One particularly striking way of hammering it\nhome—actually, in this case, almost literally—was by branding ransomed\nprisoners with the mark of their own currency, much as if today some imaginary\nforeign kidnapper, after having received the ransom money for an American\nvictim, made a point of burning a dollar sign onto the victim’s forehead\nbefore returning him.[65](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts065)\n\nOne question that isn’t clear from all this is, Why? Why had money, in\nparticular, become such a symbol of degradation? Was it all because of\nslavery? One might be tempted to conclude that it was: perhaps the newfound\npresence of thousands of utterly degraded human beings in ancient Greek cities\nmade any suggestion that a free man (let alone a free woman) might in any\nsense be bought or sold particularly insulting. But this is clearly not the\ncase. Our discussion of the slave money of Ireland showed that the possibility\nof the utter degradation of a human being was in no sense a threat to heroic\nhonor—in a way, it was its very essence. Homeric Greeks do not appear to have\nbeen any different. It seems hardly coincidental that the quarrel between\nAgamemnon and Achilles that sets off the action of the _Iliad_ , generally\nconsidered to be the first great work of Western literature, is a dispute over\nhonor between two heroic warriors over the disposition of a slave\ngirl.[66](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts066) Agamemnon and\nAchilles were also well aware that it would only take an unfortunate turn in\nbattle, or perhaps a shipwreck, for either of them to wind up as a slave.\nOdysseus barely escapes being enslaved on several occasions in the _Odyssey_.\nEven in the third century ad, the Roman emperor Valerian (253–260 ad),\ndefeated at the Battle of Edessa, was captured and spent the last years of his\nlife as the footstool that the Sassanian emperor Shapur I used to mount his\nhorse. Such were the perils of war. All this was essential to the nature of\nmartial honor. A warrior’s honor is his willingness to play a game on which he\nstakes everything. His grandeur is directly proportional to how far he can\nfall.\n\nWas it, then, that the advent of commercial money threw traditional social\nhierarchies into disarray? Greek aristocrats often spoke this way, but the\ncomplaints seem rather disingenuous. Surely it was money that allowed such a\npolished aristocracy to exist in the first\nplace.[67](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts067) Rather, the thing\nthat really seemed to bother them about money was simply that they wanted it\nso much. Since money could be used to buy just about anything, everybody\nwanted it. That is: it was desirable _because_ it was non-discriminating. One\ncould see how the metaphor of the _porne_ might seem particularly appropriate.\nA woman “common to the people”—as the poet Archilochos put it—is available to\neveryone. In principle, we shouldn’t be attracted to such an undiscriminating\ncreature. In fact, of course, we\nare.[68](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts068) And nothing was both\nso undiscriminating, and so desirable, as money. True, Greek aristocrats would\nordinarily insist that they were not attracted to common _porne_ , and that\nthe courtesans, flute-girls, acrobats, and beautiful boys that frequented\ntheir symposia were not really prostitutes at all (though at times they also\nadmitted that they really were), they also struggled with the fact that their\nown high-minded pursuits, such as chariot-racing, outfitting ships for the\nnavy, and sponsoring tragic dramas, required the exact same coins as the ones\nused to buy cheap perfume and pies for a fisherman’s wife—the only real\ndifference being that their pursuits tended to require a lot more of\nthem.[69](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts069)\n\nWe might say, then, that money introduced a democratization of desire. Insofar\nas everyone wanted money, everyone, high and low, was pursuing the same\npromiscuous substance. But even more: increasingly, they did not just want\nmoney. They needed it. This was a profound change. In the Homeric world, as in\nmost human economies, we hear almost no discussion of those things considered\nnecessary to human life (food, shelter, clothing) because it is simply assumed\nthat everybody has them. A man with no possessions could, at the very least,\nbecome a retainer in some rich man’s household. Even slaves had enough to\neat.[70](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts070) Here too, the\nprostitute was a potent symbol for what had changed, since while some of the\ndenizens of brothels were slaves, others were simply poor; the fact that their\nbasic needs could no longer be taken for granted were precisely what made them\nsubmit to others’ desires. This extreme fear of dependency on others’ whims\nlies at the basis of the Greek obsession with the self-sufficient household.\n\nAll this lies behind the unusually assiduous efforts of the male citizens of\nGreek city-states—like the later Romans—to insulate their wives and daughters\nfrom both the dangers and the freedoms of the marketplace. Unlike their\nequivalents in the Middle East, they do not seem to have offered them as debt\npawns. Neither, at least in Athens, was it legal for the daughters of free\ncitizens to be employed as\nprostitutes.[71](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts071) As a result,\nrespectable women became invisible, largely removed from the high dramas of\neconomic and political\nlife.[72](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts072) If anyone was\nenslaved for debt, it was normally the debtor. Even more dramatically, it was\nordinarily _male_ citizens who accused one another of prostitution—with\nAthenian politicians regularly asserting that their rivals, when they were\nyoung boys being plied with gifts from their male suitors, were really trading\nsex for money, and hence deserved to lose their civic\nfreedoms.[73](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts073)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIt might be helpful here, to return to the principles laid out in chapter\nfive. What we see above all is the erosion both of older forms of\nhierarchy—the Homeric world of great men with their retainers—and, at the same\ntime, of older forms of mutual aid, with communistic relations increasingly\nbeing confined to the interior of the household.\n\nIt’s the former—the erosion of hierarchy—that really seems to have been at\nstake in the “debt crises” that struck so many Greek cities around 600 bc,\nright around the time that commercial markets were first taking\nshape.[74](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts074) When Aristotle spoke\nof the Athenian poor as falling slave to the rich, what he appears to have\nmeant was that in harsh years, many poor farmers fell into debt; as a result\nthey ended up as sharecroppers on their own property, dependents. Some were\neven sold abroad as slaves. This led to unrest and agitation, and also to\ndemands for clean slates, for the freeing of those held in bondage, and for\nthe redistribution of agricultural land. In a few cases it led to outright\nrevolution. In Megara, we are told, a radical faction that seized power not\nonly made interest-bearing loans illegal, but did so retroactively, forcing\ncreditors to make restitution of all interest they had collected in the\npast.[75](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts075) In other cities,\npopulist tyrants seized power on promises to abrogate agricultural debts.\n\nOn the face of it, all this doesn’t seem all that surprising: the moment when\ncommercial markets developed, Greek cities quickly developed all the social\nproblems that had been plaguing Middle Eastern cities for millennia: debt\ncrises, debt resistance, political unrest. In reality, things are not so\nclear. For one thing, for the poor to be “enslaved to the rich,” in the loose\nsense that Aristotle seems to be using, was hardly a new development. Even in\nHomeric society, it was assumed as a matter of course that rich men would live\nsurrounded by dependents and retainers, drawn from the ranks of the dependent\npoor. The critical thing, though, about such relations of patronage is that\nthey involved responsibilities on both sides. A noble warrior and his humble\nclient were assumed to be fundamentally different sorts of people, but both\nwere also expected to take account of each other’s (fundamentally different)\nneeds. Transforming patronage into debt relations—treating, say, an advance of\nseed corn as a _loan_ , let alone an interest-bearing loan—changed all\nthis.[76](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts076) What’s more, it did\nso in two completely contradictory respects. On the one hand, a loan implies\nno ongoing responsibilities on the part of the creditor. On the other, as I\nhave continually emphasized, a loan does assume a certain formal, legal\nequality between contractor and contractee. It assumes that they are, at least\nin some ways on some level, fundamentally the same kind of person. This is\ncertainly about the most ruthless and violent form of equality imaginable. But\nthe fact it was conceived as equality before the market made such arrangements\neven more difficult to\nendure.[77](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts077)\n\nThe same tensions can be observed between neighbors, who in farming\ncommunities tend to give, lend, and borrow things amongst themselves—anything\nfrom sieves and sickles, to charcoal and cooking oil, to seed corn or oxen for\nplowing. On the one hand, such giving and lending were considered essential\nparts of the basic fabric of human sociability in farm communities, on the\nother, overly demanding neighbors were a notorious irritant—one that could\nonly have grown worse when all parties are aware of precisely how much it\nwould have cost to buy or rent the same items that were being given away.\nAgain, one of the best ways to get a sense of what were considered everyday\ndilemmas for Mediterranean peasants is to look at jokes. Late stories from\nacross the Aegean in Turkey echo exactly the same concerns:\n\nNasruddin’s neighbor once came by ask if he could borrow his donkey for an\nunexpected errand. Nasruddin obliged, but the next day the neighbor was back\nagain—he needed to take some grain to be milled. Before long he was showing up\nalmost every morning, barely feeling he needed a pretext. Finally, Nasruddin\ngot fed up, and one morning told him his brother had already come by and taken\nthe donkey.\n\nJust as the neighbor was leaving he heard a loud braying sound from the yard.\n\n“Hey, I thought you said the donkey wasn’t here!”\n\n“Look, who are you going to believe?” asked Nasruddin. “Me, or some animal?”\n\nWith the appearance of money, it could also become unclear what was a gift,\nand what a loan. On the one hand, even with gifts, it was always considered\nbest to return something slightly better than one had\nreceived.[78](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts078) On the other\nhand, friends do not charge one another interest, and any suggestion that they\nmight was sure to rankle. So what’s the difference between a generous return\ngift and an interest payment? This is the basis of one of the most famous\nNasruddin stories, one that appears to have provided centuries of amusement\nfor peasants across the Mediterranean basin and adjoining regions. (It is\nalso, I might note, a play on the fact that in many Mediterranean languages,\nGreek included, the word for “interest” literally means “offspring.”)\n\nOne day Nasruddin’s neighbor, a notorious miser, came by to announce he was\nthrowing a party for some friends. Could he borrow some of Nasruddin’s pots?\nNasruddin didn’t have many but said he was happy to lend whatever he had. The\nnext day the miser returned, carrying Nasruddin’s three pots, and one tiny\nadditional one.\n\n“What’s that?” asked Nasrudddin.\n\n“Oh, that’s the offspring of the pots. They reproduced during the time they\nwere with me.”\n\nNasruddin shrugged and accepted them, and the miser left happy that he had\nestablished a principle of interest. A month later Nasruddin was throwing a\nparty, and he went over to borrow a dozen pieces of his neighbor’s much more\nluxurious crockery. The miser complied. Then he waited a day. And then another\n…\n\nOn the third day, the miser came by and asked what had happened to his pots.\n\n“Oh, them?” Nasruddin said sadly. “It was a terrible tragedy. They\ndied.”[79](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts079)\n\nIn a heroic system, it is only debts of honor—the need to repay gifts, to\nexact revenge, to rescue or redeem friends or kinsmen fallen prisoner—that\noperate completely under a logic of tit-for-tat exchange. Honor is the same as\ncredit; it’s one’s ability to keep one’s promises, but also, in the case of a\nwrong, to “get even.” As the last phrase implies, it was a monetary logic, but\nmoney, or anyway money-like relations, are confined to this. Gradually,\nsubtly, without anyone completely understanding the full implications of what\nwas happening, what had been the essence of moral relations turned into the\nmeans for every sort of dishonest stratagem.\n\nWe know a little about it from trial speeches, many of which have survived.\nHere is one from the fourth century, probably around 365 bc. Apollodorus was a\nprosperous but low-born Athenian citizen (his father, a banker, had begun life\nas a slave) who, like many such gentlemen, had acquired a country estate.\nThere he made a point of making friends with his closest neighbor,\nNicostratus, a man of aristocratic origins, though currently of somewhat\nstraitened means. They acted as neighbors normally did, giving and borrowing\nsmall sums, lending each other animals or slaves, minding each other’s\nproperty when one was away. Then one day Nicostratus ran into a piece of\nterrible luck. While trying to track down some runaway slaves, he was himself\ncaptured by pirates and held for ransom at the slave market on the island of\nAegina. His relatives could only assemble part of the price, so he was forced\nto borrow the rest from strangers in the market. These appear to have been\nprofessionals who specialized in such loans, and their terms were notoriously\nharsh: if not repaid in **thirty** days, the sum doubled; if not repaid at\nall, the debtor became the slave of the man who had put up the money for his\nredemption.\n\nTearfully, Nicostratus appealed to his neighbor. All his possessions were\nalready pledged now to one creditor or another; he knew Apollodorus wouldn’t\nhave that much cash lying around, but could his dear friend possibly put up\nsomething of his own by way of security? Apollodorus was moved. He would be\nhappy to forgive all debts Nicostratus already owed him, but the rest would be\ndifficult. Still, he would do his best. In the end, he arranged to himself\ntake a loan from an acquaintance of his, Arcesas, on the security of his town-\nhouse, at 16 percent annual interest, so as to be able to satisfy\nNicostratus’s creditors while Nicostratus himself arranged a friendly, no-\ninterest _eranos_ loan from his own relatives. But before long, Apollodorus\nbegan to realize that he had been set up. The impoverished aristocrat had\ndecided to take advantage of his nouveau-riche neighbor; he was actually\nworking with Arcesas and some of Apollodorus’s enemies to have him falsely\ndeclared a “public debtor,” that is, someone who had defaulted on an\nobligation to the public treasury. This would have first of all meant that he\nwould lose his right to take anyone to court (i.e., his deceivers, to recover\nthe money), and second, would give them a pretext to raid his house to remove\nhis furniture and other possessions. Presumably, Nicostratus had never felt\nespecially comfortable being in debt to a man he considered his social\ninferior. Rather like Egil the Viking, who would rather kill his friend Einar\nthan have to compose an elegy thanking him for an overly magnificent gift,\nNicostratus appears to have concluded that it was more honorable, or anyway\nmore bearable, to try to extract the money from his lowly friend through force\nand fraud than to spend the rest of his life feeling beholden. Before long,\nthings had indeed descended to outright physical violence, and the whole\nmatter ended up in court.[80](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts080)\n\nThe story has everything. We see mutual aid: the communism of the prosperous,\nthe expectation that if the need is great enough, or the cost manageable\nenough, friends and neighbors will help one\nanother.[81](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts081) And most did, in\nfact, have circles of people who would pool money if a crisis did arise:\nwhether a wedding, a famine, or a ransom. We also see the omnipresent danger\nof predatory violence that reduces human beings to commodities, and by doing\nso introduces the most cutthroat kinds of calculation into economic life—not\njust on the part of the pirates, but even more so, perhaps, on those\nmoneylenders lurking by the market offering stiff credit terms to anyone who\ncame to ransom their relatives but found themselves caught short, and who then\ncould appeal to the state to allow them to hire men with weapons to enforce\nthe contract. We see heroic pride, which sees too great an act of generosity\nas itself a kind of belittling assault. We see the ambiguity among gifts,\nloans, and commercial credit arrangements. Neither does the way things played\nout in this case seem particularly unusual, except perhaps for Nicostratus’s\nextraordinarily ingratitude. Prominent Athenians were always borrowing money\nto pursue their political projects; less-prominent ones were constantly\nworrying about their debts, or how to collect from their own\ndebtors.[82](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts082) Finally, there is\nanother, subtler element here. While everyday market transactions, at shops or\nstalls in the agora, were here as elsewhere typically conducted on credit, the\nmass production of coinage permitted a degree of anonymity for transactions\nthat, in a pure credit regime, simply could not\nexist.[83](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts083) Pirates and\nkidnappers do business in cash—yet the loan sharks at Aegina’s marketplace\ncould not have operated without them. It is on this same combination of\nillegal cash business, usually involving violence, and extremely harsh credit\nterms, also enforced through violence, that innumerable criminal underworlds\nhave been constructed ever since.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIn Athens, the result was extreme moral confusion. The language of money,\ndebt, and finance provided powerful—and ultimately irresistible—ways to think\nabout moral problems. Much as in Vedic India, people started talking about\nlife as a debt to the gods, of obligations as debts, about literal debts of\nhonor, of debt as sin and of vengeance as debt\ncollection.[84](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts084) Yet if debt was\nmorality—and certainly at the very least it was in the interest of creditors,\nwho often had little legal recourse to compel debtors to pay up, to insist\nthat it was—what was one to make of the fact that money, that very thing that\nseemed capable of turning morality into an exact and quantifiable science,\nalso seemed to encourage the very worst sorts of behavior?\n\nIt is from such dilemmas that modern ethics and moral philosophy begin. I\nthink this is true quite literally. Consider Plato’s _Republic_ , another\nproduct of fourth-century Athens. The book begins when Socrates visits an old\nfriend, a wealthy arms manufacturer, at the port of Piraeus. They get into a\ndiscussion of justice, which begins when the old man proposes that money\ncannot be a bad thing, since it allows those who have it to be just, and that\njustice consists in two things: telling the truth, and always paying one’s\ndebts.[85](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts085) The proposal is\neasily demolished. What, Socrates asks, if someone lent you his sword, went\nviolently insane, and then asked for it back (presumably, so he could kill\nsomeone)? Clearly it can never be right to arm a lunatic whatever the\ncircumstances.[86](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts086) The old man\ncheerfully shrugs the problem off and heads off to attend to some ritual,\nleaving his son to carry on the argument.\n\nThe son, Polemarchus, switches gears: clearly his father hadn’t meant “debt”\nin the literal sense of returning what one has borrowed. He meant it more in\nthe sense of giving people what is owed to them; repaying good with good and\nevil with evil; helping one’s friends and hurting one’s enemies. Demolishing\nthis one takes a little more work (are we saying justice plays no part in\ndetermining who one’s friends and enemies are? If so, wouldn’t someone who\ndecided he had no friends, and therefore tried to hurt everyone, be a just\nman? And even if you did have some way to say for certain that one’s enemy\nreally is an intrinsically bad person and deserves harm, by harming him, do\nyou not thus make him worse? Can turning bad people into even worse people\nreally be an example of justice?) but it is eventually accomplished. At this\npoint a Sophist, Thrasymachos, enters and denounces all of the debaters as\nmilky-eyed idealists. In reality, he says, all talk of “justice” is mere\npolitical pretext, designed to justify the interests of the powerful. And so\nit should be, because insofar as justice exists, it is simply that: the\ninterest of the powerful. Rulers are like shepherds. We like to think of them\nas benevolently tending their flocks, but what do shepherds ultimately _do_\nwith sheep? They kill and eat them, or sell the meat for money. Socrates\nresponds by pointing out that Thrasymachos is confusing the art of tending\nsheep with the art of profiting from them. The art of medicine aims to improve\nhealth, whether or not doctors get paid for practicing it. The art of\nshepherding aims to ensure the well-being of sheep, whether or not the\nshepherd (or his employer) is also a businessman who knows how to extract a\nprofit from them. Just so with the art of governance. If such an art exists,\nit must have its own intrinsic aim apart from any profit one might also get\nfrom it, and what can this be other than the establishment of social justice?\nIt’s only the existence of money, Socrates suggests, that allows us to imagine\nthat words like “power” and “interest” refer to universal realities that can\nbe pursued in their own right, let alone that all pursuits are really\nultimately the pursuit of power, advantage, or self-\ninterest.[87](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts087) The question, he\nsaid, is how to ensure that those who hold political office will do so not for\ngain, but rather for honor.\n\nI will leave off here. As we all know, Socrates eventually gets around to\noffering some political proposals of his own, involving philosopher kings; the\nabolition of marriage, the family, and private property; selective human\nbreeding boards. (Clearly, the book was meant to annoy its readers, and for\nmore than two thousand years, it has succeeded brilliantly.) What I want to\nemphasize, though, is the degree to which what we consider our core tradition\nof moral and political theory today springs from this question: What does it\nmean to pay our debts? Plato presents us first with the simple, literal\nbusinessman’s view. When this proves inadequate, he allows it to be reframed\nin heroic terms. Perhaps all debts are really debts of honor after\nall.[88](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts088) But heroic honor no\nlonger works in a world where (as Apollodorus sadly discovered) commerce,\nclass, and profit have so confused everything that peoples’ true motives are\nnever clear. How do we even know who our enemies are? Finally, Plato presents\nus with cynical realpolitik. Maybe nobody really owes anything to anybody.\nMaybe those who pursue profit for its own sake have it right after all. But\neven that does not hold up. We are left with a certainty that existing\nstandards are incoherent and self-contradictory, and that _some_ sort of\nradical break would be required in order to create a world that makes any\nlogical sense. But most of those who seriously consider a radical break along\nthe lines that Plato suggested have come to the conclusion that there might be\nfar worse things than moral incoherence. And there we have stood, ever since,\nin the midst of an insoluble dilemma.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIt’s not surprising that these issues weighed on Plato’s mind. Not seven years\nbefore, he had taken an ill-fated sea cruise and wound up being captured and,\nsupposedly like Nicostratus, offered for sale on the auction block at Aegina.\nHowever, Plato had better luck. A Libyan philosopher of the Epicurean school,\none Annikeris, happened to be in the market at the time. He recognized Plato\nand ransomed him. Plato felt honor-bound to try to repay him, and his Athenian\nfriends assembled twenty minas in silver with which to do so, but Annikeris\nrefused to accept the money, insisting that it was his honor to be able to\nbenefit a fellow lover of\nwisdom.[89](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts089) As indeed it was:\nAnnikeris has been remembered, and celebrated, for his generosity ever since.\nPlato went on to use the twenty minas to buy land for a school, the famous\nAcademy. And while he hardly showed the same ingratitude as Nicostratus, one\ndoes rather get the impression that even Plato wasn’t especially happy about\nthe fact that his subsequent career was, in a sense, made possible by his debt\nto a man who he probably considered an extremely minor philosopher—and\nAnnikeris wasn’t even Greek! At least this would help explain why Plato,\notherwise the inveterate name-dropper, never mentioned Annikeris. We know of\nhis existence only from later\nbiographers.[90](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts090)\n\n## Ancient Rome (Property and Freedom)\n\nIf Plato’s work testifies to how profoundly the moral confusion introduced by\ndebt has shaped our traditions of thought, Roman law reveals how much it has\nshaped even our most familiar institutions.\n\nGerman legal theorist Rudolf von Jhering famously remarked that ancient Rome\nhad conquered the world three times: the first time through its armies, the\nsecond through its religion, the third through its\nlaws.[91](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts091) He might have added:\neach time more thoroughly. The Empire, after all, only spanned a tiny portion\nof the globe; the Roman Catholic Church has spread farther; Roman law has come\nto provide the language and conceptual underpinnings of legal and\nconstitutional orders everywhere. Law students from South Africa to Peru are\nexpected to spend a good deal of their time memorizing technical terms in\nLatin, and it is Roman law that provides almost all our basic conceptions\nabout contract, obligation, torts, property, and jurisdiction—and, in a\nbroader sense, of citizenship, rights, and liberties on which political life,\ntoo, is based.\n\nThis was possible, Jhering held, because, the Romans were the first to turn\njurisprudence into a genuine science. Perhaps—but for all that, it remains\ntrue that Roman law has a few notoriously quirky features, some so odd that\nthey have confused and confounded jurists ever since Roman law was revived in\nItalian universities in the High Middle Ages. The most notorious of these is\nthe unique way it defines property. In Roman law, property, or _dominium_ , is\na relation between a person and a thing, characterized by absolute power of\nthat person over that thing. This definition has caused endless conceptual\nproblems. First of all, it’s not clear what it would mean for a human to have\na “relation” with an inanimate object. Human beings can have relations with\none another. But what would it mean to have a “relation” with a thing? And if\none did, what would it mean to give that relation legal standing? A simple\nillustration will suffice: imagine a man trapped on a desert island. He might\ndevelop extremely personal relationships with, say, the palm trees growing on\nthat island. If he’s there too long, he might well end up giving them all\nnames and spending half his time having imaginary conversations with them.\nStill, does he _own_ them? The question is meaningless. There’s no need to\nworry about property rights if noone else is there.\n\nClearly, then, property is not really a relation between a person and a thing.\nIt’s an understanding or arrangement between people concerning things. The\nonly reason that we sometimes fail to notice this is that in many\ncases—particularly when we are talking about our rights over our shoes, or\ncars, or power tools—we are talking of rights held, as English law puts it,\n“against all the world”—that is, understandings between ourselves and everyone\nelse on the planet, that they will all refrain from interfering with our\npossessions, and therefore allow us to treat them more or less any way we\nlike. A relation between one person and everyone else on the planet is,\nunderstandably, difficult to conceive as such. It’s easier to think of it as a\nrelationship with a thing. But even here, in practice this freedom to do as\none likes turns out to be fairly limited. To say that the fact that I own a\nchainsaw gives me an “absolute power” to do anything I want with it is\nobviously absurd. Almost anything I might think of doing with a chainsaw\noutside my own home or land is likely to be illegal, and there are only a\nlimited number of things I can really do with it inside. The only thing\n“absolute” about my rights to a chainsaw is my right to prevent anyone _else_\nfrom using it.[92](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts092)\n\nNonetheless, Roman law does insist that the basic form of property is private\nproperty, and that private property is the owner’s absolute power to do\nanything he wants with his possessions. Twelfth-century Medieval jurists came\nto refine this into three principles, _usus_ (use of the thing), _fructus_\n(fruits, i.e., enjoyment of the products of the thing), and _abusus_ (abuse or\ndestruction of the thing), but Roman jurists weren’t even interested in\nspecifying that much, since in a certain way, they saw the details as lying\nentirely outside the domain of law. In fact, scholars have spent a great deal\nof time debating whether Roman authors actually considered private property to\nbe a right _(ius),[ 93](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts093)_ for\nthe very reason that rights were ultimately based on agreements between\npeople, and one’s power to dispose of one’s property was not: it was just\none’s natural ability to do whatever one pleased when social impediments were\nabsent.[94](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts094)\n\nIf you think about it, this really is an odd place to start in developing a\ntheory of property law. It is probably fair to say that, in any part of the\nworld, in any period of history, whether in ancient Japan or Machu Picchu,\nsomeone who had a piece of string was free to twist it, knot it, pull it\napart, or toss it in the fire more or less as they had a mind to. Nowhere else\ndid legal theorists appear to have found this fact in any way interesting or\nimportant. Certainly no other tradition makes it the very basis of property\nlaw—since, after all, doing so made almost all actual law little more than a\nseries of exceptions.\n\nHow did this come about? And why? The most convincing explanation I’ve seen is\nOrlando Patterson’s: the notion of absolute private property is really derived\nfrom slavery. One can imagine property not as a relation between people, but\nas a relation between a person and a thing, if one’s starting point is a\nrelation between two people, one of whom is also a thing. (This is how slaves\nwere defined in Roman law: they were people who were also a _res_ , a\nthing.)[95](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts095) The emphasis on\nabsolute power begins to make sense as\nwell.[96](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts096)\n\nThe word _dominium_ , meaning absolute private property, was not particularly\nancient.[97](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts097) It only appears in\nLatin in the late Republic, right around the time when hundreds of thousands\nof captive laborers were pouring into Italy, and when Rome, as a consequence,\nwas becoming a genuine slave\nsociety.[98](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts098) By 50 bc, Roman\nwriters had come to simply assume that workers—whether the farmworkers\nharvesting peas in countryside plantations, the muleteers delivering those\npeas to shops in the city, or the clerks keeping count of them—were someone\nelse’s property. The existence of millions of creatures who were\nsimultaneously persons and things created endless legal problems, and much of\nthe creative genius of Roman law was spent in working out the endless\nramifications. One need only flip open a casebook of Roman law to get a sense\nof these. This is from the second-century jurist Ulpian:\n\nAgain, Mela writes that if some persons were playing ball and one of them,\nhitting the ball quite hard, knocked it against a barber’s hands, and in this\nway the throat of a slave, whom the barber was shaving, was cut by a razor\npressed against it, then who is the person with whom the culpability lay is\nliable under the Lex Aquilia [the law of civil damages]? Proclus says that the\nculpability lies with the barber; and indeed, if he was shaving at a place\nwhere games are normally played or where traffic was heavy, there is reason to\nfault him. But it would not be badly held that if someone entrusts himself to\na barber who has a chair in a dangerous place, he should have himself to\nblame.[99](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts099)\n\nIn other words, the master cannot claim civil damages against the ballplayers\nor barber for destroying his property if the real problem was that he bought a\nstupid slave. Many of these debates might strike us as profoundly exotic\n(could you be accused of theft for merely convincing a slave to run away? If\nsomeone killed a slave who was also your son, could you take your sentimental\nfeelings toward him into account in assessing damages, or would you have to\nstick to his market value?)—but our contemporary tradition of jurisprudence is\nfounded directly on such\ndebates.[100](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts100)\n\nAs for _dominium_ , the word is derived from _dominus_ , meaning “master” or\n“slave-owner,” but ultimately from _domus_ , meaning “house”or “household.”\nIt’s of course related to the English term “domestic,” which even now can be\nused either to mean “pertaining to private life,” or to refer to a servant who\ncleans the house. _Domus_ overlaps somewhat in meaning with _familia_ ,\n“family”—but, as proponents of “family values” might be interested to know,\n_familia_ itself ultimately derives from the word _famulus_ , meaning “slave.”\nA family was originally all those people under the domestic authority of a\n_paterfamilias_ , and that authority was, in early Roman law at least,\nconceived as absolute.[101](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts101) A\nman did not have total power over his wife, since she was still to some degree\nunder the protection of her own father, but his children, slaves, and other\ndependents were his to do with as he wanted—at least in early Roman law, he\nwas perfectly free to whip, torture, or sell them. A father could even execute\nhis children, provided he found them to have committed capital\ncrimes.[102](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts102) With his slaves,\nhe didn’t even need that excuse.\n\nIn creating a notion of _dominium_ , then, and thus creating the modern\nprinciple of absolute private property, what Roman jurists were doing first of\nall was taking a principle of domestic authority, of absolute power over\npeople, defining some of those people (slaves) as things, and then extending\nthe logic that originally applied to slaves to geese, chariots, barns, jewelry\nboxes, and so forth—that is, to every other sort of thing that the law had\nanything to do with.\n\nIt was quite extraordinary, even in the ancient world, for a father to have\nthe right to execute his slaves—let alone his children. No one is quite sure\nwhy the early Romans were so extreme in this regard. It’s telling, though,\nthat the earliest Roman debt law was equally unusual in its harshness, since\nit allowed creditors to execute insolvent\ndebtors.[103](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts103) The early history\nof Rome, like the histories of early Greek city-states, was one of continual\npolitical struggle between creditors and debtors, until the Roman elite\neventually figured out the principle that most successful Mediterranean elites\nlearned: that a free peasantry means a more effective army, and that\nconquering armies can provide war captives who can do anything debt bondsmen\nused to do, and therefore, a social compromise—allowing limited popular\nrepresentation, banning debt slavery, channeling some of the fruits of empire\ninto social-welfare payments—was actually in their interest. Presumably, the\nabsolute power of fathers developed as part of this whole constellation in the\nsame way as we’ve seen elsewhere. Debt bondage reduced family relations to\nrelations of property; social reforms retained the new power of fathers but\nprotected them from debt. At the same time, the increasing influx of slaves\nsoon meant that any even moderately prosperous household was likely to contain\nslaves. This meant that the logic of conquest extended into the most intimate\naspects of everyday life. Conquered people poured one’s bath and combed one’s\nhair. Conquered tutors taught one’s children about poetry. Since slaves were\nsexually available to owners and their families, as well as to their friends\nand dinner guests, it is likely that most Romans’ first sexual experience was\nwith a boy or girl whose legal status was conceived as that of a defeated\nenemy.[104](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts104)\n\nOver time, this became more and more of a legal fiction—actual slaves were\nmuch more likely to have been paupers sold by parents, unfortunates kidnapped\nby pirates or bandits, victims of wars or judicial process among barbarians at\nthe fringes of the empire, or children of other\nslaves.[105](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts105) Still, the fiction\nwas maintained.\n\nWhat made Roman slavery so unusual, in historical terms, was a conjuncture of\ntwo factors. One was its very arbitrariness. In dramatic contrast with, say\nplantation slavery in the Americas, there was no sense that certain people\nwere naturally inferior and therefore destined to be slaves. Instead, slavery\nwas seen as a misfortune that could happen to\nanyone.[106](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts106) As a result, there\nwas no reason that a slave might not be in every way superior to his or her\nmaster: smarter, with a finer sense of morality, better taste, and a greater\nunderstanding of philosophy. The master might even be willing to acknowledge\nthis. There was no reason not to, since it had no effect on the nature of the\nrelationship, which was simply one of power.\n\nThe second was the absolute nature of this power. There are many places where\nslaves are conceived as war captives, and masters as conquerors with absolute\npowers of life and death—but usually, this is something of an abstract\nprinciple. Almost everywhere, governments quickly move to limit such rights.\nAt the very least, emperors and kings will insist that they are the only ones\nwith the power to order others put to\ndeath.[107](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts107) But under the Roman\nRepublic there was no emperor; insofar as there was a sovereign body, it was\nthe collective body of the slave-owners themselves. Only under the early\nEmpire do we see any legislation limiting what owners could do to their\n(human) property: the first being a law of the time of the emperor Tiberius\n(dated 16 ad) stipulating that a master had to obtain a magistrate’s\npermission before ordering a slave publicly torn apart by wild\nbeasts.[108](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts108) However, the\nabsolute nature of the master’s power—the fact that in this context, he\neffectively _was_ the state—also meant that there were also, at first, no\nrestrictions on manumission: a master could liberate his slave, or even adopt\nhim or her, whereby—since liberty meant nothing outside of membership in a\ncommunity—that slave automatically became a Roman citizen. This led to some\nvery peculiar arrangements. In the first century ad, for example, it was not\nuncommon for educated Greeks to have themselves sold into slavery to some\nwealthy Roman in need of a secretary, entrust the money to a close friend or\nfamily member, and then, after a certain interval, buy themselves back, thus\nobtaining Roman citizenship. This despite the fact that, during such time as\nthey were slaves, if their owner decided to, say, cut one of his secretary’s\nfeet off, legally, he would have been perfectly free to do\nso.[109](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts109)\n\nThe relation of _dominus_ and slave thus brought a relation of conquest, of\nabsolute political power into the household (in fact, made it the essence of\nthe household). It’s important to emphasize that this was not a moral relation\non either side. A well-known legal formula, attributed to a Republican lawyer\nnamed Quintus Haterius, brings this home with particular clarity. With the\nRomans as with the Athenians, for a male to be the object of sexual\npenetration was considered unbefitting to a citizen. In defending a freedman\naccused of continuing to provide sexual favors to his former master, Haterius\ncoined an aphorism that was later to become something of a popular dirty joke:\n_impudicitia in ingenuo crimen est, in servo necessitas, in liberto officium_\n(“to be the object of anal penetration is a crime in the freeborn, a necessity\nfor a slave, a duty for a\nfreedman”).[110](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts110) What is\nsignificant here is that sexual subservience is considered the “duty” only of\nthe freedman. It is not considered the “duty” of a slave. This is because,\nagain, slavery was not a moral relation. The master could do what he liked,\nand there was nothing the slave could do about it.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe most insidious effect of Roman slavery, however, is that through Roman\nlaw, it has come to play havoc with our idea of human freedom. The meaning of\nthe Roman word _libertas_ itself changed dramatically over time. As everywhere\nin the ancient world, to be “free” meant, first and foremost, not to be a\nslave. Since slavery means above all the annihilation of social ties and the\nability to form them, freedom meant the capacity to make and maintain moral\ncommitments to others. The English word “free,” for instance, is derived from\na German root meaning “friend,” since to be free meant to be able to make\nfriends, to keep promises, to live within a community of equals. This is why\nfreed slaves in Rome became citizens: to be free, by definition, meant to be\nanchored in a civic community, with all the rights and responsibilities that\nthis entailed.[111](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts111)\n\nBy the second century ad, however, this had begun to change. The jurists\ngradually redefined _libertas_ until it became almost indistinguishable from\nthe power of the master. It was the right to do absolutely anything, with the\nexception, again, of all those things one could not do. Actually, in the\n_Digest_ , the definitions of freedom and slavery appear back to back:\n\nFreedom is the natural faculty to do whatever one wishes that is not prevented\nby force or law. Slavery is an institution according to the law of nations\nwhereby one person becomes private property _(dominium)_ of another, contrary\nto nature.[112](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts112)\n\nMedieval commentators immediately noticed the problem\nhere.[113](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts113) But wouldn’t this\nmean that everyone is free? After all, even slaves are free to do absolutely\nanything they’re actually permitted to do. To say a slave is free (except\ninsofar as he isn’t) is a bit like saying the earth is square (except insofar\nas it is round), or that the sun is blue (except insofar as it is yellow), or,\nagain, that we have an absolute right to do anything we wish with our chainsaw\n(except those things that we can’t.)\n\nIn fact, the definition introduces all sorts of complications. If freedom is\nnatural, then surely slavery is unnatural, but if freedom and slavery are just\nmatters of degree, then, logically, would not _all_ restrictions on freedom be\nto some degree unnatural? Would not that imply that society, social rules, in\nfact even property rights, are unnatural as well? This is precisely what many\nRoman jurists did conclude—that is, when they did venture to comment on such\nabstract matters, which was only rarely. Originally, human beings lived in a\nstate of nature where all things were held in common; it was war that first\ndivided up the world, and the resultant “law of nations,” the common usages of\nmankind that regulate such matters as conquest, slavery, treaties, and\nborders, that was first responsible for inequalities of property as\nwell.[114](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts114)\n\nThis in turn meant that there was no intrinsic difference between private\nproperty and political power—at least, insofar as that power was based in\nviolence. As time went on, Roman emperors also began claiming something like\n_dominium_ , insisting that within their dominions, they had absolute\nfreedom—in fact, that they were not bound by\nlaws.[115](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts115) At the same time, as\nRoman society shifted from a republic of slave-holders to arrangements that\nincreasingly resembled later feudal Europe, with magnates on their great\nestates surrounded by dependent peasants, debt servants, and an endless\nvariety of slaves—with whom they could largely do as they pleased. The\nbarbarian invasions that overthrew the empire merely formalized the situation,\nlargely eliminating chattel slavery, but at the same time introducing the\nnotion that the noble classes were really descendants of the Germanic\nconquerors, and that the common people were inherently subservient.\n\nStill, even in this new Medieval world, the old Roman concept of freedom\nremained. Freedom was simply power. When Medieval political theorists spoke of\n“liberty,” they were normally referring to a lord’s right to do whatever he\nwanted within his own domains. This was, again, usually assumed to be not\nsomething originally established by agreement, but a mere fact of conquest:\none famous English legend holds that when, around 1290, King Edward I asked\nhis lords to produce documents to demonstrate by what right they held their\nfranchises (or “liberties”), the Earl Warenne presented the king only with his\nrusty sword.[116](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts116) Like Roman\n_dominium_ , it was less a right than a power, and a power exercised first and\nforemost over people—which is why in the Middle Ages it was common to speak of\nthe “liberty of the gallows,” meaning a lord’s right to maintain his own\nprivate place of execution.\n\nBy the time Roman law began to be recovered and modernized in the twelfth\ncentury, the term _dominium_ posed a particular problem, since it had come, in\nordinary church Latin of the time, to be used equally for “lordship” and\n“private property.” Medieval jurists spent a great deal of time and argument\nestablishing whether there was indeed a difference between the two. It was a\nparticularly thorny problem because, if property rights really were, as the\n_Digest_ insisted, a form of absolute power, it was very difficult to see how\nanyone could have it but a king—or even, for certain jurists,\nGod.[117](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts117)\n\nThis is not the place to describe the resulting arguments, but I feel it’s\nimportant to end here because in a way, it brings us full circle and allows us\nto understand precisely how Liberals like Adam Smith were able to imagine the\nworld the way they did. This is a tradition that assumes that liberty is\nessentially the right to do what one likes with one’s own property. In fact,\nnot only does it make property a right; it treats rights themselves as a form\nof property. In a way, this is the greatest paradox of all. We are so used to\nthe idea of “having” rights—that rights are something one can possess—that we\nrarely think about what this might actually mean. In fact (as Medieval jurists\nwere well aware), one man’s right is simply another’s obligation. My right to\nfree speech is others’ obligation not to punish me for speaking; my right to a\ntrial by a jury of my peers is the responsibility of the government to\nmaintain a system of jury duty. The problem is just the same as it was with\nproperty rights: when we are talking about obligations owed by everyone in the\nentire world, it’s difficult to think about it that way. It’s much easier to\nspeak of “having” rights and freedoms. Still, if freedom is basically our\nright to own things, or to treat things as if we own them, then what would it\nmean to “own” a freedom—wouldn’t it have to mean that our right to own\nproperty is _itself_ a form of property? That does seem unnecessarily\nconvoluted. What possible reason would one have to want to define it this\nway?[118](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts118)\n\nHistorically, there is a simple—if somewhat disturbing—answer to this. Those\nwho have argued that we are the natural owners of our rights and liberties\nhave been mainly interested in asserting that we should be free to give them\naway, or even to sell them.\n\nModern ideas of rights and liberties are derived from what, from the time when\nJean Gerson, Rector of the University of Paris, began to lay them out around\n1400, building on Roman law concepts, came to be known as “natural rights\ntheory.” As Richard Tuck, the premier historian of such ideas, has long noted,\nit is one of the great ironies of history that this was always a body of\ntheory embraced not by the progressives of that time, but by conservatives.\n“For a Gersonian, liberty was property and could be exchanged in the same way\nand in the same terms as any other property”—sold, swapped, loaned, or\notherwise voluntarily\nsurrendered.[119](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts119) It followed\nthat there could be nothing intrinsically wrong with, say, debt peonage, or\neven slavery. And this is exactly what natural-rights theorists came to\nassert. In fact, over the next centuries, these ideas came to be developed\nabove all in Antwerp and Lisbon, cities at the very center of the emerging\nslave trade. After all, they argued, we don’t really know what’s going on in\nthe lands behind places like Calabar, but there is no intrinsic reason to\nassume that the vast majority of the human cargo conveyed to European ships\nhad not sold themselves, or been disposed of by their legal guardians, or lost\ntheir liberty in some other perfectly legitimate fashion. No doubt some had\nnot, but abuses will exist in any system. The important thing was that there\nwas nothing inherently unnatural or illegitimate about the idea that freedom\n_could_ be sold.[120](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts120)\n\nBefore long, similar arguments came to be employed to justify the absolute\npower of the state. Thomas Hobbes was the first to really develop this\nargument in the seventeenth century, but it soon became commonplace.\nGovernment was essentially a contract, a kind of business arrangement, whereby\ncitizens had voluntarily given up some of their natural liberties to the\nsovereign. Finally, similar ideas have become the basis of that most basic,\ndominant institution of our present economic life: wage labor, which is,\neffectively, the renting of our freedom in the same way that slavery can be\nconceived as its sale.[121](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts121)\n\nIt’s not only our freedoms that we own; the same logic has come to be applied\neven to our own bodies, which are treated, in such formulations, as really no\ndifferent than houses, cars, or furniture. We own ourselves, therefore\noutsiders have no right to trespass on\nus.[122](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts122) Again, this might seem\nan innocuous, even a positive notion, but it looks rather different when we\ntake into consideration the Roman tradition of property on which it is based.\nTo say that we own ourselves is, oddly enough, to cast ourselves as both\nmaster and slave simultaneously. “We” are both owners (exerting absolute power\nover our property), and yet somehow, at the same time, the things being owned\n(being the object of absolute power). The ancient Roman household, far from\nhaving been forgotten in the mists of history, is preserved in our most basic\nconception of ourselves—and, once again, just as in property law, the result\nis so strangely incoherent that it spins off into endless paradoxes the moment\none tries to figure out what it would actually mean in practice. Just as\nlawyers have spent a thousand years trying to make sense of Roman property\nconcepts, so have philosophers spent centuries trying to understand how it\ncould be possible for us to have a relation of domination over ourselves. The\nmost popular solution—to say that each of us has something called a “mind” and\nthat this is completely separate from something else, which we can call “the\nbody,” and that the first thing holds natural dominion over the second—flies\nin the face of just about everything we now know about cognitive science. It’s\nobviously untrue, but we continue to hold onto it anyway, for the simple\nreason that none of our everyday assumptions about property, law, and freedom\nwould make any sense without\nit.[123](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts123)\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe first four chapters of this book describe a dilemma. We don’t really know\nhow to think about debt. Or, to be more accurate, we seem to be trapped\nbetween imagining society in the Adam Smith mode, as a collection of\nindividuals whose only significant relations are with their own possessions,\nhappily bartering one thing for another for the sake of mutual convenience,\nwith debt almost entirely abolished from the picture, and a vision in which\ndebt is everything, the very substance of all human relations—which of course\nleaves everyone with the uncomfortable sense that human relations are somehow\nan intrinsically tawdry business, that our very responsibilities to one\nanother are already somehow necessarily based in sin and crime. It’s not an\nappealing set of alternatives.\n\nIn the last three chapters I have tried to show that there is another way of\nlooking at things, and then to describe how it is that we got here. This is\nwhy I developed the concept of human economies: ones in which what is\nconsidered really important about human beings is the fact that they are each\na unique nexus of relations with others—therefore, that no one could ever be\nconsidered exactly equivalent to anything or anyone else. In a human economy,\nmoney is not a way of buying or trading human beings, but a way of expressing\njust how much one cannot do so.\n\nI then went on to describe how all this can begin to break down: how humans\ncan become objects of exchange: first, perhaps, women given in marriage;\nultimately, slaves captured in war. What all these relations have in common, I\nobserved, was violence. Whether it is Tiv girls being tied up and beaten for\nrunning away from their husbands, or husbands being herded into slave ships to\ndie on faraway plantations, that same principle always applies: it is only by\nthe threat of sticks, ropes, spears, and guns that one can tear people out of\nthose endlessly complicated webs of relationship with others (sisters,\nfriends, rivals …) that render them unique, and thus reduce them to something\nthat can be traded.\n\nAll of this, it is important to emphasize, can happen in places where markets\nin ordinary, everyday goods—clothing, tools, foodstuffs—do not even exist. In\nfact, in most human economies, one’s most important possessions could never be\nbought and sold for the same reasons that people can’t: they are unique\nobjects, caught up in a web of relationships with human\nbeings.[124](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts124)\n\nMy old professor John Comaroff used to tell a story about carrying out a\nsurvey in Natal, in South Africa. He had spent most of a week driving from\nhomestead to homestead in a jeep with a box full of questionnaires and a Zulu-\nspeaking interpreter, driving past apparently endless herds of cattle. After\nabout six days, his interpreter suddenly started and pointed into the middle\nof one herd. “Look!” he said. “That’s the same cow! That one there—with the\nred spot on its back. We saw it three days ago in a place ten miles from here.\nI wonder what happened? Did someone get married? Or maybe there was a\nsettlement to some dispute.”\n\nIn human economies, when this ability to rip people from their contexts does\nappear, it is most often seen as an end in itself. One can already see a hint\nof this among the Lele. Important men would occasionally acquire war captives\nfrom far away as slaves, but it was almost always to be sacrificed at their\nfuneral.[125](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts125) The squelching of\none man’s individuality was seen as somehow swelling the reputation, the\nsocial existence, of the\nother.[126](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts126) In what I’ve been\ncalling heroic societies, of course this kind of addition and subtraction of\nhonor and disgrace is lifted from a somewhat marginal practice to become the\nvery essence of politics. As endless epics, sagas, and eddas attest, heroes\nbecome heroes by making others small. In Ireland and Wales, we can observe how\nthis very ability to degrade others, to remove unique human beings from their\nhearths and families and thus render them anonymous units of accounting—the\nIrish slave-girl currency, the Welsh washerwomen—is itself the highest\nexpression of honor.\n\nIn heroic societies, the role of violence is not hidden—it’s glorified. Often,\nit can form the basis of one’s most intimate relations. In the _Iliad_ ,\nAchilles sees nothing shameful in his relation with his slave-girl, Briseis,\nwhose husband and brothers he killed; he refers to her as his “prize of\nhonor,” but almost in the very same breath, he also insists that, just any\ndecent man must love and care for his household dependents, “so I from my\nheart loved this one, even though I won her with my\nspear.”[127](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts127)\n\nThat such relations of intimacy can often develop between men of honor and\nthose they have stripped of their dignity, history can well attest. After all,\nthe annihilation of any possibility of equality also eliminates any question\nof debt, of any relation other than power. It allows a certain clarity. This\nis presumably why emperors and kings have such a notorious tendency to\nsurround themselves with slaves or eunuchs.\n\nThere is something more here, though. If one looks across the expanse of\nhistory, one cannot help but notice a curious sense of identification between\nthe most exalted and the most degraded; particularly, between emperors and\nkings, and slaves. Many kings surround themselves with slaves, appoint slave\nministers—there have even been, as with the Mamluks in Egypt, actual dynasties\nof slaves. Kings surround themselves with slaves for the same reason that they\nsurround themselves with eunuchs: because the slaves and criminals have no\nfamilies or friends, no possibility of other loyalties—or at least that, in\nprinciple, they shouldn’t. But in a way, kings should really be like that too.\nAs many an African proverb emphasizes: a proper king has no relatives either,\nor at least, he acts as if he does\nnot.[128](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts128) In other words, the\nking and slave are mirror images, in that unlike normal human beings who are\ndefined by their commitments to others, they are defined _only_ by relations\nof power. They are as close to perfectly isolated, alienated beings as one can\npossibly become.\n\nAt this point we can finally see what’s really at stake in our peculiar habit\nof defining ourselves simultaneously as master and slave, reduplicating the\nmost brutal aspects of the ancient household in our very concept of ourselves,\nas masters of our freedoms, or as owners of our very selves. It is the only\nway that we can imagine ourselves as completely isolated beings. There is a\ndirect line from the new Roman conception of liberty—not as the ability to\nform mutual relationships with others, but as the kind of absolute power of\n“use and abuse” over the conquered chattel who make up the bulk of a wealthy\nRoman man’s household—to the strange fantasies of liberal philosophers like\nHobbes, Locke, and Smith, about the origins of human society in some\ncollection of thirty- or forty-year-old males who seem to have sprung from the\nearth fully formed, then have to decide whether to kill each other or begin to\nswap beaver pelts.[129](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts129)\n\nEuropean and American intellectuals, it is true, have spent much of the last\ntwo hundred years trying to flee from the more disturbing implications of this\ntradition of thought. Thomas Jefferson, that owner of many slaves, chose to\nbegin the Declaration of Independence by directly contradicting the moral\nbasis of slavery, writing “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all\nmen are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\ninalienable Rights …”—thus undercutting simultaneously any argument that\nAfricans were racially inferior, and also that they or their ancestors could\never have been justly and legally deprived of their freedom. In doing so,\nhowever, he did not propose some radically new conception of rights and\nliberties. Neither have subsequent political philosophers. For the most part,\nwe’ve just kept the old ones, but with the word “not” inserted here and there.\nMost of our most precious rights and freedoms are a series of exceptions to an\noverall moral and legal framework that suggests we shouldn’t really have them\nin the first place.\n\nFormal slavery has been eliminated, but (as anyone who works from nine to five\ncan testify) the idea that you can alienate your liberty, at least\ntemporarily, endures. In fact, it determines what most of us have to do for\nmost of our waking hours, except, usually, on weekends. The violence has been\nlargely pushed out of\nsight.[130](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-nts130) But this is largely\nbecause we’re no longer able to imagine what a world based on social\narrangements that did not require the continual threat of tasers and\nsurveillance cameras would even look like.\n\n\n# Chapter Eight  \n  \nCREDIT VERSUS BULLION\n\n# _AND THE CYCLES OF HISTORY_\n\n_Bullion is the accessory of war, and not of peaceful trade_.\n\n—Geoffrey W. Gardiner\n\nONE MIGHT WELL ASK: If our political and legal ideas really are founded on the\nlogic of slavery, then how did we ever eliminate slavery? Of course, a cynic\nmight argue that we haven’t; we’ve just relabeled it. The cynic would have a\npoint: an ancient Greek would certainly have seen the distinction between a\nslave and an indebted wage laborer as, at best, a legalistic\nnicety.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts001) Still, even the\nelimination of formal chattel slavery has to be considered a remarkable\nachievement, and it is worthwhile to wonder how it was accomplished.\nEspecially since it was not just accomplished once. The truly remarkable\nthing, if one consults the historical record, is that slavery has been\neliminated—or effectively eliminated—many times in human history.\n\nIn Europe, for instance, the institution largely vanished in the centuries\nfollowing the collapse of the Roman empire—an historical achievement rarely\nrecognized by those of us used to referring to these events as the beginning\nof “the Dark Ages.”[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts002) No one\nis quite sure how it happened. Most agree that the spread of Christianity must\nhave had something to do with it, but that can’t have been the direct cause,\nsince the Church itself was never explicitly opposed to the institution and in\nmany cases defended it. Instead, the abolition appears to have happened\n_despite_ the attitudes of both the intellectuals and the political\nauthorities of the time. Yet it did happen, and it had lasting effects. On the\npopular level, slavery remained so universally detested that even a thousand\nyears later, when European merchants started trying to revive the trade, they\ndiscovered that their compatriots would not countenance slaveholding in their\nown countries—one reason why planters were eventually obliged to acquire their\nslaves in Africa and set up plantations in the New\nWorld.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts003) It is one of the\ngreat ironies of history that modern racism—probably the single greatest evil\nof our last two centuries—had to be invented largely because Europeans\ncontinued to refuse to listen to the arguments of the intellectuals and\njurists and did not accept that anyone they believed to be a full and equal\nhuman being could ever be justifiably enslaved.\n\nWhat’s more, the demise of ancient slavery was not limited to Europe.\nRemarkably, right around the same time—in the years around 600 ad—we find\nalmost exactly the same thing happening in India and China, where, over the\ncourse of centuries, amidst much unrest and confusion, chattel slavery largely\nceased to exist. What all this suggests is that moments of historical\nopportunity—moments when meaningful change is possible—follow a distinct, even\na cyclical pattern, one that has long been far more coordinated across\ngeographical space than we would ever have imagined. There is a shape to the\npast, and it is only by understanding it that we can begin to have a sense of\nthe historical opportunities that exist in the present.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe easiest way to make these cycles visible is to reexamine exactly the\nphenomenon we’ve been concerned with over the course of this book: the history\nof money, debt, and credit. The moment we begin to map the history of money\nacross the last five thousand years of Eurasian history, startling patterns\nbegin to emerge. In the case of money, one event stands out above all others:\nthe invention of coinage. Coinage appears to have arisen independently in\nthree different places, almost simultaneously: on the Great Plain of northern\nChina, in the Ganges river valley of northeast India, and in the lands\nsurrounding the Aegean Sea, in each case, between roughly 600 and 500 bc. This\nwasn’t due to some sudden technological innovation: the technologies used in\nmaking the first coins were, in each case, entirely\ndifferent.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts004) It was a social\ntransformation. Why this happened in exactly this way is an historical\nmystery. But this much we know: for some reason, in Lydia, India, and China,\nlocal rulers decided that whatever longstanding credit systems had existed in\ntheir kingdoms were no longer adequate, and they began to issue tiny pieces of\nprecious metals—metals that had previously been used largely in international\ncommerce, in ingot form—and to encourage their subjects to use them in day-to-\nday transactions.\n\nFrom there, the innovation spread. For more than a thousand years, states\neverywhere started issuing their own coinage. But then, right around 600 ad,\nabout the time that slavery was disappearing, the whole trend was suddenly\nthrown into reverse. Cash dried up. Everywhere, there was a movement back to\ncredit once again.\n\nIf we look at Eurasian history over the course of the last five thousand\nyears, what we see is a broad alternation between periods dominated by credit\nmoney and periods in which gold and silver come to dominate—that is, those\nduring which at least a large share of transactions were conducted with pieces\nof valuable metal being passed from hand to hand.\n\nWhy? The single most important factor would appear to be war. Bullion\npredominates, above all, in periods of generalized violence. There’s a very\nsimple reason for that. Gold and silver coins are distinguished from credit\narrangements by one spectacular feature: they can be stolen. A debt is, by\ndefinition, a record, as well as a relation of trust. Someone accepting gold\nor silver in exchange for merchandise, on the other hand, need trust nothing\nmore than the accuracy of the scales, the quality of the metal, and the\nlikelihood that someone else will be willing to accept it. In a world where\nwar and the threat of violence are everywhere—and this appears to have been an\nequally accurate description of Warring States China, Iron Age Greece, and\npre-Mauryan India—there are obvious advantages to making one’s transactions\nsimple. This is all the more true when dealing with soldiers. On the one hand,\nsoldiers tend to have access to a great deal of loot, much of which consists\nof gold and silver, and will always seek a way to trade it for the better\nthings in life. On the other, a heavily armed itinerant soldier is the very\ndefinition of a poor credit risk. The economists’ barter scenario might be\nabsurd when applied to transactions between neighbors in the same small rural\ncommunity, but when dealing with a transaction between the resident of such a\ncommunity and a passing mercenary, it suddenly begins to make a great deal of\nsense.\n\nFor much of human history, then, an ingot of gold of silver, stamped or not,\nhas served the same role as the contemporary drug dealer’s suitcase full of\nunmarked bills: an object without a history, valuable because one knows it\nwill be accepted in exchange for other goods just about anywhere, no questions\nasked. As a result, while credit systems tend to dominate in periods of\nrelative social peace, or across networks of trust (whether created by states\nor, in most periods, transnational institutions like merchant guilds or\ncommunities of faith), in periods characterized by widespread war and plunder,\nthey tend to be replaced by precious metal. What’s more, while predatory\nlending goes on in every period of human history, the resulting debt crises\nappear to have the most damaging effects at times when money is most easily\nconvertible into cash.\n\nAs a starting point to any attempt to discern the great rhythms that define\nthe current historical moment, let me propose the following breakdown of\nEurasian history according to the alternation between periods of virtual and\nmetal money. The cycle begins with the Age of the First Agrarian Empires\n(3500–800 bc), dominated by virtual credit money. This is followed by the\nAxial Age (800 bc-600 ad), which will be covered in the next chapter, and\nwhich saw the rise of coinage and a general shift to metal bullion. The Middle\nAges (600–1450 ad), which saw a return to virtual credit money, will be\ncovered in [chapter 10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm)**;** [chapter\n11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c11_r1.htm) will cover the next turn of the cycle,\nthe Age of Capitalist Empires, which began around 1450 with a massive\nplanetary switch back to gold and silver bullion, and which could only really\nbe said to have ended in 1971, when Richard Nixon announced that the U.S.\ndollar would no longer be redeemable in gold. This marked the beginning of yet\nanother phase of virtual money, one which has only just begun, and whose\nultimate contours are, necessarily, invisible. [Chapter\n12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm), the final chapter, will be devoted to\napplying the insights of history to understanding what it might mean and the\nopportunities it might throw open.\n\n## Mesopotamia  \n(3500–800 BC)\n\nWe have already had occasion to note the predominance of credit money in\nMesopotamia, the earliest urban civilization that we know about. In the great\ntemple and palace complexes, not only did money serve largely as an accounting\nmeasure rather than physically changing hands, merchants and tradespeople\ndeveloped credit arrangements of their own. Most of these took the physical\nform of clay tablets, inscribed with some obligation of future payment, that\nwere then sealed inside clay envelopes and marked with the borrower’s seal.\nThe creditor would keep the envelope as a surety, and it would be broken open\non repayment. In some times or places at least, these _bullae_ appear to have\nbecome what we would now call negotiable instruments, since the tablet inside\ndid not simply record a promise to pay the original lender, but was designated\n“to the bearer”—in other words, a tablet recording a debt of five shekels of\nsilver (at prevailing rates of interest) could circulate as the equivalent of\na five-shekel promissory note—that is, as\nmoney.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts005)\n\nWe don’t know how often this happened; how many hands such tablets would\ntypically pass through, how many transactions were based on credit, how often\nmerchants actually did weigh out silver in rough chunks to buy and sell their\nmerchandise, or when they were most likely to do so. No doubt all this varied\nover time. Promissory notes usually circulated within merchant guilds, or\nbetween inhabitants of the relatively well-off urban neighborhoods where\npeople knew one another well enough to trust them to be accountable, but not\nso well that they could rely on one another for more traditional forms of\nmutual aid.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts006) We know even\nless about the marketplaces frequented by ordinary Mesopotamians, except that\ntavern-keepers operated on credit, and hawkers and operators of market stalls\nprobably did as well.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts007)\n\nThe origins of interest will forever remain obscure, since they preceded the\ninvention of writing. The terminology for interest in most ancient languages\nis derived from some word for “offspring,” causing some to speculate that it\noriginates in loans of livestock, but this seems a bit literal-minded. More\nlikely, the first widespread interest-bearing loans were commercial: temples\nand palaces would forward wares to merchants and commercial agents, who would\nthen trade them in nearby mountain kingdoms or on trading expeditions\noverseas.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts008)\n\nThe practice is significant because it implies a fundamental lack of trust.\nAfter all, why not simply demand a share in the profits? This seems more fair\n(a merchant who came back bankrupt would probably have little means of paying\nanyway), and profit-sharing partnerships of this sort became common practice\nin the later Middle East.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts009)\nThe answer seems to be that profit-sharing partnerships were typically\ncontracted between merchants, or anyway people of similar background and\nexperience who had ways of keeping track of one another. Palace or temple\nbureaucrats and world-roaming merchant adventurers had little in common, and\nthe bureaucrats seem to have concluded that one could not normally expect a\nmerchant returned from a far-off land to be entirely honest about his\nadventures. A fixed interest rate would render irrelevant whatever elaborate\ntales of robbery, shipwreck, or attacks by winged snakes or elephants a\ncreative merchant might have concocted. The return was fixed in advance.\n\nThis connection between borrowing and lying, incidentally, is an important one\nto history. Herodotus remarked about the Persians: “To tell a lie is\nconsidered by them the greatest disgrace, and next to that to be in debt …\nespecially because they think that one in debt must of necessity tell\nlies.”[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts010) (Later, Herodotus\nreported a story told to him by a Persian about the origins of the gold that\nthe Persians had acquired in India: they stole it from the nests of giant\nants.)[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts011) Jesus’s parable of\nthe unforgiving servant makes a joke out of the matter (“Ten thousand talents?\nNo problem. Just give me a little more time”), but even here, one can see how\nsuch endless falsehoods contributed to a broader sense that a world in which\nmoral relations are conceived as debts is also, while in certain ways\nentertaining, necessarily a world of corruption, guilt, and sin.\n\nBy the time of the earliest Sumerian documents, this world may not yet have\narrived. Still, the principle of lending at interest, even compound interest,\nwas already familiar to everyone. In 2402 bc, for instance, a royal\ninscription by King Enmetena of Lagash—one of the earliest we have—complains\nthat his enemy, the King of Umma, had been occupying a huge stretch of\nfarmland that had rightfully belonged to Lagash for decades. He announces: if\none were to calculate the rental fees for all that land, then the interest\nthat would have been due on that rent, compounded annually, it would reveal\nthat Umma now owes Lagash four and a half trillion liters of barley. The sum\nwas, as in the parable, intentionally\npreposterous.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts012) It was just\nan excuse to start a war. Still, he wanted everyone to know that he knew\nexactly how to do the math.\n\nUsury—in the sense of interest-bearing consumer loans—was also well\nestablished by Enmetena’s time. The king ultimately had his war and won it,\nand two years later, fresh off his victory, he was forced to publish another\nedict: this one, a general debt cancellation within his kingdom. As he later\nboasted, “he instituted freedom _(amargi)_ in Lagash. He restored the child to\nits mother, and the mother to her child; he cancelled all interest\ndue.”[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts013) This was, in fact,\nthe very first such declaration we have on record—and the first time in\nhistory that the word “freedom” appears in a political document.\n\nEnmetena’s text is a bit vague on the details, but a half-century later, when\nhis successor Uruinimgina declared a general amnesty during the New Year’s\nceremonies of 2350 bc, the terms are all spelled out, and they conform to what\nwas to become typical of such amnesties: cancelling not only all outstanding\nloans, but all forms of debt servitude, even those based on failure to pay\nfees or criminal penalties—the only thing excepted being commercial loans.\n\nSimilar declarations are to be found again and again, in Sumerian and later\nBabylonian and Assyrian records, and always with the same theme: the\nrestoration of “justice and equity,” the protection of widows and orphans, to\nensure—as Hammurabi was to put it when he abolished debts in Babylon in 1761\nbc—“that the strong might not oppress the\nweak.”[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts014) In the words of\nMichael Hudson,\n\nThe designated occasion for clearing Babylonia’s financial slate was the New\nYear festival, celebrated in the spring. Babylonian rulers oversaw the ritual\nof “breaking the tablets,” that is, the debt records, restoring economic\nbalance as part of the calendrical renewal of society along with the rest of\nnature. Hammurabi and his fellow rulers signaled these proclamations by\nraising a torch, probably symbolizing the sun-god of justice Shamash, whose\nprinciples were supposed to guide wise and fair rulers. Persons held as debt\npledges were released to rejoin their families. Other debtors were restored\ncultivation rights to their customary lands, free of whatever mortgage liens\nhad accumulated.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts015)\n\nOver the next several thousand years, this same list—cancelling the debts,\ndestroying the records, reallocating the land—was to become the standard list\nof demands of peasant revolutionaries everywhere. In Mesopotamia, rulers\nappear to have headed off the possibility of unrest by instituting such\nreforms themselves, as a grand gesture of cosmic renewal, a recreation of the\nsocial universe—in Babylonia, during the same ceremony in which the king\nreenacts his god Marduk’s creation of the physical universe. The history of\ndebt and sin was wiped out, and it was time to begin again. But it’s also\nclear what they saw as the alternative: the world plunged into chaos, with\nfarmers defecting to swell the ranks of nomadic pastoralists, and ultimately,\nif the breakdown continued, returning to overrun the cities and destroy the\nexisting economic order entirely.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\n## Egypt  \n(2650–716 BC)\n\nEgypt represents an interesting contrast, since for most of its history, it\nmanaged to avoid the development of interest-bearing debt entirely.\n\nEgypt was, like Mesopotamia, extraordinarily rich by ancient standards, but it\nwas also a self-contained society, a river running through a desert, and far\nmore centralized than Mesopotamia. The pharaoh was a god, and the state and\ntemple bureaucracies had their hands in everything: there were a dazzling\narray of taxes and a continual distribution of allotments, wages, and payments\nfrom the state. Here, too, money clearly arose as a means of account. The\nbasic unit was the _deben_ , or “measure”—originally referring to measures of\ngrain, and later of copper or silver. A few records make clear the catch-as-\ncatch-can nature of most transactions:\n\nIn the 15th year of Ramses II [c. 1275 BC] a merchant offered the Egyptian\nlady Erenofre a Syrian slave girl whose price, no doubt after bargaining, was\nfixed at 4 _deben_ 1 _kite_ [about 373 grams] of silver. Erenofre made up a\ncollection of clothes and blankets to the value of 2 _deben_ 2 1/3 _kite_ —the\ndetails are set out in the record—and then borrowed a miscellany of objects\nfrom her neighbors—bronze vessels, a pot of honey, ten shirts, ten _deben_ of\ncopper ingots—till the price was made\nup.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts016)\n\nMost merchants were itinerant, either foreigners or commercial agents for the\nowners of large estates. There’s not much evidence for commercial credit,\nhowever; loans in Egypt were still more likely to take the form of mutual aid\nbetween neighbors.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts017)\n\nSubstantial, legally enforceable loans, the kind that can lead to the loss of\nlands or family members, are documented, but they appear to have been rare—and\nmuch less pernicious, as the loans did not bear interest. Similarly, we do\noccasionally hear of debt-bondservants, and even debt slaves, but these seem\nto have been unusual phenomena and there’s no suggestion that matters ever\nreached crisis proportions, as they so regularly did in Mesopotamia and the\nLevant.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts018)\n\nIn fact, for the first several thousand years, we seem to be in a somewhat\ndifferent world, where debt really was a matter of “guilt” and treated largely\nas a criminal matter:\n\nWhen a debtor failed to repay his debt on time, his creditor could take him to\ncourt, where the debtor would be required to promise to pay in full by a\nspecific date. As part of his promise—which was under oath—the debtor also\npledged to undergo 100 blows and/or repay twice the amount of the original\nloan if he failed to pay by the date\nspecified.[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts019)\n\nThe “and/or” is significant. There was no formal distinction between a fine\nand a beating. In fact, the entire purpose of the oath (rather like the Cretan\ncustom of having a borrower pretend to snatch the money) seems to have been to\ncreate the justification for punitive action: so the debtor could be punished\nas _either_ a perjurer or a\nthief.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts020)\n\nBy the time of the New Kingdom (1550–1070) there is more evidence for markets,\nbut it’s only by the time we reach the Iron Age, just before Egypt was\nabsorbed into the Persian empire, that we begin to see evidence for\nMesopotamian-style debt crises. Greek sources, for instance, record that the\nPharaoh Bakenranef (reigned 720–715 bc) issued a decree abolishing debt\nbondage and annulling all outstanding liabilities, since “he felt it would be\nabsurd for a soldier, perhaps at the moment when he was setting forth to fight\nfor his fatherland, to be hauled off to prison by his creditor for an unpaid\nloan”—which, if true, is also one of the earliest mentions of a debt\nprison.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts021) Under the\nPtolemies, the Greek dynasty that ruled Egypt after Alexander, periodic clean\nslates had become institutionized. It’s well known that the Rosetta Stone,\nwritten both in Greek and Egyptian, proved to be the key that made it possible\nto translate Egyptian hieroglyphics. Few are aware of what it actually says.\nThe stela was originally raised to announce an amnesty, both for debtors and\nfor prisoners, declared by Ptolemy V in 196\nbc.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts022)\n\n## China  \n(2200–771 BC)\n\nWe can say almost nothing about Bronze Age India, since its writing remains\nindecipherable, and not much more about Early China. What little we do\nknow—mainly culled from dribs and drabs in later literary sources—suggests\nthat the earliest Chinese states were far less bureaucratic than their western\ncousins.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts023) There being no\ncentralized temple or palace system with priests and administrators managing\nthe storerooms and recording inputs and outputs, there was also little\nincentive to create a single, uniform unit of account. Instead, the evidence\nsuggests a different path, with social currencies of various sorts still\nholding sway in the countryside and being converted to commercial purposes in\ndealings between strangers.\n\nLater sources recall that early rulers “used pearls and jade as their superior\nmethod of payment, gold as their middle method of payment, and knives and\nspades as their lower method of\npayment.”[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts024) The author can\nonly be talking about gifts here, and hierarchical ones at that: kings and\ngreat magnates rewarding their followers for services in theory rendered\nvoluntarily. In most places, long strings of cowrie shells figure prominently,\nbut even here, though we often hear of “the cowrie money of early China,” and\nit’s easy enough to find texts in which the value of sumptuous gifts are\n_measured_ in cowries, it’s never clear whether people were really carrying\nthem around to buy and sell things in the\nmarketplace.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts025)\n\nThe most likely interpretation is that they were carrying the shells, but for\na long time marketplaces themselves were of minor significance, so this use\nwas not nearly as important as the usual uses for social currencies: marriage\npresents, fines, fees, and tokens of\nhonor.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts026) At any rate, all\nsources insist that there was a wide variety of currencies in circulation. As\nDavid Scheidel, one of the premier contemporary scholars of early money,\nnotes:\n\nIn pre-imperial China, money took the form of cowrie shells, both originals\nand—increasingly—bronze imitations, tortoise shells, weighed gold and (rarely)\nsilver bars, and most notably—from at least 1000 BC onward—utensil money in\nthe shape of spade blades and knives made of\nbronze.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts027)\n\nThese were most often used between people who didn’t know each other very\nwell. For tabulating debts between neighbors, with local vendors, or with\nanything having to do with the government, people appear to have employed a\nvariety of credit instruments: later Chinese historians claimed that the\nearliest of these were knotted strings, rather like the Inca _khipu_ system,\nand then later, notched strips of wood or\nbamboo.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts028) As in Mesopotamia,\nthese appear to have long predated writing.\n\nWe don’t really know when the practice of lending at interest first reached\nChina either, or whether Bronze Age China came to see the same sorts of debt\ncrises as occurred in Mesopotamia, but there are tantalizing hints in later\ndocuments.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts029) For instance,\nlater Chinese legends about the origin of coinage ascribed the invention to\nemperors trying to relieve the effects of natural disasters. One early Han\ntext reports:\n\nIn ancient times, during the floods of Yu and the droughts of Tang, the common\npeople became so exhausted that they were forced to borrow from one another in\norder to obtain food and clothing. [Emperor] Yu coined money for his people\nfrom the gold of Mount Li and [Emperor] Tang did likewise from the copper of\nMount Yan. Therefore the world called them\nbenevolent.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts030)\n\nOther versions are a little more explicit. The _Guanzi_ , a collection that in\nearly imperial China became the standard primer on political economy, notes\n“There were people who lacked even gruel to eat, and who were forced to sell\ntheir children. To rescue these people, Tang coined\nmoney.”[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts031)\n\nThe story is clearly fanciful (the real origins of coined money were at least\na thousand years later), and it is very hard to know what to make of it. Could\nthis reflect a memory of children being taken away as debt sureties? On the\nface of it, it seems more like starving people selling their children\noutright—a practice that was later to become commonplace in certain periods of\nChinese history.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-nts032) But the\njuxtaposition of loans and the sale of children is suggestive, especially\nconsidering what was happening on the other side of Asia at exactly the same\ntime. The _Guanzi_ later goes on to explain that these same rulers instituted\nthe custom of retaining 30 percent of the harvest in public granaries for\nredistribution in emergencies, so as to ensure that this would never happen\nagain. In other words, they began to set up just the kind of bureaucratic\nstorage facilities that, in places like Egypt and Mesopotamia, had been\nresponsible for creating money as a unit of account to begin with.\n\n\n# Chapter Nine  \n  \nTHE AXIAL AGE\n\n# _(800 BC – 600 AD)_\n\n_Let us designate this period as the “axial age.” Extraordinary events are\ncrowded into this period. In China lived Confucius and Lao Tse, all the trends\nin Chinese philosophy arose … In India it was the age of the Upanishads and of\nBuddha; as in China, all philosophical trends, including skepticism and\nmaterialism, sophistry and nihilism, were developed_.\n\n—Karl Jaspers, _Way to Wisdom_\n\nTHE PHRASE “THE AXIAL AGE” was coined by the German existentialist philosopher\nKarl Jaspers.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts001) In the course\nof writing a history of philosophy, Jaspers became fascinated by the fact that\nfigures like Pythagoras (570–495 bc), the Buddha (563–483 bc), and Confucius\n(551–479 bc), were all alive at exactly the same time, and that Greece, India,\nand China, in that period, all saw a sudden efflorescence of debate between\ncontending intellectual schools, each group apparently, unaware of the others’\nexistence. Like the simultaneous invention of coinage, why this happened had\nalways been a puzzle. Jaspers wasn’t entirely sure himself. To some extent, he\nsuggested, it must have been an effect of similar historical conditions. For\nmost of the great urban civilizations of the time, the early Iron Age was a\nkind of pause between empires, a time when political landscapes were broken\ninto a checkerboard of often diminutive kingdoms and city-states, most often\nat constant war externally and locked in constant political debate within.\nEach case witnessed the development of something akin to a drop-out culture,\nwith ascetics and sages fleeing to the wilderness or wandering from town to\ntown seeking wisdom; in each, too, they were eventually reabsorbed into the\npolitical order as a new kind of intellectual or spiritual elite, whether as\nGreek sophists, Jewish prophets, Chinese sages, or Indian holy men.\n\nWhatever the reasons, the result, Jaspers argued, was the first period in\nhistory in which human beings applied principles of reasoned inquiry to the\ngreat questions of human existence. He observed that all these great regions\nof the world, China, India, and the Mediterranean, saw the emergence of\nremarkably parallel philosophical trends, from skepticism to idealism—in fact,\nalmost the entire range of positions about the nature of the cosmos, mind,\naction, and the ends of human existence that have remained the stuff of\nphilosophy to this day. As one of Jaspers’ disciples later put it—overstating\nonly slightly—“no really new ideas have been added since that\ntime.”[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts002)\n\nFor Jaspers, the period begins with the Persian prophet Zoroaster, around 800\nbc, and ends around 200 bc, to be followed by a Spiritual Age that centers on\nfigures like Jesus and Mohammed. For my own purposes, I find it more useful to\ncombine the two. Let us define the Axial Age, then, as running from 800 bc to\n600 ad.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts003) This makes the\nAxial Age the period that saw the birth not only of all the world’s major\nphilosophical tendencies, but also, all of today’s major world religions:\nZoroastrianism, Prophetic Judaism, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Confucianism,\nTaoism, Christianity, and\nIslam.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts004)\n\nThe attentive reader may have noticed that the core period of Jasper’s Axial\nage—the lifetimes of Pythagoras, Confucius, and the Buddha—corresponds almost\nexactly to the period in which coinage was invented. What’s more, the three\nparts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of\nthe world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of\nAxial Age religious and philosophical creativity: the kingdoms and city-states\naround the Yellow River in China, the Ganges valley in northern India, and the\nshores of the Aegean Sea.\n\nWhat was the connection? We might start by asking: What is a coin? The normal\ndefinition is that a coin is a piece of valuable metal, shaped into a\nstandardized unit, with some emblem or mark inscribed to authenticate it. The\nworld’s first coins appear to have been created within the kingdom of Lydia,\nin western Anatolia (now Turkey), sometime around 600\nbc.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts005) These first Lydian\ncoins were basically just round lumps of electrum—a gold-silver alloy that\noccurred naturally in the nearby Pactolus River—that had been heated, then\nhammered with some kind of insignia. The very first, stamped only with a few\nletters, appear to have been manufactured by ordinary jewelers, but these\ndisappeared almost instantly, replaced by coins manufactured in a newly\nestablished royal mint. Greek cities on the Anatolian coast soon began to\nstrike their own coins, and they came to be adopted in Greece itself; the same\nthing occurred in the Persian Empire after it absorbed Lydia in 547 bc.\n\nIn both India and China, we can observe the same pattern: invented by private\ncitizens, coinage was quickly monopolized by the state. The first Indian\nmoney, which seems to have appeared at some point in the sixth century,\nconsisted of bars of silver trimmed down to uniform weights, then punch-marked\nwith some kind of official\nsymbol.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts006) Most of the\nexamples discovered by archaeologists contain numerous additional counter-\npunches, presumably added much in the way that a check or other credit\ninstrument is endorsed before being transferred. This strongly suggests that\nthey were being handled by people used to dealing with more abstract credit\ninstruments.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts007) Much early\nChinese coinage also shows signs of having evolved directly from social\ncurrencies: some were in fact cast bronze in the shape of cowries, though\nothers took the shape of diminutive knives, disks, or spades. In every case,\nlocal governments quickly stepped in—presumably within the space of about a\ngeneration.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts008) However, since\nin each of the three areas there was a plethora of tiny states, this meant\nthat each ended up with a wide variety of different currency systems. For\nexample, around 700 bc, northern India was still divided into Janapadas or\n“tribal territories,” some of them monarchies and some republics, and in the\nsixth century there were still at least sixteen major kingdoms. In China, this\nwas the period where the old Zhou Empire first devolved into vying\nprincipalities (the “Spring and Autumn” period, 722–481 bc), then splintered\ninto the chaos of the “Warring States” (475–221 bc.) Like the Greek city-\nstates, all of the resulting kingdoms, no matter how diminutive, aspired to\nissue their own official currency.\n\nRecent scholarship has shed a great deal of light on how this must have\nhappened. Gold, silver, and bronze—the materials from which coins were\nmade—had long been the media of international trade; but until that time, only\nthe rich had actually had much in their possession. A typical Sumerian farmer\nmay well have never had occasion to hold a substantial piece of silver in his\nhand, except perhaps at his wedding. Most precious metals took the form of\nwealthy women’s anklets and heirloom chalices presented by kings to their\nretainers, or it was simply stockpiled in temples, in ingot form, as sureties\nfor loans. Somehow, during the Axial Age, all this began to change. Large\namounts of silver, gold, and copper were dethesaurized, as the economic\nhistorians like to say; it was removed from the temples and houses of the rich\nand placed in the hands of ordinary people, was broken into tinier pieces, and\nbegan to be used in everyday transactions.\n\nHow? Israeli Classicist David Schaps provides the most plausible suggestion:\nmost of it was stolen. This was a period of generalized warfare, and it is in\nthe nature of war that precious things are plundered.\n\nSoldiers who plunder may indeed go first for the women, the alcoholic drinks,\nor the food, but they will also be looking around for things of value that are\neasily portable. A long-term standing army will tend to accumulate many things\nthat are valuable and portable—and the most valuable and portable items are\nprecious metals and precious stones. It may well have been the protracted wars\namong the states of these areas that first produced a large population of\npeople with precious metal in their possession and a need for everyday\nnecessities …\n\nWhere there are people who want to buy there will be people willing to sell,\nas innumerable tracts on black markets, drug dealing, and prostitution point\nout … The constant warfare of the archaic age of Greece, of the Janapadas of\nIndia, of the Warring States of China, was a powerful impetus for the\ndevelopment of market trade, and in particular for market trade based on the\nexchange of precious metal, usually in small amounts. If plunder brought\nprecious metal into the hands of the soldiers, the market will have spread it\nthrough the population.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts009)\n\nNow, one might object: but surely, war and plunder were nothing new. The\nHomeric epics, for instance, show a well-nigh obsessive interest in the\ndivision of the spoils. True, but what the Axial Age also saw—again, equally\nin China, India, and the Aegean—was the rise of a new kind of army, made up\nnot of aristocratic warriors and their retainers, but trained professionals.\nThe period when the Greeks began to use coinage, for instance, was also the\nperiod when they developed their famous phalanx tactics, which required\nconstant drill and training of the hoplite soldiers. The results were so\nextraordinarily effective that Greek mercenaries were soon being sought after\nfrom Egypt to Crimea. But unlike the Homeric retainers, who could simply be\nignored, an army of trained mercenaries needs to be rewarded in some\nmeaningful way. One could perhaps provide them all with livestock, but\nlivestock are hard to transport; or with promissory notes, but these would be\nworthless in the mercenaries’ own country. Allowing each a tiny share of the\nplunder does seem an obvious solution.\n\nThese new armies were, directly or indirectly, under the control of\ngovernments, and it took governments to turn these chunks of metal into\ngenuine currency. The main reason for this is simply scale: to create enough\ncoins that the people could begin to use them in everyday transactions\nrequired mass production on a scale far beyond the abilities of local\nmerchants or smiths.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts010) Of\ncourse we have already seen why governments might have incentive to do so: the\nexistence of markets was highly convenient for governments, and not just\nbecause it made it so much easier for them to provision large standing armies.\nBy insisting that only their own coins were acceptable as fees, fines, or\ntaxes, governments were able to overwhelm the innumerable social currencies\nthat already existed in their hinterlands, and to establish something like\nuniform national markets.\n\nActually, one theory is that the very first Lydian coins were invented\nexplicitly to pay\nmercenaries.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts011) This might\nhelp explain why the Greeks, who supplied most of the mercenaries, so quickly\nbecame accustomed to the use of coins, and why the use of coinage spread so\nquickly across the Hellenic world, so that by 480 bc there were at least one\nhundred mints operating in different Greek cities, even though at that time,\nnone of the great trading nations of the Mediterranean had as yet showed the\nslightest interest in them. The Phoenicians, for example, were considered the\ngreatest merchants and bankers of\nantiquity.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts012) They were also\ngreat inventors, having been the first to develop both the alphabet and the\nabacus. Yet for centuries after the invention of coinage, they preferred to\ncontinue conducting business as they always had, with unwrought ingots and\npromissory notes.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts013)\nPhoenician cities struck no coins until 365 bc, and while Carthage, the great\nPhoenician colony in North Africa that came to dominate commerce in the\nWestern Mediterranean, did so a bit earlier, it was only when “forced to do so\nto pay Sicilian mercenaries; and its issues were marked in Punic, ‘for the\npeople of the camp.’ ”[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts014)\n\nOn the other hand, in the extraordinary violence of the Axial Age, being a\n“great trading nation” (rather than, say, an aggressive military power like\nPersia, Athens, or Rome) was not, ultimately, a winning proposition. The fate\nof the Phoenician cities is instructive. Sidon, the wealthiest, was destroyed\nby the Persian emperor Artaxerxes III after a revolt in 351 bc. Forty thousand\nof its inhabitants are said to have committed mass suicide rather than\nsurrender. Nineteen years later, Tyre was destroyed after a prolonged siege by\nAlexander: ten thousand died in battle, and the thirty thousand survivors were\nsold into slavery. Carthage lasted longer, but when Roman armies finally\ndestroyed the city in 146 bc, hundreds of thousands of Carthaginians were said\nto have been raped and slaughtered, and fifty thousand captives put on the\nauction block, after which the city itself was razed and its fields sowed with\nsalt.\n\nAll this may bring home something of the level of violence amidst which Axial\nAge thought developed.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts015) But\nit also leaves us asking: What exactly was the ongoing relation among coinage,\nmilitary power, and this unprecedented outpouring of ideas?\n\n## The Mediterranean\n\nHere again our best information is from the Mediterranean world, and I have\nalready provided some of its outlines. Comparing Athens—with its far-flung\nnaval empire—and Rome, we can immediately detect striking similarities. In\neach city, history begins with a series of debt crises. In Athens, the first\ncrisis, the one that culminated in Solon’s reforms of 594 bc, was so early\nthat coinage could hardly have been a factor. In Rome, too, the earliest\ncrises seem to have proceeded the advent of currency. Rather, in each case,\ncoinage became a solution. In brief, one might say that these conflicts over\ndebt had two possible outcomes. The first was that the aristocrats could win,\nand the poor remain “slaves of the rich”—which in practice meant that most\npeople would end up clients of some wealthy patron. Such states were generally\nmilitarily ineffective.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts016)\nThe second was that popular factions could prevail, institute the usual\npopular program of redistribution of lands and safeguards against debt\npeonage, thus creating the basis for a class of free farmers whose children\nwould, in turn, be free to spend much of their time training for\nwar.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts017)\n\nCoinage played a critical role in maintaining this kind of free\npeasantry—secure in their landholding, not tied to any great lord by bonds of\ndebt. In fact, the fiscal policies of many Greek cities amounted to little\nmore than elaborate systems for the distribution of loot. It’s important to\nemphasize that few ancient cities, if any, went so far as to outlaw predatory\nlending, or even debt peonage, entirely. Instead, they threw money at the\nproblem. Gold, and especially silver, were acquired in war, or mined by slaves\ncaptured in war. Mints were located in temples (the traditional place for\ndepositing spoils), and city-states developed endless ways to distribute\ncoins, not only to soldiers, sailors, and those producing arms or outfitting\nships, but to the populace generally, as jury fees, fees for attending public\nassemblies, or sometimes just as outright distributions, as Athens did most\nfamously when they discovered a new vein of silver in the mines at Laurium in\n483 bc. At the same time, insisting that the same coins served as legal tender\nfor all payments due to the state guaranteed that they would be in sufficient\ndemand that markets would soon develop.\n\nMany of the political crises in ancient Greek cities similarly turned on the\ndistribution of the spoils. Here is another incident recorded in Aristotle,\nwho provides a conservative take on the origins of a coup in the city of\nRhodes around 391 bc (“demagogues” here refers to the leaders of the\ndemocracy):\n\nThe demagogues needed money to pay the people for attending the assembly and\nserving on juries; for if the people did not attend, the demagogues would lose\ntheir influence. They raised at least some of the money they needed by\npreventing the disbursement of the money due the trireme [warship] commanders\nunder their contracts with the city to build and fit triremes for the Rhodian\nnavy. Since the trireme commanders were not paid, they were unable in turn to\npay their suppliers and workers, who sued the trireme commanders. To escape\nthese lawsuits the trireme commanders banded together and overthrew the\ndemocracy.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts018)\n\nIt was slavery, though, that made all this possible. As the figures concerning\nSidon, Tyre, and Carthage suggest, enormous numbers of people were being\nenslaved in many of these conflicts, and, of course, many slaves ended up\nworking in the mines, producing even more gold, silver, and copper. (The mines\nin Laurium reportedly employed ten to twenty thousand of\nthem.)[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts019)\n\nGeoffrey Ingham calls the resulting system a “military-coinage complex”—though\nI think it would be more accurate to call it a “military-coinage-slavery\ncomplex.”[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts020) Anyway, that\ndescribes rather nicely how it worked in practice. When Alexander set out to\nconquer the Persian Empire, he borrowed much of the money with which to pay\nand provision his troops, and he minted his first coins, used to pay his\ncreditors and continue to support the money, by melting down gold and silver\nplundered after his initial\nvictories.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts021) However, an\nexpeditionary force needed to be paid, and paid well: Alexander’s army, which\nnumbered some 120,000 men, required half a ton of silver a day just for wages.\nFor this reason, conquest meant that the existing Persian system of mines and\nmints had to be reorganized around providing for the invading army; and\nancient mines, of course, were worked by slaves. In turn, most slaves in mines\nwere war captives. Presumably most of the unfortunate survivors of the siege\nof Tyre ended up working in such mines. One can see how this process might\nfeed upon itself.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts022)\n\nAlexander was also the man responsible for destroying what remained of the\nancient credit systems, since not only the Phoenicians but also the old\nMesopotamian heartland had resisted the new coin economy. His armies not only\ndestroyed Tyre; they also dethesaurized the gold and silver reserves of\nBabylonian and Persian temples, the security on which their credit systems\nwere based, and insisted that all taxes to his new government be paid in his\nown money. The result was to “release the accumulated specie of century onto\nthe market in a matter of months,” something like 180,000 talents, or in\ncontemporary terms, an estimated $285\nbillion.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts023)\n\nThe Hellenistic successor kingdoms established by Alexander’s generals, from\nGreece to India, employed mercenaries rather than national armies, but the\nstory of Rome is, again, similar to that of Athens. Its early history, as\nrecorded by official chroniclers like Livy, is one of continual struggles\nbetween patricians and plebians, and of continual crises over debt.\nPeriodically, these would lead to what were called moments of “the secession\nof the plebs,” when the commoners of the city abandoned their fields and\nworkshops, camped outside the city, and threatened mass defection—an\ninteresting halfway point between the popular revolts of Greece and the\nstrategy of exodus typically pursued in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Here, too, the\npatricians were ultimately faced with a decision: they could use agricultural\nloans to gradually turn the plebian population into a class of bonded laborers\non their estates, or they could accede to popular demands for debt protection,\npreserve a free peasantry, and employ the younger sons of free farm families\nas soldiers.[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts024) As the\nprolonged history of crises, secessions, and reforms makes clear, the choice\nwas made grudgingly.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts025) The\nplebs practically had to force the senatorial class to take the imperial\noption. Still, they did, and over time they gradually presided over the\nestablishment of a welfare system that recycled at least a share of the spoils\nto soldiers, veterans, and their families.\n\nIt seems significant, in this light, that the traditional date of the first\nRoman coinage—338 bc—is almost exactly the date when debt bondage was finally\noutlawed (326 bc).[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts026) Again,\ncoinage, minted from war spoils, didn’t cause the crisis. It was used as a\nsolution.\n\nIn fact, the entire Roman empire, at its height, could be understood as a vast\nmachine for the extraction of precious metals and their coining and\ndistribution to the military—combined with taxation policies designed to\nencourage conquered populations to adopt coins in their everyday transactions.\nEven so, for most of its history, use of coins was heavily concentrated in two\nregions: in Italy and a few major cities, and on the frontiers, where the\nlegions were actually stationed. In areas where there were neither mines nor\nmilitary operations, older credit systems presumably continued to operate.\n\nI will add one final note here. In Greece as in Rome, attempts to solve the\ndebt crisis through military expansion were always, ultimately, just ways of\nfending off the problem—and they only worked for a limited period of time.\nWhen expansion stopped, everything returned to as it had been before.\nActually, it’s not clear that all forms of debt bondage were ever entirely\neliminated even in cities like Athens and Rome. In cities that were not\nsuccessful military powers, without any source of income to set up welfare\npolicies, debt crises continued to flare up every century or so—and they often\nbecame far more acute than they ever had in the Middle East, because there was\nno mechanism, short of outright revolution, to declare a Mesopotamian-style\nclean slate. Large populations, even in the Greek world, did, in fact, sink to\nthe rank of serfs and\nclients.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts027)\n\nAthenians, as we’ve seen, seemed to assume that a gentleman normally lived a\nstep or two ahead of his creditors. Roman politicians were little different.\nOf course much of the debt was money that members of the senatorial class owed\nto each other: in a way, it’s just the usual communism of the rich, extending\ncredit to one another on easy terms that they would never think to offer\nothers. Still, under the late Republic, history records many intrigues and\nconspiracies hatched by desperate debtors, often aristocrats driven by\nrelentless creditors to make common cause with the\npoor.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts028) If we hear less\nabout this sort of thing happening under the emperors, it’s probably because\nthere were fewer opportunities for protest; what evidence we have suggests\nthat if anything, the problem got much\nworse.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts029) Around 100 ad,\nPlutarch wrote about his own country as if it were under foreign invasion:\n\nAnd as King Darius sent to the city of Athens his lieutenants Datis and\nArtaphernes with chains and cords, to bind the prisoners they should take; so\nthese usurers, bringing into Greece boxes full of schedules, bills, and\nobligatory contracts, as so many irons and fetters for the shackling of poor\ncriminals …\n\nFor at the very delivery of their money, they immediately ask it back, taking\nit up at the same moment they lay it down; and they let out that again to\ninterest which they take for the use of what they have before lent.\n\nSo that they laugh at those natural philosophers who hold that nothing can be\nmade of nothing and of that which has no existence; but with them usury is\nmade and engendered of that which neither is nor ever\nwas.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts030)\n\nThe works of the early Christian fathers likewise resound with endless\ndescriptions of the misery and desperation of those caught in rich lenders’\nwebs. In the end, through this means, that small window of freedom that had\nbeen created by the plebs was completely undone, and the free peasantry\nlargely eliminated. By the end of the empire, most people in the countryside\nwho weren’t outright slaves had become, effectively, debt peons to some rich\nlandlord; a situation in the end legally formalized by imperial decrees\nbinding peasants to the\nland.[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts031) Without a free\npeasantry to form the basis for the army, the state was forced to rely more\nand more on arming and employing Germanic barbarians from across the imperial\nfrontiers—with results I need hardly relate.\n\n## India\n\nIn most ways, India could not be more different as a civilization than the\nancient Mediterranean—but to a remarkable degree, the same basic pattern\nrepeats itself there as well.\n\nThe Bronze Age civilization of the Indus Valley collapsed sometime around 1600\nbc; it would be about a thousand years before India saw the emergence of\nanother urban civilization. When it did, that civilization was centered on the\nfertile plains that surrounded the Ganges farther east. Here too we observe,\nat first, a checkerboard of different sorts of government, from the famous\n“Ksatriya republics” with a populace in arms and urban democratic assemblies,\nto elective monarchies, to centralized empires like Kosala and\nMagadha.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts032) Both Gautama (the\nfuture Buddha), and Mahavira (the founder of Jainism) were born in one of the\nrepublics, though both ultimately found themselves teaching within the great\nempires, whose rulers often became patrons of wandering ascetics and\nphilosophers.\n\nBoth kingdoms and republics produced their own silver and copper coinage, but\nin some ways the republics were more traditional, since the self-governing\n“populace in arms” consisted of the traditional Ksatriya or warrior caste, who\ntypically held their lands in common and had them worked by serfs or\nslaves.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts033) The kingdoms, on\nthe other hand, were founded on a fundamentally new institution: a trained,\nprofessional army, open to young men of a wide variety of backgrounds, their\nequipment supplied by central authorities (soldiers were obliged to check\ntheir arms and armor when they entered cities), and provided with generous\nsalaries.\n\nWhatever their origins, here too, coins and markets sprung up above all to\nfeed the machinery of war. Magadha, which ultimately came out on top, did so\nlargely because it controlled most of the mines. Kautilya’s _Arthasastra_ , a\npolitical treatise written by one of the chief ministers for the Mauryan\ndynasty that succeeded it (321–185 bc), stated the matter precisely: “The\ntreasury is based upon mining, the army upon the treasury; he who has army and\ntreasury may conquer the whole wide\nearth.”[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts034) The government\ndrew its personnel first of all from a landed class, which provided trained\nadministrators, but even more, full-time soldiers: the salaries of each rank\nof soldier and administrator were carefully stipulated. These armies could be\nhuge. Greek sources report that Magadha could put to the field a force of\n200,000 infantry, 20,000 horses, and about 4,000 elephants—and that\nAlexander’s men mutinied rather than have to face them. Whether on campaign or\nin garrison, they were inevitably accompanied by a range of different sorts of\ncamp followers—petty traders, prostitutes, and hired servants—which, with the\nsoldiers, seems to have been the very medium through which a cash economy had\noriginally taken form.[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts035) By\nKautilya’s time, a few hundred years later, the state was inserting itself\ninto every aspect of the process: Kautilya suggests paying soldiers apparently\ngenerous wages, then secretly replacing hawkers with government agents who\ncould charge them twice the normal rates for supplies, as well as organizing\nprostitutes under a ministry in which they could be trained as spies, so as to\nmake detailed reports on their clients’ loyalties.\n\nThus was the market economy, born of war, gradually taken over by the\ngovernment. Rather than stifle the spread of currency, the process seems to\nhave doubled and even tripled it: the military logic was extended to the\nentire economy, the government systematically setting up its granaries,\nworkshops, trading houses, warehouses, and jails, staffed by salaried\nofficials, and all selling products on the market so as to collect the pieces\nof silver paid off to soldiers and officials and put them back into the royal\ntreasuries again.[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts036) The\nresult was a monetarization of daily life unlike anything India was to see for\nanother two thousand\nyears.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts037)\n\nSomething similar seems to have happened with slavery, which was quite\ncommonplace at the time of the rise of the great armies—again, unlike almost\nany other point in Indian history—but was gradually brought under government\ncontrol.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts038) By Kautilya’s\ntime, most war captives were not sold in marketplaces but relocated to\ngovernment villages on newly reclaimed land. They were not allowed to leave,\nand these government villages were, at least according to the regulations,\nremarkably dreary places: veritable work camps, with all forms of festive\nentertainment officially prohibited. Slave hirelings were mostly convicts,\nrented by the state during their terms.\n\nWith their armies, spies, and administration controlling everything, the new\nIndian kings evinced little interest in the old priestly caste and its Vedic\nritual, though many kept up a lively interest in the new philosophical and\nreligious ideas that seem to have been cropping up everywhere at the time. As\ntime went on, however, the war machine began to sputter. It’s not clear\nexactly why this happened. By the time of emperor Aśoka (273–232 bc), the\nMauryan dynasty controlled almost all of present-day India and Pakistan, but\nthe Indian version of the military-coinage-slavery complex was showing\ndefinite signs of strain. Perhaps the clearest sign was the debasement of the\ncoinage, which over the course of two centuries or so had gone from almost\npure silver to about fifty percent\ncopper.[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts039)\n\nAśoka, famously, began his reign in conquest: in 265 bc, destroying the\nKalingas, one of the last remaining Indian republics, in a war in which\nhundreds of thousands of human beings were, according to his own account,\nkilled or carried off into slavery. Aśoka later claimed to have been so\ndisturbed and haunted by the carnage that he renounced war altogether,\nembraced Buddhism, and declared that from that time on, his kingdom would be\ngoverned by principles of _ahimsa_ , or nonviolence. “Here in my kingdom,” he\ndeclared in an edict inscribed on one of the great granite pillars in his\ncapital of Patna, which so dazzled the Greek ambassador Megasthenes, “no\nliving being must be killed and\nsacrificed.”[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts040) Such a\nstatement obviously can’t be taken literally: Aśoka might have replaced\nsacrificial ritual with vegetarian feasts, but he didn’t abolish the army,\nabandon capital punishment, or even outlaw slavery. But his rule marked a\nrevolutionary shift in ethos. Aggressive war was abandoned, and much of the\narmy does seems to have been demobilized, along with the network of spies and\nstate bureaucrats, with the new, proliferating mendicant orders (Buddhists,\nJains, and also world-renouncing Hindus) given official state support to\npreach to the villages on questions of social morality. Aśoka and his\nsuccessors diverted substantial resources to these religious orders, with the\nresult that, over the next centuries, thousands of stupas and monasteries were\nbuilt across the\nsubcontinent.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts041)\n\nAśoka’s reforms are useful to contemplate here because they help reveal just\nhow mistaken some of our basic assumptions are: particularly, that money\nequals coins, and that more coins in circulation means more commerce and a\ngreater role for private merchants. In reality, the Magadha state promoted\nmarkets but had been suspicious of private merchants, seeing them largely as\ncompetitors.[42](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts042) Merchants had\nbeen among the earliest and most ardent supporters of the new religions\n(Jains, owing to their rigorous enforcement of rules against harm to any\nliving creature, were obliged to become, effectively, a mercantile caste).\nMercantile interests fully supported Aśoka’s reforms. Yet the result was not\nan increase in the use of cash in everyday affairs but exactly the opposite.\n\nEarly Buddhist economic attitudes have long been considered a bit mysterious.\nOn the one hand, monks could not own property as individuals; they were\nexpected to live an austere communistic life with little more than a robe and\nbegging bowl as personal possessions, and they were strictly forbidden to so\nmuch as touch anything made of gold or silver. On the other hand, however\nsuspicious of precious metals, Buddhism had always had a liberal attitude\ntoward credit arrangements. It is one of the few of the great world religions\nthat has never formally condemned\nusury.[43](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts043) Taken in the\ncontext of the times, however, there’s nothing particularly mysterious about\nany of this. It makes perfect sense for a religious movement that rejected\nviolence and militarism, but that was in no way opposed to\ncommerce.[44](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts044) As we shall see,\nwhile Aśoka’s own empire was not long to endure, soon to be replaced by a\nsuccession of ever weaker and mostly smaller states, Buddhism took root. The\ndecline of the great armies eventually led to the near-disappearance of\ncoinage, but also to a veritable efflorescence of increasingly sophisticated\nforms of credit.\n\n## China\n\nUntil about 475 bc, northern China was still nominally an empire, but the\nemperors had devolved into figureheads and a series of de facto kingdoms had\nemerged. The period from 475 to 221 bc is referred as the “Warring States\nperiod”; at that point, even the pretense of unity was cast aside. Ultimately,\nthe country was reunited by the state of Qin, who established a dynasty that\nwas then immediately overthrown by a series of massive popular insurrections,\nushering in the Han dynasty (206 bc-220 ad), founded by a previously obscure\nrural constable and peasant leader named Liu Bao, who was the first Chinese\nleader to adopt the Confucian ideology, exam system, and pattern of civil\nadministration that were to continue for almost two thousand years.\n\nStill, the golden age of Chinese philosophy was the period of chaos that\npreceded unification, and this followed the typical Axial Age pattern: the\nsame fractured political landscape, the same rise of trained, professional\narmies and the creation of coined money largely in order to pay\nthem.[45](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts045) We also see the same\ngovernment policies designed to encourage the development of markets, chattel\nslavery on a scale not seen before or since in Chinese history, the appearance\nof itinerant philosophers and religious visionaries, battling intellectual\nschools, and eventually, attempts by political leaders to transform the new\nphilosophies into religions of\nstate.[46](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts046)\n\nThere were also significant differences, starting with the currency system.\nChina never minted gold or silver coins. Merchants used precious metals in the\nform of bullion, but the coins in actual circulation were basically small\nchange: cast bronze disks, usually with a hole in the middle so that they\ncould be strung together. Such strings of “cash” were produced in\nextraordinary numbers, and very large amounts had to be assembled for large-\nscale transactions: when wealthy men wished to make donations to temples, for\ninstance, they had to use oxcarts to carry the money. The most plausible\nexplanation is that, especially after unification, Chinese armies were\nenormous—some Warring States armies numbered up to a million—but not nearly as\nprofessional or well paid as those of kingdoms farther west, and from Qin and\nHan times on, rulers were careful to ensure that this remained the case, to\nmake sure the army never became an independent power\nbase.[47](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts047)\n\nThere was also a notable difference in that the new religious and\nphilosophical movements in China were from their very beginnings also social\nmovements. Elsewhere, they only gradually became so. In ancient Greece,\nphilosophy began with cosmological speculation; philosophers were more likely\nto be individual sages, perhaps surrounded by a few ardent disciples, as\nfounders of movements.[48](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts048)\nUnder the Roman empire, schools of philosophy like the Stoics, Epicureans,\nNeo-Platonists did become movements of a sort: at least in the sense that they\nhad thousands of educated adherents, who “practiced” philosophy not only by\nreading, writing, and debating, but even more by meditation, diet, and\nexercise. Still, philosophical movements were basically confined to the civic\nelite; it was only with the rise of Christianity and other religious movements\nthat philosophy moved beyond\nit.[49](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts049) One can observe a\nsimilar evolution in India, from individual Brahman world-renouncers, forest\nsages, and wandering mendicants with theories about the nature of the soul or\nthe composition of the material universe; to philosophical movements of the\nBuddhists, Jains, Ājīvika, and others mostly long forgotten; to, finally, mass\nreligious movements with thousands of monks, shrines, schools, and networks of\nlay supporters.\n\nIn China, while many of the founders of the “hundred schools” of philosophy\nthat blossomed under the Warring States were wandering sages who spent their\ndays moving from city to city trying to catch the ears of princes, others were\nleaders of social movements from the very start. Some of these movements\ndidn’t even have leaders, like the School of the Tillers, an anarchist\nmovement of peasant intellectuals who set out to create egalitarian\ncommunities in the cracks and fissures between\nstates.[50](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts050) The Mohists,\negalitarian rationalists whose social base seems to have been urban artisans,\nnot only were philosophically opposed to war and militarism, but organized\nbattalions of military engineers who would actively discourage conflicts by\nvolunteering to fight in any war against the side of the aggressor. Even the\nConfucians, for all the importance they attached to courtly ritual, were in\ntheir early days mainly known for their efforts in popular\neducation.[51](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts051)\n\n## Materialism I:  \nThe Pursuit of Profit\n\nWhat is one to make of all this? The popular education campaigns of the period\nperhaps provide a clue. The Axial Age was the first time in human history when\nfamiliarity with the written word was no longer limited to priests,\nadministrators, and merchants, but had become necessary to full participation\nin civic life. In Athens, it was taken for granted that only a country bumpkin\nwould be entirely illiterate.\n\nWithout mass literacy, neither the emergence of mass intellectual movements,\nnor the spread of Axial Age ideas would have been possible. By the end of the\nperiod, these ideas had produced a world where even the leaders of barbarian\narmies descending on the Roman empire felt obliged to take a position on the\nquestion of the Mystery of the Trinity, and where Chinese monks could spend\ntime debating the relative merits of the eighteen schools of Classical Indian\nBuddhism.\n\nNo doubt the growth of markets played a role too, not only helping to free\npeople from the proverbial shackles of status or community, but encouraging a\ncertain habit of rational calculation, of measuring inputs and outputs, means\nand ends, all of which must inevitably have found some echoes in the new\nspirit of rational inquiry that begins to appear in all the same times and\nplaces. Even the word “rational” is telling: it derives, of course, from\n“ratio”—how many of X go into Y—a sort of mathematical calculation previously\nused mainly by architects and engineers, but which, with the rise of markets,\neveryone who didn’t want to get cheated at the marketplace had to learn how to\ndo. Still, we must be careful here. After all, money in itself was nothing\nnew. Sumerian farmers and tradesmen were already perfectly capable of making\nsuch calculations in 3500 bc; but none, as far as we know, were so impressed\nthat they concluded, like Pythagoras, that mathematical ratios were the key to\nunderstanding the nature of the universe and the movement of celestial bodies,\nand that all things were ultimately composed of numbers—and they certainly\nhadn’t formed secret societies based on sharing this understanding, debating\nand purging and excommunicating one\nanother.[52](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts052)\n\nTo understand what had changed, we have to look, again, at the particular\n_kind_ of markets that were emerging at the beginning of the Axial Age:\nimpersonal markets, born of war, in which it was possible to treat even\nneighbors as if they were strangers.\n\nWithin human economies, motives are assumed to be complex. When a lord gives a\ngift to a retainer, there is no reason to doubt that it is inspired by a\ngenuine desire to benefit that retainer, even if it is also a strategic move\ndesigned to ensure loyalty, and an act of magnificence meant to remind\neveryone else that he is great and the retainer small. There is no sense of\ncontradiction here. Similarly, gifts between equals are usually fraught with\nmany layers of love, envy, pride, spite, communal solidarity, or any of a\ndozen other things. Speculating on such matters is a major form of daily\nentertainment. What’s missing, though, is any sense that the most selfish\n(“self-interested”) motive is necessarily the real one: those speculating on\nhidden motives are just as likely to assume that someone is secretly trying to\nhelp a friend or harm an enemy as to acquire some advantage for him- or\nherself.[53](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts053) Neither is any of\nthis likely to have changed much in the rise of early credit markets, where\nthe value of an IOU was as much dependent on assessments of its issuer’s\ncharacter as on his disposable income, and motives of love, envy, pride, etc.\ncould never be completely set aside.\n\nCash transactions between strangers were different, and all the more so when\ntrading is set against a background of war and emerges from disposing of loot\nand provisioning soldiers; when one often had best not ask where the objects\ntraded came from, and where no one is much interested in forming ongoing\npersonal relationships anyway. Here, transactions really do become simply a\nfiguring-out of how many of X will go for how many of Y, of calculating\nproportions, estimating quality, and trying to get the best deal for oneself.\nThe result, during the Axial Age, was a new way of thinking about human\nmotivation, a radical simplification of motives that made it possible to begin\nspeaking of concepts like “profit” and “advantage”—and imagining that this is\nwhat people are _really_ pursuing, in every aspect of existence, as if the\nviolence of war or the impersonality of the marketplace has simply allowed\nthem to drop the pretense that they ever cared about anything else. It was\nthis, in turn, that allowed human life to seem like it could be reduced to a\nmatter of means-to-end calculation, and hence something that could be examined\nusing the same means that one used to study the attraction and repulsion of\ncelestial bodies.[54](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts054) If the\nunderlying assumption very much resembles those of contemporary economists,\nit’s no coincidence—but with the difference that, in an age when money,\nmarkets, states, and military affairs were all intrinsically connected, money\nwas needed to pay armies to capture slaves to mine gold to produce money; when\n“cutthroat competition” often did involve the literal cutting of throats, it\nnever occurred to anyone to imagine that selfish ends could be pursued by\npeaceful means. Certainly, this picture of humanity does begin to appear, with\nstartling consistency, across Eurasia, wherever we also see coinage and\nphilosophy appear.\n\nChina provides an unusually transparent case in point. Already in Confucius’s\ntime, Chinese thinkers were speaking of the pursuit of profit as the driving\nforce in human life. The actual term used was _li_ , a word first used to\nrefer to the increase of grain one harvests from a field over and above what\none originally planted (the pictogram represents a sheaf of wheat next to a\nknife).[55](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts055) From there it came\nto mean commercial profit, and thence, a general term for “benefit” or\n“payback.” The following story, which purports to tell the reaction of a\nmerchant’s son named Lü Buwei on learning that an exiled prince was living\nnearby, illustrates the progression nicely:\n\nOn returning home, he said to his father, “What is the profit on investment\nthat one can expect from plowing fields?”\n\n“Ten times the investment,” replied his father.\n\n“And the return on investment in pearls and jades is how much?”\n\n“A hundredfold.”\n\n“And the return on investment from establishing a ruler and securing the state\nwould be how much?”\n\n“It would be\nincalculable.”[56](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts056)\n\nLü adopted the prince’s cause and eventually contrived to make him King of\nQin. He went on to became first minister for the king’s son, Qin Shi Huang,\nhelping him defeat the other Warring States to became the first Emperor of\nChina. We still have a compendium of political wisdom that Lü commissioned for\nthe new emperor, which contains such military advice as the following:\n\nAs a general principle, when an enemy’s army comes, it seeks some profit. Now\nif they come and find the prospect of death instead, they will consider\nrunning away the most profitable thing to do. When all one’s enemies consider\nrunning to be the most profitable thing to do, no blades will cross.\n\nThis is the most essential point in military\nmatters.[57](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts057)\n\nIn such a world, heroic considerations of honor and glory, vows to gods or\ndesire for vengeance, were at best weaknesses to be manipulated. In the\nnumerous manuals on statecraft produced at the time, everything was cast as a\nmatter of recognizing interest and advantage, calculating how to balance that\nwhich will profit the ruler against that which will profit the people,\ndetermining when the ruler’s interests are the same as the people’s and when\nthey contradict.[58](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts058) Technical\nterms drawn from politics, economics, and military strategy (“return on\ninvestment,” “strategic advantage”) blended and overlapped.\n\nThe predominant school of political thought under the Warring States was that\nof the Legalists, who insisted that in matters of statecraft, a ruler’s\ninterests were the only consideration, even if rulers would be unwise to admit\nthis. Still, the people could be easily manipulated, since they had the same\nmotivations: the people’s pursuit of profit, wrote Lord Shang, is utterly\npredictable, “just like the tendency of water to flow\ndownhill.”[59](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts059) Shang was\nharsher than most of his fellow Legalists in that he believed that widespread\nprosperity would ultimately harm the ruler’s ability to mobilize his people\nfor war, and therefore that terror was the most efficient instrument of\ngovernance, but even he insisted that this regime be clothed as a regime of\nlaw and justice.\n\nWherever the military-coinage-slavery complex began to take hold, we find\npolitical theorists propounding similar ideas. Kautilya was no different: the\ntitle of his book, the _Arthasastra_ , is usually translated as “manual of\nstatecraft,” since it consists of advice to rulers, but its more literal\ntranslation is “the science of material\ngain.”[60](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts060) Like the Legalists,\nKautilya emphasized the need to create a pretext that governance was a matter\nof morality and justice, but in addressing the rulers themselves, he insisted\nthat “war and peace are considered solely from the point of view of profit”—of\namassing wealth to create a more effective army, of using the army to dominate\nmarkets and control resources to amass more wealth, and so\non.[61](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts061) In Greece we’ve\nalready met Thrasymachos. True, Greece was slightly different. Greek city-\nstates did not have kings, and the collapse of private interests and affairs\nof state was in principle universally denounced as tyranny. Still, in\npractice, what this meant was that city-states, and even political factions,\nended up acting in precisely the same coldly calculating way as Indian or\nChinese sovereigns. Anyone who has ever read Thucydides’ Melian dialogue—in\nwhich Athenian generals present the population of a previously friendly city\nwith elegantly reasoned arguments for why the Athenians have determined that\nit is to the advantage of their empire to threaten them with collective\nmassacre if they are not willing to become tribute-paying subjects, and why it\nis equally in the interests of the Melians to submit—is aware of the\nresults.[62](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts062)\n\nAnother striking feature of this literature is its resolute materialism.\nGoddesses and gods, magic and oracles, sacrificial ritual, ancestral cults,\neven caste and ritual status systems all either disappear or are sidelined, no\nlonger treated as ends in themselves but as yet mere tools to be used for the\npursuit of material gain.\n\nThat intellectuals willing to produce such theories should win the ears of\nprinces is hardly surprising. Neither is it particularly surprising that other\nintellectuals should have been so offended by this sort of cynicism that they\nbegan to make common cause with the popular movements that inevitably began to\nform against those princes. But as is so often the case, oppositional\nintellectuals were faced with two choices: either adopt the reigning terms of\ndebate, or try to come up with a diametrical inversion. Mo Di, the founder of\nMohism, took the first approach. He turned the concept of li, profit, into\nsomething more like “social utility,” and then he attempted to demonstrate\nthat war itself is, by definition, an unprofitable activity. For example, he\nwrote, campaigns can only be fought in spring and autumn, and each had equally\ndeleterious effects:\n\nIf in the spring then the people miss their sowing and planting, if in the\nautumn, they miss their reaping and harvesting. Even if they miss only one\nseason, then the number of people who will die of cold and hunger is\nincalculable. Now let us calculate the army’s equipment, the arrows,\nstandards, tents, armor, shields, and sword hilts; the number of these which\nwill break and perish and not come back … So also with oxen and horses\n…[63](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts063)\n\nHis conclusion: if one could add up the total costs of aggression in human\nlives, animal lives, and material damage, one would be forced to the\nconclusion that they never outweighed the benefits—even for the victor. In\nfact, Mo Di took this sort of logic so far that he ended up arguing that the\nonly way to optimize the overall profit of humanity was to abandon the pursuit\nof private profit entirely and adopt a principle of what he called “universal\nlove”—essentially arguing that if one takes the principle of market exchange\nto its logical conclusion, it can only lead to a kind of communism.\n\nThe Confucians took the opposite approach, rejecting the initial premise. A\ngood example is most of the opening of Mencius’ much-remembered conversation\nwith King Hui:\n\n“Venerable Sir,” the King greeted him, “since you have not counted a thousand\nmiles too far to come here, may I suppose that you also have something with\nwhich you may profit my kingdom?”\n\nMencius replied:\n\n“Why must Your Majesty necessarily use this word ‘profit’? What I have are\nonly these two topics: benevolence and righteousness, and nothing\nelse.”[64](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts064)\n\nStill, the end-point was roughly the same. The Confucian ideal of ren, of\nhumane benevolence, was basically just a more complete inversion of profit-\nseeking calculation than Mo Di’s universal love; the main difference was that\nthe Confucians added a certain aversion to calculation itself, preferring what\nmight almost be called an art of decency. Taoists were later to take this even\nfurther with their embrace of intuition and spontaneity. All were so many\nattempts to provide a mirror image of market logic. Still, a mirror image is,\nultimately, just that: the same thing, only backwards. Before long we end up\nwith an endless maze of paired opposites—egoism versus altruism, profit versus\ncharity, materialism versus idealism, calculation versus spontaneity—none of\nwhich could ever have been imagined except by someone starting out from pure,\ncalculating, self-interested market\ntransactions.[65](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts065)\n\n## Materialism II:  \nSubstance\n\n_As in the near presence of death, despise poor flesh, this refuse of blood\nand bones, this web and tissue of nerves and veins and arteries_.\n\n—Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations 2.2_\n\n_Taking pity on the hungry wolf, Wenshuang announced, “I do not covet this\nfilthy bag of meat. I give it over to you that I may quickly acquire a body of\nmore enduring strength. This donation will help benefit us both.”_\n\n_—Discourse on the Pure Land 21.12_\n\nAs I’ve already observed, China was unusual because philosophy there began\nwith debates about ethics and only later turned to speculations about the\nnature of the cosmos. In both Greece and India, cosmological speculation came\nfirst. In each, too, questions about the nature of the physical universe\nquickly give way to speculation about mind, truth, consciousness, meaning,\nlanguage, illusion, world-spirits, cosmic intelligence, and the fate of the\nhuman soul.\n\nThis particular maze of mirrors is so complex and dazzling that it’s\nextraordinarily difficult to discern the starting point—that is, what,\nprecisely, is being reflected back and forth. Here anthropology can be\nhelpful, as anthropologists have the unique advantage of being able to observe\nhow human beings who have not previously been part of these conversations\nreact when first exposed to Axial Age concepts. Every now and then too, we are\npresented with moments of exceptional clarity: ones that reveal the essence of\nour own thought to be almost exactly the opposite of what we thought it to be.\n\nMaurice Leenhardt, a Catholic missionary who had spent many long years\nteaching the Gospel in New Caledonia, experienced such a moment in the 1920s,\nwhen he asked one of his students, an aged sculptor named Boesoou, how he felt\nabout having been introduced to spiritual ideas:\n\nOnce, waiting to assess the mental progress of the Canaques I had taught for\nmany years, I risked the following suggestion: “In short, we introduced the\nnotion of the spirit to your way of thinking?”\n\nHe objected, “Spirit? Bah! You didn’t bring us the spirit. We already knew the\nspirit existed. We have always acted in accord with the spirit. What you’ve\nbrought us is the body.”[66](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts066)\n\nThe notion that humans had souls appeared to Boesoou to be self-evident. The\nnotion that there was such a thing as the body, apart from the soul, a mere\nmaterial collection of nerves and tissues—let alone that the body is the\nprison of the soul; that the mortification of the body could be a means to the\nglorification or liberation of the soul—all this, it turns out, struck him as\nutterly new and exotic.\n\nAxial Age spirituality, then, is built on a bedrock of materialism. This is\nits secret; one might almost say, the thing that has become invisible to\nus.[67](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts067) But if one looks at\nthe very beginnings of philosophical inquiry in Greece and India—the point\nwhen there was as yet no difference between what we’d now call “philosophy”\nand what we’d now call “science”—this is exactly what one finds. “Theory,” if\nwe can call it that, begins with the questions: “What substance is the world\nmade of?” “What is the underlying material behind the physical forms of\nobjects in the world?” “Is everything made up of varying combinations of\ncertain basic elements (earth, air, water, fire, stone, motion, mind, number\n…), or are these basic elements just the forms taken by some even more\nelementary substance (for instance, as NyĀya and later Democritus proposed,\natomic particles …)”[68](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts068) In\njust about every case, some notion of God, Mind, Spirit, some active\norganizing principle that gave form to and was not itself substance, emerged\nas well. But this was the kind of spirit that, like Leenhardt’s God, only\nemerges in relation to inert\nmatter.[69](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts069)\n\nTo connect this impulse, too, with the invention of coinage might seem like\npushing things a bit far but, at least for the Classical world, there is an\nemerging scholarly literature—first set off by Harvard literary theorist Marc\nShell, and more recently set forth by British classicist Richard Seaford in a\nbook called _Money and the Early Greek Mind—_ that aims to do exactly\nthat.[70](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts070)\n\nIn fact, some of the historical connections are so uncannily close that they\nare very hard to explain any other way. Let me give an example. After the\nfirst coins were minted around 600 bc in the kingdom of Lydia, the practice\nquickly spread to Ionia, the Greek cities of the adjacent coast. The greatest\nof these was the great walled metropolis of Miletus, which also appears to\nhave been the first Greek city to strike its own coins. It was Ionia, too,\nthat provided the bulk of the Greek mercenaries active in the Mediterranean at\nthe time, with Miletus their effective headquarters. Miletus was also the\ncommercial center of the region, and, perhaps, the first city in the world\nwhere everyday market transactions came to be carried out primarily in coins\ninstead of credit.[71](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts071) Greek\nphilosophy, in turn, begins with three men: Thales, of Miletus (c. 624 bc–c.\n546 bc), Anaximander, of Miletus (c. 610 bc–c. 546 bc), and Anaximenes, of\nMiletus (c. 585 bc–c. 525 bc)—in other words, men who were living in that city\nat exactly the time that coinage was first\nintroduced.[72](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts072) All three are\nremembered chiefly for their speculations on the nature of the physical\nsubstance from which the world ultimately sprang. Thales proposed water,\nAnaximenes, air. Anaximander made up a new term, _apeiron_ , “the unlimited,”\na kind of pure abstract substance that could not itself be perceived but was\nthe material basis of everything that could be. In each case, the assumption\nwas that this primal substance, by being heated, cooled, combined, divided,\ncompressed, extended, or set in motion, gave rise to the endless particular\nstuffs and substances that humans actually encounter in the world, from which\nphysical objects are composed—and was also that into which all those forms\nwould eventually dissolve.\n\nIt was something that could turn into everything. As Seaford emphasizes, so\nwas money. Gold, shaped into coins, is a material substance that is also an\nabstraction. It is both a lump of metal and something more than a lump of\nmetal—it’s a drachma or an obol, a unit of currency which (at least if\ncollected in sufficient quantity, taken to the right place at the right time,\nturned over to the right person) could be exchanged for absolutely any other\nobject whatsoever.[73](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts073)\n\nFor Seaford, what was genuinely new about coins was their double-sidedness:\nthe fact that they were both valuable pieces of metal and, at the same time,\nsomething more. At least within the communities that created them, ancient\ncoins were always worth more than the gold, silver, or copper of which they\nwere composed. Seaford refers to this extra value by the inelegant term\n“fiduciarity,” which comes from the term for public trust, the confidence a\ncommunity places in its\ncurrency.[74](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts074) True, at the\nheight of Classical Greece, when there were hundreds of city-states producing\ndifferent currencies according to a number of different systems of weights and\ndenominations, merchants often did carry scales and treat coins—particularly\nforeign coins—like so many chunks of silver, just as Indian merchants seem to\nhave treated Roman coins; but within a city, that city’s currency had a\nspecial status, since it was always acceptable at face value when used to pay\ntaxes, public fees, or legal penalties. This is, incidentally, why ancient\ngovernments were so often able to introduce base metal into their coins\nwithout leading to immediate inflation; a debased coin might have lost value\nwhen traded overseas, but at home, it was still worth just as much when\npurchasing a license, or entering the public\ntheater.[75](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts075) This is also why,\nduring publc emergencies, Greek city-states would occasionally strike coins\nmade entirely of bronze or tin, which everyone would agree, while the\nemergency lasted, to treat as if they were really made of\nsilver.[76](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts076)\n\nThis is the key to Seaford’s argument about materialism and Greek philosophy.\nA coin was a piece of metal, but by giving it a particular shape, stamped with\nwords and images, the civic community agreed to make it something more. But\nthis power was not unlimited. Bronze coins could not be used forever; if one\ndebased the coinage, inflation would eventually set in. It was as if there was\na tension there, between the will of the community and the physical nature of\nthe object itself. Greek thinkers were suddenly confronted with a profoundly\nnew type of object, one of extraordinary importance—as evidenced by the fact\nthat so many men were willing to risk their lives to get their hands on it—but\nwhose nature was a profound enigma.\n\nConsider this word, “materialism.” What does it mean to adopt a “materialist”\nphilosophy? What is “material,” anyway? Normally, we speak of “materials” when\nwe refer to objects that we wish to make into something else. A tree is a\nliving thing. It only becomes “wood” when we begin to think about all the\nother things you could carve out of it. And of course you can carve a piece of\nwood into almost anything. The same is true of clay, or glass, or metal.\nThey’re solid and real and tangible, but also abstractions, because they have\nthe potential to turn into almost anything else—or, not precisely that; one\ncan’t turn a piece of wood into a lion or an owl, but one can turn it into an\nimage of a lion or an owl—it can take on almost any conceivable form. So\nalready in any materialist philosophy, we are dealing with an opposition\nbetween form and content, substance and shape; a clash between the idea, sign,\nemblem, or model in the creator’s mind, and the physical qualities of the\nmaterials on which it is to be stamped, built, or imposed, from which it will\nbe brought into reality.[77](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts077)\nWith coins this rises to an even more abstract level because that emblem can\nno longer be conceived as the model in one person’s head, but is rather the\nmark of a collective agreement. The images stamped on Greek coins (Miletus’\nlion, Athens’ owl) were typically the emblems of the city’s god, but they were\nalso a kind of collective promise, by which citizens assured one another that\nnot only would the coin be acceptable in payment of public debts, but in a\nlarger sense, that everyone would accept them, for any debts, and thus, that\nthey could be use to acquire anything anyone wanted.\n\nThe problem is that this collective power is not unlimited. It only really\napplies within the city. The farther you go outside, into places dominated by\nviolence, slavery, and war—the sort of place where even philosophers taking a\ncruise might end up on the auction block—the more it turns into a mere lump of\nprecious metal.[78](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts078)\n\nThe war between Spirit and Flesh, then, between the noble Idea and ugly\nReality, the rational intellect versus stubborn corporeal drives and desires\nthat resist it, even the idea that peace and community are not things that\nemerge spontaneously but that need to be stamped onto our baser material\nnatures like a divine insignia stamped into base metal—all those ideas that\ncame to haunt the religious and philosophical traditions of the Axial Age, and\nthat have continued to surprise people like Boesoou ever since—can already be\nseen as inscribed in the nature of this new form of money.\n\nIt would be foolish to argue that all Axial Age philosophy was simply a\nmeditation on the nature of coinage, but I think Seaford is right to argue\nthat this is a critical starting place: one of the reasons that the pre-\nSocratic philosophers began to frame their questions in the peculiar way they\ndid, asking (for instance): What are Ideas? Are they merely collective\nconventions? Do they exist, as Plato insisted, in some divine domain beyond\nmaterial existence? Or do they exist in our minds? Or do our minds themselves\nultimately partake of that divine immaterial domain? And if they do, what does\nthis say about our relation to our bodies?\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIn India and China, the debate took different forms, but materialism was\nalways the starting point. We only know the ideas of most truly materialist\nthinkers from the works of their intellectual enemies: as is the case with the\nIndian king PĀyĀsi, who enjoyed debating Buddhist and Jain philosophers,\ntaking the position that the soul does not exist, that human bodies are\nnothing but particular configurations of air, water, earth, and fire, their\nconsciousness the result of the elements’ mutual interaction, and that when we\ndie, the elements simply\ndissolve.[79](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts079) Clearly, though,\nsuch ideas were commonplace. Even the Axial Age religions are often\nstartlingly lacking in the plethora of supernatural forces seen before and\nafter: as witnessed by continued debates over whether Buddhism even _is_ a\nreligion, since it rejects any notion of a supreme being, or whether\nConfucius’ admonitions that one should continue to venerate one’s ancestors\nwas merely a way of encouraging filial piety, or based on a belief that dead\nancestors did, in some sense, continue to exist. The fact that we have to ask\nsays everything. Yet at the same time, what endures, above all, from that\nage—in institutional terms—are what we call the “world religions.”\n\nWhat we see then is a strange kind of back-and-forth, attack and riposte,\nwhereby the market, the state, war, and religion all continually separate and\nmerge with one another. Let me summarize it as briefly as I can:\n\n1) Markets appear to have first emerged, in the Near East at least, as a side\neffect of government administrative systems. Over time, however, the logic of\nthe market became entangled in military affairs, where it became almost\nindistinguishable from the mercenary logic of Axial Age warfare, and then,\nfinally, that logic came to conquer government itself; to define its very\npurpose.\n\n2) As a result: everywhere we see the military-coinage-slavery complex emerge,\nwe also see the birth of materialist philosophies. They are materialist, in\nfact, in both senses of the term: in that they envision a world made up of\nmaterial forces, rather than divine powers, and in that they imagine the\nultimate end of human existence to be the accumulation of material wealth,\nwith ideals like morality and justice being reframed as tools designed to\nsatisfy the masses.\n\n3) Everywhere, too, we find philosophers who react to this by exploring ideas\nof humanity and the soul, attempting to find a new foundation for ethics and\nmorality.\n\n4) Everywhere some of these philosophers made common cause with social\nmovements that inevitably formed in the face of these new and extraordinarily\nviolent and cynical elites. The result was something new to human history:\npopular movements that were also intellectual movements, due to the assumption\nthat those opposing existing power arrangements did so in the name of some\nkind of theory about the nature of reality.\n\n5) Everywhere, these movements were first and foremost peace movements, in\nthat they rejected the new conception of violence, and especially aggressive\nwar, as the foundation of politics.\n\n6) Everywhere too, there seems to have been an initial impulse to use the new\nintellectual tools provided by impersonal markets to come up with a new basis\nfor morality, and everywhere, it foundered. Mohism, with its notion of social\nprofit, flourished briefly and then collapsed. It was replaced by\nConfucianism, which rejected such ideas outright. We have already seen that\nreimagining moral responsibility in terms of debt—an impulse that cropped up\nin both Greece and India—while almost inevitable given the new economic\ncircumstances, seems to prove uniformly\nunsatisfying.[80](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts080) The stronger\nimpulse is to imagine another world where debt—and with it, all other worldly\nconnections—can be entirely annihilated, where social attachments are seen as\nforms of bondage; just as the body is a prison.\n\n7) Rulers’ attitudes changed over time. At first, most appear to have affected\nan attitude of bemused tolerance toward the new philosophical and religious\nmovements while privately embracing some version of cynical realpolitik, But\nas warring cities and principalities were replaced by great empires, and\nespecially, as those empires began to reach the limits of their expansion,\nsending the military-coinage-slavery complex into crisis, all this suddenly\nchanged. In India, Aśoka tried to re-found his kingdom on Buddhism; in Rome,\nConstantine turned to the Christians; in China, the Han emperor Wu-Ti (157–87\nBC), faced with a similar military and financial crisis, adopted Confucianism\nas the philosophy of state. Of the three, only Wu Ti was ultimately\nsuccessful: the Chinese empire endured, in one form or another, for two\nthousand years, almost always with Confucianism as its official ideology. In\nConstantine’s case the Western empire fell apart, but the Roman church\nendured. Aśoka’s project could be said to be the least successful. Not only\ndid his empire fall apart, replaced by an endless series of weaker, usually\nfragmentary kingdoms, but Buddhism itself was largely driven out of his one-\ntime territories, though it did establish itself much more firmly in China,\nNepal, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Korea, Japan, and much of Southeast Asia.\n\n8) The ultimate effect was a kind of ideal division of spheres of human\nactivity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other,\nreligion. To put the matter crudely: if one relegates a certain social space\nsimply to the selfish acquisition of material things, it is almost inevitable\nthat soon someone else will come to set aside another domain in which to\npreach that, from the perspective of ultimate values, material things are\nunimportant; that selfishness—or even the self—are illusory, and that to give\nis better than to receive. If nothing else, it is surely significant that all\nthe Axial Age religions emphasized the importance of charity, a concept that\nhad barely existed before. Pure greed and pure generosity are complementary\nconcepts; neither could really be imagined without the other; both could only\narise in institutional contexts that insisted on such pure and single-minded\nbehavior; and both seem to have appeared together wherever impersonal,\nphysical, cash money also appeared on the scene.\n\nAs for the religious movements: it would be easy enough to write them off as\nescapist, as promising the victims of the Axial Age empires liberation in the\nnext world as a way of letting them accept their lot in this one, and\nconvincing the rich that all they really owed the poor were occasional\ncharitable donations. Radical thinkers almost invariably do write them off in\nthis way. Surely, the willingness of the governments themselves to eventually\nembrace them would seem to support this conclusion. But the issue is more\ncomplicated. First of all, there is something to be said for escapism. Popular\nuprisings in the ancient world usually ended in the massacre of the rebels. As\nI’ve already observed, physical escape, such as via exodus or defection, has\nalways been the most effective response to oppressive conditions since the\nearliest times we know about. Where physical escape is not possible, what,\nexactly, is an oppressed peasant supposed to do? Sit and contemplate her\nmisery? At the very least, otherworldly religions provided glimpses of radical\nalternatives. Often they allowed people to create other worlds within this\none, liberated spaces of one sort or another. It is surely significant that\nthe only people who succeeded in abolishing slavery in the ancient world were\nreligious sects, such as the Essenes—who did so, effectively, by defecting\nfrom the larger social order and forming their own utopian\ncommunities.[81](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts081) Or, in a\nsmaller but more enduring example: the democratic city-states of northern\nIndia were all eventually stamped out by the great empires (Kautilya provides\nextensive advice on how to subvert and destroy democratic constitutions), but\nthe Buddha admired the democratic organization of their public assemblies and\nadopted it as the model for his\nfollowers.[82](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c09-nts082) Buddhist\nmonasteries are still called _sangha_ , the ancient name for such republics,\nand continue to operate by the same consensus-finding process to this day,\npreserving a certain egalitarian democratic ideal that would otherwise have\nbeen entirely forgotten.\n\nFinally, the larger historical achievements of these movements are not, in\nfact, insignificant. As they took hold, things began to change. Wars became\nless brutal and less frequent. Slavery faded as an institution, to the point\nat which, by the Middle Ages, it had become insignificant or even nonexistent\nacross most of Eurasia. Everywhere too, the new religious authorities began to\nseriously address the social dislocations introduced by debt.\n\n\n# Chapter Ten  \n  \nTHE MIDDLE AGES\n\n# _(600 – 450 AD)_\n\n_Artificial wealth comprises the things which of themselves satisfy no natural\nneed, for example money, which is a human contrivance_.\n\n—St. Thomas Aquinas\n\nIF THE AXIAL AGE saw the emergence of complementary ideals of commodity\nmarkets and universal world religions, the Middle Ages were the period in\nwhich those two institutions began to merge.\n\nEverywhere, the age began with the collapse of empires. Eventually, new states\nformed, but in these new states, the nexus between war, bullion, and slavery\nwas broken; conquest and acquisition for their own sake were no longer\ncelebrated as the end of all political life. At the same time, economic life,\nfrom the conduct of international trade to the organization of local markets,\ncame to fall increasingly under the regulation of religious authorities. One\nresult was a widespread movement to control, or even forbid, predatory\nlending. Another was a return, across Eurasia, to various forms of virtual\ncredit money.\n\nGranted, this is not the way we’re used to thinking of the Middle Ages. For\nmost of us, “Medieval” remains a synonym for superstition, intolerance, and\noppression. Yet for most of the earth’s inhabitants, it could only be seen as\nan extraordinary improvement over the terrors of the Axial Age.\n\nOne reason for our skewed perception is that we’re used to thinking of the\nMiddle Ages as something that happened primarily in Western Europe, in\nterritories that had been little more than border outposts of the Roman Empire\nto begin with. According to the conventional wisdom, with the collapse of the\nempire, the cities were largely abandoned and the economy “reverted to\nbarter,” taking at least five centuries to recover. Even for Europe, though,\nthis is based on a series of unquestioned assumptions that, as I’ve said,\ncrumble the moment one starts seriously poking at them. Chief among them is\nthe idea that the absence of coins means the absence of money. True, the\ndestruction of the Roman war machine also meant that Roman coins went out of\ncirculation; and the few coins produced within the Gothic or Frankish kingdoms\nthat established themselves over the ruins of the old empire were largely\nfiduciary in nature.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts001) Still,\na glance at the “barbarian law codes” reveals that even at the height of the\nDark Ages, people were still carefully keeping accounts in Roman money as they\ncalculated interest rates, contracts, and mortgages. Again, cities shriveled,\nand many were abandoned, but even this was something of a mixed blessing.\nCertainly, it had a terrible effect on literacy; but one must also bear in\nmind that ancient cities could only be maintained by extracting resources from\nthe countryside. Roman Gaul, for instance, had been a network of cities,\nconnected by the famous Roman roads to an endless succession of slave\nplantations, which were owned by the urban\ngrandees.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts002) After around 400\nad, the population of the towns declined radically, but the plantations also\ndisappeared. In the following centuries, many came to be replaced by manors,\nchurches, and even later, castles—where new local lords extracted their own\ndues from the surrounding farmers. But one need only do the math: since\nMedieval agriculture was no less efficient than ancient agriculture (in fact,\nit rapidly became a great deal more so), the amount of work required to feed a\nhandful of mounted warriors and clergymen could not possibly have been\nanything like that required to feed entire cities. However oppressed Medieval\nserfs might have been, their plight was nothing compared with that of their\nAxial Age equivalents.\n\nStill, the Middle Ages proper are best seen as having begun not in Europe but\nin India and China, between 400 and 600 ad, and then sweeping across much of\nthe western half of Eurasia with the advent of Islam. They only really reached\nEurope four hundred years later. Let us begin our story, then, in India.\n\n## Medieval India  \n(Flight into Hierarchy)\n\nI left off in India with Aśoka’s embrace of Buddhism, but I noted that\nultimately, his project foundered. Neither his empire nor his church was to\nendure. It took a good deal of time, however, for this failure to occur.\n\nThe Mauryans represented a high watermark of empire. The next five hundred\nyears saw a succession of kingdoms, most of them strongly supportive of\nBuddhism. Stupas and monasteries sprang up everywhere, but the states that\nsponsored them grew weaker and weaker; centralized armies dissolved; soldiers,\nlike officials, increasingly came to be paid by land grants rather than\nsalaries. As a result, the number of coins in circulation steadily\ndeclined.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts003) Here too, the\nearly Middle Ages witnessed a dramatic decline of cities: where the Greek\nambassador Megasthenes described Aśoka’s capital of Patna as the largest city\nin the world of his day, Medieval Arab and Chinese travelers described India\nas a land of endless tiny villages.\n\nAs a result, most historians have come to write, much as they do in Europe, of\na collapse of the money economy; of commerce becoming a “reversion to barter.”\nHere too, this appears to be simply untrue. What vanished were the military\nmeans to extract resources from the peasants. In fact, Hindu law-books written\nat the time show increasing attention to credit arrangements, with a\nsophisticated language of sureties, collateral, mortgages, promissory notes,\nand compound interest.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts004) One\nneed only consider how the Buddhist establishments popping up all over India\nduring these centuries were funded. While the earliest monks were wandering\nmendicants, owning little more than their begging bowls, early Medieval\nmonasteries were often magnificent establishments with vast treasuries. Still,\nin principle, their operations were financed almost entirely through credit.\n\nThe key innovation was the creation of what were called the “perpetual\nendowments” or “inexhaustible treasuries.” Say a lay supporter wished to make\na contribution to her local monastery. Rather than offering to provide candles\nfor a specific ritual, or servants to attend to the upkeep of the monastic\ngrounds, she would provide a certain sum of money—or something worth a great\ndeal of money—that would then be loaned out in the name of the monastery, at\nthe accepted 15-percent annual rate. The interest on the loan would then be\nearmarked for that specific\npurpose.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts005) An inscription\ndiscovered at the Great Monastery of Sanci sometime around 450 ad provides a\nhandy illustration. A woman named Harisvamini donates the relatively modest\nsum of twelve _dinaras_ to the “Noble Community of\nMonks.”[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts006) The text carefully\ninscribes how the income is to be divided up: the interest on five of the\ndinaras was to provide daily meals for five different monks, the interest from\nanother three would pay to light three lamps for the Buddha, in memory of her\nparents, and so forth. The inscription ends by saying that this was a\npermanent endowment, “created with a document in stone to last as long as the\nmoon and the sun”: since the principal would never be touched, the\ncontribution would last\nforever.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts007)\n\nSome of these loans presumably went to individuals, others were commercial\nloans to “guilds of bamboo-workers, braziers, and potters,” or to village\nassemblies.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts008) We have to\nassume that in most cases the money is an accounting unit: what were really\nbeing transacted were animals, wheat, silk, butter, fruit, and all the other\ngoods whose appropriate rates of interest were so carefully stipulated in the\nlaw-codes of the time. Still, large amounts of gold did end up flowing into\nmonastic coffers. When coins go out of circulation, after all, the metal\ndoesn’t simply disappear. In the Middle Ages—and this seems to have been true\nacross Eurasia—the vast majority of it ended up in religious establishments,\nchurches, monasteries, and temples, either stockpiled in hoards and treasuries\nor gilded onto or cast into altars, sanctums, and sacred instruments. Above\nall, it was shaped into images of gods. As a result, those rulers who did try\nto put an Axial Age–style coinage system back into circulation—invariably, to\nfund some project of military expansion—often had to pursue self-consciously\nanti-religious policies in order to do so. Probably the most notorious was one\nHarsa, who ruled Kashmir from 1089 to 1101 ad, who is said to have appointed\nan officer called the “Superintendent for the Destruction of the Gods.”\nAccording to later histories, Harsa employed leprous monks to systematically\ndesecrate divine images with urine and excrement, thus neutralizing their\npower, before dragging them off to be melted\ndown.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts009) He is said to have\ndestroyed more than four thousand Buddhist establishments before being\nbetrayed and killed, the last of his dynasty—and his miserable fate was long\nheld out as an example of where the revival of the old ways was likely to lead\none in the end.\n\nFor the most part, then, the gold remained sacrosanct, laid up in the sacred\nplaces—though in India, over time these were increasingly Hindu ones, not\nBuddhist. What we now see as traditional Hindu-village India appears to have\nbeen largely a creation of the early Middle Ages. We do not know precisely how\nit happened. As kingdoms continued to rise and fall, the world inhabited by\nkings and princes became increasingly distant from that of most people’s\neveryday affairs. During much of the period immediately following the collapse\nof the Mauryan empire, for instance, much of India was governed by\nforeigners.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts010) Apparently,\nthis increasing distance allowed local Brahmins to begin reshaping the\nnew—increasingly rural—society along strictly hierarchical principles.\n\nThey did it above all by seizing control of the administration of law. The\nDharmaśāstra, law-codes produced by Brahmin scholars between roughly 200 bc\nand 400 ad, give us a good idea of the new vision of society. In it, old ideas\nlike the Vedic conception of a debt to gods, sages, and ancestors were\nresuscitated—but now, they applied only and specifically to Brahmins, whose\nduty and privilege it was to stand in for all humanity before the forces that\ncontrolled the universe.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts011)\nFar from being required to attain learning, members of the inferior classes\nwere forbidden to do so: the Laws of Manu, for instance, set down that any\nSudra (the lowest caste, assigned to farming and material production) who so\nmuch as listened in on the teaching of the law or sacred texts should have\nmolten lead poured into their ears; on the occasion of a repeat offense, have\ntheir tongues cut out.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts012) At\nthe same time Brahmins, however ferociously they guarded their privileges,\nalso adopted aspects of once-radical Buddhist and Jain ideas like karma,\nreincarnation, and _ahimsa_. Brahmins were expected to refrain from any sort\nof physical violence, and even to become vegetarians. In alliance with\nrepresentatives of the old warrior caste, they also managed to win control of\nmost of the land in the ancient villages. Artisans and craftsmen fleeing the\ndecline or destruction of cities often ended up as suppliant refugees, and,\ngradually, low-caste clients. The result were increasingly complex local\npatronage systems in the countryside— _jajmani_ systems, as they came to be\nknown—where the refugees provided services for the landowning castes, who took\non many of the roles once held by the state, providing protection and justice,\nextracting labor dues, and so on—but also protected local communities from\nactual royal\nrepresentatives.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts013)\n\nThis latter function is crucial. Foreign visitors were later to be awed by the\nself-sufficiency of the traditional Indian village, with its elaborate system\nof landowning castes, farmers, and such “service castes” as barbers, smiths,\ntanners, drummers, and washermen, all arranged in hierarchical order, each\nseen as making its own unique and necessary contribution to their little\nsociety, all of it typically operating entirely without the use of metal\ncurrency. It was only possible for those reduced to the status of Sudras and\nUntouchables to have a chance of accepting their lowly position because the\nexaction of local landlords was, again, on nothing like the same scale as that\nunder earlier governments—under which villagers had to support cities of\nupwards of a million people—and because the village community became an\neffective means of holding the state and its representatives at least\npartially at bay.\n\nWe don’t know the mechanisms that brought this world about, but the role of\ndebt was surely significant. The creation of thousands of Hindu temples alone\nmust have involved hundreds of thousands, even millions, of interest-bearing\nloans—since, while Brahmins were themselves forbidden to lend money at\ninterest, temples were not. We can already see, in the earliest of the new\nlaw-codes, the Laws of Manu, the way that local authorities were struggling to\nreconcile old customs like debt peonage and chattel slavery with the desire to\nestablish an overarching hierarchical system in which everyone knew their\nplace. The Laws of Manu carefully classify slaves into seven types depending\non how they were reduced to slavery (war, debt, self-sale …) and explain the\nconditions under which each might be emancipated—but then go on to say that\nSudras can never really be emancipated, since, after all, they were created to\nserve the other castes.[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts014)\nSimilarly, where earlier codes had established a 15-percent annual rate of\ninterest, with exceptions for commercial\nloans,[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts015) the new codes\norganized interest by caste: stating that one could charge a maximum of 2\npercent a month for a Brahmin, 3 percent for a Ksatriya (warrior), 4 percent\nfor a Vaisya (merchant), and 5 percent for a Sudra—which is the difference\nbetween 24 percent annually on the one extreme and a hefty 60 percent on the\nother.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts016) The laws also\nidentify five different ways interest can be paid, of which the most\nsignificant for our concerns is “bodily interest”: physical labor in the\ncreditor’s house or fields, to be rendered until such time as the principal is\ncleared. Even here, though, caste considerations were paramount. No one could\nbe forced into the service of anyone of lower caste; moreover, since debts\nwere enforceable on a debtor’s children and even grandchildren, “until the\nprincipal is cleared” could mean quite some time—as the Indian historian R.S.\nSharma notes, such stipulations “remind us of the present practice according\nto which several generations of the same family have been reduced to the\nposition of hereditary ploughmen in consideration of some paltry sum advanced\nto them.”[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts017)\n\nIndeed, India has become notorious as a country in which a very large part of\nthe working population is laboring in effective debt peonage to a landlord or\nother creditor. Such arrangements became even easier over time. By about 1000\nad, restrictions on usury by members of the upper castes in Hindu law-codes\nlargely disappeared. On the other hand, 1000 ad was about the same time that\nIslam appeared in India—a religion dedicated to eradicating usury altogether.\nSo at the very least we can say that these things never stopped being\ncontested. And even Hindu law of that time was far more humane than almost\nanything found in the ancient world. Debtors were not, generally speaking,\nreduced to slavery, and there is no widespread evidence of the selling of\nwomen or children. In fact, overt slavery had largely vanished from the\ncountryside by this time. And debt peons were not even pawns, exactly; by law,\nthey were simply paying interest on a freely contracted agreement. Even when\nthat took generations, the law stipulated that even if the principal was never\npaid, in the third generation, they would be freed.\n\nThere is a peculiar tension here: a kind of paradox. Debt and credit\narrangements may well have played a crucial role in creating the Indian\nvillage system, but they could never really become their basis. It might have\nmade a certain sense to declare that, just as Brahmins had to dispatch their\ndebts to the gods, everyone should be, in a certain sense, in debt to those\nabove them. But in another sense, that would have completely subverted the\nvery idea of caste, which was that the universe was a vast hierarchy in which\ndifferent sorts of people were assumed to be of fundamentally different\nnatures, that these ranks and grades were fixed forever, and that when goods\nand services moved up and down the hierarchy, they followed not principles of\nexchange at all but (as in all hierarchical systems) custom and precedent. The\nFrench anthropologist Louis Dumont made the famous argument that one cannot\neven really talk about “inequality” here, because to use that phrase implies\nthat one believes people should or could be equal, and this idea was\ncompletely alien to Hindu\nconceptions.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts018) For them to\nhave imagined their responsibilities as debts would have been profoundly\nsubversive, since debts are by definition arrangements between equals—at least\nin the sense that they are equal parties to a contract—that could and should\nbe repaid.[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts019)\n\nPolitically, it is never a particularly good idea to first tell people they\nare your equals, and then humiliate and degrade them. This is presumably why\npeasant insurrections, from Chiapas to Japan, have so regularly aimed to wipe\nout debts, rather than focus on more structural issues like caste systems, or\neven slavery.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts020) The British\nRaj discovered this to their occasional chagrin when they used debt\npeonage—superimposed on the caste system—as the basis of their labor system in\ncolonial India. Perhaps the paradigmatic popular insurrection was the Deccan\nriots of 1875, when indebted farmers rose up to seize and systematically\ndestroy the account books of local money-lenders. Debt peonage, it would\nappear, is far more likely to inspire outrage and collective action than is a\nsystem premised on pure inequality.\n\n## China:\n\n### Buddhism and the Economy of Infinite Debt\n\nBy Medieval standards, India was unusual for resisting the appeal of the great\nAxial Age religions, but we observe the basic pattern: the decline of empire,\narmies, and cash economy, the rise of religious authorities, independent of\nthe state, who win much of their popular legitimacy through their ability to\nregulate emerging credit systems.\n\nChina might be said to represent the opposite extreme. This was the one place\nwhere a late Axial Age attempt to yoke empire and religion together was a\ncomplete success. True, here as elsewhere, there was an initial period of\nbreakdown: after the collapse of the Han dynasty around 220 ad, the central\nstate broke apart, cities shrank, coins disappeared, and so on. But in China\nthis was only temporary. As Max Weber long ago pointed out, once one sets up a\ngenuinely effective bureaucracy, it’s almost impossible to get rid of it. And\nthe Chinese bureaucracy was uniquely effective. Before long, the old Han\nsystem reemerged: a centralized state, run by Confucian scholar-gentry trained\nin the literary classics, selected through a national exam system, working in\nmeticulously organized national and regional bureaus where the money supply,\nlike other economic matters, was continually monitored and regulated. Chinese\nmonetary theory was always chartalist. This was partly just an effect of size:\nthe empire and its internal market were so huge that foreign trade was never\nespecially important; therefore, those running the government were well aware\nthat they could turn pretty much anything into money, simply by insisting that\ntaxes be paid in that form.\n\nThe two great threats to the authorities were always the same: the nomadic\npeoples to the north (who they systematically bribed, but who nonetheless\nperiodically swept over and conquered sections of China) and popular unrest\nand rebellion. The latter was almost constant, and on a scale unknown anywhere\nelse in human history. There were decades in Chinese history when the rate of\nrecorded peasant uprisings was roughly 1.8 _per hour._[\n21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts021) What’s more, such\nuprisings were frequently successful. Most of the most famous Chinese\ndynasties that were not the product of barbarian invasion (the Yuan or Qing)\nwere originally peasant insurrections (the Han, Tang, Sung, and Ming). In no\nother part of the world do we see anything like this. As a result, Chinese\nstatecraft ultimately came down to funneling enough resources to the cities to\nfeed the urban population and keep the nomads at bay, without causing a\nnotoriously contumacious rural population to rise up in arms. The official\nConfucian ideology of patriarchal authority, equal opportunity, promotion of\nagriculture, light taxes, and careful government control of merchants seemed\nexpressly designed to appeal to the interests and sensibilities of a\n(potentially rebellious) rural\npatriarch.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts022)\n\nOne need hardly add that in these circumstances, limiting the depredations of\nthe local village loan shark—the traditional bane of rural families—was a\nconstant government concern. Over and over we hear the same familiar story:\npeasants down on their luck, whether due to natural disaster or the need to\npay for a parent’s funeral—would fall into the hands of predatory lenders, who\nwould seize their fields and houses, forcing them to work or pay rent in what\nhad once been their own lands; the threat of rebellion would then drive the\ngovernment to institute a dramatic program of reforms. One of the first we\nknow about came in the form of a coup d’état in 9 ad, when a Confucian\nofficial named Wang Mang seized the throne to deal (so he claimed) with a\nnationwide debt crisis. According to proclamations made at the time, the\npractice of usury had caused the effective tax rate (that is, the amount of\nthe average peasant’s harvest that ended up being carried off by someone else)\nto rise from just over 3 percent, to 50\npercent.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts023) In reaction, Wang\nMang instituted a program reforming the currency, nationalizing large estates,\npromoting state-run industries—including public granaries—and banning private\nholding of slaves. Wang Mang also established a state loan agency that would\noffer interest-free funeral loans for up to ninety days for those caught\nunprepared by the death of relatives, as well as long-term loans of 3 percent\nmonthly or 10 percent annual income rates for commercial or agricultural\ninvestments.[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts024) “With this\nscheme,” one historian remarks, “Wang was confident that all business\ntransactions would be under his scrutiny and the abuse of usury would be\nforever eradicated.”[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts025)\n\nNeedless to say, it was not, and later Chinese history is full of similar\nstories: widespread inequality and unrest followed by the appointment of\nofficial commissions of inquiry, regional debt relief (either blanket\namnesties or annulments of all loans in which interest had exceeded the\nprincipal), cheap grain loans, famine relief, laws against the selling of\nchildren.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts026) All this became\nthe standard fare of government policy. It was very unevenly successful; it\ncertainly did not create an egalitarian peasant utopia, but it prevented any\nwidespread return to Axial Age conditions.\n\nWe are used to thinking of such bureaucratic interventions—particularly the\nmonopolies and regulations—as state restriction on “the market”—owing to the\nprevailing prejudice that sees markets as quasi-natural phenomena that emerge\nby themselves, and governments as having no role other than to squelch or\nsiphon from them. I have repeatedly pointed out how mistaken this is, but\nChina provides a particularly striking example. The Confucian state may have\nbeen the world’s greatest and most enduring bureaucracy, but it actively\npromoted markets, and as a result, commercial life in China soon became far\nmore sophisticated, and markets more developed, than anywhere else in the\nworld.\n\nThis despite the fact that Confucian orthodoxy was overtly hostile to\nmerchants and even the profit motive itself. Commercial profit was seen as\nlegitimate only as compensation for the labor that merchants expended in\ntransporting goods from one place to another, but never as fruits of\nspeculation. What this meant in practice was that they were pro-market but\nanti-capitalist.\n\nAgain, this seems bizarre, since we’re used to assuming that capitalism and\nmarkets are the same thing, but, as the great French historian Fernand Braudel\npointed out, in many ways they could equally well be conceived as opposites.\nWhile markets are ways of exchanging goods through the medium of\nmoney—historically, ways for those with a surplus of grain to acquire candles\nand vice versa (in economic shorthand, C-M-C’, for commodity-money-other\ncommodity)—capitalism is first and foremost the art of using money to get more\nmoney (M-C-M’). Normally, the easiest way to do this is by establishing some\nkind of formal or de facto monopoly. For this reason, capitalists, whether\nmerchant princes, financiers, or industrialists, invariably try to ally\nthemselves with political authorities to limit the freedom of the market, so\nas to make it easier for them to do\nso.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts027) From this perspective,\nChina was for most of its history the ultimate anti-capitalist market\nstate.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts028) Unlike later\nEuropean princes, Chinese rulers systematically refused to team up with would-\nbe Chinese capitalists (who always existed). Instead, like their officials,\nthey saw them as destructive parasites—though, unlike the usurers, ones whose\nfundamentally selfish and antisocial motivations could still be put to use in\ncertain ways. In Confucian terms, merchants were like soldiers. Those drawn to\na career in the military were assumed to be driven largely by a love of\nviolence. As individuals, they were not good people; but they were also\nnecessary to defend the frontiers. Similarly, merchants were driven by greed\nand basically immoral; yet if kept under careful administrative supervision,\nthey could be made to serve the public\ngood.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts029) Whatever one might\nthink of the principles, the results are hard to deny. For most of its\nhistory, China maintained the highest standard of living in the world—even\nEngland only really overtook it in perhaps the 1820s, well past the time of\nthe Industrial Revolution.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts030)\n\nConfucianism is not precisely a religion, perhaps; it is usually considered\nmore an ethical and philosophical system. So China too could be considered\nsomething of a departure from the common Medieval pattern, whereby commerce\nwas, almost everywhere, brought under the control of religion. But it wasn’t a\ncomplete departure. One need only consider the remarkable economic role of\nBuddhism in this same period. Buddhism had arrived in China through the\nCentral Asia caravan routes and in its early days was largely a religion\npromoted by merchants, but in the chaos following the collapse of the Han\ndynasty in 220 ad, it began to take popular roots. The Liang (502–557) and\nTang (618–907) dynasties saw outbreaks of passionate religious fervor, in\nwhich thousands of rural young people across China would renounce their farms,\nshops, and families to seek ordination as Buddhist monks and nuns; where\nmerchants or landed magnates pledged their entire fortunes to the propagation\nof the Dharma; building projects hollowed out whole mountains to create\nbodhisattvas and giant statues of the Buddha; and pageants where monks and\ndevotees ritually burned their heads and hands or, in some instances, set\nthemselves on fire. By the mid–fifth century, there were dozens of such\nspectacular suicides; they became, as one historian put it “a macabre kind of\nfashion.”[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts031)\n\nHistorians differ over their meaning. Certainly the passions unleashed\nprovided a dramatic alternative to the staid orthodoxy of the Confucian\nliterati, but it’s also surprising, to say the least, to see this in a\nreligion promoted above all by the commercial classes. The French Sinologist\nJacques Gernet observes:\n\nIt is clear that these suicides, so contrary to traditional morality, aimed to\nredeem the sins of all beings, to compel the gods and men at one and the same\ntime. And they were staged: usually, in the fifth century, a pyre was erected\non a mountain. The suicide took place in the presence of a large crowd\nuttering lamentations and bringing forward rich offerings. People of all\nsocial ranks attended the spectacle together. After the fire had burned out,\nthe ashes of the monk were collected and a stupa, a new place of worship, was\ncreated to house them.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts032)\n\nGernet’s picture of dozens of Christ-like redeemers seems overstated, but the\nprecise meaning of these suicides was unclear—and widely debated—even in the\nMiddle Ages. Some contemporaries saw them as the ultimate expression of\ncontempt for the body; others as recognition of the illusory nature of the\nself and all material attachments; yet others, as the ultimate form of\ncharity, the giving of that which can only be most precious, one’s very\nphysical existence, as a sacrifice to the benefit of all living things; a\nsentiment that one tenth-century biographer expressed in the following verses:\n\nTo give away the thing that is difficult to part with,\n\nIs the best offering amongst the alms.\n\nLet this impure and sinful body,\n\nTurn into something like a\ndiamond.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts033)\n\nThat is, an object of eternal value, an investment that can bear fruit for all\neternity.\n\nI draw attention to this because this sentiment provides an elegant\nillustration of a problem that seems to have first appeared in the world with\nnotions of pure charity that always seemed to accompany Axial Age religions,\nand which provided endless philosophical conundrums. In human economies, it\ndoes not appear to have occurred to anyone that any act _could_ be either\npurely selfish or purely altruistic. As I noted in chapter five, an act of\nabsolute selfless giving can only also be absolutely antisocial—hence in a\nway, inhuman. It is merely the mirror image of an act of theft or even murder;\nhence, it makes a certain sort of sense that suicide be conceived as the\nultimate selfless gift. Yet this is the door that necessarily opens as soon as\none develops a notion of “profit” and then tries to conceive its opposite.\n\nThis tension seems to hang over the economic life of Medieval Chinese\nBuddhism, which, true to its commercial origins, retained a striking tendency\nto employ the language of the marketplace. “One purchases felicity, and sells\none’s sins,” wrote one monk, “just as in commercial\noperations.”[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts034) Nowhere was\nthis so true as in those schools, such as the School of the Three Stages, that\nadopted the notion of “karmic debt”—that each of the sins of one’s accumulated\npast lives continues as a debt needing to be discharged. An obscure and\nunusual view in classical Indian Buddhism, the notion of karmic debt took on a\npowerful new life in\nChina.[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts035) As one Three Stages\ntext puts it, we all know that insolvent debtors will be reborn as animals or\nslaves; but in reality, we are all insolvent debtors, because acquiring the\nmoney to repay our temporal debts necessarily means acquire new, spiritual\nones, since every means of acquiring wealth will necessarily involve\nexploiting, damaging, and causing suffering to other living beings.\n\nSome use their power and authority as officials in order to bend the law and\nseize wealth. Some prosper in the marketplace … They engage in an excess of\nlies and cheat and extort profits from others. Still others, farmers, burn the\nmountains and marshes, flood the fields, plough and mill, destroying the nests\nand burrows of animals …\n\nThere is no avoiding the fact of our past debts, and it is difficult to\ncomprehend the number of separate lives it would require if you wanted to pay\nthem one by one.[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts036)\n\nAs Gernet remarks, the idea of life as an endless burden of debt would surely\nhave struck a chord with Chinese villagers, for whom this was all too often\nliterally true; but, as he also points out, like their counterparts in ancient\nIsrael, they were also familiar with that sense of sudden liberation that came\nwith official amnesties. There was a way to achieve that too. All that was\nrequired was to make regular donations to some monastery’s Inexhaustible\nTreasury. The moment one does so, the debts from every one of one’s past lives\nare instantly blotted out. The author even provides a little parable, not\nunlike Jesus’s parable of the ungrateful servant, but far more optimistic.\nHow, it might be asked, would a poor man’s tiny contribution possibly have\nsuch cosmic effects?\n\nAnswer: In a parable it is like a poor man burdened by a debt of one thousand\nstrings of coins to another person. He always suffers from his debt, and the\npoor man is afraid whenever the debt-master comes to collect.\n\nHe visits the rich man’s house and confesses he is beyond the time-limit and\nbegs forgiveness for his offense—he is poor and without a station in life. He\ntells him that each day he makes a single coin he will return it to the rich\nman. On hearing this, the rich man is very pleased and forgives him for being\noverdue; moreover, the poor man is not dragged away to jail.\n\nGiving to the Inexhaustible Storehouse is also like\nthis.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts037)\n\nOne might almost call this salvation on the installment plan—but the\nimplication is that the payments shall be made, like the interest payments on\nthe wealth when it is subsequently loaned out, for all eternity.\n\nOther schools concentrated not on karmic debt, but on one’s debt to one’s\nparents. Where Confucians built their system of morality above all on filial\npiety to fathers, Chinese Buddhists were primarily concerned with mothers;\nwith the care and suffering required in raising, feeding, and educating\nchildren. A mother’s kindness is unlimited, her selflessness absolute; this\nwas seen to be embodied above all in the act of breastfeeding, the fact that\nmothers transform their very flesh and blood into milk; they feed their\nchildren with their own bodies. In doing so, however, they allow unlimited\nlove to be precisely quantified. One author calculated that the average infant\nabsorbs precisely 180 pecks of mother’s milk in its first three years of life,\nand this constitutes its debt as an adult. The figure soon became canonical.\nTo repay this milk debt, or indeed one’s debt to one’s parents more generally,\nwas simply impossible. “If you stacked up jewels from the ground up to the\ntwenty-eighth heaven,” wrote one Buddhist author, “it would not compare” with\nthe value of your parent’s\nnurturance.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts038) Even if you\nwere to “cut your own flesh to offer her three times a day for four billion\nyears,” wrote another, “it would not pay back even a single day” of what your\nmother did for you.[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts039)\n\nThe solution, however, is the same: donating money to the Inexhaustible\nTreasuries. The result was an elaborate cycle of debts and forms of\nredemption. A man begins with an unpayable milk-debt. The only thing of\ncomparable value is the Dharma, the Buddhist truth itself. One can thus repay\none’s parents by bringing them to Buddhism; indeed, this can be done even\nafter death, when one’s mother will otherwise wind up as a hungry ghost in\nhell. If one makes a donation to the Inexhaustible Treasuries in her name,\nsutras will be recited for her; she will be delivered; the money, in the\nmeantime, will be put partly to work as charity, as pure gift, but partly,\ntoo, as in India, as interest-bearing loans, earmarked for specific purposes\nfor the furtherance of Buddhist education, ritual, or monastic life.\n\nThe Chinese Buddhist approach to charity was nothing if not multifaceted.\nFestivals often led to vast outpourings of contributions, with wealthy\nadherents vying with one another in generosity, often driving their entire\nfortunes to the monasteries, in the forms of oxcarts laden with millions of\nstrings of cash—a kind of economic self-immolation that paralleled the\nspectacular monastic suicides. Their contributions swelled the Inexhaustible\nTreasuries. Some would be given to the needy, particularly in times of\nhardship. Some would be loaned. One practice that hovered between charity and\nbusiness was providing peasants with alternatives to the local moneylender.\nMost monasteries had attendant pawnshops where the local poor could place some\nvaluable possession—a robe, a couch, a mirror—in hock in exchange for low-\ninterest loans.[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts040) Finally,\nthere was the business of the monastery itself: that portion of the\nInexhaustible Treasury turned over to the management of lay brothers, and\neither put out at loan or invested. Since monks were not allowed to eat the\nproducts of their own fields, the fruit or grain had to be put on the market,\nfurther swelling monastic revenues. Most monasteries came to be surrounded not\nonly by commercial farms but veritable industrial complexes of oil presses,\nflour mills, shops, and hostels, often with thousands of bonded\nworkers.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts041) At the same time,\nthe Treasuries themselves became—as Gernet was perhaps the first to point\nout—the world’s first genuine forms of concentrated finance capital. They\nwere, after all, enormous concentrations of wealth managed by what were in\neffect monastic corporations, which were constantly seeking new opportunities\nfor profitable investment. They even shared the quintessential capitalist\nimperative of continual growth; the Treasuries had to expand, since according\nto Mahayana doctrine, genuine liberation would not be possible until the whole\nworld embraced the Dharma.[42](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts042)\n\nThis was precisely the situation—huge concentrations of capital interested in\nnothing more than profit—that Confucian economic policy was supposed to\nprevent. Still, it took some time for Chinese governments to recognize the\nthreat. Government attitudes veered back and forth. At first, especially in\nthe chaotic years of the early Middle Ages, monks were welcomed—even given\ngenerous land grants and provided with convict laborers to reclaim forests and\nmarshes, and tax-exempt status for their business\nenterprises.[43](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts043) A few\nemperors converted, and while most of the bureaucracy kept the monks at arm’s\nlength, Buddhism became especially popular with court women, as well as with\neunuchs and many scions of wealthy families. As time went on, though,\nadministrators turned from seeing monks as a boon to rural society to its\npotential ruination. Already, by 511 ad, there were decrees condemning monks\nfor diverting grain that was supposed to be used for charitable purposes to\nhigh-interest loans, and altering debt contracts—a government commission had\nto be appointed to review the accounts and nullify any loans in which interest\nwas found to have exceeded principal. In 713 ad we have another decree,\nconfiscating two Inexhaustible Treasuries of the Three Stages sect, whose\nmembers they accused of fraudulent\nsolicitation.[44](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts044) Before long\nthere were major campaigns of government repression, at first often limited to\ncertain regions, but over time, more often empire-wide. During the most\nsevere, carried out in 845 ad, a total of 4,600 monasteries were razed along\nwith their shops and mills, 260,000 monks and nuns forcibly defrocked and\nreturned to their families—but at the same time, according to government\nreports, 150,000 temple serfs released from bondage.\n\nWhatever the real reasons behind the waves of repression (and these were no\ndoubt many), the official reason was always the same: a need to restore the\nmoney supply. The monasteries were becoming so large, and so rich,\nadministrators insisted, that China was simply running out of metal:\n\nThe great repressions of Buddhism under the Chou emperor Wu between 574 and\n577, under Wu-tsung in 842–845, and finally in 955, presented themselves\nprimarily as measures of economic recovery: each of them provided an\nopportunity for the imperial government to procure the necessary copper for\nthe minting of new coins.[45](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts045)\n\nOne reason is that monks appear to have been systematically melting down\nstrings of coins, often hundreds of thousands at a time, to build colossal\ncopper or even gilded copper statues of the Buddha—along with other objects\nsuch as bells and copper chimes, or even such extravagances as mirrored halls\nor gilded copper roof tiles. The result, according to official commissions of\ninquiry, was economically disastrous: the price of metals would soar, coinage\ndisappear, and rural marketplaces cease to function, even as those rural\npeople whose children had not become monks often fell deeper into debt to the\nmonasteries.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIt perhaps stands to reason that Chinese Buddhism, a religion of merchants\nthat then took popular roots, should have developed in this direction: a\ngenuine theology of debt, even perhaps a practice of absolute self-sacrifice,\nof abandoning everything, one’s fortune or even one’s life, that ultimately\nled to collectively managed finance capital. The reason that the result seems\nso weird, so full of paradoxes, is that it is again an attempt to apply the\nlogic of exchange to questions of Eternity.\n\nRecall an idea from earlier in the book: exchange, unless it’s an\ninstantaneous cash transaction, creates debts. Debts linger over time. If you\nimagine all human relations as exchange, then insofar as people do have\nongoing relations with one another, those relations are laced with debt and\nsin. The only way out is to annihilate the debt, but then social relations\nvanish too. This is quite in accord with Buddhism, whose ultimate aim is\nindeed the attainment of “emptiness,” absolute liberation, the annihilation of\nall human and material attachments, since these are all ultimately causes of\nsuffering. For Mahayana Buddhists, however, absolute liberation cannot be\nachieved by any one being independently; the liberation of each depends on all\nthe others; therefore, until the end of time, such matters are in a certain\nsense always in suspension.\n\nIn the meantime, exchange dominates: “One purchases felicity, and sells one’s\nsins, just as in commercial operations.” Even acts of charity and self-\nsacrifice are not purely generous; one is purchasing “merit” from the\nbodhisattvas.[46](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts046) The notion\nof infinite debt comes in when this logic slams up against the Absolute, or,\none might perhaps better say, against something that utterly defies the logic\nof exchange. Because there are things that do. This would explain, for\ninstance, the odd urge to first quantify the exact amount of milk one has\nabsorbed at one’s mother’s breast, and then to say that there is no\nconceivable way to repay it. Exchange implies interaction between equivalent\nbeings. Your mother, on the other hand, is not an equivalent being. She\ncreated you out of her own flesh. This is exactly the point that I suggested\nthe Vedic authors were subtly trying to make when they talked about “debts” to\nthe gods: of course you cannot really “pay your debt to the universe”—that\nwould imply that (1) you and (2) everything that exists (including you) are in\nsome sense equivalent entities. This is clearly absurd. The closest you can\ncome to repayment is to simply recognize that fact. Such recognition is the\ntrue meaning of sacrifice. Like Rospabé’s original money, a sacrificial\noffering is not a way to pay a debt, but a way to acknowledge the\nimpossibility of the idea that there could ever be repayment:\n\nThe parallel was not missed in certain mythological traditions. According to\none famous Hindu myth, two gods, the brothers Kartikeya and Ganesha, had a\nquarrel over who should be the first to marry. Their mother Parvati suggested\na contest: the winner would be the one to most quickly circle the entire\nuniverse. Kartikeya set off on the back of a giant peacock. It took him three\nyears to transverse the limits of the cosmos. Ganesha bided his time, then,\nfinally, walked in a circle around his mother, remarking, “You are the\nuniverse to me.”\n\nI’ve also argued that any system of exchange is always necessarily founded on\nsomething else, something that, in its social manifestation at least, is\nultimately communism. With all those things that we treat as eternal, that we\nassume will always be there—our mother’s love, true friendship, sociality,\nhumanity, belonging, the existence of the cosmos—no calculation is necessary,\nor even ultimately possible; insofar as there is give and take, they follow\ncompletely different principles. What, then, happens to such absolute and\nunlimited phenomena when one tries to imagine the world as a set of\ntransactions—as exchange? Generally, one of two things. We either ignore or\ndeify them. (Mothers, and caregiving women in general, are a classic case in\npoint.) Or we do both. What we treat as eternal in our actual relations with\none another vanishes and reappears as an abstraction, an\nabsolute.[47](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts047) In the case of\nBuddhism, this was framed as the inexhaustible merit of bodhisatt-vas, who\nexist, in a certain sense, outside of time. They are at once the model for the\nInexhaustible Treasuries, and also their practical foundation: one can only\nrepay one’s endless karmic debt, or one’s infinite milk-debt, by drawing on\nthis equally infinite pool of redemption, which, in turn, becomes the basis\nfor the actual material funds of the monasteries, which are equally eternal—a\npragmatic form of communism, in fact, since they were vast pools of wealth\ncollectively owned and collectively managed: the center of vast projects of\nhuman cooperation, which were assumed to be similarly eternal. Yet at the same\ntime—here I think Gernet is right—this communism became the basis, in turn, of\nsomething very much like capitalism. The reason was, above all, the need for\nconstant expansion. Everything—even charity—was an opportunity to proselytize;\nthe Dharma had to grow, ultimately, to encompass everyone and everything, in\norder to effect the salvation of all living beings.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe Middle Ages were marked by a general move toward abstraction: real gold\nand silver ended up largely in churches, monasteries, and temples, money\nbecame virtual again, and at the same time, the tendency everywhere was to set\nup overarching moral institutions meant to regulate the process and, in\nparticular, to establish certain protections for debtors.\n\nChina was unusual in that it was one place where an Axial Age empire managed\nto survive—though at first, only barely. Chinese governments did manage to\nkeep coins in circulation in most places most of the time. This was made\neasier by their reliance exclusively on small-denomination coins made of\nbronze. Even so, it clearly took enormous efforts.\n\nAs usual, we don’t know a lot about how everyday economic transactions took\nplace, but what we do know suggests that in small-scale transactions, coins\nwere probably most often used in dealing with strangers. As elsewhere, local\nshopkeepers and merchants extended credit. Most accounts seem to have been\nkept through the use of tally sticks, strikingly similar to those used in\nEngland, except that rather than hazelwood they were usually made of a split\npiece of notched bamboo. Here, too, the creditor took one half, and the debtor\nheld the other; they were joined at the moment of repayment, and often broken\nafterward to mark the cancellation of the\ndebt.[48](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts048) To what degree were\nthey transferable? We don’t really know. Most of what we do know is from\ncasual references in texts that are mainly about something else: anecdotes,\njokes, and poetic allusions. The great collection of Taoist wisdom, the\n_Leizi_ , probably written during the Han dynasty, contains one such:\n\nThere was a man of Sung who was strolling in the street and picked up a half\ntally someone had lost. He took it home and stored it away, and secretly\ncounted the indentations of the broken edge. He told a neighbor: “I shall be\nrich any day now.”[49](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts049)\n\nRather like someone who finds a key and figures “just as soon as I can figure\nout which lock …”[50](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts050) Another\nstory tells of how Liu Bang, a bibulous local constable and future founder of\nthe Han dynasty, used to go on all-night drinking binges, running up enormous\ntabs. Once, while he lay collapsed in a drunken stupor in a wine-shop, the\nowner saw a dragon hovering over his head—a sure sign of future greatness—and\nimmediately “broke the tally,” forgiving him his accumulated drinking\ndebts.[51](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts051)\n\nTallies weren’t just used for loans, but for any sort of contract—which is why\nearly paper contracts also had to be cut in half and one half kept by each\nparty.[52](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts052) With paper\ncontracts, there was a definite tendency for the creditor’s half to function\nas an IOU and thus become transferable. By 806 ad, for instance, right around\nthe apogee of Chinese Buddhism, merchants moving tea over long distances from\nthe far south of the country and officials transporting tax payments to the\ncapital, all of them concerned with the dangers of carrying bullion over long\ndistances, began to deposit their money with bankers in the capital and\ndevised a system of promissory notes. They were called “Flying Cash,” also\ndivided in half, like tallies, and redeemable for cash in their branches in\nthe provinces. They quickly started passing from hand to hand and operated\nsomething like currency. The government first tried to forbid their use, then\na year or two later—and this became a familiar pattern in China—when it\nrealized that it could not suppress them, switched gears and established a\nbureau empowered to issue such notes\nthemselves.[53](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts053)\n\nBy the early Song dynasty (960–1279 ad), local banking operations all over\nChina were running similar operations, accepting cash and bullion for\nsafekeeping and allowing depositors to use their receipts as promissory notes,\nas well as trading in government coupons for salt and tea. Many of these notes\ncame to circulate as de facto\nmoney.[54](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts054) The government, as\nusual, first tried to ban the practice, then control it (granting a monopoly\nto sixteen leading merchants), then, finally, set up a government monopoly—the\nBureau of Exchange Medium, established in 1023—and before long, aided by the\nnewly invented printing press, was operating factories in several cities\nemploying thousands of workers and producing literally millions of\nnotes.[55](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts055)\n\nAt first, this paper money was meant to circulate for a limited time (notes\nwould expire after two, then three, then seven years), and was redeemable in\nbullion. Over time, especially as the Song came under increasing military\npressure, the temptation to simply print money with little or no backup became\noverwhelming—and, moreover, Chinese governments were rarely completely willing\nto accept their own paper money for tax purposes. Combine this with the fact\nthat the bills were worthless outside China, and it’s rather surprising that\nthe system worked at all. Certainly, inflation was a constant problem and the\nmoney would have to be recalled and reissued. Occasionally the whole system\nwould break down, but then people would resort to their own expedients:\n“privately issued tea checks, noodle checks, bamboo tallies, wine tallies,\netc.”[56](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts056) Still, the Mongols,\nwho ruled China from 1271 to 1368 ad, chose to maintain the system, and it was\nonly abandoned in the seventeenth century.\n\nThis is important to note because the conventional account tends to represent\nChina’s experiment with paper money as a failure, even, for Metallists, proof\nthat “fiat money,” backed only by state power, will always eventually\ncollapse.[57](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts057) This is\nespecially odd, since the centuries when paper money was in use are usually\nconsidered the most economically dynamic in Chinese history. Surely, if the\nUnited States government was eventually forced to abandon the use of federal\nreserve notes in 2400 ad, no one would be arguing that this showed that the\nvery idea was always intrinsically unworkable. Nonetheless, the main point I’d\nlike to emphasize here is that terms like “fiat money,” however common, are\ndeceptive. Almost all of the new forms of paper money that emerged were not\noriginally created by governments at all; they were simply ways of recognizing\nand expanding the use of credit instruments that emerged from everyday\neconomic transactions. If it was only China that developed paper money in the\nMiddle Ages, this was largely because only in China was there a government\nlarge and powerful enough, but also, sufficiently suspicious of its mercantile\nclasses, to feel it had to take charge of such operations.\n\n## The Near West:\n\n### Islam (Capital as Credit)\n\n_Prices depend on the will of Allah; it is he who raises and lowers them_.\n\n—Attributed to the Prophet Mohammed\n\n_The profit of each partner must be in proportion to the share of each in the\nadventure_.\n\nIslamic legal precept\n\nFor most of the Middle Ages, the economic nerve center of the world economy\nand the source of its most dramatic financial innovations was neither China\nnor India, but the West, which, from the perspective of the rest of the world,\nmeant the world of Islam. During most of this period, Christendom, lodged in\nthe declining empire of Byzantium and the obscure semi-barbarous\nprincipalities of Europe, was largely insignificant.\n\nSince people who live in Western Europe have so long been in the habit of\nthinking of Islam as the very definition of “the East,” it’s easy to forget\nthat, from the perspective of any other great tradition, the difference\nbetween Christianity and Islam is almost negligible. One need only pick up a\nbook on, say, Medieval Islamic philosophy to discover disputes between the\nBaghdad Aristoteleans and the neo-Pythagoreans in Basra, or Persian Neo-\nPlatonists—essentially, scholars doing the same work of trying to square the\nrevealed religion tradition beginning with Abraham and Moses with the\ncategories of Greek philosophy, and doing so in a larger context of mercantile\ncapitalism, universalistic missionary religion, scientific rationalism, poetic\ncelebrations of romantic love, and periodic waves of fascination with mystical\nwisdom from the East.\n\nFrom a world-historical perspective, it seems much more sensible to see\nJudaism, Christianity, and Islam as three different manifestations of the same\ngreat Western intellectual tradition, which for most of human history has\ncentered on Mesopotamia and the Levant, extending into Europe as far as Greece\nand into Africa as far as Egypt, and sometimes farther west across the\nMediterranean or down the Nile. Economically, most of Europe was until perhaps\nthe High Middle Ages in exactly the same situation as most of Africa: plugged\ninto the larger world economy, if at all, largely as an exporter of slaves,\nraw materials, and the occasional exotica (amber, elephant tusks …), and\nimporter of manufactured goods (Chinese silks and porcelain, Indian calicoes,\nArab steel). To get a sense of comparative economic development (even if the\nexamples are somewhat scattered over time), consider the following\ntable:[58](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts058)\n\nPopulations and Tax Revenue, 350 BC–1200 AD\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_005_r1.jpg)\n\nWhat’s more, for most of the Middle Ages, Islam was not only the core of\nWestern civilization; it was its expansive edge, working its way into India,\nexpanding in Africa and Europe, sending missionaries and winning converts\nacross the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe prevailing Islamic attitude toward law, government, and economic matters\nwas the exact opposite of that prevalent in China. Confucians were suspicious\nof governance through strict codes of law, preferring to rely on the inherent\nsense of justice of the cultivated scholar—a scholar who was simply assumed to\nalso be a government official. Medieval Islam, on the other hand,\nenthusiastically embraced law, which was seen as a religious institution\nderived from the Prophet, but tended to view government, more often than not,\nas an unfortunate necessity, an institution that the truly pious would do\nbetter to avoid.[59](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts059)\n\nIn part this was because of the peculiar nature of Islamic government. The\nArab military leaders who, after Mohammed’s death in 632 ad, conquered the\nSassanian empire and established the Abbasid Caliphate, always continued to\nsee themselves as people of the desert, and never felt entirely part of the\nurban civilizations they had come to rule. This discomfort was never quite\novercome—on either side. It took the bulk of the population several centuries\nto convert to the conqueror’s religion, and even when they did, they never\nseem to have really identified with their rulers. Government was seen as\nmilitary power—necessary, perhaps, defend the faith, but fundamentally\nexterior to society.\n\nIn part, too, it was because of the peculiar alliance between merchants and\ncommon folk that came to be aligned against them. After Caliph al-Ma’mum’s\nabortive attempt to set up a theocracy in 832 ad, the government took a hands-\noff position on questions of religion. The various schools of Islamic law were\nfree to create their own educational institutions and maintain their own\nseparate system of religious justice. Crucially, it was the _ulema_ , the\nlegal scholars, who were the principal agents in the conversion of the bulk of\nthe empire’s population to Islam in Mesopotamia, Syria, Egypt, and North\nAfrica in those same\nyears.[60](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts060) But—like the elders\nin charge of guilds, civic associations, commercial sodalities, and religious\nbrotherhoods—they did their best to keep the government, with its armies and\nostentation, at arm’s\nlength.[61](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts061) “The best princes\nare those who visit religious teachers,” one proverb put it, “the worst\nreligious teachers are the those who allow themselves to be visited by\nprinces.”[62](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts062) A Medieval\nTurkish story brings it home even more pointedly:\n\nThe king once summoned Nasruddin to court.\n\n“Tell me,” said the king, “you are a mystic, a philosopher, a man of\nunconventional understandings. I have become interested in the issue of value.\nIt’s an interesting philosophical question. How does one establish the true\nworth of a person, or an object? Take me for example. If I were to ask you to\nestimate my value, what would you say?”\n\n“Oh,” Nasruddin said, “I’d say about two hundred dinars.”\n\nThe emperor was flabbergasted. “What?! But this belt I’m wearing is worth two\nhundred dinars!”\n\n“I know,” said Nasruddin. “Actually, I was taking the value of the belt into\nconsideration.”\n\nThis disjuncture had profound economic effects. It meant that the Caliphate,\nand later Muslim empires, could operate in many ways much like the old Axial\nAge empires—creating professional armies, waging wars of conquest, capturing\nslaves, melting down loot and distributing it in the form of coins to soldiers\nand officials, demanding that those coins be rendered back as taxes—but at the\nsame time, without having nearly the same effects on ordinary people’s lives.\n\nOver the course of the wars of expansion, for example, enormous quantities of\ngold and silver were indeed looted from palaces, temples, and monasteries and\nstamped into coinage, allowing the Caliphate to produce gold dinars and silver\ndirhams of remarkable purity—that is, with next to no fiduciary element, the\nvalue of each coin corresponding almost precisely to its weight in precious\nmetal.[63](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts063) As a result, they\nwere able to pay their troops extraordinarily well. A soldier in the Caliph’s\narmy, for example, received almost four times the wages once received by a\nRoman legionary.[64](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts064) We can,\nperhaps, speak of a kind of “military-coinage-slavery” complex here—but it\nexisted in a kind of bubble. Wars of expansion, and trade with Europe and\nAfrica, did produce a fairly constant flow of slaves, but in dramatic contrast\nto the ancient world, very few of them ended up laboring in farms or\nworkshops. Most ended up as decoration in the houses of the rich, or,\nincreasingly over time, as soldiers. Over the course of the Abbasid dynasty\n(750–1258 ad) in fact, the empire came to rely, for its military forces,\nalmost exclusively on Mamluks, highly trained military slaves captured or\npurchased from the Turkish steppes. The policy of employing slaves as soldiers\nwas maintained by all of the Islamic successor states, including the Mughals,\nand culminated in the famous Mamluk sultanate in Egypt in the thirteenth\ncentury, but historically, it was\nunprecedented.[65](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts065) In most\ntimes and places slaves are, for obvious reasons, the very last people to be\nallowed anywhere near weapons. Here it was systematic. But in a strange way,\nit also made perfect sense: if slaves are, by definition, people who have been\nsevered from society, this was the logical consequence of the wall created\nbetween society and the Medieval Islamic\nstate.[66](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts066)\n\nReligious teachers appear to have done everything they could to prop up the\nwall. One reason for the recourse to slave soldiers was their tendency to\ndiscourage the faithful from serving in the military (since it might mean\nfighting fellow believers). The legal system that they created also ensured\nthat it was effectively impossible for Muslims—or for that matter Christian or\nJewish subjects of the Caliphate—to be reduced to slavery. Here al-Wahid seems\nto have been largely correct. Islamic law took aim at just about all the most\nnotorious abuses of earlier, Axial Age societies. Slavery through kidnapping,\njudicial punishment, debt, and the exposure or sale of children, even through\nthe voluntary sale of one’s own person—all were forbidden, or rendered\nunenforceable.[67](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts067) Likewise\nwith all the other forms of debt peonage that had loomed over the heads of\npoor Middle Eastern farmers and their families since the dawn of recorded\nhistory. Finally, Islam strictly forbade usury, which it interpreted to mean\nany arrangement in which money or a commodity was lent at interest, for any\npurpose whatsoever.[68](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts068)\n\nIn a way, one can see the establishment of Islamic courts as the ultimate\ntriumph of the patriarchal rebellion that had begun so many thousands of years\nbefore: of the ethos of the desert or the steppe, real or imagined, even as\nthe faithful did their best to keep the heavily armed descendants of actual\nnomads confined to their camps and palaces. It was made possible by a profound\nshift in class alliances. The great urban civilizations of the Middle East had\nalways been dominated by a de facto alliance between administrators and\nmerchants, both of whom kept the rest of the population either in debt peonage\nor in constant peril of falling into it. In converting to Islam, the\ncommercial classes, so long the arch-villains in the eyes of ordinary farmers\nand townsfolk, effectively agreed to change sides, abandon all their most\nhated practices, and become instead the leaders of a society that now defined\nitself against the state.\n\nIt was possible because from the beginning, Islam had a positive view toward\ncommerce. Mohammed himself had begun his adult life as a merchant; and no\nIslamic thinker ever treated the honest pursuit of profit as itself\nintrinsically immoral or inimical to faith. Neither did the prohibitions\nagainst usury—which for the most part were scrupulously enforced, even in the\ncase of commercial loans—in any sense mitigate against the growth of commerce,\nor even the development of complex credit\ninstruments.[69](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts069) To the\ncontrary, the early centuries of the Caliphate saw an immediate efflorescence\nin both.\n\nProfits were still possible because Islamic jurists were careful to allow for\ncertain service fees, and other considerations—notably, allowing goods bought\non credit to be priced slightly higher than those bought for cash—that ensured\nthat bankers and traders still had an incentive to provide credit\nservices.[70](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts070) Still, these\nincentives were never enough to allow banking to become a full-time\noccupation: instead, almost any merchant operating on a sufficiently large\nscale could be expected to combine banking with a host of other moneymaking\nactivities. As a result, credit instruments soon became so essential to trade\nthat almost anyone of prominence was expected to keep most of his or her\nwealth on deposit, and to make everyday transactions, not by counting out\ncoins, but by inkpot and paper. Promissory notes were called _sakk_ ,\n“checks”, or _ruq’a_ , “notes.” Checks could bounce. One German historian,\npicking through a multitude of old Arabic literary sources, recounts that:\n\nAbout 900 a great man paid a poet in this way, only the banker refused the\ncheck, so that the disappointed poet composed a verse to the effect that he\nwould gladly pay a million on the same plan. A patron of the same poet and\nsinger (936) during a concert wrote a check in his favor on a banker for five\nhundred dinars. When paying, the banker gave the poet to understand that it\nwas customary to charge one dirham discount on each dinar, i.e., about ten per\ncent. Only if the poet would spend the afternoon and evening with him, he\nwould make no deduction …\n\nBy about 1000 the banker had made himself indispensable in Basra: every trader\nhad his banking account, and paid only in checks on his bank in the\nbazaar.…[71](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts071)\n\nChecks could be countersigned and transferred, and letters of credit\n(_suftaja_) could travel across the Indian Ocean or the\nSahara.[72](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts072) If they did not\nturn into de facto paper money, it was because, since they operated completely\nindependent of the state (they could not be used to pay taxes, for instance),\ntheir value was based almost entirely on trust and\nreputation.[73](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts073) Appeal to the\nIslamic courts was generally voluntary or mediated by merchant guilds and\ncivic associations. In such a context, having a famous poet compose verses\nmaking fun of you for bouncing a check was probably the ultimate disaster.\n\nWhen it came to finance, instead of interest-bearing investments, the\npreferred approach was partnerships, where (often) one party would supply the\ncapital, the other carry out the enterprise. Instead of fixed return, the\ninvestor would receive a share of the profits. Even labor arrangements were\noften organized on a profit-sharing\nbasis.[74](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts074) In all such\nmatters, reputation was crucial—in fact, one lively debate in early commercial\nlaw was over the question of whether reputation could (like land, labor,\nmoney, or other resources) itself be considered a form of capital. It\nsometimes happened that merchants would form partnerships with no capital at\nall, but only their good names. This was called “partnership of good\nreputation.” As one legal scholar explained:\n\nAs for the credit partnership, it is also called the “partnership of the\npenniless” (_sharika al-mafalis_). It comes about when two people form a\npartnership without any capital in order to buy on credit and then sell. It is\ndesignated by this name partnership of good reputations because their capital\nconsists of their status and good reputations; for credit is extended only to\nhim who has a good reputation among\npeople.[75](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts075)\n\nSome legal scholars objected to the idea that such a contract could be\nconsidered legally binding, since it was not based on an initial outlay of\nmaterial capital; others considered it legitimate, provided the partners make\nan equitable partition of the profits—since reputation cannot be quantified.\nThe remarkable thing here is the tacit recognition that, in a credit economy\nthat operates largely without state mechanisms of enforcement (without police\nto arrest those who commit fraud, or bailiffs to seize a debtor’s property), a\nsignificant part of the value of a promissory note is indeed the good name of\nthe signatory. As Pierre Bourdieu was later to point out in describing a\nsimilar economy of trust in contemporary Algeria: it’s quite possible to turn\nhonor into money, almost impossible to convert money into\nhonor.[76](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts076)\n\nThese networks of trust, in turn, were largely responsible for the spread of\nIslam over the caravan routes of Central Asia and the Sahara, and especially\nacross the Indian Ocean, the main conduit of Medieval world trade. Over the\ncourse of the Middle Ages, the Indian Ocean effectively became a Muslim lake.\nMuslim traders appear to have played a key role in establishing the principle\nthat kings and their armies should keep their quarrels on dry land; the seas\nwere to be a zone of peaceful commerce. At the same time, Islam gained a\ntoehold in trade emporia from Aden to the Moluccas because Islamic courts were\nso perfectly suited to provide those functions that made such ports\nattractive: means of establishing contracts, recovering debts, creating a\nbanking sector capable of redeeming or transferring letters of\ncredit.[77](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts077) The level of trust\nthereby created between merchants in the great Malay entrepôt Malacca, gateway\nto the spice islands of Indonesia, was legendary. The city had Swahili, Arab,\nEgyptian, Ethiopian, and Armenian quarters, as well as quarters for merchants\nfrom different regions of India, China, and Southeast Asia. Yet it was said\nthat its merchants shunned enforceable contracts, preferring to seal\ntransactions “with a handshake and a glance at\nheaven.”[78](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts078)\n\nIn Islamic society, the merchant became not just a respected figure, but a\nkind of paragon: like the warrior, a man of honor able to pursue far-flung\nadventures; unlike him, able to do so in a fashion damaging to no one. The\nFrench historian Maurice Lombard draws a striking, if perhaps rather\nidealized, picture of him “in his stately town-house, surrounded by slaves and\nhangers-on, in the midst of his collections of books, travel souvenirs, and\nrare ornaments,” along with his ledgers, correspondence, and letters of\ncredit, skilled in the arts of double-entry book-keeping along with secret\ncodes and ciphers, giving alms to the poor, supporting places of worship,\nperhaps, dedicating himself to the writing of poetry, while still able to\ntranslate his general creditworthiness into great capital reserves by\nappealing to family and\npartners.[79](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts079) Lombard’s\npicture is to some degree inspired by the famous _Thousand and One Nights_\ndescription of Sindbad, who, having spent his youth in perilous mercantile\nventures to faraway lands, finally retired, rich beyond dreams, to spend the\nrest of his life amidst gardens and dancing girls, telling tall tales of his\nadventures. Here’s a glimpse, from the eyes of a humble porter (also named\nSindbad) when first summoned to see him by the master’s page:\n\nHe found it to be a goodly mansion, radiant and full of majesty, till he\nbrought him to a grand sitting room wherein he saw a company of nobles and\ngreat lords seated at tables garnished with all manner of flowers and sweet-\nscented herbs, besides great plenty of dainty viands and fruits dried and\nfresh and confections and wines of the choicest vintages. There also were\ninstruments of music and mirth and lovely slave girls playing and singing. All\nthe company was ranged according to rank, and in the highest place sat a man\nof worshipful and noble aspect whose bearded sides hoariness had stricken, and\nhe was stately of stature and fair of favor, agreeable of aspect and full of\ngravity and dignity and majesty. So Sindbad the Porter was confounded at that\nwhich he beheld and said in himself, “By Allah, this must be either some\nking’s palace, or a piece of\nParadise!”[80](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts080)\n\nIt’s worth quoting not only because it represents a certain ideal, a picture\nof the perfect life, but because there’s no real Christian parallel. It would\nbe impossible conceive of such an image appearing in, say, a Medieval French\nromance.\n\nThe veneration of the merchant was matched by what can only be called the\nworld’s first popular free-market ideology. True, one should be careful not to\nconfuse ideals with reality. Markets were ever entirely independent from the\ngovernment. Islamic regimes did employ all the usual strategies of\nmanipulating tax policy to encourage the growth of markets, and they\nperiodically tried to intervene in commercial\nlaw.[81](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts081) Still, there was a\nvery strong popular feeling that they shouldn’t. Once freed from its ancient\nscourges of debt and slavery, the local bazaar had become, for most, not a\nplace of moral danger, but the very opposite: the highest expression of the\nhuman freedom and communal solidarity, and thus to be protected assiduously\nfrom state intrusion.\n\nThere was a particular hostility to anything that smacked of price-fixing. One\nmuch-repeated story held that the Prophet himself had refused to force\nmerchants to lower prices during a shortage in the city of Medina, on the\ngrounds that doing so would be sacrilegious, since, in a free-market\nsituation, “prices depend on the will of\nGod.”[82](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts082) Most legal scholars\ninterpreted Mohammed’s decision to mean that any government interference in\nmarket mechanisms should be considered similarly sacrilegious, since markets\nwere designed by God to regulate\nthemselves.[83](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts083)\n\nIf all this bears a striking resemblance to Adam Smith’s “invisible hand”\n(which was also the hand of Divine Providence), it might not be a complete\ncoincidence. In fact, many of the specific arguments and examples that Smith\nuses appear to trace back directly to economic tracts written in Medieval\nPersia. For instance, not only does his argument that exchange is a natural\noutgrowth of human rationality and speech already appear both in both Ghazali\n(1058–1111 ad), and Tusi (1201–1274 ad); both use exactly the same\nillustration: that no one has ever observed two dogs exchanging\nbones.[84](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts084) Even more\ndramatically, Smith’s most famous example of division of labor, the pin\nfactory, where it takes eighteen separate operations to produce one pin,\nalready appears in Ghazali’s _Ihya_ , in which he describes a needle factory,\nwhere it takes twenty-five different operations to produce a\nneedle.[85](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts085)\n\nThe differences, however, are just as significant as the similarities. One\ntelling example: like Smith, Tusi begins his treatise on economics with a\ndiscussion of the division of labor; but where for Smith, the division of\nlabor is actually an outgrowth of our “natural propensity to truck and barter”\nin pursuit of individual advantage, for Tusi, it was an extension of mutual\naid:\n\nLet us suppose that each individual were required to busy himself with\nproviding his own sustenance, clothing, dwelling-place and weapons, first\nacquiring the tools of carpentry and the smith’s trade, then readying thereby\ntools and implements for sowing and reaping, grinding and kneading, spinning\nand weaving … Clearly, he would not be capable of doing justice to any one of\nthem. But when men render aid to each other, each one performing one of these\nimportant tasks that are beyond the measure of his own capacity, and observing\nthe law of justice in transactions by giving greatly and receiving in exchange\nof the labor of others, then the means of livelihood are realized, and the\nsuccession of the individual and the survival of the species are\nassured.[86](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts086)\n\nAs a result, he argues, divine providence has arranged us to have different\nabilities, desires, and inclinations. The market is simply one manifestation\nof this more general principle of mutual aid, of the matching of, abilities\n(supply) and needs (demand)—or to translate it into my own earlier terms, it\nis not only founded on, but is itself an extension of the kind of baseline\ncommunism on which any society must ultimately rest.\n\nAll this is not to say that Tusi was in any sense a radical egalitarian. Quite\nthe contrary. “If men were equal,” he insists, “they would all perish.” We\nneed differences between rich and poor, he insisted, just as much as we need\ndifferences between farmers and carpenters. Still, once you start from the\ninitial premise that markets are primarily about cooperation rather than\ncompetition—and while Muslim economic thinkers did recognize and accept the\nneed for market competition, they never saw competition as its\nessence[87](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts087)—the moral\nimplications are very different. Nasruddin’s story about the quail eggs might\nhave been a joke, but Muslim ethicists did often enjoin merchants to drive a\nhard bargain with the rich so they could charge less, or pay more, when\ndealing with the less\nfortunate.[88](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts088)\n\nGhazali’s take on the division of labor is similar, and his account of the\norigins of money is if anything even more revealing. It begins with what looks\nmuch like the myth of barter, except that, like all Middle Eastern writers, he\nstarts not with imaginary primitive tribesmen, but with strangers meeting in\nan imaginary marketplace.\n\nSometimes a person needs what he does not own and he owns what he does not\nneed. For example, a person has saffron but needs a camel for transportation\nand one who owns a camel does not presently need that camel but he wants\nsaffron. Thus, there is the need for an exchange. However, for there to be an\nexchange, there must be a way to measure the two objects, for the camel-owner\ncannot give the whole camel for a quantity of saffron. There is no similarity\nbetween saffron and camel so that equal amount of that weight and form can be\ngiven. Likewise is the case of one who desires a house but owns some cloth or\ndesires a slave but owns socks, or desires flour but possesses a donkey. These\ngoods have no direct proportionality so one cannot know how much saffron will\nequal a camel’s worth. Such barter transactions would be very\ndifficult.[89](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts089)\n\nGhazali also notes that there might also be a problem of one person not even\nneeding what the other has to offer, but this is almost an afterthought; for\nhim, the real problem is conceptual. How do you compare two things with no\ncommon qualities? His conclusion: it can only be done by comparing both to a\nthird thing with no qualities at all. For this reason, he explains, God\ncreated dinars and dirhams, coins made out of gold and silver, two metals that\nare otherwise no good for anything:\n\n_Dirhams_ and _dinars_ are not created for any particular purpose; they are\nuseless by themselves; they are just like stones. They are created to\ncirculate from hand to hand, to govern and to facilitate transactions. They\nare symbols to know the value and grades of\ngoods.[90](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts090)\n\nThey can be symbols, units of measure, because of this very lack of\nusefulness, indeed lack of any particular feature other than value:\n\nA thing can only be exactly linked to other things if it has no particular\nspecial form or feature of its own—for example, a mirror that has no color can\nreflect all colors. The same is the case with money—it has no purpose of its\nown, but it serves as medium for the purpose of exchanging\ngoods.[91](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts091)\n\nFrom this it also follows that lending money at interest must be illegitimate,\nsince it means using money as an end in itself: “Money is not created to earn\nmoney.” In fact, he says, “in relation to other goods, _dirhams_ and _dinars_\nare like prepositions in a sentence,” words that, as the grammarians inform\nus, are used to give meaning to other words, but can only do because they have\nno meaning in themselves. Money is a thus a unit of measure that provides a\nmeans of assessing the value of goods, but also one that operates as such only\nif it stays in constant motion. To enter in monetary transactions in order to\nobtain even more money, even if it’s a matter of M-C-M’, let alone M-M’, would\nbe, according to Ghazali, the equivalent of kidnapping a\npostman.[92](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts092)\n\nWhereas Ghazali speaks only of gold and silver, what he describes—money as\nsymbol, as abstract measure, having no qualities of its own, whose value is\nonly maintained by constant motion—is something that would never have occurred\nto anyone were it not in an age when it was perfectly normal for money to be\nemployed in purely virtual form.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nMuch of our free-market doctrine, then, appears to have been originally\nborrowed piecemeal from a very different social and moral\nuniverse.[93](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts093) The mercantile\nclasses of the Medieval Near West had pulled off an extraordinary feat. By\nabandoning the usurious practices that had made them so obnoxious to their\nneighbors for untold centuries before, they were able to become—alongside\nreligious teachers—the effective leaders of their communities: communities\nthat are still seen as organized, to a large extent, around the twin poles of\nmosque and bazaar.[94](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts094) The\nspread of Islam allowed the market to become a global phenomenon, operating\nlargely independent of governments, according to its own internal laws. But\nthe very fact that this was, in a certain way, a genuine free market, not one\ncreated by the government and backed by its police and prisons—a world of\nhandshake deals and paper promises backed only by the integrity of the\nsigner—meant that it could never really become the world imagined by those who\nlater adopted many of the same ideas and arguments: one of purely self-\ninterested individuals vying for material advantage by any means at hand.\n\n## The Far West:\n\n### Christendom (Commerce, Lending, and War)\n\n_Where there is justice in war, there is also justice in usury_.\n\n—Saint Ambrose\n\nEurope, as I mentioned, came rather late to the Middle Ages and for most of it\nwas something of a hinterland. Still, the period began much as it did\nelsewhere, with the disappearance of coinage. Money retreated into virtuality.\nEveryone continued to calculate costs in Roman currency, then, later, in\nCarolingian “imaginary money”—the purely conceptual system of pounds,\nshillings, and pence used across Western Europe to keep accounts well into the\nseventeenth century.\n\nLocal mints did gradually come back into operation, producing coins in an\nendless variety of weight, purity, and denominations. How these related to the\npan-European system, though, was a matter of manipulation. Kings regularly\nissued decrees revaluing their own coins in relation to the money of account,\n“crying up” the currency by, say, declaring that henceforth, one of their\n_ecus_ or _escudos_ would no longer be worth 1/12 but now 1/8 of a shilling\n(thus effectively raising taxes) or “crying down” the value of their coins by\ndoing the reverse (thus effectively reducing their\ndebts).[95](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts095) The real gold or\nsilver content of coins was endlessly readjusted, and currencies were\nfrequently called in for re-minting. Meanwhile, most everyday transactions\ndispensed with cash entirely, operating through tallies, tokens, ledgers, or\ntransactions in kind. As a result, when the Scholastics came to address such\nmatters in the thirteenth century, they quickly adopted Aristotle’s position\nthat money was a mere social convention: that it was, basically, whatever\nhuman beings decided that it\nwas.[96](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts096)\n\nAll this fit the broader Medieval pattern: actual gold and silver, such of it\nas was still around, was increasingly laid up in sacred places; as centralized\nstates disappeared, the regulation of markets was increasingly in the hands of\nthe Church.\n\nAt first, the Catholic attitudes toward usury were just as harsh as Muslim\nones, and attitudes toward merchants, considerably harsher. In the first case,\nthey had little choice, as many Biblical texts were quite explicit. Consider\nExodus 22:25:\n\nIf you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act as a\ncreditor to him; you shall not charge him interest.\n\nBoth the Psalms (15:5, 54:12) and Prophets (Jeremiah 9.6, Nehemiah 5:11) were\nexplicit in assigning usurers to death and hellfire. What’s more, the early\nChristian Fathers, who laid the foundation of Church teachings on social\nissues in the waning years of the Roman empire, were writing amidst the\nancient world’s last great debt crisis, one that was effectively in the\nprocess of destroying the empire’s remaining free\npeasantry.[97](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts097) While few were\nwilling to condemn slavery, all condemned usury.\n\nUsury was seen above all as an assault on Christian charity, on Jesus’s\ninjunction to treat the poor as they would treat the Christ himself, giving\nwithout expectation of return and allowing the borrower to decide on\nrecompense (Luke 6:34–35). In 365 ad, for instance, St. Basil delivered a\nsermon on usury in Cappadocia that set the standard for such issues:\n\nThe Lord gave His own injunction quite plainly in the words, “from him that\nwould borrow of thee turn not thou\naway.”[98](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts098)\n\nBut what of the money lover? He sees before him a man under stress of\nnecessity bent to the ground in supplication. He sees him hesitating at no\nact, no words, of humiliation. He sees him suffering undeserved misfortune,\nbut he is merciless. He does not reckon that he is a fellow-creature. He does\nnot give in to his entreaties. He stands stiff and sour. He is moved by no\nprayers; his resolution is broken by no tears. He persists in refusal\n…[99](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts099)\n\nThat is, until the suppliant mentions “interest.”\n\nBasil was particularly offended by the crass dishonesty by which moneylenders\noperated; their abuse of Christian fellowship. The man in need comes seeking a\nfriend, the rich man pretends to be one. In fact he’s a secret enemy, and\neverything he says is a lie. Witness, St. Basil said, how the rich man will\nalways at first swear mighty oaths that he has no money to his name:\n\nThen the suppliant mentions interest, and utters the word security. All is\nchanged. The frown is relaxed; with a genial smile he recalls old family\nconnection. Now it is “my friend.”\n\n“I will see,” says he, “if I have any money by me. Yes, there is that sum\nwhich a man I know has left in my hands on deposit for profit. He stipulated a\nvery heavy rate of interest. However, I shall certainly take something off,\nand give it to you on better terms.” With pretences of this kind and talk like\nthis he fawns on the wretched victim, and induces him to swallow the bait.\nThen he binds him with a written security, adds loss of liberty to the trouble\nof his pressing poverty, and is off. The man who has made himself responsible\nfor interest that he cannot pay has accepted voluntary slavery for\nlife.[100](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts100)\n\nThe borrower, coming home with his newfound money, at first rejoices. But\nquickly, “the money slips away,” interest accumulates, and his possessions are\nsold off. Basil grows poetic in describing the debtor’s plight. It’s as if\ntime itself has become his enemy. Every day and night conspires against him,\nas they are the parents of interest. His life becomes a “sleepless daze of\nanxious uncertainty,” as he is humiliated in public; while at home, he is\nconstantly hiding under the couch at every unexpected knock on the door, and\ncan barely sleep, startled awake by nightmare visions of his creditor standing\nover his pillow.[101](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts101)\n\nProbably the most famous ancient homily on usury, though, was Saint Ambrose’s\n_De Tobia_ , pronounced over several days in Milan in 380 bc. He reproduces\nthe same vivid details as Basil: fathers forced to sell their children,\ndebtors who hanged themselves out of shame. Usury, he observes, must be\nconsidered a form of violent robbery, even\nmurder.[102](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts102) Ambrose, though,\nadded one small proviso that was later to have enormous influence. His sermon\nwas the first to carefully examine every Biblical reference to moneylending,\nwhich meant that he had to address the one problem later authors always had to\nstruggle with—the fact that, in the Old Testament, usury is not quite\nforbidden to everyone. The key sticking point is always Deuteronomy 23:19–20:\n\nThou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of\nvictuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury.\n\nUnto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt\nnot lend upon usury.\n\nSo who then is this “stranger” or (a better translation of the Hebrew _nokri_\n, “foreigner”)? Presumably, one against whom robbery and murder would have\nbeen justified as well. After all, the ancient Jews lived amidst tribes like\nthe Amalekites, on whom God had specifically instructed them to make war. If\nby extracting interest one is, as he puts it, fighting without a sword, then\nit is only legitimate to do so from those “whom it would not be a crime to\nkill.”[103](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts103) For Ambrose,\nliving in Milan, all this was something of a technicality. He included all\nChristians and all those subject to Roman law as “brothers”; there weren’t,\nthen, lot of Amalekites\naround.[104](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts104) Later, the\n“Exception of St. Ambrose,” as it came to be known, was to become extremely\nimportant.\n\nAll of these sermons—and there were many of them—left certain critical\nquestions unanswered. What _should_ the rich man do when receiving a visit\nfrom his troubled neighbor? True, Jesus had said to give without expectation\nof return, but it seemed unrealistic to expect most Christians to do that. And\neven if they did, what sort of ongoing relationships would that create? St.\nBasil took the radical position. God had given us all things in common, and he\nhad specifically instructed the rich to give their possessions to the poor.\nThe communism of the Apostles—who pooled all their wealth, and took freely\nwhat they needed—was thus the only proper model for a truly Christian\nsociety.[105](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts105) Few of the other\nChristian Fathers were willing to take things this far. Communism was the\nideal, but in this fallen and temporary world, they argued, it was simply\nunrealistic. The Church must accept existing property arrangements, but also\ncome up with spiritual arguments to encourage the rich to nonetheless act with\nChristian charity. Many of these employed distinctly commercial metaphors.\nEven Basil was willing to indulge in this sort of thing:\n\nWhenever you provide for the destitute on account of the Lord, it is both a\ngift and a loan. It is a gift because you entertain no hope in recovering it,\na loan because of our Lord’s munificence in paying you back on his behalf,\nwhen, having taken a small sum for the poor, he will give you back a vast sum\nin return. “For he who takes pity on the poor, lends to\nGod.”[106](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts106)\n\nSince Christ is in the poor, a gift of charity is a loan to Jesus, to be\nrepaid with interest inconceivable on earth.\n\nCharity, however, is a way of maintaining hierarchy, not undermining it. What\nBasil is talking about here really has nothing to do with debt, and playing\nwith such metaphors seems ultimately to serve only to underline the fact that\nthe rich man doesn’t _owe_ the poor suppliant anything, any more than God is\nin any way legally bound to save the soul of anyone who feeds a beggar. “Debt”\nhere dissolves into a pure hierarchy (hence, “the Lord”) where utterly\ndifferent beings provide each other utterly different kinds of benefit. Later\ntheologians were to explicitly confirm this: human beings live in time, noted\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, so it makes sense to say that sin is a debt of punishment\nwe owe to God. But God lives outside of time. By definition, he cannot owe\nanything to anyone. His grace can therefore only be a gift given with no\nobligation.[107](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts107)\n\nThis, in turn, provides an answer to the question: What are they really asking\nthe rich man to do? The Church opposed usury, but it had little to say about\nrelations of feudal dependency, where the rich man provides charity and the\npoor suppliant shows his gratitude in other ways. Neither, when these kinds of\narrangements began to emerge across the Christian West, did the Church offer\nsignificant objections.[108](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts108)\nFormer debt peons were gradually transformed into serfs or vassals. In some\nways, the relationship was not much different, since vassalage was, in theory,\na voluntary, contractual relationship. Just as a Christian has to be able to\nfreely choose to submit himself to “the Lord,” so did a vassal have to agree\nto make himself someone else’s man. All this proved perfectly consonant with\nChristianity.\n\nCommerce, on the other hand, remained a problem. There was not much of a leap\nbetween condemning usury as the taking of “whatever exceeds the amount loaned”\nand condemning any form of profit-taking. Many—Saint Ambrose among them—were\nwilling to take that leap. Where Mohammed declared that an honest merchant\ndeserved a place by the seat of God in heaven, men like Ambrose wondered if an\n“honest merchant” could actually exist. Many held that one simply could not be\nboth a merchant and a\nChristian.[109](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts109) In the early\nMiddle Ages, this was not a pressing issue—especially since so much commerce\nwas conducted by foreigners. The conceptual problems, however, were never\nresolved. What did it mean that one could only lend to “strangers”? Was it\njust usury, or was even commerce tantamount to war?\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nProbably the most notorious, and often catastrophic, way that this problem\nworked itself out in the High Middle Ages was in relations between Christians\nand Jews. In the years since Nehemiah, Jewish attitudes toward lending had\nthemselves changed. In the time of Augustus, Rabbi Hillel had effectively\nrendered the sabbatical year a dead letter, by allowing two parties to place a\nrider on any particular loan contract agreeing that it would not apply. While\nboth the Torah and the Talmud stand opposed to loans on interest, exceptions\nwere made in dealing with Gentiles—particularly as, over the course of the\neleventh and twelfth centuries, European Jews were excluded from almost any\nother line of work.[110](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts110) This\nin turn made it harder to contain the practice, as witnessed in the common\njoke, current in twelfth-century ghettos to justify usury between Jews. It\nconsisted, it is said, of reciting Deuteronomy 23:20 in interrogative tones to\nmake it mean the opposite of its obvious sense: ‘Unto a foreigner thou mayest\nlend upon usury, but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon\nusury?’[111](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts111)\n\nOn the Christian side, in 1140 ad the “Exception of Saint Ambrose” found its\nway into Gratian’s _Decretum_ , which came to be considered the definitive\ncollection of canon law. At the time, economic life fell very much under the\njurisdiction of the Church. While that might appear to leave Jews safely\noutside the system, in reality, matters were more complicated. For one thing,\nwhile both Jews and Gentiles would occasionally attempt to make recourse to\nthe Exception, the prevailing opinion was that it only really applied to\nSaracens or others with whom Christendom was literally at war. After all, Jews\nand Christians lived in the same towns and villages. If one were to concede\nthat the Exception allowed Jews and Christians the right to lend to each other\nat interest, it would also mean that they had the right to murder one\nanother.[112](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts112) No one really\nwanted to say that. On the other hand, real relations between Christians and\nJews often did seem to skate perilously close to this unfortunate ideal—though\nobviously the actual murder (apart from mere economic aggression) was all on\none side.\n\nIn part this was due to the habit of Christian princes of exploiting, for\ntheir own purposes, the fact that Jews did sit slightly outside the system.\nMany encouraged Jews to operate as moneylenders, under their protection,\nsimply because they also knew that protection could be withdrawn at any time.\nThe kings of England were notorious in this regard. They insisted that Jews be\nexcluded from merchant and craft guilds, but granted them the right to charge\nextravagant rates of interest, backing up the loans by the full force of\nlaw.[113](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts113) Debtors in Medieval\nEngland were regularly thrown in prisons until their families settled with the\ncreditor.[114](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts114) Yet the same\nregularly happened to the Jews themselves. In 1210 ad, for example, King John\nordered a tallage, or emergency levy, to pay for his wars in France and\nIreland. According to one contemporary chronicler “all the Jews throughout\nEngland, of both sexes, were seized, imprisoned, and tortured severely, in\norder to do the king’s will with their money.” Most who where put to torture\noffered all they had and more—but on that occasion, one particularly wealthy\nmerchant, a certain Abraham of Bristol, who the king decided owed him ten\nthousand marks of silver (a sum equivalent to about a sixth of John’s total\nannual revenue), became famous for holding out. The king therefore ordered\nthat one of his molars be pulled out daily, until he paid. After seven had\nbeen extracted, Abraham finally gave\nin.[115](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts115)\n\nJohn’s successor, Henry III (1216–1272 ad), was in the habit of turning over\nJewish victims to his brother the Earl of Cornwall, so that, as another\nchronicler put it, “those whom one brother had flayed, the other might\nembowel.”[116](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts116) Such stories\nabout the extraction of Jewish teeth, skin, and intestines are, I think,\nimportant to bear in mind when thinking about Shakespeare’s imaginary Merchant\nof Venice demanding his “pound of\nflesh.”[117](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts117) It all seems to\nhave been a bit of a guilty projection of terrors that Jews had never really\nvisited on Christians, but that had been directed the other way around.\n\nThe terror inflicted by kings carried in it a peculiar element of\nidentification: the persecutions and appropriations were an extension of the\nlogic whereby kings effectively treated debts owed to Jews as ultimately owed\nto themselves, even setting up a branch of the Treasury (“the Exchequer of the\nJews”) to manage them.[118](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts118)\nThis was of course much in keeping with the popular English impression of\ntheir kings as themselves a group of rapacious Norman foreigners. But it also\ngave the kings the opportunity to periodically play the populist card,\ndramatically snubbing or humiliating their Jewish financiers, turning a blind\neye or even encouraging pogroms by townsfolk who chose to take the Exception\nof Saint Ambrose literally, and treat moneylenders as enemies of Christ who\ncould be murdered in cold blood. Particularly gruesome massacres occurred in\nNorwich in 1144 ad, and in France, in Blois in 1171. Before long, as Norman\nCohn put it, “what had once been a flourishing Jewish culture had turned into\na terrorized society locked in perpetual warfare with the greater society\naround it.”[119](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts119)\n\nOne mustn’t exaggerate the Jewish role in lending. Most Jews had nothing to do\nwith the business, and those who did were typically bit players, making minor\nloans of grain or cloth for a return in kind. Others weren’t even really Jews.\nAlready in the 1190s, preachers were complaining about lords who would work\nhand in glove with Christian moneylenders claiming they were “our Jews”—and\nthus under their special\nprotection.[120](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts120) By the 1100s,\nmost Jewish moneylenders had long since been displaced by Lombards (from\nNorthern Italy) and Cahorsins (from the French town of Cahors)—who established\nthemselves across Western Europe, and became notorious rural\nusurers.[121](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts121)\n\nThe rise of rural usury was itself a sign of a growing free peasantry (there\nhad been no point in making loans to serfs, since they had nothing to\nrepossess). It accompanied the rise of commercial farming, urban craft guilds,\nand the “commercial revolution” of the High Middle Ages, all of which finally\nbrought Western Europe to a level of economic activity comparable to that long\nsince considered normal in other parts of the world. The Church quickly came\nunder considerable popular pressure to do something about the problem, and at\nfirst, it did try to tighten the clamps. Existing loopholes in the usury laws\nwere systematically closed, particularly the use of mortgages. These latter\nbegan as an expedient: as in Medieval Islam, those determined to dodge the law\ncould simply present the money, claim to be buying the debtor’s house or\nfield, and then “rent” it back to the debtor until the principal was repaid.\nIn the case of a mortgage, the house was in theory not even purchased but\npledged as security, but any income from it accrued to the lender. In the\neleventh century this became a favorite trick of monasteries. In 1148 it was\nmade illegal: henceforth, all income was to be subtracted from the principal.\nSimilarly, in 1187 merchants were forbidden to charge higher prices when\nselling on credit—the Church thereby going much further than any school of\nIslamic law ever had. In 1179 usury was made a mortal sin and usurers were\nexcommunicated and denied Christian\nburial.[122](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts122) Before long, new\norders of itinerant friars like the Franciscans and Dominicans organized\npreaching campaigns, traveling town to town, village to village, threatening\nmoneylenders with the loss of their eternal souls if they did not make\nrestitution to their victims.\n\nAll this was echoed by a heady intellectual debate in the newly founded\nuniversities, not so much as to whether usury was sinful and illegal, but\nprecisely why. Some argued that it was theft of another’s material\npossessions; others that it constituted a theft of time, charging others for\nsomething that belonged only to God. Some held that it embodied the sin of\nSloth, since like the Confucians, Catholic thinkers usually held that a\nmerchant’s profit could only be justified as payment for his labor (i.e., in\ntransporting goods to wherever they were needed), whereas interest accrued\neven if the lender did nothing at all. Soon the rediscovery of Aristotle, who\nreturned in Arabic translation (and the influence of Muslim sources like\nGhazali and Ibn Sina), added new arguments: that treating money as an end in\nitself defied its true purpose; that charging interest was unnatural, in that\nit treated mere metal as if it were a living thing that could breed or bear\nfruit.[123](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts123)\n\nBut as the Church authorities soon discovered, when one starts something like\nthis, it’s very hard to keep a lid on it. Soon, new popular religious\nmovements were appearing everywhere, and many took up the same direction so\nmany had in late Antiquity, not only challenging commerce but questioning the\nvery legitimacy of private property. Most were labeled heresies and violently\nsuppressed, but many of the same arguments were taken up amongst the mendicant\norders themselves. By the thirteenth century, the great intellectual debate\nwas between the Franciscans and the Dominicans over “apostolic\npoverty”—basically, over whether Christianity could be reconciled with\nproperty of any sort.\n\nAt the same time, the revival of Roman law—which, as we’ve seen, began from\nthe assumption of absolute private property—put new intellectual weapons in\nthe hands of those who wished to argue that, at least in the case of\ncommercial loans, usury laws should be relaxed. The great discovery in this\ncase was the notion of _interesse_ , which is where our word “interest”\noriginally comes from: a compensation for loss suffered because of late\npayment.[124](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts124) The argument\nsoon became that if a merchant made a commercial loan even for some minimal\nperiod (say, a month), it was not usurious for him to charge a percentage for\neach month afterward, since this was a penalty, not rental for the money, and\nit was justified as compensation for the profit he _would_ have made, had he\nplaced it in some profitable investment, as any merchant would ordinarily be\nexpected to do.[125](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts125)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe reader may be wondering how it could have been possible for usury laws to\nmove in two opposite directions simultaneously. The answer would seem to be\nthat politically, the situation in Western Europe was remarkably chaotic. Most\nkings were weak, their holdings fractured and uncertain; the Continent was a\ncheckerboard of baronies, principalities, urban communes, manors, and church\nestates. Jurisdictions were constantly being renegotiated—usually by war.\nMerchant capitalism of the sort long familiar in the Muslim Near West only\nreally managed to establish itself—quite late, compared with the situation in\nthe rest of the Medieval world—when merchant capitalists managed to secure a\npolitical foothold in the independent city-states of northern Italy—most\nfamously, Venice, Florence, Genoa, and Milan—followed by the German cities of\nthe Hanseatic League.[126](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts126)\nItalian bankers ultimately managed to free themselves from the threat of\nexpropriation by themselves taking over governments, and by doing so,\nacquiring their own court systems (capable of enforcing contracts) and even\nmore critically, their own\narmies.[127](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts127)\n\nWhat jumps out, in comparison with the Muslim world, are these links of\nfinance, trade, and violence. Whereas Persian and Arab thinkers assumed that\nthe market emerged as an extension of mutual aid, Christians never completely\novercame the suspicion that commerce was really an extension of usury, a form\nof fraud only truly legitimate when directed against one’s mortal enemies.\nDebt was, indeed, sin—on the part of both parties to the transaction.\nCompetition was essential to the nature of the market, but competition was\n(usually) nonviolent warfare. There was a reason why, as I’ve already\nobserved, the words for “truck and barter” in almost all European languages\nwere derived from terms meaning “swindle,” “bamboozle,” or “deceive.” Some\ndisdained commerce for that reason. Others embraced it. Few would have denied\nthat the connection was there.\n\nOne need only examine the way that Islamic credit instruments—or for that\nmatter, the Islamic ideal of the merchant adventurer—were eventually adopted\nto see just how intimate this connection really was.\n\nIt is often held that the first pioneers of modern banking were the Military\nOrder of the Knights of the Temple of Solomon, commonly known as the Knights\nTemplar. A fighting order of monks, they played a key role in financing the\nCrusades. Through the Templars, a lord in southern France might take out a\nmortgage on one of his tenements and receive a “draft” (a bill of exchange,\nmodeled on the Muslim _suftaja_ , but written in a secret code) redeemable for\ncash from the Temple in Jerusalem. In other words, Christians appear to have\nfirst adopted Islamic financial techniques to finance attacks against Islam.\n\nThe Templars lasted from 1118 to 1307, but they finally went the way of so\nmany Medieval trading minorities: King Phillip IV, deep in debt to the order,\nturned on them, accusing them of unspeakable crimes; their leaders were\ntortured and ultimately killed, and their wealth was\nexpropriated.[128](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts128) Much of the\nproblem was that they lacked a powerful home base. Italian banking houses such\nas the Bardi, Peruzzi, and Medici did much better. In banking history, the\nItalians are most famous for their complex joint-stock organization and for\nspearheading the use of Islamic-style bills of\nexchange.[129](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts129) At first these\nwere simple enough: basically just a form of long-distance money-changing. A\nmerchant could present a certain amount in florins to a banker in Italy and\nreceive a notarized bill registering the equivalent in the international money\nof account (Carolingian derniers), due in, say, three months’ time, and then\nafter it came due, either he or his agent could cash it for an equivalent\namount of local currency in the Champagne fairs, which were both the great\nyearly commercial emporia, and great financial clearing houses, of the\nEuropean High Middle Ages. But they quickly morphed into a plethora of new,\ncreative forms, mainly a way of navigating—or even profiting from—the\nendlessly complicated European currency\nsituation.[130](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts130)\n\nMost of the capital for these banking enterprises derived from the\nMediterranean trade in Indian Ocean spices and Eastern luxuries. Yet unlike\nthe Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean was a constant war zone. Venetian galleys\ndoubled as both merchant vessels and warships, replete with cannon and\nmarines, and the differences between trade, crusade, and piracy often depended\non the balance of forces at any given\nmoment.[131](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts131) The same was true\non land: where Asian empires tended to separate the sphere of warriors and\nmerchants, in Europe they often overlapped:\n\nAll up and down Central Europe, from Tuscany to Flanders, from Brabant to\nLivonia, merchants not only supplied warriors—as they did all over Europe—they\nsat in governments that made war and, sometimes, buckled on armor and went\ninto battle themselves. Such places make a long list: not only Florence,\nMilan, Venice, and Genoa, but also Augsburg, Nuremberg, Strasbourg, and\nZurich; not only Lübeck, Hamburg, Bremen, and Danzig, but also Bruges, Ghent,\nLeiden, and Cologne. Some of them—Florence, Nuremberg, Siena, Bern, and Ulm\ncome to mind—built considerable territorial\nstates.[132](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts132)\n\nThe Venetians were only the most famous in this regard. They created a\nveritable mercantile empire over the course of the eleventh century, seizing\nislands like Crete and Cyprus and establishing sugar plantations that\neventually—anticipating a pattern eventually to become all too familiar in the\nNew World—came to be staffed largely by African\nslaves.[133](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts133) Genoa soon\nfollowed suit; one of their most lucrative businesses was raiding and trading\nalong the Black Sea to acquire slaves to sell to the Mamluks in Egypt or to\nwork mines leased from the\nTurks.[134](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts134) The Genoese\nrepublic was also the inventor of a unique mode of military financing, which\nmight be known as war by subscription, whereby those planning expeditions sold\nshares to investors in exchange for the rights to an equivalent percentage of\nthe spoils. It was precisely the same galleys, with the same “merchant\nadventurers” aboard, who would eventually pass through the pillars of Hercules\nto follow the Atlantic coast to Flanders or the Champagne fairs, carrying\ncargoes of nutmeg or cayenne, silks and woolen goods—along with the inevitable\nbills of exchange.[135](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts135)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIt would be instructive, I think, to pause a moment to think about this term,\n“merchant adventurer.” Originally it just meant a merchant who operated\noutside his own country. It was around this same time, however, at the height\nof the fairs of Champagne and the Italian merchant empires, between 1160 and\n1172, that the term “adventure” began to take on its contemporary meaning. The\nman most responsible for it was the French poet Chretien de Troyes, author of\nthe famous Arthurian romances—most famous, perhaps, for being the first to\ntell the story of Sir Percival and the Holy Grail. The romances were a new\nsort of literature featuring a new sort of hero, the “knight-errant,” a\nwarrior who roamed the world in search of, precisely, “adventure”—in the\ncontemporary sense of the word: perilous challenges, love, treasure, and\nrenown. Stories of knightly adventure quickly became enormously popular,\nChretein was followed by innumerable imitators, and the central characters in\nthe stories—Arthur and Guinevere, Lancelot, Gawain, Percival, and the\nrest—became known to everyone, as they are still. This courtly ideal of the\ngallant knight, the quest, the joust, romance and adventure, remains central\nto our image of the Middle\nAges.[136](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts136)\n\nThe curious thing is that it bears almost no relation to reality. Nothing\nremotely like a real “knight-errant” ever existed. “Knights” had originally\nbeen a term for freelance warriors, drawn from the younger or, often, bastard\nsons of the minor nobility. Unable to inherit, many were forced to band\ntogether to seek their fortunes. Many became little more than roving bands of\nthugs, in an endless pursuit of plunder—precisely the sort of people who made\nmerchants’ lives so dangerous. Culminating in the twelfth century, there was a\nconcerted effort to bring this dangerous population under the control of the\ncivil authorities: not only the code of chivalry, but the tournament, the\njoust—all these were more than anything else ways of keeping them out of\ntrouble, as it were, in part by setting knights against each other, in part by\nturning their entire existence into a kind of stylized\nritual.[137](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts137) The ideal of the\nlone wandering knight, in search of some gallant adventure, on the other hand,\nseems to have come out of nowhere.\n\nThis is important, since it lies at the very heart of our image of the Middle\nAges—and the explanation, I think, is revealing. We have to recall that\nmerchants had begun to achieve unprecedented social and even political power\naround this time, but that, in dramatic contrast to Islam, where a figure like\nSindbad—the successful merchant adventurer—could serve as a fictional exemplar\nof the perfect life, merchants, unlike warriors, were never seen as paragons\nof much of anything.\n\nIt’s likely no coincidence that Chretien was living in Troyes, at the very\nheartland of the Champagne fairs that had become, in turn, the commercial hub\nof Western Europe.[138](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts138) While\nhe appears to have modeled his vision of Camelot on the elaborate court life\nunder his patron Henri the Liberal (1152–1181), Count of Champagne, and his\nwife Marie, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, the real court was staffed by\nlow-born _commerçants_ , who served as serjeants of the fairs—leaving most\nreal knights in the role of onlookers, guards, or—at tournaments—entertainers.\n\nThis is not to say that tournaments did not become a kind of economic focus in\ntheir own right, according to one early twentieth-century Medievalist, Amy\nKelly:\n\nThe biographer of Guillaume le Marechal gives an idea of how this rabble of\ncourtly routiers amused itself on the jousting fields of western Europe. To\nthe tournaments, occurring in a brisk season about twice a month from\nPentecost to the feast of St John, flocked the young bloods, sometimes three\nthousand strong, taking possession of the nearest town. Thither also flocked\nhorse dealers from Lombardy and Spain, from Brittany and the Low Countries, as\nwell as armorers, haberdashers for man and beast, usurers, mimes and story-\ntellers, acrobats, necromancers, and other gentlemen of the lists, the field,\nthe road. Entertainers of every stripe found liberal patronage … There were\nfeasts in upper chambers, and forges rang in the smithies all night long.\nBrawls with grisly incidents—a cracked skull, a gouged eye—occurred as the\nbetting progressed and the dice flew. To cry up their champions in the field\ncame ladies of fair name and others of no name at all.\n\nThe hazards, the concourse, the prizes, keyed men to the pitch of war. The\nstakes were magnificent, for the victor held his prize, horse and man, for\nransom. And for these ransoms fiefs went in gage or the hapless victim fell\ninto the hands of usurers, giving his men, and in extremity, himself, as\nhostages. Fortunes were made and lost on the point of a lance and many a\nmother’s son failed to ride\nhome.[139](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts139)\n\nSo, it was not only that the merchants supplied the materials that made the\nfairs possible; Since vanquished knights technically owed their lives to the\nvictors, merchants ended up, in their capacity as moneylenders, making good\nbusiness out of liquidating their assets. Alternately, a knight might borrow\nvast sums to outfit himself in magnificence, hoping to impress some fair lady\n(with handsome dowry) with his victories; others, to take part in the\ncontinual whoring and gambling that always surrounded such events. Losers\nwould end up having to sell their armor and horses, and this created the\ndanger that they would go back to being highwaymen, foment pogroms (if their\ncreditors were Jews) or, if they had lands, make new fiscal demands on those\nunfortunate enough to live on them.\n\nOthers turned to war, which itself tended to drive the creation of new\nmarkets.[140](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts140) In one of the\nmost dramatic of such incidents, in November 1199, a large number of knights\nat a tournament at the castle of Écry in Champagne, sponsored by Henry’s son,\nTheobald, were seized by a great religious passion, abandoned their games, and\nswore a vow to instead retake the Holy Land. The crusader army then proceeded\nto commission the Venetian fleet for transport in exchange for a promise of a\n50-percent share in all resulting profits. In the end, rather than proceeding\nto the Holy Land, they ended up sacking the (much wealthier, Orthodox)\nChristian city of Constantinople after a prolonged and bloody siege. A Flemish\ncount named Baldwin was installed as “Latin Emperor of Constantinople,” but\nattempting to govern a city that had been largely destroyed and stripped of\neverything of value ensured that he and his barons soon ended up in great\nfinancial difficulties. In a gigantic version of what was happening on the\nsmall scale in so many tournaments, they were ultimately reduced to stripping\nthe metal off the church roofs and auctioning holy relics to pay back their\nVenetian creditors. By 1259, Baldwin had sunk to the point of taking out a\nmortgage on his own son, who was taken back to Venice as security for a\nloan.[141](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts141)\n\nAll this does not really answer the question: Whence, then, this image of the\nsolitary knight-errant, wandering the forests of a mythic Albion, challenging\nrivals, confronting ogres, fairies, wizards, and mysterious beasts? The answer\nshould be clear by now. Really, this is just a sublimated, romanticized image\nof the traveling merchants themselves: men who did, after all, set off on\nlonely ventures through wilds and forests, whose outcome was anything but\ncertain.[142](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts142)\n\nAnd what of the Grail, that mysterious object that all the knights-errant were\nultimately seeking? Oddly enough, Richard Wagner, composer of the opera\n_Parzifal_ , first suggested that the Grail was a symbol inspired by the new\nforms of finance.[143](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts143) Where\nearlier epic heroes sought after, and fought over, piles of real, concrete\ngold and silver—the Nibelung’s hoard—these new ones, born of the new\ncommercial economy, pursued purely abstract forms of value. No one, after all,\nknew precisely what the Grail was. Even the epics disagree: sometimes it’s a\nplate, sometimes a cup, sometimes a stone. (Wolfram von Eschenbach imagined it\nto be a jewel knocked from Lucifer’s helmet in a battle at the dawn of time.)\nIn a way it doesn’t matter. The point is that it’s invisible, intangible, but\nat the same time of infinite, inexhaustible value, containing everything,\ncapable of making the wasteland flower, feeding the world, providing spiritual\nsustenance, and healing wounded bodies. Marc Shell even suggested that it\nwould best be conceived as a blank check, the ultimate financial\nabstraction.[144](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts144)\n\n## What, Then, Were the Middle Ages?\n\n_Each of us is a mere symbolon of a man, the result of bisection, like the\nflat fish, two out of one, and each of us is constantly searching for his\ncorresponding symbolon_.\n\n—Plato, _The Symposium_\n\nThere is one way that Wagner got it wrong: the introduction of financial\nabstraction was not a sign that Europe was leaving the Middle Ages, but that\nit was finally, belatedly, entering it.\n\nWagner’s not really to blame here. Almost everyone gets this wrong, because\nthe most characteristic Medieval institutions and ideas arrived so late in\nEurope that we tend to mistake them for the first stirrings of modernity.\nWe’ve already seen this with bills of exchange, already in use in the East by\n700 or 800 ad, but only reaching Europe several centuries later. The\nindependent university—perhaps the quintessential Medieval institution—is\nanother case in point. Nalanda was founded in 427 ad, and there were\nindependent institutions of higher learning all over China and the Near West\n(from Cairo to Constantinople) centuries before the creation of similar\ninstitutions in Oxford, Paris, and Bologna.\n\nIf the Axial Age was the age of materialism, the Middle Ages were above all\nelse the age of transcendence. The collapse of the ancient empires did not,\nfor the most part, lead to the rise of new\nones.[145](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts145) Instead, once-\nsubversive popular religious movements were catapulted into the status of\ndominant institutions. Slavery declined or disappeared, as did the overall\nlevel of violence. As trade picked up, so did the pace of technological\ninnovation; greater peace brought greater possibilities not only for the\nmovement of silks and spices, but also of people and ideas. The fact that\nmonks in Medieval China could devote themselves to translating ancient\ntreatises in Sanskrit, and that students in madrasas in Medieval Indonesia\ncould debate legal terms in Arabic, is testimony to the profound\ncosmopolitanism of the age.\n\nOur image of the Middle Ages as an “age of faith”—and hence, of blind\nobedience to authority—is a legacy of the French Enlightenment. Again, it\nmakes sense only if you think of the “Middle Ages” as something that happened\nprimarily in Europe. Not only was the Far West an unusually violent place by\nworld standards, the Catholic Church was extraordinarily intolerant. It’s hard\nto find many Medieval Chinese, Indian, or Islamic parallels, for example, to\nthe burning of “witches” or the massacre of heretics. More typical was the\npattern that prevailed in certain periods of Chinese history, when it was\nperfectly acceptable for a scholar to dabble in Taoism in his youth, become a\nConfucian in middle age, then become a Buddhist on retirement. If there is an\nessence to Medieval thought, it lies not in blind obedience to authority, but\nrather in a dogged insistence that the values that govern our ordinary daily\naffairs—particularly those of the court and marketplace—are confused,\nmistaken, illusory, or perverse. True value lay elsewhere, in a domain that\ncannot be directly perceived, but only approached through study or\ncontemplation. But this in turn made the faculties of contemplation, and the\nentire question of knowledge, an endless problem. Consider for example the\ngreat conundrum, pondered by Muslim, Christian, and Jewish philosophers alike:\nWhat does it mean to simultaneously say that we can only know God through our\nfaculties of Reason, but that Reason itself partakes of God? Chinese\nphilosophers were struggling with similar conundrums when they asked, “Do we\nread the classics or do the classics read us?” Almost all the great\nintellectual debates of the age turned on this question in one way or another.\nIs the world created by our minds, or our minds by the world?\n\nWe can see the same tensions within predominant theories of money. Aristotle\nhad argued that gold and silver had no intrinsic value in themselves, and that\nmoney therefore was just a social convention, invented by human communities to\nfacilitate exchange. Since it had “come about by agreement, therefore it is\nwithin our power to change it or render it useless” if we all decide that\nthat’s what we want to\ndo.[146](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts146) This position gained\nlittle traction in the materialist intellectual environment of the Axial Age,\nbut by the later Middle Ages, it had become standard wisdom. Ghazali was among\nthe first to embrace it. In his own way he took it even further, insisting\nthat the fact that a gold coin has no intrinsic value _is_ the basis of its\nvalue as money, since this very lack of intrinsic value is what allows it to\n“govern,” measure, and regulate the value of other things. But at the same\ntime, Ghazali denied that money was a social convention. It was given us by\nGod.[147](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts147)\n\nGhazali was a mystic, and a political conservative, so one might argue that he\nultimately shied away from the most radical implications of his own ideas. But\none could also ask whether, in the Middle Ages, arguing that money was an\narbitrary social convention was really all that radical a position. After all,\nwhen Christian and Chinese thinkers insisted that it was, it was almost always\nas a way of saying that money is whatever the king or the emperor wished it to\nbe. In that sense, Ghazali’s position was perfectly consonant with the Islamic\ndesire to protect the market from political interference by saying that it\nfell properly under the aegis of religious authorities.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe fact that Medieval money took such abstract, virtual forms—checks,\ntallies, paper money—meant that questions like these (“What does it mean to\nsay that money is a symbol?”) cut to the core of the philosophical issues of\nthe day. Nowhere is this so true as in the history of the word “symbol”\nitself. Here we encounter some parallels so extraordinary that they can only\nbe described as startling.\n\nWhen Aristotle argued that coins are merely social conventions, the term he\nused was _symbolon_ —from which our own word “symbol” is derived. Symbolon was\noriginally the Greek word for “tally”—an object broken in half to mark a\ncontract or agreement, or marked and broken to record a debt. So our word\n“symbol” traces back originally to objects broken to record debt contracts of\none sort or another. This is striking enough. What’s really, remarkable,\nthough, is that the contemporary Chinese word for “symbol,” fu, or _fu hao_ ,\nhas almost exactly the same\norigin.[148](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts148)\n\nLet’s start with the Greek term _“symbolon.”_ Two friends at dinner might\ncreate a symbolon if they took some object—a ring, a knucklebone, a piece of\ncrockery—and broke it in half. Any time in the future when either of them had\nneed of the other’s help, they could bring their halves as reminders of the\nfriendship. Archeologists have found hundreds of little broken friendship\ntablets of this sort in Athens, often made of clay. Later they became ways of\nsealing a contract, the object standing in the place of\nwitnesses.[149](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts149) The word was\nalso used for tokens of every sort: those given to Athenian jurors entitling\nthem to vote, or tickets for admission to the theater. It could be used refer\nto money too, but only if that money had no intrinsic value: bronze coins\nwhose value was fixed only by local\nconvention.[150](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts150) Used for\nwritten documents, a symbolon could also be passport, contract, commission, or\nreceipt. By extension, it came to mean: omen, portent, symptom, or finally, in\nthe now-familiar sense, symbol.\n\nThe path to the latter appears to have been twofold. Aristotle fixed on the\nfact that a tally could be anything: what the object was didn’t matter; all\nthat mattered was that there was a way to break it in half. It is exactly so\nwith language: words are sounds we use to refer to objects, or to ideas, but\nthe relation is arbitrary: there’s no particular reason, for example, that\nEnglish-speakers should choose “dog” to refer to an animal and “god” to refer\nto a deity, rather than the other way around. The only reason is social\nconvention: an agreement between all speakers of a language that this sound\nshall refer to that thing. In this sense, all words were arbitrary tokens of\nagreement.[151](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts151) So, of course,\nis money—for Aristotle, not only worthless bronze coins that we agree to treat\nas if they were worth a certain amount, but all money, even gold, is just a\nsymbolon, a social\nconvention.[152](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts152)\n\nAll this came to seem almost commonsensical in the thirteenth century of\nThomas Aquinas, when rulers could change the value of currency simply by\nissuing a decree. Still, Medieval theories of symbols derived less from\nAristotle than from the Mystery Religions of Antiquity, where “symbolon” came\nto refer to certain cryptic formulae or talismans that only initiates could\nunderstand.[153](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts153) It thus came\nto mean a concrete token, perceptible to the senses, that could only be\nunderstood in reference to some hidden reality entirely beyond the domain of\nsensory experience.[154](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts154)\n\nThe theorist of the symbol whose work was most widely read and respected in\nthe Middle Ages was a sixth-century Greek Christian mystic whose real name has\nbeen lost to history, but who is known by his pseudonym Dionysius the\nAreopagite.[155](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts155) Dionysius\ntook up the notion in this latter sense to confront what was to become the\ngreat intellectual problem of the age: How is it possible for humans to have\nknowledge of God? How can we, whose knowledge is confined to what our senses\ncan perceive of the material universe, have knowledge of a being whose nature\nis absolutely alien to that material universe—“that infinity beyond being,” as\nhe puts it, “that oneness that is beyond\nintelligence”?[156](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts156) It would\nbe impossible were it not for the fact that God, being all-powerful, can do\nanything, and therefore, just as he places his own body in the Eucharist, so\ncan he reveal himself to our minds through an endless variety of material\nshapes. Intriguingly, Dionysius warns us that we cannot begin to understand\nhow symbols work until we rid ourselves of the notion that divine things are\nlikely to be beautiful. Images of luminous angels and celestial chariots are\nonly likely to confuse us, since we will be tempted to imagine that that’s\nwhat heaven is actually like, and in fact we cannot possibly conceive of what\nheaven is like. Instead, effective symbols are, like the original symbolon,\nhomely objects selected apparently at random; often, ugly, ridiculous things,\nwhose very incongruity reminds us that they are _not_ God; of the fact that\nGod “transcends all materiality,” even as, in another sense, they are\nGod.[157](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts157) But the notion that\nthey are in any sense tokens of agreement between equals is gone entirely.\nSymbols are gifts, absolute, free, hierarchical gifts, presented by a being so\nfar above us that any thought of reciprocity, debt, or mutual obligation is\nsimply inconceivable.[158](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts158)\n\nCompare the Greek dictionary above to the following, from a Chinese\ndictionary:\n\nFU. To agree with, to tally. The two halves of a tally.\n\n• evidence; proof of identity, credentials\n\n• to fulfill a promise, to keep one’s word\n\n• to reconcile\n\n• the mutual agreement between Heaven’s appointment and human affairs\n\n• a tally, a check\n\n• an imperial seal or stamp\n\n• a warrant, a commission, credentials\n\n• like fitting the two halves of a tally, in exact agreement\n\n• a symbol, a sign …[159](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts159)\n\nThe evolution is almost exactly the same. Like _symbola, fu_ can be tallies,\ncontracts, official seals, warrants, passports, or credentials. As promises,\nthey can embody an agreement, a debt contract, or even a relation of feudal\nvassalage—since a minor lord agreeing to become another man’s vassal would\nsplit a tally just as he would if borrowing grain or money. The common feature\nseems to be a contract between two parties that begin as equal, in which one\nagrees to become subordinate. Later, as the state became more centralized, we\nmainly hear about fu presented to officials as a means of conveying order: the\nofficial would take the left half with him when posted to the provinces, and\nwhen the emperor wished to send an important command, he would send the right\nhalf with the messenger to make sure that the official knew it was actually\nthe imperial will.[160](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts160)\n\nWe’ve already seen how paper money seems to have developed from paper versions\nof such debt contracts, ripped in half and reunited. For Chinese theorists, of\ncourse, Aristotle’s argument that money was simply a social convention was\nhardly radical; it was simply assumed. Money was whatever the emperor\nestablished it to be. Though even here there was a slight proviso, as\nevidenced in the entry above, that “fu” could also refer to “the mutual\nagreement between heaven’s appointment and human affairs.” Just as officials\nwere appointed by the emperor, the emperor was ultimately appointed by a\nhigher power, and he could only rule effectively as long as he kept its\nmandate, which is why propitious omens were called “fu,” signs that heaven\napproved of the ruler, just as natural disasters were a sign that he had\nstrayed.[161](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts161)\n\nHere Chinese ideas did grow a bit closer to the Christian ones. But Chinese\nconceptions of the cosmos had one crucial difference: since there was no\nemphasis on the absolute gulf between our world and the one beyond it,\ncontractual relations with the gods were by no means out of the question. This\nwas particularly true in Medieval Taoism, where monks were ordained through a\nceremony called “rending the tally,” ripping apart a piece of paper that\nrepresented a contract with\nheaven.[162](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts162) It was the same\nwith the magical talismans, also called “fu,” which an adept might receive\nfrom his master. These were literally tallies: the adept kept one; the other\nhalf was said to be retained by the gods. Such talismanic fu took the form of\ndiagrams, said to represent a form of celestial writing, comprehensible only\nto the gods, which committed them to assist the bearer, often giving the adept\nthe right to call on armies of divine protectors with whose help he could slay\ndemons, cure the sick, or otherwise attain miraculous powers. But they could\nalso become, like Dionysius’ symbola, objects of contemplation, by which one’s\nmind can ultimately attain some knowledge of the invisible world beyond our\nown.[163](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts163)\n\nMany of the most compelling visual symbols to emerge from Medieval China trace\nback to such talismans: the River Symbol, or, for that matter, the yin-yang\nsymbol that seems to have developed out of\nit.[164](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts164) Just looking at a\nyin-yang symbol, it is easy enough to imagine the left and right (sometimes,\ntoo, called “male” and “female”) halves of a tally.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nA tally does away with the need for witnesses; if the two surfaces agree, then\neveryone knows that the agreement between the contracting parties exists as\nwell. This is why Aristotle saw it as a fit metaphor for words: word A\ncorresponds to concept B because there is a tacit agreement that we shall act\nas if it does. The striking thing about tallies is that even though they might\nbegin as simple tokens of friendship and solidarity, in almost all the later\nexamples, what the two parties actually agree to create is a relation of\ninequality: of debt, obligation, subordination to another’s orders. This is in\nturn what makes it possible to use the metaphor for the relation between the\nmaterial world and that more powerful world that ultimately gives it meaning.\nThe two sides are the same. Yet what they create is absolute difference. Hence\nfor a Medieval Christian mystic, as for Medieval Chinese magicians, symbols\ncould be literal fragments of heaven—even if for the first, they provided a\nlanguage whereby one could have some understanding of beings one could not\npossibly interact with; while for the second, they provided a way of\ninteracting, even making practical arrangements, with beings whose language\none could not possibly understand.\n\nOn one level, this is just another version of the dilemmas that always arise\nwhen we try to reimagine the world through debt—that peculiar agreement\nbetween two equals that they shall no longer be equals, until such time as\nthey become equals once again. Still, the problem took on a peculiar piquancy\nin the Middle Ages, when the economy became, as it were, spiritualized. As\ngold and silver migrated to holy places, ordinary transactions everywhere came\nto be carried out primarily through credit. Inevitably, arguments about wealth\nand markets became arguments about debt and morality, and arguments about debt\nand morality became arguments about the nature of our place in the universe.\nAs we’ve seen, the solutions varied considerably. Europe and India saw a\nreturn to hierarchy: society became a ranked order of Priests, Warriors,\nMerchants, and Farmers (or in Christendom, just Priests, Warriors, and\nFarmers). Debts between the orders were considered threatening because they\nimplied the potential of equality, and they often led to outright violence. In\nChina, in contrast, the principle of debt often became the governing principle\nof the cosmos: karmic debts, milk-debts, debt contracts between human beings\nand celestial powers. From the point of view of the authorities, all these led\nto excess, and potentially to vast concentrations of capital that might throw\nthe entire social order out of balance. It was the responsibility of\ngovernment to intervene constantly to keep markets running smoothly and\nequitably, thus avoiding new outbreaks of popular unrest. In the world of\nIslam, where theologians held that God recreated the entire universe at every\ninstant, market fluctuations were instead seen as merely another manifestation\nof divine will.\n\nThe striking thing is that the Confucian condemnation of the merchant, and the\nIslamic celebration of the merchant, ultimately led to the same thing:\nprosperous societies with flourishing markets, but where the elements never\ncame together to create the great merchant banks and industrial firms that\nwere to become the hallmark of modern capitalism. It’s especially striking in\nthe case of Islam. Certainly, the Islamic world produced figures who would be\nhard to describe as anything but capitalists. Large-scale merchants were\nreferred to as _sĀhib al-mĀl_ , “owners of capital,” and legal theorists spoke\nfreely about the creation and expansion of capital funds. At the height of the\nCaliphate, some of these merchants were in possession of millions of dinars\nand seeking profitable investment. Why did nothing like modern capitalism\nemerge? I would highlight two factors. First, Islamic merchants appear to have\ntaken their free-market ideology seriously. The marketplace did not fall under\nthe direct supervision of the government; contracts were made between\nindividuals—ideally, “with a handshake and a glance at heaven”—and thus honor\nand credit became largely indistinguishable. This is inevitable: you can’t\nhave cutthroat competition where there is no one stopping people from\nliterally cutting one another’s throats. Second, Islam also took seriously the\nprinciple, later enshrined in classical economic theory but only unevenly\nobserved in practice, that profits are the reward for risk. Trading\nenterprises were assumed to be, quite literally, adventures, in which traders\nexposed themselves to the dangers of storm and shipwreck, savage nomads,\nforests, steppes, and deserts, exotic and unpredictable foreign customs, and\narbitrary governments. Financial mechanisms designed to avoid these risks were\nconsidered impious. This was one of the objections to usury: if one demands a\nfixed rate of interest, the profits are guaranteed. Similarly, commercial\ninvestors were expected to share the risk. This made most of the forms of\nfinance and insurance that were to later develop in Europe\nimpossible.[165](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts165)\n\nIn this sense the Buddhist monasteries of early Medieval China represent the\nopposite extreme. The Inexhaustible Treasuries were inexhaustible because, by\ncontinually lending their money out at interest and never otherwise touching\ntheir capital, they could guarantee effectively risk-free investments. That\nwas the entire point. By doing so, Buddhism, unlike Islam, produced something\nvery much like what we now call “corporations”—entities that, through a\ncharming legal fiction, we imagine to be persons, just like human beings, but\nimmortal, never having to go through all the human untidiness of marriage,\nreproduction, infirmity, and death. To put it in properly Medieval terms, they\nare very much like angels.\n\nLegally, our notion of the corporation is very much a product of the European\nHigh Middle Ages. The legal idea of a corporation as a “fictive person”\n(_persona ficta_)—a person who, as Maitland, the great British legal\nhistorian, put it, “is immortal, who sues and is sued, who holds lands, has a\nseal of his own, who makes regulations for those natural persons of whom he is\ncomposed”[166](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts166)—was first\nestablished in canon law by Pope Innocent IV in 1250 ad, and one of the first\nkinds of entities it applied to were monasteries—as also to universities,\nchurches, municipalities, and\nguilds.[167](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts167)\n\nThe idea of the corporation as an angelic being is not mine, incidentally. I\nborrowed it from the great Medievalist Ernst Kantorowicz, who pointed out that\nall this was happening right around the same time that Thomas Aquinas was\ndeveloping the notion that angels were really just the personification of\nPlatonic Ideas.[168](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts168)\n“According to the teachings of Aquinas,” he notes, “every angel represented a\nspecies.”\n\nLittle wonder then that finally the personified collectives of the jurists,\nwhich were juristically immortal species, displayed all the features otherwise\nattributed to angels … The jurists themselves recognized that there was some\nsimilarity between their abstractions and the angelic beings. In this respect,\nit may be said that the political and legal world of thought of the later\nMiddle Ages began to be populated by immaterial angelic bodies, large and\nsmall: they were invisible, ageless, sempiternal, immortal, and sometimes even\nubiquitous; and they were endowed with a _corpus intellectuale_ or _mysticum_\n[an intellectual or mystical body] which could stand any comparison with the\n“spiritual bodies” of the celestial\nbeings.[169](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts169)\n\nAll this is worth emphasizing because while we are used to assuming that\nthere’s something natural or inevitable about the existence of corporations,\nin historical terms, they are actually strange, exotic creatures. No other\ngreat tradition came up with anything like\nit.[170](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts170) They are the most\npeculiarly European addition to that endless proliferation of metaphysical\nentities so characteristic of the Middle Ages—as well as the most enduring.\n\nThey have, of course, changed a great deal over time. Medieval corporations\nowned property, and they often engaged in complex financial arrangements, but\nin no case were they profit-seeking enterprises in the modern sense. The ones\nthat came closest were, perhaps unsurprisingly, monastic orders—above all, the\nCistercians—whose monasteries became something like the Chinese Buddhist ones,\nsurrounded by mills and smithies, practicing rationalized commercial\nagriculture with a workforce of “lay brothers” who were effectively wage\nlaborers, spinning and exporting wool. Some even talk about “monastic\ncapitalism.”[171](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts171) Still, the\nground was only really prepared for capitalism in the familiar sense of the\nterm when the merchants began to organize themselves into eternal bodies as a\nway to win monopolies, legal or de facto, and avoid the ordinary risks of\ntrade. An excellent case in point was the Society of Merchant Adventurers,\ncharted by King Henry IV in London in 1407, who, despite the romantic-sounding\nname, were mainly in the business of buying up British woolens and selling\nthem in the Flanders fairs. They were not a modern joint-stock company, but a\nrather old-fashioned Medieval merchant guild, but they provided a structure\nwhereby older, more substantial merchants could simply provide loans to\nyounger ones, and they managed to secure enough of an exclusive control over\nthe woolen trade that substantial profits were pretty much\nguaranteed.[172](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c10-nts172) When such\ncompanies began to engage in armed ventures overseas, though, a new era of\nhuman history might be said to have begun.\n\n\n# Chapter Eleven  \n  \nAGE OF THE GREAT CAPITALIST EMPIRES\n\n# _(1450–1971 AD)_\n\n_“Eleven pesos, then; and as you can’t pay me the eleven pesos, that makes\nanother eleven pesos—twenty-two in all: eleven for the serape and the petate\nand eleven because you can’t pay. Is that right, Crisiero?”_\n\n_Crisiero had no knowledge of figures, so it was very natural that he said,\n“That is right, patrón.”_\n\n_Don Arnulfo was a decent, honorable man. Other landowners were a good deal\nless softhearted with their peons_.\n\n_“The shirt is five pesos. Right? Very well. And as you can’t pay for it,\nthat’s five pesos. And as you remain in my debt for the five pesos, that’s\nfive pesos. And as I shall never have the money from you, that’s five pesos.\nSo that makes five and five and five and five. That’s twenty pesos. Agreed?”_\n\n_“Yes, patrón, agreed.”_\n\n_The peon can get the shirt nowhere else when he needs one. He can get credit\nnowhere but from his master, for whom he works and from whom he can never get\naway as long as he owes him a centavo_.\n\n—B. Traven, _The Carreta_\n\nTHE EPOCH THAT BEGAN with what we’re used to calling the “Age of Exploration”\nwas marked by so many things that were genuinely new—the rise of modern\nscience, capitalism, humanism, the nation-state—that it may seem odd to frame\nit as just another turn of an historical cycle. Still, from the perspective\nI’ve been developing in this book, that is what it was.\n\nThe era begins around 1450 with a turn away from virtual currencies and credit\neconomies and back to gold and silver. The subsequent flow of bullion from the\nAmericas sped the process immensely, sparking a “price revolution” in Western\nEurope that turned traditional society upside-down. What’s more, the return to\nbullion was accompanied by the return of a whole host of other conditions\nthat, during the Middle Ages, had been largely suppressed or kept at bay: vast\nempires and professional armies, massive predatory warfare, untrammeled usury\nand debt peonage, but also materialist philosophies, a new burst of scientific\nand philosophical creativity—even the return of chattel slavery. It was in no\nway a simple repeat performance. All the Axial Age pieces reappeared, but they\ncame together in an entirely different way.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe 1400s are a peculiar period in European history. It was a century of\nendless catastrophe: large cities were regularly decimated by the Black Death;\nthe commercial economy sagged and in some regions collapsed entirely; whole\ncities went bankrupt, defaulting on their bonds; the knightly classes\nsquabbled over the remnants, leaving much of the countryside devastated by\nendemic warfare. Even in geopolitical terms Christendom was staggering, with\nthe Ottoman Empire not only scooping up what remained of Byzantium but pushing\nsteadily into central Europe, its forces expanding on land and sea.\n\nAt the same time, from the perspective of many ordinary farmers and urban\nlaborers, times couldn’t have been much better. One of the perverse effects of\nthe bubonic plague, which killed off about one-third of the European\nworkforce, was that wages increased dramatically. It didn’t happen\nimmediately, but this was largely because the first reaction of the\nauthorities was to enact legislation freezing wages, or even attempting to tie\nfree peasants back to the land again. Such efforts were met with powerful\nresistance, culminating in a series of popular uprisings across Europe. These\nwere squelched, but the authorities were also forced to compromise. Before\nlong, so much wealth was flowing into the hands of ordinary people that\ngovernments had to start introducing new laws forbidding the lowborn to wear\nsilks and ermine, and to limit the number of feast days, which, in many towns\nand parishes, began eating up one-third or even half of the year. The\nfifteenth century is, in fact, considered the heyday of Medieval festive life,\nwith its floats and dragons, maypoles and church ales, its Abbots of Unreason\nand Lords of Misrule.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts001)\n\nOver the next centuries, all this was to be destroyed. In England, the festive\nlife was systematically attacked by Puritan reformers; then eventually by\nreformers everywhere, Catholic and Protestant alike. At the same time its\neconomic basis in popular prosperity dissolved.\n\nWhy this happened has been a matter of intense historical debate for\ncenturies. This much we know: it began with a massive inflation. Between 1500\nand 1650, for instance, prices in England increased 500 percent, but wages\nrose much more slowly, so that in five generations, real wages fell to perhaps\n40 percent of what they had been. The same thing happened everywhere in\nEurope.\n\nWhy? The favorite explanation, ever since a French lawyer named Jean Bodin\nfirst proposed it in 1568, was the vast influx of gold and silver that came\npouring into Europe after the conquest of the New World. As the value of\nprecious metals collapsed, the argument went, the price of everything else\nskyrocketed, and wages simply couldn’t keep\nup.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts002) There is some evidence\nto support this. The height of popular prosperity around 1450 did correspond\nto a period when bullion—and therefore, coin—was in particularly short\nsupply.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts003) The lack of cash\nplayed havoc with international trade in particular; in the 1460s, we hear of\nships full of wares forced to turn back from major ports, as no one had any\ncash on hand to buy from them. The problem only started to turn around later\nin the decade, with a sudden burst of silver mining in Saxony and the Tirol,\nfollowed by the opening of new sea routes to the Gold Coast of West Africa.\nThen came the conquests of Cortés and Pizarro. Between 1520 and 1640, untold\ntons of gold and silver from Mexico and Peru were transported across the\nAtlantic and Pacific in Spanish treasure ships.\n\nThe problem with the conventional story is that very little of that gold and\nsilver lingered very long in Europe. Most of the gold ended up in temples in\nIndia, and the overwhelming majority of the silver bullion was ultimately\nshipped off to China. The latter is crucial. If we really want to understand\nthe origins of the modern world economy, the place to start is not in Europe\nat all. The real story is of how China abandoned the use of paper money. It’s\na story worth telling briefly, because very few people know it.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nAfter the Mongols conquered China in 1271, they kept the system of paper money\nin place, and even made occasional (if usually disastrous) attempts to\nintroduce it in the other parts of their empire. In 1368, however, they were\noverthrown by another of China’s great popular insurrections, and a former\npeasant leader was once again installed in power.\n\nDuring their century of rule, the Mongols had worked closely with foreign\nmerchants, who became widely detested. Partly as a result, the former rebels,\nnow the Ming dynasty, were suspicious of commerce in any form, and they\npromoted a romantic vision of self-sufficient agrarian communities. This had\nsome unfortunate consequences. For one thing, it meant the maintenance of the\nold Mongol tax system, paid in labor and in kind; especially since that, in\nturn, was based on a quasi-caste system in which subjects were registered as\nfarmers, craftsmen, or soldiers and forbidden to change their jobs. This\nproved extraordinarily unpopular. While government investment in agriculture,\nroads, and canals did set off a commercial boom, much of this commerce was\ntechnically illegal, and taxes on crops were so high that many indebted\nfarmers began to flee their ancestral\nlands.[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts004)\n\nTypically, such floating populations can be expected to seek just about\nanything but regular industrial employment; here as in Europe, most preferred\na combination of odd jobs, peddling, entertainment, piracy, or banditry. In\nChina, many also turned prospector. There was a minor silver rush, with\nillegal mines cropping up everywhere. Uncoined silver ingots, instead of\nofficial paper money and strings of bronze coins, soon became the real money\nof the off-the-books informal economy. When the government attempted to shut\ndown illegal mines in the 1430s and 1440s, their efforts sparked local\ninsurrections, in which miners would make common cause with displaced\npeasants, seize nearby cities, and sometimes threaten entire\nprovinces.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts005)\n\nIn the end, the government gave up even trying to suppress the informal\neconomy. Instead, they swung the other way entirely: stopped issuing paper\nmoney, legalized the mines, allowed silver bullion to become the recognized\ncurrency for large transactions, and even gave private mints the authority to\nproduce strings of cash.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts006)\nThis, in turn, allowed the government to gradually abandon the system of labor\nexactions and substitute a uniform tax system payable in silver.\n\nEffectively, the Chinese government had gone back to its old policy of\nencouraging markets and merely intervening to prevent any undue concentrations\nof capital. It quickly proved spectacularly successful, and Chinese markets\nboomed. Indeed, many speak of the Ming as having accomplished something almost\nunique in world history: this was a time when the Chinese population was\nexploding, but living standards markedly\nimproved.[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts007) The problem was\nthat the new policy meant that the regime had to ensure an abundant supply of\nsilver in the country, so as to keep its price low and minimize popular\nunrest—but as it turned out, the Chinese mines were very quickly exhausted. In\nthe 1530s, new silver mines were discovered in Japan, but these were exhausted\nin a decade or two as well. Before long, China had to turn to Europe and the\nNew World.\n\nNow, since Roman times, Europe had been exporting gold and silver to the East:\nthe problem was that Europe had never produced much of anything that Asians\nwanted to buy, so it was forced to pay in specie for silks, spices, steel, and\nother imports. The early years of European expansion were largely attempts to\ngain access either to Eastern luxuries or to new sources of gold and silver\nwith which to pay for them. In those early days, Atlantic Europe really had\nonly one substantial advantage over its Muslim rivals: an active and advanced\ntradition of naval warfare, honed by centuries of conflict in the\nMediterranean. The moment when Vasco da Gama entered the Indian Ocean in 1498,\nthe principle that the seas should be a zone of peaceful trade came to an\nimmediate end. Portuguese flotillas began bombarding and sacking every port\ncity they came across, then seizing control of strategic points and extorting\nprotection money from unarmed Indian Ocean merchants for the right to carry on\ntheir business unmolested.\n\nAt almost exactly the same time, Christopher Columbus—a Genoese mapmaker\nseeking a short-cut to China—touched land in the New World, and the Spanish\nand Portuguese empires stumbled into the greatest economic windfall in human\nhistory: entire continents full of unfathomable wealth, whose inhabitants,\narmed only with Stone Age weapons, began conveniently dying almost as soon as\nthey arrived. The conquest of Mexico and Peru led to the discovery of enormous\nnew sources of precious metal, and these were exploited ruthlessly and\nsystematically, even to the point of largely exterminating the surrounding\npopulations to extract as much precious metal as quickly as possible. As\nKenneth Pomeranz has recently pointed out, none of this would have been\npossible were it not for the practically unlimited Asian demand for precious\nmetals.\n\nHad China in particular not had such a dynamic economy that changing its\nmetallic base could absorb the staggering quantities of silver mined in the\nNew World over three centuries, those mines might have become unprofitable\nwithin a few decades. The massive inflation of silver-denominated prices in\nEurope from 1500 to 1640 indicates a shrinking value for the metal there even\nwith Asia draining off much of the\nsupply.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts008)\n\nBy 1540, a silver glut caused a collapse in prices across Europe; the American\nmines would, at this point, simply have stopped functioning, and the entire\nproject of American colonization foundered, had it not been for the demand\nfrom China.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts009) Treasure\ngalleons moving toward Europe soon refrained from unloading their cargoes,\ninstead rounding the horn of Africa and proceeding across the Indian Ocean\ntoward Canton. After 1571, with the foundation of the Spanish city of Manila,\nthey began to move directly across the Pacific. By the late sixteenth century,\nChina was importing almost fifty tons of silver a year, about 90 percent of\nits silver, and by the early seventeenth century, 116 tons, or over 97\npercent.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts010) Huge amounts of\nsilk, porcelain, and other Chinese products had to be exported to pay for it.\nMany of these Chinese products, in turn, ended up in the new cities of Central\nand South America. This Asian trade became the single most significant factor\nin the emerging global economy, and those who ultimately controlled the\nfinancial levers—particularly Italian, Dutch, and German merchant\nbankers—became fantastically rich.\n\nBut how exactly did the new global economy cause the collapse of living\nstandards in Europe? One thing we do know: it clearly was _not_ by making\nlarge amounts of precious metal available for everyday transactions. If\nanything, the effect was the opposite. While European mints were stamping out\nenormous numbers of rials, thalers, ducats, and doubloons, which became the\nnew medium of trade from Nicaragua to Bengal, almost none found their way into\nthe pockets of ordinary Europeans. Instead, we hear constant complaints about\nthe shortage of currency. In England:\n\nFor much of the Tudor period the circulating medium was so small that the\ntaxable population simply did not have sufficient coin in which to pay the\nbenevolences, subsidies, and tenths levied upon them, and time and time again\nhousehold plate, the handiest near money that most people possessed, had to be\nsurrendered.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts011)\n\nThis was the case in most of Europe. Despite the massive influx of metal from\nthe Americas, most families were so low on cash that they were regularly\nreduced to melting down the family silver to pay their taxes.\n\nThis was because taxes _had_ to be paid in metal. Everyday business in\ncontrast continued to be transacted much as it had in the Middle Ages, by\nmeans of various forms of virtual credit money: tallies, promissory notes, or,\nwithin smaller communities, simply by keeping track of who owed what to whom.\nWhat really caused the inflation is that those who ended up in control of the\nbullion—governments, bankers, large-scale merchants—were able to use that\ncontrol to begin changing the rules, first by insisting that gold and silver\n_were_ money, and second by introducing new forms of credit-money for their\nown use while slowly undermining and destroying the local systems of trust\nthat had allowed small-scale communities across Europe to operate largely\nwithout the use of metal currency.\n\nThis was a political battle, even if it was also a conceptual argument about\nthe nature of money. The new regime of bullion money could only be imposed\nthrough almost unparalleled violence—not only overseas, but at home as well.\nIn much of Europe, the first reaction to the “price revolution” and\naccompanying enclosures of common lands was not very different from what had\nso recently happened in China: thousands of one-time peasants fleeing or being\nforced out of their villages to become vagabonds or “masterless men,” a\nprocess that culminated in popular insurrections. The reaction of European\ngovernments, however, was entirely different. The rebellions were crushed, and\nthis time, no subsequent concessions were forthcoming. Vagabonds were rounded\nup, exported to the colonies as indentured laborers, and drafted into colonial\narmies and navies—or, eventually, set to work in factories at home.\n\nAlmost all of this was carried out through a manipulation of debt. As a\nresult, the very nature of debt, too, became once again one of the principal\nbones of contention.\n\n## Part I:\n\n### Greed, Terror, Indignation, Debt\n\nNo doubt scholars will never stop arguing about the reasons for the great\n“price revolution”—largely because it’s not clear what kind of tools can be\napplied. Can we really use the methods of modern economics, which were\ndesigned to understand how contemporary economic institutions operate, to\ndescribe the political battles that led to the creation of those very\ninstitutions?\n\nThis is not just a conceptual problem. There are moral dangers here. To take\nwhat might seem an “objective,” macro-economic approach to the origins of the\nworld economy would be to treat the behavior of early European explorers,\nmerchants, and conquerors as if they were simply rational responses to\nopportunities—as if this were just what anyone would have done in the same\nsituation. This is what the use of equations so often does: make it seem\nperfectly natural to assume that, if the price of silver in China is twice\nwhat it is in Seville, and inhabitants of Seville are capable of getting their\nhands on large quantities of silver and transporting it to China, then clearly\nthey will, even if doing so requires the destruction of entire civilizations.\nOr if there is a demand for sugar in England, and enslaving millions is the\neasiest way to acquire labor to produce it, then it is inevitable that some\nwill enslave them. In fact, history makes it quite clear that this is not the\ncase. Any number of civilizations have probably been in a position to wreak\nhavoc on the scale that the European powers did in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries (Ming China itself was an obvious candidate), but almost\nnone actually did so.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts012)\n\nConsider, for instance, how the gold and silver from the American mines were\nextracted. Mining operations began almost immediately upon the fall of the\nAztec capital of Tenochtitlán in 1521. While we are used to assuming that the\nMexican population was devastated simply as an effect of newly introduced\nEuropean diseases, contemporary observers felt that the dragooning of the\nnewly conquered natives to work in the mines was at least equally\nresponsible.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts013) In _The\nConquest of America_ , Tzvetan Todorov offers a compendium of some of the most\nchilling reports, mostly from Spanish priests and friars who, even when\ncommitted in principle to the belief that the extermination of the Indians was\nthe judgment of God, could not disguise their horror at scenes of Spanish\nsoldiers testing the blades of their weapons by eviscerating random passers-\nby, and tearing babies off their mother’s backs to be eaten by dogs. Such acts\nmight perhaps be written off as what one would expect when a collection of\nheavily armed men—many of violent criminal background—are given absolute\nimpunity; but the reports from the mines imply something far more systematic.\nWhen Fray Toribio de Motolinia wrote of the ten plagues that he believed God\nhad visited on the inhabitants of Mexico, he listed smallpox, war, famine,\nlabor exactions, taxes (which caused many to sell their children to\nmoneylenders, others to be tortured to death in cruel prisons), and the\nthousands who died in the building of the capital city. Above all, he\ninsisted, were the uncountable numbers who died in the mines:\n\nThe eighth plague was the slaves whom the Spaniards made in order to put them\nto work in the mines. At first those who were already slaves of the Aztecs\nwere taken; then those who had given evidence of insubordination; finally all\nthose who could be caught. During the first years after the conquest, the\nslave traffic flourished, and slaves often changed master. They produced so\nmany marks on their faces, in addition to the royal brand, that they had their\nfaces covered with letters, for they bore the marks of all who had bought and\nsold them.\n\nThe ninth plague was the service in the mines, to which the heavily laden\nIndians traveled sixty leagues or more to carry provisions … When their food\ngave out they died, either at the mines or on the road, for they had no money\nto buy food and there was no one to give it to them. Some reached home in such\na state that they died soon after. The bodies of those Indians and of the\nslaves who died in the mines produced such a stench that it caused a\npestilence, especially at the mines of Oaxaca. For half a league around these\nmines and along a great part of the road one could scarcely avoid walking over\ndead bodies or bones, and the flocks of birds and crows that came to fatten\nthemselves upon the corpses were so numerous that they darkened the\nsun.”[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts014)\n\nSimilar scenes were reported in Peru, where whole regions were depopulated by\nforced service in the mines, and Hispaniola, where the indigenous population\nwas eradicated entirely.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts015)\n\nWhen dealing with conquistadors, we are speaking not just of simple greed, but\ngreed raised to mythic proportions. This is, after all, what they are best\nremembered for. They never seemed to get enough. Even after the conquest of\nTenochtitlán or Cuzco, and the acquisition of hitherto-unimaginable riches,\nthe conquerors almost invariably regrouped and started off in search of more\ntreasure.\n\nMoralists throughout the ages have inveighed against the endlessness of human\ngreed, just as they have against our supposedly endless lust for power. What\nhistory actually reveals, though, is that while humans may be justly accused\nof having a proclivity to accuse _others_ of acting like conquistadors, few\nreally act this way themselves. Even for the most ambitious of us, our dreams\nare more like Sindbad’s: to have adventures, to acquire the means to settle\ndown and live an enjoyable life, and then, to enjoy it. Max Weber of course\nargued that the essence of capitalism is the urge—which he thought first\nappeared in Calvinism—never to settle down, but to engage in endless\nexpansion. But the conquistadors were good Medieval Catholics, even if ones\nusually drawn from the most ruthless and unprincipled elements of Spanish\nsociety. Why the unrelenting drive for more and more and more?\n\nIt might help, I think, to go back to the very onset of Hernán Cortés’s\nconquest of Mexico: What were his immediate motives? Cortés had migrated to\nthe colony of Hispaniola in 1504, dreaming of glory and adventure, but for the\nfirst decade and a half, his adventures had largely consisted of seducing\nother people’s wives. In 1518, however, he managed to finagle his way into\nbeing named commander of an expedition to establish a Spanish presence on the\nmainland. As Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who accompanied him, later wrote,\naround this time\n\nHe began to adorn himself and be more careful of his appearance than before.\nHe wore a plume of feathers, with a medallion and a gold chain, and a velvet\ncloak trimmed with loops of gold. In fact he looked like a bold and gallant\nCaptain. However, he had no money to defray the expenses I have spoken about,\nfor at the time he was very poor and much in debt, despite the fact that he\nhad a good estate of Indians and was getting gold from the mines. But all this\nhe spent on his person, on finery for his wife, whom he had recently married,\nand on entertaining guests …\n\nWhen some merchant friends of his heard that he had obtained his command as\nCaptain General, they lent him four thousand gold pesos in coin and another\nfour thousand in goods secured on his Indians and estates. He then ordered two\nstandards and banners to be made, worked in gold with the royal arms and a\ncross on each side with a legend which said, “Comrades, let us follow the sign\nof the Holy Cross with true faith, and through it we shall\nconquer.”[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts016)\n\nIn other words, he’d been living beyond his means, got himself in trouble, and\ndecided, like a reckless gambler, to double down and go for broke.\nUnsurprising, then, that when the governor at the last minute decided to\ncancel the expedition, Cortés ignored him and sailed for the mainland with six\nhundred men, offering each an equal share in the expedition’s profits. On\nlanding he burned his boats, effectively staking everything on victory.\n\nLet us skip, then, from the beginning of Díaz’s book to its final chapter.\nThree years later, through some of the most ingenious, ruthless, brilliant,\nand utterly dishonorable behavior by a military leader ever recorded, Cortés\nhad his victory. After eight months of grueling house-to-house warfare and the\ndeath of perhaps a hundred thousand Aztecs, Tenochtitlán, one of the greatest\ncities of the world, lay entirely destroyed. The imperial treasury was\nsecured, and the time had come, then, for it to be divided in shares amongst\nthe surviving soldiers.\n\nYet according to Díaz, the result among the men was outrage. The officers\nconnived to sequester most of the gold, and when the final tally was\nannounced, the troops learned that they would be receiving only fifty to\neighty pesos each. What’s more, the better part of their shares was\nimmediately seized again by the officers in their capacity of creditors—since\nCortés had insisted that the men be billed for any replacement equipment and\nmedical care they had received during the siege. Most found they had actually\nlost money on the deal. Díaz writes:\n\nWe were all very deeply in debt. A crossbow was not to be purchased for less\nthan forty or fifty pesos, a musket cost one hundred, a sword fifty, and a\nhorse from 800 to 1000 pesos, and above. Thus extravagantly did we have to pay\nfor everything! A surgeon, who called himself Mastre Juan, who had tended some\nvery bad wounds, charged wildly inflated fees, and so did a quack named\nMurcia, who was an apothecary and a barber and also treated wounds, and there\nwere thirty other tricks and swindles for which payment was demanded of our\nshares as soon as we received them.\n\nSerious complaints were made about this, and the only remedy that Cortés\nprovided was to appoint two trustworthy persons who knew the prices of goods\nand could value anything that we had bought on credit. An order went out that\nwhatever price was placed on our purchases or the surgeon’s cures must be\naccepted, but that if we had no money, our creditors must wait two years for\npayment.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts017)\n\nSpanish merchants soon arrived charging wildly inflated prices for basic\nnecessities, causing further outrage, until:\n\nOur general becoming weary of the continual reproaches which were thrown out\nagainst him, saying he had stolen everything for himself, and the endless\npetitions for loans and advance in pay, determined at once to get rid of the\nmost troublesome fellows, by forming settlements in those provinces which\nappeared most eligible for this\npurpose.[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts018)\n\nThese were the men who ended up in control of the provinces, and who\nestablished local administration, taxes, and labor regimes. Which makes it a\nlittle easier to understand the descriptions of Indians with their faces\ncovered by names like so many counter-endorsed checks, or the mines surrounded\nby miles of rotting corpses. We are not dealing with a psychology of cold,\ncalculating greed, but of a much more complicated mix of shame and righteous\nindignation, and of the frantic urgency of debts that would only compound and\naccumulate (these were, almost certainly, interest-bearing loans), and outrage\nat the idea that, after all they had gone through, they should be held to owe\nanything to begin with.\n\nAnd what of Cortés? He had just pulled off perhaps the greatest act of theft\nin world history. Certainly, his original debts had now been rendered\ninconsequential. Yet he somehow always seemed to find himself in new ones.\nCreditors were already starting to repossess his holdings while he was off on\nan expedition to Honduras in 1526; on his return, he wrote the Emperor Charles\nV that his expenses were such that “all I have received has been insufficient\nto relive me from misery and poverty, being at the moment I write in debt for\nupwards of five hundred ounces of gold, without possessing a single peso\ntowards it.”[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts019) Disingenuous,\nno doubt (Cortés at the time owned his own personal palace), but only a few\nyears later, he was reduced to pawning his wife’s jewelry to help finance a\nseries of expeditions to California, hoping to restore his fortunes. When\nthose failed to turn a profit, he ended up so besieged by creditors that he\nhad to return to Spain to petition the emperor in\nperson.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts020)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIf all this seems suspiciously reminiscent of the fourth Crusade, with its\nindebted knights stripping whole foreign cities of their wealth and still\nsomehow winding up only one step ahead of their creditors, there is a reason.\nThe financial capital that backed these expeditions came from more or less the\nsame place (if in this case Genoa, not Venice). What’s more, that\nrelationship, between the daring adventurer on the one hand, the gambler\nwilling to take any sort of risk, and on the other, the careful financier,\nwhose entire operations are organized around producing steady, mathematical,\ninexorable growth of income, lies at the very heart of what we now call\n“capitalism.”\n\nAs a result, our current economic system has always been marked by a peculiar\ndual character. Scholars have long been fascinated by Spanish debates that\nensued, in Spanish universities like Santander, about the humanity of the\nIndians (Did they have souls? Could they have legal rights? Was it legitimate\nto forcibly enslave them?), just as they have argued about the real attitudes\nof the conquistadors (was it contempt, revulsion, or even grudging admiration\nfor their adversaries?)[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts021)\nThe real point is that at the key moments of decision, none of this mattered.\nThose making the decisions did not feel they were in control anyway; those who\nwere did not particularly care to know the details. To take a telling example:\nafter the earliest years of the gold and silver mines described by Motolinia,\nwhere millions of Indians were simply rounded up and marched off to their\ndeaths, colonists settled on a policy of debt peonage: the usual trick of\ndemanding heavy taxes, lending money at interest to those who could not pay,\nand then demanding that the loans be repaid with work. Royal agents regularly\nattempted to forbid such practices, arguing that the Indians were now\nChristian and that this violated their rights as loyal subjects of the Spanish\ncrown. But as with almost all such royal efforts to act as protector of the\nIndians, the result was the same. Financial exigencies ended up taking\nprecedence. Charles V himself was deeply in debt to banking firms in Florence,\nGenoa, and Naples, and gold and silver from the Americas made up perhaps one-\nfifth of his total revenue. In the end, despite a lot of initial noise and the\n(usually quite sincere) moral outrage on the part of the king’s emissaries,\nsuch decrees were either ignored or, at best, enforced for a year or two\nbefore being allowed to slip into\nabeyance.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts022)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nAll of this helps explain why the Church had been so uncompromising in its\nattitude toward usury. It was not just a philosophical question; it was a\nmatter of moral rivalry. Money always has the potential to become a moral\nimperative unto itself. Allow it to expand, and it can quickly become a\nmorality so imperative that all others seem frivolous in comparison. For the\ndebtor, the world is reduced to a collection of potential dangers, potential\ntools, and potential\nmerchandise.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts023) Even human\nrelations become a matter of cost-benefit calculation. Clearly this is the way\nthe conquistadors viewed the worlds that they set out to conquer.\n\nIt is the peculiar feature of modern capitalism to create social arrangements\nthat essentially force us to think this way. The structure of the corporation\nis a telling case in point—and it is no coincidence that the first major\njoint-stock corporations in the world were the English and Dutch East India\ncompanies, ones that pursued that very same combination of exploration,\nconquest, and extraction as did the conquistadors. It is a structure designed\nto eliminate all moral imperatives but profit. The executives who make\ndecisions can argue—and regularly do—that, if it were their own money, of\ncourse they would not fire lifelong employees a week before retirement, or\ndump carcinogenic waste next to schools. Yet they are morally bound to ignore\nsuch considerations, because they are mere employees whose only responsibility\nis to provide the maximum return on investment for the company’s stockholders.\n(The stockholders, of course, are not given any say.)\n\nThe figure of Cortés is instructive for another reason. We are speaking of a\nman who, in 1521, had conquered a kingdom and was sitting atop a vast pile of\ngold. Neither did he have any intention of giving it away—even to his\nfollowers. Five years later, he was claiming to be a penniless debtor. How was\nthis possible?\n\nThe obvious answer would be: Cortés was not a king, he was a subject of the\nKing of Spain, living within the legal structure of a kingdom that insisted\nthat, if he were not good at managing his money, he would lose it. Yet as\nwe’ve seen, the king’s laws could be ignored in other cases. What’s more, even\nkings were not entirely free agents. Charles V was continually in debt, and\nwhen his son Philip II—his armies fighting on three different fronts at\nonce—attempted the old Medieval trick of defaulting, all his creditors, from\nthe Genoese Bank of St. George to the German Fuggers and Welsers, closed ranks\nto insist that he would receive no further loans until he started honoring his\ncommitments.[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts024)\n\nCapital, then, is not simply money. It is not even just wealth that can be\nturned into money. But neither is it just the use of political power to help\none use one’s money to make more money. Cortés was trying to do exactly that:\nin classical Axial Age fashion, he was attempting to use his conquests to\nacquire plunder, and slaves to work the mines, with which he could pay his\nsoldiers and suppliers cash to embark on even further conquests. It was a\ntried-and-true formula. But for all the other conquistadors, it provided a\nspectacular failure.\n\nThis would seem to mark the difference. In the Axial Age, money was a tool of\nempire. It might have been convenient for rulers to promulgate markets in\nwhich everyone would treat money as an end in itself; at times, rulers might\nhave even come to see the whole apparatus of government as a profit-making\nenterprise; but money always remained a political instrument. This is why when\nthe empires collapsed and armies were demobilized, the whole apparatus could\nsimply melt away. Under the newly emerging capitalist order, the logic of\nmoney was granted autonomy; political and military power were then gradually\nreorganized around it. True, this was a financial logic that could never have\nexisted without states and armies behind it in the first place. As we have\nseen in the case of Medieval Islam, under genuine free-market conditions—in\nwhich the state is not involved in regulating the market in any significant\nway, even in enforcing commercial contracts—purely competitive markets will\nnot develop, and loans at interest will become effectively impossible to\ncollect. It was _only_ the Islamic prohibition against usury, really, that\nmade it possible for them to create an economic system that stood so far apart\nfrom the state.\n\nMartin Luther was making this very point in 1524, right around the time that\nCortés was first beginning to have trouble with his creditors. It is all very\nwell, Luther said, for us to imagine that all might live as true Christians,\nin accordance with the dictates of the Gospel. But in fact there are few who\nare really capable of acting this way:\n\nChristians are rare in this world; therefore the world needs a strict, hard,\ntemporal government that will compel and constrain the wicked not to rob and\nto return what they borrow, even though a Christian ought not to demand it, or\neven hope to get it back. This is necessary in order that the world not become\na desert, peace may not perish, and trade and society not be utterly\ndestroyed; all of which would happen if we were to rule the world according to\nthe Gospel and not drive and compel the wicked, by laws and the use of force,\nto do what is right … Let no one think that the world can be ruled without\nblood; the sword of the ruler must be red and bloody; for the world will and\nmust be evil, and the sword is God’s rod and vengeance upon\nit.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts025)\n\n“Not to rob and to return what they borrow”—a telling juxtaposition,\nconsidering that in Scholastic theory, lending money at interest had itself\nbeen considered theft.\n\nAnd Luther _was_ referring to interest-bearing loans here. The story of how he\ngot to this point is telling. Luther began his career as a reformer in 1520\nwith fiery campaigns against usury; in fact, one of his objections to the sale\nof Church indulgences was that it was itself a form of spiritual usury. These\npositions won him enormous popular support in towns and villages. However, he\nsoon realized that he’d unleashed a genie that threatened to turn the whole\nworld upside-down. More radical reformers appeared, arguing that the poor were\nnot morally obliged to repay the interest on usurious loans, and proposing the\nrevival of Old Testament institutions like the sabbatical year. They were\nfollowed by outright revolutionary preachers who began once again questioning\nthe very legitimacy of aristocratic privilege and private property. In 1525,\nthe year after Luther’s sermon, there was a massive uprising of peasants,\nminers, and poor townsfolk across Germany: the rebels, in most cases,\nrepresenting themselves as simple Christians aiming to restore the true\ncommunism of the Gospels. Over a hundred thousand were slaughtered. Already in\n1524, Luther had a sense that matters were spilling out of control and that he\nwould have to choose sides: in that text, he did so. Old Testament laws like\nthe Sabbatical year, he argued, are no longer binding; the Gospel merely\ndescribes ideal behavior; humans are sinful creatures, so law is necessary;\nwhile usury is a sin, a four to five-percent rate of interest is currently\nlegal under certain circumstances; and while collecting that interest is\nsinful, under _no_ circumstances is it legitimate to argue that for that\nreason, borrowers have the right to break the\nlaw.[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts026)\n\nThe Swiss Protestant reformer Zwingli was even more explicit. God, he argued,\ngave us the divine law: to love thy neighbor as thyself. If we truly kept this\nlaw, humans would give freely to one another, and private property would not\nexist. However, Jesus excepted, no human being has ever been able to live up\nto this pure communistic standard. Therefore, God has also given us a second,\ninferior, human law, to be enforced by the civil authorities. While this\ninferior law cannot compel us to act as we really ought to act (“the\nmagistrate can force no one to lend out what belongs to him without hope of\nrecompense or profit”)—at least it can make us follow the lead of the apostle\nPaul, who said: “Pay all men what you\nowe.”[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts027)\n\nSoon afterward, Calvin was to reject the blanket ban on usury entirely, and by\n1650, almost all Protestant denominations had come to agree with his position\nthat a reasonable rate of interest (usually five percent) was not sinful,\nprovided the lenders act in good conscience, do not make lending their\nexclusive business, and do not exploit the\npoor.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts028) (Catholic doctrine\nwas slower to come around, but it did ultimately accede by passive\nacquiescence.)\n\nIf one looks at how all this was justified, two things jump out. First,\nProtestant thinkers all continued to make the old Medieval argument about\n_interesse:_ that “interest” is really compensation for the money that the\nlender _would_ have made had he been able to place his money in some more\nprofitable investment. Originally, this logic was just applied to commercial\nloans. Increasingly, it was now applied to all loans. Far from being\nunnatural, then, the growth of money was now treated as completely expected.\nAll money was assumed to be\ncapital.[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts029) Second, the\nassumption that usury is something that one properly practices on one’s\nenemies, and therefore, by extension, that all commerce partakes something of\nthe nature of war, never entirely disappears. Calvin, for instance, denied\nthat Deuteronomy only referred to the Amalekites; clearly, he said, it meant\nthat usury was acceptable when dealing with Syrians or Egyptians; indeed with\nall nations with whom the Jews\ntraded.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts030) The result of\nopening the gates was, at least tacitly, to suggest that one could now treat\n_anyone_ , even a neighbor, as a\nforeigner.[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts031) One need only\nobserve how European merchant adventurers of the day actually were treating\nforeigners, in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, to understand what this might\nmean in practice.\n\nOr, one might look closer to home. Take the story of another well-known debtor\nof the time, the Margrave Casimir of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1481–1527), of the\nfamous Hohenzollern dynasty:\n\nCasimir was the son of Margrave Friedrich the Elder of Brandenburg, who has\ncome to be known as one of the “mad princes” of the German Renaissance.\nSources differ on just how mad he actually was. One contemporary chronicle\ndescribes him as “somewhat deranged in his head from too much racing and\njousting;” most agree that he was given to fits of inexplicable rage, as well\nas to the sponsorship of wild, extravagant festivals, said often to have\ndegenerated into wild bacchanalian\norgies.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts032)\n\nAll agree, however, that he was poor at managing his money. At the beginning\nof 1515, Friedrich was in such financial trouble—he is said to have owed\n200,000 guilders—that he alerted his creditors, mostly fellow nobles, that he\nmight soon be forced to temporarily suspend interest payments on his debts.\nThis seems to have caused a crisis of faith, and within a matter of weeks, his\nson Casimir staged a palace coup—moving, in the early hours of February 26,\n1515, to seize control of the castle of Plassenburg while his father was\ndistracted with the celebration of Carnival, then forcing him to sign papers\nabdicating for reason of mental infirmity. Friedrich spent the rest of his\nlife confined in Plassenburg, denied all visitors and correspondence. When at\none point his guards requested that the new Margrave provide a couple guilders\nso he could pass the time gambling with them, Casimir made a great public show\nof refusal, stating (ridiculously, of course) that his father had left his\naffairs in such disastrous shape that he could not possibly afford\nto.[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts033)\n\nCasimir dutifully doled out governorships and other prize offices to his\nfather’s creditors. He tried to get his house in order, but this proved\nsurprisingly difficult. His enthusiastic embrace of Luther’s reforms in 1521\nclearly had as much to do with the prospect of getting his hands on Church\nlands and monastic assets than with any particular religious fervor. Yet at\nfirst, the disposition of Church property remained moot, and Casimir himself\ncompounded his problems by running up gambling debts of his own said to have\namounted to nearly 50,000\nguilders.[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts034)\n\nPlacing his creditors in charge of the civil administration had predictable\neffects: increasing exactions on his subjects, many of whom became hopelessly\nindebted themselves. Unsurprisingly, Casimir’s lands in the Tauber Valley in\nFranconia became one of the epicenters of the revolt of 1525. Bands of armed\nvillagers assembled, declaring they would obey no law that did not accord with\n“the holy word of God.” At first, the nobles, isolated in their scattered\ncastles, offered little resistance. The rebel leaders—many of them local\nshopkeepers, butchers, and other prominent men from nearby towns—began with a\nlargely orderly campaign of tearing down castle fortifications, their knightly\noccupants being offered guarantees of safety if they cooperated, agreed to\nabandon their feudal privileges, and swore oaths to abide by the rebels’\nTwelve Articles. Many complied. The real venom of the rebels was reserved for\ncathedrals and monasteries, dozens of which were sacked, pillaged, and\ndestroyed.\n\nCasimir’s reaction was to hedge his bets. At first he bided his time,\nassembling an armed force of about two thousand experienced soldiers, but\nrefusing to intervene as rebels pillaged several nearby monasteries; in fact,\nnegotiating with the various rebel bands in such apparent good faith that many\nbelieved he was preparing to join them “as a Christian\nbrother.”[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts035) In May, however,\nafter the knights of the Swabian League defeated the rebels of the Christian\nUnion to the south, Casimir swung into action, his forces brushing aside\npoorly disciplined rebel bands to sweep through his own territories like a\nconquering army, burning and pillaging villages and towns, slaughtering women\nand children. In every town he set up punitive tribunals, and seized all\nlooted property, which he kept, even as his men also expropriated any wealth\nstill to be found in the region’s cathedrals, ostensibly as emergency loans to\npay his troops.\n\nIt seems significant that Casimir was, of all the German princes, both the\nlongest to waver before intervening, and the most savagely vengeful once he\ndid. His forces became notorious not only for executing accused rebels, but\nsystematically chopping off the fingers of accused collaborators, his\nexecutioner keeping a grim ledger of amputated body parts for later\nreimbursement—a kind of carnal inversion of the account ledgers that had\ncaused him so much trouble in his life. At one point, in the town of\nKitzingen, Casimir ordered the gouging out of the eyes of fifty-eight burghers\nwho had, he declared, “refused to look at him as their lord.” Afterward he\nreceived the following\nbill:[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts036)\n\n80 beheaded |   \n---|---  \n69 eyes put out or fingers cut off | 114½ fl.  \nfrom this to deduct |   \nReceived from the Rothenburgers | 10 fl.  \nReceived from Ludwig von Hutten | 2 fl.  \nRemainder |   \nPlus 2 months’ pay at 8 fl. per month | 16 fl.  \nTotal | 118½ fl.  \n  \n[Signed] Augustin, the executioner, who the Kitzingers call “Master Ouch.”\n\nThe repression eventually inspired Casimir’s brother Georg (later known as\n“the Pious”) to write a letter asking him if Casimir was intending to take up\na trade—since, as Georg gently reminded him, he could not very well continue\nto be a feudal overlord if his peasants were all\ndead.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts037)\n\nWith such things happening, it is hardly surprising that men like Thomas\nHobbes came to imagine the basic nature of society as a war of all against\nall, from which only the absolute power of monarchs could save us. At the same\ntime, Casimir’s behavior—combining as it does a general attitude of\nunprincipled, cold-blooded calculation with outbursts of almost inexplicably\nvindictive cruelty—seems, like that of Cortés’s angry foot soldiers when\nunleashed on the Aztec provinces, to embody something essential about the\npsychology of debt. Or, more precisely, perhaps, about the debtor who feels he\nhas done nothing to deserve being placed in his position: the frantic urgency\nof having to convert everything around oneself into money, and rage and\nindignation at having been reduced to the sort of person who would do so.\n\n## Part II:\n\n### The World of Credit and the World of Interest\n\n_Of all the beings that have existence only in the minds of men, nothing is\nmore fantastical and nice than Credit; it is never to be forced; it hangs upon\nopinion; it depends upon our passions of hope and fear; it comes many times\nunsought-for, and often goes away without reason; and once lost, it is hardly\nto be quite recovered_.\n\n—Charles Davenant, 1696  \n  \n\n_He that has lost his credit is dead to the world_.\n\n—English and German Proverb\n\nThe peasants’ visions of communistic brotherhood did not come out of nowhere.\nThey were rooted in real daily experience: of the maintenance of common fields\nand forests, of everyday cooperation and neighborly solidarity. It is out of\nsuch homely experience of everyday communism that grand mythic visions are\nalways built.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts038) Obviously,\nrural communities were also divided, squabbling places, since communities\nalways are—but insofar as they are communities at all, they are necessarily\nfounded on a ground of mutual aid. The same, incidentally, can be said of\nmembers of the aristocracy, who might have fought endlessly over love, land,\nhonor, and religion, but nonetheless still cooperated remarkably well with one\nanother when it really mattered (most of all, when their position as\naristocrats was threatened); just as the merchants and bankers, much as they\ncompeted with one another, managed to close ranks when it really mattered.\nThis is what I refer to as the “communism of the rich,” and it is a powerful\nforce in human history.[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts039)\n\nThe same, as we’ve seen repeatedly, applies to credit. There are always\ndifferent standards for those one considers friends or neighbors. The\ninexorable nature of interest-bearing debt, and the alternately savage and\ncalculating behavior of those enslaved to it, are typical above all of\ndealings between strangers: it’s unlikely that Casimir felt much more kinship\nwith his peasants than Cortés did with the Aztecs (in fact, most likely less,\nsince Aztec warriors were at least aristocrats). Inside the small towns and\nrural hamlets, where the state was mostly far away, Medieval standards\nsurvived intact, and “credit” was just as much a matter of honor and\nreputation as it had ever been. The great untold story of our current age is\nof how these ancient credit systems were ultimately destroyed.\n\nRecent historical research, notably that of Craig Muldrew, who has sifted\nthrough thousands of inventories and court cases from sixteenth- and\nseventeenth-century England, has caused us to revise almost all our old\nassumptions about what everyday economic life at that time was like. Of\ncourse, very little of the American gold and silver that reached Europe\nactually ended up in the pockets of ordinary farmers, mercers, or\nhaberdashers.[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts040) The lion’s\nshare stayed in the coffers of either the aristocracy or the great London\nmerchants, or else in the royal\ntreasury.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts041) Small change was\nalmost nonexistent. As I’ve already pointed out, in the poorer neighborhoods\nof cities or large towns, shopkeepers would issue their own lead, leather, or\nwooden token money; in the sixteenth century this became something of a fad,\nwith artisans and even poor widows producing their own currency as a way to\nmake ends meet.[42](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts042) Elsewhere,\nthose frequenting the local butcher, baker, or shoemaker would simply put\nthings on the tab. The same was true of those attending weekly markets, or\nselling neighbors milk or cheese or candle-wax. In a typical village, the only\npeople likely to pay cash were passing travelers, and those considered riff-\nraff: paupers and ne’er-do-wells so notoriously down on their luck that no one\nwould extend credit to them. Since everyone was involved in selling something,\nhowever just about everyone was both creditor and debtor; most family income\ntook the form of promises from other families; everyone knew and kept count of\nwhat their neighbors owed one another; and every six months or year or so,\ncommunities would held a general public “reckoning,” cancelling debts out\nagainst each other in a great circle, with only those differences then\nremaining when all was done being settled by use of coin or\ngoods.[43](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts043)\n\nThe reason that this upends our assumptions is that we’re used to blaming the\nrise of capitalism on something vaguely called “the market”—the breakup of\nolder systems of mutual aid and solidarity, and the creation of a world of\ncold calculation, where everything had its price. Really, English villagers\nappear to have seen no contradiction between the two. On the one hand, they\nbelieved strongly in the collective stewardship of fields, streams, and\nforests, and the need to help neighbors in difficulty. On the other hand,\nmarkets were seen as a kind of attenuated version of the same principle, since\nthey were entirely founded on trust. Much like the Tiv women with their gifts\nof yams and okra, neighbors assumed they ought to be constantly slightly in\ndebt to one another. At the same time, most seem to have been quite\ncomfortable with the idea of buying and selling, or even with market\nfluctuations, provided it didn’t get to the point of threatening honest\nfamilies’ livelihoods.[44](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts044)\nEven when loans at interest began to be legalized in 1545, that did not ruffle\ntoo many feathers, as long as it took place within that same larger moral\nframework: lending was considered an appropriate vocation, for example, for\nwidows with no other source of income, or as a way for neighbors to share in\nthe profits from some minor commercial venture. William Stout, a Quaker\nmerchant from Lancashire, spoke glowingly of Henry Coward, the tradesman in\nwhose shop he first apprenticed:\n\nMy master then had a full trade of groceries, ironmongerware, and several\nother goods, and very much respected and trusted, not only by the people of\nhis own religious profession, but by all others of all professions and\ncircumstances … His credit was so much, that any who had money to dispose of\nlodged it with him to put out to interest or to make use of\nit.[45](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts045)\n\nIn this world, trust was everything. Most money literally was trust, since\nmost credit arrangements were handshake deals. When people used the word\n“credit,” they referred above all to a reputation for honesty and integrity;\nand a man or woman’s honor, virtue, and respectability, but also, reputation\nfor generosity, decency, and good-natured sociability, were at least as\nimportant considerations when deciding whether to make a loan as were\nassessments of net income.[46](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts046)\nAs a result, financial terms became indistinguishable from moral ones. One\ncould speak of others as “worthies,” as “a woman of high estimation” or “a man\nof no account,” and equally of “giving credit” to someone’s words when one\nbelieves what they say (“credit” is from the same root as “creed” or\n“credibility”), or of “extending credit” to them, when one takes them at their\nword that they will pay one back.\n\nOne should not idealize the situation. This was a highly patriarchal world: a\nman’s wife or daughter’s reputation for chastity was as much a part of his\n“credit” as his own reputation for kindness or piety. What’s more, almost all\npeople below the age of 30, male or female, were employed as servants in\nsomeone else’s household—as farmhands, milkmaids, apprentices—and as such,\nwere of “no account” at\nall.[47](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts047) Finally, those who\nlost credibility in the eyes of the community became, effectively, pariahs,\nand descended into the criminal or semi-criminal classes of rootless laborers,\nbeggars, harlots, cutpurses, hawkers, pedlars, fortune-tellers, minstrels, and\nother such “masterless men” or “women of ill\nrepute.”[48](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts048)\n\nCold cash was employed largely between strangers, or when paying rents,\ntithes, and taxes to landlords, bailiffs, priests, and other superiors. The\nlanded gentry and wealthy merchants, who eschewed handshake deals, would often\nuse cash with one another, especially to pay off bills of exchange drawn on\nLondon markets.[49](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts049) Above all,\ngold and silver were used by the government to purchase arms and pay soldiers,\nand amongst the criminal classes themselves. This meant that coins were most\nlikely to be used both by the sort of people who ran the legal system—the\nmagistrates, constables, and justices of the peace—and by those violent\nelements of society they saw it as their business to control.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nOver time, this led to an increasing disjuncture of moral universes. For most,\nwho tried to avoid entanglement in the legal system just as much as they tried\nto avoid the affairs of soldiers and criminals, debt remained the very fabric\nof sociability. But those who spent their working lives within the halls of\ngovernment and great commercial houses gradually began to develop a very\ndifferent perspective, whereby cash exchange was normal and it was debt that\ncame to be seen as tinged with criminality.\n\nEach perspective turned on a certain tacit theory of the nature of society.\nFor most English villagers, the real font and focus of social and moral life\nwas not so much the church as the local ale-house—and community was embodied\nabove all in the conviviality of popular festivals like Christmas or May Day,\nwith everything that such celebrations entailed: the sharing of pleasures, the\ncommunion of the senses, all the physical embodiment of what was called “good\nneighborhood.” Society was rooted above in the “love and amity” of friends and\nkin, and it found expression in all those forms of everyday communism (helping\nneighbors with chores, providing milk or cheese for old widows) that were seen\nto flow from it. Markets were not seen as contradicting this ethos of mutual\naid. It was, much as it was for Tusi, an extension of mutual aid—and for much\nthe same reason: because it operated entirely through trust and\ncredit.[50](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts050)\n\nEngland might not have produced a great theorist like Tusi, but one can find\nthe same assumptions echoed in most of the Scholastic writers, as for instance\nin Jean Bodin’s _De Republica_ , widely circulated in English translation\nafter 1605. “Amity and friendship,” Bodin wrote, “are the foundation of all\nhuman and civil society”—they constitute that “true, natural justice” on which\nthe whole legal structure of contracts, courts, and even government must\nnecessarily be built.[51](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts051)\nSimilarly, when economic thinkers reflected on the origins of the money, they\nspoke of “trusting, exchanging, and\ntrading.”[52](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts052) It was simply\nassumed that human relations came first.\n\nAs a result, all moral relations came to be conceived as debts. “Forgive us\nour debts”—this was the period, the very end of the Middle Ages, that this\ntranslation of the Lord’s Prayer gained such universal popularity. Sins are\ndebts to God: unavoidable, but perhaps manageable, since at the end of time\nour moral debts and credits will be all canceled out against each other in\nGod’s final Reckoning. The notion of debt inserted itself into even the most\nintimate of human relations. Like the Tiv, Medieval villagers would sometimes\nrefer to “flesh debts,” but the notion was completely different: it referred\nto the right of either partner in a marriage to demand sex from the other,\nwhich in principle either could do whenever he or she desired. The phrase\n“paying one’s debts” thus developed connotations, much as the Roman phrase\n“doing one’s duty” had, centuries before. Geoffrey Chaucer even makes a pun\nout of “tally” (French: _taille_) and “tail” in the Shipman’s Tale, a story\nabout a woman who pays her husband’s debts with sexual favors: “and if so I be\nfaille, I am youre wyf, score it upon my\ntaille.”[53](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts053)\n\nEven London merchants would occasionally appeal to the language of\nsociability, insisting that in the final analysis, all trade is built on\ncredit, and credit is really just an extension of mutual aid. In 1696, for\ninstance, Charles Davenant wrote that even if there were a general collapse of\nconfidence in the credit system, it could not last long, because eventually,\nwhen people reflected on the matter and realized that credit is simply an\nextension of human society,\n\nThey will find, that no trading nation ever did subsist, and carry on its\nbusiness by real stock [that is, just coin and merchandise]; that trust and\nconfidence in each other, are as necessary to link and hold a people together,\nas obedience, love, friendship, or the intercourse of speech. And when\nexperience has taught man how weak he is, depending only on himself, he will\nbe willing to help others, and call upon the assistance of his neighbors,\nwhich of course, by degrees, must set credit again\nafloat.[54](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts054)\n\nDavenant was an unusual merchant (his father was a poet). More typical of his\nclass were men like Thomas Hobbes, whose _Leviathan_ , published in 1651, was\nin many ways an extended attack on the very idea that society is built on any\nsort of prior ties of communal solidarity.\n\nHobbes might be considered the opening salvo of the new moral perspective, and\nit was a devastating one. When _Leviathan_ came out, it’s not clear what\nscandalized its readers more: its relentless materialism (Hobbes insisted that\nhumans were basically machines whose actions could be understood by one single\nprinciple: that they tended to move toward the prospect of pleasure and away\nfrom the prospect of pain), or its resultant cynicism (if love, amity, and\ntrust are such powerful forces, Hobbes asked, why is it that even within our\nfamilies, we lock our most valuable possessions in strongboxes?) Still,\nHobbes’ ultimate argument—that humans, being driven by self-interest, cannot\nbe trusted to treat each other justly of their own accord, and therefore that\nsociety only emerges when they come to realize that it is to their long-term\nadvantage to give up a portion of their liberties and accept the absolute\npower of the King—differed little from arguments that theologians like Martin\nLuther had been making a century earlier. Hobbes simply substituted scientific\nlanguage for biblical\nreferences.[55](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts055)\n\nI want to draw particular attention to the underlying notion of “self-\ninterest.”[56](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts056) It is in a real\nsense the key to the new philosophy. The term first appears in English right\naround Hobbes’ time, and it is, indeed, directly borrowed from _interesse_ ,\nthe Roman law term for interest payments. When it was first introduced, most\nEnglish authors seemed to view the idea that all human life can be explained\nas the pursuit of self-interest as a cynical, foreign, Machiavellian idea, one\nthat sat uncomfortably with traditional English mores. By the eighteenth\ncentury, most in educated society accepted it as simple common sense.\n\nBut why “interest”? Why make a general theory of human motivation out of a\nword that originally meant “penalty for late payment on a loan”?\n\nPart of the term’s appeal was that it derived from bookkeeping. It was\nmathematical. This made it seem objective, even scientific. Saying we are all\nreally pursuing our own self-interest provides a way to cut past the welter of\npassions and emotions that seem to govern our daily existence, and to motivate\nmost of what we actually observe people to do (not only out of love and amity,\nbut also envy, spite, devotion, pity, lust, embarrassment, torpor,\nindignation, and pride) and discover that, despite all this, most really\nimportant decisions are based on the rational calculation of material\nadvantage—which means that they are fairly predictable as well. “Just as the\nphysical world is ruled by the laws of movement,” wrote Helvétius, in a\npassage reminiscent of Lord Shang, “no less is the moral universe ruled by\nlaws of interest.”[57](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts057) And of\ncourse it was on this assumption that all the quadratic equations of economic\ntheory could ultimately be\nbuilt.[58](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts058)\n\nThe problem is that the origin of the concept is not rational at all. Its\nroots are theological, and the theological assumptions underpinning it never\nreally went away. “Self-interest” is first attested to in the writings of the\nItalian historian Francesco Guicciadini (who was, in fact, a friend of\nMachiavelli), around 1510, as a euphemism for St. Augustine’s concept of\n“self-love.” For Augustine, the “love of God” leads us to benevolence toward\nour fellows; self-love, in contrast, refers to the fact that, since the Fall\nof Man, we are cursed by endless, insatiable desires for self-gratification—so\nmuch so that, if left to our own devices, we will necessarily fall into\nuniversal competition, even war. Substituting “interest” for “love” must have\nseemed an obvious move, since the assumption that love is the primary emotion\nwas precisely what authors like Guicciadini were trying to get away from. But\nit kept that same assumption of insatiable desires under the guise of\nimpersonal math, since what is “interest” but the demand that money _never\ncease_ to grow? The same was true when it became the term for investments—“I\nhave a twelve-percent interest in that venture”—it is money placed in the\ncontinual pursuit of\nprofit.[59](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts059) The very idea that\nhuman beings are motivated primarily by “self-interest,” then, was rooted in\nthe profoundly Christian assumption that we are all incorrigible sinners; left\nto our own devices, we will not simply pursue a certain level of comfort and\nhappiness and then stop to enjoy it; we will never cash in the chips, like\nSindbad, let alone question why we need to buy chips to begin with. And as\nAugustine already anticipated, infinite desires in a finite world means\nendless competition, which in turn is why, as Hobbes insisted, our only hope\nof social peace lies in contractual arrangements and strict enforcement by the\napparatus of the state.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe story of the origins of capitalism, then, is not the story of the gradual\ndestruction of traditional communities by the impersonal power of the market.\nIt is, rather, the story of how an economy of credit was converted into an\neconomy of interest; of the gradual transformation of moral networks by the\nintrusion of the impersonal—and often vindictive—power of the state. English\nvillagers in Elizabethan or Stuart times did not like to appeal to the justice\nsystem, even when the law was in their favor—partly on the principle that\nneighbors should work things out with one another, but mainly, because the law\nwas so extraordinarily harsh. Under Elizabeth, for example, the punishment for\nvagrancy (unemployment) was, for first offense, to have one’s ears nailed to a\npillory; for repeat offenders,\ndeath.[60](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts060)\n\nThe same was true of debt law, especially since debts could often, if the\ncreditor was sufficiently vindictive, be treated as a crime. In Chelsea around\n1660,\n\nMargaret Sharples was prosecuted for stealing cloth, “which she had converted\ninto a petticoat for her own wearing,” from Richard Bennett’s shop. Her\ndefense was that she had bargained with Bennett’s servant for the cloth, “but\nhaving not money sufficient in her purse to pay for it, took it away with\npurpose to pay for it so soon as she could: and that she afterwards agreed\nwith Mr Bennett of a price for it.” Bennett confirmed that this was so: after\nagreeing to pay him 22 shillings, Margaret “delivered a hamper with goods in\nit as a pawn for security of the money, and four shillings ninepence in\nmoney.” But “soon after he disliked upon better consideration to hold\nagreement with her: and delivered the hamper and goods back,” and commenced\nformal legal proceedings against\nher.[61](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts061)\n\nAs a result, Margaret Sharples was hanged.\n\nObviously, it was the rare shopkeeper who wished to see even his most\nirritating client on the gallows. Therefore decent people tended to avoid the\ncourts entirely. One of the most interesting discoveries of Craig Muldrew’s\nresearch is that the more time passed, the less true this became.\n\nEven in the late Middle Ages, in the case of really large loans, it was not\nunusual for creditors to lodge claims in local courts—but this was really just\na way of ensuring that there was a public record (remember that most people at\nthe time were illiterate). Debtors were willing to go along with the\nproceedings in part, it would seem, because if there was any interest being\ncharged, it meant that if they did default, the lender was just as guilty in\nthe eyes of the law as they were. Less than one-percent of these cases were\never brought to judgment.[62](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts062)\nThe legalization of interest began to change the nature of the playing field.\nIn the 1580s, when interest-bearing loans began to become common between\nvillagers, creditors also began to insist on the use of signed, legal bonds;\nthis led to such an explosion of appeals to the courts that in many small\ntowns, almost every household seemed to be caught up in debt litigation of\nsome sort or other. Only a tiny proportion of these suits were ever brought to\njudgment, either: the usual expedient was still to rely on the simple threat\nof punishment to encourage debtors to settle out of\ncourt.[63](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts063) Still, as a result,\nthe fear of debtor’s prison—or worse—came to hang over everyone, and\nsociability itself came to take on the color of crime. Even Mr. Coward, the\nkindly shopkeeper, was eventually laid low. His good credit itself became a\nproblem, especially as he felt honor-bound to use it to help the less\nfortunate:\n\nHe also dealt in merchandise with loose partners, and became concerned much\nwith persons of declining circumstances, where neither profit nor credit could\nbe got; and he gave uneasiness to his wife, by his frequenting some houses of\nno good character. And she was a very indolent woman, and drew money privately\nfrom him, and his circumstances became so burdensome that he daily expected to\nbe made a prisoner. Which, with the shame of forfeiting his former reputation,\nit drew him into despair and broke his heart, so that he kept to his house for\nsome time and died of grief and\nshame.[64](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts064)\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising, when one consults contemporary sources about\nwhat those prisons were like, particularly for those who were not of\naristocratic origins. Mr. Coward would surely have known, as the conditions at\nthe most notorious, like Fleet and Marshalsea, caused periodic scandals when\nexposed in parliament or the popular press, filling the papers with stories of\nshackled debtors “covered with filth and vermin, and suffered to die, without\npity, of hunger and jail fever,” as the aristocratic roués placed in the elite\nside of the same jails lived lives of comfort, visited by manicurists and\nprostitutes.[65](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts065)\n\nThe criminalization of debt, then, was the criminalization of the very basis\nof human society. It cannot be overemphasized that in a small community,\neveryone normally was both lender and borrower. One can only imagine the\ntensions and temptations that must have existed in a communities—and\ncommunities, much though they are based on love, in fact, _because_ they are\nbased on love, will always also be full of hatred, rivalry and passion—when it\nbecame clear that with sufficiently clever scheming, manipulation, and perhaps\na bit of strategic bribery, they could arrange to have almost anyone they\nhated imprisoned or even hanged. What was it that Richard Bennett really had\nagainst Margaret Sharples? We’ll never know the back-story, but it’s a pretty\nsafe bet that there was one. The effects on communal solidarity must have been\ndevastating. The sudden accessibility of violence really did threaten to\ntransform what had been the essence of sociality into a war of all against\nall.[66](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts066) It’s not surprising\nthen, that by the eighteenth century, the very notion of personal credit had\nacquired a bad name, with both lenders and borrowers considered equally\nsuspect.[67](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts067) The use of\ncoins—at least among those who had access to them—had come to seem moral in\nitself.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nUnderstanding all this allows us to see some of the European authors\nconsidered in earlier chapters in an entirely new light. Take Panurge’s\nencomium on debt: it turns out that the real joke is not the suggestion that\ndebt ties communities together (any English or French peasant of the day would\nhave simply assumed this), or even that _only_ debt ties communities together;\nit is putting the sentiment in the mouth of a wealthy scholar who’s really an\ninveterate criminal—that is, holding up popular morality as a mirror to make\nfun of the very upper classes who claimed to disapprove of it. Or consider\nAdam Smith:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that\nwe expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address\nourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to\nthem of our own necessities but of their\nadvantages.[68](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts068)\n\nThe bizarre thing here is that, at the time Smith was writing, this simply\nwasn’t true.[69](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts069) Most English\nshopkeepers were still carrying out the main part of their business on credit,\nwhich meant that customers appealed to their benevolence all the time. Smith\ncould hardly have been unaware of this. Rather, he is drawing a utopian\npicture. He wants to imagine a world in which everyone used cash, in part\nbecause he agreed with the emerging middle-class opinion that the world would\nbe a better place if everyone really did conduct themselves this way, and\navoid confusing and potentially corrupting ongoing entanglements. We should\nall just pay the money, say “please” and “thank you,” and leave the store.\nWhat’s more, he uses this utopian image to make a larger point: that even if\nall businesses operated like the great commercial companies, with an eye only\nto self-interest, it wouldn’t matter. Even the “natural selfishness and\nrapacity” of the rich, with all their “vain and insatiable desires” will\nstill, through the logic of the invisible hand, lead to the benefit of\nall.[70](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts070)\n\nIn other words, Smith simply imagined the role of consumer credit in his own\nday, just as he had his account of the origins of\nmoney.[71](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts071) This allowed him to\nignore the role of both benevolence _and_ malevolence in economic affairs;\nboth the ethos of mutual aid that forms the necessary foundation of anything\nthat would look like a free market (that is, one which is not simply created\nand maintained by the state), _and_ the violence and sheer vindictiveness that\nhad actually gone into creating the competitive, self-interested markets that\nhe was using as his model.\n\nNietzsche, in turn, was taking up Smith’s premises, that life is exchange, but\nlaying bare everything (the torture, murder, mutilation) that Smith preferred\nnot to have to talk about. Now that we have seen just a little of the social\ncontext, it’s difficult to read Nietzsche’s otherwise puzzling descriptions of\nancient hunters and herdsmen keeping accounts of debts and demanding each\nothers’ eyes and fingers without immediately thinking of Casimir’s\nexecutioner, who actually did present his master with a bill for gouged eyes\nand severed fingers. What he is really describing is what it took to produce a\nworld in which the son of a prosperous middle-class reverend, such as himself,\ncould simply assume that all human life is premised on calculated, self-\ninterested exchange.\n\n## Part III:\n\n### Impersonal Credit-money\n\nOne reason that historians took so long to notice the elaborate popular-credit\nsystems of Tudor and Stuart England is that intellectuals of the time spoke\nabout money in the abstract; they rarely mentioned it. For the educated\nclasses, “money” soon came to mean gold and silver. Most wrote as if it could\nbe taken for granted that gold and silver had always been used as money for\nall nations in history and, presumably, always would be.\n\nThis not only flew in the face of Aristotle; it directly contradicted the\ndiscoveries of European explorers of the time, who were finding shell money,\nbead money, feather money, salt money, and an endless variety of other\ncurrencies everywhere they\nwent.[72](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts072) Yet all this just\ncaused economic thinkers to dig in their heels. Some appealed to alchemy to\nargue that the monetary status of gold and silver had a natural basis: gold\n(which partook of the sun) and silver (which partook of the moon) were the\nperfected, eternal forms of metal toward which all baser metals tend to\nevolve.[73](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts073) Most, however,\ndidn’t feel that much explanation was required; the intrinsic value of\nprecious metals was simply self-evident. As a result, when royal advisors or\nLondon pamphleteers discussed economic problems, the issues they debated were\nalways the same: How do we keep bullion from leaving the country? What do we\ndo about the crippling shortage of coin? For most, questions like “How do we\nmaintain trust in local credit systems?” simply did not arise.\n\nThis was even more extreme in Britain than on the Continent, where “crying up”\nor “crying down” the currency was still an option. In Britain, after a\ndisastrous attempt at devaluation under the Tudors, such expedients were\nabandoned. Henceforth, debasement became a moral issue. For the government to\nmix base metal into the pure eternal substance of a coin was clearly wrong.\nSo, to a lesser extent, was coin-clipping, a near-universal practice in\nEngland, which might be thought of as a kind of popular version of\ndevaluation, since it involved secretly shaving silver off the edges of coins\nand then pressing them down so they seemed like they were still the original\nsize.\n\nWhat’s more, those new forms of virtual money that began to emerge in the new\nage were firmly rooted in these same assumptions. This is critical, because it\nhelps explain what might otherwise seem a bizarre contradiction: How is it\nthat this age of ruthless materialism, in which the notion that money was a\nsocial convention was definitively rejected, also saw the rise of paper money,\nalong with a whole host of new credit instruments and forms of financial\nabstraction that have become so typical of modern capitalism? True, most of\nthese—checks, bonds, stocks, annuities—had their origins in the metaphysical\nworld of the Middle Ages. Yet in this new age, they underwent an enormous\nefflorescence.\n\nIf one looks at the actual history, though, it quickly becomes clear that all\nof these new forms of money in no way undermined the assumption that money was\nfounded on the “intrinsic” value of gold and silver: in fact, they reinforced\nit. What seems to have happened is that, once credit became unlatched from\nreal relations of trust between individuals (whether merchants or villagers),\nit became apparent that money could, in effect, be produced simply by saying\nit was there; but that, when this is done in the amoral world of a competitive\nmarketplace, it would almost inevitably lead to scams and confidence games of\nevery sort—causing the guardians of the system to periodically panic, and seek\nnew ways to latch the value of the various forms of paper back onto gold and\nsilver.\n\nThis is the story normally told as “the origins of modern banking.” From our\nperspective, though, what it reveals is just how closely bound together war,\nbullion, and these new credit instruments were. One need only consider the\npaths _not_ traveled. For instance: there was no intrinsic reason why a bill\nof exchange couldn’t be endorsed over to a third party, then become generally\ntransferable—thus, in effect turning it into a form of paper money. This is\nhow paper money first emerged in China. In Medieval Europe there were periodic\nmovements in that direction, but for a variety of reasons, they did not go\nfar.[74](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts074) Alternately, bankers\ncan produce money by issuing book credits for more than they have on cash\nreserve. This is considered the very essence of modern banking, and it can\nlead to the circulation of private bank\nnotes.[75](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts075) Some moves were\nmade in this direction as well, especially in Italy, but it was a risky\nproposition, since there was always the danger of depositors panicking and\nmaking a run, and most Medieval governments threatened extremely harsh\npenalties on bankers unable to make restitution in such cases: as witnessed by\nthe example of Francesch Castello, beheaded in front of his own bank in\nBarcelona in 1360.[76](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts076)\n\nWhere bankers effectively controlled Medieval governments, it proved safer and\nmore profitable to manipulate the government’s own finances. The history of\nmodern financial instruments, and the ultimate origins of paper money, really\nbegin with the issuing of municipal bonds—a practice begun by the Venetian\ngovernment in the twelfth century when, needing a quick infusion of income for\nmilitary purposes, it levied a compulsory loan on its taxpaying citizens, for\nwhich it promised each of them five percent annual interest, and allowed the\n“bonds” or contracts to become negotiable, thus, creating a market in\ngovernment debt. They [the Venetian government?] tended to be quite meticulous\nabout interest payments, but since the bonds had no specific date of maturity,\ntheir market prices often fluctuated wildly with the city’s political and\nmilitary fortunes, and so did resulting assessments of the likelihood that\nthey would be able to be repaid. Similar practices quickly spread to the other\nItalian states and to northern European merchant enclaves as well: the United\nProvinces of Holland financed their long war of independence against the\nHapsburgs (1568–1648) largely through a series of forced loans, though they\nfloated numerous voluntary bond issues as\nwell.[77](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts077)\n\nForcing taxpayers to make a loan is, in one sense, simply demanding that they\npay their taxes early; but when the Venetian state first agreed to pay\ninterest—and in legal terms, this was again _interesse_ , a penalty for late\npayment—it was in principle penalizing itself for not immediately giving the\nmoney back. It’s easy to see how this might raise all sorts of questions about\nthe legal and moral relation between people and government. Ultimately, the\ncommercial classes in those mercantile republics that pioneered these new\nforms of financing did end up seeing themselves as owning the government more\nthan they saw themselves as being in its debt. Not only the commercial\nclasses: by 1650, a majority of Dutch households held at least a little\ngovernment debt.[78](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts078) However,\nthe true paradox only appears when one begins to “monetize” this debt—that is,\nto take government promises to pay and allow them to circulate as currency.\n\nWhile already by the sixteenth century, merchants were using bills of exchange\nto settle debts, government debt bonds— _rentes, juros_ , annuities—were the\nreal credit money of the new age. It’s here that we have to look for the real\norigins of the “price revolution” that hammered once-independent townsfolk and\nvillagers into the ground and opened the way for most of them to ultimately be\nreduced to wage laborers, working for those who had access to these higher\nforms of credit. Even in Seville, where the treasure fleets from the New World\nfirst touched port in the Old, bullion was not much used in day-to-day\ntransactions. Most of it was taken directly to the warehouses of Genoese\nbankers operating from the port and stored for shipment east. But in the\nprocess, it became the basis for complex credit schemes whereby the value of\nthe bullion was loaned to the emperor to fund military operations, in exchange\nfor papers entitling the bearer to interest-bearing annuities from the\ngovernment—papers that could in turn be traded as if they were money. By such\nmeans, bankers could almost endlessly multiply the actual value of gold and\nsilver they held. Already in the 1570s, we hear of fairs in places like Medina\ndel Campo, not far from Seville, that had become “veritable factories of\ncertificates,” with transactions carried out exclusively through\npaper.[79](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts079) Since whether the\nSpanish government would actually pay their debts, or how regularly, were\nalways slightly uncertain, the bills would tend to circulate at a\ndiscount—especially as _juros_ began circulating throughout the rest of\nEurope—causing continual\ninflation.[80](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts080)\n\nIt was only with the creation of the Bank of England in 1694 that one can\nspeak of genuine paper money, since its banknotes were in no sense bonds. They\nwere rooted, like all the others, in the king’s war debts. This can’t be\nemphasized enough. The fact that money was no longer a debt owed _to_ the\nking, but a debt owed _by_ the king, made it very different than what it had\nbeen before. In many ways it had become a mirror image of older forms of\nmoney.\n\nThe reader will recall that the Bank of England was created when a consortium\nof forty London and Edinburgh merchants—mostly already creditors to the\ncrown—offered King William III a £1.2 million loan to help finance his war\nagainst France. In doing so, they also convinced him to allow them in return\nto form a corporation with a monopoly on the issuance of banknotes—which were,\nin effect, promissory notes for the money the king now owed them. This was the\nfirst independent national central bank, and it became the clearinghouse for\ndebts owed between smaller banks; the notes soon developed into the first\nEuropean national paper currency. Yet the great public debate of the time, a\ndebate about the very nature of money, was about not paper but metal. The\n1690s were a time of crisis for British coinage. The value of silver had risen\nso high that new British coins (the mint had recently developed the “milled\nedge” familiar from coins nowadays, which made them clip-proof) were actually\nworth less than their silver content, with predictable results. Proper silver\ncoins vanished; all that remained in circulation were the old clipped ones,\nand these were becoming increasingly scarce. Something had to be done. A war\nof pamphlets ensued, which came to a head in 1695, one year after the founding\nof the bank. Charles Davenant’s essay on credit, which I’ve already cited, was\nactually part of this particular pamphlet-war: he proposed that Britain move\nto a pure credit money based on public trust, and he was ignored. The Treasury\nproposed to call in the coinage and reissue it at a 20- to 25-percent lower\nweight, so as to bring it back below the market price for silver. Many who\nsupported this position took explicitly Chartalist positions, insisting that\nsilver has no intrinsic value anyway, and that money is simply a measure\nestablished by the state.[81](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts081)\nThe man who won the argument, however, was John Locke, the Liberal\nphilosopher, at that time acting as advisor to Sir Isaac Newton, then Warden\nof the Mint. Locke insisted that one can no more make a small piece of silver\nworth more by relabeling it a “shilling” than one can make a short man taller\nby declaring there are now fifteen inches in a foot. Gold and silver had a\nvalue recognized by everyone on earth; the government stamp simply attested to\nthe weight and purity of a coin, and—as he added in words veritably shivering\nwith indignation—for governments to tamper with this for their own advantage\nwas just as criminal as the coin-clippers themselves:\n\nThe use and end of the public stamp is only to be a guard and voucher of the\nquality of silver which men contract for; and the injury done to the public\n_faith_ , in this point, is that which in clipping and false coining heightens\nthe _robbery_ into _treason.[\n82](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts082)_\n\nTherefore, he argued, the only recourse was to recall the currency and\nrestrike it at exactly the same value that it had before.\n\nThis was done, and the results were disastrous. In the years immediately\nfollowing, there was almost no coinage in circulation; prices and wages\ncollapsed; there was hunger and unrest. Only the wealthy were insulated, since\nthey were able to take advantage of the new credit money, trading back and\nforth portions of the king’s debt in the form of banknotes. The value of these\nnotes, too, fluctuated a bit at first, but eventually stabilized once they\nwere made redeemable in precious metals. For the rest, the situation only\nreally improved once paper money, and, eventually, smaller-denomination\ncurrency, became more widely available. The reforms proceeded top-down, and\nvery slowly, but they did proceed, and they gradually came to create the world\nwhere even ordinary, everyday transactions with butchers and bakers were\ncarried out in polite, impersonal terms, with small change, and therefore it\nbecame possible to imagine everyday life itself as a matter of self-interested\ncalculation.\n\nIt’s easy enough to see why Locke would adopt the position that he did. He was\na scientific materialist. For him, “faith” in government—as in the quote\nabove—was not the citizens’ belief that the government will keep its promises,\nbut simply that it won’t lie to them; that it would, like a good scientist,\ngive them accurate information, and who wanted to see human behavior as\nfounded in natural laws that—like the laws of physics that Newton had so\nrecently described—were higher than those of any mere government. The real\nquestion is why the British government agreed with him and resolutely stuck to\nthis position despite all the immediate disasters. Soon afterward, in fact,\nBritain adopted the gold standard (in 1717) and the British Empire maintained\nit, and with it the notion that gold and silver _were_ money, down to its\nfinal days.\n\nTrue, Locke’s materialism also came to be broadly accepted—even to be the\nwatchword of the age.[83](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts083)\nMainly, though, the reliance on gold and silver seemed to provide the only\ncheck on the dangers involved with the new forms of credit-money, which\nmultiplied very quickly—especially once ordinary banks were allowed to create\nmoney too. It soon became apparent that financial speculation, unmoored from\nany legal or community constraints, was capable of producing results that\nseemed to verge on insanity. The Dutch Republic, which pioneered the\ndevelopment of stock markets, had already experienced this in the tulip mania\nof 1637—the first of a series of speculative “bubbles,” as they came to be\nknown, in which future prices would first be bid through the ceiling by\ninvestors and then collapse. A whole series of such bubbles hit the London\nmarkets in the 1690s, in almost every case built around a new joint-stock\ncorporation formed, in imitation of the East India Company, around some\nprospective colonial venture. The famous South Sea Bubble in 1720—in which a\nnewly formed trading company, granted a monopoly of trade with the Spanish\ncolonies, bought up a considerable portion of the British national debt and\nsaw its shares briefly skyrocket before collapsing in ignominy—was only the\nculmination. Its collapse was followed the next year by the collapse of John\nLaw’s famous Banque Royale in France, another central-bank experiment—similar\nto the Bank of England—that grew so quickly that within a few years it had\nabsorbed all the French colonial trading companies, and most of the French\ncrown’s own debt, issuing its own paper money, before crashing into\nnothingness in 1721, sending its chief executive fleeing for his life. In each\ncase, this was followed by legislation: in Britain, to forbid the creation of\nnew joint-stock companies (other than for the building of turnpikes and\ncanals), and in France, to eliminate paper money based in government debt\nentirely.\n\nIt’s unsurprising, then, that Newtonian economics (if we may call it that)—the\nassumption that one cannot simply create money, or even, really, tinker with\nit—came to be accepted by almost everyone. There had to be some solid,\nmaterial foundation to all this, or the entire system would go insane. True,\neconomists were to spend centuries arguing about what that foundation might be\n(was it really gold, or was it land, human labor, the utility or desirability\nof commodities in general?) but almost no one returned to anything like the\nAristotelian view.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nAnother way to look at this might be to say that the new age came to be\nincreasingly uncomfortable with the political nature of money. Politics, after\nall, is the art of persuasion; the political is that dimension of social life\nin which things really do become true if enough people believe them. The\nproblem is that in order to play the game effectively, one can never\nacknowledge this: it may be true that, if I could convince everyone in the\nworld that I was the King of France, I would in fact become the King of\nFrance; but it would never work if I were to admit that this was the only\nbasis of my claim. In this sense, politics is very similar to magic—one reason\nboth politics and magic tend, just about everywhere, to be surrounded by a\ncertain halo of fraud. These suspicions were widely vaunted at the time. In\n1711, the satirical essayist Joseph Addison penned a little fantasy about the\nBank of England’s—and as a result, the British monetary system’s—dependence on\npublic faith in the political stability of the throne. (The Act of Settlement\nof 1701 was the bill that guaranteed the royal succession, and a sponge was a\npopular symbol for default). In a dream, he said,\n\nI saw Public Credit, set on her throne in the Grocer’s Hall, the Great Charter\nover her head, the Act of Settlement full in her view. Her touch turned\neverything to gold. Behind her seat, bags filled with coin were piled up to\nthe ceiling. On her right the door flies open. The Pretender rushes in, a\nsponge in one hand, and in the other a sword, which he shakes at the Act of\nSettlement. The beautiful Queen sinks down fainting. The spell by which she\nhas turned all things around her into treasure is broken. The money bags\nshrink like pricked bladders. The piles of gold pieces are turned into bundles\nof rags or faggots of wooden\ntallies.[84](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts084)\n\nIf one does not believe in the king, then the money vanishes with him.\n\nThus kings, magicians, markets, and alchemists all fused in the public\nimagination during this era, and we still talk about the “alchemy” of the\nmarket, or “financial magicians.” In Goethe’s _Faust_ (1808), he actually has\nhis hero—in his capacity as alchemist-magician—pay a visit to the Holy Roman\nEmperor. The Emperor is sinking under the weight of endless debts that he has\npiled up paying for the extravagant pleasures of his court. Faust, and his\nassistant, Mephistopheles, convince him that he can pay off his creditors by\ncreating paper money. It’s represented as an act of pure prestidigitation.\n“You have plenty of gold lying somewhere underneath your lands,” notes Faust.\n“Just issue notes promising your creditors you’ll give it to them later. Since\nno one knows how much gold there really is, there’s no limit to how much you\ncan promise.”[85](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts085)\n\nThis kind of magical language almost never appears in the Middle\nAges.[86](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts086) It would appear that\nit’s only in a resolutely materialist age that this ability to simply produce\nthings by saying that they are there comes to be seen as a scandalous, even\ndiabolical. And the surest sign that one has entered such a materialist age is\nprecisely the fact that it is seen so. We have already observed Rabelais, at\nthe very beginning of the age, reverting to language almost identical to that\nused by Plutarch when he railed against moneylenders in Roman times—“laughing\nat those natural philosophers who hold that nothing can be made of nothing,”\nas they manipulate their books and ledgers to demand back money they never\nactually had. Panurge just turned it around: no, it’s by borrowing that I make\nsomething out of nothing, and become a kind of god.\n\nBut consider the following lines, often attributed to Lord Josiah Charles\nStamp, director of the Bank of England:\n\nThe modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is\nperhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented.\nBanking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the earth; take\nit away from them, but leave them with the power to create credit, and with\nthe stroke of a pen they will create enough money to buy it back again … If\nyou wish to remain slaves of Bankers, and pay the cost of your own slavery,\nlet them continue to create\ndeposits.[87](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts087)\n\nIt seems extremely unlikely that Lord Stamp ever really said this, but the\npassage has been cited endlessly—in fact, it’s probably the single most often-\nquoted passage by critics of the modern banking system. However apocryphal, it\nclearly strikes a chord, and apparently for the same reason: bankers are\ncreating something out of nothing. They are not only frauds and magicians.\nThey are evil, because they’re playing God.\n\nBut there’s a deeper scandal than mere prestidigitation. If Medieval moralists\ndid not raise such objections, it was not just because they were comfortable\nwith metaphysical entities. They had a much more fundamental problem with the\nmarket: greed. Market motives were held to be inherently corrupt. The moment\nthat greed was validated, and unlimited profit was considered a perfectly\nviable end in itself, this political, magical element became a genuine\nproblem, because it meant that even those actors—the brokers, stock-jobbers,\ntraders—who effectively made the system run had no convincing loyalty to\nanything, even to the system itself.\n\nHobbes, who first developed this vision of human nature into an explicit\ntheory of society, was well aware of this greed dilemma. It formed the basis\nof his political philosophy. Even, he argued, if we are all rational enough to\nunderstand that it’s in our long-term interest to live in peace and security,\nour short-term interests are often such that killing and plundering are the\nmost obviously profitable courses to take, and all it takes is a few to cast\naside their scruples to create utter insecurity and chaos. This was why he\nfelt that markets could only exist under the aegis of an absolutist state,\nwhich would force us to keep our promises and respect one another’s property.\nBut what happens when we’re talking about a market in which it is state debts\nand state obligations themselves that are being traded; when one cannot really\nspeak of a state monopoly on force because one is operating in an\ninternational market where the primary currency is bonds that the state\ndepends on for its very ability to marshal military force?\n\nHaving made incessant war on all remaining forms of the communism of the poor,\neven to the point of criminalizing credit, the masters of the new market\nsystem discovered that they had no obvious justification left to maintain even\nthe communism of the rich—that level of cooperation and solidarity required to\nkeep the economic system running. True, for all its endless strains and\nperiodic breakdowns, the system has held out so far. But as recent events have\ndramatically testified, it has never been resolved.\n\n## Part IV:\n\n### So What Is Capitalism, Anyway?\n\nWe are used to seeing modern capitalism (along with modern traditions of\ndemocratic government) as emerging only later: with the Age of Revolutions—the\nindustrial revolution, the American and French revolutions—a series of\nprofound breaks at the end of the eighteenth century that only became fully\ninstitutionalized after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Here we come face to\nface with a peculiar paradox. It would seem that almost all elements of\nfinancial apparatus that we’ve come to associate with capitalism—central\nbanks, bond markets, short-selling, brokerage houses, speculative bubbles,\nsecurization, annuities—came into being not only before the science of\neconomics (which is perhaps not too surprising), but also before the rise of\nfactories, and wage labor\nitself.[88](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts088) This is a genuine\nchallenge to familiar ways of thinking. We like to think of the factories and\nworkshops as the “real economy,” and the rest as superstructure, constructed\non top of it. But if this were really so, then how can it be that the\nsuperstructure came first? Can the dreams of the system create its body?\n\nAll this raises the question of what “capitalism” is to begin with, a question\non which there is no consensus at all. The word was originally invented by\nsocialists, who saw capitalism as that system whereby those who own capital\ncommand the labor of those who do not. Proponents, in contrast, tend to see\ncapitalism as the freedom of the marketplace, which allows those with\npotentially marketable visions to pull resources together to bring those\nvisions into being. Just about everyone agrees, however, that capitalism is a\nsystem that demands constant, endless growth. Enterprises have to grow in\norder to remain viable. The same is true of nations. Just as five percent per\nannum was widely accepted, at the dawn of capitalism, as the legitimate\ncommercial rate of interest—that is, the amount that any investor could\nnormally expect her money to be growing by the principle of _interesse_ —so is\nfive percent now the annual rate at which any nation’s GDP really ought to\ngrow. What was once an impersonal mechanism that compelled people to look at\neverything around them as a potential source of profit has come to be\nconsidered the only objective measure of the health of the human community\nitself.\n\nStarting from our baseline date of 1700, then, what we see at the dawn of\nmodern capitalism is a gigantic financial apparatus of credit and debt that\noperates—in practical effect—to pump more and more labor out of just about\neveryone with whom it comes into contact, and as a result produces an\nendlessly expanding volume of material goods. It does so not just by moral\ncompulsion, but above all by using moral compulsion to mobilize sheer physical\nforce. At every point, the familiar but peculiarly European entanglement of\nwar and commerce reappears—often in startling new forms. The first stock\nmarkets in Holland and Britain were based mainly in trading shares of the East\nand West India companies, which were both military and trading ventures. For a\ncentury, one such private, profit-seeking corporation governed India. The\nnational debts of England, France, and the others were based in money borrowed\nnot to dig canals and erect bridges, but to acquire the gunpowder needed to\nbombard cities and to construct the camps required for the holding of\nprisoners and the training of recruits. Almost all the bubbles of the\neighteenth century involved some fantastic scheme to use the proceeds of\ncolonial ventures to pay for European wars. Paper money was debt money, and\ndebt money was war money, and this has always remained the case. Those who\nfinanced Europe’s endless military conflicts also employed the government’s\npolice and prisons to extract ever-increasing productivity from the rest of\nthe population.\n\nAs everybody knows, the world market system initiated by the Spaniards and\nPortuguese empires first arose in the search for spices. It soon settled into\nthree broad trades, which might be labeled the arms trade, the slave trade,\nand the drug trade. The last refers mostly to soft drugs, of course, like\ncoffee, tea, and the sugar to put in them, and tobacco, but distilled liquor\nfirst appears at this stage of human history as well, and as we all know,\nEuropeans had no compunctions about aggressively marketing opium in China as a\nway of finally putting an end to the need to export bullion. The cloth trade\nonly came later, after the East India Company used military force to shut down\nthe (more efficient) Indian cotton export trade. One need only take a glance\nat the book that preserves Charles Davenant’s 1696 essay on credit and human\nfellowship: _The political and commercial works of that celebrated writer\nCharles D’Avenant: relating to the trade and revenue of England, the\nPlantation trade, the East-India trade and African trade_. “Obedience, love,\nand friendship” might suffice to govern relations between fellow Englishmen,\nthen, but in the colonies, it was mainly just obedience.\n\nAs I’ve described, the Atlantic slave trade can be imagined as a giant chain\nof debt-obligations, stretching from Bristol to Calabar to the headwaters of\nthe Cross River, where the Aro traders sponsored their secret societies; just\nas in the Indian Ocean trade, similar chains connected Utrecht to Capetown to\nJakarta to the Kingdom of Gelgel, where Balinese kings arranged their\ncockfights to lure their own subjects to gamble their freedom away. In either\ncase, the end product was the same: human beings so entirely ripped from their\ncontexts, and hence so thoroughly dehumanized, that they were placed outside\nthe realm of debt entirely.\n\nThe middlemen in these chains, the various commercial links of the debt chain\nthat connected the stock-jobbers in London with the Aro priests in Nigeria,\npearl divers in the Aru islands of Eastern Indonesia, Bengali tea plantations,\nor Amazonian rubber-tappers, give one the impression of having been sober,\ncalculating, unimaginative men. At either end of the debt chain, the whole\nenterprise seemed to turn on the ability to manipulate fantasies, and to run a\nconstant peril of slipping into what even contemporary observers considered\nvarieties of phantasmagoric madness. On the one end were the periodic bubbles,\npropelled in part by rumor and fantasy and in part by the fact that just about\neveryone in cities like Paris and London with any disposable cash would\nsuddenly become convinced that they would somehow be able to profit from the\nfact that everyone else was succumbing to rumor and fantasy.\n\nCharles MacKay has left us some immortal descriptions of the first of these,\nthe famous “South Sea Bubble” of 1710. Actually, the South Sea Company itself\n(which grew so large that at one point it bought up most of the national debt)\nwas just the anchor for what happened, a giant corporation, its stock\nconstantly ballooning in value, that seemed, to put it in contemporary terms,\n“too big to fail.” It soon became the model for hundreds of new start-up\nofferings:\n\nInnumerable joint-stock companies started up everywhere. They soon received\nthe name Bubbles, the most appropriate imagination could devise … Some of them\nlasted a week or a fortnight, and were no more heard of, while others could\nnot even live out that span of existence. Every evening produced new schemes,\nand every morning new projects. The highest of the aristocracy were as eager\nin this hot pursuit of gain as the most plodding jobber in\nCornhill.[89](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts089)\n\nThe author lists, as arbitrary examples, eighty-six schemes, ranging from the\nmanufacture of soap or sailcloth, the provision of insurance for horses, to a\nmethod to “make deal-boards out of sawdust.” Each issued stock; each issue\nwould appear, then be scooped up and avidly traded back and forth in taverns,\ncoffee-houses, alleys, and haberdasheries across the city. In every case their\nprice was quickly bid through the ceiling—each new buyer betting, effectively,\nthat he or she could unload them to some even more gullible sucker before the\ninevitable collapse. Sometimes people bid on cards and coupons that would\nallow them no more than the right to bid on other shares later. Thousands grew\nrich. Thousands more were ruined.\n\nThe most absurd and preposterous of all, and which shewed, more completely\nthan any other, the utter madness of the people, was one started by an unknown\nadventurer, entitled “A _company for the carrying on of an undertaking of\ngreat advantage, but nobody to know what it is.”_\n\nThe man of genius who essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public\ncredulity merely stated in his prospectus that the required capital was half a\nmillion, in five thousand shares of 1001. each, deposit 21. per share. Each\nsubscriber, paying his deposit, would be entitled to 1001. per annum per\nshare. How this immense profit was to be obtained, he would not condescend to\ninform them at that time, but promised that in a month the full particulars\nwould be duly announced, and call made for the remaining 981. of the\nsubscription. Next morning, at nine o’clock, this great man opened an office\nin Cornhill. Crowds beset his door, and when he shut up at three o’clock, he\nfound that no less than one thousand shares had been subscribed for, and the\ndeposits paid.\n\nHe was philosopher enough to be contented with his venture, and set off that\nsame evening for the Continent. He was never heard of\nagain.[90](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts090)\n\nIf one is to believe MacKay, the entire population of London conceived the\nsimultaneous delusion, not that money could really be manufactured out of\nnothing, but that other people were foolish enough to believe that it\ncould—and that, by that very fact, they actually could make money out of\nnothing after all.\n\nMoving to the other side of the debt chain, we find fantasies ranging from the\ncharming to the apocalyptic. In the anthropological literature, there is\neverything from the beautiful “sea wives” of Aru pearl divers, who will not\nyield up the treasures of the ocean unless courted with gifts bought on credit\nfrom local Chinese shops,[91](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts091)\nto the secret markets where Bengali landlords purchase ghosts to terrorize\ninsubordinate debt peons; to Tiv flesh-debts, a fantasy of human society\ncannibalizing itself; to finally, occasions at which, the Tiv nightmare\nappears to have very nearly become\ntrue.[92](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts092) One the most famous\nand disturbing was the great Putumayo scandal of 1909–1911, in which the\nLondon reading public was shocked to discover that the agents of the\nsubsidiary of a British rubber company operating in the Peruvian rainforest\nhad created their very own Heart of Darkness, exterminating tens of thousands\nof Huitoto Indians—who the agents insisted on referring to only as\n“cannibals”—in scenes of rape, torture, and mutilation that recalled the very\nworst of the conquest four hundred years\nearlier.[93](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts093)\n\nIn the debates that followed, the first impulse was to blame everything on a\nsystem whereby the Indians were said to have been caught in a debt trap, made\ncompletely dependent on the company store:\n\nThe root of the whole evil was the so called _patron_ or “peonage” system—a\nvariety of what used to be called in England the “truck system”—by which the\nemployee, forced to buy all his supplies at the employer’s store, is kept\nhopelessly in debt, while by law he is unable to leave his employment until\nhis debt is paid … The _peon_ is thus, as often as not, a _de facto_ slave;\nand since in the remoter regions of the vast continent there is no effective\ngovernment, he is wholly at the mercy of his\nmaster.[94](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts094)\n\nThe “cannibals” who ended up flogged to death, crucified, tied up and used for\ntarget practice, or hacked to pieces with machetes for failure to bring in\nsufficient quantities of rubber, had, the story went, fallen into the ultimate\ndebt trap; seduced by the wares of the company’s agents, they’d ended up\nbartering away their very lives.\n\nA later Parliamentary inquiry discovered that the real story was nothing of\nthe sort. The Huitoto had not been tricked into becoming debt peons at all. It\nwas the agents and overseers sent into the region who were, much like the\nconquistadors, deeply indebted—in their case, to the Peruvian company that had\ncommissioned them, which was ultimately receiving its own credit from London\nfinanciers. These agents had certainly arrived with every intention of\nextending that web of credit to include the Indians, but discovering the\nHuitoto to have no interest in the cloth, machetes, and coins they had brought\nto trade with them, they’d finally given up and just started rounding Indians\nup and forcing them to accept loans at gunpoint, then tabulating the amount of\nrubber they owed.[95](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts095) Many of\nthe Indians massacred, in turn, had simply been trying to run away.\n\nIn reality, then, the Indians had been reduced to slavery; it’s just that, by\n1907, no one could openly admit this. A legitimate enterprise had to have some\nmoral basis, and the only morality the company knew was debt. When it became\nclear that the Huitoto rejected the premise, everything went haywire, and the\ncompany ended up, like Casimir, caught in a spiral of indignant terror that\nultimately threatened to wipe out its very economic basis.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIt is the secret scandal of capitalism that at no point has it been organized\nprimarily around free\nlabor.[96](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts096) The conquest of the\nAmericas began with mass enslavement, then gradually settled into various\nforms of debt peonage, African slavery, and “indentured service”—that is, the\nuse of contract labor, workers who had received cash in advance and were thus\nbound for five-, seven-, or ten-year terms to pay it back. Needless to say,\nindentured servants were recruited largely from among people who were already\ndebtors. In the 1600s there were at times almost as many white debtors as\nAfrican slaves working in southern plantations, and legally they were at first\nin almost the same situation, since in the beginning, plantation societies\nwere working within a European legal tradition that assumed slavery did not\nexist, so even Africans in the Carolinas were classified, as contract\nlaborers.[97](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts097) Of course this\nlater changed when the idea of “race” was introduced. When African slaves were\nfreed, they were replaced, on plantations from Barbados to Mauritius, with\ncontract laborers again: though now ones recruited mainly in India or China.\nChinese contract laborers built the North American railroad system, and Indian\n“coolies” built the South African mines. The peasants of Russia and Poland,\nwho had been free landholders in the Middle Ages, were only made serfs at the\ndawn of capitalism, when their lords began to sell grain on the new world\nmarket to feed the new industrial cities to the\nwest.[98](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts098) Colonial regimes in\nAfrica and Southeast Asia regularly demanded forced labor from their conquered\nsubjects, or, alternately, created tax systems designed to force the\npopulation into the labor market through debt. British overlords in India,\nstarting with the East India Company but continuing under Her Majesty’s\ngovernment, institutionalized debt peonage as their primary means of creating\nproducts for sale abroad.\n\nThis is a scandal not just because the system occasionally goes haywire, as it\ndid in the Putumayo, but because it plays havoc with our most cherished\nassumptions about what capitalism really is—particularly that, in its basic\nnature, capitalism has something to do with freedom. For the capitalists, this\nmeans the freedom of the marketplace. For most workers, it means free labor.\nMarxists have questioned whether wage labor is ultimately free in any sense\n(since someone with nothing to sell but his or her body cannot in any sense be\nconsidered a genuinely free agent), but they still tend to assume that free\nwage labor is the basis of capitalism. And the dominant image in the history\nof capitalism is the English workingman toiling in the factories of the\nindustrial revolution, and this image can be traced forward to Silicon Valley,\nwith a straight line in between. All those millions of slaves and serfs and\ncoolies and debt peons disappear, or if we must speak of them, we write them\noff as temporary bumps along the road. Like sweatshops, this is assumed to be\na stage that industrializing nations had to pass through, just as it is still\nassumed that all those millions of debt peons and contract laborers and\nsweatshop workers who still exist, often in the same places, will surely live\nto see their children become regular wage laborers with health insurance and\npensions, and _their_ children, doctors and lawyers and entrepreneurs.\n\nWhen one looks at the actual history of wage labor, even in countries like\nEngland, that picture begins to melt away. In most of Medieval northern\nEurope, wage labor had been mainly a lifestyle phenomenon. From roughly the\nage of twelve or fourteen to roughly twenty-eight or thirty, everyone was\nexpected to be employed as a servant in someone else’s household—usually on a\nyearly contract basis, for which they received room, board, professional\ntraining, and usually a wage of some sort—until they accumulated enough\nresources to marry and set up a household of their\nown.[99](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts099) The first thing that\n“proletarianization” came to mean was that millions of young men and women\nacross Europe found themselves effectively stuck in a kind of permanent\nadolescence. Apprentices and journeymen could never become “masters,” and\nthus, never actually grow up. Eventually, many began to give up and marry\nearly—to the great scandal of the moralists, who insisted that the new\nproletariat were starting families they could not possibly\nsupport.[100](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts100)\n\nThere is, and has always been, a curious affinity between wage labor and\nslavery. This is not just because it was slaves on Caribbean sugar plantations\nwho supplied the quick-energy products that powered much of early wage\nlaborers’ work; not just because most of the scientific management techniques\napplied in factories in the industrial revolution can be traced back to those\nsugar plantations; but also because both the relation between master and\nslave, and between employer and employee, are in principle impersonal: whether\nyou’ve been sold or you’re simply rented yourself out, the moment money\nchanges hands, _who_ you are is supposed to be unimportant; all that’s\nimportant is that you are capable of understanding orders and doing what\nyou’re told.[101](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts101)\n\nThis is one reason, perhaps, that in principle, there was always a feeling\nthat both the buying of slaves and the hiring of laborers should really not be\non credit, but should employ cash. The problem, as I’ve noted, was that for\nmost of the history of British capitalism, the cash simply didn’t exist. Even\nwhen the Royal Mint began to produce smaller-denomination silver and copper\ncoins, the supply was sporadic and inadequate. This is how the “truck system”\ndeveloped to begin with: during the industrial revolution, factory owners\nwould often pay their workers with tickets or vouchers good only in local\nshops, with whose owners they had some sort of informal arrangement, or, in\nmore isolated parts of the country, which they owned\nthemselves.[102](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts102) Traditional\ncredit relations with one’s local shopkeeper clearly took on an entirely new\ncomplexion once the shopkeeper was effectively an agent of the boss. Another\nexpedient was to pay workers at least partly in kind—and notice the very\nrichness of the vocabulary for the sorts of things one was assumed to be\nallowed to appropriate from one’s workplace, particularly from the waste,\nexcess, and side products: cabbage, chips, thrums, sweepings, buggings,\ngleanings, sweepings, potchings, vails, poake, coltage, knockdowns,\ntinge.[103](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts103) “Cabbage,” for\ninstance, was the cloth left over from tailoring, “chips” the pieces of board\nthat dockworkers had the right to carry from their workplace (any piece of\ntimber less than two feet long), “thrums” were taken from the warping-bars of\nlooms, and so on. And of course we have already heard about payment in the\nform of cod, or nails.\n\nEmployers had a final expedient: wait for the money to show up, and in the\nmeantime, don’t pay anything—leaving their employees to get by with _only_\nwhat they could scrounge from their shop floors, or what their families could\nfinagle in outside employment, receive in charity, preserve in savings pools\nwith friends and families, or, when all else failed, acquire on credit from\nthe loan sharks and pawnbrokers who rapidly came to be seen as the perennial\nscourge of the working poor. The situation became such that, by the nineteenth\ncentury, any time a fire destroyed a London pawnshop, working-class\nneighborhoods would brace for the wave of domestic violence that would\ninevitably ensue when many a wife was forced to confess that she’d long since\nsecretly hocked her husband’s Sunday\nsuit.[104](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts104)\n\nWe are, nowadays, used to associating factories eighteen months in arrears for\nwages with a nation in economic free-fall, such as occurred during the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union; but owing to the hard-money policies of the\nBritish government, who were always concerned above all to ensure that their\npaper money didn’t float away in another speculative bubble, in the early days\nof industrial capitalism, such a situation was in no way unusual. Even the\ngovernment was often unable to find the cash to pay its own employees. In\neighteenth-century London, the Royal Admiralty was regularly over a year\nbehind in paying the wages of those who labored at the Deptford docks—one\nreason that they were willing to tolerate the appropriation of chips, not to\nmention hemp, canvas, steel bolts, and cordage. In fact, as Linebaugh has\nshown, the situation only really began to take recognizable form around 1800,\nwhen the government stabilized its finances, began paying cash wages on\nschedule, and therefore tried to abolish the practice of what was now\nrelabeled “workplace pilfering”—which, meeting outraged resistance on the part\nof the dockworkers, was made punishable by whipping and imprisonment. Samuel\nBentham, the engineer put in charge of reforming the dockyards, had to turn\nthem into a regular police state in order to be able to institute a regime of\npure wage labor—to which purpose he ultimately conceived the notion of\nbuilding a giant tower in the middle to guarantee constant surveillance, an\nidea that was later borrowed by his brother Jeremy for the famous\nPanopticon.[105](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts105)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nMen like Smith and Bentham were idealists; even utopians. To understand the\nhistory of capitalism, however, we have to begin by realizing that the picture\nwe have in our heads, of workers who dutifully punch the clock at 8:00 a.m.\nand receive regular remuneration every Friday, on the basis of a temporary\ncontract that either party is free to break off at any time, began as a\nutopian vision, was only gradually put into effect even in England and North\nAmerica, and has never, at any point, been the main way of organizing\nproduction for the market, ever, anywhere.\n\nThis is actually why Smith’s work is so important. He created the vision of an\nimaginary world almost entirely free of debt and credit, and therefore, free\nof guilt and sin; a world where men and women were free to simply calculate\ntheir interests in full knowledge that everything had been prearranged by God\nto ensure that it will serve the greater good. Such imaginary constructs are\nof course what scientists refer to as “models,” and there’s nothing\nintrinsically wrong with them. Actually I think a fair case can be made that\nwe cannot think without them. The problem with such models—at least, it always\nseems to happen when we model something called “the market”—is that, once\ncreated, we have a tendency to treat them as objective realities, or even fall\ndown before them and start worshipping them as gods. “We must obey the\ndictates of the market!”\n\nKarl Marx, who knew quite a bit about the human tendency to fall down and\nworship our own creations, wrote _Das Capital_ in an attempt to demonstrate\nthat, even if we do start from the economists’ utopian vision, so long as we\nalso allow some people to control productive capital, and, again, leave others\nwith nothing to sell but their brains and bodies, the results will be in many\nways barely distinguishable from slavery, and the whole system will eventually\ndestroy itself. What everyone seems to forget is the “as if” nature of his\nanalysis.[106](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts106) Marx was well\naware that there were far more bootblacks, prostitutes, butlers, soldiers,\npedlars, chimneysweeps, flower girls, street musicians, convicts, nannies, and\ncab drivers in the London of his day than there were factory workers. He was\nnever suggesting that that’s what the world was actually like.\n\nStill, if there is anything that the last several hundred years of world\nhistory have shown, it’s that utopian visions can have a certain appeal. This\nis as true of Adam Smith’s as of those ranged against it. The period from\nroughly 1825 to 1975 is a brief but determined effort on the part of a large\nnumber of very powerful people—with the avid support of many of the least\npowerful—to try to turn that vision into something like reality. Coins and\npaper money were, finally, produced in sufficient quantities that even\nordinary people could conduct their daily lives without appeal to tickets,\ntokens, or credit. Wages started to be paid on time. New sorts of shops,\narcades, and galleries appeared, where everyone paid in cash, or alternately,\nas time went on, by means of impersonal forms of credit like installment\nplans. As a result, the old puritanical notion that debt was sin and\ndegradation began to take a profound hold on many of those who came to\nconsider themselves the “respectable” working classes, who often took freedom\nfrom the clutches of the pawnbroker and loan shark as a point of pride, which\nseparated them from drunkards, hustlers, and ditch-diggers as surely as the\nfact that they weren’t missing teeth.\n\nSpeaking as someone brought up in that sort of working-class family (my\nbrother died at the age of 53, having refused to his dying day to acquire a\ncredit card), I can attest to the degree that, for those who spend most of\ntheir waking hours working at someone else’s orders, the ability to pull out a\nwallet full of banknotes that are unconditionally one’s own can be a\ncompelling form of freedom. It’s not surprising that so many of the\neconomists’ assumptions—most of those for which I have been taking them to\ntask over the course of this book—have been embraced by the leaders of the\nhistoric workers’ movements, so much so that they have come to shape our\nvisions of what alternatives to capitalism might be like. The problem is not\njust—as I demonstrated in [chapter 7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c01_r1.htm)—that\nit is rooted in a deeply flawed, even perverse, conception of human freedom.\nThe real problem is that, like all utopian dreams, it is impossible. We could\nno more have a universal world market than we could have a system in which\neveryone who wasn’t a capitalist was somehow able to become a respectable,\nregularly paid wage laborer with access to adequate dental care. A world like\nthat has never existed and never could exist. What’s more, the moment that\neven the prospect that this might happen begins to materialize, the whole\nsystem starts to come apart.\n\n## Part IV:\n\n### Apocalypse\n\nLet us return, finally, to where we began: with Cortés and the Aztec treasure.\nThe reader might have asked herself, What did happen to it? Did Cortés really\nsteal it from his own men?\n\nThe answer seems to be that by the time the siege was over, there was very\nlittle of it left. Cortés seems to have gotten his hands on much of it long\nbefore the siege even began. A certain portion he had won by gambling.\n\nThis story, too, is in Bernal Díaz, and it is strange and puzzling, but also,\nI suspect, profound. Let me fill in some of the gaps in our story. After\nburning his boats, Cortés began to assemble an army of local allies, which was\neasy to do because the Aztecs were widely hated, and then he began to march on\nthe Aztec capital. Moctezuma, the Aztec emperor, who had been monitoring the\nsituation closely, concluded that he needed to at least figure out what sort\nof people he was dealing with, so he invited the entire Spanish force (only a\nfew hundred men) to be his official guests in Tenochtitlán. This eventually\nled to a series of palace intrigues during which Cortés’s men briefly held the\nemperor hostage before being forcibly expelled.\n\nDuring the time when Moctezuma was being held captive in his own palace, he\nand Cortés passed a good deal of their time playing an Aztec game called\n_totoloque_. They played for gold, and Cortés, of course, cheated. At one\npoint, Moctezuma’s men brought the matter to the king’s attention, but the\nking just laughed and made a joke of it—neither was he concerned later when\nPedro de Alvarado, Cortés’s chief lieutenant, began cheating even more\nflagrantly, demanding gold for each point lost and when he lost, paying only\nin worthless pebbles. Why Moctezuma behaved so has remained something of an\nhistorical mystery. Díaz took it as a gesture of lordly magnanimity, perhaps\neven a way of putting the petty-minded Spaniards in their\nplace.[107](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts107)\n\nOne historian, Inga Clenninden, suggests an alternate interpretation. Aztec\ngames, she notes, tended to have a peculiar feature: there was always a way\nthat, by a freak stroke of luck, one could achieve total victory. This seems\nto have been true, for instance, of their famous ball games. Observers always\nwonder, viewing the tiny stone hoops set high above the court, how anyone\ncould ever possibly have managed to score. The answer seems to be: they\ndidn’t, at least not that way. Normally the game had nothing to do with the\nhoop. The game was played between two opposing squads, attired as for battle,\nknocking the ball back and forth:\n\nThe normal method of scoring was through the slow accumulation of points. But\nthat process could be dramatically preempted. To send the ball through one of\nthe rings—a feat, given the size of the ball and the ring, presumably rarer\nthan a hole in one in golf—gave instant victory, ownership of all the goods\nwagered, and the right to pillage the cloaks of the\nonlookers.[108](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts108)\n\nWhoever scored the point won everything, down to the audience’s clothing.\n\nThere were similar rules in board games, such as Cortés and Moctezuma were\nplaying: if, by some freak stroke of luck, one of the dice landed on its edge,\nthe game was over, and the winner took everything. This, Clenninden suggests,\nmust have been what Moctezuma was really waiting for. After all, he was\nclearly in the middle of extraordinary events. Strange creatures had appeared,\napparently from nowhere, with unheard-of powers. Rumors of epidemics, of the\ndestruction of nearby nations, had presumably already reached him. If ever\nthere was a time that some grandiose revelation was due from the gods, then\nsurely this was it.\n\nSuch an attitude does seem to fit perfectly with the spirit of Aztec culture\ngleaned from its literature, which exuded a sense of impending catastrophe,\nperhaps astrologically determined, just possibly avoidable—but probably not.\nSome have suggested that Aztecs must have somehow been aware that they were a\ncivilization skating on the brink of ecological catastrophe; others, that the\napocalyptic tone is retrospective—since, after all, what we know of Aztec\nliterature is almost entirely gleaned from men and women who actually did\nexperience its complete destruction. Still, there does seem to be a certain\nfrantic quality in certain Aztec practices—the sacrifice of as many as tens of\nthousands of war prisoners, most notably in the apparent belief that, were the\nSun not continually fed with human hearts, it would die and world with it—that\nit’s hard to explain in any other way.\n\nIf Clenninden is right, for Moctezuma, he and Cortés were not simply gambling\nfor gold. Gold was trivial. The stakes were the entire universe.\n\nMoctezuma was above all a warrior, and all warriors are gamblers; but unlike\nCortés, he was clearly in every way a man of honor. As we’ve also seen, the\nquintessence of a warrior’s honor, which is a greatness that can only come\nfrom the destruction and degradation of others, is his willingness to throw\nhimself into a game where he risks that same destruction and degradation\nhimself—and, unlike Cortés, to play graciously, and by the\nrules.[109](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts109) When the time\ncame, it meant being willing to stake everything.\n\nHe did. And as it turns out, nothing happened. No die landed on its edge.\nCortés continued to cheat, the gods sent no revelation, and the universe was\neventually destroyed.\n\nIf there’s something to be learned here—and as I say, I think there is—it is\nthat there may be a deeper, more profound relation between gambling and\napocalypse. Capitalism is a system that enshrines the gambler as an essential\npart of its operation, in a way that no other ever has; yet at the same time,\ncapitalism seems to be uniquely incapable of conceiving of its own eternity.\nCould these two facts be linked?\n\nI should be more precise here. It’s not entirely true that capitalism is\nincapable of conceiving of its own eternity. On the one hand, its exponents do\noften feel obliged to present it as eternal, because they insist that is it is\nthe only possible viable economic system: one that, as they still sometimes\nlike to say, “has existed for five thousand years and will exist for five\nthousand more.” On the other hand, it does seem that the moment a significant\nportion of the population begins to actually believe this, and particularly,\nstarts treating credit institutions as if they really will be around forever,\neverything goes haywire. Note here how it was the most sober, cautious,\nresponsible capitalist regimes—the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic, the\neighteenth-century British Commonwealth—the ones most careful about managing\ntheir public debt—that saw the most bizarre explosions of speculative frenzy,\nthe tulip manias and South Sea bubbles.\n\nMuch of this seems to turn on the nature of national deficits and credit\nmoney. The national debt is, as politicians have complained practically since\nthese things first appeared, money borrowed from future generations. Still,\nthe effects have always been strangely double-edged. On the one hand, deficit\nfinancing is a way of putting even more military power in the hands of\nprinces, generals, and politicians; on the other, it suggests that government\nowes something to those it governs. Insofar as our money is ultimately an\nextension of the public debt, then whenever we buy a newspaper or a cup of\ncoffee, or even place a bet on a horse, we are trading in promises,\nrepresentations of something that the government will give us at some time in\nthe future, even if we don’t know exactly what it\nis.[110](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts110)\n\nImmanuel Wallerstein likes to point out that the French Revolution introduced\nseveral profoundly new ideas in politics—ideas which, fifty years before the\nrevolution, the vast majority of educated Europeans would have written off as\ncrazy, but which, fifty years afterward, just about anyone felt they had to at\nleast pretend they thought were true. The first is that social change is\ninevitable and desirable: that the natural direction of history is for\ncivilization to gradually improve. The second is that the appropriate agent to\nmanage such change is the government. The third is that the government gains\nits legitimacy from an entity called “the\npeople.”[111](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts111) It’s easy to see\nhow the very idea of a national debt—a promise of continual future improvement\n(at the very least, five percent annual improvement) made by government to\npeople—might itself have played a role in inspiring such a revolutionary new\nperspective. Yet at the same time, when one looks at what men like Mirabeau,\nVoltaire, Diderot, Siéyes—the _philosophes_ who first proposed that notion of\nwhat we now call “civilization”—were actually arguing about in the years\nimmediately leading up to the revolution, it was even more about the danger of\napocalyptic catastrophe, of the prospect of civilization as they knew it being\ndestroyed by default and economic collapse.\n\nPart of the problem was the obvious one: the national debt is, first, born of\nwar; second, it is not owed to all the people equally, but above all to\ncapitalists—and in France at that time, “capitalist” meant, specifically,\n“those who held pieces of the national debt.” The more democratically inclined\nfelt that the entire situation was opprobrious. “The modern theory of the\nperpetuation of debt,” Thomas Jefferson wrote, around this same time, “has\ndrenched the earth with blood, and crushed its inhabitants under burdens ever\naccumulating.”[112](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts112) Most\nEnlightenment thinkers feared that it promised even worse. Intrinsic to the\nnew, “modern” notion of impersonal debt, after all, was the possibility of\nbankruptcy.[113](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts113) Bankruptcy,\nat that time, was indeed something of a personal apocalypse: it meant prison,\nthe dissolution of one’s estate; for the least fortunate, it meant torture,\nstarvation, and death. What national bankruptcy would mean, at that point in\nhistory, nobody knew. There were simply no precedents. Yet as nations fought\ngreater and bloodier wars, and their debts escalated geometrically, default\nbegan to appear\nunavoidable.[114](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts114) Abbe Sieyés\nfirst put forward his great scheme for representative government, for\ninstance, primarily as a way of reforming the national finances, to fend off\nthe inevitable catastrophe. And when it happened, what would it look like?\nWould the money become worthless? Would military regimes seize power, regimes\nacross Europe be likewise forced to default and fall like dominos, plunging\nthe continent into endless barbarism, darkness, and war? Many were already\nanticipating the prospect of the Terror long before the revolution\nitself.[115](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts115)\n\nIt’s a strange story because we are used to thinking of the Enlightenment as\nthe dawn of a unique phase of human optimism, borne on assumptions that the\nadvance of science and human knowledge would inevitably make life wiser,\nsafer, and better for everyone—a naïve faith said to have peaked in the Fabian\nsocialism of the 1890s, only to be annihilated in the trenches of World War I.\nIn fact, even the Victorians were haunted by the dangers of degeneration and\ndecline. Most of all, Victorians shared the near-universal assumption that\ncapitalism itself would not be around forever. Insurrection seemed imminent.\nMany Victorian capitalists operated under the sincere belief that they might,\nat any moment, find themselves hanging from trees. In Chicago, for instance, a\nfriend once took me on a drive down a beautiful old street, full of mansions\nfrom the 1870s: the reason, he explained, that it looked like that, was that\nmost of Chicago’s rich industrialists of the time were so convinced that the\nrevolution was immanent that they collectively relocated along the road that\nled to the nearest military base. Almost none of the great theorists of\ncapitalism, from anywhere on the political spectrum, from Marx to Weber, to\nSchumpeter, to von Mises, felt that capitalism was likely to be around for\nmore than another generation or two at the most.\n\nOne could go further: the moment that the fear of imminent social revolution\nno longer seemed plausible, by the end of World War II, we were immediately\npresented with the specter of nuclear\nholocaust.[116](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c11-nts116) Then, when\nthat no longer seemed plausible, we discovered global warming. This is not to\nsay that these threats were not, and are not, real. Yet it does seem strange\nthat capitalism feels the constant need to imagine, or to actually\nmanufacture, the means of its own imminent extinction. It’s in dramatic\ncontrast to the behavior of the leaders of socialist regimes, from Cuba to\nAlbania, who, when they came to power, immediately began acting as if their\nsystem would be around forever—ironically enough, considering they in fact\nturned out to be something of an historical blip.\n\nPerhaps the reason is because what was true in 1710 is still true. Presented\nwith the prospect of its own eternity, capitalism—or anyway, financial\ncapitalism—simply explodes. Because if there’s no end to it, there’s\nabsolutely no reason not to generate credit—that is, future money—infinitely.\nRecent events would certainly seem to confirm this. The period leading up to\n2009 was one in which many began to believe that capitalism really was going\nto be around forever; at the very least, no one seemed any longer to be able\nto imagine an alternative. The immediate effect was a series of increasingly\nreckless bubbles that brought the whole apparatus crashing down.\n\n\n# Chapter Twelve  \n  \n(1971–The Beginning of Something Yet to Be Determined)\n\n_Look at all these bums: If only there were a way of finding out how much they\nowe_.\n\n_—Repo Man_ (1984)  \n  \n\n_Free your mind of the idea of deserving, of the idea of earning, and you will\nbegin to be able to think_.\n\n—Ursula K. Le Guin, _The Dispossessed_\n\nON AUGUST 15, 1971, United States President Richard Nixon announced that\nforeign-held U.S. dollars would no longer be convertible into gold—thus\nstripping away the last vestige of the international gold\nstandard.[1](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts001) This was the end\nof a policy that had been effective since 1931, and confirmed by the Bretton\nWoods accords at the end of World War II: that while United States citizens\nmight no longer be allowed to cash in their dollars for gold, all U.S.\ncurrency held outside the country was to be redeemable at the rate of $35 an\nounce. By doing so, Nixon initiated the regime of free-floating currencies\nthat continues to this day.\n\nThe consensus among historians is that Nixon had little choice. His hand was\nforced by the rising costs of the Vietnam War—one that, like all capitalist\nwars, had been financed by deficit spending. The United States was in\npossession of a large proportion of the world’s gold reserves in its vaults in\nFort Knox (though increasingly less in the late 1960s, as other governments,\nmost famously Charles de Gaulle’s France, began demanding gold for their\ndollars); most poorer countries, in contrast, kept their reserves in dollars.\nThe immediate effect of Nixon’s unpegging the dollar was to cause the price of\ngold to skyrocket; it hit a peak of $600 an ounce in 1980. This of course had\nthe effect of causing U.S. gold reserves to increase dramatically in value.\nThe value of the dollar, as denominated in gold, plummeted. The result was a\nmassive net transfer of wealth from poor countries, which lacked gold\nreserves, to rich ones, like the United States and Great Britain, that\nmaintained them. In the United States, it also set off persistent inflation.\n\nWhatever Nixon’s reasons, though, once the global system of credit money was\nentirely unpegged from gold, the world entered a new phase of financial\nhistory—one that nobody completely understands. While I was growing up in New\nYork, I would hear occasional rumors of secret gold vaults underneath the Twin\nTowers in Manhattan. Supposedly, these vaults contained not just the U.S. gold\nreserves, but those of all the major economic powers. The gold was said to be\nkept in the form of bars, piled up in separate vaults, one for each country,\nand every year, when the balance of accounts was calculated, workmen with\ndollies would adjust the stocks accordingly, carting, say, a few million in\ngold out of the vault marked “Brazil” and transfering them to the one marked\n“Germany,” and so on.\n\nApparently a lot of people had heard these stories. At least, right after the\nTowers were destroyed on September 11, 2001, one of the first questions many\nNew Yorkers asked was: What happened to the money? Was it safe? Were the\nvaults destroyed? Presumably, the gold had melted. Was this the real aim of\nthe attackers? Conspiracy theories abounded. Some spoke of legions of\nemergency workers secretly summoned to make their way through miles of\noverheated tunnels, desperately carting off tons of bullion even as rescue\nworkers labored overhead. One particularly colorful conspiracy theory\nsuggested that the entire attack was really staged by speculators who, like\nNixon, expected to see the value of the dollar crash and that of gold to\nskyrocket—either because the reserves had been destroyed, or because they\nthemselves had laid prior plans to steal\nthem.[2](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts002)\n\nThe truly remarkable thing about this story is that, after having believed it\nfor years, and then, in the wake of 9/11, having been convinced by some more\nknowing friends that it was all a great myth (“No,” one of them said\nresignedly, as if to a child, “the United States keeps its gold reserves in\nFort Knox”), I did a little research and discovered that, no, actually, it’s\ntrue. The United States treasury’s gold reserves are indeed kept at Fort Knox,\nbut the Federal Reserve’s gold reserves, and those of more than one hundred\nother central banks, governments, and organizations, are stored in vaults\nunder the Federal Reserve building at 33 Liberty Street in Manhattan, two\nblocks away from the Towers. At roughly five thousand metric tons (266 million\ntroy ounces), these combined reserves represent, according to the Fed’s own\nwebsite, somewhere between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the gold that has\never been taken from the earth.\n\nThe gold stored at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is secured in a most\nunusual vault. It rests on the bedrock of Manhattan Island—one of the few\nfoundations considered adequate to support the weight of the vault, its door,\nand the gold inside—eighty feet below street level and fifty feet below sea\nlevel … To reach the vault, bullionladen pallets must be loaded into one of\nthe Bank’s elevators and sent down five floors below street level to the vault\nfloor … If everything is in order, the gold is either moved to one or more of\nthe vault’s 122 compartments assigned to depositing countries and official\ninternational organizations or placed on shelves. “Gold stackers,” using\nhydraulic lifts, do indeed shift them back and forth between compartments to\nbalance credits and debts, though the vaults have only numbers, so even the\nworkers don’t know who is paying\nwhom.[3](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts003)\n\nThere is no reason to believe, however, that these vaults were in any way\naffected by the events of September 11, 2001.\n\nReality, then, has become so odd that it’s hard to guess which elements of\ngrand mythic fantasies are really fantasy, and which are true. The image of\ncollapsed vaults, the melted bullion, of secret workers scurrying deep below\nManhattan with underground forklifts evacuating the world economy—all this\nturns out not to be. But is it entirely surprising that people were willing to\nconsider it?[4](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts004)\n\nIn America, the banking system since the days of Thomas Jefferson has shown a\nremarkable capacity to inspire paranoid fantasies: whether centering on\nFreemasons, or Elders of Zion, or the Secret Order of the Illuminati, or the\nQueen of England’s drug-money-laundering operations, or any of a thousand\nother secret conspiracies and cabals. It’s the main reason why it took so long\nfor an American central bank to be established to begin with. In a way there’s\nnothing surprising here. The United States has always been dominated by a\ncertain market populism, and the ability of banks to “create money out of\nnothing”—and even more, to prevent anyone else from doing so—has always been\nthe bugaboo of market populists, since it directly contradicts the idea that\nmarkets are a simple expression of democratic equality. Still, since Nixon’s\nfloating of the dollar, it has become evident that it’s _only_ the wizard\nbehind the screen who seems to be maintaining the viability of the whole\narrangement. Under the free-market orthodoxy that followed, we have all being\nasked, effectively, to accept that “the market” is a self-regulating system,\nwith the rising and falling of prices akin to a force of nature, and\nsimultaneously to ignore the fact that, in the business pages, it is simply\nassumed that markets rise and fall mainly in anticipation of, or reaction to,\ndecisions regarding interest rates by Alan Greenspan, or Ben Bernanke, or\nwhoever is currently the chairman of the Federal\nReserve.[5](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts005)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nOne element, however, tends to go flagrantly missing in even the most vivid\nconspiracy theories about the banking system, let alone in official accounts:\nthat is, the role of war and military power. There’s a reason why the wizard\nhas such a strange capacity to create money out of nothing. Behind him,\nthere’s a man with a gun.\n\nTrue, in one sense, he’s been there from the start. I have already pointed out\nthat modern money is based on government debt, and that governments borrow\nmoney in order to finance wars. This is just as true today as it was in the\nage of King Phillip II. The creation of central banks represented a permanent\ninstitutionalization of that marriage between the interests of warriors and\nfinanciers that had already begun to emerge in Renaissance Italy, and that\neventually became the foundation of financial\ncapitalism.[6](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts006)\n\nNixon floated the dollar in order to pay for the cost of a war in which,\nduring the period of 1970–1972 alone, he ordered more than four million tons\nof explosives and incendiaries dropped on cities and villages across\nIndochina—causing one senator to dub him “the greatest bomber of all\ntime.”[7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts007) The debt crisis was\na direct result of the need to pay for the bombs, or to be more precise, the\nvast military infrastructure required to deliver them. This was what was\ncausing such an enormous strain on the U.S. gold reserves. Many hold that by\nfloating the dollar, Nixon converted the U.S. currency into pure “fiat\nmoney”—mere pieces of paper, intrinsically worthless, that were treated as\nmoney only because the United States government insisted that it should be. In\nthat case, one could well argue that U.S. military power was now the only\nthing backing up the currency. In a certain sense this is true, but the notion\nof “fiat money” assumes that money really “was” gold in the first place.\nReally we are dealing with another variation of credit money.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the U.S. government can’t “just print money,”\nbecause American money is not issued by the government at all, but by private\nbanks, under the aegis of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal\nReserve—despite the name—is technically not part of the government at all, but\na peculiar sort of public-private hybrid, a consortium of privately owned\nbanks whose chairman is appointed by the United States president, with\nCongressional approval, but which otherwise operates without public oversight.\nAll dollar bills in circulation in America are “Federal Reserve Notes”—the Fed\nissues them as promissory notes, and commissions the U.S. mint to do the\nactual printing, paying it four cents for each\nbill.[8](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts008) The arrangement is\njust a variation of the scheme originally pioneered by the Bank of England,\nwhereby the Fed “loans” money to the United States government by purchasing\ntreasury bonds, and then monetizes the U.S. debt by lending the money thus\nowed by the government to other\nbanks.[9](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts009) The difference is\nthat while the Bank of England originally loaned the king gold, the Fed simply\nwhisks the money into existence by saying that it’s there. Thus, it’s the Fed\nthat has the power to print\nmoney.[10](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts010) The banks that\nreceive loans from the Fed are no longer permitted to print money themselves,\nbut they are allowed to create virtual money by making loans at a fractional\nreserve rate established by the Fed—though in the wake of the current credit\ncrisis, at time of this writing, there has been a move to remove even these\nrestrictions.\n\nAll this is a bit of a simplification: monetary policy is endlessly arcane,\nand it does sometimes seem, intentionally so. (Henry Ford once remarked that\nif ordinary Americans ever found out how the banking system really worked,\nthere would be a revolution tomorrow.) What is remarkable for present purposes\nis not so much that American dollars are created by banks, but that one\napparently paradoxical result of Nixon’s floating the currency was that these\nbank-created dollars themselves replaced gold as the world’s reserve currency:\nthat is, as the ultimate store of value in the world, yielding the United\nStates enormous economic advantages.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. debt remains, as it has been since 1790, a war debt: the\nUnited States continues to spend more on its military than do all other\nnations on earth put together, and military expenditures are not only the\nbasis of the government’s industrial policy; they also take up such a huge\nproportion of the budget that by many estimations, were it not for them, the\nUnited States would not run a deficit at all.\n\nThe U.S. military, unlike any other, maintains a doctrine of global power\nprojection: that it should have the ability, through roughly 800 overseas\nmilitary bases, to intervene with deadly force absolutely anywhere on the\nplanet. In a way, though, land forces are secondary; at least since World War\nII, the key to U.S. military doctrine has always been a reliance on air power.\nThe United States has fought no war in which it did not control the skies, and\nit has relied on aerial bombardment far more systematically than any other\nmilitary—in its recent occupation of Iraq, for instance, even going so far as\nto bomb residential neighborhoods of cities ostensibly under its own control.\nThe essence of U.S. military predominance in the world is, ultimately, the\nfact that it can, at will, drop bombs, with only a few hours’ notice, at\nabsolutely any point on the surface of the\nplanet.[11](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts011) No other\ngovernment has ever had anything remotely like this sort of capability. In\nfact, a case could well be made that it is this very power that holds the\nentire world monetary system, organized around the dollar, together.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_006_r1.jpg)\n\nBecause of United States trade deficits, huge numbers of dollars circulate\noutside the country; and one effect of Nixon’s floating of the dollar was that\nforeign central banks have little they can do with these dollars except to use\nthem to buy U.S. treasury\nbonds.[12](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts012) This is what is\nmeant by the dollar becoming the world’s “reserve currency.” These bonds are,\nlike all bonds, supposed to be loans that will eventually mature and be\nrepaid, but as economist Michael Hudson, who first began observing the\nphenomenon in the early ’70s, noted, they never really do:\n\nTo the extent that these Treasury IOUs are being built into the world’s\nmonetary base they will not have to be repaid, but are to be rolled over\nindefinitely. This feature is the essence of America’s free financial ride, a\ntax imposed at the entire globe’s\nexpense.[13](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts013)\n\nWhat’s more, over time, the combined effect of low interest payments and the\ninflation is that these bonds actually depreciate in value—adding to the tax\neffect, or as I preferred to put it in the first chapter, “tribute.”\nEconomists prefer to call it “seigniorage.” The effect, though, is that\nAmerican imperial power is based on a debt that will never—can never—be\nrepaid. Its national debt has become a promise, not just to its own people,\nbut to the nations of the entire world, that everyone knows will not be kept.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. policy was to insist that those countries relying on\nU.S. treasury bonds as their reserve currency behaved in exactly the opposite\nway as they did: observing tight money policies and scrupulously repaying\ntheir debts.\n\nAs I’ve already observed, since Nixon’s time, the most significant overseas\nbuyers of U.S. treasury bonds have tended to be banks in countries that were\neffectively under U.S. military occupation. In Europe, Nixon’s most\nenthusiastic ally in this respect was West Germany, which then hosted more\nthan three hundred thousand U.S. troops. In more recent decades the focus has\nshifted to Asia, particularly the central banks of countries like Japan,\nTaiwan, and South Korea—again, all U.S. military protectorates. What’s more,\nthe global status of the dollar is maintained in large part by the fact that\nit is, again since 1971, the only currency used to buy and sell petroleum,\nwith any attempt by OPEC countries to begin trading in any currency stubbornly\nresisted by OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Kuwait—also U.S. military\nprotectorates. When Saddam Hussein made the bold move of singlehandedly\nswitching from the dollar to the euro in 2000, followed by Iran in 2001, this\nwas quickly followed by American bombing and military\noccupation.[14](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts014) How much\nHussein’s decision to buck the dollar really weighed into the U.S. decision to\ndepose him is impossible to know, but no country in a position to make a\nsimilar switch can ignore the possibility. The result, among policymakers\nparticularly in the global South, is widespread\nterror.[15](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts015)\n\nIn all this, the advent of the free-floating dollar marks not a break with the\nalliance of warriors and financiers on which capitalism itself was originally\nfounded, but its ultimate apotheosis. Neither has the return to virtual money\nled to a great return to relations of honor and trust: quite the contrary. By\n1971, the change had only just begun. The American Express card, the first\ngeneral-purpose credit card, had been invented a mere thirteen years before,\nand the modern national credit-card system had only really come into being\nwith the advent of Visa and MasterCard in 1968. Debit cards were later,\ncreatures of the 1970s, and the current, largely cashless economy only came\ninto being in the 1990s. All of these new credit arrangements were mediated\nnot by interpersonal relations of trust but by profit-seeking corporations,\nand one of the earliest and greatest political victories of the U.S. credit-\ncard industry was the elimination of all legal restrictions on what they could\ncharge as interest.\n\nIf history holds true, an age of virtual money should mean a movement away\nfrom war, empire-building, slavery, and debt peonage (waged or otherwise), and\ntoward the creation of some sort of overarching institutions, global in scale,\nto protect debtors. What we have seen so far is the opposite. The new global\ncurrency is rooted in military power even more firmly than the old was. Debt\npeonage continues to be the main principle of recruiting labor globally:\neither in the literal sense, in much of East Asia or Latin America, or in the\nsubjective sense, whereby most of those working for wages or even salaries\nfeel that they are doing so primarily to pay off interest-bearing loans. The\nnew transportation and communications technologies have just made it easier,\nmaking it possible to charge domestics or factory workers thousands of dollars\nin transportation fees, and then have them work off the debt in distant\ncountries where they lack legal\nprotections.[16](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts016) Insofar as\noverarching grand cosmic institutions have been created that might be\nconsidered in any way parallel to the divine kings of the ancient Middle East\nor the religious authorities of the Middle Ages, they have not been created to\nprotect debtors, but to enforce the rights of creditors. The International\nMonetary Fund is only the most dramatic case in point here. It stands at the\npinnacle of a great, emerging global bureaucracy—the first genuinely global\nadministrative system in human history, enshrined not only in the United\nNations, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, but also the\nendless host of economic unions and trade organizations and non-governmental\norganizations that work in tandem with them—created largely under U.S.\npatronage. All of them operate on the principle that (unless one is the United\nStates Treasury), “one has to pay one’s debts”—since the specter of default by\nany country is assumed to imperil the entire world monetary system,\nthreatening, in Addison’s colorful image, to turn all the world’s sacks of\n(virtual) gold into worthless sticks and paper.\n\nAll true. Still, we are speaking of a mere forty years here. But Nixon’s\ngambit, what Hudson calls “debt imperialism,” has already come under\nconsiderable strain. The first casualty was precisely the imperial bureaucracy\ndedicated to the protection of creditors (other than those that were owed\nmoney by the United States). IMF policies of insisting that debts be repaid\nalmost exclusively from the pockets of the poor were met by an equally global\nmovement of social rebellion (the so-called “anti-globalization\nmovement”—though the name is profoundly deceptive), followed by outright\nfiscal rebellion in both East Asia and Latin America. By 2000, East Asian\ncountries had begun a systematic boycott of the IMF. In 2002, Argentina\ncommitted the ultimate sin: they defaulted—and got away with it. Subsequent\nU.S. military adventures were clearly meant to terrify and overawe, but they\ndo not appear to have been very successful: partly because, to finance them,\nthe United States had to turn not just to its military clients, but\nincreasingly, to China, its chief remaining military rival. After the near-\ntotal collapse of the U.S. financial industry, which despite having been very\nnearly granted rights to make up money at will, _still_ managed to end up with\ntrillions in liabilities it could not pay, bringing the world economy to a\nstandstill, eliminating even the pretense that debt imperialism guaranteed\nstability.\n\nJust to give a sense of how extreme a financial crisis we are talking about,\nhere are some statistical charts culled from the pages of the St. Louis\nFederal Reserve web page.[17](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts017)\n\nHere is the amount of U.S. debt held overseas:\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_007_r1.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile, private U.S. banks reacted to the crash by abandoning any pretense\nthat we are dealing with a market economy, shifting all available assets into\nthe coffers of the Federal Reserve itself, which purchased U.S. Treasuries:\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_008_r1.jpg)\n\nAllowing them, through yet another piece of arcane magic that none of us could\npossibly understand, to end up, after an initial near-$400-billion dip, with\nfar larger reserves than they had ever had before.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_009_r1.jpg)\n\nAt this point, some U.S. creditors clearly feel they are finally in a position\nto demand that their own political agendas be taken into account.\n\nCHINA WARNS U.S. ABOUT DEBT MONETIZATION\n\nSeemingly everywhere he went on a recent tour of China, Dallas Fed President\nRichard Fisher was asked to deliver a message to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben\nBernanke: “stop creating credit out of thin air to purchase U.S.\nTreasuries.”[18](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts018)\n\nAgain, it’s never clear whether the money siphoned from Asia to support the\nU.S. war machine is better seen as “loans” or as “tribute.” Still, the sudden\nadvent of China as a major holder of U.S. treasury bonds has clearly altered\nthe dynamic. Some might question why, if these really are tribute payments,\nthe United States’ major rival would be buying treasury bonds to begin\nwith—let alone agreeing to various tacit monetary arrangements to maintain the\nvalue of the dollar, and hence, the buying power of American\nconsumers.[19](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts019) But I think\nthis is a perfect case in point of why taking a very long-term historical\nperspective can be so helpful.\n\nFrom a longer-term perspective, China’s behavior isn’t puzzling at all. In\nfact it’s quite true to form. The unique thing about the Chinese empire is\nthat it has, since the Han dynasty at least, adopted a peculiar sort of\ntribute system whereby, in exchange for recognition of the Chinese emperor as\nworld-sovereign, they have been willing to shower their client states with\ngifts far greater than they receive in return. The technique seems to have\nbeen developed almost as a kind of trick when dealing with the “northern\nbarbarians” of the steppes, who always threatened Chinese frontiers: a way to\noverwhelm them with such luxuries that they would become complacent,\neffeminate, and unwarlike. It was systematized in the “tribute trade”\npracticed with client states like Japan, Taiwan, Korea, and various states of\nSoutheast Asia, and for a brief period from 1405 to 1433, it even extended to\na world scale, under the famous eunuch admiral Zheng He. He led a series of\nseven expeditions across the Indian Ocean, his great “treasure fleet”—in\ndramatic contrast to the Spanish treasure fleets of a century later—carrying\nnot only thousands of armed marines, but endless quantities of silks,\nporcelain, and other Chinese luxuries to present to those local rulers willing\nto recognize the authority of the\nemperor.[20](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts020) All this was\nostensibly rooted in an ideology of extraordinary chauvinism (“What could\nthese barbarians possibly have that we really need, anyway?”), but, applied to\nChina’s neighbors, it proved extremely wise policy for a wealthy empire\nsurrounded by much smaller but potentially troublesome kingdoms. In fact, it\nwas such wise policy that the U.S. government, during the Cold War, more or\nless had to adopt it, creating remarkably favorable terms of trade for those\nvery states—Korea, Japan, Taiwan, certain favored allies in Southeast\nAsia—that had been the traditional Chinese tributaries; in this case, in order\nto contain China.[21](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts021)\n\nBearing all this in mind, the current picture begins to fall easily back into\nplace. When the United States was far and away the predominant world economic\npower, it could afford to maintain Chinese-style tributaries. Thus these very\nstates, alone amongst U.S. military protectorates, were allowed to catapult\nthemselves out of poverty and into first-world\nstatus.[22](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts022) After 1971, as\nU.S. economic strength relative to the rest of the world began to decline,\nthey were gradually transformed back into a more old-fashioned sort of\ntributary. Yet China’s getting in on the game introduced an entirely new\nelement. There is every reason to believe that, from China’s point of view,\nthis is the first stage of a very long process of reducing the United States\nto something like a traditional Chinese client state. And of course, Chinese\nrulers are not, any more than the rulers of any other empire, motivated\nprimarily by benevolence. There is always a political cost, and what that\nheadline marked was the first glimmerings of what that cost might ultimately\nbe.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nAll that I have said so far merely serves to underline a reality that has come\nup constantly over the course of this book: that money has no essence. It’s\nnot “really” anything; therefore, its nature has always been and presumably\nalways will be a matter of political contention. This was certainly true\nthroughout earlier stages of U.S. history, incidentally—as the endless\nnineteenth-century battles between goldbugs, greenbackers, free bankers, bi-\nmetallists and silverites so vividly attest—or, for that matter, the fact that\nAmerican voters were so suspicious of the very idea of central banks that the\nFederal Reserve system was only created on the eve of World War I, three\ncenturies after the Bank of England. Even the monetization of the national\ndebt is, as I’ve already noted, double-edged. It can be seen—as Jefferson saw\nit—as the ultimate pernicious alliance of warriors and financiers; but it also\nopened the way to seeing government itself as a moral debtor, of freedom as\nsomething literally owed to the nation. Perhaps no one put it so eloquently as\nMartin Luther King Jr., in his “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered on the steps\nof the Lincoln Memorial in 1963:\n\nIn a sense we’ve come to our nation’s capital to cash a check. When the\narchitects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and\nthe Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which\nevery American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes,\nblack men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the “unalienable Rights”\nof “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It is obvious today that\nAmerica has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of\ncolor are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has\ngiven the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked\n“insufficient funds.”\n\nOne can see the great crash of 2008 in the same light—as the outcome of years\nof political tussles between creditors and debtors, rich and poor. True, on a\ncertain level, it was exactly what it seemed to be: a scam, an incredibly\nsophisticated Ponzi scheme designed to collapse in the full knowledge that the\nperpetrators would be able to force the victims to bail them out. On another\nlevel it could be seen as the culmination of a battle over the very definition\nof money and credit.\n\nBy the end of World War II, the specter of an imminent working-class uprising\nthat had so haunted the ruling classes of Europe and North America for the\nprevious century had largely disappeared. This was because class war was\nsuspended by a tacit settlement. To put it crudely: the white working class of\nthe North Atlantic countries, from the United States to West Germany, were\noffered a deal. If they agreed to set aside any fantasies of fundamentally\nchanging the nature of the system, then they would be allowed to keep their\nunions, enjoy a wide variety a social benefits (pensions, vacations, health\ncare …), and, perhaps most important, through generously funded and ever-\nexpanding public educational institutions, know that their children had a\nreasonable chance of leaving the working class entirely. One key element in\nall this was a tacit guarantee that increases in workers’ productivity would\nbe met by increases in wages: a guarantee that held good until the late 1970s.\nLargely as a result, the period saw both rapidly rising productivity and\nrapidly rising incomes, laying the basis for the consumer economy of today.\n\nEconomists call this the “Keynesian era” since it was a time in which John\nMaynard Keynes’ economic theories, which already formed the basis of\nRoosevelt’s New Deal in the United States, were adopted by industrial\ndemocracies pretty much everywhere. With them came Keynes’ rather casual\nattitude toward money. The reader will recall that Keynes fully accepted that\nbanks do, indeed, create money “out of thin air,” and that for this reason,\nthere was no intrinsic reason that government policy should not encourage this\nduring economic downturns as a way of stimulating demand—a position that had\nlong been dear to the heart of debtors and anathema to creditors.\n\nKeynes himself had in his day been known to make some fairly radical noises,\nfor instance calling for the complete elimination of that class of people who\nlived off other people’s debts—the “the euthanasia of the rentier,” as he put\nit—though all he really meant by this was their elimination through a gradual\nreduction of interest rates. As in so much of Keynesianism, this was much less\nradical than it first appeared. Actually it was thoroughly in the great\ntradition of political economy, hearkening back to Adam Smith’s ideal of a\ndebtless utopia but especially David Ricardo’s condemnation of landlords as\nparasites, their very existence inimical to economic growth. Keynes was simply\nproceeding along the same lines, seeing rentiers as a feudal holdover\ninconsistent with the true spirit of capital accumulation. Far from a\nrevolution, he saw it as the best way of avoiding one:\n\nI see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase\nwhich will disappear when it has done its work. And with the disappearance of\nits rentier aspect much else in it besides will suffer a sea-change. It will\nbe, moreover, a great advantage of the order of events which I am advocating,\nthat the euthanasia of the rentier, of the functionless investor, will be\nnothing sudden … and will need no\nrevolution.[23](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts023)\n\nWhen the Keynesian settlement was finally put into effect, after World War II,\nit was offered only to a relatively small slice of the world’s population. As\ntime went on, more and more people wanted in on the deal. Almost all of the\npopular movements of the period from 1945 to 1975, even perhaps revolutionary\nmovements, could be seen as demands for inclusion: demands for political\nequality that assumed equality was meaningless without some level of economic\nsecurity. This was true not only of movements by minority groups in North\nAtlantic countries who had first been left out of the deal—such as those for\nwhom Dr. King spoke—but what were then called “national liberation” movements\nfrom Algeria to Chile, or, finally, and perhaps most dramatically, in the late\n1960s and 1970s, feminism. At some point in the ’70s, things reached a\nbreaking point. It would appear that capitalism, as a system, simply cannot\nextend such a deal to everyone. Quite possibly it wouldn’t even remain viable\nif all its workers were free wage laborers; certainly it will never be able to\nprovide everyone in the world the sort of life lived by, say, a 1960s auto\nworker in Michigan or Turin with his own house, garage, and children in\ncollege—and this was true even before so many of those children began\ndemanding less stultifying lives. The result might be termed a crisis of\ninclusion. By the late 1970s, the existing order was clearly in a state of\ncollapse, plagued simultaneously by financial chaos, food riots, oil shock,\nwidespread doomsday prophecies of the end of growth and ecological crisis—all\nof which, it turned out, proved to be ways of putting the populace on notice\nthat all deals were off.\n\nThe moment that we start framing the story this way, it’s easy to see that the\nnext thirty years, the period from roughly 1978 to 2009, follows nearly the\nsame pattern. Except that the deal, the settlement, had changed. Certainly,\nwhen both Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the UK\nlaunched a systematic attack on the power of labor unions, as well as on the\nlegacy of Keynes, it was a way of explicitly declaring that all previous deals\nwere off. Everyone could now have political rights—even, by the 1990s, most\neveryone in Latin America and Africa—but political rights were to become\neconomically meaningless. The link between productivity and wages was chopped\nto bits: productivity rates have continued to rise, but wages have stagnated\nor even atrophied:[24](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts024)\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_010_r1.jpg)\n\nThis was accompanied, at first, by a return to “monetarism”: the doctrine that\neven though money was no longer in any way based in gold, or in any other\ncommodity, government and central-bank policy should be primarily concerned\nwith carefully controlling the money supply to ensure that it acted _as if_ it\nwere a scarce commodity. Even as, at the same time, the financialization of\ncapital meant that most money being invested in the marketplace was completely\ndetached from any relation to production of commerce at all, but had become\npure speculation.\n\nAll this is not to say that the people of the world were not being offered\nsomething: just that, as I say, the terms had changed. In the new\ndispensation, wages would no longer rise, but workers were encouraged to buy a\npiece of capitalism. Rather than euthanize the rentiers, _everyone_ could now\nbecome rentiers—effectively, could grab a chunk of the profits created by\ntheir own increasingly dramatic rates of exploitation. The means were many and\nfamiliar. In the United States, there were 401(k) retirement accounts and an\nendless variety of other ways of encouraging ordinary citizens to play the\nmarket; but at the same time, encouraging them to borrow. One of the guiding\nprinciples of Thatcherism and Reaganism alike was that economic reforms would\nnever gain widespread support unless ordinary working people could at least\naspire to owning their own homes; to this was added, by the 1990s and 2000s,\nendless mortgage-refinancing schemes that treated houses, whose value it was\nassumed would only rise, “like ATMs”—as the popular catchphrase had it, though\nit turns out, in retrospect, it was really more like credit cards. Then there\nwas the proliferation of actual credit cards, juggled against one another.\nHere, for many, “buying a piece of capitalism” slithered undetectably into\nsomething indistinguishable from those familiar scourges of the working poor:\nthe loan shark and the pawnbroker. It did not help here that in 1980, U.S.\nfederal usury laws, which had previously limited interest to between 7 and 10\npercent, were eliminated by act of Congress. Just as the United States had\nmanaged to largely get rid of the problem of political corruption by making\nthe bribery of legislators effectively legal (it was redefined as “lobbying”),\nso the problem of loan-sharking was brushed aside by making real interest\nrates of 25 percent, 50 percent, or even in some cases (for instance for\npayday loans) 120 percent annually, once typical only of organized crime,\nperfectly legal—and therefore, enforceable no longer by just hired goons and\nthe sort of people who place mutilated animals on their victims’ doorsteps,\nbut by judges, lawyers, bailiffs, and\npolice.[25](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts025)\n\nAny number of names have been coined to describe the new dispensation, from\nthe “democratization of finance” to the “financialization of everyday\nlife.”[26](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts026) Outside the United\nStates, it came to be known as “neoliberalism.” As an ideology, it meant that\nnot just the market, but capitalism (I must continually remind the reader that\nthese are not the same thing) became the organizing principle of almost\neverything. We were all to think of ourselves as tiny corporations, organized\naround that same relationship of investor and executive: between the cold,\ncalculating math of the banker, and the warrior who, indebted, has abandoned\nany sense of personal honor and turned himself into a kind of disgraced\nmachine.\n\nIn this world, “paying one’s debts” can well come to seem the very definition\nof morality, if only because so many people fail to do it. For instance, it\nhas become a regular feature of many sorts of business in America that large\ncorporations or even some small businesses, faced with a debt, will almost\nautomatically simply see what happens if they do not pay—complying only if\nreminded, goaded, or presented with some sort of legal writ. In other words,\nthe principle of honor has thus been almost completely removed from the\nmarketplace.[27](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts027) As a result,\nperhaps, the whole subject of debt becomes surrounded by a halo of religion.\n\nActually, one might even speak of a double theology, one for the creditors,\nanother for the debtors. It is no coincidence that the new phase of American\ndebt imperialism has also been accompanied by the rise of the evangelical\nright, who—in defiance of almost all previously existing Christian\ntheology—have enthusiastically embraced the doctrine of “supply-side\neconomics,” that creating money and effectively giving it to the rich is the\nmost Biblically appropriate way to bring about national prosperity. Perhaps\nthe most ambitious theologian of the new creed was George Gilder, whose book\n_Wealth and Poverty_ became a best-seller in 1981, at the very dawn of what\ncame to be known as the Reagan Revolution. Gilder’s argument was that those\nwho felt that money could not simply be created were mired in an old-\nfashioned, godless materialism that did not realize that just as God could\ncreate something out of nothing, His greatest gift to humanity was creativity\nitself, which proceeded in exactly the same way. Investors can indeed create\nvalue out of nothing by their willingness to accept the risk entailed in\nplacing their faith in others’ creativity. Rather than seeing the imitation of\nGod’s powers of creation _ex nihilo_ as hubris, Gilder argued that it was\nprecisely what God intended: the creation of money was a gift, a blessing, a\nchanneling of grace; a promise, yes, but not one that can be fulfilled, even\nif the bonds are continually rolled over, because through faith (“in God we\ntrust” again) their value becomes reality:\n\nEconomists who themselves do not believe in the future of capitalism will tend\nto ignore the dynamics of chance and faith that largely will determine that\nfuture. Economists who distrust religion will always fail to comprehend the\nmodes of worship by which progress is achieved. Chance is the foundation of\nchange and the vessel of the\ndivine.[28](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts028)\n\nSuch effusions inspired evangelists like Pat Robertson to declare supply-side\neconomics “the first truly divine theory of money-\ncreation.”[29](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts029)\n\nMeanwhile, for those who could not simply create money, there was a quite\ndifferent theological dispensation. “Debt is the new fat,” Margaret Atwood\nrecently remarked, struck by how much the advertisements that surround her\ndaily on the bus in her native Toronto had abandoned their earlier attempts to\nmake riders panic about the creeping terrors of sexual unattractiveness, but\ninstead turned to providing advice on how to free oneself from the much more\nimmediate terrors of the repo man:\n\nThere are even debt TV shows, which have a familiar religious-revival ring to\nthem. There are accounts of shopaholic binges during which you don’t know what\ncame over you and everything was a blur, with tearful confessions by those\nwho’ve spent themselves into quivering insomniac jellies of hopeless\nindebtedness, and have resorted to lying, cheating, stealing, and kiting\ncheques between bank accounts as a result. There are testimonials by families\nand loved ones whose lives have been destroyed by the debtor’s harmful\nbehaviour. There are compassionate but severe admonitions by the television\nhost, who here plays the part of priest or revivalist. There’s a moment of\nseeing the light, followed by repentance and a promise never to do it again.\nThere’s a penance imposed— _snip, snip_ go the scissors on the credit\ncards—followed by a strict curb-on-spending regimen; and finally, if all goes\nwell, the debts are paid down, the sins are forgiven, absolution is granted,\nand a new day dawns, in which a sadder but more solvent man you rise the\nmorrow morn.[30](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts030)\n\nHere, risk-taking is in no sense the vessel of the divine. Quite the opposite.\nBut for the poor it’s always different. In a way, what Atwood describes might\nbe seen as the perfect inversion of the prophetic voice of Reverend King’s “I\nHave a Dream” speech: whereas the first postwar age was about collective\nclaims on the nation’s debt to its humblest citizens, the need for those who\nhave made false promises to redeem themselves, now those same humble citizens\nare taught to think of themselves as sinners, seeking some kind of purely\nindividual redemption to have the right to any sort of moral relations with\nother human beings at all.\n\nAt the same time, there is something profoundly deceptive going on here. All\nthese moral dramas start from the assumption that personal debt is ultimately\na matter of self-indulgence, a sin against one’s loved ones—and therefore,\nthat redemption must necessarily be a matter of purging and restoration of\nascetic self-denial. What’s being shunted out of sight here is first of all\nthe fact that _everyone_ is now in debt (U.S. household debt is now estimated\nat on average 130 percent of income), and that very little of this debt was\naccrued by those determined to find money to bet on the horses or toss away on\nfripperies. Insofar as it was borrowed for what economists like to call\ndiscretionary spending, it was mainly to be given to children, to share with\nfriends, or otherwise to be able to build and maintain relations with other\nhuman beings that are based on _something_ other than sheer material\ncalculation.[31](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts031) One must go\ninto debt to achieve a life that goes in any way beyond sheer survival.\n\nInsofar as there is a politics, here, it seems a variation on a theme seen\nsince the dawn of capitalism. Ultimately, it’s sociality itself that’s treated\nas abusive, criminal, demonic. To this, most ordinary Americans—including\nBlack and Latino Americans, recent immigrants, and others who were formerly\nexcluded from credit—have responded with a stubborn insistence on continuing\nto love one another. They continue to acquire houses for their families,\nliquor and sound systems for parties, gifts for friends; they even insist on\ncontinuing to hold weddings and funerals, regardless of whether this is likely\nto send them skirting default or bankruptcy—apparently figuring that, as long\nas everyone now has to remake themselves as miniature capitalists, why\nshouldn’t they be allowed to create money out of nothing too?\n\nGranted, the role of discretionary spending itself should not be exaggerated.\nThe chief cause of bankruptcy in America is catastrophic illness; most\nborrowing is simply a matter of survival (if one does not have a car, one\ncannot work); and increasingly, simply being able to go to college now almost\nnecessarily means debt peonage for at least half one’s subsequent working\nlife.[32](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts032) Still, it is useful\nto point out that for real human beings survival is rarely enough. Nor should\nit be.\n\nBy the 1990s, the same tensions had begun to reappear on a global scale, as\nthe older penchant for loaning money for grandiose, state-directed projects\nlike the Aswan Dam gave way to an emphasis on microcredit. Inspired by the\nsuccess of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the new model was to identify\nbudding entrepreneurs in poor communities and provide them with small low-\ninterest loans. “Credit,” the Grameen Bank insisted, “is a human right.” At\nthe same time the idea was to draw on the “social capital”—the knowledge,\nnetworks, connections, and ingenuity that the poor people of the world are\nalready using to get by in difficult circumstances—and convert it into a way\nof generating even more (expansive) capital, able to grow at 5 to 20 percent\nannually.\n\nAs anthropologists like Julia Elyachar discovered, the result is double-edged.\nAs one unusually candid NGO consultant explained to her in Cairo in 1995:\n\nMoney is empowerment. This is empowerment money. You need to be big, need to\nthink big. Borrowers here can be imprisoned if they don’t pay, so why be\nworried?\n\nIn America we get ten offers for credit cards in the mail every day. You pay\nincredible real interest rates for that credit, something like 40 percent. But\nthe offer is there, so you get the card, and stuff your wallet full of credit\ncards. You feel good. It should be the same thing here, why not help them get\ninto debt? Do I really care what they use the money for, as long as they pay\nthe loan back?[33](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts033)\n\nThe very incoherence of the quote is telling. The only unifying theme seems to\nbe: people _ought_ to be in debt. It’s good in itself. It’s empowering.\nAnyway, if they end up too empowered, we can also have them arrested. Debt and\npower, sin and redemption, become almost indistinguishable. Freedom is\nslavery. Slavery is freedom. During her time in Cairo, Elyachar witnessed\nyoung graduates of an NGO training program go on strike for their right to\nreceive start-up loans. At the same time, just about everyone involved took it\nfor granted that most of their fellow students, not to mention everyone else\ninvolved in the program, was corrupt and exploiting the system as their\npersonal cash cow. Here too, aspects of economic life that had been based on\nlongstanding relations of trust were, through the intrusion of credit\nbureaucracies, becoming effectively criminalized.\n\nWithin another decade, the entire project—even in South Asia, where it\nbegan—began to appear suspiciously similar to the U.S. subprime mortgage\ncrisis: all sorts of unscrupulous lenders piled in, all sorts of deceptive\nfinancial appraisals were passed off to investors, interest accumulated,\nborrowers tried to collectively refuse payment, lenders began sending in goons\nto seize what little wealth they had (corrugated tin roofs, for example), and\nthe end result has been an epidemic of suicides by poor farmers caught in\ntraps from which their families could never, possibly,\nescape.[34](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts034)\n\nJust as in the 1945–1975 cycle, this new one culminated in another crisis of\ninclusion. It proved no more possible to really turn everyone in the world\ninto micro-corporations, or to “democratize credit” in such a way that every\nfamily that wanted to could have a house (and if you think about it, if we\nhave the means to build them, why shouldn’t they? are there families who don’t\n“deserve” houses?) than it had been to allow all wage laborers to have unions,\npensions, and health benefits. Capitalism doesn’t work that way. It is\nultimately a system of power and exclusion, and when it reaches the breaking\npoint, the symptoms recur, just as they had in the 1970s: food riots, oil\nshock, financial crisis, the sudden startled realization that the current\ncourse was ecological unsustainable, attendant apocalyptic scenarios of every\nsort.\n\nIn the wake of the subprime collapse, the U.S. government was forced to decide\nwho really gets to make money out of nothing: the financiers, or ordinary\ncitizens. The results were predictable. Financiers were “bailed out with\ntaxpayer money”—which basically means that their imaginary money was treated\nas if it were real. Mortgage holders were, overwhelmingly, left to the tender\nmercies of the courts, under a bankruptcy law that Congress had a year before\n(rather suspiciously presciently, one might add) made far more exacting\nagainst debtors. Nothing was altered. All major decisions were postponed. The\nGreat Conversation that many were expecting never happened.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nWe live, now, at a genuinely peculiar historical juncture. The credit crisis\nhas provided us with a vivid illustration of the principle set out in the last\nchapter: that capitalism cannot really operate in a world where people believe\nit will be around forever.\n\nFor most of the last several centuries, most people assumed that credit could\nnot be generated infinitely because they assumed that the economic system\nitself was unlikely to endure forever. The future was likely to be\nfundamentally different. Yet somehow, the anticipated revolutions never\nhappened. The basic structures of financial capitalism largely remained in\nplace. It’s only now, at the very moment when it’s becoming increasingly clear\nthat current arrangements are not viable, that we suddenly have hit the wall\nin terms of our collective imagination.\n\nThere is very good reason to believe that, in a generation or so, capitalism\nitself will no longer exist—most obviously, as ecologists keep reminding us,\nbecause it’s impossible to maintain an engine of perpetual growth forever on a\nfinite planet, and the current form of capitalism doesn’t seem to be capable\nof generating the kind of vast technological breakthroughs and mobilizations\nthat would be required for us to start finding and colonizing any other\nplanets. Yet faced with the prospect of capitalism actually ending, the most\ncommon reaction—even from those who call themselves “progressives”—is simply\nfear. We cling to what exists because we can no longer imagine an alternative\nthat wouldn’t be even worse.\n\nHow did we get here? My own suspicion is that we are looking at the final\neffects of the militarization of American capitalism itself. In fact, it could\nwell be said that the last thirty years have seen the construction of a vast\nbureaucratic apparatus for the creation and maintenance of hopelessness, a\ngiant machine designed, first and foremost, to destroy any sense of possible\nalternative futures. At its root is a veritable obsession on the part of the\nrulers of the world—in response to the upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s—with\nensuring that social movements cannot be seen to grow, flourish, or propose\nalternatives; that those who challenge existing power arrangements can never,\nunder any circumstances, be perceived to\nwin.[35](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts035) To do so requires\ncreating a vast apparatus of armies, prisons, police, various forms of private\nsecurity firms and police and military intelligence apparatus, and propaganda\nengines of every conceivable variety, most of which do not attack alternatives\ndirectly so much as create a pervasive climate of fear, jingoistic conformity,\nand simple despair that renders any thought of changing the world seem an idle\nfantasy. Maintaining this apparatus seems even more important, to exponents of\nthe “free market,” even than maintaining any sort of viable market economy.\nHow else can one explain what happened in the former Soviet Union? One would\nordinarily have imagined that the end of the Cold War would have led to the\ndismantling of the army and the KGB and rebuilding the factories, but in fact\nwhat happened was precisely the other way around. This is just an extreme\nexample of what has been happening everywhere. Economically, the apparatus is\npure dead weight; all the guns, surveillance cameras, and propaganda engines\nare extraordinarily expensive and really produce nothing, and no doubt it’s\nyet another element dragging the entire capitalist system down—along with\nproducing the illusion of an endless capitalist future that laid the\ngroundwork for the endless bubbles to begin with. Finance capital became the\nbuying and selling of chunks of that future, and economic freedom, for most of\nus, was reduced to the right to buy a small piece of one’s own permanent\nsubordination.\n\nIn other words, there seems to have been a profound contradiction between the\npolitical imperative of establishing capitalism as the only possible way to\nmanage anything, and capitalism’s own unacknowledged need to limit its future\nhorizons lest speculation, predictably, go haywire. Once it did, and the whole\nmachine imploded, we were left in the strange situation of not being able to\neven imagine any other way that things might be arranged. About the only thing\nwe can imagine is catastrophe.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nTo begin to free ourselves, the first thing we need to do is to see ourselves\nagain as historical actors, as people who can make a difference in the course\nof world events. This is exactly what the militarization of history is trying\nto take away.\n\nEven if we are at the beginning of the turn of a very long historical cycle,\nit’s still largely up to us to determine how it’s going to turn out. For\ninstance: the last time we shifted from a bullion economy to one of virtual\ncredit money, at the end of the Axial Age and the beginning of the Middle\nAges, the immediate shift was experienced largely as a series of great\ncatastrophes. Will it be the same this time around? Presumably a lot depends\non how consciously we set out to ensure that it won’t be. Will a return to\nvirtual money lead to a move away from empires and vast standing armies, and\nto the creation of larger structures limiting the depredations of creditors?\nThere is good reason to believe that all these things will happen—and if\nhumanity is to survive, they will probably have to—but we have no idea how\nlong it will take, or what, if it does, it would really look like. Capitalism\nhas transformed the world in many ways that are clearly irreversible. What I\nhave been trying to do in this book is not so much to propose a vision of\nwhat, precisely, the next age will be like, but to throw open perspectives,\nenlarge our sense of possibilities; to begin to ask what it would mean to\nstart thinking on a breadth and with a grandeur appropriate to the times.\n\nLet me give an example. I’ve spoken of two cycles of popular movements since\nWorld War II: the first (1945–1978), about demanding the rights of national\ncitizenship, the second (1978–2008), over access to capitalism itself. It\nseems significant here that in the Middle East, in the first round, those\npopular movements that most directly challenged the global status quo tended\nto be inspired by Marxism; in the second, largely, some variation on radical\nIslam. Considering that Islam has always placed debt at the center of its\nsocial doctrines, it’s easy to understand the appeal. But why not throw things\nopen even more widely? Over the last five thousand years, there have been at\nleast two occasions when major, dramatic moral and financial innovations have\nemerged from the country we now refer to as Iraq. The first was the invention\nof interest-bearing debt, perhaps sometime around 3000 bc; the second, around\n800 ad, the development of the first sophisticated commercial system that\nexplicitly rejected it. Is it possible that we are due for another? For most\nAmericans, it will seem an odd question, since most Americans are used to\nthinking of Iraqis either as victims or fanatics (this is how occupying powers\nalways think about the people they occupy), but it is worthy of note that the\nmost prominent working-class Islamist movement opposed to the U.S. occupation,\nthe Sadrists, take their name from one of the founders of contemporary Islamic\neconomics, Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr. True, much of what has since come to pass\nfor Islamic economics nowadays has proved decidedly\nunimpressive.[36](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts036) Certainly in\nno sense does it pose a direct challenge to capitalism. Still, one has to\nassume that among popular movements of this sort, all kinds of interesting\nconversations about, say, the status of wage labor must be taking place. Or\nperhaps it’s naïve to look for any new breakthrough from the puritanical\nlegacy of the old patriarchal rebellion. Perhaps it will come out of feminism.\nOr Islamic feminism. Or from some as yet completely unexpected quarter. Who’s\nto say? The one thing we can be confident of is that history is not over, and\nthat surprising new ideas will certainly emerge.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nThe one thing that’s clear is that new ideas won’t emerge without the\njettisoning of much of our accustomed categories of thought—which have become\nmostly sheer dead weight, if not intrinsic parts of the very apparatus of\nhopelessness—and formulating new ones. This is why I spent so much of this\nbook talking about the market, but also about the false choice between state\nand market that so monopolized political ideology for the last centuries that\nit made it difficult to argue about anything else.\n\nThe real history of markets is nothing like what we’re taught to think it is.\nThe earlier markets that we are able to observe appear to be spillovers, more\nor less; side effects of the elaborate administrative systems of ancient\nMesopotamia. They operated primarily on credit. Cash markets arose through\nwar: again, largely through tax and tribute policies that were originally\ndesigned to provision soldiers, but that later became useful in all sorts of\nother ways besides. It was only the Middle Ages, with their return to credit\nsystems, that saw the first manifestations of what might be called market\npopulism: the idea that markets could exist beyond, against, and outside of\nstates, as in those of the Muslim Indian Ocean—an idea that was later to\nreappear in China with the great silver revolts of the fifteenth century. It\nusually seems to arise in situations where merchants, for one reason or\nanother, find themselves making common cause with common people against the\nadministrative machinery of some great state. But market populism is always\nriddled with paradoxes, because it still does depend to some degree on the\nexistence of that state, and above all, because it requires founding market\nrelations, ultimately, in something other than sheer calculation: in the codes\nof honor, trust, and ultimately community and mutual aid, more typical of\nhuman economies.[37](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts037) This in\nturn means relegating competition to a relatively minor element. In this\nlight, we can see that what Adam Smith ultimately did, in creating his debt-\nfree market utopia, was to fuse elements of this unlikely legacy with that\nunusually militaristic conception of market behavior characteristic of the\nChristian West. In doing so he was surely prescient. But like all\nextraordinarily influential writers, he was also just capturing something of\nthe emerging spirit of his age. What we have seen ever since is an endless\npolitical jockeying back and forth between two sorts of populism—state and\nmarket populism—without anyone noticing that they were talking about the left\nand right flanks of exactly the same animal.\n\nThe main reason that we’re unable to notice, I think, is that the legacy of\nviolence has twisted everything around us. War, conquest, and slavery not only\nplayed the central role in converting human economies into market ones; there\nis literally no institution in our society that has not been to some degree\naffected. The story told at the end of [chapter\n7](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm), of how even our conceptions of\n“freedom” itself came to be transformed, through the Roman institution of\nslavery, from the ability to make friends, to enter into moral relations with\nothers, into incoherent dreams of absolute power, is only perhaps the most\ndramatic instance—and most insidious, because it leaves it very hard to\nimagine what meaningful human freedom would even be\nlike.[38](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts038)\n\nIf this book has shown anything, it’s exactly how much violence it has taken,\nover the course of human history, to bring us to a situation where it’s even\npossible to imagine that that’s what life is really about. Especially when one\nconsiders how much of our own daily experience flies directly in the face of\nit. As I’ve emphasized, communism may be the foundation of all human\nrelations—that communism that, in our own daily life, manifests itself above\nall in what we call “love”—but there’s always some sort of system of exchange,\nand usually, a system of hierarchy built on top of it. These systems of\nexchange can take an endless variety of forms, many perfectly innocuous.\nStill, what we are speaking of here is a very particular type of calculating\nexchange. As I pointed out in the very beginning: the difference between owing\nsomeone a favor, and owing someone a debt, is that the amount of a debt can be\nprecisely calculated. Calculation demands equivalence. And such\nequivalence—especially when it involves equivalence between human beings (and\nit always seems to start that way, because at first, human beings are always\nthe ultimate values)—only seems to occur when people have been forcibly\nsevered from their contexts, so much so that they can be treated as identical\nto something else, as in: “seven martin skins and twelve large silver rings\nfor the return of your captured brother,” “one of your three daughters as\nsurety for this loan of one hundred and fifty bushels of grain” …\n\nThis in turn leads to that great embarrassing fact that haunts all attempts to\nrepresent the market as the highest form of human freedom: that historically,\nimpersonal, commercial markets originate in theft. More than anything else,\nthe endless recitation of the myth of barter, employed much like an\nincantation, is the economists’ way of fending off any possibility of having\nto confront it. But even a moment’s reflection makes it obvious. Who was the\nfirst man to look at a house full of objects and to immediately assess them\nonly in terms of what he could trade them in for in the market likely to have\nbeen? Surely, he can only have been a thief. Burglars, marauding soldiers,\nthen perhaps debt collectors, were the first to see the world this way. It was\nonly in the hands of soldiers, fresh from looting towns and cities, that\nchunks of gold or silver—melted down, in most cases, from some heirloom\ntreasure, that like the Kashmiri gods, or Aztec breastplates, or Babylonian\nwomen’s ankle bracelets, was both a work of art and a little compendium of\nhistory—could become simple, uniform bits of currency, with no history,\nvaluable precisely for their lack of history, because they could be accepted\nanywhere, no questions asked. And it continues to be true. Any system that\nreduces the world to numbers can only be held in place by weapons, whether\nthese are swords and clubs, or nowadays, “smart bombs” from unmanned drones.\n\nIt can also only operate by continually converting love into debt. I know my\nuse of the word “love” here is even more provocative, in its own way, than\n“communism.” Still, it’s important to hammer the point home. Just as markets,\nwhen allowed to drift entirely free from their violent origins, invariably\nbegin to grow into something different, into networks of honor, trust, and\nmutual connectedness, so does the maintenance of systems of coercion\nconstantly do the opposite: turn the products of human cooperation,\ncreativity, devotion, love, and trust back into numbers once again. In doing\nso, they make it possible to imagine a world that is nothing more than a\nseries of cold-blooded calculations. Even more, by turning human sociality\nitself into debts, they transform the very foundations of our being—since what\nelse are we, ultimately, except the sum of the relations we have with\nothers—into matters of fault, sin, and crime, and making the world into a\nplace of iniquity that can only be overcome by completing some great cosmic\ntransaction that will annihilate everything.\n\nTrying to flip things around by asking, “What do we owe society?” or even\ntrying to talk about our “debt to nature” or some other manifestation of the\ncosmos is a false solution—really just a desperate scramble to salvage\nsomething from the very moral logic that has severed us from the cosmos to\nbegin with. In fact, it’s if anything the culmination of the process, the\nprocess brought to a point of veritable dementia, since it’s premised on the\nassumption that we’re so absolutely, thoroughly disentangled from the world\nthat we can just toss all other human beings—or all other living creatures,\neven, or the cosmos—in a sack, and then start negotiating with them. It’s\nhardly surprising that the end result, historically, is to see our life itself\nas something we hold on false premises, a loan long since overdue, and\ntherefore, to see existence itself as criminal. Insofar as there’s a real\ncrime here, though, it’s fraud. The very premise is fraudulent. What could\npossibly be more presumptuous, or more ridiculous, than to think it would be\npossible to negotiate with the grounds of one’s existence? Of course it isn’t.\nInsofar as it is indeed possible to come into any sort of relation with the\nAbsolute, we are confronting a principle that exists outside of time, or\nhuman-scale time, entirely; therefore, as Medieval theologians correctly\nrecognized, when dealing with the Absolute, there can be no such thing as\ndebt.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\n### Perhaps the World Really Does Owe You a Living\n\nMuch of the existing economic literature on credit and banking, when it turns\nto the kind of larger historical questions treated in this book, strikes me as\nlittle more than special pleading. True, earlier figures like Adam Smith and\nDavid Ricardo were suspicious of credit systems, but already by the\nmid–nineteenth century, economists who concerned themselves with such matters\nwere largely in the business of trying to demonstrate that, despite\nappearances, the banking system really was profoundly democratic. One of the\nmore common arguments was that it was really a way of funneling resources from\nthe “idle rich,” who, too unimaginative to do the work of investing their own\nmoney, entrusted it to others, to the “industrious poor”—who had the energy\nand initiative to produce new wealth. This justified the existence of banks,\nbut it also strengthened the hand of populists who demanded easy money\npolicies, protections for debtors, and so on—since, if times were rough, why\nshould the industrious poor, the farmers and artisans and small businessmen,\nbe the ones to suffer?\n\nThis gave rise to a second line of argument: that no doubt the rich were the\nmajor creditors in the ancient world, but now the situation has been reversed.\nSo Ludwig von Mises, writing in the 1930s, around the time when Keynes was\ncalling for the euthanasia of the rentiers:\n\nPublic opinion has always been biased against creditors. It identifies\ncreditors with the idle rich and debtors with the industrious poor. It abhors\nthe former as ruthless exploiters and pities the latter as innocent victims of\noppression. It considers government action designed to curtail the claims of\nthe creditors as measures extremely beneficial to the immense majority at the\nexpense of a small minority of hardboiled usurers. It did not notice at all\nthat nineteenth-century capitalist innovations have wholly changed the\ncomposition of the classes of creditors and debtors. In the days of Solon the\nAthenian, of ancient Rome’s agrarian laws, and of the Middle Ages, the\ncreditors were by and large the rich and the debtors the poor. But in this age\nof bonds and debentures, mortgage banks, saving banks, life insurance\npolicies, and social security benefits, the masses of people with more\nmoderate income are rather themselves\ncreditors.[39](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts039)\n\nWhereas the rich, with their leveraged companies, are now the principal\ndebtors. This is the “democratization of finance” argument and it is nothing\nnew: whenever there are some people calling for the elimination of the class\nthat lives by collecting interest, there will be others to object that this\nwill destroy the livelihood of widows and pensioners.\n\nThe remarkable thing is that nowadays, defenders of the financial system are\noften prepared to use both arguments, appealing to one or the other according\nto the rhetorical convenience of the moment. On the one hand, we have\n“pundits” like Thomas Friedman, celebrating the fact that “everyone” now owns\na piece of Exxon or Mexico, and that rich debtors are therefore answerable to\nthe poor. On the other, Niall Ferguson, author of _The Ascent of Money_ ,\npublished in 2009, can still announce as one of his major discoveries that:\n\nPoverty is not the result of rapacious financiers exploiting the poor. It has\nmuch more to do with the lack of financial institutions, with the absence of\nbanks, not their presence. Only when borrowers have access to efficient credit\nnetworks can they escape from the clutches of loan sharks, and only when\nsavers can deposit their money in reliable banks can it be channeled from the\nidle rich to the industrious\npoor.[40](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts040)\n\nSuch is the state of the conversation in the mainstream literature. My purpose\nhere has been less to engage with it directly than to show how it has\nconsistently encouraged us to ask the wrong questions. Let’s take this last\nparagraph as an illustration. What is Ferguson really saying here? Poverty is\ncaused by a lack of credit. It’s only if the industrious poor have access to\nloans from stable, respectable banks—rather than to loan sharks, or,\npresumably, credit card companies, or payday loan operations, which now charge\nloan-shark rates—that they can rise out of poverty. So actually Ferguson is\nnot really concerned with “poverty” at all, just with the poverty of some\npeople, those who are industrious and thus do not deserve to be poor. What\nabout the non-industrious poor? They can go to hell, presumably (quite\nliterally, according to many branches of Christianity). Or maybe their boats\nwill be lifted somewhat by the rising tide. Still, that’s clearly incidental.\nThey’re undeserving, since they’re not industrious, and therefore what happens\nto them is really beside the point.\n\nFor me, this is exactly what’s so pernicious about the morality of debt: the\nway that financial imperatives constantly try to reduce us all, despite\nourselves, to the equivalent of pillagers, eyeing the world simply for what\ncan be turned into money—and then tell us that it’s only those who are willing\nto see the world as pillagers who deserve access to the resources required to\npursue anything in life _other_ than money. It introduces moral perversions on\nalmost every level. (“Cancel all student loan debt? But that would be unfair\nto all those people who struggled for years to pay back their student loans!”\nLet me assure the reader that, as someone who struggled for years to pay back\nhis student loans and finally did so, this argument makes about as much sense\nas saying it would be “unfair” to a mugging victim not to mug their neighbors\ntoo.)\n\nThe argument might perhaps make sense if one agreed with the underlying\nassumption—that work is by definition virtuous, since the ultimate measure of\nhumanity’s success as a species is its ability to increase the overall global\noutput of goods and services by at least 5 percent per year. The problem is\nthat it is becoming increasingly obvious that if we continue along these lines\nmuch longer, we’re likely to destroy everything. That giant debt machine that\nhas, for the last five centuries, reduced increasing proportions of the\nworld’s population to the moral equivalent of conquistadors would appear to be\ncoming up against its social and ecological limits. Capitalism’s inveterate\npropensity to imagine its own destruction has morphed, in the last half-\ncentury, into scenarios that threaten to bring the rest of the world down with\nit. And there’s no reason to believe that this propensity is ever going to go\naway. The real question now is how to ratchet things down a bit, to move\ntoward a society where people can live more by working less.\n\nI would like, then, to end by putting in a good word for the non-industrious\npoor.[41](Grae_9781612190983_epub_nts1_r1.htm#c12-nts041) At least they aren’t\nhurting anyone. Insofar as the time they are taking time off from work is\nbeing spent with friends and family, enjoying and caring for those they love,\nthey’re probably improving the world more than we acknowledge. Maybe we should\nthink of them as pioneers of a new economic order that would not share our\ncurrent one’s penchant for self-destruction.\n\n![](images/Grae_9781612190983_epub_L03_r1.jpg)\n\nIn this book I have largely avoided making concrete proposals, but let me end\nwith one. It seems to me that we are long overdue for some kind of Biblical-\nstyle Jubilee: one that would affect both international debt and consumer\ndebt. It would be salutary not just because it would relieve so much genuine\nhuman suffering, but also because it would be our way of reminding ourselves\nthat money is not ineffable, that paying one’s debts is not the essence of\nmorality, that all these things are human arrangements and that if democracy\nis to mean anything, it is the ability to all agree to arrange things in a\ndifferent way. It is significant, I think, that since Hammurabi, great\nimperial states have invariably resisted this kind of politics. Athens and\nRome established the paradigm: even when confronted with continual debt\ncrises, they insisted on legislating around the edges, softening the impact,\neliminating obvious abuses like debt slavery, using the spoils of empire to\nthrow all sorts of extra benefits at their poorer citizens (who, after all,\nprovided the rank and file of their armies), so as to keep them more or less\nafloat—but all in such a way as never to allow a challenge to the principle of\ndebt itself. The governing class of the United States seems to have taken a\nremarkably similar approach: eliminating the worst abuses (e.g., debtors’\nprisons), using the fruits of empire to provide subsidies, visible and\notherwise, to the bulk of the poulation; in more recent years, manipulating\ncurrency rates to flood the country with cheap goods from China, but never\nallowing anyone to question the sacred principle that we must all pay our\ndebts.\n\nAt this point, however, the principle has been exposed as a flagrant lie. As\nit turns out, we don’t “all” have to pay our debts. Only some of us do.\nNothing would be more important than to wipe the slate clean for everyone,\nmark a break with our accustomed morality, and start again.\n\nWhat is a debt, anyway? A debt is just the perversion of a promise. It is a\npromise corrupted by both math and violence. If freedom (real freedom) is the\nability to make friends, then it is also, necessarily, the ability to make\nreal promises. What sorts of promises might genuinely free men and women make\nto one another? At this point we can’t even say. It’s more a question of how\nwe can get to a place that will allow us to find out. And the first step in\nthat journey, in turn, is to accept that in the largest scheme of things, just\nas no one has the right to tell us our true value, no one has the right to\ntell us what we truly owe.\n\n\n# NOTES\n\n## Chapter One\n\n[1.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts001a) With the predictable\nresults that they weren’t actually built to make it easier for Malagasy people\nto get around in their own country, but mainly to get products from the\nplantations to ports to earn foreign exchange to pay for building the roads\nand railways to begin with.\n\n[2.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts002a) The United States, for\nexample, only recognized the Republic of Haiti in 1860.

In retrospect, they didn’t.\nAIG’s Financial Products division, for instance, made $2.5 billion in pretax\nprofits in 2005, largely by selling underpriced insurance on complex, poorly\nunderstood securities. Often described as ‘picking up nickels in front of a\nsteamroller,’ this strategy is profitable in ordinary years, and catastrophic\nin bad ones. As of last fall, AIG had outstanding insurance on more than $400\nbillion in securities. To date, the U.S. government, in an effort to rescue\nthe company, has committed about $180 billion in investments and loans to\ncover losses that AIG’s sophisticated risk modeling had said were virtually\nimpossible.” (Johnson 2010) Johnson of course passes over the possibility that\nAIG knew perfectly well what was eventually going to happen, but simply didn’t\ncare, since they knew the steamroller was going to flatten someone else.\n\n[12.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c01_r1.htm#c01-nts012a) In contrast, England\nalready had a national bankruptcy law in 1571.

Aristotle used the term _métadosis_ ,\nwhich in his day normally meant “sharing” or “sharing out.” Since Smith, this\nhas usually been translated “barter,” but as Karl Polanyi (1957a:93) has long\nsince emphasized, this is probably inaccurate, unless Aristotle was\nintroducing an entirely new meaning for the term. Theorists of the origin of\nGreek money from Laum (1924) to Seaford (2004) have emphasized that customs of\napportioning goods (e.g., war booty, sacrificial meat), probably did play a\nkey role in the development of Greek currency.

It took canonical\nform in the work of his student, Karl Bücher (1907).

To provide an extremely simplified version: say\nthere was only one bank. Even if that bank were to make you a loan of a\ntrillion dollars based on no assets of its own of any kind whatever, you would\nultimately end up putting the money back into the bank again, which would mean\nthat the bank would now have one trillion in debt, and one trillion in working\nassets, perfectly balancing each other out. If the bank was charging you more\nfor the loan than it was giving you in interest (which banks always do), it\nwould also make a profit. The same would be true if you spent the\ntrillion—whoever ended up with the money would still have to put it into the\nbank again. Keynes pointed out the existence of multiple banks didn’t really\nchange anything, provided bankers coordinated their efforts, which, in fact,\nthey always do.\n\n[29.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c03_r1.htm#c03-nts029a) I might note that this\nassumption echoes the logic of neoclassical economic theory, which assumes\nthat all basic institutional arrangements that define the context of economic\nactivity were agreed to by all parties at some imaginary point in the past,\nand that since then, everything has and will always continue to exist in\nequilibrium. Interestingly, Keynes explicitly rejected this assumption in his\ntheory of money (Davidson 2006).

For a good discussion of the fiduciarity of ancient\ncurrencies, see Seaford 2004:139–146. Almost all metal coins were overvalued.\nIf the government set the value below that of the metal, of course, people\nwould simply melt them down; if it’s set at exactly the metal value, the\nresults are usually deflationary. As Bruno Théret (2008:826–27) points out,\nalthough Locke’s reforms, which set the value of the British sovereign at\nexactly its weight in silver, were ideologically motivated, they had\ndisastrous economic effects. Obviously, if coinage is debased or the value\notherwise set too high in relation to the metal content, this can produce\ninflation. But the traditional view, where, say, the Roman currency was\nultimately destroyed by debasement, is clearly false, since it took centuries\nfor inflation to occur (Ingham 2004:102–3).\n\n[3.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts003a) Einzig 1949:104; similar\ngambling chits, in this case made of bamboo, were used in Chinese towns in the\nGobi desert (ibid: 108).\n\n[4.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts004a) On English token money,\nsee Williamson 1889; Whiting 1971; Mathias 1979b.\n\n[5.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts005a) On cacao, Millon 1955; on\nEthopian salt money, Einzig 1949:123–26.

Deleuze and Guattari, most embarrassingly, insist that “the great\nbook of modern ethnology is not so much Mauss’ _The Gift_ as Nietzsche’s _On\nthe Genealogy of Morals_. At least it should be,” since, they say, Nietzsche\nsucceeds in interpreting “primitive society” in terms of debt, where Mauss\nstill hesitates to break with the logic of exchange (1972:224–25). On their\ninspiration, Sarthou-Lajus (1997) has written philosophy of debt as an\nalternative to bourgeois ideologies of exchange, that, she claims, assume the\nprior autonomy of the person. Of course what Nietzsche proposes is not an\nalternative at all. It’s another aspect of the same thing. All this is a vivid\nreminder of how easy it is to mistake radicalized forms of our own bourgeois\ntradition as alternatives to it (Bataille [1993], who Deleuze and Guattari\npraise as another alternative to Mauss in the same passage, is another\nnotorious example of this sort of thing).\n\n[9.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts009a) _Genealogy of Morals_\n2.5.\n\n[10.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts010a) Nietzsche had clearly\nbeen reading too much Shakespeare.

Stone notes that while public “wife-sales” in English villages were\napparently really prearranged divorces, “the details of the ritual were\ndesigned to emphasize the final nature of the transfer of property, by\nimitating as closely as possible the sale of a cow or a sheep. A halter was\nused to lead the wife from her home to the market, and from the market to the\nhouse of her purchaser.” (1990:145) The practice, confined to the popular\nclasses, caused a scandal when documented in Hardy’s _Mayor of Casterbridge_ ,\nbut it was only completely abandoned in 1919.\n\n[43.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts043a) Finley 1981:153–55;\nStienkeller 2003; Mieroop 2005:27–28.

As I’ve written\nelsewhere (Graeber 2006:66–69; 2007:91–94), wage-labor contracts in the\nancient world were primarily a matter of the rental of slaves—a practice that\nin Mesopotamia is first documented only in neo-Babylonian times (Oppenheim\n1964:78, VerSteeg 2000:70–71; for an Egyptian parallel VerSteeg 2002:197).\n\n[44.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts044a) The entire issue has\nbeen complicated by Herodotus’ claim (1.199) that all Babylonian women other\nthan daughters of the elite were expected to prostitute themselves at temples,\nonce, to earn the money for their dowries. This was certainly false, but it\nhas caused the terms of debate to become rather confused between people\ninsisting on the importance of “hierodules” or even claiming that all\nprostitution was effectively sacred (e.g., Kramer 1969, Lambert 1992) and\nthose rejecting the entire notion as Orientalist fantasy (Arnaud 1973,\nWestenholz 1989, Beard & Henderson 1997, Assante 2003). However, recently\npublished texts from Kish and Sippar make clear that sexual rituals involving\ntemple women, at least some of whom were paid for their services, definitely\ndid take place (Gallery 1980; Yoffee 1998; Stol 1995:138–39) The devadasi\nanalogy incidentally was first to my knowledge proposed in Yoffee 1998:336.

Testart (2000, 2001:148–49, 190) emphasizes that the case of\nChina confirms his “general sociological law,” that societies that practice\nbrideprice will also allow debt slavery (Testart, Lécrivain, Karadimas &\nGovoroff 2001), since this was a place where the government vainly tried to\nstop both. Another aspect of Confucianism was that male slavery was seen as\nmuch more dubious than female slavery; though it never went as far as in\nKorea, where after the invasion of Hideyoshi, a law was passed decreeing that\n_only_ women could be enslaved.\n\n[55.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts055a) Tambiah (1973, 1989) was\nthe first to make what is now the standard critique of Goody’s argument.

It is, however, used for “compensation,”\nin the sense of wergeld or honor-price (Seaford 2004:198n46). The first\nattested use of _time_ as purchase price is in the slightly later Homeric Hymn\nto Demeter (132) where, as Seaford notes, it seems significant that in fact it\nrefers to a slave.\n\n[58.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts058a) Aristotle, _Constitution\nof the Athenians_ 2.2.

(On learning of\nthis, her father later hanged himself.) In the Iliad, Achilles insists he\nloves her. Briseis’ opinions were not considered worth recording, though later\npoets, uncomfortable with the idea that the greatest epic of antiquity was a\ncelebration of simple rape, concocted a story whereby Briseis had actually\nlong been in love with Achilles from afar, and somehow manipulated the course\nof events so as to cause the battle to begin with.\n\n[67.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts067a) Homeric warriors weren’t\nreally aristocrats at all, or if they were, as Calhoun puts it (1934:308) they\nwere aristocrats “only in the loosest sense of the word.” Mostly they were\njust a collection of local chieftains and ambitious warriors.\n\n[68.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts068a) See Kurke 1997:112–13,\n1999:197–98 for Greek elaborations on the theme. So too Seaford: “Whereas the\nHomeric _gift_ is invested with the personality of its heroic donor, the only\nkind of person that _money_ resembles is the prostitute. For Shakespeare it is\n‘the common whore of all mankind’ ” (2002:156, emphasis in the original. For\nwhat it’s worth, Seaford is slightly off here: Shakespeare described the\n_earth_ as the “common whore of all mankind,” whose womb produces gold, which\nis money _[Timon of Athens_ 4.3.42–45].)\n\n[69.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts069a) Seaford 2002 in his\nreview of Kurke notes that Greek sources regularly go back and forth on this.\n\n[70.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts070a) In the _Odyssey_\n(11.488–91), famously, Achilles, when trying to invoke the lowest and most\nmiserable person he can possibly imagine, invokes not a slave but a _thete_ ,\na mere laborer unattached to any household.\n\n[71.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts071a) Free _porne_ were always\nthe daughters of foreigners or resident aliens.

Or, to be more exact, for a man to\nsubmit to the passive role in sodomy was illegal; one could be stripped of\none’s citizenship for having done so. While most adult men were involved in\nlove affairs with boys, and most boys with men, all did so under the pretense\nthat no intercourse was actually taking place; as a result, almost anyone\ncould be accused of former impropriety. The most famous case here is\nAeschines’ _Against Timarchus_ (see van Reden 2003:120–23, also Dillon\n2003:117–28.) Exactly the same dilemmas resurface in Rome, where Cicero, for\ninstance, accused his rival Marc Antony of having once made his living as a\nmale prostitute (Philippics 2.44–45), and Octavian, the later Augustus, was\nwidely reputed to have “prostituted” himself, as a youth, to Julius Caesar,\namong other powerful patrons (Suetonius _Augustus_ 68).\n\n[74.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts074a) The most famous cases\nwere Athens, Corinth, and Megara (Asheri 1969; St. Croix 1981; Finley\n1981:156–57.)\n\n[75.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts075a) The law was called the\n_palintokia_ and is known mainly from Plutarch _(Moralia_ 295D, apparently\ndrawing on a lost Aristotelian _Constitution of the Megarians.)_ Almost\neverything about it is at issue in current scholarship (Asheri 1969:14–16;\nFigueria 1985:149–56, Millettt 1989: 21–22; Hudson 1992:31; Bryant\n1994:100–044). Hudson for instance argues that since the event is said to have\nhappened around 540 bc, at a time when interest-bearing loans might not even\nhave existed, the whole story is likely to be later propaganda. Others suggest\nthat it really happened much later. It’s interesting that all Greek sources\ntreat this as a most radical and outrageous populist measure—despite the fact\nthat similar measures became standard Catholic policy during most of the\nEuropean Middle Ages.\n\n[76.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts076a) It is entirely unclear\nwhether loans at interest even existed in this early period, since the first\napparent reference to interest is from roughly 475 bc, and the first utterly\nclear ones from the later part of that same century (Bogaert 1966, 1968;\nFinley 1981; Millett 1991a: 44–45; Hudson 1992).\n\n[77.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts077a) Compare for example\nLeviticus 25:35–37, which stipulates that it is permissible to make an\nimpoverished “fellow countryman” a client or tenant, but _not_ to give him an\ninterest-bearing loan.\n\n[78.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts078a) As Hesiod emphasizes in\n_Works and Days_ (II 344–63); he’s our main source on such matters. Paul\nMillett (1991a:30–35) provides a close reading of this passage, to illustrate\nthe ambiguities between gifts and loans. Millett’s book _Lending and Borrowing\nin Ancient Athens_ (op cit) is the basic work on that topic. Scholarship on\nthe Greek economy has long been preoccupied by what’s still (rather\nanachronistically) called the Primitivist-Modernist debate; Millett takes a\nstrong Primitivist position and has taken predictable heat from the other side\n(e.g., Cohen 1995, Shipley 1997, 2001). Most of the debate, though, turns on\nthe prevalence of commercial lending, which is tangential to my present\nconcerns.\n\n[79.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts079a) The story is so striking\nbecause Nasruddin almost never elsewhere behaves in a way that a contemporary\naudience would consider unfair or exploitative. Those stories that do always\nfocus on his relations with his neighbor the miser—the listener is presumed to\nknow that being a miser, he must, necessarily, be up to no good.\n\n[80.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts080a) “Against Nicostratus”\n(Demosthenes 53). My version largely follows Millet (1991a:53–59) but also\ndraws on Trevett 1992, Dillon 2002:94–100, Harris 2006:261–63). The\ninterpretation of Nicostratus’ motives is my own; Dillon, for example,\nsuspects that the entire story of his kidnapping and ransom at Aegina was made\nup—though if that were the case, one would imagine Apollodorus would have\neventually found out and told the jurors. The text doesn’t explicitly say that\nNicostratus was an aristocrat, but this seems the most plausible explanation\nof why someone might have a comfortable country estate but no money.\nApollodorus, though, was known, from other contexts, to have feared that his\nfellow citizens would have contempt for his lowly background, and tried to\ncompensate by lavish—and some felt, over-lavish—generosity (see Ballin 1978;\nTrevett 1992).\n\n[81.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts081a) Athenians when trying to\nbe high-minded at least spoke as if fellow citizens should behave this way to\none another; to loan money at interest to a citizen in dire need was treated\nas obviously reprehensible behavior (Millett 1991a:26). All philosophers who\ntouched on the subject, starting with Plato _(Laws_ 742c, 921c) and Aristotle\n_(Politics_ 1258c) denounced interest as immoral. Obviously not everyone felt\nthat way. Here as in the Middle East, from whence the custom had spread\n(Hudson 1992), the dilemma was that charging interest made obvious sense in\nthe case of commercial loans, but easily became abusive in the case of\nconsumer loans.\n\n[82.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts082a) It’s not clear whether\ndebt slavery, or at least debt peonage, was anywhere entirely eliminated, and\ndebt crises continued to occur at regular intervals in cities other than\nAthens (Asheri 1969; St. Croix 1981). Some (Rhodes 1981:118–27; Cairns 1991;\nHarris 2006:249–80) believe that debt bondage was not even entirely eliminated\nin Athens. Millett (1991a:76) is probably right to say that imperial capitals\nlike Athens, and later Rome, fended off the dangers of debt crises and\nresulting unrest less by forbidding the practice than by funneling tribute\nmoney into social programs that provided a constant source of funds for the\npoor, making usury largely unnecessary.\n\n[83.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts083a) Millett 1991b:189–92.\nThe same was true in Roman Galilee (Goodman 1983:55), and presumably in Rome\nas well (Howgego 1992:13).\n\n[84.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts084a) the Furies, who pursue\nOrestes to avenge his killing of his mother, insist that they are collecting a\ndebt due in blood (Aeschylus, Eumenides 260, 319.) Millett (1991a:6–7)\ncompiles a number of examples. Korver (1934, cf. Millet 1991:29–32)\ndemonstrates that there was never any formal distinction between “gift” and\n“loan”; the two continually shaded into each other.\n\n[85.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts085a) The two were seen to be\nconnected: Herodotus, famously, argued that for the Persians, the greatest\ncrime was to lie, and that they therefore forbade the loaning of money at\ninterest since it would necessarily give rise to untruthful behavior (1.138).\n\n[86.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts086a) Plato _Republic_ 331c.\n\n[87.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts087a) Plato Republic 345d.

It’s\nnot entirely clear if Plato was taken in an act of piracy, sold on the orders\nof an angry ex-patron, or seized as a prisoner of war (Aegina—Plato’s\nbirthplace, incidentally—was then at war with Athens.) But the lines blurred.\nCuriously, Diogenes the Cynic, a younger contemporary of Plato, was also\ncaptured by pirates on a trip to Aegina around the same time. In his case no\none came to his aid (unsurprising considering that he rejected all worldly\nattachments and tended to insult everyone he met). He ended up spending the\nrest of his life as a slave in Corinth (Diogenes Laertius, 4.9). Plato,\nAristotle, and Diogenes were the three most famous philosophers of the fourth\ncentury; the fact that two of the three had the experience of standing on an\nauction block demonstrates that such things really could happen to anyone.\n\n[90.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts090a) Plato recounts the\nevents in his _Seventh Letter to Dion_ , but Annikeris only appears in\nDiogenes Laertius 3.19–20.\n\n[91.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts091a) Ihering 1877.\n\n[92.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts092a) Rights _“in rem,”_ or\n“in the thing,” are considered to be held “against all the world,” since “a\nduty is incumbent on all persons whatsoever to abstain from acts injurious to\nthe right”—this is opposed to rights “ _in personem,”_ which are held against\na specific individual or group of individuals (Digby & Harrison 1897:301).\nGarnsey (2007:177–178) notes that Proudhon (1840) was correct in insisting\nthat the “absolute” nature of property rights in the French Civil Code and\nother paradigmatic modern legal documents goes back directly to Roman law,\n_both_ to the notion of absolute private property, and to that of the\nemperor’s absolute sovereignty.\n\n[93.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts093a) The idea that Roman\nproperty was not a right goes back to Villey (1946), and became mainstream in\nEnglish scholarship with Tuck (1979:7–13) and Tierney (1997), though Garnsey\n(2007:177–95) has recently made a convincing case that Roman jurists did see\nproperty as a right _(ius)_ in the sense that one had a right of alienation,\nand to defend one’s claims in court.

It was only a century later, under Hadrian (117–138 ad), that\nowners were forbidden to kill their slaves, maintain private dungeons for them\nor practice other cruel and excessive punishments. Interestingly, the gradual\nlimitation of the power of slave-owners was accompanied by increasing state\npower, expansion of citizenship, but also the return of various forms of debt-\nbondage and the creation of dependent peasantry (Finley 1972:92–93;\n1981:164–65).\n\n[109.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts109a) Thus Livy (41.9.11)\nnotes in 177 bc the senate actually passed a law to prevent Italians who were\nnot Roman citizens from selling relatives into slavery in this way in order to\nbecome citizens.\n\n[110.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts110a) The phrase is preserved\nin the work of the elder Seneca _(Controversias_ 4.7) and noted by Finley\n(1980:96), among others.

This was a very new\nnotion in the ancient world; the Greeks, for instance, had insisted that while\nmen could do as they liked with their women, children, and slaves, any ruler\nwho exploited their own subjects in the same way was the definition of a\ntyrant. Even the basic principle of modern sovereignty, that rulers hold the\nultimate power of life and death over their subjects (which modern heads of\nstate still hold in their power to grant pardons), was looked on with\nsuspicion. Similarly, under the Republic, Cicero argued that rulers who\ninsisted on holding the power of life and death were by definition tyrants,\n“even if they prefer to be called kings” (De _Re Publica_ 3.23, Westbrook\n1999:204.)\n\n[116.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts116a) In the Chronicle of\nWalter of Guisborough (1957:216); see Clanchy 1993:2–5.\n\n[117.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts117a) Aylmer 1980.\n\n[118.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts118a) To be fair, a classical\nliberal would insist that this is the logical conclusion with starting out\nfrom the notion of freedom as active instead of passive (or as philosophers\nput it, that there are “subjective rights”)—that is, seeing freedom not just\nas others’ obligations to allow us to do whatever the law or custom says we\ncan do, but to do anything that is not specifically forbidden, and that this\nhas had tremendous liberating effects.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, like just about all similar\ndocuments, also speaks of universal rights to food and shelter, but one never\nreads about governments committing “human rights abuses” when they eliminate\nprice supports on basic foodstuffs, even if it leads to widespread\nmalnutrition, or for razing shantytowns or kicking the homeless out of\nshelters.\n\n[123.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts123a) One can trace the\nnotion back as least as far back as Seneca, who in the first century ad,\nargued that slaves could be free in their minds, since force only applied to\nthe “prison of the body” _(De ben-eficiis_ 3.20)—this appears to have been a\nkey point of transition between the notion of freedom as the ability to form\nmoral relations with others, and freedom as an internalization of the master’s\npower.\n\n[124.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-nts124a) See Roitman 2003:224\nfor one author who explicitly relates this to debt.

It is certainly interesting that\nsince the nineteenth century at least, the “transition from feudalism to\ncapitalism” has become our historical paradigm for epochal social change, and\nno one much addresses the transition from ancient slavery to feudalism, even\nthough there is reason to believe that whatever is happening now may much more\nclosely resemble it.\n\n[3.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts003a) Robin Blackburn makes\nthis argument quite convincingly in _The Making of New World Slavery_ (1997).\nThere were some exceptions, notably the Italian city-states.

He concludes that silver was largely\nused in transactions between merchants. Market vendors therefore presumably\nacted as they do in small-scale markets in Africa and Central Asia, today,\nbuilding up lists of trustworthy clients to whom they could extend credit over\ntime (e.g., Hart 1999:201, Nazpary 2001).\n\n[8.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c08_r1.htm#c08-nts008a) Hudson 2002:21–23, who\nhypothesizes that the time element was important as merchants would presumably\notherwise delay to employ the funds as long as possible.

Given what we know of Mesopotamia, with which the Harappan\ncivilization was in close contact, it also seems reasonable to assume that\nthey continued to employ older commercial techniques, and, indeed, “promissory\nnotes” do appear as familiar practices in our earliest literary sources, such\nas the Jakatas (Rhys Davids 1901:16, Thapar 1995:125, Fiser 2004:194), even if\nthese are many centuries later. Of course, in this case, the marks were\npresumably meant to confirm the accuracy of the weight, to show that it hadn’t\nbeen further trimmed, but the inspiration of earlier credit practices seems\nlikely.

The key question is the organization of\nlabor, and in Tang times this remains somewhat opaque, since even if\nstatistics were available, which they’re not, it’s difficult to know what\nterms like “serf,” “slave,” and “wage-laborer” actually meant in practice.\n\n[43.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts043a) Gernet 1956\n[1995:116–39], Ch’en 1964:269–71, on land reclamation and monastic slaves.\n\n[44.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts044a) “It is claimed that the\npurpose of this generosity is to relieve the poor and orphans.

It is probably significant that the word _fu_ , meaning “tally,”\nalso could mean “an auspicious omen granted to a prince as a token of his\nappointment by Heaven” (Mathews 1931:283). Similarly, Peng notes a passage\nfrom _Strategems of the Warring States_ , about a lord attempting to win\npopular support: “Feng hurried to Bi, where he had the clerks assemble all\nthose people who owed debts, so that his tallies might be matched against\ntheirs. When the tallies had been matched, Feng brought forth a false order to\nforgive these debts, and he burned the tallies. The people all cheered”\n(ibid:100n9).

See Bulliet 1979 (also\nLapidus 2003:141–46) on the process of conversion. Bulliet also emphasizes\n(ibid:129) that the main effect of mass conversion was to make the ostensible\njustification of government, as protector and expander of the faith, seem\nincreasingly hollow. Mass popular support for caliphs and political leaders\nonly reemerged in periods, like the Crusades or during the _reconquista_ in\nSpain, when Islam itself seemed under attack; as of course, for similar\nreasons, it has in much of the Islamic world today.\n\n[61.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts061a) “Most of the time the\nlower circles paid their taxes through their heads, and looked after\nthemselves.

This is often represented as a wise policy of refusal to “debase” the\ncoinage, but it might equally be read as meaning that the caliph’s signature\nadded no additional value.

As\nhe puts it (ibid:127), “the _inalienability of liberty_ is one of the\nfundamental and uncontested principles of Islam.” Fathers do not have the\nright to sell their children, and individuals do not have the right to sell\nthemselves—or at least, if they do, no courts will recognize any resultant\nownership claims.

I am in no position to\nweigh in but, if true, this would suggest that the ban on usury really emerged\nin Iraq itself as part of the process of the creation of grassroots Islam,\nwhich would actually reinforce my general argument.\n\n[69.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts069a) The best records we have\nare actually from a community of Jewish merchants in Geniza, in twelfth-\ncentury Egypt, who observed the ban on interest even in dealings with one\nanother. The one area where we regularly hear of interest being charged is the\none area where coercion was also regularly employed: that is, in dealings with\nkings, viziers, and officials, who often borrowed large sums of money at\ninterest—especially, but not exclusively, from Jewish or Christian bankers—to\npay their troops. Obliging a request for such an illegal loan was a dangerous\nbusiness, but refusing even more so (for Abbasid examples, see Ray 1997:68–70,\nmainly drawing from Fischel 1937).\n\n[70.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts070a) There were also a whole\nhost of legal subterfuges (called _hiyal)_ that one might undertake if one\nwere absolutely determined to charge interest: for instance, buying one’s\ndebtor’s house for the amount of the loan, charging them rent for it, and then\nallowing them to buy it back for the same sum; having one’s debtor agree to\nbuy a certain product monthly and sell it to one at a discount, and so forth.\nSome schools of Islamic law banned these outright; others merely disapproved.\nIt used to be assumed that these methods were widely employed, since most\neconomic historians assumed interest to be a necessary element of credit, but\nrecent research provides no evidence that they were especially common (for the\nolder view: Khan 1929, for the new: Ray 1997:58–59).\n\n[71.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts071a) Mez 1922:448, quoted in\nLabib 1969:89. Note that Basra, the city where everyone in the market paid by\ncheck, was also the city where, a century later, Mongol attempts to introduce\ngovernment-issue paper money were so doggedly resisted.

I am no doubt\nunderplaying the government role in all this: there were, for instance,\nattempts to set up central government banks, and certainly usually a\ncommitment in principle that the government should enforce commercial\nstandards and regulations. It seems, however, that this rarely came to much in\npractice.\n\n[74.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts074a) Udovitch 1970:71–74.\n\n[75.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c10_r1.htm#c10-nts075a) Sarakhsi in Udovitch\n1975:11, who has a good discussion of the issues involved.

Generally the\nTreasury puts out bonds to the public, and the Fed buys them back. The Fed\nthen loans the money thus created to other banks at a special low rate of\ninterest (“the prime rate”), so that those banks can then lend at higher ones.\nIn its capacity as regulator of the banking system, the Fed also establishes\nthe fractional reserve rate: just how many dollars these banks can\n“lend”—effectively, create—for every dollar they borrow from the Fed, or have\non deposit, or can otherwise count as assets. Technically this is 10 to 1, but\na variety of legal loopholes allow banks to go considerably higher.\n\n[10.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts010a) Which does raise the\nrather interesting question of what its gold reserves are actually for.\n\n[11.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts011a) Indeed, perhaps the\ngreatest compromise to United States global power in recent years is the fact\nthat there is now one place—the region of China facing Taiwan—where air\ndefenses are now so dense and sophisticated that the United States Air Force\nis no longer certain that it can penetrate at will.

The story is based on a piece\nfrom the _Wall Street Journal_ , “Don’t Monetize the Debt: The president of\nthe Dallas Fed on inflation risk and central bank independence” (Mary\nAnastasia O’Grady, _WSJ_ , May 23, 2009.) I should add that in popular usage\nnowadays, “to monetize the debt” is generally used as a synonym for “printing\nmoney” to pay debt. This usage has become almost universal, but it’s not the\noriginal sense of the term, which is to turn the debt itself into money. The\nBank of England did not print money to pay the national debt; it turned the\nnational debt itself into money. Here too there is a profound argument going\non about the nature of money itself.\n\n[19.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts019a) The arrangement is\nsometimes referred to as Bretton Woods II (Dooley, Folkerts-Landau & Garber\n2004, 2009): effectively, an agreement since the 1990s at least to use various\nunofficial means to keep the dollar’s value artificially high, and East Asian\ncurrencies—particularly the Chinese—artificially low, in order to expedite\ncheap Asian exports to the United States. Since real wages in the United\nStates have either stagnated or retreated continually since the 1970s, this,\nand the accumulation of consumer debt, is the only reason living standards in\nthe United States have not precipitously declined.\n\n[20.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts020a) On Zheng He, see Dreyer\n2006, Wade 2004, Wake 1997.

It left state interest ceilings in place, but institutions like\ncredit-card companies were allowed to observe the laws of the state in which\nthey are registered, no matter where they operated. This is why most are\nregistered in South Dakota, which has no maximum interest rate.\n\n[26.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts026a) The first is from Thomas\nFriedman (1999) in a cocky and vacuous book called _The Lexus and the OIive\nTree_ , the second from Randy Martin (2002) in a book of the same name.\n\n[27.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts027a) In America this\n“universal otherness” is accomplished above all through racism. This is why\nmost small retailing in the United States is conducted on ethnic lines: say,\nKorean grocers or dry-cleaners, who pool credit with one another, whose\nclients, however, are sufficiently socially distant that there is no question\nof extending credit outside, or even expecting basic relations of trust—since\nthey themselves ordinarily expect electricians, locksmiths, contractors of\nvarious sorts who provide services to at least attempt to shaft them.\nEssentially the market across racial or ethnic lines becomes one where\neveryone is assumed to be Amalek.\n\n[28.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts028a) Gilder 1981:266, cited\nin Cooper 2008:7.

This is, incidentally,\nalso the best response to conventional critiques of the poor as falling into\ndebt because they are unable to delay gratification—another way in which\neconomic logic, with all its human blind spots, skews any possible\nunderstanding of “consumers’ ” actual motivations. Rationally, since CDs yield\naround 4 percent annually, and credit cards charge 20 percent, consumers\nshould save as a cushion and only go into debt when they absolutely have to,\npostponing unnecessary purchases until there’s a surplus. Very few act this\nway, but this is rarely because of improvidence (can’t wait to get that flashy\nnew dress) but because human relations can’t actually be put off in the same\nway as imaginary “consumer purchases”: one’s daughter will only be five once,\nand one’s grandfather has only so many years left.\n\n[32.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts032a) There are so many books\non the subject that one hesitates to cite, but a couple of outstanding\nexamples are Anya Kamentz’s _Generation Debt_ (2006), and Brett William’s\n_Social History of the Credit Trap_ (2004). The larger point about demands for\ndebt as a form of class struggle is in large part inspired by the Midnight\nNotes collective, who argue that, however paradoxically, “neoliberalism has\nthrown open a new dimension of struggle between capital and the working class\nwithin the domain of credit” (2009:7). I have followed this analysis to a\ndegree, but tried to move away from the economistic framing of human life as\n“reproduction of labor” that hobbles so much Marxist literature—the emphasis\non life beyond survival might be distantly Vaneigem-influenced (1967), but\nlargely falls back on my own work on value theory (Graeber 2001).\n\n[33.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts033a) Elyachar 2002:510.\n\n[34.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts034a) See for instance,\n“India’s micro-finance suicide epidemic,” Soutik Biswas, BBC News South Asia,\n16 December 2010, [http.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-\nasia-11997571](http://www.http.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11997571)\n\n[35.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts035a) I have observed this\nfirst hand on any number of occasions in my work as an activist: police are\nhappy to effectively shut down trade summits, for example, just to ensure that\nthere’s no possible chance that protestors can feel they have succeeded in\ndoing so themselves.\n\n[36.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts036a) In practice, it mainly\nconsists of “interest-free” banking arrangements that pay lip service to the\nnotion of profit-sharing but in reality operate in much the same way as any\nother bank. The problem is that if profit-sharing banks are competing with\nmore conventional ones in the same marketplace, those who anticipate that\ntheir enterprises will yield high profits will gravitate toward the ones\noffering fixed-interest loans, and only those who anticipate lower profits\nwill turn to the profit-sharing option (Kuran 1995:162). For a transition to\nno-interest banking to work, it would have to be total.\n\n[37.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts037a) Under the Caliphate, to\nguarantee the money supply; in China, through systematic intervention to\nstabilize markets and prevent capitalistic monopolies; later, in the United\nStates and other North Atlantic republics, through allowing the monetization\nof its own debt.\n\n[38.](Grae_9781612190983_epub_c12_r1.htm#c12-nts038a) True, as I showed in\nchapter 5, economic life will always be a matter of clashing principles, and\nthus might be said to be incoherent to a certain extent.

Anarchist or anarchist-inspired movements are\ngrowing everywhere; traditional anarchist principles—autonomy, voluntary\nassociation, self-organization, mutual aid, direct democracy—have gone from\nthe basis for organizing within the globalization movement, to playing the\nsame role in radical movements of all kinds everywhere. Revolutionaries in\nMexico, Argentina, India, and elsewhere have increasingly abandoned even\ntalking about seizing power, and begun to formulate radically different ideas\nof what a revolution would even mean. Most, admittedly, fall shy of actually\nusing the word “anarchist.” But as Barbara Epstein has recently pointed out\nanarchism has by now largely taken the place Marxism had in the social\nmovements of the ‘60s: even those who do not consider themselves anarchists\nfeel they have to define themselves in relation to it, and draw on its ideas.\n\nYet all this has found almost no reflection in the academy. Most academics\nseem to have only the vaguest idea what anarchism is even about; or dismiss it\nwith the crudest stereotypes. (“Anarchist organization! But isn’t that a\ncontradiction in terms?”) In the United States there are thousands of academic\nMarxists of one sort or another, but hardly a dozen scholars willing openly to\ncall themselves anarchists.\n\nSo are academics just behind the curve here? It’s possible. Perhaps in a few\nyears the academy will be overrun by anarchists. But I’m not holding my\nbreath. It does seem that Marxism has an affinity with the academy that\nanarchism never will. It was, after all, the only great social movement that\nwas invented by a Ph.D., even if afterwards, it became a movement intending to\nrally the working class. Most accounts of the history of anarchism assume it\nwas basically similar: anarchism is presented as the brainchild of certain\nnineteenth-century thinkers—Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, etc.—it then went on\nto inspire working-class organizations, became enmeshed in political\nstruggles, divided into sects... Anarchism, in the standard accounts, usually\ncomes out as Marxism’s poorer cousin, theoretically a bit flat-footed but\nmaking up for brains, perhaps, with passion and sincerity. But in fact, the\nanalogy is strained at best. The nineteenth-century “founding figures” did not\nthink of themselves as having invented anything particularly new. The basic\nprinciples of anarchism— self-organization, voluntary association, mutual aid—\nreferred to forms of human behavior they assumed to have been around about as\nlong as humanity. The same goes for the rejection of the state and of all\nforms of structural violence, inequality, or domination (anarchism literally\nmeans “without rulers”), even the assumption that all these forms are somehow\nrelated and reinforce each other. None of it was presented as some startling\nnew doctrine. And in fact it was not: one can find records of people making\nsimilar arguments throughout history, despite the fact there is every reason\nto believe that in most times and places, such opinions were the ones least\nlikely to be written down. We are talking less about a body of theory, then,\nthan about an attitude, or perhaps one might even say a faith: the rejection\nof certain types of social relations, the confidence that certain others would\nbe much better ones on which to build a livable society, the belief that such\na society could actually exist.\n\nEven if one compares the historical schools of Marxism, and anarchism, one can\nsee we are dealing with a fundamentally different sort of project. Marxist\nschools have authors. Just as Marxism sprang from the mind of Marx, so we have\nLeninists, Maoists, Trotksyites, Gramscians, Althusserians... (Note how the\nlist starts with heads of state and grades almost seamlessly into French\nprofessors.) Pierre Bourdieu once noted that, if the academic field is a game\nin which scholars strive for dominance, then you know you have won when other\nscholars start wondering how to make an adjective out of your name. It is,\npresumably, to preserve the possibility of winning the game that intellectuals\ninsist, in discussing each other, on continuing to employ just the sort of\nGreat Man theories of history they would scoff at in just about any other\ncontext: Foucault’s ideas, like Trotsky’s, are never treated as primarily the\nproducts of a certain intellectual milieu, as something that emerged from\nendless conversations and arguments involving hundreds of people, but always,\nas if they emerged from the genius of a single man (or, very occasionally,\nwoman). It’s not quite either that Marxist politics organized itself like an\nacademic discipline or that it has become a model for how radical\nintellectuals, or increasingly, all intellectuals, treated one another;\nrather, the two developed somewhat in tandem. From the perspective of the\nacademy, this led to many salutary results—the feeling there should be some\nmoral center, that academic concerns should be relevant to people’s lives—but\nalso, many disastrous ones: turning much intellectual debate into a kind of\nparody of sectarian politics, with everyone trying to reduce each others’\narguments into ridiculous caricatures so as to declare them not only wrong,\nbut also evil and dangerous—even if the debate is usually taking place in\nlanguage so arcane that no one who could not afford seven years of grad school\nwould have any way of knowing the debate was going on.\n\nNow consider the different schools of anarchism. There are Anarcho-\nSyndicalists, Anarcho-Communists, Insurrectionists, Cooperativists,\nIndividualists, Platformists... None are named after some Great Thinker;\ninstead, they are invariably named either after some kind of practice, or most\noften, organizational principle. (Significantly, those Marxist tendencies\nwhich are not named after individuals, like Autonomism or Council Communism,\nare also the ones closest to anarchism.) Anarchists like to distinguish\nthemselves by what they do, and how they organize themselves to go about doing\nit. And indeed this has always been what anarchists have spent most of their\ntime thinking and arguing about. Anarchists have never been much interested in\nthe kinds of broad strategic or philosophical questions that have historically\npreoccupied Marxists—questions like: Are the peasants a potentially\nrevolutionary class? (Anarchists consider this something for the peasants to\ndecide.) What is the nature of the commodity form? Rather, they tend to argue\nwith each other about what is the truly democratic way to go about a meeting,\nat what point organization stops being empowering and starts squelching\nindividual freedom. Or, alternately, about the ethics of opposing power: What\nis direct action? Is it necessary (or right) to publicly condemn someone who\nassassinates a head of state? Or can assassination, especially if it prevents\nsomething terrible, like a war, be a moral act? When is it okay to break a\nwindow?\n\nTo sum up then:\n\n1\\. Marxism has tended to be a theoretical or analytical discourse about\nrevolutionary strategy.\n\n2\\. Anarchism has tended to be an ethical discourse about revolutionary\npractice.\n\nObviously, everything I’ve said has been something of a caricature (there have\nbeen wildly sectarian anarchist groups, and plenty of libertarian,\npracticeoriented Marxists including, arguably, myself). Still, even so stated,\nthis does suggest a great deal of potential complementarity between the two.\nAnd indeed there has been: even Mikhail Bakunin, for all his endless battles\nwith Marx over practical questions, also personally translated Marx’s\n_Capital_ into Russian. But it also makes it easier to understand why there\nare so few anarchists in the academy. It’s not just that anarchism does not\ntend to have much use for high theory. It’s that it is primarily concerned\nwith forms of practice; it insists, before anything else, that one’s means\nmust be consonant with one’s ends; one cannot create freedom through\nauthoritarian means; in fact, as much as possible, one must oneself, in one’s\nrelations with one’s friends and allies, embody the society one wishes to\ncreate. This does not square very well with operating within the university,\nperhaps the only Western institution other than the Catholic Church and\nBritish monarchy that has survived in much the same form from the Middle Ages,\ndoing intellectual battle at conferences in expensive hotels, and trying to\npretend all this somehow furthers revolution. At the very least, one would\nimagine being an openly anarchist professor would mean challenging the way\nuniversities are run—and I don’t mean by demanding an anarchist studies\ndepartment, either—and that, of course, is going to get one in far more\ntrouble than anything one could ever write.\n\nThis does not mean anarchist theory is impossible.\n\nThis doesn’t mean anarchists have to be _against_ theory. After all, anarchism\nis, itself, an idea, even if a very old one. It is also a project, which sets\nout to begin creating the institutions of a new society “within the shell of\nthe old,” to expose, subvert, and undermine structures of domination but\nalways, while doing so, proceeding in a democratic fashion, a manner which\nitself demonstrates those structures are unnecessary. Clearly any such project\nhas need of the tools of intellectual analysis and understanding. It might not\nneed High Theory, in the sense familiar today. Certainly it will not need one\nsingle, Anarchist High Theory. That would be completely inimical to its\nspirit. Much better, I think, something more in the spirit of anarchist\ndecision-making processes, employed in anything from tiny affinity groups to\ngigantic spokescouncils of thousands of people. Most anarchist groups operate\nby a consensus process which has been developed, in many ways, to be the exact\nopposite of the high-handed, divisive, sectarian style so popular amongst\nother radical groups. Applied to theory, this would mean accepting the need\nfor a diversity of high theoretical perspectives, united only by certain\nshared commitments and understandings. In consensus process, everyone agrees\nfrom the start on certain broad principles of unity and purposes for being for\nthe group; but beyond that they also accept as a matter of course that no one\nis ever going to convert another person completely to their point of view, and\nprobably shouldn’t try; and that therefore discussion should focus on concrete\nquestions of action, and coming up with a plan that everyone can live with and\nno one feels is in fundamental violation of their principles. One could see a\nparallel here: a series of diverse perspectives, joined together by their\nshared desire to understand the human condition, and move it in the direction\nof greater freedom. Rather than be based on the need to prove others’\nfundamental assumptions wrong, it seeks to find particular projects on which\nthey reinforce each other. Just because theories are incommensurable in\ncertain respects does not mean they cannot exist or even reinforce each other,\nany more than the fact that individuals have unique and incommensurable views\nof the world means they cannot become friends, or lovers, or work on common\nprojects.\n\nEven more than High Theory, what anarchism needs is what might be called Low\nTheory: a way of grappling with those real, immediate questions that emerge\nfrom a transformative project. Mainstream social science actually isn’t much\nhelp here, because normally in mainstream social science this sort of thing is\ngenerally classified as “policy issues,” and no self-respecting anarchist\nwould have anything to do with these.\n\n\n### against policy (a tiny manifesto):\n\nThe notion of “policy” presumes a state or governing apparatus which imposes\nits will on others. “Policy” is the negation of politics; policy is by\ndefinition something concocted by some form of elite, which presumes it knows\nbetter than others how their affairs are to be conducted. By participating in\npolicy debates the very best one can achieve is to limit the damage, since the\nvery premise is inimical to the idea of people managing their own affairs.\n\nSo in this case, the question becomes: What sort of social theory would\nactually be of interest to those who are trying to help bring about a world in\nwhich people are free to govern their own affairs?\n\nThis is what this pamphlet is mainly about.\n\nFor starters, I would say any such theory would have to begin with some\ninitial assumptions. Not many. Probably just two. First, it would have to\nproceed from the assumption that, as the Brazilian folk song puts it, “another\nworld is possible.” That institutions like the state, capitalism, racism and\nmale dominance are not inevitable; that it would be possible to have a world\nin which these things would not exist, and that we’d all be better off as a\nresult. To commit oneself to such a principle is almost an act of faith, since\nhow can one have certain knowledge of such matters? It might possibly turn out\nthat such a world is _not_ possible. But one could also make the argument that\nit’s this very unavailability of absolute knowledge which makes a commitment\nto optimism a moral imperative: Since one cannot know a radically better world\nis not possible, are we not betraying everyone by insisting on continuing to\njustify, and reproduce, the mess we have today? And anyway, even if we’re\nwrong, we might well get a lot closer.\n\n\n### against anti-utopianism (another tiny manifesto):\n\nHere of course one has to deal with the inevitable objection: that utopianism\nhas lead to unmitigated horror, as Stalinists, Maoists, and other idealists\ntried to carve society into impossible shapes, killing millions in the\nprocess.\n\nThis argument belies a fundamental misconception: that imagining better worlds\nwas itself the problem. Stalinists and their ilk did not kill because they\ndreamed great dreams—actually, Stalinists were famous for being rather short\non imagination—but because they mistook their dreams for scientific\ncertainties. This led them to feel they had a right to impose their visions\nthrough a machinery of violence. Anarchists are proposing nothing of the sort,\non either count. They presume no inevitable course of history and one can\nnever further the course of freedom by creating new forms of coercion. In fact\nall forms of systemic violence are (among other things) assaults on the role\nof the imagination as a political principle, and the only way to begin to\nthink about eliminating systematic violence is by recognizing this.\n\nAnd of course one could write very long books about the atrocities throughout\nhistory carried out by cynics and other pessimists...\n\nSo that’s the first proposition. The second, I’d say, is that any anarchist\nsocial theory would have to reject self-consciously any trace of vanguardism.\nThe role of intellectuals is most definitively not to form an elite that can\narrive at the correct strategic analyses and then lead the masses to follow.\nBut if not that, what? This is one reason I’m calling this essay “Fragments of\nan Anarchist _Anthropology”—because_ this is one area where I think\nanthropology is particularly well positioned to help. And not only because\nmost actually-existing self-governing communities, and actually-existing non-\nmarket economies in the world have been investigated by anthropologists rather\nthan sociologists or historians. It is also because the practice of\nethnography provides at least something of a model, if a very rough, incipient\nmodel, of how nonvanguardist revolutionary intellectual practice might work.\nWhen one carries out an ethnography, one observes what people do, and then\ntries to tease out the hidden symbolic, moral, or pragmatic logics that\nunderlie their actions; one tries to get at the way people’s habits and\nactions makes sense in ways that they are not themselves completely aware of.\nOne obvious role for a radical intellectual is to do precisely that: to look\nat those who are creating viable alternatives, try to figure out what might be\nthe larger implications of what they are (already) doing, and then offer those\nideas back, not as prescriptions, but as contributions, possibilities—as\ngifts. This is more or less what I was trying to do a few paragraphs ago when\nI suggested that social theory could refashion itself in the manner of direct\ndemocratic process. And as that example makes clear, such a project would\nactually have to have two aspects, or moments if you like: one ethnographic,\none utopian, suspended in a constant dialogue.\n\nNone of this has much to do with what anthropology, even radical anthropology,\nhas actually been like over the last hundred years or so. Still, there has\nbeen a strange affinity, over the years, between anthropology and anarchism\nwhich is in itself significant.\n\n\n### Graves, Brown, Mauss, Sorel\n\nIt’s not so much that anthropologists embraced anarchism, or even, were\nconsciously espousing anarchist ideas; it’s more that they moved in the same\ncircles, their ideas tended to bounce off one another, that there was\nsomething about anthropological thought in particular—its keen awareness of\nthe very range of human possibilities—that gave it an affinity to anarchism\nfrom the very beginning.\n\nLet me start with Sir James Frazer, even though he was the furthest thing from\nan anarchist. Frazer, chair of anthropology in Cambridge at the turn of the\n(last) century, was a classic stodgy Victorian who wrote accounts of savage\ncustoms, based mainly on the results of questionnaires sent out to\nmissionaries and colonial officials. His ostensible theoretical attitude was\nutterly condescending—he believed almost all magic, myth and ritual was based\non foolish logical mistakes—but his magnum opus, _The Golden Bough,_ contained\nsuch florid, fanciful, and strangely beautiful descriptions of tree spirits,\neunuch priests, dying vegetation gods, and the sacrifice of divine kings, that\nhe inspired a generation of poets and literati. Among them was Robert Graves,\na British poet who first became famous for writing bitingly satirical verse\nfrom the trenches of World War I. At the end of the war, Graves ended up in a\nhospital in France where he was cured of shell shock by W. H. R. Rivers, the\nBritish anthropologist famous for the Torres Straits Expedition, who doubled\nas a psychiatrist. Graves was so impressed by Rivers that he was later to\nsuggest professional anthropologists be placed in charge of all world\ngovernments. Not a particularly anarchist sentiment, certainly—but Graves\ntended to dart about between all sorts of odd political positions. In the end,\nhe was to abandon “civilization”—industrial society—entirely and spend the\nlast fifty years or so of his life in a village on the Spanish island of\nMajorca, supporting himself by writing novels, but also producing numerous\nbooks of love poetry, and a series of some of the most subversive essays ever\nwritten.\n\nGraves’ thesis was, among other things, that greatness was a pathology; “great\nmen” were essentially destroyers and “great” poets not much better (his arch-\nenemies were Virgil, Milton and Pound), that all real poetry is and has always\nbeen a mythic celebration of an ancient Supreme Goddess, of whom Frazer had\nonly confused glimmerings, and whose matriarchal followers were conquered and\ndestroyed by Hitler’s beloved Aryan hoards when they emerged from the\nUkrainian Steppes in the early Bronze Age (though they survived a bit longer\nin Minoan Crete). In a book called _The White Goddess: An Historical Grammar\nof Poetic Myth,_ he claimed to map out the rudiments of her calendar rites in\ndifferent parts of Europe, focusing on the periodic ritual murder of the\nGoddess’ royal consorts, among other things a surefire way of guaranteeing\nwould-be great men do not get out of hand, and ending the book with a call for\nan eventual industrial collapse. I say “claimed” advisedly here. The\ndelightful, if also confusing, thing about Graves’ books is that he’s\nobviously having so much fun writing them, throwing out one outrageous thesis\nafter another, that it’s impossible to tell how much of it is meant to be\ntaken seriously. Or whether that’s even a meaningful question. In one essay,\nwritten in the ‘50s, Graves invents the distinction between “reasonableness”\nand “rationality” later made famous by Stephen Toulmin in the ‘80s, but he\ndoes it in the course of an essay written to defend Socrates’ wife, Xanthippe,\nfrom her reputation as an atrocious nag. (His argument: imagine you had been\nmarried to Socrates.)\n\nDid Graves really believe that women are always superior to men? Did he really\nexpect us to believe he had solved one mythical problem by falling into an\n“analeptic trance” and overhearing a conversation about fish between a Greek\nhistorian and Roman official in Cyprus in 54 CE? It’s worth wondering, because\nfor all their current obscurity, in these writings, Graves essentially\ninvented two different intellectual traditions which were later to become\nmajor theoretical strains in modern anarchism—if admittedly, generally\nconsidered two of the most _outré._ On the one hand, the cult of the Great\nGoddess has been revived and become a direct inspiration for Pagan Anarchism,\nhippyish performers of spiral dances who are always welcome at mass actions\nbecause they do seem to have rather a knack for influencing the weather; on\nthe other, Primitivists, whose most famous (and extreme) avatar is John\nZerzan, who has taken Graves’ rejection of industrial civilization and hopes\nfor general economic collapse even further, arguing that even agriculture was\na great historical mistake. Both the Pagans and the Primitivists, curiously,\nshare exactly that ineffable quality which makes Graves’ work so distinctive:\nit’s really impossible to know on what level one is supposed to read it. It’s\nboth ridiculous self-parody, and terribly serious, at the same time.\n\nThere have also been anthropologists—among them, some of the founding figures\nof the discipline— who have themselves dabbled with anarchist, or anarchistic,\npolitics.\n\nThe most notorious case was that of a turn of the century student named Al\nBrown, known to his college friends as “Anarchy Brown.” Brown was an admirer\nof the famous anarchist Prince (he of course renounced his title), Peter\nKropotkin, arctic explorer and naturalist, who had thrown social Darwinism\ninto a tumult from which it still has never quite recovered by documenting how\nthe most successful species tend to be those which cooperate the most\neffectively. (Sociobiology for instance was basically an attempt to come up\nwith an answer to Kropotkin.) Later, Brown was to begin affecting a cloak and\na monocle, adopting a fancy mock-aristocratic hyphenated name (A. R.\nRadcliffe-Brown), and ultimately, in the 1920s and ‘30s, becoming the master\ntheorist of British social anthropology. The older Brown didn’t like to talk\ntoo much about his youthful politics, but it’s probably no coincidence that\nhis main theoretical interest remained the maintenance of social order outside\nthe state.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing case though is that of Marcel Mauss, Radcliffe-\nBrown’s contemporary, and the inventor of French anthropology. Mauss was a\nchild of Orthodox Jewish parents who had the mixed blessing of also being the\nnephew of Emile Durkheim, the founder of French sociology. Mauss was also a\nrevolutionary socialist. For much of his life, he managed a consumer coop in\nParis, and was constantly writing screeds for socialist newspapers, carrying\nout projects of research on coops in other countries, and trying to create\nlinks between coops in order to build an alternative, anti-capitalist,\neconomy. His most famous work was written in response to the crisis of\nsocialism he saw in Lenin’s reintroduction of the market in the Soviet Union\nin the ‘20s: If it was impossible to simply legislate the money economy away,\neven in Russia, the least monetarized society in Europe, then perhaps\nrevolutionaries needed to start looking at the ethnographic record to see what\nsort of creature the market really was, and what viable alternatives to\ncapitalism might look like. Hence his “Essay on the Gift,” written in 1925,\nwhich argued (among other things) that the origin of all contracts lies in\ncommunism, an unconditional commitment to another’s needs, and that despite\nendless economic textbooks to the contrary, there has never been an economy\nbased on barter: that actually-existing societies which do not employ money\nhave instead been gift economies in which the distinctions we now make between\ninterest and altruism, person and property, freedom and obligation, simply did\nnot exist.\n\nMauss believed socialism could never be built by state fiat but only\ngradually, from below, that it was possible to begin building a new society\nbased on mutual aid and self-organization “in the shell of the old”; he felt\nthat existing popular practices provided the basis both for a moral critique\nof capitalism and possible glimpses of what that future society would be like.\nAll of these are classic anarchist positions. Still, he did not consider\nhimself an anarchist. In fact, he never had anything good to say about them.\nThis was, it appears, because he identified anarchism mainly with the figure\nof Georges Sorel, an apparently quite personally distasteful French anarcho-\nsyndicalist and anti-Semite, now mainly famous for his essay _Reflections sur\nle Violence._ Sorel argued that since the masses were not fundamentally good\nor rational, it was foolish to make one’s primary appeal to them through\nreasoned arguments. Politics is the art of inspiring others with great myths.\nFor revolutionaries, he proposed the myth of an apocalyptic General Strike, a\nmoment of total transformation. To maintain it, he added, one would need a\nrevolutionary elite capable of keeping the myth alive by their willingness to\nengage in symbolic acts of violence—an elite which, like the Marxist vanguard\nparty (often somewhat less symbolic in its violence), Mauss described as a\nkind of perpetual conspiracy, a modern version of the secret political men’s\nsocieties of the ancient world.\n\nIn other words, Mauss saw Sorel, and hence anarchism, as introducing an\nelement of the irrational, of violence, and of vanguardism. It might seem a\nbit odd that among French revolutionaries of the time, it should have been the\ntrade unionist emphasizing the power of myth, and the anthropologist\nobjecting, but in the context of the ‘20s and ‘30s, with fascist stirrings\neverywhere, it’s understandable why a European radical-—especially a Jewish\none-—might see all this as just a little creepy. Creepy enough to throw cold\nwater even on the otherwise rather appealing image of the General Strike—which\nis after all about the least violent possible way to imagine an apocalyptic\nrevolution. By the ‘40s, Mauss concluded his suspicions had proved altogether\njustified.\n\nTo the doctrine of the revolutionary vanguard, he wrote, Sorel added a notion\noriginally culled from Mauss’ own uncle Durkheim: a doctrine of corporatism,\nof vertical structures glued together by techniques of social solidarity. This\nhe said was a great influence on Lenin, by Lenin’s own admission. From there\nit was adopted by the Right. By the end of his life, Sorel himself had become\nincreasingly sympathetic with fascism; in this he followed the same trajectory\nas Mussolini (another youthful dabbler with anarcho-syndicalism) and who,\nMauss believed, took these same Durkheimian/Sorelian/Leninist ideas to their\nultimate conclusions. By the end of his life, Mauss became convinced even\nHitler’s great ritual pageants, torch-lit parades with their chants of “Seig\n_Heil!,”_ were really inspired by accounts he and his uncle had written about\ntotemic rituals of Australian aborigines. “When we were describing how ritual\ncan create social solidarity, of submerging the individual in the mass,” he\ncomplained, “it never occurred to us that anyone would apply such techniques\nin the modern day!” (In fact, Mauss was mistaken. Modern research has shown\nNuremberg rallies were actually inspired by Harvard pep rallies. But this is\nanother story.) The outbreak of war destroyed Mauss, who had never completely\nrecovered from losing most of his closest friends in the First World War. When\nthe Nazis took Paris he refused to flee, but sat in his office every day with\na pistol in his desk, waiting for the Gestapo to arrive. They never did, but\nthe terror, and weight of his feelings of historical complicity, finally\nshattered his sanity.\n\n\n### The anarchist anthropology that almost already does exist\n\nIn the end, though, Marcel Mauss has probably had more influence on anarchists\nthan all the other ones combined. This is because he was interested in\nalternative moralities, which opened the way to thinking that societies\nwithout states and markets were the way they were because they actively wished\nto live that way. Which in our terms means, because they were anarchists.\nInsofar as fragments of an anarchist anthropology do, already, exist, they\nlargely derive from him.\n\nBefore Mauss, the universal assumption had been that economies without money\nor markets had operated by means of “barter”; they were trying to engage in\nmarket behavior (acquire useful goods and services at the least cost to\nthemselves, get rich if possible...), they just hadn’t yet developed very\nsophisticated ways of going about it. Mauss demonstrated that in fact, such\neconomies were really “gift economies.” They were not based on calculation,\nbut on a refusal to calculate; they were rooted in an ethical system which\nconsciously rejected most of what we would consider the basic principles of\neconomics. It was not that they had not yet learned to seek profit through the\nmost efficient means. They would have found the very premise that the point of\nan economic transaction—at least, one with someone who was not your enemy—was\nto seek the greatest profit deeply offensive.\n\nIt is significant that the one (of the few) overtly anarchist anthropologists\nof recent memory, another Frenchman, Pierre Clastres, became famous for making\na similar argument on the political level. He insisted political\nanthropologists had still not completely gotten over the old evolutionist\nperspectives that saw the state primarily as a more sophisticated form of\norganization than what had come before; stateless peoples, such as the\nAmazonian societies Clastres studied, were tacitly assumed not to have\nattained the level of say, the Aztecs or the Inca. But what if, he proposed,\nAmazonians were not entirely unaware of what the elementary forms of state\npower might be like—what it would mean to allow some men to give everyone else\norders which could not be questioned, since they were backed up by the threat\nof force—and were for that very reason determined to ensure such things never\ncame about? What if they considered the fundamental premises of our political\nscience morally objectionable?\n\nThe parallels between the two arguments are actually quite striking. In gift\neconomies there are, often, venues for enterprising individuals: But\neverything is arranged in such a way they could never be used as a platform\nfor creating permanent inequalities of wealth, since self-aggrandizing types\nall end up competing to see who can give the most away. In Amazonian (or North\nAmerican) societies, the institution of the chief played the same role on a\npolitical level: the position was so demanding, and so little rewarding, so\nhedged about by safeguards, that there was no way for power-hungry individuals\nto do much with it. Amazonians might not have literally whacked off the\nruler’s head every few years, but it’s not an entirely inappropriate metaphor.\n\nBy these lights these were all, in a very real sense, anarchist societies.\nThey were founded on an explicit rejection of the logic of the state and of\nthe market.\n\nThey are, however, extremely imperfect ones. The most common criticism of\nClastres is to ask how his Amazonians could really be organizing their\nsocieties against the emergence of something they have never actually\nexperienced. A naive question, but it points to something equally naive in\nClastres’ own approach. Clastres manages to talk blithely about the\nuncompromised egalitarianism of the very same Amazonian societies, for\ninstance, famous for their use of gang rape as a weapon to terrorize women who\ntransgress proper gender roles. It’s a blind spot so glaring one has to wonder\nhow he could possibly miss out on it; especially considering it provides an\nanswer to just that question. Perhaps Amazonian men understand what arbitrary,\nunquestionable power, backed by force, would be like because they themselves\nwield that sort of power over their wives and daughters. Perhaps for that very\nreason they would not like to see structures capable of inflicting it on them.\n\nIt’s worth pointing out because Clastres is, in many ways, a naive romantic.\nFom another perspective, though, there’s no mystery here at all. After all, we\nare talking about the fact that most Amazonians don’t want to give others the\npower to threaten them with physical injury if they don’t do as they are told.\nMaybe we should better be asking what it says about ourselves that we feel\nthis attitude needs any sort of explanation.\n\n\n#### toward a theory of imaginary counterpower\n\nThis is what I mean by an alternative ethics, then. Anarchistic societies are\nno more unaware of human capacities for greed or vainglory than modern\nAmericans are unaware of human capacities for envy, gluttony, or sloth; they\nwould just find them equally unappealing as the basis for their civilization.\nIn fact, they see these phenomena as moral dangers so dire they end up\norganizing much of their social life around containing them.\n\nIf this were a purely theoretical essay I would explain that all this suggests\nan interesting way of synthesizing theories of value and theories of\nresistance. For present purposes, suffice it to say that I think Mauss and\nClastres have succeeded, somewhat despite themselves, in laying the groundwork\nfor a theory of revolutionary counterpower.\n\nI’m afraid this is a somewhat complicated argument. Let me take it one step at\na time.\n\nIn typical revolutionary discourse a “counterpower” is a collection of social\ninstitutions set in opposition to the state and capital: from selfgoverning\ncommunities to radical labor unions to popular militias. Sometimes it is also\nreferred to as an “anti-power.” When such institutions maintain themselves in\nthe face of the state, this is usually referred to as a “dual power”\nsituation. By this definition most of human history is actually characterized\nby dual power situations, since few historical states had the means to root\nsuch institutions out, even assuming that they would have wanted to. But Mauss\nand Clastres’ argument suggests something even more radical. It suggests that\ncounterpower, at least in the most elementary sense, actually exists where the\nstates and markets are not even present; that in such cases, rather than being\nembodied in popular institutions which pose themselves against the power of\nlords, or kings, or plutocrats, they are embodied in institutions which ensure\nsuch types of person never come about. What it is “counter” to, then, is a\npotential, a latent aspect, or dialectical possibility if you prefer, within\nthe society itself.\n\nThis at least would help explain an otherwise peculiar fact; the way in which\nit is often particularly the egalitarian societies which are torn by terrible\ninner tensions, or at least, extreme forms of symbolic violence.\n\nOf course, all societies are to some degree at war with themselves. There are\nalways clashes between interests, factions, classes and the like; also, social\nsystems are always based on the pursuit of different forms of value which pull\npeople in different directions. In egalitarian societies, which tend to place\nan enormous emphasis on creating and maintaining communal consensus, this\noften appears to spark a kind of equally elaborate reaction formation, a\nspectral nightworld inhabited by monsters, witches or other creatures of\nhorror. And it’s the most peaceful societies which are also the most haunted,\nin their imaginative constructions of the cosmos, by constant specters of\nperennial war. The invisible worlds surrounding them are literally\nbattlegrounds. It’s as if the endless labor of achieving consensus masks a\nconstant inner violence— or, it might perhaps be better to say, is in fact the\nprocess by which that inner violence is measured and contained—and it is\nprecisely this, and the resulting tangle of moral contradiction, which is the\nprime font of social creativity. It’s not these conflicting principles and\ncontradictory impulses themselves which are the ultimate political reality,\nthen; it’s the regulatory process which mediates them.\n\nSome examples might help here:\n\nCase 1: The Piaroa, a highly egalitarian society living along tributaries of\nthe Orinoco which ethnographer Joanna Overing herself describes as anarchists.\nThey place enormous value on individual freedom and autonomy, and are quite\nselfconscious about the importance of ensuring that no one is ever at another\nperson’s orders, or the need to ensure no one gains such control over economic\nresources that they can use it to constrain others’ freedom. Yet they also\ninsist that Piaroa culture itself was the creation of an evil god, a two-\nheaded cannibalistic buffoon. The Piaroa have developed a moral philosophy\nwhich defines the human condition as caught between a “world of the senses,”\nof wild, pre-social desires, and a “world of thought.” Growing up involves\nlearning to control and channel in the former through thoughtful consideration\nfor others, and the cultivation of a sense of humor; but this is made\ninfinitely more difficult by the fact that all forms of technical knowledge,\nhowever necessary for life are, due to their origins, laced with elements of\ndestructive madness. Similarly, while the Piaroa are famous for their\npeaceableness—murder is unheard of, the assumption being that anyone who\nkilled another human being would be instantly consumed by pollution and die\nhorribly—they inhabit a cosmos of endless invisible war, in which wizards are\nengaged in fending off the attacks of insane, predatory gods and all deaths\nare caused by spiritual murder and have to be avenged by the magical massacre\nof whole (distant, unknown) communities.\n\nCase 2: The Tiv, another notoriously egalitarian society, make their homes\nalong the Benue River in central Nigeria. Compared to the Piaroa, their\ndomestic life is quite hierarchical: male elders tend to have many wives, and\nexchange with one another the rights to younger women’s fertility; younger men\nare thus reduced to spending most of their lives chilling their heels as\nunmarried dependents in their fathers’ compounds. In recent centuries the Tiv\nwere never entirely insulated from the raids of slave traders; Tivland was\nalso dotted with local markets; minor wars between clans were occasionally\nfought, though more often large disputes were mediated in large communal\n“moots.” Still, there were no political institutions larger than the compound;\nin fact, anything that even began to look like a political institution was\nconsidered intrinsically suspect, or more precisely, seen as surrounded by an\naura of occult horror. This was, as ethnographer Paul Bohannan succinctly put\nit, because of what was seen to be the nature of power: “men attain power by\nconsuming the substance of others.” Markets were protected, and market rules\nenforced by charms which embodied diseases and were said to be powered by\nhuman body parts and blood. Enterprising men who managed to patch together\nsome sort of fame, wealth, or clientele were by definition witches. Their\nhearts were coated by a substance called _tsav,_ which could only be augmented\nby the eating of human flesh. Most tried to avoid doing so, but a secret\nsociety of witches was said to exist which would slip bits of human flesh in\ntheir victims’ food, thus incurring a “flesh debt” and unnatural cravings that\nwould eventually drive those affected to consume their entire families. This\nimaginary society of witches was seen as the invisible government of the\ncountry. Power was thus institutionalized evil, and every generation, a witch-\nfinding movement would arise to expose the culprits, thus, effectively,\ndestroying any emerging structures of authority.\n\nCase 3: Highland Madagascar, where I lived between 1989 and 1991, was a rather\ndifferent place. The area had been the center of a Malagasy state— the Merina\nkingdom—since the early nineteenth century, and afterwards endured many years\nof harsh colonial rule. There was a market economy and, in theory, a central\ngovernment—during the time I was there, largely dominated by what was called\nthe “Merina bourgeoisie.” In fact this government had effectively withdrawn\nfrom most of the countryside and rural communities were effectively governing\nthemselves. In many ways these could also be considered anarchistic: most\nlocal decisions were made by consensus by informal bodies, leadership was\nlooked on at best with suspicion, it was considered wrong for adults to be\ngiving one another orders, especially on an ongoing basis; this was considered\nto make even institutions like wage labor inherently morally suspect. Or to be\nmore precise, unmalagasy—this was how the French behaved, or wicked kings and\nslaveholders long ago. Society was overall remarkably peaceable. Yet once\nagain it was surrounded by invisible warfare; just about everyone had access\nto dangerous medicine or spirits or was willing to let on they might; the\nnight was haunted by witches who danced naked on tombs and rode men like\nhorses; just about all sickness was due to envy, hatred, and magical attack.\nWhat’s more, witchcraft bore a strange, ambivalent relation to national\nidentity. While people made rhetorical reference to Malagasy as equal and\nunited “like hairs on a head,” ideals of economic equality were rarely, if\never, invoked; however, it was assumed that anyone who became too rich or\npowerful would be destroyed by witchcraft, and while witchcraft was the\ndefinition of evil, it was also seen as peculiarly Malagasy (charms were just\ncharms but evil charms were called “Malagasy charms”). Insofar as rituals of\nmoral solidarity did occur, and the ideal of equality was invoked, it was\nlargely in the course of rituals held to suppress, expel, or destroy those\nwitches who, perversely, were the twisted embodiment and practical enforcement\nof the egalitarian ethos of the society itself.\n\nNote how in each case there’s a striking contrast between the cosmological\ncontent, which is nothing if not tumultuous, and social process, which is all\nabout mediation, arriving at consensus. None of these societies are entirely\negalitarian: there are always certain key forms of dominance, at least of men\nover women, elders over juniors. The nature and intensity of these forms vary\nenormously: in Piaroa communities the hierarchies were so modest that Overing\ndoubts one can really speak of “male dominance” at all (despite the fact that\ncommunal leaders are invariably male); the Tiv appear to be quite another\nstory. Still, structural inequalities invariably exist, and as a result I\nthink it is fair to say that these anarchies are not only imperfect, they\ncontain with them the seeds of their own destruction. It is hardly a\ncoincidence that when larger, more systematically violent forms of domination\ndo emerge, they draw on precisely these idioms of age and gender to justify\nthemselves.\n\nStill, I think it would be a mistake to see the invisible violence and terror\nas simply a working out of the “internal contradictions” created by those\nforms of inequality. One could, perhaps, make the case that most real,\ntangible violence is. At least, it is a somewhat notorious thing that, in\nsocieties where the only notable inequalities are based in gender, the only\nmurders one is likely to observe are men killing each other over women.\nSimilarly, it does seem to be the case, generally speaking, that the more\npronounced the differences between male and female roles in a society, the\nmore physically violent it tends to be. But this hardly means that if all\ninequalities vanished, then everything, even the imagination, would become\nplacid and untroubled. To some degree, I suspect all this turbulence stems\nfrom the very nature of the human condition. There would appear to be no\nsociety which does not see human life as fundamentally a problem. However much\nthey might differ on what they deem the problem to be, at the very least, the\nexistence of work, sex, and reproduction are seen as fraught with all sorts of\nquandaries; human desires are always fickle; and then there’s the fact that\nwe’re all going to die. So there’s a lot to be troubled by. None of these\ndilemmas are going to vanish if we eliminate structural inequalities (much\nthough I think this would radically improve things in just about every other\nway). Indeed, the fantasy that it might, that the human condition, desire,\nmortality, can all be somehow resolved seems to be an especially dangerous\none, an image of utopia which always seems to lurk somewhere behind the\npretentions of Power and the state. Instead, as I’ve suggested, the spectral\nviolence seems to emerge from the very tensions inherent in the project of\nmaintaining an egalitarian society. Otherwise, one would at least imagine the\nTiv imagination would be more tumultuous than the Piaroa.\n\nThat the state emerged from images of an impossible resolution of the human\ncondition was Clastres’ point as well. He argued that historically, the\ninstitution of the state could not have possibly emerged from the political\ninstitutions of anarchist societies, which were designed to ensure this never\nhappened. Instead, it could only have been from religious institutions: he\npointed to the Tupinamba prophets who led the whole population on a vast\nmigration in search of a “land without evil.” Of course, in later contexts,\nwhat Peter Lamborn Wilson calls “the Clastrian machine,” that set of\nmechanisms which oppose the emergence of domination, what I’m calling the\napparatus of counterpower, can itself become caught in such apocalyptic\nfantasies.\n\nNow, at this point the reader may be objecting, “Sure, but what does any of\nthis have to do with the kind of insurrectionary communities which\nrevolutionary theorists are normally referring to when they use the word\n‘counterpower’?”\n\nHere it might be useful to look at the difference between the first two cases\nand the third— because the Malagasy communities I knew in 1990 were living in\nsomething which in many ways resembled an insurrectionary situation. Between\nthe nineteenth century and the twentieth, there had been a remarkable\ntransformation of popular attitudes. Just about all reports from the last\ncentury insisted that, despite widespread resentment against the corrupt and\noften brutal Malagasy government, no one questioned the legitimacy of the\nmonarchy itself, or particularly, their absolute personal loyalty to the\nQueen. Neither would anyone explicitly question the legitimacy of slavery.\nAfter the French conquest of the island in 1895, followed immediately by the\nabolition of both the monarchy and slavery, all this seems to have changed\nextremely quickly. Before a generation was out, one began to encounter the\nattitude that I found to be well-nigh universal in the countryside a hundred\nyears later: slavery was evil, and monarchs were seen as inherently immoral\nbecause they treated others like slaves. In the end, all relations of command\n(military service, wage labor, forced labor) came to be fused together in\npeople’s minds as variations on slavery; the very institutions which had\npreviously been seen as beyond challenge were now the definition of\nillegitimacy, and this, especially among those who had the least access to\nhigher education and French Enlightenment ideas. Being “Malagasy” came to be\ndefined as rejecting such foreign ways. If one combines this attitude with\nconstant passive resistance to state institutions, and the elaboration of\nautonomous, and relatively egalitarian modes of self-government, one could see\nwhat happened as a revolution. After the financial crisis of the ‘80s, the\nstate in much of the country effectively collapsed, or anyway devolved into a\nmatter of hollow form without the backing of systematic coercion. Rural people\ncarried on much as they had before, going to offices periodically to fill out\nforms even though they were no longer paying any real taxes, the government\nwas hardly providing services, and in the event of theft or even murder,\npolice would no longer come. If a revolution is a matter of people resisting\nsome form of power identified as oppressive, identifying some key aspect of\nthat power as the source of what is fundamentally objectionable about it, and\nthen trying to get rid of one’s oppressors in such a way as to try to\neliminate that sort of power completely from daily life, then it is hard to\ndeny that, in some sense, this was indeed a revolution. It might not have\ninvolved an actual uprising, but it was a revolution nonetheless.\n\nHow long it would last is another question; it was a very fragile, tenuous\nsort of freedom. Many such enclaves have collapsed—in Madagascar as elsewhere.\nOthers endure; new ones are being created all the time. The contemporary world\nis riddled with such anarchic spaces, and the more successful they are, the\nless likely we are to hear about them. It’s only if such a space breaks down\ninto violence that there’s any chance outsiders will even find out that it\nexists.\n\nThe puzzling question is how such profound changes in popular attitudes could\nhappen so fast? The likely answer is that they really didn’t; there were\nprobably things going on even under the nineteenthcentury kingdom of which\nforeign observers (even those long resident on the island) were simply\nunaware. But clearly, too, something about the imposition of colonial rule\nallowed for a rapid reshuffling of priorities. This, I would argue, is what\nthe ongoing existence of deeply embedded forms of counterpower allows. A lot\nof the ideological work, in fact, of making a revolution was conducted\nprecisely in the spectral nightworld of sorcerers and witches; in\nredefinitions of the moral implications of different forms of magical power.\nBut this only underlines how these spectral zones are always the fulcrum of\nthe moral imagination, a kind of creative reservoir, too, of potential\nrevolutionary change. It’s precisely from these invisible spaces—invisible,\nmost of all, to power—whence the potential for insurrection, and the\nextraordinary social creativity that seems to emerge out of nowhere in\nrevolutionary moments, actually comes.\n\nTo sum up the argument so far, then:\n\n1) Counterpower is first and foremost rooted in the imagination; it emerges\nfrom the fact that all social systems are a tangle of contradictions, always\nto some degree at war with themselves. Or, more precisely, it is rooted in the\nrelation between the practical imagination required to maintain a society\nbased on consensus (as any society not based on violence must, ultimately,\nbe)—the constant work of imaginative identification with others that makes\nunderstanding possible—and the spectral violence which appears to be its\nconstant, perhaps inevitable corollary.\n\n2) In egalitarian societies, counterpower might be said to be the predominant\nform of social power. It stands guard over what are seen as certain\nfrightening possibilities within the society itself: notably against the\nemergence of systematic forms of political or economic dominance.\n\n2a) Institutionally, counterpower takes the form of what we would call\ninstitutions of direct democracy, consensus and mediation; that is, ways of\npublicly negotiating and controlling that inevitable internal tumult and\ntransforming it into those social states (or if you like, forms of value) that\nsociety sees as the most desirable: conviviality, unanimity, fertility,\nprosperity, beauty, however it may be framed.\n\n3) In highly unequal societies, imaginative counterpower often defines itself\nagainst certain aspects of dominance that are seen as particularly obnoxious\nand can become an attempt to eliminate them from social relations completely.\nWhen it does, it becomes revolutionary.\n\n3a) Institutionally, as an imaginative well, it is responsible for the\ncreation of new social forms, and the revalorization or transformation of old\nones, and also,\n\n4) in moments of radical transformation—revolutions in the old-fashioned\nsense—this is precisely what allows for the notorious popular ability to\ninnovate entirely new politics, economic, and social forms. Hence, it is the\nroot of what Antonio Negri has called “constituent power,” the power to create\nconstitutions.\n\nMost modern constitutional orders see themselves as having been created by\nrebellions: the American revolution, the French revolution, and so on. This\nhas, of course, not always been the case. But this leads to a very important\nquestion, because any really politically engaged anthropology will have to\nstart by seriously confronting the question of what, if anything, really\ndivides what we like to call the “modern” world from the rest of human\nhistory, to which folks like the Piaroa, Tiv or Malagasy are normally\nrelegated. This is as one might imagine a pretty vexed question but I am\nafraid it can’t be avoided, since otherwise, many readers might not be\nconvinced there’s any reason to have an anarchist anthropology to begin with.\n\n\n### Blowing Up Walls\n\nAs I remarked, an anarchist anthropology doesn’t really exist. There are only\nfragments. In the first part of this essay I tried to gather some of them, and\nto look for common themes; in this part I want to go further, and imagine a\nbody of social theory that might exist at some time in the future.\n\n\n#### obvious objections\n\nBefore being able to do so I really do need to address the usual objection to\nany project of this nature: that the study of actually-existing anarchist\nsocieties is simply irrelevant to the modern world. After all, aren’t we just\ntalking about a bunch of primitives?\n\nFor anarchists who do know something about anthropology, the arguments are all\ntoo familiar. A typical exchange goes something like this:\n\nSkeptic: Well, I might take this whole anarchism idea more seriously if you\ncould give me some reason to think it would work. Can you name me a single\nviable example of a society which has existed without a government?\n\nAnarchist: Sure. There have been thousands. I could name a dozen just off the\ntop of my head: the Bororo, the Baining, the Onondaga, the Wintu, the Ema, the\nTallensi, the Vezo...\n\nSkeptic: But those are all a bunch of primitives! I’m talking about anarchism\nin a modern, technological society.\n\nAnarchist: Okay, then. There have been all sorts of successful experiments:\nexperiments with worker’s self-management, like Mondragon; economic projects\nbased on the idea of the gift economy, like Linux; all sorts of political\norganizations based on consensus and direct democracy...\n\nSkeptic: Sure, sure, but these are small, isolated examples. I’m talking about\nwhole societies.\n\nAnarchist: Well, it’s not like people haven’t tried. Look at the Paris\nCommune, the revolution in Republican Spain...\n\nSkeptic: Yeah, and look what happened to those guys! They all got killed!\n\nThe dice are loaded. You can’t win. Because when the skeptic says “society,”\nwhat he really means is “state,” even “nation-state.” Since no one is going to\nproduce an example of an anarchist state—that would be a contradiction in\nterms—what we’re really being asked for is an example of a modern nation-state\nwith the government somehow plucked away: a situation in which the government\nof Canada, to take a random example, has been overthrown, or for some reason\nabolished itself, and no new one has taken its place but instead all former\nCanadian citizens begin to organize themselves into libertarian collectives.\nObviously this would never be allowed to happen. In the past, whenever it even\nlooked like it might—here, the Paris commune and Spanish civil war are\nexcellent examples—the politicians running pretty much every state in the\nvicinity have been willing to put their differences on hold until those trying\nto bring such a situation about had been rounded up and shot.\n\nThere is a way out, which is to accept that anarchist forms of organization\nwould not look anything like a state. That they would involve an endless\nvariety of communities, associations, networks, projects, on every conceivable\nscale, overlapping and intersecting in any way we could imagine, and possibly\nmany that we can’t. Some would be quite local, others global. Perhaps all they\nwould have in common is that none would involve anyone showing up with weapons\nand telling everyone else to shut up and do what they were told. And that,\nsince anarchists are not actually trying to seize power within any national\nterritory, the process of one system replacing the other will not take the\nform of some sudden revolutionary cataclysm—the storming of a Bastille, the\nseizing of a Winter Palace—but will necessarily be gradual, the creation of\nalternative forms of organization on a world scale, new forms of\ncommunication, new, less alienated ways of organizing life, which will,\neventually, make currently existing forms of power seem stupid and beside the\npoint. That in turn would mean that there are endless examples of viable\nanarchism: pretty much any form of organization would count as one, so long as\nit was not imposed by some higher authority, from a klezmer band to the\ninternational postal service.\n\nUnfortunately, this kind of argument does not seem to satisfy most skeptics.\nThey want “societies.” So one is reduced to scouring the historical and\nethnographic record for entities that look like a nation-state (one people,\nspeaking a common language, living within a bounded territory, acknowledging a\ncommon set of legal principles...), but which lack a state apparatus (which,\nfollowing Weber, one can define roughly as: a group of people who claim that,\nat least when they are around and in their official capacity, they are the\nonly ones with the right to act violently). These, too, one can find, if one\nis willing to look at relatively small communities far away in time or space.\nBut then one is told they don’t count for just this reason.\n\nSo we’re back to the original problem. There is assumed to be an absolute\nrupture between the world we live in, and the world inhabited by anyone who\nmight be characterized as “primitive,” “tribal,” or even as “peasants.”\nAnthropologists are not to blame here: we have been trying for decades now to\nconvince the public that there’s no such thing as a “primitive,” that “simple\nsocieties” are not really all that simple, that no one ever existed in\ntimeless isolation, that it makes no sense to speak of some social systems as\nmore or less evolved; but so far, we’ve made very little headway. It is almost\nimpossible to convince the average American that a bunch of Amazonians could\npossibly have anything to teach them—other than, conceivably, that we should\nall abandon modern civilization and go live in Amazonia—and this because they\nare assumed to live in an absolutely different world. Which is, oddly enough,\nagain because of the way we are used to thinking about revolutions.\n\nLet me take up the argument I began to sketch out in the last section and try\nto explain why I think this is true:\n\n\n#### a fairly brief manifesto concerning the concept of revolution:\n\nThe term “revolution” has been so relentlessly cheapened in common usage that\nit can mean almost anything. We have revolutions every week now: banking\nrevolutions, cybernetic revolutions, medical revolutions, an internet\nrevolution every time someone invents some clever new piece of software.\n\nThis kind of rhetoric is only possible because the commonplace definition of\nrevolution has always implied something in the nature of a paradigm shift: a\nclear break, a fundamental rupture in the nature of social reality after which\neverything works differently, and previous categories no longer apply. It is\nthis which makes it possible to, say, claim that the modern world is derived\nfrom two “revolutions”: the French revolution and the Industrial revolution,\ndespite the fact that the two had almost nothing else in common other than\nseeming to mark a break with all that came before. One odd result is that, as\nEllen Meskins Wood has noted, we are in the habit of discussing what we call\n“modernity” as if it involved a combination of English laissez faire\neconomics, and French Republican government, despite the fact that the two\nnever really occurred together: the industrial revolution happened under a\nbizarre, antiquated, still largely medieval English constitution, and\nnineteenth-century France was anything but laissez faire.\n\n(The one-time appeal of the Russian revolution for the “developing world”\nseems to derive from the fact it’s the one example where both sorts of\nrevolution did seem to coincide: a seizure of national power which then led to\nrapid industrialization. As a result almost every twentieth-century government\nin the global south determined to play economic catch-up with the industrial\npowers had also to claim to be a revolutionary regime.)\n\nIf there is one logical error underlying all this, it rests on imagining that\nsocial or even technological change takes the same form of what Thomas Kuhn\nhas called “the structure of scientific revolutions.” Kuhn is referring to\nevents like the shift from a Newtonian to Einsteinian universe: suddenly there\nis an intellectual breakthrough and afterwards, the universe is different.\nApplied to anything other than scientific revolutions, it implies that the\nworld really was equivalent to our knowledge of it, and the moment we change\nthe principles on which our knowledge is based, reality changes too. This is\njust the sort of basic intellectual mistake developmental psychologists say\nwe’re supposed to get over in early childhood, but it seems few of us really\ndo.\n\nIn fact, the world is under no obligation to live up to our expectations, and\ninsofar as “reality” refers to anything, it refers to precisely that which can\nnever be entirely encompassed by our imaginative constructions. Totalities, in\nparticular, are always creatures of the imagination. Nations, societies,\nideologies, closed systems... none of these really exist. Reality is always\ninfinitely messier than that—even if the belief that they exist is an\nundeniable social force. For one thing, the habit of thought which defines the\nworld, or society, as a totalizing system (in which every element takes on its\nsignificance only in relation to the others) tends to lead almost inevitably\nto a view of revolutions as cataclysmic ruptures. Since, after all, how else\ncould one totalizing system be replaced by a completely different one than by\na cataclysmic rupture? Human history thus becomes a series of revolutions: the\nNeolithic revolution, the Industrial revolution, the Information revolution,\netc., and the political dream becomes to somehow take control of the process;\nto get to the point where we can cause a rupture of this sort, a momentous\nbreakthrough that will not just happen but result directly from some kind of\ncollective will. “The revolution,” properly speaking.\n\nIf so it’s not surprising that the moment radical thinkers felt they had to\ngive up this dream, their first reaction was to redouble their efforts to\nidentify revolutions happening anyway, to the point where in the eyes of\nsomeone like Paul Virilio, rupture is our permanent state of being, or for\nsomeone like Jean Baudrillard, the world now changes completely every couple\nyears, whenever he gets a new idea.\n\nThis is not an appeal for a flat-out rejection of such imaginary\ntotalities—even assuming this were possible, which it probably isn’t, since\nthey are probably a necessary tool of human thought. It is an appeal to always\nbear in mind that they are just that: tools of thought. For instance, it is\nindeed a very good thing to be able to ask “after the revolution, how will we\norganize mass transportation?,” “who will fund scientific research?,” or even,\n“after the revolution, do you think there will still be fashion magazines?”\nThe phrase is a useful mental hinge; even if we also recognize that in\nreality, unless we are willing to massacre thousands of people (and probably\neven then), the revolution will almost certainly not be quite such a clean\nbreak as such a phrase implies.\n\nWhat will it be, then? I have already made some suggestions. A revolution on a\nworld scale will take a very long time. But it is also possible to recognize\nthat it is already starting to happen. The easiest way to get our minds around\nit is to stop thinking about revolution as a thing—“the” revolution, the great\ncataclysmic break—and instead ask “what is revolutionary action?” We could\nthen suggest: revolutionary action is any collective action which rejects, and\ntherefore confronts, some form of power or domination and in doing so,\nreconstitutes social relations—even within the collectivity—in that light.\nRevolutionary action does not necessarily have to aim to topple governments.\nAttempts to create autonomous communities in the face of power (using\nCastoriadis’ definition here: ones that constitute themselves, collectively\nmake their own rules or principles of operation, and continually reexamine\nthem), would, for instance, be almost by definition revolutionary acts. And\nhistory shows us that the continual accumulation of such acts can change\n(almost) everything.\n\nI’m hardly the first to have made an argument like this—some such vision\nfollows almost necessarily once one is no longer thinking in terms of the\nframework of the state and seizure of state power. What I want to emphasize\nhere is what this means for how we look at history.\n\n\n#### a thought experiment, or, blowing up walls\n\nWhat I am proposing, essentially, is that we engage in a kind of thought\nexperiment. What if, as a recent title put it, “we have never been modern”?\nWhat if there never was any fundamental break, and therefore, we are not\nliving in a fundamentally different moral, social, or political universe than\nthe Piaroa or Tiv or rural Malagasy?\n\nThere are a million different ways to define “modernity.” According to some it\nmainly has to do with science and technology, for others it’s a matter of\nindividualism; others, capitalism, or bureaucratic rationality, or alienation,\nor an ideal of freedom of one sort or another. However they define it, almost\neveryone agrees that at somewhere in the sixteenth, or seventeenth, or\neighteenth centuries, a Great Transformation occurred, that it occurred in\nWestern Europe and its settler colonies, and that because of it, we became\n“modern.” And that once we did, we became a fundamentally different sort of\ncreature than anything that had come before.\n\nBut what if we kicked this whole apparatus away? What if we blew up the wall?\nWhat if we accepted that the people who Columbus or Vasco da Gama “discovered”\non their expeditions were just us? Or certainly, just as much “us” as Columbus\nand Vasco da Gama ever were?\n\nI’m not arguing that nothing important has changed over the last five hundred\nyears, any more than I’m arguing that cultural differences are unimportant. In\none sense everyone, every community, every individual for that matter, lives\nin their own unique universe. By “blowing up walls,” I mean most of all,\nblowing up the arrogant, unreflecting assumptions which tell us we have\nnothing in common with 98% of people who ever lived, so we don’t really have\nto think about them. Since, after all, if you assume the fundamental break,\nthe only theoretical question you can ask is some variation on “what makes us\nso special?” Once we get rid of those assumptions, decide to at least\nentertain the notion we aren’t quite so special as we might like to think, we\ncan also begin to think about what really has changed and what hasn’t.\n\nAn example:\n\nThere has long been a related debate over what particular advantage “the\nWest,” as Western Europe and its settler colonies have liked to call\nthemselves, had over the rest of the world that allowed them to conquer so\nmuch of it in the four hundred years between 1500 and 1900. Was it a more\nefficient economic system? A superior military tradition? Did it have to do\nwith Christianity, or Protestantism, or a spirit of rationalistic inquiry? Was\nit simply a matter of technology? Or did it have to do with more\nindividualistic family arrangements? Some combination of all these factors? To\na large extent, Western historical sociology has been dedicated to solving\nthis problem. It is a sign of how deeply embedded the assumptions are that it\nis only quite recently that scholars have come to even suggest that perhaps,\nWestern Europe didn’t really have any fundamental advantage at all. That\nEuropean technology, economic and social arrangements, state organization, and\nthe rest in 1450 were in no way more “advanced” than what prevailed in Egypt,\nor Bengal, or Fujian, or most any other urbanized part of the Old World at the\ntime. Europe might have been ahead in some areas (e.g., techniques of naval\nwarfare, certain forms of banking), but lagged significantly behind in others\n(astronomy, jurisprudence, agricultural technology, techniques of land\nwarfare). Perhaps there was no mysterious advantage. Perhaps what happened was\njust a coincidence. Western Europe happened to be located in that part of the\nOld World where it was easiest to sail to the New; those who first did so had\nthe incredible luck to discover lands full of enormous wealth, populated by\ndefenseless stone-age peoples who conveniently began dying almost the moment\nthey arrived; the resultant windfall, and the demographic advantage from\nhaving lands to siphon off excess population was more than enough to account\nfor the European powers’ later successes. It was then possible to shut down\nthe (far more efficient) Indian cloth industry and create the space for an\nindustrial revolution, and generally ravage and dominate Asia to such an\nextent that in technological terms—particularly industrial and military\ntechnology—it fell increasingly behind.\n\nA number of authors (Blaut, Goody, Pommeranz, Gunder Frank) have been making\nsome variation of this argument in recent years. It is at root a moral\nargument, an attack on Western arrogance. As such it is extremely important.\nThe only problem with it, in moral terms, is that it tends to confuse means\nand inclination. That is, it rests on the assumption that Western historians\nwere right to assume that whatever it was that made it possible for Europeans\nto dispossess, abduct, enslave, and exterminate millions of other human\nbeings, it was a mark of superiority and that therefore, whatever it was, it\nwould be insulting to non-Europeans to suggest they didn’t have it too. It\nseems to me that it is far more insulting to suggest anyone would ever have\nbehaved like Europeans of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries—e.g.,\ndepopulating large portions of the Andes or central Mexico by working millions\nto death in the mines, or kidnapping a significant chunk of the population of\nAfrica to work to death on sugar plantations— unless one has some actual\nevidence to suggest they were so genocidally inclined. In fact there appear to\nhave been plenty of examples of people in a position to wreak similar havoc on\na world scale—say, the Ming dynasty in the fifteenth century—but who didn’t,\nnot so much because they scrupled to, so much as because it would never have\noccurred to them to act this way to begin with.\n\nIn the end it all turns, oddly enough, on how one chooses to define\ncapitalism. Almost all the authors cited above tend to see capitalism as yet\nanother accomplishment which Westerners arrogantly assume they invented\nthemselves, and therefore define it (as capitalists do) as largely a matter of\ncommerce and financial instruments. But that willingness to put considerations\nof profit above any human concern which drove Europeans to depopulate whole\nregions of the world in order to place the maximum amount of silver or sugar\non the market was certainly something else. It seems to me it deserves a name\nof its own. For this reason it seems better to me to continue to define\ncapitalism as its opponents prefer, as founded on the connection between a\nwage system and a principle of the never-ending pursuit of profit for its own\nsake. This in turn makes it possible to argue this was a strange perversion of\nnormal commercial logic which happened to take hold in one, previously rather\nbarbarous, corner of the world and encouraged the inhabitants to engage in\nwhat might otherwise have been considered unspeakable forms of behavior.\nAgain, all this does not necessarily mean that one has to agree with the\npremise that once capitalism came into existence, it instantly became a\ntotalizing system and that from that moment, everything else that happened can\nonly be understood in relation to it. But it suggests one of the axes on which\none can begin to think about what really is different nowadays.\n\nLet us imagine, then, that the West, however defined, was nothing special, and\nfurther, that there has been no one fundamental break in human history. No one\ncan deny there have been massive quantitative changes: the amount of energy\nconsumed, the speed at which humans can travel, the number of books produced\nand read, all these numbers have been rising exponentially. But let us imagine\nfor the sake of argument that these quantitative changes do not, in\nthemselves, necessarily imply a change in quality: we are not living in a\nfundamentally different sort of society than has ever existed before, we are\nnot living in a fundamentally different sort of time, the existence of\nfactories or microchips do not mean political or social possibilities have\nchanged in their basic nature: Or, to be more precise, the West might have\nintroduced some new possibilities, but it hasn’t canceled any of the old ones\nout.\n\nThe first thing one discovers when one tries to think this way is that it is\nextremely difficult to do so. One has to cut past the endless host of\nintellectual tricks and gimmicks that create the wall of distance around\n“modern” societies. Let me give just one example. It is common to distinguish\nbetween what are called “kinship-based societies” and modern ones, which are\nsupposed to be based on impersonal institutions like the market or the state.\nThe societies traditionally studied by anthropologists have kinship systems.\nThey are organized into descent groups— lineages, or clans, or moieties, or\nramages—which trace descent to common ancestors, live mainly on ancestral\nterritories, are seen as consisting of similar “kinds” of people—an idea\nusually expressed through physical idioms of common flesh, or bone, or blood,\nor skin. Often kinship systems become a basis of social inequality as some\ngroups are seen as higher than others, as for example in caste systems;\nalways, kinship establishes the terms for sex and marriage and the passing of\nproperty over the generations.\n\nThe term “kin-based” is often used the way people used to use the word\n“primitive”; these are exotic societies which are in no way like our own.\n(That’s why it is assumed we need anthropology to study them; entirely\ndifferent disciplines, like sociology and economics, are assumed to be\nrequired to study modern ones.) But then the exact same people who make this\nargument will usually take it for granted that the main social problems in our\nown, “modern” society (or “postmodern”: for present purposes it’s exactly the\nsame thing) revolve around race, class, and gender. In other words, precisely\nfrom the nature of our kinship system.\n\nAfter all, what does it mean to say most Americans see the world as divided\ninto “races”? It means they believe that it is divided into groups which are\npresumed to share a common descent and geographical origin, who for this\nreason are seen as different “kinds” of people, that this idea is usually\nexpressed through physical idioms of blood and skin, and that the resulting\nsystem regulates sex, marriage, and the inheritance of property and therefore\ncreates and maintains social inequalities. We are talking about something very\nmuch like a classic clan system, except on a global scale. One might object\nthat there is a lot of interracial marriage going on, and even more\ninterracial sex, but then, this is only what we should expect. Statistical\nstudies always reveal that, even in “traditional” societies like the\nNambikwara or Arapesh, at least 5–10% of young people marry someone they’re\nnot supposed to. Statistically, the phenomena are of about equal significance.\nSocial class is slightly more complicated, since the groups are less clearly\nbounded. Still, the difference between a ruling class and a collection of\npeople who happen to have done well is, precisely, kinship: the ability to\nmarry one’s children off appropriately, and pass one’s advantages on to one’s\ndescendants. People marry across class lines too, but rarely very far; and\nwhile most Americans seem to be under the impression that this is a country of\nconsiderable class mobility, when asked to adduce examples all they can\nusually come up with is a handful of rags to riches stories. It is almost\nimpossible to find an example of an American who was born rich and ended up a\npenniless ward of the state. So all we are really dealing with then is the\nfact, familiar to anyone who’s studied history, that ruling elites (unless\npolygamous) are never able to reproduce themselves demographically, and\ntherefore always need some way to recruit new blood (and if they are\npolygamous, of course, that itself becomes a mode of social mobility).\n\nGender relations are of course the very fabric of kinship.\n\n\n#### what would it take to knock down these walls?\n\nI’d say a lot. Too many people have too much invested in maintaining them.\nThis includes anarchists, incidentally. At least in the United States, the\nanarchists who do take anthropology the most seriously are the Primitivists, a\nsmall but very vocal faction who argue that the only way to get humanity back\non track is to shuck off modernity entirely. Inspired by Marshall Sahlins’\nessay “The Original Affluent Society,” they propose that there was a time when\nalienation and inequality did not exist, when everyone was a huntergathering\nanarchist, and that therefore real liberation can only come if we abandon\n“civilization” and return to the Upper Paleolithic, or at least the early Iron\nAge. In fact we know almost nothing about life in the Paleolithic, other than\nthe sort of thing that can be gleaned from studying very old skulls (i.e., in\nthe Paleolithic people had much better teeth; they also died much more\nfrequently from traumatic head wounds). But what we see in the more recent\nethnographic record is endless variety. There were huntergatherer societies\nwith nobles and slaves, there are agrarian societies that are fiercely\negalitarian. Even in Clastres’ favored stomping grounds in Amazonia, one finds\nsome groups who can justly be described as anarchists, like the Piaroa, living\nalongside others (say, the warlike Sherente) who are clearly anything but. And\n“societies” are constantly reforming, skipping back and forth between what we\nthink of as different evolutionary stages.\n\nI do not think we’re losing much if we admit that humans never really lived in\nthe garden of Eden. Knocking the walls down can allow us to see this history\nas a resource to us in much more interesting ways. Because it works both ways.\nNot only do we, in industrial societies, still have kinship (and cosmologies);\nother societies have social movements and revolutions. Which means, among\nother things, that radical theorists no longer have to pore endlessly over the\nsame scant two hundred years of revolutionary history.\n\nBetween the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries the west coast of Madagascar\nwas divided into a series of related kingdoms under the Maroansetra dynasty.\nTheir subjects were collectively known as the Sakalava. In northwest\nMadagascar there is now an “ethnic group” ensconced in a somewhat difficult,\nhilly back country referred to as the Tsimihety. The word literally means\n“those who do not cut their hair.” This refers to a Sakalava custom: when a\nking died, his male subjects were all expected to crop off their hair as a\nsign of mourning. The Tsimihety were those who refused, and hence rejected the\nauthority of the Sakalava monarchy; to this day they are marked by resolutely\negalitarian social organization and practices. They are, in other words, the\nanarchists of northwest Madagascar. To this day they have maintained a\nreputation as masters of evasion: under the French, administrators would\ncomplain that they could send delegations to arrange for labor to build a road\nnear a Tsimihety village, negotiate the terms with apparently cooperative\nelders, and return with the equipment a week later only to discover the\nvillage entirely abandoned—every single inhabitant had moved in with some\nrelative in another part of the country.\n\nWhat especially interests me here is the principle of “ethnogenesis,” as it’s\ncalled nowadays. The Tsimihety are now considered a _foko—a_ people or ethnic\ngroup— but their identity emerged as a political project. The desire to live\nfree of Sakalava domination was translated into a desire—one which came to\nsuffuse all social institutions from village assemblies to mortuary ritual—to\nlive in a society free of markers of hierarchy. This then became\ninstitutionalized as a way of life of a community living together, which then\nin turn came to be thought of as a particular “kind” of people, an ethnic\ngroup—people who also, since they tend to intermarry, come to be seen as\nunited by common ancestry. It is easier to see this happening in Madagascar\nwhere everyone pretty much speaks the same language. But I doubt it is that\nunusual. The ethnogenesis literature is a fairly new one, but it is becoming\nincreasingly clear that most of human history was characterized by continual\nsocial change. Rather than timeless groups living for thousands of years in\ntheir ancestral territories, new groups were being created, and old ones\ndissolving, all the time. Many of what we have come to think of as tribes, or\nnations, or ethnic groups were originally collective projects of some sort. In\nthe Tsimihety case we are talking about a revolutionary project, at least\nrevolutionary in that sense I have been developing here: a conscious rejection\nof certain forms of overarching political power which also causes people to\nrethink and reorganize the way they deal with one another on an everyday\nbasis. Most are not. Some are egalitarian, others are about promoting a\ncertain vision of authority or hierarchy. Still, one is dealing with something\nvery much along the lines of what we’d think of as a social movement; it is\njust that, in the absence of broadsides, rallies and manifestos, the media\nthrough which one can create and demand new forms of (what we’d call) social,\neconomic or political life, to pursue different forms of value, were\ndifferent: one had to work through literally or figuratively sculpting flesh,\nthrough music and ritual, food and clothing, and ways of disposing of the\ndead. But in part as a result, over time, what were once projects become\nidentities, even ones continuous with nature. They ossify and harden into\nself-evident truths or collective properties.\n\nA whole discipline could no doubt be invented to understand precisely how this\nhappens: a process in only some ways analogous to Weber’s “routinization of\ncharisma,” full of strategies, reversals, diversions of energy... Social\nfields which are, in their essence, arenas for the recognition of certain\nforms of value can become borders to be defended; representations or media of\nvalue become numinous powers in themselves; creation slips into commemoration;\nthe ossified remains of liberatory movements can end up, under the grip of\nstates, transformed into what we call “nationalisms” which are either\nmobilized to rally support for the state machinery or become the basis for new\nsocial movements opposed to them.\n\nThe critical thing here, it seems to me, is that this petrification does not\nonly apply to social projects. It can also happen to the states themselves.\nThis is a phenomenon theorists of social struggle have rarely fully\nappreciated.\n\nWhen the French colonial administration established itself in Madagascar it\nduly began dividing the population up into a series of “tribes”: Merina,\nBetsileo, Bara, Sakalava, Vezo, Tsimihety, etc. Since there are few clear\ndistinctions of language, it is easier here, than in most places, to discern\nsome of the principles by which these divisions came about. Some are\npolitical. The Sakalava are noted subjects of the Maroantsetra dynasty (which\ncreated at least three kingdoms along the West coast). The Tsimihety are those\nwho refused allegiance. Those called the “Merina” are those highland people\noriginally united by allegiance to a king named Andrianampoinimerina; subjects\nof other highland kingdoms to the south, who the Merina conquered almost\nimmediately thereafter, are referred to collectively as Betsileo.\n\nSome names have to do with where people live or how they make a living: the\nTanala are “forest people” on the east coast; on the west coast, the Mikea are\nhunters and foragers and the Vezo, fisherfolk. But even here there are usually\npolitical elements: the Vezo lived alongside the Sakalava monarchies but like\nthe Tsimihety, they managed to remain independent of them because, as legend\nhas it, whenever they learned royal representatives were on the way to visit\nthem, they would all get in their canoes and wait offshore until they went\naway. Those fishing villages that did succumb became Sakalava, not Vezo.\n\nThe Merina, Sakalava, and Betsileo are by far the most numerous however. So\nmost Malagasy, then, are defined, not exactly by their political loyalties,\nbut by the loyalties their ancestors had sometime around 1775 or 1800. The\ninteresting thing is what happened to these identities once the kings were no\nlonger around. Here the Merina and Betsileo seem to represent two opposite\npossibilities.\n\nMany of these ancient kingdoms were little more than institutionalized\nextortion systems; insofar as ordinary folk actually participated in royal\npolitics, it was through ritual labor: building royal palaces and tombs, for\nexample, in which each clan was usually assigned some very specific honorific\nrole. Within the Merina kingdom this system ended up being so thoroughly\nabused that by the time the French arrived, it had been almost entirely\ndiscredited and royal rule became, as I mentioned, identified with slavery and\nforced labor; as a result, the “Merina” now mainly exist on paper. One never\nhears anyone in the countryside referring to themselves that way except\nperhaps in essays they have to write in school. The Sakalava are quite another\nstory. Sakalava is still very much a living identity on the West coast, and it\ncontinues to mean, followers of the Maroantsetra dynasty. But for the last\nhundred and fifty years or so, the primary loyalties of most Sakalava have\nbeen to the members of this dynasty who are dead. While living royalty are\nlargely ignored, the ancient kings’ tombs are still continually rebuilt and\nredecorated in vast communal projects and this is what being Sakalava is seen\nlargely to be about. And dead kings still make their wishes known—through\nspirit mediums who are usually elderly women of commoner descent.\n\nIn many other parts of Madagascar as well, it often seems that no one really\ntakes on their full authority until they are dead. So perhaps the Sakalava\ncase is not that extraordinary. But it reveals one very common way of avoiding\nthe direct effects of power: if one cannot simply step out of its path, like\nthe Vezo or Tsimihety, one can, as it were, try to fossilize it. In the\nSakalava case the ossification of the state is quite literal: the kings who\nare still worshipped take the physical form of royal relics, they are\nliterally teeth and bones. But this approach is probably far more commonplace\nthan we would be given to suspect.\n\nKajsia Eckholm for example has recently made the intriguing suggestion that\nthe kind of divine kingship Sir James Frazer wrote about in _The Golden\nBough,_ in which kings were hedged about with endless ritual and taboo (not to\ntouch the earth, not to see the sun...), was not, as we normally assume, an\narchaic form of kingship, but in most cases, a very late one.\n\nShe gives the example of the Kongo monarchy, which when the Portugese first\nshowed up in the late fifteenth century doesn’t seem to have been particularly\nmore ritualized than the monarchy in Portugal or Spain at the same time. There\nwas a certain amount of court ceremonial, but nothing that got in the way of\ngoverning. It was only later, as the kingdom collapsed into civil war and\nbroke into tinier and tinier fragments, that its rulers became increasingly\nsacred beings. Elaborate rituals were created, restrictions multiplied, until\nby the end we read about “kings” who were confined to small buildings, or\nliterally castrated on ascending the throne. As a result they ruled very\nlittle; most BaKongo had in fact passed to a largely self-governing system,\nthough also a very tumultuous one, caught in the throes of the slavetrade.\n\nIs any of this relevant to contemporary concerns? Very much so, it seems to\nme. Autonomist thinkers in Italy have, over the last couple decades, developed\na theory of what they call revolutionary “exodus.” It is inspired in part by\nparticularly Italian conditions—the broad refusal of factory work among young\npeople, the flourishing of squats and occupied “social centers” in so many\nItalian cities... But in all this Italy seems to have acted as a kind of\nlaboratory for future social movements, anticipating trends that are now\nbeginning to happen on a global scale.\n\nThe theory of exodus proposes that the most effective way of opposing\ncapitalism and the liberal state is not through direct confrontation but by\nmeans of what Paolo Virno has called “engaged withdrawal,” mass defection by\nthose wishing to create new forms of community. One need only glance at the\nhistorical record to confirm that most successful forms of popular resistance\nhave taken precisely this form. They have not involved challenging power head\non (this usually leads to being slaughtered, or if not, turning into\nsome—often even uglier—variant of the very thing one first challenged) but\nfrom one or another strategy of slipping away from its grasp, from flight,\ndesertion, the founding of new communities. One Autonomist historian, Yann\nMoulier Boutang, has even argued that the history of capitalism has been a\nseries of attempts to solve the problem of worker mobility—hence the endless\nelaboration of institutions like indenture, slavery, coolie systems, contract\nworkers, guest workers, innumerable forms of border control—since, if the\nsystem ever really came close to its own fantasy version of itself, in which\nworkers were free to hire on and quit their work wherever and whenever they\nwanted, the entire system would collapse. It’s for precisely this reason that\nthe one most consistent demand put forward by the radical elements in the\nglobalization movement—from the Italian Autonomists to North American\nanarchists—has always been global freedom of movement, “real globalization,”\nthe destruction of borders, a general tearing down of walls.\n\nThe kind of tearing down of conceptual walls I’ve been proposing here makes it\npossible for us not only to confirm the importance of defection, it promises\nan infinitely richer conception of how alternative forms of revolutionary\naction might work. This is a history which has largely yet to be written, but\nthere are glimmerings. Peter Lamborn Wilson has produced the brightest of\nthese, in a series of essays which include reflections, on, among other\nthings, the collapse of the Hopewell and Mississippian cultures through much\nof eastern North America. These were societies apparently dominated by\npriestly elites, castebased social structures, and human sacrifice—which\nmysteriously disappeared, being replaced by far more egalitarian\nhunter/gathering or horticultural societies. He suggests, interestingly\nenough, that the famous Native American identification with nature might not\nreally have been a reaction to European values, but to a dialectical\npossibility within their own societies from which they had quite consciously\nrun away. The story continues through the defection of the Jamestown settlers,\na collection of servants abandoned in the first North American colony in\nVirginia by their gentleman patrons, who apparently ended up becoming Indians,\nto an endless series of “pirate utopias,” in which British renegades teamed up\nwith Muslim corsairs, or joined native communities from Hispaniola to\nMadagascar, hidden “triracial” republics founded by escaped slaves at the\nmargins of European settlements, Antinomians, and other little-known\nlibertarian enclaves that riddled the continent even before the Shakers and\nFourierists and all the betterknown nineteenth-century “intentional\ncommunities.”\n\nMost of these little utopias were even more marginal than the Vezo or\nTsimihety were in Madagascar; all of them were eventually gobbled up. Which\nleads to the question of how to neutralize the state apparatus itself, in the\nabsence of a politics of direct confrontation. No doubt some states and\ncorporate elites will collapse of their own dead weight; a few already have;\nbut it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which they all will. Here, the Sakalava\nand BaKongo might be able to provide us some useful suggestions. What cannot\nbe destroyed can, nonetheless, be diverted, frozen, transformed, and gradually\ndeprived of its substance—which in the case of states, is ultimately their\ncapacity to inspire terror. What would this mean under contemporary\nconditions? It’s not entirely clear. Perhaps existing state apparati will\ngradually be reduced to window-dressing as the substance is pulled out of them\nfrom above and below: i.e., both from the growth of international\ninstitutions, and from devolution to local and regional forms of\nselfgovernance. Perhaps government by media spectacle will devolve into\nspectacle pure and simple (somewhat along the lines of what Paul Lafargue,\nMarx’s West Indian son-in-law and author of _The Right to Be Lazy,_ implied\nwhen he suggested that after the revolution, politicians would still be able\nto fulfill a useful social function in the entertainment industry). More\nlikely it will happen in ways we cannot even anticipate. But no doubt there\nare ways in which it is happening already. As Neoliberal states move towards\nnew forms of feudalism, concentrating their guns increasingly around gated\ncommunities, insurrectionary spaces open up that we don’t even know about. The\nMerina rice farmers described in the last section understand what many would-\nbe revolutionaries do not: that there are times when the stupidest thing one\ncould possibly do is raise a red or black flag and issue defiant declarations.\nSometimes the sensible thing is just to pretend nothing has changed, allow\nofficial state representatives to keep their dignity, even show up at their\noffices and fill out a form now and then, but otherwise, ignore them.\n\n\n### Tenets of a Non-existent Science\n\nLet me outline a few of the areas of theory an anarchist anthropology might\nwish to explore:\n\n\n#### 1) A THEORY OF THE STATE\n\nStates have a peculiar dual character. They are at the same time forms of\ninstitutionalized raiding or extortion, and utopian projects. The first\ncertainly reflects the way states are actually experienced, by any communities\nthat retain some degree of autonomy; the second however is how they tend to\nappear in the written record.\n\nIn one sense states are the “imaginary totality” par excellence, and much of\nthe confusion entailed in theories of the state historically lies in an\ninability or unwillingness to recognize this. For the most part, states were\nideas, ways of imagining social order as something one could get a grip on,\nmodels of control. This is why the first known works of social theory, whether\nfrom Persia, or China, or ancient Greece, were always framed as theories of\nstatecraft. This has had two disastrous effects. One is to give utopianism a\nbad name. (The word “utopia” first calls to mind the image of an ideal city,\nusually, with perfect geometry—the image seems to harken back originally to\nthe royal military camp: a geometrical space which is entirely the emanation\nof a single, individual will, a fantasy of total control.) All this has had\ndire political consequences, to say the least. The second is that we tend to\nassume that states, and social order, even societies, largely correspond. In\nother words, we have a tendency to take the most grandiose, even paranoid,\nclaims of world-rulers seriously, assuming that whatever cosmological projects\nthey claimed to be pursuing actually did correspond, at least roughly, to\nsomething on the ground. Whereas it is likely that in many such cases, these\nclaims ordinarily only applied fully within a few dozen yards of the monarch\nin any direction, and most subjects were much more likely to see ruling\nelites, on a day-to-day basis, as something much along the lines of predatory\nraiders.\n\nAn adequate theory of states would then have to begin by distinguishing in\neach case between the relevant ideal of rulership (which can be almost\nanything, a need to enforce military style discipline, the ability to provide\nperfect theatrical representation of gracious living which will inspire\nothers, the need to provide the gods with endless human hearts to fend off the\napocalypse...), and the mechanics of rule, without assuming that there is\nnecessarily all that much correspondence between them. (There might be. But\nthis has to be empirically established.) For example: much of the mythology of\n“the West” goes back to Herodotus’ description of an epochal clash between the\nPersian Empire, based on an ideal of obedience and absolute power, and the\nGreek cities of Athens and Sparta, based on ideals of civic autonomy, freedom\nand equality. It’s not that these ideas—especially their vivid representations\nin poets like Aeschylus or historians like Herodotus—are not important. One\ncould not possibly understand Western history without them. But their very\nimportance and vividness long blinded historians to what is becoming the\nincreasingly clear reality: that whatever its ideals, the Achmaenid Empire was\na pretty light touch when it came to the day-to-day control of its subjects’\nlives, particularly in comparison with the degree of control exercised by\nAthenians over their slaves or Spartans over the overwhelming majority of the\nLaconian population, who were helots. Whatever the ideals, the reality, for\nmost people involved, was much the other way around.\n\nOne of the most striking discoveries of evolutionary anthropology has been\nthat it is perfectly possible to have kings and nobles and all the exterior\ntrappings of monarchy without having a state in the mechanical sense at all.\nOne should think this might be of some interest to all those political\nphilosophers who spill so much ink arguing about theories of\n“sovereignty”—since it suggests that most sovereigns were not heads of state\nand that their favorite technical term actually is built on a near-impossible\nideal, in which royal power actually does manage to translate its cosmological\npretensions into genuine bureaucratic control of a given territorial\npopulation. (Something like this started happening in Western Europe in the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but almost as soon as it did, the\nsovereign’s personal power was replaced by a fictive person called “the\npeople,” allowing the bureaucracy to take over almost entirely.) But so far as\nI’m aware, political philosophers have as yet had nothing to say on the\nsubject. I suspect this is largely due to an extremely poor choice of terms.\nEvolutionary anthropologists refer to kingdoms which lack full-fledged\ncoercive bureaucracies as “chiefdoms,” a term which evokes images more of\nGeronimo or Sitting Bull than Solomon, Louis the Pious, or the Yellow Emperor.\nAnd of course the evolutionist framework itself ensures that such structures\nare seen as something which immediately precedes the emergence of the state,\nnot an alternative form, or even something a state can turn into. To clarify\nall this would be a major historical project.\n\n\n#### 2) A THEORY OF POLITICAL ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT STATES\n\nSo that’s one project: to reanalyze the state as a relation between a utopian\nimaginary, and a messy reality involving strategies of flight and evasion,\npredatory elites, and a mechanics of regulation and control.\n\nAll this highlights the pressing need for another project: one which will ask,\nIf many political entities we are used to seeing as states, at least in any\nWeberian sense, are not, then what are they? And what does that imply about\npolitical possibilities?\n\nIn a way it’s kind of amazing that such a theoretical literature doesn’t\nalready exist. It’s yet another sign, I guess, of how hard it is for us to\nthink outside the statist framework. An excellent case in point: one of the\nmost consistent demands of “anti-globalization” activists has been for the\nelimination of border restrictions. If we’re to globalize, we say, let’s get\nserious about it. Eliminate national borders. Let people come and go as they\nplease, and live wherever they like. The demand is often phrased in terms of\nsome notion of global citizenship. But this inspires immediate objections:\ndoesn’t a call for “global citizenship” mean calling for some kind of global\nstate? Would we really want that? So then the question becomes how do we\ntheorize a citizenship outside the state. This is often treated as a profound,\nperhaps insurmountable, dilemma; but if one considers the matter historically,\nit’s hard to understand why it should be. Modern Western notions of\ncitizenship and political freedoms are usually seen to derive from two\ntraditions, one originating in ancient Athens, the other primarily stemming\nfrom medieval England (where it tends to be traced back to the assertion of\naristocratic privilege against the Crown in the Magna Carta, Petition of\nRight, etc., and then the gradual extension of these same rights to the rest\nof the population). In fact there is no consensus among historians that either\nclassical Athens or medieval England were states at all—and moreover,\nprecisely for the reason that citizens’ rights in the first, and aristocratic\nprivilege in the second, were so well established. It is hard to think of\nAthens as a state, with a monopoly of force by the state apparatus, if one\nconsiders that the minimal government apparatus which did exist consisted\nentirely of slaves, owned collectively by the citizenry. Athens’ police force\nconsisted of Scythian archers imported from what’s now Russia or Ukraine, and\nsomething of their legal standing might be gleaned from the fact that, by\nAthenian law, a slave’s testimony was not admissible as evidence in court\nunless it was obtained under torture.\n\nSo what do we call such entities? “Chiefdoms”? One might conceivably be able\nto describe King John as a “chief” in the technical, evolutionary sense, but\napplying the term to Pericles does seem absurd. Neither can we continue to\ncall ancient Athens a “city-state” if it wasn’t a state at all. It seems we\njust don’t have the intellectual tools to talk about such things. The same\ngoes for the typology of types of state, or state-like entities in more recent\ntimes: an historian named Spruyt has suggested that in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries the territorial nation-state was hardly the only game in\ntown; there were other possibilities (Italian city-states, which actually were\nstates; the Hanseatic league of confederated mercantile centers, which\ninvolved an entirely different conception of sovereignty) which didn’t happen\nto win out—at least, right away—but were no less intrinsically viable. I have\nmyself suggested that one reason the territorial nation-state ended up winning\nout was because, in this early stage of globalization, Western elites were\ntrying to model themselves on China, the only state in existence at the time\nwhich actually seemed to conform to their ideal of a uniform population, who\nin Confucian terms were the source of sovereignty, creators of a vernacular\nliterature, subject to a uniform code of laws, administered by bureaucrats\nchosen by merit, trained in that vernacular literature... With the current\ncrisis of the nation-state and rapid increase in international institutions\nwhich are not exactly states, but in many ways just as obnoxious, juxtaposed\nagainst attempts to create international institutions which do many of the\nsame things as states but would be considerably less obnoxious, the lack of\nsuch a body of theory is becoming a genuine crisis.\n\n\n#### 3) YET ANOTHER THEORY OF CAPITALISM\n\nOne is loathe to suggest this but the endless drive to naturalize capitalism\nby reducing it to a matter of commercial calculation, which then allows one to\nclaim it is as old as Sumer, just screams out for it. At the very least we\nneed a proper theory of the history of wage labor, and relations like it.\nSince after all, it is in performing wage labor, not in buying and selling,\nthat most humans now waste away most of their waking hours and it is that\nwhich makes them miserable. (Hence the IWW didn’t say they were “anti-\ncapitalist,” much though they were; they got right to the point and said they\nwere “against the wage system.”) The earliest wage labor contracts we have on\nrecord appear to be really about the rental of slaves. What about a model of\ncapitalism that sets out from that? Where anthropologists like Jonathan\nFriedman argue that ancient slavery was really just an older version of\ncapitalism, we could just as easily—actually, a lot more easily—argue that\nmodern capitalism is really just a newer version of slavery. Instead of people\nselling us or renting us out we rent out ourselves. But it’s basically the\nsame sort of arrangement.\n\n\n#### 4) POWER/IGNORANCE, or POWER/STUPIDITY\n\nAcademics love Michel Foucault’s argument that identifies knowledge and power,\nand insists that brute force is no longer a major factor in social control.\nThey love it because it flatters them: the perfect formula for people who like\nto think of themselves as political radicals even though all they do is write\nessays likely to be read by a few dozen other people in an institutional\nenvironment. Of course, if any of these academics were to walk into their\nuniversity library to consult some volume of Foucault without having\nremembered to bring a valid ID, and decided to enter the stacks anyway, they\nwould soon discover that brute force is really not so far away as they like to\nimagine—a man with a big stick, trained in exactly how hard to hit people with\nit, would rapidly appear to eject them.\n\nIn fact the threat of that man with the stick permeates our world at every\nmoment; most of us have given up even thinking of crossing the innumerable\nlines and barriers he creates, just so we don’t have to remind ourselves of\nhis existence. If you see a hungry woman standing several yards away from a\nhuge pile of food—a daily occurrence for most of us who live in cities—there\nis a reason you can’t just take some and give it to her. A man with a big\nstick will come and very likely hit you. Anarchists, in contrast, have always\ndelighted in reminding us of him. Residents of the squatter community of\nChristiana, Denmark, for example, have a Christmastide ritual where they dress\nin Santa suits, take toys from department stores and distribute them to\nchildren on the street, partly just so everyone can relish the images of the\ncops beating down Santa and snatching the toys back from crying children.\n\nSuch a theoretical emphasis opens the way to a theory of the relation of power\nnot with knowledge, but with ignorance and stupidity. Because violence,\nparticularly structural violence, where all the power is on one side, creates\nignorance. If you have the power to hit people over the head whenever you\nwant, you don’t have to trouble yourself too much figuring out what they think\nis going on, and therefore, generally speaking, you don’t. Hence the sure-fire\nway to simplify social arrangements, to ignore the incredibly complex play of\nperspectives, passions, insights, desires, and mutual understandings that\nhuman life is really made of, is to make a rule and threaten to attack anyone\nwho breaks it. This is why violence has always been the favored recourse of\nthe stupid: it is the one form of stupidity to which it is almost impossible\nto come up with an intelligent response. It is also of course the basis of the\nstate.\n\nContrary to popular belief, bureaucracies do not create stupidity. They are\nways of managing situations that are already inherently stupid because they\nare, ultimately, based on the arbitrariness of force.\n\nUltimately this should lead to a theory of the relation of violence and the\nimagination. Why is it that the folks on the bottom (the victims of structural\nviolence) are always imagining what it must be like for the folks on top (the\nbeneficiaries of structural violence), but it almost never occurs to the folks\non top to wonder what it might be like to be on the bottom? Human beings being\nthe sympathetic creatures that they are this tends to become one of the main\nbastions of any system of inequality—the downtrodden actually care about their\noppressors, at least, far more than their oppressors care about them—but this\nseems itself to be an effect of structural violence.\n\n\n#### 5) AN ECOLOGY OF VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATIONS\n\nWhat kinds exist? In what environments do they thrive? Where did the bizarre\nnotion of the “corporation” come from anyway?\n\n\n#### 6) A THEORY OF POLITICAL HAPPINESS\n\nRather than just a theory of why most contemporary people never experience it.\nThat would be easy.\n\n\n#### 7) HIERARCHY\n\nA theory of how structures of hierarchy, by their own logic, necessarily\ncreate their own counterimage or negation. They do, you know.\n\n\n#### 8) SUFFERING AND PLEASURE: ON THE PRIVATIZATION OF DESIRE\n\nIt is common wisdom among anarchists, autonomists, Situationists, and other\nnew revolutionaries that the old breed of grim, determined, self-sacrificing\nrevolutionary, who sees the world only in terms of suffering will ultimately\nonly produce more suffering himself. Certainly that’s what has tended to\nhappen in the past. Hence the emphasis on pleasure, carnival, on creating\n“temporary autonomous zones” where one can live as if one is already free. The\nideal of the “festival of resistance” with its crazy music and giant puppets\nis, quite consciously, to return to the late medieval world of huge wickerwork\ngiants and dragons, maypoles and morris dancing; the very world the Puritan\npioneers of the “capitalist spirit” hated so much and ultimately managed to\ndestroy. The history of capitalism moves from attacks on collective, festive\nconsumption to the promulgation of highly personal, private, even furtive\nforms (after all, once they had all those people dedicating all their time to\nproducing stuff instead of partying, they did have to figure out a way to sell\nit all); a process of the privitization of desire. The theoretical question:\nhow to reconcile all this with the disturbing theoretical insight of people\nlike Slavoj Zizek: that if one wishes to inspire ethnic hatred, the easiest\nway to do so is to concentrate on the bizarre, perverse ways in which the\nother group is assumed to pursue pleasure. If one wishes to emphasize\ncommonality, the easiest way is to point out that they also feel pain.\n\n\n#### 9) ONE OR SEVERAL THEORIES OF ALIENATION\n\nThis is the ultimate prize: what, precisely, are the possible dimensions of\nnon-alienated experience? How might its modalities be catalogued, or\nconsidered? Any anarchist anthropology worth its salt would have to pay\nparticular attention to this question because this is precisely what all those\npunks, hippies, and activists of every stripe most look to anthropology to\nlearn. It’s the anthropologists, so terrified of being accused of\nromanticizing the societies they study that they refuse to even suggest there\nmight be an answer, who leave them no recourse but to fall into the arms of\nthe real romanticizers. Primitivists like John Zerzan, who in trying to\nwhittle away what seems to divide us from pure, unmediated experience, end up\nwhittling away absolutely everything. Zerzan’s increasingly popular works end\nup condemning the very existence of language, math, time keeping, music, and\nall forms of art and representation. They are all written off as forms of\nalienation, leaving us with a kind of impossible evolutionary ideal: the only\ntruly non-alienated human being was not even quite human, but more a kind of\nperfect ape, in some kind of currently-unimaginable telepathic connection with\nits fellows, at one with wild nature, living maybe about a hundred thousand\nyears ago. True revolution could only mean somehow returning to that. How it\nis that afficionados of this sort of thing still manage to engage in effective\npolitical action (because it’s been my experience that many do quite\nremarkable work) is itself a fascinating sociological question. But surely, an\nalternative analysis of alienation might be useful here.\n\nWe could start with a kind of sociology of micro-utopias, the counterpart of a\nparallel typology of forms of alienation, alienated and nonalienated forms of\naction... The moment we stop insisting on viewing all forms of action only by\ntheir function in reproducing larger, total, forms of inequality of power, we\nwill also be able to see that anarchist social relations and non-alienated\nforms of action are all around us. And this is critical because it already\nshows that anarchism is, already, and has always been, one of the main bases\nfor human interaction. We self-organize and engage in mutual aid all the time.\nWe always have. We also engage in artistic creativity, which I think if\nexamined would reveal that many of the least alienated forms of experience do\nusually involve an element of what a Marxist would call fetishization. It is\nall the more pressing to develop such a theory if you accept that (as I have\nfrequently argued) revolutionary constituencies always involve a tacit\nalliance between the least alienated and the most oppressed.\n\nQ: How many voters does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: None. Because voters can’t change anything.\n\nThere is of course no single anarchist program—nor could there really be—but\nit might be helpful to end by giving the reader some idea about current\ndirections of thought and organizing.\n\n\n### (1) Globalization and the Elimination of North-South Inequalities\n\nAs I’ve mentioned, the “anti-globalization movement” is increasingly anarchist\nin inspiration. In the long run the anarchist position on globalization is\nobvious: the effacement of nation-states will mean the elimination of national\nborders. This is genuine globalization. Anything else is just a sham. But for\nthe interim, there are all sorts of concrete suggestions on how the situation\ncan be improved right now, without falling back on statist, protectionist,\napproaches. One example:\n\nOnce during the protests before the World Economic Forum, a kind of junket of\ntycoons, corporate flacks and politicians, networking and sharing cocktails at\nthe Waldorf Astoria, pretended to be discussing ways to alleviate global\npoverty. I was invited to engage in a radio debate with one of their\nrepresentatives. As it happened the task went to another activist but I did\nget far enough to prepare a three-point program that I think would have taken\ncare of the problem nicely:\n\n• an immediate amnesty on international debt (An amnesty on personal debt\nmight not be a bad idea either but it’s a different issue.)\n\n• an immediate cancellation of all patents and other intellectual property\nrights related to technology more than one year old\n\n• the elimination of all restrictions on global freedom of travel or residence\n\nThe rest would pretty much take care of itself. The moment the average\nresident of Tanzania, or Laos, was no longer forbidden to relocate to\nMinneapolis or Rotterdam, the government of every rich and powerful country in\nthe world would certainly decide nothing was more important than finding a way\nto make sure people in Tanzania and Laos preferred to stay there. Do you\nreally think they couldn’t come up with something?\n\nThe point is that despite the endless rhetoric about “complex, subtle,\nintractable issues” (justifying decades of expensive research by the rich and\ntheir well-paid flunkies), the anarchist program would probably have resolved\nmost of them in five or six years. But, you will say, these demands are\nentirely unrealistic! True enough. But why are they unrealistic? Mainly,\nbecause those rich guys meeting in the Waldorf would never stand for any of\nit. This is why we say they are themselves the problem.\n\n\n### (2) The Struggle Against Work\n\nThe struggle against work has always been central to anarchist organizing. By\nthis I mean, not the struggle for better worker conditions or higher wages,\nbut the struggle to eliminate work, as a relation of domination, entirely.\nHence the IWW slogan “against the wage system.” This is a long-term goal of\ncourse. In the shorter term, what can’t be eliminated can at least be reduced.\nAround the turn of the century, the Wobblies and other anarchists played the\ncentral role in winning workers the 5-day week and 8-hour day.\n\nIn Western Europe social democratic governments are now, for the first time in\nalmost a century, once again reducing the working week. They are only\ninstituting trifling changes (from a 40-hour week to 35), but in the US no\none’s even discussing that much. Instead they are discussing whether to\neliminate timeand-a-half for overtime. This despite the fact that Americans\nnow spend more hours working than any other population in the world, including\nJapan. So the Wobblies have reappeared, with what was to be the next step in\ntheir program, even back in the ‘20s: the 16-hour week. (“4-day week, 4-hour\nday.”) Again, on the face of it, this seems completely unrealistic, even\ninsane. But has anyone carried out a feasibility study? After all, it has been\nrepeatedly demonstrated that a considerable chunk of the hours worked in\nAmerica are only actually necessary to compensate for problems created by the\nfact that Americans work too much. (Consider here such jobs as all-night pizza\ndeliveryman or dog-washer, or those women who run nighttime day care centers\nfor the children of women who have to work nights providing child care for\nbusinesswomen...not to mention the endless hours spent by specialists cleaning\nup the emotional and physical damage caused by overwork, the injuries,\nsuicides, divorces, murderous rampages, producing the drugs to pacify the\nchildren...)\n\nSo what jobs are really necessary?\n\nWell, for starters, there are lots of jobs whose disappearance, almost\neveryone would agree, would be a net gain for humanity. Consider here\ntelemarketers, stretch-SUV manufacturers, or for that matter, corporate\nlawyers. We could also eliminate the entire advertising and PR industries,\nfire all politicians and their staffs, eliminate anyone remotely connected\nwith an HMO, without even beginning to get near essential social functions.\nThe elimination of advertising would also reduce the production, shipping, and\nselling of unnecessary products, since those items people actually do want or\nneed, they will still figure out a way to find out about. The elimination of\nradical inequalities would mean we would no longer require the services of\nmost of the millions currently employed as doormen, private security forces,\nprison guards, or SWAT teams—not to mention the military. Beyond that, we’d\nhave to do research. Financiers, insurers, and investment bankers are all\nessentially parasitic beings, but there might be some useful functions in\nthese sectors that could not simply be replaced with software. All in all we\nmight discover that if we identified the work that really did need to be done\nto maintain a comfortable and ecologically sustainable standard of living, and\nredistribute the hours, it may turn out that the Wobbly platform is perfectly\nrealistic. Especially if we bear in mind that it’s not like anyone would be\nforced to stop working after four hours if they didn’t feel like it. A lot of\npeople do enjoy their jobs, certainly more than they would lounging around\ndoing nothing all day (that’s why in prisons, when they want to punish\ninmates, they take away their right to work), and if one has eliminated the\nendless indignities and sadomasochistic games that inevitably follow from top-\ndown organization, one would expect a lot more would. It might even turn out\nthat no one will have to work more than they particularly want to.\n\n\n#### minor note:\n\nAdmittedly, all of this presumes the total reorganization of work, a kind of\n“after the revolution” scenario which I’ve argued is a necessary tool to even\nbegin to think about human possibilities, even if revolution will probably\nnever take such an apocalyptic form. This of course brings up the “who will do\nthe dirty jobs?” question—one which always gets thrown at anarchists or other\nutopians. Peter Kropotkin long ago pointed out the fallacy of the argument.\nThere’s no particular reason dirty jobs have to exist. If one divided up the\nunpleasant tasks equally, that would mean all the world’s top scientists and\nengineers would have to do them too; one could expect the creation of self-\ncleaning kitchens and coal-mining robots almost immediately.\n\nAll this is something of an aside though because what I really want to do in\nthis final section is focus on:\n\n\n### (3) DEMOCRACY\n\nThis might give the reader a chance to have a glance at what anarchist, and\nanarchist-inspired, organizing is actually like—some of the contours of the\nnew world now being built in the shell of the old—and to show what the\nhistorical-ethnographic perspective I’ve been trying to develop here, our non-\nexistent science, might be able to contribute to it.\n\nThe first cycle of the new global uprising— what the press still insists on\nreferring to, increasingly ridiculously, as “the anti-globalization movement”—\nbegan with the autonomous municipalities of Chiapas and came to a head with\nthe _asambleas barreales_ of Buenos Aires, and cities throughout Argentina.\nThere is hardly room here to tell the whole story: beginning with the\nZapatistas’ rejection of the idea of seizing power and their attempt instead\nto create a model of democratic self-organization to inspire the rest of\nMexico; their initiation of an international network (People’s Global Action,\nor PGA) which then put out the calls for days of action against the WTO (in\nSeattle), IMF (in Washington, Prague...) and so on; and finally, the collapse\nof the Argentine economy, and the overwhelming popular uprising which, again,\nrejected the very idea that one could find a solution by replacing one set of\npoliticians with another. The slogan of the Argentine movement was, from the\nstart, _que se vayan todas—get_ rid of the lot of them. Instead of a new\ngovernment they created a vast network of alternative institutions, starting\nwith popular assemblies to govern each urban neighborhood (the only limitation\non participation is that one cannot be employed by a political party),\nhundreds of occupied, worker-managed factories, a complex system of “barter”\nand newfangled alternative currency system to keep them in operation—in short,\nan endless variation on the theme of direct democracy.\n\nAll of this has happened completely below the radar screen of the corporate\nmedia, which also missed the point of the great mobilizations. The\norganization of these actions was meant to be a living illustration of what a\ntruly democratic world might be like, from the festive puppets to the careful\norganization of affinity groups and spokescouncils, all operating without a\nleadership structure, always based on principles of consensus-based direct\ndemocracy. It was the kind of organization which most people would have, had\nthey simply heard it proposed, written off as a pipe-dream; but it worked, and\nso effectively that the police departments of city after city were completely\nflummoxed with how to deal with them. Of course, this also had something to do\nwith the unprecedented tactics (hundreds of activists in fairy suits tickling\npolice with feather dusters, or padded with so many inflatable inner tubes and\nrubber cushions they seemed to roll along like the Michelin man over\nbarricades, incapable of damaging anyone else but also pretty much impervious\nto police batons...), which completely confused traditional categories of\nviolence and nonviolence.\n\nWhen protesters in Seattle chanted “this is what democracy looks like,” they\nmeant to be taken literally. In the best tradition of direct action, they not\nonly confronted a certain form of power, exposing its mechanisms and\nattempting literally to stop it in its tracks: they did it in a way which\ndemonstrated why the kind of social relations on which it is based were\nunnecessary. This is why all the condescending remarks about the movement\nbeing dominated by a bunch of dumb kids with no coherent ideology completely\nmissed the mark. The diversity was a function of the decentralized form of\norganization, and this organization _was_ the movement’s ideology.\n\nThe key term in the new movement is “process,” by which is meant, decision-\nmaking process. In North America, this is almost invariably done through some\nprocess of finding consensus. This is as I mentioned much less ideologically\nstifling than it may sound because the assumption behind all good consensus\nprocess is that one should not even try to convert others to one’s overall\npoint of view; the point of consensus process is to allow a group to decide on\na common course of action. Instead of voting proposals up and down, then,\nproposals are worked and reworked, scotched or reinvented, until one ends up\nwith something everyone can live with. When it comes to the final stage,\nactually “finding consensus,” there are two levels of possible objection: one\ncan “stand aside,” which is to say “I don’t like this and won’t participate\nbut I wouldn’t stop anyone else from doing it,” or “block,” which has the\neffect of a veto. One can only block if one feels a proposal is in violation\nof the fundamental principles or reasons for being of a group. One might say\nthat the function which in the US constitution is relegated to the courts, of\nstriking down legislative decisions that violate constitutional principles, is\nhere relegated to anyone with the courage to actually stand up against the\ncombined will of the group (though of course there are also ways of\nchallenging unprincipled blocks).\n\nOne could go on at length about the elaborate and surprisingly sophisticated\nmethods that have been developed to ensure all this works; of forms of\nmodified consensus required for very large groups; of the way consensus itself\nreinforces the principle of decentralization by ensuring one doesn’t really\nwant to bring proposals before very large groups unless one has to, of means\nof ensuring gender equity and resolving conflict... The point is this is a\nform of direct democracy which is very different than the kind we usually\nassociate with the term-—or, for that matter, with the kind usually employed\nby European or North American anarchists of earlier generations, or still\nemployed, say, in urban Argentine _asambleas._ In North America, consensus\nprocess emerged more than anything else through the feminist movement, as part\nof broad backlash against some of the more obnoxious, self-aggrandizing macho\nleadership styles of the ‘60s New Left. Much of the procedure was originally\nadopted from the Quakers, and Quakerinspired groups; the Quakers, in turn,\nclaim to have been inspired by Native American practice. How much the latter\nis really true is, in historical terms, difficult to determine. Nonetheless,\nNative American decision-making did normally work by some form of consensus.\nActually, so do most popular assemblies around the world now, from the Tzeltal\nor Tzotzil or Tojolobal-speaking communities in Chiapas to Malagasy\n_fokon’olona._ After having lived in Madagascar for two years, I was startled,\nthe first time I started attending meetings of the Direct Action Network in\nNew York, by how familiar it all seemed—the main difference was that the DAN\nprocess was so much more formalized and explicit. It had to be, since everyone\nin DAN was just figuring out how to make decisions this way, and everything\nhad to be spelled out; whereas in Madagascar, everyone had been doing this\nsince they learned to speak.\n\nIn fact, as anthropologists are aware, just about every known human community\nwhich has to come to group decisions has employed some variation of what I’m\ncalling “consensus process”—every one, that is, which is not in some way or\nanother drawing on the tradition of ancient Greece. Majoritarian democracy, in\nthe formal, Roberts Rules of Ordertype sense rarely emerges of its own accord.\nIt’s curious that almost no one, anthropologists included, ever seems to ask\noneself why this should be.\n\n\n#### An hypothesis.\n\nMajoritarian democracy was, in its origins, essentially a military\ninstitution.\n\nOf course it’s the peculiar bias of Western historiography that this is the\nonly sort of democracy that is seen to count as “democracy” at all. We are\nusually told that democracy originated in ancient Athens—like science, or\nphilosophy, it was a Greek invention. It’s never entirely clear what this is\nsupposed to mean. Are we supposed to believe that before the Athenians, it\nnever really occurred to anyone, anywhere, to gather all the members of their\ncommunity in order to make joint decisions in a way that gave everyone equal\nsay? That would be ridiculous. Clearly there have been plenty of egalitarian\nsocieties in history— many far more egalitarian than Athens, many that must\nhave existed before 500 BCE—and obviously, they must have had some kind of\nprocedure for coming to decisions for matters of collective importance. Yet\nsomehow, it is always assumed that these procedures, whatever they might have\nbeen, could not have been, properly speaking, “democratic.”\n\nEven scholars with otherwise impeccable radical credentials, promoters of\ndirect democracy, have been known to bend themselves into pretzels trying to\njustify this attitude. Non-Western egalitarian communities are “kin-based,”\nargues Murray Bookchin. (And Greece was not? Of course the Athenian agora was\nnot itself kin-based but neither is a Malagasy _fokon’olona_ or Balinese\n_seka._ So what?) “Some might speak of Iroquois or Berber democracy,” argued\nCornelius Castoriadis, “but this is an abuse of the term. These are primitive\nsocieties which assume the social order is handed to them by gods or spirits,\nnot self-constituted by the people themselves as in Athens.” (Really? In fact\nthe “League of the Iroquois” was a treaty organization, seen as a common\nagreement created in historical times, and subject to constant renegotiation.)\nThe arguments never make sense. But they don’t really have to because we are\nnot really dealing with arguments at all here, so much as with the brush of a\nhand.\n\nThe real reason for the unwillingness of most scholars to see a Sulawezi or\nTallensi village council as “democratic”—well, aside from simple racism, the\nreluctance to admit anyone Westerners slaughtered with such relative impunity\nwere quite on the level as Pericles—is that they do not vote. Now, admittedly,\nthis is an interesting fact. Why not? If we accept the idea that a show of\nhands, or having everyone who supports a proposition stand on one side of the\nplaza and everyone against stand on the other, are not really such incredibly\nsophisticated ideas that they never would have occurred to anyone until some\nancient genius “invented” them, then why are they so rarely employed? Again,\nwe seem to have an example of explicit rejection. Over and over, across the\nworld, from Australia to Siberia, egalitarian communities have preferred some\nvariation on consensus process. Why?\n\nThe explanation I would propose is this: it is much easier, in a face-to-face\ncommunity, to figure out what most members of that community want to do, than\nto figure out how to convince those who do not to go along with it. Consensus\ndecision-making is typical of societies where there would be no way to compel\na minority to agree with a majority decision—either because there is no state\nwith a monopoly of coercive force, or because the state has nothing to do with\nlocal decision-making. If there is no way to compel those who find a majority\ndecision distasteful to go along with it, then the last thing one would want\nto do is to hold a vote: a public contest which someone will be seen to lose.\nVoting would be the most likely means to guarantee humiliations, resentments,\nhatreds, in the end, the destruction of communities. What is seen as an\nelaborate and difficult process of finding consensus is, in fact, a long\nprocess of making sure no one walks away feeling that their views have been\ntotally ignored.\n\nMajority democracy, we might say, can only emerge when two factors coincide:\n\n1\\. a feeling that people should have equal say in making group decisions, and\n\n2\\. a coercive apparatus capable of enforcing those decisions.\n\nFor most of human history, it has been extremely unusual to have both at the\nsame time. Where egalitarian societies exist, it is also usually considered\nwrong to impose systematic coercion. Where a machinery of coercion did exist,\nit did not even occur to those wielding it that they were enforcing any sort\nof popular will.\n\nIt is of obvious relevance that Ancient Greece was one of the most competitive\nsocieties known to history. It was a society that tended to make everything\ninto a public contest, from athletics to philosophy or tragic drama or just\nabout anything else. So it might not seem entirely surprising that they made\npolitical decision-making into a public contest as well. Even more crucial\nthough was the fact that decisions were made by a populace in arms. Aristotle,\nin his _Politics,_ remarks that the constitution of a Greek city-state will\nnormally depend on the chief arm of its military: if this is cavalry, it will\nbe an aristocracy, since horses are expensive. If hoplite infantry, it will\nhave an oligarchy, as all could not afford the armor and training. If its\npower was based in the navy or light infantry, one could expect a democracy,\nas anyone can row, or use a sling. In other words if a man is armed, then one\npretty much has to take his opinions into account. One can see how this worked\nat its starkest in Xenophon’s _Anabasis,_ which tells the story of an army of\nGreek mercenaries who suddenly find themselves leaderless and lost in the\nmiddle of Persia. They elect new officers, and then hold a collective vote to\ndecide what to do next. In a case like this, even if the vote was 60/40,\neveryone could see the balance of forces and what would happen if things\nactually came to blows. Every vote was, in a real sense, a conquest.\n\nRoman legions could be similarly democratic; this was the main reason they\nwere never allowed to enter the city of Rome. And when Machiavelli revived the\nnotion of a democratic republic at the dawn of the “modern” era, he\nimmediately reverted to the notion of a populace in arms.\n\nThis in turn might help explain the term “democracy” itself, which appears to\nhave been coined as something of a slur by its elitist opponents: it literally\nmeans the “force” or even “violence” of the people. _Kratos,_ not _archos._\nThe elitists who coined the term always considered democracy not too far from\nsimple rioting or mob rule; though of course their solution was the permanent\nconquest of the people by someone else. And ironically, when they did manage\nto suppress democracy for this reason, which was usually, the result was that\nthe only way the general populace’s will was known was precisely through\nrioting, a practice that became quite institutionalized in, say, imperial Rome\nor eighteenthcentury England.\n\nAll this is not to say that direct democracies— as practiced, for example, in\nmedieval cities or New England town meetings—were not normally orderly and\ndignified procedures; though one suspects that here too, in actual practice,\nthere was a certain baseline of consensus-seeking going on. Still, it was this\nmilitary undertone which allowed the authors of the _Federalist Papers,_ like\nalmost all other literate men of their day, to take it for granted that what\nthey called “democracy”—by which they meant, direct democracy—was in its\nnature the most unstable, tumultuous form of government, not to mention one\nwhich endangers the rights of minorities (the specific minority they had in\nmind in this case being the rich). It was only once the term “democracy” could\nbe almost completely transformed to incorporate the principle of\nrepresentation—a term which itself has a very curious history, since as\nCornelius Castoriadis notes, it originally referred to representatives of the\npeople before the king, internal ambassadors in fact, rather than those who\nwielded power in any sense themselves—that it was rehabilitated, in the eyes\nof well-born political theorists, and took on the meaning it has today.\n\nIn a sense then anarchists think all those rightwing political theorists who\ninsist that “America is not a democracy; it’s a republic” are quite correct.\nThe difference is that anarchists have a problem with that. They think it\nought to be a democracy. Though increasing numbers have come to accept that\nthe traditional elitist criticism of majoritarian direct democracy is not\nentirely baseless either.\n\nI noted earlier that all social orders are in some sense at war with\nthemselves. Those unwilling to establish an apparatus of violence for\nenforcing decisions necessarily have to develop an apparatus for creating and\nmaintaining social consensus (at least in that minimal sense of ensuring\nmalcontents can still feel they have freely chosen to go along with bad\ndecisions); as an apparent result, the internal war ends up projected outwards\ninto endless night battles and forms of spectral violence. Majoritarian direct\ndemocracy is constantly threatening to make those lines of force explicit. For\nthis reason it does tend to be rather unstable: or more precisely, if it does\nlast, it’s because its institutional forms (the medieval city, New England\ntown council, for that matter gallup polls, referendums...) are almost\ninvariably ensconced within a larger framework of governance in which ruling\nelites use that very instability to justify their ultimate monopoly of the\nmeans of violence. Finally, the threat of this instability becomes an excuse\nfor a form of “democracy” so minimal that it comes down to nothing more than\ninsisting that ruling elites should occasionally consult with “the public”—in\ncarefully staged contests, replete with rather meaningless jousts and\ntournaments—to reestablish their right to go on making their decisions for\nthem.\n\nIt’s a trap. Bouncing back and forth between the two ensures it will remain\nextremely unlikely that one could ever imagine it would be possible for people\nto manage their own lives, without the help of “representatives.” It’s for\nthis reason the new global movement has begun by reinventing the very meaning\nof democracy. To do so ultimately means, once again, coming to terms with the\nfact that “we”—whether as “the West” (whatever that means), as the “modern\nworld,” or anything else—are not really as special as we like to think we are;\nthat we’re not the only people ever to have practiced democracy; that in fact,\nrather than disseminating democracy around the world, “Western” governments\nhave been spending at least as much time inserting themselves into the lives\nof people who have been practicing democracy for thousands of years, and in\none way or another, telling them to cut it out.\n\nOne of the most encouraging things about these new, anarchist-inspired\nmovements is that they propose a new form of internationalism. Older,\ncommunist internationalism had some very beautiful ideals, but in\norganizational terms, everyone basically flowed one way. It became a means for\nregimes outside Europe and its settler colonies to learn Western styles of\norganization: party structures, plenaries, purges, bureaucratic hierarchies,\nsecret police... This time—the second wave of internationalism one could call\nit, or just, anarchist globalization—the movement of organizational forms has\nlargely gone the other way. It’s not just consensus process: the idea of mass\nnon-violent direct action first developed in South Africa and India; the\ncurrent network model was first proposed by rebels in Chiapas; even the notion\nof the affinity group came out of Spain and Latin America. The fruits of\nethnography—and the techniques of ethnography—could be enormously helpful here\nif anthropologists can get past their—however understandable—hesitancy, owing\nto their own often squalid colonial history, and come to see what they are\nsitting on not as some guilty secret (which is nonetheless their guilty\nsecret, and no one else’s) but as the common property of humankind.\n\n\n## ANTHROPOLOGY\n\n(in which the author somewhat reluctantly bites the hand that feeds him)\n\nThe final question—-one that I’ve admittedly been rather avoiding up to\nnow—-is why anthropologists haven’t, so far? I have already described why I\nthink academics, in general, have rarely felt much affinity with anarchism.\nI’ve talked a little about the radical inclinations in much early twentieth-\ncentury anthropology, which often showed a very strong affinity with\nanarchism, but that seemed to largely evaporate over time. It’s all a little\nodd. Anthropologists are after all the only group of scholars who know\nanything about actually-existing stateless societies; many have actually lived\nin corners of the world where states have ceased to function or at least\ntemporarily pulled up stakes and left, and people are managing their own\naffairs autonomously; if nothing else, they are keenly aware that the most\ncommonplace assumptions about what would happen in the absence of a state\n(“but people would just kill each other!”) are factually untrue.\n\nWhy, then?\n\nWell, there are any number of reasons. Some are understandable enough. If\nanarchism is, essentially, an ethics of practice, then meditating on\nanthropological practice tends to kick up a lot of unpleasant things.\nParticularly if one concentrates on the experience of anthropological\nfieldwork—-which is what anthropologists invariably tend to do when they\nbecome reflexive. The discipline we know today was made possible by horrific\nschemes of conquest, colonization, and mass murder—much like most modern\nacademic disciplines, actually, including geography, and botany, not even to\nmention ones like mathematics, linguistics or robotics, which still are, but\nanthropologists, since their work tends to involve getting to know the victims\npersonally, have ended up agonizing over this in ways that the proponents of\nother disciplines have almost never done. The result has been strangely\nparadoxical: anthropological reflections on their own culpability has mainly\nhad the effect of providing non-anthropologists who do not want to be bothered\nhaving to learn about 90% of human experience with a handy two or three\nsentence dismissal (you know: all about projecting one’s sense of Otherness\ninto the colonized) by which they can feel morally superior to those who do.\n\nFor the anthropologists themselves, the results have been strangely\nparadoxical as well. While anthropologists are, effectively, sitting on a vast\narchive of human experience, of social and political experiments no one else\nreally knows about, that very body of comparative ethnography is seen as\nsomething shameful. As I mentioned, it is treated not as the common heritage\nof humankind, but as our dirty little secret. Which is actually convenient, at\nleast insofar as academic power is largely about establishing ownership rights\nover a certain form of knowledge and ensuring that others don’t really have\nmuch access to it. Because as I also mentioned, our dirty little secret is\nstill ours. It’s not something one needs to share with others.\n\nThere’s more to it though. In many ways, anthropology seems a discipline\nterrified of its own potential. It is, for example, the only discipline in a\nposition to make generalizations about humanity as a whole—since it is the\nonly discipline that actually takes all of humanity into account, and is\nfamiliar with all the anomalous cases. (“All societies practice marriage, you\nsay? Well that depends on how you define ‘marriage.’ Among the Nayar...”) Yet\nit resolutely refuses to do so. I don’t think this is to be accounted for\nsolely as an understandable reaction to the right-wing proclivity to make\ngrand arguments about human nature to justify very particular, and usually,\nparticularly nasty social institutions (rape, war, free market\ncapitalism)—though certainly that is a big part of it. Partly it’s just the\nvastness of the subject matter. Who really has the means, in discussing, say,\nconceptions of desire, or imagination, or the self, or sovereignty, to\nconsider everything Chinese or Indian or Islamic thinkers have had to say on\nthe matter in addition to the Western canon, let alone folk conceptions\nprevalent in hundreds of Oceanic or Native American societies as well? It’s\njust too daunting. As a result, anthropologists no longer produce many broad\ntheoretical generalizations at all—instead, turning over the work to European\nphilosophers who usually have absolutely no problem discussing desire, or the\nimagination, or the self, or sovereignty, as if such concepts had been\ninvented by Plato or Aristotle, developed by Kant or DeSade, and never\nmeaningfully discussed by anyone outside of elite literary traditions in\nWestern Europe or North America. Where once anthropologists’ key theoretical\nterms were words like mana, totem, or taboo, the new buzzwords are invariably\nderived from Latin or Greek, usually via French, occasionally German.\n\nSo while anthropology might seem perfectly positioned to provide an\nintellectual forum for all sorts of planetary conversations, political and\notherwise, there is a certain built-in reluctance to do so.\n\nThen there’s the question of politics. Most anthropologists write as if their\nwork has obvious political significance, in a tone which suggests they\nconsider what they are doing quite radical, and certainly left of center. But\nwhat does this politics actually consist of? It’s increasingly hard to say. Do\nanthropologists tend to be anti-capitalist? Certainly it’s hard to think of\none who has much good to say about capitalism. Many are in the habit of\ndescribing the current age as one of “late capitalism,” as if by declaring it\nis about to end, they can by the very act of doing so hasten its demise. But\nit’s hard to think of an anthropologist who has, recently, made any sort of\nsuggestion of what an alternative to capitalism might be like. So are they\nliberals? Many can’t pronounce the word without a snort of contempt. What\nthen? As far as I can make out the only real fundamental political commitment\nrunning through the entire field is a kind of broad populism. If nothing else,\nwe are definitely not on the side of whoever, in a given situation, is or\nfancies themselves to be the elite. We’re for the little guys. Since in\npractice, most anthropologists are attached to (increasingly global)\nuniversities, or if not, end up in jobs like marketing consultancies or jobs\nwith the UN-—positions within the very apparatus of global rule—what this\nreally comes down to is a kind of constant, ritualized declaration of\ndisloyalty to that very global elite of which we ourselves, as academics,\nclearly form one (admittedly somewhat marginal) fraction.\n\nNow, what form does this populism take in practice? Mainly, it means that you\nmust demonstrate that the people you are studying, the little guys, are\nsuccessfully resisting some form of power or globalizing influence imposed on\nthem from above. This is, anyway, what most anthropologists talk about when\nthe subject turns to globalization—which it usually does almost immediately,\nnowadays, whatever it is you study. Whether it is advertising, or soap operas,\nor forms of labor discipline, or state-imposed legal systems, or anything else\nthat might seem to be crushing or homogenizing or manipulating one’s people,\none demonstrates that they are not fooled, not crushed, not homogenized;\nindeed they are creatively appropriating or reinterpreting what is being\nthrown at them in ways that its authors would never have anticipated. Of\ncourse, to some extent all this is true. I would certainly not wish to deny it\nis important to combat the—still remarkably widespread—popular assumption that\nthe moment people in Bhutan or Irian Jaya are exposed to MTV, their\ncivilization is basically over. What’s disturbing, at least to me, is the\ndegree to which this logic comes to echo that of global capitalism.\nAdvertising agencies, after all, do not claim to be imposing anything on the\npublic either. Particularly in this era of market segmentation, they claim to\nbe providing material for members of the public to appropriate and make their\nown in unpredictable and idiosyncratic ways. The rhetoric of “creative\nconsumption” in particular could be considered the very ideology of the new\nglobal market: a world in which all human behavior can be classified as either\nproduction, exchange, or consumption; in which exchange is assumed to be\ndriven by basic human proclivities for rational pursuit of profit which are\nthe same everywhere, and consumption becomes a way to establish one’s\nparticular identity (and production is not discussed at all if one can\npossibly avoid it). We’re all the same on the trading floor; it’s what we do\nwith the stuff when we get home that makes us different. This market logic has\nbecome so deeply internalized that, if, say, a woman in Trinidad puts together\nsome outrageous get-up and goes out dancing, anthropologists will\nautomatically assume that what she’s doing can be defined as “consumption” (as\nopposed to, say, showing off or having a good time), as if what’s really\nimportant about her evening is the fact that she buys a couple drinks, or\nmaybe, because the anthropologist considers wearing clothes itself to be\nsomehow like drinking, or maybe, because they just don’t think about it at all\nand assume that whatever one does that isn’t working is “consumption” because\nwhat’s really important about it is that manufactured products are involved.\nThe perspective of the anthropologist and the global marketing executive have\nbecome almost indistinguishable.\n\nIt’s not that different on the political level. Lauren Leve has recently\nwarned that anthropologists risk, if they are not careful, becoming yet\nanother cog in a global “identity machine,” a planet-wide apparatus of\ninstitutions and assumptions that has, over the last decade or so, effectively\ninformed the earth’s inhabitants (or at least, all but the very most elite)\nthat, since all debates about the nature of political or economic\npossibilities are now over, the only way one can now make a political claim is\nby asserting some group identity, with all the assumptions about what identity\nis (i.e., that group identities are not ways of comparing one group to each\nother but constituted by the way a group relates to its own history, that\nthere is no essential difference in this regard between individuals and\ngroups...) established in advance. Things have come to such a pass that in\ncountries like Nepal even Theravada Buddhists are forced to play identity\npolitics, a particularly bizarre spectacle since they are essentially basing\ntheir identity claims on adherence to a universalistic philosophy that insists\nidentity is an illusion.\n\nMany years ago a French anthropologist named Gerard Althabe wrote a book about\nMadagascar called _Oppression et Liberation dans l’Imaginaire._ It’s a catchy\nphrase. I think it might well be applied to what ends up happening in a lot of\nanthropological writing. For the most part, what we call “identities” here, in\nwhat Paul Gilroy likes to call the “over-developed world,” are forced on\npeople. In the United States, most are the products of ongoing oppression and\ninequality: someone who is defined as Black is not allowed to forget that\nduring a single moment of their existence; his or her own self-definition is\nof no significance to the banker who will deny him credit, or the policeman\nwho will arrest him for being in the wrong neighborhood, or the doctor who, in\nthe case of a damaged limb, will be more likely to recommend amputation. All\nattempts at individual or collective self-fashioning or self-invention have to\ntake place entirely within those extremely violent sets of constraints. (The\nonly real way that could change would be to transform the attitudes of those\nwho have the privilege of being defined as “White”—ultimately, probably, by\ndestroying the category of Whiteness itself.) The fact is though that nobody\nhas any idea how most people in North America would chose to define themselves\nif institutional racism were to actually vanish—if everyone really were left\nfree to define themselves however they wished. Neither is there much point in\nspeculating about it. The question is how to create a situation where we could\nfind out.\n\nThis is what I mean by “liberation in the imaginary.” To think about what it\nwould take to live in a world in which everyone really did have the power to\ndecide for themselves, individually and collectively, what sort of communities\nthey wished to belong to and what sort of identities they wanted to take\non—that’s really difficult. To bring about such a world would be almost\nunimaginably difficult. It would require changing almost everything. It also\nwould meet with stubborn, and ultimately violent, opposition from those who\nbenefit the most from existing arrangements. To instead write as if these\nidentities are already freely created—or largely so—is easy, and it lets one\nentirely off the hook for the intricate and intractable problems of the degree\nto which one’s own work is part of this very identity machine. But it no more\nmakes it true than talking about “late capitalism” will itself bring about\nindustrial collapse or further social revolution.\n\nAn illustration:\n\nIn case it’s not clear what I am saying here, let me return for a moment to\nthe Zapatista rebels of Chiapas, whose revolt on New Year’s day, 1994, might\nbe said to have kicked off what came to be known as the globalization\nmovement. The Zapatistas were overwhelmingly drawn from Tzeltal, Tzotzil and\nTojolobal Maya-speaking communities that had established themselves in the\nLacandon rain forest—some of the poorest and most exploited communities in\nMexico. The Zapatistas do not call themselves anarchists, quite, or even,\nquite autonomists; they represent their own unique strand within that broader\ntradition; indeed, they are trying to revolutionize revolutionary strategy\nitself by abandoning any notion of a vanguard party seizing control of the\nstate, but instead battling to create free enclaves that could serve as models\nfor autonomous self-government, allowing a general reorganization of Mexican\nsociety into a complex overlapping network of selfmanaging groups that could\nthen begin to discuss the reinvention of political society. There was,\napparently, some difference of opinion within the Zapatista movement itself\nover the forms of democratic practice they wished to promulgate. The Maya-\nspeaking base pushed strongly for a form of consensus process adopted from\ntheir own communal traditions, but reformulated to be more radically\negalitarian; some of the Spanish-speaking military leadership of the rebellion\nwere highly skeptical of whether this could really be applied on the national\nlevel. Ultimately, though, they had to defer to the vision of those they “led\nby obeying,” as the Zapatista saying went. But the remarkable thing was what\nhappened when news of this rebellion spread to the rest of the world. It’s\nhere we can really see the workings of Leve’s “identity machine.” Rather than\na band of rebels with a vision of radical democratic transformation, they were\nimmediately redefined as a band of Mayan Indians demanding indigenous\nautonomy. This is how the international media portrayed them; this is what was\nconsidered important about them from everyone from humanitarian organizations\nto Mexican bureaucrats to human rights monitors at the UN. As time went on,\nthe Zapatistas—whose strategy has from the beginning been dependent on gaining\nallies in the international community— were increasingly forced to play the\nindigenous card as well, except when dealing with their most committed allies.\n\nThis strategy has not been entirely ineffective. Ten years later, the\nZapatista Army of National Liberation is still there, without having hardly\nhad to fire a shot, if only because they have been willing, for the time\nbeing, to downplay the “National” part in their name. All I want to emphasize\nis exactly how patronizing—or, maybe let’s not pull punches here, how\ncompletely racist—the international reaction to the Zapatista rebellion has\nreally been. Because what the Zapatistas were proposing to do was exactly to\nbegin that difficult work that, I pointed out, so much of the rhetoric about\n“identity” effectively ignores: trying to work out what forms of organization,\nwhat forms of process and deliberation, would be required to create a world in\nwhich people and communities are actually free to determine for themselves\nwhat sort of people and communities they wish to be. And what were they told?\nEffectively, they were informed that, since they were Maya, they could not\npossibly have anything to say to the world about the processes through which\nidentity is constructed; or about the nature of political possibilities. As\nMayas, the only possible political statement they could make to non-Mayas\nwould be about their Maya identity itself. They could assert the right to\ncontinue to be Mayan. They could demand recognition as Mayan. But for a Maya\nto say something to the world that was not simply a comment on their own Maya-\nness would be inconceivable.\n\nAnd who was listening to what they really had to say?\n\nLargely, it seems, a collection of teenage anarchists in Europe and North\nAmerica, who soon began besieging the summits of the very global elite to whom\nanthropologists maintain such an uneasy, uncomfortable, alliance.\n\nBut the anarchists were right. I think anthropologists should make common\ncause with them. We have tools at our fingertips that could be of enormous\nimportance for human freedom. Let’s start taking some responsibility for it.\n\n",

E\ntorna­se da mesma forma evidente que o movimento revolucionário\nglobal no século XXI terá origens que remontam menos à tradição do\nmarxismo, ou mesmo do socialismo no sentido estrito, que à do anar­\nquismo. Em todo lugar, do Leste Europeu à Argentina, de Seattle a\nBombaim, as ideias e os princípios anarquistas geram novos sonhos e\nvisões radicais. Muitas vezes seus expoentes não se denominam\n\"anarquistas\". Existe uma série de outros nomes: autonomismo, anti­\nautoritarismo,\nhorizontalidade,\nzapatismo,\ndemocracia\ndireta...\nMesmo assim, estão sempre presentes os mesmos princípios funda­\nmentais: descentralização, associação voluntária, ajuda mútua, redes\nsociais e, sobretudo, rejeição a qualquer pensamento de que os fins\njustifiquem os meios e, mais ainda, de que o negócio do revolu­\ncionário seja tomar o poder do Estado e então começar a impor sua\nprópria visão à bala. Acima de tudo, o anarquismo, como uma ética\nde prática — a ideia de se construir uma nova sociedade \"dentro da\ncasca da antiga\" —, tornou­se a inspiração essencial do \"movimento\ndos movimentos\" (do qual os autores fazem parte), cujo propósito\ndesde o início é menos tomar o poder do Estado do que expor, desle­\ngitimar e desmantelar mecanismos de comando ao mesmo tempo em\nque conquista espaços cada vez maiores de autonomia e gestão par­\nticipativa dentro dele.\nHá algumas razões evidentes para o apelo das ideias anarquistas\nno início do século XXI: a mais óbvia, os fracassos e as catástrofes re­\nsultantes de tantos esforços para suplantar o capitalismo assumindo o\ncontrole do aparato governamental nos cem anos anteriores. Um\ncrescente número de revolucionários começou a reconhecer que \"a\nrevolução\" não virá na forma de um grande momento apocalíptico, a\ntomada de um equivalente global ao Palácio de Inverno, mas na de um\nprocesso muito longo que vem ocorrendo durante a maior parte da\nhistória humana (ainda que, como a maioria das coisas, venha se\nacelerando ultimamente), repleto de estratégias de fuga e evasão tanto\nquanto de confrontos dramáticos, que jamais irá — aliás, jamais deverá,\n",

Como formula o Co­\nletivo Crimethinc, os maiores propagandistas do anarquismo americano\ncontemporâneo: \"A liberdade só existe no momento da revolução. E\nesses momentos não são tão raros quanto você pensa.\" Para um anar­\nquista, na realidade, tentar criar experiências não alienadas, democra­\ncia verdadeira, é um imperativo ético; somente tornando sua forma de\norganização no presente ao menos uma vaga aproximação de como\numa sociedade livre realmente operaria, de como todos, um dia, deve­\nriam ser capazes de viver, se pode garantir que não caiamos de volta no\ndesastre. Revolucionários carrancudos que sacrificam todo o prazer\npela causa só podem gerar sociedades carrancudas.\nTem sido difícil documentar essas mudanças porque até agora as\nideias anarquistas não têm recebido quase nenhuma atenção no meio\nacadêmico. Ainda existem milhares de acadêmicos marxistas, mas\nquase nenhum acadêmico anarquista. É um tanto complicado inter­\npretar essa lacuna. Em parte, sem dúvida, ela se deve ao fato de o\nmarxismo sempre ter tido com a academia uma afinidade da qual o\nanarquismo nitidamente carecia: afinal, foi o único grande movi­\nmento social inventado por um ph.D. A maioria dos relatos sobre a\nhistória do anarquismo sugere que ela foi basicamente similar à do\nmarxismo: ele é apresentado como o fruto das ideias de certos pen­\n1. Isto não significa que os anarquistas devam ser contrários à teoria. Podem não precisar de\numa Alta Teoria, no sentido familiar hoje em dia. Decerto não precisarão de uma única Alta\nTeoria Anarquista. Isto seria completamente antagônico a seu espírito. Muito melhor,\nacreditamos, seria algo mais afeito ao espírito dos processos de tomada de decisão anarquistas:\naplicado à teoria, isso significaria aceitar a necessidade de uma diversidade de grandes\nperspectivas teóricas, unidas apenas por certos compromissos e noções compartilhados. Em vez\nde se basear na necessidade de provar que as ideias fundamentais dos outros estão erradas, a\nintenção é encontrar projetos específicos nos quais elas se reforcem entre si. O simples fato de\nteorias serem incomensuráveis em determinados aspectos não quer dizer que não possam existir\nou mesmo se reforçar entre si, bem como o fato de indivíduos terem visões de mundo diferentes\ne incomensuráveis não quer dizer que não possam se tornar amigos, amantes ou trabalhar em\nprojetos comuns. Mais do que de uma Grande Teoria, o anarquismo precisa é do que se poderia\nchamar de uma pequena teoria: uma forma de lidar com aquelas questões reais e imediatas que\nemergem de um projeto transformador.\n",

A analogia, na verdade, é forçada. Os \"fun­\ndadores\" do anarquismo não viam a si mesmos como inventores de\nalgo particularmente novo. Consideravam seus princípios básicos —\najuda mútua, associação voluntária, tomada de decisão igualitária —\ntão antigos quanto a própria humanidade. O mesmo vale para a re­\njeição ao Estado e a toda forma de violência estrutural, desigualdade\nou dominação (anarquismo significa literalmente \"sem governantes\")\n— mesmo a suposição de que todas essas formas estão de certo modo\nrelacionadas e reforçam umas às outras.\nNada disso era visto como uma doutrina incrivelmente nova, mas\ncomo uma tendência duradoura na história do pensamento humano,\nque não cabe em nenhuma teoria ideológica geral¹. Sob certo aspecto\né uma espécie de fé: uma crença em que a maioria das formas de ir­\nresponsabilidade que parecem tornar o poder necessário são na ver­\ndade os efeitos do próprio poder. Na prática, entretanto, é um\nquestionamento constante, um esforço para identificar toda relação\ncompulsória ou hierárquica na vida humana e desafiá­la a se justi­\nficar, e, caso ela não possa — o que geralmente vem a ser o caso —,\num esforço para limitar seu poder e assim ampliar o escopo da liber­\ndade humana. Assim como um sufi poderia dizer que o sufismo é o\ncerne da verdade por trás de todas as religiões, um anarquista pode­\nria argumentar que o anarquismo é a sede de liberdade por trás de\ntodas as ideologias políticas.\nEscolas marxistas sempre têm fundadores. Assim como o mar­\nxismo nasceu da mente de Marx, temos leninistas, maoistas, althusse­\nrianos...

Uma das principais inspirações da nova geração de anar­\nquistas são os municípios zapatistas autônomos de Chiapas, povoados\npor comunidades de línguas tzeltal ou tojolabal que usam o processo\nde consenso há milhares de anos — somente agora adotados por rev­\nolucionários para assegurar que mulheres e jovens tenham voz igual à\ndos homens adultos. Na América do Norte, o \"processo de consenso\"\nemergiu sobretudo do movimento feminista dos anos 70, como parte\nde uma ampla reação ao estilo machista de liderança típico da Nova\nEsquerda da décadaanterior. A ideia de consenso em si veio dos\nQuakers, que, por sua vez, alegam ter se inspirado nas Seis Nações e\nem outras práticas dos nativos americanos.\nO consenso muitas vezes é mal interpretado. Com frequência se\nouvem\ncríticos\nafirmarem\nque\nele\ncausaria\num\nconformismo\nparalisante, mas quase nunca são pessoas que de fato o tenham ob­\nservado em ação, pelo menos, na forma guiada por facilitadores\ntreinados e experientes (alguns experimentos recentes na Europa,\nonde há pouca tradição desse tipo de coisa, foram um tanto rudi­\nmentares). Na verdade, a suposição operante é que ninguém pode, e\nprovavelmente nem deve, de fato converter plenamente outro indiví­\nduo a seu próprio ponto de vista. Em vez disso, o objetivo do processo\nde consenso é permitir a um grupo optar por um curso comum de\nação. Em vez de se votarem propostas a todo momento, essas pro­\npostas são trabalhadas e retrabalhadas, eliminadas ou reinventadas, e\nhá um processo de concessão e síntese, até que se encontre uma\nsolução com a qual todos possam viver. Quando se chega ao estágio\nfinal, realmente \"encontrando­se o consenso\", há dois níveis de ob­\njeção possíveis: pode­se \"sairdo caminho\", o que significa dizer \"não\ngosto disso e não vou participar, mas não impediria ninguém de fazê­\nlo\", ou \"bloquear\", o que tem o efeito de um veto. Só se pode bloquear\ncaso se sinta que a proposta viola os princípios ou as razões de ser\nfundamentais do grupo.

Em vez disso, se familiariza\ncom diversos tipos de tecnologia e os emprega de acordo com sua\nconveniência. Não só não condena as instituições ou as formas políti­\ncas em si, mas procura conceber novas instituições e novas formas\npolíticas para o ativismo e para uma nova sociedade, incluindo novos\nmeios de reunião, de tomada de decisão e de coordenação, seguindo\nas mesmas direções que já segue com grupos de afinidade e estru­\nturas de porta­vozes revitalizados. E não só não condena reformas per\nse , como também luta para definir e alcançar reformas não reformis­\ntas, atentando para as necessidades imediatas das pessoas e melho­\nrando suas vidas no aqui e agora ao mesmo tempo em que ruma para\nconquistas maiores e, por fim, para a transformação integral7.\nÉ claro que a teoria precisará se acoplar à prática. Para ser plena­\nmente eficaz, o anarquismo moderno terá de incluir pelo menos três\ninstâncias: os ativistas, as organizações populares e os pesquisadores.\n8. Cf.

O Anarquismo no Século 21\nO problema no momento é que os intelectuaisanarquistas que dese­\njam superar hábitos ultrapassados e vanguardistas — os resquícios\nsectários marxistas que ainda assombram atantos no mundo intelec­\ntual radical — não estão muito certos de qual deve ser seu papel. O\nanarquismo precisa se tornar reflexivo.Mas como? Em um aspecto a\nresposta parece óbvia. Não se deve repreender, ditar, nem necessaria­\nmente ver a si mesmo como um professor, mas sim ouvir, explorar e\ndescobrir. Desvendar e tornar explícita a lógica tácita que já subjaz a\nnovas formas de prática radical.

Muitos estão começando a apontar que\numa das debilidades essenciais do movimento anarquista atual é, em\nrelação à época de, vamos dizer, Kropotkin ou Reclus, ou de Herbert\nRead, negligenciar o simbólico, o visionário, e ignorar a eficácia da\nteoria. Como passar da etnografia às visões utópicas — idealmente,\ntantas visões utópicas quanto possível? Não é coincidência o fato de\nalguns dos maiores recrutadores do anarquismo em países como os\nEstados Unidos terem sido escritoras de ficção científica feministas\ncomo Starhawk e Ursula K. LeGuin8.\nUma expressão do início desse processo é o fato de os anarquistas\nestarem começando a recuperar a experiência de outros movimentos\nsociais com um corpus teórico mais desenvolvido, ideias que vêm de\ncírculos próximos, na verdade inspirados pelo anarquismo. Tomemos\ncomo exemplo a ideia de economia participativa, que representa uma\nvisão econômica anarquista por excelência e que complementa e reti­\nfica a tradição econômica anarquista.

Como resultado,\neconomistas e outros que atuam nessa tradição vêm tentando criar\nmodelos de uma economia que sistematicamente eliminasse divisões\nentre o trabalho braçal e o intelectual. Agora que o anarquismo se\ntornou de forma tão clara o centro da criatividade revolucionária, os\ndefensores de tais modelos têm cada vez mais, se não levantado a\nbandeira, pelo menos ressaltado a compatibilidade entre suas ideias e\numa visão anarquista9.\nAlgo semelhante está começando a acontecer com o desenvolvi­\nmento de visões políticas anarquistas. Esta é uma área em que o\nanarquismo clássico já estava um passo à frente do marxismo clássico,\nque nunca desenvolveu uma teoria de organização política.\nDiferentes escolas anarquistas com frequência advogaram formas\nmuito específicas de organização social, embora muitas vezes com\nnotáveis variações. Ainda assim, o anarquismo como um todo tendeu\na adiantar o que os liberais gostam de chamar de \"liberdades negati­\nvas\", \"liberdades de\", em vez de sólidas \"liberdades para\". Muitas\nvezes celebrou esse mesmo compromisso como prova de seu plural­\nismo, sua tolerância ideológica ou sua criatividade. Como resultado,\nporém, houve uma relutância em ir além do desenvolvimento de for­\nmas de organização em pequena escala e uma fé em que estruturas\nmaiores e mais complexas possam ser improvisadas posteriormente\ncom o mesmo espírito.\nExceções existiram.

Acadêmicos antenados e\nhipsters intelectuais foram forçados a reciclar interminavelmente teo­\nrias que agora contam 20 ou 30 anos ou se voltar para países como a\nItália ou até a Eslovênia em busca de uma metateoria capaz de\nchamar a atenção.\nO pioneiro antropólogo francês Marcel Mauss estudou \"econo­\nmias da dádiva\", como as dos Kwakiutl da Colúmbia Britânica. Suas\nconclusões foram surpreendentes. Há uma série de razões para isto.\nUma está ligada à política da própria França, onde ocorreu um es­\nforço orquestrado por parte das elites midiáticas para substituir ver­\ndadeiros\nintelectuais\npor\nespecialistas\ncabeças­ocas\nde\nestilo\namericano. Contudo, o êxito não foi completo. Mais importante, a\nvida intelectual francesa tornou­se muito mais engajada politica­\nmente.

Na imprensa\namericana, a França imediatamente se tornou o país tolo, que tenta\nem vão mudar o rumo da história.\nÉ claro que este fato isolado dificilmente irá intimidar os leitores\namericanos de Deleuze e Guattari. O que os acadêmicos dos Estados\nUnidos esperam da França é um alto nível intelectual, a capacidade\nde sentir que se está fazendo parte de ideias radicais e selvagens —\ndemonstrando a violência inerente das concepções ocidentais de ver­\ndade e humanidade, ou algo do tipo —, mas de formas que não im­\npliquem\num\nprograma\nde\nação\npolítica,\nou,\nem\ngeral,\numa\nresponsabilidade de agir.

Entre eles está um grupo\nde intelectuais que carrega o pomposo nome de Mouvement Anti­\nUtilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales, ou MAUSS, e tem se dedicado a\num ataque sistemático às bases filosóficas da teoria econômica. O\ngrupo tira sua inspiração de Marcel Mauss, grande sociólogo francês\ndo início do século XX, cuja obra mais famosa, Ensaio sobre a dádiva\n(1925), foi talvez a mais magnífica refutação das ideias por trás da\nteoria econômica já escrita. Numa época em que o \"mercado livre\" é\nempurrado goela abaixo de todos como um produto tão autêntico\nquanto natural do ser humano, o trabalho de Mauss, que demonstrou\nnão apenas que a maioria das sociedades fora do Ocidente não adotava\nnada semelhante a princípios mercadológicos, mas também que tam­\npouco o faz a maioria dos ocidentais modernos, é mais relevante do\nque nunca. Enquanto os estudiosos americanos francófilos parecem in­\ncapazes de pensar em algo para dizer sobre a ascensão do neoliberal­\nismo global, o MAUSS está lhe atacando as próprias fundações.\nA título de retrospectiva: Marcel Mauss nasceu em 1872, em Vos­\nges, numa família judia ortodoxa. Seu tio, Émile Durkheim, é conside­\nrado o fundador da sociologia moderna. Vivia rodeado de um grupo\nde brilhantes e jovens acólitos, dentre os quais Mauss foi designado\npara estudar religião. O círculo, no entanto, foi aniquilado pela I\nGuerra Mundial; muitos morreram nas trincheiras, incluindo o filho\nde Durkheim, e ele próprio sucumbiu ao luto pouco tempo depois.\nMauss ficou para juntar os cacos.\nSegundo todos os relatos, porém, Mauss nunca foi levado to­\ntalmente a sério em seu papel de herdeiro necessário; homem de ex­\ntraordinária erudição (conhecia pelo menos uma dúzia de idiomas,\nincluindo sânscrito, maori e árabe clássico), ele ainda, de alguma\nforma, carecia da austeridade esperada de um grand professeur.

Passou a vida trabalhando em pelo menos cinco\nlivros diferentes (sobre oração, sobre nacionalismo, sobre as origens do\ndinheiro etc.), dos quais nunca terminou nenhum. Ainda assim, con­\nseguiu instruir uma nova geração de sociólogos e inventar a antropolo­\ngia francesa mais ou menos sozinho, bem como publicar uma série de\nensaios de extraordinário caráter inovador, dos quais praticamente\ncada um gerou por si só um novo corpus de teoria social.\nMauss foi também um socialista revolucionário. Desde seus dias\nde estudante colaborou de forma regular com a imprensa esquerdista\ne durante a maior parte da vida permaneceu um membro ativo do\nmovimento cooperativista francês. Fundou e durante muitos anos\najudou a dirigir uma cooperativa de consumidores em Paris, e com\nfrequência era enviado em missões para fazercontato com o movi­\nmento em outros países (motivo pelo viveu na Rússia após a revo­\nlução). Entretanto, não era marxista. Seu socialismo seguia mais a\ntradição de Robert Owen ou Pierre­Joseph Proudhon: ele considerava\nque comunistas e sociais­democratas incorriam no mesmo erro ao cr­\nerem que a sociedade podia ser transformada primordialmente pela\nação do governo.\nEm vez disso, o papel do governo, acreditava Mauss, era fornecer\na estrutura legal para um socialismo que tinha de ser construído do\nzero, mediante a criação de instituições alternativas. A revolução\nrussa, portanto, causou­lhe profunda ambivalência. Embora exultante\ncom a expectativa de um genuíno experimento socialista, Mauss sen­\ntiu­se ultrajado com o uso sistemático do terror pelos bolcheviques,\nsua supressão das instituições democráticas e, acima de tudo, sua\n\"doutrina cínica segundo a qual os fins justificam os meios\", o que,\nconcluiu ele, era justamente o cálculo amoral e racional do mercado,\nligeiramente invertido.\nO ensaio de Mauss acerca da \"dádiva\" foi, mais do que qualquer\noutra coisa, sua resposta aos eventos ocorridos na Rússia, em particular\na Nova Política Econômica de Lênin de 1921, que abandonou tentativas\nanteriores de abolir o comércio.

Era hora de\nefetivar os resultados da pesquisa histórica e etnográfica.\nAs conclusões de Mauss foram surpreendentes. Em primeiro lugar,\nquase tudo o que a \"ciência econômica\" tinha a dizer sobre o tema da\nhistória da economia revelou­se inteiramente inverídico. A crença uni­\nversal dos entusiastas do mercado livre, tanto à época como hoje, era\nque o motor essencial do ser humano é o desejo de maximizar os praz­\neres, os confortos e as possessões materiais (sua \"utilidade\") e que por­\ntanto todas as interações humanas importantes podem ser analisadas\nem termos mercadológicos. No princípio, segundo a versão oficial,\nhavia o escambo. As pessoas eram forçadas a obter o que queriam tro­\ncando diretamente um objeto por outro. Como isso era inconveniente,\nacabaram por inventar o dinheiro como meio universal de troca. A cri­\nação de tecnologias mais avançadas (crédito, sistema bancário, bolsas\nde valores) foi uma simples extensão lógica.\nO problema era que, como Mauss logo notou, não havia motivo\npara acreditar que uma sociedade baseada no escambo um dia hou­\nvesse existido. Em vez disso, o que os antropólogos estavam desco­\nbrindo eram sociedades em que a vida econômica se baseava em\nprincípios absolutamente diferentes, a maioria dos objetos vinha e\nvoltava como presentes e quase tudo o que chamaríamos de compor­\ntamento \"econômico\" era baseado em uma pretensão de generosidade\npura e uma recusa em calcular quem dera o que a quem. Tais \"econo­\nmias da dádiva\" podiam em certas ocasiões tornar­se altamente com­\npetitivas, mas quando isso ocorria era da maneira exatamente oposta\nà nossa: em vez de brigar para ver quem acumulava mais, os vence­\ndores eram aqueles que conseguiam doar mais. Em alguns casos\nnotórios, como o dos Kwakiutl da Colúmbia Britânica, isso podia levar\na dramáticas disputas de liberalidade, em que chefes ambiciosos ten­\ntavam superar uns aos outros distribuindo milhares de braceletes de\nprata, cobertores Hudson's Bay ou máquinas de costura Singer e até\nmesmo destruindo riquezas afundando famosas relíquias de família\nno mar, ou ainda incendiando enormes pilhas de riquezas e de­\n",

No entanto, como Mauss\ntambém indagou: até que ponto é estranho, na realidade? Não há\nalgo de esquisito na própria ideia de dar presentes, mesmo em nossa\nsociedade? Por que é que, quando recebemos um presente de um\namigo (uma bebida, um convite para jantar, um elogio), sentimo­nos\nde certa forma obrigados a retribuir à altura? Por que é que o desti­\nnatário de um ato de generosidade muitas vezes se sente um tanto\nreduzido se não puder fazê­lo? Estes não são exemplos de sentimen­\ntos humanos universais, que são de certo modo ignorados em nossa\nsociedade mas que em outras eram a própria base do sistema\neconômico? E não é a existência desses impulsos e padrões morais tão\ndiferentes, mesmo num sistema capitalista como o nosso, o ver­\ndadeiro fundamento do apelo das visões alternativas e das políticas\nsocialistas? Mauss decerto achava que sim.\nEm muitos aspectos sua análise trazia uma notável semelhança\ncom as teorias marxistas sobre a alienação e a reificação desenvolvidas\npor figuras como György Lukács por volta da mesma época. Em econo­\nmias da dádiva, argumentou Mauss, as trocas não têm as qualidades\nimpessoais do mercado capitalista: na verdade, mesmo quando objetos\nde grande valor trocam de mãos, o que realmente conta são as relações\nentre os participantes; trocar é fazer amizades, ou dirimir rivalidades\nou comprometimentos, e apenas incidentalmente movimentar bens de\nvalor. Como resultado, tudo ganha uma carga pessoal, mesmo a pro­\npriedade: em economias da dádiva, os objetos de riqueza mais famosos\n— heranças de família como colares, armas, mantos de pena — sempre\nparecem desenvolver personalidade própria.\nNuma economia de mercado ocorre o exato oposto. As transações\nsão vistas apenas como formas de pôr as mãos em objetos úteis; o\nideal é que as qualidades pessoais do comprador e do vendedor sejam\ntotalmente irrelevantes. Como consequência, tudo, mesmo as pessoas,\ncomeça a ser tratado como objeto também. (Considere desse ponto de\nvista a expressão \"bens e serviços\".) A principal diferença em relação\nao marxismo, contudo, é que ao passo que os marxistas de sua época\nainda insistiam em umdeterminismo econômico pragmático, Mauss\n",

A experiência russa convenceu­o de que o comércio não\npoderia ser simplesmente eliminado em uma sociedade moderna,\npelo menos \"no futuro próximo\", mas um éthos de mercado sim.\nO trabalho poderia ser cooperativado, uma seguridade social garan­\ntida e, de forma gradativa, um novo éthos criado de modo que a única\ndesculpa possível para o acúmulo de riqueza fosse a capacidade de doá­\nla inteiramente.

Eles\nhaviam acabado de encarar vários dias de uma conferência interdisci­\nplinar a respeito de dádivas e, após examinarem o material, perce­\nberam chocados que parecia não haver ocorrido a sequer um\nestudioso presente que uma motivação significativa para doar poderia\nser, digamos, generosidade, ou uma preocupação genuína com o bem­\nestar de outra pessoa. Na verdade, os estudiosos presentes na confer­\nência invariavelmente presumiram que \"dádivas\" não existem de fato:\ncave fundo o bastante qualquer ação humana e você sempre encon­\ntrará uma estratégia egoísta e calculista. Ainda mais bizarro, pre­\nsumiram que essa estratégia egoísta era sempre, necessariamente, o\nverdadeiro xis da questão, que era de certo modo mais real do que\nqualquer outra motivação na qual pudesse estar emaranhada.

A Roma Antiga ainda\npreservava algo do velho ideal de prodigalidade aristocrática: os\nmagnatas romanos construíam jardins e monumentos públicos e dis­\nputavam quem patrocinava os jogos mais magníficos. Porém, a gen­\nerosidade romana também era, de maneira bastante clara, feita para\nmagoar: um dos atos favoritos era espalhar ouro e joias diante das\nmassas para vê­las brigando na lama para retirá­los. Os primeiros\ncristãos, por razões óbvias, desenvolveram sua noção de caridade em\nreação direta a práticas tão repugnantes. A verdadeira caridade não\nera baseada num desejo de estabelecer superioridade, ou favor, ou em\nqualquer motivação egoísta que fosse. A ponto de se poder dizer que,\nse o doador tivesse recebido qualquer coisa fora do acordado, não se\ntratava de uma dádiva real.\nNo entanto, isto por sua vez levou a infindáveis problemas, posto\nque era muito difícil imaginar uma dádiva que não trouxesse algum\ntipo de benefício ao doador. Mesmo um ato inteiramente desinteres­\nsado renderia pontos perante Deus. Aí teve início o hábito de investi­\ngar em todo ato até que ponto se podia dizer que mascarava algum\negoísmo oculto e então presumir que esse egoísmo é o que realmente\nimporta. Vê­se a mesma atitude reproduzida com grande persistência\nna teoria social moderna. Economistas e teólogos cristãos concordam\nem que se há prazer em um ato de generosidade, ele é de certa forma\nmenos generoso. Eles só discordam em relação às implicações morais.\nPara contra­atacar essa lógica deveras perversa, Mauss ressaltou o\n\"prazer\" e a \"alegria\" de doar: em sociedades tradicionais, não se\nsupunha existir contradição alguma entre o que chamaríamos inter­\nesse próprio (uma expressão que, observou ele, sequer podia ser\ntraduzida para a maioria dos idiomas humanos) e preocupação com\nos outros; a própria essência da dádiva tradicional está no fato de ela\nestimular ambos ao mesmo tempo.\nEstes, enfim, eram os tipos de questões que inicialmente ocu­\nparam o pequeno grupo interdisciplinar de estudiosos franceses e\nfrancófonos (Caillé, Berthoud, Ahmet Insel, Serge Latouche, Pauline\n",

Na verdade, o grupo em si\ncomeçou como um jornal, chamado Revue du MAUSS, um jornal\nmuito pequeno, impresso nas coxas em papel de má qualidade, con­\ncebido por seus autores tanto como uma piada interna quanto como\num veículo de conhecimento sério, o carro­chefe de um vasto movi­\nmento internacional que não existia então. Caillé escrevia manifestos,\ne Insel punha no papel fantasias acerca de grandes convenções inter­\nnacionais antiutilitaristas do futuro. Artigos sobre economia alter­\nnavam­se com excertos de romancistas russos. Porém, de forma\ngradual, o movimento começou a se materializar. Em meados dos\nanos 90, o MAUSS já se tornara uma notável rede de estudiosos que\niam de sociólogos e antropólogos a economistas, historiadores e filó­\nsofos, da Europa, da África Setentrional e do Oriente Médio, cujas\nideias haviam passado a ser representadas em três jornais diferentes e\numa proeminente série de livros (todos em francês) respaldados por\nconferências anuais.\nDesde as greves de 1995 e a eleição de um governo socialista, a\nprópria obra de Mauss tem passado por um considerável revival na\nFrança, com a publicação de uma nova biografia e uma coletânea de\nseus textos políticos. Ao mesmo tempo, o grupo MAUSS em si tem se\ntornado cada vez mais explicitamente político. Em 1997, Caillé\nlançou um petardo intitulado\"30 teses para uma nova esquerda\", e o\ngrupo começou a dedicar suas conferências anuais a questões políti­\ncas específicas. Sua resposta às intermináveis reivindicações para que\na França adotasse o \"modelo americano\" e acabasse com seu Estado\nde bem­estar, por exemplo, foi começar a promulgar uma ideia\neconômica originalmente proposta pelo revolucionário americano\nTom Paine: a renda nacional garantida. O verdadeiro caminho para se\nreformar a política de bem­estar não é começar a retirar os benefícios so­\nciais, mas reestruturar toda a concepção do que um Estado deve a seus\ncidadãos. Descartemos o bem­estar e os programas de desemprego, dis­\nseram eles. Em vez disso, criemos um sistema em que todo cidadão\nfrancês tenha garantida a mesma renda inicial (digamos, $20.000, pagos\ndiretamente pelo governo), e o resto fique por conta dele.\nÉ difícil saber com exatidão o que pensar da esquerda maussiana,\n",

É provável que\nquase tudo que você ouviu seja bobagem. Muitos parecem crer que os\nanarquistas são partidários da violência, do caos e da destruição, que\nsão contra todas as formas de ordem e organização, ou que são niilis­\ntas enlouquecidos que só querem acabar com tudo. No entanto, nada\npoderia estar mais longe da verdade. Os anarquistas são apenas pes­\nsoas que acreditam que o ser humano é capaz de se comportar de\nmaneira razoável sem ter de ser forçado a tal. É uma ideia realmente\nmuito simples. Mas que os ricos e poderosos sempre acharam ex­\ntremamente perigosa.\nEm sua forma mais simples, as crenças anarquistas estão pau­\ntadas em duas concepções elementares. A primeira é a de que o ser\nhumano é, em circunstâncias normais, tão razoável e decente quanto\nlhe é permitido ser e pode organizar a si e a suas comunidades sem\nque seja preciso lhe dizerem como. A segunda é a de que o poder cor­\nrompe. Acima de tudo, o anarquismo é apenas uma questão de ter\ncoragem de assumir os simples princípios de decência comum se­\ngundo os quais todos vivemos e segui­los até suas conclusões lógicas.\nPor mais estranho que possa parecer, em aspectos mais importantes\nvocê provavelmente já é anarquista — apenas não se dá conta.\nComecemos com alguns exemplos da vida cotidiana.\nSe está numa fila para entrar num ônibus lotado, você espera\nsua vez e se abstém de ir abrindo caminho às cotoveladas mesmo\nna ausência da polícia?\nSe respondeu \"sim\", então você está acostumado a agir como um\nanarquista! O princípio mais básico do anarquismo é a auto­ organi­\nzação: a ideia de que o ser humano não precisa ser ameaçado de pro­\ncesso para ser capaz de chegar a um entendimento razoável com seu\nsemelhante ou de tratá­lo com dignidade e respeito.\nTodos acreditam poder se comportar de forma razoável. Se\nacham as leis e a polícia necessárias, é só porque não acreditam que\nos outros possam. Mas se você parar para pensar, todas essas pessoas\nnão têm exatamente a mesma opinião sobre você?

É tudo um círculo vicioso. Se a pessoa está acostumada a ser\ntratada como se suas opiniões não importassem, está propensa a se\ntornar raivosa e cínica, ou mesmo violenta — o que evidentemente\ntorna fácil para os que estão no poder dizer que suas opiniões não\nimportam. Havendo entendido que elas importam, sim, tanto quanto\nas de qualquer um, essa pessoa tende a se tornar notavelmente con­\nsciente.

Outro princípio básico do\nanarquismo é a associação voluntária. É uma simples questão de\naplicar valores democráticos à vida comum. A única diferença é que\nos anarquistas acreditam que deveria ser possível uma sociedade em\nque tudo pudesse ser organizado nessa direção, todos os grupos basea­\ndos no consenso livre de seus membros, e, portanto, que todos os mod­\nelos verticais, militares de organização, como exércitos, burocracias ou\ngrandes empresas, baseados em cadeias de comando, deixassem de ser\nnecessários. Talvez você não acredite que isso fosse possível. Ou talvez\nsim. Porém, toda vez que chega a um acordo por consenso, e não por\nameaças, toda vez que faz um trato voluntário com outra pessoa, chega\na um entendimento ou faz uma concessão levando devidamente em\nconsideração a situação ou as necessidades particulares do outro, você\nestá sendo anarquista — mesmo que não se dê conta.\nO anarquismo nada mais é que o modo como agimos quando so­\nmos livres para fazer o que bem quisermos e quando lidamos com\noutras pessoas igualmente livres — e portanto cientes da responsabil­\n",

Nenhum de nós sonhava, quando estávamos or­\nganizandoos protestos em Seattle em 1999 ou nas reuniões do FMI\nem Washington em 2000, que dentro de meros três ou quatro anos o\nprocedimento da OMC teria entrado em colapso, que as ideologias de\n\"comércio livre\" estariam quase inteiramente desacreditadas, que to­\ndos os acordos comerciais que nos atiraram — do MIA à Área de Livre\nComércio das Américas — teriam sido derrotados, o Banco Mundial\natingido em suas bases e o poder do FMI sobre a maior parte da popu­\nlação mundial de fato destruído. No entanto, foi precisamente o que\naconteceu. O destino do FMI em especial é assombroso. Outrora o ter­\nror do Hemisfério Sul, ele é, agora, um resquício destroçado de sua\nantiga essência, achacado e desacreditado, relegado a queimar suas\nreservas de ouro e a buscar desesperadamente uma nova missão global.\nEnquanto isso, a maior parte da \"dívida do terceiro mundo\" sim­\nplesmente desapareceu. Tudo isso foi resultado de um movimento que\nconseguiu mobilizar a resistência global de forma tão eficiente que a\nprincípio as instituições reinantes ficaram desacreditadas e, por fim,\naqueles que comandavam os governos na Ásia e em especial na\nAmérica Latina foram forçados por seus próprios povos a desafiar o\nsistema financeiro internacional.

Nada aterroriza tanto os\ngovernantes do mundo, e em particular os dos Estados Unidos,\nquanto o perigo de uma democracia feita pelo povo. Sempre que um\nmovimento democrático genuíno começa a emergir — especialmente\nse baseado nos princípios de desobediência civil e de ação direta —, a\nreação é a mesma: o governo faz concessões imediatas (certo, vocês\npodem ter o direito ao voto; nada de armas nucleares), depois\ncomeça a elevar as tensões militares no exterior. O movimento é en­\ntão forçado a se transformar em uma manifestação antiguerra, que,\nquase\ninvariavelmente,\né\norganizada\nde\nforma\nmuito\nmenos\ndemocrática. Assim, o movimento pelos direitos civis foi seguido pelo\nVietnã, o antinuclear por guerras por procuração em El Salvador e na\nNicarágua, e o da justiça global pela \"Guerra ao Terror\".\nNeste ponto, contudo, podemos enxergar essa \"guerra\" em seu\ncaráter verdadeiro: o esforço descontrolado e nitidamente malfadado\nde uma potência em declínio para tornar sua peculiar combinação de\nmáquinas de guerra burocráticas e capitalismo financeiro especulativo\nem uma condição global permanente. Se a arquitetura podre ruiu de\nmaneira abrupta no fim de 2008, isso se deveu pelo menos em parte\nao fato de que uma boa porção do trabalho já tinha sido feita por um\nmovimento que, em face do surto de repressão após o 11 de Setembro,\ncombinado à confusão acerca de como dar prosseguimento a seu impres­\nsionante sucesso inicial, parecera haver praticamente sumido de cena.\nÉ evidente que não sumiu de fato.\nEstamos claramente à beira de outro renascimento em massa da\nimaginação popular. Não deveria ser tão difícil. A maioria dos ele­\nmentos já está à disposição. O problema é que, nossas percepções\ntendo sido distorcidas por décadas de propaganda implacável, não\nsomos mais capazes de enxergá­los. Consideremos o termo \"comu­\nnismo\". Raras vezes uma palavra foi difamada de modo tão patente.\nO padrão, que aceitamos de forma mais ou menos impensada, é que\ncomunismo significa controle estatal da economia, e isto é um sonho\nutópico impossível porque a História mostrou que simplesmente \"não\nfunciona\".

Na verdade, porém, comunismo significa apenas\nqualquer situação em que agimos de acordo com o princípio do \"de\ncada qual, segundo sua capacidade; a cada qual, segundo suas neces­\nsidades\" — que é a forma como quase todos sempre agem se estão\ntrabalhando juntos para cumprir um objetivo. Se duas pessoas estão\nconsertando um cano e uma pede: \"Dê­me a chave\", a outra não irá\nresponder: \"E o que eu ganho com isso?\" (isto é, se elas de fato\nquerem o cano consertado). Isto vale mesmo no caso de as duas\nserem empregadas da Bechtel ou do Citigroup. Elas aplicam princí­\npios comunistas porque estes são a única alternativa que realmente\nfunciona. É pela mesma razão que cidades ou países inteiros se valem\nde alguma forma de comunismo cru após uma catástrofe natural ou\num colapso econômico (poderíamos dizer, nessas circunstâncias, que\nmercados e cadeias de comando hierárquicas são luxos com que eles\nnão podem arcar). Quanto mais criatividade for preciso, quanto mais\nfor necessário improvisar em uma dada tarefa, mais igualitária a\nforma de comunismo resultante está propensa a ser — é por isso que\nmesmo engenheiros da computação republicanos, ao tentarem criar\nnovas ideias para softwares, tendem a formar pequenos coletivos\ndemocráticos. Somente quando o trabalho se torna padronizado e\nmaçante — como em linhas de produção — é possível impor formas\nde comunismo mais autoritárias, até mesmo fascistas. O fato, no entanto, é\nque mesmo empresas privadas têm uma organização interna comunista.\nAssim, o comunismo já está aí. A questão é como torná­lo mais\ndemocrático. O capitalismo, por sua vez, é apenas um modo possível de\nadministrá­lo — e, está cada vez mais claro, um modo um tanto desas­\ntroso. É nítido que precisamos pensar em outro melhor — de preferência,\num que não nos deixe de maneira tão sistemática em pé de guerra.\nTudo isso torna muito mais fácil entender por que os capitalistas\nestão dispostos a despejar recursos tão extraordinários no maquinário\nda desesperança. O capitalismo não é apenas um sistema ineficiente\npara administrar o comunismo — ele tem uma notória tendência a\napresentar defeitos periodicamente.

A dívida é o meio mais eficiente já cri­\nado para tomar relação que são fundamentalmente baseadas na vio­\nlência e na desigualdade violenta e fazê­las parecer corretas e morais\na todos os envolvidos. Quando a artimanha deixa de funcionar, tudo\nexplode. Como agora. Está claro, a dívida mostrou­se o maior ponto\nfraco do sistema, o ponto em que ele escapa ao controle de qualquer\num. Ela também permite infinitas oportunidades de organização.\nAlguns falam em greve de devedores, ou cartel de devedores.\nPode ser — mas no mínimo podemos começar com um compro­\nmisso contra despejos: prometer, de bairro em bairro, apoiar uns aos\noutros caso algum de nós seja removido de seu lar. O poder não está\napenas no fato de que desafiar regimes de dívida é desafiar o próprio\nâmago do capitalismo — sua fundação moral, que agora se revela\numa coleção de promessas não cumpridas — mas no de que ao fazê­\nlo, estamos criando um novo regime. Afinal, uma dívida é apenas\nisso: uma promessa, e o mundo presente abunda em promessas que\nnão foram cumpridas. Podemos mencionar aqui a promessa feita a\nnós pelo Estado, de que se abandonássemos todo o direito de admin­\nistrar coletivamente nossos próprios assuntos, pelo menos rece­\nberíamos a segurança básica para nossas vidas.

Afora um punhado de\nminúsculos grupos sectários, é quase impossível encontrar intelectuais\nradicais que acreditem seriamente que seu papel deva ser determinar\na correta análise histórica da situação mundial, no intuito de liderar\nas massas na verdadeira direção revolucionária. No entanto (assim\ncomo ocorre com a ideia de progresso em si, com a qual esta tem ób­\nvia relação), parece muito mais fácil renunciar ao princípio do que se\nlivrar dos presentes hábitos de pensamento. Atitudes vanguardistas,\nou mesmo sectárias, arraigaram­se tão profundamente no radicalismo\nacadêmico que é difícil dizer o que significaria pensar fora delas.\nA densidade do problema realmente me atingiu quando tive o\nprimeiro contato com os modos consensuais de tomada de decisão\nempregados em movimentos políticos anarquistas e de inspiração\nanarquista na América do Norte, que, por sua vez, tinham muitas\nsemelhanças com o estilo de tomada de decisão política corrente onde\neu havia feito meu campo de pesquisa antropológica, na área rural de\nMadagascar. Há uma enorme variação nos diferentes estilos e formas\nde consenso, mas uma característica que quase todas as vertentes\nnorte­americanas têm em comum é o fato de se ordenarem em cons­\nciente oposição à maneira de organização e, especialmente, de debate\ntípica dos grupos marxistas sectários clássicos. Ao passo que estes in­\nvariavelmente se organizam em torno de algum mestre teórico, que\noferece uma abrangente análise da situação mundial e, muitas vezes,\nda História humana como um todo, mas muito pouca reflexão teórica\nacerca de questões mais imediatas de organização e prática, grupos de\ninspiração anarquista tendem a operar segundo a hipótese de que um\nindivíduo jamais pode, ou provavelmente nem deve, converter por\ncompleto outro a seu próprio ponto de vista; que estruturas de tomada\nde decisão são maneiras de administrar a diversidade; e, portanto, que\ndevemos nos concentrar em manter o processo igualitário e em pon­\nderar questões imediatas de ação no presente.\nUm dos princípios fundamentais do debate político, por exemplo,\n",

Em parte isto também emerge do estilo de debate que a\ntomada de decisão por consenso encoraja: enquanto o voto estimula a\nreduzir as posições dos oponentes a uma hostil caricatura, ou o que\nfor preciso para derrotá­los, um processo consensual é construído so­\nbre o princípio de conciliação e criatividade, em que as propostas são\nconstantemente alteradas até surgir uma com que todos possam ao\nmenos conviver. Dessa forma, incentiva­se sempre dar a melhor inter­\npretação possível aos argumentos alheios.\nTudo isso mexeu comigo porque me fez perceber como a prática\nintelectual comum — o tipo de coisa que fui treinado para fazer na\nUniversidade de Chicago, por exemplo — de fato lembra modos sec­\ntários de debate. Uma das coisas que mais me perturbaram em meus\nestudos lá foi precisamente a maneira como éramos estimulados a ler\nos argumentos de outros teóricos: se houvesse duas formas de ler\numa frase, uma das quais sugerisse que o autor tivesse um mínimo de\nbom senso e a outra que ele fosse um completo idiota, a tendência era\nsempre escolher a segunda. Algumas vezes me perguntei como isto\npodia se conciliar com a ideia de que a prática intelectual é, em al­\ngum nível elementar, um empreendimento comum na busca da ver­\ndade. O mesmo vale para outros hábitos intelectuais: por exemplo, a\nmontagem cuidadosa de listas de diferentes \"formas de se estar er­\nrado\" (em geral terminadas em \"ismo\", isto é, subjetivismo, em­\npirismo;\ntodos\nmuito\nparecidos\ncom\nseus\nparalelos\nsectários:\nreformismo, desviacionismo de esquerda, hegemonismo...) e a dis­\nposição para escutar pontos de vista divergentes dos próprios apenas\npara descobrir a que variedade de equívoco ligá­los. Combine­se isto\nà tendência de se tratarem divergências intelectuais (muitas vezes in­\nsignificantes) não só como símbolos de pertencimento a algum \"ismo\"\nimaginado, mas como grandes falhas morais, no mesmo patamar do\nracismo ou do imperialismo (e muitas vezes de fato partes deles), e\ntem­se uma reprodução quase exata da espécie de debate intelectual\ntípico das mais ridículas facções vanguardistas.\nAinda creio que a prevalência cada vez maior desses novos, e em\n",

Como\nfilosofia política, ele tem passado por uma verdadeira explosão nos\núltimos anos. Movimentos anarquistas ou de inspiração anarquista\nestão crescendo em todo lugar, e os princípios anarquistas — autono­\nmia, associação voluntária, auto­organização, ajuda mútua, democra­\ncia direta — tornaram­se a base de organização dentro e fora do\nmovimento da globalização. Como Barbara Epstein apontou recente­\nmente, pelo menos na Europa e nas Américas, ele já tomou em\ngrande medida o lugar que o marxismo tinha nos movimentos sociais\ndos anos 60: o de ideologia revolucionária central, fonte de ideias e\ninspiração; mesmo aqueles que não se consideram anarquistas sentem\nque têm de se posicionar em relação a ele. Ainda assim, quase não\nencontrou reflexo nodiscurso acadêmico. A maioria dos acadêmicos\nparece ter apenas uma vaga ideia do que é o anarquismo, ou de­\nsprezá­lo com os estereótipos mais grosseiros (\"organização anar­\nquista! Não é contraditório?\") Nos Estados Unidos — e não creio que\nseja muito diferente em outros locais — há milhares de acadêmicos\nmarxistas de uma vertente ou de outra, mas raros dispostos a se\ndeclarar abertamente anarquistas.\nNão acredito que isso se deva apenas ao atraso da academia. O\nmarxismo sempre teve com ela uma afinidade que o anarquismo ja­\nmais terá. Afinal, é invenção de um ph.D., e sempre houve algo em\nseu espírito que se enquadra no da academia. O anarquismo, por\noutro lado, nunca foi realmente inventado por ninguém. É verdade\nque os historiadores costumam tratá­lo como se houvesse sido, con­\nstruindo sua história como se ele fosse basicamente uma criatura de\nnatureza idêntica à do marxismo: gerada por pensadores específicos\ndo século XIX, talvez Godwin ou Stirner, mas definitivamente Proud­\n",

O fato, porém, é que a\nanalogia é um tanto forçada. Em primeiro lugar, os teóricos oitocen­\ntistas em geral creditados pela invenção do anarquismo não viam a si\nmesmos como inventores de algo particularmente novo. Os princípios\nanarquistas básicos — auto­organização, associação voluntária, ajuda\nmútua — são tão antigos quanto a humanidade. De maneira\nsemelhante, a rejeição ao Estado e a todas as formas de violência es­\ntrutural, desigualdade ou dominação (anarquismo significa literal­\nmente \"sem governantes\"), mesmo a suposição de que todas essas\nformas estão de certo modo relacionadas e reforçam umas às outras,\nestavam longe de ser uma doutrina incrivelmente nova na época.\nPodem­se encontrar provas de argumentos similares ao longo da\nHistória, apesar de existirem todas as razões para crer que tais\nopiniões eram as menos propensas a ser escritas. Estamos falando\nmenos de um corpus teórico que de uma atitude, ou talvez de uma fé:\numa rejeição a certos tipos de relação social, uma confiança em que\nalguns outros são muito melhores para se construir uma sociedade\ndecente ou humana, uma fé na possibilidade de fazê­lo.\nPortanto, só é preciso comparar as escolas históricas do marxismo\ne do anarquismo para ver que estamos lidando com duas coisas fun­\ndamentalmente diferentes. As primeiras têm autores. Assim como o\nmarxismo nasceu da cabeça de Marx, temos leninistas, maoistas, trot­\nskistas, gramscianos, althusserianos... Note que a lista começa com chefes\nde Estado e passa de forma gradativa, quase ininterrupta, para professores\nfranceses. Pierre Bordieu certa vez observou que, se o campo acadêmico é\num jogo que os estudiosos se empenham em dominar, você sabe que\nvenceu quando outros estudiosos começam a se perguntar como formar\num adjetivo com seu nome. Supostamente, é para preservar a chance de\nvitória que os intelectuais insistem, ao discutirem uns aos outros, em em­\npregar os mesmos tipos de teoria do grande homem histórica dos quais es­\ncarneceriam ao discutirem qualquer outro tópico: as ideias de Foucault,\ncomo as de Trótski, jamais são tratadas essencialmente como produtos de\ndeterminado meio intelectual ou algo surgido de conversas e discussões\nintermináveis em cafés, salas de aula, quartos, barbearias envolvendo mil­\n",

Por outro lado, o mesmo ocorreu com a ideia de uma\navant garde artística (\"avantgarde\" na verdade nada mais é que o\ntermo francês para vanguarda), e a relação entre as três poderia sug­\nerir algumas possibilidades inesperadas.\nO termo avant garde foi cunhado por Henri de Saint­Simon, pro­\nduto de uma série de ensaios escritos em seus últimos anos de vida.\nComo seu outrora secretário e discípulo (e mais tarde atroz rival) Au­\nguste Comte, ele escreveu na esteira da Revolução Francesa e indagou\nessencialmente o que dera errado: por que a transição de uma so­\nciedade católica medieval e feudal para uma democrática moderna e\nindustrializada parecia estar gerando tanta violência e turbulência\nsocial.

Já no fim da vida, cada um\nacabou criando sua própria religião: a de Saint­Simon chamou­se\n\"Novo Cristianismo\"; a de Comte, \"Novo Catolicismo\". Na primeira, os\nartistas exerceriam o papel de líderes espirituais definitivos; num\ndiálogo imaginário com um cientista, um artista explica que na\nfunção de imaginar possíveis futuros e inspirar o público, eles podem\ndesempenhar o papel de uma \" avant garde \", uma \"função ver­\ndadeiramente sacerdotal\", como ele diz. Em seu futuro ideal, os artis­\ntas incubariam as ideias que depois seriam passadas para que os\ncientistas e industrialistas as pusessem em prática. Saint­Simon talvez\ntenha sido também o primeiro a conceber a noção do desapareci­\nmento do Estado: tendo se tornado claro que as autoridades estavam\natuando pelo bem do povo, não precisariam de mais força para im­\npeli­lo a seguir suas recomendações do que um médico precisaria\npara impelir um paciente a seguir as suas. O governo se reduziria a\nno máximo algumas pequenas funções policiais.\nComte, é claro, é mais famoso como o fundador da sociologia.\nInventou o termo para descrever o que via como a disciplina mor ca­\npaz de ao mesmo tempo entender e direcionar a sociedade. Acabou\nadotando uma abordagem diferente e bem mais autoritária: propôs\nno fim a regulação e o controle de quase todos os aspectos da vida\nhumana segundo princípios científicos, com o papel de altos sacer­\ndotes (com efeito, a vanguarda, embora ele não tenha chegado a de­\nnominá­los assim) em seu Novo Catolicismo sendo desempenhado\npelos próprios sociólogos.\nTrata­se de uma oposição particularmente fascinante porque no\ninício do século XX os lugares foram invertidos. Em vez de a esquerda\nsansimonista procurar liderança em artistas enquanto a direita com­\ntiana se visse como científica, tínhamos líderes fascistas como Hitler e\nMussolini, que se consideravam grandes artistas que inspiravam as\nmassas e esculpiam a sociedade de acordo comsua grandiosa imagi­\nnação, e a vanguarda marxista, que reivindicava o papel científico.\nDe qualquer forma, os sansimonistas procuravam ativamente re­\ncrutar artistas para seus novos empreendimentos, salões e comu­\n",

Na verdade, o número de artistas do\nséculo XIX que simpatizavam com o anarquismo é impressionante,\nindo de Pissaro a Tolstói e Oscar Wilde, sem falar em quase todos os\ndo início do século XX que mais tarde se tornaram comunistas, de\nMalevich a Picasso. Em vez de uma vanguarda política apontando o\ncaminho para uma sociedade futura, os artistas radicais quase invari­\navelmente viam­se como exploradores de modos de vida novos e\nmenos alienados.

Ideologicamente, tinham mais ou menos a\nmesma propensão a ser defensoras da \"arte pela arte\" ou revolu­\ncionárias sociais. Teóricos atuais estão bastante divididos quanta à\nforma de avaliar sua importância em termos mais amplos. Pierre\nBourdieu, por exemplo, insistiu em que a promulgação da ideia de\n\"arte pela arte\", longe de ser despolitizante, deveria ser considerada\numa importante realização, assim como qualquer uma que con­\nseguisse estabelecer a autonomia de um campo particular do em­\npenho humano em relação à lógica do mercado. Colin Campbell, por\nsua vez, argumenta que na medida em que os boêmios eram de fato\numa avant garde , eram na realidade a vanguarda do próprio mer­\ncado, ou, mais precisamente, do consumismo: sua verdadeira função\nsocial, muito embora detestassem admiti­lo, era explorar novas for­\nmas de prazer ou território estético que pudessem ser mercantilizadas\nna geração seguinte (isto poderia ser chamado de versão de Tom\nFranks da História). Campbell também ecoa a sabedoria comum de\nque a boemia era quase exclusivamente habitada por filhos da bur­\nguesia, que haviam ­ pelo menos por algum tempo — rejeitado o\ndinheiro e os privilégios de suas famílias e que, se não morressem\n",

Eis uma alegação que tem sido\nrepetida com tanta frequência ao longo dos anos em relação a ativis­\ntas e revolucionários, que me deixa, no mínimo, imediatamente\ncauteloso: na verdade, tenho a forte suspeita de que os círculos\nboêmios emergiram do mesmo tipo de conjuntura social que a maio­\nria dos círculos ativistas atuais e, historicamente, que a maioria dos\npartidos revolucionários vanguardistas: uma espécie de encontro en­\ntre\ncertos\nelementos\nde\nclasses\nprofissionais\ndescendentemente\nmóveis (de maneira intencional), em ampla rejeição aos valores bur­\ngueses, e filhos da classe trabalhadora ascendentemente móveis.\nPorém, tais suspeitas só podem ser confirmadas mediante investi­\ngação histórica.\nNo século XIX, a ideia de vanguarda política era usada de\nmaneira muito abrangente e vaga para se referir a qualquer um que\nfosse visto como explorador da trilha para uma sociedade futura livre.\nPeriódicos radicais, por exemplo, muitas vezes denominavam­se \"a\nAvant Garde \". Foi Marx, no entanto, quem começou a mudá­la de\nforma significativa ao introduzir a noção de que o proletariado era a\nverdadeira classe revolucionária — ele não usou de fato o termo\n\"vanguarda\" em sua obra — por ser a mais oprimida, ou, em suas\npalavras, \"negada\" pelo capitalismo, e portanto a que menos tinha a\nperder com a abolição deste. Assim, Marx descartou a possibilidade\nde que enclaves menos alienados, fossem de artistas ou dos artesãos e\ndos produtores independentes que tendiam a formar a espinha dorsal\ndo anarquismo, tivessem algo importante a oferecer. Os resultados,\ntodos conhecemos. A ideia de um partido de vanguarda dedicado\ntanto a organizar como a fornecer um projeto intelectual para essa\nclasse mais oprimida escolhida como agente da História, mas também\na despertar a revolução pela disposição a empregar violência, foi\nprimeiro esboçada por Lênin em 1902, em Que Fazer?, e ecoou in­\nfinitamente, a ponto de, no fim dos anos 60, o SDS acabar se envol­\nvendo em furiosos debates sobre se o Partido dos Panteras Negras\ndeveria ser considerado a vanguarda do movimento, como líder de\nseu elemento mais oprimido.

Na verdade, eu sugeriria, coalizões revolucionárias sempre ten­\ndem a consistir numa aliança entre os menos alienados e os mais\noprimidos de uma sociedade.

Devemos nos lembrar de que na virada do\nséculo XX, quando a maioria dos partidos marxistas estava se tor­\nnando social­democrata reformista, o anarquismo e o anarcossindi­\ncalismo eram o centro da esquerda revolucionária17. A situação só\nmudou realmente com a 1ª Guerra Mundial e a Revolução Russa.

As aventuras coloniais eram uma constante, mas uma guerra\nentre a França e a Inglaterra, em solo francês ou inglês, soava tão im­\npensável quanto hoje. Por volta de 1900, mesmo o uso de passaportes\nera considerado um barbarismo antiquado. O \"curto século XX\" foi, em\ncontraste, provavelmente o mais violento da História humana, quase\ninteiramente preocupado em travar guerras mundiais ou se preparar\npara elas.

Somente os porta­vozes podem atuar no pro­\ncesso real de buscar o consenso no conselho, mas antes das grandes\ndecisões eles voltam a se dividir em grupos de afinidade e cada um\nchega a um consenso quanto à posição que deseja que o porta­ voz\ntome (não é tão desordenado quanto possa parecer). Subgrupos, por\noutro lado, ocorrem quando um grande encontro se divide tempo­\nrariamente em outros menores que se concentrarão em tomar de­\ncisões ou gerar propostas, que em seguida podem ser submetidas à\naprovação de todo o grupo quando este se reunir.

Como resultado, quando todo o impacto de nossa vitória ini­\ncial se torna claro, geralmente estamos ocupados demais sentindo­nos\nfracassados para sequer notá­lo.\nVou analisar os dois exemplos mais proeminentes caso a caso:\nI. O movimento antinuclear\nO movimento antinuclear do fim dos anos 70 marcou a primeira\naparição, na América do Norte, do que hoje consideramos táticase for­\nmas de organização padrão do anarquismo: ações em massa, grupos de\nafinidade, conselhos de porta­vozes, processo de consenso, solidariedade\ncarcerária, o próprio princípio de democracia direta descentralizada. Era\ntudo um tanto primitivo, em comparação com o que temos agora, e\nhavia diferenças significativas — notavelmente uma concepção muito\nmais estrita, de estilo gandhista, de não violência —, mas todos os ele­\nmentos estavam presentes e foi a primeira vez que vieram juntos no\nmesmo pacote. Durante dois anos, o movimento cresceu de forma ver­\ntiginosa e deu todos os sinais de se tornar um fenômeno de proporção\nnacional. Depois, quase tão rápido quanto, desintegrou­se.\n",

Em 1976, uniram­se a outros ativistas da\nregião, inspirados pelo sucesso da ocupação de um ano de uma usina\nna Alemanha, para criar a Clamshell Alliance. Seu objetivo imediato\nera interromper a construção de uma usina nuclear proposta em\nSeabrook, New Hampshire. Embora a aliança nunca tenha conseguido\numa ocupação, como conseguiu uma série de dramáticas prisões em\nmassa, combinada à solidariedade carcerária, suas ações — que en­\nvolveram, no auge, dezenas de milhares de pessoas organizadas em\nlinhas diretamente democráticas — conseguiram colocar a própria\nideia da energia nuclear em questão de forma nunca antes vista.\nCoalizões semelhantes começaram a brotar através do país: a aliança\nPalmetto, na Carolina do Sul; a Oystershell, em Maryland; a Sun­\nflower, no Kansas; e a mais famosa de todas, a Abalone Alliance, na\nCalifórnia, que originalmente reagiu a um plano completamente in­\nsano de construir umaAs três primeiras ações em massa da Clamshell,\nem 1976 e 1977, foram amplamente bem­sucedidas. Porém, a aliança\nlogo entrou em crise por questões relativas ao processo democrático.\nEm maio de 1978, um recém­criado Comitê Coordenador violou o\nprocesso para aceitar uma oferta de última hora do governo de uma\nmanifestação legal de três dias em Seabrook no lugar de uma quarta\nocupação planejada (a desculpa foi a relutância em desagradar à co­\nmunidade local). Tiveram início acrimoniosos debates acerca de con­\nsenso e relações comunitárias, que depois se estenderam para o papel\nda não violência (mesmo atravessar cercas, ou medidas defensivas\ncomo máscaras de gás, haviam sido originalmente proibidas), à dis­\ncriminação de gênero e assim por diante. Em 1979, a aliança havia se\ndividido em duas facções adversárias e cada vez mais ineficazes, e,\napós diversos atrasos, a usina de Seabrook (ou pelo menos metade\ndela) entrou em operação. A Abalone Alliance durou mais, até 1985,\nem parte devido a seu forte núcleo de anarco­feministas, mas no fim\nDiablo Canyon também adquiriu sua licença e entrou em operação\nem dezembro de 1988.\n",

Objetivos de médio prazo: bloquear a construção de toda nova\nusina nuclear, deslegitimar a própria ideia de energia nuclear e\ncomeçar a caminhar rumo à conservação e à energia verde e legitimar\nnovas formas de resistência não violenta e democracia direta de in­\nspiração feminista;\n3. Objetivos de longo prazo: (pelo menos para os elementos mais\nradicais) esmagar o Estado e destruir o capitalismo.\nAssim sendo, os resultados são claros. Os objetivos de curto prazo\nquase nunca foram atingidos.

As\nações de fato deslegitimaram a própria ideia da energia nuclear —\nelevando a consciência pública ao ponto de o derretimento de Three\nMile Island, em 1979, ter condenado a indústria para sempre. Embora\nos planos para Seabrook e Diablo Canyon possam não ter sido cance­\nlados, praticamente todos os outros então pendentes de construir um\nreator nuclear o foram, e nenhum outro foi proposto em um quarto\nde século. Houve de fato um direcionamento maior à conservação, à\nenergia verde, e uma legitimação de novas técnicas democráticas de\norganização. Tudo isso aconteceu muito mais rápido do que qualquer\num havia imaginado.\nEm retrospecto, é fácil observar que a maioria dos problemas\nsubsequentes foi produto direto da própria velocidade do sucesso do\nmovimento.

Todos sabem que ante uma coalizão am­\npla e potencialmente revolucionária, a primeira atitude de qualquer\ngoverno é tentar rachá­la. Fazer concessões para aplacar os modera­\ndos e ao mesmo tempo criminalizar os radicais — é o bê­á­bá da arte\nde governar.

Outras cidades (Montreal, Washington) criaram Con­\nvergências Anticapitalistas ainda mais explicitamente anarquistas. As\nDANs anticorporativistas dissolveram­se quase de imediato, mas\nmuito poucas duraram mais do que alguns anos. Houve intermináveis\ne intensos debates: sobre não violência, sobre manifestações em re­\nuniões de cúpula, sobre questões relativas a racismo e privilégios, so­\nbre a viabilidade do modelo de rede. Então vieram o 11 de Setembro,\nseguido de um enorme crescimento do nível de repressão e resultante\nparanoia, e a fuga desesperada de quase todos nossos antigos aliados\nentre sindicatos e ONGs. Já em Miami, em 2003, parecia que\nhavíamos sido jogados à lona, e o movimento foi dominado por uma\nparalisia da qual apenas recentemente começamos a nos recuperar.\nO 11 de Setembro foi um evento tão estranho, uma catástrofe tão\ngrande, que torna quase impossível percebermos qualquer outra coisa ao\nredor. Como consequência imediata, quase todas as estruturas criadas no\nmovimento de globalização ruíram. Porém, uma razão pela qual isso foi\ntão fácil foi não apenas que a guerra parecia uma preocupação muito\nmais premente, mas também que, mais uma vez, na maioria de nossos\nobjetivos imediatos, já tínhamos, inesperadamente, vencido.\nDe minha parte, comecei a participar da DAN de Nova York bem\n",

Era seu trabalho\ngarantir que país algum (independente do nível de pobreza) jamais\ntivesse direito à moratória em empréstimos de banqueiros ocidentais\n(independente do nível de estupidez).\nMesmo que um banqueiro oferecesse a um ditador corrupto um\nempréstimo de 1 bilhão de dólares, e esse ditador o depositasse dire­\ntamente em sua conta na Suíça e deixasse o país, o FMI asseguraria\nque 1 bilhão de dólares (mais generosos juros) fossem tirados de suas\nantigas vítimas. Se um país de fato declarasse moratória, por qual­\nquer razão, o FMI podia impor um boicote de crédito cujos efeitos\neconômicos eram mais ou menos comparáveis aos de uma bomba nu­\nclear (tudo isso vai de encontro mesmo à teoria econômica elementar,\nsegundo a qual aqueles que emprestam dinheiro devem aceitar um\ncerto grau de risco, mas, no mundo da política internacional, as leis\neconômicas só são utilizadas para atar as mãos dos pobres.) Esse pa­\npel foi sua derrocada.\nO que aconteceu foi que a Argentina declarou a moratória e se\nsafou.

Por outro lado, atualmente o\nBanco é mantido vivo em grande parte pelo fato de Índia e China\nainda estarem dispostas a lidar com ele, e as duas partes sabem disso,\nportanto ele não está mais em grandes condições de ditar regras.\nObviamente, isso tudo não significa que todos os monstros ten­\nham sido aniquilados. Na América Latina, o neoliberalismo pode estar\nem retirada, mas a China e a Índia estavam executando \"reformas\"\ndevastadoras dentro de seus próprios territórios; as proteções sociais\nna Europa estão sob ataque; e a maior parte da África, a despeito de\nmuito exibicionismo hipócrita da parte dos Bonos e dos países ricos\ndo mundo, ainda está afundada em dívidas, e agora também enfrenta\numa nova colonização pela China.\nOs EUA, com seu poderio econômico retrocedendo na maior\nparte do mundo, estão tentando freneticamente redobrar seu domínio\nsobre o México e a América Central. Não estamos vivendo numa\nutopia. Mas já sabíamos disso. A questão é por que nunca percebemos\nnossas vitórias.\nOlivier de Marcellus, um ativista suíço da AGP, aponta para uma\nrazão: sempre que algum elemento do sistema capitalista respira, seja\na indústria nuclear ou o FMI, algum periódico esquerdista começa a\nnos explicar que, de fato, é tudo parte do plano deles —ou, quem\nsabe, um efeito do inexorável desenrolar das contradições internas do\ncapital, mas, sem dúvida, nada pelo qual nós mesmos sejamos de\nforma alguma responsáveis. Mais importante ainda, talvez, seja nossa\nrelutância em sequer pronunciar a palavra \"nós\". A moratória ar­\ngentina, ela não foi realmente engendrada por Néstor Kirchner? O\nque ele tem a ver com o movimento de globalização?

Como \"nós\" podemos assumir a responsabilidade por\nsuas ações? Esqueçam que a maioria deles se via como parte do\nmesmo movimento pela justiça global que nós, defendia ideias semel­\nhantes, vestia roupas semelhantes, utilizava táticas semelhantes, em\nmuitos casos até pertencia às mesmas confederações e organizações.\nDizer \"nós\" aqui sugeriria o pecado original de falar pelos outros.\nDe minha parte, creio ser razoável um movimento global consid­\nerar suas realizações em termos globais. Elas não são inconsideráveis.\nPorém, assim como ocorreu com o movimento antinuclear, estavam\nquase todas focadas no meio­termo.\nPermitam­me mapear uma hierarquia de objetivos semelhante à\nanterior:\n1. Objetivos de curto prazo: interromper e encerrar reuniões de\ncúpula específicas (FMI, OMC, G8 etc.);\n2. Objetivos de médio prazo: destruir o \"Consenso de Washington\"\nacerca do neoliberalismo, bloquear todos os novos pactos comerciais,\ndeslegitimar e por fim acabar com instituições como a OMC, o FMI e o\nBanco Mundial; disseminar novos modelos de democracia direta;\n3. Objetivos de longo prazo: (pelo menos para os elementos mais\nradicais) esmagar o Estado e destruir o capitalismo.\nMais uma vez, encontramos o mesmo padrão. Após o milagre de\nSeattle, objetivos de curto prazo — táticos — raras vezes foram\natingidos. No entanto, isso se deveu principalmente ao fato de que,\ndiante de tal movimento, os governos tendem a bater o pé e tornar\numa questão de princípio evitar que eles o sejam. Isto em geral era\nconsiderado muito mais importante, na verdade, do que o sucesso da\nreunião de cúpula em questão. A maioria dos ativistas parece não se\ndar conta de que em inúmeros casos — as reuniões de 2001 e 2002\ndo FMI e do Banco Mundial, por exemplo — a polícia acabou re­\nforçando esquemas de segurança tão elaborados que chegou muito\nperto de ela mesma dar fim às reuniões, fazendo com que muitos\neventos fossem cancelados, as cerimônias fossem arruinadas e\nninguém tivesse chance de se falar.

A questão era que os mani­\nfestantes não tinham perspectiva de vitória.\nAí, também, os objetivos de médio prazo foram atingidos de forma\ntão rápida que na verdade os de longo prazo se tornaram mais difíceis.\nONGs, sindicatos, marxistas autoritários e aliados similares aban­\ndonaram o barco quase imediatamente. Debates estratégicos vieram\nem seguida, mas foram realizados, como sempre, de maneira indireta,\ncomo discussões acerca de raça, privilégios, tática, como quase tudo,\nexceto como debates estratégicos. Outra vez, tudo se tornou infinita­\nmente mais difícil devido ao recurso do Estado à guerra.\nÉ duro, como mencionei, para os anarquistas assumir muita res­\nponsabilidade direta pelo inevitável fim da guerra no Iraque, ou\nmesmo pelo duro golpe que o império já recebeu lá. No entanto pode­\nse muito bem levar em consideração a responsabilidade indireta.\nDesde os anos 60, e a catástrofe no Vietnã, o governo americano não\nabandonou sua política de responder a qualquer ameaça de mobiliza­\nção democrática em massa com um retorno à guerra. Mas isso requer\nmuito mais cuidado. Em essência, eles têm de engendrar guerras que\nsejam à prova de protestos. Existem ótimas razões para crer que a\nprimeira Guerra do Golfo foi explicitamente engendrada com isso em\nmente. A abordagem utilizada na invasão ao Iraque — a insistência\nem um exército menor e de alta tecnologia, o extremo apoio no poder\nde fogo indiscriminado, mesmo contra civis, para se proteger de\nníveis de baixas americanas semelhantes aos do Vietnã — parece ter\nsido desenvolvida, novamente, mais com a intenção de evitar qual­\nquer potencial movimento de paz dentro de casa do que com foco na\nefetividade militar. Isto, de qualquer forma, ajudaria a explicar por\nque o exército mais poderoso do mundo acabou amarrado e mesmo\nderrotado por um grupo quase inimaginavelmente heterogêneo de\nguerrilheiros com acesso insignificante a zonas de segurança, finan­\nciamentos ou apoio militar externos. Como nas cúpulas de comércio,\neles estão tão obcecados em fazer com que as forças de resistência\ncivil não tenham perspectiva de vencer a batalha doméstica que\nprefeririam perder a verdadeira guerra.\n",

Ainda assim, algumas implicações são bastante nítidas.\nNa próxima vez em que planejarmos uma grande campanha de ação,\ncreioque faremos bem em pelo menos levar em conta a possibilidade\nde alcançarmos nossos objetivos estratégicos de médio prazo com\nmuita rapidez e de, quando isso acontecer, muitos de nossos aliados\ndebandarem. Temos de reconhecer debates estratégicos pelo que são,\nmesmo quando parecem ser outra coisa. Tomemos um exemplo\nfamoso: discussões acerca de destruição de propriedades após Seattle.\nA maioria delas, creio eu, foram na verdade discussões acerca do cap­\nitalismo. Aqueles que censuraram a quebra de janelas o fizeram prin­\ncipalmente porque desejavam apelar aos consumidores da classe\nmédia para que aderissem à modalidade de intercâmbio global do\nconsumismo verde, que se aliassem a burocracias trabalhistas e soci­\nais­democratas no exterior. Não foi uma trilha projetada para criar\num confronto direto com o capitalismo, e a maioria daqueles que nos\ninstaram a tomar essa rota estavam no mínimo céticos quanto à pos­\nsibilidade de um dia o capitalismo ser realmente derrotado. Aqueles\nque quebraram janelas não queriam saber se estavam ofendendo os\nproprietários suburbanos, pois não os viam como um elemento po­\ntencial em uma coalizão anticapitalista revolucionária. Estavam ten­\ntando, na prática, sequestrar a mídia para enviar a mensagem de que\no sistema era vulnerável — na esperança de inspirar atos insur­\nrecionais da parte daqueles que pudessem estar considerando entrar\npara uma aliança genuinamente revolucionária: adolescentes alien­\nados, pessoas de cor oprimidas, trabalhadores comuns impacientes\ncom os burocratas sindicalistas, os desabrigados, os criminalizados, os\nradicalmente descontentes. Se um movimento anticapitalista mili­\ntante fosse ter início, na América, teria de começar com membros as­\nsim: pessoas que não precisam ser convencidas de que o sistema está\ncorroído, apenas de que existe algo que possam fazer.

O que significaria con­\nquistar não apenas nossos objetivos de médio prazo, mas também os\nde longo prazo? No momento não está muito claro para ninguém\ncomo isso poderia acontecer, pela simples razão de que nenhum de\nnós tem muita fé remanescente \"na\" revolução, no antigo sentido\ndado ao termo nos séculos XIX e XX. Afinal, a visão total de uma\nrevolução, de que haverá uma única insurreição em massa ou greve\ngeral e então todos os muros ruirão, é inteiramente baseada na velha\nfantasia de dominar o Estado. Esta seria a única maneira possível de a\nvitória ser tão absoluta e completa — pelo menos se estivermos fa­\nlando de um país inteiro ou de um território significativo.\nÀ guisa de ilustração, consideremos: o que haveria realmente sig­\nnificado para os anarquistas espanhóis ter \"vencido\" em 1937? É im­\npressionante quão raro nos fazemos perguntas como essa. Apenas\nimaginamos que teria sido algo como a Revolução Russa, que\ncomeçou de modo semelhante, com a dissolução do antigo exército, a\ncriação espontânea de sovietes. Mas isso foi nas grandes cidades. A\nRevolução foi seguida de anos de guerra civil na qual o Exército Ver­\nmelho gradualmente impôs o controle do novo Estado a cada parte\ndo Império Russo, quisessem ou não as comunidades em questão.\nImaginemos que as milícias anarquistas na Espanha tivessem derro­\ntado o exército fascista, e então desfeito completamente e expulsado\no Governo Republicano socialista de seus gabinetes em Barcelona e\nMadri. Decerto teria sido uma vitória aos olhos de qualquer um.\nPorém, o que teria acontecido em seguida? Haveriam eles transfor­\nmado a Espanha em uma não república, um anti­estado estabelecido\nexatamente dentro das mesmas fronteiras internacionais? Haveriam\nimposto um regime de conselhos populares em cada vila e município\nno território do que outrora fora a Espanha? Como, exatamente?

Em alguns, praticamente\ntoda a população era formada por católicos ou monarquistas conser­\nvadores; em outros (digamos, no País Basco), havia uma classe tra­\nbalhadora militante e bem­organizada, porém esmagadoramente\nsocialista ou comunista. Mesmo no auge do fervor revolucionário, a\nmaioria deles continuaria fiel a seus antigos valores e ideias. Se a FAI\nvitoriosa tentasse exterminar a todos — uma tarefa que teria exigido\nmatar milhões de pessoas —, expulsá­ los do país, realocá­los à força\nem comunidades anarquistas ou mandá­los para campos de reedu­\ncação, seria não só culpada de atrocidades de nível mundial, mas\ntambém teria de deixar de ser anarquista.

Declarar que todos deveriam formar suas próprias assembleias\npopulares locais e permitir­lhes decidir seu próprio modo de auto­or­\nganização.\nA segunda parece a mais ajustada aos princípios anarquistas, mas\nos resultados provavelmente não teriam sido muito diferentes.Afinal,\nse os habitantes de Bilbao, digamos, tivessem um ardente desejo de\ncriar um governo local, como exatamente alguém os teria impedido?\nMunicípios onde a Igreja ou proprietários de terras ainda tivessem\napoio popular presumivelmente colocariam as mesmas velhas autori­\ndades direitistas no poder; municípios socialistas ou comunistas po­\n",

Os governos estrangeiros reconhece­\nriam uma ou a outra — já que ninguém estaria disposto a trocar em­\nbaixadores com um não governo como a FAI, mesmo supondo que\nesta o desejasse, o que não seria o caso. Em outras palavras, a guerra\narmada poderia terminar, mas a luta política continuaria, e grandes\npartes da Espanha presumivelmente acabariam parecendo­se com a\nChiapas contemporânea, com cada distrito ou comunidade dividido\nem facções anarquista e anti­anarquista.

It’s an interesting question because it wasn’t my idea to \ncombine them all in the same volume to begin with. Actually, \nthe collection first came out in Greek, with the title Κίνημα, βία, \nτέχνη και επανάσταση (Movement, Violence, Art and Revolution. \nAthens: Black Pepper Press, 2009), and they were assembled by \ntheir editor, and translator, Spyros Koyroyklis. When I first saw \nthe volume on a visit to Greece in May of 2010 I thought the idea \nfor the collection was inspired; it made a sort of intuitive sense \nto me; as did it, I was soon given to understand, to many in the \nmovement in Greece itself, where many of the arguments found \nwithin were taken up by various anarchists, anti-authoritarians, \nand activists in the wake of the economic crisis and confusion that \nfollowed the heady days of December 2009. \nSo what is the unifying theme? \nIt’s helpful, perhaps, to consider the context in which these es-\nsays were originally written. All of these essays were composed \nbetween 2004 and 2010. This was not an easy time for some-\none, like myself, actively engaged in social movements. Between \nroughly 1998 and 2002, the advent of the global justice movement \nhad given all of us a sudden sense of almost endless possibility. \n",

For many it was \nimpossible to maintain the sense of enthusiasm that had kept us \nso alive in the years before; many burned out, gave up, emigrated, \nbickered, killed themselves, applied to graduate school, or with-\ndrew into various other sorts of morbid desperation. For me, the \npoint where I came closest to despair was in the immediate wake \nof the 2004 US elections, when the originally stolen presidency of \nGeorge W. Bush was actually given what seemed like a genuine \npopular mandate. At first, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, it \nseemed that we were looking at a repeat of something rather like \nWorld War I: the period from roughly 1880 to 1914 was after all \nquite similar to the decade and a piece that followed the fall of \nthe Berlin War: a time where wars between major powers seemed \nto be a thing of the past, where the dominant powers embraced \nan ethos of free trade and free markets, of frenetic capital accu-\nmulation, but at the same time, an age of the rapid rise of global \nanticapitalist movements, accompanied by an ethos of revolution-\nary internationalism in which the anarchist movement seemed to \ndefine the vital center of the radical left. The rulers of the world \nultimately panicked, and reacted by initiating a near-century of \nworld war, allowing appeals to nationalism, state security, racism \nand jingoism of every kind of tear those (to it) terrifying alliances \napart. It struck me, after 9/11, that they were trying the same trick \nagain; it was as if, faced with even the prospect of an effective an-\nticapitalist movement emerging globally, they immediately pulled \nout the biggest gun they had – a declaration of permanent global \nwar mobilization – despite the fact that the enemy they had cho-\nsen, rag-tag band of Islamists who had, effectively, got extraordi-\nnarily lucky, pulling off one of the first mad terrorist schemes in \nhistory that had actually worked, and were clearly never going to \nrepeat the performance – could not possibly provide an adequate \nlong-term excuse. It was never going to work. Yet somehow, the \nAmerican public had passed a referendum on the project. What’s \nmore, I watched in dismay how every attempt to revive an inter-\nnational spirit resistance – around the G8, then G20, the Climate \nConferences – seemed to founder, or at least, reach a series of \nlimited tactic victories that always seemed to hold out the promise \nof translating into a new burst of energy and of longer-term move-\nment building (“finally,” we kept telling each other, “we’re over the \nhump!”), but which, in reality, never really did.

They were less concerned to save the system, than \nto ensure that there remained no plausible alternative in anyone’s \nmind so that, when the moment of collapse did come, they would \nbe the only one’s offering solutions. Not that since the great finan-\ncial collapse of 2008, solutions have been particularly forthcom-\ning. But at least there is no way to deny now that a fundamental \nproblem does exist. The order that existed between 2004 and 2008 \n– even if it has managed to achieve a kind of grudging acquies-\ncence in critical quarters of the world – is never coming back.

If there \nis a single theme in this collection of essays, then, it is that they all \nstart out from some aspect of the period that seems particularly \nbleak, depressing, what appeared to be some failure, stumbling \nblock, countervailing force, foolishness of the global anticapital-\nist movement, and to try to recuperate something, some hidden \naspect we usually don’t notice, some angle from which the same \napparently desolate landscape might look entirely different. \nThis is most obvious perhaps in the first three essays, all of \nwhich concern the lessons to be learned from the global justice \nmovement; but it’s true, in one way or another, of all of them.\nIt’s appropriate, then, that the collection begins with The Shock \nof Victory, which is perhaps the most explicit in this regard. Most \nof us who had been involved in the global justice movement did \nnot, as I remarked, come out of it feeling we had made much of \ndent in the world. We all experienced the infighting and frazzled \nconfusion that followed the first heady years, the crumbling alli-\nances and seemingly endless bitter arguments over racism, sex-\nism, privilege, lifestyle, “summit-hopping,” process, the lack of \nties to genuine communities in resistance… And we saw it as the \nproof of our ultimate fecklessness as a movement, our failure to \nachieve any of our major goals. The irony is that, really, all these \nthings were a direct result of our success. Most of the squabbling \nwas really slightly an indirect way of conducting strategic debates \nabout what to do now that we had achieved so many of our im-\nmediate goals – to end structural adjustment policies and block \nnew global trade agreements, halt the growth and blunt the power \nof institutions of neoliberal governance like the IMF and WTO \n– had been achieved so quickly. The problem was that almost no \none actually recognized them as such, which made it almost im-\npossible to conduct a full and honest debate, and the intensity of \nthe arguments and resulting frustration became so overwhelm-\ning that almost no one seemed to notice we’d achieved our goals \nin the first place! True, the essay ends by posing a much a larger \nquestion, as Turbulence magazine was to phrase it in a special is-\nsue a year or two later, “What would it mean to win?” But largely \nit is a comment on the extraordinary historical effectiveness of \nmovements based on direct action and direct democracy, and the \ncurious fact that our enemies (as their panic reactions seem to \n",

What if the reason why those who would like to see \na world organized by some principle other than capitalism feel \nso depressed most of the time is because capitalists, and politi-\ncians, have become veritably obsessed with making us feel that \nway? Perhaps the real meaning of neoliberalism is precisely that. \nNeoliberal capitalism is that form that is utterly obsessed with en-\nsuring that it seems that, as Margaret Thatcher so famously de-\nclared in the 1980s, “there is no alternative.” In other words, it has \nlargely given up on any serious effort to argue that the current \neconomic order is actually a good order, just, reasonable, that it \nwill ever prove capable of creating a world in which most human \nbeings feel prosperous, safe, and free to spend any significant por-\ntion of their life pursuing those things they consider genuinely \nimportant. Rather, it is a terrible system, in which even the very \nrichest countries cannot guarantee access to such basic needs as \nhealth and education to the majority of their citizens, it works \nbadly, but no other system could possibly work at all. (It’s actu-\nally quite fascinating how quickly, at the end of the Cold War, the \nlanguage used to describe the Soviet Union shifted. Obviously, no \nsane person could wish for a restoration of such a system, and \nwe are very unlikely to ever see one. All this is good. But at the \nsame time, rhetoric shifted almost overnight from declaring that \na top down command economy with no market forces could not \ncompete effectively with the most advanced capitalist powers, ei-\nther militarily or economically, to the absolute, dismissive assur-\nance that communism “just doesn’t work” – effectively, that no \nsuch system could ever have existed at all. It seems a remarkable \nconclusion, considering that the Soviet Union did in fact exist, for \nover 70 years, and took Russia within decades from a laughable \nbackwater to a major technological and military power.) \nAll this remained a bit obscure in the years surrounding the \nend of the Cold War, when overenthusiastic neoliberal “reform-\ners” were fancying themselves revolutionaries, and everyone felt \nthat microcredit was about to turn the world’s poor into prosper-\nous entrepreneurs.

Behind \nour feeling of helplessness, then, there is a gargantuan, and ex-\ntraordinarily expensive engine that is ultimately likely to crush the \ncurrent system under its own dead weight.\nThe final essay of the set, Revolution in Reverse, considers the \nstakes of this war on the imagination on a deeper level.

None of us really \nfelt up to it. Instead, the class turned into a prolonged and some-\ntimes agonized discussion of the relevance of social theory itself: \nwas there really a point, then, to what we did, or were being trained \nto do? Does Theory – the sort that begins with a capital “T” – re-\nally afford us a better vantage from which to understand what had \njust happened, particularly, why so many working class people \nhad voted in a manner that seemed diametrically opposed to their \nown class interests, than ordinary common sense might afford? \nAnd if not, what were we really doing by pursuing careers in the \nacademy? We didn’t come up with any strong conclusions (though \nwe did end up having an interesting discussion of the possibility \nof breaking the US landmass up into separate territories, merging \nsome with Canada and others with Mexico, and even produced \nsome stickers that said ‘No Longer Under US Jurisdiction’).

When \nI did publish it, in 2001, I found the discipline did not agree.

The \nendless identification with soldiers (“support our troops!) – that \nis, with individuals who have, over the years, been reduced to little \nmore than high tech mercenaries enforcing of a global regime of \nfinancial capital – lay in the fact that these are almost the only in-\ndividuals of working class origin in the US who have figured out a \nway to get paid for pursuing some kind of higher ideal, or at least \nbeing able to imagine that’s what they’re doing.

Short-term goals were almost never \nreached. Despite numerous tactical victories (delays, utility com-\npany bankruptcies, legal injunctions) the plants that became the \nfocus of mass action all ultimately went on line.

But one rea-\nson they weren’t is that the medium-term goals were all reached \nalmost immediately.

Once \ngiant utility companies began claiming they too wanted to pro-\nmote green energy, effectively inviting what we’d now call the \nNGO types to a space at the table, there was an enormous temp-\ntation to jump ship. Especially because many of them had only \nallied with more radical groups so as to win themselves a place at \nthe table to begin with.\nThe inevitable result was a series of heated strategic debates. \nIt’s impossible to understand this, though, without first under-\nstanding that strategic debates, within directly democratic move-\nments, are rarely conducted as strategic debates.

Liberals on \nthe other hand really don’t like being forced to say “actually, I am \nin favor of maintaining capitalism in some form or another”’ – so \nwhenever possible, they try to change the subject. Consequently, \ndebates that are actually about whether to directly challenge capi-\ntalism usually end up getting argued out as if they were short-term \ndebates about tactics and non-violence. Authoritarian socialists \nor others who are suspicious of democracy are rarely keen on hav-\ning to make that an issue either, and prefer to discuss the need to \ncreate the broadest possible coalitions. Those who do support the \nprinciple of direct democracy but feel a group is taking the wrong \nstrategic direction often find it much more effective to challenge \nits decision-making process than to challenge its actual decisions.\nThere is another factor here that is even less remarked, but I \nthink equally important. Everyone knows that faced with a broad \nand potentially revolutionary coalition, any governments’ first \nmove will be to try to split it. Making concessions to placate the \nmoderates while selectively criminalizing the radicals – this is \nArt of Governance 101.

The other was to disseminate a (very much anarchist-in-\nspired) model of direct democracy: decentralized, affinity-group \nstructures, consensus process, to replace old-fashioned activist \norganizing styles with their steering committees and ideological \nsquabbles. At the time we sometimes called it “contamination-\nism,” the idea that all people really needed was to be exposed to \nthe experience of direct action and direct democracy, and they \nwould want to start imitating it all by themselves.

It is the \nmost powerful, most arrogant, most pitiless instrument through \nwhich neoliberal policies have, for the last 25 years been imposed \non the poorer countries of the global South, basically, by ma-\nnipulating debt. In exchange for emergency refinancing, the IMF \nwould demand “structural adjustment programs” that forced mas-\nsive cuts in health, education, price supports on food, and end-\nless privatization schemes that allowed foreign capitalists to buy \nup local resources at firesale prices. Structural adjustment never \nsomehow worked to get countries back on their feet economically, \nbut that just meant they remained in crisis, and the solution was \nalways to insist on yet another round of structural adjustment.\nThe IMF had another, less celebrated, role: that of global en-\nforcer. It was its job to ensure that no country (no matter how \npoor) could ever be allowed to default on loans to Western bank-\ners (no matter how foolhardy). Imagine a banker were to offer a \ncorrupt dictator a billion dollar loan, and that dictator placed it \ndirectly in his Swiss bank account and fled the country; the IMF’s \njob was to ensure that, rather than be forgiven or renegotiated, let \nalone hunted down, that billion would still have to be extracted \n(plus generous interest) from the dictator’s former victims. Under \nno conditions should Chase or Citibank have to take a loss. If a \ncountry did default, for any reason, the IMF could impose a credit \nboycott whose economic effects were roughly comparable to that \nof a nuclear bomb. (I note in passing that all this flies in the face of \neven elementary economic theory, whereby those lending money \nare supposed to be accepting a certain degree of risk; since it’s \nonly the danger of default that forces them to allocate money to \nproductive investments. But in the world of international politics, \neconomic laws are only held to be binding on the poor.) This role \nwas their downfall.\nWhat happened was that in 2002, Argentina defaulted and got \naway with it. \nIn the ‘90s, Argentina had been the IMF’s star pupil in Latin \nAmerica – they had literally privatized every public facility except \nthe customs bureau. Then in 2001, the economy crashed.

So he did. He did, in fact, \nthe one thing no one in that position is ever supposed to do. He \nannounced he simply wasn’t going to play the bulk of Argentina’s \nforeign debt.\nActually Kirchner was quite clever about it. He did not default \non his IMF loans.

Citibank and Chase appealed to the IMF, their accustomed \nenforcer, to apply the usual punishment. But for the first time in \nits history, the IMF balked. First of all, with Argentina’s economy \nalready in ruins, even the economic equivalent of a nuclear bomb \nwould do little more than make the rubble bounce. Second of all, \njust about everyone was aware it was the IMF’s disastrous advice \nthat set the stage for Argentina’s crash in the first place.

After that, every-\nthing was different. Before long, Brazil and Argentina together ar-\nranged to pay back their outstanding debt to the IMF itself as well. \nWith a little help from Chavez, so did the rest of the continent. \nIn 2003, Latin American IMF debt stood at $49 billion. Now it’s \n$694 million.4 To put that in perspective: that’s a decline of 98.6%. \nFor every thousand dollars owed four years ago, Latin America \nnow owes fourteen bucks. Asia followed.

Since the \n‘60s, and the catastrophe of Vietnam, the US government has not \nabandoned its policy of answering any threat of democratic mass \nmobilizing by a return to war. But it has to be much more care-\nful. Essentially, they now feel they have to design wars to be pro-\ntest-proof. There is very good reason to believe that the first Gulf \nWar, in 1991, was explicitly designed with this in mind. The ap-\nproach taken to the invasion of Iraq – the insistence on a smaller, \nhigh-tech army, the extreme reliance on indiscriminate firepower, \neven against civilians, to protect against any Vietnam-like levels \nof American casualties – appears to have been developed, again, \nmore with a mind to heading off any potential peace movement \nat home than one focused on military effectiveness. This, anyway, \nwould help explain why the most powerful army in the world has \nended up being tied down and even, periodically, defeated by an \nalmost unimaginably ragtag group of guerillas with negligible ac-\ncess to outside safe-areas, funding, or military support – that is, \nuntil they resorted to a desperate combination of death squads, \nethnic cleansing, massive bribery, and effectively turning over the \ncountry to their arch-enemy Iran. As in the trade summits, they \nare so obsessed with ensuring forces of civil resistance cannot be \nseen to win the battle at home that they would prefer to lose the \nactual war.\n",

Really I wrote this essay more to open \nup a conversation, to put the problem on the table – to inspire a \nstrategic debate.\nStill, some implications are pretty obvious. The next time we \nplan a major action campaign, I think we would do well to at least \ntake into account the possibility that we might win. Or at least, that \nwe might obtain our mid-range strategic goals very quickly, and \nthat when that happens, many of our allies will fall away. We have \nto recognize strategic debates for what they are, even when they \nappear to be about something else. Take one famous example: ar-\nguments about property destruction after Seattle. Most of these, I \nthink, were really arguments about capitalism. Those who decried \nwindow-breaking did so mainly because they wished to appeal to \nmiddle-class consumers to move towards global exchange-style \ngreen consumerism, and to ally with labor bureaucracies and so-\ncial democrats abroad. This was not a path designed to provoke a \ndirect confrontation with capitalism, and most of those who urged \nus to take this route were at least skeptical about the possibility \nthat capitalism could ever really be defeated. Many were in fact \nin favor of capitalism, if in a significantly humanized form. Those \nwho did break windows, on the other hand, didn’t care if they of-\nfended suburban homeowners, because they did not figure that \nsuburban homeowners were likely to ever become a significant \nelement in any future revolutionary anticapitalist coalition. They \nwere trying, in effect, to hijack the media to send a message that \nthe system was vulnerable – hoping to inspire similar insurrec-\ntionary acts on the part of those who might considering entering \na genuinely revolutionary alliance; alienated teenagers, oppressed \npeople of color, undocumented workers, rank-and-file laborers \nimpatient with union bureaucrats, the homeless, the unemployed, \nthe criminalized, the radically discontent. If a militant anticapital-\nist movement was to begin, in America, it would have to start with \npeople like these: people who don’t need to be convinced that the \nsystem is rotten, only, that there’s something they can do about \nit. And at any rate, even if it were possible to have an anticapital-\nist revolution without gun-battles in the streets – which most of \nus are hoping it is, since let’s face it, if we come up against the \nUS army, we will lose – there’s no possible way we could have an \n",

Yes, that will probably mean the subur-\nban middle class will be the last to come on board. But they would \nprobably be the last to come on board anyway.5\nThe latter actually leads to an interesting question. What would \nit mean to win, not just our medium-term goals, but our long term \nones? At the moment no one is even clear how that would come \nabout, for the very reason none of us have much faith remaining \nin “the” revolution in the old 19th or 20th century sense of the \nterm. After all, the total view of revolution, that there will be a \nsingle mass insurrection or general strike and then all walls will \ncome tumbling down, is entirely premised on the old fantasy of \ncapturing the state. That’s the only way victory could possibly be \nthat absolute and complete – at least, if we are speaking of a whole \ncountry or meaningful territory.\nIn way of illustration, consider this: What would it have actu-\nally meant for the Spanish anarchists to have actually “won” in \n1937? It’s amazing how rarely we ask ourselves such questions. \nWe just imagine it would have been something like the Russian \nRevolution, which began in a similar way, with the melting away \nof the old army, the spontaneous creation of workers’ soviets. \nBut that was in the major cities. The Russian Revolution was \nfollowed by years of civil war in which the Red Army gradually \nimposed a new government’s control on every part of the old \nRussian Empire, whether the communities in question wanted it \nor not. Let us imagine that anarchist militias in Spain had routed \nthe fascist army, and that army had completely dissolved. Let \nus further imagine that it had successfully kicked the social-\nist Republican Government out of its offices in Barcelona and \nMadrid. That would certainly have been anarchist victory by any-\nbody’s standards. But what would have happened next? Would \nthey have established the entire territory of what had once been \nSpain as a non-Republic, an anti-state existing within the exact \nsame international borders? Would they have imposed a regime \nof popular councils in every singe village and municipality in the \nterritory of what had formerly been Spain? How? We have to \nbear in mind here that were there were many villages, towns, \neven regions of Spain where anarchists were few to non-existent. \n5\t And this probably remains true, no matter how deep their mortgages \nare under water.\n",

But the irony is that the peo-\nple who organized these systems, even though they called them-\nselves Communists, never claimed that this top-down system \nitself was “communism.” They called it “socialism” (another argu-\nable point, but we’ll leave that one aside for a moment), and saw \ncommunism as a utopian truly free, stateless society that would \nexist at some point in the unknowable future.

Why is it \nthat projects like DAN’s – projects of democratizing society – are \nso often perceived as idle dreams that melt away as soon as they \nencounter hard material reality? In our case, at least, it had noth-\ning to do with inefficiency: police chiefs across the country had \ncalled us the best organized force they’d ever had to deal with. It \nseems to me the reality effect (if one may call it that) comes rather \nfrom the fact that radical projects tend to founder, or at least be-\ncome endlessly difficult, the moment they enter into the world of \nlarge, heavy objects: buildings, cars, tractors, boats, industrial ma-\nchinery. This in turn is not because these objects are somehow in-\ntrinsically difficult to administer democratically – history is full of \ncommunities that succesfully engage in the democratic adminis-\ntration of common resources – it’s because, like the DAN car, they \nare surrounded by endless government regulation, and effectively \nimpossible to hide from the government’s armed representatives. \nIn America, I have seen endless examples of this dilemma. A squat \nis legalized after a long struggle; suddenly, building inspectors ar-\nrive to announce it will take ten thousand dollars worth of repairs \nto bring it up to code. Organizers are therefore forced spend the \nnext several years organizing bake sales and soliciting contribu-\ntions. This means setting up bank accounts, and legal regulations \nthen specify how a group receiving funds, or dealing with the \ngovernment, must be organized (again, not as an egalitarian col-\nlective). All these regulations are enforced by violence. True, in \nordinary life, police rarely come in swinging billy clubs to enforce \nbuilding code regulations, but, as anarchists often discover, if one \nsimply pretends the state and its regulations don’t exist, that will, \neventually, happen. The rarity with which the nightsticks actually \nappear just helps to make the violence harder to see. This in turn \nmakes the effects of all these regulations – regulations that almost \nalways assume that normal relations between individuals are me-\ndiated by the market, and that normal groups are organized by \nrelations of hierarchy and command – seem to emanate not from \nthe government’s monopoly of the use of force, but from the large-\nness, solidity, and heaviness of the objects themselves. \n",

It even threads our language. Why, for example, is a \nbuilding referred to as “real property,” or “real estate”? The “real” \nin this usage is not derived from Latin res, or “thing”: it’s from the \nSpanish real, meaning, “royal,” “belonging to the king.” All land \nwithin a sovereign territory ultimately belongs to the sovereign; \nlegally this is still the case. This is why the state has the right to \nimpose its regulations. But sovereignty ultimately comes down to \na monopoly of what is euphemistically referred to as “force” – that \nis, violence. Just as Giorgio Agamben famously argued that from \nthe perspective of sovereign power, something is alive because \nyou can kill it, so property is “real” because the state can seize or \ndestroy it. In the same way, when one takes a “realist” position in \nInternational Relations, one assumes that states will use whatever \ncapacities they have at their disposal, including force of arms, to \npursue their national interests. What “reality” is one recognizing? \nCertainly not material reality. The idea that nations are human-\nlike entities with purposes and interests is entirely metaphysical. \nThe King of France had purposes and interests. “France” does not. \nWhat makes it seem “realistic” to suggest it does is simply that \nthose in control of nation-states have the power to raise armies, \nlaunch invasions, bomb cities, and can otherwise threaten the use \nof organized violence in the name of what they describe as their \n“national interests” – and that it would be foolish to ignore that \npossibility. National interests are real because they can kill you.\nThe critical term here is “force,” as in “the state’s monopoly of \nthe use of coercive force.” Whenever we hear this word invoked, \nwe find ourselves in the presence of a political ontology in which \nthe power to destroy, to cause others pain or to threaten to break, \ndamage, or mangle others bodies (or just lock them in a tiny room \nfor the rest of their lives) is treated as the social equivalent of the \nvery energy that drives the cosmos.

Obviously Leftists don’t deny \nthe reality of violence. Many Leftist theorists think about it quite \na lot. But they don’t tend to give it the same foundational sta-\ntus.1 Instead, I would argue that Leftist thought is founded on \nwhat I will call a “political ontology of the imagination” (I might \njust as easily have called it an ontology of creativity or making \nor invention.2) Nowadays, most of us tend to identify this ten-\ndency with the legacy of Marx, with his emphasis on social rev-\nolution and forces of material production. But even Marx was \nultimately only a man of his time, and his terms emerged from \nmuch wider arguments about value, labor, and creativity current \nin radical circles of his day, whether in the worker’s movement, \nor for that matter in various strains of Romanticism and bohe-\nmian life emerging around him in Paris and London at the time. \nMarx himself, for all his contempt for the utopian socialists of \nhis day, never ceased to insist that what makes human beings \ndifferent from animals is that architects, unlike bees, first raise \ntheir structures in the imagination. It was the unique property \nof humans, for Marx, that they first envision things, and only \nthen bring them into being. It was this process he referred to \nas “production.” Around the same time, utopian socialists like \n1\t Hence Mao might have written that “political power comes from the \nbarrel of a gun” but he was also, as a Marxist, committed to the prin-\nciple that structures and relations of economic production, rather \nthan political power, is ultimately determinant of social reality. \n2\t Both perspectives are at the very least partial. The division itself, I \nwould argue, is the product of certain peculiar features of Western \ntheories of knowledge: particularly, the tendency to see the world not \nin terms of processes but as a collection a discrete, self-identical ob-\njects. We tend to hide away the creation and destruction of objects \njust as we do birth and death; the result is that “forces” of creation and \ndestruction end up seeming the hidden reality behind everything. \n",

If artistic avant gardes and social revolutionaries have felt \na peculiar affinity for one another ever since, borrowing each \nother’s languages and ideas, it appears to have been insofar as \nboth have remained committed to the idea that the ultimate, \nhidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, \nand, could just as easily make differently. In this sense, a phrase \nlike “all power to the imagination” expresses the very quintes-\nsence of the Left.\nTo this emphasis on forces of creativity and production of \ncourse the Right tends to reply that revolutionaries systemati-\ncally neglect the social and historical importance of the “means \nof destruction”: states, armies, executioners, barbarian invasions, \ncriminals, unruly mobs, and so on. Pretending such things are not \nthere, or can simply be wished away, they argue, has the result of \nensuring that left-wing regimes will in fact create far more death \nand destruction than those that have the wisdom to take a more \n“realistic” approach.\nObviously, the dichotomy I am proposing is very much a \nsimplification.

No reasonable person would discount the \nimportance of fear and terror in human life. Acts of violence can \nbe – indeed usually are – acts of communication of one sort or \nanother.3 But the same could be said of any form of human action. \nIt strikes me that what is really important about violence is that it \nis perhaps the only form of human action that holds out the pos-\nsibility of operating on others without being communicative. Or \nlet me put this more precisely. Violence may well be the only way \nin which it is possible for one human being to have relatively pre-\ndictable effects on the actions of another without understanding \nanything about them. Pretty much any other way one might try \nto influence another’s actions, one at least has to have some idea \nwho they think they are, who they think you are, what they might \nwant out of the situation, and a host of similar considerations. Hit \nthem over the head hard enough, all this becomes irrelevant. It’s \ntrue that the effects one can have by hitting them are quite limited. \nBut they are real enough, and the fact remains that any alterna-\ntive form of action cannot, without some sort of appeal to shared \nmeanings or understandings, have any sort of effect at all. What’s \nmore, even attempts to influence another by the threat of violence, \nwhich clearly does require some level of shared understandings \n(at the very least, the other party must understand they are being \nthreatened, and what is being demanded of them), requires much \nless than any alternative. Most human relations – particularly on-\ngoing ones, such as those between longstanding friends or long-\nstanding enemies – are extremely complicated, endlessly dense \nwith experience and meaning. They require a continual and often \nsubtle work of interpretation; everyone involved must put con-\nstant energy into imagining the other’s point of view.

It makes possible relations of a far \nmore schematic kind: i.e., ‘cross this line and I will shoot you and \notherwise I really don’t care who you are or what you want’. This is, \nfor instance, why violence is so often the preferred weapon of the \nstupid: one could almost say, the trump card of the stupid, since \nit is that form of stupidity to which it is most difficult to come up \nwith an intelligent response. \nThere is, however, one crucial qualification to be made here. \nThe more evenly matched two parties are in their capacity for vio-\nlence, the less all this tends to be true. If two parties are engaged \nin a relatively equal contest of violence, it is indeed a very good \nidea for each to understand as much as possible about the other. A \nmilitary commander will obviously try to get inside his opponent’s \nmind. Two duelists, or boxers, will try to anticipate the other’s next \nmove. It’s really only when one side has an overwhelming advan-\ntage in their capacity to cause physical harm this is no longer the \ncase. Of course, when one side has an overwhelming advantage, \nthey rarely have to actually resort to actually shooting, beating, or \nblowing people up. The mere threat will usually suffice. This has \na curious effect. It means that the most characteristic quality of \nviolence – its capacity to impose very simple social relations that \ninvolve little or no imaginative identification – becomes most sa-\nlient in situations defined by the possibility of violence, but where \nactual, physical violence is least likely to be present. \nOrdinarily this is referred to as structural violence: all those \nsystematic inequalities that are ultimately backed up by the threat \nof force, and therefore, can be seen as a form of violence in them-\nselves. As feminists have long pointed out, systems of structural \nviolence invariably seem to produce extreme lopsided structures \nof imaginative identification. It’s not that interpretive work isn’t \ncarried out. Society, in any recognizable form, could not operate \nwithout it. Rather, the overwhelming burden of that interpretive \nlabor is relegated to its victims. \nLet me start with the patriarchal household. A constant staple \nof 1950s situation comedies, in America, were jokes about the \nimpossibility of understanding women. The jokes of course were \nalways told by men.

Actually, this sort of rhetoric \nabout the mysteries of womankind is a perennial feature of patri-\narchal families: structures that can, certainly, be considered forms \nof structural violence insofar as the power of men over women \nwithin them is, as generations of feminists have pointed out, ulti-\nmately backed up, if often in indirect and hidden ways, by all sorts \nof coercive force. But generations of female novelists – Virginia \nWolfe comes immediately to mind – have also documented the \nother side of this: the constant work women perform in manag-\ning, maintaining, and adjusting the egos of apparently oblivious \nmen – involving an endless work of imaginative identification and \nwhat I’ve called interpretive labor. This carries over on every level. \nWomen are always imagining what things look like from a male \npoint of view. Men almost never do the same for women. \nThis is presumably the reason why in so many societies with a \npronounced gendered division of labor (that is, most societies), \nwomen know a great deal about men do every day, and men have \nnext to no idea what women do. Faced with the prospect of even \ntrying to imagine a women’s daily life and general perspective \non the world, many recoil in horror. In the US, one popular trick \namong high school creative writing teachers is to assign students \nto write an essay imagining that they were to switch genders, and \ndescribe what it would be like to live for one day as a member of \nthe opposite sex. The results are almost always exactly the same: \nall the girls in class write long and detailed essays demonstrat-\ning that they have spent a great deal of time thinking about such \nquestions; roughly half the boys refuse to write the essay entirely. \nAlmost invariably they express profound resentment about hav-\ning to imagine what it might be like to be a woman.\nIt should be easy enough to multiply parallel examples. When \nsomething goes wrong in a restaurant kitchen, and the boss ap-\npears to size things up, he is unlikely to pay much attention to a \ncollection of workers all scrambling to explain their version of the \nstory. Likely as not he’ll tell them all to shut up and just arbitrarily \ndecide what he thinks is likely to have happened: “you’re the new \nguy, you must have messed up – if you do it again, you’re fired.” \n",

What oc-\ncurs on the most petty or intimate level also occurs on the level \nof society as a whole. Curiously enough it was Adam Smith, in \nhis Theory of Moral Sentiments (written in 1761), who first made \nnotice of what’s nowadays labeled “compassion fatigue.” Human \nbeings, he observed, appear to have a natural tendency not only \nto imaginatively identify with their fellows, but also, as a result, \nto actually feel one another’s joys and pains. The poor, however, \nare just too consistently miserable, and as a result, observers, for \ntheir own self-protection, tend to simply blot them out. The result \nis that while those on the bottom spend a great deal of time imag-\nining the perspectives of, and actually caring about, those on the \ntop, but it almost never happens the other way around. That is my \nreal point. Whatever the mechanisms, something like this always \nseems to occur: whether one is dealing with masters and servants, \nmen and women, bosses and workers, rich and poor. Structural \ninequality – structural violence – invariably creates the same lop-\nsided structures of the imagination. And since, as Smith correctly \nobserved, imagination tends to bring with it sympathy, the vic-\ntims of structural violence tend to care about its beneficiaries, or \nat least, to care far more about them than those beneficiaries care \nabout them. In fact, this might well be (apart from the violence \nitself) the single most powerful force preserving such relations.4\nIt is easy to see bureaucratic procedures as an extension of this \nphenomenon. One might say they are not so much themselves \nforms of stupidity and ignorance as modes of organizing situa-\ntions already marked by stupidity and ignorance owing the exis-\ntence of structural violence. True, bureaucratic procedure oper-\nates as if it were a form of stupidity, in that it invariably means \nignoring all the subtleties of real human existence and reducing \neverything to simple pre-established mechanical or statistical for-\nmulae. Whether it’s a matter of forms, rules, statistics, or ques-\ntionnaires, bureaucracy is always about simplification. Ultimately \n4\t While I am drawing on a broad range of feminist theory here, the \nmost important is “standpoint theory”: the key notes to consult here \nare Patricia Hill Collins, Donna Haraway, Sandra Harding, and Nancy \nHarstock.

Police sociologists have long since \ndemonstrated that only a tiny fraction of police work has anything \nto do with crime. Police are, rather, the immediate representatives \nof the state’s monopoly of violence, those who step in to actively \nsimplify situations (for example, were someone to actively chal-\nlenge some bureaucratic definition.) Simultaneously, police they \nhave become, in contemporary industrial democracies, America \nin particular, the almost obsessive objects of popular imaginative \nidentification. In fact, the public is constantly invited, in a thou-\nsand TV shows and movies, to see the world from a police officer’s \nperspective, even if it is always the perspective of imaginary police \nofficers, the kind who actually do spend their time fighting crime \nrather than concerning themselves with broken tail lights or open \ncontainer laws. \nIIa: excursus on transcendent versus immanent imagination\nTo imaginatively identify with an imaginary policeman is of \ncourse not the same as to imaginatively identify with a real po-\nliceman (most Americans in fact avoid real policeman like the \nplague). This is a critical distinction, however much an increas-\ningly digitalized world makes it easy to confuse the two. \nIt is here helpful to consider the history of the word “imagina-\ntion.” The common Ancient and Medieval conception, what we \ncall “the imagination” was considered the zone of passage between \nreality and reason. Perceptions from the material world had to \npass through the imagination, becoming emotionally charged in \nthe process and mixing with all sorts of phantasms, before the ra-\ntional mind could grasp their significance. Intentions and desires \nmoved in the opposite direction. It’s only after Descartes, really, \nthat the word “imaginary” came to mean, specifically, anything \nthat is not real: imaginary creatures, imaginary places (Middle \nEarth, Narnia, planets in faraway Galaxies, the Kingdom of Prester \nJohn…), imaginary friends.

Imaginary \ncreatures – elves or unicorns or TV cops – are not affected by the \nreal world. They cannot be, since they don’t exist. In contrast, the \nkind of imagination I have been referring to here is much closer \nto the old, immanent, conception. Critically, it is in no sense static \nand free-floating, but entirely caught up in projects of action that \naim to have real effects on the material world, and as such, always \nchanging and adapting. This is equally true whether one is craft-\ning a knife or a piece of jewelry, or trying to make sure one doesn’t \nhurt a friend’s feelings. \nOne might get a sense of how important this distinction re-\nally is by returning to the ‘68 slogan about giving power to the \nimagination. If one takes this to refer to the transcendent imagi-\nnation – preformed utopian schemes, for example – doing so can, \nwe know, have disastrous effects. Historically, it has often meant \nimposing them by violence. On the other hand, in a revolution-\nary situation, one might by the same token argue that not giving \nfull power to the other, immanent, sort of imagination would be \nequally disastrous. \nThe relation of violence and imagination is made much more \ncomplicated because while structural inequalities always tend to \nsplit society into those doing imaginative labor, and those who do \nnot, they can do so in very different ways. Capitalism here is a dra-\nmatic case in point. Political economy tend to see work in capital-\nist societies as divided between two spheres: wage labor, for which \nthe paradigm is always factories, and domestic labor – housework, \nchildcare – relegated mainly to women. The first is seen primar-\nily as a matter of creating and maintaining physical objects. The \nsecond is probably best seen as a matter of creating and maintain-\ning people and social relations.

Contemporary social theory offers \nlittle explanation. Poststructuralism, which emerged in the imme-\ndiate aftermath of ‘68, was largely born of the rejection of this sort \nof analysis. It is now simple common sense among social theorists \nthat one cannot define a society as “unnatural” unless one assumes \nthat there is some natural way for society to be, “inhuman” unless \nthere is some authentic human essence, that one cannot say that \nthe self is “fragmented” unless it would be possible to have a uni-\nfied self, and so on. Since these positions are untenable – since \nthere is no natural condition for society, no authentic human es-\nsence, no unitary self – theories of alienation have no basis. Taken \npurely as arguments, these seem difficult to refute.7 But how then \ndo we account for the experience?\nIf one really thinks about it, though, the argument is much less \npowerful than it seems. After all, what are academic theorists say-\ning? They are saying that the idea of a unitary subject, a whole \nsociety, a natural order, are unreal. That all these things are sim-\nply figments of our imagination. True enough. But then: what else \ncould they be? And why is that a problem?8 If imagination is in-\ndeed a constituent element in the process of how we produce our \nsocial and material realities, there is every reason to believe that \n7\t But the result is that “postmodern” alienation theory sees alienation \nsimply as the subjective experience of those who are somehow op-\npressed, or excluded, whose own self-definition clashes with the defi-\nnitions imposed by society. For me, this deprives the concept of much \nof its power: which is to say that the ultimate problem with the system \nis not that some are excluded from it, but that even the winners do \nnot really win, because the system itself is ultimately incapable of pro-\nducing a truly unalienated life for anyone.\n8\t Perhaps from a Critical Realist perspective one could argue that “real-\nity” is precisely that which can be entirely encompassed in our imagi-\nnative constructions; however, this is pretty clearly not what they \nhave in mind; anyway, if one is speaking of political ontologies, as I \nhave been, then politics is precisely the domain where it is most dif-\nficult to make such distinctions. Anyway, one could well argue that if \nthere is any human essence, it is precisely our capacity to imagine that \nwe have one.\n",

At the same time, they also felt all this was inevitably \nleading up to a great insurrectionary moment – “the” revolution, \nproperly speaking. If the events of May ‘68 showed anything, it was \nthat if one does not aim to seize state power, there can be no such \nfundamental, one-time break. The main difference between the \nSituationists and their most avid current readers is that the mil-\nlenarian element has almost completely fallen away. No one thinks \nthe skies are about to open any time soon. There is a consolation \nthough: that as a result, as close as one can come to experiencing \ngenuine revolutionary freedom, one can begin to experience it im-\nmediately. Consider the following statement from the CrimethInc \ncollective, probably the most inspiring young anarchist propagan-\ndists operating in the Situationist tradition today:\nWe must make our freedom by cut-\nting holes in the fabric of this reality, by \nforging new realities which will, in turn, \nfashion us.

First of all, they assume that ‘the public’ is an en-\ntity with opinions, interests, and allegiances that can be treated as \nrelatively consistent over time. In fact what we call “the public” is \ncreated, produced, through specific institutions that allow specific \nforms of action – taking polls, watching television, voting, signing \npetitions or writing letters to elected officials or attending public \nhearings – and not others.

In fact, to a large extent it is \na social stripping away of those social constraints that, paradoxically, \ndefine us as isolated individuals. After all, for authors ranging from \nKierkegaard to Durkheim, the alienation that is the condition of mod-\nern life is not the experience of constraints at all but its very opposite. \n“Alienation” is the anxiety and despair we face when presented with \nan almost infinite range of choices, in the absence of any larger moral \nstructures through which to make them meaningful. From an activist \nperspective though this is simply another effect of institutionalized \nframeworks: most of all, this is what happens when we are used to \nimagining ourselves primarily as consumers. In the absence of the \nmarket, it would be impossible to conceive of “freedom” as a series of \nchoices made in isolation; instead, freedom can only mean the free-\ndom to choose what kind of commitments one wishes to make to \nothers, and, of course, the experience of living under only those con-\nstraints one has freely chosen. At any rate, just as during moments \nof revolution institutionalized structures of statecraft are dissolved \ninto public assemblies and institutionalized structures of labor con-\ntrol melt into self-management, so do consumer markets give way to \nconviviality and collective celebration. Spontaneous insurrections are \nalmost always experienced by those taking part as carnivals; an expe-\nrience that those planning mass actions – as we’ve seen – are often \nquite self-consciously trying to reproduce.\n",

When he speaks of social \ncreativity it is almost always in terms of revolution, but here, he \ninsists that imagining something and then trying to bring it into \nbeing is precisely what we should never do. That would be utopia-\nnism, and for utopianism, he had only withering contempt. \nThe most generous interpretation, I would suggest, is that Marx \non some level understood that the production of people and social \nrelations worked on different principles, but also knew he did not \nreally have a theory of what those principles were. Probably it was \nonly with the rise of feminist theory – that I was drawing on so \nliberally in my earlier analysis – that it became possible to think \nsystematically about such issues. I might add that it is a profound \nreflection on the effects of structural violence on the imagination \nthat feminist theory itself was so quickly sequestered away into its \nown subfield where it has had almost no impact on the work of \nmost male theorists. \nIt seems to me no coincidence, then, that so much of the real \npractical work of developing a new revolutionary paradigm in re-\ncent years has also been the work of feminism; or anyway, that femi-\nnist concerns have been the main driving force in their transforma-\ntion. In America, the current anarchist obsession with consensus \nand other forms of directly democratic process traces back directly \nto organizational issues within the feminist movement. What had \nbegun, in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, as small, intimate, often anar-\nchist-inspired collectives were thrown into crisis when they started \ngrowing rapidly in size. Rather than abandon the search for consen-\nsus in decision-making, many began trying to develop more for-\nmal versions on the same principles.

By the time of the direct action campaigns \nagainst the nuclear power industry in the late ‘70s, the whole appa-\nratus of affinity groups, spokescouncils, consensus and facilitation \nhad already begun to take something like it’s contemporary form. \nThe resulting outpouring of new forms of consensus process con-\nstitutes the most important contribution to revolutionary practice \nin decades. It is largely the work of feminists engaged in practical \norganizing – a majority, probably, feminists tied at least loosely the \nanarchist tradition, or at least more and more as mainstream femi-\nnism turned away from the politics of direct action and anarchism \ncame to take on such processes as its own. This makes it all the \nmore ironic that male theorists who have not themselves engaged \nin on-the-ground organizing or taken part in anarchist decision-\nmaking processes, but who find themselves drawn to anarchism \nas a principle, so often feel obliged to include in otherwise sympa-\nthetic statements, that of course they don’t agree with this obviously \nimpractical, pie-in-the-sky, unrealistic consensus nonsense.\nThe organization of mass actions themselves – festivals of re-\nsistance, as they are often called – can be considered pragmatic \nexperiments in whether it is indeed possible to institutionalize \nthe experience of liberation, the giddy realignment of imaginative \npowers, everything that is most powerful in the experience of a \nsuccessful spontaneous insurrection. Or if not to institutionalize \nit, perhaps, to produce it on call. The effect for those involved is as \nif everything were happening in reverse. A revolutionary uprising \nbegins with battles in the streets, and if successful, proceeds to \noutpourings of popular effervescence and festivity. There follows \nthe sober business of creating new institutions, councils, decision-\nmaking processes, and ultimately the reinvention of everyday life. \nSuch at least is the ideal, and certainly there have been moments \nin human history where something like that has begun to happen \n– much though, again, such spontaneous creations always seems \nto end being subsumed within some new form of violent bureau-\ncracy. However, as I’ve noted, this is more or less inevitable since \nbureaucracy, however much it serves as the immediate organizer \nof situations of power and structural blindness, does not create \nthem.

Even if \nnot, actions begin with the creation of new forms of collective \ndecision-making: councils, assemblies, the endless attention to \n‘process’ – and uses those forms to plan the street actions and \npopular festivities. The result is, usually, a dramatic confrontation \nwith armed representatives of the state. While most organizers \nwould be delighted to see things escalate to a popular insurrec-\ntion, and something like that does occasionally happen, most \nwould not expect these to mark any kind of permanent breaks in \nreality.

One of the great gifts of femi-\nnism to political thought has been to continually remind us of the \npeople is in fact making and preparing and cleaning those stages, \nand even more, maintaining the invisible structures that make \nthem possible – people who have, overwhelmingly, been women. \nThe normal process of politics of course is to make such people \ndisappear. Indeed one of the chief functions of women’s work is \nto make itself disappear. One might say that the political ideal \nwithin direct action circles has become to efface the difference; or, \nto put it another way, that action is seen as genuinely revolution-\nary when the process of production of situations is experienced as \njust as liberating as the situations themselves. It is an experiment \none might say in the realignment of imagination, of creating truly \nnon-alienated forms of experience. \nConclusion\nObviously it is also attempting to do so in a context in which, \nfar from being put in temporary abeyance, state power (in many \nparts of the globe at least) so suffuses every aspect of daily exis-\ntence that its armed representatives intervene to regulate the in-\nternal organizational structure of groups allowed to cash checks \n",

Many of these bases organize out-\nreach programs, in which soldiers venture out to repair school-\nrooms or to perform free dental checkups for the locals. These \nprograms were created to improve local relations, but in this task \nthey often proved remarkably ineffective. Why, then, did the army \nnot abandon them? The answer was that the programs had such \nenormous psychological impact on the soldiers, many of whom \nwould wax euphoric when describing them: e.g., “This is why I \njoined the army”; “This is what military service is really all about \n– not just defending your country, but helping people.” Professor \nLutz is convinced that the main reason these programs continue \n",

Quite the opposite: our normal habits of thought \ntend towards a rough and ready cynicism. The world is a giant \nmarketplace; everyone is in it for a buck; if you want to understand \nwhy something happened, first ask who stands to gain by it. The \nsame attitudes expressed in the back rooms of bars are echoed in \nthe highest reaches of social science. America’s great contribution \nto the world in the latter respect has been the development of “ra-\ntional choice” theories, which proceed from the assumption that \nall human behavior can be understood as a matter of economic \ncalculation, of rational actors trying to get as much as possible \nout of any given situation with the least cost to themselves. As \na result, in most fields, the very existence of altruistic behavior \nis considered a kind of puzzle, and everyone from economists to \nevolutionary biologists have made themselves famous through at-\ntempts to “solve” it – that is, to explain the mystery of why bees \nsacrifice themselves for hives or human beings hold open doors \nand give correct street directions to total strangers. At the same \ntime, the case of the military bases suggests the possibility that in \nfact Americans, particularly the less affluent ones, are haunted by \nfrustrated desires to do good in the world. \nIt would not be difficult to assemble evidence that this is the \ncase.

The same pattern holds true, incidentally, when comparing \nthe middle classes and the rich: one study of tax returns in 2003 \nconcluded that if the most affluent families had given away as \nmuch of their assets even as the average middle class family, over-\nall charitable donations that year would have increased by 25 bil-\nlion dollars.

Rather egoism or altruism \nare ideas we have about human nature. Historically, one tends to \narise in response to the other. In the ancient world, for example, \nit is precisely in the times and places as one sees the emergence of \nmoney and markets that one also sees the rise of world religions \n– Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. If one sets aside a space and \nsays, “Here you shall think only about acquiring material things \nfor yourself,” then it is hardly surprising that before long someone \nelse will set aside a countervailing space, declaring, in effect: “Yes, \nbut here, we must contemplate the fact that the self, and material \nthings, are ultimately unimportant.” It was these latter institutions, \nof course, that first developed our modern notions of charity. \nEven today, when we operate outside the domain of the market \nor of religion, very few of our actions could be said to be moti-\nvated by anything so simple as untrammeled greed or utterly self-\nless generosity. When we are dealing not with strangers but with \nfriends, relatives, or enemies, a much more complicated set of \nmotivations will generally come into play: envy, solidarity, pride, \nself-destructive grief, loyalty, romantic obsession, resentment, \nspite, shame, conviviality, the anticipation of shared enjoyment, \nthe desire to show up a rival, and so on. These are the motivations \nthat impel the major dramas of our lives, that great novelists like \nTolstoy and Dostoevsky immortalize, but that social theorists, for \nsome reason, tend to ignore.

One might put it this \nway: if value is simply what one considers important, then money \nallows importance take a liquid form, enables us to compare pre-\ncise quantities of importance and trade one off for the other. After \nall, if someone does accumulate a very large amount of money, the \nfirst thing they are likely to do is to try to convert it into something \nunique, whether this be Monet’s water lilies, a prize-winning race-\nhorse, or an endowed chair at a university. \nWhat is really at stake here in any market economy is precisely \nthe ability to make these trades, to convert “value” into “values.” \nWe all are striving to put ourselves in a position where we can \ndedicate ourselves to something larger than ourselves. When lib-\nerals do well in America, it’s because they can embody that pos-\nsibility: the Kennedys, for example, are the ultimate Democratic \nicons not just because they started as poor Irish immigrants who \nmade enormous amounts of money, but because they are seen as \nhaving managed, ultimately, to turn all that money into nobility.\nPROPOSITION III:\nThe real problem of the American left is that while it does try in certain ways to \nefface the division between egoism and altruism, value and values, it largely does so \nfor its own children.  This has allowed the right to paradoxically represent itself as \nthe champions of the working class.\nAll this might help explain why the Left in America is in such \na mess. Far from promoting new visions of effacing the difference \nbetween egoism and altruism, value and values, or providing a \nmodel for passing from one to the other, progressives cannot even \nseem to think their way past it.

As I say, the very fact that progressives \nframe the question this way not only shows they are trapped in the \nright’s terms of analysis. It demonstrates they do not understand \nhow America really works. \nLet me illustrate what I mean by considering the strange popu-\nlar appeal, at least until recently, of George W. Bush. In 2004, most \nof the American liberal intelligentsia did not seem to be able to \nget their heads around it. After the election, what left so many of \nthem reeling was their suspicion that the things they most hated \nabout Bush were exactly what so many Bush voters liked about \nhim. Consider the debates, for example. If statistics are to be be-\nlieved, millions of Americans who watched George Bush and John \nKerry lock horns, concluded that Kerry won, and then went off \nand voted for Bush anyway. It was hard to escape the suspicion \nthat in the end, Kerry’s articulate presentation, his skill with words \nand arguments, had actually counted against him. \nThis sends liberals into spirals of despair. They cannot under-\nstand why decisive leadership is equated with acting like an idiot. \nNeither can they understand how a man who comes from one \nof the most elite families in the country, who attended Andover, \nYale, and Harvard, and whose signature facial expression is a self-\nsatisfied smirk, could ever convince anyone he was a “man of the \npeople.” I must admit I have struggled with this as well. As a child \nof working class parents who won a scholarship to Andover in the \n1970s and eventually, a job at Yale, I have spent much of my life \nin the presence of men like Bush., everything about them oozing \nself-satisfied privilege. But in fact, stories like mine – stories of \ndramatic class mobility through academic accomplishment – are \nincreasingly unusual in America. \nAmerica of course continues to see itself as a land of oppor-\ntunity, and certainly from the perspective of an immigrant from \nHaiti or Bangladesh, it is. No doubt in terms of overall social \nmobility, we still compare favorably to countries like Bolivia or \nFrance. But America has always been a country built on the prom-\nise of unlimited upward mobility. The working-class condition has \nbeen traditionally seen as a way station, as something one’s fam-\nily passes through on the road to something better. Lincoln used \n",

In Lincoln’s day, \nthe ideal was that it was mainly immigrants who worked as wage \nlaborers, and that they did so in order to save up enough money to \ndo something else: if nothing else, to buy some land and become a \nhomesteader on the frontier. \nThe point is not how accurate this ideal was; the point was most \nAmericans have found the image plausible. Every time the road \nis perceived to be clogged, profound unrest ensues. The closing \nof the frontier led to bitter labor struggles, and over the course \nof the twentieth century, the steady and rapid expansion of the \nAmerican university system could be seen as a kind of substitute. \nParticularly after World War II, huge resources were poured into \nexpanding the higher education system, which grew extremely \nrapidly, and all this was promoted quite explicitly as a means of \nsocial mobility. This served during the Cold War as almost an \nimplied social contract, not just offering a comfortable life to the \nworking classes but holding out the chance that their children \nwould not be working-class themselves. \nThe problem, of course, is that a higher education system can-\nnot be expanded forever. At a certain point one ends up with a \nsignificant portion of the population unable to find work even re-\nmotely in line with their qualifications, who have every reason to \nbe angry about their situation, and who also have access to the \nentire history of radical thought. During the twentieth century, \nthis was precisely the situation most likely to spark revolts and \ninsurrections – revolutionary heroes from Chairman Mao to Fidel \nCastro almost invariably turn out to be children of poor parents \nwho scrimped to give their children a bourgeois education, only to \ndiscover that a bourgeois education does not, in itself, guarantee \nentry into the bourgeoisie. By the late sixties and early seventies, \nthe very point where the expansion of the university system hit a \ndead end, campuses were, predictably, exploding.\nWhat followed could be seen as a kind of settlement. Campus \nradicals were reabsorbed into the university, but set to work large-\nly at training children of the elite.

The number of working-class students in major uni-\nversities, which steadily grew until at least the late sixties, has now \nbeen declining for decades. \nIf working-class Bush voters tend to resent intellectuals more \nthan they do the rich, then, the most likely reason is because they \ncan imagine scenarios in which they might become rich, but can-\nnot imagine one in which they, or any of their children, could ever \nbecome members of the intelligentsia? If you think about it, this \nis not an unreasonable assessment. A mechanic from Nebraska \nknows it is highly unlikely that his son or daughter will ever be-\ncome an Enron executive. But it is possible. There is virtually no \nchance on the other hand that his child, no matter how talented, \nwill ever become an international human rights lawyer, or a drama \ncritic for the New York Times. Here we need to remember not just \nthe changes in higher education, but also the role that unpaid, or \neffectively unpaid, internships. It has become a fact of life in the \nUnited States that if one chooses a career for any reason other \nthan the money, for the first year or two one will not be paid. This \nis certainly true if one wishes to be involved in altruistic pursuits: \nsay, to join the world of charities, or NGOs, or to become a politi-\ncal activist. But it is equally true if one wants to pursue values like \nBeauty or Truth: to become part of the world of books, or the art \nworld, or an investigative reporter. The custom effectively seals off \nany such career for any poor student who actually does attain a \nliberal arts education. Such structures of exclusion had always ex-\nisted of course, especially at the top, but in recent decades fences \nhave become fortresses.\nIf that mechanic’s son – or daughter – wishes to pursue some-\nthing higher, more noble, for a career, what options does she re-\nally have? Likely just two. She can seek employment with her local \nchurch, which is hard to get. Or she can join the Army.\nThis is, of course, the secret of nobility. To be noble is to be gen-\nerous, high-minded, altruistic, to pursue higher forms of value. \nBut it is also to be able to do so because one does not really have \nto think too much about money. This is precisely what our sol-\ndiers are doing when they give free dental examinations to villag-\ners: they are being paid (modestly, but adequately) to do good in \nthe world. Seen in this light, it is also easier to see what really hap-\npened at universities in the wake of the 1960s – the “settlement” I \nmentioned above.

Neither were any of the speakers known primarily for what \nthey had to say about things artistic. Everyone seems to have felt \nthey were there to explore slightly new territory. This included, I \nthink, much of the audience. The place was packed, but especially, \nit seemed, with students and scholars involved in some way with \npost-graduate education – especially where it interfaced with the \nculture industry. Among many scholars, especially younger ones, \nsome of the speakers – especially Negri – were very big names, \ncelebrities, even something close to rock stars. Many of the gradu-\nate students were no doubt there in part just for the opportunity \nto finally see figures whose ideas they’d been debating for most of \ntheir intellectual careers revealed in to them in the flesh: to see \nwhat they looked like, what kind of clothes they wore, how they \nheld themselves and spoke and moved. Perhaps even to mill about \nin the pub afterwards and rub shoulders. \nThis is always part of the pleasure of the event. Certainly this \nwas part of the pleasure for me. Great theorists are almost always, \nin a certain sense, performers. Even if you’ve seen photographs, it \nnever conveys a full sense of who they are; and when you do get \na sense of who they are, returning to read their work with one’s \nnew, personal sense of the author tends to be an entirely differ-\nent experience. It was interesting to observe Lazzarato’s smooth \nhead and excellent moustache; Revel’s poise and energy; Bifo’s \nhair – sort of Warhol meets Jacques Derrida – not to mention the \nway he seemed to walk as if floating a half inch above the pave-\nment; Negri’s almost sheepishness at his inability to pronounce \nlong English words, which made him seem shy and almost boyish. \nI had never really had a sense of what any of these people were \nlike and I walked away, oddly, with much more respect for them \nas people. This is partly no doubt because anyone who you know \nlargely through obscurely written texts that some treat with an \nalmost mystical adulation tends to become, in one’s imagination, \nrather an arrogant person, self-important, someone who thinks \noneself a kind of minor rock star, perhaps, since they are treated \n",

These were people who certainly were comfortable in the spot-\nlight. But otherwise, their conditions of existence obviously in no \nway resembled that of rock stars. In fact they were rather modest. \nMost had paid a significant price for their radical commitments \nand some continued to do so: Negri is now out of jail of course and \nsettled in a fairly comfortable life on academic and government \npensions, but Bifo is a high school teacher (if at a very classy high \nschool) and Lazzarato appears under the dreaded rubric of “inde-\npendent scholar.” It’s a little shocking to discover scholars of such \nrecognized importance in the domain of ideas could really have \nreceived such little institutional recognition, but of course (as I \nwould know better than anyone), there is very little connection \nbetween the two – especially, when politics is involved. \n(Neither were they likely to be walking home with vast troves \nof money from taking part in this particular event: 500 tickets at \n£20 each might seem like a bit of money, but once you figure in the \ncost of the venue, hotels and transportation, the remainder, split \nfour ways, would make for a decidedly modest lecture fee.)\nAll in all, they seemed to exude an almost wistful feeling, of \nmodest, likable people scratching their heads over the knowledge \nthat, twenty years before, struggling side to side with insurrec-\ntionary squatters and running pirate radio stations, they would \nnever have imagined ending up quite where they were now, filling \nthe lecture hall of a stodgy British museum with philosophy stu-\ndents eager to hear their opinions about art.

First, because “immaterial workers” who are \n“those who work in advertising, fashion, marketing, television, cy-\nbernetics, and so forth” are increasingly numerous and important; \nbut even more, because we have all become immaterial workers, \ninsofar as we are disseminating information about brand names, \ncreating subcultures, frequenting fan magazines or web pages or \ndeveloping our own personal sense of style. As a result, produc-\ntion – at least in the sense of the production of the value of a com-\nmodity, what makes it something anyone would wish to buy – is \nno longer limited to the factory, but is dispersed across society as \na whole, and value itself thus becomes impossible to measure.\nTo some degree all this is just a much more sophisticated Leftist \nversion of the familiar pop economic rhetoric about the rise of the \nservice economy. But there is also a very particular history, here, \nwhich goes back to dilemmas in Italian workerism in the ‘70s and \n‘80s. On the one hand, there was a stubborn Leninist assumption – \npromoted, for instance, by Negri – that it must always be the most \n“advanced” sector of the proletariat that makes up the revolution-\nary class. Computer and other information workers were the obvi-\nous candidates here. But the same period saw the rise of feminism \nand the Wages for Housework movement, which put the whole \nproblem of unwaged, domestic labor on the political table in a way \nthat could no longer simply be ignored. The solution was to argue \nthat computer work, and housework were really the same thing. \nOr, more precisely, that they were becoming so: since, it was ar-\ngued, the increase of labor-saving devices meant that housework \nwas becoming less and less a matter of simple drudgery, and more \nand more itself a matter of managing fashions, tastes and styles. \nThe result is a genuinely strange concept, combining a kind \nof frenzied postmodernism, with the most clunky, old-fash-\nioned Marxist material determinism.

It’s not even to say that many of the connections being \ndrawn in the immaterial labor argument are not real and impor-\ntant. Most of these however have been identified, and debated, in \nfeminist literature for some time, and often to much better effect. \nBack in the ‘80s, for instance, Donna Haraway was already discuss-\ning the way that new communication technologies were allowing \nforms of “home work” to disseminate throughout society. To take \nan obvious example: for most of the twentieth century, capitalist \noffices have been organized according to a gendered division of la-\nbor that mirrors the organization of upper-class households: male \nexecutives engage in strategic planning while female secretaries \nwere expected to do much of the day-to-day organizational work, \nalong with almost all of the impression-management, communi-\ncative and interpretive labor – mostly over the phone. Gradually, \nthese traditionally female functions have become digitized and re-\nplaced by computers. This creates a dilemma, though, because the \ninterpretive elements of female labor (figuring out how to ensure \nno one’s ego is bruised, that sort of thing) are precisely those that \ncomputers are least capable of performing. Hence the renewed \nimportance of what the post-workerists like to refer to as “affective \nlabor.” This, in turn, effects how phone work is being reorganized, \nnow: as globalized, but also as largely complementary to software, \nwith interpretive work aimed more at the egos of customers than \n(now invisible) male bosses. The connections are all there. But it’s \nonly by starting from long-term perspectives that one can get any \nclear idea what’s really new here, and this is precisely what a post-\nmodern approach makes impossible.\nThis last example brings us to my second point, which is that \nvery notion that there is something that can be referred to as “im-\nmaterial labor” relies on a remarkably crude, old-fashioned ver-\nsion of Marxism. Immaterial labor, we are told, is labor that pro-\nduces information and culture.

This is what has allowed gen-\nerations of Marxists to declare that most of what we call “culture” \nis really just so much fluff, at best a reflex of the really important \nstuff going on in fields and foundries. \nWhat all such conceptions ignore what is to my mind prob-\nably the single most powerful, and enduring insight of Marxist \ntheory: that the world does not really consist (as capitalists would \nencourage us to believe) of a collection of discrete objects that \ncan then be bought and sold, but of actions and processes. This \nis what makes it possible for rich and powerful people insist that \nwhat they do is somehow more abstract, more ethereal, higher \nand more spiritual, than everybody else.

The premise is extremely dubious: states have been con-\ncerned with promulgating health and fertility since the time of \nFrazerian sacred kings, but one might well argue it’s based on the \nsame sort of intellectual move.

If you managed to convince everyone on earth that you can \nbreathe under water, it won’t make any difference: if you try it, \nyou will still drown. On the other hand, if you could convince ev-\neryone in the entire world that you were King of France, then you \nwould actually be the King of France. (In fact, it would probably \nwork just to convince a substantial portion of the French civil ser-\nvice and military.) \nThis is the essence of politics. Politics is that dimension of so-\ncial life in which things really do become true if enough people \nbelieve them. The problem is that in order to play the game ef-\nfectively, one can never acknowledge its essence. No king would \nopenly admit he is king just because people think he is. Political \npower has to be constantly recreated by persuading others to rec-\nognize one’s power; to do so, one pretty much invariably has to \nconvince them that one’s power has some basis other than their \nrecognition. That basis may be almost anything – divine grace, \ncharacter, genealogy, national destiny. But “make me your leader \nbecause if you do, I will be your leader” is not in itself a particu-\nlarly compelling argument. \nIn this sense politics is very similar to magic, which in most \ntimes and places – as I discovered in Madagascar – is simultane-\nously recognized as something that works because people believe \nthat it works; but also, that only works because people do not be-\nlieve it works only because people believe it works. This why mag-\nic, from ancient Thessaly to the contemporary Trobriand Islands, \nalways seems to dwell in an uncertain territory somewhere be-\ntween poetic expression and outright fraud. And of course the \nsame can usually be said of politics. \nIf so, for the art world to recognize itself as a form of politics \nis also to recognize itself as something both magical, and a confi-\ndence game – a kind of scam. \nSuch then is the nature of the permanent crisis.

What’s \nmore, the market value of their work is dependent on the percep-\ntion that it was produced in the pursuit of something other than \nmarket value. People argue endlessly about what that “something \nother” is – beauty, inspiration, virtuosity, aesthetic form – I would \nmyself argue that nowadays, at least, it is impossible to say it is just \none thing, rather, art has become a field for play and experiment \nwith the very idea of value – but all pretty much agree that, were \nan artist to be seen as simply in it for the money, his work would \nbe worth less of it.\nI suspect this is a dilemma anyone might face, when trying to \nmaintain some kind of space of autonomy in the face of the mar-\nket. Those pursuing other forms of value can attempt to insulate \nthemselves from the market. They can come to some sort of ac-\ncommodation or even symbiosis. Or they can end up in a situation \nwhere each side sees itself as ripping the other off. \nWhat I really want to emphasize though is that none of this \nmeans that any of these spaces are any less real.

For two hundred years at least, artists and those drawn to \nthem have created enclaves where it has been possible to experi-\nment with forms of work, exchange, and production radically dif-\nferent from those promoted by capital. While they are not always \nself-consciously revolutionary, artistic circles have had a persis-\ntent tendency to overlap with revolutionary circles; presumably, \nprecisely because these have been spaces where people can exper-\niment with radically different, less alienated forms of life. The fact \nthat all this is made possible by money percolating downwards \nfrom finance capital does not make such spaces “ultimately” a \nproduct of capitalism any more than the fact a privately owned \nfactory uses state-supplied and regulated utilities and postal ser-\nvices, relies on police to protect its property and courts to enforce \nits contracts, makes the cars they turn out “ultimately” products \nof socialism.

Really it is only the crudest sort of preliminary sketch. \nBut it’s already a thousand times more concrete than anything yet \nproduced by theorists of immaterial labor.\nGranted, Continental theory has a notorious tendency to float \nabove the surface of things, only rarely touching down in empirical \nreality – an approach perhaps first perfected by Jean Baudrillard, \nwho could write whole essays where all the agents and objects \nwere abstractions (“Death confronts The Social”) and presum-\nably half the fun is supposed to be trying to figure out what – if \nanything – this might actually mean for anyone’s actual life. But \nBaudrillard, by the end of his life, was essentially an entertainer. \nThis work purports to be more serious. Lazzarato has a particu-\nlarly annoying habit of insisting his concepts emerge from a large \nbody of recent “empirical research” – research which he never, \nhowever, cites or specifically refers to.

It assumes that \nNegri and Lazzarato are to be judged as social theorists, in the \nsense that their work is meant primarily to develop concepts that \ncan be useful in understanding the current state of capitalism or \nthe forms of resistance ranged against it, or at any rate that it can \nbe judged primarily on the degree to which can do so.

But I don’t think this was ever their primary aim. \nThey are first and foremost prophets.\nProphecy of course existed long before social theory proper \nand in many ways anticipated it. In the Abrahamic tradition that \nruns from Judaism through Christianity to Islam, prophets are not \nsimply people who speak of future events. They are people who \nprovide revelation of hidden truths about the world, which may \ninclude knowledge of events yet to come to pass, but need not \nnecessarily. One could argue that both revolutionary thought, and \ncritical social theory, both have their origins in prophecy. At the \nsame time, prophecy is clearly a form of politics. This is not only \nbecause prophets were invariably concerned with social justice. \nIt was because they created social movements, even, new societ-\nies. As Spinoza emphasized, it was the prophets who effectively \nproduced the Hebrew people, by creating a framework for their \nhistory. Negri has always been quite up front about his own de-\nsire to play a similar role for what he likes to call “the multitude.” \nHe is less interested in describing realities than in bringing them \ninto being. A political discourse, he says, should “aspire to ful-\nfill a Spinozist prophetic function, the function of an immanent \ndesire that organizes the multitude.”5 The same could be said of \ntheories of immaterial labor. They’re not really descriptive. For its \nmost ardent proponents, immaterial labor is really important be-\ncause it’s seen to represent a new form of communism: ways of \ncreating value by forms of social cooperation so dispersed that \njust about everyone could be said to take part, much as they do \n5\t Empire, p. 66.\n",

They might not have had much to say about specific \nworks of art or specific forms of labor, but each provided a de-\ntailed assessment of where we stood in history. For Lazzarato the \nsignificant thing was that we had moved from a society of disci-\npline to one of security; for Revel, what was really important was \nthe move from formal to real subsumption of labor under capi-\ntal. For Bifo, we had moved from an age of conjunction to one of \nconnection; for Negri, the new stage of contemporaneity that had \nreplaced post-modernism.

In the world of fashion, of course, \nit’s possible to generate a sense of novelty simply by playing around \nwith formal qualities: color, patterns, styles, and hemlines.

Hence the a \npermanent need to conjure up a sense that we are in a profoundly \nnew historical moment, even if art theorists attempting such an \nact of conjuration often seem to find themselves with less and less \nto work with.\nThere is another reason, I think, why revolutionary thinkers are \nparticularly well suited to such a task. One can come to under-\nstand it, I think, by examining what would otherwise seem to be \na profound contradiction in the all of the speakers’ approaches to \nhistory. In each case, we are presented with a series of historical \nstages: from societies of discipline to societies of security, from \nconjunction to connection, etc. We are not dealing with a series of \ncomplete conceptual breaks; at least, no one seems to imagine that \nis impossible to understand any one stage from the perspective of \n",

But oddly, all of the speakers in question sub-\nscribed to the theory that history should be conceived as a series \nof complete conceptual breaks, so total, in fact, that it’s hard to see \nhow this would be possible. In part this is the legacy of Marxism, \nwhich always tends to insist that since capitalism forms an all-en-\ncompassing totality that shapes our most basic assumptions about \nthe nature of society, morality, politics, value, and almost every-\nthing else, we simply cannot conceive what a future society would \nbe like. (Though no Marxist, oddly, seems to think we should \ntherefore have similar problems trying to understand the past.) In \nthis case, though, it is just as much the legacy of Michel Foucault,6 \nwho radicalized this notion of a series of all-encompassing histori-\ncal stages even further with his notion of epistemes: that the very \nconception of truth changes completely from one historical peri-\nod to the next. Here, too, each historical period forms such a total \nsystem that it is impossible to imagine one gradually transforming \ninto another; instead, we have a series of conceptual revolutions, \nof total breaks or ruptures. \nAll of the speakers at the conference were drawing, in one way \nanother, on both the Marxian and Foucauldian traditions – and \nsome of the terms used for historical stages (“real subsumption,” \n“societies of discipline”…) drew explicitly on one or the other. Thus \nall of them were faced with the same conceptual problem. How \ncould it be possible to come up with such a typology? How is it \npossible for someone trapped inside one historical period to be \nable to grasp the overall structure of history through which one \nstage replaces the other? \nThe prophet of course has an answer to this question. Just as we \ncan only grasp an individual’s life as a story once he is dead, it is \nonly from the perspective of the end of time that we can grasp the \nstory of history. It doesn’t matter that we do not really know what \nthe messianic Future will be like: it can still serve as Archimedean \npoint, the Time Outside Time about which we can know nothing \nbut that nonetheless makes knowledge possible. \nOf course, Bifo was explicitly arguing that the Future is dead. \nThe twentieth century, he insisted, had been “century of the future” \n6\t Really, I would say, it is the legacy of Structuralism.

The socialist leadership embraced the consumer \nparadise offered by their bourgeois enemies; yet they wished to \nmanage the productive system themselves; anarchists, in contrast, \nwanted time in which to live, to pursue (to cast it in perhaps inap-\npropriately Marxian terms) forms of value of which the capitalists \ncould not even dream. Yet where did the revolutions happen? As \nwe all know from the great Marx-Bakunin controversy, it was the \nanarchist constituencies – precisely, those who rejected consumer \nvalues – that actually rose up: the whether in Spain, Russia, China, \nNicaragua, or for that matter, Algeria or Mozambique. Yet in ev-\nery case they ended up under the administration of socialist bu-\nreaucrats who embraced that ethos of productivism, that dream \nof consumer utopia, even though this was the last thing they were \never going to be able to provide. The irony became that the prin-\nciple social benefit the Soviet Union and similar regimes actually \nwas able to provide – more time, since work discipline becomes \na completely different thing when one effectively cannot be fired \nfrom one’s job – was precisely the one they couldn’t acknowledge; \nit had to be referred to as “the problem of absenteeism” stand-\ning in the way of an impossible future full of shoes and consumer \n",

It’s a moral one. It’s pretty \nobvious that there are many circumstances where, even from an \neconomists’ perspective, too much work is precisely the problem. \nYet every time there is a crisis, the answer on all sides is always \nthe same: people need to work more!

As a result it was an ideological triumph \nand an economic catastrophe.

Neoliberalism was the system that \nmanaged to convince everyone in the world that financial elites \nwere the only people capable of managing or measuring the value \nof anything, even as in order to do so, it ended up promulgating \nan economic culture so irresponsible that it allowed those elites \nto bring the entire financial architecture of the global economy \ntumbling on top of them because of their utter inability to assess \nthe value even of their own financial instruments. Again, this was \nno accident. The pattern is consistent. Whenever there is a choice \nbetween the political goal of demobilizing social movements, or \nconvincing the public there is no viable alternative to the capitalist \norder, and actually running a viable capitalist order, neoliberalism \nmeans always choosing the former. \nAlmost all its claims are lies.

It might help to start by acknowl-\nedging that we are all workers insofar as we are creative, and resist \nwork, and also refuse to play the role of the administrators – that \nis, those who try to reduce every aspect of life to calculable val-\nue. That means trying to understand the true nature of the global \nwork machine, the real relation of those domains of life artificially \nseparated into “economics.” “politics,” and “ecology.” The relation \nbetween oil and money actually provides a striking illustration. \nHow is it that we have come to treat money, which after all is noth-\ning but a social relation, and therefore infinitely expandable, as \nif it were a limited resource like petroleum (“we must cut social \nservices because we simply don’t have the money”), and oil, which \nactually is a limited resource, as if it were money – as something \nto be freely spent to generate ever-increasing economic activity, \nas if there would never be an end to it?

It is such arrangements that allow us to \npretend that money is some kind of physical substance, that debts \nare not simply promises – which would mean that a government’s \npromise to pay investors at a certain rate of interest has no greater \nmoral standard than, say, their promise to allow workers to retire \nat a certain age, or not to destroy the planet), but as some kind \nof inexorable moral absolute. Yet it’s this very tyranny of debt – \non every level – that becomes the moral imperative that forces \noil from the earth and convinces us that the only solution to any \nmoral crisis is to convert yet another portion of free human life \ninto labor. \n",

But in the middle of the last\ncentury, particularly in the late sixties and early seventies, the word was\neverywhere. There were sociological tomes with grandiose titles like _A\nGeneral Theory of Bureaucracy_ ,[1](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn1) _The\nPolitics of Bureaucracy_ ,[2](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn2) or even _The\nBureaucratization of the World_ ,[3](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn3) and\npopular paperback screeds with titles like _Parkinson’s Law_\n,[4](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn4) _The Peter Principle_\n,[5](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn5) or _Bureaucrats: How to Annoy\nThem_.[6](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn6) There were Kafkaesque novels, and\nsatirical films. Everyone seemed to feel that the foibles and absurdities of\nbureaucratic life and bureaucratic procedures were one of the defining\nfeatures of modern existence, and as such, eminently worth discussing. But\nsince the seventies, there has been a peculiar falling off.\n\nConsider, for example, the following table, which diagrams how frequently the\nword “bureaucracy” appears in books written in English over the last century\nand a half. A subject of only moderate interest until the postwar period, it\nshoots into prominence starting in the fifties and then, after a pinnacle in\n1973, begins a slow but inexorable decline.\n\n![](../images/00007.jpeg)\n\nWhy? Well, one obvious reason is that we’ve just become accustomed to it.\nBureaucracy has become the water in which we swim. Now let’s imagine another\ngraph, one that simply documented the average number of hours per year a\ntypical American—or a Briton, or an inhabitant of Thailand—spent filling out\nforms or otherwise fulfilling purely bureaucratic obligations. (Needless to\nsay, the overwhelming majority of these obligations no longer involve actual,\nphysical paper.) This graph would almost certainly show a line much like the\none in the first graph—a slow climb until 1973. But here the two graphs would\ndiverge—rather than falling back, the line would continue to climb; if\nanything, it would do so more precipitously, tracking how, in the late\ntwentieth century, middle-class citizens spent ever more hours struggling with\nphone trees and web interfaces, while the less fortunate spent ever more hours\nof their day trying to jump through the increasingly elaborate hoops required\nto gain access to dwindling social services.\n\nI imagine such a graph would look something like this:\n\n![](../images/00008.jpeg)\n\nThis is not a graph of hours spent on paperwork, just of how often the word\n“paperwork” has been used in English-language books. But absent time machines\nthat could allow us to carry out a more direct investigation, this is about as\nclose as we’re likely to get.\n\nBy the way, most similar paperwork-related terms yield almost identical\nresults:\n\n![](../images/00009.jpeg)\n\nThe essays assembled in this volume are all, in one way or another, about this\ndisparity. We no longer like to think about bureaucracy, yet it informs every\naspect of our existence. It’s as if, as a planetary civilization, we have\ndecided to clap our hands over our ears and start humming whenever the topic\ncomes up. Insofar as we are even willing to discuss it, it’s still in the\nterms popular in the sixties and early seventies. The social movements of the\nsixties were, on the whole, left-wing in inspiration, but they were also\nrebellions against bureaucracy, or, to put it more accurately, rebellions\nagainst the bureaucratic mindset, against the soul-destroying conformity of\nthe postwar welfare states. In the face of the gray functionaries of both\nstate-capitalist and state-socialist regimes, sixties rebels stood for\nindividual expression and spontaneous conviviality, and against (“rules and\nregulations, who needs them?”) every form of social control.\n\nWith the collapse of the old welfare states, all this has come to seem\ndecidedly quaint. As the language of antibureaucratic individualism has been\nadopted, with increasing ferocity, by the Right, which insists on “market\nsolutions” to every social problem, the mainstream Left has increasingly\nreduced itself to fighting a kind of pathetic rearguard action, trying to\nsalvage remnants of the old welfare state: it has acquiesced with—often even\nspearheaded—attempts to make government efforts more “efficient” through the\npartial privatization of services and the incorporation of ever-more “market\nprinciples,” “market incentives,” and market-based “accountability processes”\ninto the structure of the bureaucracy itself.\n\nThe result is a political catastrophe. There’s really no other way to put it.\nWhat is presented as the “moderate” Left solution to any social problems—and\nradical left solutions are, almost everywhere now, ruled out _tout court_ —has\ninvariably come to be some nightmare fusion of the worst elements of\nbureaucracy and the worst elements of capitalism. It’s as if someone had\nconsciously tried to create the least appealing possible political position.\nIt is a testimony to the genuine lingering power of leftist ideals that anyone\nwould even consider voting for a party that promoted this sort of\nthing—because surely, if they do, it’s not because they actually think these\nare good policies, but because these are the only policies anyone who\nidentifies themselves as left-of-center is allowed to set forth.\n\nIs there any wonder, then, that every time there is a social crisis, it is the\nRight, rather than the Left, which becomes the venue for the expression of\npopular anger?\n\nThe Right, at least, _has_ a critique of bureaucracy. It’s not a very good\none. But at least it exists. The Left has none. As a result, when those who\nidentify with the Left do have anything negative to say about bureaucracy,\nthey are usually forced to adopt a watered-down version of the right-wing\ncritique.[7](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn7)\n\nThis right-wing critique can be disposed of fairly quickly. It has its origins\nin nineteenth-century liberalism.[8](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn8) The\nstory that emerged in middle-class circles in Europe in the wake of the French\nrevolution was that the civilized world was experiencing a gradual, uneven,\nbut inevitable transformation away from the rule of warrior elites, with their\nauthoritarian governments, their priestly dogmas, and their caste-like\nstratification, to one of liberty, equality, and enlightened commercial self-\ninterest. The mercantile classes in the Middle Ages undermined the old feudal\norder like termites munching from below—termites, yes, but the good kind. The\npomp and splendor of the absolutist states that were being overthrown were,\naccording to the liberal version of history, the last gasps of the old order,\nwhich would end as states gave way to markets, religious faith to scientific\nunderstanding, and fixed orders and statuses of Marquis and Baronesses and the\nlike to free contracts between individuals.\n\nThe emergence of modern bureaucracies was always something of a problem for\nthis story because it didn’t really fit. In principle, all these stuffy\nfunctionaries in their offices, with their elaborate chains of command, should\nhave been mere feudal holdovers, soon to go the way of the armies and officer\ncorps that everyone was expecting to gradually become unnecessary as well. One\nneed only flip open a Russian novel from the late nineteenth century: all the\nscions of old aristocratic families—in fact, almost everyone in those\nbooks—had been transformed into either military officers or civil servants (no\none of any notice seems to do anything else), and the military and civil\nhierarchies seemed to have nearly identical ranks, titles, and sensibilities.\nBut there was an obvious problem. If bureaucrats were just holdovers, why was\nit that everywhere—not just in backwaters like Russia but in booming\nindustrial societies like England and Germany—every year seemed to bring more\nand more of them?\n\nThere followed stage two of the argument, which was, in its essence, that\nbureaucracy represents an inherent flaw in the democratic\nproject.[9](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn9) Its greatest exponent was Ludwig\nvon Mises, an exiled Austrian aristocrat, whose 1944 book _Bureaucracy_ argued\nthat by definition, systems of government administration could never organize\ninformation with anything like the efficiency of impersonal market pricing\nmechanisms. However, extending the vote to the losers of the economic game\nwould inevitably lead to calls for government intervention, framed as high-\nminded schemes for trying to solve social problems through administrative\nmeans. Von Mises was willing to admit that many of those who embraced such\nsolutions were entirely well-meaning; however, their efforts could only make\nmatters worse. In fact, he felt they would ultimately end up destroying the\npolitical basis of democracy itself, since the administrators of social\nprograms would inevitably form power-blocs far more influential than the\npoliticians elected to run the government, and support ever-more radical\nreforms. Von Mises argued that as a result, the social welfare states then\nemerging in places like France or England, let alone Denmark or Sweden, would,\nwithin a generation or two, inevitably lead to fascism.\n\nIn this view, the rise of bureaucracy was the ultimate example of good\nintentions run amok. Ronald Reagan probably made the most effective popular\ndeployment of this line of thought with his famous claim that, “the nine most\nterrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m\nhere to help.’ ”\n\nThe problem with all this is that it bears very little relation to what\nactually happened. First of all, historically, markets simply did not emerge\nas some autonomous domain of freedom independent of, and opposed to, state\nauthorities. Exactly the opposite is the case. Historically, markets are\ngenerally either a side effect of government operations, especially military\noperations, or were directly created by government policy. This has been true\nat least since the invention of coinage, which was first created and\npromulgated as a means of provisioning soldiers; for most of Eurasian history,\nordinary people used informal credit arrangements and physical money, gold,\nsilver, bronze, and the kind of impersonal markets they made possible remained\nmainly an adjunct to the mobilization of legions, sacking of cities,\nextraction of tribute, and disposing of loot. Modern central banking systems\nwere likewise first created to finance wars. So there’s one initial problem\nwith the conventional history. There’s another even more dramatic one. While\nthe idea that the market is somehow opposed to and independent of government\nhas been used at least at least since the nineteenth century to justify\nlaissez faire economic policies designed to lessen the role of government,\nthey never actually have that effect. English liberalism, for instance, did\nnot lead to a reduction of state bureaucracy, but the exact opposite: an\nendlessly ballooning array of legal clerks, registrars, inspectors, notaries,\nand police officials who made the liberal dream of a world of free contract\nbetween autonomous individuals possible. It turned out that maintaining a free\nmarket economy required a thousand times more paperwork than a Louis XIV-style\nabsolutist monarchy.\n\nThis apparent paradox—that government policies intending to reduce government\ninterference in the economy actually end up producing more regulations, more\nbureaucrats, and more police—can be observed so regularly that I think we are\njustified in treating it as a general sociological law. I propose to call it\n“the iron law of liberalism”:\n\n**The Iron Law of Liberalism** states that any market reform, any government\ninitiative intended to reduce red tape and promote market forces will have the\nultimate effect of increasing the total number of regulations, the total\namount of paperwork, and the total number of bureaucrats the government\nemploys.\n\nFrench sociologist Emile Durkheim was already observing this tendency at the\nturn of the twentieth century,[10](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn10) and\neventually, it became impossible to ignore. By the middle of the century, even\nright-wing critics like von Mises were willing to admit—at least in their\nacademic writing—that markets don’t really regulate themselves, and that an\narmy of administrators was indeed required to keep any market system going.\n(For von Mises, that army only became problematic when it was deployed to\nalter market outcomes that caused undue suffering for the\npoor.)[11](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn11) Still, right-wing populists soon\nrealized that, whatever the realities, making a target of bureaucrats was\nalmost always effective. Hence, in their public pronouncements, the\ncondemnation of what U.S. governor George Wallace, in his 1968 campaign for\nPresident, first labeled “pointy-headed bureaucrats” living off hardworking\ncitizens’ taxes, was unrelenting.\n\nWallace is actually a crucial figure here. Nowadays, Americans mainly remember\nhim as a failed reactionary, or even a snarling lunatic: the last die-hard\nSouthern segregationist standing with an axe outside a public school door. But\nin terms of his broader legacy, he could just as well be represented as a kind\nof political genius. He was, after all, the first politician to create a\nnational platform for a kind of right-wing populism that was soon to prove so\ninfectious that by now, a generation later, it has come to be adopted by\npretty much everyone, across the political spectrum. As a result, amongst\nworking-class Americans, government is now generally seen as being made up of\ntwo sorts of people: “politicians,” who are blustering crooks and liars but\ncan at least occasionally be voted out of office, and “bureaucrats,” who are\ncondescending elitists almost impossible to uproot. There is assumed to be a\nkind of tacit alliance between what came to be seen as the parasitical poor\n(in America usually pictured in overtly racist terms) and the equally\nparasitical self-righteous officials whose existence depends on subsidizing\nthe poor using other people’s money. Again, even the mainstream Left—or what\nit is supposed to pass for a Left these days—has come to offer little more\nthan a watered-down version of this right-wing language. Bill Clinton, for\ninstance, had spent so much of his career bashing civil servants that after\nthe Oklahoma City bombing, he actually felt moved to remind Americans that\npublic servants were human beings unto themselves, and promised never to use\nthe word “bureaucrat” again.[12](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn12)\n\nIn contemporary American populism—and increasingly, in the rest of the world\nas well—there can be only one alternative to “bureaucracy,” and that is “the\nmarket.” Sometimes this is held to mean that government should be run more\nlike a business. Sometimes it is held to mean we should simply get the\nbureaucrats out of the way and let nature take its course, which means letting\npeople attend to the business of their lives untrammelled by endless rules and\nregulations imposed on them from above, and so allowing the magic of the\nmarketplace to provide its own solutions.\n\n“Democracy” thus came to mean the market; “bureaucracy,” in turn, government\ninterference with the market; and this is pretty much what the word continues\nto mean to this day.\n\nIt wasn’t always so. The rise of the modern corporation, in the late\nnineteenth century, was largely seen at the time as a matter of applying\nmodern, bureaucratic techniques to the private sector—and these techniques\nwere assumed to be required, when operating on a large scale, because they\nwere more efficient than the networks of personal or informal connections that\nhad dominated a world of small family firms. The pioneers of these new,\nprivate bureaucracies were the United States and Germany, and Max Weber, the\nGerman sociologist, observed that Americans in his day were particularly\ninclined to see public and private bureaucracies as essentially the same\nanimal:\n\nThe body of officials actively engaged in a “public” office, along with the\nrespective apparatus of material implements and the files, make up a “bureau.”\nIn private enterprise, “the bureau” is often called “the office” …\n\nIt is the peculiarity of the modern entrepreneur that he conducts himself as\nthe “first official” of his corporation, in the very same way in which the\nruler of a specifically modern bureaucratic state spoke of himself as “the\nfirst servant” of the state. The idea that the bureau activities of the state\nare intrinsically different in character from the management of private\neconomic offices is a continental European notion and, by way of contrast, is\ntotally foreign to the American way.[13](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn13)\n\nIn other words, around the turn of the century, rather than anyone complaining\nthat government should be run more like a business, Americans simply assumed\nthat governments and business—or big business, at any rate—were run the same\nway.\n\nTrue, for much of the nineteenth century, the United States was largely an\neconomy of small family firms and high finance—much like Britain’s at the\ntime. But America’s advent as a power on the world stage at the end of the\ncentury corresponded to the rise of a distinctly American form:\ncorporate—bureaucratic—capitalism. As Giovanni Arrighi pointed out, an\nanalogous corporate model was emerging at the same time in Germany, and the\ntwo countries—the United States and Germany—ended up spending most of the\nfirst half of the next century battling over which would take over from the\ndeclining British empire and establish its own vision for a global economic\nand political order. We all know who won. Arrighi makes another interesting\npoint here. Unlike the British Empire, which had taken its free market\nrhetoric seriously, eliminating its own protective tariffs with the famous\nAnti–Corn Law Bill of 1846, neither the German or American regimes had ever\nbeen especially interested in free trade. The Americans in particular were\nmuch more concerned with creating structures of international administration.\nThe very first thing the United States did, on officially taking over the\nreins from Great Britain after World War II, was to set up the world’s first\ngenuinely planetary bureaucratic institutions in the United Nations and the\nBretton Woods institutions—the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and\nGATT, later to become the WTO. The British Empire had never attempted anything\nlike this. They either conquered other nations, or traded with them. The\nAmericans attempted to administer everything and everyone.\n\nBritish people, I’ve observed, are quite proud that they are not especially\nskilled at bureaucracy; Americans, in contrast, seem embarrassed by the fact\nthat on the whole, they’re really quite good at\nit.[14](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn14) It doesn’t fit the American self-\nimage. We’re supposed to be self-reliant individualists. (This is precisely\nwhy the right-wing populist demonization of bureaucrats is so effective.) Yet\nthe fact remains the United States is—and for a well over a century has been—a\nprofoundly bureaucratic society. The reason it is so easy to overlook is\nbecause most American bureaucratic habits and sensibilities—from the clothing\nto the language to the design of forms and offices—emerged from the private\nsector. When novelists and sociologists described the “Organization Man,” or\n“the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,” the soullessly conformist U.S. equivalent\nto the Soviet apparatchik, they were not talking about functionaries in the\nDepartment of Landmarks and Preservation or the Social Security\nAdministration—they were describing corporate middle management. True, by that\ntime, corporate bureaucrats were not actually being _called_ bureaucrats. But\nthey were still setting the standard for what administrative functionaries\nwere supposed to be like.\n\nThe impression that the word “bureaucrat” should be treated as a synonym for\n“civil servant” can be traced back to the New Deal in the thirties, which was\nalso the moment when bureaucratic structures and techniques first became\ndramatically visible in many ordinary people’s lives. But in fact, from the\nvery beginning, Roosevelt’s New Dealers worked in close coordination with the\nbattalions of lawyers, engineers, and corporate bureaucrats employed by firms\nlike Ford, Coca Cola, or Proctor & Gamble, absorbing much of their style and\nsensibilities, and—as the United States shifted to war footing in the\nforties—so did the gargantuan bureaucracy of the U.S. military. And, of\ncourse, the United States has never really gone off war footing ever since.\nStill, through these means, the word “bureaucrat” came to attach itself almost\nexclusively to civil servants: even if what they do all day is sit at desks,\nfill out forms, and file reports, neither middle managers nor military\nofficers are ever quite considered bureaucrats. (Neither for that matter are\npolice, or employees of the NSA.)\n\nIn the United States, the lines between public and private have long been\nblurry. The American military, for example, is famous for its revolving\ndoor—high-ranking officers involved in procurement regularly end up on the\nboards of corporations that operate on military contracts. On a broader level,\nthe need to preserve certain domestic industries for military purposes, and to\ndevelop others, has allowed the U.S. government to engage in practically\nSoviet-style industrial planning without ever having to admit it’s doing so.\nAfter all, pretty much anything, from maintaining a certain number of steel\nplants, to doing the initial research to set up the Internet, can be justified\non grounds of military preparedness. Yet again, since this kind of planning\noperates via an alliance between military bureaucrats and corporate\nbureaucrats, it’s never perceived as something bureaucratic at all.\n\nStill, with the rise of the financial sector, things have reached a\nqualitatively different level—one where it is becoming almost impossible to\nsay what is public and what is private. This is not just due to the much-noted\noutsourcing of one-time government functions to private corporations. Above\nall, it’s due to the way the private corporations themselves have come to\noperate.\n\nLet me give an example. A few weeks ago, I spent several hours on the phone\nwith Bank of America, trying to work out how to get access to my account\ninformation from overseas. This involved speaking to four different\nrepresentatives, two referrals to nonexistent numbers, three long explanations\nof complicated and apparently arbitrary rules, and two failed attempts to\nchange outdated address and phone number information lodged on various\ncomputer systems. In other words, it was the very definition of a bureaucratic\nrunaround. (Neither was I able, when it was all over, to actually access my\naccount.)\n\nNow, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that, were I to actually\nlocate a bank manager and demand to know how such things could happen, he or\nshe would immediately insist that the bank was not to blame—that it was all an\neffect of an arcane maze of government regulations. However, I am equally\nconfident that, were it possible to investigate how these regulations came\nabout, one would find that they were composed jointly by aides to legislators\non some banking committee and lobbyists and attorneys employed by the banks\nthemselves, in a process greased by generous contributions to the coffers of\nthose same legislators’ reelection campaigns. And the same would be true of\nanything from credit ratings, insurance premiums, mortgage applications, to,\nfor that matter, the process of buying an airline ticket, applying for a scuba\nlicense, or trying to requisition an ergonomic chair for one’s office in an\nostensibly private university. The vast majority of the paperwork we do exists\nin just this sort of in-between zone—ostensibly private, but in fact entirely\nshaped by a government that provides the legal framework, underpins the rules\nwith its courts and all of the elaborate mechanisms of enforcement that come\nwith them, but—crucially—works closely with the private concerns to ensure\nthat the results will guarantee a certain rate of private profit.\n\nIn cases like this the language we employ—derived as it is from the right-wing\ncritique—is completely inadequate. It tells us nothing about what is actually\ngoing on.[15](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn15)\n\nConsider the word “deregulation.” In today’s political discourse,\n“deregulation” is—like “reform”—almost invariably treated as a good thing.\nDeregulation means less bureaucratic meddling, and fewer rules and regulations\nstifling innovation and commerce. This usage puts those on the left-hand side\nof the political spectrum in an awkward position, since opposing\nderegulation—even, pointing out that it was an orgy of this very\n“deregulation” that led to the banking crisis of 2008—seems to imply a desire\nfor more rules and regulations, and therefore, more gray men in suits standing\nin the way of freedom and innovation and generally telling people what to do.\n\nBut this debate is based on false premises. Let’s go back to banks. There’s no\nsuch thing as an “unregulated” bank. Nor could there be. Banks are\ninstitutions to which the government has granted the power to create money—or,\nto be slightly more technical about it, the right to issue IOUs that the\ngovernment will recognize as legal tender, and, therefore, accept in payment\nof taxes and to discharge other debts within its own national territory.\nObviously no government is about to grant anyone—least of all a profit-seeking\nfirm—the power to create as much money as they like under any circumstances.\nThat would be insane. The power to create money is one that, by definition,\ngovernments can only grant under carefully circumscribed (read: regulated)\nconditions. And indeed this is what we always find: government regulates\neverything from a bank’s reserve requirements to its hours of operation; how\nmuch it can charge in interest, fees, and penalties; what sort of security\nprecautions it can or must employ; how its records must be kept and reported;\nhow and when it must inform its clients of their rights and responsibilities;\nand pretty much everything else.\n\nSo what are people actually referring to when they talk about “deregulation”?\nIn ordinary usage, the word seems to mean “changing the regulatory structure\nin a way that I like.” In practice this can refer to almost anything. In the\ncase of airlines or telecommunications in the seventies and eighties, it meant\nchanging the system of regulation from one that encouraged a few large firms\nto one that fostered carefully supervised competition between midsize firms.\nIn the case of banking, “deregulation” has usually meant exactly the opposite:\nmoving away from a situation of managed competition between midsized firms to\none where a handful of financial conglomerates are allowed to completely\ndominate the market. This is what makes the term so handy. Simply by labeling\na new regulatory measure “deregulation,” you can frame it in the public mind\nas a way to reduce bureaucracy and set individual initiative free, even if the\nresult is a fivefold increase in the actual number of forms to be filled in,\nreports to be filed, rules and regulations for lawyers to interpret, and\nofficious people in offices whose entire job seems to be to provide convoluted\nexplanations for why you’re not allowed to do\nthings.[16](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn16)\n\nThis process—the gradual fusion of public and private power into a single\nentity, rife with rules and regulations whose ultimate purpose is to extract\nwealth in the form of profits—does not yet have a name. That in itself is\nsignificant. These things can happen largely because we lack a way to talk\nabout them. But one can see its effects in every aspect of our lives. It fills\nour days with paperwork. Application forms get longer and more elaborate.\nOrdinary documents like bills or tickets or memberships in sports or book\nclubs come to be buttressed by pages of legalistic fine print.\n\nI’m going to make up a name. I’m going to call this the age of “total\nbureaucratization.” (I was tempted to call this the age of “predatory\nbureaucratization” but it’s really the all-encompassing nature of the beast I\nwant to highlight here.) It had its first stirrings, one might say, just at\nthe point where public discussion of bureaucracy began to fall off in the late\nseventies, and it began to get seriously under way in the eighties. But it\ntruly took off in the nineties.\n\nIn an earlier book, I suggested that the fundamental historical break that\nushered in our current economic regime occurred in 1971, the date that the\nU.S. dollar went off the gold standard. This is what paved the way first for\nthe financialization of capitalism, but ultimately, for much more profound\nlong-term changes that I suspect will ultimately spell the end of capitalism\nentirely. I still think that. But here we are speaking of much more short-term\neffects. What did financialization mean for the deeply bureaucratized society\nthat was postwar America?[17](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn17)\n\nI think what happened is best considered as a kind of shift in class\nallegiances on the part of the managerial staff of major corporations, from an\nuneasy, de facto alliance with their own workers, to one with investors. As\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith long ago pointed out, if you create an organization\ngeared to produce perfumes, dairy products, or aircraft fuselages, those who\nmake it up will, if left to their own devices, tend to concentrate their\nefforts on producing more and better perfumes, dairy products, or aircraft\nfuselages, rather than thinking primarily of what will make the most money for\nthe shareholders. What’s more, since for most of the twentieth century, a job\nin a large bureaucratic mega-firm meant a lifetime promise of employment,\neveryone involved in the process—managers and workers alike—tended to see\nthemselves as sharing a certain common interest in this regard, over and\nagainst meddling owners and investors. This kind of solidarity across class\nlines even had a name: it was called “corporatism.” One mustn’t romanticize\nit. It was among other things the philosophical basis of fascism. Indeed, one\ncould well argue that fascism simply took the idea that workers and managers\nhad common interests, that organizations like corporations or communities\nformed organic wholes, and that financiers were an alien, parasitical force,\nand drove them to their ultimate, murderous extreme. Even in its more benign\nsocial democratic versions, in Europe or America, the attendant politics often\ncame tinged with chauvinism[18](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn18)—but they\nalso ensured that the investor class was always seen as to some extent\noutsiders, against whom white-collar and blue-collar workers could be\nconsidered, at least to some degree, to be united in a common front.\n\nFrom the perspective of sixties radicals, who regularly watched antiwar\ndemonstrations attacked by nationalist teamsters and construction workers, the\nreactionary implications of corporatism appeared self-evident. The corporate\nsuits and the well-paid, Archie Bunker elements of the industrial proletariat\nwere clearly on the same side. Unsurprising then that the left-wing critique\nof bureaucracy at the time focused on the ways that social democracy had more\nin common with fascism than its proponents cared to admit. Unsurprising, too,\nthat this critique seems utterly irrelevant\ntoday.[19](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn19)\n\nWhat began to happen in the seventies, and paved the way for what we see\ntoday, was a kind of strategic pivot of the upper echelons of U.S. corporate\nbureaucracy—away from the workers, and towards shareholders, and eventually,\ntowards the financial structure as a whole. The mergers and acquisitions,\ncorporate raiding, junk bonds, and asset stripping that began under Reagan and\nThatcher and culminated in the rise of private equity firms were merely some\nof the more dramatic early mechanisms through which this shift of allegiance\nworked itself out. In fact, there was a double movement: corporate management\nbecame more financialized, but at the same time, the financial sector became\ncorporatized, with investment banks, hedge funds, and the like largely\nreplacing individual investors. As a result the investor class and the\nexecutive class became almost indistinguishable. (Think here of the term\n“financial management,” which came to refer simultaneously to how the highest\nranks of the corporate bureaucracy ran their firms, and how investors managed\ntheir portfolios.) Before long, heroic CEOs were being lionized in the media,\ntheir success largely measured by the number of employees they could fire. By\nthe nineties, lifetime employment, even for white-collar workers, had become a\nthing of the past. When corporations wished to win loyalty, they increasingly\ndid it by paying their employees in stock\noptions.[20](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn20)\n\nAt the same time, the new credo was that everyone should look at the world\nthrough the eyes of an investor—that’s why, in the eighties, newspapers began\nfiring their labor reporters, but ordinary TV news reports came to be\naccompanied by crawls at the bottom of the screen displaying the latest stock\nquotes. The common cant was that through participation in personal retirement\nfunds and investment funds of one sort or another, everyone would come to own\na piece of capitalism. In reality, the magic circle was only really widened to\ninclude the higher paid professionals and the corporate bureaucrats\nthemselves.\n\nStill, that extension was extremely important. No political revolution can\nsucceed without allies, and bringing along a certain portion of the middle\nclass—and, even more crucially, convincing the bulk of the middle classes that\nthey had some kind of stake in finance-driven capitalism—was critical.\nUltimately, the more liberal members of this professional-managerial elite\nbecame the social base for what came to pass as “left-wing” political parties,\nas actual working-class organizations like trade unions were cast into the\nwilderness. (Hence, the U.S. Democratic Party, or New Labour in Great Britain,\nwhose leaders engage in regular ritual acts of public abjuration of the very\nunions that have historically formed their strongest base of support). These\nwere of course people who already tended to work in thoroughly bureaucratized\nenvironments, whether schools, hospitals, or corporate law firms. The actual\nworking class, who bore a traditional loathing for such characters, either\ndropped out of politics entirely, or were increasingly reduced to casting\nprotest votes for the radical Right.[21](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn21)\n\nThis was not just a political realignment. It was a cultural transformation.\nAnd it set the stage for the process whereby the bureaucratic techniques\n(performance reviews, focus groups, time allocation surveys …) developed in\nfinancial and corporate circles came to invade the rest of society—education,\nscience, government—and eventually, to pervade almost every aspect of everyday\nlife. One can best trace the process, perhaps, by following its language.\nThere is a peculiar idiom that first emerged in such circles, full of bright,\nempty terms like vision, quality, stakeholder, leadership, excellence,\ninnovation, strategic goals, or best practices. (Much of it traces back to\n“self-actualization” movements like Lifespring, Mind Dynamics, and EST, which\nwere extremely popular in corporate boardrooms in the seventies, but it\nquickly became a language unto itself.) Now, imagine it would be possible to\ncreate a map of some major city, and then place one tiny blue dot on the\nlocation of every document that uses at least three of these words. Then\nimagine that we could watch it change over time. We would be able to observe\nthis new corporate bureaucratic culture spread like blue stains in a petri\ndish, starting in the financial districts, on to boardrooms, then government\noffices and universities, then, finally, engulfing any location where any\nnumber of people gather to discuss the allocation of resources of any kind at\nall.\n\nFor all its celebration of markets and individual initiative, this alliance of\ngovernment and finance often produces results that bear a striking resemblance\nto the worst excesses of bureaucratization in the former Soviet Union or\nformer colonial backwaters of the Global South. There is a rich\nanthropological literature, for instance, on the cult of certificates,\nlicenses, and diplomas in the former colonial world. Often the argument is\nthat in countries like Bangladesh, Trinidad, or Cameroon, which hover between\nthe stifling legacy of colonial domination and their own magical traditions,\nofficial credentials are seen as a kind of material fetish—magical objects\nconveying power in their own right, entirely apart from the real knowledge,\nexperience, or training they’re supposed to represent. But since the eighties,\nthe real explosion of credentialism has been in what are supposedly the most\n“advanced” economies, like the United States, Great Britain, or Canada. As one\nanthropologist, Sarah Kendzior, puts it:\n\n“The United States has become the most rigidly credentialised society in the\nworld,” write James Engell and Anthony Dangerfield in their 2005 book _Saving\nHigher Education in the Age of Money_. “A BA is required for jobs that by no\nstretch of imagination need two years of full-time training, let alone four.”\n\nThe promotion of college as a requirement for a middle-class life … has\nresulted in the exclusion of the non-college educated from professions of\npublic influence. In 1971, 58 percent of journalists had a college degree.\nToday, 92 percent do, and at many publications, a graduate degree in\njournalism is required—despite the fact that most renowned journalists have\nnever studied journalism.[22](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn22)\n\nJournalism is one of many fields of public influence—including politics—in\nwhich credentials function as _de facto_ permission to speak, rendering those\nwho lack them less likely to be employed and less able to afford to stay in\ntheir field. Ability is discounted without credentials, but the ability to\npurchase credentials rests, more often than not, on family\nwealth.[23](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn23)\n\nOne could repeat the story in field after field, from nurses to art teachers,\nphysical therapists to foreign policy consultants. Almost every endeavor that\nused to be considered an art (best learned through doing) now requires formal\nprofessional training and a certificate of completion, and this seems to be\nhappening, equally, in both the private and public sectors, since, as already\nnoted, in matters bureaucratic, such distinctions are becoming effectively\nmeaningless. While these measures are touted—as are all bureaucratic\nmeasures—as a way of creating fair, impersonal mechanisms in fields previously\ndominated by insider knowledge and social connections, the effect is often the\nopposite. As anyone who has been to graduate school knows, it’s precisely the\nchildren of the professional-managerial classes, those whose family resources\nmake them the least in need of financial support, who best know how to\nnavigate the world of paperwork that enables them to get said\nsupport.[24](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn24) For everyone else, the main\nresult of one’s years of professional training is to ensure that one is\nsaddled with such an enormous burden of student debt that a substantial chunk\nof any subsequent income one will get from pursuing that profession will\nhenceforth be siphoned off, each month, by the financial sector. In some\ncases, these new training requirements can only be described as outright\nscams, as when lenders, and those prepared to set up the training programs,\njointly lobby the government to insist that, say, all pharmacists be\nhenceforth required to pass some additional qualifying examination, forcing\nthousands already practicing the profession into night school, which these\npharmacists know many will only be able to afford with the help of high-\ninterest student loans.[25](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn25) By doing this,\nlenders are in effect legislating themselves a cut of most pharmacists’\nsubsequent incomes.[26](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn26)\n\nThe latter might seem an extreme case, but in its own way it’s paradigmatic of\nthe fusion of public and private power under the new financial regime.\nIncreasingly, corporate profits in America are not derived from commerce or\nindustry at all, but from finance—which means, ultimately, from other people’s\ndebts. These debts do not just happen by accident. To a large degree, they are\nengineered—and by precisely this kind of fusion of public and private power.\nThe corporatization of education; the resulting ballooning of tuitions as\nstudents are expected to pay for giant football stadiums and similar pet\nprojects of executive trustees, or to contribute to the burgeoning salaries of\never-multiplying university officials; the increasing demands for degrees as\ncertificates of entry into any job that promises access to anything like a\nmiddle-class standard of living; resulting rising levels of indebtedness—all\nthese form a single web. One result of all this debt is to render the\ngovernment itself the main mechanism for the extraction of corporate profits.\n(Just think, here, of what happens if one tries to default on one’s student\nloans: the entire legal apparatus leaps into action, threatening to seize\nassets, garnish wages, and apply thousands of dollars in additional\npenalties.) Another is to force the debtors themselves to bureaucratize ever-\nincreasing dimensions of their own lives, which have to be managed as if they\nwere themselves a tiny corporation measuring inputs and outputs and constantly\nstruggling to balance its accounts.\n\nIt’s also important to emphasize that while this system of extraction comes\ndressed up in a language of rules and regulations, in its actual mode of\noperation, it has almost nothing to do with the rule of law. Rather, the legal\nsystem has itself become the means for a system of increasingly arbitrary\nextractions. As the profits from banks and credit card companies derive more\nand more from “fees and penalties” levied on their customers—so much so that\nthose living check to check can regularly expect to be charged eighty dollars\nfor a five-dollar overdraft—financial firms have come to play by an entirely\ndifferent set of rules. I once attended a conference on the crisis in the\nbanking system where I was able to have a brief, informal chat with an\neconomist for one of the Bretton Woods institutions (probably best I not say\nwhich). I asked him why everyone was still waiting for even one bank official\nto be brought to trial for any act of fraud leading up to the crash of 2008.\n\n**OFFICIAL :** Well, you have to understand the approach taken by U.S.\nprosecutors to financial fraud is always to negotiate a settlement. They don’t\nwant to have to go to trial. The upshot is always that the financial\ninstitution has to pay a fine, sometimes in the hundreds of millions, but they\ndon’t actually admit to any criminal liability. Their lawyers simply say they\nare not going to contest the charge, but if they pay, they haven’t technically\nbeen found guilty of anything.\n\n**ME :** So you’re saying if the government discovers that Goldman Sachs, for\ninstance, or Bank of America, has committed fraud, they effectively just\ncharge them a penalty fee.\n\n**OFFICIAL :** That’s right.\n\n**ME :** So in that case … okay, I guess the real question is this: has there\never been a case where the amount the firm had to pay was _more_ than the\namount of money they made from the fraud itself?\n\n**OFFICIAL:** Oh no, not to my knowledge. Usually it’s substantially less.\n\n**ME :** So what are we talking here, 50 percent?\n\n**OFFICIAL :** I’d say more like 20 to 30 percent on average. But it varies\nconsiderably case by case.\n\n**ME :** Which means … correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t that effectively\nmean the government is saying, “you can commit all the fraud you like, but if\nwe catch you, you’re going to have to give us our cut”?\n\n**OFFICIAL :** Well, obviously I can’t put it that way myself as long as I\nhave this job …\n\nAnd of course, the power of those same banks to charge account-holders eighty\nbucks for an overdraft is enforced by the same court system content to merely\ncollect a piece of the action when the bank itself commits fraud.\n\nNow, on one level, this might just seem like another example of a familiar\nstory: the rich always play by a different set of rules. If the children of\nbankers can regularly get off the hook for carrying quantities of cocaine that\nwould almost certainly have earned them decades in a federal penitentiary if\nthey happened to be poor or Black, why should things be any different when\nthey grow up to become bankers themselves? But I think there is something\ndeeper going on here, and it turns on the very nature of bureaucratic systems.\nSuch institutions always create a culture of complicity. It’s not just that\nsome people get to break the rules—it’s that loyalty to the organization is to\nsome degree measured by one’s willingness to pretend this isn’t happening. And\ninsofar as bureaucratic logic is extended to the society as a whole, all of us\nstart playing along.\n\nThis point is worth expanding on. What I am saying is that we are not just\nlooking at a double standard, but a particular kind of double standard typical\nof bureaucratic systems everywhere. All bureaucracies are to a certain degree\nutopian, in the sense that they propose an abstract ideal that real human\nbeings can never live up to. Take the initial point about credentialism.\nSociologists since Weber always note that it is one of the defining features\nof any bureaucracy that those who staff it are selected by formal, impersonal\ncriteria—most often, some kind of written test. (That is, bureaucrats are not,\nsay, elected like politicians, but neither should they get the job just\nbecause they are someone’s cousin.) In theory they are meritocracies. In fact\neveryone knows the system is compromised in a thousand different ways. Many of\nthe staff are in fact there just because they are someone’s cousin, and\neverybody knows it. The first criterion of loyalty to the organization becomes\ncomplicity. Career advancement is not based on merit, and not even based\nnecessarily on being someone’s cousin; above all, it’s based on a willingness\nto play along with the fiction that career advancement is _based_ on merit,\neven though everyone knows this not to be\ntrue.[27](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn27) Or with the fiction that rules\nand regulations apply to everyone equally, when, in fact, they are often\ndeployed as a means for entirely arbitrary personal power.\n\nThis is how bureaucracies have always tended to work. But for most of history,\nthis fact has only been important for those who actually operated within\nadministrative systems: say, aspiring Confucian scholars in Medieval China.\nMost everyone else didn’t really have to think about organizations very often;\ntypically, they only encountered them every few years when it came time to\nregister their fields and cattle for the local tax authorities. But as I’ve\npointed out, the last two centuries have seen an explosion of bureaucracy, and\nthe last thirty or forty years in particular have seen bureaucratic principles\nextended to every aspect of our existence. As a result, this culture of\ncomplicity has come to spread as well. Many of us actually act as if we\nbelieve that the courts really are treating the financial establishment as it\nshould be treated, that they are even dealing with them too harshly; and that\nordinary citizens really do deserve to be penalized a hundred times more\nharshly for an overdraft. As whole societies have come to represent themselves\nas giant credentialized meritocracies, rather than systems of arbitrary\nextraction, everyone duly scurries about trying to curry favor by pretending\nthey actually believe this is to be true.\n\nSo: what would a left-wing critique of total, or predatory, bureaucratization\nlook like?\n\nI think the story of the Global Justice Movement provides a hint—because it\nwas a movement that, rather to its own surprise, discovered this was what it\nwas about. I remember this quite well because I was deeply involved in the\nmovement at the time. Back in the 1990s, “globalization,” as touted by\njournalists like Thomas Friedman (but really, by the entire journalistic\nestablishment in the United States and most of it in other wealthy countries)\nwas portrayed as an almost natural force. Technological advances—particularly\nthe Internet—were knitting the world together as never before, increased\ncommunication was leading to increased trade, and national borders were\nrapidly becoming irrelevant as free trade treaties united the globe into a\nsingle world market. In political debates of the time in the mainstream media,\nall of this was discussed as such a self-evident reality that anyone who\nobjected to the process could be treated as if they were objecting to basic\nlaws of nature—they were flat-earthers, buffoons, the left-wing equivalents of\nBiblical fundamentalists who thought evolution was a hoax.\n\nThus when the Global Justice Movement started, the media spin was that it was\na rearguard action of hoary, carbuncular leftists who wished to restore\nprotectionism, national sovereignty, barriers to trade and communication, and,\ngenerally, to vainly stand against the Inevitable Tide of History. The problem\nwith this was that it was obviously untrue. Most immediately, there was the\nfact that the protestors’ average age, especially in the wealthier countries,\nseemed to be about nineteen. More seriously, there was the fact that the\nmovement was a form of globalization in itself: a kaleidoscopic alliance of\npeople from every corner of the world, including organizations ranging from\nIndian farmers’ associations, to the Canadian postal workers’ union, to\nindigenous groups in Panama, to anarchist collectives in Detroit. What’s more,\nits exponents endlessly insisted that despite protestations to the contrary,\nwhat the media was calling “globalization” had almost nothing to do with the\neffacement of borders and the free movement of people, products, and ideas. It\nwas really about trapping increasingly large parts of the world’s population\nbehind highly militarized national borders within which social protections\ncould be systematically withdrawn, creating a pool of laborers so desperate\nthat they would be willing to work for almost nothing. Against it, they\nproposed a genuinely borderless world.\n\nObviously, these ideas’ exponents did not get to say any of this on TV or\nmajor newspapers—at least not in countries like America, whose media is\nstrictly policed by its own internal corporate bureaucrats. Such arguments\nwere, effectively, taboo. But we discovered that there was something we could\ndo that worked almost as well. We could besiege the summits where the trade\npacts were negotiated and the annual meetings of the institutions through\nwhich the terms of what was called globalization were actually concocted,\nencoded, and enforced. Until the movement came to North America with the siege\nof the World Trade Meeting in Seattle in November 1999—and subsequent\nblockades against the IMF/World Bank Meetings in Washington—most Americans\nsimply had no idea that any of these organizations even existed. The actions\noperated like a magic charm that exposed everything that was supposed to be\nhidden: all we had to do was show up and try to block access to the venue, and\ninstantly we revealed the existence of a vast global bureaucracy of\ninterlocking organizations that nobody was supposed to really think about. And\nof course, at the same time, we would magically whisk into existence thousands\nof heavily armed riot police ready to reveal just what those bureaucrats were\nwilling to unleash against anyone—no matter how nonviolent—who tried to stand\nin their way.\n\nIt was a surprisingly effective strategy. Within a matter of two or three\nyears, we had sunk pretty much every proposed new global trade pact, and\ninstitutions like the IMF had been effectively expelled from Asia, Latin\nAmerica, and, indeed, most of the world’s\nsurface.[28](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn28)\n\nThe imagery worked because it showed everything people had been told about\nglobalization to be a lie. This was not some natural process of peaceful\ntrade, made possible by new technologies. What was being talked about in terms\nof “free trade” and the “free market” really entailed the self-conscious\ncompletion of the world’s first effective[29](part0009_split_000.html#itr-\nftn29) planetary-scale administrative bureaucratic system. The foundations for\nthe system had been laid in the 1940s, but it was only with the waning of the\nCold War that they became truly effective. In the process, they came to be\nmade up—like most other bureaucratic systems being created on a smaller scale\nat the same time—of such a thorough entanglement of public and private\nelements that it was often quite impossible to pull them apart—even\nconceptually. Let us think about it this way: At the top were the trade\nbureaucracies like the IMF, World Bank, WTO and the G8s, along with treaty\norganizations like NAFTA or the EU. These actually developed the economic—and\neven social—policies followed by supposedly democratic governments in the\nglobal south. Just below were the large global financial firms like Goldman\nSachs, Lehman Brothers, American Insurance Group, or, for that matter,\ninstitutions like Standard & Poors. Below that came the transnational mega-\ncorporations. (Much of what was being called “international trade” in fact\nconsisted merely of the transfer of materials back and forth between different\nbranches of the same corporation.) Finally, one has to include the NGOs, which\nin many parts of the world come to provide many of the social services\npreviously provided by government, with the result that urban planning in a\ncity in Nepal, or health policy in a town in Nigeria, might well have been\ndeveloped in offices in Zurich or Chicago.\n\nAt the time, we didn’t talk about things in quite these terms—that “free\ntrade” and “the free market” actually meant the creation of global\nadministrative structures mainly aimed at ensuring the extraction of profits\nfor investors, that “globalization” really meant bureaucratization. We often\ncame close. But we rarely quite out and said it.\n\nIn retrospect, I think this is exactly what we should have emphasized. Even\nthe emphasis on inventing new forms of democratic processes that was at the\ncore of the movement—the assemblies, the spokescouncils, and so on—was, more\nthan anything else, a way to show that people could indeed get on with one\nanother—and even make important decisions and carry out complex collective\nprojects—without anyone ever having to fill out a form, appeal a judgment, or\nthreaten to phone security or the police.\n\nThe Global Justice Movement was, in its own way, the first major leftist\nantibureaucratic movement of the era of total bureaucratization. As such, I\nthink it offers important lessons for anyone trying to develop a similar\ncritique. Let me end by outlining three of them:\n\n**1\\. Do not underestimate the importance of sheer physical violence**.\n\nThe armies of highly militarized police that appeared to attack the summit\nprotestors were not some sort of weird side effect of “globalization.”\nWhenever someone starts talking about the “free market,” it’s a good idea to\nlook around for the man with the gun. He’s never far away. Free-market\nliberalism of the nineteenth century corresponded with the invention of the\nmodern police and private detective agencies,[30](part0009_split_000.html#itr-\nftn30) and gradually, with the notion that those police had at least ultimate\njurisdiction over virtually every aspect of urban life, from the regulation of\nstreet peddlers to noise levels at private parties, or even to the resolution\nof bitter fights with crazy uncles or college roommates. We are now so used to\nthe idea that we at least _could_ call the police to resolve virtually any\ndifficult circumstance that many of us find it difficult to even imagine what\npeople would have done before this was\npossible.[31](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn31) Because, in fact, for the\nvast majority of people throughout history—even those who lived in in large\ncities—there were simply no authorities to call in such circumstances. Or, at\nleast, no impersonal bureaucratic ones who were, like the modern police,\nempowered to impose arbitrary resolutions backed by the threat of force.\n\nHere I think it is possible to add a kind of corollary to the Iron Law of\nLiberalism. History reveals that political policies that favor “the market”\nhave always meant even more people in offices to administer things, but it\nalso reveals that they also mean an increase of the range and density of\nsocial relations that are ultimately regulated by the threat of violence. This\nobviously flies in the face of everything we’ve been taught to believe about\nthe market, but if you observe what actually happens, it’s clearly true. In a\nsense, even calling this a “corollary” is deceptive, because we’re really just\ntalking about two different ways of talking about the same thing. The\nbureaucratization of daily life means the imposition of impersonal rules and\nregulations; impersonal rules and regulations, in turn, can only operate if\nthey are backed up by the threat of force.[32](part0009_split_000.html#itr-\nftn32) And indeed, in this most recent phase of total bureaucratization, we’ve\nseen security cameras, police scooters, issuers of temporary ID cards, and men\nand women in a variety of uniforms acting in either public or private\ncapacities, trained in tactics of menacing, intimidating, and ultimately\ndeploying physical violence, appear just about everywhere—even in places such\nas playgrounds, primary schools, college campuses, hospitals, libraries,\nparks, or beach resorts, where fifty years ago their presence would have been\nconsidered scandalous, or simply weird.\n\nAll this takes place as social theorists continue to insist that the direct\nappeal to force plays less and less of a factor in maintaining structures of\nsocial control.[33](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn33) The more reports one\nreads, in fact, of university students being tasered for unauthorized library\nuse, or English professors being jailed and charged with felonies after being\ncaught jaywalking on campus, the louder the defiant insistence that the kinds\nof subtle symbolic power analyzed by English professors are what’s really\nimportant. It begins to sound more and more like a desperate refusal to accept\nthat the workings of power could really be so crude and simplistic as what\ndaily evidence proves them to be.\n\nIn my own native New York, I have observed the endless multiplication of bank\nbranches. When I was growing up, most bank offices were large, freestanding\nbuildings, usually designed to look like Greek or Roman temples. Over the last\nthirty years, storefront branches of the same three or four megabanks have\nopened, it seems, on every third block in the more prosperous parts of\nManhattan. In the greater New York area there are now literally thousands of\nthem, each one having replaced some earlier shop that once provided material\ngoods and services of one sort or another. In a way these are the perfect\nsymbols of our age: stores selling pure abstraction—immaculate boxes\ncontaining little but glass and steel dividers, computer screens, and armed\nsecurity. They define the perfect point of conjuncture between guns and\ninformation, since that’s really all that’s there. And that conjuncture has\ncome to provide the framework for almost every other aspect of our lives.\n\nWhen we think about such matters at all, we generally act as if this is all\nsimply an effect of technology: this is a world whisked into being by\ncomputers. It even looks like one. And indeed, all these new bank lobbies do\nbear a striking resemblance to the stripped-down virtual reality one often\nfound in 1990s video games. It’s as if we have finally achieved the ability to\nmake such virtual realities materialize, and in so doing, to reduce our lives,\ntoo, to a kind of video game, as we negotiate the various mazeways of the new\nbureaucracies. Since, in such video games, nothing is actually produced, it\njust kind of springs into being, and we really do spend our lives earning\npoints and dodging people carrying weapons.\n\nBut this sense that we are living in a world created by computers is itself an\nillusion. To conclude that this was all an inevitable effect of technological\ndevelopment, rather than of social and political forces, would be making a\nterrible mistake. Here too the lessons of “globalization,” which was supposed\nto have been somehow created by the Internet, are critically important:\n\n**2\\. Do not overestimate the importance of technology as a causative\nfactor**.\n\nJust as what came to be called “globalization” was really a creation of new\npolitical alignments, policy decisions, and new bureaucracies—which were only\nlater followed by physical technologies like containerized shipping, or the\nInternet—so the pervasive bureaucratization of everyday life made possible by\nthe computers is not, itself, the result of technological development. Rather\nit’s the other way around. Technological change is simply not an independent\nvariable. Technology will advance, and often in surprising and unexpected\nways. But the overall direction it takes depends on social factors.\n\nThis is easy to forget because our immediate experience of everyday\nbureaucratization is entirely caught up in new information technologies:\nFacebook, smartphone banking, Amazon, PayPal, endless handheld devices that\nreduce the world around us to maps, forms, codes, and graphs. Still, the key\nalignments that made all this possible are precisely those that I have been\ndescribing in this essay, that first took place in the seventies and eighties,\nwith the alliance of finance and corporate bureaucrats, the new corporate\nculture that emerged from it, and its ability to invade educational,\nscientific, and government circles in such a way that public and private\nbureaucracies finally merged together in a mass of paperwork designed to\nfacilitate the direct extraction of wealth. This was not a product of new\ntechnologies. To the contrary, the appropriate technologies took decades to\nemerge. In the seventies, computers were still something of a joke. Banks and\ngovernment offices were keen on putting them into service, but for most of\nthose on the receiving end, they were the very definition of bureaucratic\nidiocy; whenever something went terribly, obviously wrong, the reaction was\nalways to throw up one’s eyes and blame “some computer.” After forty years and\nthe endless investment of research funding into information technologies, we\nhave gotten to the point where the kinds of computers bankers employ, and\nprovide, are our very definition of infallible, magical efficiency.\n\nConsider the ATM machine. In the last thirty years, I can’t remember a single\noccasion in which I have asked an ATM machine for money and gotten an\nincorrect amount. Nor have I been able to find anyone I know who can. This is\nso true that in the wake of the 2000 U.S. presidential elections, when the\npublic was being regaled with statistics on the 2.8 percent degree of error\nexpected from this type of voting machine, or the 1.5 percent expected from\nthat, some had the temerity to point out that in a country that defines itself\nas the world’s greatest democracy, where elections are our very sacrament, we\nseem to just accept that voting machines will regularly miscount the vote,\nwhile every day hundreds of millions of ATM transactions take place with an\noverall zero percent rate of error. What does this say about what really\nmatters to Americans as a nation?\n\nFinancial technology then has gone from a running gag to something so reliable\nthat it can form the assumed backbone of our social reality. You never have to\nthink about whether the cash machine will dispense the correct amount of cash.\nIf it’s working at all, it will not make a mistake. This gives financial\nabstractions an air of utter certainty—a “ready-to-hand” quality, as Martin\nHeidegger put it—such an essential part of the practical infrastructure of our\ndaily projects and affairs that we never have to think about as something in\nitself at all. Meanwhile physical infrastructure like roads, escalators,\nbridges, and underground railways crumbles around us, and the landscape\nsurrounding major cities is peppered with the futuristic visions of past\ngenerations now lying smelly, dirty, or abandoned. None of this just happened.\nIt is, precisely, a matter of national priorities: the result of policy\ndecisions that allocate funding for everything from landmark preservation to\ncertain kinds of scientific research. This is the world that all those endless\ndocuments about “vision,” “quality,” “leadership,” and “innovation” have\nactually produced. Rather than causing our current situation, the direction\nthat technological change has taken is itself largely a function of the power\nof finance.\n\n**3\\. Always remember it’s all ultimately about value (or: whenever you hear\nsomeone say that what their greatest value is rationality, they are just\nsaying that because they don’t want to admit to what their greatest value\nreally is)**.\n\nThe “self-actualization” philosophy from which most of this new bureaucratic\nlanguage emerged insists that we live in a timeless present, that history\nmeans nothing, that we simply create the world around us through the power of\nthe will. This is a kind of individualistic fascism. Around the time the\nphilosophy became popular in the seventies, some conservative Christian\ntheologians were actually thinking along very similar lines: seeing electronic\nmoney as a kind of extension for God’s creative power, which is then\ntransformed into material reality through the minds of inspired entrepreneurs.\nIt’s easy to see how this could lead to the creation of a world where\nfinancial abstractions feel like the very bedrock of reality, and so many of\nour lived environments look like they were 3-D-printed from somebody’s\ncomputer screen. In fact, the sense of a digitally generated world I’ve been\ndescribing could be taken as a perfect illustration of another social law—at\nleast, it seems to me that it should be recognized as a law—that, if one gives\nsufficient social power to a class of people holding even the most outlandish\nideas, they will, consciously or not, eventually contrive to produce a world\norganized in such a way that living in it will, in a thousand subtle ways,\nreinforce the impression that those ideas are self-evidently true.\n\nIn the north Atlantic countries, all this is the culmination of a very long\neffort to transform popular ideas about the origins of value. Most Americans,\nfor instance, used to subscribe to a rough-and-ready version of the labor\ntheory of value. It made intuitive sense in a world where most people were\nfarmers, mechanics, or shopkeepers: the good things in life were assumed to\nexist because people took the trouble to produce them; doing so was seen as\ninvolving both brain and muscle, usually, in roughly equal proportions. In the\nmid-nineteenth century even mainstream politicians would often use language\nthat might seem to have been taken straight from Karl Marx. So Abraham\nLincoln:\n\nLabor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of\nlabor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is\nthe superior of capital, and deserves much the higher\nconsideration.[34](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn34)\n\nThe rise of bureaucratic capitalism in the Gilded Age was accompanied by a\nself-conscious effort, on the part of the new tycoons of the day, to put this\nkind of language aside, and to promulgate what was considered at the time the\nbold new philosophy—steel magnate Andrew Carnegie spoke of it as “The Gospel\nof Wealth”—that value was instead derived from capital itself. Carnegie and\nhis allies embarked on a well-funded campaign of promoting the new gospel, not\njust in Rotary Clubs and Chambers of Commerce across the nation, but also in\nschools, churches, and civic associations.[35](part0009_split_000.html#itr-\nftn35) The basic argument was that the very efficiency of the new giant firms\nthese men directed could produce such a material bounty it would allow\nAmericans to realize themselves through what they consumed rather than what\nthey produced. In this view, value was ultimately a product of the very\nbureaucratic organization of the new conglomerates.\n\nOne thing that the global justice movement taught us is that politics is,\nindeed, ultimately about value; but also, that those creating vast\nbureaucratic systems will almost never admit what their values really are.\nThis was as true of the Carnegies as it is today. Normally, they will—like the\nrobber barons of the turn of the last century—insist that they are acting in\nthe name of efficiency, or “rationality.” But in fact this language always\nturns out to be intentionally vague, even nonsensical. The term “rationality”\nis an excellent case in point here. A “rational” person is someone who is able\nto make basic logical connections and assess reality in a non-delusional\nfashion. In other words, someone who isn’t crazy. Anyone who claims to base\ntheir politics on rationality—and this is true on the left as well as on the\nright—is claiming that anyone who disagrees with them might as well be insane,\nwhich is about as arrogant a position as one could possibly take. Or else,\nthey’re using “rationality” as a synonym for “technical efficiency,” and thus\nfocusing on _how_ they are going about something because they do not wish to\ntalk about _what_ it is they are ultimately going about. Neoclassical\neconomics is notorious for making this kind of move. When an economist\nattempts to prove that it is “irrational” to vote in national elections\n(because the effort expended outweighs the likely benefit to the individual\nvoter), they use the term because they do not wish to say “irrational for\nactors for whom civic participation, political ideals, or the common good are\nnot values in themselves, but who view public affairs only in terms of\npersonal advantage.” There is absolutely no reason why one could not\nrationally calculate the best way to further one’s political ideals through\nvoting. But according to the economists’ assumptions, anyone who takes this\ncourse might as well be out of their minds.\n\nIn other words, talking about rational efficiency becomes a way of avoiding\ntalking about what the efficiency is actually for; that is, the ultimately\nirrational aims that are assumed to be the ultimate ends of human behavior.\nHere is another place where markets and bureaucracies ultimately speak the\nsame language. Both claim to be acting largely in the name of individual\nfreedom, and individual self-realization through consumption. Even supporters\nof the old Prussian bureaucratic state in the nineteenth century, like Hegel\nor Goethe, insisted that its authoritarian measures could be justified by the\nfact they allowed citizens to be absolutely secure in their property, and\ntherefore, free to do absolutely anything they pleased in their own\nhomes—whether that meant pursuing the arts, religion, romance, or\nphilosophical speculation, or simply a matter of deciding for themselves what\nsort of beer they chose to drink, music they chose to listen to, or clothes\nthey chose to wear. Bureaucratic capitalism, when it appeared in the United\nStates, similarly justified itself on consumerist grounds: one could justify\ndemanding that workers abandon any control over the conditions under which\nthey worked if one could thus guarantee them a wider and cheaper range of\nproducts for them to use at home.[36](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn36) There\nwas always assumed to be a synergy between impersonal, rule-bound\norganization—whether in the public sphere, or the sphere of production—and\nabsolute free self-expression in the club, café, kitchen, or family outing.\n(At first, of course, this freedom was limited to male heads of household;\nover time, it was at least in principle extended to everyone.)\n\nThe most profound legacy of the dominance of bureaucratic forms of\norganization over the last two hundred years is that it has made this\nintuitive division between rational, technical means and the ultimately\nirrational ends to which they are put seem like common sense. This is true on\nthe national level, where civil servants pride themselves on being able to\nfind the most efficient means to pursue whatever national destiny their\ncountry’s rulers happen to dream up: whether that be rooted in the pursuit of\ncultural brilliance, imperial conquest, the pursuit of a genuinely egalitarian\nsocial order, or the literal application of Biblical law. It is equally true\non the individual level, where we all take for granted that human beings go\nout into the marketplace merely to calculate the most efficient way to enrich\nthemselves, but that once they have the money, there’s no telling what they\nmight decide to do with it: whether it be to buy a mansion, or a race car,\nengage in a personal investigation of UFO disappearances, or simply lavish the\nmoney on one’s kids. It all seems so self-evident that it’s hard for us to\nremember that in most human societies that have existed, historically, such a\ndivision would make no sense at all. In most times and places, the way one\ngoes about doing something is assumed to be the ultimate expression of who one\nis.[37](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn37) But it also seems as if the moment\none divides the world into two spheres in this way—into the domain of sheer\ntechnical competence and a separate domain of ultimate values—each sphere will\ninevitably begin trying to invade the other. Some will declare that\nrationality, or even efficiency, are themselves values, that they are even\nultimate values, and that we should somehow create a “rational” society\n(whatever that means). Others will insist that life should become art; or\nelse, religion. But all such movements are premised on the very division they\nprofess to overcome.\n\nIn the big picture it hardly matters, then, whether one seeks to reorganize\nthe world around bureaucratic efficiency or market rationality: all the\nfundamental assumptions remain the same. This helps explain why it’s so easy\nto move back and forth between them, as with those ex-Soviet officials who so\ncheerfully switched hats from endorsing total state control of the economy, to\ntotal marketization—and in the process, true to the Iron Law, managed to\nincrease the total number of bureaucrats employed in their country\ndramatically.[38](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn38) Or how the two can fuse\ninto an almost seamless whole, as in the current era of total\nbureaucratization.\n\nFor anyone who has ever been a refugee, or for that matter had to fill out the\nforty-page application required to get one’s daughter considered for admission\nby a London music school, the idea that bureaucracy has anything to do with\nrationality, let alone efficiency, might seem odd. But this is the way it\nlooks from the top. In fact, from inside the system, the algorithms and\nmathematical formulae by which the world comes to be assessed become,\nultimately, not just measures of value, but the source of value\nitself.[39](part0009_split_000.html#itr-ftn39) Much of what bureaucrats do,\nafter all, is evaluate things. They are continually assessing, auditing,\nmeasuring, weighing the relative merits of different plans, proposals,\napplications, courses of action, or candidates for promotion. Market reforms\nonly reinforce this tendency. This happens on every level. It is felt most\ncruelly by the poor, who are constantly monitored by an intrusive army of\nmoralistic box-tickers assessing their child-rearing skills, inspecting their\nfood cabinets to see if they are really cohabiting with their partners,\ndetermining whether they have been trying hard enough to find a job, or\nwhether their medical conditions are really sufficiently severe to disqualify\nthem from physical labor. All rich countries now employ legions of\nfunctionaries whose primary function is to make poor people feel bad about\nthemselves. But the culture of evaluation is if anything even more pervasive\nin the hypercredentialized world of the professional classes, where audit\nculture reigns, and nothing is real that cannot be quantified, tabulated, or\nentered into some interface or quarterly report. Not only is this world\nultimately a product of financialization, it’s really just a continuation of\nit. Since what is the world of securitized derivatives, collateralized debt\nobligations, and other such exotic financial instruments but the apotheosis of\nthe principle that value is ultimately a product of paperwork, and the very\napex of a mountain of assessment forms which begins with the irritating\ncaseworker determining whether you are really poor enough to merit a fee\nwaiver for your children’s medicine and ends with men in suits engaged in\nhigh-speed trading of bets over how long it will take you to default on your\nmortgage.\n\nA critique of bureaucracy fit for the times would have to show how all these\nthreads—financialization, violence, technology, the fusion of public and\nprivate—knit together into a single, self-sustaining web. The process of\nfinancialization has meant that an ever-increasing proportion of corporate\nprofits come in the form of rent extraction of one sort or another. Since this\nis ultimately little more than legalized extortion, it is accompanied by ever-\nincreasing accumulation of rules and regulations, and ever-more sophisticated,\nand omnipresent, threats of physical force to enforce them. Indeed they become\nso omnipresent that we no longer realize we’re being threatened, since we\ncannot imagine what it would be like not to be. At the same time, some of the\nprofits from rent extraction are recycled to select portions of the\nprofessional classes, or to create new cadres of paper-pushing corporate\nbureaucrats. This helps a phenomenon I have written about elsewhere: the\ncontinual growth, in recent decades, of apparently meaningless, make-work,\n“bullshit jobs”—strategic vision coordinators, human resources consultants,\nlegal analysts, and the like—despite the fact that even those who hold such\npositions are half the time secretly convinced they contribute nothing to the\nenterprise. In the end, this is just an extension of the basic logic of class\nrealignment that began in the seventies and eighties as corporate\nbureaucracies become extensions of the financial system.\n\nEvery now and then you chance on a particular example that brings everything\ntogether. In September 2013, I visited a tea factory outside Marseille that\nwas currently being occupied by its workers. There had been a standoff with\nlocal police for over a year. What had brought things to such a pass? A\nmiddle-aged factory worker, who took me on a tour of the plant, explained that\nwhile ostensibly the issue was a decision to move the plant to Poland to take\nadvantage of cheaper labor, the ultimate issue had to do with the allocation\nof profits. The oldest and most experienced of the hundred-odd workers there\nhad spent years tinkering with, and improving, the efficiency of the giant\nmachines used to package teabags. Output had increased and with them profits.\nYet what did the owners do with the extra money? Did they give the workers a\nraise to reward them for increased productivity? In the old Keynesian days of\nthe fifties and sixties they almost certainly would have. No longer. Did they\nhire more workers and expand production? No again. All they did was hire\nmiddle managers.\n\nFor years, he explained, there had only been two executives in the factory:\nthe boss, and a human resources officer. As profits rose, more and more men in\nsuits appeared, until there were almost a dozen of them. The suits all had\nelaborate titles but there was almost nothing for them to do, so they spent a\nlot of time walking the catwalks staring at the workers, setting up metrics to\nmeasure and evaluate them, writing plans and reports. Eventually, they hit on\nthe idea of moving the entire operation overseas—largely, he speculated,\nbecause devising the plan created a retrospective excuse for their existence,\nthough, he added, it probably didn’t hurt that while the workers themselves\nwould mostly lose their jobs, the executives who made the plan would likely be\nrelocated to a more attractive location. Before long, the workers had seized\nthe building, and the perimeter was swarming with riot cops.\n\nA left critique of bureaucracy, therefore, is sorely lacking. This book is\nnot, precisely, an outline for such a critique. Neither is it in any sense an\nattempt to develop a general theory of bureaucracy, a history of bureaucracy,\nor even of the current age of total bureaucracy. It is a collection of essays,\neach of which points at some directions a left-wing critique of bureaucracy\nmight take. The first focuses on violence; the second, on technology; the\nthird, on rationality and value.\n\nThe chapters do not form a single argument. Perhaps they could be said to\ncircle around one, but mainly, they are an attempt to begin a conversation—one\nlong overdue.\n\nWe are all faced with a problem. Bureaucratic practices, habits, and\nsensibilities engulf us. Our lives have come to be organized around the\nfilling out of forms. Yet the language we have to talk about these things is\nnot just woefully inadequate—it might as well have been designed to make the\nproblem worse. We need to find a way to talk about what it is we actually\nobject to in this process, to speak honestly about the violence it entails,\nbut at the same time, to understand what is appealing about it, what sustains\nit, which elements carry within them some potential for redemption in a truly\nfree society, which are best considered the inevitable price to pay for living\nin any complex society, which can and should be entirely eliminated entirely.\nIf this book plays even a modest role in sparking such a conversation, it will\nhave made a genuine contribution to contemporary political life.\n\n\n# **1**\n\n# **Dead Zones of the Imagination**  \n**An Essay on Structural Stupidity**\n\nLet me begin with a story about bureaucracy.\n\nIn 2006, my mother had a series of strokes. It soon became obvious that she\nwould eventually be incapable of living at home without assistance. Since her\ninsurance would not cover home care, a series of social workers advised us to\nput in for Medicaid. To qualify for Medicaid, however, one’s total worth can\nonly amount to six thousand dollars. We arranged to transfer her savings—this\nwas, I suppose, technically a scam, though it’s a peculiar sort of scam since\nthe government employs thousands of social workers whose main work seems to\ninvolve telling citizens exactly how to perpetuate said scam—but shortly\nthereafter, she had another, very serious stroke, and found herself in a\nnursing home undergoing long-term rehabilitation. When she emerged from that,\nshe was definitely going to need home care, but there was a problem: her\nsocial security check was being deposited directly, and she was barely able to\nsign her name, so unless I acquired power of attorney over her account and was\nthus able to pay her monthly rent bills for her, the money would immediately\nbuild up and disqualify her, even after I filled out the enormous raft of\nMedicaid documents I needed to file to qualify her for pending status.\n\nI went to her bank, picked up the requisite forms, and brought them to the\nnursing home. The documents needed to be notarized. The nurse on the floor\ninformed me there was an in-house notary, but I needed to make an appointment;\nshe picked up the phone and put me through to a disembodied voice, who then\ntransferred me to the notary. The notary proceeded to inform me I first had to\nget authorization from the head of social work, and hung up. So I acquired his\nname and room number and duly took the elevator downstairs and appeared at his\noffice—only to discover that the head of social work was, in fact, the\ndisembodied voice that had referred me to the notary in the first place. The\nhead of social work picked up the phone, said, “Marjorie, that was me, you’re\ndriving this man crazy with this nonsense and you’re driving me crazy, too,”\nand, after a small apologetic gesture, proceeded to secure me an appointment\nfor early the next week.\n\nThe next week the notary duly appeared, accompanied me upstairs, made sure I’d\nfilled out my side of the form (as had been repeatedly emphasized to me), and\nthen, in my mother’s presence, proceeded to fill out her own. I was a little\npuzzled that she didn’t ask my mother to sign anything, only me, but I figured\nthat she knew what she was doing. The next day I took the document to the\nbank, where the woman at the desk took one look, asked why my mother hadn’t\nsigned it, and showed it to her manager, who told me to take it back and do it\nright. It seemed that the notary indeed had no idea what she was doing. So I\ngot new set of forms, duly filled out my side of each, and made a new\nappointment. On the appointed day the notary appeared, and after a few awkward\nremarks about how difficult these banks are (why does each bank insist on\nhaving its own, completely different power of attorney form?), she took me\nupstairs. I signed, my mother signed—with some difficulty, she was finding it\nhard at this point even to prop herself up—and the next day I returned to the\nbank. Another woman at a different desk examined the forms and asked why I had\nsigned the line where it said to write my name and printed my name on the line\nwhere it said to sign.\n\n“I did? Well, I just did exactly what the notary told me to do.”\n\n“But it clearly says ‘signature’ here.”\n\n“Oh, yes, it does, doesn’t it? I guess she told me wrong. Again. Well … all\nthe information is still there, isn’t it? It’s just those two bits that are\nreversed. So is that really a problem? The situation is kind of pressing, and\nI’d really rather not have to wait to make another appointment.”\n\n“Well, normally we don’t even accept these forms without all the signatories\nbeing here in person.”\n\n“My mother had a stroke. She’s bedridden. That’s why I need power of attorney\nin the first place.”\n\nShe said she’d check with the manager, and after ten minutes returned, the\nmanager hanging just within earshot in the background, to announce the bank\ncould not accept the forms in their present state—and in addition, even if\nthey were filled out correctly, I would still need a letter from my mother’s\ndoctor certifying that she was mentally competent to sign such a document.\n\nI pointed out that no one had mentioned any such letter previously.\n\n“What?” the manager suddenly interjected. “Who gave you those forms and didn’t\ntell you about the letter?”\n\nSince the culprit was one of the more sympathetic bank employees, I dodged the\nquestion,[40](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn40) noting instead that in the\nbankbook it was printed, quite clearly, “in trust for David Graeber.” He of\ncourse replied that would only matter if she was dead.\n\nAs it happened, the whole problem soon became academic: my mother did indeed\ndie a few weeks later.\n\nAt the time, I found this experience extremely disconcerting. Having spent\nmuch of my life leading a fairly bohemian student existence comparatively\ninsulated from this sort of thing, I found myself asking my friends: is this\nwhat ordinary life, for most people, is really like? Running around feeling\nlike an idiot all day? Being somehow put in a position where one actually does\nend up acting like an idiot? Most were inclined to suspect that this was\nindeed what life is mostly like. Obviously, the notary was unusually\nincompetent. Still, I had to spend over a month not long after dealing with\nthe ramifying consequences of the act of whatever anonymous functionary in the\nNew York Department of Motor Vehicles had inscribed my given name as “Daid,”\nnot to mention the Verizon clerk who spelled my surname “Grueber.”\nBureaucracies public and private appear—for whatever historical reasons—to be\norganized in such a way as to guarantee that a significant proportion of\nactors will not be able to perform their tasks as expected. It’s in this sense\nthat I’ve said one can fairly say that bureaucracies are utopian forms of\norganization. After all, is this not what we always say of utopians: that they\nhave a naïve faith in the perfectibility of human nature and refuse to deal\nwith humans as they actually are? Which is, are we not also told, what leads\nthem to set impossible standards and then blame the individuals for not living\nup to them?[41](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn41) But in fact all\nbureaucracies do this, insofar as they set demands they insist are reasonable,\nand then, on discovering that they are not reasonable (since a significant\nnumber of people will always be unable to perform as expected), conclude that\nthe problem is not with the demands themselves but with the individual\ninadequacy of each particular human being who fails to live up to them.\n\nOn a purely personal level, probably the most disturbing thing was how dealing\nwith these forms somehow rendered me stupid, too. How could I not have noticed\nthat I was printing my name on the line that said “signature”? It was written\nright there! I like to think that I am not, ordinarily, a particularly stupid\nperson. In fact I’ve made something of a career out convincing others that I’m\nsmart. Yet I was doing obviously foolish things; and not because I wasn’t\npaying attention; in fact, I had been investing a great deal of mental and\nemotional energy in the whole affair. The problem, I realized, was not with\nthe energy spent, but with the fact that most of this energy was being sunk\ninto attempts to try to understand and influence whoever, at any moment,\nseemed to have some kind of bureaucratic power over me—when, in fact, all that\nwas required was the accurate interpretation of one or two Latin words, and\ncorrect performance of certain purely mechanical functions. Spending so much\nof my time worrying about how not to seem like I was rubbing the notary’s face\nin her incompetence, or imagining what might make me seem sympathetic to\nvarious bank officials, made me less inclined to notice when they told me to\ndo something foolish. It was an obviously misplaced strategy, since insofar as\nanyone had the power to bend the rules they were usually not the people I was\ntalking to; moreover, if I did encounter someone who did have such power, they\nwould invariably inform me directly or indirectly that if I did complain in\nany way, even about a purely structural absurdity, the only possible result\nwould be to get some junior functionary in trouble.\n\nAs an anthropologist, all this struck me as strangely familiar. We\nanthropologists have made something of a specialty out of dealing with the\nritual surrounding birth, marriage, death, and similar rites of passage. We\nare particularly concerned with ritual gestures that are socially efficacious:\nwhere the mere act of saying or doing something makes it socially true. (Think\nof phrases like “I apologize,” “I surrender, or “I pronounce you man and\nwife.”) Humans being the social creatures that they are, birth and death are\nnever mere biological events. It normally takes a great deal of work to turn a\nnewborn baby into a person—someone with a name and social relationships\n(mother, father …) and a home, towards whom others have responsibilities, who\ncan someday be expected to have responsibilities to them as well. Usually,\nmuch of this work is done through ritual. Such rituals, as anthropologists\nhave noted, can vary wildly in form and content: they might involve baptisms,\nconfirmations, fumigations, first haircuts, isolation, declarations, the\nmaking and waving and burning and burying of ritual paraphernalia, spells.\nDeath is even more complicated because those same social relationships that\none has acquired in life have to be gradually severed, rearranged. It often\ntakes years, repeated burials (even reburials), burning, bleaching and\nrearranging of bones, feasts, and ceremonies before someone is entirely dead.\nIn most existing societies at this point in history, those rituals may or may\nnot be carried out, but it is precisely paperwork, rather than any other form\nof ritual, that is socially efficacious in this way, that actually effects the\nchange. My mother, for example, wished to be cremated without ceremony; my\nmain memory of the funeral home though was of the plump, good-natured clerk\nwho walked me through a fourteen-page document he had to file in order to\nobtain a death certificate, written in ballpoint on carbon paper so it came\nout in triplicate. “How many hours a day do you spend filling out forms like\nthat?” I asked. He sighed. “It’s all I do,” holding up a hand bandaged from\nsome kind of incipient carpal tunnel syndrome. He had to. Without those forms,\nneither my mother, nor any of the other people cremated at his establishment,\nwould be legally—hence socially—dead.\n\nWhy, then, I wondered, are there not vast ethnographic tomes about American or\nBritish rites of passage, with long chapters about forms and paperwork?\n\nThere is an obvious answer. Paperwork is boring. One can describe the ritual\nsurrounding it. One can observe how people talk about or react to it. But when\nit comes to the paperwork itself, there just aren’t that many interesting\nthings one can say about it. How is the form laid out? What about the color\nscheme? Why did they choose to ask for certain bits of information and not\nothers? Why place of birth and not, say, place where you went to grade school?\nWhat’s so important about the signature? But even so, even the most\nimaginative commentator pretty quickly runs out of questions.\n\nIn fact, one could go further. Paperwork is _supposed_ to be boring. And it’s\ngetting more so all the time. Medieval charters were often quite beautiful,\nfull of calligraphy and heraldic embellishments. Even in the nineteenth\ncentury some of this remained: I have a copy of my grandfather’s birth\ncertificate, issued in Springfield, Illinois, in 1858, and it’s quite\ncolorful, with Gothic letters, scrolls and little cherubs (it’s also written\nentirely in German). My father’s, in contrast, issued in Lawrence, Kansas, in\n1914, is monochrome and utterly unadorned, just lines and boxes, though they\nare filled out in a nice florid hand. My own, issued in New York in 1961,\nlacks even that: it’s typed and stamped and utterly without character. But of\ncourse the computer interfaces used for so many forms nowadays are more boring\nstill. It’s as if the creators of these documents were gradually trying to\nstrip them of anything even slightly profound, or remotely symbolic.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that all this might drive an anthropologist to despair.\nAnthropologists are drawn to areas of density. The interpretative tools we\nhave at our disposal are best suited to wend our way through complex webs of\nmeaning or signification—we seek to understand intricate ritual symbolism,\nsocial dramas, poetic forms, or kinship networks. What all these have in\ncommon is that they tend to be both infinitely rich, and, at the same time,\nopen-ended. If one sought out to exhaust every meaning, motive, or association\npacked into a single Romanian harvest ritual, or Zande witchcraft accusation,\nor Mexican family saga, one could easily spend a lifetime—quite a number of\nlifetimes, in fact, if one were also out to trace the fan of relations with\nother elements in the larger social or symbolic fields such work invariably\nopens up. Paperwork in contrast is designed to be maximally simple and self-\ncontained. Even when forms are complex, even bafflingly complex, it’s by an\nendless accretion of very simple but apparently contradictory elements, like a\nmaze composed entirely of the endless juxtaposition of two or three very\nsimple geometrical motifs. And like a maze, paperwork doesn’t really open on\nanything outside itself. As a result, there just isn’t very much to interpret.\nClifford Geertz became famous for offering a “thick description” of Balinese\ncockfights where he tried to demonstrate that, if one were able to unpack\neverything going on in a given match, one would be able to understand\neverything about Balinese society: they’re conceptions of the human condition,\nof society, hierarchy, nature, all the fundamental passions and dilemmas of\nhuman existence. This simply would not be possible to do with a mortgage\napplication, no matter how dense the document itself; and even if some defiant\nsoul set out to write such an analysis—just to prove it could be done—it would\nbe even harder to imagine anyone else actually reading it.\n\nOne might object: but haven’t great novelists often written compelling\nliterature about bureaucracy? Of course they have. But they have managed to do\nthis by embracing the very circularity and emptiness—not to mention idiocy—of\nbureaucracy, and producing literary works that partake of something like the\nsame mazelike, senseless form. This is why almost all great literature on the\nsubject takes the form of horror-comedy. Franz Kafka’s _The Trial_ is of\ncourse the paradigm (as is _The Castle_), but one can cite any number of\nothers: from Stanislaw Lem’s _Memoirs Found in a Bathtub_ , which is pretty\nmuch straight Kafka, to Ismail Kadare’s _Palace of Dreams_ and José Saramago’s\n_All the Names_ , to any number of works that might be said to be informed by\nthe bureaucratic spirit, such as much of Italo Calvino or most anything by\nBorges. Joseph Heller’s _Catch-22_ , which takes on military bureaucracies,\nand _Something Happened_ , about corporate bureaucracies, are considered\nlatter-day masterworks in this genre, as is David Foster Wallace’s unfinished\n_The Pale King_ , an imaginative meditation on the nature of boredom set in a\nMidwestern office of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. It’s interesting that\njust about all these works of fiction not only emphasize the comic\nsenselessness of bureaucratic life, but mix it with at least an undertone of\nviolence. This is more obvious in some authors (Kafka and Heller, for example)\nthan others, but it almost always seems to be lurking just underneath the\nsurface. What’s more, contemporary stories that are explicitly _about_\nviolence have a tendency to also become stories about bureaucracy, since,\nafter all, most acts of extreme violence either take place in bureaucratic\nenvironments (armies, prisons …) or else, they are almost immediately\nsurrounded by bureaucratic procedures (crime).\n\nGreat writers, then, know how to deal with a vacuum. They embrace it. They\nstare into the abyss until the abyss stares back into them. Social theory, in\ncontrast, abhors a vacuum—or, this is certainly true if its approach to\nbureaucracy is anything to go on. Stupidity and violence are precisely the\nelements it is least inclined to talk\nabout.[42](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn42)\n\nThe lack of critical work is especially odd because on the surface, you would\nthink academics are personally positioned to speak of the absurdities of\nbureaucratic life. Of course, this is in part because they _are_\nbureaucrats—increasingly so. “Administrative responsibilities,” going to\ncommittee meetings, filling out forms, reading and writing letters of support,\nplacating the whims of minor deans—all this takes up an ever-expanding portion\nof the average academic’s time. But academics are also reluctant bureaucrats,\nin the sense that even when “admin,” as it’s called, ends up becoming most of\nwhat a professor actually does, it is always treated as something tacked\non—not what they are really qualified for, certainly, and not the work that\ndefines who they really are.[43](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn43) They are\nscholars—people who research, analyze, and interpret things—even if\nincreasingly, they’re really scholarly souls trapped in a bureaucrat’s body.\nYou might think that an academic’s reaction would be to research, analyze, and\ninterpret this very phenomenon: how does it happen that we all end up spending\nmore and more of our time on paperwork? What is the meaning of paperwork\nanyway? What are the social dynamics behind it? Yet for some reason, this\nnever happens.[44](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn44)\n\nIt has been my experience that when academics gather around the water cooler\n(or the academic equivalent of a water cooler, which is usually a coffee\nmachine) they rarely talk about their “real” work but spend almost all their\ntime complaining about administrative responsibilities. But in those ever-\nshrinking moments where they are allowed to think profound thoughts, this\nseems to be the last thing they’d wish to think about.\n\nBut there is something even deeper going on here, I suspect—something that\nbears on the very nature of what universities are and why they exist.\n\nConsider, for example, the extraordinary prominence in U.S. social science in\nthe postwar period of two continental theorists: German sociologist Max Weber\nin the fifties and sixties, and French historian and social philosopher Michel\nFoucault ever since. Each attained a kind of intellectual hegemony in the\nUnited States that they never managed to achieve in their own countries. What\nmade them so appealing to American academics? No doubt their popularity had\nmuch to do with the ease with which each could be adopted as a kind of anti-\nMarx, their theories put forth (usually in crudely simplified form) as ways of\narguing that power is not simply or primarily a matter of the control of\nproduction but rather a pervasive, multifaceted, and unavoidable feature of\nany social life.\n\nBut I also think that a large part of the appeal was their attitude toward\nbureaucracy. Indeed, it sometimes seems that these were the only two\nintelligent human beings in twentieth century history who honestly believed\nthat the power of bureaucracy lies in its effectiveness. That is, that\nbureaucracy really works. Weber saw bureaucratic forms of organization as the\nvery embodiment of Reason in human affairs, so obviously superior to any\nalternative form of organization that they threatened to engulf everything,\nlocking humanity in a joyless “iron cage,” bereft of spirit and charisma.\nFoucault was more subversive, but he was subversive in a way that only endowed\nbureaucratic power with more effectiveness, not less. In his work on asylums,\nclinics, prisons, and the rest, absolutely every aspect of human life—health,\nsexuality, work, morality, our very conceptions of truth—became nothing in and\nof themselves, but merely products of one or another form of professional or\nadministrative discourse. Through concepts like governmentality and biopower,\nhe argued that state bureaucracies end up shaping the parameters of human\nexistence in ways far more intimate than anything Weber would have imagined.\nFor Foucault, all forms of knowledge became forms of power, shaping our minds\nand bodies through largely administrative means.\n\nIt’s hard to avoid the suspicion that Weber and Foucault’s popularity owed\nmuch to the fact that the American university system during this period had\nitself increasingly become an institution dedicated to producing functionaries\nfor an imperial administrative apparatus, operating on a global scale. In the\nimmediate wake of World War II, when the United States was first establishing\nits global administrative apparatus, all this was often fairly explicit.\nSociologists like Talcott Parsons and Edward\nShils[45](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn45) were deeply embedded in the Cold\nWar establishment at Harvard, and the stripped-down version of Weber they\ncreated was quickly stripped down even further and adopted by State Department\nfunctionaries and the World Bank as “development theory,” and actively\npromoted as an alternative to Marxist historical materialism in the\nbattleground states of the Global South. At that time, even anthropologists\nlike Margaret Mead, Ruth Benedict, and Clifford Geertz had no compunctions\nagainst cooperating closely with the military-intelligence apparatus, or even\nthe CIA.[46](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn46) All this changed with the war\nin Vietnam. During the course of campus mobilizations against the war, this\nkind of complicity was thrown under a spotlight, and Parsons—and with him,\nWeber—came to be seen as the very embodiment of everything radicals sought to\nreject.\n\nWith Weber dethroned, it was at first unclear who, if anyone, would replace\nhim. For a while there was a lot of interest in German Marxism: Adorno,\nBenjamin, Marcuse, Lukacs, Fromm. But the focus eventually shifted to France,\nwhere the uprising of May 1968 had produced an efflorescence of extremely\ncreative social theory—in France it was just called “ ’68 thought”—that was\nsimultaneously radical in temperament, and hostile to almost every traditional\nmanifestation of leftist politics, from union organizing to\ninsurrection.[47](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn47) Different theorists\nshifted in and out of fashion, but over the course of the eighties, Foucault\nmanaged to establish himself in a way no one—even, really, Weber—has before or\nsince. Or, at least, he did so within those disciplines that considered\nthemselves in any way oppositional. Ultimately, it might be better to speak\nhere of the emergence of a kind of division of academic labor within the\nAmerican higher education system, with the optimistic side of Weber reinvented\n(in even more simplified form) for the actual training of bureaucrats under\nthe name of “rational choice theory,” while his pessimistic side was relegated\nto the Foucauldians. Foucault’s ascendancy in turn was precisely within those\nfields of academic endeavor that absorbed former campus radicals, or those who\nidentified with them. These disciplines were almost completely divorced from\nany access to political power, or increasingly, any influence on social\nmovements, as well—a distance that gave Foucault’s emphasis on the\n“power/knowledge” nexus (the assertion that forms of knowledge are always also\nforms of social power—indeed, the most important forms of social power) a\nparticular appeal.\n\nNo doubt any such pocket historical summary can only be a bit caricaturish and\nunfair. Still, I believe there is a profound truth here. It is not just that\nacademics are drawn to areas of density, where our skills at interpretation\nare best deployed. We also have an increasing tendency to identify what’s\ninteresting with what’s important, and to assume that places of density are\nalso places of power. The power of bureaucracy shows just how often exactly\nthe opposite is in fact the case.\n\nBut this essay is not just—or not even primarily—about bureaucracy. It is\nprimarily about violence. What I would like to argue is that situations\ncreated by violence—particularly structural violence, by which I mean forms of\npervasive social inequality that are ultimately backed up by the threat of\nphysical harm—invariably tend to create the kinds of willful blindness we\nnormally associate with bureaucratic procedures. To put it crudely: it is not\nso much that bureaucratic procedures are inherently stupid, or even that they\ntend to produce behavior that they themselves define as stupid—though they do\ndo that—but rather, that they are invariably ways of managing social\nsituations that are already stupid because they are founded on structural\nviolence. This approach, I think, has the potential to tell us a great deal\nabout both how bureaucracy has come to pervade every aspect of our lives, and\nwhy we don’t notice it.\n\n•\n\nNow, I admit that this emphasis on violence might seem odd. We are not used to\nthinking of nursing homes or banks or even HMOs as violent institutions—except\nperhaps in the most abstract and metaphorical sense. But the violence I’m\nreferring to here is not abstract. I am not speaking of conceptual violence. I\nam speaking of violence in the literal sense: the kind that involves, say, one\nperson hitting another over the head with a wooden stick. All of these are\ninstitutions involved in the allocation of resources within a system of\nproperty rights regulated and guaranteed by governments in a system that\nultimately rests on the threat of force. “Force” in turn is just a euphemistic\nway to refer to violence: that is, the ability to call up people dressed in\nuniforms, willing to threaten to hit others over the head with wooden sticks.\n\nIt is curious how rarely citizens in industrial democracies actually think\nabout this fact, or how instinctively we try to discount its importance. This\nis what makes it possible, for example, for graduate students to be able to\nspend days in the stacks of university libraries poring over Foucault-inspired\ntheoretical tracts about the declining importance of coercion as a factor in\nmodern life without ever reflecting on that fact that, had they insisted on\ntheir right to enter the stacks without showing a properly stamped and\nvalidated ID, armed men would have been summoned to physically remove them,\nusing whatever force might be required. It’s almost as if the more we allow\naspects of our everyday existence to fall under the purview of bureaucratic\nregulations, the more everyone concerned colludes to downplay the fact\n(perfectly obvious to those actually running the system) that all of it\nultimately depends on the threat of physical harm.\n\nActually, the very use of the term “structural violence” is an excellent case\nin point. When I first began working on this essay, I simply took it for\ngranted that the term referred to actual violence that operates in an indirect\nform. Imagine, if you will, some warlike tribe (let’s call them the Alphas)\nthat sweeps out of the desert and seizes a swath of land inhabited by peaceful\nfarmers (let’s call them the Omegas). But instead of exacting tribute, they\nappropriate all the fertile land, and arrange for their children to have\nprivileged access to most forms of practical education, at the same time\ninitiating a religious ideology that holds that they are intrinsically\nsuperior beings, finer and more beautiful and more intelligent, and that the\nOmegas, now largely reduced to working on their estates, have been cursed by\nthe divine powers for some terrible sin, and have become stupid, ugly, and\nbase. And perhaps the Omegas internalize their disgrace and come to act as if\nthey believe they really are guilty of something. In a sense perhaps they do\nbelieve it. But on a deeper level it doesn’t make a lot of sense to ask\nwhether they do or not. The whole arrangement is the fruit of violence and can\nonly be maintained by the continual threat of violence: the fact that the\nOmegas are quite aware that if anyone directly challenged property\narrangements, or access to education, swords would be drawn and people’s heads\nwould almost certainly end up being lopped off. In a case like this, what we\ntalk about in terms of “belief” are simply the psychological techniques people\ndevelop to accommodate themselves to this reality. We have no idea how they\nwould act, or what they would think, if the Alphas’ command of the means of\nviolence were to somehow disappear.\n\nThis is what I had in mind when I first began using the phrase “structural\nviolence”—structures that could only be created and maintained by the threat\nof violence, even if in their ordinary, day-to-day workings, no actual\nphysical violence need take place. If one reflects on the matter, the same can\nbe said of most phenomena that are ordinarily referred to as “structural\nviolence” in the literature—racism, sexism, class privilege—even if their\nactual mode of operation is infinitely more complex.\n\nHere I was probably inspired most by my readings in feminist literature, which\noften does speak of structural violence in this\nway.[48](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn48) It is widely noted, for instance,\nthat rates of sexual assault increase dramatically at precisely the moments\nwhen women begin challenging “gender norms” of work, comportment, or dress.\nIt’s really quite the same as the conquerors suddenly taking out their swords\nagain. But for the most part, academics do not use the term this way. The\ncurrent usage really harkens back to sixties “Peace Studies,” and it is used\nit to refer to “structures” that, it is claimed, have the same effects as\nviolence, even though they may not involve physical acts of violence at\nall.[49](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn49) The list of structures is pretty\nmuch the same list (racism, sexism, poverty, and the rest), but the\nimplication is there _could_ , for example, exist a system of patriarchy that\noperated in the total absence of domestic violence or sexual assault, or a\nsystem of racism that was in no way backed up by government-enforced property\nrights—despite the fact that, to my knowledge, no example of either has ever\nbeen observed.[50](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn50) Once again, it’s\npuzzling why anyone would make such an argument, unless they were for some\nreason determined to insist that the physical violence isn’t the essence of\nthe thing, that this isn’t what really needs to be addressed. To pose the\nquestion of violence directly would, apparently, mean opening a series of\ndoors that most academics seem to feel would really better be left shut.\n\nMost of these doors lead directly to the problem of what we call “the\nstate”—and the bureaucratic structures through which it actually exercises\npower. Is the state’s claim to a monopoly of violence ultimately the problem,\nor is the state an essential part of any possible solution? Is the very\npractice of laying down rules and then threatening physical harm against\nanyone who does not follow them itself objectionable, or is it just that the\nauthorities are not deploying such threats in the right way? To talk of\nracism, sexism, and the rest as a bunch of abstract structures floating about\nis the best way to dodge such questions entirely.\n\nIn many of the rural communities anthropologists are most familiar with, where\nmodern administrative techniques are explicitly seen as alien impositions,\nthings much more resemble my example of the Alphas and Omegas. We are usually\ndealing with conquered populations of one sort or another—hence, with people\nwho are keenly aware that current arrangements are the fruit of violence. As a\nresult, it would never occur to anyone to deny that the government is a\nfundamentally coercive institution—even if they might also be perfectly\nwilling to concede that in certain respects, it could also be a benevolent\none. In the part of rural Madagascar where I did my fieldwork, for example,\neveryone took it for granted that states operate primarily by inspiring fear.\nIt was assumed to be just as true of the old Malagasy kingdoms as of the\nsubsequent French colonial regime, or its contemporary Malagasy successor,\nwhich was seen as basically a slightly retooled version of the same thing. On\nthe other hand, the fear it inspired was decidedly sporadic, since much of the\ntime, the state, or its representatives, were not really around. Government\nplayed almost no role in regulating the minutiae of daily life: there were no\nbuilding codes, no open container laws, no mandatory licensing and insurance\nof vehicles, no rules about who could buy or sell or smoke or build or eat or\ndrink what where, where people could play music or tend their animals. Or\nanyway, if there were such laws, no one knew what they were because it never\noccurred to anyone, even the police, to enforce them—even in town, and\ndefinitely not in the surrounding countryside, where such matters were\nentirely regulated by custom, deliberation by communal assemblies, or magical\ntaboo. In such contexts, it became all the more apparent that the main\nbusiness of government bureaucracy was the registration of taxable property,\nand maintaining the infrastructure that allowed those who collected taxes to\nshow up and take their things away.\n\nThis situation actually created some interesting dilemmas for my own research.\nI had done a good deal of work in the Malagasy national archives before\nheading out to the countryside. The nineteenth-century Merina kingdom had\nbrought in foreign missionaries to help them train a civil service, and the\nrecords were all still there, along with those of the colonial regime. As a\nresult, from about 1875 to 1950, I had quite a wealth of data for the\ncommunity I was studying: census data, school records, and above all, precise\nfigures about the size of each family and its holdings in land and cattle—and\nin the earlier period, slaves. But as soon as I arrived I discovered this was\nprecisely what most people assumed an outsider arriving from the capital would\nbe most likely to ask about, and therefore, which they were least inclined to\ntell them. In fact, people were willing to talk about almost anything else. As\na result, I had almost completely different sorts of data for the two\nhistorical periods.\n\nAs I got to know people better, I slowly realized that it wasn’t just that the\ngovernment didn’t regulate daily life—in most important respects, the\ngovernment didn’t do anything at all. State power has a tendency to ebb and\nflow in Malagasy history, and this was a definite ebb. There were government\noffices, of course, and people sat in them typing and registering things, but\nit was mainly just for show—they were barely paid, received no materials (they\nhad to buy their own paper), everyone lied on their tax assessments, and no\none really paid the taxes anyway. Police just patrolled the highway and would\nnot go into the countryside at all. Yet everyone would talk about the\ngovernment as if it actually existed, hoping outsiders wouldn’t notice, which\nmight possibly lead to someone in some office in the capital deciding they\nmight have to do something about the situation. So on one level, bureaucratic\npower had almost no effect on people. On another, it colored everything.\n\nPart of the reason was the initial impact of conquest nearly a hundred years\nbefore. At the time, most inhabitants of the Merina kingdom had been\nslaveholders, at the heart of a great kingdom. An important thing to remember\nabout slavery is that it is never seen—by anyone really—as a moral\nrelationship, but one of simple arbitrary power: the master can order the\nslave to do whatever he pleases, and there’s really nothing the slave can do\nabout it.[51](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn51) When the French overthrew the\nMerina kingdom and took over Madagascar in 1895, they simultaneously abolished\nslavery and imposed a government that similarly did not even pretend to be\nbased on a social contract or the will of the governed, but was simply based\non superior firepower. Unsurprisingly, most Malagasy concluded that they had\nall been effectively turned into slaves. This had profound relations on how\npeople came to deal with one another. Before long, any relation of\ncommand—that is, any ongoing relationship between adults where one renders the\nother a mere extension of his or her will—was considered morally\nobjectionable, essentially just variations on slavery, or the state. Proper\nMalagasy people didn’t act this way. So even though the Malagasy government\nwas far away, its shadow was everywhere. In the community I studied, such\nassociations were most likely to come to the fore when people spoke of the\ngreat slave-holding families of the nineteenth century, whose children went on\nto become the core of the colonial-era administration, largely (it was always\nremarked) by dint of their devotion to education and skill with paperwork, and\nwhose descendants still mostly worked in fancy offices in the capital, far\nfrom the worries and responsibilities of rural life. In other contexts,\nrelations of command, particularly in bureaucratic contexts, were\nlinguistically coded: they were firmly identified with French; Malagasy, in\ncontrast, was seen as the language appropriate to deliberation, explanation,\nand consensus decision-making. Minor functionaries, when they wished to impose\narbitrary dictates, would almost invariably switch to French.\n\nI have particularly vivid memories of one occasion when an affable minor\nofficial who had had many conversations with me in Malagasy was flustered one\nday to discover me dropping by at exactly the moment everyone had apparently\ndecided to go home early to watch a football game. (As I mentioned, they\nweren’t really doing anything in these offices anyway.)\n\n“The office is closed,” he announced, in French, pulling himself up into an\nuncharacteristically formal pose. “If you have any business at the office you\nmust return tomorrow at eight a.m.”\n\nThis puzzled me. He knew English was my native language; he knew I spoke\nfluent Malagasy; he had no way to know I could even understand spoken French.\nI pretended confusion and replied, in Malagasy, “Excuse me? I’m sorry, I don’t\nunderstand you.”\n\nHis response was to pull himself up even taller and just say the same thing\nagain, slightly slower and louder. I once again feigned incomprehension. “I\ndon’t get it,” I said, “why are you speaking to me in a language I don’t even\nknow?” He did it again.\n\nIn fact, he proved utterly incapable of repeating the sentence in the\nvernacular, or, for that matter, of saying anything else at all in Malagasy. I\nsuspected this was because if he had switched to everyday language, he would\nnot feel he could be nearly so abrupt. Others later confirmed this was exactly\nwhat was happening: if he were speaking Malagasy, he would at the very least\nhave had to explain why the office had closed at such an unusual time. In\nliterary Malagasy, the French language can actually be referred to as _ny teny\nbaiko_ , “the language of command.” It was characteristic of contexts where\nexplanations, deliberation, and, ultimately, consent, were not required, since\nsuch contexts were shaped by the presumption of unequal access to sheer\nphysical force. In this instance, the actual means to deploy such force was no\nlonger present. The official could not in fact call the police, and nor would\nhe want to—he just wanted me to go away, which, after teasing him for a moment\nwith my language games, I did. But he couldn’t even evoke the kind of attitude\nsuch power allows one to adopt without calling up the shadow of the colonial\nstate.\n\nIn Madagascar, bureaucratic power was somewhat redeemed in most people’s minds\nby its connection to education, which was held in near-universal esteem. To\nenter into the world of government, bureaus, and gendarme stations was also to\nenter into the world of novels, world history, technology, and potential\ntravel overseas. It was not therefore irredeemably bad or intrinsically\nabsurd.\n\nBut the Malagasy state was also not particularly violent. Comparative analysis\nsuggests there is a direct relation however between the level of violence\nemployed in a bureaucratic system, and the level of absurdity and ignorance it\nis seen to produce. Keith Breckenridge, for example, has documented at some\nlength the regimes of “power without knowledge” typical of colonial South\nAfrica,[52](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn52) where coercion and paperwork\nlargely substituted for the need for understanding African subjects. The\nactual installation of apartheid that began in the 1950s, for example, was\nheralded by a new pass system that was designed to simplify earlier rules that\nobliged African workers to carry extensive documentation of labor contracts,\nsubstituting a single identity booklet, marked with their “names, locale,\nfingerprints, tax status, and their officially prescribed ‘rights’ to live and\nwork in the towns and cities,” and nothing\nelse.[53](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn53) Government functionaries\nappreciated it for streamlining administration, police for relieving them of\nthe responsibility of having to actually talk to African workers. African\nworkers, for their parts, universally referred to the new document as the\n“dompas,” or “stupid pass,” for precisely that reason.\n\nAndrew Mathews’s brilliant ethnography of the Mexican forestry service in\nOaxaca likewise demonstrates that it is precisely the near-total inequality of\npower between government officials and local farmers that allows foresters to\nremain in a kind of ideological bubble, maintaining simple black-and-white\nideas about forest fires (for instance) that allow them to remain pretty much\nthe only people in Oaxaca who don’t understand what effects their regulations\nactually have.[54](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn54)\n\nThere are traces of the link between coercion and absurdity even in the way we\ntalk about bureaucracy in English: note for example, how most of the\ncolloquial terms that specifically refer to bureaucratic foolishness—SNAFU,\nCatch-22, and the like—derive from military slang. More generally, political\nscientists have long observed a “negative correlation,” as David Apter put\nit,[55](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn55) between coercion and information:\nthat is, while relatively democratic regimes tend to be awash in too much\ninformation, as everyone bombards political authorities with explanations and\ndemands, the more authoritarian and repressive a regime, the less reason\npeople have to tell it anything—which is why such regimes are forced to rely\nso heavily on spies, intelligence agencies, and secret police.\n\nViolence’s capacity to allow arbitrary decisions, and thus to avoid the kind\nof debate, clarification, and renegotiation typical of more egalitarian social\nrelations, is obviously what allows its victims to see procedures created on\nthe basis of violence as stupid or unreasonable. Most of us are capable of\ngetting a superficial sense of what others are thinking or feeling just by\nobserving their tone of voice, or body language—it’s usually not hard to get a\nsense of people’s immediate intentions and motives, but going beyond that\nsuperficial often takes a great deal of work. Much of the everyday business of\nsocial life, in fact, consists in trying to decipher others’ motives and\nperceptions. Let us call this “interpretive labor.” One might say, those\nrelying on the fear of force are not obliged to engage in a lot of\ninterpretative labor, and thus, generally speaking, they do not.\n\nAs an anthropologist, I know I am treading perilous ground here. When they do\nturn their attention to violence, anthropologists tend to emphasize exactly\nthe opposite aspect: the ways that acts of violence are meaningful and\ncommunicative—even the ways that they can resembles\npoetry.[56](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn56) Anyone suggesting otherwise is\nlikely to be instantly accused of a kind of philistinism: “are you honestly\nsuggesting that violence is _not_ symbolically powerful, that bullets and\nbombs are _not_ meant to communicate something?” So for the record: no, I’m\nnot suggesting that. But I am suggesting that this might not be the most\nimportant question. First of all, because it assumes that “violence” refers\nprimarily to _acts_ of violence—actual shovings, punchings, stabbings, or\nexplosions—rather than to the _threat_ of violence, and the kinds of social\nrelations the pervasive threat of violence makes\npossible.[57](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn57) Second of all, because this\nseems to be one area where anthropologists, and academics more generally, are\nparticularly prone to fall victim to the confusion of interpretive depth and\nsocial significance. That is, they automatically assume that what is most\ninteresting about violence is also what’s most important.\n\nLet me take these points one at a time. Is it accurate to say that acts of\nviolence are, generally speaking, also acts of communication? It certainly is.\nBut this is true of pretty much any form of human action. It strikes me that\nwhat is really important about violence is that it is perhaps the only form of\nhuman action that holds out even the possibility of having social effects\n_without_ being communicative. To be more precise: violence may well be the\nonly way it is possible for one human being to do something which will have\nrelatively predictable effects on the actions of a person about whom they\nunderstand nothing. In pretty much any other way in which you might try to\ninfluence another’s actions, you must at least have some idea about who you\nthink they are, who they think you are, what they might want out of the\nsituation, their aversions and proclivities, and so forth. Hit them over the\nhead hard enough, and all of this becomes irrelevant.\n\nIt is true that the effects one can have by disabling or killing someone are\nvery limited. But they are real enough—and critically, it is possible to know\nin advance exactly what they are going to be. Any alternative form of action\ncannot, without some sort of appeal to shared meanings or understandings, have\nany predictable effects at all. What’s more, while attempts to influence\nothers by the threat of violence do require some level of shared\nunderstandings, these can be pretty minimal. Most human relations—particularly\nongoing ones, whether between longstanding friends or longstanding enemies—are\nextremely complicated, dense with history and meaning. Maintaining them\nrequires a constant and often subtle work of imagination, of endlessly trying\nto see the world from others’ points of view. This is what I’ve already\nreferred to as “interpretive labor.” Threatening others with physical harm\nallows the possibility of cutting through all this. It makes possible\nrelations of a far more simple and schematic kind (“cross this line and I will\nshoot you,” “one more word out of any of you and you’re going to jail”). This\nis of course why violence is so often the preferred weapon of the stupid. One\nmight even call it the trump card of the stupid, since (and this is surely one\nof the tragedies of human existence) it is the one form of stupidity to which\nit is most difficult to come up with an intelligent response.\n\nI do need to introduce one crucial qualification here. Everything, here,\ndepends on the balance of forces. If two parties are engaged in a relatively\nequal contest of violence—say, generals commanding opposing armies—they have\ngood reason to try to get inside each other’s heads. It is only when one side\nhas an overwhelming advantage in their capacity to cause physical harm that\nthey no longer need to do so. But this has very profound effects, because it\nmeans that the most characteristic effect of violence, its ability to obviate\nthe need for “interpretive labor,” becomes most salient when the violence\nitself is least visible—in fact, where acts of spectacular physical violence\nare least likely to occur. These are of course precisely what I have just\ndefined as situations of structural violence, systematic inequalities\nultimately backed up by the threat of force. For this reason, situations of\nstructural violence invariably produce extreme lopsided structures of\nimaginative identification.\n\nThese effects are often most visible when the structures of inequality take\nthe most deeply internalized forms. Gender is again a classic case in point.\nFor example, in American situation comedies of the 1950s, there was a constant\nstaple: jokes about the impossibility of understanding women. The jokes (told,\nof course, by men) always represented women’s logic as fundamentally alien and\nincomprehensible. “You have to love them,” the message always seemed to run,\n“but who can really understand how these creatures think?” One never had the\nimpression the women in question had any trouble understanding men. The reason\nis obvious. Women had no choice but to understand men. In America, the fifties\nwere the heyday of a certain ideal of the one-income patriarchal family, and\namong the more affluent, the ideal was often achieved. Women with no access to\ntheir own income or resources obviously had no choice but to spend a great\ndeal of time and energy understanding what their menfolk thought was going\non.[58](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn58)\n\nThis kind of rhetoric about the mysteries of womankind appears to be a\nperennial feature of such patriarchal arrangements. It is usually paired with\na sense that, though illogical and inexplicable, women still have access to\nmysterious, almost mystical wisdom (“women’s intuition”) unavailable to men.\nAnd of course something like this happens in any relation of extreme\ninequality: peasants, for example, are always represented as being both\noafishly simple, but somehow, also, mystically wise. Generations of women\nnovelists—Virginia Woolf comes most immediately to mind (_To the\nLighthouse_)—have documented the other side of such arrangements: the constant\nefforts women end up having to expend in managing, maintaining, and adjusting\nthe egos of oblivious and self-important men, involving the continual work of\nimaginative identification, or interpretive labor. This work carries over on\nevery level. Women everywhere are always expected to continually imagine what\none situation or another would look like from a male point of view. Men are\nalmost never expected to do the same for women. So deeply internalized is this\npattern of behavior that many men react to any suggestion that they might do\notherwise as if it were itself an act of violence. A popular exercise among\nhigh school creative writing teachers in America, for example, is to ask\nstudents to imagine they have been transformed, for a day, into someone of the\nopposite sex, and describe what that day might be like. The results,\napparently, are uncannily uniform. The girls all write long and detailed\nessays that clearly show they have spent a great deal of time thinking about\nthe subject. Usually, a good proportion of the boys refuse to write the essay\nentirely. Those who do make it clear they have not the slightest conception\nwhat being a teenage girl might be like, and are outraged at the suggestion\nthat they should have to think about\nit.[59](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn59)\n\nNothing I am saying here is particularly new to anyone familiar with Feminist\nStandpoint Theory or Critical Race Studies. Indeed, I was originally inspired\nto these broader reflections by a passage by bell hooks:\n\nAlthough there has never been any official body of black people in the United\nStates who have gathered as anthropologists and/or ethnographers to study\nwhiteness, black folks have, from slavery on, shared in conversations with one\nanother “special” knowledge of whiteness gleaned from close scrutiny of white\npeople. Deemed special because it is not a way of knowing that has been\nrecorded fully in written material, its purpose was to help black folks cope\nand survive in a white supremacist society. For years black domestic servants,\nworking in white homes, acted as informants who brought knowledge back to\nsegregated communities—details, facts, psychoanalytic readings of the white\n“Other.”[60](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn60)\n\nIf there is a limitation in the feminist literature, I would say, it’s that it\ncan be if anything a tad too generous, tending to emphasize the insights of\nthe oppressed over the blindness or foolishness of their\noppressors.[61](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn61)\n\nCould it be possible to develop a general theory of interpretive labor? We’d\nprobably have to begin by recognizing that there are two critical elements\nhere that, while linked, need to be formally distinguished. The first is the\nprocess of imaginative identification as a form of knowledge, the fact that\nwithin relations of domination, it is generally the subordinates who are\neffectively relegated the work of understanding how the social relations in\nquestion really work. Anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant kitchen, for\nexample, knows that if something goes terribly wrong and an angry boss appears\nto size things up, he is unlikely to carry out a detailed investigation, or\neven to pay serious attention to the workers all scrambling to explain their\nversion of what happened. He is much more likely to tell them all to shut up\nand arbitrarily impose a story that allows instant judgment: i.e., “you, Joe,\nyou wouldn’t have made a mistake like that; you, Mark, you’re the new guy, you\nmust have screwed up—if you do it again, you’re fired.” It’s those who do not\nhave the power to hire and fire who are left with the work of figuring out\nwhat actually did go wrong so as to make sure it doesn’t happen again. The\nsame thing usually happens with ongoing relations: everyone knows that\nservants tend to know a great deal about their employers’ families, but the\nopposite almost never occurs.\n\nThe second element is the resultant pattern of sympathetic identification.\nCuriously, it was Adam Smith, in his _Theory of Moral Sentiments_ , who first\nobserved the phenomenon we now refer to as “compassion fatigue.” Human beings,\nhe proposed, are normally inclined not only to imaginatively identify with\ntheir fellows, but as a result, to spontaneously feel one another’s joys and\nsorrows. The poor, however, are so consistently miserable that otherwise\nsympathetic observers are simply overwhelmed, and are forced, without\nrealizing it, to blot out their existence entirely. The result is that while\nthose on the bottom of a social ladder spend a great deal of time imagining\nthe perspectives of, and genuinely caring about, those on the top, it almost\nnever happens the other way around.\n\nWhether one is dealing with masters and servants, men and women, employers and\nemployees, rich and poor, structural inequality—what I’ve been calling\nstructural violence—invariably creates highly lopsided structures of the\nimagination. Since I think Smith was right to observe that imagination tends\nto bring with it sympathy, the result is that victims of structural violence\ntend to care about its beneficiaries far more than those beneficiaries care\nabout them. This might well be, after the violence itself, the single most\npowerful force preserving such relations.\n\nAt this point I can return to the question of bureaucracy.\n\nIn contemporary industrialized democracies, the legitimate administration of\nviolence is turned over to what is euphemistically referred to as “criminal\nlaw enforcement”—particularly, to police officers. I say “euphemistically”\nbecause generations of police sociologists have pointed out that only a very\nsmall proportion of what police actually do has anything to do with enforcing\ncriminal law—or with criminal matters of any kind. Most of it has to do with\nregulations, or, to put it slightly more technically, with the scientific\napplication of physical force, or the threat of physical force, to aid in the\nresolution of administrative problems.[62](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn62)\nIn other words they spend most of their time enforcing all those endless rules\nand regulations about who can buy or smoke or sell or build or eat or drink\nwhat where that don’t exist in places like small-town or rural Madagascar.\n\nSo: Police are bureaucrats with weapons.\n\nIf you think about it, this is a really ingenious trick. Because when most of\nus think about police, we do not think of them as enforcing regulations. We\nthink of them as fighting crime, and when we think of “crime,” the kind of\ncrime we have in our minds is violent\ncrime.[63](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn63) Even though, in fact, what\npolice mostly do is exactly the opposite: they bring the threat of force to\nbear on situations that would otherwise have nothing to do with it. I find\nthis all the time in public discussions. When trying to come up with a\nhypothetical example of a situation in which police are likely to be involved,\npeople will almost invariably think of some act of interpersonal violence: a\nmugging or assault. But even a moment’s reflection should make it clear that,\nwhen most real acts of physical assault do occur, even in major cities like\nMarseille or Montevideo or Minneapolis—domestic violence, gang fights, drunken\nbrawls—the police do not get involved. Police are only likely to be called in\nif someone dies, or is so seriously hurt they end up in the hospital. But this\nis because the moment an ambulance is involved, there is also paperwork; if\nsomeone is treated in the hospital, there has to be a cause of injury, the\ncircumstances become relevant, police reports have to be filed. And if someone\ndies there are all sorts of forms, up to and including municipal statistics.\nSo the only fights which police are sure to get involved in are those that\ngenerate some kind of paperwork. The vast majority of muggings or burglaries\naren’t reported either, unless there are insurance forms to be filled out, or\nlost documents that need to be replaced, and which can only be replaced if one\nfiles a proper police report. So most violent crime does not end up involving\nthe police.\n\nOn the other hand, try driving down the street of any one of those cities in a\ncar without license plates. We all know what’s going to happen. Uniformed\nofficers armed with sticks, guns, and/or tasers will appear on the scene\nalmost immediately, and if you simply refuse to comply with their\ninstructions, violent force will, most definitely, be applied.\n\nWhy are we so confused about what police really do? The obvious reason is that\nin the popular culture of the last fifty years or so, police have become\nalmost obsessive objects of imaginative identification in popular culture. It\nhas come to the point that it’s not at all unusual for a citizen in a\ncontemporary industrialized democracy to spend several hours a day reading\nbooks, watching movies, or viewing TV shows that invite them to look at the\nworld from a police point of view, and to vicariously participate in their\nexploits. And these imaginary police do, indeed, spend almost all of their\ntime fighting violent crime, or dealing with its consequences.\n\nIf nothing else, all this throws an odd wrinkle into Weber’s famous worries\nabout the iron cage: the danger that modern society will become so well\norganized by faceless technocrats that charismatic heroes, enchantment, and\nromance will completely disappear.[64](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn64)\nActually, as it turns out, bureaucratic society does indeed have a tendency to\nproduce its own, unique forms of charismatic hero. These have, since the late\nnineteenth century, arrived in the form of an endless assortment of mythic\ndetectives, police officers, and spies—all, significantly, figures whose job\nis to operate precisely where bureaucratic structures for ordering information\nencounter the actual application of physical violence. Bureaucracy, after all,\nhas been around for thousands of years, and bureaucratic societies, from Sumer\nand Egypt, to Imperial China, have produced great literature. But modern North\nAtlantic societies are the very first to have created genres of literature\nwhere the heroes themselves are bureaucrats, or operate entirely within\nbureaucratic environments.[65](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn65)\n\nIt strikes me that contemplating the role of the police in our society\nactually allows us some interesting insights into social theory. Now, I must\nadmit that over the course of this essay I have not been especially kind to\nacademics and most of their theoretical habits and predilections. I wouldn’t\nbe surprised if some were inclined to read what I’ve written as an argument\nthat social theory is largely pointless—the self-important fantasies of a\ncloistered elite who refuse to accept the simple realities of power. But this\nis not what I’m arguing at all. This essay is itself an exercise in social\ntheory, and if I didn’t think such exercises had the potential to throw\nimportant light on areas that would otherwise remain obscure, I would not have\nwritten it. The question is what kind, and to what purpose.\n\nHere a comparison of bureaucratic knowledge and theoretical knowledge is\nrevealing. Bureaucratic knowledge is all about schematization. In practice,\nbureaucratic procedure invariably means ignoring all the subtleties of real\nsocial existence and reducing everything to preconceived mechanical or\nstatistical formulae. Whether it’s a matter of forms, rules, statistics, or\nquestionnaires, it is always a matter of simplification. Typically, it’s not\nvery different from the boss who walks into the kitchen to make arbitrary snap\ndecisions as to what went wrong: in either case it is a matter of applying\nvery simple pre-existing templates to complex and often ambiguous situations.\nThe result often leaves those forced to deal with bureaucratic administration\nwith the impression that they are dealing with people who have for some\narbitrary reason decided to put on a set of glasses that only allows them to\nsee only 2 percent of what’s in front of them. But surely, something very\nsimilar happens in social theory as well. Anthropologists like to describe\nwhat they do as “thick description,” but in fact an ethnographic description,\neven a very good one, captures at best 2 percent of what’s happening in any\nparticular Nuer feud or Balinese cockfight. A theoretical work that draws on\nethnographic descriptions will typically focus on only a tiny part of _that_ ,\nplucking perhaps one or two strands out of an endlessly complex fabric of\nhuman circumstance, and using them as the basis on which to make\ngeneralizations: say, about the dynamics of social conflict, the nature of\nperformance, or the principle of hierarchy.\n\nI am not trying to say there’s anything wrong in this kind of theoretical\nreduction. To the contrary, I am convinced some such process is necessary if\none wishes to say something dramatically new about the world.\n\nConsider the role of structural analysis, of the sort that in the sixties and\nseventies was made famous by anthropologists like Claude Lévi-Strauss, or\nclassicists like Paul Vernant. Academic fashion being what it is, structural\nanalysis is currently considered definitively passé, and most anthropology\nstudents find Claude Lévi-Strauss’s entire corpus vaguely ridiculous. This\nstrikes me as unfortunate. Certainly insofar as Structuralism claimed to be a\nsingle, grandiose theory of the nature of thought, language, and society,\nproviding the key to unlocking all the mysteries of human culture, it was\nindeed ridiculous and has been justifiably abandoned. But structural analysis\nwasn’t a theory, it was a technique, and to toss that too out the window, as\nhas largely been done, robs us of one our most ingenious tools. Because the\ngreat merit of structural analysis is that it provides a well-nigh foolproof\ntechnique for doing what any good theory should do: simplifying and\nschematizing complex material in such a way as to be able to say something\nunexpected. This is incidentally how I came up with the point about Weber and\nheroes of bureaucracy a few paragraphs above. It all came from an experiment\ndemonstrating structural analysis to students at a seminar at Yale.\n\nThe basic principle of structural analysis, I was explaining, is that the\nterms of a symbolic system do not stand in isolation—they are not to be\nthought of in terms of what they “stand for,” but are defined by their\nrelations to each other. One has to first define the field, and then look for\nelements in that field that are systematic inversions of each other. Take\nvampires. First you place them: vampires are stock figures in American horror\nmovies. American horror movies constitute a kind of cosmology, a universe unto\nthemselves. Then you ask: what, within this cosmos, is the opposite of a\nvampire? The answer is obvious. The opposite of a vampire is a werewolf. On\none level they are the same: they are both monsters that can bite you and by\nbiting you, turn you, too, into one of their own kind. In most others ways\neach is an exact inversion of the other. Vampires are rich. They are typically\naristocrats. Werewolves are always poor. Vampires are fixed in space: they\nhave castles or crypts that they have to retreat to during the daytime;\nwerewolves are usually homeless derelicts, travelers, or otherwise on the run.\nVampires control other creatures (bats, wolves, humans that they hypnotize or\nrender thralls.) Werewolves can’t control themselves. Yet—and this is really\nthe clincher in this case—each can be destroyed only by its own negation:\nvampires, by a stake, a simple sharpened stick that peasants use to construct\nfences; werewolves, by a silver bullet, something literally made from money.\n\nBy observing these axes of inversion, we can get a sense of what such symbols\nare really about: that vampires, for instance, are not necessarily so much\nabout death, or fear, but about power; about the simultaneous feelings of\nattraction and repulsion that relations of domination tend to create.\n\nObviously this is an extremely simple example. What I’ve described is just the\ninitial move, there’s a whole series of more sophisticated ones that normally\nfollow: inversions within inversions, mediating terms, levels of hierarchical\nencompassment … There’s no need to go into any of that here. My point is just\nthat even by making this initial move, one will almost invariably discover\nsomething one would not have thought of otherwise. It’s a way of radically\nsimplifying reality that leads to insights one would almost certainly never\nhave achieved if one had simply attempted to take on the world in its full\ncomplexity.\n\nI often used that example when explaining structural analysis to students.\nStudents always liked it. One time, I suggested we try collectively try our\nhands at another analysis, of a similar pop culture figure, and someone\nsuggested James Bond.\n\nThis made sense to me: James Bond is clearly a mythical figure of some kind.\nBut who was his mythic opposite? The answer soon became obvious. James Bond\nwas the structural inversion of Sherlock Holmes. Both are London-based crime-\nfighters, and both permanent adolescents after their own fashion, even mild\nsociopaths, but otherwise, they are opposites in almost every way:\n\n![](../images/00010.jpeg)\n\nWhere Holmes is asexual but fond of cocaine and opium, Bond is oversexed, but\nuninterested in drugs except for liquor. Holmes is an amateur. Bond is the\nquintessential professional—he seems to have no life outside his work. Yet\nHolmes is an amateur who is almost preternaturally disciplined and competent,\nfar more than the professionals at Scotland Yard, while Bond is a professional\nwho is always allowing himself to become distracted, blowing his cover,\ngetting captured, or disobeying direct orders from his\nboss.[66](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn66)\n\nAll this, though, really just sets up the key inversion, which is in terms of\nwhat they actually _do_ : Sherlock Holmes seeks information about past acts of\nviolence inside his country, while James Bond seeks information about future\nacts of violence outside it.\n\nIt was in mapping out the field that I came to realize that everything here\nwas organized, precisely, around the relation between information and\nviolence—and that Sherlock Holmes and James Bond are, between them, the\nquintessential charismatic heroes of bureaucracy. The classic TV cop, or hero\nof any of the literally hundreds of “maverick-cop-who-breaks-all-the-rules”\nmovies that Hollywood has trundled out since the 1960s, is clearly a kind of\nsynthesis of these two figures: crime-fighters who exist within, but are\nconstantly bursting out, of the bureaucratic order, which is nonetheless their\nentire meaning and existence.[67](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn67)\n\nOne might object that all this is a simplification of a much richer, more\ncomplex and nuanced, tradition of popular culture. Of course it is. That’s the\nwhole point. Structural analysis of this sort makes a virtue of\nsimplification. For my own part, I see Lévi-Strauss as a kind of heroic figure\ntoo, a man with the sheer intellectual courage to pursue a few simple\nprinciples as far as they would go, no matter how apparently absurd or just\nplain wrong the results could sometimes be (the story of Oedipus is really\nabout eyes and feet; all social organizations are simply systems for the\nexchange of women)—or, if you prefer, how much violence he thus did to\nreality. Because it’s a productive violence. And nobody actually gets hurt.\n\nAs long as one remains within the domain of theory, then, I would argue that\nsimplification is not necessarily a form of stupidity—it can be a form of\nintelligence. Even of brilliance. The problems arise at the moment that\nviolence is no longer metaphorical. Here let me turn from imaginary cops to\nreal ones. Jim Cooper, a former LAPD officer turned\nsociologist,[68](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn68) has observed that the\noverwhelming majority of those who end up getting beaten or otherwise\nbrutalized by police turn out to be innocent of any crime. “Cops don’t beat up\nburglars,” he writes. The reason, he explained, is simple: the one thing most\nguaranteed to provoke a violent reaction from police is a challenge to their\nright to, as he puts it, “define the situation.” That is, to say “no, this\nisn’t a possible crime situation, this is a citizen-who-pays-your-salary-\nwalking-his-dog situation, so shove off,” let alone the invariably disastrous,\n“wait, why are you handcuffing that guy? He didn’t do anything!” It’s “talking\nback” above all that inspires beat-downs, and that means challenging whatever\nadministrative rubric (an orderly or a disorderly crowd? A properly or\nimproperly registered vehicle?) has been applied by the officer’s\ndiscretionary judgment. The police truncheon is precisely the point where the\nstate’s bureaucratic imperative for imposing simple administrative schema and\nits monopoly on coercive force come together. It only makes sense then that\nbureaucratic violence should consist first and foremost of attacks on those\nwho insist on alternative schemas or interpretations. At the same time, if one\naccepts Jean Piaget’s famous definition of mature intelligence as the ability\nto coordinate between multiple perspectives (or possible perspectives) one can\nsee, here, precisely how bureaucratic power, at the moment it turns to\nviolence, becomes literally a form of infantile stupidity.\n\nThis analysis, too, is no doubt a simplification, but it’s a productive one.\nLet me try to demonstrate this by applying some of these insights to\nunderstanding the type of politics that can emerge within a fundamentally\nbureaucratic society.\n\nOne of the central arguments of this essay so far is that structural violence\ncreates lopsided structures of the imagination. Those on the bottom of the\nheap have to spend a great deal of imaginative energy trying to understand the\nsocial dynamics that surround them—including having to imagine the\nperspectives of those on top—while the latter can wander about largely\noblivious to much of what is going on around them. That is, the powerless not\nonly end up doing most of the actual, physical labor required to keep society\nrunning, they also do most of the interpretive labor as well.\n\nThis much seems to be the case wherever one encounters systematic inequality.\nIt was just as true in ancient India or medieval China as it is anywhere\ntoday. And it will, presumably, remain true so long as structural inequalities\nendure. However, our own bureaucratic civilization introduces a further\nelement. Bureaucracies, I’ve suggested, are not themselves forms of stupidity\nso much as they are ways of organizing stupidity—of managing relationships\nthat are already characterized by extremely unequal structures of imagination,\nwhich exist because of the existence of structural violence. This is why even\nif a bureaucracy is created for entirely benevolent reasons, it will still\nproduce absurdities. And this, in turn, is why I began the essay the way I\ndid. I have no reason to believe anyone involved in my mother’s power of\nattorney drama (even the bank manager) was anything other than well-\nintentioned. Yet an absurd and apparently endless run-around nonetheless\nensued.\n\nWhy does this happen? Because even the most benevolent bureaucracies are\nreally just taking the highly schematized, minimal, blinkered perspectives\ntypical of the powerful, turning them into ways of limiting that power or\nameliorating its most pernicious effects. Surely, bureaucratic interventions\nalong these lines have done an enormous amount of good in the world. The\nEuropean social welfare state, with its free education and universal health\ncare, can justly be considered—as Pierre Bourdieu once remarked—one of the\ngreatest achievements of human civilization. But at the same time, in taking\nforms of willful blindness typical of the powerful and giving them the\nprestige of science—for instance, by adopting a whole series of assumptions\nabout the meaning of work, family, neighborhood, knowledge, health, happiness,\nor success that had almost nothing to do with the way poor or working-class\npeople actually lived their lives, let alone what they found meaningful in\nthem—it set itself up for a fall. And fall it did. It was precisely the\nuneasiness this blindness created even in the minds of its greatest\nbeneficiaries that allowed the Right to mobilize popular support for the\npolicies that have gutted and devastated even the most successful of these\nprograms since the eighties.\n\nAnd how was this uneasiness expressed? Largely, by the feeling that\nbureaucratic authority, by its very nature, represented a kind of war against\nthe human imagination. This becomes particularly clear if we look at the youth\nrebellions from China to Mexico to New York that culminated in the\ninsurrection of May 1968 in Paris. All were rebellions first and foremost\nagainst bureaucratic authority; all saw bureaucratic authority as\nfundamentally stifling of the human spirit, of creativity, conviviality,\nimagination. The famous slogan “All power to the imagination,” painted on the\nwalls of the Sorbonne, has haunted us ever since—endlessly repeated on\nposters, buttons, flyers, manifestos, films, and song lyrics, largely because\nit seems to embody something fundamental, not just to the spirit of sixties\nrebellion, but to the very essence of what we have come to call “the Left.”\n\nThis is important. Actually it could not be more important. Because I think\nwhat happened in ’68 reveals a contradiction at the very core of Leftist\nthought, from its very inception—a contradiction that only fully revealed\nitself at precisely the high-water mark of its historical success. In the\nintroduction to this volume, I suggested that the contemporary Left suffers\nfrom the lack of a coherent critique of bureaucracy. But if you really go back\nto the beginnings—to the idea that emerged around the time of the French\nRevolution that the political spectrum can be divided into a right- and left-\nwing in the first place—it becomes clear that the Left, in its essence, _is_ a\ncritique of bureaucracy, even if it’s one that has, again and again, been\nforced to accommodate itself in practice to the very bureaucratic structures\nand mindset it originally arose to\noppose.[69](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn69)\n\nIn this sense, the Left’s current inability to formulate a critique of\nbureaucracy that actually speaks to its erstwhile constituents is synonymous\nwith the decline of the Left itself. Without such a critique, radical thought\nloses its vital center—it collapses into a fragmented scatter of protests and\ndemands.\n\nIt seems that every time the Left decides to take a safe, “realistic” course,\nit just digs itself deeper. To understand how this happened, let alone what we\nmight be able to do about it, I think it will be necessary to reexamine some\nvery basic assumptions: first and foremost, about what it means to say one is\nbeing “realistic” to begin with.\n\n**_Be realistic: demand the impossible_.**\n\n(another ’68 slogan)\n\nSo far, I have been discussing how structural violence creates lopsided\nstructures of the imagination and how bureaucracy becomes a way of managing\nsuch situations—and the forms of structural blindness and stupidity they\ninevitably entail. Even at their best, bureaucratic procedures are ways to\nturn stupidity, as it were, against itself.\n\nWhy do movements challenging such structures so often end up creating\nbureaucracies instead? Normally, they do so as a kind of compromise. One must\nbe realistic and not demand too much. Welfare state reforms seem more\nrealistic than demanding a broad distribution of property; a “transitional”\nstage of state socialism seems more realistic than jumping immediately to\ngiving power to democratically organized workers’ councils, and so forth. But\nthis raises another question. When we speak of being “realistic,” exactly what\nreality is it we are referring to?\n\nHere, I think an anecdote about an activist group I was once involved with\nmight prove instructive.\n\nFrom early 2000 to late 2002, I was working with the New York Direct Action\nNetwork—the principal group responsible for organizing mass actions as part of\nthe global justice movement in New York City at that time. I call it a\n“group,” but technically DAN was not a group at all but a decentralized\nnetwork, operating on principles of direct democracy according to an\nelaborate, but quite effective, form of consensus process. It played a central\nrole in ongoing efforts to create new organizational forms. DAN existed in a\npurely political space. It had no concrete resources—not even a significant\ntreasury—to administer.\n\nThen one day someone gave DAN a car.\n\nThe DAN car caused a minor, but ongoing, crisis. We soon discovered that\nlegally, it is impossible for a decentralized network to own a car. Cars can\nbe owned by individuals, or they can be owned by corporations (which are\nfictive individuals), or by governments. But they cannot be owned by networks.\nUnless we were willing to incorporate ourselves as a nonprofit corporation\n(which would have required a complete reorganization and an abandonment of\nmost of our egalitarian principles) the only expedient was to find a volunteer\nwilling to claim to be the legal owner. But then that person was held\nresponsible for all outstanding fines and insurance fees, and had to provide\nwritten permission to allow anyone else to drive the car out of state. And, of\ncourse, only he could retrieve the car if it were impounded. One courageous\nactivist did agree to undertake the responsibility, but as a result, weekly\nmeetings were overwhelmed by reportbacks about his latest legal problems.\nBefore long the DAN car had become such an endless source of tribulation that\nwe decided to organize a fundraiser, throwing a big party where we provided a\nsledgehammer to anyone willing to pay five dollars to take a whack at the\nthing.\n\nIt struck me there was something profound to this story. Why is it that\nprojects like DAN’s—projects aimed at democratizing society—are so often\nperceived as idle dreams that melt away as soon as they encounter hard\nmaterial reality? In our case, at least, it had nothing to do with\ninefficiency: police chiefs across the country had called us the best\norganized force they’d ever had to deal with. It seems to me that the reality\neffect (if one may call it that) comes rather from the fact that radical\nprojects tend to founder—or at least become endlessly difficult—the moment\nthey enter into the world of large, heavy objects: buildings, cars, tractors,\nboats, industrial machinery. This in turn is not because these objects are\nsomehow intrinsically difficult to administer democratically—history is full\nof communities that successfully engage in the democratic administration of\ncommon resources—it’s because, like the DAN car, they are surrounded by\nendless government regulation, and are effectively impossible to hide from the\ngovernment’s armed representatives. In America, I have seen endless examples\nof this dilemma. A squat is legalized after a long struggle; suddenly,\nbuilding inspectors arrive to announce it will take ten thousand dollars’\nworth of repairs to bring it up to code. Organizers are therefore forced to\nspend the next several years organizing bake sales and soliciting\ncontributions. This means setting up bank accounts, which means, in turn,\nadhering to legal regulations that specify how any group receiving funds, or\ndealing with the government, must be organized (again, _not_ as an egalitarian\ncollective). All these regulations are enforced by violence. True, in ordinary\nlife, police rarely come in swinging billy clubs to enforce building code\nregulations, but, as anarchists often are often uniquely positioned to find\nout, if one simply pretends the state and its regulations don’t exist, this\nwill, eventually, happen. The rarity with which the nightsticks actually\nappear just helps to make the violence harder to see. This in turn makes the\neffects of all these regulations—regulations that almost always assume that\nnormal relations between individuals are mediated by the market, and that\nnormal groups are organized internally by relations of hierarchy and\ncommand—seem to emanate not from the government’s monopoly of the use of\nforce, but from the largeness, solidity, and heaviness of the objects\nthemselves.\n\nWhen one is asked to be “realistic,” then, the reality one is normally being\nasked to recognize is not one of natural, material facts, nor some supposed\nugly truth about human nature. Being “realistic” usually means taking\nseriously the effects of the systematic threat of violence. This possibility\neven threads our language. Why, for example, is a building referred to as\n“real property,” or “real estate”? The “real” in this usage is not derived\nfrom Latin _res_ , or “thing”: it’s from the Spanish _real_ , meaning,\n“royal,” “belonging to the king.” All land within a sovereign territory\nultimately belongs to the sovereign—legally this is still the case. This is\nwhy the state has the right to impose its regulations. But sovereignty\nultimately comes down to a monopoly on what is euphemistically referred to as\n“force”—that is, violence. Just as the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben\nargued that from the perspective of sovereign power, something is alive\nbecause you can kill it, so property is “real” because the state can seize or\ndestroy it.\n\nIn the same way, when one takes a “realist” position in International\nRelations, one assumes that states will use whatever capacities they have at\ntheir disposal, including force of arms, to pursue their national interests.\nWhat “reality” is one recognizing? Certainly not material reality. The idea\nthat nations are humanlike entities with purposes and interests is purely\nmetaphysical. The King of France had purposes and interests. “France” does\nnot. What makes it seem “realistic” to suggest it does is simply that those in\ncontrol of nation-states have the power to raise armies, launch invasions, and\nbomb cities, and can otherwise threaten the use of organized violence in the\nname of what they describe as their “national interests”—and that it would be\nfoolish to ignore that possibility. National interests are real because they\ncan kill you.\n\nThe critical term here is “force,” as in “the state’s monopoly on the use of\ncoercive force.” Whenever we hear this word invoked, we find ourselves in the\npresence of a political ontology in which the power to destroy, to cause\nothers pain or to threaten to break, damage, or mangle others’ bodies (or just\nlock them in a tiny room for the rest of their lives) is treated as the social\nequivalent of the very energy that drives the cosmos. Contemplate, if you\nwill, the metaphors and displacements that make it possible to construct the\nfollowing two sentences:\n\nScientists investigate the nature of physical laws so as to understand the\nforces that govern the universe.\n\nPolice are experts in the scientific application of physical force in order to\nenforce the laws that govern society.\n\nThis is to my mind the essence of right-wing thought: a political ontology\nthat through such subtle means allows violence to define the very parameters\nof social existence and common sense.[70](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn70)\n\nThis is why I say that the Left has always been, in its essential inspiration,\nantibureaucratic. Because it has always been founded on a different set of\nassumptions about what is ultimately real—that is, about the very grounds of\npolitical being. Obviously Leftists don’t deny the reality of violence. Many\nLeftist theorists think about it quite a lot. But they don’t tend to give it\nthe same foundational status. Instead, I would argue that Leftist thought is\nfounded on what I will call a “political ontology of the imagination” (though\nit could also, perhaps just as well, have been called an ontology of\ncreativity or making or invention.) Nowadays, most of us tend to identify this\ntendency with the legacy of Marx, with his emphasis on social revolution and\nforces of material production. Marx was ultimately only a man of his time, and\nhis terms emerged from much wider arguments about value, labor, and creativity\ncurrent in radical circles of his day, whether in the workers’ movement, or\nfor that matter in various strains of Romanticism and bohemian life emerging\naround him in Paris and London at the time. Marx himself, for all his contempt\nfor the utopian Socialists of his day, never ceased to insist that what makes\nhuman beings different from animals is that architects, unlike bees, first\nraise their structures in the imagination. It was the unique property of\nhumans, for Marx, that they first envision things, and only then bring them\ninto being. It was this process he referred to as “production.”\n\nAround the same time, utopian Socialists like St. Simon were arguing that\nartists needed to become the _avant-garde_ or “vanguard,” as he put it, of a\nnew social order, providing the grand visions that industry now had the power\nto bring into being. What at the time might have seemed the fantasy of an\neccentric pamphleteer soon became the charter for a sporadic, uncertain, but\napparently permanent alliance that endures to this day. If artistic avant-\ngardes and social revolutionaries have felt a peculiar affinity for one\nanother ever since, borrowing each other’s languages and ideas, it appears to\nhave been insofar as both have remained committed to the idea that the\nultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and\ncould just as easily make differently. In this sense, a phrase like “all power\nto the imagination” expresses the very quintessence of the Left.\n\nFrom a left perspective, then, the hidden reality of human life is the fact\nthat the world doesn’t just happen. It isn’t a natural fact, even though we\ntend to treat it as if it is—it exists because we all collectively produce it.\nWe imagine things we’d like and then we bring them into being. But the moment\nyou think about it in these terms, it’s obvious that something has gone\nterribly wrong. Since who, if they could simply imagine any world that they\nliked and then bring it into being, would create a world like this\none?[71](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn71) Perhaps the leftist sensibility\nwas expressed in its purest form in the words of Marxist philosopher John\nHolloway, who once wanted to title a book, “Stop Making\nCapitalism.”[72](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn72) Capitalism, he noted, is\nnot something imposed on us by some outside force. It only exists because\nevery day we wake up and continue to produce it. If we woke up one morning and\nall collectively decided to produce something else, then we wouldn’t have\ncapitalism anymore. This is the ultimate revolutionary question: what are the\nconditions that would have to exist to enable us to do this—to just wake up\nand imagine and produce something else?\n\nTo this emphasis on forces of creativity and production, the Right tends to\nreply that revolutionaries systematically neglect the social and historical\nimportance of the “means of destruction”: states, armies, executioners,\nbarbarian invasions, criminals, unruly mobs, and so on. Pretending such things\nare not there, or can simply be wished away, they argue, has the result of\nensuring that left-wing regimes will in fact create far more death and\ndestruction than those that have the wisdom to take a more “realistic”\napproach.\n\nObviously, this is something of a simplification, and one could make endless\nqualifications. The bourgeoisie of Marx’s time, for instance, had an extremely\nproductivist philosophy—one reason Marx could see it as a revolutionary force.\nElements of the Right dabbled with the artistic ideal, and twentieth-century\nMarxist regimes often embraced essentially right-wing theories of power and\npaid little more than lip service to the determinant nature of production. On\nthe other hand, in their obsession with jailing poets and playwrights whose\nwork they considered threatening, they evinced a profound faith in the power\nof art and creativity to change the world—those running capitalist regimes\nrarely bothered, convinced that if they kept a firm hand on the means of\nproductions (and, of course, the army and police), the rest would take care of\nitself.\n\nOne of the reasons it is difficult to see all this is because the word\n“imagination” can mean so many different things. In most modern definitions\nimagination is counterposed to reality; “imaginary” things are first and\nforemost things that aren’t really there. This can cause a great deal of\nconfusion when we speak of imagination in the abstract, because it makes it\nseem like imagination has much more do with Spenser’s _Faerie Queene_ than\nwith a group of waitresses trying to figure out how to placate the couple at\nTable 7 before the boss shows up.\n\nStill, this way of thinking about imagination is relatively new, and continues\nto coexist with much older ones. In the common Ancient and Medieval\nconception, for example, what we now call “the imagination” was not seen as\nopposed to reality per se, but as a kind of middle ground, a zone of passage\nconnecting material reality and the rational soul. This was especially true\nfor those who saw Reason as essentially an aspect of God, who felt that\nthought therefore partook in a divinity which in no way partook of—indeed, was\nabsolutely alien to—material reality. (This became the dominant position in\nthe Christian Middle Ages.) How, then, was it possible for the rational mind\nto receive sense impressions from nature?\n\nThe solution was to propose an intermediary substance, made out of the same\nmaterial as the stars, the “pneuma,” a kind of circulatory system through\nwhich perceptions of the material world could pass, becoming emotionally\ncharged in the process and mixing with all sorts of phantasms, before the\nrational mind could grasp their significance. Intentions and desires moved in\nthe opposite direction, circulating through the imagination before they could\nbe realized in the world. It’s only after Descartes, really, that the word\n“imaginary” came to mean, specifically, anything that is not real: imaginary\ncreatures, imaginary places (Narnia, planets in faraway galaxies, the Kingdom\nof Prester John), imaginary friends. By this definition, a “political ontology\nof the imagination” could only be a contradiction in terms. The imagination\ncannot be the basis of reality. It is by definition that which we can think,\nbut which has no reality.\n\nI’ll refer to this latter as “the transcendent notion of the imagination”\nsince it seems to take as its model novels or other works of fiction that\ncreate imaginary worlds that presumably remain the same no matter how many\ntimes one reads them. Imaginary creatures—elves or unicorns or TV cops—are not\naffected by the real world. They cannot be, since they don’t exist. In\ncontrast, the kind of imagination I have been developing in this essay is much\ncloser to the old, immanent, conception. Critically, it is in no sense static\nand free-floating, but entirely caught up in projects of action that aim to\nhave real effects on the material world, and as such, always changing and\nadapting. This is equally true whether one is crafting a knife or a piece of\njewelry, or trying to make sure one doesn’t hurt a friend’s feelings.\n\nIt was precisely in the mid- to late-eighteenth century, which saw the origins\nof industrial capitalism, modern bureaucratic society, and the political\ndivision between right and left, where the new transcendent concept of\nimagination really came to prominence. For Romantics, in particular, the\nImagination came to take the place once held by the soul—rather than mediating\nbetween the rational soul and the material world, it _was_ the soul, and the\nsoul was that which was beyond any mere rationality. It’s easy to see how the\nadvent of an impersonal, bureaucratic order of offices, factories, and\nrational administration would also give rise to this sort of idea. But insofar\nas the imagination became a residual category, everything that the new order\nwas not, it also was not purely transcendent; in fact, it necessarily became a\nkind of crazy hodgepodge of what I’ve been calling transcendent and immanent\nprinciples. On the one hand, the imagination was seen as the source of art,\nand all creativity. On the other, it was the basis of human sympathy, and\nhence morality.[73](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn73)\n\nTwo hundred and fifty years later, we might do well to begin to sort these\nmatters out.\n\nBecause honestly, there’s a lot at stake here. To get a sense of just how\nmuch, let’s return for a moment to that ’68 slogan: “All power to the\nimagination.” Which imagination are we referring to? If one takes this to\nrefer to the transcendent imagination—to an attempt to impose some sort of\nprefab utopian vision—the effects can be disastrous. Historically, it has\noften meant creating some vast bureaucratic machine designed to impose such\nutopian visions by violence. World-class atrocities are likely to result. On\nthe other hand, in a revolutionary situation, one might by the same token\nargue that _not_ giving full power to the other, immanent, sort of\nimagination—the practical common sense imagination of ordinary cooks, nurses,\nmechanics and gardeners—is likely to end up having exactly the same effects.\n\nThis confusion, this jumbling of different conceptions of imagination, runs\nthroughout the history of leftist thought.\n\nOne can already see the tension in Marx. There is a strange paradox in his\napproach to revolution. As I’ve noted, Marx insists that what makes us human\nis that rather than relying on unconscious instinct like spiders and bees, we\nfirst raise structures in our imagination, and then try to bring those visions\ninto being. When a spider weaves her web, she operates on instinct. The\narchitect first draws up a plan, and only then starts building the foundations\nof his edifice. This is true, Marx insists, in all forms of material\nproduction, whether we are building bridges or making boots. Yet when Marx\nspeaks of social creativity, his key example—the only kind of social\ncreativity he ever talks about actually—is always revolution, and when he does\nthat, he suddenly changes gears completely. In fact he reverses himself. The\nrevolutionary should never proceed like the architect; he should never begin\nby drawing up a plan for an ideal society, then think about how to bring it\ninto being. That would be utopianism. And for utopianism, Marx had nothing but\nwithering contempt. Instead, revolution is the actual immanent practice of the\nproletariat, which will ultimately bear fruit in ways that we cannot possibly\nimagine from our current vantage point.\n\nWhy the discrepancy? The most generous explanation, I would suggest, is that\nMarx did understand, at least on some intuitive level, that the imagination\nworked differently in the domain of material production than it did in social\nrelations; but also, that he lacked an adequate theory as to why. Perhaps,\nwriting in the mid-nineteenth century, long before the rise of feminism, he\nsimply lacked the intellectual tools.[74](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn74)\nGiven the considerations already outlined in this essay, I think we can\nconfirm that this is indeed the case. To put it in Marx’s own terms: in both\ndomains one can speak of alienation. But in each, alienation works in\nprofoundly different ways.\n\nTo recall the argument so far: structural inequalities always create what I’ve\ncalled “lopsided structures of imagination,” that is, divisions between one\nclass of people who end up doing most of the imaginative labor, and others who\ndo not. However, the sphere of factory production that Marx concerned himself\nwith is rather unusual in this respect. It is one of the few contexts where it\nis the dominant class who end up doing more imaginative labor, not less.\n\nCreativity and desire—what we often reduce, in political economy terms, to\n“production” and “consumption”—are essentially vehicles of the imagination.\nStructures of inequality and domination—structural violence, if you will—tend\nto skew the imagination. Structural violence might create situations where\nlaborers are relegated to mind-numbing, boring, mechanical jobs, and only a\nsmall elite is allowed to indulge in imaginative labor, leading to the\nfeeling, on the part of the workers, that they are alienated from their own\nlabor, that their very deeds belong to someone else. It might also create\nsocial situations where kings, politicians, celebrities, or CEOs prance about\noblivious to almost everything around them while their wives, servants, staff,\nand handlers spend all their time engaged in the imaginative work of\nmaintaining them in their fantasies. Most situations of inequality I suspect\ncombine elements of both.\n\nThe subjective experience of living inside such lopsided structures of\nimagination—the warping and shattering of imagination that results—is what we\nare referring to when we talk about “alienation.”\n\nThe tradition of Political Economy, within which Marx was writing, tends to\nsee work in modern societies as divided between two spheres: wage labor, for\nwhich the paradigm is always factories, and domestic labor—housework,\nchildcare—relegated mainly to women. The first is seen primarily as a matter\nof creating and maintaining physical objects. The second is probably best seen\nas a matter of creating and maintaining people and social relations. The\ndistinction is obviously a bit of a caricature: there has never been a\nsociety, not even Engels’s Manchester or Victor Hugo’s Paris, where most men\nwere factory workers and most women worked exclusively as housewives. Still,\nthis frames how we think about such issues today. It also points to the root\nof Marx’s problem. In the sphere of industry, it is generally those on top\nthat relegate to themselves the more imaginative tasks (i.e., they design the\nproducts and organize production), whereas when inequalities emerge in the\nsphere of social production, it is those on the bottom who end up expected to\ndo the major imaginative work—notably, the bulk of what I’ve called the “labor\nof interpretation” that keeps life\nrunning.[75](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn75)\n\nSo far I have proposed that bureaucratic procedures, which have an uncanny\nability to make even the smartest people act like idiots, are not so much\nforms of stupidity in themselves, as they are ways of managing situations\nalready stupid because of the effects of structural violence. As a result,\nsuch procedures come to partake of the very blindness and foolishness they\nseek to manage. At their best, they become ways of turning stupidity against\nitself, much in the same way that revolutionary violence could be said to be.\nBut stupidity in the name of fairness and decency is still stupidity, and\nviolence in the name of human liberation is still violence. It’s no\ncoincidence the two so often seem to arrive together.\n\nFor much of the last century, the great revolutionary question has thus been:\nhow does one affect fundamental change in society without setting in train a\nprocess that will end with the creation of some new, violent bureaucracy? Is\nutopianism the problem—the very idea of imagining a better world and then\ntrying to bring it into being? Or is it something in the very nature of social\ntheory? Should we thus abandon social theory? Or is the notion of revolution\nitself fundamentally flawed?\n\nSince the sixties, one common solution has been to start by lowering one’s\nsights. In the years leading up to May ’68, the Situationists famously argued\nthat it was possible to do this through creative acts of subversion that\nundermined the logic of what they called “the Spectacle,” which rendered us\npassive consumers. Through these acts, we could, at least momentarily,\nrecapture our imaginative powers. At the same time, they also felt that all\nsuch acts were small-scale dress rehearsals for the great insurrectionary\nmoment to which they would necessarily lead—“the” revolution, properly\nspeaking. This is what’s largely gone today. If the events of May ’68 showed\nanything, it was that if one does not aim to seize state power, there can be\nno fundamental, onetime break. As a result, among most contemporary\nrevolutionaries, that millenarian element has almost completely fallen away.\nNo one thinks the skies are about to open any time soon. There is a\nconsolation, though: that as a result, insofar as one actually can come to\nexperiencing genuine revolutionary freedom, one can begin to experience it\nimmediately. Consider the following statement from the Crimethinc collective,\nprobably the most inspiring young anarchist propagandists operating in the\nSituationist tradition today:\n\nWe must make our freedom by cutting holes in the fabric of this reality, by\nforging new realities which will, in turn, fashion us. Putting yourself in new\nsituations constantly is the only way to ensure that you make your decisions\nunencumbered by the inertia of habit, custom, law, or prejudice—and it is up\nto you to create these situations\n\nFreedom only exists in the moment of revolution. And those moments are not as\nrare as you think. Change, revolutionary change, is going on constantly and\neverywhere—and everyone plays a part in it, consciously or not.\n\nWhat is this but an elegant statement of the logic of direct action: the\ndefiant insistence on acting as if one is already\nfree?[76](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn76) The obvious question is how this\napproach can contribute to an overall strategy—one that should lead, perhaps\nnot to a single moment of revolutionary redemption, but to a cumulative\nmovement towards a world without states and capitalism. On this point, no one\nis completely sure. Most assume the process could only be one of endless\nimprovisation. Insurrectionary moments there will surely be. Likely as not,\nquite a few of them. But they will most likely be one element in a far more\ncomplex and multifaceted revolutionary process whose outlines could hardly, at\nthis point, be fully anticipated.\n\nIn retrospect, what seems strikingly naïve is the old assumption that a single\nuprising or successful civil war could, as it were, neutralize the entire\napparatus of structural violence, at least within a particular national\nterritory—that within that territory, right-wing realities could be simply\nswept away, to leave the field open for an untrammeled outpouring of\nrevolutionary creativity. But the truly puzzling thing is that, at certain\nmoments of human history, that appeared to be exactly what was happening. It\nseems to me that if we are to have any chance of grasping the new, emerging\nconception of revolution, we need to begin by thinking again about the quality\nof these insurrectionary moments.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about such insurrectionary upheavals is how\nthey can seem to burst out of nowhere—and then, often, dissolve away just as\nquickly. How is it that the same “public” that two months before say, the\nParis Commune, or the Spanish Civil War, had voted in a fairly moderate social\ndemocratic regime will suddenly find itself willing to risk their lives for\nthe same ultra-radicals who received a fraction of the actual vote? Or, to\nreturn to May ’68, how is it that the same public that seemed to support or at\nleast feel strongly sympathetic toward the student/worker uprising could\nalmost immediately afterwards return to the polls and elect a right-wing\ngovernment? The most common historical explanations—that the revolutionaries\ndidn’t really represent the public or its interests, but that elements of the\npublic perhaps became caught up in some sort of irrational effervescence—seem\nobviously inadequate. First of all, they assume that “the public” is an entity\nwith opinions, interests, and allegiances that can be treated as relatively\nconsistent over time. In fact what we call “the public” is created, produced\nthrough specific institutions that allow specific forms of action—taking\npolls, watching television, voting, signing petitions or writing letters to\nelected officials or attending public hearings—and not others. These frames of\naction imply certain ways of talking, thinking, arguing, deliberating. The\nsame “public” that may widely indulge in the use of recreational chemicals may\nalso consistently vote to make such indulgences illegal; the same collection\nof citizens is likely to come to completely different decisions on questions\naffecting their communities if organized into a parliamentary system, a system\nof computerized plebiscites, or a nested series of public assemblies. In fact\nthe entire anarchist project of reinventing direct democracy is premised on\nassuming this is the case.\n\nTo illustrate what I mean, consider that in English-speaking nations, the same\ncollection of people referred to in one context as “the public” can in another\nbe referred to as “the workforce.” They become a “workforce,” of course, when\nthey are engaged in different sorts of activity. The “public” does not work—a\nsentence like “most of the American public works in the service industry”\nwould never appear in a magazine or paper, and if a journalist were to attempt\nto write such a sentence, her editor would certainly change it to something\nelse. It is especially odd since the public _does_ apparently have to go to\nwork: this is why, as leftist critics often complain, the media will always\ntalk about how, say, a transport strike is likely to inconvenience the public,\nin their capacity of commuters, but it will never occur to them that those\nstriking are themselves part of the public—or that if they succeed in raising\nwage levels, this will be a public benefit. And certainly the “public” does\nnot go out into the streets. Its role is as audience to public spectacles, and\nconsumers of public services. When buying or using goods and services\nprivately supplied, the same collection of individuals become something else\n(“consumers”), just as in other contexts of action they are relabeled a\n“nation,” “electorate,” or “population.”\n\nAll these entities are the product of bureaucracies and institutional\npractices that, in turn, define certain horizons of possibility. Hence when\nvoting in parliamentary elections one might feel obliged to make a “realistic”\nchoice; in an insurrectionary situation, on the other hand, suddenly anything\nseems possible.\n\nWhat “the public,” “the workforce,” “the electorate,” “consumers,” and “the\npopulation” all have in common is that they are brought into being by\ninstitutionalized frames of action that are inherently bureaucratic, and\ntherefore, profoundly alienating. Voting booths, television screens, office\ncubicles, hospitals, the ritual that surrounds them—one might say these are\nthe very machinery of alienation. They are the instruments through which the\nhuman imagination is smashed and shattered. Insurrectionary moments are\nmoments when this bureaucratic apparatus is neutralized. Doing so always seems\nto have the effect of throwing horizons of possibility wide open, which is\nonly to be expected if one of the main things that that apparatus normally\ndoes is to enforce extremely limited horizons. (This is probably why, as\nRebecca Solnit has so beautifully\nobserved,[77](part0009_split_001.html#c01-ftn77) people often experience\nsomething very similar during natural disasters.) All of this would explain\nwhy revolutionary moments always seem to be followed by an outpouring of\nsocial, artistic, and intellectual creativity. Normally unequal structures of\nimaginative identification are disrupted; everyone is experimenting with\ntrying to see the world from unfamiliar points of view; everyone feels not\nonly the right, but usually the immediate practical need to re-create and\nreimagine everything around them.\n\nThe question, of course, is how to ensure that those who go through this\nexperience are not immediately reorganized under some new rubric—the people,\nthe proletariat, the multitude, the nation, the ummah, whatever it may be—that\nthen gives way to the construction of a new set of rules, regulations, and\nbureaucratic institutions around it, which will inevitably come to be enforced\nby new categories of police. I actually think that here, some progress has\nbeen made. A lot of the credit goes to feminism. Since at least the seventies,\nthere has been a self-conscious effort among those seeking radical change to\nshift the emphasis away from millenarian dreams and onto much more immediate\nquestions about how those “holes cut in the fabric of reality” might actually\nbe organized in a non-bureaucratic fashion, so that at least some of that\nimaginative power can be sustained over the long term. This was already true\nof the great Festivals of Resistance organized around trade summits by the\nGlobal Justice movement from 1998 to 2003, where the intricate details of the\nprocess of democratic planning for the actions was, if anything, more\nimportant than the actions themselves, but it became even more true in 2011\nwith the camps of the Arab Spring, the great assemblies of Greece and Spain,\nand finally, the Occupy movement in the United States. These were\nsimultaneously direct actions, practical demonstrations of how real democracy\ncould be thrown in the face of power, and experiments in what a genuinely non-\nbureaucratized social order, based on the power of practical imagination,\nmight look like.\n\nSuch is the lesson, I think, for politics. If one resists the reality effect\ncreated by pervasive structural violence—the way that bureaucratic regulations\nseem to disappear into the very mass and solidity of the large heavy objects\naround us, the buildings, vehicles, large concrete structures, making a world\nregulated by such principles seem natural and inevitable, and anything else a\ndreamy fantasy—it _is_ possible to give power to the imagination. But it also\nrequires an enormous amount of work.\n\nPower makes you lazy. Insofar as our earlier theoretical discussion of\nstructural violence revealed anything, it was this: that while those in\nsituations of power and privilege often feel it as a terrible burden of\nresponsibility, in most ways, most of the time, power is all about what you\n_don’t_ have to worry about, _don’t_ have to know about, and _don’t_ have to\ndo. Bureaucracies can democratize this sort of power, at least to an extent,\nbut they can’t get rid of it. It becomes forms of institutionalized laziness.\nRevolutionary change may involve the exhilaration of throwing off imaginative\nshackles, of suddenly realizing that impossible things are not impossible at\nall, but it also means most people will have to get over some of this deeply\nhabituated laziness and start engaging in interpretive (imaginative) labor for\na very long time to make those realities stick.\n\nI have spent much of the last two decades thinking about how social theory\nmight contribute to this process. As I’ve emphasized, social theory itself\ncould be seen as kind of radical simplification, a form of calculated\nignorance, a way of putting on a set of blinkers designed to reveal patterns\none could never otherwise be able to see.\n\nWhat I’ve been trying to do, then, is to put on one set of blinkers that\nallows us to see another. That’s why I began the essay as I did, with the\npaperwork surrounding my mother’s illness and death. I wanted to bring social\ntheory to bear on those places that seem most hostile to it. There are dead\nzones that riddle our lives, areas so devoid of any possibility of\ninterpretive depth that they repel every attempt to give them value or\nmeaning. These are spaces, as I discovered, where interpretive labor no longer\nworks. It’s hardly surprising that we don’t like to talk about them. They\nrepel the imagination. But I also believe we have a responsibility to confront\nthem, because if we don’t, we risk becoming complicit in the very violence\nthat creates them.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by this. The tendency in existing social theory is\nto romanticize violence: to treat violent acts above all as ways to send\ndramatic messages, to play with symbols of absolute power, purification, and\nterror. Now, I’m not saying this is exactly untrue. Most acts of violence are\nalso, in this sort of very literal sense, acts of terrorism. But I would also\ninsist that focusing on these most dramatic aspects of violence makes it easy\nto ignore the fact that one of the salient features of violence, and of\nsituations it creates, is that it is very boring. In American prisons, which\nare extraordinary violent places, the most vicious form of punishment is\nsimply to lock a person in an empty room for years with absolutely nothing to\ndo. This emptying of any possibility of communication or meaning is the real\nessence of what violence really is and does. Yes, sending someone into\nsolitary is a way of sending a message to them, and to other prisoners. But\nthe act consists largely of stifling out the possibility of sending any\nfurther messages of any kind.\n\nIt is one thing to say that, when a master whips a slave, he is engaging in a\nform of meaningful, communicative action, conveying the need for unquestioning\nobedience, and at the same time trying to create a terrifying mythic image of\nabsolute and arbitrary power. All of this is true. It is quite another to\ninsist that that is all that is happening, or all that we need to talk about.\nAfter all, if we do not go on to explore what “unquestioning” actually\nmeans—the master’s ability to remain completely unaware of the slave’s\nunderstanding of any situation, the slave’s inability to say anything even\nwhen she becomes aware of some dire practical flaw in the master’s reasoning,\nthe forms of blindness or stupidity that result, the fact these oblige the\nslave to devote even more energy trying to understand and anticipate the\nmaster’s confused perceptions—are we not, in however small a way, doing the\nsame work as the whip? It’s not really about making its victims talk.\nUltimately, it’s about participating in the process that shuts them up.\n\nThere is another reason I began with that story about my mother and the\nnotary. As my apparently inexplicable confusion over the signatures makes\nclear, such dead zones can, temporarily at least, render _anybody_ stupid.\nJust as, the first time I constructed this argument, I was actually unaware\nthat most of these ideas had already been developed within feminist standpoint\ntheory. That theory itself had been so marginalized I was only vaguely aware\nof it. These territories present us with a kind of bureaucratic maze of\nblindness, ignorance, and absurdity, and it is perfectly understandable that\ndecent people seek to avoid them—in fact, that the most effective strategy of\npolitical liberation yet discovered lies precisely in avoiding them—but at the\nsame time, it is only at our peril that we simply pretend that they’re not\nthere.\n\n\n# **2**\n\n# **Of Flying Cars and the Declining Rate of Profit**\n\n“Contemporary reality is the beta-version of a science fiction dream.”\n\n—Richard Barbrook\n\nThere is a secret shame hovering over all us in the twenty-first century. No\none seems to want to acknowledge it.\n\nFor those in what should be the high point of their lives, in their forties\nand fifties, it is particularly acute, but in a broader sense it affects\neveryone. The feeling is rooted in a profound sense of disappointment about\nthe nature of the world we live in, a sense of a broken promise—of a solemn\npromise we felt we were given as children about what our adult world was\nsupposed to be like. I am referring here not to the standard false promises\nthat children are always given (about how the world is fair, authorities are\nwell-meaning, or those who work hard shall be rewarded), but about a very\nspecific generational promise—given above all to those who were children in\nthe fifties, sixties, seventies, or even eighties—one that was never quite\narticulated as a promise but rather as a set of assumptions about what our\nadult world would be like. And since it was never quite promised, now that it\nhas spectacularly failed to come true, we’re left confused; indignant, but at\nthe same time, embarrassed at our own indignation, ashamed we were ever so\nsilly to believe our elders to begin with.\n\nI am referring, of course, to the conspicuous absence, in 2015, of flying\ncars.\n\nWell, all right, not just flying cars. I don’t really care about flying\ncars—especially because I don’t even drive. What I have in mind are all the\ntechnological wonders that any child growing up in the mid-to-late twentieth\ncentury simply assumed would exist by 2015. We all know the list: Force\nfields. Teleportation. Antigravity fields. Tricorders. Tractor beams.\nImmortality drugs. Suspended animation. Androids. Colonies on Mars. What\nhappened to them? Every now and then it’s widely trumpeted that one is about\nto materialize—clones, for instance, or cryogenics, or anti-aging medications,\nor invisibility cloaks—but when these don’t prove to be false promises, which\nthey usually are, they emerge hopelessly flawed. Point any of this out, and\nthe usual response is a ritual invocation of the wonders of computers—why\nwould you want an antigravity sled when you can have second life?—as if this\nis some sort of unanticipated compensation. But, even here, we’re not nearly\nwhere people in the fifties imagined we’d have been by now. We still don’t\nhave computers you can have an interesting conversation with, or robots that\ncan walk the dog or fold your laundry.\n\nSpeaking as someone who was eight years old at the time of the Apollo moon\nlanding, I have very clear memories of calculating that I would be thirty-nine\nyears of age in the magic year 2000, and wondering what the world around me\nwould be like. Did I honestly expect I would be living in a world of such\nwonders? Of course. Everyone did. And so do I feel cheated now? Absolutely.\nCertainly, I didn’t think I’d see _all_ the things we read about in science\nfiction realized in my lifetime (even assuming my lifetime was not extended by\ncenturies by some newly discovered longevity drug). If you asked me at the\ntime, I’d have guessed about half. But it never occurred to me that I wouldn’t\nsee _any_ of them.\n\nI have long been puzzled and fascinated by the near silence surrounding this\nissue in public discourse. One does occasionally see griping about flying cars\non the Internet, but it’s muted, or very marginal. For the most part, the\ntopic is treated almost as taboo. At the turn of the millennium, for instance,\nI was expecting an outpouring of reflections by forty-somethings in the\npopular media on what we had expected the world of 2000 to be like, and why we\nhad all gotten it so wrong. I couldn’t find a single one. Instead, just about\nall the authoritative voices—both Left and Right—began their reflections from\nthe assumption that a world of technological wonders had, in fact, arrived.\n\nTo a very large extent, the silence is due to fear of being ridiculed as\nfoolishly naïve. Certainly if one does raise the issue, one is likely to hear\nresponses like “Oh, you mean all that Jetson stuff?” As if to say, but that\nwas just for children! Surely, as grown-ups, we’re supposed to understand that\nthe Jetsons future was about as realistic as the Flintstones past. But of\ncourse it wasn’t just the Jetsons. All serious science shows designed for\nchildren in the fifties, sixties, seventies, and even the eighties—the\n_Scientific Americans_ , the educational TV programs, the planetarium shows in\nnational museums—all the authoritative voices who told us what the universe\nwas like and why the sky was blue, who explained the periodic table of\nelements, also assured us that the future was indeed going to involve colonies\non other planets, robots, matter transformation devices, and a world much\ncloser to _Star Trek_ than to our own.\n\nThe fact that all these voices turned out to be wrong doesn’t just create a\ndeep feeling of largely inexpressible betrayal; it also points to some\nconceptual problems about how we should even talk about history, now that\nthings haven’t unfolded as we thought they would. There are contexts where we\nreally can’t just wave our hands and make the discrepancy between expectations\nand reality go away. One obvious one is science fiction. Back in the twentieth\ncentury, creators of science fiction movies used to come up with concrete\ndates in which to place their futuristic fantasies. Often these were no more\nthan a generation in the future. Thus in 1968, Stanley Kubrick felt that a\nmoviegoing audience would find it perfectly natural to assume that only\nthirty-three years later, in 2001, we would have commercial moon flights,\ncity-like space stations, and computers with humanlike personalities\nmaintaining astronauts in suspended animation while traveling to\nJupiter.[78](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn78) In fact about the only new\ntechnology from _2001_ that actually did appear were video telephones, but\nthose were already technically possible in 1968—at the time, they were simply\nunmarketable because no one really wanted to have\none.[79](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn79) Similar problems crop up whenever\na particular writer, or program, tries to create a grand mythos. According to\nthe universe created by Larry Niven, which I got to know as a teenager, humans\nin this decade (2010s) are living under a one-world U.N. government and\ncreating their first colony on the moon, while dealing with the social\nconsequences of medical advances that have created a class of immortal rich\npeople. In the _Star Trek_ mythos developed around the same time, in contrast,\nhumans would now be recovering from fighting off the rule of genetically\nengineered supermen in the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s—a war which ended when\nwe shot them all in suspension pods into outer space. _Star Trek_ writers in\nthe 1990s were thus forced to start playing around with alternate time lines\nand realities just as a way of keeping the whole premise from falling apart.\n\nBy 1989, when the creators of _Back to the Future II_ dutifully placed flying\ncars and antigravity hoverboards in the hands of ordinary teenagers in the\nyear 2015, it wasn’t clear if it was meant as a serious prediction, a bow to\nolder traditions of imagined futures, or as a slightly bitter joke. At any\nrate, it marked one of the last instances of this sort of thing. Later science\nfiction futures were largely dystopian, moving from bleak technofascism into\nsome kind of stone-age barbarism, as in _Cloud Atlas_ , or else, studiously\nambiguous: the writers remaining coy about the dates, which renders “the\nfuture” a zone of pure fantasy, no different really than Middle Earth or\nCimmeria. They might even, as with _Star Wars_ , place the future in the past,\n“a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.” This Future is, most often, not\nreally a future at all, but more like an alternative dimension, a dream-time,\nsome kind of technological Elsewhere, existing in days to come in the same\nsense that elves and dragon-slayers existed in the past; just another screen\nfor the projection of moral dramas and mythic fantasies. Science fiction has\nnow become just another set of costumes in which one can dress up a Western, a\nwar movie, a horror flick, a spy thriller, or just a fairy tale.\n\nI think it would be wrong, however, to say that our culture has completely\nsidestepped the issue of technological disappointment. Embarrassment over this\nissue has ensured that we’ve been reluctant to engage with it explicitly.\nInstead, like so many other cultural traumas, pain has been displaced; we can\nonly talk about it when we think we’re talking about something else.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems to me that entire fin de siècle cultural sensibility\nthat came to be referred to as “postmodernism” might best be seen as just such\na prolonged meditation on technological changes that never happened. The\nthought first struck me when watching one of the new _Star Wars_ movies. The\nmovie was awful. But I couldn’t help but be impressed by the quality of the\nspecial effects. Recalling all those clumsy effects typical of fifties sci-fi\nfilms, the tin spaceships being pulled along by almost-invisible strings, I\nkept thinking about how impressed a 1950s audience would have been if they’d\nknown what we could do by now—only to immediately realize, “actually, no. They\nwouldn’t be impressed at all, would they? They thought that we’d actually be\n_doing_ this kind of thing by now. Not just figuring out more sophisticated\nways to simulate it.”\n\nThat last word, “simulate,” is key. What technological progress we have seen\nsince the seventies has largely been in information technologies—that is,\ntechnologies of simulation. They are technologies of what Jean Baudrillard and\nUmberto Eco used to call the “hyper-real”—the ability to make imitations more\nrealistic than the original. The entire postmodern sensibility, the feeling\nthat we had somehow broken into an unprecedented new historical period where\nwe understood that there was nothing new; that grand historical narratives of\nprogress and liberation were meaningless; that everything now was simulation,\nironic repetition, fragmentation and pastiche: all this only makes sense in a\ntechnological environment where the only major breakthroughs were ones making\nit easier to create, transfer, and rearrange virtual projections of things\nthat either already existed, or, we now came to realize, never really would.\nSurely, if we were really taking our vacations in geodesic domes on Mars, or\ntoting about pocket-sized nuclear fusion plants or telekinetic mind-reading\ndevices, no one would ever have been talking like this. The “postmodern”\nmoment was simply a desperate way to take what could only otherwise be felt as\na bitter disappointment, and dress it up as something epochal, exciting and\nnew.\n\nIt’s worthy of note that in the earliest formulations of postmodernism, which\nlargely came out of the Marxist tradition, a lot of this technological subtext\nwas not even subtext; it was quite explicit. Here’s a passage from Frederick\nJameson’s original _Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism_ ,\nin 1984:\n\nIt is appropriate to recall the excitement of machinery in the moment of\ncapital preceding our own, the exhilaration of futurism, most notably, and of\nMarinetti’s celebration of the machine gun and the motorcar. These are still\nvisible emblems, sculptural nodes of energy which give tangibility and\nfiguration to the motive energies of that earlier moment of modernization …\nthe ways in which revolutionary or communist artists of the 1930s also sought\nto reappropriate this excitement of machine energy for a Promethean\nreconstruction of human society as a whole …\n\nIt is immediately obvious that the technology of our own moment no longer\npossesses this same capacity for representation: not the turbine, nor even\nSheeler’s grain elevators or smokestacks, not the baroque elaboration of pipes\nand conveyor belts, nor even the streamlined profile of the railroad train—all\nvehicles of speed still concentrated at rest—but rather the computer, whose\nouter shell has no emblematic or visual power, or even the casings of the\nvarious media themselves, as with that home appliance called television which\narticulates nothing but rather implodes, carrying its flattened image surface\nwithin itself.[80](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn80)\n\nWhere once the sheer physical power of technologies themselves gave us a sense\nof history sweeping forward, we are now reduced to a play of screens and\nimages.\n\nJameson originally proposed the term “postmodernism” to refer to the cultural\nlogic appropriate to a new phase of capitalism, one that Ernest Mandel had, as\nearly as 1972, dubbed a “third technological revolution.” Humanity, Mandel\nargued, stood on the brink of a transformation as profound as the agricultural\nor industrial revolutions had been: one in which computers, robots, new energy\nsources, and new information technologies would, effectively, replace old-\nfashioned industrial labor—the “end of work” as it soon came to be\ncalled—reducing us all to designers and computer technicians coming up with\nthe crazy visions that cybernetic factories would actually\nproduce.[81](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn81) End of work arguments became\nincreasingly popular in the late seventies and early eighties, as radical\nthinkers pondered what would happen to traditional working-class struggle once\nthere was no longer a working class. (The answer: it would turn into identity\npolitics.)\n\nJameson thought of himself as exploring the forms of consciousness and\nhistorical sensibilities likely to emerge from this emerging new age. Of\ncourse, as we all know, these technological breakthroughs did not, actually,\nhappen. What happened instead is that the spread of information technologies\nand new ways of organizing transport—the containerization of shipping, for\nexample—allowed those same industrial jobs to be outsourced to East Asia,\nLatin America, and other countries where the availability of cheap labor\ngenerally allowed manufacturers to employ much less technologically\nsophisticated production-line techniques than they would have been obliged to\nemploy at home. True, from the perspective of those living in Europe and North\nAmerica, or even Japan, the results did seem superficially to be much as\npredicted. Smokestack industries did increasingly disappear; jobs came to be\ndivided between a lower stratum of service workers and an upper stratum\nsitting in antiseptic bubbles playing with computers. But below it all lay an\nuneasy awareness that this whole new post-work civilization was, basically, a\nfraud. Our carefully engineered high-tech sneakers were not really being\nproduced by intelligent cyborgs or self-replicating molecular nanotechnology;\nthey were being made on the equivalent of old-fashioned Singer sewing\nmachines, by the daughters of Mexican and Indonesian farmers who had, as the\nresult of WTO or NAFTA-sponsored trade deals, been ousted from their ancestral\nlands. It was this guilty awareness, it seems to me, that ultimately lay\nbehind the postmodern sensibility, its celebration of the endless play of\nimages and surfaces, and its insistence that ultimately, all those modernist\nnarratives that were supposed to give those images depth and reality had been\nproved to be a lie.\n\nSo: Why did the projected explosion of technological growth everyone was\nexpecting—the moon bases, the robot factories—fail to materialize? Logically,\nthere are only two possibilities. Either our expectations about the pace of\ntechnological change were unrealistic, in which case, we need to ask ourselves\nwhy so many otherwise intelligent people felt they were not. Or our\nexpectations were not inherently unrealistic, in which case, we need to ask\nwhat happened to throw the path of technological development off course.\n\nWhen cultural analysts nowadays do consider the question—which they rarely\ndo—they invariably choose the first option. One common approach is to trace\nthe problem back to illusions created by the Cold War space race. Why, many\nhave asked, did both the United States and the Soviet Union become so obsessed\nwith the idea of manned space travel in the fifties, sixties, and seventies?\nIt was never an efficient way to engage in scientific research. Was it not the\nfact that both the Americans and Russians had been, in the century before,\nsocieties of pioneers, the one expanding across the Western frontier, the\nother, across Siberia? Was it not the same shared commitment to the myth of a\nlimitless, expansive future, of human colonization of vast empty spaces, that\nhelped convince the leaders of both superpowers they had entered into a new\n“space age” in which they were ultimately battling over control over the\nfuture itself? And did not that battle ultimate produce, on both sides,\ncompletely unrealistic conceptions of what that future would actually be\nlike?[82](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn82)\n\nObviously there is truth in this. There were powerful myths at play. But most\ngreat human projects are rooted in some kind of mythic vision—this, in itself,\nproves nothing, one way or the other, about the feasibility of the project\nitself. In this essay, I want to explore the second possibility. It seems to\nme there are good reasons to believe that at least some of those visions were\nnot inherently unrealistic—and that at least some of these science fiction\nfantasies (at this point we can’t know which ones) could indeed have been\nbrought into being. The most obvious reason is because in the past, they\nregularly had been. After all, if someone growing up at the turn of the\ncentury reading Jules Verne or H. G. Wells tried to imagine what the world\nwould be like in, say, 1960, they imagined a world of flying machines, rocket\nships, submarines, new forms of energy, and wireless communication … and that\nwas pretty much exactly what they got. If it wasn’t unrealistic in 1900 to\ndream of men traveling to the moon, why was it unrealistic in the sixties to\ndream of jet-packs and robot laundry-maids? If from 1750 to 1950 new power\nsources emerged regularly (steam, electric, petroleum, nuclear …) was it that\nunreasonable to imagine we’d have seen at least one new one since?\n\nThere is reason to believe that even by the fifties and sixties, the real pace\nof technological innovation was beginning to slow from the heady pace of the\nfirst half of the century. There was something of a last spate of inventions\nin the fifties when microwave ovens (1954), the pill (1957), and lasers (1958)\nall appeared in rapid succession. But since then, most apparent technological\nadvances have largely taken the form of either clever new ways of combining\nexisting technologies (as in the space race), or new ways to put existing\ntechnologies to consumer use (the most famous example here is television,\ninvented in 1926, but only mass-produced in the late forties and early\nfifties, in a self-conscious effort to create new consumer demand to ensure\nthe American economy didn’t slip back into depression). Yet the space race\nhelped convey the notion that this was an age of remarkable advances, and the\npredominant popular impression during the sixties was that the pace of\ntechnological change was speeding up in terrifying, uncontrollable ways. Alvin\nToffler’s 1970 breakaway bestseller _Future Shock_ can be seen as a kind of\nhigh-water mark of this line of thought. In retrospect, it’s a fascinating and\nrevealing book.[83](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn83)\n\nToffler argued that almost all of the social problems of the 1960s could be\ntraced back to the increasing pace of technological change. As an endless\noutpouring of new scientific breakthroughs continually transformed the very\ngrounds of our daily existence, he wrote, Americans were left rudderless,\nwithout any clear idea of what normal life was supposed to be like. Perhaps it\nwas most obvious in the case of the family, where, he claimed, not just the\npill, but also the prospect of in vitro fertilization, test tube babies, and\nsperm and egg donation were about to make the very idea of motherhood\nobsolete. Toffler saw similar things happening in every domain of social\nlife—nothing could be taken for granted. And humans were not psychologically\nprepared for the pace of change. He coined a term for the phenomenon:\n“accelerative thrust.” This quickening of the pace of technological advance\nhad begun, perhaps, with the industrial revolution, but by roughly 1850, he\nargued, the effect had become unmistakable. Not only was everything around us\nchanging, most of it—the sheer mass of human knowledge, the size of the\npopulation, industrial growth, the amount of energy being consumed—was\nchanging at an exponential rate. Toffler insisted that the only solution was\nto begin to create some kind of democratic control over the\nprocess—institutions that could assess emerging technologies and the effects\nthey were likely to have, ban those technologies likely to be too socially\ndisruptive, and guide development in directions that would foster social\nharmony.\n\nThe fascinating thing is that while many of the historical trends Toffler\ndescribes are accurate, the book itself appeared at almost precisely the\nmoment when most of them came to an end. For instance, it was right around\n1970 when the increase in the number of scientific papers published in the\nworld—a figure that had been doubling every fifteen years since roughly\n1685—began leveling off. The same is true of the number of books and patents.\nIn other areas, growth did not just slow down—it stopped entirely. Toffler’s\nchoice of the word “acceleration” turns out to have been particularly\nunfortunate. For most of human history, the top speed at which human beings\ncould travel had lingered around twenty-five miles per hour. By 1900 it had\nincreased to perhaps 100 mph, and for the next seventy years it did indeed\nseem to be increasing exponentially. By the time Toffler was writing, in 1970,\nthe record for the fastest speed at which any human had traveled stood at\n24,791 mph, achieved by the crew of Apollo 10 while reentering the earth’s\natmosphere in 1969, just a year before. At such an exponential rate, it must\nhave seemed reasonable to assume that within a matter of decades, humanity\nwould be exploring other solar systems. Yet no further increase has occurred\nsince 1970. The record for the fastest a human has ever traveled remains with\nthe crew of Apollo 10. True, the maximum speed of commercial air flight did\npeak one year later, at 14,000 mph, with the launching of the Concorde in\n1971. But airline speed has not only failed to increase since—it has actually\ndecreased since the Concorde’s abandonment in\n2003.[84](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn84)\n\n![](../images/00011.jpeg)[85](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn85)\n\nThe fact that Toffler turned out to be wrong about almost everything had no\ndeleterious effects on his own career. Charismatic prophets rarely suffer much\nwhen their prophecies fail to materialize. Toffler just kept retooling his\nanalysis and coming up with new spectacular pronouncements every decade or so,\nalways to great public recognition and applause. In 1980 he produced a book\ncalled _The Third Wave_ ,[86](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn86) its argument\nlifted directly from Ernest Mandel’s “third technological revolution”—except\nthat while Mandel argued these changes would spell the eventual end of\ncapitalism, Toffler simply assumed that capitalism would be around forever. By\n1990, he had become the personal intellectual guru of Republican congressman\nNewt Gingrich, who claimed that his own 1994 “Contract with America” was\ninspired, in part, by the understanding that the United States needed to move\nfrom an antiquated, materialist, industrial mindset to a new, free-market,\ninformation-age, Third Wave civilization.\n\nThere are all sorts of ironies here. Probably one of the greatest real-world\nachievements of _Future Shock_ had been to inspire the government to create an\nOffice of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1972, more or less in line with\nToffler’s call for some sort of democratic oversight over potentially\ndisruptive technologies. One of Gingrich’s first acts on winning control of\nCongress in 1995 was to defund the OTA as an example of useless government\nwaste. Again, none of this seemed to faze Toffler at all. By that time, he had\nlong since given up trying to influence policy by appealing to the general\npublic, or even really trying to influence political debate; he was, instead,\nmaking a living largely by giving seminars to CEOs and the denizens of\ncorporate think tanks. His insights had, effectively, been privatized.\n\nGingrich liked to call himself a “conservative futurologist.” This might seem\noxymoronic; but actually, if you look back at Toffler’s work in retrospect,\nthe guru’s politics line up precisely with his student’s, and it’s rather\nsurprising anyone ever took him for anything else. The argument of _Future\nShock_ is the very definition of conservatism. Progress was always presented\nas a problem that needed to be solved. True, his solution was ostensibly to\ncreate forms of democratic control, but in effect, “democratic” obviously\nmeant “bureaucratic,” the creation of panels of experts to determine which\ninventions would be approved, and which put on the shelf. In this way, Toffler\nmight best be seen as a latter day, intellectually lightweight version of the\nearly nineteenth-century social theorist Auguste Comte. Comte, too, felt that\nhe was standing on the brink of a new age—in his case, the industrial\nage—driven by the inexorable progress of technology, and that the social\ncataclysms of his times were really caused by the social system not having\nmanaged to adjust. The older, feudal order, had developed not only Catholic\ntheology, a way of thinking about man’s place in the cosmos perfectly suited\nto the social system of the time, but an institutional structure, the Church,\nthat conveyed and enforced such ideas in a way that could give everyone a\nsense of meaning and belonging. The current, industrial age had developed its\nown system of ideas—science—but scientists had not succeeded in creating\nanything like the Catholic Church. Comte concluded that we needed to develop a\nnew science, which he dubbed “sociology,” and that sociologists should play\nthe role of priests in a new Religion of Society that would inspire the masses\nwith a love of order, community, work-discipline, and patriarchal family\nvalues. Toffler was less ambitious: his futurologists were not supposed to\nactually play the role of priests. But he shared the same feeling that\ntechnology was leading humans to the brink of a great historical break, the\nsame fear of social breakdown, and, for that matter, the same obsession with\nthe need to preserve the sacred role of motherhood—Comte wanted to put the\nimage of a pregnant woman on the flag of his religious movement.\n\nGingrich did have another guru who was overtly religious: George Gilder, a\nlibertarian theologian, and author, among other things, of a newsletter called\nthe “Gilder Technology Report.” Gilder was also obsessed with the relation of\ntechnology and social change, but in an odd way, he was far more optimistic.\nEmbracing an even more radical version of Mandel’s Third Wave argument, he\ninsisted that what we were seeing since the 1970s with the rise of computers\nwas a veritable “overthrow of matter.” The old, materialist, industrial\nsociety, where value came from physical labor, was giving way to an\ninformation age where value emerged directly from the minds of entrepreneurs,\njust as the world had originally appeared ex nihilo from the mind of God, just\nas money, in a proper supply-side economy, emerged ex nihilo from the Federal\nReserve and into the hands of creative, value-creating, capitalists. Supply-\nside economic policies, he concluded, would ensure that investment would\ncontinue to steer away from old government boondoggles like the space program,\nand towards more productive information and medical technologies.\n\nGilder, who had begun his career declaring that he aspired to be “America’s\npremier antifeminist,” also insisted that such salutary developments could\nonly be maintained by strict enforcement of traditional family values. He did\nnot propose a new religion of society. He didn’t feel he had to, since the\nsame work could be done by the Christian evangelical movement that was already\nforging its strange alliance with the libertarian\nright.[87](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn87)\n\nOne would be unwise, perhaps, to dwell too much on such eccentric characters,\nhowever influential. For one thing, they came very late in the day. If there\nwas a conscious, or semiconscious, move away from investment in research that\nmight have led to better rockets and robots, and towards research that would\nlead to such things as laser printers and CAT scans, it had already begun\nbefore the appearance of Toffler’s _Future Shock_ (1971), let alone Gilder’s\n_Wealth and Poverty_ (1981).[88](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn88) What their\nsuccess does show is that the issues these men raised—the concern that\nexisting patterns of technological development would lead to social upheaval,\nthe need to guide technological development in directions that did not\nchallenge existing structures of authority—found a receptive ear in the very\nhighest corridors of power. There is every reason to believe that statesmen\nand captains of industry were indeed thinking about such questions, and had\nbeen for some time.[89](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn89)\n\nSo what happened? Over the course of the rest of this essay, which is divided\ninto three parts, I am going to consider a number of factors that I think\ncontributed to ensuring the technological futures we all anticipated never\nhappened. These fall into two broad groups. One is broadly political, having\nto do with conscious shifts in the allocation of research funding; the other\nbureaucratic, a change in the nature of the systems administering scientific\nand technological research.\n\n\n## **Thesis**\n\n_There appears to have been a profound shift, beginning in the 1970s, from\ninvestment in technologies associated with the possibility of alternative\nfutures to investment technologies that furthered labor discipline and social\ncontrol_\n\n“The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the\ninstruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with\nthem the whole relations of society … All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with\ntheir train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away,\nall new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is\nsolid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last\ncompelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his\nrelations with his kind.”\n\n—Marx and Engels, _Manifesto of the Communist Party_ (1847)  \n  \n\n“I said that fun was very important, too, that it was a direct rebuttal of the\nkind of ethics and morals that were being put forth in the country to keep\npeople working in a rat race which didn’t make any sense because in a few\nyears the machines would do all the work anyway, that there was a whole system\nof values that people were taught to postpone their pleasure, to put all their\nmoney in the bank, to buy life insurance, a whole bunch of things that didn’t\nmake any sense to our generation at all.”\n\n—Abbie Hoffman, from the trial of the Chicago Seven (1970)\n\nSince its inception in the eighteenth century, the system that has come to be\nknown as “industrial capitalism” has fostered an extremely rapid rate of\nscientific advance and technological innovation—one unparalleled in previous\nhuman history. Its advocates have always held this out as the ultimate\njustification for the exploitation, misery, and destruction of communities the\nsystem also produced. Even its most famous detractors, Karl Marx and Friedrich\nEngels, were willing to celebrate capitalism—if for nothing else—for its\nmagnificent unleashing of the “productive forces.” Marx and Engels also\nbelieved that that very tendency, or, to be more precise, capitalism’s very\nneed to continually revolutionize the means of industrial production, would\neventually be its undoing.\n\nIs it possible that they were right? And is it also possible that in the\nsixties, capitalists, as a class, began to figure this out?\n\nMarx’s specific argument was that, for certain technical reasons, value, and\ntherefore profits, can only be extracted from human labor. Competition forces\nfactory owners to mechanize production, so as to reduce labor costs, but while\nthis is to the short-term advantage of the individual firm, the overall effect\nof such mechanization is actually to drive the overall rate of profit of all\nfirms down. For almost two centuries now, economists have debated whether all\nthis is really true. But if it is true, the otherwise mysterious decision by\nindustrialists not to pour research funds into the invention of the robot\nfactories that everyone was anticipating in the sixties, and instead to begin\nto relocate their factories to more labor-intensive, low-tech facilities in\nChina or the Global South, makes perfect\nsense.[90](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn90)\n\nI’ve already observed that there’s reason to believe the pace of technological\ninnovation in productive processes—the factories themselves—had already begun\nto slow down considerably in the fifties and sixties. Obviously it didn’t look\nthat way at the time. What made it appear otherwise were largely the side-\neffects of U.S. rivalry with the Soviet Union. This seems to have been true in\ntwo ways. One was a conscious policy: the Cold War saw frenetic efforts by\nU.S. industrial planners[91](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn91) to find ways\nto apply existing technologies to consumer purposes, to create an optimistic\nsense of burgeoning prosperity and guaranteed progress that, it was hoped,\nwould undercut the appeal of radical working-class politics. The famous 1959\n“kitchen debate” between Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev made the politics\nquite explicit: “your communist ‘worker’s state’ may have beat us into outer\nspace,” Nixon effectively argued, “but it’s capitalism that creates technology\nlike washing machines that actually improve the lives of the toiling masses.”\nThe other was the space race. In either case, the initiative really came from\nthe Soviet Union itself. All this is difficult for Americans to remember,\nbecause with the end of the Cold War, the popular image of the USSR switched\nso quickly from terrifying rival to pathetic basket case—the exemplar of a\nsociety that “just didn’t work.” Back in the fifties, many U.S. planners were\nlaboring under the suspicion that the Soviet system quite possibly worked much\nbetter than their own. Certainly, they keenly recalled the fact that in the\n1930s, while the United States was mired in depression, the Soviet Union was\nmaintaining almost unprecedented economic growth rates of 10 to 12 percent a\nyear—an achievement quickly followed by the production of the vast tank armies\nthat defeated Hitler, and of course, the launching of Sputnik in 1957,\nfollowed by the first manned spacecraft, the Vostok, in 1961. When Khrushchev\nassured Nixon that Soviet living standards would surpass those of the\nAmericans in seven years, many Americans feared he might actually be right.\n\nIt’s often said that the Apollo moon landing was the greatest historical\nachievement of Soviet communism. Surely, the United States would never have\ncontemplated such a feat had it not been for the cosmic ambitions of the\nSoviet Politburo. Even putting things this way is a bit startling. “Cosmic\nambitions?” We are used to thinking of the Politburo as a group of\nunimaginative grey bureaucrats, but while the Soviet Union was certainly run\nby bureaucrats, they were, from the beginning, bureaucrats who dared to dream\nastounding dreams. (The dream of world revolution was just the first.) Of\ncourse, most of their grandiose projects—changing the course of mighty rivers,\nthat sort of thing—either turned out to be ecologically and socially\ndisastrous, or, like Stalin’s projected one-hundred-story Palace of the\nSoviets, which was to be topped by a twenty-story statue of Lenin, never got\noff the ground. And after the initial successes of the Soviet space program,\nmost projects remained on the drawing board. But the Soviet leadership never\nceased coming up with new ones. Even in the eighties, when the United States\nwas attempting its own last—itself abortive—grandiose scheme, Star Wars, the\nSoviets were still planning and scheming ways to transform the world through\ncreative uses of technology. Few outside of Russia now remember most of these\nprojects, but vast resources were devoted to them. It’s also worth noting that\nunlike the Star Wars project, which was a purely military project designed to\nsink the Soviet Union, most were peaceful: as for instance, the attempt to\nsolve the world hunger problem by harvesting lakes and oceans with an edible\nbacteria called spirulina, or to solve world energy problems by a truly\nbreathtaking plan to launch hundreds of gigantic solar power platforms into\norbit and beaming the resulting electricity back to\nearth.[92](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn92)\n\nEven the golden age of science fiction, which had its heyday in the fifties\nand sixties, and which first developed that standard repertoire of future\ninventions—force fields, tractor beams, warp drives—that any contemporary\neight-year-old is familiar with (just as surely as they will know that garlic,\ncrosses, stakes, and sunlight are what’s most likely to be of help in slaying\nvampires) occurred in the United States and the USSR\nsimultaneously.[93](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn93) Or consider _Star Trek_\n, that quintessence of American mythology. Is not the Federation of\nPlanets—with its high-minded idealism, strict military discipline, and\napparent lack of both class differences and any real evidence of multiparty\ndemocracy—really just an Americanized vision of a kinder, gentler Soviet\nUnion, and above all, one that actually\n“worked”?[94](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn94)\n\nWhat I find remarkable about _Star Trek_ , in particular, is that there is not\nonly no real evidence of democracy, but that almost no one seems to notice its\nabsence. Granted, the _Star Trek_ universe has been endlessly elaborated, with\nmultiple series, movies, books and comics, even encyclopedias, not to mention\ndecades’ worth of every sort of fan fiction, so the question of the political\nconstitution of the Federation did eventually have to come up. And when it did\nthere was no real way anyone could say it was _not_ a democracy. So one or two\nlate references to the Federation as having an elected President and\nlegislature were duly thrown in. But this is meaningless. Signs of real\ndemocratic life are entirely absent in the show—no character ever makes even a\npassing reference to elections, political parties, divisive issues, opinion\npolls, slogans, plebiscites, protests, or campaigns. Does Federation\n“democracy” even operate on a party system? If so, what are the parties? What\nsort of philosophy or core constituency does each represent? In 726 episodes\nwe’re not given the slightest clue.[95](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn95)\n\nOne might object: the characters themselves are part of Star Fleet. They’re in\nthe military. True; but in real democratic societies, or even constitutional\nrepublics like the United States, soldiers and sailors regularly express\npolitical opinions about all sorts of things. You never see anyone in Star\nFleet saying, “I never should have voted for those idiots pushing the\nexpansionist policy, now look what a mess they’ve gotten into in Sector 5” or\n“when I was a student I was active in the campaign to ban terraforming of\nclass-C planets but now I’m not sure we were right.” When political problems\ndo arise, and they regularly do, those sent in to deal with them are\ninvariably bureaucrats, diplomats, and officials. _Star Trek_ characters\ncomplain about bureaucrats all the time. They never complain about\npoliticians. Because political problems are always addressed solely through\nadministrative means.[96](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn96)\n\nBut this is of course exactly what one would expect under some form of state\nsocialism. We tend to forget that such regimes, also, invariably claimed to be\ndemocracies. On paper, the USSR under Stalin boasted an exemplary\nconstitution, with far more democratic controls than European parliamentary\nsystems of the time. It was just that, much as in the Federation, none of this\nhad any bearing on how life actually worked.\n\nThe Federation, then, is Leninism brought to its full and absolute cosmic\nsuccess—a society where secret police, reeducation camps, and show trials are\nnot necessary because a happy conjuncture of material abundance and\nideological conformity ensures the system can now run entirely by itself.\n\nWhile no one seems to know or much care about the Federation’s political\ncomposition, its economic system has, from the eighties onward, been subject\nto endless curiosity and debate. _Star Trek_ characters live under a regime of\nexplicit communism. Social classes have been eliminated. So too have divisions\nbased on race, gender, or ethnic\norigin.[97](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn97) The very existence of money, in\nearlier periods, is considered a weird and somewhat amusing historical\ncuriosity. Menial labor has been automated into nonexistence. Floors clean\nthemselves. Food, clothing, tools and weapons can be whisked into existence at\nwill with a mere expenditure of energy, and even energy does not seem to be\nrationed in any significant way. All this did raise some hackles, and it would\nbe interesting to write a political history of the debate over the economics\nof the future it sparked in the late eighties and early nineties. I well\nremember watching filmmaker Michael Moore, in a debate with editors of _The\nNation_ , pointing out that _Star Trek_ showed that ordinary working-class\nAmericans were far more amenable to overt anticapitalist politics than the\nbeacons of the mainstream “progressive” left. It was around that time, too,\nthat conservatives and libertarians on the Internet also began to take notice,\nfilling newsgroups and other electronic forums with condemnations of the show\nas leftist propaganda.[98](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn98) But suddenly, we\nlearned that money had not entirely disappeared. There was latinum. Those who\ntraded in it, however, were an odious race who seemed to be almost exactly\nmodeled on Medieval Christian stereotypes of Jews, except with oversized ears\ninstead of oversized noses. (Amusingly, they were given a name, Ferengi, that\nis actually the Arabic and Hindi term for “annoying white\nperson.”)[99](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn99) On the other hand, the\nsuggestion that the Federation was promoting communism was undercut by the\nintroduction of the Borg, a hostile civilization so utterly communistic that\nindividuality had been effaced completely, sucking any sentient life form it\nassimilated into one terrifying beehive mind.\n\nBy the time of the moon landing of 1968, U.S. planners no longer took their\ncompetition seriously. The Soviets had lost the space race, and as a result,\nthe actual direction of American research and development could shift away\nfrom anything that might lead to the creation of Mars bases and robot\nfactories, let alone become the technological basis for a communist utopia.\n\nThe standard line, of course, is that this shift of priorities was simply the\nnatural result of the triumph of the market. The Apollo program was the\nquintessential Big Government project—Soviet-inspired in the sense that it\nrequired a vast national effort, coordinated by an equally vast government\nbureaucracy. As soon as the Soviet threat was safely out of the picture, this\nstory goes, capitalism was free to revert to lines of technological\ndevelopment more in accord with its normal, decentralized, free-market\nimperatives—such as privately funded research into marketable products like\ntouch-pad phones, adventurous little start-ups, and the like. This is,\ncertainly, the line that men like Toffler and Gilder began taking in the late\nseventies and early eighties. But it’s obviously wrong.\n\nFirst of all, the amount of really innovative research being done in the\nprivate sector has actually declined since the heyday of Bell Labs and similar\ncorporate research divisions in the fifties and sixties. Partly this is\nbecause of a change of tax regimes. The phone company was willing to invest so\nmuch of its profits in research because those profits were highly taxed—given\nthe choice between sinking the money into higher wages for its workers (which\nbought loyalty) and research (which made sense to a company that was still\nlocked in the old mind-set that said corporations were ultimately about making\nthings, rather than making money), and having that same money simply\nappropriated by the government, the choice was obvious. After the changes in\nthe seventies and eighties described in the introduction, all this changed.\nCorporate taxes were slashed. Executives, whose compensation now increasingly\ntook the form of stock options, began not just paying the profits to investors\nin dividends, but using money that would otherwise be directed towards raises,\nhiring, or research budgets on stock buybacks, raising the values of the\nexecutives’ portfolios but doing nothing to further productivity. In other\nwords, tax cuts and financial reforms had almost precisely the opposite effect\nas their proponents claimed they would.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. government never did abandon gigantic state-\ncontrolled schemes of technological development. It just shifted their\nemphasis sharply away from civilian projects like the space program and in the\ndirection of military research—not just Star Wars, which was Reagan’s version\nof a vast Soviet-scale project, but an endless variety of weapons projects,\nresearch in communications and surveillance technologies, and similar,\n“security-related” concerns. To some degree this had always been true: the\nbillions poured into missile research alone had always dwarfed the relatively\ninsignificant sums allocated to the space program. Yet by the 1970s, even much\nbasic research came to be conducted following essentially military priorities.\nThe most immediate reason we don’t have robot factories is that, for the last\nseveral decades, some 95 percent of robotics research funding has been\nchanneled through the Pentagon, which is of course has far more interested in\nthe kind of discoveries that might lead to the development of unmanned drones\nthan fully automated bauxite mines or robot gardeners.\n\nThese military projects did have their own civilian spin-offs: the Internet is\none. But they had the effect of guiding development in very specific\ndirections.\n\nOne might suggest an even darker possibility. A case could be made that even\nthe shift into R&D on information technologies and medicine was not so much a\nreorientation towards market-driven consumer imperatives, but part of an all-\nout effort to follow the technological humbling of the Soviet Union with total\nvictory in the global class war: not only the imposition of absolute U.S.\nmilitary dominance overseas, but the utter rout of social movements back home.\nThe technologies that emerged were in almost every case the kind that proved\nmost conducive to surveillance, work discipline, and social control. Computers\nhave opened up certain spaces of freedom, as we’re constantly reminded, but\ninstead of leading to the workless utopia Abbie Hoffman or Guy Debord\nimagined, they have been employed in such a way as to produce the opposite\neffect. Information technology has allowed a financialization of capital that\nhas driven workers ever more desperately into debt, while, at the same time,\nallowed employers to create new “flexible” work regimes that have destroyed\ntraditional job security and led to a massive increase in overall working\nhours for almost all segments of the population. Along with the export of\ntraditional factory jobs, this has put the union movement to rout and thus\ndestroyed any real possibility of effective working-class\npolitics.[100](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn100) Meanwhile, despite\nunprecedented investment in research on medicine and life sciences, we still\nawait cures for cancer or even of the common cold; instead, the most dramatic\nmedical breakthroughs we have seen have taken the form of drugs like Prozac,\nZoloft, or Ritalin—tailor-made, one might say, to ensure that these new\nprofessional demands don’t drive us completely, dysfunctionally, crazy.\n\nWhen historians write the epitaph for neoliberalism, they will have to\nconclude that it was the form of capitalism that systematically prioritized\npolitical imperatives over economic ones. That is: given a choice between a\ncourse of action that will make capitalism _seem_ like the only possible\neconomic system, and one that will make capitalism actually _be_ a more viable\nlong-term economic system, neoliberalism has meant always choosing the former.\nDoes destroying job security while increasing working hours really create a\nmore productive (let alone innovative, loyal) workforce? There is every reason\nto believe that exactly the opposite is the case. In purely economic terms the\nresult of neoliberal reform of labor markets is almost certainly negative—an\nimpression that overall lower economic growth rates in just about all parts of\nthe world in the eighties and nineties would tend to reinforce. However it has\nbeen spectacularly effective in depoliticizing labor. The same could be said\nof the burgeoning growth in armies, police, and private security services.\nThey’re utterly unproductive—nothing but a resource sink. It’s quite possible,\nin fact, that the very weight of the apparatus created to ensure the\nideological victory of capitalism will itself ultimately sink it. But it’s\nalso easy to see how, if the ultimate imperative of those running the world is\nchoking off the possibility of any sense of an inevitable, redemptive future\nthat will be fundamentally different than the world today must be a crucial\npart of the neoliberal project.\n\n\n## **Antithesis**\n\n_Yet even those areas of science and technology that did receive massive\nfunding have not seen the breakthroughs originally anticipated_\n\nAt this point, the pieces would seem to be falling neatly into place. By the\n1960s, conservative political forces had become skittish about the socially\ndisruptive effects of technological progress, which they blamed for the social\nupheavals of the era, and employers were beginning to worry about the economic\nimpact of mechanization. The fading of the Soviet threat allowed for a massive\nreallocation of resources in directions seen as less challenging to social and\neconomic arrangements—and ultimately, to ones that could support a campaign to\nsharply reverse the gains progressive social movements had made since the\nforties, thus achieving a decisive victory in what U.S. elites did indeed see\nas a global class war. The change of priorities was touted as a withdrawal of\nbig-government projects and a return to the market, but it actually involved a\nshift in the orientation of government-directed research, away from programs\nlike NASA—or, say, alternative energy sources—and toward even more intense\nfocus on military, information, and medical technologies.\n\nI think all this is true as far as it goes; but it can’t explain everything.\nAbove all, it cannot explain why even in those areas that have become the\nfocus of well-funded research projects, we have not seen anything like the\nkind of advances anticipated fifty years ago. To take only the most obvious\nexample: if 95 percent of robotics research has been funded by the military,\nwhy is there still no sign of Klaatu-style killer robots shooting death rays\nfrom their eyes? Because we _know_ they’ve been working on that.\n\nObviously, there have been advances in military technology. It’s widely\nacknowledged that one of the main reasons we all survived the Cold War is that\nwhile nuclear bombs worked more or less as advertised, the delivery systems\ndidn’t; Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles weren’t really capable of hitting\ncities, let alone specific targets inside them, which meant there was little\npoint in launching a nuclear first strike unless you were consciously\nintending to destroy the world. Contemporary cruise missiles, in contrast, are\nfairly accurate. Still, all those much-vaunted precision weapons never seem\ncapable of taking out specific individuals (Saddam, Osama, Gaddafi), even if\nhundreds are dropped. Drones are just model airplanes, driven by remote\ncontrol. And ray guns of any sort have not materialized, surely not for lack\nof trying—we have to assume the Pentagon has poured billions into coming up\nwith one, but the closest they’re come so far are lasers (a fifties\ntechnology) that might, if aimed correctly, make an enemy gunner looking\ndirectly at the beam go blind. This is not just unsporting, but rather\npathetic. Phasers that can be set to stun do not appear to even be on the\ndrawing boards; in fact, when it comes to infantry combat, the preferred\nweapon in 2011, almost everywhere, remains the AK-47, a Soviet design, named\nafter the year it was first introduced:\n1947.[101](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn101)\n\nThe same, as I’ve already noted, can be said of widely anticipated\nbreakthroughs in medicine, and even (dare I say?) computers. The Internet is\nsurely a remarkable thing. Still, if a fifties sci-fi fan were to appear in\nthe present and ask what the most dramatic technological achievement of the\nintervening sixty years had been, it’s hard to imagine the reaction would have\nbeen anything but bitter disappointment. He would almost certainly have\npointed out that all we are really talking about here is a super-fast and\nglobally accessible combination of library, post office, and mail order\ncatalog. “Fifty years and this is the best our scientists managed to come up\nwith? We were expecting computers that could actually think!”\n\nAll this is true, despite the fact that overall levels of research funding\nhave increased dramatically since the 1970s. Of course, the proportion of that\nfunding that comes from the corporate sector has increased even more\ndramatically, to the point where private enterprise is now funding twice as\nmuch research as the government. But the total increase is so large that the\noverall amount of government research funding, in real dollar terms, is still\nmuch higher than it was before. Again, while “basic,” “curiosity-driven,” or\n“blue skies” research—the kind that is not driven by the prospect of any\nimmediate practical application, and which is therefore most likely to lead to\nunexpected breakthroughs—is an ever-smaller proportion of the total, so much\nmoney is being thrown around nowadays that overall levels of basic research\nfunding has actually gone up. Yet most honest assessments have agreed that the\nresults have been surprisingly paltry. Certainly we no longer see anything\nlike the continual stream of conceptual revolutions—genetic inheritance,\nrelativity, psychoanalysis, quantum mechanics—that humanity had grown used to,\nand even to expect, a hundred years before.\n\nWhy?\n\nOne common explanation is that when funders do conduct basic research, they\ntend to put all their eggs in one gigantic basket: “Big Science,” as it has\ncome to be called. The Human Genome Project is often held out as an example.\nInitiated by the U.S. government, the project ended up spending almost three\nbillion dollars and employing thousands of scientists and staff in five\ndifferent countries, generating enormous expectations, only to discover that\nhuman gene sequences are nearly identical to those of chimpanzees, distinctly\n_less_ complicated than the gene sequences of, say, rice, and that there would\nappear to be very little to be learned from them that’s of immediate practical\napplication. Even more—and I think this is really key—the hype and political\ninvestment surrounding such projects demonstrate the degree to which even\nbasic research now seems to be driven by political, administrative, and\nmarketing imperatives (the Human Genome Project for instance had its own\ncorporate-style logo) that make it increasingly unlikely that anything\nparticularly revolutionary will result.\n\nHere, I think our collective fascination with the mythic origins of Silicon\nValley and the Internet have blinded us to what’s really going on. It has\nallowed us imagine that research and development is now driven, primarily, by\nsmall teams of plucky entrepreneurs, or the sort of decentralized cooperation\nthat creates open-source software. It isn’t. These are just the sort of\nresearch teams most likely to produce results. If anything, research has been\nmoving in the opposite direction. It is still driven by giant, bureaucratic\nprojects; what has changed is the bureaucratic culture. The increasing\ninterpenetration of government, university, and private firms has led all\nparties to adopt language, sensibilities, and organizational forms that\noriginated in the corporate world. While this might have helped somewhat in\nspeeding up the creation of immediately marketable products—as this is what\ncorporate bureaucracies are designed to do—in terms of fostering original\nresearch, the results have been catastrophic.\n\nHere I can speak from experience. My own knowledge comes largely from\nuniversities, both in the United States and the UK. In both countries, the\nlast thirty years have seen a veritable explosion of the proportion of working\nhours spent on administrative paperwork, at the expense of pretty much\neverything else. In my own university, for instance, we have not only more\nadministrative staff than faculty, but the faculty, too, are expected to spend\nat least as much time on administrative responsibilities as on teaching and\nresearch combined.[102](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn102) This is more or\nless par for the course for universities worldwide. The explosion of\npaperwork, in turn, is a direct result of the introduction of corporate\nmanagement techniques, which are always justified as ways of increasing\nefficiency, by introducing competition at every level. What these management\ntechniques invariably end up meaning in practice is that everyone winds up\nspending most of their time trying to sell each other things: grant proposals;\nbook proposals; assessments of our students’ job and grant applications;\nassessments of our colleagues; prospectuses for new interdisciplinary majors,\ninstitutes, conference workshops, and universities themselves, which have now\nbecome brands to be marketed to prospective students or contributors.\nMarketing and PR thus come to engulf every aspect of university life.\n\nThe result is a sea of documents about the fostering of “imagination” and\n“creativity,” set in an environment that might as well have been designed to\nstrangle any actual manifestations of imagination and creativity in the\ncradle. I am not a scientist. I work in social theory. But I have seen the\nresults in my own field of endeavor. No major new works of social theory have\nemerged in the United States in the last thirty years. We have, instead, been\nlargely reduced to the equivalent of Medieval scholastics, scribbling endless\nannotations on French theory from the 1970s, despite the guilty awareness that\nif contemporary incarnations of Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, or even\nPierre Bourdieu were to appear in the U.S. academy, they would be unlikely to\neven make it through grad school, and if they somehow did make it, they would\nalmost certainly be denied tenure.[103](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn103)\n\nThere was a time when academia was society’s refuge for the eccentric,\nbrilliant, and impractical. No longer. It is now the domain of professional\nself-marketers. As for the eccentric, brilliant, and impractical: it would\nseem society now has no place for them at all.\n\nIf all this is true in the social sciences, where research is still carried\nout largely by individuals, with minimal overhead, one can only imagine how\nmuch worse it is for physicists. And indeed, as one physicist has recently\nwarned students pondering a career in the sciences, even when one does emerge\nfrom the usual decade-long period languishing as someone else’s flunky, one\ncan expect one’s best ideas to be stymied at every point.\n\nYou [will] spend your time writing proposals rather than doing research.\nWorse, because your proposals are judged by your competitors you cannot follow\nyour curiosity, but must spend your effort and talents on anticipating and\ndeflecting criticism rather than on solving the important scientific problems\n… It is proverbial that original ideas are the kiss of death for a proposal;\nbecause they have not yet been proved to\nwork.[104](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn104)\n\nThat pretty much answers the question of why we don’t have teleportation\ndevices or antigravity shoes. Common sense dictates that if you want to\nmaximize scientific creativity, you find some bright people, give them the\nresources they need to pursue whatever idea comes into their heads, and then\nleave them alone for a while. Most will probably turn up nothing, but one or\ntwo may well discover something completely unexpected. If you want to minimize\nthe possibility of unexpected breakthroughs, tell those same people they will\nreceive no resources at all unless they spend the bulk of their time competing\nagainst each other to convince you they already know what they are going to\ndiscover.[105](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn105)\n\nThat’s pretty much the system we have\nnow.[106](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn106)\n\nIn the natural sciences, to the tyranny of managerialism we can also add the\ncreeping privatization of research results. As the British economist David\nHarvie has recently reminded us, “open source” research is not new. Scholarly\nresearch has always been open-source in the sense that scholars share\nmaterials and results. There is competition, certainly, but it is, as he\nnicely puts it, “convivial”:\n\nConvivial competition is where I (or my team) wish to be the first to prove a\nparticular conjecture, to explain a particular phenomenon, to discover a\nparticular species, star or particle, in the same way that if I race my bike\nagainst my friend I wish to win. But convivial competition does not exclude\ncooperation, in that rival researchers (or research teams) will share\npreliminary results, experience of techniques and so on … Of course, the\nshared knowledge, accessible through books, articles, computer software and\ndirectly, through dialogue with other scientists, forms an intellectual\ncommons.[107](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn107)\n\nObviously this is no longer true of scientists working in the corporate\nsector, where findings are jealously guarded, but the spread of the corporate\nethos within the academy and research institutes themselves has increasingly\ncaused even publicly funded scholars to treat their findings as personal\nproperty. Less is published. Academic publishers ensure that findings that\n_are_ published are more difficult to access, further enclosing the\nintellectual commons. As a result, convivial, open-source competition slides\nfurther into something much more like classic market competition.\n\nThere are all sorts of forms of privatization, up to and including the simple\nbuying-up and suppression of inconvenient discoveries by large corporations\nfor fear of their economic effects.[108](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn108)\nAll this is much noted. More subtle is the way the managerial ethos itself\nmilitates against the implementation of anything remotely adventurous or\nquirky, especially, if there is no prospect of immediate results. Oddly, the\nInternet can be part of the problem here:\n\nMost people who work in corporations or academia have witnessed something like\nthe following: A number of engineers are sitting together in a room, bouncing\nideas off each other. Out of the discussion emerges a new concept that seems\npromising. Then some laptop-wielding person in the corner, having performed a\nquick Google search, announces that this “new” idea is, in fact, an old one;\nit—or at least vaguely similar—has already been tried. Either it failed, or it\nsucceeded. If it failed, then no manager who wants to keep his or her job will\napprove spending money trying to revive it. If it succeeded, then it’s\npatented and entry to the market is presumed to be unattainable, since the\nfirst people who thought of it will have “first-mover advantage” and will have\ncreated “barriers to entry.” The number of seemingly promising ideas that have\nbeen crushed in this way must number in the\nmillions.[109](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn109)\n\nI could go on, but I assume the reader is getting the idea. A timid,\nbureaucratic spirit has come to suffuse every aspect of intellectual life.\nMore often than not, it comes cloaked in a language of creativity, initiative,\nand entrepreneurialism. But the language is meaningless. The sort of thinkers\nmost likely to come up with new conceptual breakthroughs are the least likely\nto receive funding, and if, somehow, breakthroughs nonetheless occur, they\nwill almost certainly never find anyone willing to follow up on the most\ndaring implications.\n\n•\n\nLet me return in more detail to some of the historical context briefly\noutlined in the introduction.\n\nGiovanni Arrighi, the Italian political economist, has observed that after the\nSouth Sea Bubble, British capitalism largely abandoned the corporate form. The\ncombination of high finance and small family firms that had emerged after the\nindustrial revolution continued to hold throughout the next century—Marx’s\nLondon, a period of maximum scientific and technological innovation; or\nManchester; or Birmingham were not dominated by large conglomerates but mainly\nby capitalists who owned a single factory. (This is one reason Marx could\nassume capitalism was characterized by constant cutthroat competition.)\nBritain at that time was also notorious for being just as generous to its\noddballs and eccentrics as contemporary America is intolerant. One common\nexpedient was to allow them to become rural vicars, who, predictably, became\none of the main sources for amateur scientific\ndiscoveries.[110](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn110)\n\nAs I mentioned, contemporary, bureaucratic, corporate capitalism first arose\nin the United States and Germany. The two bloody wars these rivals fought\nculminated, appropriately enough, in vast government-sponsored scientific\nprograms to see who would be the first to discover the atom bomb. Indeed, even\nthe structure of U.S. universities has always been based on the Prussian\nmodel. True, during these early years, both the United States and Germany did\nmanage to find a way to cultivate their creative eccentrics—in fact, a\nsurprising number of the most notorious ones that ended up in America (Albert\nEinstein was the paradigm) actually were German. During the war, when matters\nwere desperate, vast government projects like the Manhattan Project were still\ncapable of accommodating a whole host of bizarre characters (Oppenheimer,\nFeynman, Fuchs …). But as American power grew more and more secure, the\ncountry’s bureaucracy became less and less tolerant of its outliers. And\ntechnological creativity declined.\n\nThe current age of stagnation seems to have begun after 1945, precisely at the\nmoment the United States finally and definitively replaced the UK as organizer\nof the world economy.[111](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn111) True, in the\nearly days of the U.S. Space Program—another period of panic—there was still\nroom for genuine oddballs like Jack Parsons, the founder of NASA’s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory. Parsons was not only a brilliant engineer—he was also a\nThelemite magician in the Aleister Crowley tradition, known for regularly\norchestrating ceremonial orgies in his California home. Parsons believed that\nrocket science was ultimately just one manifestation of deeper, magical\nprinciples. But he was eventually\nfired.[112](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn112) U.S. victory in the Cold War\nguaranteed a corporatization of existing university and scientific\nbureaucracies sufficiently thorough to ensure that no one like him would ever\nget anywhere near a position of authority to start with.\n\nAmericans do not like to think of themselves as a nation of bureaucrats—quite\nthe opposite, really—but, the moment we stop imagining bureaucracy as a\nphenomenon limited to government offices, it becomes obvious that this is\nprecisely what we have become. The final victory over the Soviet Union did not\nreally lead to the domination of “the market.” More than anything, it simply\ncemented the dominance of fundamentally conservative managerial\nelites—corporate bureaucrats who use the pretext of short-term, competitive,\nbottom-line thinking to squelch anything likely to have revolutionary\nimplications of any kind.\n\n\n## **Synthesis**\n\n_On the Movement from Poetic to Bureaucratic Technologies_\n\n“All the labor-saving machinery that has hitherto been invented has not\nlessened the toil of a single human being.”\n\n—John Stuart Mill\n\nIt is the premise of this book that we live in a deeply bureaucratic society.\nIf we do not notice it, it is largely because bureaucratic practices and\nrequirements have become so all-pervasive that we can barely see them—or\nworse, cannot imagine doing things any other way.\n\nComputers have played a crucial role in all of this. Just as the invention of\nnew forms of industrial automation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nhad the paradoxical effect of turning more and more of the world’s population\ninto full-time industrial workers, so has all the software designed to save us\nfrom administrative responsibilities in recent decades ultimately turned us\nall into part or full-time administrators. Just as university professors seem\nto feel it is inevitable that they will spend more and more of their time\nmanaging grants, so do parents simply accept that they will have to spend\nweeks of every year filling out forty-page online forms to get their children\ninto acceptable schools, and store clerks realize that they will be spending\nincreasing slices of their waking lives punching passwords into their phones\nto access, and manage, their various bank and credit accounts, and pretty much\neveryone understands that they have to learn how to perform jobs once\nrelegated to travel agents, brokers, and accountants.\n\nSomeone once figured out that the average American will spend a cumulative six\nmonths of her life waiting for the light to change. I don’t know if similar\nfigures are available for how long she is likely to spend filling out forms,\nbut it must be at least that much. If nothing else, I think it’s safe to say\nthat no population in the history of the world has spent nearly so much time\nengaged in paperwork.\n\nYet all of this is supposed to have happened after the overthrow of horrific,\nold-fashioned, bureaucratic socialism, and the triumph of freedom and the\nmarket. Certainly this is one of the great paradoxes of contemporary life,\nmuch though—like the broken promises of technology—we seem to have developed a\nprofound reluctance to address the problem.\n\nClearly, these problems are linked—I would say, in many ways, they are\nultimately the same problem. Nor is it merely a matter of bureaucratic, or\nmore specifically managerial, sensibilities having choked off all forms of\ntechnical vision and creativity. After all, as we’re constantly reminded, the\nInternet has unleashed all sorts of creative vision and collaborative\ningenuity. What it has really brought about is a kind of bizarre inversion of\nends and means, where creativity is marshaled to the service of administration\nrather than the other way around.\n\nI would put it this way: in this final, stultifying stage of capitalism, we\nare moving from poetic technologies to bureaucratic technologies.\n\nBy poetic technologies, I refer to the use of rational, technical,\nbureaucratic means to bring wild, impossible fantasies to life. Poetic\ntechnologies in this sense are as old as civilization. They could even be said\nto predate complex machinery. Lewis Mumford used to argue that the first\ncomplex machines were actually made of people. Egyptian pharaohs were only\nable to build the pyramids because of their mastery of administrative\nprocedures, which then allowed them to develop production line techniques,\ndividing up complex tasks into dozens of simple operations and assigning each\nto one team of workmen—even though they lacked mechanical technology more\ncomplex than the lever and inclined plane. Bureaucratic oversight turned\narmies of peasant farmers into the cogs of a vast machine. Even much later,\nafter actual cogs had been invented, the design of complex machinery was\nalways to some degree an elaboration of principles originally developed to\norganize people.[113](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn113)\n\nYet still, again and again, we see those machines—whether their moving parts\nare arms and torsos or pistons, wheels, and springs—being put to work to\nrealize otherwise impossible fantasies: cathedrals, moon shots,\ntranscontinental railways, and on and on. Certainly, poetic technologies\nalmost invariably have something terrible about them; the poetry is likely to\nevoke dark satanic mills as much as it does grace or liberation. But the\nrational, bureaucratic techniques are always in service to some fantastic end.\n\nFrom this perspective, all those mad Soviet plans—even if never\nrealized—marked the high-water mark of such poetic technologies. What we have\nnow is the reverse. It’s not that vision, creativity, and mad fantasies are no\nlonger encouraged. It’s that our fantasies remain free-floating; there’s no\nlonger even the pretense that they could ever take form or flesh. Meanwhile,\nin the few areas in which free, imaginative creativity actually is fostered,\nsuch as in open-source Internet software development, it is ultimately\nmarshaled in order to create even more, and even more effective, platforms for\nthe filling out of forms. This is what I mean by “bureaucratic technologies”:\nadministrative imperatives have become not the means, but the end of\ntechnological development. Meanwhile, the greatest and most powerful nation\nthat has ever existed on this earth has spent the last decades telling its\ncitizens that we simply can no longer contemplate grandiose enterprises, even\nif—as the current environmental crisis suggests—the fate of the earth depends\non it.\n\nSo what, then, are the political implications?\n\nFirst of all, it seems to me that we need to radically rethink some of our\nmost basic assumptions about the nature of capitalism. One is that capitalism\nis somehow identical to the market, and that both are therefore inimical to\nbureaucracy, which is a creature of the state. The second is that capitalism\nis in its nature technologically progressive. It would seem that Marx and\nEngels, in their giddy enthusiasm for the industrial revolutions of their day,\nwere simply wrong about this. Or to be more precise: they were right to insist\nthat the mechanization of industrial production would eventually destroy\ncapitalism; they were wrong to predict that market competition would compel\nfactory owners to go on with mechanization anyway. If it didn’t happen, it can\nonly be because market competition is not, in fact, as essential to the nature\nof capitalism as they had assumed. If nothing else, the current form of\ncapitalism, where much of the competition seems to take the form of internal\nmarketing within the bureaucratic structures of large semi-monopolistic\nenterprises, would presumably have come as a complete surprise to\nthem.[114](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn114)\n\nDefenders of capitalism generally make three broad historical claims: first,\nthat it has fostered rapid scientific and technological development; second,\nthat however much it may throw enormous wealth to a small minority, it does so\nin such a way that increases overall prosperity for everyone; third, that in\ndoing so, it creates a more secure and democratic world. It is quite clear\nthat in the twenty-first century, capitalism is not doing any of these things.\nIn fact, even its proponents are increasingly retreating from any claim that\nit is a particular good system, falling back instead on the claim that it is\nthe only possible system—or at least, the only possible system for a complex,\ntechnologically sophisticated society such as our own.\n\nAs an anthropologist, I find myself dealing with this latter argument all the\ntime.\n\n**SKEPTIC :** You can dream your utopian dreams all you like, I’m talking\nabout a political or economic system that could actually work. And experience\nhas shown us that what we have is really the only option here.\n\n**ME :** Our particular current form of limited representative government—or\ncorporate capitalism—is the only possible political or economic system?\nExperience shows us no such thing. If you look at human history, you can find\nhundreds, even thousands of different political and economic systems. Many of\nthem look absolutely nothing like what we have now.\n\n**SKEPTIC :** Sure, but you’re talking about simpler, small-scale societies,\nor ones with a much simpler technological base. I’m talking about modern,\ncomplex, technologically advanced societies. So your counterexamples are\nirrelevant.\n\n**ME :** Wait, so you’re saying that technological progress has actually\nlimited our social possibilities? I thought it was supposed to be the other\nway around!\n\nBut even if you concede the point, and agree that for whatever reason, while a\nwide variety of economic systems might once have been equally viable, modern\nindustrial technology has created a world in which this is no longer the\ncase—could anyone seriously argue that current economic arrangements are also\nthe only ones that will ever be viable under any possible _future_\ntechnological regime as well? Such a statement is self-evidently absurd. If\nnothing else, how could we possibly know?\n\nGranted, there are people who take that position—on both ends of the political\nspectrum. As an anthropologist and anarchist, I have to deal fairly regularly\nwith “anticivilizational” types who insist not only that current industrial\ntechnology can only lead to capitalist-style oppression, but that this must\nnecessarily be true of any future technology as well: and therefore, that\nhuman liberation can only be achieved by a return to the Stone Age. Most of us\nare not such technological determinists. But ultimately, claims for the\npresent-day inevitability of capitalism have to be based on some kind of\ntechnological determinism. And for that very reason, if the ultimate aim of\nneoliberal capitalism is to create a world where no one believes any other\neconomic system could really work, then it needs to suppress not just any idea\nof an inevitable redemptive future, but really any radically different\ntechnological future at all. There’s a kind of contradiction here. It cannot\nmean convincing us that technological change has come to an end—since that\nwould mean capitalism is not really progressive. It means convincing us that\ntechnological progress is indeed continuing, that we do live in a world of\nwonders, but to ensure those wonders largely take the form of modest\nimprovements (the latest iPhone!), rumors of inventions about to happen (“I\nhear they actually are going to have flying cars pretty\nsoon”),[115](part0009_split_002.html#c02-ftn115) even more complex ways of\njuggling information and imagery, and even more complex platforms for the\nfilling out of forms.\n\nI do not mean to suggest that neoliberal capitalism—or any other system—could\never be permanently successful in this regard. First, there’s the problem of\ntrying to convince the world you are leading the way in terms of technological\nprogress when you are actually holding it back. With its decaying\ninfrastructure and paralysis in the face of global warming, the United States\nis doing a particularly bad job of this at the moment. (This is not to mention\nits symbolically devastating abandonment of the manned space program, just as\nChina revs up its own.) Second, there’s the fact that pace of change simply\ncan’t be held back forever. At best it can be slowed down. Breakthroughs will\nhappen; inconvenient discoveries cannot be permanently suppressed. Other, less\nbureaucratized parts of the world—or at least, parts of the world with\nbureaucracies that are not quite so hostile to creative thinking—will, slowly,\ninevitably, attain the resources required to pick up where the United States\nand its allies have left off. The Internet does provide opportunities for\ncollaboration and dissemination that may eventually help break us through the\nwall, as well. Where will the breakthrough come? We can’t know. Over the last\ncouple years, since the first version of this essay saw print, there has been\na whole spate of new possibilities: 3-D printing, advances in materials\ntechnologies, self-driving cars, a new generation of robots, and as a result,\na new spate of discussion of robot factories and the end of work. There are\nhints, too, of impending conceptual breakthroughs in physics, biology, and\nother sciences, made all the more difficult because of the absolute\ninstitutional lock of existing orthodoxies, but which might well have profound\ntechnological implications as well.\n\nAt this point, the one thing I think we can be fairly confident about it is\nthat invention and true innovation will not happen within the framework of\ncontemporary corporate capitalism—or, most likely, any form of capitalism at\nall. It’s becoming increasingly clear that in order to really start setting up\ndomes on Mars, let alone develop the means to figure out if there actually are\nalien civilizations out there to contact—or what would actually happen if we\nshot something through a wormhole—we’re going to have to figure out a\ndifferent economic system entirely. Does it really have to take the form of\nsome massive new bureaucracy? Why do we assume it must? Perhaps it’s only by\nbreaking up existing bureaucratic structures that we’ll ever be able to get\nthere. And if we’re going to actually come up with robots that will do our\nlaundry or tidy up the kitchen, we’re going to have to make sure that whatever\nreplaces capitalism is based on a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth\nand power—one that no longer contains either the super-rich or desperately\npoor people willing to do their housework. Only then will technology begin to\nbe marshaled toward human needs. And this is the best reason to break free of\nthe dead hand of the hedge fund managers and the CEOs—to free our fantasies\nfrom the screens in which such men have imprisoned them, to let our\nimaginations once again become a material force in human history.\n\n\n# **3**\n\n# **The Utopia of Rules, or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All**\n\nEveryone complains about bureaucracy. The essays in this book have themselves\nlargely consisted of such complaints. Nobody seems to likes bureaucracy very\nmuch—yet somehow, we always seem to end up with more of it.\n\nIn this essay I’d like to ask why that is, and particularly, to consider the\npossibility that many of the blanket condemnations of bureaucracy we hear are\nin fact somewhat disingenuous. That the experience of operating within a\nsystem of formalized rules and regulations, under hierarchies of impersonal\nofficials, actually does hold—for many of us much of the time, for all of us\nat least some of the time—a kind of covert appeal.\n\nNow, I am aware this is not the only possible explanation. There is a whole\nschool of thought that holds that bureaucracy tends to expand according to a\nkind of perverse but inescapable inner logic. The argument runs as follows: if\nyou create a bureaucratic structure to deal with some problem, that structure\nwill invariably end up creating other problems that seem as if they, too, can\nonly be solved by bureaucratic means. In universities, this is sometimes\ninformally referred to as the “creating committees to deal with the problem of\ntoo many committees” problem.\n\nA slightly different version of the argument—this is really the core of Max\nWeber’s reflections on the subject—is that a bureaucracy, once created, will\nimmediately move to make itself indispensable to anyone trying to wield power,\nno matter what they wish to do with it. The chief way to do this is always by\nattempting to monopolize access to certain key types of information. Weber is\nworth quoting at length on this subject:\n\nEvery bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of the professionally\ninformed by keeping their knowledge and intentions secret. Bureaucratic\nadministration always tends to be an administration of “secret sessions”: in\nso far as it can, it hides its knowledge and action from criticism …\n\nThe concept of the “official secret” is the specific invention of bureaucracy,\nand nothing is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this attitude,\nwhich cannot be substantially justified beyond these specifically qualified\nareas. In facing a parliament, the bureaucracy, out of a sure power instinct,\nfights every attempt of the parliament to gain knowledge by means of its own\nexperts or from interest groups …\n\nThe absolute monarch is powerless opposite the superior knowledge of the\nbureaucratic expert—in a certain sense more powerless than any other political\nhead. All the scornful decrees of Frederick the Great concerning the\n“abolition of serfdom” were derailed, as it were, in the course of their\nrealization because the official mechanism simply ignored them as the\noccasional ideas of a dilettante. When a constitutional king agrees with a\nsocially important part of the governed, he very frequently exerts a greater\ninfluence upon the course of administration than does the “absolute monarch.”\nThe constitutional king can control these experts—better because of what is,\nat least relatively, the public character of criticism, whereas the absolute\nmonarch is dependent for information solely upon the bureaucracy. The Russian\nczar of the old regime was seldom able to accomplish permanently anything that\ndispleased his bureaucracy and hurt the power interests of the\nbureaucrats.[116](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn116)\n\nOne side effect, as Weber also observes, is that once you do create a\nbureaucracy, it’s almost impossible to get rid of it. The very first\nbureaucracies we know of were in Mesopotamia and Egypt, and these continued to\nexist, largely unchanged, as one dynasty or ruling elite replaced another, for\nliterally thousands of years. Similarly, waves of successful invaders were not\nenough to dislodge the Chinese civil service, with its bureaus, reports, and\nexamination system, which remained firmly in place no matter who actually\nclaimed the Mandate of Heaven. In fact, as Weber also noted, foreign invaders\nneeded the skills and knowledge so jealously guarded by Chinese bureaucrats\neven more than indigenous rulers did, for obvious reasons. The only real way\nto rid oneself of an established bureaucracy, according to Weber, is to simply\nkill them all, as Alaric the Goth did in Imperial Rome, or Genghis Khan in\ncertain parts of the Middle East. Leave any significant number of\nfunctionaries alive, and within a few years, they will inevitably end up\nmanaging one’s kingdom.\n\nThe second possible explanation is that bureaucracy does not just make itself\nindispensable to rulers, but holds a genuine appeal to those it administers as\nwell. One need not agree here with Weber’s curious celebration of bureaucratic\nefficiency. The simplest explanation for the appeal of bureaucratic procedures\nlies in their impersonality. Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic relations are much\nlike cash transactions, and both offer similar advantages and disadvantages.\nOn the one hand they are soulless. On the other, they are simple, predictable,\nand—within certain parameters, at least—treat everyone more or less the same.\nAnd anyway, who really wants to live in a world where everything is soul?\nBureaucracy holds out at least the possibility of dealing with other human\nbeings in ways that do not demand either party has to engage in all those\ncomplex and exhausting forms of interpretive labor described in the first\nessay in this book, where just as you can simply place your money on the\ncounter and not have to worry about what the cashier thinks of how you’re\ndressed, you can also pull out your validated photo ID card without having to\nexplain to the librarian why you are so keen to read about homoerotic themes\nin eighteenth century British verse. Surely this is part of the appeal. In\nfact, if one really ponders the matter, it’s hard to imagine how, even if we\ndo achieve some utopian communal society, some impersonal (dare I say,\nbureaucratic?) institutions would not still be necessary, and for just this\nreason. To take one obvious example: languishing on some impersonal lottery\nsystem or waiting list for a desperately needed organ transplant might be\nalienating and distressing, but it’s difficult to envision any less impersonal\nway of allocating a limited pool of hearts or kidneys that would not be\nimmeasurably worse.\n\nThis is, as I say, the simplest explanation. But in this essay I’d like to\nexplore the possibility that all this goes much deeper. It’s not just that the\nimpersonal relations bureaucracies afford are convenient; to some degree, at\nleast, our very ideas of rationality, justice, and above all, freedom, are\nfounded on them. To explain why I believe this to be the case, let me begin,\nfirst of all, by examining two moments in human history when new bureaucratic\nforms actually did inspire not just widespread passive acquiescence but giddy\nenthusiasm, even infatuation, and try to understand precisely what it was\nabout them that seemed, to so many people, so exciting.\n\n**I. The Enchantment of Disenchantment, or The Magical Powers of the Post\nOffice**\n\nOne reason it was possible for Weber to describe bureaucracy as the very\nembodiment of rational efficiency is that in the Germany of his day,\nbureaucratic institutions really did work well. Perhaps the flagship\ninstitution, the pride and joy of the German civil service was the Post\nOffice. In the late nineteenth century, the German postal service was\nconsidered one of the great wonders of the modern world. Its efficiency was so\nlegendary, in fact, that it casts a kind of terrible shadow across the\ntwentieth century. Many of the greatest achievements of what we now call “high\nmodernism” were inspired by—or in many cases, built in direct imitation of—the\nGerman Post Office. And one could indeed make a case that many of the most\nterrible woes of that century can also be laid at its feet.\n\nTo understand how this could be, we need to understand a little of the real\norigins of the modern social welfare state, which we now largely think of—when\nwe think of them at all—as having been created by benevolent democratic\nelites. Nothing could be further from the truth. In Europe, most of the key\ninstitutions of what later became the welfare state—everything from social\ninsurance and pensions to public libraries and public health clinics—were not\noriginally created by governments at all, but by trade unions, neighborhood\nassociations, cooperatives, and working-class parties and organizations of one\nsort or another. Many of these were engaged in a self-conscious revolutionary\nproject of “building a new society in the shell of the old,” of gradually\ncreating Socialist institutions from below. For some it was combined with the\naim of eventually seizing control of the government through parliamentary\nmeans, for others, it was a project in itself. One must remember that during\nthe late nineteenth century, even the direct heirs of Marx’s Communist Party\nhad largely abandoned the idea of seizing control of the government by force,\nsince this no longer seemed necessary; in a Europe at peace and witnessing\nrapid technological progress, they felt that it should be possible to create a\nsocial revolution through peaceful, electoral means.\n\nGermany was one of the places where such parties were most successful. Even\nthough Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, the great mastermind behind the creation\nof the German state, allowed his parliament only limited powers, he was\nconfounded by the rapid rise of workers’ parties, and continually worried by\nthe prospect of a Socialist majority, or a possible Paris Commune-style\nuprising in his new united Germany. His reaction to Socialist electoral\nsuccess from 1878 was twofold: on the one hand, to ban the Socialist party,\ntrade unions, and leftist newspapers; on the other, when this proved\nineffective (Socialist candidates continued to run, and win, as independents),\nto create a top-down alternative to the free schools, workers’ associations,\nfriendly societies, libraries, theaters, and the larger process of building\nsocialism from below. This took the form of a program of social insurance (for\nunemployment, health and disability, etc.), free education, pensions, and so\nforth—much of it watered-down versions of policies that had been part of the\nSocialist platform, but in every case, carefully purged of any democratic,\nparticipatory elements. In private, at least, he was utterly candid about\ndescribing these efforts as a “bribe,” an effort to buy out working-class\nloyalties to his conservative nationalist\nproject.[117](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn117) When left-wing regimes did\nlater take power, the template had already been established, and almost\ninvariably, they took the same top-down approach, incorporating locally\norganized clinics, libraries, mutual banking initiatives, workers’ education\ncenters, and the like into the administrative structure of the state.\n\nIn Germany, the real model for this new administrative structure was,\ncuriously, the post office—though when one understands the history of the\npostal service, it makes a great deal of sense. The post office was,\nessentially, one of the first attempts to apply top-down, military forms of\norganization to the public good. Historically, postal services first emerged\nfrom the organization of armies and empires. They were originally ways of\nconveying field reports and orders over long distances; later, by extension, a\nkey means of keeping the resulting empires together. Hence Herodotus’ famous\nquote about Persian imperial messengers, with their evenly spaced posts with\nfresh horses, which he claimed allowed the swiftest travel on earth: “Neither\nsnow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the\nswift completion of their appointed rounds” still appears carved over the\nentrance to the Central Post Office building in New York, opposite Penn\nStation.[118](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn118) The Roman Empire had a\nsimilar system, and pretty much all armies operated with postal courier\nsystems until Napoleon adopted semaphore in 1805.\n\nOne of the great innovations of eighteenth- and especially nineteenth-century\ngovernance was to expand what had once been military courier systems into the\nbasis for an emerging civil service whose primary purpose was providing\nservices for the public. It happened first in commerce, and then expanded as\nthe commercial classes also began to use the post for personal or political\ncorrespondence—until finally it was being used by just about\neveryone.[119](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn119) Before long, in many of the\nemerging nation-states in Europe and the Americas, half the government budget\nwas spent on—and more than half the civil service employed in—the postal\nservice.[120](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn120)\n\nIn Germany, one could even make the argument that the nation was created, more\nthan anything else, _by_ the post office. Under the Holy Roman Empire, the\nright to run a postal courier system within imperial territories had been\ngranted, in good feudal fashion, to a noble family originally from Milan,\nlater to be known as the Barons von Thurn and Taxis (one later scion of this\nfamily, according to legend, was the inventor of the taximeter, which is why\ntaxicabs ultimately came to bear his name). The Prussian Empire originally\nbought out the Thurn and Taxis monopoly in 1867, and used it as the basis for\na new German national post—and over the next two decades, the sure sign that a\nnew statelet or principality had been absorbed into the emerging nation-state\nwas its incorporation into the German postal system. Partly for this reason,\nthe sparkling efficiency of the system became a point of national pride. And\nindeed, the German post of the late nineteenth century was nothing if not\nimpressive, boasting up to five or even nine delivery times a day in major\ncities, and, in the capital, a vast network of miles of pneumatic tubes\ndesigned to shoot letters and small parcels almost instantly across long\ndistances using a system of pressurized air:\n\n![](../images/00012.jpeg)\n\n_Map of Berlin pneumatic tube postal system, 1873_\n\n![](../images/00013.jpeg)\n\nMark Twain, who lived briefly in Berlin between 1891 and 1892, was so taken\nwith it that he composed one of his only known non-satirical essays, entitled\n“Postal Service,” just to celebrate its wondrous\nefficiency.[121](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn121) Nor was he the only\nforeigner to be so impressed. Just a few months before the outbreak of Russian\nrevolution, Vladimir Ilych Lenin wrote:\n\nA witty German Social-Democrat of the seventies of the last century called the\n_postal service_ an example of the socialist economic system. This is very\ntrue. At present the postal service is a business organized on the lines of a\nstate _-capitalist_ monopoly. Imperialism is gradually transforming all trusts\ninto organizations of a similar type …\n\nTo organize the _whole_ national economy on the lines of the postal service,\nso that the technicians, foremen, bookkeepers, as well as _all_ officials,\nshall receive salaries no higher than “a workman’s wage,” all under the\ncontrol and leadership of the armed proletariat—this is our immediate\naim.[122](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn122)\n\nSo there you have it. The organization of the Soviet Union was directly\nmodeled on that of the German postal service.\n\nNeither were state socialists the only ones to be impressed. Even anarchists\njoined the chorus; though they were less interested in the national system\nthan in relations between them—the fact that it was possible to send a letter\nfrom Venezuela to China despite the absence of any single overarching state.\nIn fact, Peter Kropotkin often cited the international “universal postal\nunion” of 1878 (along with accords between railroad companies) as a model for\nanarchism—again, emphasizing that this was something that was _already_ taking\nshape at the top of imperial systems:\n\nThe Postal Union did not elect an international postal parliament in order to\nmake laws for all postal organizations adherent to the Union … They proceeded\nby means of agreement. To agree together they resorted to congresses; but,\nwhile sending delegates to their congresses they did not say to them, “Vote\nabout everything you like—we shall obey.” They put forward questions and\ndiscussed them first themselves; then they sent delegates acquainted with the\nspecial question to be discussed at the congress, and they sent _delegates_\n—not rulers.[123](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn123)\n\nThis vision of a potential future paradise emerging from within the Post\nOffice was not confined to Europe. Indeed, the country that was soon to emerge\nas Germany’s chief rival for global influence, the United States, was also\nheld out as a model for a new type of civilization, and the efficiency of its\nown Post Service was considered _prima facie_ evidence. Already in the 1830s,\nTocqueville had been startled by the size of the postal system and the sheer\nvolume of letters being moved about even on the frontier. During one journey\nthrough Kentucky to Michigan he noted: “There is an astonishing circulation of\nletters and newspapers among these savage woods,” far more, he calculated,\nthan in even the most populous and commercial provinces of France. In the\nwords of one later historian of the American Republic:\n\nAmericans would soon make their postal system larger than the postal systems\nof either Britain or France. By 1816 the postal system had over thirty-three\nhundred offices, employing nearly 70 percent of the entire federal civilian\nworkforce. The amount of mail increased just as quickly. In the year 1790 the\npostal system had carried only three hundred thousand letters, one for about\nevery fifteen persons in the country. By 1815 it transmitted nearly seven and\na half million letters during the year, which was about one for every person …\nAnd, unlike the situation in Great Britain and other European nations, the\nmail was transmitted without government surveillance or\ncontrol.[124](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn124)\n\nIn fact, for much of the century, from the perspective of a majority of\nAmericans, the postal service effectively _was_ the Federal government. By\n1831, its staff already far outnumbered that of all other branches of\ngovernment combined, it was substantially larger than the army, and for most\nsmall-town dwellers, postal employees were the only Federal officials they\nwere ever likely to meet.\n\nIn Europe, the United States was at that time itself seen as a kind of utopian\nexperiment, with its rejection of laissezfaire economics, and widespread\nreliance on cooperatives and government-sponsored projects and tariff\nprotections. It was only with the rise of corporate capitalism after the Civil\nWar that the United States also adopted something closer to the German model\nof bureaucratic capitalism. When it did, the post office model came to be\nseen, by Populists and especially Progressives, as the major viable\nalternative. Again, the forms of a new, freer, more rational society seemed to\nbe emerging within the very structures of oppression itself. In the United\nStates, the term used was “postalization”—a unique American coinage for\nnationalization (and one which has, significantly, since completely\ndisappeared from the language). Yet at the same time as Weber and Lenin were\ninvoking the German post office as a model for the future, American\nProgressives were arguing that even private business would be more efficient\nwere it run like the post office, and scoring major victories for\npostalization, such as the nationalization of the once-private subway,\ncommuter, and interstate train systems, which in major American cities have\nremained in public hands ever since.\n\nIn retrospect, all these fantasies of postal utopia seem rather quaint, at\nbest. We now associate national postal systems mainly with the arrival of\nthings we never wanted in the first place: utility bills, overdraft alerts,\nmail-order catalogs, solicitations, sweepstakes, calls to jury duty, tax\naudits, one-time-only credit-card offers, and charity appeals. Insofar as\nAmericans have a popular image of postal workers, it has become increasingly\nsqualid. But this didn’t just happen. It is the result of intentional policy\nchoices. Since the 1980s, legislators have led the way in systematically\ndefunding the post office and encouraging private alternatives as part of an\nongoing campaign to convince Americans that government doesn’t really\nwork.[125](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn125) As a result, the Postal Service\nquickly became the very definition of everything we were supposed to think was\nwrong with state bureaucracies: there were endless newspaper stories about\nstrikes, drug-addled workers, houses full of years’ worth of undelivered mail,\nand of course, most famously, employees periodically “going postal” and\nopening fire on managers, fellow workers, and members of the police or general\npublic. In fact the only reference I could find to the term “postalization” in\ncontemporary literature is an essay on workplace violence called “the\npostalization of corporate America,” decrying how an epidemic of violent\nattacks on bosses and co-workers was spreading from the public sector into\nprivate corporations, too.\n\nIn a fascinating book called _Going Postal: Rage, Murder, and Rebellion from\nReagan’s Workplaces to Clinton’s Columbine and Beyond_ , Mark Ames carefully\npicked through journalistic accounts of such events (which did, indeed,\nquickly spread from the Post Office to private offices and factories, and even\nto private postal services like UPS, but in the process, became so commonplace\nthat many barely made the national news) and noted that the language they\nemploy, which always described these events as acts of inexplicable individual\nrage and madness—severed from any consideration of the systematic humiliations\nthat always seem to set them off—bears an uncanny resemblance to the way the\nnineteenth-century press treated slave\nrevolts.[126](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn126) Ames notes that there were\nremarkably few organized slave rebellions in American history. But there were\na fair number of incidents in which individual slaves, or small groups, struck\nout in a similar fashion against overseers, masters, and their families with\naxes, knives, poison, or whatever means of immediate violence were at hand. In\nboth cases, journalists treated such outbreaks as the result of either\nindividual insanity, or inexplicable malice. In fact, to even suggest possible\nstructural explanations—to speak of the evils of slavery, or to point out that\nbefore the eighties reforms in corporate culture that destroyed earlier\nassurances of secure lifetime employment and protections for workers against\narbitrary and humiliating treatment by superiors, there had not been a single\nworkplace massacre in all American history (_other_ than by slaves)—seemed\nsomehow immoral, since it would imply such violence was in some way justified.\n\nIt can’t be denied, too, there was a major racial component in the rhetoric.\nJust as for much of the twentieth century the post office stood, in the eyes\nof working-class African-American communities, as the very paradigm of stable,\nsecure, but also respectable and community service-oriented\nemployment,[127](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn127) so after Reagan it came\nto be pictured as embodying all the supposed degradation, violence, drug\nabuse, and inefficiency of a welfare state that was viewed in deeply racist\nterms. (This identification of African-Americans both with the stuffy\nbureaucrat, and with scary random violence, appears again and again in U.S.\npopular culture—though rarely, it’s true, both at the same time. It is a\nstrange, repetitive feature of action movies that the infuriating go-by-the-\nrules boss of the maverick hero is almost invariably\nBlack.)[128](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn128)\n\nYet at the very same time that symbolic war was being waged on the Postal\nService—as it was descending in the popular imagination into a place of\nmadness, degradation, and violence—something remarkably similar to the turn-\nof-the-century infatuation with the Postal Service was happening again. Let us\nsummarize the story so far:\n\n1\\. A new communications technology develops out of the military.\n\n2\\. It spreads rapidly, radically reshaping everyday life.\n\n3\\. It develops a reputation for dazzling efficiency.\n\n4\\. Since it operates on non-market principles, it is quickly seized on by\nradicals as the first stirrings of a future, non-capitalist economic system\nalready developing within the shell of the old.\n\n5\\. Despite this, it quickly becomes the medium, too, for government\nsurveillance and the dissemination of endless new forms of advertising and\nunwanted paperwork.\n\nPut it in these terms, it should be obvious enough what I’m referring to. This\nis pretty much exactly the story of the Internet. What is email, after all,\nbut a giant, globe-spanning, electronic, super-efficient Post Office? Has it\nnot, too, created a sense of a new, remarkably effective form of cooperative\neconomy emerging from within the shell of capitalism itself—even as it has\ndeluged us with scams, spam, and commercial offers, and allowed the government\nto spy on us in new and creative ways?\n\nObviously, there are differences. Most obviously, the Internet involves a much\nmore participatory, bottom-up form of cooperation. This is important. But for\nthe moment, I am less interested in the larger historical significance of the\nphenomenon than I am in asking: what does this tell us about the appeal of\nbureaucracy itself?\n\nWell, first of all, it seems significant that while both postal services and\nthe Internet emerge from the military, they could be seen as adopting military\ntechnologies to quintessential antimilitary purposes. Organized violence, as\nI’ve argued, insofar as it is a form of communication, is one that radically\nstrips down, simplifies, and ultimately prevents communication; insofar as it\nas a form of action, it is really a form of anti-action, because its ultimate\npurpose is to prevent others from being able to act (either to act in certain\nways, or, if one kills them, to ever act in any way ever again.) Yet here we\nhave a way of taking those very stripped-down, minimalistic forms of action\nand communication typical of military systems—whether chains of command or\nbinary codes—and turning them into the invisible base on which everything they\nare not can be constructed: dreams, projects, declarations of love and\npassion, artistic effusions, subversive manifestos, or pretty much anything\nelse. They allow for the creation and maintenance of social relations that\ncould never have existed otherwise. But all this also implies that bureaucracy\nappeals to us—that it seems at its most liberating—precisely when it\ndisappears: when it becomes so rational and reliable that we are able to just\ntake it for granted that we can go to sleep on a bed of numbers and wake up\nwith all those numbers still snugly in place.\n\nIn this sense, bureaucracy enchants when it can be seen as a species of what\nI’ve called poetic technology, that is, one where mechanical forms of\norganization, usually military in their ultimate inspiration, can be marshaled\nto the realization of impossible visions: to create cities out of nothing,\nscale the heavens, make the desert bloom. For most of human history this kind\nof power was only available to the rulers of empires or commanders of\nconquering armies, so we might even speak here of a democratization of\ndespotism. Once, the privileged of waving one’s hand and having a vast\ninvisible army of cogs and wheels organize themselves in such a way as to\nbring your whims into being was available only to the very most privileged\nfew; in the modern world, it can be subdivided into millions of tiny portions\nand made available to everyone able to write a letter, or to flick a\nswitch.[129](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn129)\n\nAll this implies a certain very peculiar notion of freedom. Even more, I\nthink, it marks a reversal of earlier ways of thinking about rationality whose\nsignificance could hardly be more profound.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by this.\n\nWestern intellectual traditions have always tended to assume that humans’\npowers of reason exist, first and foremost, as ways of restraining our baser\ninstincts. The assumption can already be found in Plato and Aristotle, and it\nwas strongly reinforced when classical theories of the soul were adopted into\nChristianity and Islam. Yes, the argument went, we all have animalistic drives\nand passions, just as we have our powers of creativity and imagination, but\nthese impulses are ultimately chaotic and antisocial. Reason—whether in the\nindividual or the political community—exists to keep our lower nature in\ncheck, to repress, channel, and contain potentially violent energies in such a\nway that they do not lead to chaos and mutual destruction. It is a moral\nforce. This is why, for instance, the word _polis_ , the political community\nand place of rational order, is the same root that gives us both “politeness”\nand “police.” As a result, too, there is always a lurking sense in this\ntradition that there must be something at least vaguely demonic about our\npowers of creativity.\n\nThe emergence of bureaucratic populism, as I’ve been describing it,\ncorresponds to a complete reversal of this conception of rationality—to a new\nideal, one most famously summed up by David Hume: that “reason is and ought\nonly to be the slave of the\npassions.”[130](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn130) Rationality, in this view,\nhas nothing to do with morality. It is a purely technical affair—an\ninstrument, a machine, a means of calculating how to most efficiently achieve\ngoals that could not themselves be in any way assessed in rational terms.\nReason cannot tell us what we should want. It can only tell us how best to get\nit.\n\nIn both versions, reason was somehow outside of creativity, desire, or the\npassions; however, in one, it acted to restrain such passions; in the other,\nto facilitate them.\n\nThe emerging field of economics might have developed this logic the furthest,\nbut it is a logic that traces back at least as much to bureaucracy as to the\nmarket. (And one must remember, most economists are, and always have been,\nemployed by large bureaucratic organizations of one sort or another.) The\nwhole idea that one can make a strict division between means and ends, between\nfacts and values, is a product of the bureaucratic mind-set, because\nbureaucracy is the first and only social institution that treats the means of\ndoing things as entirely separate from what it is that’s being\ndone.[131](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn131) In this way, bureaucracy really\nhas become embedded in the common sense of at least a very substantial part of\nthe world’s population for quite a long period of time.\n\nBut at the same time, it’s not as if the older idea of rationality has ever\nentirely gone away. To the contrary: the two coexist, despite being almost\ncompletely contradictory—in constant friction. As a result, our very\nconception of rationality is strangely incoherent. It’s entirely unclear what\nthe word is supposed to mean. Sometimes it’s a means, sometimes it’s an end.\nSometimes it has nothing to do with morality, sometimes it’s the very essence\nof what’s right and good. Sometimes it’s a method for solving problems; other\ntimes, it is itself the solution to all possible problems.\n\n**II. Rationalism as a Form of Spirituality**\n\nThis bizarre state of affairs is worth reflecting on, because it is at the\nvery core of our conception of bureaucracy. On the one hand, we have the\nnotion that bureaucratic systems are simply neutral social technologies. They\nare just ways of getting from A to B, and have no implications whatsoever for\nthe rights and wrongs of the matter. I well remember a friend who attended the\nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, a\nworld-renowned training ground for top-level administrators, reporting to me\nwith an almost shocked delight that he had just been obliged to sign up for a\ncourse in “value free ethics.” On the face of it, this sounds absurd. But\nreally the concept follows necessarily from this notion of the role of\nbureaucrats: that they are public servants, and it is the responsibility of\nservants to do their masters’ bidding, no matter what that bidding is. Insofar\nas their master is something called “the public,” however, this creates\ncertain problems: how to figure out what, exactly, the public really wants\nthem to do. This was what they taught budding functionaries in the “value free\nethics” course: how, for example, in the case of planners designing a highway\nsystem, one might apply quantitative methods to determine the relative\nimportance to the public of (a) getting to work on time, and (b) not being\nkilled or maimed in a car accident (in economic jargon, their “revealed\npreferences” on the matter), and then set the speed limit accordingly.\n\nOn the other hand, in complete contradiction with this, there remains a modern\nincarnation of the earlier idea of rationality as moral order and therefore as\nan end in itself. Pretty much anyone with a utopian vision, whether Socialist,\nfree market, or for that matter religious fundamentalist, dreams of creating a\nsocial order that will, unlike current arrangements, make some sort of\ncoherent sense—and which will, therefore, represent the triumph of reason over\nchaos.[132](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn132) Needless to say, creating an\neffective bureaucracy always turns out to be the cornerstone of any such\nproject.\n\nArguments about the role of “rationality” in politics almost invariably play\nfast and loose with these two contradictory ideas.\n\nIf one tries to go back to basic definitions, things don’t get much better. In\nmany ways they become considerably worse. There is no consensus amongst\nphilosophers about what the word “rationality” even means. According to one\ntradition, for instance, rationality is the application of logic, of pure\nthought untempered by emotions; this pure, objective thought is then seen as\nthe basis of scientific inquiry. This has attained a great deal of popular\npurchase, but there’s a fundamental problem: scientific inquiry itself has\nproved it cannot possibly be true. Cognitive psychologists have demonstrated\nagain and again that there is no such thing as pure thought divorced from\nemotions; a human being without emotions would not be able to think at\nall.[133](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn133)\n\nOthers prefer a more pragmatic approach, claiming merely that a rational\nargument can be defined as one that is both grounded in empirical reality, and\nlogically coherent in form. The problem here is that these two criteria don’t\nreally have much to do with one another. One is about observation; the other\nis about reasoning.[134](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn134) What _do_ they\nhave in common? Mainly, it seems, that when someone makes an argument that is\neither delusional or incoherent, we are equally likely to write that person\noff as not right in the head. On one level, that’s fair enough: we do call\ncrazy people “irrational.” But if so, calling someone, or an argument,\n“rational” is saying almost nothing. It’s a very weak statement. You’re just\nsaying they are not obviously insane.\n\nBut the moment you turn it around, you realize that claiming one’s own\npolitical positions are based on “rationality” is an extremely strong\nstatement. In fact, it’s extraordinarily arrogant, since it means that those\nwho disagree with those positions are not just wrong, but crazy. Similarly, to\nsay one wishes to create a “rational” social order implies that current social\narrangements might as well have been designed by the inhabitants of a lunatic\nasylum. Now, surely, all of us have felt this way at one time or another. But\nif nothing else, it is an extraordinarily intolerant position, since it\nimplies that one’s opponents are not just wrong, but in a certain sense,\nwouldn’t even know what it would mean to be right, unless, by some miracle,\nthey could come around and accept the light of reason and decide to accept\nyour own conceptual framework and point of view.\n\nThis tendency to enshrine rationality as a political virtue has had the\nperverse effect of encouraging those repelled by such pretentions, or by the\npeople who profess them, to claim to reject rationality entirely, and embrace\n“irrationalism.” Of course, if we simply take rationality in its minimal\ndefinition, any such position is absurd. You can’t really make an argument\nagainst rationality, because for that argument to be convincing, it would\nitself have to be framed in rational terms. If one is willing to argue with\nanother person at all, one must accept, at least on a tacit level, that\narguments based in an accurate assessment of reality are better than ones that\nare not (that is, that any argument that proceeds from the assumption that all\nbuildings are made of green cheese is not worth taking seriously), and that\narguments that follow the laws of logic are better than those that violate\nthen (i.e., that an argument that since the Mayor of Cincinnati is human, all\nhumans are the Mayor of Cincinnati, can be similarly dismissed).\n\nThis is not the place to enter into all the logical traps and contradictions\nthat result from this situation. I simply wish to ask how we ever got to this\npoint at all. Here I think we have no choice but to go back to the very\nbeginning, and look at the historical origins of the Western concept of\n“rationality” in the Greek cities of Southern Italy in the middle of the first\nmillennium BC.\n\nThe first philosophical school to represent themselves as rationalists, and to\ntreat rationality as a value in itself, were the Pythagoreans, who were\nsimultaneously a philosophical and scientific school, and a kind of political\ncult or confraternity that managed, at one point or another, to take control\nof several Italian cities.[135](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn135) Their\ngreat intellectual discovery was that there was a formal similarity between\nthe kind of mathematical ratios that could be observed in geometry, musical\nintervals, and the movements of the planets. The conclusion they reached was\nthat the universe was, on some ultimate level at least, composed of numbers—a\nnotion now largely remembered for the rather charming concept of the inaudible\n“music of the spheres.” The cosmos, according to the Pythagoreans, was\nrational because it was ultimately an expression of the principles of number,\npitch, and vibration, and when the human mind (or soul) exercised its powers\nof reason, it was simply participating in that larger rational order, the\ncosmic “world soul” that animated\nall.[136](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn136)\n\nThis was the picture of the universe Plato largely adopted in _Timaeus_ , and\nit had enormous influence. By the first and second century of the Roman\nEmpire, in fact, variations on the basic Pythagorean set of ideas had been\nadopted by pretty much all major philosophical schools—not just the\nNeoplatonists but the Stoics and even, to some extent, the Epicureans. What’s\nmore, it formed the philosophical basis of what Hans Joas originally dubbed\nthe emerging “cosmic religion” of late Antiquity, a fusion of elements of\nGreek cosmological speculation, Babylonian astrology, and Egyptian theology,\noften combined with strains of Jewish thought and various traditions of\npopular magic.[137](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn137) As Joas noted, this\ncosmic religion—which assumed that God, Reason, and the Cosmos were the same,\nand the higher faculties in humans were themselves a form of participation in\nthis rational cosmic order—for all its grandeur, represented a kind of\npolitical retreat. The Pythagoreans, like most Greek philosophers, had been\navid participants in the political life of the city, which they often sought\nto reconstitute on rational grounds. Under the Roman Empire, this was\nimpossible. All political questions were now settled. A single—and apparently\neternal—legal and bureaucratic order regulated public affairs; instead of\naspiring to change this structure, intellectuals increasingly embraced\noutright mysticism, aspiring to find new ways to transcend earthly systems\nentirely, rising through the various planetary spheres, purging themselves of\nmateriality, to the rarified sphere of pure reason, a divine realm of\ntranscendent mathematical laws that governed time and motion and ultimately\nrendered them illusory. God did not impose these laws, He _was_ those laws.\nHuman reason, then, was simply the action of that divine principle within us.\nIn this sense, rationality was not just a spiritual notion, it was mystical: a\ntechnique for achieving union with the divine.\n\nThis set of assumptions about the nature of rationality, absorbed into\nChristianity through Augustine, informs pretty much all Medieval philosophy as\nwell, however difficult it was to reconcile with the notion of a transcendent\nwillful Creator (and indeed, much Medieval philosophy was precisely concerned\nwith arguing about different ways of reconciling them).\n\nIn many ways, all these assumptions are very much still with us. Take the\nnotion, which we all learn as children and most of us accept as self-evident\ntruth, that what sets humans apart from other animals is rationality (that we,\nas a species, “possess the faculty of reason.”) This is very much a Medieval\nnotion.[138](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn138) If you think about it, it\nalso doesn’t make a lot of sense. If “rationality” is just the ability to\nassess reality more or less as it is and to draw logical conclusions, then\nmost animals are extremely rational. They solve problems all the time. Most\nmight not be nearly as good at it as humans but there is no fundamental\ndifference in kind. There are plenty of other faculties that would make much\nbetter candidates—ones that actually do seem to be unique to humans. One\nobvious choice would be imagination. Animals act in what seem like rational,\ncalculating, goal-directed ways all the time, but it’s harder to make a case\nthat most of them engage in creating self-conscious fantasy\nworlds.[139](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn139) Hence the anthropologist\nEdmund Leach once remarked that what sets humans apart from animals is not\nthat they possess an immortal soul, but rather, that they are capable of\nimagining that they have one.[140](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn140) But of\ncourse, if the soul is the seat of Reason, the divine element in Man, to say\nthat humans are in possession of an immortal soul, and to say that they are\nrational creatures, is to say precisely the same\nthing.[141](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn141)\n\nThis conclusion inevitably followed from the logic of the Great Chain of\nBeing, where all living creatures were ranked in a single hierarchy of\nincreasing rationality according to their proximity to God, with humans placed\nat the top of the natural order, between animals and angels.\n\nIt’s easy to see the grand cosmic hierarchies of late Antiquity, with their\narchons, planets, and gods, all operating under the unfolding of abstract\nrational laws, as simply images of the Roman legal bureaucratic order writ\nvery, very large. The curious thing is how this ultimately bureaucratic\npicture of the cosmos was maintained for a thousand years after the Roman\nEmpire had collapsed. Medieval and Renaissance theologians produced endless\nspeculative tracts about angelic hierarchies that if anything represented the\nuniverse as more systematically bureaucratic than anything ancient\nphilosophers had imagined:[142](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn142)\n\n![](../images/00014.jpeg)\n\nSo, for instance, in the sixteenth century, Marsilio Ficino provided the\nfollowing summary of the angelic hierarchy, drawing from the work of a fourth\ncentury Christian Neoplatonist whose real name has long since been forgotten,\nvia the elaborations of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Dante:\n\n**Seraphim** speculate on the order and providence of God.\n\n**Cherubim** speculate on the essence and form of God.\n\n**Thrones** also speculate, though some descend to works.\n\n**Dominions** , like architects, design what the rest execute.\n\n**Virtues** execute, and move the heavens, and concur for the working of\nmiracles as God’s instruments.\n\n**Powers** watch that the order of divine governance is not interrupted and\nsome of them descend to human things.\n\n**Principalities** care for public affairs, nations, princes, magistrates.\n\n**Archangels** direct the divine cult and look after sacred things.\n\n**Angels** look after smaller affairs and take charge of individuals as their\nguardian angels.[143](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn143)\n\nAngels are “celestial intelligences” ranked in order from those who engage in\npure thought to those who concern themselves with the actual governance of\nworldly affairs. At a time when actual governance in Europe was as broken and\nfragmented as it could possibly be, its intellectuals were busying themselves\narguing about the exact division of powers within a single, grand, unified,\nimaginary system of cosmic administration.\n\nNowadays, the grand synthesis of late Antiquity, revived by Renaissance\nalchemists and mages like Ficino, Agrippa, and Giordano Bruno (and in the\nprocess infused with Cabala, and other spiritual traditions), survives largely\nas the basis of Western ceremonial magic. The Enlightenment is supposed to\nhave marked a fundamental break with it. But the fundamental structure of\nassumptions did not really change. The appeal to rationality in Descartes and\nhis successors remains a fundamentally spiritual, even mystical, commitment,\nthat the mathematical or math-like abstractions that are assumed to be the\nessence of thought, are also the ordering principles that regulate nature—and\nthis remained true whether they were identified with God, or seen as the\nultimate proof of God’s nonexistence.\n\nIt is hard to think this way because of course we have by now come to identify\nthe soul not with reason, but with everything that makes us unique,\nidiosyncratic, or imaginative. But this view is a product of the Romantic era,\nand one that, at the time, marked a near total break from earlier conceptions.\nAgain, this is hardly the place to go into detail concerning the arguments\nabout the relation between reason, imagination, and desire that came out of\nit, but it does help us understand why it is that the notion of “rationality,”\nand particularly, of bureaucratic rationality, never seems to be able to\ncontain itself to simple questions of deductive reasoning, or even technical\nefficiency, but almost invariably ends up trying to turn itself into some\ngrandiose cosmological scheme.\n\n**III. On the Bureaucratization of the Antibureaucratic Fantasy**\n\n“The point when I decided I just didn’t care about that [academic] job any\nmore was when I stopped turning off the sound on my computer games during\noffice hours. There’d be some student waiting outside for feedback on his\nassignment and I was like, ‘Wait, just let me finish killing this dwarf and\nI’ll get back to you.’ ”\n\n—academic friend (name withheld for obvious reasons)\n\nThe fact that modern science is to some degree founded on spiritual\ncommitments, of course, in no way implies that its findings are not true. But\nI think it does suggest that we might do well to step back and think very\ncarefully the moment whenever someone claims to be trying to create a more\nrational social order (especially, when they could have just as easily\ndescribed that social order as reasonable, more decent, less violent, or more\njust.)\n\nWe have seen how the European Middle Ages produced the vision of a virtual\ncelestial bureaucracy, based distantly on that of ancient\nRome,[144](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn144) which was seen as the\nembodiment of cosmic rationality, in a time when real bureaucracy was\nparticularly thin on the ground. Over time, of course, it grew considerably\nless so. But as new bureaucratic states did emerge, and particularly as\nbureaucratic rationality became the predominant principle of governance in\neighteenth and nineteenth century Europe and America, we witness a kind of\ncountermovement: the rise of an equally fantastic vision of the Middle Ages,\nfull of princes, knights, faeries, dragons, sorcerers, and unicorns; and\neventually, hobbits, dwarves, and orcs. In most important ways, this world is\nexplicitly antibureaucratic: that is, it evinces an explicit rejection of\nvirtually all the core values of bureaucracy.\n\nIn the last essay, I observed that science fiction has come to assemble a\nfairly standardized list of future inventions—from teleportation to warp\ndrive—and to deploy them so regularly—not just in literature but in games, TV\nshows, comics, and similar material—such that pretty much any teenager in\nCanada, Norway, or Japan can be expected to know what they are. The same could\nbe said of the basic constituents of this fantasy literature, which, though\nobviously varying from text to text, movie to movie, nonetheless center on a\nremarkably consistent basic set of character types, systems of government\n(mostly magical), technologies, beasts, and cultural traditions. Needless to\nsay it bears almost no resemblance, on any level, to what the Middle Ages were\nreally like. But to understand the real historical origins of this world\nrequires going much further back in time.\n\nWe are used to speaking of “the state” as a single entity but actually, I\nthink, modern states are better seen as the confluence of three different\nelements, whose historical origins are quite distinct, have no intrinsic\nrelation with one another, and may already be in the process of finally\ndrifting apart.\n\nI will call these sovereignty, administration, and politics.\n\nSovereignty is usually taken to be the defining feature of the state: a\nsovereign state is one whose ruler claims a monopoly over the legitimate use\nof violence within a given territory. Most governments in the ancient world,\nor for that matter the Middle Ages, never claimed sovereignty in this sense.\nNor would it have occurred to them to do so: this was the logic of conquering\nempires, not of any sort of civilized community.\n\nThe second principle is administration, which can and often does exist without\nany single center of power to enforce its decisions. It could also, of course,\nsimply be referred to as bureaucracy. In fact, the most recent archeological\nevidence from Mesopotamia indicates that bureaucratic techniques emerged not\njust before sovereign states, but even before the existence of the first\ncities. They were not invented to manage scale, as ways of organizing\nsocieties that became too big for face-to-face interaction. Rather, they seem\nto have been what encouraged people to assemble in such large communities to\nbegin with. At least, this is what the record seems to show. The\nstandardization of products, storage, certification, record-keeping,\nredistribution, and accounting all seem to have emerged in small towns along\nthe Tigris and Euphrates and its tributaries in the fifth millennium BCE, a\nthousand years before the “urban\nrevolution.”[145](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn145) We don’t really know how\nor why; we don’t even know whether there were actual bureaucrats (in the sense\nof a distinct class of trained officeholders) or whether we are simply talking\nabout the emergence of bureaucratic techniques. But by the time historical\nrecords do kick in there certainly are: we find vast temple and palace\ncomplexes with a hierarchy of trained scribes carefully registering and\nallocating resources of every sort.\n\nWe can refer to the third principle as “politics” if one takes that word in\nwhat might be termed its maximal sense. Obviously, there is a minimal sense in\nwhich anything people do can be said to have a political aspect, insofar it\ninvolves jockeying for power. But there are only some social systems in which\npolitics in this sense becomes a spectator sport in its own right: where\npowerful figures engage in constant public contests with one another as a way\nof rallying followers and gathering support. We now think of this as an aspect\nof democratic systems of government, but for most of human history, it was\nseen as more of an aristocratic phenomenon. One need only think of the heroes\nof Homeric, or for that matter Germanic or Celtic or Hindu epics, who are\nconstantly engaged in boasting, dueling, vying to organize the most splendid\nfeasts or most magnificent sacrifices, or to outdo one another with the giving\nof extravagant gifts.[146](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn146) Such “heroic”\nsocial orders, as they’ve been called, represent the quintessence of the\npolitical. They recognize no principle of sovereignty, but create no system of\nadministration either; sometimes there is a high king but usually he has very\nlimited power, or is a pure figurehead; real power fluctuates continually as\ncharismatic aristocrats assemble bands of followers, the most successful\npoaching off their rivals’ retinues, while others crash magnificently, or\ndecline into brooding obscurity.\n\nPolitics in this sense has always been an essentially aristocratic phenomenon.\n(There is a reason why the U.S. Senate, for example, is inhabited entirely by\nmillionaires.) This is why for most of European history, elections were\nassumed to be not a democratic, but an aristocratic mode of selecting public\nofficials. “Aristocracy” after all literally means “rule by the best,” and\nelections were seen as meaning that the only role of ordinary citizens was to\ndecide which, among the “best” citizens, was to be considered best of all, in\nmuch the same way as a Homeric retainer, or for that matter, a Mongol horseman\nmight switch allegiance to some new charismatic war-leader. (The democratic\nway of selecting officials, at least from Greek times onwards, was in contrast\nassumed to be sortition, whereby ordinary citizens were chosen for posts by\nrandom lottery.)\n\nWhat does all this have to do with dragons and wizards? Quite a lot, actually.\nBecause all evidence we have suggests that such heroic orders did not just\nemerge spontaneously, alongside bureaucratic societies; they emerged in a kind\nof symbiotic rivalry with them; and they were remembered long after because\nthey embodied a rejection of everything bureaucracy was supposed to be about.\n\nHere again I must return to archeology, and particularly to the work of my\nfriend David Wengrow on the ancient Middle\nEast.[147](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn147) The actual origins of what I’m\ncalling “heroic societies” seem to lie on the hills, mountains, deserts, or\nsteppes on the fringes of the great commercial-bureaucratic societies of\nMesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley, and then, later, empires like Rome,\nPersia, or China. Economically, these societies were in many ways linked to\nthe urban centers. They tended to supply the cities with raw materials, and to\nimport all sorts of fabulous wealth and treasures from urban workshops.\nHowever, from quite early on, both sides also came to define themselves as\neverything the other one was not. Urbanites came to define civilization as not\nacting like a barbarian; the barbarians, in turn, ended up creating social\norders that took the key values of commercial-bureaucratic civilization and\nturned them precisely on their heads. Where one created and treasured literary\nmasterworks, the other rejected the use of writing, but celebrated bards who\ncould extemporize works of epic verse afresh each time. Where one carefully\nstored and registered items of material value, the other sponsored vast\npotlatch-like festivals in which priceless treasures were either distributed\nto followers or rivals as a gesture of contempt towards the pretentions of\nmaterial wealth, or even abandoned, set on fire, or thrown into the sea. Where\none developed a self-effacing bureaucracy that offered predictable stability,\nthe other organized public life around charismatic egomaniacs in a never-\nending struggle for supremacy.\n\nThe original heroic societies emerged in the Bronze Age, and by the time of\nPlato, or Confucius, they must have been only very distant memories. Yet\nnonetheless, those memories remained vivid. Almost all the great literary\ntraditions begin with heroic epics that are, essentially, later fanciful\nreconstructions of what those Bronze Age heroic societies must have been like.\nWe might well ask why this happened. Why did the very sorts of people\nridiculed as ignorant barbarians by one civilization of urbanites so often\nbecome reimagined as distant heroic ancestors of a later one? Why were stories\nof their exploits told and retold, in many cases, for thousands of years?\n\nI think part of the answer is that heroic societies are, effectively, social\norders designed to generate stories. This takes us back to questions about the\nvery nature of politics. One might well argue that political action—and this\nis true even on the micro-level—is a matter of acting in a way that will\ninfluence other people at least partially by their hearing or finding out\nabout it.[148](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn148) Everyday politics—whether\nin a rural village or corporate office—has everything to do with the\nmanufacture of official narratives, rumors, and accounts. It stands to reason\nthat heroic societies, which turned political self-aggrandizement into an art\nform, would also have been organized in such a way as to become vast engines\nfor the generation of stories. Everything was turned into a platform for some\nsort of contest, some narrative of perseverance, treachery, revenge,\nimpossible challenges, epic quests, or magnificent acts of self-sacrifice.\nThis is why poets were so important. The whole point of life was to do things\nthat other people might wish to sing about. Even from the beginning, the\ninhabitants of bureaucratic societies like Egypt or Babylonia could not help\ndevelop a certain fascination with the barbarian hinterlands, which quickly\nbecame murky lands full of monsters and strange magical powers. And of course,\ndramatic stories about violent barbarians became even more compelling in ages\nwhen actual violent barbarians were no longer much around.\n\nBarbarians always exist in a symbiotic relation to bureaucratic civilization.\nOver the course of Eurasian history, the pattern recurred again and again.\nHeroic societies formed at the fringes of empire; often (like the Germanic\nsocieties that formed on the fringes of the Roman Imperium, or the Northern\nBarbarians across the Great Wall from China, or the Huns that spent time on\nthe borders of both) they would even sweep in and overwhelm those empires; in\nsuch cases, though, they would usually quickly dissolve away into\nlegend.[149](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn149)\n\nModern fantasy literature might be said to have its origins in late chivalric\nromances like Amadis of Gaul or Orlando Furioso, but the genre really takes\nrecognizable form in the Victorian Age, around the same time as the height of\npopular enthusiasm for the postal service. It is set in a very peculiar sort\nof time. In a way, this time is just a modern version of the “once upon a\ntime” of fairy tales, which was both a kind of floating, unspecified past, and\nanother dimension existing simultaneously with our own (as many stories\nconfirm, there are, still, portals between our world and fairyland, a land\nwhere time and space work entirely differently). But the temper of such\nfantasy literature is not at all the same. Fairy tales reflect a women’s and\nchildren’s perspective on Medieval and Early Modern society; their heroes are\nmore likely to be milkmaids and crafty cobblers’ sons than courtiers and\nprinces; in what has to be come to known as fantasy literature, in contrast,\nthis “once upon a time” has been transformed entirely by a massive infusion of\nheroic epic. By “fantasy literature,” here, I am referring above all to what’s\nsometimes called the “sword and sorcery” genre, whose origins lie in late\nVictorian figures like George MacDonald and Lord Dunsany, and whose most\nshining avatars remain J.R.R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, and Ursula K. Le\nGuin.[150](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn150) It’s within this tradition that\nthe standard set of characters (warrior, cleric, mage), types of spells, types\nof monstrous creature, etc., formed: a standard repertoire that recurs, in\nendless idiosyncratic variations, in hundreds if not thousands of works of\ncontemporary fiction.\n\nThese books are not just appealing because they create endless daydream\nmaterial for the inhabitants of bureaucratic societies. Above all, they appeal\nbecause they continue to provide a systematic negation of everything\nbureaucracy stands for. Just as Medieval clerics and magicians liked to\nfantasize about a radiant celestial administrative system, so do we, now,\nfantasize about the adventures of Medieval clerics and mages, existing in a\nworld in which every aspect of bureaucratic existence has been carefully\nstripped away.\n\nWhy do we do so? Well, the simplest explanation is that we are dealing with a\nform of ideological inoculation. Historically, one of the most effective ways\nfor a system of authority to tout its virtues is not to speak of them\ndirectly, but to create a particularly vivid image of their absolute\nnegation—of what it claims life would be like in the total absence of, say,\npatriarchal authority, or capitalism, or the state. As an ideological ploy,\nthe trick works best when the image is on some level, profoundly\nappealing.[151](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn151) One is first drawn in to\nthe vision of the alternative world, experiences a kind of vicarious thrill\nimagining it—only to ultimately recoil in horror at the implications of one’s\nown desires.\n\nRoman games provide an excellent example. Until the coming of the empire, most\nMediterranean cities had had some form of self-governance, with public\nassemblies debating matters of public concern. In democracies, even legal\ncases were tried by public juries consisting of hundreds of citizens. Under\nthe Empire, of course, these were stripped of all authority, and eventually\ndisappeared. Instead, the main occasion when large numbers of citizens\nassembled in public was at the Coliseum or the Circus, for chariot races or\ngladiatorial games, or to watch criminals be torn to pieces by wild animals.\nInsofar as those citizens had any experience of voting for anything, it was to\nput their thumbs up or down over the question of whether some defeated\ngladiator would be put to death.\n\nIn other words, the Empire not only justified itself largely by imposing a\nuniform system of law over its subjects, it also made a point of encouraging\nthose subjects to form organized lynch mobs (the games were often sponsored by\nthe very magistrates who presided over the courts), as if to say, “Democracy?\nNow you know where that will lead.” This was so effective that for the next\ntwo thousand years, warnings about the perils of democracy—and almost all\neducated Europeans for most of this period were staunchly opposed to\ndemocracy—insisted that “the people” in such a system would inevitably end up\nbehaving like the mob at the Roman circus: riven by violent factionalism,\ncareening irrationally between extremes of mercy and cruelty, between blindly\nfollowing charismatic idols and destroying them again. And to this day, almost\nall educated people still feel that, even if they are willing to grudgingly\naccept a few democratic elements in some aspects of society, they need to be\nkept entirely separate from the administration of justice and the law.\n\nI don’t want to leave the reader with the impression that all such\ninstitutions are simply tricks set up by the ruling classes to manipulate the\nmasses. Or that even insofar as they are, they can’t backfire. The Roman\ncircuses might have been unusually effective—they were truly one of the most\nbrilliant antidemocratic institutions ever created—but Medieval carnivals, to\ntake one famous example, with their drunken celebration of gluttony, revolt,\nand sexuality, were clearly contested ground. Its wealthier patrons no doubt\nsaw carnival as a way of warning the masses of the horrors that might ensue\nwere the hierarchical orders of society to dissolve, but it’s obvious many of\nthe common folk who were responsible for actually organizing and putting on\nthe bulk of the celebrations did not see this prospect as nearly so horrible\n(indeed, carnivals often became the occasion for actual\nrevolts).[152](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn152)\n\nNo doubt fantasy literature, too, is contested ground. Its authors themselves\nwere often unsure about the political implications of their work. J.R.R.\nTolkien for example once remarked that politically, he was either an\nanarchist, or an “unconstitutional” monarchist—it seems he could never make up\nhis mind quite which.[153](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn153) The one thing\nboth positions have in common of course is that they are both profoundly\nantibureaucratic. This is true of almost all fantasy literature: only evil\npeople maintain systems of administration. In fact, one could survey the key\nfeatures of fantasy literature point by point and see each as a precise\nnegation of some aspect of bureaucracy:\n\n• Fantasy worlds tend to be marked by an absolute division of good and evil\n(or at best, ambiguous good and absolute evil), implying the existence of\nforces between which war is the only possible relationship. In fact, when it\ncomes to conflict with such absolute villains, even war tends to be absolute,\nunmediated by custom, etiquette, or chivalry. This is in striking contrast\neither with heroic or Medieval societies, where organized violence—an\naristocratic pastime—tended more often to resemble a ritualized game in which\nhonor was everything. The principle of absolute evil seems to exist to negate\n**the bureaucratic principle of value-free rule-bound neutrality** , the fact\nthat principles such as good and evil are utterly alien to administrative\norders of any kind. Fantasy worlds create values so absolute it is simply\nimpossible to be value-free.\n\n• The existence in fantasy universes of demi-human species—gnomes, drow,\ntrolls, and so on—which are fundamentally human, but absolutely impossible to\nintegrate under the same larger social, legal, or political order, creates a\nworld where racism is actually true. Often the language of race is directly\ninvoked: “the race of elves,” “the race of dwarves,” and so on. Even when it\nis not, these are worlds where there actually _are_ different stocks of\nhumanoid creatures who can speak, build houses, cultivate food, create art and\nrituals, that is, who look and act basically like humans, but who nonetheless\nhave profoundly different moral and intellectual qualities. This is among\nother things the absolute negation of the **bureaucratic principle of\nindifference** , that the rules are the same for everyone, that it shouldn’t\nmatter who your parents are, that everyone must be treated equally before the\nlaw. If some people are orcs and others are pixies, equal treatment is ipso\nfacto inconceivable.\n\n• Legitimate power in fantasy worlds tends to be based on pure charisma, or\nthe memory of past charisma. Aragorn never coerces anyone to follow him.\nNeither does Aslan. Or Ged. Only bad guys ever create a statelike apparatus,\nand when they do, that apparatus is one of pure coercion. What’s more,\ncharismatic authority that is not constantly renewed tends to wither and\nbecome corrupt (e.g., Denethor, Gormenghast), or develop into creepy, Gothic,\nundead forms. Since the very possibility of real, vital, charismatic authority\nis always founded on war, this means legitimate authority is itself impossible\nwithout constant physical insecurity. In other words, the political ideal of\nmodern “democratic” Republics, in which politicians constantly vie for\nfollowers, is maintained—hardly surprisingly, since as I emphasized this was\nalways the heroic/aristocratic element in such Republics anyway—but it is\nentirely divorced both from principles of sovereignty, and above all, from the\n**regularity and predictability of bureaucratic procedures, and the\nroutinization of force, which in a bureaucratic order is** **seen as\nlegitimate only insofar as it is used to uphold that principle of\nregularity**. In short, in fantasy worlds, truly legitimate figures of\nauthority are usually violent, but they don’t employ violence to enforce the\nrules.\n\n• As a corollary: in fantasy, as in heroic societies, political life is\nlargely about the creation of stories. Narratives are embedded inside\nnarratives; the storyline of a typical fantasy is often itself about the\nprocess of telling stories, interpreting stories, and creating material for\nnew ones. This is in dramatic contrast with the **mechanical nature of\nbureaucratic operations**. Administrative procedures are very much _not_ about\nthe creation of stories; in a bureaucratic setting, stories appear when\nsomething goes wrong. When things run smoothly, there’s no narrative arc of\nany sort at all.\n\n• What’s more, protagonists are endlessly engaging with riddles in ancient\nlanguages, obscure myths and prophecies, maps with runic puzzles and the like.\nBureaucratic procedures in contrast are based on a **principle of\ntransparency**. The rules are supposed to be clear, uniformly expressed, and\naccessible to all. As we all know, this is rarely actually the case. But it is\nsupposed to be true in principle. For most of us, administrative forms are at\nleast as obscure as elvish riddles that only become visible at certain phases\nof the moon. But they are not supposed to be. In fact, one of the most\ninfuriating bureaucratic tactics is to disguise information through a false\npretense of transparency: for instance, to bury a key piece of information in\na flurry of departmental emails—so many that no one could possibly read all of\nthem. When we complain that we were not informed of a new policy or\nresponsibility, the bureaucrats triumphantly produce the date (usually months\nin the past) and details of the documents where the new rules were\nlisted.[154](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn154) Compared to this, there is\ncertainly a kind of pleasure in the fantasy materials: puzzles actually are\npuzzles, they are supposed to be puzzles, and there is no officious person who\nwill show up to lecture you on how this is all perfectly transparent and\nsimple and there’s obviously something wrong with you for not having\nimmediately figured it out.\n\nAs the last example makes clear, when we discuss these constants, we are\nspeaking of a certain abstract ideal of how bureaucratic systems should work,\nnot the way they actually do. In reality, bureaucracies are rarely neutral;\nthey are almost always dominated by or favor certain privileged groups (often\nracial groups) over others; and they invariably end up giving administrators\nenormous individual personal power by producing rules so complex and\ncontradictory that they cannot possibly be followed as they stand. Yet in the\nreal world, all these departures from bureaucratic principle are experienced\nas abuses. In fantasy worlds, they are experienced as virtues.\n\nStill, those virtues are clearly intended to be fleeting. Fantasyland is a\nthrilling place to visit. Few of us would really want to live there. But if I\nam right that—whatever the authors’ intentions—such literature largely ends up\noperating in such a way as to cause readers to question the ultimate\nimplications of their own suspicions of bureaucratic existence, this is\nprecisely the point.\n\nFantasy literature then, is largely an attempt to imagine a world utterly\npurged of bureaucracy, which readers enjoy both as a form of vicarious\nescapism and as reassurance that ultimately, a boring, administered world is\nprobably preferable to any imaginable alternative.\n\nStill, bureaucracy and bureaucratic principles are not entirely absent from\nsuch worlds. They creep in from several directions.\n\nFor one thing, the old imaginary cosmic administration of the Middle Ages is\nnot entirely negated in most fantasy worlds. This is because these are almost\ninvariably worlds where, though technology is limited to the wind and water\nmill level, magic actually works. And the type of magic that appears in the\nstories tends most often to be drawn from the Western ceremonial magic\ntradition that runs from ancient theurgists like Iamblichus to Victorian mages\nlike MacGregor Mathers, full of demons invoked in magic circles, chants,\nspells, robes, talismans, scrolls, and wands. So the cosmic hierarchies, the\ncomplex logical orders of spells, orders, powers, influences, celestial\nspheres with their different powers and denominations and areas of\nadministrative responsibility: all these tend to be preserved, in one form or\nanother, as at least one hidden potential form of power within the fabric of\nthe antibureaucratic universe itself. True, in the earliest, and most\nresolutely antibureaucratic universes, sorcerers are either evil (Zukala in\n_Conan the Barbarian_ or a million similar pulp fiction villains, or even\nMichael Moorcock’s amoral Elric),[155](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn155) or,\nif they are good, the technical aspect of their art is minimized (Gandalf’s\npower seems to be an extension of his personal charisma rather than deriving\nfrom arcane knowledge of spells). But as time moved on from there to _The\nWizard of Earthsea_ to _Harry Potter_ , magic—and magical knowledge—took more\nand more a central place. And of course by the time we get to Harry Potter, we\nhave also traveled all the way from expressly heroic realms like Cimmeria or\nElfland or Hyperborea, to an antibureaucratic narrative that’s set _within_ a\nclassic bureaucratic institution: a British boarding school, in a magical\nworld that is nonetheless replete with banks, Wizard Boards, Commissions of\nEnquiry, and even prisons. In the Harry Potter books, that’s exactly the joke:\nlet’s take the most drab, stuffy, institutions responsible for the\ndisenchantment of the world, and try to concoct the most wildly enchanted\nversions of them we can possibly imagine.\n\nHow could this have happened? Well, one reason is that genres of popular\nfiction are increasingly not confined to books. (This is especially true if\nchildren or adolescents are in any way involved.) Nor do they just extend into\nmovies and television series: there are also everything from board games to\nmodels, puzzles, and action figures, multiple forms of fan literature, zines,\nfan art, video and computer games. In the case of the fantasy genre, it’s\nimpossible to understand the later direction of the literature without first\nof all understanding the rise, in the late seventies, of the role-playing game\nDungeons & Dragons, which allowed hundreds of thousands of teenagers across\nthe world to effectively improvise their own fantasy worlds and fantasy\nadventures, as if they were collectively writing the story or script of their\nown adventures in real time.\n\nD&D, as its aficionados call it, is on one level the most free-form game\nimaginable, since the characters are allowed to do absolutely anything, within\nthe confines of the world created by the Dungeon Master, with his books, maps,\nand tables and preset towns, castles, dungeons, wilderness. In many ways it’s\nactually quite anarchistic, since unlike classic war games where one commands\narmies, we have what anarchists would call an “affinity group,” a band of\nindividuals cooperating with a common purpose (a quest, or simply the desire\nto accumulate treasure and experience), with complementary abilities (fighter,\ncleric, magic-user, thief …), but no explicit chain of command. So the social\nrelations are the very opposite of impersonal bureaucratic hierarchies.\nHowever, in another sense, D&D represents the ultimate bureaucratization of\nantibureaucratic fantasy. There are catalogs for everything: types of monsters\n(stone giants, ice giants, fire giants …), each with carefully tabulated\npowers and average number of hit points (how hard it is to kill them); human\nabilities (strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution …); lists\nof spells available at different levels of capacity (magic missile, fireball,\npasswall …); types of gods or demons; effectiveness of different sorts of\narmor and weapons; even moral character (one can be lawful, neutral, or\nchaotic; good, neutral, or evil; combining these produces nine possible basic\nmoral types …). The books are distantly evocative of Medieval bestiaries and\ngrimoires. But they are largely composed of statistics. All important\nqualities can be reduced to number. It’s also true that in actual play, there\nare no rules; the books are just guidelines; the Dungeon Master can (indeed\nreally ought to) play around with them, inventing new spells, monsters, and a\nthousand variations on existing ones. Every Dungeon Master’s universe is\ndifferent. The numbers are in a sense a platform for crazy feats of the\nimagination, themselves a kind of poetic technology.\n\nStill, the introduction of numbers, the standardization of types of character,\nability, monster, treasure, spell, the concept of ability scores and hit-\npoints, had profound effects when one moved from the world of 6-, 8-, 12- and\n20-sided dice to one of digital interfaces. Computer games could turn fantasy\ninto an almost entirely bureaucratic procedure: accumulation of points, the\nraising of levels, and so on. There was a return to the command of armies.\nThis in turn set off a move in the other direction, by introducing role-\nplaying back into the computer games (Elfquest, World of Warcraft …), in a\nconstant weaving back and forth of the imperatives of poetic and bureaucratic\ntechnology. But in doing so, these games ultimately reinforce the sense that\nwe live in a universe where accounting procedures define the very fabric of\nreality, where even the most absolute negation of the administered world we’re\ncurrently trapped in can only end up being yet another version of the exact\nsame thing.\n\n**IV. The Utopia of Rules**\n\nOne reason I have seen fit to spend so much time on fantasy worlds is because\nthe topic opens up some fundamental questions about the nature of play, games,\nand freedom—all of which, I believe, lie at the core of bureaucracy’s covert\nappeal. One the one hand, a bureaucracy is anything but playful. Mechanistic\nand impersonal, it would appear to represent the negation of any possibility\nof playfulness. On the other hand, being trapped in a bureaucratic runaround\nfeels very much like being caught inside some kind of horrific game.\n\nBureaucracies create games—they’re just games that are in no sense fun. But it\nmight be useful here to think more carefully about what games really are, and\nwhat it is that makes them fun in the first place. First of all, what is the\nrelationship between play and games? We play games. So does that mean play and\ngames are really the same thing? It’s certainly true that the English language\nis somewhat unusual for even making the distinction between the two—in most\nlanguages, the same word covers both. (This is true even of most European\nlanguages, as with the French _jeu_ or German _spiele_.) But on another level\nthey seem to be opposites, as one suggests free-form creativity; the other,\nrules.\n\nThe great Dutch sociologist Johann Huizinga wrote a book called _Homo Ludens_\nthat is ostensibly a theory of play. In fact, the book makes for a very bad\ntheory of play, but it’s not at all a bad theory of\ngames.[156](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn156) According to Huizinga, games\nhave certain common features. First, they are clearly bounded in time and\nspace, and thereby framed off from ordinary life. There is a field, a board, a\nstarting pistol, a finish line. Within that time/space, certain people are\ndesignated as players. There are also rules, which define precisely what those\nplayers can and cannot do. Finally, there is always some clear idea of the\nstakes, of what the players have to do to win the game. And, critically:\nthat’s all there is. Any place, person, action, that falls outside that\nframework is extraneous; it doesn’t matter; it’s not part of the game. Another\nway to put this would be to say that games are pure rule-governed action.\n\nIt seems to me this is important, because this precisely why games are fun. In\nalmost any other aspect of human existence, all these things are ambiguous.\nThink of a family quarrel, or a workplace rivalry. Who is or is not a party to\nit, what’s fair, when it began and when it’s over, what it even means to say\nyou won—it’s all extremely difficult to say. The hardest thing of all is to\nunderstand the rules. In almost any situation we find ourselves in, there\n_are_ rules—even in casual conversation, there are tacit rules of who can\nspeak in what order, pacing, tone, deference, appropriate and inappropriate\ntopics, when you can smile, what sort of humor is allowable, what you should\nbe doing with your eyes, and a million other things besides. These rules are\nrarely explicit, and usually there are many conflicting ones that could,\npossibly, be brought to bear at any given moment. So we are always doing the\ndifficult work of negotiating between them, and trying to predict how others\nwill do the same. Games allow us our only real experience of a situation where\nall this ambiguity is swept away. Everyone knows exactly what the rules are.\nAnd not only that, people actually _do_ follow them. And by following them, it\nis even possible to win! This—along with the fact that unlike in real life,\none has submitted oneself to the rules completely voluntarily—is the source of\nthe pleasure.\n\nGames, then, are a kind of utopia of rules.\n\nThis is also how we can understand the real difference between games and play.\nTrue, one can play a game; but to speak of “play” does not necessarily imply\nthe existence of rules at all.[157](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn157) Play\ncan be purely improvisational. One could simply be playing around. In this\nsense, play in its pure form, as distinct from games, implies a pure\nexpression of creative energy. In fact, if it were possible to come up with a\nworkable definition of “play” (this is notoriously difficult) it would have to\nbe something along these lines: play can be said to be present when the free\nexpression of creative energies becomes an end in itself. It is freedom for\nits own sake. But this also makes play in a certain sense a higher-level\nconcept than games: play can create games, it can generate rules—in fact, it\ninevitably does produce at least tacit ones, since sheer random playing around\nsoon becomes boring—but therefore by definition play cannot itself be\nintrinsically rule-bound. This is all the more true when play becomes social.\nStudies of children’s play, for example, inevitably discover that children\nplaying imaginary games spend at least as much time arguing about the rules\nthan they do actually playing them. Such arguments become a form of play in\nthemselves.[158](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn158)\n\nOn one level, all this is obvious: we are just talking about the emergence of\nform. Freedom has to be in tension with something, or it’s just randomness.\nThis suggests that the absolute pure form of play, one that really is\nabsolutely untrammeled by rules of any sort (other than those it itself\ngenerates and can set aside at any instance) itself can exist only in our\nimagination, as an aspect of those divine powers that generate the cosmos.\n\nHere’s a quote from Indian philosopher of science Shiv Visvanathan:\n\nA game is a bounded, specific way of problem solving. Play is more cosmic and\nopen-ended. Gods play, but man unfortunately is a gaming individual. A game\nhas a predictable resolution, play may not. Play allows for emergence,\nnovelty, surprise.[159](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn159)\n\nAll true. But there is also something potentially terrifying about play for\njust this reason. Because this open-ended creativity is also what allows it to\nbe randomly destructive. Cats play with mice. Pulling the wings off flies is\nalso a form of play. Playful gods are rarely ones any sane person would desire\nto encounter.\n\nLet me put forth a suggestion, then.\n\nWhat ultimately lies behind the appeal of bureaucracy is fear of play.\n\nFor the social theorist, there is one obvious analogy to play as a principle\nthat generates rules, but is not itself bound by them. This is the principle\nof sovereignty. The reader will remember sovereignty was one of the three\nprinciples—along with administration and politics—that ultimately came\ntogether in our current notion of “the state.” The term “sovereignty” is\nmostly used in political theory nowadays as a synonym for “independence” or\n“autonomy”—the right of a government to do what it likes within its own\nborders—but it originally emerged from very specific European debates about\nthe power of kings. Basically, the question was: is it possible to say that\nthe supreme ruler of a kingdom is in any sense bound by its laws?\n\nThose who argued that sovereigns were not bound by those laws drew an analogy\nwith divine power. God is the creator, and ultimate enforcer, of any system of\ncosmic morality. But in order to create a system, one must be prior to it; for\nthis reason God himself cannot be bound by moral laws. This is not at all an\nunusual conclusion. In Madagascar, proverbial wisdom was quite explicit about\nthis: God was represented as both the ultimate judge—watching from on high and\npunishing transgressions—and simultaneously, as a completely arbitrary figure\ntossing lightning bolts and blasting mortals for no reason whatsoever.\nOccasional African kings tried to make themselves human embodiments of this\nabsolute principle: the most famous example was the Kabaka of the Ganda\nkingdom. When he met with English visitors who tried to impress him by\npresenting him with some new efficient English rifle, he would, in turn,\nimpress _them_ by testing the rifle out on random subjects on the street. (He\nwas also known to execute his wives for sneezing.) Yet at the same time, the\nKabaka’s legitimacy, as monarch, lay above all in his reputation for imposing\nimpartial justice in his capacity as the kingdom’s highest court judge. Again,\nthe two were seen as connected: since the King could do (or take) absolutely\nanything he wanted, he also could not be bribed, so he really had no reason\n_not_ to be impartial. The Ganda kingdom was unusual in taking the principle\nto such extremes (and it should be noted that in Africa, kings who did take\nthings this far almost invariably came to a bad end eventually), but still,\nthere is a direct line of continuity between this absolute conception of\ntranscendent sovereignty and, say, Carl Schmitt’s “Political Theology,” which\nargues that in modern states, sovereign power is ultimately the power to set\naside the laws.[160](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn160)\n\nSovereignty in this sense is ultimately identical to play as the generative\nprinciple that produces games; but if so, it is also play in its most\nterrifying, cosmic form. Some have called this the notion of “top-down” play,\na concept that seems to be most explicitly developed in Indian theology, where\nthe cosmos itself is essentially the play of the divine\nforces.[161](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn161) But as Brian Sutton-Smith\nnotes in his book _The Ambiguities of Play_ , this was the dominant view\nthroughout the ancient world, where human beings were the playthings of\ndestiny and fate; the exemplary _human_ game, in such a universe, is gambling,\nwhere we willingly submit ourselves to the random whims of the\ngods.[162](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn162)\n\nIn such a universe, freedom really is a zero-sum game. The freedom of gods or\nkings is the measure of human slavery.\n\nIt shouldn’t be hard to see where all this is going. Modern states are based\non a principle of popular sovereignty. Ultimately, the divine power of kings\nis in the hands of an entity called “the people.” In practice, though, it’s\nincreasingly unclear what popular sovereignty in that sense is even supposed\nto mean. Max Weber famously pointed out that a sovereign state’s institutional\nrepresentatives maintain a monopoly on the right of violence within the\nstate’s territory.[163](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn163) Normally, this\nviolence can only be exercised by certain duly authorized officials (soldiers,\npolice, jailers), or those authorized by such officials (airport security,\nprivate guards …), and only in a manner explicitly designated by law. But\nultimately, sovereign power really is, still, the right to brush such\nlegalities aside, or to make them up as one goes\nalong.[164](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn164) The United States might call\nitself “a country of laws, not men,” but as we have learned in recent years,\nAmerican presidents can order torture, assassinations, domestic surveillance\nprograms, even set up extra-legal zones like Guantanamo where they can treat\nprisoners pretty much any way they choose to. Even on the lowest levels, those\nwho enforce the law are not really subject to it. It’s extraordinary\ndifficult, for instance, for a police officer to do _anything_ to an American\ncitizen that would lead to that officer being convicted of a\ncrime.[165](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn165)\n\nBrian Sutton-Smith argues that in the contemporary world the older, “top-down”\nview of play, what some have called “dark play,” no longer really holds sway.\nSince the Romantic era, it has been largely replaced by a whole host of more\ncheerful bottom-up rhetorics that see play variously as subversive, or\neducational, or imaginative. No doubt all this is true. But it seems to me\nthat the older conception has not vanished\nentirely.[166](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn166) If nothing else, it is\npreserved on a political level, where every arbitrary act of power tends to\nreinforce a feeling that it’s not power, but arbitrariness—that is, freedom\nitself—that is the problem.[167](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn167)\n\nThis is, indeed, almost precisely what has happened wherever the republican\nform of government (now largely mislabeled “democracy”) has become the norm.\nThe legal order, and hence the zones where state violence is the ultimate\nenforcer of the rules, has expanded to define and regulate almost every\npossible aspect of human activity. Thus, as I’ve said earlier, we end up with\nregulations prescribing everything from where one can serve or consume\ndifferent sorts of beverages, how one can work, when one can and can’t walk\noff from work, to the size of advertisements visible from the street. The\nthreat of force invades practically every aspect of our existence, in ways\nthat would have simply been inconceivable under the rule of Elagabalus,\nGenghis Khan or Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\nI’ve already written about this invasion of regulation, and violence, into\nevery aspect of our lives. What I want to argue here is that this imperative\nultimately derives from a tacit cosmology in which the play principle (and by\nextension, creativity) is itself seen as frightening, while game-like behavior\nis celebrated as transparent and predictable, and where as a result, the\nadvance of all these rules and regulations is itself experienced as a kind of\nfreedom.\n\nThis occurs even in contexts where the threat of state violence is maximally\nfar away. A good example is the management of academic departments. As I’ve\ndiscussed, anthropologists are notoriously reluctant to turn their tools of\nanalysis on their own institutional environments, but there are exceptions,\nand one excellent one is Marilyn Strathern’s analysis of what in the UK has\ncome to be known as “audit culture.” The basic idea behind audit culture is\nthat in the absence of clear, “transparent” criteria to understand how people\nare going about their jobs, academia simply becomes a feudal system based on\narbitrary personal authority. On the surface, it’s hard to argue with this.\nWho could be against transparency? Strathern was head of the anthropology\ndepartment at Cambridge when these reforms were imposed, and in her book\n_Audit Cultures_ , she documented the actual consequences of this kind of\nbureaucratization.[168](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn168) Cambridge was in\nits own way the quintessential feudal institution, with an endless accretion\nof customs and traditions, and anthropology, though a relatively new\ndepartment, had its own traditional ways of going about everything that no one\ncould entirely articulate; indeed, that no one completely understood. But in\norder to become “transparent” to the administration, they had to start\narticulating them; in practice, what this meant was that they had to take what\nhad always been a subtle, nuanced form of procedures and turn them into an\nexplicit set of rules. In effect, they had to turn custom into a kind of board\ngame. Faced with such demands, everyone’s first impulse was just to say,\n“Well, sure, we’ll just write that for the authorities and proceed as we\nalways have.” But in practice this quickly becomes impossible, because the\nmoment any conflicts crop up, both parties will automatically appeal to the\nrule-book.\n\nSuch reforms may aim to eliminate arbitrary personal authority, but of course\nthey never actually do. Personal authority just jumps up a level, and becomes\nthe ability to set the rules aside in specific cases (a sort of miniature\nversion of sovereign power again). However, in practice, the fact that the\nreforms do not in any sense achieve their stated goals doesn’t have the effect\nof undermining their legitimacy. Instead, the effect is quite the opposite,\nsince anyone who objects to such personalized power can only do so by\ndemanding even more rules and even more “transparency.” Suddenly, freedom and\njustice really do become a matter of reducing everything to a game.\n\nIf we think about it, this sort of thing happens all the time—and even in\ncontexts that have nothing to do with arbitrary personal authority. The most\nobvious example is language. Call it the grammar-book effect. People do not\ninvent languages by writing grammars, they write grammars—at least, the first\ngrammars to be written for any given language—by observing the tacit, largely\nunconscious, rules that people seem to be applying when they speak. Yet once a\nbook exists, and especially once it is employed in schoolrooms, people feel\nthat the rules are not just descriptions of how people do talk, but\nprescriptions for how they _should_ talk.\n\nIt’s easy to observe this phenomenon in places where grammars were only\nwritten recently. In many places in the world, the first grammars and\ndictionaries were created by Christian missionaries in the nineteenth or even\ntwentieth century, intent on translating the Bible and other sacred texts into\nwhat had been unwritten languages. For instance, the first grammar for\nMalagasy, the language spoken in Madagascar, was written in the 1810s and\n’20s. Of course, language is changing all the time, so the Malagasy spoken\nlanguage—even its grammar—is in many ways quite different than it was two\nhundred years ago. However, since everyone learns the grammar in school, if\nyou point this out, people will automatically say that speakers nowadays are\nsimply making mistakes, not following the rules correctly. It never seems to\noccur to anyone—until you point it out—that had the missionaries came and\nwritten their books two hundred years later, current usages would be\nconsidered the only correct ones, and anyone speaking as they had two hundred\nyears ago would themselves be assumed to be in error.\n\nIn fact, I found this attitude made it extremely difficult to learn how to\nspeak colloquial Malagasy. Even when I hired native speakers, say, students at\nthe university, to give me lessons, they would teach me how to speak\nnineteenth-century Malagasy as it was taught in school. As my proficiency\nimproved, I began noticing that the way they talked to each other was nothing\nlike the way they were teaching me to speak. But when I asked them about\ngrammatical forms they used that weren’t in the books, they’d just shrug them\noff, and say, “Oh, that’s just slang, don’t say that.” In the end I found the\nonly way I could really learn contemporary spoken Malagasy was to tape-record\nconversations, try to transcribe them myself, and then ask friends to clarify\nevery time I came across an unfamiliar usage or expression. Nothing else would\nwork: once they had decided these grammatical forms were errors, they simply\ncould not describe them to me in grammatical terms.\n\nIn the case of the Cambridge anthropology department, the rules were made\nexplicit, and were then frozen in place, ostensibly as a way of eliminating\narbitrary, personal authority. The Malagasy attitudes towards rules of grammar\nclearly have nothing to do with a distaste for arbitrary authority, and\neverything to do with a distaste for arbitrariness itself—a distaste which\nleads to an unthinking acceptance of authority in its most formal,\ninstitutional form. After all, what is our first experience of formal, rule-\ngoverned authority if not our grade-school teachers? This is as much true in\nMadagascar as anywhere else. In fact, when I asked my friends why people\ndidn’t really speak the language described in the textbooks, the inevitable\nreply was always to the effect of “well, you know, people are lazy.” Clearly,\nthe problem was that the entire population had failed to memorize their\nlessons properly. But what they were actually denying was the legitimacy of\ncollective creativity, the free play of the system.\n\nIt’s worth thinking about language for a moment, because one thing it reveals,\nprobably better than any other example, is that there is a basic paradox in\nour very idea of freedom. On the one hand, rules are by their nature\nconstraining. Speech codes, rules of etiquette, and grammatical rules, all\nhave the effect of limiting what we can and cannot say. It is not for nothing\nthat we all have the picture of the schoolmarm rapping a child across the\nknuckles for some grammatical error as one of our primordial images of\noppression. But at the same time, if there were no shared conventions of any\nkind—no semantics, syntax, phonemics—we’d all just be babbling incoherently\nand wouldn’t be able to communicate with each other at all. Obviously in such\ncircumstances none of us would be free to do much of anything. So at some\npoint along the way, rules-as-constraining pass over into rules-as-enabling,\neven if it’s impossible to say exactly where. Freedom, then, really is the\ntension of the free play of human creativity against the rules it is\nconstantly generating. And this is what linguists always observe. There is no\nlanguage without grammar. But there is also no language in which everything,\nincluding grammar, is not constantly changing all the time.\n\nWe rarely ask ourselves why that should be. Why is it that languages always\nchange? It’s easy enough to see why we need to have common agreements on\ngrammar and vocabulary in order to be able to talk to one other. But if that’s\nall that we need language for, one would think that, once a given set of\nspeakers found a grammar and vocabulary that suited their purposes, they’d\nsimply stick with it, perhaps changing the vocabulary around if there was some\nnew thing to talk about—a new trend or invention, an imported vegetable—but\notherwise, leaving well enough alone. In fact, this never happens. We don’t\nknow of a single recorded example of a language that, over the course of, say,\na century, did not change both in sound and\nstructure.[169](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn169) This is true even of the\nlanguages of the most “traditional” societies; it happens even where elaborate\ninstitutional structures have been created—like grammar schools, or the\nAcadémie Française—to ensure that it does not. No doubt some of this is the\nresult of sheer rebelliousness (young people trying to set themselves off from\nelders, for example) but it’s hard to escape the conclusion that ultimately,\nwhat we are really confronting here is the play principle in its purest form.\nHuman beings, whether they speak Arapesh, Hopi, or Norwegian, just find it\nboring to say things the same way all the time. They’re always going to play\naround at least a little. And this playing around will always have cumulative\neffects.\n\nWhat this suggests is that people, everywhere, are prone to two completely\ncontradictory tendencies: on the one hand, a tendency to be playfully creative\njust for the sake of it; on the other, a tendency to agree with anyone who\ntells them that they really shouldn’t act that way. This latter is what makes\nthe game-ification of institutional life possible. Because if you take the\nlatter tendency to its logical conclusion, all freedom becomes arbitrariness,\nand all arbitrariness, a form of dangerous, subversive power. It is just one\nfurther step to argue that true freedom is to live in an utterly predictable\nworld that is free from freedom of this sort.\n\nLet me finish with another example from my own political experience.\n\nOver the last thirty or forty years, anti-authoritarians around the world have\nbeen working on creating new, and more effective, modes of direct\ndemocracy—ones that might operate without any need for a bureaucracy of\nviolence to enforce them. I’ve written about these efforts extensively\nelsewhere. A lot of progress has been made. But those working on such projects\noften find themselves having to deal with exactly this sort of horror of\n“arbitrary” power. Part of the work of developing new forms of consensus\nprocess, for example, is to create institutional forms that encourage, rather\nthan inhibit, improvisation and creativity. As activists sometimes put it: in\nmost circumstances, if you bring together a crowd of people, that crowd will,\nas a group, behave less intelligently, and less creatively, than any single\nmember of the crowd is likely to do if on their own. Activist decision-making\nprocess is, instead, designed to make that crowd smarter and more imaginative\nthan any individual participant.\n\nIt is indeed possible to do this, but it takes a lot of work. And the larger\nthe group, the more formal mechanisms have to be put in place. The single most\nimportant essay in this whole activist tradition is called “The Tyranny of\nStructurelessness,”[170](part0009_split_003.html#c03-ftn170) written in the\n1970s by Jo Freeman, about organizational crises that occurred in early\nfeminist consciousness-raising circles when those groups began to attain a\ncertain size. Freeman observed that such groups always started out with a kind\nof rough-and-ready anarchism, an assumption that there was no need for any\nformal, parliamentary rules-of-order type mechanisms at all. People would just\nsit down in a sisterly manner and work things out. And this was, indeed, what\nhappened at first. However, as soon as the groups grew to over, say, twenty\npeople, informal cliques invariably began to emerge, and small groups of\nfriends or allies began controlling information, setting agendas, and wielding\npower in all sorts of subtle ways. Freeman proposed a number of different\nformal mechanisms that might be employed to counteract this effect, but for\npresent purposes, the specifics don’t really matter. Suffice it to say that\nwhat is now referred to as “formal consensus process” largely emerges from the\ncrisis Freeman described, and the debate her intervention set off.\n\nWhat I do want to bring attention to is that almost everyone who is not\nemerging from an explicitly anti-authoritarian position—and no insignificant\nnumber even of those who are—completely misread Freeman’s essay, and interpret\nit not as a plea for formal mechanisms to ensure equality, but as a plea for\nmore transparent hierarchy. Leninists are notorious for this sort of thing,\nbut Liberals are just as bad. I can’t tell you how many arguments I’ve had\nabout this. They always go exactly the same way. First, Freeman’s argument\nabout the formation of cliques and invisible power structures is taken as an\nargument that any group of over twenty people will always have to have\ncliques, power structures, and people in authority. The next step is to insist\nthat if you want to minimize the power of such cliques, or any deleterious\neffects those power structures might have, the only way to do so is to\ninstitutionalize them: to take the de facto cabal and turn them into a central\ncommittee (or, since that term now has a bad history, usually they say a\ncoordinating committee, or a steering committee, or something of that sort.)\nOne needs to get power out of the shadows—to formalize the process, make up\nrules, hold elections, specify exactly what the cabal is allowed to do and\nwhat it’s not. In this way, at least, power will be made transparent and\n“accountable.” (Notice that word again. It comes from accountancy procedures.)\nIt won’t in any sense be arbitrary.\n\nFrom a practical, activist perspective, this prescription is obviously\nridiculous. It is far easier to limit the degree to which informal cliques can\nwield effective power by granting them no formal status at all, and therefore\nno legitimacy; whatever “formal accountability structures” it is imagined will\ncontain the cliques-now-turned-committees can only be far less effective in\nthis regard, not least because they end up legitimating and hence massively\nincreasing the differential access to information which allows some in\notherwise egalitarian groups to have greater power to begin with. As I pointed\nout in the first essay, structures of transparency inevitably, as I’ve\ndescribed, begin to become structures of stupidity as soon as that takes\nplace.\n\nSo say one argues this point, and the critic concedes it (which usually they\nhave to because it’s pretty much common sense). If so, the next line of\ndefense is generally aesthetic: the critic will insist it’s simply distasteful\nto have structures of real power that are not recognized and that can, even if\nthey entirely lack any degree of violent enforcement, be considered arbitrary.\nUsually, one’s interlocutor won’t go so far as actually admitting their\nobjections are aesthetic. Usually they will frame their arguments in moral\nterms. But occasionally, you will find some honest enough to admit that’s\nwhat’s going on. I well remember having an Occupy Wall Street-sponsored debate\nin Central Park (I’m sure it’s recorded somewhere) with Norman Finkelstein—a\nbrilliant and altogether admirable activist, who had come of age with the\nCivil Rights Movement and still saw groups like the Southern Christian\nLeadership Conference as his inspiration. At this debate, Finkelstein stated\nthe matter outright. Maybe it’s true, he admitted, that the best way to keep\nsuch cliques from attaining too much power is to maintain a principle that\nthey should not exist. But as long as such cliques are allowed to exist\nwithout being formally acknowledged and regulated, you’re maintaining a system\nthat says it’s okay to be governed, even a tiny bit, from the shadows. It\nmight not be that much of a practical problem. You might well be right that\nformally recognizing their existence might actually end up creating less\noverall freedom than leaving well enough alone. But in the final analysis, I\njust find the idea of being governed from the shadows, in any sense,\ndistasteful.\n\nIn such arguments, we are witnessing a direct clash between two different\nforms of materialized utopianism: on the one hand, an anti-authoritarianism\nthat, in its emphasis on creative synthesis and improvisation, sees freedom\nbasically in terms of play, and on the other, a tacit republicanism that sees\nfreedom ultimately as the ability to reduce all forms of power to a set of\nclear and transparent rules.\n\nFor the last two hundred years, in Europe and North America—and increasingly,\nelsewhere—that latter, bureaucratized notion of freedom has tended to hold\nsway. New institutional arrangements that operate by rules so strict and\npredictable they essentially disappear, so that one doesn’t even know what\nthey are (such as the physical or electronic post offices with which I began)\ntend to be put forward as platforms for human freedom that emerge from the\nvery technical contingencies of running efficient structures of power. These\narrangements seem to preserve the positive elements of play while somehow\ncircumventing its more disturbing potentials.\n\nBut time and again, we have seen the same results. Whether motivated by a\nfaith in “rationality” or a fear of arbitrary power, the end result of this\nbureaucratized notion of freedom is to move toward the dream of a world where\nplay has been limited entirely—or, at best, boxed away in some remote location\nfar from any serious, consequential human endeavor—while every aspect of life\nis reduced to some kind of elaborate, rule-bound game. It’s not that such a\nvision lacks appeal. Who hasn’t dreamed of a world where everyone knows the\nrules, everyone plays by the rules, and—even more—where people who play by the\nrules can actually still win? The problem is that this is just as much a\nutopian fantasy as a world of absolute free play would be. It will always\nremain a glimmering illusion that dissolves away as soon as we touch it.\n\nSuch illusions are not always bad things. One could make a case that most of\nthe greatest human accomplishments were the result of such quixotic pursuits.\nBut in this particular case, and in this larger political-economic context,\nwhere bureaucracy has been the primary means by which a tiny percentage of the\npopulation extracts wealth from the rest of us, they have created a situation\nwhere the pursuit of freedom from arbitrary power simply ends up producing\nmore arbitrary power, and as a result, regulations choke existence, armed\nguards and surveillance cameras appear everywhere, science and creativity are\nsmothered, and all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our day\ntaken up in the filling out of forms.\n\n\n# **Appendix**\n\n# **On Batman and the Problem of Constituent Power**\n\n_I am appending this piece, ostensibly about the Christopher Nolan film_ The\nDark Knight Rises— _the long version of a piece published under the title\n“Super Position” in_ The New Inquiry _in 2012—as it expands on themes of\nsovereignty and popular culture broached in the third essay in this book. In\nthat essay, I noted that there were three historically independent elements\nthat I believed came together in our notion of “the state,” which I described\nas sovereignty, bureaucracy, and (heroic) politics. My thoughts on\nsovereignty, however, were only minimally developed, so I thought it might\ninterest the reader to see some further reflections on the subject, written in\nthe same broad, discursive vein_.\n\nOn Saturday, October 1, 2011, the NYPD arrested seven hundred Occupy Wall\nStreet activists as they were attempting to march across the Brooklyn Bridge.\nMayor Bloomberg justified it on the grounds that protestors were blocking\ntraffic. Five weeks later, that same Mayor Bloomberg closed down the nearby\nQueensboro Bridge to traffic for two solid days to allow for shooting of\nChristopher Nolan’s last installment of his Batman Trilogy, _The Dark Knight\nRises_.\n\nMany remarked upon the irony.\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to see the film with some friends from Occupy—most of\nwhom had themselves been arrested on the bridge back in October. We all knew\nthe movie was basically one long piece of anti-Occupy propaganda. That didn’t\nbother us. We went to the theater hoping to have fun with that fact, in much\nthe spirit of someone who was not a racist, or a Nazi, and would go to watch a\nscreening of _Birth of a Nation_ or _Triumph of the Will_. We expected the\nmovie to be hostile, even offensive. But none of us expected it to be bad.\n\nI’d like to reflect here, for a moment, on what made the film so awful.\nBecause, oddly, it’s important. I think the understanding of a lot of\nthings—about movies, violence, police, the very nature of state power—can be\nfurthered simply by trying to unravel what, exactly, made _The Dark Knight_ so\nbad.\n\nOne issue I think we should get straight from the outset. The film really is a\npiece of anti-Occupy propaganda. Some still deny it. Christopher Nolan, the\ndirector, went on record to insist the script was written before the movement\neven started, and has claimed the famous scenes of the occupation of New York\n(“Gotham”) were really inspired by Dickens’s account of the French Revolution,\nnot by OWS itself. This strikes me as disingenuous. Everyone knows Hollywood\nscripts are rewritten continually over the course of production, often to the\npoint where they end up looking nothing like the original text; also, that\nwhen it comes to messaging, even details like where a scene is shot (“I know,\nlet’s have the cops face off with Bane’s followers right in front of the New\nYork Stock Exchange!”) or a minor change of wording (“let’s change ‘take\ncontrol of’ to ‘occupy’ ”) can make all the difference.\n\nThen there’s the fact that the villains actually do occupy Wall Street, and\nattack the Stock Exchange.\n\nWhat I’d like to argue is that it’s precisely this desire for relevance, the\nfact that the filmmakers had the courage to take on the great issues of the\nday, which ruins the movie. It’s especially sad, because the first two movies\nof the trilogy— _Batman Begins_ and _The Dark Knight_ —had moments of genuine\neloquence. By making them, Nolan demonstrated that he does have interesting\nthings to say about human psychology, and particularly, about the relation of\ncreativity and violence (it’s hard to imagine a successful action film\ndirector wouldn’t). _The Dark Knight Rises_ is even more ambitious. It dares\nto speak on a scale and grandeur appropriate to the times. But as a result, it\nstutters into incoherence.\n\nMoments like this are potentially enlightening, for one thing, because they\nprovide a kind of window, a way to think about what superhero movies, and\nsuperheroes in general, are really all about. That in turn helps us answer\nanother question: What is the reason for the sudden explosion of such movies\nto begin with—one so dramatic that it sometimes seems comic book-based movies\nare replacing sci-fi as the main form of Hollywood special effects blockbuster\nalmost as rapidly as the cop movie replaced the Western as the dominant action\ngenre in the seventies?\n\nWhy, in the process, are familiar superheroes suddenly being given complex\ninteriority: family backgrounds, emotional ambivalence, moral crises, anxiety,\nself-doubt? Or why (equally true but less remarked-on), does the very fact of\ntheir receiving a soul seem to force them to also choose some kind of explicit\npolitical orientation? One could argue that this happened first not with a\ncomic-book character, but with James Bond, who in his traditional incarnation,\nas preternatural foil of evil masterminds, was always a kind of cinematic\nversion of the same thing. _Casino Royale_ gave Bond psychological depth. And\nby the very next movie, Bond was saving indigenous communities in Bolivia from\nevil transnational water privatizers.\n\nSpiderman, too, broke left, just as Batman broke right. In a way this makes\nsense. Superheroes are a product of their historical origins. Superman is a\nDepression-era displaced Iowa farm boy; Batman, the billionaire playboy, is a\nscion of the militaryindustrial complex that was created, just as he was, at\nthe beginning of World War II; Peter Parker, a product of the sixties, is a\nsmartass working-class kid from Queens who got something weird shot into his\nveins. But again, in the latest movie, the subtext became surprisingly\nexplicit (“you’re not a vigilante,” says the police commander, “you’re an\nanarchist!”): particularly in the climax, where Spiderman, wounded by a police\nbullet, is rescued by an outbreak of working-class solidarity as dozens of\ncrane operators across Manhattan defy city orders and mobilize to help him.\nNolan’s movie was the most politically ambitious, but it also falls the most\nobviously flat. Is this because the superhero genre does not lend itself to a\nright-wing message?\n\nCertainly, this is not the conclusion cultural critics have tended to come to\nin the past.\n\nWhat, then, can we say about the politics of the superhero genre? It seems\nreasonable to start by looking at the comic books, since this is where\neverything else (the TV shows, cartoon series, blockbuster movies) ultimately\ncame from. Comic-book superheroes were originally a mid-century phenomenon and\nlike all mid-century pop culture phenomena, they are essentially Freudian.\nThat is to say, insofar as a work of popular fiction had anything to say about\nhuman nature, or human motivations, a certain pop Freudianism is what one\nwould expect. Sometimes this even becomes explicit, as in _Forbidden Planet_ ,\nwith its “monsters from the Id.” Usually, it’s just subtext.\n\nUmberto Eco once remarked that comic book stories already operate a little bit\nlike dreams; the same basic plot is repeated, obsessive-compulsively, over and\nover; nothing changes, even as the backdrop for the stories shifts from Great\nDepression to World War II to postwar prosperity, the heroes—whether Superman,\nWonder Woman, the Green Hornet, or Dr. Strange—seem to remain in an eternal\npresent, never aging, always fundamentally the same. The basic plot takes the\nfollowing form: a bad guy—maybe a crime boss, more often a powerful\nsupervillain—embarks on a project of world conquest, destruction, theft,\nextortion, or revenge. The hero is alerted to the danger and figures out\nwhat’s happening. After trials and dilemmas, at the last possible minute, the\nhero foils the villain’s plans. The world is returned to normal until the next\nepisode when the exact same thing happens once again.\n\nIt doesn’t take a genius to figure out what’s going on here. The heroes are\npurely reactionary. By this I mean “reactionary” in the literal sense: they\nsimply react to things; they have no projects of their own. (Or to be more\nprecise, _as heroes_ they have no projects of their own. As Clark Kent,\nSuperman may be constantly trying, and failing, to get into Lois Lane’s pants.\nAs Superman, he is purely reactive.) In fact, superheroes seem almost utterly\nlacking in imagination. Bruce Wayne, with all the money in the world, can’t\nseem to think of anything to do with it other than to design even more high-\ntech weaponry and indulge in the occasional act of charity. In the same way it\nnever seems to occur to Superman that he could easily end world hunger or\ncarve free magic cities out of mountains. Almost never do superheroes make,\ncreate, or build anything. The villains, in contrast, are relentlessly\ncreative. They are full of plans and projects and ideas. Clearly, we are\nsupposed to first, without consciously realizing it, identify with the\nvillains. After all, they’re having all the fun. Then of course we feel guilty\nfor it, reidentify with the hero, and have even more fun watching the Superego\npummel the errant Id back into submission.\n\nOf course, the moment you start arguing that there’s any message in a comic\nbook, you are likely to hear the usual objections: “But these are just cheap\nforms of entertainment! They’re no more trying to teach us anything about\nhuman nature, politics, or society than, say, a Ferris wheel.” And of course,\nto a certain degree, this is true. Pop culture does not exist in order to\nconvince anyone of anything. It exists for the sake of pleasure. Still, if you\npay close attention, one will also observe that most pop culture projects do\nalso tend to make that very pleasure into a kind of argument. Horror films\nprovide a particularly unsubtle example of how this works. The plot of a\nhorror movie is, typically, some kind of story of transgression and\npunishment—in the slasher film, perhaps the purest, most stripped-down, least\nsubtle example of the genre, you always see the same movement in the plot. As\nCarol Clover long ago noted in her magisterial _Men, Women, and Chainsaws_ ,\nthe audience is first tacitly encouraged to identify with the monster (the\ncamera literally takes the monster’s point of view) as he hacks away at the\n“bad girls,” and only later, shifting to looking through the eyes of the\nandrogynous heroine who will eventually destroy him. The plot is always a\nsimple story of transgression and punishment: the bad girls sin, they have\nsex, they fail to report a hit-and-run accident, maybe they’re just obnoxious,\nstupid teenagers; as a result, they are eviscerated. Then the virginal good\ngirl eviscerates the culprit. It’s all very Christian and moralistic. The sins\nmay be minor and the punishment utterly disproportionate, but the ultimate\nmessage is: “Of course they really deserve it; we all do; whatever our\ncivilized exterior, we are all fundamentally corrupt and evil. The proof?\nWell, look at yourself. You’re not evil? If you’re not evil, then why are you\ngetting off on watching this sadistic crap?”\n\nThis is what I mean when I say the pleasure is a form of argument.\n\nNext to this, a superhero comic book might seem pretty innocuous. And in many\nways it is. If all a comic is doing is telling a bunch of adolescent boys that\neveryone has a certain desire for chaos and mayhem, but that ultimately such\ndesires need to be controlled, the political implications would not seem to be\nparticularly dire. Especially because the message still does carry a healthy\ndose of ambivalence, just as it does with all those contemporary action-movie\nheroes who seem to spend so much of their time smashing up suburban shopping\nmalls and suchlike. Most of us would like to smash a bank or shopping mall at\nleast once in our lives. And as Bakunin put it, “the urge for destruction is\nalso a creative urge.”\n\nStill, I think there is reason to believe that at least in the case of most\ncomic-book superheroes, the mayhem does have very conservative political\nimplications. To understand why though I will have to enter into a brief\ndigression on the question of constituent power.\n\nCostumed superheroes ultimately battle criminals in the name of the law—even\nif they themselves often operate outside a strictly legal framework. But in\nthe modern state, the very status of law is a problem. This is because of a\nbasic logical paradox: no system can generate itself. Any power capable of\ncreating a system of laws cannot itself be bound by them. So law has to come\nfrom someplace else. In the Middle Ages the solution was simple: the legal\norder was created by God, a being who, as the Old Testament makes abundantly\nclear, is not bound by laws or even any recognizable system of morality\n(again, this only stands to reason: if you created morality, you can’t, by\ndefinition, be bound by it). Or if not by God directly, then by the divinely\nordained power of kings. The English, American, and French revolutionaries\nchanged all that when they created the notion of popular sovereignty—declaring\nthat the power once held by kings is now held by an entity that they called\n“the people.” This created an immediate logical problem, because “the people”\nare by definition a group of individuals united by the fact that they are, in\nfact, bound by a certain set of laws. So in what sense can they have created\nthose laws? When this question was first posed in the wake of the British,\nAmerican, and French revolutions, the answer seemed obvious: through those\nrevolutions themselves. But this created a further problem. Revolutions are\nacts of law-breaking. It is completely illegal to rise up in arms, overthrow a\ngovernment, and create a new political order. In fact, nothing could possibly\nbe more illegal. Cromwell, Jefferson, or Danton were all clearly guilty of\ntreason, according to the laws under which they grew up, just as much as they\nwould have been had they tried to do the same thing again under the new\nregimes they created, say, twenty years later.\n\nSo laws emerge from illegal activity. This creates a fundamental incoherence\nin the very idea of modern government, which assumes that the state has a\nmonopoly of the legitimate use of violence (only the police, or prison guards,\nor duly authorized private security, have the legal right to beat you up).\nIt’s legitimate for the police to use violence because they are enforcing the\nlaw; the law is legitimate because it’s rooted in the constitution; the\nconstitution is legitimate because it comes from the people; the people\ncreated the constitution by acts of illegal violence. The obvious question,\nthen: How does one tell the difference between “the people” and a mere\nrampaging mob?\n\nThere is no obvious answer.\n\nThe response by mainstream, respectable opinion is to try to push the problem\nas far away as possible. The usual line is: the age of revolutions is over\n(except perhaps in benighted spots like Gabon, or maybe Syria); we can now\nchange the constitution, or legal standards, by legal means. This of course\nmeans that the basic structures will never change. We can witness the results\nin the United States, which continues to maintain an architecture of state,\nwith its electoral college and two party-system, that—while quite progressive\nin 1789—now makes us appear, in the eyes of the rest of the world, the\npolitical equivalent of the Amish, still driving around with horses and\nbuggies. It also means we base the legitimacy of the whole system on the\nconsent of the people despite the fact that the only people who were ever\nreally consulted on the matter lived over two hundred years ago. In America,\nat least, “the people” are all long since dead.\n\nWe’ve gone then from a situation where the power to create a legal order\nderives from God, to one where it derives from armed revolution, to one where\nit is rooted in sheer tradition—“these are the customs of our ancestors, who\nare we to doubt their wisdom?” (And of course a not insignificant number of\nAmerican politicians make clear they’d really like to give it back to God\nagain.)\n\nThis, as I say, is how these matters are considered by the mainstream. For the\nradical Left, and the authoritarian Right, the problem of constituent power is\nvery much alive, but each takes a diametrically opposite approach to the\nfundamental question of violence. The Left, chastened by the disasters of the\ntwentieth century, has largely moved away from its older celebration of\nrevolutionary violence, preferring nonviolent forms of resistance. Those who\nact in the name of something higher than the law can do so precisely because\nthey _don’t_ act like a rampaging mob. For the Right, on the other hand—and\nthis has been true since the rise of fascism in the twenties—the very idea\nthat there is something special about revolutionary violence, anything that\nmakes it different from mere criminal violence, is so much self-righteous\ntwaddle. Violence is violence. But that doesn’t mean a rampaging mob can’t be\n“the people” because violence is the real source of law and political order\nanyway. Any successful deployment of violence is, in its own way, a form of\nconstituent power. This is why, as Walter Benjamin noted, we cannot help but\nadmire the “great criminal”: because, as so many movie posters over the years\nhave put it, “he makes his own law.” After all, any criminal organization\ndoes, inevitably, begin developing its own—often quite elaborate—set of\ninternal rules and regulations. They have to, as a way of controlling what\nwould otherwise be completely random violence. But from the right-wing\nperspective, that’s all that law ever is. It is a means of controlling the\nvery violence that brings it into being, and through which it is ultimately\nenforced.\n\nThis makes it easier to understand the often otherwise surprising affinity\nbetween criminals, criminal gangs, right-wing political movements, and the\narmed representatives of the state. Ultimately, they all speak the same\nlanguage. They create their own rules on the basis of force. As a result, such\npeople typically share the same broad political sensibilities. Mussolini might\nhave wiped out the mafia, but Italian Mafiosi still idolize Mussolini. In\nAthens, nowadays, there’s active collaboration between the crime bosses in\npoor immigrant neighborhoods, fascist gangs, and the police. In fact, in this\ncase it was clearly a political strategy: faced with the prospect of popular\nuprisings against a right-wing government, the police first withdrew\nprotection from neighborhoods near the immigrant gangs, then started giving\ntacit support to the fascists (the result was the rapid rise of an overtly\nNazi party. Roughly half of Greek police were reported to have voted for the\nNazis in the last election). But this is just how far-right politics work. For\nthem, it is in that space where different violent forces operating outside of\nthe legal order (or in the case of the police, sometimes just barely inside\nit) inter-act where new forms of power, hence order, can emerge.\n\nSo what does all this have to do with costumed superheroes? Well, everything.\nBecause this is exactly the space that superheroes, and super-villains, also\ninhabit. An inherently fascist space, inhabited only by gangsters, would-be\ndictators, police, and thugs, with endlessly blurring lines between them.\nSometimes the cops are legalistic, sometimes corrupt. Sometimes the police\nthemselves slip into vigilantism. Sometimes they persecute the superhero, at\nothers they look the other way, or help. Villains and heroes occasionally team\nup. The lines of force are always shifting. If anything new were to emerge, it\ncould only be through such shifting forces. There’s nothing else, since in the\nDC and Marvel universes, God, or The People, simply doesn’t exist.\n\nInsofar as there is a potential for constituent power then, it can only come\nfrom purveyors of violence. And indeed, the supervillains and evil\nmasterminds, when they are not merely dreaming of committing the perfect crime\nor indulging in random acts of terror, are always scheming of imposing a New\nWorld Order of some kind or another. Surely, if Red Skull, Kang the Conqueror,\nor Doctor Doom ever did succeed in taking over the planet, a host of new laws\nwould be created very quickly. They wouldn’t be very nice laws. Their creator\nwould doubtless not himself feel bound by them. But one gets the feeling that\notherwise, they would be quite strictly enforced.\n\nSuperheroes resist this logic. They do not wish to conquer the world—if only\nbecause they are not monomaniacal or insane. As a result, they remain\nparasitical off the villains in the same way that police remain parasitical\noff criminals: without them, they would have no reason to exist. They remain\ndefenders of a legal and political order which itself seems to have come out\nof nowhere, and which, however faulty or degraded, _must_ be defended, because\nthe only alternative is so much worse.\n\nThey aren’t fascists. They are just ordinary, decent, super-powerful people\nwho inhabit a world in which fascism is the only political possibility.\n\nWhy, might we ask, would a form of entertainment premised on such a peculiar\nnotion of politics emerge in early- to mid-twentieth-century America, at just\naround the time that actual fascism was on the rise in Europe? Was it some\nkind of fantasy American equivalent? Not exactly. It’s more that both fascism\nand superheroes were products of a similar historical predicament: What is the\nfoundation of social order when one has exorcised the very idea of revolution?\nAnd above all, what happens to the political imagination?\n\nOne might begin here by considering who are the core audience for superhero\ncomics. Mainly, adolescent or preadolescent white boys. That is, individuals\nwho are at a point in their lives where they are likely to be both maximally\nimaginative and at least a little bit rebellious; but who are also being\ngroomed to eventually take on positions of authority and power in the world,\nto be fathers, sheriffs, small-business owners, middle managers, engineers.\nAnd what do they learn from these endless repeated dramas? Well, first off,\nthat imagination and rebellion lead to violence; second, that, like\nimagination and rebellion, violence is a lot of fun; third, that, ultimately,\nviolence must be directed back against any overflow of imagination and\nrebellion lest everything go askew. These things must be contained! This is\nwhy insofar as superheroes are allowed to be imaginative in any way, it could\nonly be extended to the design of their clothes, their cars, maybe their\nhomes, their various accessories.\n\nIt’s in this sense that the logic of the superhero plot is profoundly, deeply\nconservative. Ultimately, the division between left- and right-wing\nsensibilities turns on one’s attitude towards the imagination. For the Left,\nimagination, creativity, by extension production, the power to bring new\nthings and new social arrangements into being, is always to be celebrated. It\nis the source of all real value in the world. For the Right, it is dangerous;\nultimately, evil. The urge to create is also a destructive urge. This kind of\nsensibility was rife in the popular Freudianism of the day: where the Id was\nthe motor of the psyche, but also amoral; if really unleashed, it would lead\nto an orgy of destruction. This is also what separates conservatives from\nfascists. Both agree that the imagination unleashed can only lead to violence\nand destruction. Conservatives wish to defend us against that possibility.\nFascists wish to unleash it anyway. They aspire to be, as Hitler imagined\nhimself, great artists painting with the minds, blood, and sinews of humanity.\n\nThis means that it’s not just the mayhem that becomes the reader’s guilty\npleasure, but the very fact of having a fantasy life at all. And while it\nmight seem odd to think any artistic genre is ultimately a warning about the\ndangers of the human imagination, it would certain explain why, in the staid\nforties and fifties, everyone did seem to feel there was something vaguely\nnaughty about reading them. It also explains how in the sixties it could all\nsuddenly seem so harmless, allowing the advent of silly, campy TV superheroes\nlike the Adam West Batman series, or Saturday morning Spiderman cartoons. If\nthe message was that rebellious imagination was okay as long as it was kept\nout of politics and simply confined to consumer choices (clothes, cars,\naccessories again), this had become a message that even executive producers\ncould easily get behind.\n\n•\n\nWe can conclude: the classic comic book is ostensibly political (about madmen\ntrying to take over the world), really psychological and personal (about\novercoming the dangers of rebellious adolescence), but ultimately, political\nafter all.[171](part0009_split_004.html#app-ftn171)\n\nIf this is so, then new superhero movies are precisely the reverse. They are\nostensibly psychological and personal, really political, but ultimately,\npsychological and personal after all.\n\nThe humanization of superheroes didn’t start in the movies. It actually began\nin the eighties and nineties, within the comic book genre itself, with Frank\nMiller’s _The Dark Knight Returns_ and Alan Moore’s _Watchmen_ —a subgenre of\nwhat might be called superhero noir. At that time, superhero movies were still\nworking through the legacy of the sixties camp tradition, as in Christopher\nReeve’s _Superman_ series, or Michael Keaton’s _Batman_. Eventually, though,\nthe noir subgenre, probably always somewhat cinematic in its inspiration, came\nto Hollywood as well. One might say it reached its cinematic peak in _Batman\nBegins_ , the first of the Nolan trilogy. In that movie, Nolan essentially\nasks, “What if someone like Batman actually did exist? How would that happen?\nWhat would it actually take to make an otherwise respectable member of society\ndecide to dress up as a bat and prowl the streets in search of criminals?”\n\nUnsurprisingly, psychedelic drugs turn out to play an important role here. So\ndo severe mental health issues and bizarre religious cults.\n\nIt is curious that commentators on the movie never seem to pick up on the fact\nthat Bruce Wayne, in the Nolan films, is borderline psychotic. As himself he\nis almost completely dysfunctional, incapable of forming friendships or\nromantic attachments, uninterested in work unless it somehow reinforces his\nmorbid obsessions. The hero is so obviously crazy, and the movie so obviously\nabout his battle with his own craziness, that it’s not a problem that the\nvillains are just a series of egoappendages: Ra’s al Ghul (the bad father),\nthe Crime boss (the successful businessman), the Scarecrow (who drives the\nbusinessman insane.) There’s nothing particularly appealing about any of them.\nBut it doesn’t matter—they’re all just shards and tessera of the hero’s\nshattered mind. As a result, we don’t have to identify with the villain and\nthen recoil in self-loathing; we can just enjoy watching Bruce do that for us.\n\nThere’s also no obvious a political message.\n\nOr so it seems. But when you create a movie out of characters so dense with\nmyth and history, no director is entirely in control of his material. The\nfilmmaker’s role is largely to assemble them. In the movie, the primary\nvillain is Ra’s al Ghul, who first initiates Batman into the League of Shadows\nin a monastery in Bhutan, and only then reveals his plan to destroy Gotham to\nrid the world of its corruption. In the original comics, we learn that Ra’s al\nGhul (a character introduced, tellingly, in 1971) is in fact a Primitivist and\necoterrorist, determined to restore the balance of nature by reducing the\nearth’s human population by roughly 99 percent. The main way Nolan changed the\nstory is to make Batman begin as Ra’s al Ghul’s disciple. But in contemporary\nterms that, too, makes a sort of sense. After all, what is the media\nstereotype that immediately comes to mind—at least since the direct actions\nagainst the World Trade Organization in Seattle—when one thinks of a trust-\nfund kid who, moved by some unfathomable sense of injustice, dons black\nclothing and a mask, and takes to the streets to create violence and mayhem,\nthough always in a way calculated never to actually kill anyone? Let alone one\nwho does so inspired by the teachings of a radical guru who believes we need\nto return to the Stone Age? Nolan made his hero a Black Bloc disciple of John\nZerzan who breaks with his former mentor when he realizes what restoring Eden\nwill actually entail.\n\nIn fact, none of the villains in any of the three movies wants to rule the\nworld. They don’t wish to have power over others, or to create new rules of\nany sort. Even their henchmen are temporary expedients—they always ultimately\nplan to kill them. Nolan’s villains are always anarchists. But they’re also\nalways very peculiar anarchists, of a sort that seem to exist only in the\nfilmmaker’s imagination: anarchists who believe that human nature is\nfundamentally evil and corrupt. The Joker, the real hero of the second movie,\nmakes all of this explicit: he’s basically the Id become philosopher. The\nJoker is nameless, he has no origin other than whatever he, on any particular\noccasion, whimsically invents; it’s not even clear what his powers are or\nwhere they came from. Yet he’s inexorably powerful. The Joker is a pure force\nof self-creation, a poem written by himself; and his only purpose in life\nappears to be an obsessive need to prove to others first, that everything is\nand can only be poetry—and second, that poetry is evil.\n\nSo here we are back to the central theme of the early superhero universes: a\nprolonged reflection on the dangers of the human imagination; how the reader’s\nown desire to immerse oneself in a world driven by artistic imperatives is\nliving proof of why the imagination must always be carefully contained.\n\nThe result is a thrilling movie, with a villain both likeable—he’s just so\nobviously having fun with it—and genuinely frightening. _Batman Begins_ was\nmerely full of people talking about fear. _The Dark Knight_ actually produced\nsome. But even that movie began to fall flat the moment it touches on popular\npolitics. The People make one lame attempt to intervene in the beginning of\nwhen copycat Batmen appear all over the city, inspired by the Dark Knight’s\nexample. Of course they all die horribly and that’s the end of that. From then\non, they’re put back in their place, as Audience, who like the mob in the\nRoman amphitheater exist only to judge the protagonists’ performance: thumbs-\nup for Batman, thumbs-down for Batman, thumbs-up for the crusading DA … The\nend, when Bruce and Commissioner Gordon settle on the plan to scapegoat Batman\nand create a false myth around the martyrdom of Harvey Dent, is nothing short\nof a confession that politics is identical to the art of fiction. The Joker\nwas right. To a degree. As always, redemption lies only in the fact that the\nviolence, the deception, can be turned back upon itself.\n\nThey would have done well leave it that.\n\nThe problem with this vision of politics is that it simply isn’t true.\nPolitics is not just the art of manipulating images, backed up by violence.\nIt’s not really a duel between impresarios before an audience that will\nbelieve most anything if presented artfully enough. No doubt it must seem that\nway to extraordinarily wealthy Hollywood film directors. But between the\nshooting of the first and second movies, history intervened quite decisively\nto point out just how wrong this vision is. The economy collapsed. Not because\nof the manipulations of some secret society of warrior monks, but because a\nbunch of financial managers who, living in Nolan’s bubble world, shared his\nassumptions about the endlessness of popular manipulability, turned out to be\nwrong. There was a mass popular response. It did not take the form of a\nfrenetic search for messianic saviors, mixed with outbreaks of nihilist\nviolence;[172](part0009_split_004.html#app-ftn172) increasingly, it took the\nform of a series of real popular movements, even revolutionary movements,\ntoppling regimes in the Middle East and occupying squares everywhere from\nCleveland to Karachi, trying to create new forms of democracy.\n\nConstituent power had reappeared, and in an imaginative, radical, and\nremarkably nonviolent form. This is precisely the kind of situation a\nsuperhero universe cannot address. In Nolan’s world, something like Occupy\ncould only have been the product of some tiny group of ingenious manipulators\n(you know, people like me) who are really pursuing some secret agenda.\n\nNolan really should have left such topics alone, but apparently, he couldn’t\nhelp himself. The result is almost completely incoherent. It is, basically,\nyet another psychological drama masquerading as a political one. The plot is\nconvoluted and barely worth recounting. Bruce Wayne, dysfunctional again\nwithout his alter ego, has turned into a recluse. A rival businessman hires\nCatwoman to steal his fingerprints so he can use them to steal all his money;\nbut really the businessman is being manipulated by a gas-mask-wearing\nsupervillain mercenary named Bane. Bane is stronger than Batman but he’s\nbasically a miserable sort of person, pining with unrequited love for Ra’s al\nGhul’s daughter Talia, crippled by mistreatment in his youth in a dungeon-like\nprison where he was cast unjustly, his face invisible behind a mask he must\nwear continually so as not to collapse in agonizing pain. Insofar as the\naudience identifies with a villain like that, it can only be out of sympathy.\nNo one in her right mind would want to _be_ Bane. But presumably that’s the\npoint: a warning against the dangers of undue sympathy for the unfortunate.\nBecause Bane is also a charismatic revolutionary, who, after disposing of\nBatman, reveals the myth of Harvey Dent to be a lie, frees the denizens of\nGotham’s prisons, and releases its ever-impressionable populace to sack and\nburn the mansions of the 1 percent, and to drag their denizens before\nrevolutionary tribunals. (The Scarecrow, amusingly, reappears as Robespierre.)\nBut really he’s ultimately intending to kill them all with a nuclear bomb\nconverted from some kind of green energy project. Why? Who knows? Maybe he too\nis some kind of Primitivist ecoterrorist like Ra’s al Ghul. (He does seem to\nhave inherited the headship of the same organization.) Maybe he’s trying to\nimpress Talia by finishing her father’s work. Or maybe he’s just evil and\nthere’s no need for further explanation.\n\nConversely, why does Bane wish to lead the people in a social revolution, if\nhe’s just going to nuke them all in a few weeks anyway? Again, it’s anybody’s\nguess. He says that before you destroy someone, first you must give them hope.\nSo is the message that utopian dreams can only lead to nihilistic violence?\nPresumably something like that, but it’s singularly unconvincing, since the\nplan to kill everyone came first. The revolution was a decorative\nafterthought.\n\nIn fact, what happens to the city can only possibly make sense as a material\necho of what’s always been most important: what’s happening in Bruce Wayne’s\ntortured brain. After Batman is crippled by Bane halfway through the movie, he\nis placed in the same fetid dungeon where Bane himself was once imprisoned.\nThe prison sits at the bottom of a well, so sunlight is always taunting its\ninhabitants—but the well is impossible to climb. Bane ensures Bruce is nursed\nback to health just so he can try and fail to scale it, and thus know that\nit’s his failure that allowed his beloved Gotham to be destroyed. Only then\nwill Bane be merciful enough to kill him. This is contrived, but\npsychologically, at least, you can say it makes some kind of sense. Translated\nonto the level of a city, it makes no sense at all: why would anyone want to\ngive a population hope and then unexpectedly vaporize them? The first is\ncruel. The second is just random. And not only that, the filmmakers compound\nthe metaphor by having Bane play the same trick on the Gotham police\ndepartment, who—in a plot contrivance so idiotic it violates even the\nstandards of plausibility expected from a comic book—are almost all lured\nbeneath the city and then trapped there by well-placed bombs, except then for\nsome reason allowed to receive food and water, presumably so they too can be\ntortured by hope.\n\nOther things happen, but they’re all similar projections. This time Catwoman\ngets to play the role usually assigned to the audience, first identifying with\nBane’s revolutionary project, then, for no clearly articulated reason,\nchanging her mind and blowing him away. Batman and the Gotham police both rise\nfrom their respective dungeons and join forces to battle the evil Occupiers\noutside the Stock Exchange. In the end, Batman fakes his own death disposing\nof the bomb and Bruce ends up with Catwoman in Florence. A new phony martyr\nlegend is born and the people of Gotham are pacified. In case of further\ntrouble, we are assured there is also a potential heir to Batman, a\ndisillusioned police officer named Robin. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief\nbecause the movie is finally over.\n\nIs there supposed to be a message we can all take home from this? If there\nwas, it would seem to be something along the lines of this: “True, the system\nis corrupt, but it’s all we have, and anyway, figures of authority can be\ntrusted if they have first been chastened and endured terrible suffering.”\n(Normal police let children die on bridges. Police who’ve been buried alive\nfor a few weeks can employ violence legitimately.) “True, there is injustice\nand its victims deserve our sympathy, but keep it within reasonable limits.\nCharity is much better than addressing structural problems. That way lies\nmadness.” Because in Nolan’s universe, any attempt to address structural\nproblems, even through nonviolent civil disobedience, really _is_ a form of\nviolence; because that’s all it could possibly be. Imaginative politics are\ninherently violent, and therefore, there’s nothing inappropriate if police\nrespond by smashing apparently peaceful protestors’ heads repeatedly against\nthe concrete.\n\nAs a response to Occupy, this is nothing short of pathetic. When _The Dark\nKnight_ came out in 2008, there was much discussion over whether the whole\nthing was really a vast metaphor for the war on terror: how far is it okay for\nthe good guys (that’s us) to go adapting the bad guy’s methods? Probably the\nfilmmakers were indeed thinking of such issues, and still managed to produce a\ngood movie. But then, the war on terror actually was a battle of secret\nnetworks and manipulative spectacles. It began with a bomb and ended with an\nassassination. One can almost think of it as an attempt, on both sides, to\nactually enact a comic book version of the universe. Once real constituent\npower appeared on the scene, that universe shriveled into incoherence—even\ncame to seem ridiculous. Revolutions were sweeping the Middle East, and the\nUnited States were still spending hundreds of billions of dollars fighting a\nragtag bunch of seminary students in Afghanistan. Unfortunately for Nolan, for\nall his manipulative powers, the same thing happened to his world when even\nthe hint of real popular power arrived in New York.\n\n\n# **Notes**\n\n## **Introduction: The Iron Law of Liberalism and the Era of Total\nBureaucratization**\n\n[1.](part0004.html#itr-ftn1a) Elliot Jacques (Ann Arbor: University of\nMichigan Press, 1976).\n\n[2.](part0004.html#itr-ftn2a) Gordon Tullock (Washington, D.C.: Public Affairs\nPress, 1965).\n\n[3.](part0004.html#itr-ftn3a) Henry Jacoby (Berkeley: University of California\nPress, 1973).\n\n[4.](part0004.html#itr-ftn4a) C.

The term originally applied to\nfree-market enthusiasts, and in much of the world, it still does. In the\nUnited States, it was adopted by social democrats, and as a result, became\nanathema to the right, and free-market enthusiasts were forced to take the\nterm “libertarian,” originally interchangeable with “anarchist,” used in such\nterms as “libertarian socialist” or “libertarian communist” to mean the same\nthing.\n\n[9.](part0004.html#itr-ftn9a) In fact, Ludwig von Mises’s position is\ninherently antidemocratic: at least insofar as it tends to reject state\nsolutions of any kind, while, at the same time, opposing left-wing antistatist\npositions that propose the creation of forms of democratic self-organization\noutside it.\n\n[10.](part0004.html#itr-ftn10a) In the Durkheimian tradition this has come to\nbe known as “the non-contractual element in contract,” certainly one of the\nless catchy sociological phrases of all time.

There is a kind of game where\nsenior executives will feign surprise or even dismay when their own\nsuggestions are enacted.\n\n[16.](part0004.html#itr-ftn16a) About the only policies that can’t be referred\nto as “deregulation” are ones that aim to reverse some other policy that has\nalready been labeled “deregulation,” which means it’s important, in playing\nthe game, to have your policy labeled “deregulation” first.\n\n[17.](part0004.html#itr-ftn17a) The phenomenon I am describing is a planetary\none, but it began in the United States, and it was U.S. elites who made the\nmost aggressive efforts to export it, so it seems appropriate to begin with\nwhat happened in America.\n\n[18.](part0004.html#itr-ftn18a) In a way, the famous TV character of Archie\nBunker, an uneducated longshoreman who can afford a house in the suburbs and a\nnon-working wife, and who is bigoted, sexist, and completely supportive of the\nstatus quo that allows him such secure prosperity, is the very quintessence of\nthe corporatist age.\n\n[19.](part0004.html#itr-ftn19a) Though it is notable that it is precisely this\nsixties radical equation of communism, fascism, and the bureaucratic welfare\nstate that has been taken up by right-wing populists in America today. The\nInternet is rife with such rhetoric. One need only consider the way that\n“Obamacare” is continually equated with socialism and Nazism, often, both at\nthe same time.\n\n[20.](part0004.html#itr-ftn20a) William Lazonick has done the most work on\ndocumenting this shift, noting that it is a shift in business models—the\neffects of globalization and offshoring really only took off later, in the\nlate nineties and early 2000s. (See, for example, his “Financial Commitment\nand Economic Performance: Ownership and Control in the American Industrial\nCorporation,” _Business and Economic History_ , 2nd series, 17 [1988]: 115–28;\n“The New Economy Business Model and the Crisis of U.S. Capitalism,”\n_Capitalism and Society_ [2009], 4, 2, Article 4; or “The Financialization of\nthe U.S. Corporation: What Has Been Lost, and How It Can Be Regained,” _INET\nResearch Notes_ , 2012.) A Marxian approach to the same class realignment can\nbe found in Gérard Duménil and Dominique Lévy’s _Capital Resurgent: The Roots\nof the Neoliberal Revolution_ (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004),\nand _The Crisis of Neoliberalism_ (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,\n2013). Effectively, the investor and executive classes became the same—they\nintermarried—and careers spanning the financial and corporate management\nworlds became commonplace. Economically, according to Lazonick, the most\npernicious effect was the practice of stock buybacks. Back in the fifties and\nsixties, a corporation spending millions of dollars to purchase its own stock\nso as to raise that stock’s market value would have likely been considered\nillegal market manipulation. Since the eighties, as executives’ have\nincreasingly been paid in stock, it has become standard practice, and\nliterally trillions of dollars in corporate revenue that would in an earlier\nage have been sunk into expanding operations, hiring workers, or research,\nhave instead been redirected to Wall Street.\n\n[21.](part0004.html#itr-ftn21a) A popular code word from the eighties onwards\nwas “lifestyle liberal, fiscal conservative.” This referred to those who had\ninternalized the social values of the sixties counterculture, but had come to\nview the economy with the eyes of investors.\n\n[22.](part0004.html#itr-ftn22a) Just to be clear: this is by no means the case\nof major journalistic venues, newspapers like _The New York Times, The\nWashington Post_ , or magazines like _The New Yorker, The Atlantic_ , or\n_Harper’s_. In such institutions, a degree in journalism would probably be\ncounted as a negative. At this point, at least, it’s only true of minor\npublications. But the general trend is always towards greater credentialism in\nall fields, never less.\n\n[23.](part0004.html#itr-ftn23a)\n[www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/05/college-promise-economy-does-\nno-201451411124734124.html](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/05/college-\npromise-economy-does-no-201451411124734124.html). The cited text is in _Saving\nHigher Education in the Age of Money_ (Charlottesville: University of Virginia\nPress, 2005), p. 85. It continues, “Why do Americans think this is a good\nrequirement, or at least a necessary one? Because they think so. We’ve left\nthe realm of reason and entered that of faith and mass conformity.”\n\n[24.](part0004.html#itr-ftn24a) This was certainly my own personal experience.\nAs one of the few students of working-class origins in my own graduate\nprogram, I watched in dismay as professors first explained to me that they\nconsidered me the best student in my class—even, perhaps, in the\ndepartment—and then threw up their hands claiming there was nothing that could\nbe done as I languished with minimal support—or during many years none at all,\nworking multiple jobs, as students whose parents were doctors, lawyers, and\nprofessors seemed to automatically mop up all the grants, fellowships, and\nstudent funding.\n\n[25.](part0004.html#itr-ftn25a) Loans directly from the government are not\navailable for continuing education, so borrowers are forced to take private\nloans with much higher interest rates.\n\n[26.](part0004.html#itr-ftn26a) A friend gives me the example of master’s\ndegrees in library science, which are now required for all public library\njobs, despite the fact that the yearlong course of study generally provides no\nessential information that couldn’t be obtained by a week or two of on-the-job\ntraining. The main result is to ensure that for the first decade or two of a\nnew librarian’s career, 20 to 30 percent of his or her income is redirected to\nrepaying loans—in the case of my friend, $1,000 a month, about half of which\ngoes to the university (principal) and half to the loan provider (interest).\n\n[27.](part0004.html#itr-ftn27a) This logic of complicity can extend to the\nmost unlikely organizations. One of the premiere left journals in America has,\nas editor in chief, a billionaire who basically bought herself the position.\nThe first criterion for advancement in the organization is of course\nwillingness to pretend there is some reason, other than money, for her to have\nthe job.\n\n[28.](part0004.html#itr-ftn28a) I outlined what happened in an essay called\n“The Shock of Victory.” Obviously, the planetary bureaucracy remained in\nplace, but policies like IMF-imposed structural adjustment ended, and\nArgentina’s writing down of its loans in 2002, under intense pressure from\nsocial movements, set off a chain of events that effectively ended the Third\nWorld debt crisis.\n\n[29.](part0004.html#itr-ftn29a) The League of Nations and the UN up until the\nseventies were basically talking-shops.\n\n[30.](part0004.html#itr-ftn30a) In England, for instance, the anti–Corn Law\nlegislation eliminating British tariff protections, which is seen as\ninitiating the liberal age, was introduced by Conservative Prime Minister Sir\nRobert Peel, mainly famous for having created the first British police force.\n\n[31.](part0004.html#itr-ftn31a) I was reminded of this a few years ago by none\nother than Julian Assange, when a number of Occupy activists appeared on his\nTV show _The World Tomorrow_. Aware that many of us were anarchists, he asked\nus what he considered a challenging question: say you have a camp, and there\nare some people playing the drums all night and keeping everyone awake, and\nthey won’t stop, what do you propose to do about it? The implication is that\npolice, or something like them—some impersonal force willing to threaten\nviolence—were simply necessary in such conditions. He was referring to a real\nincident—there had been some annoying drummers in Zuccotti Park. But in fact,\nthe occupiers who didn’t like the music simply negotiated a compromise with\nthem where they would only drum during certain hours. No threats of violent\nforce were necessary. This brings home the fact that, for the overwhelming\nmajority of humans who have lived in human history, there has simply been\nnothing remotely like police to call under such circumstances. Yet they worked\nsomething out. One seeks in vain for Mesopotamian or Chinese or ancient\nPeruvian accounts of urban dwellers driven mad by neighbors’ raucous parties.\n\n[32.](part0004.html#itr-ftn32a) It is possible that there could be market\nrelations that might not work this way. While impersonal markets have been\nthroughout most of history the creation of states, mostly organized to support\nmilitary operations, there have been periods where states and markets have\ndrifted apart. Many of the ideas of Adam Smith and other Enlightenment market\nproponents seem to derive from one such, in the Islamic world of the Middle\nAges, where sharia courts allowed commercial contracts to be enforced without\ndirect government intervention, but only through merchants’ reputation (and\nhence creditworthiness). Any such market will in many key ways operate very\ndifferently from those we are used to: for instance, market activity was seen\nas much more about cooperation than competition (see _Debt: The First 5,00\nYears_ [Brooklyn: Melville House, 2011], pp. 271–82). Christendom had a very\ndifferent tradition where commerce was always more entangled in war, and\npurely competitive behavior, especially in the absence of prior social ties,\nrequires, pretty much of necessity, something like police to guarantee people\nkeep to the rules.\n\n[33.](part0004.html#itr-ftn33a) There is some possibility this has begun to\nturn around somewhat in recent years. But it has been my own experience that\npretty much any time I presented a paper that assumed that some form of social\ncontrol is ultimately made possible by the state’s monopoly of violence, I\nwould be instantly faced with someone challenging me on Foucauldian,\nGramscian, or Althusserian grounds that such an analysis is foolishly\noutdated: either because “disciplinary systems” no longer work that way, or\nbecause we have now realized they never did.\n\n[34.](part0004.html#itr-ftn34a)  _The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln_ ,\nvol. 5. Roy P. Basler, ed. (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press), p.\n52. Anthropologist Dimitra Doukas provides a good historical overview of how\nthis transformation worked itself out in small-town upstate New York in\n_Worked Over: The Corporate Sabotage of an American Community_ (Ithaca, NY:\nCornell University Press, 2003). See also E. Paul Durrenberger and Dimitra\nDoukas, “Gospel of Wealth, Gospel of Work: Counter-hegemony in the U.S.\nWorking Class” _American Anthropologist_ , Vol. 110, Issue 2 (2008), pp.\n214–25, on the ongoing conflict between the two perspectives among\ncontemporary American laborers.\n\n[35.](part0004.html#itr-ftn35a) It would be interesting to compare this\ncampaign to the similarly well-funded effort to promulgate free-market\nideologies starting in the sixties and seventies, which began with the\nestablishment of think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute. The\nlatter appears both to have come from a smaller sector of the capitalist\nclasses and to have taken much longer to achieve broad effects on popular\nopinion—though in the end it was if anything even more successful.\n\n[36.](part0004.html#itr-ftn36a) Even the Soviet bureaucracy combined a\ncelebration of labor with a long-term commitment to creating a consumer\nutopia. It should be noted that when the Reagan administration effectively\nabandoned antitrust enforcement in the eighties, they did it by shifting the\ncriteria for approval of a merger from whether it operates as a restraint of\ntrade to whether it “benefits the consumer.” The result is that the U.S.\neconomy is in most sectors, from agriculture to book sales, dominated by a few\ngiant bureaucratic monopolies or oligopolies.\n\n[37.](part0004.html#itr-ftn37a) Similarly in the Classical world, or that of\nMedieval Christianity, rationality could hardly be seen as a tool because it\nwas literally the voice of God. I will be discussing these issues in more\ndetail in the third essay.\n\n[38.](part0004.html#itr-ftn38a) Total number of civil servants employed in\nRussia in 1992: 1 million. Total number employed in 2004: 1.26 million. This\nis especially remarkable considering a lot of this time was marked by economic\nfree-fall, so there was much less activity to administer.\n\n[39.](part0004.html#itr-ftn39a) The logic is analogous to Marxian notions of\nfetishism, where human creations seem to take life, and control their creators\nrather than the other way around. It is probably best considered a subspecies\nof the same phenomenon.\n\n\n## 1\\. Dead Zones of the Imagination: An Essay on Structural Stupidity\n\n[40.](part0005.html#c01-ftn40a) This particular tactic is so common that I\nthink there should be a name for it. I propose to call it the “one more word\nout of you and the kitten gets it!” move. If you complain about a bureaucratic\nproblem, make it clear that the only result will to get some underling in\ntrouble—whether or not that underling had anything to do with creating the\ninitial problem. The complainer will then, unless unusually vindictive and\ncruel, almost immediately withdraw the complaint. In this case, someone did\nforget to tell me a key piece of information, but I have had the same move\nused when complaining about matters where the problem was clearly the fault of\nthe very supervisor I was complaining to.\n\n[41.](part0005.html#c01-ftn41a) For example: “We expect everyone to work as\nhard as possible for the common good without expectation of reward! And if you\nare not capable of living up to such standards, clearly you are a\ncounterrevolutionary bourgeois individualist parasite, and we’ll have to send\nyou to a gulag.”\n\n[42.](part0005.html#c01-ftn42a) Insofar as anthropological studies of\nbureaucracy do exist—the classic here is Herzfeld’s _The Social Production of\nIndifference: Exploring the Symbolic Roots of Western Bureaucracy_ (New York:\nBerg, 1992)—they almost never describe such arrangements as foolish or\nidiotic. If it does come up at all, the “bureaucracy as idiocy” perspective\ntends to be attributed to one’s informants, represented as the naïve folk\nmodel, whose existence the anthropologist must explain. Why do Greek\nvillagers, or Mozambiquan shopkeepers, they ask, make so many jokes about\nlocal officials in which those officials are represented as clueless idiots?\nThe one answer never considered is that the villagers and shopkeepers are\nsimply describing reality.  \nI suppose I should be careful here. I am not saying that anthropologists, and\nother social scientists, are entirely unaware that immersion in bureaucratic\ncodes and regulations does, in fact, regularly cause people to act in ways\nthat in any other context would be considered idiotic. Just about anyone is\naware from personal experiences that they do. Yet for the purposes of cultural\nanalysis, obvious truths are uninteresting. At best one can expect a “yes, but\n…”—with the assumption that the “but” introduces everything that’s really\nimportant.\n\n[43.](part0005.html#c01-ftn43a) To some degree this is in open defiance of the\nway the institution constantly encourages them to see the world: I recently\nhad to fill out an online “time allocation report” for my university. There\nwere about thirty categories of admin, but no category for “writing books.”\n\n[44.](part0005.html#c01-ftn44a) “Never” is no doubt an overstatement. There\nare a handful of exceptions. A very small handful. In anthropology Marilyn\nStrathern’s excellent _Audit Cultures: Anthropological Studies in\nAccountability_ , _Ethics and the Academy_ (London, Routledge, 2000) is the\nmost notable.\n\n[45.](part0005.html#c01-ftn45a) Talcott Parsons & Edward A. Shils, eds.,\n_Toward a General Theory of Action_ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,\n1951).\n\n[46.](part0005.html#c01-ftn46a) Eric Ross, “Cold Warriors Without Weapons.”\n_Identities_ 1998 vol. 4 (3–4): 475–506. Just to give a sense of the\nconnections here, at Harvard, Geertz was a student of Clyde Kluckhohn, who was\nnot only “an important conduit for CIA area studies funds” (Ross, 1998) but\nhad contributed the section on anthropology to Parsons and Shils’s famous\nWeberian manifesto for the social sciences, _Toward a General Theory of\nAction_ (1951). Kluckhohn connected Geertz to MIT’s Center for International\nStudies, then directed by the former CIA Director of Economic Research, which\nin turn convinced him to work on development in Indonesia.\n\n[47.](part0005.html#c01-ftn47a) It is interesting to note here that Foucault\nwas himself a relatively obscure figure in France, prior to ’68, a one-time\narch-structuralist who had spent many of his years in exile in Norway, Poland,\nand Tunisia. After the insurrection, he was, effectively, whisked out of\nTunisia and offered the most prestigious position Paris has to offer, a\nprofessorship at the College de France.\n\n[48.](part0005.html#c01-ftn48a) In anthropology, see for instance Nancy\nScheper-Hughes, _Death Without Weeping: The Violence of Everyday Life in\nBrazil_ (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992); Carolyn Nordstrom\nand Joann Martin, _The Paths to Domination, Resistance, and Terror_ (Berkeley:\nUniversity of California Press, 1992).\n\n[49.](part0005.html#c01-ftn49a) The term itself traces back to debates within\nPeace Studies in the 1960s; it was coined by Johann Galtung (“Violence, Peace,\nand Peace Research.” _Journal of Peace Research_ 1969 vol. 6:167–91; _Peace:\nResearch, Education, Action, Essays in Peace Research_ [Copenhagen: Christian\nEjlers, Vol. 1, 1982]; Peter Lawler, _A Question of Values: Johann Galtung’s\nPeace Research_ [Boulder, CO, Lynne Rienner, 1995]), to meet the charge that\nto define “peace” as the mere absence of acts of physical assault is to\noverlook the prevalence of much more insidious structures of human\nexploitation. Galtung felt the term “exploitation” was too loaded owing to its\nidentification with Marxism, and proposed as an alternative “structural\nviolence”: any institutional arrangement that, by its very operation,\nregularly causes physical or psychological harm to a certain portion of the\npopulation, or imposes limits on their freedom. Structural violence could thus\nbe distinguished from both “personal violence” (violence by an identifiable\nhuman agent), or “cultural violence” (those beliefs and assumptions about the\nworld that justify the infliction of harm). This is the how the term has\nmainly been taken up in the anthropological literature as well (e.g., Philippe\nBourgois, “The Power of Violence in War and Peace: Post–Cold War Lessons from\nEl Salvador.” _Ethnography_ 2001 vol. 2 [1]: 5–34; Paul Farmer, “An\nAnthropology of Structural Violence.” _Current Anthropology_ 2004 vol. 45\n[3]:305–25; _Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on\nthe Poor_ [Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005]; Arun Gupta, _Red\nTape: Bureaucracy, Structural Violence, and Poverty in India_ [Durham, NC:\nDuke University Press, 2012]).\n\n[50.](part0005.html#c01-ftn50a) Given the world as it actually exists, this\nclearly makes no sense. If, say, there are certain spaces women are excluded\nfrom for fear of physical or sexual assault, one cannot make a distinction\nbetween that fear, the assumptions that motivate men to carry out such\nassaults or police to feel the victim “had it coming,” or the resultant\nfeeling on the part of most women that these are not the kind of spaces women\nreally ought to be in. Nor can one distinguish these factors, in turn, from\nthe “economic” consequences of women who cannot be hired for certain jobs as a\nresult. All of this constitutes a single structure of violence.  \nThe ultimate problem with Johann Galtung’s approach, as Catia Confortini notes\n(“Galtung, Violence, and Gender: The Case for a Peace Studies/Feminism\nAlliance.” _Peace and Change_ 2006 vol. 31 [3]:333–67), is that it views\n“structures” as abstract, free-floating entities, when what we are really\nreferring to here are material _processes_ , in which violence, and the threat\nof violence, play a crucial, constitutive, role. In fact one could argue it’s\nthis very tendency towards abstraction that makes it possible for everyone\ninvolved to imagine that the violence upholding the system is somehow not\nresponsible for its violent effects.\n\n[51.](part0005.html#c01-ftn51a) It is true that slavery is often framed as a\nmoral relation (the master takes a paternal interest in the slaves’ spiritual\nwelfare, that sort of thing), but as many have observed, such pretenses are\nnever really believed by either masters or slaves; in fact, the ability to\nforce the slaves to play along with such an obviously false ideology is itself\na way of establishing the master’s pure, arbitrary power.\n\n[52.](part0005.html#c01-ftn52a) Keith Breckenridge, “Power Without Knowledge:\nThree Colonialisms in South Africa.”\n(www.history.und.ac.za/Sempapers/Breckenridge2003.pdf)\n\n[53.](part0005.html#c01-ftn53a) Keith Breckenridge, “Verwoerd’s Bureau of\nProof: Total Information in the Making of Apartheid.” _History Workshop\nJournal_ 1985, vol. 59:84.\n\n[54.](part0005.html#c01-ftn54a) Andrew Mathews, “Power/Knowledge,\nPower/Ignorance: Forest Fires and the State in Mexico.” _Human Ecology_ 2005,\nvol. 33(6): 795–820; _Instituting Nature: Authority, Expertise, and Power in\nMexican Forests, 1926–2011_ (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2011).\n\n[55.](part0005.html#c01-ftn55a) David Apter, _The Politics of Modernization_\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965); _Choice and the Politics of\nAllocation: A Developmental Theory_ (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1971).\n\n[56.](part0005.html#c01-ftn56a) “Violent actions, no less than any other kind\nof behavioral expression, are deeply infused with cultural meaning and are the\nmoment for individual agency within historically embedded patterns of\nbehavior. Individual agency, utilizing extant cultural forms, symbols, and\nicons, may thus be considered ‘poetic’ for the rule-governed substrate that\nunderlies it, and for how this substrate is deployed, through which new\nmeanings and forms of cultural expression emerge” (Neil Whitehead, “On the\nPoetics of Violence,” in _Violence_ , James Currey, ed. [Santa Fe, NM: SAR\nPress, 2004], pp. 9–10).\n\n[57.](part0005.html#c01-ftn57a) In criminal matters, we tend to treat pointing\na gun at someone’s head and demanding their money as a violent crime, even\nthough no actual physical contact takes place. However, most liberal\ndefinitions of violence avoid defining threats of physical harm as forms of\nviolence in themselves, because of the subversive implications. As a result\nliberals tend to define violence as acts of nonconsensual harm, and\nconservatives, acts of nonconsensual harm that have not been approved by\nlegitimate authorities—which of course makes it impossible for the state, or\nany state they approve of, anyway, to ever engage in “violence” (see C.A.J.\nCoady, “The Idea of Violence.” _Journal of Applied Philosophy_ 1986 vol. 3\n[1]:3–19; also my own _Direct Action: An Ethnography_ [Oakland: AK Press,\n2009], pp. 448–49).\n\n[58.](part0005.html#c01-ftn58a) Hopefully at this point I do not have to point\nout that patriarchal arrangements of this sort are prima facie examples of\nstructural violence, their norms sanctioned by threat of physical harm in\nendless subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\n\n[59.](part0005.html#c01-ftn59a) Since first writing this passage I have tried\nin vain to locate the essay where I first read about these experiments (I\nfirst encountered them in a magazine I looked at in the American consulate in\nAntananarivo while doing my fieldwork around the year 1990, in an article\nabout the movie _Tootsie_). Often when I tell the story, I am told that the\nreal reason teenage boys object to imagining themselves as girls is simple\nhomophobia, and this is surely true, as far as it goes. But then one has to\nask why homophobia is so powerful in the first place, and why homophobia takes\nthis particular form. After all, many teenage girls are equally homophobic,\nbut it does not seem to stop them from taking pleasure in imagining themselves\nas boys.\n\n[60.](part0005.html#c01-ftn60a) bell hooks, “Representations of Whiteness,” in\n_Black Looks: Race and Representation_ (Boston: South End Press, 1992), pp.\n165–78.\n\n[61.](part0005.html#c01-ftn61a) The key texts on Standpoint Theory, by\nPatricia Hill Collins, Donna Haraway, Sandra Harding, Nancy Hartsock and\nothers, are collected in a volume edited by Harding (_The Feminist Standpoint\nTheory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies_ [London: Routledge,\n2004]). I might add that the history of this very essay provides a telling\nexample of the sort of gendered obliviousness I’m describing. When I first\nframed the problem, I wasn’t even aware of this body of literature, though my\nargument had clearly been indirectly influenced by it—it was only the\nintervention of a feminist friend that put me on to where many of these ideas\nwere actually coming from.\n\n[62.](part0005.html#c01-ftn62a) Egon Bittner, _Aspects of Police Work_\n(Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1970); also, “The capacity to use\nforce as the core of the police role.” In _Moral Issues in Police Work_ ,\nElliston and Feldberg, eds.

This is why only a very\nsmall percentage of the population of, say, Nigeria or India or Brazil feel\nthat they are middle class, though most Danes or white Australians do. In most\nlarge cities in Europe or North America race is also a huge factor, though\noften those who face the most direct and consistent racist violence from\npolice will nonetheless insist that fighting crime is what police are\nfundamentally about.\n\n[64.](part0005.html#c01-ftn64a) I am aware this is not really what Weber said.\nEven the phrase “iron cage” is apparently a mistranslation for a phrase that\nmeant something more like “shiny metal casing”—not a drab prison but a high-\ntech wrapping superficially attractive in its own right. Nonetheless, this is\nhow Weber was understood for most of the twentieth century and in a way the\npopular understanding was more important, and certainly more influential, than\nthe author’s actual meaning.\n\n[65.](part0005.html#c01-ftn65a) Ancient Egypt in contrast created whole genres\nof literature to warn young students against adventurous occupations. They\nwould typically begin by asking whether the reader had ever dreamed of\nbecoming the captain of a ship, or a royal charioteer, then go on to describe\njust how miserable such an apparently glamorous occupation would likely really\nturn out to be. The conclusion was always the same: don’t do it! Become a\nbureaucrat. You’ll have a prosperous job and all you’ll be able to order\naround the soldiers and sailors who will treat you like a god.\n\n[66.](part0005.html#c01-ftn66a) The real joke in the Bond movies, it seems to\nme, is that Bond is a terrible spy. Spies are supposed to be discreet and\nunobtrusive. James Bond is anything but. It’s just that he can get away with\nbeing a terrible spy because he’s effortlessly, preternaturally flawless in\nthe performance of any task _other_ than spying. As for his inversions with\nHolmes, one could multiply these endlessly: Holmes has family history, Bond\nappears to be an orphan or anyway has no family ties, and further, seems to\nhave constant sex without ever producing offspring. Holmes works with one male\npartner who does well by their association; Bond with a series of female\npartners who usually die.\n\n[67.](part0005.html#c01-ftn67a) The full argument here would take much more\ntime to make, and this is not really the place for it, but note that cop\nmovies of the “rogue cop breaking all the rules” variety, that now seems the\ndefault mode for a Hollywood action movie, did not exist at all until the\n1970s. In fact for the first half-century of American cinema there were hardly\nany movies at all that took a policeman’s point of view. The rogue cop movie\nappeared at the moment the Western disappeared and is largely a transposition\nof Western plots into an urban bureaucratic setting. Clint Eastwood famously\ndefined the transition: from Sergio Leone’s _Man with No Name_ (1964, 1965,\n1966), to _Dirty Harry_ (1971). As others have observed, the Western plot is\ntypically an effort to contrive a situation where it is justifiable for a\nbasically decent person to do things that in any other situation would be\nabsolutely unjustifiable. Transposing that onto an urban bureaucratic\nenvironment has disturbing implications: indeed, one might well argue that\nJack Bauer is the logical culmination of the genre.\n\n[68.](part0005.html#c01-ftn68a) Marc Cooper, “Dum Da Dum-Dum.” _Village Voice_\nApril 16, 1991, pp. 28–33.\n\n[69.](part0005.html#c01-ftn69a) This might seem to be similar to the fate of\nliberal or right libertarian free market ideas that oppose government\ninterference but, according to what I’ve called the Iron Law of Liberalism,\nalways produce more bureaucracy anyway. But I don’t think that left-wing ideas\nalways and necessarily create bureaucracy in the same way. Indeed,\ninsurrectionary moments usually begin by eliminating existing bureaucratic\nstructures entirely, and while these structures often creep back, they only do\nwhen the revolutionaries begin to operate through government: when they manage\nto maintain autonomous enclaves like, say, the Zapatistas, this does not take\nplace.\n\n[70.](part0005.html#c01-ftn70a) I use the word “ontology” with some hesitation\nbecause as a philosophical term, it has recently undergone a great deal of\nabuse. Technically, ontology is theory about the nature of reality, as opposed\nto epistemology, which is theory about what we can know about reality. In the\nsocial sciences, “ontology” has come to be used merely as a pretentious way to\nsay “philosophy,” “ideology,” or “set of cultural assumptions,” often in ways\nthat philosophers would find outrageous. Here I am using it in the specific\nsense of “political ontology,” which admittedly is a sense I made up, but\nrefers to a set of assumptions about underlying realities. When one says\n“let’s be realistic here,” what reality is it we’re referring to? What is the\nhidden reality, the underlying forces, assumed to be moving below the surface\nof political events?\n\n[71.](part0005.html#c01-ftn71a) Even the rich and powerful will ordinarily\nconcede that the world is a miserable place for most of those who live in it,\nbut still, insist that this is inevitable, or that any attempt to change it\nwill make it worse—not that we actually live in an ideal social order.\n\n[72.](part0005.html#c01-ftn72a) Unfortunately he never did.

To my mind it would probably be better to\nrecognize it as the primary form of labor. Insofar as a clear distinction can\nbe made here, it’s the care, energy, and labor directed at human beings that\nshould be considered fundamental. The things we care about most—our loves,\npassions, rivalries, obsessions—are always other people, and in most societies\nthat are not capitalist, it’s taken for granted that the manufacture of\nmaterial goods is a subordinate moment in a larger process of fashioning\npeople. In fact, I would argue that one of the most alienating aspects of\ncapitalism is the fact that it forces us to pretend that it is the other way\naround, and that societies exist primarily to increase their output of things.\n\n[76.](part0005.html#c01-ftn76a) See my book _The Democracy Project_ (New York:\nSpiegel & Grau, 2012).

Before the success of _Future Shock_ , he had\nbeen known mainly as a business journalist, whose greatest claim to fame was\nprobably that he had interviewed Ayn Rand for _Playboy_. Like most\nconservatives, he pays lip service to women’s equality as an abstract\nprinciple, but never mentions actual feminists or feminist issues except to\ncriticize them: for a typical example, see his _Revolutionary Wealth: How It\nWill Be Created and How It Will Change Our Lives_ , Alvin Toffler and Heidi\nToffler (New York: Doubleday, 2006), pp. 132–33. It is certainly curious that\nboth Toffler and Gilder are so obsessed with the threat to motherhood: it’s as\nif both are basing their politics on an opposition to the ideas of Shulamith\nFirestone, long before Firestone herself had actually appeared on the scene.\n\n[88.](part0006_split_000.html#c02-ftn88a) Eccentric though they were, it’s\nhard to overestimate the influence of such figures on the Right, because they\nwere considered its creative visionaries. Gilder’s supply-side economic\ntheories, for instance, are widely cited as one of the main inspiration for\nReaganomics, and his “technology report” was so widely read that market\nobservers spoke of a “Gilder effect,” where the share values of any company he\nmentioned approvingly would almost invariably rise in value immediately\nthereafter.\n\n[89.](part0006_split_000.html#c02-ftn89a) Win McCormick, for instance, informs\nme that by the late sixties he was involved in a think tank founded by a\nformer president of the University of Chicago, one of whose main concerns was\ntrying to figure out how to head off the upheavals they assumed would ensue\nwithin a generation or so, when machines had completely replaced manual labor.\n\n[90.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn90a) I have no time to describe in detail\nsome of the actual political conflicts of the early seventies described in the\nunpublished _Zero Work_ volume that set the stage for the later emergence of\nthe Midnight Notes Collective, but they reveal quite clearly that in many\nassembly-line industries, wildcat strikes during that period did focus on\ndemands for replacing drudgery with mechanization, and for employers,\nabandoning factories in the unionized “Rust Belt” became a conscious strategy\nfor sidestepping such demands (e.g., Peter Linebaugh and Bruno Ramirez,\n“Crisis in the Auto Sector,” originally from _Zero Work_ , published in\n_Midnight Notes_ , 1992).\n\n[91.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn91a) The United States sometimes likes to\nmaintain the fantasy that it does not engage in industrial planning, but as\ncritics have long since pointed out, it does.

In the fifties\nand sixties, many prominent Americans, including a significant number of\nCongressmen, appear to have strongly suspected that the Soviets actually\n_were_ in contact with space aliens, and that UFOs were either Soviet allies,\nor actual Soviet craft built with borrowed alien technology (see e.g.,\nSharlet’s _Sweet Heaven When I Die: Faith, Faithlessness, and the Country In\nBetween_ [New York: Norton, 2012], pp. 146–48).\n\n[95.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn95a) As an example, in 368 pages, Judith\nBarad’s _The Ethics of Star Trek_ (New York: Perennial, 2000) does not mention\ndemocracy or issues of collective political decision-making even once.\n\n[96.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn96a) Other sentences one would never hear\nare of this sort: “Did you hear that the Vulcan-Bejoran Traditionalist\nalliance is threatening to pull their support from the ruling coalition and\nforce new elections if their candidate doesn’t get the education portfolio\nthis year?” Note too how in the absence of ideological differences, which have\nthe potential to cross-cut ethnic ones, the only political divisions one can\nreally imagine within the Federation are between species: the Andorians want\nthis, the Betazoids want that. This too resembles what happened in the USSR\nand under similar regimes, where a combination of a centralized,\nredistributive system and an insistence on ideological conformity ensured that\nethnic differences were the only ones that could find any open political\nexpression—with ultimately disastrous political effects.\n\n[97.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn97a) Though all ethnic groups seem to be\nrepresented in the Federation, I’ve always noticed one curious exception:\nJews. It’s all the more striking because both Kirk and Spock, in the original\nseries, were played by Jewish actors—the Vulcan salute, famously, is actually\nan Orthodox Jewish blessing. But one never sees a Captain Goldberg or\nLieutenant Rubinstein; as far as I’m aware not a single Jewish character has\never appeared.\n\n[98.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn98a) The sequence of events is somewhat\nhypothetical here as, as I say, the history has not been written. I am\ncertainly not suggesting Michael Moore himself sparked the debate, but rather\nthat his comments gave a flavor for what was being talked about at the time.\nThe Ferengi first appear quite early, in 1987, and the Borg even earlier, but\nthey become much more prominent as contrasting alternatives to the Federation\nlater on. All one has to do is Google (_Star Trek_ creator) “Gene Roddenberry”\nand “communist” together to get a taste of the kind of ire the issue stirred\nup in conservative circles.\n\n[99.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn99a) The term originally derives from\n“Franks,” which was the generic Arabic term for Crusader. Thus the Ferengi\nhave a curious Medieval heritage: their name is a hostile term Muslims applied\nto Christians, whom they considered barbarous, impious, and so greedy that\nthey lacked all human decency, and their physical appearance and behavior is\nan allusion to a hostile image those same Christians applied to Jews, for\nexactly the same reasons.\n\n[100.](part0006_split_001.html#c02-ftn100a) Thus for instance a recent study\nof work in the twenty-first century could begin: “Two broad developments\nreshaped work at the end of the twentieth century. The first was the implosion\nof the Soviet Union and the worldwide triumph of market capitalism. The second\nwas the widespread use of computer-based production technologies and\nmanagement command-and-control systems” (Rick Baldoz, Charles Koeber, Philip\nKraft, _The Critical Study of Work: Labor, Technology, and Global Production_\n[Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001], p. 3).\n\n[101.](part0006_split_002.html#c02-ftn101a) Its designer, Mikhail\nKalashinikov, who is still alive, recently held a press conference where he\npointed out that U.S. soldiers in Iraq regularly discard their own weapons in\nfavor of captured AK-47s when they have the opportunity.\n\n[102.](part0006_split_002.html#c02-ftn102a) And of course just counting\nuniversity staff is deceptive in itself, since it ignores the burgeoning\nnumbers of administrators employed by foundations, and other grant-giving\nagencies.\n\n[103.](part0006_split_002.html#c02-ftn103a) Similarly Don Braben, a physicist\nat University College London, made headlines in the UK by pointing out that\nAlbert Einstein would never have been able to get funding were he alive today.\nOthers have suggested most of his major works would never even have passed\npeer review.\n\n[104.](part0006_split_002.html#c02-ftn104a) Jonathan L.

But these efforts always prove, on\ninvestigation, to be largely publicity stunts. In Silicon Valley–style firms,\ninnovation is largely outsourced to start-ups. At present, the most promising\nresearch is generally conducted neither in corporate nor in directly\ngovernment-funded environments but in the nonprofit sector (which includes\nmost universities), but here too, the corporatization of institutional culture\nensures more and more time is taken up with grantsmanship.\n\n[107.](part0006_split_002.html#c02-ftn107a) David Harvie, “Commons and\nCommunities in the University: Some Notes and Some Examples,” _The Commoner_\nno. 8, Autumn/Winter 2004.\n([www.commoner.org.uk/08harvie.pdf](http://www.commoner.org.uk/08harvie.pdf))\n\n[108.](part0006_split_002.html#c02-ftn108a) We cannot know, for instance,\nwhether there really are alternative fuel formulae that have been bought up\nand placed in safes by oil companies, but it’s widely speculated that there\nare.

The quote is useful to bear in mind since I find that the\ngeneral point—that the welfare state was largely created to pay off the\nworking class for fear of their becoming revolutionaries—tends to be met with\nskepticism, and demands for proof that this was the self-conscious intention\nof the ruling class.

For me, at least, the two greatest exemplars of that earlier\nage were New York’s monumental Central Post Office, with its sweeping, block-\nlong marble steps and Corinthian columns, and the central branch of New York\nPublic Library (which, incidentally, maintained its own system of pneumatic\ntubes for sending book requests into the stacks well into the 1980s). I\nremember once, as a tourist, visiting the summer palace of the Kings of\nSweden—the first actual palace I’d ever been inside. My first reaction was:\nthis looks exactly like the New York Public Library!\n\n[126.](part0007.html#c03-ftn126a) Brooklyn: Soft Skull Press, 2005.\n\n[127.](part0007.html#c03-ftn127a) This is beautifully conveyed in the great\nfilm _The Hollywood Shuffle_ , featuring a hapless young African American hero\nwilling to endure performing any humiliating racist stereotype in order to\nmake it in the movies—as his grandmother keeps gently reminding him, “There’s\nalways work at the Post Office.”\n\n[128.](part0007.html#c03-ftn128a) This pattern actually extends to all sorts\nof movies: even if the maverick hero is a scientist, for example, the superior\nin a bureaucratic organization is almost invariably a person of color.

But this\nis just an extension of the bureaucratic mind-set.

Walter Burkert has suggested that he was really\nonly responsible for the doctrine of reincarnation, and not the mathematical\ncosmology, which has been variously attributed to later Pythagoreans such as\nHippasus, Philolaus, and Archytas, or even, made up retrospectively and\nattributed to the Pythagoreans by Plato (this latter, however, strikes me as\nunlikely).\n\n[136.](part0007.html#c03-ftn136a) There is a story that such was the political\nimportance of this doctrine that when one later Pythagorean, Hippasus,\ndiscovered the irrational number, his fellows drowned him in the sea.\nActually, the legend in Antiquity was rather that Hippasus drowned by\naccident, as punishment from the Gods for his impiety in revealing such\nmatters. Myself, I find more interesting the suggestion, in some sources, that\nHippasus held that God was an irrational number: that God, in other words,\nrepresented a transcendent principle beyond the immanent rationality of the\ncosmos. If true, it would have been a major departure from the emerging logic\nof the “cosmic religion” of Antiquity and it might not be surprising if he\nthus aroused his comrades’ antipathy. It is intriguing to consider how it\nrelates to the reflections on sovereignty detailed below.\n\n[137.](part0007.html#c03-ftn137a) Hans Joas (_The Gnostic Religion_ [Boston:\nBeacon Press, 1958]) was, to my knowledge, the first to use the term “cosmic\nreligion,” in describing Gnosticism, which rejected the notion of an ideal\ncosmic order and saw human souls as fundamentally alien to creation, as its\nexplicit negation. Augustinian Christianity actually contains elements of\nboth, bringing together a Manichean dualism with a fundamentally Pagan\ninsistence on the identity of mind and divinity.\n\n[138.](part0007.html#c03-ftn138a) It originates with the Stoics, but in\nAntiquity was not nearly so universal as it became in the European Middle\nAges.\n\n[139.](part0007.html#c03-ftn139a) Insofar as they do, it’s of course in play.\n\n[140.](part0007.html#c03-ftn140a) Edmund Leach, _Social Anthropology_ (Oxford,\nOxford University Press, 1982), p. 121.\n\n[141.](part0007.html#c03-ftn141a) It might have made better logical sense to\nsee that what set humans apart from animals lay in imagination, but in\nMedieval terms this was quite inadmissible, because in the commonplace\ntheology of the time, influenced by astrology and Neoplatonism, it\ncorresponded to a lower order—imagination was a mediator between the divine\nintellect and the material world, just as the astral plane mediates heaven and\nearth; indeed, many at the time speculated our imaginative faculties were made\nof astral substance.\n\n[142.](part0007.html#c03-ftn142a) From Francis Yates, _Giordano Bruno and the\nHermetic Tradition_ (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1964), p. 144;\noriginally from Robert Fludd, _Meteorologica cosmtca_ (Frankfort, 1626), p. 8.\n\n[143.](part0007.html#c03-ftn143a) Translation from Francis Yates, _op cit_ ,\np. 119.\n\n[144.](part0007.html#c03-ftn144a) And also, of course, on the Church hierarchy\nthat continued to be based in Rome, which did maintain the most elaborate and\ngeographically far-reaching administrative system that existed in Europe at\nthe time.\n\n[145.](part0007.html#c03-ftn145a) On proto-bureaucracy, see Hans Nissen et\nal., _Archaic Bookkeeping: Early Writing and Techniques of Economic\nAdministration in the Ancient Near East_ (Chicago/London: University of\nChicago Press, 1993); see also David Wengrow, _What Makes a Civilization?_\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 81–87.\n\n[146.](part0007.html#c03-ftn146a) Or in the anthropological record, one might\nthink of the Maori, or the First Nations of the Northwest Coast of North\nAmerica (often referred to as “potlatch societies,” which were divided into\naristocrats and commoners with no centralized system of government or\nadministration), or, for that matter, more egalitarian heroic societies like\nthe Iatmul of Papua New Guinea where all adult males were engaged in constant\nvainglorious behavior of this sort.\n\n[147.](part0007.html#c03-ftn147a) My key text here is David Wengrow’s “\n‘Archival’ and ‘Sacrificial’ Economies in Bronze Age Eurasia: An\nInteractionist Approach to the Hoarding of Metals,” in _Interweaving Worlds:\nSystemic Interactions in Eurasia, 7th to the 1st Millennia BC_ , T. C.\nWilkinson, S. Sherratt, and J. Bennet, eds. (Oxford: Oxbow, 2011), pp. 135–44.\nI discuss heroic societies myself in “Culture as Creative Refusal,” _Cambridge\nAnthropology_ vol. 31 no. 2 (2013), pp. 1–19.\n\n[148.](part0007.html#c03-ftn148a) Indeed, I have, in an earlier book, _Lost\nPeople: Magic and the Legacy of Slavery in Madagascar_ (Bloomington: Indiana\nUniversity Press, 2007), pp. 129–31.\n\n[149.](part0007.html#c03-ftn149a) Attila the Hun, for example, appears as a\ncharacter in both the Nibelungenlied and Volsunga Saga.\n\n[150.](part0007.html#c03-ftn150a) Obviously, “fantasy” can refer to a very\nwide range of literature, from _Alice in Wonderland_ and _The Wonderful Wizard\nof Oz_ to _The Call of Cthulhu_ , and many critics include science fiction as\na subgenre of fantasy as well. Still, Middle Earth style heroic fantasy\nremains the “unmarked term.”\n\n[151.](part0007.html#c03-ftn151a) Elsewhere, I’ve referred to this as “the\nugly mirror phenomenon.” See David Graeber, “There Never Was a West: Democracy\nEmerges from the Spaces in Between,” in _Possibilities: Notes on Hierarchy,\nRebellion, and Desire_ (Oakland: AK Press, 2007), p. 343.\n\n[152.](part0007.html#c03-ftn152a) The key difference here is no doubt that\nMedieval carnivals were, in fact, organized largely bottom-up, much unlike\nRoman circuses.\n\n[153.](part0007.html#c03-ftn153a) From a letter to his son written during\nWorld War II: “My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy\n(philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men\nwith bombs)—or to ‘unconstitutional’ Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses\nthe word State (in any sense other than the inanimate realm of England and its\ninhabitants, a thing that has neither power, rights nor mind); and after a\nchance of recantation, execute them …” The letter adds that he feels relations\nof command are only appropriate within small face-to-face groups, and that the\none bright spot in the world is “the growing habit of disgruntled men of\ndynamiting factories and power-stations.” (Letter to Christopher Tolkien,\nNovember 29, 1943; in _The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien_ , Humphrey Carpenter,\ned. [London: Allen & Unwin, 1981], #52.) Others have noted that this\ninsistence that only personal authority is legitimate is a reflection of a\nlifelong hatred of bureaucracy in all its manifestations (Fascist, Communist,\nor Welfare State): i.e., John Garth, _Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold\nof Middle-earth_ [London: HarperCollins, 2011], p. 94, and Mark Home,\n_J.R.R.Tolkien_ [Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 2011], pp. 124–27. The latter\nobserves that “the fluctuation between kings and ‘anarchy’ is not odd for a\nstudent of northern European tribal history” (ibid., p. 125) but rather, is\ntypical of what I’ve been referring to as heroic societies.\n\n[154.](part0007.html#c03-ftn154a) Douglas Adams fans will recall that _The\nHitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy_ , another of the great midcentury\nbureaucratic satires, begins with precisely such a scenario, leading to the\ndestruction of the planet.\n\n[155.](part0007.html#c03-ftn155a) The noble warrior chief versus evil magician\nscenario is basically a British colonial trope; colonial officials in Africa\nalmost invariably tried to locate warrior elites, whom they admired, and if\nthey did not find them, would assume they had been displaced by the wiles of\n“witch doctors” of one sort or another, whom they invariably saw as a\nmaleficent influence. _King Solomon’s Mines_ is the ultimate fictional\nexpression of this myth.\n\n[156.](part0007.html#c03-ftn156a) Huizinga actually assumes that play and\ngames are the same thing. Johan Huizinga. _Homo Ludens: The Play Element in\nCulture_ (Boston: Beacon Press, 1955).\n\n[157.](part0007.html#c03-ftn157a) And if one is playing a game, the “play”\nelement is the unpredictable element, the degree to which one is not simply\nenacting rules, but applying skill, or rolling the dice, or otherwise\nembracing uncertainty.\n\n[158.](part0007.html#c03-ftn158a) To take just one typical example: J. Lowell\nLewis, “Toward a Unified Theory of Cultural Performance” in _Victor Turner and\nContemporary Cultural Performance_ , Graham St. John, ed. (London: Berghahn,\n2008), p. 47. But the point is made over and over in the literature. I might\nadd that by this analysis, Dungeons & Dragons and similar role-playing games\nare so enjoyable because they have achieved the perfect mix of the play and\nthe game principle.\n\n[159.](part0007.html#c03-ftn159a) “Alternative Futures,” _Times of India_ ,\nFebruary 10, 2007, in times of india.indiatimes.com/edit-page/Alternative-\nFutures/articleshow/1586903.cms.\n\n[160.](part0007.html#c03-ftn160a) Carl Schmitt, _Political Theology: Four\nChapters on the Concept of Sovereignty_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,\n2004 [1922]). Schmitt’s arguments were used by the Nazis to provide legal\njustification for concentration camps.\n\n[161.](part0007.html#c03-ftn161a) “In Indian cosmology, play is a top down\nidea. Passages to play and their premises are embedded at a high level of\nabstraction and generality. The qualities of play resonate and resound\nthroughout the whole. But more than this, qualities of play are integral to\nthe very operation of the cosmos,” D. Handelman, 1992. “Passages to play:\nParadox and process” _Play and Culture_ vol 5 no. 1, p. 12. Cited in Brian\nSutton-Smith, _The Ambiguity of Play_ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,\n2001), p. 55.\n\n[162.](part0007.html#c03-ftn162a) Sutton-Smith op. cit., pp. 55–60. Bottom-up\nplay, in contrast—the notion of play as intrinsically subversive—has always\nexisted, but only really became our dominant way of thinking about such\nmatters with Romanticism.\n\n[163.](part0007.html#c03-ftn163a) Or to be more precise, its representatives\nare the only people allowed to act violently in a given situation if they are\nboth present and on the job.\n\n[164.](part0007.html#c03-ftn164a) During protests against the World Bank in\n2002, police in Washington, D.C., decided to surround a public park and arrest\neveryone inside it. I well remember calling out to the commanding officer\nasking what we were being arrested for. He answered, “We’ll think of something\nlater.”\n\n[165.](part0007.html#c03-ftn165a) It can happen, but it usually has to involve\nanal penetration with weapons. At least, the two cases that jump most readily\nto mind are officer Justin Volpe, who sodomized a man he mistakenly thought\nhad earlier thrown a punch at him in a street fight with a broom handle in a\nprecinct bathroom in New York in 1997, and Dennis Krauss, a Georgia police\nofficer, who repeatedly responded to domestic violence calls by extorting\nsexual favors from the women who called him and in 1999, attempted to sodomize\none with a gun. Both were sentenced to prison terms. But it usually takes an\nassault of that outrageousness for an officer to actually go to jail. For\ninstance, during the Global Justice Movement and Occupy Wall Street, there\nwere repeated cases of police systematically breaking wrists and fingers of\nnonviolent protesters—often after announcing they would do so—but no police\nofficer was ever so much as charged, let alone convicted of assault.\n\n[166.](part0007.html#c03-ftn166a) Notice the complex relation between this and\nthe rationalist view described earlier, where creativity was seen as demonic\nbecause it was opposed to the divine or cosmic principle of reason. Here,\ncreativity is seen as demonic because it _partakes_ of the divine or cosmic\nprinciple of play!\n\n[167.](part0007.html#c03-ftn167a) Some contemporary political theorists are\nwilling to more or less state this outright. I am thinking particularly here\nof that school of thought that is referred to as Civic Republicanism, as\noutlined by intellectual historians like Quentin Skinner and philosophers like\nPhilip Pettit, who argue that “freedom” in the classic liberal tradition is\nnot a matter of being able to act without the interference of power, or even\nthreats of violence—since legal systems do threaten those who break the rules\nwith violence—but rather, to act without the interference of _arbitrary_\npower. This is not the place to launch into a detailed analysis but the entire\nformulation thus comes to present a zero-sum view of freedom. “Arbitrary”\nafter all just means “non-determined.” In a system of arbitrary authority,\ndecisions reflect the “will and pleasure” of the despot. But from the\nperspective of the despot, “arbitrariness” is freedom. So the people are free\nif the ruler is not. Powerful people have to follow the rules. But since all\ncitizens have a certain degree of power, so does everyone else. Ultimately,\nsince freedom means protection from the arbitrary (non-rule-bound) power of\nothers, and since power is everywhere, the logic provides a charter for the\nreduction of all aspects of human life into sets of transparent rules. (For\nthe key texts here: Philip Pettit, _Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and\nGovernment_ [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997]; Quentin Skinner, “Freedom as the\nAbsence of Arbitrary Power,” in _Republicanism and Political Theory_ , Cécile\nLaborde and John Maynor, eds.

There is,\nindeed, a whole science, glottochronology, premised on this fact.\n\n[170.](part0007.html#c03-ftn170a) Jo Freeman, “The Tyranny of\nStructurelessness.” First officially published in _The Second Wave_ (vol. 2,\nno 1).

And even mainstream comics have become more\nexplicitly political over time (Lex Luthor, for example, became President!).\nStill, if one wants to understand the essence of a popular genre, one does not\nexamine its most sophisticated, high-culture variants. If one wants to\nunderstand the essence of a popular genre, one looks at schlock.\n\n[172.](part0008.html#app-ftn172a) Unless you want to count the case of one\nindividual who had clearly seen far too many Batman movies.\n\n\n\n\n",
