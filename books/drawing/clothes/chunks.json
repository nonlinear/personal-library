Nature has supplied both line\nand form that are symmetrical and harmonious. These laws of rhythm exist and\nare recognized as undefined laws.\n\nThere is rhythm in the movement of the sea and tides, in stars and planets, in\ntrees and grasses, clouds and thistledown. It is a part of all animal and\nplant life. It is the movement of uttered words expressed in their accented\nand unaccented syllables and in the grouping and pauses of speech. Both poetry\nand music are the embodiment in appropriate rhythmical sound; of beautiful\nthought; imagination or emotion. Without rhythm there could be no poetry or\nmusic. In drawing and painting there is rhythm in outline, color, light and\nshade. So to express rhythm in drawing a figure we have in the balance of\nmasses, a subordination of the passive or inactive side, to the more forceful\nand angular side in action, keeping constantly in mind the hidden, subtle flow\nof symmetry throughout.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0004.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0004.jpg)\n\n\n# THE SEVEN LAWS OF FOLDS\n\nMANY teachers and art students should be glad to have some definite knowledge\nof folds and should be pleased to have some idea that explains the principles\nwhich underlie the various forms that take place on the draped figure. To make\nthis clear and as simple as possible, diagrams are shown by way of\nillustrations that are founded upon important truths. These primary principles\nare built upon the theory that each fold has a different function and\ncharacter.\n\nThere has been a great lack of concise and simple understanding on the\nsubject. Much that has heretofore been written, has for the most part, been\nvague and of little educational value.\n\nThe diagrams on pages eight and nine come under the head of geometric or\nworking drawings and represent seven distinct characters of folds, each\nplaying its individual role in the story of the draped human body.\n\nOne can make a code of laws to be governed by, but every one of these can be\nchanged or eliminated, still one should know these laws so that they may be\nused as such or deliberately broken.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0005.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0005.jpg)\n\nPIPE\n\n![e9780486138121_i0006.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0006.jpg)\n\nZIGZAG\n\n![e9780486138121_i0007.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0007.jpg)\n\nSPIRAL\n\n![e9780486138121_i0008.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0008.jpg)\n\nDIAPER\n\n![e9780486138121_i0009.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0009.jpg)\n\nHALF LOCK\n\n![e9780486138121_i0010.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0010.jpg)\n\nDROP\n\n![e9780486138121_i0011.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0011.jpg)\n\nINERT\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0012.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0012.jpg)\n\n# DRAPERY\n\nDRESS materials in themselves have no form. When lying on the floor they\nconform to the floor; thrown over a chair they take the contour of the chair\non which they rest; if on a hanger or hook, the folds descend from their\nsupport. Drapery therefore, is nothing definite in itself as it depends\nentirely upon that which lies beneath. Drapery may encircle, it may fall or it\nmay be drawn upward. To realize this is the first step to the understanding of\ndrapery. There is no sameness, no monotony, every fold has a distinct\ncharacter of its own. To show this vast difference in folds take the figure of\nVictory as an example. First, the diaper pattern which in this case falls from\nits fixed points of support at the shoulders is the simplest of all folds to\nunderstand. Next, a spiral fold is drawn around the receding hips; opposed to\nthis spiral is a fold of a totally different character. It is irregular and\nzigzags from side to side. Below this another distinct type of fold appears,\nknown as the pipe or cord fold. Beneath this another type emerges, called a\nhalf-lock. This in turn shares its form with that which lies prone upon the\nfloor and is known by the name, inert. There is also the fold that is carried\naway from the body by its movement or by the air and is known as the drop fold\nor a piece of flying drapery.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0013.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0013.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0014.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0014.jpg)\n\n# THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS OF FOLDS\n\nEACH fold has a character of its own. If but one formation was used, the\ndesign would be monotonous and insipid. If drapery is drawn upward it causes\none kind of fold; if allowed to fall, another form of fold is created. Folds\npassing from one point of support to another make distinct arrangements such\nas zigzags and half-locks, while others as they meet, die away and are known\nas the diaper pattern. One is angular in formation, the other spiral or\nrhythmic. The formation of folds must be recognized as a law, as folds are of\nsuch complex character it is difficult to observe these facts.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0015.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0015.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0016.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0016.jpg)\n\n# PIPE OR DROP FOLDS\n\nIF A piece of cloth is held up or nailed by one corner and then pulled from\nthe other corner, tubular forms radiate from its fixed point. Whether the\ncloth is woolen, cotton or silk; whether it is thick, thin, old or new, the\nsame radiation, the same tube or pipe-like forms are always prevalent. This is\na distinct fact, therefore it must be recognized as a law as it is something\nthat repeats itself often enough to be recognized as such, something to look\nfor, something you expect to find.\n\nThese radiating cords or summits as they descend from their points of support\nare the simplest forms in drapery and are the first to be understood. A simple\ncord fold will descend and then divide into two or three other cords. As these\ndiverge from each other, the original cords may make room for two or more\nwithin them, then these may again divide, making two or more until they\nflatten out. The breaking out and divergence of these primary folds is simple\nbut of extreme importance. The pull as well as the force of the pull must be\nunderstood. This thought makes the drawing understandable to the observer.\nRadiating lines should not be abused but should be studied carefully. These\nlaws may be studied apart from the model, but it requires a draped figure for\nverification. Then if the folds take different form, it will be found that\nthese pipes or cords of drapery radiate from the points of support until they\nclasp the exposed parts of the figure where they cling to the form beneath.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0017.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0017.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0018.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0018.jpg)\n\n# ZIGZAG FOLDS\n\nA TUBULAR fold of cloth may be bent. As it bends the outer portion becomes\nrigid and underneath becomes more slack. This excess cloth on the inner side\nbuckles into a more or less definite pattern which must be figured out and\nremembered. The twisting of this fold when bent gives an entirely new design,\none which might be called a zigzag pattern.\n\nHere the pull is uneven in character. It is quick and jerky. To demonstrate\nthis, take six single sheets of newspaper, roll them into a two inch cylinder,\nbend the roll in the middle, now grasp the roll near each side of the bend and\ngive it a sharp twist from side to side. Note the pattern and the design. You\ncan reason out why these bendings and twistings so consistently repeat\nthemselves. Try it out on a piece of stiff cloth and you will find a familiar\nresemblance. It is this repetition that must be stored away in your mind so\nthat you may check your knowledge with what you see on the model. Remember at\nall times that each fold has a character apart from every other fold; remember\nthat you will have a preference as to folds; that some folds will appeal to\nyou more than others, making your drawings different from other drawings.\nRemember that the things you know and leave out, are the things that give the\npower and simplicity to your drawings.\n\nStudents gain much by making a number of drawings that will tell the story of\nan interlocking zigzag fold. Do not copy the drawings on the opposite page,\nstart with a straight or curved line and try to lock the ends with other lines\nthat will account for the bringing together the two opposing forces.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0019.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0019.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0020.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0020.jpg)\n\nCARPACCIO\n\n![e9780486138121_i0021.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0021.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0022.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0022.jpg)\n\n# SPIRAL\n\nNo MATTER how complicated the fold appears, it can be traced to a few basic\nprinciples. These few principles should be catalogued and kept as far apart in\nthe mind as possible. One should be able to draw at all times, any one of\nthese seven distinctive characters without notes or a model. Think of the part\nthey play so that when confronted by the costumed model, you are less liable\nto get lost in depicting these ever changing folds. The arrangement of curved\nand diagonal lines fit the rounded forms of the body as the material wraps\naround the figure. In the same manner folds widen as they leave their points\nof support. It is safe to say as they radiate away from the point of support\nthey seldom parallel. To a great extent, these radiating folds should have a\ndecorative arrangement as well as an understanding; (the knowledge that there\nis the art of knowing what to leave out). As a sleeve enters the shoulders,\nthe design calls for both curved and straight lines. Where the elbow is bent,\nthe material radiates outward and up to encircle the wedge that occurs on the\nouter side of the forearm just above the elbow. The number of folds depend\nupon the texture or weight of the fabric as well as the number of times the\ngarment has been worn. Folds should not look as if they paralleled nor repeat\nthemselves in direction or volume, with all an understanding sense of design\nand pattern.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0023.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0023.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0024.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0024.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0025.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0025.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0026.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0026.jpg)\n\n# ARRANGEMENT\n\nTHE design of a draped figure must first be good in proportion and each\nportion be relevant to the whole. The detail must have a relation to the main\ndesign and not be plastered over with meaningless zigzags and sagging folds\nthat do not contribute to the real form of the body which must be preserved\nand not broken up my minute detail. To arrange these details comes under the\nhead of composition. In composition there must be rhythm, charm, and if the\nsubject calls for it even beauty, a word for which no one can give a\nsatisfactory definition, yet all this enters into a composition. The draped\nfigure must be a complete pattern in itself.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0027.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0027.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0028.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0028.jpg)\n\n# DIAPER PATTERN\n\nTHE material that drapes a figure has no form nor shape. It is the change of\nform under the material that gives a reason for the different character that a\nfold takes. Every fold must have its support. It either pulls or is being\npulled; it clings or it folds; it encircles or it is festooned, but in every\ncase it must be supported. It does not become drapery until it is supported by\nsomething. Take a yard or so of plain material in both hands; hold it by the\ntwo upper corners and allow the center to sag. It shows how the folds festoon\nand lock into each other toward the center. Try both light and heavy materials\nuntil you note the relationship in the radiating lines. Trace the fold or\ncrease from the point of support by which it is being held. Follow to where\nthe two sagging opposing forces meet and study carefully how they interlock.\nStill holding the two corners at arms length bring the ends nearer together\nand note the changes that take place and in the way they repeat themselves.\nAfter you have the idea as to how the festoon locks, the goods may be thumb-\ntacked to a board or to the wall or placed on a lay figure. On the latter,\narrange the goods first and then turn the figure in the position desired. Thus\nthrough observation you gain the construction and sense of another fold that\nis distinct in character from any other fold, and has been known for centuries\nas the Diaper Pattern.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0029.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0029.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0030.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0030.jpg)\n\n# HALF-LOCK FOLD\n\nTHE half-lock takes place every time a tubular or flattened piece of material\nabruptly changes its direction. When the turn is at or near a right angle, the\nlocking is more sharp and angular; when they fall in sweeping curves, the\nlocks are more rounded and are apt to dissolve one into the. other. Folds must\nbe made to explain themselves without difficulty, therefore, must be direct\nand simple. Each fold must appear to be as far apart in character as the\nletters of the alphabet and as letters when brought together to form a word.\nAs each letter seems to dissolve itself into that word and that again into a\nsentence, so it is with folds, each with a distinct character, yet when\nbrought together the pipe, zigzag, spiral, half-lock, diaper, festoon and drop\nfolds must dissolve one into the other making one harmonious element called\nthe draped figure. Each has its own function. Each is supported from or by the\nform underneath. The half-lock is more prevalent in a sitting down figure due\nto the greater number of angles causing a greater change in the direction of\nplanes.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0031.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0031.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0032.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0032.jpg)\n\n# DIAPER\n\nHOLD the material at arms’ length, drop one corner and it will be seen that\nthe radiations are longer and of greater volume on the side that is held high\nand that it locks in a more abrupt manner on the lower side. Again bring the\nmaterial to a horizontal line and it will be found that the system of\nradiating lines and their locking into one another is less complicated than\nwhen the opposing forces are not equal. The shifting of these two points of\nsupport must be studied and brought to some basic form that is understandable.\n\nDo not think of drapery as a piece of still life; try to get at the facts and\nwhen the facts are known, then it is a matter of good judgment. This when\nsummed up, means the art of knowing what to leave out, putting in only the\nimportant things that give the character of each separate and individual fold.\nRemember to keep their characters as far apart as possible for each fold has\nits own mission and duty.\n\nFolds when they turn at an angle either intersect or lock into each other in\nthe form of a hook or break. When they turn, and take a gentle curve, they\nflatten out to broader areas. As the fold turns, it is the kind that is formed\nat the break that has to be carefully studied in detail. The crispness or the\nsoftness of the material is the only variation of a fold that is bent, the\ngeneral structure of the material remains the same.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0033.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0033.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0034.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0034.jpg)\n\nHALF LOCK\n\n![e9780486138121_i0035.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0035.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0036.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0036.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0037.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0037.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0038.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0038.jpg)\n\n# DROP-FOLD\n\nAs THIS particular class of fold leaves its support, being free, it takes a\nswinging rhythmical motion down the whole length of the material to its\nselvage edge. When these folds hang straight they add dignity to the figure\nbut when the outline is curved such as in movement and the lower borders are\nsuspended in space, they usually twist, turn or take a spiral form at their\ninner or outer edges. The drop-fold is a distinct opposite to any other\ncharacter of fold. No other fold must encroach upon its territory. It is used\nchiefly in figures that run, dance and other decorative movements. Its outline\nsways in weaving curves when the figure is in motion and yet with dignity when\nin repose. Whether in movement or static, all folds follow the laws of gravity\nwhen away from a fixed point. Only the details of these laws vary. A great\ndeal depends upon the materials used when they are cut straight across or warp\nways. They then behave differently in detail.\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0039.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0039.jpg)\n\n# INERT\n\nIT is understood, of course, that cloth no matter how thick or thin has in\nitself no given form. A piece of cloth when thrown or dropped on the floor\neither flattens out or crumples up and takes on a character distinct from any\nother form. This crumpled up piece of cloth is not static, it changes as it\nkeeps settling, in an hour’s time its vigorous angles become more subdued and\nflattened. Still it remains a fallen piece of goods with a character distinct\nand apart from any other, and this positive character must be the abstract\nidea back of the drawing to make it obvious to the onlooker that this fallen\npiece of cloth is inert and dead.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0040.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0040.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0041.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0041.jpg)\n\n# LOCK FOLD\n\nWHEN drawing folds that occur at the bending of a limb, it must be understood\nthat drapery is either attached to, or supported at some fixed point. If the\nmaterial is limited as to volume, such as the bending at the knee, the folds\nradiate in size and number from the fixed point of attachment as well as a\npoint of resistance. The lower limbs vary greatly as to shape; below the hip\nthe thigh is round, at the knee the form is square with its sides beveled\nforward and the broad double bellied calf muscle covers the upper half of the\nleg.\n\nWhen the leg is bent upon the thigh at the knee, the two opposing masses that\nare above and below the knee need little detail, but when bent at the joint,\nthe folds become bunched up and take on both spiral and acute angles. To\nmemorize the direction and meaning of one or two of these folds gives a plan\nto work upon. It takes both theory and close observation to find a fold that\noccurs again and again.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0042.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0042.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0043.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0043.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0044.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0044.jpg)\n\n# KNEE\n\nIN DRAWING folds look out for forms that happen and then happen again. Using\nthis as a background, one can put in the really important things that are\nessential to the story and not just a series of still life studies describing\nthings that are not worth describing. In studying the character of these\ndifferent folds, the quality of materials should be tried out to study their\ncomparative relationship, such as: the difference of weight and tension;\nheavier materials as compared to light or more pliant materials. Try to\nremember the folds that happen and then happen again and you will find a\nfamily resemblance in all materials no matter what the weight or texture.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0045.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0045.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0046.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0046.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0047.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0047.jpg)\n\n# VOLUME\n\nTHE treatment of heavy materials is more of a problem than that of lighter\nweight, for the reason that it is more difficult to preserve the real form of\nthe body beneath and make it apparent that it represents a human figure and\nnot just a mass of cloth and folds. Assuming that the principal supports of a\nsitting figure are from the knees, and that these supports are on a level\nhorizontally and not too close together, the descending folds would festoon\ntoward the center following the weight of the material causing the lower\nborder to fan out and become more pointed below and lower down than at the\nsides. Should one foot be resting on a stool or cushion then one support would\nbe higher than the other causing a large festoon above and a smaller one below\nto interlock much nearer the lower knee than at the center. In this case the\nfolds would not be continuous from one support to the other but would meet at\na more acute angle.\n\nWhen drapery hangs in loose folds the opposing festoon and cones do not\ninterlock at acute angles but intermingle and fade into each other. The\nthought must be to carry the idea that a fold is doing a definite thing. It is\nyour understanding as well as copying that makes the drawing of drapery\npossible.\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0048.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0048.jpg)\n\nRUBENS\n\n![e9780486138121_i0049.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0049.jpg)\n\n# DROP AND FLYING FOLDS\n\nFOLDS must be arranged and regulated to the lines of the figure. Folds that\nfall some distance from the source of support shake or wave irregularly as\nthey leave the figure. These may be seen as concave or convex according to the\nway it is connected to the cordage of the material. The upper portion may have\nthe same width or bulk, but having less space it gives a pipe-like appearance\nabove. As it descends it widens out and becomes more free at the lower\nborders. These descending folds must have the appearance of falling from their\nsupport above, such as the shoulder, sleeve or girdle. In drawing a drop or\nflying fold one must sense and force it to drop, no camera can give these\nqualities, they are personal, individual. A photograph may be useful in\nstudying the details of parts, but could scarcely be of use in the arrangement\nof, we will say, two figures or more. A camera may be as accurate as the human\neye, but it cannot render the beauty of line or the arrangement that enters\ninto the expression demanded by the many factors that go to make a\ncomposition. A photograph does not eliminate the petty details that go to make\nfolds convincing. The different characters of folds that are represented here\nmust not be looked on as a novelty. Drapery that falls free of the figure must\ngive the impression of descending or flying, the idea must be to carry this\nimpression to others, that this piece of drapery is doing a definite thing. It\nis your understanding of these simple laws that will make the drawing of\ndrapery possible and convincing.\n\nTo get an idea of drapery in motion, have someone express the movement you\nhave in mind by swinging a length or so of thin or heavy material in a\nbackward, a forward or a rhythmical movement. At the same time, hold a piece\nof tissue paper in one hand and twist or turn it with the other hand until it\nis given somewhat the duplicate motion you wish, then thumb-tack the tissue to\na board and copy the details. For heavier goods, a heavier piece of paper\nshould be used.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0050.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0050.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0051.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0051.jpg)\n\nDROP FOLD\n\n![e9780486138121_i0052.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0052.jpg)\n\n\n# HALF-LOCK\n\nDRAPERY when attached to the shoulder or girdle falls downward and radiates\nfrom the points of support. If they meet as they descend they fan out and\nusually dissolve into one graceful fold but when the material has two or more\npoints of support, they usually meet as angles or zigzags at their points of\nintersection. Once these facts are understood by the student, folds have a\nmeaning, while to the casual observer all folds look alike.\n\nAll materials whether thick or thin follow the laws of gravity. It must be\nunderstood also, that it is the variation of these common laws that give\ncharacter and charm to a drawing. Again, every line and every form of fold is\ndominated by the construction of the body beneath.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0053.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0053.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0054.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0054.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0055.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0055.jpg)\n\nLE BRUN\n\n# ARRANGEMENT OF FOLDS\n\nTHOUGH one can copy a piece of drapery by noting every fold or crease, it will\nbe observed that every time the model moves, the folds seem to take on a\ndifferent aspect. Therefore, some underlying principle must be thought out or\nthere will be little harmony as a whole.\n\nCloth revolves itself into drapery but the thought that must be carried out is\nthe idea of a figure draped with a body underneath. This fact must always be\nuppermost. Next, the art is in the arrangement which comprises line, rhythm,\ndistribution and subordination, grouping and balance, and the joining of all\nthese essentials into a harmonious whole.\n\nThe character of drapery has followed the different periods in art as well as\ndistinguishing the work of some particular master. Therefore, it must be\nrealized that the object could not have been a servile imitation of folds.\nThese periods varied from V shaped kinks at one time to long rounded festoons\nat another. The costumes of classic times were more suited to the study of the\nlaws of folds than at the present time. The Greek paintings on pottery kept to\nlong, flowing or sweeping lines that terminated in hook-like forms; the Gothic\nchanged from round to angular; the Renaissance period shows a radiation of\nline that follows the figure allowing the plain surfaces to cling or lie close\nto the form thereby accentuating the figure beneath.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0056.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0056.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0057.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0057.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0058.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0058.jpg)\n\nHALF LOCK\n\n![e9780486138121_i0059.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0059.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0060.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0060.jpg)\n\nHALF LOCK\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0061.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0061.jpg)\n\n# ARM AND FOREARM\n\nFABRICS follow the varied shapes of the body. They change in character every\ntime a different direction of the body or limb occurs. When considering a\nsleeved or draped arm, the masses that lie underneath must be considered. The\nmasses of the arm and forearm are joined by wedges and wedging movements that\noverlap each other at various angles. The shoulder slopes down and out, its\nbroad side facing outward, the upper arm flattened at the sides. The mass of\nthe forearm overlaps the end of the arm on the outside by a wedge that arises\na third of the way up and tapers toward the wrist. Whether the arm is straight\nor bent, this wedge, this underlying form must be kept in mind. The folds pass\nover and around it; the creases alternating between round, zigzag or locked\nyet seldom paralleling one another.\n\nThe mass of the upper half of the forearm is oval in shape when the thumb is\nturned away from the body and more round when the thumb side of the hand is\nreversed. The forearm as it approaches the wrist becomes flattened out to\nabout twice as wide as it is thick. As material has no form in itself, these\nround and wedged forms must be shown or felt under the material that covers\nthe arm. The folds at the elbow under certain conditions can be looked upon\nand copied as a piece of still life, but if the points of attachments and\nresistance, as well as their radiating lines are understood, the translation\nof the form beneath is clearer and better understood.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0062.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0062.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0063.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0063.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0064.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0064.jpg)\n\n![e9780486138121_i0065.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0065.jpg)\n\n\n![e9780486138121_i0066.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0066.jpg)\n\n# DRAPED FIGURE\n\nIT is understood of course, that a figure must first be outlined, drawn or\nsuggested before it can be properly clothed. Clothes are supported from the\nshoulder, the waist-band and at the hips in the costumes of both men and\nwomen. The principles of suspension are the same. Clothes are made loose\nenough so that the body can have great freedom of action, allowing the limbs\nto move freely in every possible way. These different actions in drapery are\nrepresented by lines radiating from the points of support terminating in hooks\nor hanging festoon-like from opposite systems. In case the folds are drawn\nupward in place of being allowed to fall, the surfaces of support change from\nan outward support to a stretch from the underside of the mass. From ancient\ntimes the dress was based on the simple principle of suspension from the\nshoulders or from a waist band. Styles may change but the basic principles\nremain the same. A piece of material when held up in the air descends by\ngravity and depends entirely upon its support. When this is taken away it\nfalls, flattens out and becomes inert.\n\n![e9780486138121_i0067.jpg](images/e9780486138121_i0067.jpg)\n\n\nPUBLISHER’S NOTE\n\nGeorge Bridgman is considered by some to have been the greatest teacher of\nfigure drawing of his day. An inspiration to generations of students in his\nclasses at the Art Students League in New York, he taught thousands more\nthrough his many books, of which Drawing the Draped Figure is the sixth to be\npublished by Dover. These books are proving as popular now as when they were\nfirst published. Read together, they make a complete course in the\nrepresentation of the human form in classical style.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nPublished in the United Kingdom by David & Charles, Brunel House, Forde Close,\nNewton Abbot, Devon TQ12 4PU.\n\n  \n\nBibliographical Note\n\nThis Dover edition, first published in 2001, is an unabridged republication of\nthe original edition published by Bridgman Publishers, Inc., Pelham, New York,\nunder the title The Seven Laws of Folds in 1942.\n\n  \n\nLibrary of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data\n\nBridgman, George Brant, 1864–1943.\n\nDrawing the draped figure : The seven laws of folds / George B.

There are those which pass around and radiate\nfrom the points of support, clasping the figure there-by reducing the receding\nsurface to a minimum or they may zigzag in an irregular manner from side to\nside. There are folds which are straight, festooned and V shaped; folds which\nfall, cross or pass around the figure. There are materials which have concave\nand convex forms as well as cord-like edges. All folds have laws unto\nthemselves. Some folds run into their opponents and die away while there are\nothers which terminate abruptly. Each individual fold has its own manner, its\ntemperament and almost its religion. Each pursues its function so that each\nmust be studied apart as a fixed law, a thing entirely apart, without\nconnection, yet held throughout by the unforeseen laws of rhythm.\n\nAs you would study the surface or an arm and forearm, or a thigh and a leg and\ntheir connection at the elbow or at the knee joints, these folds must come\ntogether, linked as they pass around or into one another. To do so, a name\nindicating a function must be given to each.\n\n  1. PIPE\n  2. ZIGZAG\n  3. SPIRAL\n  4. HALF-LOCK\n  5. DIAPER PATTERN\n  6. DROP\n  7.

With over 220 illustrations, \nThe Art of Drawing Folds: An Illustrator’s Guide to Drawing the Clothed Figure reveals the logic and patterns in \nfolds, enabling the reader to more easily predict the behavior of cloth when creating folds in their own drawings \nand paintings.\nAddressing folds in clothing systematically, the author provides a clear, concise approach to the analysis, classi­\nfication and visualization of convincingly naturalistic folds. Starting with the nature of fabric and its geometry, this \nbook methodically explores the reasons for fold behavior based on the construction of clothing and the shapes and \nactions of the human figure. An essential guide and reference for animators, illustrators, storyboard artists, comic-​\nbook artists, 3D modelers, sculptors, fashion designers and students, The Art of Drawing Folds simplifies one of \nthe most complex and important aspects of drawing the clothed figure.\nKelly Gordon Brine is a storyboard artist working on movies and television shows such as The Punisher, Daredevil, \nJessica Jones, Designated Survivor and Person of Interest. He has taught drawing as an assistant professor at the \nUniversity of Toronto, and has also worked as a comic book artist and a software developer.\n \n",

They attract us with their colors, their textures and their intricate shapes, and they intrigue \nus as they hide and reveal the human form. Their ever-​changing character seems to give them a life of their own, but they \nkeep their logic hidden. Folds have always been an important and striking element of figurative painting, and through the \nages artists have studied folds both to capture their beauty and to clothe the figures in their paintings more convincingly.\nIn this book I unravel the mysteries of folds. And because figure drawing and light and shade are so important \nwhen drawing the folds in clothed figures, I have included chapters on these topics as well. The important topic of \nfashion is beyond the scope of this book, but the knowledge you gain about folds will serve you well in illustrating \nany fashion you choose.\nI have worked for over 20 years as a storyboard artist for major film and television productions, and some exam­\nples of my work are included here in the introduction. At university I studied mathematics, and as an illustrator I am \nself-​taught. I acquired the knowledge and developed the methods described in these pages so that I could draw \nquickly and convincingly from my imagination without having to find reference photos to copy from.\nFolds have long been a neglected topic that deserves more attention. In this book you will find thorough, \ninsightful and convincing explanations of the mechanisms of folds in clothing and elsewhere. If I had found a book \nsuch as this early in my career, it would have helped me enormously!\nFolds are found everywhere in flexible materials such as paper, plastic, foil, leather and cloth. All materials fold \nin similar ways, although the thickness, stretchiness and other qualities of materials affect the number, size and \nangularity of folds. The principles of folds can be applied generally, but this book focuses on folds in clothing. The \napproach of this book is to understand the reasons for the many shapes of folds. It covers the essentials for creat­\ning believable folds both in clothing and in the skin of the face and hands.\nWell-​drawn folds help make drawings and paintings of clothed figures look three-​dimensional and realistic, as \nwell as adding their own beauty. When we draw from life or photos we can copy what we see, but when drawing \nfrom the imagination we need knowledge to guide us. Drawing the figure requires anatomical knowledge, while \ndrawing folds requires an understanding of their geometry. Once an artist has learned why folds occur in cloth, they \ncan apply principles and patterns that will take much of the guesswork out of drawing clothing. This book covers \nboth the theory and the practice of drawing folds.\nThere are many reasons to believe that the masters of the past created their paintings largely without models, \nrelying instead on their knowledge of anatomy and folds. Some of these reasons are: horses, fluttering drapery \nand flying cherubs don’t pose for portraits; a model with the right appearance may be unobtainable; models and \ncostumes are expensive; the posing of dramatic actions and angles can be difficult or impossible; folds change \nevery time a model takes a break; and drawing without using models is considerably faster. If you look at paintings \nand drawings by masters such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Peter Paul Rubens and François Boucher, you’ll \nsee that they had a remarkable understanding of folds.\nIf you draw from your imagination, as do fashion illustrators, animators, graphic novel and comic book artists, car­\ntoonists, storyboard artists and others, the more you know about folds in clothing, the better you’ll be able to draw. \nRealistic folds will accentuate the shape, action and character of the people you draw, will make your drawings look more \nattractive and believable, will ensure that poor folds aren’t a distraction in your art, and will save time. If you draw mainly \nfrom models or reference photos, knowledge of folds will help you determine how to simplify and accentuate the folds.\nIf you believe that knowing something about artistic human anatomy is important to your art, then knowing \nabout the “anatomy” of folds is probably important to you too. And just as with human anatomy, the goal is not to \nmake your drawings perfectly accurate, but to make them convincing to your audience to help you tell your story.\n \n",

Folds \nform in such things as cloth, leather, paper, aluminum foil, leaves and skin whenever they are subjected to com­\npression. When these materials are bent, pushed in from the edges, pulled down by gravity or pushed outward \nfrom within, they respond by adopting geometrical patterns in standard ways that are not random. All materials fold \nin the simplest way possible –​ the path of least resistance. Many small, curved and angular shapes are created that \ninterconnect in a pattern that responds to the compression (Figure 0.1).\n0.1  Folds are created and eliminated by forces acting on the material and by the shapes of the objects lying beneath the material.\n \n \n \n \n",

Even a tailored suit that is made to be as smooth and even \nas possible will have folds.\nThe geometry of cloth in a small area of clothing changes under compression into folds in a straightforward man­\nner, but as these small areas interlock with other folds, the geometry that arises can become complex.

Do people, animals and objects seem solid and real? Is there a mechanism \nto the actions of the figures? There is a logic to the workings of the bones and muscles, to the workings of folds, \nand to many other things.

Folds are predict­\nable, and if you commit their most common patterns to memory, you will have a powerful tool that you can use \nin your art.\nFolds should be drawn spontaneously and not be too symmetrical. For instance, the horizontal folds that \nappear in a T-​shirt across the abdomen when a figure bends forward can be drawn as three quick and slightly \nrandom lines that are not perfectly parallel and not of the same length. Later they can be refined, but they will \nretain a more natural appearance because they are not rigidly symmetrical.

If a simple fold is folded a second time, so that it is now a fold of a fold, it is called a \ncompound fold. Combinations of simple and compound folds are called complex folds. In clothing, similar patterns \nof folds always occur in similar circumstances. Folds never have to be mathematically perfect; they just have to \nlook reasonable and attractive.\nThe size, number and angularity of the folds will vary depending on the type of material used, but the rules \ngoverning how folds form are universal. There are standard folds that occur in any material subjected to the same \nforces. But when drawing different types of fabric, the standard folds have to be modified. For instance, gravity will \ncause thinner fabrics to droop more than thicker fabrics will. Stretchier fabrics will stay close to the body and have \nsmoother, more rounded folds. Stiffer fabrics will resist folding and form larger, more angular folds. An analogy can \nbe made to human anatomy: we all have a very similar structure, but each of us has unique proportions that create \nthe wide variety in people’s appearance.\nCloth retains its surface area whether it is pulled flat or is bunched into folds. As compression moves the edges \nof cloth closer to each other, the “footprint” of the cloth is made smaller, but the total area of the actual cloth does \nnot change; it simply becomes subdivided into the various surfaces of the folds that have formed.\nAll folds are combinations of smooth curves, flat planes and sharp direction changes. In any single small area of \ncloth (or leather, paper, foil or plastic) there are only a few things that a piece of material can do. The default state \nof an area of fabric is to lie in a plane, which is how it was woven or knitted.\nCompression causes folds to form. There is even compression, where two areas of cloth are pushed straight \ntowards each there. There is also uneven compression, in which two areas of cloth are pushed towards each other \nas they follow an arc centered on a nearby point in the cloth. And it is also possible to have compression in more \nthan one direction at the same time, where even or uneven compression is occurring in two different directions, \nand this creates more complicated folds.\nFolding a piece of cloth over onto itself creates a fold. When clothing is worn, it isn’t usually such intentional \nfolding that creates folds: folds in clothing are normally caused by gravity and the actions of the figure.\nAN OVERVIEW \nOF FOLDS AND \nMATERIALS\n1\n \n",

Cloth adopts the shape of the shape it is on: it can lie flat in a plane, or be cylindrical or conical. \nExamples are a carpet lying on the floor, paper towels on a paper tube, and a napkin wrapped around an ice cream cone.\n1.1  Cloth and other flat materials can lie smoothly only on planes, cylinders and cones.\nA flat surface is not necessary for cloth to flatten: all that is necessary is that it be pulled evenly from all four \nsides. If two areas of a piece of cloth are pushed evenly towards each other, the cloth begins to arch into a cylin­\ndrical shape. But if two areas of cloth are pushed towards each other using uneven pressure, the cloth will begin \nto arch into the shape of a cone.\nThe terms cylinder and cone are used here with the broad definition that is sometimes employed to include cylin­\nders and cones that are partly flattened or opened on one side. You can easily roll a cylinder or cone from a sheet of \npaper to prove to yourself that they can be slightly flattened without losing their smoothness and lack of additional folds.\nThese are the only two families of folds: those based on cylinders and those based on cones. The folds that are \nrelated to cylinders are parallel folds, and the folds related to cones are radial folds. In clothing folds usually occur \nin groups with members of both families interlocking with each other.\nPARALLEL FOLDS\nParallel folds are created by compression resulting from even pressure. Their shape resembles a cylinder, and they \nare called parallel folds because the straight lines that run along their length are parallel to each other. They do not \nusually form a complete cylinder. An important characteristic of every parallel fold is that it stays the same size along \nits length. Often two or more parallel folds are also parallel to each other, for instance when they form an S-​shaped \ncurve. Any part of an article of clothing that lies over a cylindrical form (such as a thigh) can lie very smoothly.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Their shape resembles a cone, and they are called \nradial folds because the straight lines that run along their length all radiate from the same point of origin. They don’t \nusually form a complete cone. Radial folds start at their tips from nothing and grow higher and wider along their length.\nCOMPOUND FOLDS\nAny parallel or radial fold can become a compound fold if it is folded a second time. A fold starts as a simple or first-​\norder fold. If an existing simple fold is folded onto itself, then a second-​order or compound fold is created. In other \nwords, a compound fold is a fold of a fold. The actions of the figure often force folds in clothing to fold a second \ntime. At the edge of the second fold there will be a sharp direction change, so a compound fold has a “corner” to \nit that a first-​order single fold does not have. The indentation at the corner is called the eye of the fold, and makes \ncompound folds easy to recognize (Figure 1.2).\n1.2  A compound fold can be created by folding a piece of cloth or paper, and then folding it again along a line that crosses \nthe first fold. Compound folds always have a recognizable eye where the second fold meets the edge of the cloth.\nThere are also higher-​order folds, but they are uncommon in clothing unless that clothing is folded for storage. You \nwill see them in folded towels and blankets. A flat unfolded blanket has just one layer, while a blanket folded in half \nwill have a single fold and will consist of two layers. If this folded blanket is folded again across the first fold, it will \nform a second-​order compound fold and will have four layers. If it is now folded across the most recent fold, it will \nbecome a compound fold of the third order and will have eight layers. A blanket is often folded four or five times, so it \nmight have 16 or 32 layers! But for the purpose of drawing clothing we need only look at first-​ and second-​order folds.\nCOMPLEX FOLDS\nComplex folds are combinations of parallel, radial and compound folds. Clothing will have interlocking folds created \nby compression at every flexed joint. Some sections of the cloth will lie flat, some will have become parallel and \nradial folds of various sizes and at various angles, and some will have formed compound folds. Cloth often appears to \nhave complicated folds, but when you examine small areas of the folds, you can find reasons why they have formed.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

The stretchiness, stiffness, resilience and thickness of the material influence the geometry and appear­\nance of folds. Stiffer materials are less influenced by gravity and droop less. For example, a carpet will bend in \nlarger folds than a cotton sheet, but its folds will be rounded (Figure 1.3).\n1.3  When stiff materials fold, their greater rigidity allows them to support themselves more, and they tend to obscure the forms \nthey cover. Flexible materials are more affected by gravity and compression, and will sag and reveal more of the forms they cover.\nStretchy fabrics are knitted, and some can stretch up to 50 percent. Knitted fabric has no single straight line \nof thread or yarn anywhere in its construction, and knitted items can stretch in all directions equally. This level \nof elasticity is not found in woven fabrics. T-​shirts, sweatshirts, sweaters, hosiery and many other garments are \nmade from knitted fabric (Figure 1.4). Cloth is always woven, but I use the term loosely in this book to include all \ntypes of fabric.\n1.4  Cloth is woven and has threads that mesh in a grid pattern; cloth is not stretchy.

The folds that appear \nwill not be angular. Stretchy garments fit so that they are always stretched over larger parts of the body such as the \nthighs and calves, and at joints such as the knee they are closer to their original dimensions. Therefore, there is very \nlittle excess material that has to be compressed at a flexed joint, and thus there are almost no folds there. Non-​\nstretchy materials don’t change their dimensions, and the size of garments worn must be a little larger in order to be \nable to put them on and to be able to flex the joints. When non-​stretchy fabrics are compressed, they subdivide into \na greater number of folds than do stretchy fabrics, and these folds are smaller. A completely non-​stretchy material \nlike aluminum foil will form into hundreds of small, sharp, well-​delineated folds when compressed (Figure 1.5).\n1.5  Stretchy materials have a few large, rounded folds, while non-​stretchy materials have many small, angular folds.\nSometimes the sections of cloth in clothing are “cut on the bias,” so that the threads run diagonally over the \nbody and not vertically and horizontally. A garment such as a skirt that is made this way is able to stretch more than \nusual across the body’s contours and is thus more form-​fitting (Figure 1.6).\n1.6  When a garment is made from pieces of cloth that are cut on the bias, the diagonal orientation of the threads makes the \ngarment more form-​fitting, with fewer folds.

The areas of fabric are \nlarge and the material cannot hold itself up against gravity. In addition, when compression causes folds to form at \nbent joints, the blue jean fabric folds more often to fit around the man’s larger forms. So the effect is that the same \ntype of material looks softer and less angular on a large person than on a small one.\nWet fabric behaves very differently from dry fabric.

If it’s draped over any other \nshape, additional folds will form that cannot be smoothed out and made to disappear. The limbs, torso and neck \nare somewhat cylindrical in shape, so clothing that is made to be cylindrical can fit well over the figure with a \nminimum of extra folds. The limbs taper to the hands and feet, so sleeves and pant legs are often tapered too, \nbecoming slightly less cylindrical and a little more like cones. The design of most garments avoids excess mate­\nrial that will droop or bunch into folds, while maintaining a slightly loose fit that allows freedom of movement.\nWe might not normally think of a sleeve or pant leg wrapping around a limb as a fold, but if cloth is curved, it is a \nfold, and it behaves differently from flat cloth. Folds have a structure of connected curves which may be in contact \nwith the body or may be hollow and suspended.\nCLOTH UNDER TENSION AND COMPRESSION\nTension eliminates folds, flattening the cloth. If cloth is pulled between two points, it will flatten into a \nstraight line between these points. The imaginary line between the points where the cloth is being pulled is \nthe axis of tension (Figure 2.1). As tension increases, cloth becomes flatter and straighter unless an object \nis pushing it to the side along its path. If all four sides of a rectangle of cloth are pulled evenly, the cloth will \nhave no folds.\nWhen there is tension in just one axis, there are not necessarily any folds in the cloth. If folds are seen running \nin the direction of the axis of tension, it’s because there is compression of the cloth across the axis of tension, at \na right angle to it, and the folds we see are caused by the compression in this other axis.\nTHE ELEMENTS \nOF FOLDS\n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Tension eliminates folds.\nThe imaginary line that runs in the direction of compression is the axis of compression (Figure  2.2). \nCompression bunches the cloth, creating folds. Compression can result from the action of the figure or from \ngravity. If an area of cloth is flat, and two points anywhere on the cloth are pushed closer to each other, then \nthe cloth between those two points is compressed. The distance between those two points as measured along \nthe surface of the cloth will be greater than the direct straight-​line distance between the two points. The excess \ncloth adapts by curving into folds to accommodate this excess. Even compression will start to form a cylinder \nin the cloth, while uneven or rotational compression will begin to form a cone. Folds formed from compression \nare hollow inside, unlike folds formed in cloth lying over the figure or an object, which are filled with the form \nthey are lying on.\n2.2  The direction in which cloth is compressed is the axis of compression. Compression creates folds.\nWhen a piece of cloth lying on a flat surface is compressed evenly, several similar folds often appear running at a \nright angle to the axis of compression, like ridges on a plain. It could be just one ridge, but gravity will often cause a \nlarge fold to collapse into smaller ones. These folds can lead the observer to believe that they point in the direction \n \n \n \n",

But in fact the ridges point in the direction in which there is no compression, and \nnot necessarily any tension. To understand folds, you always have to understand the axis of compression, and see \nthe folds and their many shapes as a consequence of compression, not tension.\nCONVEX AND CONCAVE SURFACES\nA surface can be flat, convex or concave. Because fabric is thin, every fold has a convex “hill” side and a concave \n“valley” side. Whether the surface of a fold is considered convex or concave by an observer depends only on their \nposition relative to the fold (Figure 2.3).\n2.3  Convex surfaces curve out towards us, while concave surfaces curve away from us. Every fold has a convex side and a \nconcave side.\nTHE ANATOMY OF A FOLD\nA simple fold can be formed by taking a flat piece of cloth and bending it so that it no longer forms a plane. The \noutside of a simple fold is like the crest of a hill, while the inside is like a valley. If the cloth is bent sharply to \n180 degrees, the hill becomes a crease, and the valley is now hidden in the interior of the folded cloth.\nA simple fold consists of a set of straight lines crossing a set of curved lines. These lines are related to \nthe shape of the curve and are usually not the same as the warp and weft of woven cloth. The path along the \ncrest of the hill is a straight line. On the reverse side of the cloth, directly opposite this line, is the matching \nstraight pathway at the bottom of a valley. There are an unlimited number of straight paths called length lines \nalong the sides of the hill and the sides of the valley (Figure 2.4). In the case of the cylinder-​like parallel fold, \nthese straight lines are parallel to each other, and all the points along any particular line are at the same “alti­\ntude” on the hill. In the case of cone-​like radial folds, the length lines converge at one point. The pointed end \nof a radial fold is its tail.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

A radial fold consists of radiating length lines and a series of parallel width curves that grow larger at a steady rate.\nThe shortest, most direct path over the hill of a fold is a width curve. There are many such curves and they are \nall parallel to each other. In parallel folds, the width curves are all identical in size. In radial folds, the width curves \nare parallel to each other but are all of different sizes, growing evenly from the tiniest ones where the radial fold \nstarts, to the largest ones at the broad end of the fold.\nIf a fold extends right to the edge of the cloth, then an edge curve will be apparent. If the length lines are at \na right angle to the edge, then the edge curve will also be a width curve. But if the edge is not at a right angle to \nthe length lines, the edge curve will be a longer and more gradual curve. One way to visualize this is to imagine \nslicing a long loaf of bread, such as a baguette. Slicing it at a right angle to its length yields similarly-​sized pieces \nwith matching width curves, but slicing it at a diagonal yields longer pieces with longer curves that are not the \nsame as the width curves.\nEdge curves are an attractive and interesting element of flowing drapery. In general, the edges of garments \nare cut straight, but shawls and dresses can have diagonal edges, and diagonal edges can also arise when cloth is \nhanging at an angle, as for instance a towel slung haphazardly on a rack.\nTHE HINGE LINE AND THE CREASE\nThe straight line that could be drawn on the cloth on the extreme outside of the turn that the fold is making is the \nhinge line of the fold. This line is the fold’s turning point at the outside of the curve. It is similar to the way a door \nangles away from a wall at its hinges as the door is opened (Figure 2.5). The hinge line is always at a right angle to \nthe axis of compression: whenever cloth is compressed, folds are created that have hinge lines that cross the axis \nof compression at 90 degrees.\n \n \n \n",

Slightly curved hinge lines in stretchy fabrics can be straightened in drawings and paint­\nings, because folds often look more attractive if the contrast between the curved and straight parts is exaggerated.\nIf a fold is flattened, a crease is formed exactly where the hinge line is. The term crease applies equally to the \ninside and the outside view. Creases that have been ironed in, such as in pants, are most often seen from the out­\nside. The interiors of creases are occasionally seen in some garments, such as pleated skirts. In skin only the con­\ncave interiors of creases are visible. Creases are found on the palm of the hand, on the inside of the elbow, on the \nface and elsewhere.\nThe straightness of hinge lines in non-​stretchy materials is seen in the edges of cardboard boxes and cartons \nsuch as cereal boxes, where the paper is creased sharply to form the box. Resilient materials such as vinyl do not \nform permanent creases, while non-​resilient materials such as paper do.\nTHE GEOMETRY OF HINGE LINES\nIt is useful to think of parallel folds as being created when cloth is compressed evenly, and to think of radial folds as \nbeing created when cloth is compressed unevenly. Thinking of folds this way is very helpful when deciding where \nto draw folds. Here is a short description of a more geometrical way of looking at folds that is not necessary to \nknow when drawing folds, but may be of interest as background.\nWhen cloth lies flat, the plane that it forms can be called the XY-​plane. The usual way to create a fold is to fold \nthe material over, or in other words to rotate it around a line that is parallel to the XY-​plane. Folds created this way \nare all parallel folds.\nBut the line that the cloth is rotated around does not have to be parallel to the XY-​plane. It can be perpendicular \nto the plane, rising up like a pole, and intersecting the XY-​plane at just one point. This pole is the Z-​axis. If two \npoints in the cloth are rotated towards each other around any Z-​axis that you choose, radial folds will form. These \nradial folds will have several hinge lines. The angles of these hinge lines change as the material is compressed \nfurther (Figure 2.6). This action might seem unlikely, but it regularly happens to cloth on the sides of the joints at \nthe elbows, hips and knees.\n \n \n \n",

Cloth can \nalso be rotated around the Z-axis line that is vertical to the cloth. This creates radial folds that have several hinge lines.\nHow does a radial fold create a hinge line parallel to the Z-​axis? As cloth is compressed by rotating it around the \nZ-​axis, it lifts up into a vertical orientation. The middle area of the rotating cloth rises to a position where a hinge \nline can exist vertically instead of in the original plane of the paper. Now the paper folds easily into a radial fold on \na vertical line (Figure 2.7).\n2.7  Moving two areas in a piece of cloth towards each other by rotating them around a third point that lies in the material forces \na section to rise so a hinge line can form vertically. This is rotation of the cloth about the Z-​axis, and it always forms radial folds.\n \n \n \n",

How an existing fold behaves when there is new compression along its length depends on this \nangle. If the fold has an angle greater than 90 degrees, it is wide. In cross section it resembles a wide letter U. If \nthe curve is at the edge of the cloth, this shape will be seen in the edge curve (Figure 2.8).\n2.8  A fold can be wide and U-​shaped, narrow and V-​shaped, or its wings can curve towards each other and be C-​shaped.\nWide U-​shaped folds are quite weak and easily modified. If subjected to pressure along their length, they open \nfurther and flatten out, often causing the original fold to disappear in a certain section, and a new fold to appear \nacross the new axis of compression. In this case the original simple fold is replaced at this point by a new simple \nfold with a hinge line at a right angle to the original one. This is often seen in the front of the lower pant leg when \nit is compressed upwards by the shoe in pants with no crease.\nA narrow V-​shaped fold has sides making an angle of less than 90 degrees. The limit of this fold is when the \ncloth or paper is flattened so much that the two sides make a 180-​degree turn at the hinge line, and the two wings \nare touching each other. If a narrow fold is compressed along its length, it will not disappear but will buckle instead, \nand become a fold of a fold, or compound fold. Examples include the sides of toothpaste tubes and potato chip \nbags, which are sharply V-​shaped, and which always buckle into compound folds.\nWhen visualizing folds in clothing on a figure in action that you are drawing, whether a fold starts as a wide \nor narrow fold makes a key difference in how the folds will develop and how they should be drawn. Under com­\npression along their length, narrow folds close and buckle, while wide folds open up and fold on a new axis. This \nknowledge is very helpful in creating convincing folds, and will be examined in more detail.\nA circular fold is one which in cross section is C-​shaped, traveling back towards itself in a curve that is more than a \nhalf circle. If the two edges of the fold are sewn together, they form a sleeve. Circular folds are common in curtains and \nin full dresses. Their outer edge is usually rounded like the wide fold, but can also be more compressed like a narrow \nfold. This determines whether a given section of a circular fold flattens or buckles when compressed along its length.\nWhen circular folds occur side by side in curtains and dresses, they interlock, with folds alternating between \nconvex ones pushing outwards and concave ones pushing inwards. In curtains these folds differ from each other in \nsize, but any single fold in the group will be roughly the same size in cross section throughout its length. In dresses \nand robes, the material becomes fuller as it descends, and the folds grow larger further down. Cross sections of \neach of the folds may be small and almost circular closer to the waist, and larger and wider lower down over the leg.\n \n \n \n",

    "chunk_full": "27\nChapter 2 | The Elements of Folds\n27\nWhen an existing narrow fold is bent over into a new compound fold, its hinge line subdivides into two \nshorter hinge lines that meet at an angle. The new second fold has its own hinge line, which is in two parts, \none in each layer of cloth. These lines meet at an angle, and may even be parallel to each other if the com­\npound fold is bent over as far as possible. Where they meet, at the eye of the compound fold, the two parts \nof this new hinge line are connected by a strikingly short turn of the cloth. The two layers of the compound \nfold’s hinge lines meet at the edge by the eye of the fold at exactly the same spot where the two sections of \nthe original simple fold meet at an angle. The hallmark of a compound fold is the eye, where the first fold has \nhad to begin to flatten to accommodate the second fold. While a simple fold has one hinge line, a compound \nfold has four hinge lines.\nA quick test of whether a fold is simple or compound is to check for an eye. This is where the original fold is \nflattening and a small crease has formed. If you look at a piece of paper that has not been handled carefully you will \nsee the permanent creases left behind at the eye of each compound fold. Note that this angle is not the degree of \nthe bend of the second-​order fold, but the partial or complete flattening and turn of the cloth in the original simple \nfold. It forms so that the second-​order fold will have a straight hinge line in both layers of the original fold. All of \nthese hinge lines meet at the edge by the eye.\nWide folds cannot become compound folds. In wide folds compression in two axes will open up the original \nsimple fold, and then the flat area that has been created will bend into a second simple fold at right angles to the \nfirst. The wide fold may reappear further along.\nIn clothing there is always an attractive and complex interplay of simple and compound folds. The many actions \nof the human figure create a rich variety of folds, and the jagged edges of compound folds always form an interest­\ning counterpoint to the smooth, flowing curves of simple folds. Capturing this contrast can be an interesting artistic \npursuit (Figure 2.11).\n2.11  Simple folds have long, smooth, flowing curves, while compound folds are angular. Compound folds have short, \nstraight sections that are connected by small, tight curves that turn quickly. The sharp angles and contrasting values of the \neyes of compound folds attract our attention.\n \n \n",

Its pull causes clothing to sag towards the ground everywhere \nthat it is not well supported by the body beneath it or by its own rigidity. This effect is most obvious in the largest \nand most loose-​fitting garments, like dresses, robes and capes. Gravity creates tension on parts of a garment that \ndangle directly downwards from a higher point of support. Areas of cloth that are supported from above but are off \nto one side swing inwards like a pendulum, compressing the cloth as every suspended part strives to be as directly \nbelow the point of support as possible. This is seen clearly in a towel hanging on a hook. If a garment is supported \nfrom below –​ for instance if it is bunched on the ground –​ then gravity compresses the cloth under its own weight.\nFor garments that are not loose fitting, gravity’s effects are less noticeable. For instance, the folds that form in \na sleeve when the elbow is bent are determined much more by compression than by gravity. The thicker and more \nrigid the fabric, and also the shorter the span of the unsupported cloth, the less effect gravity has on the shape of \nthe folds.\nTHE EFFECTS OF WIND\nWind typically pushes cloth in a horizontal direction, unlike gravity’s vertical effect. The stronger the wind, the more \nit compresses clothing against the body on the windward side, while pushing it outwards on the leeward side. If \nthe wind gets inside the cloth, for instance inside a cape, or blows the laundry on a clothesline, then it makes the \ncloth billow and flutter downwind. Wind has the greatest effect on thin fabric and large, loose-​fitting garments.\nTHE STRENGTH OF FOLDS\nMost thin materials can be folded easily. If something is already folded, the part with the fold is more resistant to \nbeing folded again. Cylinders and cones are structurally strong, and thus cloth in the form of a complete or partial \ncylinder or cone offers some additional resistance to compression, particularly along its length. Cloth is always less \neasily deformed if it is already curved.\nA paper tube can be used to demonstrate the strength of cylinders. If you try to compress is from end to end, \nyou’ll find that it’s difficult. Yet if the tube is cut along its length and opened up, it loses its structural strength, and \ncompressing it becomes very easy. While cloth is much weaker than paper under compression, the principle still \napplies, and cloth that is curved or cylindrical will be more likely to hold its shape.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

If a sheet of paper is formed into a tube, it is a parallel fold. Parallel folds are so named because the \nstraight lines that run along their length are parallel to each other –​ in other words, these lines never meet. All of \nthese length lines are also parallel to the hinge line of the fold. Parallel folds can result from cloth lying over a cylin­\ndrical shape, or from pressure that pushes the material evenly and bends it evenly.\nAn important characteristic of parallel folds is that they stay the same size along their length.

They are seen in a T-​shirt over the abdomen \nwhen the torso is bent forward. They are also found wrapping around the cylindrical parts of the body, notably the limbs.\nTwo parallel folds are parallel to each other if their hinge lines are parallel. A set of neighboring parallel folds is \noften formed when a constraint stops the compression from creating just one large fold. This constraint is typically \ngravity, an object obstructing the fold, or the cloth being held somehow on its sides. For example, cloth that’s lying \nflat on a surface (such as a tablecloth lying on a table) will initially make one fold under even compression, but as \nthe amount of compression increases, more folds will form because gravity is pushing down on the fold, and as the \nfold grows larger, it can’t support its own weight. These folds are parallel to each other because they are all formed \nby the same even compression along their length.\nBeing constrained on the sides can prevent a single fold from continuing to grow larger without subdividing. \nFor example, a pillow folded in the middle could have just one large fold form in its bent center that takes up the \nslack of compression, but the sides of the pillow hold the cloth tight and don’t allow this to happen. This forces \nwhat would be one large fold to become a number of smaller folds that are held closer to the surface of the pillow.\nSIMPLE PARALLEL FOLDS\nA parallel fold will always form when cloth is lying over a cylindrical object. Parallel folds are smooth everywhere \nwith no sudden direction changes. Parallel folds shrink the area of the cloth in only one dimension relative to the \noriginal area of the cloth.\nThe Hinge Line, Length Lines and Width Curves of Parallel Folds\nThe hinge line is the furthest extent to which the cloth in a fold travels in a given direction before the curve of the \nfold sends it in another direction. If you examine a parallel fold, you can also find countless other straight lines run­\nning parallel to the hinge line along the sides of the fold, each one being a certain distance up the hill at the same \naltitude, like a line on a topographic map. These parallel straight lines are the length lines of the fold (Figure 3.2). \nSimilarly, there are countless curved lines that go over the hill and are all parallel to each other. These parallel curves \nare the width curves of the fold. They are at right angles to all the straight length lines and the hinge line. A feature \nof parallel folds is that all of these width curves are identical to each other.\n3.2  The length lines of a parallel fold are parallel to each other. The width curves are identical to each other in size and are \nparallel to each other.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

A piece of cloth that \nhas a striped pattern on it can be folded so that the stripes run as length lines along the fold, or so that the \nstripes all run directly over the fold as width curves. Of course, the cloth could also be angled so that the stripes \ngo over the crest of the fold at an angle, making the curves of the stripes longer and less direct than the width \ncurves are.\nConnected Parallel Folds\nApplying even pressure sometimes causes several parallel folds to form as neighbors in a group. As they interlock \nwith each other, they alternate between having their convex and their concave sides up, in a sequence of hills \nand valleys (Figure 3.3). A common example of connected parallel folds is found in corrugated cardboard, which is \ncomposed of three sheets of paper. The central piece of paper is a series of many small connected parallel folds, \nand this layer is sandwiched between and glued to two flat sheets of paper. The corrugated central sheet makes \nthe cardboard structure rigid and much stronger than it would be otherwise.\n3.3  Connected parallel folds curve up and down like waves. Their hinge lines run alternately in hills and valleys. In the line \ndrawing the valleys are solid and the hills are dotted.\nFlowing Curves\nThe edge of a group of parallel folds makes a winding flowing curve, also called a serpentine curve. This curve can \nbe even or quite irregular. Flowing curves are an attractive element of folds. The curve along the edge may be a \nwidth curve of the fold, or it may be much longer if the edge does not run parallel to the length lines and hinge line \nof the fold (Figure 3.4). If a towel hangs on a rod such that its edges are not square with the floor, then its edge \nfolds will be very long and flowing. This is also true of drapery slung over a shoulder.

In compound folds the edges do not curve smoothly, but \nconsist of short straight segments of varying length that meet at various angles and give a somewhat sawtooth \nappearance to the edge. Often the flowing curves of simple folds contrast with the angular zigzag patterns of \nnearby compound folds.\nCylindrical Cloth Tubes\nComponents of clothing such as sleeves and pant legs are tubes and funnel shapes made of cloth, as are the \nbodies of jackets, coats, skirts, dresses and the fingers of gloves. If two opposite edges of a rectangular piece of \ncloth are sewn together, the result is a cylindrical cloth tube. Of course, the cloth must be supported to maintain \nits cylindrical shape, otherwise it will collapse under the influence of gravity.\nYou can also think of a cloth cylinder as two single folds attached back-​to-​back, or even as four simple folds \nattached to each other. Thinking of sleeves and pant legs as four simple folds joined together can help you more \nclearly imagine what happens to each side of the tube as it is subjected to tension and compression. These folds \nare parallel to each other if the tube is cylindrical, but if the tube is tapered into a slight funnel shape (as sleeves \nand pant legs usually are for a better fit), the simple folds are slightly angled to each other. The more funnel-​shaped \na cloth tube is, the more its parallel folds become radial folds.\nGravity always makes the tube shape of a sleeve or pant leg lie close to the top surface of a limb, and hang \ndown in a parallel fold below the limb. This is important when drawing seated figures and figures with outstretched \narms or legs (Figure 3.5).\n \n \n \n",

But if there \nis enough pressure along its length, it will respond by folding into two or more subsections of the original fold that \nare at an angle to each other. Each place where the original fold buckles is a bent fold, and it is a compound fold \nbecause it is a fold of the original fold (Figure 3.15).\n3.15  Compression along the length of a narrow parallel fold causes buckling and produces bent folds, which are compound \nfolds and have straight sections and sharp turns.\nThese are called bent folds because the subsections that remain are straight and meet at an angle, now hav­\ning an appearance something like a bent rod. The hinge line of this new fold runs across both layers of the original \nfold. Where these two hinge lines meet, there is a sharp crease in the material where the top hinge line connects \nto the lower hinge line by making a dramatic turn at the edge. We often see a bent fold in the crease in a pant leg \nover the shin. The top of the shoe often presses up against the parallel fold of the crease and forces it to fold into \nangled subsections.\nIf a narrow parallel fold is in a horizontal orientation without much support, gravity or another force can make it \nbend. If a bent fold appears to curve as it arcs downward between its two high points of support, you can see on \ncloser inspection that there is not actually a curve but a sequence of fairly straight segments. This is most clear in \nfabrics that have little elasticity. If the fabric is stretchy, the folds are more rounded.\nA half-​empty bag of potato chips that has been rolled up will have bent folds along its sides. Rather than being \na smooth curve, the edges of the package will be rolled in a series of small straight sections at the edge. Collars \nusually have bent folds along their edges. This is because they are first folded over and then they curve around the \nneck, creating compound folds. Bent folds have longer straight sections and are more obvious in thicker fabrics. \nThey are always found in rolled-​up sleeves and in hems.\n \n \n \n",

Often the cloth is constrained \non the left and right, as is the case with sleeves and pant legs. If there is additional compression along the \nfold, it must bend further, but the single bend in the fold cannot push any further to one side because of the \nclothing’s constraints. So one or more additional bends will occur in alternating directions. These are zigzag \nfolds (Figure 3.16).\n3.16  Compression along the length of a parallel fold often causes zigzag folds to form. The segments that arise between \nthe folds are quite straight, and stay narrow and more tightly folded where the distances are short, only becoming broad and \nrounded in longer segments.\nEach bend in a zigzag fold is a compound fold. Each adjoining pair of straight segments meets to form a \nsingle bent fold. At each bend the cloth is flattened to allow for a very straight hinge line in the doubled cloth \nof the original fold. Bent folds and zigzag folds are similar to each other. The only difference lies in whether \nthe angles of the folds alternate or continue to turn in the same direction. Zigzag folds can be found along the \nedges of bags and tubes.\nEach short segment of a zigzag fold maintains the very straight character of the hinge line of the single fold \nthat it was originally, although it will now be more narrow. These segments vary in length. The middle of each \nsegment is less constrained than its ends and retains more of its original rounded shape. This is most true of \nthe longer sections, and is an essential and attractive characteristic of well-​drawn folds. The shortest segments \nare the narrowest, with obvious flattening and minimal flare. The pressure that forms a zigzag fold can be even \nor uneven (Figure 3.17).\n \n \n \n \n",

The rotational compression pulls the cloth around the Z-​axis that is perpen­\ndicular to the plane of the fabric and intersects it at one point. As the radial fold forms, the surrounding cloth is also \ndrawn up. It becomes a larger, shallower radial fold (Figure 4.2).\n4.2  A radial fold will form if cloth is compressed unevenly so that it rotates around the Z-​axis that rises from the cloth. As a \nsmall radial fold forms between the two points that are moving towards each other, the surrounding plane of cloth is drawn up \ninto a broader, shallower second radial fold.\nUneven pressure will create a pair of radial folds: the smaller, sharper and more central primary fold, and a \nbroader and shallower secondary fold surrounding it. These two paired folds share the same point of origin.\nThe tail of a radial fold becomes smaller until its tip disappears into the surface of the cloth at the point \nwhere these neighboring radials begin. As the rotational compression centered on this point continues, \nthe point becomes the eye of a compound fold. The only occasion when one radial fold is not automatically \nseated within another is when there is no point at the end of the radial fold because the cloth does not \nextend that far.\nAlthough the spot where these two paired radial folds meet is a compound fold, it is more important to concen­\ntrate on the larger parts of the radial fold when drawing it.\nThe Hinge Line, Length Lines and Width Curves of Radial Folds\nRecall that the length lines of parallel folds are all parallel to the hinge line, and the width curves are all parallel and \nidentical in size to each other. Radial folds are quite different in character. In every radial fold the length lines all \nradiate from the same point as the hinge line, like spokes, and are not parallel to each other (Figure 4.3).

Radial folds always start \nfrom nothing and grow larger along their length, some quickly and some slowly.

Radial ridge folds often form in broad areas of cloth, as can be found in shirts and coats.\nRadial ridge folds consist of a primary central fold flanked by two small secondary radial folds that allow the \nprimary fold to rejoin the broader surrounding cloth from which the primary fold arises.

This type of radial fold is common at flexed joints. For some radial folds the rotation point is not on \nthe cloth, such as when a blanket is wrapped around someone’s shoulders and forms a funnel shape. In these \ncases the radial fold is not part of a compound fold.\nWith paired radial folds, a small crease appears where the hinge line of the first radial fold is intersected by the \nhinge line of the second fold. This is the eye of a compound fold. The existence of an eye in the fold is always con­\nfirmation that it is a compound fold. The more angular the radial fold, the more dramatic this feature is. In materials \nthat are not resilient, such as paper, many small permanent creases are created by compression due to small radial \nfolds having been formed through rough handling.\nAnother way an existing radial fold can become a compound fold is by being folded either into a cylinder-​like \nparallel fold or into another cone-​like radial fold (Figure 4.11). This may be because the cloth is draped over a \nlimb, or because of compression applied to the cloth. The second fold may be at any angle to the first fold. The \nedge of a compound fold never curves smoothly, but will always curve in a series of short, straight segments \nthat meet one another at abrupt angles. Where these segments meet we see the eyes of compound folds. You \ncan often see compound folds of radial folds in radial ridge folds. Another example is a soft, pointed hat that is \nbent to one side.\n4.11  A radial fold can be folded into a compound fold as either a parallel or a radial fold.\n \n \n \n",

It can become a \nzigzag fold if there is pressure along its length. For instance, along the front of the shin a pair of pants may form a \nlong, thin radial fold that is compressed upwards when it meets the top of the shoe. The simple fold is forced to \ncreate a bent or a zigzag fold.\nThe Same Compound Fold Created in Two Different Ways\nAn interesting observation is that when rotational compression creates a set of two radial folds, it has also cre­\nated a compound fold at its tip in a single step. This is an interesting connection between parallel, radial and \ncompound folds.\nWe normally think of a compound fold as being the result of the two-​step procedure of folding a piece of cloth \nand then folding it again at an angle to the original fold (Figure 4.12).\n4.12  A compound fold can be created in two steps by folding on two intersecting hinge lines in sequence.\nBut a compound fold can be created in just one step as uneven pressure creates a radial fold. A compound fold \nis created by folding the plane first along the X-​axis and then again along the Y-​axis. If instead we compress the \nmaterial by moving the left and right sides towards each other at one end of the cloth, it rotates around the Z-​axis \n(which sticks up like a pole planted in the middle of the cloth). If there is enough compression, the cloth folds over \ninto a familiar compound fold (Figure 4.13). This can easily be demonstrated with a piece of paper.\n4.13  A compound fold can be created in one step by rotating two parts of the cloth together about an axis vertical to the cloth.\n \n \n \n \n \n",

Folds interlock at the line where two broad areas of cloth that are \nat different angles and already contain folds meet. The way in which they interlock has a simple geometry that is \nthe same regardless of whether the folds involved are parallels or radials or both. The zigzagging pattern that occurs \nalong the edge where they meet can vary in size and angularity, and can be even or uneven. There is variety to the \nshapes of interlocking folds in clothing, but the folds follow a simple pattern (Figure 5.1).\n5.1  Interlocking folds occur on the sleeves, under the arms and between the chest and the side of the torso.

Where these two folds meet there is an angle \nchange, as a hill-​side-​up simple fold interlocks with a valley-​side-​up one. This sudden and dramatic inversion of the \nshape of a single fold often occurs when the cloth has curved around a limb (Figure 5.2).\n5.2  An inverted fold suddenly changes from a hill to a valley whose hinge line is angled to the original line. It can also be \nseen as one fold splitting into two.\nAnother way to look at an inverted fold is as a single fold subdividing into two smaller radial folds. These two \nsmaller folds always have a narrower ridge and a more acute angle between the wings because they are more \ntightly spaced than the original fold which, being by itself, did not have to share space with another fold. The valley \nbetween the two radial folds is not as sharp as the two radials themselves.\nAn inverted fold on a sleeve or pant leg is formed in a specific order. The first fold to form is actually the smooth, \ngradual turning of the cloth as it circles the limb. The second fold is caused by compression along the axis of the \nlimb and is angled across the limb. The small parallel folds that start to form to absorb the compression cannot have \nlong hinge lines because they are constrained and cannot move far from the surface of the limb. So they split into \ntwo folds at a new angle that more closely follow the curvature around of the limb. Intricate groups form in this \nway. These folds are found in almost any sleeve.\n \n \n \n",

This creates a zigzag fold along the line. This can be demonstrated by \nbending cloth or paper over the edge of a table, and then compressing it along its hinge line. When drawing inter­\nlocking parallel folds, it’s easiest to draw the zigzag where they interconnect first, and then draw the other folds \nthat meet there.\nInterlocking parallel folds can be found on classic briefcases and on expandable folders. Interlocking folds also \nappear wherever compressed cloth has to curve around a cylindrical shape, such as in sleeves over the arm and \npants over the leg.\nPARALLEL FOLDS INTERLOCK WITH RADIAL FOLDS\nA set of parallel folds will also interlock with a set of radial folds at an angle to it (Figure 5.5).

Drawing individual or small groups of parallel and radial folds can solve the problems of compres­\nsion of cloth in many situations. But sometimes larger groups of folds are necessary, for instance when clothing is \ncompressed at a flexed joint. In these situations, groups of parallel and radial folds work together to provide geo­\nmetrical solutions, and more complex patterns arise. Fortunately, by learning to draw just a few complex folds you \nwill have the skills to deal with many common situations found in clothing.\nThe patterns of complex folds are recognizable and predictable, and they help to make a drawing look natural \nand believable, while accentuating the action of the figure. These patterns recur because the circumstances that \ncause them to form are very common.\nDITCH AND BRIDGE FOLDS\nA wide single fold that is approximately a half cylinder can be compressed from the ends. Often a flattened section \nforms in the middle of this fold, and in this flat area a new hinge line is created (Figure 6.1). The new hinge line \nallows the cloth to adapt to the compression by folding here to whatever degree the compression requires. The \noriginal hinge line running the length of the half cylinder is now broken into two sections that meet at an angle.

Ditch folds can also be found in the leather on \nthe top of a shoe at the point where the toe begins. These are most prominent when the toes are raised, com­\npressing the leather.

Both the front and back of the cylinder try to flatten, and two parallel hinge \nlines form. If bent all the way, the front and back of the cylinder touch each other along the full length of their two \nhinge lines, which are compound folds at their ends.

These folds slide over themselves into S folds. An S fold will often fill a depression on a \nlimb, with the telescoping fold seen running up and over a depression where muscles become tendons, such as \nis found mid-​forearm and mid-​calf. This is useful to know when deciding where to place the telescoping fold on \nthe limb.\nCloth that is thin and flexible will have gently curving telescoping folds, while thicker and less elastic fabrics \nbreak into straighter and bulkier segments. Telescoping folds are found in jacket sleeves, shirtsleeves and pant \nlegs, and also form on the top of a jacket sleeve when an arm is raised.\nTWISTING FOLDS\nWhen cloth is pulled at an angle that causes it to spiral around a tube, twisting folds form. They are like shear \nfolds, with the added characteristic of traveling around the limb. As cloth in a cylindrical fold is pulled in a twisted \nfashion, it is compressed, and we see folds at right angles to this compression.

Both of these shapes are ways \nthat cloth handles simultaneous compression in two axes. It is worthwhile to recap what a sleeve or pant leg does \nwhen subjected to compression along its length. Will it create a zigzag or a bent tube fold?\nClothing mainly consists of tubes and funnel shapes of cloth, so a fold already exists as the curvature of the \ntube shape of a section of a garment. In addition, even a section of cloth in a garment that might be fairly broad, \nsuch as over the back or the chest, usually has ridge folds running down it due to the garment being a little larger \nthan the person wearing it.\nIf we start with a narrow tube or a parallel or radial fold and compress it along its length, it will turn into a zigzag \nfold. But if the fold we start with is wide, the compression along the length of it will create one or more ditch folds \nacross the axis of compression.

How cloth folds as it turns at the floor is not random, yet it has infinite \nvariety, like all folds. A good approach is to use a few common folds in a somewhat random order so that the results \ndo not look contrived or mechanical.\nSuppose several parallel and radial ridge folds in a piece of cloth descend vertically and reach the floor. The \ncloth has to turn. To do so, each fold in the cloth must almost totally flatten itself so it can turn on straight hinge \nlines. Every long dress, messy bedspread, sheet and towel that hits the floor has very flattened folds along the line \nwhere it changes direction.\nThe important general rule for cloth hitting the floor and changing direction from vertical to horizontal is that each \nsection of each fold that makes the turn must have a hinge line that matches the change of direction of the cloth \nat the floor. If the cloth already has many folds in it, this rule is less rigid because all of the slack in the cloth allows \nfor more deviations from being truly parallel to the main fold.\nSimple Folds in Cloth at the Floor Turn\nIn Figure 7.1 a suspended towel reaches the floor and turns evenly in a single fold. It could be a long towel hanging \nevenly from a rack, part of a smooth bedspread, or part of a robe or dress.

The outward-​facing convex ones are linked together by inward-​\nfacing concave folds. For curtains, the parallel ridge folds fall fairly evenly throughout their length; for dresses, the \nradial ridge folds grow as they fall. A couple of these ridge folds can be narrow, and they will start to zigzag as the \nfloor pushes up on them. There should also be one or two wide radial folds whose tails disappear into the cloth at \na point lower down or at the floor turn.\nNear the floor, some narrow ridge folds become zigzag folds that fall to the side to make the turn. A couple of \nnarrow ridges make the turn as bent tube folds. In one spot you can show a zigzag in a concave fold. Even for a long \ndress only a few folds turning at the floor are necessary to give a believable effect. On the floor at the hem there \nshould be a flowing curve that includes some S folds. Some of these folds will be the continuation of hanging ridge \nfolds, while others have tails that disappear into the turn (Figure 7.7).\n7.7  This sketch illustrates several ways that radial ridge folds change as they turn when cloth encounters the floor.\nIf a long dress or robe is worn while walking, the shape of the folds may be influenced by being dragged along \nthe floor, so they will angle back somewhat in the direction the person came from. This will add to the illusion of \nmovement.\nOnce a few of these techniques have been memorized, it can be interesting to design an attractive arrangement \nof drapery in which they work together in a logical way.

The essential rule is that for cloth to turn, it must form a hinge line parallel to the \nedge it crosses. The sharper the turn, the flatter the cloth must be to accomplish this.\nCloth Draped over an Edge at an Angle\nIf a towel is hanging over a rail and is askew, its edge will not be at a right angle to the rail. As it crosses the \nrail and falls down the other side, each edge makes the opposite angle with the rail to its angle on the first side \n(Figure 7.8).\n7.8  If the edge of a towel crosses a rail at a diagonal, it will continue on the other side at the opposite angle.\nAn S Fold Crosses an Edge\nCloth that has been doubled over into an S fold has parallel hinge lines and easily turns over an edge. Only one \nturn of the S will be visible, and we will see the sharp edge of the eye of the compound fold that forms at the turn \n(Figure 7.9).\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

The sharp angle at the eye of the compound fold \ncontrasts with the gentler curve of the simple fold.\nA Rounded Parallel or Radial Fold Crosses an Edge\nOften a blanket, sheet or garment is draped over an edge. Typically the cloth is not smooth, but has long parallel and \nradial ridge folds. As each of these ridge folds crosses the edge and bends downwards, its rounded shape flattens \nso that a hinge line can form. The flattening of each fold causes it to broaden as it crosses the edge (Figure 7.10).\n7.10  Rounded parallel and radial ridge folds often simply flatten at an edge to create a hinge line, and do not tip to the side.\n \n \n \n \n",

In order for a ridge to make this sharp \nturn, it must fall to the side to flatten and form a hinge line parallel to the edge (Figure 7.11).\n7.11  When a ridge fold reaches an edge that the cloth travels over, the ridge flattens so that it has a hinge line that is parallel \nto the fold in the cloth at the edge. After crossing the edge, the ridge fold often springs up again.\nEven if a towel is bunched very irregularly and has many folds, these folds will all flatten when the towel crosses \nan edge and changes direction. Thus when drawing drapery going over an edge, the secret is to flatten all the folds \nas they make the turn. For instance, if you are using your imagination to draw a blanket draped over someone’s \nshoulder, there will be folds of various shapes and sizes in the hanging parts of the blanket, but they will all be flat­\ntened as they cross the shoulder. Some are ridges that go left; some go right; some are radial folds that disappear; \nsome appear like flattened tubes at the shoulder. These flattened folds become ridges again as they hang freely \nbelow the shoulder.\n \n \n \n",

This is because clothing is thin and often follows the body’s contours very closely, and because the size and \nshape of folds is largely determined by the actions of the bones and muscles. When the forms and articulations \nof the figure are well understood, designing folds becomes much easier, and the figures that are revealed by the \ndrapery are more attractive and convincing in their proportions and their action.\nThe human body is like a machine, and anatomy describes its many parts and functions. Because anatomy \nis complex, for drawing purposes it’s best to simplify it in order not to get lost in the details. The bones and \nmuscles of the body can be grouped together into basic shapes that articulate like a mannequin. This group­\ning makes the forms easier to remember and to visualize. A very simplified mannequin-​like mental model \nof the figure can be used at the start, and it can be gradually refined as more is learned about the body’s \nconstruction.\nThis chapter is not a complete look at artistic human anatomy, but focuses on the major shapes, the propor­\ntions, the joints and the mechanisms of the body. There are many books on artistic anatomy, and there are apps \navailable that can be used to explore three-​dimensional views of human anatomy from every angle. But ultimately \nit’s more important for the figures you draw to be convincing than for them to be anatomically accurate in every \ndetail.\nTHE MANNEQUIN\nDrawing the figure from your imagination is equivalent to assembling a mannequin from parts that you have \nmemorized (Figure 8.1). If you are just beginning and the mannequin you’ve memorized is quite simple, then your \ndrawings will look like drawings of a mannequin. Later, when you’ve refined your mannequin through practice and \nstudying anatomy, your mannequin will look like a human figure. By changing the proportions, action and details of \nyour mannequin, you will be able to make it look like different types of people.\nDRAWING \nTHE FIGURE\n8\n \n \n \n \n \n",

The skeleton sets the size, proportions and action of the figure. As you learn more \nabout the skeleton, you may be surprised at the number of places on the figure where the bones are just below \nthe skin. The shape and dimensions of clothing are designed more with the skeleton in mind than with the muscles \nin mind. Most clothing has to accommodate the range of motion of the joints. Some clothing restricts movement, \nfor example skirts and sports jackets.\nThe mannequin is essentially a simplified skeleton with the bones of the limbs made thicker (Figure 8.2). The \narticulations are based on the skeleton, and these have a profound influence on the types of folds that occur at the \njoints when the limbs are flexed.

This everyday observation is confirmed by anthropometric studies of thousands of people. But there is \nalso great variability and significant overlap in the size and proportions of men and women.\nIllustrators often signal whether the people they draw are male or female by using exaggerated proportions that \nwill be instantly understood as male or female, even if real people’s proportions are often not like this. One example \nis long hair: many people will interpret a stick-​figure drawing with long hair as being female, even though millions of \nwomen have short hair and millions of men have long hair. It’s usually a set of such clues that leads the viewer to \ninterpret a figure drawing as being male, female or something else. The typical proportions I describe here are meant \nto help the reader become more aware of these clues in case they would like to incorporate them in their drawings.\nOne’s art is one’s personal domain, and every artist is free to use whatever proportions work for them. When \nI draw figures, I usually want them to be clearly male or female to help my audience instantly understand the story \nbeing told, and thus I caricature them a little.\nExaggerated Proportions of the Male and Female Figures\nWhen drawing figures, it’s helpful to have mental templates of people’s shapes in mind. What I describe here are \nsome of the important proportions that I use to help viewers of my drawings determine whether the figures I’ve \ndrawn are male or female.\nA simplified male figure is keystone-​shaped, with broader shoulders and narrower hips. Men’s necks are often \nalmost as wide as their heads. Men’s physiques can be muscular with an emphasis on squareness, and their \nhands, feet and heads can be large.\nA simplified female figure is more hourglass-​shaped, with the hips a little wider and the shoulders narrower. \nWomen’s limbs and necks tend to be more slender with smoother contours and less apparent muscle mass. Their \nhands, feet and heads are in general not as large as men’s relative to their body size. If these elements are incorpo­\nrated into a sketched figure, it becomes clear whether you have drawn a man or a woman (Figure 8.5).\n8.5  A simplified female figure is based on an hourglass-​shaped torso. The neck and limbs should be slender with smooth \ncontours. The head, hands and feet are not large. A simplified male figure is based on a keystone-​shaped torso. The neck and \nlimbs are larger, more muscular and more angular, and the head, hands and feet are large. Women have more curvature to the \nspine and a slight tilt to the hips.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

One end of each clavicle is \nattached to the ribcage at the pit of the neck, and the other end is attached to the arm via the shoulder blade or \nscapula. This articulation allows the shoulder to move forward, backward, up and down, or in combination, like a \nfishing pole or the arm of a crane (Figure 8.15). When the arms are down, they are far from the midline of the body, \nbut when they are fully raised, they are lengthened by their alignment with the clavicle, and they are much closer \nto the midline.\n8.15  As the arm swings from beside the body to a horizontal outstretched position, it rotates from the shoulder.

Each phalanx is of course still the same length, but skin covers both the exposed \narticular surface of the phalanx it articulates with and the phalanx itself, giving the appearance of a single longer \nphalanx.

A good example is the muscles and tendons on the forearm and hand that flex and extend the fingers \nand thumb. To flex the wrist, the flexor muscles on the wrist side are contracted. The extensor tendons on the \nback of the hand are not used for flexion, but the act of flexing the wrist pulls these idle extensor tendons tight \nbecause they cross the wrist joint, which has bent forward. The result is that as the wrist is flexed, the exten­\nsor tendons on the back of the hand unconsciously extend the fingers and thumb. This is called tendon stretch \n(Figure 8.32).\n \n \n \n",

To draw the folds on a clothed figure requires insight into how folds work, some knowledge of human \nanatomy and a basic understanding of clothing design and construction.\nIn earlier chapters we have examined the various kinds of folds and the mechanisms of the human body. In this \nchapter we use this knowledge to clothe the figure. The basic geometry of the folds of various garments on the \nfigure is standard because people share a common design, and clothing has to fit the human form. The details of \nthe folds in clothing will vary with the type of garment, the style and the fabric, but in similar circumstances fabric \nwill fold in similar ways.\nIn spite of this, there is plenty of opportunity to personalize folds. A zigzag fold, for instance, can be drawn \ncountless different ways and still look convincing. The examples given in this chapter highlight the most important \nfolds as they appear in a standard way, but they can be customized in many ways by changing the style, texture, fit \nand lighting, or by adding additional small secondary folds to create a richer, more detailed appearance.\nCLOTHING CONSTRUCTION\nAn article of clothing is designed with a default pose in mind, and with enough slack for freedom of movement in \na certain range of movement. The size of the person who will wear the garment is also a major consideration, and \nfinally there is sometimes a certain amount of extra cloth in some areas just for style. Extra cloth, whether for a \npractical reason or for style, will form folds even in a garment’s default position, such as a dress having folds even \nwhen the legs of the person wearing it are straight. Movement of the torso and the limbs will change the folds \nand create new ones by pulling on the cloth in some directions and bunching it in others. Much can be learned by \nlooking more closely at your own clothing (Figure 9.1).\nCLOTHING \nAND FOLDS ON \nTHE FIGURE\n9\n \n \n \n \n \n",

The angles that are \nformed when the sections are connected allow clothing to conform to the curvature and tapering of the torso and \nappendages of the body. Seams make the cloth a little stiffer, but usually not enough to interfere much with how \nthe cloth would fold otherwise.\nSleeves, pant legs, skirts, dresses and the body of a shirt, jacket or coat are either cylindrical or funnel-​shaped \ntubes. The cloth that is used to make these cylinders and funnels is generally quite flexible and is typically made \nlarger than the part of the body it envelopes for freedom of movement. This allows a range of actions, such as \nsitting, walking and reaching. If a designer wishes to have a tighter fit that highlights the shape of the body, then \na stretchy knitted fabric is used that will allow the joints to bend while staying close to the body in every pose. \nGarments made from stretchy fabrics have fewer folds.\nIf clothing consisted only of tube-​shaped parts that were not attached to other tubes and didn’t span the joints, \nthen the disconnected sections would leave gaps at the joints, and they would have few folds. Folds are mainly a \nresult of the pulling and pushing of the cloth in the sections where the parts are sewn together and span the joints. \nHere the connected pieces pull on each other when the limbs move.\nArticles of clothing begin as precisely cut flat pieces of cloth that conform to a carefully designed pattern (Figure \n9.2). These are sewn together into the garment’s three-​dimensional shape. A garment that is a good fit is attractive \nand allows for adequate freedom of movement of the limbs for the intended use of the garment. For instance, \nclothing to be worn for physical work must be loose.\n \n \n",

The hole at the top of a \nshirt sleeve is angled, so that when attached to the shirt, it points outward from the body of the garment. This is \nto enable the wearer to move their arm freely in all directions. This causes folds to form under the arm when the \narms are by the side. The sleeve of a jacket, on the other hand, has the hole in the sleeve angled at a diagonal, so \nthat when sewn to the body of the jacket, it lies close to the side of the jacket. When the arms are down, the jacket \nlooks smooth and formal, without folds under the arms. But there is not enough slack in the sleeves to raise the \narms easily. Raising the arms pulls the limited fabric under the arms tight, pulls the sleeves up and makes them \nlook too short, raises the shoulders of the jacket, and create folds on the top of the upper arm.\nFolds sometimes end at seams and pockets, because here the cloth is twice as thick and therefore more resist­\nant to folding. Pockets and seams retain more of their original shape, and the cloth near them may have to fold \nmore to compensate for this. Folds often run to the corners of pockets and end there.\nANCHOR POINTS AND TENSION LINES\nWhen a person adopts a pose, the limbs of the body pull the cloth of their garments in various directions. A point \non the body that pulls the cloth is an anchor point, and a line that runs along the tight, straight fabric between two \nanchor points on the figure is a tension line (Figure 9.4). Usually the tension line runs between two points on the \nfigure, but often gravity acts as the second anchor point as it pulls down on the garment.\n9.4  Clothing is pulled tight between anchor points on the figure that vary depending on the figure’s action. These anchor \npoints are shown as circles. The lines connecting the anchor points indicate where the clothing is pulled tight. When there is \ncompression across a tension line, folds appear that run parallel to that tension line.\n \n \n \n",

Determining \nwhere the anchor points are is done by analyzing the action of the figure being drawn. Drawing a few tension lines \nin the clothing on the figure can quickly increase the illusion of movement while providing a basis for more detailed \nfolds. A tension line looks like a fold only if there is compression across it that creates a fold. Without compression \nacross it, the area around the tension line remains flat.\nSTUDYING TENSION AND COMPRESSION IN A PILLOW\nFolds are created by compression, while tension eliminates folds. When drawing folds, you have to consider where \nthe clothing lies directly and smoothly on the figure, where it is hanging due to gravity, where it’s being pulled tight, \nand where it’s being compressed and bunched by the action of the figure.\nThe body of a shirt or blouse is the large cylindrical section over the torso. Folds appear in shirts when the \nshoulders are moved and when the back is bent. Studying the main folds in a pillow that is bent or twisted provides \ninsight into where folds will occur in a shirt during various actions of the figure.\nThe folds that appear in a pillow in different positions change in their details each time the pillow is repositioned, \nbut the general shape of the folds is predictable. Some simple templates of the main folds can be memorized and \napplied to the torsos of figures drawn from your imagination (Figure 9.5).\n9.5  The folds on a pillow can be studied to gain insight into the folds on the torso in various poses. Compression has caused \nparallel, interlocking, ditch, zigzag and shear folds in these pillows.\n \n \n \n",

If the pillow is doubled over along a vertical axis, horizon­\ntal folds form. If the sides of the pillow are pulled inwards towards each other, this compression on a horizontal axis \ncreates vertical folds. If the pillow is twisted, the cloth is pulled tight along the diagonal between the two opposite \ncorners that have moved apart, but there is now compression between the other two corners that have moved \ncloser to each other, and shear folds form.\nFolds can appear on the sides of the pillow. The side of a pillow is more ridge-​like than the broad front and \nback of the pillow. When one of these ridges is compressed because the upper corner of the pillow on that side is \npushed down, this ridge is likely to change into a zigzag fold or ditch folds.\nFOLDS IN PANTS\nThe Construction of Pants\nA pair of pants is made of two long tubes that unite into one larger tube at the hips. The legs usually taper to the \nankles (Figure 9.6). Pants are designed to be loose enough to allow for sitting and walking. The stretchier the mater­\nial, the less slack is necessary. More casual pants, such as jeans, are usually tighter, the fabric is thicker, and there \nis no front crease, so the pants do not hang freely and have more folds. Women’s pants usually have a tighter fit \nand their hems are further from the floor.\n9.6  A pair of pants is designed as two long tubes that merge into one wider, shorter tube.\nPants are constructed to look best and have the fewest folds when the wearer is standing. Figure 9.7 shows \nthat when the hip and knee joints are flexed, there is rotational compression that creates folds on the inside of the \njoint’s axis, while there is tension on the outside of the axis, which smooths the cloth. This applies to pants, shorts, \nskirts, dresses and robes.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

The tension at the back of the leg pulls down on the hem at the waist and pulls \nup on the hem at the ankle. The pants appear shorter as they ride up the lower leg. The cloth is tight and smooth \non the tense back part of the leg. On the top of the leg, the cloth is compressed and bunched. Notice that the cloth \nalso smooths out where the form of the leg is full, but if it is under tension, it bunches wherever there is a hollow \non the top surface.\nLength change due to joint movement occurs in several places on the body, including the neck, shoulders, arms, \nhands, fingers and feet. This knowledge allows you to predict where tension and compression will occur and where \nto eliminate or create folds.\nHow Folds Are Created When the Knee is Flexed\nWhen the knee is flexed, folds are created in the pant leg. In Figure 9.9 we see that as the leg is bent, the kneecap \nslides down and exposes a new section of the upper leg, thereby lengthening it. The kneecap slides down over the \narticular surface of the upper leg bone. The cloth of the pant leg is not long enough to cover the entire length of \nthe front of the leg now that the leg is a little longer. The tension that results lifts the hem over the shin noticeably.\n9.9  When the knee is bent, the upper leg lengthens by the height of the kneecap, while the back of the leg is shortened by \nthe same amount. This creates tension in the pant leg along the front of the leg and compression along the back.\nAs the knee is bent, the top of the pant leg becomes tight and smooth, while the back surface becomes com­\npressed and bunched on the back of the leg. The small diagonal folds intersecting the seams on the sides of the \nthighs are shear folds that are formed because the cloth on top of the leg is pulled forward, while that on the back \n \n \n \n",

In other words there is tension on a diagonal towards the knee, but compression at a right angle \nto that, causing small parallel folds to form on a diagonal.\nAt the back of the knee a bent tube fold is created when the knee is flexed. Because the volume of the knee \nprevents the hinge lines of the bent tube fold from completely flattening like an aluminum can would, the front \nand back of the bent tube fold are linked by a radial fold on each side of the joint. These two folds spring from the \nkneecap due to the rotation and the uneven compression of the cloth. The radial folds on the two sides are con­\nnected by the ditch fold, as we have seen.\nFolds in Pants When Standing\nThe first row of legs in Figure 9.10 show the typical patterns of folds in pants when standing with both legs straight. \nThere are few folds. When one knee is bent, more folds form. Where they are placed is determined by considering, \nat each joint, how the cloth is forced to change from its default shape.

For example, a medium-​weight fabric \nwith no crease will form a ditch fold at the foot when standing if there is a slight amount of compression. A pressed \npair of pants will not form a bent tube but will instead form a zigzag fold because the ridge fold is narrow. The \nnumber of angles in the zigzag fold depends on how much slack there is in the cloth of the pant leg: the less slack, \nthe more segments the zigzag fold has.\nFigure 9.13 shows six folds that commonly occur in pant legs at the ankle.

Knowledge of anatomy and folds in the skin of the hands helps determine where to put the \nfolds and creases to make the hands more lifelike. Gloves have folds in the same places as skin, but they are often \nlarger because they use thick material and have a loose fit. Because latex gloves are thin, tight-​fitting and stretchy, \nthey form folds that are very much like the folds in skin.\nThe skin of the hand can be thought of as a tight-​fitting garment. It can stretch to a small degree to accom­\nmodate some of the mobility of the fingers and thumb. There is also extra skin at the knuckles and between the \nfingers to allow for flexing and spreading the fingers and thumb.\nSmaller versions of many of the folds found in clothing can also be found in the skin of hands. Some of these \nfolds are more obvious than others, and in the case of a young child, the elasticity of the skin and fat deposits may \nprevent some of the folds from forming. Skin loses some of its elasticity due to aging, making the skin looser and \nresulting in more folds in all hand positions.\nTHE BACK OF THE HAND\nThere is extra skin on the back of the hand to allow the fingers to be spread. It forms small folds when the fingers \nare not spread, as shown in Figure 10.1. The fingers look longer on the back of the hand than on the palm side.

When it is contracted, it creates horizontal parallel folds across the forehead. The muscles of the forehead \ndraw the skin of the forehead and eyes upward, which opens the eyes wider and creates horizontal parallel folds \nand wrinkles in the skin of the forehead (Figure 11.8).\n \n \n \n",

Contraction also causes the eyebrows to \nrise and the eyes to open wider.\nFOLDS OF THE FACE IN YOUTH AND AGE\nThe folds in the skin of the face become more pronounced as a person ages. Over time this repeated folding of the \nskin results in permanent wrinkles and furrows. Because aging skin is less elastic and less resilient, it sags more \nunder the influence of gravity. The facial fat in a heavier person will tend to make the folds and wrinkles smoother \nand less prominent (Figure 11.9).\n11.9  The main folds on the face are the same for all ages, but they become deeper with time and persist as furrows and \nwrinkles even when the muscles are not contracted. As people age, additional smaller related folds and wrinkles form because \nskin becomes weathered and less resilient.\n \n \n \n \n",

What \nchanges is mainly the number of folds and wrinkles and their proportions. It’s good practice to sketch smiling faces \nand attempt to get the various parts of the face to work together in a smile (Figure 11.10).\n11.10  The main elements of a smile are the same on all faces.

The information \npresented here is very important to the rendering of realistic folds in all their beauty, subtlety and three-​dimension­\nality. I have covered the most important elements of light and shade here, but this topic is not explored to the same \ndepth that folds are. There are many books available dedicated to light and shade and color.\nFolds have a great variety of rounded surfaces and both abrupt and slight angle changes. To properly shade \ndrawings of folds requires small and precise variations in value based on an understanding of light. There are only a \nfew important concepts to learn, but they must be applied consistently to achieve a convincing effect. These subtle \nvalue changes can be time-​consuming to create, but if the right values are not used, a three-​dimensional effect is \nnot achieved.\nWhat viewers subconsciously expect is that there be logic to the behavior of light and shade in drawings and \npaintings, and when this logic is not there, interpreting the forms becomes more difficult. This can be an obstacle \nto understanding the story that the art is trying to tell. My drawings throughout this book are examples of methodi­\ncally applying the concepts I describe here to the rendering of folds, and the result is that the forms illustrated can \nbe understood easily.\nTWENTY ILLUSTRATIONS EXPLAINING LIGHT \nAND SHADE\nIn order to be seen, objects must be illuminated by one or more light sources. The light that hits an object is \nreflected in many directions, and some of it reaches the observer’s eyes. The amount of light reflected from a sur­\nface to the observer’s eyes depends mainly on the strength and distance of the light source, the reflectivity of the \nobject, and the angle of each plane of the object relative to the light source and the observer’s eyes.\nWhen shading a drawing is done from the imagination, every angle of every surface has to be considered to \njudge how much light would reach that area, and how much would be reflected to the observer’s eyes. This task is \nmade much simpler by restricting your palette of tones to just a few values, often no more than nine. On rounded \nsurfaces two adjacent tones can later be blended for a smooth transition.\nLIGHT AND SHADE\n12\n \n \n \n \n",

The \nbest way to light an imaginary scene convincingly is to apply these principles very consistently when shading your \ndrawing (Figures 12.1 through 12.20).\n12.1  LIGHT, SHADOWS AND PLANES: As an object’s planes angle away from the main light source, they usually appear \nless bright, and if no direct light hits them, they are in shadow. Usually there is light reflected from the sky, walls or other objects \nilluminating the shadows. The edges of the planes can be blended to suggest roundness.\n12.2  LIGHT ON BASIC SHAPES: Light shines on surfaces and is reflected to the eye. Even slight differences in the angles \nof the planes on an object change the value of the light that is reflected.\n \n \n \n",

Our two eyes each see the same angular edge, but when looking at a rounded form, they see two \nslightly different edges. This difference is approximated by using sharp edges when painting angular forms and using blurry \nedges when painting rounded forms.\n175\n \n",

Usually there is one dominant light \nsource, but the sky, walls and other objects will reflect light to the shadow side of objects, and even into cast shadows. When \nusing color, consideration must be given to whether the reflected light source has a color in it that will reflect from the surface \nin shadow. For instance, a blue sky will make shadows on snow very blue, but will make the shadow side of red and green \nobjects dull.\n12.5  GRADATIONS OF REFLECTED LIGHT: The ground is an important source of reflected light. It will often cause a \ngradation of values on people and vertical objects such as trees, poles and both interior and exterior walls. Exaggerating this \neffect adds to the three-​dimensionality of objects, including folds, and enhances the composition.\n176\n \n \n",
