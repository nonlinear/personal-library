I devoured Dover’s volumes on\nmazes, the fourth dimension, infinity, and language games—all of these to\nbecome lifelong interests.\n\nMy _Fourth Dimension_ has been one of my best-selling books, with translations\nappearing in France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Germany, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, and spain. I’m very pleased that Dover is republishing it in\npaperback and ebook editions.\n\nThe fourth dimension is a universal skeleton key, applicable to any number of\nconundrums. I always start with the hallowed _Flatland_ analogy: 4-D is to 3-D\nas 3-D is to 2-D. By now, good old A Square feels like a friend of mine, or\nperhaps an eccentric cousin. Eventually I went so far as to write a novel\ncalled _Spaceland_ , featuring a man named Joe Cube. He begins in our normal\nworld, encounters a four-dimensional being, and travels into higher space. It\nwas an interesting challenge for me to visualize what he saw there. As usual,\nmy starting point was _Flatland_.\n\nI’m glad to have had the fourth dimension in my life for so many years. And\nI’m happy to share this higher knowledge with you.\n\nWelcome to _The Fourth Dimension_!\n\nRudy Rucker\n\nJune 22, 2014\n\n\n**Foreword**  \nby Martin Gardner\n\nAs WRITERS, mathematicians are notoriously inept. There are happy exceptions,\nof course, and at least one teacher of mathematics, Lewis Carroll, wrote\nimmortal fantasy fiction. Eric Temple Bell not only wrote colorfully about\nmathematics for laymen, but under the pseudonym John Taine he churned out a\nraft of science fiction novels. In more recent times, several professional\nmathematicians have written science fiction with strong mathematical\nunderpinnings. Now along comes Rudolf von Bitter Rucker — mathematician,\nnovelist, cartoonist, rock music buff, and a thinker with the courage to\nexplore dark and unfamiliar territory in what he likes to call the mindscape.\n\nRucker’s major mathematical interests are transfinite sets (he has a doctorate\nin mathematical logic from Rutgers) and spaces of higher dimensions. After\nediting a selection of Charles Hinton’s writings about the fourth dimension,\nand writing a popular account of four-space and relativity, Rucker’s first big\nsuccess came in 1982 with the publication of _Infinity and the Mind._ Science\nfiction fans had earlier known him for his wild, funny, sexually outrageous\nnovels and stories in which higher spaces often play essential roles. His\nbest-known novel, _White Light_ , actually has the subtitle _What Is Cantor’s\nContinuum Problem_? The subtitle is the exact title of a paper by the eminent\nlogician Kurt Gödel, with whom Rucker had the privilege of many stimulating\nconversations.\n\n _The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality_ will be eagerly\nread by writers and readers of science fiction, but anyone with even a minimal\ninterest in mathematics and fantasy will find the book as informative and\nmind-dazzling as Rucker’s book on infinity. After exploring the whimsical\nunderworld of Flatland, he plunges into spaces above three with a zest and\nenergy that is breathtaking. The book is interspersed with clever problems for\nthe mathematically competent, and finally, in a grand Carrollian climax,\nRucker boldly invades the infinite dimensions of Hilbert space.\n\nScience fiction? In part, yes, and Rucker pauses frequently to quote from some\nof his bizarre tales. But without the tool of infinite-dimensional spaces,\nmodern physics would be almost impossible. Older books on quantum mechanics\ntalk about how the measurement of particles and quantum systems “collapses the\npsi function.” More recent books prefer the language of a complex Hilbert\nspace, an approach adopted by John von Neumann in his classic work on quantum\ntheory. When you measure a quantum system you are said to “rotate the state\nvector,” an abstract line of precisely defined length and orientation that\nrepresents the system’s state in a set of coordinate systems that constitute a\nHilbert space. Are such spaces “real”? Or are they no more than convenient\nfictions used by physicists to simplify their calculations?\n\nIt is with such deep ontological questions that Rucker concerns himself\nthroughout this book and especially in the final chapters. Here I am unable to\ngo along with his “All is One” philosophy. He seems to have inherited a\ngenetic fondness for the Absolute from his great-great-great-grandfather, the\nfamous philosopher Hegel. Like William James, I do not know if ultimate\nreality is One or Many. Nor can I accept Rucker’s views on synchronicity,\ntaken over from Jung and Koestler, and his seeming belief that consulting the\n_I Ching_ is more likely to produce meaningful “coincidences” than consulting\nsay, Homer, the Bible, or the works of Isaac Asimov.\n\nBut no matter. We are each entitled to what fames called our “over beliefs.”\nWhether you agree or disagree with Rucker’s Tao-tinged metaphysics, you will\nfind his speculations twisting your mind toward fundamental questions that\nrefuse to go away no matter how hard pragmatists and positivists try to banish\nthem.\n\n\n**Preface**\n\nIN 1958, the Louisville Free Public Library had a single shelf of science\nfiction books. My friend Niles Schoening and I used to read and discuss them,\nwondering about time travel, wondering about the fourth dimension. This is\nwhere it all began.\n\nWhen I went off to college in 1963, my father, Embry Rucker, gave me a copy of\nEdwin Abbott’s _Flatland_. As an Episcopal priest, my father had already\nrealized that the fourth dimension can serve as a symbol for higher spiritual\nrealities.\n\nIn the ensuing years, I puzzled over the relationship between the fourth\ndimension as _higher reality_ , and the fourth dimension as _time_. When I got\nmy first teaching job, at SUNY Geneseo, I began working out these connections\nin my lectures for a course on higher geometry. These lectures were published\nby Dover Publications in 1977, under the title _Geometry, Relativity and the\nFourth Dimension_.\n\nIn the seven years since then, I’ve learned a lot more about the fourth\ndimension. In writing _The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher\nReality_ , I’ve tried to present a definitive and popular account of what the\nfourth dimension means, both physically and spiritually. I am grateful to\nMartin Gardner for lending me a number of rare books on the fourth dimension;\nto Thomas Banchoff for his help with the more technical research; to my\neditor, Gerard Van der Leun, for his encouragement; and to my illustrator,\nDavid Povilaitis, for his wit and weirdness.\n\nMost of all, I would like to thank my family, my friends, my students, and my\ncorrespondents. Enjoy the book!\n\n\n## Part I\n\n## THE  \nFOURTH  \nDIMENSION\n\n\n## 1\n\n## A New Direction\n\nIS THIS ALL THERE IS? Struggle, loneliness, disease, and death … Is this all\nthere is? Life can seem so chaotic, so dreary, so grindingly hard. Who among\nus has not dreamt of some higher reality, some transcendent level of meaning\nand peace?\n\nThere actually _is_ such a higher reality … And it is not so very hard to\nreach. For many, the fourth dimension has served as a gateway into it. But\nwhat is the fourth dimension?\n\n![img](Images/p003_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 1. A new answer for old questions._\n\nNo one can point to the fourth dimension, yet it is all around us.\nPhilosophers and mystics meditate upon it; physicists and mathematicians\ncalculate with it. The fourth dimension is part and parcel of many respected\nscientific theories, yet it is also of great use in such disreputable fields\nas spiritualism and science fiction.\n\nThe fourth dimension is a direction different from all the directions in\nnormal space. Some say that time is the fourth dimension … And this is, in a\nsense, true. Others say that the fourth dimension is a hyperspace direction\nquite different from time … This is also true.\n\nThere are, in fact, many higher dimensions. One of these higher dimensions is\ntime, another higher dimension is the direction m which space is curved, and\nstill another higher dimension may lead toward some utterly different\nuniverses existing parallel to our own.\n\n![img](Images/p003_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 2. Where is it_?\n\nAt the deepest level, our world can be regarded as a pattern in infinite-\ndimensional space, a space in which we and our minds move like fish in water.\n\nOrdinarily, of course, we say that we live in three-dimensional space. What\nprecisely is meant by this? Why _three_? Watch the wheeling flight of swallows\nchasing gnats at dusk. Mathematically speaking, these lovely sweeping curves\nare of great complexity. But it is possible to break any such space curve down\ninto three types of motion: east / west, north / south, and up / down. By\ncombining the three mutually perpendicular types of motion, one can trace out\nany possible curve in our space. _No more than three_ directions are needed,\nand _no less than three_ directions will do — hence we call our space _three_\n-dimensional.\n\n![img](Images/p004_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 3. Etch-A-Sketch drawing of A Square._\n\nAnd when we shall see or feel ourselves in the world of four dimensions we\nshall see that the world of three dimensions does not really exist and has\nnever existed; that it was the creation of our own fantasy, a phantom host, an\noptical illusion, a delusion — anything one pleases excepting only reality.\n\nP. D. OUSPENSKY,\n\n_Tertium Organum,_ 1912\n\nThis fact is illustrated in two dimensions by a toy that was popular a few\nyears ago, the Etch-A-Sketch. The underside of the Etch-A-Sketch’s glass\nscreen is covered by some silvery dust. Turning the knobs moves a stylus under\nthe screen, and the stylus scrapes off dust, leaving dark trails. The left-\nhand knob moves the stylus in the left / right direction, and the right-hand\nknob moves the stylus in the up / down direction. If one twists the two knobs\nat the same time, one can draw any two-dimensional curve at all.\n\nIt is not too hard to imagine a three-dimensional Etch-A-Sketch that would,\nlet us say, move a brightly flaring sparkler about in a dark room. As the\nimage of a sparkler stays on the retina for a few seconds, one could thus have\nthe experience of seeing three-dimensional curves generated by twiddling three\ndifferent knobs: left / right, up / down, and back / forth.\n\nSpeaking of sparklers, there is a nice picture inside the cover of the Rolling\nStones album _Black and Blue._ It is a time exposure of the five Stones waving\nsparklers. Bill Wy-man traces a flat, tightening spiral. Ronnie Wood produces\na messy figure eight. Charlie Watts slowly and patiently draws a big letter\n_O_. Keith starts out high and lets the sparkler fall in a tired zigzag. And\nMick … Ah, Mick … Mick traces the only truly three-dimensional curve in the\ngroup: a complex rodeo pattern of swoops and loops. Waving sparklers in the\ndark is a good way to really savor our space’s three-dimensionality.\n\n![img](Images/p005_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 4. Two degrees of freedom on a curved surface._\n\nAnother way of expressing all this is to say that motion in our space has\n_three degrees of freedom._ At any instant, a bird has three essentially\ndifferent ways to alter its flight: speed up / slow down, wheel left / wheel\nright, climb / dive. Although we can wave our sparklers with just as much\nfreedom, we cannot really move our bodies around in this way. Someone hiking\nin the hills moves up and down with the roll of the land … Yet in terms of\ncontrol, he has only _two_ degrees of freedom: forward / backward, and left /\nright. One can, of course, jump up and down a bit, but because of gravity, the\neffects of this are more or less negligible.\n\nThe point I am making here is that in terms of degrees of freedom, motion on\nthe Earth’s bumpy surface is basically two-dimensional. The surface itself is\na curved three-dimensional object, granted. But any motion that is confined to\nthis surface is essentially a two-dimensional motion. It could be that\nmankind’s perennial dream of flight is a hunger for more dimensions, for more\ndegrees of freedom. The average person only experiences three-dimensional body\nmotion when he or she swims underwater.\n\nDriving a car involves sacrificing yet another degree of freedom. One speeds\nup or slows down (possibly even reversing direction), but that’s all. The road\nitself is a space curve in three-dimensional space, but motion that is\nconfined to this particular curve is basically one-dimensional.\n\n![img](Images/p006_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 5. One degree of freedom on a curved line._\n\nLet us assume that the three dimensions of space are visualized in the\ncustomary fashion, and let us substitute a color for the fourth dimension.\nEvery physical object is liable to changes in color as well as in position. An\nobject might, for example, be capable of going through all shades from red\nthrough violet to blue. A physical interaction between any two bodies is\npossible only if they are close to each other in space as well as in color.\nBodies of different colors would penetrate each other without interference …\nIf we lock a number of flies into a red glass globe, they may yet escape: they\nmay change their color to blue and are then able to penetrate the red globe.\n\nHANS REICHENBACH,\n\n_The Philosophy of Space and Time,_ 1927\n\nAs we will see later, the space we live in is also curved: curved like a\nhillside, twisted like a mountain road. But, in terms of _degrees of freedom,_\nit is clear that our space is three-dimensional. Another way of expressing\nthis is to point out that we can give any location above the Earth’s surface\nby using _three_ numbers: longitude, latitude, and height above sea level.\nAgain, if we’re both in a city, I might typically tell you how to find me by\ngiving you _three_ bits of information. “Walk four blocks uptown, turn right\nand go two blocks crosstown, then go in the building there and ride the\nelevator to the twenty-fifth floor.”\n\nNow, if our space were four-dimensional, such instructions would usually need\na fourth component. “Get out of the elevator and shift through six levels of\nreality.” just as there are many floors over a given location on a city’s two-\ndimensional street grid, we can abstractly imagine there being many different\n“reality levels” available at each of our space locations. In a sense this is\ntrue … Even though we’re in the same room, I might ask, “Where’s your head\nat?” in an effort to get into closer contact.\n\nLet us pursue this line of thought a bit further. Imagine that objects in\nspace could exist at different reality levels, and to make it quite concrete,\nsuppose that each level has its characteristic color — ranging from red\nthrough green to blue. Assume that objects interact only with objects of the\nsame color. A person on the twenty-fifth floor will not stumble over someone\non the second floor; we propose that a blue person can pass right through a\ngreen person.\n\nIn this example, _reality level_ or _color_ would constitute a fourth\ndimension. The three space dimensions plus the color dimension would make up a\nsort of four-dimensional space. A typical person would probably exist on\nseveral levels at once. Waving a four-dimensional sparkler here would involve\nhaving the light’s color, or reality level, change in some complicated way.\nThis would be one way of beginning to think about a four-dimensional space.\n\nAnother, somewhat similar, approach is to propose using _time_ as a fourth\ndimension. If, after all, I really want to see you, it is not enough to tell\nyou how many blocks and how many floors to travel. I need to tell you _how\nsoon_ to show up. Maybe I will not be at the rendezvous for another hour … And\nmaybe I’ll then stay there for only fifteen minutes. To really specify an\nevent, it is not enough to give its longitude, latitude, and height above sea\nlevel. One must also state _when_ it occurs. Just as a blue person can walk\nthrough a green person, a 2:00 A.M. person can walk through a 6:00 P.M.\nperson. In terms of the waving sparklers, the dimension of time comes into\nplay when one notes how _rapidly_ the sparkler moves along each part of its\npath.\n\nBut somehow it misses the mark to represent the fourth dimension by reality\nlevel, by color, or by time. What is really needed here is the concept of a\nfourth _space_ dimension. It is very hard to visualize such a dimension\ndirectly. Off and on for some fifteen years, I have tried to do so. In all\nthis time I’ve enjoyed a grand total of perhaps fifteen minutes’ worth of\ndirect vision into four-dimensional space. Nevertheless, I feel that I\nunderstand the fourth dimension very well. How can this be? How can we talk\nproductively about something that is almost impossible to visualize?\n\nThe key idea is to reason by analogy. The fourth dimension is to three-\ndimensional space as the third dimension is to two-dimensional space.\n4-D:3-D::3-D:2-D. This particular analogy is one of the oldest head tricks\nknown to man. Plato was the first to present it, in his famous allegory of the\ncave.\n\n![img](Images/p008_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig._ 6\\. _Plato’s Cave._\n\nSOCRATES: And now, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened\nor unenlightened: — Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which\nhas a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they\nhave been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that\nthey cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains\nfrom turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a\ndistance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and\nyou will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen\nwhich marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the\npuppets.\n\nGLAUCON: I see.\n\nS: And do you see men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels,\nand statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various\nmaterials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others\nsilent.\n\nG: You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.\n\nS: Like ourselves; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one\nanother, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?\n\nG: True; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never\nallowed to move their heads?\n\nS: And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only\nsee the shadows?\n\nG: Yes.\n\nS: And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose\nthat they were naming what was actually before them?\n\nG: Very true.\n\nS: And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other\nside, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke that\nthe voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?\n\nG: NO question.\n\nS: To them, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the\nimages.\n\nG: That is certain.\n\nPLATO,\n\n_The Republic,_ circa 370 B.C.\n\nHere Plato asks us to imagine a race of men who are chained up in an\nunderground den, chained in such a way that all they can ever look at is\nshadows on their cave’s wall. Behind the men is a low ramp, and behind that a\nfire. Objects move back and forth on the ramp, and the fire casts shadows of\nthese objects on the cave’s wall. The prisoners think that these shadows are\nthe only reality … They do not even realize that they have three-dimensional\nbodies. They talk to each other, but hearing the echoes bounce off the wall,\nthey assume that they and their fellows are also shadows.\n\nThere are several interesting features in Plato’s allegory. It is particularly\nstriking that the prisoners actually think that they are their own shadows.\nThis is interesting because it suggests the idea that a person is _really_\nsome higher-dimensional soul that influences and watches this “shadow world”\nof three-dimensional objects.\n\nTo bring this particular idea home, let us update Plato’s cave allegory a bit.\nImagine a very large TV screen that displays full-color computer-generated\nimages of people and objects moving about. Now imagine some people who have\nfrom birth been chained motionless in front of the giant tube. Electrodes run\nfrom their nervous systems to the image-generating computer, and for each\nperson there is a particular TV personality he or she can control. These\nprisoners would mistake the flat phosphorescent TV screen for reality.\n\n![img](Images/p009_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 7. Plato’s Cave II._\n\nSo, one conclusion to draw from Plato’s allegory is that we should not be too\nsure that our everyday view of the world is the most correct and most\ncomprehensive view possible. Common sense can be misleading, and there may be\na great deal more to reality than meets the eye.\n\n[PUZZLE 1.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch1pa1)\n\n_Stare out your window and imagine that the objects you see are actually two-\ndimensional shapes embedded in the window glass. The window glass is thus a\nsort of two-dimensional world. Under what condition can, say, two car shapes\nmove through each other without collision_?\n\nAn even more important aspect of Plato’s allegory is that this allegory\nintroduces the notion of a two-dimensional world. Insofar as the prisoners in\nthe cave really think that they are shadows on the wall, they are viewing\nthemselves as two-dimensional patterns. What would it be like to be a two-\ndimensional being? Would a two-dimensional being be able to imagine a third\ndimension?\n\n![img](Images/p010_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 8. A Square._\n\nIn the next chapter we will talk about an imaginary two-dimensional world\nknown as Flatland; and we will study the adventures of A Square, Flatland’s\nmost famous citizen. A Square’s path to an understanding of the third\ndimension is, we will see, a guide for our own attempts to understand the\nfourth dimension.\n\n\n## 2\n\n## Flatland\n\nF _LATLAND ,_ first published in 1884, is the story of a square who takes a\ntrip into higher dimensions. A century has passed and people are still talking\nabout it. The author of _Flatland_ was a Victorian schoolmaster named Edwin\nAbbott Abbott. Given the curious fact that his middle and last names were\nidentical, it seems possible that Abbott might have been nicknamed _Abbott_\nSquared or _A_ Squared. Thus, it may be that Abbott felt a considerable degree\nof identification with A Square, the hero of _Flatland._ After all, Abbott’s\nlife was, in some ways, as strictly regulated as the life of a two-dimensional\nFlatlander.\n\nEdwin Abbott Abbott was born in London on December 20, 1838, the son of Edwin\nAbbott, head of the Philological School at Marylebone. Abbott attended the\nCity of London School as a boy. He went on to Cambridge, was ordained a\nminister, was married, and at the age of twenty-seven returned to the City of\nLondon School as headmaster. He wrote a number of books on grammar and\ntheology, books with titles like _How to Parse_ and _Letters on Spiritual\nChristianity. Flatland_ was his one venture into fantasy.\n\nThe book works on three levels. Most obviously, it is a satire on the staid\nand heartless society of the Victorians. “Irregulars” (cripples) are put to\ndeath, women have no rights at all, and when A Square tries to teach his\nfellows about the third dimension he is imprisoned. The second level of\nmeaning in _Flatland_ is scientific. By thinking about A Square’s difficulties\nin understanding the third dimension, we become better able to deal with our\nown problems with the fourth dimension. Finally, at the deepest level, we can\nperhaps view _Flatland_ as Abbott’s circuitous way of trying to talk about\nsome intense spiritual experiences. A Square’s trip into higher dimensions is\na perfect metaphor for the mystic’s experience of higher reality.\n\n![img](Images/p012_1.jpg)\n\n_Edwin Abbott Abbott (1838-1926)_\n\nI call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its nature\nclearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in Space.\n\nImagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares,\nPentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their\nplaces, move freely about, on or in the surface, but without the power of\nrising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows — and you will then\nhave a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few years\nago, I should have said “my universe” but now my mind has been opened to\nhigher views of things.\n\nEDWIN A. ABBOTT,\n\n_Flatland,_ 1884\n\nFlatland is a plane inhabited by creatures that slide about. We might think of\nthem as being like coins on a tabletop. Alternatively, we could think of them\nas colored patterns in a soap film, or ink spots in a sheet of paper.\n\nIn Flatland, the lower classes are triangles with only two sides equal. The\nupper classes are regular polygons, that is, figures with all sides equal. The\nmore sides one has, the greater one’s social standing. The highest caste of\nall consists of polygons with so many sides that they are indistinguishable\nfrom perfect circles.\n\nAs mentioned above, _Flatland_ is more than just a book about dimensions. In\nsomewhat the same manner as _Gulliver’s Travels,_ it satirizes the attitudes\nof the society in which its author lived. In our Western culture, women have\nprobably never been at such a disadvantage as in the nineteenth century.\nAccordingly, the women of Flatland are not even skinny triangles: they are but\nlines, infinitely less respected than the priestly circles. Abbott, of course,\nrealizes the injustice of this. When a sphere from “Space-land” visits\nFlatland, he has this to say: “It is not for me to classify human faculties\naccording to merit. Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more of\nthe affections than of the understanding, more of your despised Straight Lines\nthan of your belauded Circles.”\n\n![img](Images/p013_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 9. Eight Flatlanders: Woman, Soldier, Workman, Merchant, Professional\nMan, Gentleman, Nobleman, High Priest._\n\nI take the plane upon which my shadow-man is, and move it through three\ndimensions. Thus the shadow-man perceives this third dimension. The man\nhimself may be changed, and, at the end of his trip be pale and rumpled, when\nhe had started the trip rosy and flat.\n\nGUSTAV THEODOR FECHNER,\n\n“Why Space Has Four Dimensions,” 1846\n\nAn initial question about Flatland is the problem of how these lines and\npolygons can see anything at all. If you were to put a number of cardboard\nshapes on a tabletop and then lower your eye to the plane of the table, you\nwould really see just a bunch of line segments. How can Flatlanders tell a\ntriangle from a square? How do they build up the idea of a two-dimensional\nworld from their one-dimensional retinal images?\n\nAbbott reports that the space of Flatland is permeated with a thin haze.\nBecause of this, the glowing sides of the polygons shade off rapidly into\ndimness. If you are looking at the corner of a triangle and the corner of a\npentagon, you can tell them apart because the triangle’s sides shade off more\nrapidly.\n\nThis may seem a bit artificial, but just stop to consider this: _our_ retinal\nimages of the world are two-dimensional patterns, yet we can distinguish a\nwide range of three-dimensional objects. If I look, for instance, at a sphere\nand a flat disk, I can tell them apart by their shading. Another important way\nin which we notice our world’s three-dimensionality is by the fact that\nobjects can move _behind_ and _in front of_ each other. If, looking out a\nrestaurant window, I see a person walk in front of my car, I do not assume\nthat he is somehow dematerializing my car. I recognize that there is a third\ndimension of space, and that in this dimension the sidewalk is closer than the\nstreet. Just as we can build up a mental image of our three-dimensional world,\nthe Flatlanders have adequate images of their two-dimensional world.\n\n![img](Images/p014_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 10. Depth is simpler than dematerialization._\n\nThis great man was used to say that, as we can conceive beings (like\ninfinitely attenuated bookworms in an infinitely thin sheet of paper) which\npossess only the notion of space of two dimensions, so we may imagine beings\ncapable of realising space of four or a greater number of dimensions.\n\nSARTORIUS VON\n\nWALTERSHAUSEN,\n\n_Biography of Carl Friedrich Gauss,_ 1860\n\nA Square’s dimensional adventures begin when he has a dream, a dream of\nLineland:\n\nI saw before me a vast multitude of small Straight Lines (which I naturally\nassumed to be Women) interspersed with other Beings still smaller and of the\nnature of lustrous points — all moving to and fro in one and the same Straight\nLine, and, as nearly as I could judge, with the same velocity.\n\nA noise of confused multitudinous chirping or twittering issued from them at\nintervals as long as they were moving; but sometimes they ceased from motion,\nand then all was silence.\n\nApproaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women, I accosted her,\nbut received no answer. A second and a third appeal on my part were equally\nineffectual. Losing patience at what appeared to me intolerable rudeness, I\nbrought my mouth into a position full in front of her mouth so as to intercept\nher motion, and loudly repeated my question, “Woman, what signifies this\nconcourse, and this strange and confused chirping, and this monotonous motion\nto and fro in one and the same Straight Line?”\n\n![img](Images/p015_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 11. Abbott’s drawing of Lineland._\n\n“I am no Woman,” replied the small Line: “I am the Monarch of the world.”\n\nAlthough all the Linelanders can see of each other is a single point, they\nhave a very good sense of hearing, and can estimate how far away each of their\nfellows is. The men have a voice at either end: bass on the left, tenor on the\nright. By noting the time lag between the two voices it is possible to tell\nhow long a given male Linelander is. The poor women, of course, are just\npoints!\n\n![img](Images/p015_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 12. A Square moves through Lineland._\n\nA Square tries to tell the king about the second dimension. The king doesn’t\nunderstand, and asks A Square to move in the direction of the mysterious\nsecond dimension. A Square complies, and moves right through the space of\nLineland. (In figure 12 I have labeled the king’s bass and tenor ends.)\nNaturally enough, the king simply perceives this “motion” as a segment that\nappears out of nowhere, stays for a minute, and then disappears all at once.\nThe king denies the reality of the second dimension, A Square loses his\ntemper, the dream ends.\n\n![img](Images/p016_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 13. A Square and his wife in a locked room._\n\nI landed on all fours … There was a sort of floor about a yard below the plane\nof Flatland. When I stood up, it was as if I were standing waist-deep in an\nendless, shiny lake. My fall through the Flatlanders’ space had smashed up one\nof their houses. Several of them were nosing at my waist, wondering what I\nwas. To my surprise, I could feel their touch quite distinctly. They seemed to\nhave a thickness of several millimeters …\n\nI was standing in the middle of a “street,” that is to say, in the middle of a\nclear path lined with Flatland houses on either side. The houses had the form\nof large squares and rectangles, three to five feet on a side. The Flatlanders\nthemselves were as Abbott has described them: women are short Lines with a\nbright eye at one end, the soldiers are very sharp isosceles Triangles, and\nthere are Squares, Pentagons and other Polygons as well. The adults are, on\nthe average, about twelve inches across.\n\nThe buildings that lined my street bore signs in the form of strings of\ncolored dots along their outer walls. To my right was the house of a childless\nHexagon and his wife. To my left was the home of an equilateral Triangle,\nproud father of three little Squares. The Triangle’s door, a hinged line-\nsegment, stood ajar. One of his children, who had been playing in the street,\nsped inside, frightened by my appearance. The plane of Flatland cut me at the\nwaist and arms, giving me the appearance of a large blob flanked by two\nsmaller blobs — a weird and uncanny spectacle, to be sure.\n\nRUDY RUCKER,\n\n“Message Found in a Copy of Flatland,” 1983\n\nThe next evening A Square and his wife are comfortably sealed up in the safety\nof their home, when suddenly a voice out of nowhere speaks to them. And then,\na moment later, a circle appears in the confines of their tightly locked\nhouse. It is A Sphere, come to teach A Square about the third dimension.\n\n![img](Images/p016_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 14. A Circle appears in A Square’s locked room._\n\nReasoning by analogy, you can see that a four-dimensional creature would be\nable to reach into any of our rooms or cubbyholes, no matter how well they are\nsealed up. A four-dimensional creature could empty out a safe without cracking\nit, for the safe has no walls against the fourth dimension. A four-dimensional\nsurgeon could reach into your viscera without breaking your skin. A four-\ndimensional creature could drink up your Chivas Regal without ever opening the\nbottle!\n\n![img](Images/p017_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 15. Liquor thief from the next dimension._\n\nIf only you had the muscles to twitch part of your arm up into the fourth\ndimension, you could reach in “around” the window at Tiffany’s and take out\nthe biggest diamond on display. This _would not_ be done by somehow having\nyour arm turn into gas or a ray of light. The heist would be done by having\nyour arm move up through the fourth dimension. The diamond would be brought\nout by lifting it up into the fourth dimension to get “around” the sheet of\nglass.\n\n![img](Images/p017_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 16. The perfect crime._\n\nReturning to A Square, there he is, locked in his house, talking to what seems\nto be a circle, another two-dimensional creature. The Sphere objects to this\nflat characterization of himself:\n\n“I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid. You call me a Circle; but in reality I\nam not a Circle, but an indefinite number of Circles, of size varying from a\nPoint to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one placed on the top of the\nother. When I cut through your plane as I am now doing, I make in your plane a\nsection which you, very rightly, call a Circle. For even a Sphere — which is\nmy proper name in my own country — if he manifest himself at all to an\ninhabitant of Flatland — must needs manifest himself as a Circle.\n\n“Do you not remember — for I, who see all things, discerned last night the\nphantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain — do you not remember, I\nsay, how when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were compelled to\nmanifest yourself to the King, not as a Square, but as a Line, because that\nLinear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent the whole of you, but only\na slice or section of you? In precisely the same way, your country of Two\nDimensions is not spacious enough to represent me, a being of Three, but can\nonly exhibit a slice or section of me, which is what you call a Circle.”\n\n![img](Images/p018_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 17. A Sphere moves through Flatland._\n\nThe Sphere proceeds to demonstrate the third dimension by moving through A\nSquare’s plane, just as A Square had moved through Lineland for the king. What\nA Square sees is a point that turns into a circle. The circle swells to a\ncertain maximum size, then shrinks back to a point, which disappears. His\ngreat difficulty is in thinking of all these different circles as existing all\ntogether in the form of a sphere.\n\nPause for a moment and try to imagine four-dimensional space. It is right next\nto you, but in a direction you can’t point to. No matter how well hidden you\nmay be, a four-dimensional creature can see you perfectly well, inside and\noutside.\n\n![img](Images/p018_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 18. A hypersphere moves through our space._\n\nWhat would you see if, right this moment, a four-dimensional hypersphere were\nto pass through the space near your head? Reasoning strictly by analogy, you\nwould expect to see first a point, then a small sphere, then a bigger sphere,\nthen a small sphere, and then a final point that disappears. Visually, it\nwould be much the same as seeing a balloon that is first blown up and then\ndeflated. Next time you have a balloon in hand, you might even try smoothly\nblowing it up and letting the air back out. That, basically, is what you would\nsee if a hypersphere passed through the space of your room. A sphere is a\nthree-dimensional stack of circles; a hypersphere is a four-dimensional stack\nof spheres.\n\nBut it is very hard to see how to stack things up in a new dimension. A\nSquare, far from believing that he has seen the cross sections of a sphere,\nshrieks, “Monster, be thou juggler, enchanter, dream or devil, no more will I\nendure thy mockeries,” and rams his hardest right angle against A Sphere’s\ncross section.\n\n![img](Images/p019_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 19. Impaled by a policeman._\n\nAn interesting question comes up here. If A Square were actually to cut into A\nSphere, would it matter to the sphere? Would it be possible for the\nFlatlanders to keep a three-dimensional being captive? To make this question\nquite concrete, imagine that you had somehow found the real Flatland. You\nstick your hand through it and an enraged isosceles triangle spears right\nthrough your wrist. Then what?\n\nTo answer the question, we have to decide exactly what Flatland is like. If\nthe Flatlanders are truly two-dimensional, with no thickness at all, then they\nwill be as immaterial as shadows or patches of light. In this case, having an\nisosceles intersect your wrist would not hurt, nor would it limit your freedom\nof movement. Indeed, it is debatable whether such an insubstantial Flatlander\nwould actually be able to poke through your skin.\n\nOne problem with the idea of truly two-dimensional Flatlanders is that it is a\nlittle hard to see how they could have any solidity or reality. If they were\nindeed just like shaded regions of the plane, then there would really be\nnothing to prevent them from freely moving through each other. One way out of\nthis difficulty might be to have the “atoms” of a two-dimensional Flatland\nconsist of little wrinkles or bumps in the plane of the Flatland space. Thus A\nSquare might be a sort of mesa in the rubbery sheet of Flatland’s space. Here\nwe could suppose that the space is infinitely thin, but it is easier to\nimagine that the “rubbery sheet of Flatland’s space” does itself have a slight\nthickness.\n\n![img](Images/p020_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 20. A Square as a bump in the plane._\n\nWhen residing and touring in the North of England several years ago, I talked\nand lectured several times on the fourth dimension. One day after having\nretired to bed, I lay fully awake thinking out some problems connected with\nthis subject. I tried to visualize or think out the shape of a four-\ndimensional cube, which I imagined to be the simplest four-dimensional shape.\nTo my great astonishment I saw before me first a four-dimensional globe and\nafterwards a four-dimensional cube, and learned only then from this object-\nlesson that the globe is the simplest body, and not the cube, as the third-\ndimensional analogy ought to have told me beforehand.\n\nThe remarkable thing was that the definite endeavor to see the one thing made\nme see the other. I saw the forms as before me in the air (though the room was\ndark), and behind the forms I saw clearly a rift in the curtains through which\na glimmer of light filtered into the room …\n\nI forgo the attempt to describe the four-dimensional cube as to its form.\nMathematical description would be possible but would at thè same time\ndisintegrate the real impression in its totality. The fourth-dimensional globe\ncan be better described. It was an ordinary three-dimensional globe, out of\nwhich, on each side, beginning at its vertical circumference bent, tapering\nhorns proceeded, which, with a circular bend, united their points above the\nglobe from which they started. The effect is best indicated by circumscribing\nthe numeral 8 by a circle. So three circles are formed, the lower one\nrepresenting the initial globe, the upper one representing empty space, and\nthe greater circle circumscribing the whole. If it now be understood that the\nupper circle does not exist and the lower (small) circle is identical with the\nouter (large) circle, the impression will have been conveyed, at least to some\nextent …\n\nI have in a like manner had rare visions of the fifth-and sixth-dimensional\nfigures … The fifth-dimensional vision is best described by saying that it\nlooked like an Alpine relief map, with the singularity that all mountain peaks\nand the whole landscape represented in the map were _one_ mountain, or again\nin other words as if all the mountains had one single base.\n\nJOHAN VON MANEN,\n\n_Some Occult Experiences,_ 1913\n\nSo now what if the Flatlanders _do_ have a slight thickness? Abbott himself\nopts for this alternative in the preface to the second edition of _Flatland._\nHere he describes how A Square comes to believe that insofar as Flatland\nreally exists inside some higher space, it must be that the Flatlanders have\nheight as well as length and breadth. Since each of them has the same height,\nthere is no way for them to notice it. A Square reports an unintentionally\nfunny conversation in which he discusses this point with the ruler of\nFlatland:\n\nI tried to prove to him that he was “high,” as well as long and broad,\nalthough he did not know it. But what was his reply? “You say I am ‘high’;\nmeasure my ‘high-ness’ and I will believe you.” What could I do? How could I\nmeet his challenge?\n\nEven if all the Flat-landers were fully one inch high, they would not be able\nto notice this height, provided they still had no power of motion or variation\nin the third dimension. Of course, if there were Flatlanders of varying\nheights, then _some_ kind of difference would be noticed, though the Fiat-\nlanders’ description of the difference might be some vague, nongeometrical\nquality like charisma, force of personality, or “aura.”\n\n![img](Images/p021_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 21. A Square is high with the boss._\n\nNow, if the Flatlanders did have an actual three-dimensional thickness, then\nhaving one of them cut into you would be like being cut with a knife blade.\nAnd if the creature was large enough, it might have enough mass to make your\nescape difficult.\n\nIn _Flatland,_ as it turns out, Sphere becomes angry with Square’s attempts to\nstab him, and finally grabs Square and lifts him up into space. A Square finds\nit an unsettling experience:\n\nAn unspeakable horror seized me. There was a darkness; then a dizzy, sickening\nsensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line that was no Line;\nSpace that was not Space: I was myself, and not myself. When I could find\nvoice, I shrieked aloud in agony, “Either this is madness or it is Hell.” “It\nis neither,” calmly replied the voice of the Sphere, “it is Knowledge; it is\nThree Dimensions: open your eye once again and try to look steadily.”\n\n![img](Images/p021_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 22. What if the Sphere just got A Square’s skin}_\n\nHere again, an interesting side issue comes up. Mightn’t it be harmful for A\nSquare to be lifted out of his space? We had better assume that the Square has\nsome thin membranes sealing off his upper and lower faces against the third\ndimension, for otherwise when A Sphere pulls on a corner he might get only the\nskin! And rather than thinking of A Square as resting _on_ his space, let’s\nregard him as _in_ a slightly thickened plane.\n\n![img](Images/p022_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 23. A Square is really a thick part of a thick plane._\n\nAmong the countries of the world, Chile is remarkable for its great length and\nextreme narrowness. On the west coast of South America for 2700 miles it\nstretches ribbonlike from north to south, between the Andes Mountains and the\nPacific Ocean. In some places it is less than 40 miles wide.\n\nLet us suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the people of this land of\nChile for some reason should be restricted from passing outside the boundaries\nof their country and in fact become incapable of having any communication with\nthe outside world. Let us suppose also that the width of the country in an\neast and west direction gradually diminishes till it becomes so small as to be\npractically negligible. The Chilean world would thus become a very thin north\nand south vertical slice of space which would be two-dimensional for all\npractical purposes.\n\nCorrespondingly the inhabitants of the Chilean Thinland would become thin\npaper-like beings, capable of north and south and vertical motions, but not\nable to sidestep objects or to rotate the head sideways …\n\n[T]he two eyes of a Chilean Thinlander would take up positions on the front\nedge of the face, as for instance one above the other on the forehead, or in\norder to get a longer base triangulation in distance vision, one on the\nforehead and the other on the tip of the chin. In order to look backward, that\nis, behind one, since there could be no turning around of the body or head\nsidewise as such motion would involve a use of the third dimension, a long\nflexible neck would have to be developed so that the head could be tilted\nbackwards into an upside-down position.\n\nFLETCHER DURRELL,\n\n_Mathematical Adventures,_ 1938\n\nThe best-known two-dimensional world other than Flat-land is known as Astria.\nIt is described in Charles H. Hin-ton’s 1907 book, _An Episode of Flatland: Or\nHow a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension._ Here is the passage where\nHinton explains his idea for the world:\n\n![img](Images/p022_2.jpg)\n\n_A Square’s gut busts him._\n\n[PUZZLE 2.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch2pa1)\n\n_It would seem that Flatlanders cannot have a complete digestive system in the\nform of a tube running the length of their bodies, for such a tube cuts them\nin half. Is there any way around this problem_?\n\nPlacing some coins on the table one day, I amused myself by pushing them\nabout, and it struck me that one might represent a planetary system of a\ncertain sort by their means. This large one in the center represents the sun,\nand the others its planets journeying round it. And in this case considering\nthe planets as inhabited worlds, confined in all their movements round the\nsun, to a slipping over the surface of the table, I saw that we must think of\nthe beings that inhabit these worlds as standing out from the rims of them,\nnot walking over the flat surface of them. Just as attraction in the case of\nour earth acts towards the center, and the center is inaccessible by reason of\nthe solidity on which we stand, so the inhabitants of my coin worlds would\nhave an attraction proceeding out in every direction along the surface of the\ntable from the center of the coin, and “up” would be to them out from the\ncenter beyond the rim, while “down” would be towards the center inwards from\nthe rim. And beings thus situated would be rightly described as standing on\nthe rim. [Most of Hinton’s essays can be found in _The Selected Writings of C.\nH.

Astrians on a small planet._\n\n[PUZZLE 2.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch2pa2)\n\n_Abbott’s Flatland is not really a very close analogue of our world. For\nalthough our space is 3-D, we cannot move around freely in 3-D space. Instead\nwe must walk around on the surface of a sphere. What would be an analogous\ndesign for a 2-D world_?\n\nA drawback with a world design like this is that the polygons have so much\ntrouble moving past each other, building houses, and so on. Many of these\ndifficulties are resolved in A. K. Dewdney’s 1984 book _The Planiverse._ As is\n_The Fourth Dimension,_ Dewdney’s book is in some measure a celebration of\n_Flatland’s_ centennial.\n\nOne final plane-universe book worth mentioning is the 1965 book _Sphereland,_\nby the Dutch mathematician Dionys Burger. Burger describes a world that is\nsomething of a compromise between Flatland, with its great freedom of\nmovement, and Astria, with its close resemblance to Earth. Burger’s notion is\nthat, as in Astria, the 2-D creatures live near the surface of a disk planet.\nBut he proposes that they be very light, and thus able to live in their\nplanet’s atmosphere. It is as if people were able to live in clouds, clouds\nfloating above tropical vegetation that is, in turn, floating on a sea that\nsurrounds the planet’s dense core.\n\n![img](Images/p024_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 25.

What would our world\nlook like from this vantage point? To begin with, note that our 3-D space\nwould cut 4-D hyperspace into two regions, just as a 0-D point cuts a 1-D line\nin two, a 1-D line cuts a 2-D plane in two, and a 2-D plane cuts a 3-D space\nin two. (By the way, we speak of a point as _zero_ -dimensional, 0-D, because\nsomeone whose entire space is limited to one point has _no_ degrees of freedom\nin his or her motions.)\n\n![img](Images/p025_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 26. An n-dimensional space cuts an_ (n + _1_)_-dimensional space in\nhalf._\n\nWhat shall we call the two regions of hyperspace determined by our space?\nCharles H. Hinton has suggested the words _ana_ and _kata,_ to be used more or\nless like the words _up_ and _down._ Just to have something to think about, we\nmight think of heaven as lying _ana_ above our space, and hell as lying _kata_\nbelow. A 4-D angel expelled from heaven would tumble through our space like a\nman falling through Flatland: an exciting moment of grotesque,\nincomprehensible cross sections splitting and merging and falling about!\n\n![img](Images/p026_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 27. Man falling through Flatland._\n\nLet us take a certain plane — for instance, that which separates the surface\nof Lake Ladoga which surrounds us, from the atmosphere above it, in this quiet\nautumn evening. Let us suppose that this plane is a separate world of two\ndimensions, peopled with its own beings, which can move only on this plane …\n\nLet us suppose that, having escaped from behind our Schlusselburg bastions,\nyou went for a bathe in the lake.\n\nAs beings of three dimensions you also have two dimensions which lie on the\nsurface of the water. You will occupy a definite place in the world of shadow\nbeings. All the parts of your body above and below the level of the water will\nbe imperceptible to them, and they will be aware of nothing but your contour,\nwhich is outlined by the surface of the lake. Your contour must appear to them\nas an object of their own world, only very astonishing and miraculous. The\nfirst miracle from their point of view will be your sudden appearance in their\nmidst. It can be said with full conviction that the effect you would create\nwould be in no way inferior to the unexpected appearance among ourselves of\nsome ghost from the unknown world. The second miracle would be the surprising\nchangeability of your external form. When you are immersed up to your waist\nyour form will be for them almost elliptical, because only the line on the\nsurface surrounding your waist and impenetrable for them will be perceptible\nto them. When you begin to swim you will assume in their eyes the outline of a\nman. When you wade into a shallow place so that the surface on which they live\nwill encircle your legs, you will appear to them transformed into two ring-\nshaped beings. If, desirous of keeping you in one place, they surround you on\nall sides, you can step over them and find yourself free from them in a way\nquite inconceivable to them. In their eyes you would be an all-powerful being\n— an inhabitant of a higher world, similar to those supernatural beings about\nwhom theologians and metaphysicians tell us.\n\nN. A. MOROSOFF,\n\n“Letter to My Fellow-Prisoners in the Fortress of Schlusselburg,” 1891\n\nJust as man’s Flatland cross section could be a number of irregular shapes\nwith skin boundaries, a hyperbeing’s cross section in our space might be a\nbunch of bobbing globs of skin-covered flesh. Some of the blobs might have\nthings like teeth or claws! Being “picked up” by a hyperbeing would probably\ninvolve a bunch of globs closing in on you like cross sections of a hand’s\nfingers.\n\nOnce you are out in hyperspace, you can get some very strange perspectives on\nthose you left behind. Consider how Flatland looks to us: we can see all four\nsides of A Square, and we can see every detail of innards. By the same token,\na 4-D creature should be able to look down at me and, at one glance, see every\nsquare inch of my skin, the inside and outside of my stomach, the convolutions\nof my brain, and so on.\n\n![img](Images/p027_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 28. Woman menaced by a creature from the fourth dimension._\n\nBut how, you may ask, could a 4-D person “see” all sides of a 3-D object at\nonce? A human being’s retina is a two-dimensional disk of nerve endings. By\nanalogy, we would expect a 4-D creature’s retina to be a three-dimensional\nsphere of nerve endings. My seeing A Square consists of the excitation of a\nsquare-shaped pattern of nerve endings in my retina. A 4-D creature’s “seeing”\nme would consist of the excitation of a person-shaped pattern of nerve endings\nin the little ball of his retina. Each point in A Square’s body sends a light\nray up to a single point in my retina. Each point in my body sends a light ray\n_ana_ to a single point in the 4-D creature’s retina.\n\n![img](Images/p027_2.jpg)\n\n_Perpendicular worlds._\n\n[PUZZLE 3.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa1)\n\n_In four dimensions it is possible to have two 3-D spaces “perpendicular” to\neach other. Two such spaces would have only a plane in common. Suppose now\nthat there is a 3-D space perpendicular to ours, a space with people moving\naround in it. Use a Flatland analogy to figure out how these people would\nappear to us._\n\n![img](Images/p028_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 29. A 2-D with an image of A Square, and a 3-D retina with an image of a\nperson._\n\nI felt myself rising through space. It was even as the Sphere had said. The\nfurther we receded from the object we beheld, the larger became the field of\nvision. My native city, with the interior of every house and every creature\ntherein, lay open to my view in miniature. We mounted higher, and lo, the\nsecrets of the earth, the depths of mines and inmost caverns of the hills,\nwere bared before me.\n\nEDWIN A. ABBOTT,\n\n_Flatland_ , 1889\n\nIt is a curious feature of 4-D space that we can connect two points in the\ninteriors of two solid 3-D objects without piercing these objects’ surfaces.\nThe trick is to use _ana / kata_ motions to get in and out of the solid 3-D\nobjects. If you’re inside a cubical room and move _ana_ out of it, it’s as if\nyou had suddenly dematerialized. You don’t go through the walls or the floor\nor the ceiling, you move over in the _ana_ direction to a part of 4-D space\nwhere the room doesn’t exist at all.\n\n![img](Images/p028_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 30. Connecting interior points without cutting through the boundary._\n\n[PUZZLE 3.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa2)\n\n_If we assume that A Square’s eye stays the same when he is lifted into 3-D\nspace, he will not really be able to see whole 2-D objects as we do. What will\nhe see_? _How might he build up a mental image of the full 2-D Flatland_?\n\nSo the reason that a 4-D creature can see all of me inside and out is that\nsuch a creature’s “retina” is able to form a completely detailed model of my\nbody. But this is not really so puzzling or occult a phenomenon. The human\nbrain is able to mimic such behavior … For do you not have a detailed 3-D\nmental image of your right hand? When you think of your hand you do not\nnecessarily think of just the front or just the back. It is really possible to\nhave the idea of a 3-D object seen from no particular direction — or from all\ndirections at once.\n\nWe can form especially good 3-D images of transparent objects such as\npaperweights, wine bottles, or glasses of water. Here, unlike with the hand,\nthere is no difficulty in imagining the inside parts. Holding 3-D images in\nyour mind is definitely something worth doing. Try, for instance, to think\nabout your house — all of it, seen from no particular vantage point. Here you\nare getting close to a higher-dimensional experience.\n\nSo a 4-D view of our 3-D world is not totally inconceivable. But what would it\nbe like to look at 4-D objects? We saw with the hypersphere in [chapter\n2](10_Chapter2.html) that it is possible to get images of various 3-D cross\nsections of such a hyperobject, but how are we to combine these sections into\na 4-D whole?\n\nSome people might say at the outset that it is hopeless to try to think of\nfour-dimensional objects. For how can our 3-D brains ever hold images of 4-D\nobjects? This argument has some force, but it is not really conclusive.\nDrawings use 2-D arrangements of lines to represent 3-D objects. Why shouldn’t\nwe be able to build up 3-D arrangements of neurons that represent 4-D objects?\nMore fancifully, perhaps our minds are not just 3-D patterns: maybe our brains\nhave a slight 4-D hyperthickness, or maybe our minds extend out of our brains\nand into hyperspace!\n\nI’ll spend the rest of this chapter discussing two of the simpler 4-D shapes:\nthe hypersphere and the hypercube. We’ll start with the hypersphere, though if\nyou hate math you might want to skip up to where I talk about the hypercube.\n\nA sphere of any dimensionality is specified by giving its center and its\nradius. In any space, the sphere with center point _0_ and radius _r_ is the\nset of all points _P_ whose distance from _0_ is _r._ In 2-D space this\ndefinition leads to a circle of radius _r_ , in 3-D space it gives a\ntraditional sphere, and in 4-D space it gives a hypersphere.\n\n![img](Images/p030_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 31. A circle is a 2-D sphere._\n\nPick a point _0_ in space near you and try to imagine a hypersphere centered\non this point, a hypersphere with a five-foot radius. What points _P_ lie on\nthe hypersphere? First of all, there are the points in your space that are\nfive feet from _0._ But moving in our space is not the only way to move away\nfrom _0._ What if one combines motion away from _0,_ as before, with a motion\n_ana_ out of our space? We might, for instance, move four feet away from _0_\nin our space, turn at right angles, and then move _ana_ three feet into\nhyperspace. (Those who remember the Pythagorean theorem, or the “distance\nformula” of analytic geometry, can check that this is true because 42 \\+ 32 =\n52.)\n\n![img](Images/p030_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 32. 2-D plus “up” is like 3-D plus “ana._ ”\n\nThe sphere of my vision now began to widen. Next I could distinctly perceive\nthe walls of the house. At first they seemed very dark and opaque; but soon\nbecame brighter, and then _transparent:_ and presently I could see the walls\nof the adjoining dwelling. These also immediately became light, and vanished,\n— melting like clouds before my advancing vision. I could now see the objects,\nthe furniture, and persons, in the adjoining house as easily as those in the\nroom where I was situated … But my perception still flowed on! The broad\nsurface of the earth, for many hundred miles, before the sweep of my vision —\ndescribing nearly a semicircle — became transparent as the purest water; and I\nsaw the brains, the viscera, and the complete anatomy of animals that were at\nthat moment sleeping or prowling about in the forests of the Eastern\nHemisphere, hundreds and even thousands of miles from the room in which I was\nmaking these observations.\n\nANDREW JACKSON DAVIS,\n\n_The Magic Staff,_ 1876\n\nWhat is interesting to notice here is that no matter which direction of our\nspace the original four-foot displacement from _0_ is taken in, the additional\nthree-foot _ana_ motion gives a point exactly five feet away from _0_. So if\nwe take all the points on a four-foot sphere around _0_ and then move _ana_\nthree feet, we will get a displaced sphere of points all belonging to the\nfive-foot hypersphere around _0._\n\nNow we can see why the full hypersphere consists of a series of spheres,\nspheres that grow smaller as one moves _ana_ or _kata_ from the space where\nthe center lies. Taken together, this family of spheres makes up a three-\ndimensional “hypersurface,” analogous to the two-dimensional surface of a\nsphere. The hypersurface of a hypersphere is a curved 3-D space located in 4-D\nspace.\n\nThis is an important concept because many scientists believe that the space of\nour universe is in fact the hypersurface of a very large hypersphere. Let’s\ntry to understand it a little better.\n\nFirst of all, shouldn’t the hypersurface of a hypersphere be _four_\n-dimensional, not _three_? Not really. Consider the surface of an ordinary 3-D\nsphere such as the planet Earth. Although the surface is certainly curved in\nthree dimensions, someone limited to the surface has only _two_ degrees of\nfreedom in moving: east/west or north/south. A Flat-lander sliding around on a\n3-D sphere’s surface still feels himself to be in a 2-D space. It’s just that\nthis space somehow curves back on itself.\n\nNow think of a little hyperfly who can move in hyperspace, but who has to stay\nexactly five feet from the point _0._ If the fly starts out five feet away\nfrom _0_ in our space then it has basically three kinds of motion open to it:\neast/west or north/south (around a five-foot sphere centered on _0_ in our\nspace) or an _ana/kata_ motion (combined with a motion toward _0_ to keep the\ndistance at five feet).\n\nWe’ll come back to the hypersphere later, but now it’s time to look at the\n_hypercube._\n\nThe hypercube, also known as the _tesseract,_ is probably the best-known 4-D\ngeometrical pattern. It arises in the following way:\n\n[PUZZLE 3.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa3)\n\n_See if you can complete this table:_\n\n![img](Images/p031_1.jpg)\n\n![img](Images/p032_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 33. From point to cube._\n\nThere wasn’t much to the machine. All great things are simple, I suppose.\nThere were three trussed beams of aluminum at right angles to each other, each\nwith a cylinder and plunger, and, from them, toggles coming together at a\npoint where there was a sort of “universal joint” topped by a mat of thick\nrubber. That was all…\n\nSo Banza stepped on the rubber mat and Bookstrom instructed him.\n\n“Move this switch one button at a time. That will always raise you a notch.\nLook around each time until you get it just right.”\n\nWith the first click Banza disappeared, just as people vanish suddenly in the\nmovies. Cladgett groaned and squirmed and then was quiet. With another click\nBanza reappeared, and in his hand was a pair of old-fashioned pince-nez\nspectacles, moist and covered with a grayish film. He held them toward\nCladgett, who grabbed them and mumbled something.\n\n“Can you imagine,” breathed Banza, “standing in the center of a sphere and\nseeing all the abdominal organs around you at once? Something like that, it\nseemed, not exactly either. There above my head were the coils of the small\nintestine. To the right was the cecum with the spectacles beside it, to my\nleft the sigmoid and the muscles attached to the ilium, and beneath my feet\nthe peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall. But I was terribly dizzy for\nsome reason; I could not stand it very long, much as I should have liked to\nremain inside of him for a while —”\n\nMILES J. BREUER,\n\n“The Appendix and the Spectacles,” 1928\n\nStart with a point and move it one unit to the right. This produces a one-\ndimensional line segment. Now move the line segment one unit down the page,\nproducing a two-dimensional square. If we move the square one unit out of the\npage we get a three-dimensional cube.\n\nNow, we can’t really fit a three-dimensional object into the two-dimensional\nconfines of this page. The standard convention, which we have used above, is\nto represent the third dimension as a direction diagonal to the first two.\nWhat if we were to use the _other_ diagonal direction as the fourth dimension?\nIf we move our image of the cube one unit in this “fourth dimension,” we get a\npicture of a four-dimensional hypercube.\n\n![img](Images/p032_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 34. The hypercube._\n\nThis figure is fun to look at … It has a certain mandala-like quality. If you\nare interested in drawing your own, note that the figure can be produced by\nconstructing a square on each of the inner edges of a regular octagon. A\nregular octagon can be obtained by tearing down a STOP sign or, preferably, by\ndividing a circle into eight equal slices.\n\nThe hypercube arises as the “trail” of a cube moving in four-dimensional\nspace. A cube arises as the “trail” of a square moving in three-dimensional\nspace. Any given cube can be generated in three different ways, depending\nwhich of three possible pairs of opposite squares are thought of as being the\n“start” and “finish” positions. The hypercube includes four pairs of cubes.\nCan you see them all?\n\n![img](Images/p033_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 35. Squares on an octagon._\n\nA different way of drawing a hypercube is based on the idea that if you hold\nthe wire skeleton of a cube close to your face, it will look like a small\nsquare inside a big square. Analogously, we can represent a hypercube by\ndrawing a small cube inside a large cube. The idea is that the small cube is\n“farther away” in the direction of the fourth dimension. Surprisingly, such a\nhypercube shape can be naturally produced by dipping a cubical framework into\nsoap solution, and then adding a bubble at the center.\n\n![img](Images/p033_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 36. A cube as a square in a square, and a hypercube as a cube in a cube.\n(Hypercube drawing from D. Hilbert and H. Cohn-Vossen,_ Geometry and the\nImagination)\n\nYet another way of representing a hypercube is by _unfolding_ one. As before,\nwe reason by analogy. If you cut some of the edges of a paper cube, you can\nflatten the cube down into a connected two-dimensional pattern of six squares.\nThis can be done in eleven essentially different ways.\n\n![img](Images/p034_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 37. The eleven ways to unfold a cube._\n\n“All right. Now listen — a tesseract has eight cubical sides, _all on the\noutside._ Now watch me. I’m going to open up this tesseract like you can open\nup a cubical pasteboard box, until it’s flat. That way you’ll be able to see\nall eight of the cubes.” Working very rapidly he constructed four cubes,\npiling one on top of the other in an unsteady tower. He then built out four\nmore cubes from the four posed faces of the second cube in the pile. The\nstructure swayed a little under the loose coupling of the clay pellets, but it\nstood, eight cubes in an inverted cross, a double cross, as the four\nadditional cubes stuck out in four directions. “Do you see it now? It rests on\nthe ground floor room, the next six cubes are the living rooms, and there is\nyour study, up at the top.”\n\nBailey regarded it with more approval than he had the other figures. “At least\nI can understand it. You say that is a tesseract, too?”\n\n“That is a tesseract unfolded in three dimensions. To put it back together you\ntuck the top cube onto the bottom cube, fold those side cubes in till they\nmeet the top cube, and there you are. You do all this folding through a fourth\ndimension of course; you don’t distort any of the cubes, or fold them into\neach other.”\n\nBailey studied the wobbly framework further. “Look here,” he said at last,\n“why don’t you forget about folding this thing up through a fourth dimension —\nyou can’t anyway — and build a house like this?”\n\nROBERT A. HEINLEIN,\n\n“And He Built a Crooked House,” 1940\n\nIf a hypercube is cut in the proper way, then it can be unfolded and\n“flattened down” into a connected three-dimensional pattern of eight cubes.\nOne unfolding of the hypercube produces a sort of three-dimensional cross.\nSalvador Dali actually uses this unfolded hypercube as a crucifix in his 1954\npainting _Christus Hypercubus._ In his classic story “And He Built a Crooked\nHouse,” Robert Heinlein describes a house built in this pattern. The twist in\nHeinlein’s story occurs when there is an earthquake and the house folds up\ninto a hypercube!\n\n![img](Images/p034_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 38. One way to unfold a hypercube._\n\nAs a last approach to the hypercube, let’s imagine a hollow stone hypercube,\nanalogous to a hollow stone prison cell. What would we see if this\nhypercubical prison was pushed through our space?\n\nWell, what would A Square see if we pushed a hollow stone cube through the\nplane of Flatland? At the beginning the whole solid stone floor would\nintersect his space, later there would be hollow stone squares made up of\ncross sections of the walls, and finally there would be the solid stone cross\nsection of the ceiling. He would see a solid square, followed by hollow\nsquares, followed by a solid square. By the same token, if we were to push a\nFlatland prison cell — a hollow stone square — through Lineland, the\nLinelanders would see a solid segment, hollow segments, and then a solid\nsegment.\n\n![img](Images/p035_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 39. A 2-D prison cell passes through Lineland._\n\n[PUZZLE 3.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa4)\n\n_Figure 38 shows an unfolded hypercube. Try to figure out which sides should\nget glued to which if the thing is to be folded back up into a four-\ndimensional hypercube. Specifically, which faces get glued to the faces of the\nbottom cube_?\n\n[PUZZLE 3.5](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa5)\n\n_The volume of a cube_ S _feet on a side is given by the formula_ S3. _What do\nyou think would be the formula for the hypervolume of a hypercube_ S _feet on\na side? Specifically, what would be the hypervolume of a 2-by-2-by-2-by-2\nhypercube_?\n\nReasoning by analogy, it is not hard to see that if a hollow stone hypercube\nwere to pass through our space, we would see first a solid cube of stone, then\na series of hollow stone cubes, and finally a last solid stone cube. The eight\nsolid “boundary cubes” of the hypercube would arise as the two solid cubes\nseen at beginning and end, and as the six “trails” of the floors, walls, and\nceilings of the hollow cubes.\n\n![img](Images/p036_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 40. Escaping from a sealed room._\n\nThe hollow stone hypercube could serve as a prison cell in which a hyperbeing,\nsay an angel, could be incarcerated. Think of the room you are in as having a\nsolid stone floor, walls, and ceiling. Even an angel can’t get through that\nsolid stone. Normally, however, an angel could escape the room by moving\n_ana,_ over, and _kata._ But if your room is only a cross section of a stone\nhypercube, then when the angel moves _ana_ he finds himself not in an empty\nspace but still inside a stone-walled room. If the angel keeps moving _ana_ he\nwill run into one of the boundary cubes: a whole roomful of solid stone,\nimpossible to move beyond.\n\n![img](Images/p036_2.jpg)\n\n_From segment to tetrahedron._\n\n[PUZZLE 3.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa6)\n\n_The two points at either end of a line segment have the pleasant property of\nbeing equally far way from each other. If we move into 2-D space, we can find\na third point so that now all three points are equally far away from each\nother. The three points, of course, are the vertices of an equilateral\ntriangle. In 3-D space we can go out of the triangle’s plane and get a fourth\npoint so that now all four points are the same distance from each other. These\nfour points make up the corners of a triangular pyramid, also known as a\ntetrahedron. What kind of 4-D figure do you get if you continue this procedure\nthrough one more step_?\n\n![img](Images/p037_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 41. No escape._\n\nWe have now discussed a variety of four-dimensional phenomena, but many\nreaders may still feel that something is missing. One doesn’t want only to\n_reason_ about the fourth dimension, one wants somehow to _see_ it. Most of\nwhat we have learned about the fourth dimension so far has been by using\nLineland and Flatland analogies. Although the analogies are very instructive,\nit is not unusual to have the feelings P. D. Ouspensky describes in _Tertium\nOrganum._\n\nThe method of analogies is, generally speaking, a rather tormenting thing.\nWith it, you walk in a vicious circle. It helps you to elucidate certain\nthings, and the relations of certain things, but in substance it never gives a\ndirect answer to anything. After many and long attempts to analyze higher\ndimensions by the aid of the method of analogies, you feel the uselessness of\nall your efforts; you feel that you are walking alongside of a wall. Thereupon\nyou begin to experience simply a hatred and aversion for analogies, and you\nfind it necessary to search for the direct way which leads where you need to\ngo.\n\nIn the next chapter we will look at a direct, though somewhat dangerous, path\ninto the fourth dimension.\n\n\n## 4\n\n## Through the  \nLooking Glass\n\nTHE FOURTH DIMENSION is essentially a modern idea, dating back not much\nfurther than the midnineteenth century. Although the vague notion of a higher\nworld has always been with us, the scientific concept of a geometrical fourth\ndimension was late to develop.\n\nThe first philosopher to seriously entertain the idea of higher-dimensional\nspaces was the great Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). In one of his earliest essays\nhe writes longingly of such spaces: “A science of all these possible kinds of\nspace would undoubtedly be the highest enterprise which a finite understanding\ncould undertake in the field of geometry … If it is possible that there could\nbe regions with other dimensions, it is very likely that God has somewhere\nbrought them into being.”\n\nLater in his career, Kant proposed a famous puzzle that is related to the idea\nof the fourth dimension: If all of space were empty except for a single human\nhand, would it make sense to say that the hand was specifically a _right_\nhand? As it turns out, the answer is no. The concepts of “left” and “right”\nare meaningless in an empty space.\n\nTo begin to understand why, imagine a big Plexiglas sign advertising a\npalmistry shop, a shop run by the famous fortuneteller Mom Oxo. The outline\nand wrinkles of a palm are drawn on the transparent Plexiglas. Now, if you\nlook at the sign from one side you see a right palm; if you look from the\nother you see a left palm. Once you realize that it is possible to look from\noutside the two-dimensional plane of the sign, you see that it would make no\nsense to say the palm is really a right palm.\n\n![img](Images/p039_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 42. Kant’s hand for Mom Oxo’s Palmistry._\n\nWhat can be more similar in every respect and in every part more alike to my\nhand and to my ear than their images in the mirror? And yet I cannot put such\na hand as is seen in the glass in the place of its original; for this is a\nright hand, that in the glass is a left one, and the image or reflection of\nthe right ear is a left one, which never can take the place of the other.\nThere are in this case no internal differences which our understanding could\ndetermine by thinking alone. Yet the differences are internal as the senses\nteach, for, notwithstanding their complete equality and similarity, the left\nhand cannot be enclosed in the same bounds as the right one (they are not\ncongruent); the glove of one hand cannot be used for the other. What is the\nsolution?\n\nIMMANUEL KANT,\n\n_Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics,_ 1783\n\nThe same is true of three-dimensional space. Depending which four-dimensional\n“side” you look at space from, a hand can appear to be a left or a right.\nAnother way of putting this is that a left hand can be converted into a right\nhand by lifting it into four-dimensional space and “turning it over.”\n\nLet’s dramatize this in terms of A Square. At the end of _Flatland,_ Square’s\ntrip into the third dimension ends with a big argument between him and A\nSphere. Reasoning by analogy, A Square concludes that there must be a four-\ndimensional world beyond the sphere’s 3-D space, and asks to be taken there.\nBut here, as sometimes happens, the student is seeing much further than the\nteacher has ever dared. Sphere is annoyed and finally angered by Square’s\ninsistence that there must be a four-dimensional “Thoughtland” beyond\nLineland, Flatland, and Spaceland. Yet A Square prattles on, dreaming of\nhigher and higher dimensions. Sphere loses all patience and the trip is over:\n\nMy words were cut short by a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside\nme, which impelled me through space with a velocity that precluded speech.\nDown! down! down! I was rapidly descending; and I knew that return to Flatland\nwas my doom. One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten glimpse I had of\nthat dull level wilderness — which was now to become my Universe again —\nspread out before my eye. Then a darkness. Then a final, all-consummating\nthunder-peal; and, when I came to myself, I was once more a common creeping\nSquare, in my Study at home, listening to the Peace-Cry of my approaching\nWife.\n\nNow of course A Square wants to tell everyone about his revelations but —\nsurprise, surprise — in Flatland it’s illegal to talk about higher dimensions.\nSquare tries to hold himself back, but finally at a meeting of the Local\nSpeculative Society,\n\nI so far forgot myself as to give an exact account of the whole of my voyage\nwith the sphere into Space … At first, indeed, I pretended that I was\ndescribing the imaginary experiences of a fictitious person but my enthusiasm\nsoon forced me to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a fervent\nperoration, I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of prejudice and to\nbecome believers in the Third Dimension.\n\nNeed I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?\n\nA Square is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. As time goes by he\nfinds it harder and harder to think about the third dimension. Edwin Abbott’s\n_Flatland_ ends on this downbeat note, with the increasingly depressed Square\nhaving served out seven years of his sentence.\n\nNineteen eighty-four is the hundredth anniversary of _Flatland’s_ publication.\nI am delighted to report that A Square is alive and flourishing. Not only is\nhe alive, but he has consented to communicate an account of his further\nadventures. I will be quoting from my notes on _The Further Adventures of A\nSquare_ throughout the rest of this book. I will begin by quoting the first\ntwo paragraphs here, and will then proceed to some excerpts dealing with\nproblems of left and right.\n\nA full century has elapsed since last I communicated with your happy Spaceland\nrace. My health, once failing, is again robust. Far from languishing in\nprison, I am now a respected Professor of Theology. The new Chief Circle\nencourages the Masses to worship Higher Space Beings as Angels and Gods. And\nmy assistants are ever pressing forward the mathematical theory of many\nDimensions.\n\nMy special Revelation, once so arcane, now suffers, if anything, from too\ngreat a currency among the Vulgar, and from too erudite an analysis among the\nClever. Let us never lose sight of the fact that Higher Space is a royal road\nto that which is beyond all imagining. He that hath ears, let him hear.\n\nAt first I took the intruder for a fellow Square. But, feeling his Perimeter,\nI discovered something quite Irregular: he had no eye. I thought to console\nhim, and the following conversation ensued.\n\n1\\. Have they then imprisoned you for Blindness? And why in my cell?\n\n![img](Images/p041_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 43. A Cube visits A Square._\n\nSTRANGER. Lock me up? Not on your life, Square. I’m a Cube from Spaceland.\nPleased to meet you.\n\n1\\. Oh blessed Providence, can it be? But what has become of my old Mentor,\nthe Sphere?\n\nCUBE. The Sphere doesn’t care, Square. If he did he’d have rescued you long\nago. How much time have you served?\n\n1\\. You inquire regarding the length of my imprisonment thus far? Seventy\nyears, my Lord. I used, it is true, to wonder why A Sphere did not lift me up\nout of my cell. But if I escaped, the Council would only reimprison me, or\nworse.\n\nCUBE. Don’t worry. I’ve been thinking what I could do for you. Cube and\nSquare, they go together, right? My idea is that I do something to you that\n_proves_ there’s a third dimension.\n\n1\\. Your meaning is yet veiled, my Lord.\n\nCUBE. Well, check _this_ out, cousin.\n\n![img](Images/p042_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 44. A Square turns over._\n\nThe Cube lunged at me and seized my Corner in his mouth. I felt a strange\nwhirling about my center and then all was still. The Cube had vanished, and I\nwas in my cell, yet … everything was different, everything was as if seen in a\nglass. Dizzy and confused, I slept and dreamt of Lineland.\n\nIn his dream of Lineland, A Square imagines that once again he is talking to\nthe king of Lineland, a segment with a bass voice at his left end and a tenor\nvoice at his right end. Seized with a desire to really upset the king, A\nSquare reaches down into Lineland and flips the king over, rotating him around\nhis central point. The other Linelanders can hear that the king doesn’t sound\nright: he’s been turned into his own mirror image. In a frenzy, they set upon\nthe king and tear him to shreds.\n\n![img](Images/p042_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 45. The king of Lineland flips._\n\nWhen A Square wakes up the next morning, everything still looks backwards. And\nthe guard who brings breakfast takes one look at our friend and begins to\nscream. It’s really true, that crazy Cube has turned A Square over, rotating\nhim about his central axis.\n\nNormally, if a Flatlander’s eye is on his north side, then his mouth is facing\neast. But now A Square is the opposite.\n\nJust a totally flipped square.\n\n![img](Images/p043_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 46. Flatland mirror._\n\nThe Council met, pronounced A Square an “object of horror to the gods,” and\ndecided to execute him.\n\nWe’ll get back to A Square’s adventures in a while, but now let’s stop and ask\nwhat it would be like to get “turned over” in the fourth dimension. It would\nseem that a 4-D being could turn you into your own mirror image by rotating\nyou, in the fourth dimension, around a plane that cuts through your body — say\nthe plane that includes the tip of your nose, your navel, and your spine. That\none plane of your body would stay in our space. Your right half would move\n_ana,_ let us say, and your left half would move _kata._ The two halves would,\nin their parallel spaces, move past the plane of rotation, and then they would\nswing back into our space. Rotation about a plane is hard for us to imagine …\nBut just remember how hard it is for a Flatlander to think of rotation about a\nline.\n\n[PUZZLE 4.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch4pa1)\n\n_A cube that intersects a plane at right angles makes a square cross section.\nWould it be possible to place a cube so that it intersects a plane in a\ntriangular cross section_? _How_? _What other cross-sectional shapes could a\ncube show_?\n\nWhile you were in the process of rotating you would really look strange, for\nall of you that would remain in our space would be a cross section something\nlike a microtomed tissue. If you were moved up and down at right angles to our\nspace, we could see each of your cross sections in turn, and really get a good\n3-D knowledge of your inner workings.\n\n![img](Images/p044_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 47. Before and after._\n\nWhat appeared to be a thin slice from the world’s largest blood-sausage had\nappeared in the center of the scale-ship. Vernor wavered … attracted by\ncuriosity, but repelled by fear. “Is that you, Mick? You don’t look so good.”\n\nThe shape of the slice gradually changed until finally what seemed to be an\nanimated silhouette was floating in front of Vernor. It was like a thin, thin\npaper cut-out of a man, only colored all different colors … a strange,\nshifting color pattern. Suddenly Vernor realized that he was looking at an\nactual cross-section of Mick Stones. It was as if someone had, with a huge\nsharp razor, split Mick’s front half from his back half; and then shaved off\none slice to wave at Vernor.\n\nThe cross-section wavered slightly, and then Mick Stones was back in the\nscale-ship. He seemed all right except that he looked funny, crooked. He\nreached his left hand out towards Vernor reassuringly. “It’s great out —” He\nwas interrupted by a violent explosion in front of his face.\n\nVernor’s gears suddenly meshed. “Go back!” he shouted. “You’re backwards!\nYou’re made of anti-matter now!” _That_ was why Mick had looked funny; he had\nturned over in hyperspace and come back as his mirror-image. Which meant that\neach of his particles was a mirror-image particle: anti-matter.\n\nRUDY RUCKER,\n\n_Spacetime Donuts,_ 1981\n\nActually the diagnostic tool known as a CAT scan consists of a process\nsomething like this: the building up of a 3-D model of the body by looking at\na series of cross-sectional x-rays.\n\nMysterious as a four-dimensional rotation into one’s own mirror image may\nseem, it is actually possible for us to watch such a rotation taking place, as\nwe will see shortly. The method, which provides genuine insight into the\nfourth dimension, has to do with A Cube.\n\n![img](Images/p044_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 48. A Cube._\n\nA Cube, you will notice, has typically schizoid features. The right half of\nhis face, which is controlled by the analytic and sociable left brain, has a\nfriendly smile and a precise triangular eye. The left half of his face,\ncontrolled by the dark and intuitive right brain, has a lax expression and a\nwandering round eye. Clearly A Cube and A Cube’s mirror image are totally\ndifferent. A Cube has his triangle eye on the right, but\n![img](Images/p045_2.jpg) A has his triangle eye on the left.\n\n![img](Images/p045_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 49. A Cube and his mirror image._\n\nIt is to be regretted that Plattner’s aversion to the idea of postmortem\ndissection may postpone, perhaps forever, the positive proof that his entire\nbody has had its left and right sides transposed. Upon that fact mainly the\ncredibility of his story hangs. There is no way of taking a man and moving him\nabout _in space,_ as ordinary people understand space, that will result in our\nchanging his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still his right, his left\nhis left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of course. If\nyou were to cut a figure out of paper, any figure with a right and left side,\nyou could change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over. But\nwith a solid it is different. Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way\nin which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking\nthat body clean out of space as we know it — taking it out of ordinary\nexistence, that is — and turning it somewhere outside space. This is a little\nabstruse, no doubt, but anyone with a slight knowledge of mathematical theory\nwill assure the reader of its truth. To put the thing in technical language,\nthe curious inversion of Plattner’s right and left sides is proof that he has\nmoved out of our space into what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that he\nhas returned again to our world. Unless we choose to consider ourselves the\nvictims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication, we are almost bound to\nbelieve that this has occurred.\n\nH. G. WELLS,\n\n“The Plattner Story,” 1896\n\nJust as no amount of sliding around in the plane ever could have turned A\nSquare into his own mirror image, no 3-D contortions could ever turn A Cube\ninto ![img](Images/p045_2.jpg) A. But, as the mathematician August Ferdinand\nMöbius discovered in 1827, it is in fact possible to turn a 3-D object into\nits mirror image by an appropriate rotation through four-dimensional space.\n\nSurprisingly enough, it is actually possible for our minds to perform such a\nrotation. Many readers will be familiar with the “reversing cube diagram,”\nalso known as the Necker cube. If one stares at a skeleton drawing of a cube\nfor a while, the mind’s 3-D interpretation of the figure flip-flops back and\nforth between the two versions shown. If you have trouble getting the figure\nto “do” this, it might help to focus your attention near the middle of the\ndrawing and try mentally “pushing” or “pulling” at one of the corners.\n\nWhat makes the Necker cube reversal so important here is that the two possible\n3-D interpretations of the original skeleton drawing are in fact mirror images\nof each other!\n\n![img](Images/p046_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 50. The Necker cube and its two interpretations._\n\nWe can see this if we draw A Cube’s features in on the Necker cube, and\nimagine that A Cube’s body is clear as glass. If we take the features to be on\nthe side of the cube closer to us, then we are looking just at A Cube, who has\na triangle eye on his right. But if we interpret the features as being on the\nside of the cube further away from us, then we are looking at a rear view of\n![img](Images/p045_2.jpg) A, A Cube’s mirror image, who has a triangle eye on\nhis _left._ If A Cube is transparent, then the original ambiguous figure can\nbe seen as either the Cube or the Cube’s mirror image.\n\n![img](Images/p046_2.jpg)\n\n_Can Kilroy see the bug?_\n\n[PUZZLE 4.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch4pa2)\n\n_Here is a very remarkable Necker-type illusion. Can the little man see the\nbeetle or not_?\n\nThe point of this is that the sort of twinkling rearrangement that takes place\nwhen a Necker cube reverses is equivalent to a rotation through the fourth\ndimension. It happens so fast it’s hard to catch, but if you watch it for a\nwhile it begins to feel like maybe you’re getting a peek into the fourth\ndimension. The hypercube drawing, by the way, is particularly good to look at\nin terms of Necker cube reversals. Stare at it as at a mandala and the thing\nfairly seethes with activity, doing its best to get hyper.\n\n![img](Images/p047_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 51.

After Necker reversal pulls the corner out at you,\nit looks like A Cube should. But when you break the illusion (by opening your\nother eye, or by turning the model far enough to show its back), then the\nthing “topples” through the fourth dimension back to the hollowed-out\n![img](Images/p047_3.jpg) A form.\n\n  1.

Design for the Neck-A-Cube._\n\nOnce the cube is reversed, it seems to move in an un-natural way. If you have\nit reversed and cradle it in your hand, then it will seem to stick up in the\nair and rock in the opposite way that your hand moves. An even more remarkable\neffect is obtained if you set the cube down, or glue it to the wall, and then\nreverse it. Now, if you can manage to hold it reversed as you move your head\naround, you will see the cube apparently turning so as to always stare right\nat you!\n\n“In actual, physical life I can turn as simply and swiftly as anyone. But men-\ntally, with my eyes closed and my body immobile, I am unable to switch from\none direction to the other. Some swivel cell in my brain does not work. I can\ncheat, of course, by setting aside the mental snapshot of one vista and\nleisurely selecting the opposite view for my walk back to my starting point.\nBut if I do not cheat, some kind of atrocious obstacle, which would drive me\nmad if I persevered, prevents me from imagining the twist which transforms one\ndirection into another, directly opposite. I am crushed, I am carrying the\nwhole world on my back in the process of trying to visualize my turning around\nand making my-self see in terms of ‘right’ what I saw in terms of ‘left’ and\nvice versa.”\n\nVLADIMIR NABOKOV,\n\n_Look at the Harlequins,_ 1974\n\nI should mention here that my model is based on a similar design by jerry\nAndrus, a brilliant illusionist living in Albany, Oregon. Andrus calls his\nreversing pattern a Parabox.\n\nStaring at the Neck-A-Cube too much before bedtime can lead to really\nunpleasant dreams. Although the fourth dimension is of great theoretical and\nphilosophical interest, there is something frightening and mind-warping about\nit when it starts to get too real. I remember in particular a series of dreams\nI had in 1976, soon after I carne to understand that left and right are\nconcepts as relative as up and down, or front and back.\n\nIn these dreams I would be walking down a street with someone on either side\nof me — my wife, Sylvia, let us say, on my left, and my friend Greg on my\nright. I would move out of my body and watch the three of us from a distance,\nfirst from a point in our space, then from a point entirely outside of space.\nWhat struck me was that _depending on which half of hyperspace I looked from,_\nthe order of the three people would be Sylvia-Rudy-Greg, or Greg-Rudy-Sylvia.\nIn my dream of walking down the street, I would begin to internalize such a\nshift, and the whole city around me would change back and forth between itself\nand its own mirror image. Some mornings I would wake up convinced that I and\nthe whole universe had been replaced by our mirror images overnight. The worst\nday of all was when I sat up in bed and actually saw the reversal taking\nplace: the whole room, furniture and all, rambunctiously do-si-do-ing about\ninto mirror reversal. But, of course, I couldn’t prove anything … I’d turned\nover, too.\n\n[PUZZLE 4.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch4pa3)\n\n_Looking at a Necker cube can help us to think about the fourth dimension. Can\nyou think of a “Flatland Necker Illusion” that A Square could use to help\nthink of the third dimension!_\n\nAfter these experiences I often wondered if there could be any objective fact\ncorrelated to a person’s feeling that the world has turned into its mirror\nimage. One possible idea that carne to mind was that a person might have a 4-D\ncomponent of mind that projects out of the brain and into hyperspace. If this\n“hyperbrain” material were to shift from being primarily on, let us say, the\n_ana_ side to being primarily on the _kata_ side, then one would be justified\nin saying that the world has changed — in the same way that the palm drawn in\nfigure 42 changes when an observer moves from one side to the other.\n\nSometimes I get so confused about left and right that all I’m really sure\nabout is what is next to what. I get this feeling if I go to England … or just\nwatch an English movie … where everyone drives on the left side of the road. A\nvery commonplace instance of left-right confusion arises if you happen to\nstudy your teeth in the mirror while feeling them with your tongue. Left and\nright can get hopelessly mixed up in short order. Charles Hinton, whom we will\ntalk about in the next chapter, felt that deliberately inducing such a\nconfusion about left and right was the best path to four-dimensional thought.\n\n\n## 5\n\n##  Ghosts from  \nHyperspace?\n\nSPIRITUALISM — the belief that spirits of the dead are nearby and eager to\ncontact us — has never been so popular as in the late nineteenth century.\nThroughout the United States, England, and Europe, amateur or professional\nmediums were organizing séances. A group of people would sit around a table in\na darkened room, the medium would moan and mutter, and then the spirits would\nmanifest themselves.\n\nAnd what would said spirits do? They would make noises: sharp raps on the\ntable. They would move things: turning or rocking the table and, occasionally,\neven lifting the table up into the air. They would send messages: often by\ncausing a piece of pencil to scratch some words on a slate held under the\ntable. They would materialize as white fogs, or sometimes as spirit hands that\nwould reach up over the table’s edge.\n\nSpiritualism mediums were, of course, under heavy suspicion of fraud from the\nvery beginning. People are so eager to believe in life after death that their\nreports of what they experience at a séance are not very reliable. No\naccumulation of colorful anecdotes can ever take the place of a really\nscientific investigation. The few scientists who believed in spiritualism\nbegan trying to find some kind of solid theory to support their belief in\nghosts.\n\nQuite abstractly, there seem to be two possibilities if spirits exist. Either\nthey are in our space, but very insubstantial, or they are somehow out side\nour space altogether. The idea of spirits as tenuous forms in our space was\npopular with some early spiritualists: they held that the spirits were made of\n“ectoplasm” or, even less concretely, of “vibrational energy.” One difficulty\nhere was that if the spirits were so very insubstantial, how could they do\nthings like lifting a heavy séance table?\n\n![img](Images/p052_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 54. Occult forces._\n\n(1) Physically, the souls of the dead come into the thraldom of certain living\nbeings who are called mediums. These mediums are, for the present at least, a\nnot widely diffused class, and they appear to be almost exclusively Americans.\nAt the command of these mediums, departed souls perform mechanical feats which\npossess throughout the character of absolute aimlessness. They rap, they lift\ntables and chairs, they move beds, they play on the harmonica, and do other\nsimilar things. (2) Intellectually, the souls of the dead enter a condition\nwhich, if we are to judge from the productions which they deposit on the\nslates of the mediums, must be termed a very lamentable one. These slate-\nwritings belong throughout in the category of imbecility; they are totally\nbereft of any contents. (3) The most favored, apparently, is the moral\ncondition of the soul. According to the testimony which we have, its character\ncannot be said to be anything else than that of harmlessness. From brutal\nperformances, such, for instance, as the destruction of bed-canopies, the\nspirits most politely refrain.\n\nWILHELM WUNDT,\n\n“Spiritualism, A Question of Science So-Called,” 1889\n\nNo such difficulty arises if we think of spirits as solid and substantial\nbeings, but here of course we have the question of why one doesn’t notice\nspirits very often if they really are so solid. The answer to this is to\nassert that the home of spirits is somehow outside our space entirely. How\nbest to have spirits live outside space? One could have them be infinitely far\naway, but then one would have the problem of how they can get here so rapidly\nwhen summoned up by a medium. A much more satisfactory explanation is to say\nthat _spirits live in the fourth dimension._\n\nThe beauty of this idea is that the spirits are wholly outside of our normal,\nmaterial space yet they are … at the same time … right next to us, waiting\njust a few feet _ana_ or _kata._ Although the idea of spirits as 4-D beings\nhad its greatest popularity in the nineteenth century, it had been hinted at\nsome two hundred years before, by the Cambridge Platonist Henry More\n(1614-1687). Like the scientific spiritualists, More was opposed to the idea\nthat spirits, angels, and Platonic forms could exist as insubstantial\nabstractions. He felt that if spirits really exist, then they must actually\n_take up space._ Yet, if a person’s soul takes up space, we have the question\nof how it can fit into the person’s solid physical body. In 1671, More carne\nup with the suggestion that spirits should be four-dimensional. He phrased\nthis in terms of an occult quality he called _spissitude,_ meaning something\nlike “denseness of substance.” His idea seems to have been that the\ndifferences between the physically identical bodies of a dead person and a\nliving person would be that the living body has more spissitude, and that\nspissitude is physically unobservable because it corresponds to a certain\nhyperthickness in the direction of the fourth dimension.\n\n![img](Images/p053_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 55. Body and soul._\n\nThe person who really popularized the spiritualist notion of ghosts from the\nfourth dimension was Johann Carl Friederich Zöllner (1834-1882). Zöllner was a\nprofessor of astronomy at the University of Leipzig, the same university where\nAugust Möbius made his 1827 discovery that it would be possible to turn a 3-D\nobject into its mirror image by a hyperspace rotation, and the same university\nwhere Gustav Fechner wrote his 1846 essay “Why Space Has Four Dimensions.”\nZöllner got his interest in spiritualism from an 1875 trip to England, where\nhe visited William Crookes, inventor of the cathode-ray tube.\n\nCrookes was very committed to spiritualism, and was the champion of the\nAmerican medium Henry Slade. When Slade’s stay in England ended in arrest and\nconviction for fraud, the medium went to visit Zöllner, who was eagerly\nwaiting for someone to help him prove that spirits are four-dimensional.\nAccording to Zöllner’s _Transcendental Physics_ of 1878, the experiments were\nan immediate success.\n\nThe first thing Slade did was to tie four simple overhand knots in a string\nZöllner provided. What made this feat so striking was that the string was\noriginally unknotted, with its ends joined together by a glob of sealing wax\nimpressed with Zöllner’s own seal. Of course, in reality Slade undoubtedly\nmanaged to switch the strings, but if he had not cheated, his trick would have\nbeen genuinely four-dimensional.\n\nWhy? Well, if a spirit could move a little segment of the string _ana_ out of\nour space, then it would be, for all practical purposes, like having a gap in\nthe string so that one could move it “through” itself to get a knot. Once the\nstring is in the proper position, you move the displaced segment back _kata_\nto our space and you’ve tied a knot without moving the ends of the string.\n\nThat’s one way to do it. An easier way is to tie the knot first and then seal\nthe ends together. In and of itself, a knotted string with its ends sealed\ntogether does not immediately make one believe that the knot was tied by a\nfour-dimensional spirit. Zöllner was of course aware of this, and he designed\nseveral interesting tests by which Slade’s spirit friends could have\nestablished lasting proof of their four-dimensionality. Three of the tests are\ndescribed in _Transcendental Physics:_\n\n![img](Images/p054_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 56. Zöllner’s string, before and after._\n\n1\\. Two wooden rings, one of oak, the other of alderwood, were each turned\nfrom one piece … Could these two rings be interlinked without breaking, the\ntest would be additionally convincing by close microscopic examination of the\nunbroken continuity of the fibre. Two different kinds of wood being chosen,\nthe possibility of cutting both rings from the same piece is likewise\nexcluded. Two such interlinked rings would consequently in themselves\nrepresent a “miracle,” that is, a phenomenon which our conceptions heretofore\nof physical and organic processes would be absolutely incompetent to explain.\n\n2\\. Since among products of nature, the disposition of whose parts is\naccording to a particular direction, as with snail-shells twisted right or\nleft, this disposition can be reversed by a four-dimensional twisting of the\nobject, I had provided myself with a large number of such shells, of different\nspecies, and at least two of each kind.\n\n3\\. From a dried gut, such as is used in twine-factories, a band without ends\nwas cut. Should a knot be tied in this band, close microscopic examination\nwould also reveal whether the connection of the parts of this strip had been\nsevered or not.\n\nSo the idea was that Slade’s spirits should link the two wood rings, turn some\nsnail shells into their mirror-image forms, and produce a knot in a closed\nloop of skin cut from a pig’s bladder. Did it work?\n\n![img](Images/p055_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 57. Evidence of 4-D ghosts? (Engraving from J. C. F. Zöllner,_\nTranscendental Physics.)\n\nSeldom happens just that which we, according to the measure of our limited\nunderstanding, wish; but if, looking back on the course of some years, we\nregard what has actually come to pass, we recognize gratefully the\nintellectual superiority of that Hand which, according to a sensible plan,\nconducts our fates to the true welfare of our moral nature, and shapes our\nlife dramatically to a harmonic whole.\n\nIn other words, no. Instead of doing what Zöllner had wanted, the spirits put\nthe rings around a table leg, moved a snail shell from the tabletop to the\nfloor beneath the table, and burned a spot on the bladder band.\n\nVery few scientists were convinced by Zöllner’s experiments. Although Zöllner\nhimself may well have been an honest man, he was almost unbelievably gullible\n— an unworldly scientist easily taken in by a professional charlatan like\nSlade. One might think that now, a century later, scientists could no longer\nbe fooled by cheap conjuring tricks, but this does not seem to be the case.\nJust a few years ago, Uri Geller — who is almost certainly a fraud — was able\nto obtain the backing and endorsement of a number of physicists at the\nStanford Research Institute. A glance at any supermarket tabloid makes it\nclear that the public’s interest in ghosts is greater than it has ever been.\n\n![img](Images/p055_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 58. Where the balls went in_ Poltergeist.\n\nMost modern ghost tales do not bring in the fourth dimension. An interesting\nexception is Steven Spielberg’s movie _Poltergeist._ The 4-D aspect of this\nmovie arises when balls that are thrown into the closet of one room appear\nfrom the ceiling of another room … indicating a route through the fourth\ndimension!\n\nThere have always been mysterious phenomena, and there always will be. Yet, as\nwe have often seen that the progress of science has again and again revealed\nas natural what former generations held to be supernatural, it is certainly\nwholly wrong to bring in for the explanation of phenomena which now seem\nmysterious an hypothesis like that of Zöllner, by which everything in the\nworld can be explained. If we adopt a point of view which regards it as\nnatural for spirits arbitrarily to interfere in the workings of the world, all\nscientific investigation will cease, for we could never more trust or rely\nupon any chemical or physical experiment, or any botanical or zoological\nculture. If the spirits are the authors of the phenomena that are mysterious\nto us, why should they also not have control of the phenomena which are not\nmysterious? The existence of mysterious phenomena justifies in no manner or\nform the assumption that spirits exist which produce them. Would it not be\nmuch simpler, if we _must_ have supernatural influences, to adopt the naive\nreligious point of view, according to which everything that happens is\ntraceable to the direct, actual, and personal interference of a single being\nwhich we call God?\n\nHERMANN SCHUBERT,\n\n“The Fourth Dimension,” 1898\n\nThe main effect of Zöllner’s work was that the fourth dimension began to seem\ndisreputable and unscientific. Yet his basic message, _spirits live in the\nfourth dimension,_ did not fall on totally deaf ears. The notion of beings\nliving in an unseen hyperspace world was taken up by turn-of-the-century\nProtestant clergymen all over England.\n\nThe best known of these clergymen is, of course, Edwin Abbott, but there were\nmany others who enthusiastically adopted the notion that heaven, hell, our\nsouls, the angels, and God himself could be comfortably lodged in some higher\ndimension. The basic credo of these Christian spiritualists can be found in A.\nT. Schofield’s 1888 book, _Another World:_\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that a higher world than ours is not only conceivably\npossible, but probable; secondly, that such a world may be considered as a\nworld of four dimensions; and thirdly, that the spiritual world agrees largely\nin its mysterious laws, in its language which is foolishness to us, in its\nmiraculous appearances and interpositions, in its high and lofty claims of\nomniscience, omnividence, etc., and in other particulars, with what by analogy\nwould be the laws, language, and claims of a fourth dimension …\n\nThough the glorious material universe extends beyond the utmost limits of our\nvision, even artificially aided by the most powerful telescopes, that does not\nprevent the spiritual world and its beings, and heaven and hell being by our\nvery side.\n\n![img](Images/p056_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 59. “Aided by the most powerful telescopes.”_\n\nFar from these spiritual regions occupying some small corner of the material\nuniverse, as surely as the greater includes the less, so surely is the\nmaterial universe, vast as it is, swallowed up in the spiritual.\n\n![img](Images/p057_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 60. God the Father_?\n\nTo a sophisticated thinker, there is something just a little too crude and\nmaterialistic about having souls and angels and God be literal chunks of\nhypermatter in four-dimensional space. Why precisely _four_?. If any kind of\nhigher-space view of higher reality is reasonable, I would think it to be the\nnotion that our souls are patterns _infinite_ -dimensional Hilbert space. A\nsecond objection to the idea of spirits and angels swarming about our space is\nthe feeling that, at higher levels, the whole concept of separately acting\nindividuals might well fall away.\n\nLet me illustrate this last thought with a Flatland picture, figure 61.\n\n![img](Images/p057_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 61. The One and the Many._\n\nWhat seems to be a collection of many individuals may turn out, at some higher\nlevel, to just be parts of one higher entity. There is something lacking in a\nworld view that leaves out the notion of higher unity and has diverse spirits\npoking at our world like pool sharks at a game of eight ball.\n\nAnother failing in spiritualism, Christian or not, is the reliance on\nanecdotes about miracles and psychic feats. If higher dimensions have any real\nmeaning for us, that meaning should be part of our ordinary life. I don’t\nbelieve in miracles; I don’t disbelieve in them. The whole subject just leaves\nme cold. You can walk on water? You can bend spoons? So what. You’ve proved\nthat nobody really walks on water? You’ve proved that nobody really bends\nspoons? I couldn’t care less. What I want to know is much simpler: _What is it\nlike to be alive_?\n\n![img](Images/p058_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 62. Bend that spoon._\n\n“We live in a three-dimensional space” is really quite a complex statement,\nand not a statement that every person would automatically think of as true.\nExplaining to someone why it is that space is three-dimensional really\ninvolves convincing them that they should think of the world around them in a\ncertain way. Imagine an alien culture whose architecture is not based on\ncubes. Without the inevitable three perpendicular lines in each corner of\none’s room, the notion of reducing all experiences to the oscillations of a\nthree-knobbed Etch-A-Sketch might seem a bit strange. What about feelings,\nwhat about levels of thought, what about dreams?\n\nWhat I am trying to suggest here is that perhaps we ourselves are, in some\nvery real sense, beings of more than three  dimensions. P. D. Ouspensky wrote\nsomething very interesting about this in his 1908 essay ’The Fourth\ndimension.”\n\nThe music faded into silence as the grotto became completely dark except for\nthe brilliantly illuminated front wall. The shadow of the minister rose before\nus. After announcing the text as Ephesians, [Chapter 3](11_Chapter3.html),\nverses 17 and 18, he began to read in low, resonant tones that seemed to come\ndirectly from the shadow’s head: “… that ye, being rooted and grounded in\nlove, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and\nlength, and depth, and height …”\n\nIt was too dark for note-taking, but the following paragraphs summarize\naccurately, I think, the burden of Slade’s remarkable sermon.\n\nOur cosmos — the world we see, hear, feel — is the three-dimensional “surface”\nof a vast, four-dimensional sea …\n\nWhat lies outside the sea’s surface? The wholly other world of God! No longer\nis theology embarrassed by the contradiction between God’s immanence and\ntranscendence. Hyperspace touches every point of three-space. God is closer to\nus than our breathing. He can see every portion of our world, touch every\nparticle without moving a finger through our space. Yet the Kingdom of God is\ncompletely “outside” of three-space, in a direction in which we cannot even\npoint.\n\nMARTIN GARDNER,\n\n“The Church of the Fourth dimension,” 1962\n\nton outlines in detail his system\n\nIf the fourth dimension exists, one of two things is possible. Either we\nourselves possess the fourth dimension, i.e., are beings of four dimensions,\nor we possess only three dimensions and in that case do not exist at all.\n\nIf the fourth dimension exists while we possess only three, it means that we\nhave no real existence, that we exist only in somebody’s imagination and that\nall our thoughts, feelings and experiences take place in the mind of some\nother higher being, who visualizes us. We are but products of his mind, and\nthe whole of our universe is but an artificial world created by his fantasy.\n\nIf we do not want to agree with this we must recognize ourselves as beings of\nfour dimensions.\n\nDo we not in sleep live in a fantastic fairy kingdom where everything is\ncapable of transformation, where there is no stability belonging to the\nphysical world, where one man can become another or two men at the same time,\nwhere the most improbable things look simple and natural, where events often\noccur in inverse order, from end to beginning, where we see the symbolical\nimages of ideas and moods, where we talk with the dead, fly in the air, pass\nthrough walls, are drowned or burnt, die and remain alive?\n\nAll this taken together shows us that we have no need to think that the\nspirits that appear or fail to appear at spiritualistic séances must be the\nonly possible beings of four dimensions. We may have very good reason for\nsaying that we are ourselves beings of four dimensions and we are turned\ntowards the third dimension with only one of our sides, i.e., with only a\nsmall part of our being. Only this part of us lives in three dimensions, and\nwe are conscious only of this part as our body. The greater part of our being\nlives in the fourth dimension, but we are unconscious of this greater part of\nourselves. Or it would be still more true to say that we live in a four-\ndimensional world, but are conscious of ourselves only in a three-dimensional\nworld. This means that we live in one kind of condition, but imagine ourselves\nto be in another.\n\nFor Ouspensky, the fourth dimension was not only a spatial concept but a type\nof consciousness, an awareness of greater complexities and higher unities. For\nhim, the mathematical study of the fourth dimension led quite naturally to a\nbelief in the teachings of mysticism. In their simplest form, these teachings\nare but two: _All is One_ and _The One is Unknowable._\n\n![img](Images/p060_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 63. All is One._\n\nWhat, you may ask, do these two high-sounding precepts have to do with the\nfourth dimension? Quite briefly, the first idea is that higher space can be\nviewed as a background of connective tissue tying together the world’s diverse\nphenomena. If one moves toward higher and higher conceptions of space, one is\ntending toward some ideal “Superspace” in which everything — near and far,\npast and future, big and small, real and imagined — is together in some great\nUnity.\n\nIn his 1885 essay “Many Dimensions” the great hyper-space philosopher Charles\nH. Hinton speaks very clearly and colorfully about his identification of the\nabstract idea of “space” with the “One” of mysticism:\n\nYet with them [the Eastern mystics] I feel an inward sympathy, for I too, as\nthey, have an inward communion and delight, with a source lying above all\npoints and turns and proofs — an inward companion, whose presence in my mind\nfor one half-hour is worth more to me than all the cosmogonies that I have\never heard of, and of which all the thoughts I have ever thought are but\nminutest fragments, mixed up with ignorance and error. What their [the\nmystics’] secret is I know not, mine is humble enough — the inward\napprehension of space.\n\nAnd I have often thought, travelling by railway, when between the dark\nunderground stations the lads and errand boys bend over the scraps of badly\nprinted paper, reading fearful tales — I have often thought how much better it\nwould be if they were doing that which I may call “communing with space.”\n’Twould be of infinite delight, romance, and interest; far more than are those\ncreased tawdry papers, with no form in them-selves or in their contents.\n\nAnd yet, looking at the same printed papers, being curious, and looking deeper\nand deeper into them with a microscope, I have seen that in splodgy ink stroke\nand dull fibrous texture, each part was definite, exact, absolutely so far and\nno farther, punctiliously correct; and deeper and deeper lying a wealth of\nform, a rich variety and amplitude of shapes, that in a moment leapt higher\nthan my wildest dreams could conceive.\n\nAnd then I have felt as one would do if the dark waters of a manufacturing\ntown were suddenly to part, and from them, in them, and through them, were to\nuprise Aphrodite, radiant, undimmed, flashing her way to the blue beyond the\nsmoke; for there, in these crabbed marks and crumpled paper, there, if you but\nlook, is space herself, in all her infinite determinations of form.\n\nSo for Hinton, space itself is the medium by which one is to grasp the world’s\nunity. And what of the second teaching of mysticism, _The One is Unknowable_?\nHere we must be clear on the sense in which the word “know” is to be used.\nMystically speaking, the One _is_ knowable, knowable in the sense that we can\nfeel space around us, knowable in the sense that we can open our hearts to\nfeel life and beauty and love. It is only for the _rational_ mind that the One\nis un-knowable.\n\n![img](Images/p061_1.jpg)\n\n _Fig. 64. The One is Unknowable._\n\nNo finite string of human symbols can really represent the ultimate reality:\ncall it God, the One, the Absolute, Everything, or what you will. The\nsituation here is a bit analogous to trying to understand an infinite set such\nas the set _N_ of all whole numbers (1, 2, 3, …). Given the idea of number, we\ndo have a pretty good understanding of what _N_ is — this higher understanding\nis to be likened to the mystical knowing of the One. But if we insist on a\ncomplete, explicit listing of members, then the set _N_ will always lie beyond\nour grasp — this is comparable to the rational mind’s inability to fully grasp\nthe One.\n\nIn the following long excerpt (also from “Many Dimensions”), Hinton makes\nclear the sense in which space is, at the deepest level, to be known by the\nheart and not by the brain.\n\nAnd, indeed, space is wonderful. We all know that space is infinite in\nmagnitude — stretching on endlessly.\n\nAnd when we look quietly at space, she shows us at once that she has infinite\ndimensions.\n\nAnd yet, both in magnitudes and dimensions there is something artificial.\n\nTo measure, we must begin somewhere, but in space there is no “somewhere”\nmarked out for us to begin at. This measuring is something, after all, foreign\nto space, introduced by us for our convenience.\n\nAnd as to dimensions, in order to enumerate and realize the different\ndimensions, we must fix on a particular line to begin with, and then draw\nother lines at right angles to this one.\n\nBut the first straight line we take can be drawn in an infinite number of\ndirections. Why should we take any particular one?\n\nIf we take any particular line, we do something arbitrary, of our own will and\ndecision, not given to us naturally by space.\n\nNo wonder then if we take such a course we are committed to an endless task.\n\nWe feel that all these efforts, necessary as they are to us to apprehend\nspace, have nothing to do with space herself. We introduce something of our\nown, and are lost in the complexities which this brings about.\n\nMay we not compare ourselves to those Egyptian priests who, worshipping a\nveiled divinity, laid on her and wrapped her about with ever richer garments,\nand decked her with fairer raiment.\n\nSo we wrap around space our garments of magnitude and vesture of many\ndimensions.\n\nTill suddenly, to us as to them, as with a forward tilt of the shoulders, the\ndivinity moves, and the raiment and robes fall to the ground, leaving the\ndivinity herself, revealed, but invisible; not seen, but somehow felt to be\nthere.\n\nAnd these are not empty words. For the one space which is not this form or\nthat form, not this figure or that figure, but which is to be known by us\nwhenever we regard the least details of the visible world — this space can be\napprehended. It is not the shapes and things we know, but space is to be\napprehended in them.\n\n![img](Images/p063_1.jpg)\n\n _Fig. 65. “The least details of the visible world.”_\n\nThe true apprehension and worship of space lies in the grasp of varied details\nof shape and form, all of which, in their exactness and precision, pass into\nthe one great apprehension.\n\nAnd we must remember that this apprehension does not lie in the talking about\nit. It cannot be conveyed in description.\n\nWe must beware of the attitude of standing openmouthed just because there is\nso much mechanics which we do not understand, but geometry and mathematics\nonly spring up there where we, in our imperfect way, introducing our own\nlimitations, tend towards the knowledge of inscrutable nature.\n\nIf we want to pass on and on till magnitude and dimensions disappear, is it\nnot done for us already? That reality where magnitude and dimensions are not,\nis simple and about us. For passing thus on and on we lose ourselves, but find\nthe clue again in the apprehension of the simplest acts of human goodness, in\nthe most rudimentary recognition of another human soul wherein is neither\nmagnitude nor dimension, and yet all is real.\n\n![img](Images/p063_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 66. “The simplest acts of human goodness.”_\n\nThe author of this strange yet compelling passage led — in the context of his\ntime — an equally strange life.\n\nCharles Howard Hinton, known to his family as Howard, was born in London in\n1853. His father, James, was a well-known author who over the course of his\nlife moved from being an ear surgeon to a religious philosopher to the\nchampion of a new sexual morality. In his declining years, James Hinton\nmanaged to surround himself with a circle of admiring women, most of whom were\nsexually intimate with him. One of his sayings was, “Christ was the Saviour of\nmen, but I am the saviour of women, and I don’t envy Him a bit!”\n\nHoward obtained his B.A. from Oxford in 1877, and soon after he married Mary\nBoole, daughter of the famous logician who invented “Boolean algebra.” In 1880\nHinton obtained a post as science master at the Uppingham School, meanwhile\ncontinuing work for a master’s degree in mathematics.\n\nDespite all of his education, Hinton felt somehow adrift, as if he could not\nget hold of any really concrete knowledge. For who knows what reason, he hit\non the idea of memorizing a cubic yard of one-inch cubes. That is, he took a\n36-by-36-by-36 block of cubes, assigned a two-word Latin name (for example,\n_Glans Frenum_) to each of the 46,656 units, and learned to use this network\nas a sort of “solid paper.” Thus, when he wished to visualize some solid\nstructure, he would do so by adjusting its size so that it fit into his cubic\nyard. Then he could describe the structure by reviewing the list of occupied\ncells. (Although this sounds incredible, it is not really impossible — Hinton\nhad a system that reduces the number of brute facts to 216.)\n\nAs it turned out, this seemingly insane idea was a fantastic source of\ninspiration for Hinton. For what he had in effect done was to create within\nhis mind the kind of “three-dimensional retina” that a 4-D being would have\n(as we discussed in [chapter 3](11_Chapter3.html)). Some mysterious\ninspiration drove Hinton forward on the correct path, and he next had the idea\nof learning his block of cubes in each of its twenty-four possible\norientations (six choices for the bottom face times four choices for the front\nface).\n\nThe result of this was that Hinton was now able to take a 3-D object and see\nits parts simply in terms of what is next to what, thus freeing himself from\nour spacebound concepts of front-back and up-down. Shortly after this, he took\nthe final step and let the concept of left-right fall away, thus arriving at a\nperfectly four-dimensional view of the world (as we discussed in [chapter\n4](12_Chapter4.html)). Now Hinton could, without difficulty, visualize all the\ncross sections of a hypercube, undisturbed by the way in which these cross\nsections can become their own mirror images depending on where the hypercube\nlies relative to our space.\n\nAs his understanding of the fourth dimension grew, Hinton set to writing about\nit. His first published essay, “What Is the Fourth dimension?,” appeared in\n1880 in the _Dublin University Magazine,_ was reprinted in the _Cheltenham\nLadies’ College Magazine_ of September 1883, and finally was released as a\npamphlet, with the crassly commercial subtitle “Ghosts Explained,” by Swann\nSonnenschein & Co. in 1884. In the period 1884-1896, Swann Sonnenschein\npublished nine pamphlets by Hinton, which were then collected in the two-\nvolume set _Scientific Romances._ Some of the pieces were essays on the fourth\ndimension, and some were what we would now call science fiction stories.\n\n![img](Images/p065_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 67. Hinton was a bigamist._\n\nHinton might have settled into a comfortable life like his father’s: the life\nof a writer respected by intellectuals and loved by many women. But in 1885\ndisaster struck. Charles Howard Hinton was arrested for bigamously marrying a\nwoman called Maude Weldon, with whom he had spent a week in King’s Cross\nHotel, and by whom he was the father of twins. The headmaster at Uppingham\nhad, till this time, been under the impression that Maude Weldon was Hinton’s\nsister — apparently she was a regular guest of Howard and his legitimate wife,\nMary. Of course, he lost his job. His career was ruined. When he carne up for\nsentencing in 1886 the magistrate let him off with a token three days in jail.\nSoon after this, Howard, Mary, and their children fled to a teaching post at a\nmiddle school in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nThe torment Hinton must have undergone during this period shows in two of his\n“Scientific Romances\": “Stella” and “An Unfinished Communication.” “Stella”\ntells of a girl whose guardian has made her invisible, so that she will not\nfall into the traps of vanity and physical love. Yet Stella does find a lover,\na man who forces her to wear clothes and make-up so that all can see her. It\nis easy to imagine that Maude Weldon is the model for Stella.\n\n“An Unfinished Communication” is a very strange story indeed. It tells of a\ndesperate man who seeks the services of an Unlearner, a man who can make him\nforget his horrible past. The Unlearner stresses the importance of living\nopenly and sharing one’s secrets, something Hinton must have been frantic to\ndo as he sank deeper and deeper into the morass created by his attempts to\nlive out his father’s free-love philosophy.\n\n![img](Images/p066_1.jpg)\n\n_A knot._\n\n**[PUZZLE 5.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch5pa1)**\n\n_A line or string can only be knotted in 3-D space: no string can be knotted\nin 2-D space, and no knot will stay tied in 4-D space. Why not? In 4-D space\nit is possible to knot a plane. Can you imagine how_?\n\nWhen Hinton left for Japan, he left a manuscript in the hands of two friends.\nThis book, _A New Era of Thought,_ appeared in 1888. Here Hinton outlines in\ndetail his system for learning to think four-dimensionally by manipulating a\nset of eighty-one colored cubes, cubes that are to stand for the eighty-one\nparts of a 3-by-3-by-3-by-3 hypercube. Hinton is at his most confident here,\nand he asserts that “the particular problem, at which I have worked for more\nthan ten years, has been completely solved. It is possible for the mind to\nacquire a conception of higher space as adequate as that of our three-\ndimensional space, and to use it in the same manner.”\n\nIn _A New Era of Thought_ Hinton also explains _why_ it should be possible for\nus to form 4-D thoughts. People sometimes feel that since our brains are made\nup of 3-D nets of neurons it is futile to hope to model 4-D patterns in our\nbrains. But, replies Hinton, is it not possible that our space has some slight\n4-D hyperthickness? If this is indeed the case, then the small bits of matter\nthat code up our thoughts may be free to form actual 4-D patterns, and 4-D\nthought is easily achieved.\n\n![img](Images/p067_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 68. Thick Square with mental image of A Cube._\n\nAlthough on account of his enthusiasm for metageometry he was never a great\nsuccess as an instructor in his college positions, he made many friends, and\nin Princeton endeared himself to the students by one of the most successful\npractical jokes ever perpetrated there. This was just after his perfection of\nthe baseball gun. He invited the faculty and students to a lecture at which he\ndemonstrated the machine and described its scientific theory. While he was\nupon the platform the lecture was interrupted by the arrival of a special\ndelivery postman who walked down the aisle and called to the professor. As he\nhad been the victim of many practical jokes and “horsed” by the students\naccording to the Princeton custom, the audience prepared for some absurd\ndiversion. After protesting against the interruption, but not being able to\nsend away the messenger, Prof. Hinton begged permission to look at a letter\nimportant enough to demand consideration at such a time. He read aloud, and\nhad turned two pages, reading an account of a baseball game in the year\n_1950,_ before the students discovered that the joke was upon them.\n\nGELETT BURGESS,\n\n“The Late Charles H. Hinton,” 1907\n\nIt was at one time possible to purchase sets of Hinton cubes from his\npublisher. I once made myself a set of them, and was somewhat disappointed.\nPlaying with the colored cubes may not really be the best way to start\nthinking four-dimensionally.\n\nEighteen ninety-three found Howard Hinton at Princeton University, as an\ninstructor in the Mathematics Department. Oddly enough, Hinton devoted most of\nhis energies while at Princeton to the invention of a “baseball gun.” The\npoint of having such a gun was that during the week’s practice sessions the\nPrinceton team could practice hitting really fast balls — without the pitchers\nhaving to wear out their arms. The gun could shoot a baseball at speeds of up\nto seventy miles per hour, and two rubber-coated steel fingers attached to the\nmuzzle made it possible to shoot curves as well.\n\nHinton was fired before long, and found his next job at the University of\nMinnesota. In 1900 he left Minnesota for Washington, D.C., where he worked\nfirst at the Naval Observatory and then at the Patent Office. His faithful\nwife Mary followed Howard through all these peregrinations, bearing him four\nsons. She was known in Washington as a lecturer on poetry.\n\nHinton died suddenly and dramatically at the age of fifty-four, in 1907. A\ncontemporary news article on his death, headlined SCIENTIST DROPS DEAD,\ndescribes how Hinton fell dead after complying with the toastmaster’s request\nfor a toast to “female philosophers,” at the annual banquet of the Washington,\nD.C., Society of Philanthropic Inquiry.\n\nCharles Howard Hinton lived a wild and varied life. I would like to think that\nwhat sustained him through it all was that mystical vision of space he enjoyed\nas a young man.\n\nI hope that by now most readers will have some feeling for the fourth\ndimension as a concept interesting in its own right. In [parts\nII](14_Part2.html) and [III](18_Part3.html) of this book we will proceed to\nsee how the fourth dimension can be used to understand the true nature of\nspace, matter, time, and mind.\n\n\n## Part II\n\n## SPACE\n\n\n## 6\n\n## What We’re Made Of\n\nWE ARE ACCUSTOMED to thinking of the world as made up of lumps of matter\nfloating in empty space. Matter is something, and space is nothing. But is\nthis really correct? In the past, many powerful thinkers have held that the\nspace between visible objects is filled with a subtler material, a smooth and\ncontinuous substance, a “universal plenum,” or _aether._\n\nOne does not hear much about the aether these days. But in the nineteenth\ncentury the concept was as commonplace as “fields” are now. In his article on\naether for the ninth edition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica,_ James Clerk\nMaxwell (1831-1879), founder of the modern theory of electromagnetism, wrote:\n\nWhatever difficulties we may have in forming a consistent idea of the\nconstitution of the aether, there can be no doubt that the interplanetary and\ninterstellar spaces are not empty, but are occupied by a material substance or\nbody, which is certainly the largest, and probably the most uniform body of\nwhich we have any knowledge.\n\nBut why bother filling space up with aether? What’s wrong with having space\njust be the empty background against which matter moves? One problem is that\nif space is really empty, then it’s hard to understand how gravitational force\ncan be transmitted. Isaac Newton set up his famous law of gravity as a\nquantitative description of the gravitational force, but he was keenly aware\nthat he lacked any understanding of how this force could act across the empty\ndistance of space. Writing in the late seventeenth century, Newton complains:\n\n![img](Images/p072_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 69. How do we send signals through the void_?\n\nWe have supposed in the case of a plane world that the surface on which the\nmovements take place is inactive, except by its vibrations. It is simply a\nsmooth support.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity let us call this smooth surface “the aether” in the\ncase of a plane world.\n\nThe aether that we have imagined to be simply a smooth, thin sheet, not\npossessed of any definite structure, but excited by real disturbances of the\nmatter on it onto vibrations, which carry the effect of these disturbances as\nlight and heat to other portions of matter. Now, it is possible to take an\nentirely different view of the aether in the case of a plane world.\n\nLet us imagine that, instead of the aether being a smooth sheet serving simply\nas a support, it is definitely marked and grooved.\n\nCHARLES H. HINTON,\n\n_A New Era of Thought,_ 1888\n\nIt is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation\nof something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter\nwithout mutual contact. That one body can act upon another at a distance,\nthrough a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else … is to me so great\nan absurdity, that I believe no man, who has in philosophical matters a\ncompetent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it.\n\nAs we will see shortly, the modern theory of gravity embodied in Einstein’s\ngeneral theory of relativity does use a sort of “space-filling aether” to\nexplain how gravitating bodies can influence the motions of faraway objects.\nFor Einstein, the continuous aether is simply space itself, and it is the\nbending of this aether in higher dimensions that produces gravitational\nattraction! But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nLate in the eighteenth century, Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel successfully\nadvocated the theory that light is a type of wave motion, rather than a stream\nof particles. A variety of optical effects, such as diffraction and\npolarization, seemed to indicate that light must be a vibration in some\nunderlying medium. It was assumed that outer space is filled with a\n“luminiferous aether,” which transmits the wave motion that is light. As the\nnineteenth century wore on, this aether carne to be regarded as the\ntransmitter of magnetic and electrical forces as well.\n\n![img](Images/p073_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 70. Wave-particle duality._\n\nNowadays we are comfortable with the quantum-mechanical idea that light is\nboth particle and wave. A photon is a wavy yet solid little package that can\nzip through empty space without the benefit of any invisible vibrating jelly\nunderfoot. Just to grasp how alien the notion of a luminiferous aether has\nbecome, try to picture a nineteenth-century drawing room from which all the\nluminiferous aether has been evacuated. The gas jets are burning but no one\ncan see them! A light source with no luminiferous aether to ferry the light’s\nvibrations would be like a bell pounding silently in an evacuated bell jar.\n\nThe idea of a room emptied of aether is, of course, quite unrealistic, for\nmost aether theorists felt that ordinary matter offered an open structure to\naether. In Thomas Young’s words, aether should be able to pass through solid\nobjects “like wind through a grove of trees.” If this is the case, then no\nroom’s walls could ever keep the aether out.\n\nThe idea of an aether wind blowing right through your body is sort of\nrefreshing. Sometimes, standing on the breezy crest of a hill, I have the\nillusion that the air is blowing through me, dusting off my molecules. If we\ndo think of aether as being the same as space, it would seem to make sense to\nthink of the aether as actually blowing through us as we move through space.\n\nBut does this _really_ make sense? Certainly we can move relative to other\nobjects, but is space the kind of thing one can move relative to? The answer,\nas it turns out, is 220. Sometimes one hears that modern physics has proved\nthere is no aether. What this actually means is that modern physics has proved\nthat it is meaningless to speak of motion relative to empty space. How did\nthis come about?\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, physicists and astronomers became interested\nin determining the Earth’s absolute motion. The idea was that space is filled\nwith stagnant, motionless aether, so that as our Earth and our solar system\nand our galaxy tumble about, we should feel some kind of aether breeze on our\nfaces. The direction in which the breeze feels strongest would then be the\ndirection in which we are really moving.\n\n![img](Images/p074_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 71. A light source, with and without aether wind._\n\n“Feeling the breeze” is of course a metaphorical way of speaking: the actual\nexperimental technique was to measure the speed of light in various\ndirections. Light would go fastest when traveling with the aether wind, and\nslowest when traveling directly against it.\n\nA number of attempts to thus measure the motion of the earth through the\naether were made, the most famous of these being the well-known Michelson-\nMorley experiment of 1887. The results were that a light signal always travels\nat the same speed, regardless of which direction it goes in. Feeling for the\naether wind by measuring speeds of light rays is like sticking a flag out of a\nspaceship to see which way you’re going. Nothing happens: there’s no air in\nouter space, and no wind.\n\n![img](Images/p075_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 72. No air, no wind._\n\nAfter the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, a few physicists\nstill hoped to find some alternative way of measuring the earth’s motion\nthrough space and the aether. But most scientists began to suspect that there\nis, even in principle, no possibility of detecting an aether wind. In 1905\nAlbert Einstein made just such an assumption, and created his enormously\npowerful special theory of relativity. This theory, which we will discuss in\nmore detail in [chapter 9](19_Chapter9.html), is based on two assumptions: (1)\nThe speed of light is always the same, and (2) There is no way to detect\nabsolute motion.\n\nThe first assumption was, by 1905, pretty well established on the basis of\nexperiments like Michelson and Morley’s. The second assumption is the one that\nrepresents a dramatically new way of looking at things. According to Einstein,\n_there is no possible way in which one can detect motion through empty space._\nHe jumps here from an experimental fact (that measuring speeds of light rays\ndoes not reveal an aether wind) to a blanket hypothesis (that no possible\nexperiment can ever detect an aether wind).\n\nMost of us smile when we hear of the nineteenth-century aether concept. But it\nis important to realize that insofar as we believe in space as something\nexisting in its own right, we too have an aether concept. Empty space is\naether, aether is empty space. But what, then, is the meaning of Einstein’s\nsecond assumption vis-à-vis aether? Here is what Einstein wrote on this\nquestion in his 1920 essay “Ether and Relativity.”\n\nMore careful reflection teaches us that the special theory of relativity does\nnot compel us to deny ether. We may assume the existence of an ether; only we\nmust give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it.\n\n![img](Images/p076_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 73. Space is like a sea’s surface._\n\nThink of waves on the surface of water. Here we can describe two entirely\ndifferent things. Either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the\nboundary between water and air alters in the course of time; or else — with\nthe help of small floats, for instance — we can observe how the position of\nthe separate particles of water alters in the course of time. If the existence\nof such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a\nfundamental impossibility in physics — if, in fact, nothing else whatever were\nobservable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in\ntime, we should  have no ground for the assumption that water consists of\nmovable particles. But all the same we could characterize it as a medium.\n\nGeneralizing we must say this: — There may be supposed to be extended physical\nobjects to which the idea of motion cannot be applied. They may not be thought\nof as consisting of particles which allow themselves to be separately tracked\nthrough time. The special theory of relativity forbids us to assume the ether\nto consist of particles observable through time, but the hypothesis of ether\nin itself is not in conflict with the special theory of relativity.\n\nUnfortunately the passion of the moment predominates, in the Frail Sex, over\nevery other consideration. In their fits of fury they remember no claims and\nrecognize no distinctions. I have actually known a case where a Woman has\nexterminated her whole household, and half an hour afterwards, when her rage\nwas over and the fragments swept away, has asked what has become of her\nhusband and her children …\n\nEven in our best regulated and most approximately Circular families I cannot\nsay that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in Spaceland. There\nis peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may be called by that name,\nbut there is necessarily little harmony of tastes or pursuits …\n\nEDWIN A. ABBOTT,\n\n_Flatland,_ 1884\n\nThe reader may wonder why Einstein bothers to go through such intellectual\ncontortions. If the aether isn’t made up of distinct trackable parts, then why\nbother with it? Why not just go ahead and say that empty space is pure\nnothingness? Why pretend that space is some continuous substance called\naether? Let’s go back to Flatland for an answer.\n\n![img](Images/p077_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 74.

Our hero\nis shackled in a heavy box with one opening. The Queen surges forward, her\nsharp end aglitter. She thrusts her point into the box’s small opening,\nthrusts again, and thrusts once more for good measure. But when they open the\nguillotine box, A Square is as good as new. What happened?\n\nTo understand what happened, we should start thinking of the space of Flatland\nas being somewhat like a rubber sheet or, even better, something like a huge\nunbreakable soap film. If A Cube seizes a piece of Flatland’s space and pulls\nup, then he can stretch a bit of the space to be bigger than one would expect.\nAnd this is just what he did. Cube grabbed the bit of space inside the\nguillotine box and stretched that space for all he was worth. The Queen’s\ntwelve-inch body was not long enough to reach over the “space bump” and get to\nA Square. Here is how it seemed to Square (I quote again from the imaginary\n_Further Adventures of A Square):_\n\n![img](Images/p078_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 75. A Cube stretching Flatland’s space._\n\nIf my account of what happened is confused, I can only say that this confusion\nreflects what I and my Countrymen all felt.\n\nThe Cube called out to me from Space as the Guillotine Box was fastened around\nme. Laughingly, he urged me to be composed and of good Cheer. In my unhappy\nstate, this seemed a frivolous, and even an unkind, request.\n\nAs the Queen approached, a curious tension thrilled through all my Being. The\nBox around me seemed to take on more spacious Dimensions. Somehow the hole in\nthe Box’s wall grew so deep that the Queen’s thirsty point could not attain to\nmy trembling flesh.\n\nWomen’s sharp Stingers are all but nerveless, and the Queen was not cognizant\nof her failure. Crying out that the Execution was accomplished, she withdrew.\nAn Isosceles busied himself with the opening of the Box.\n\nBut before this was achieved, I was again whirled about my central Axis. My\nnoblest Archetype, the Cube, had now restored me to my original Orientation.\nAs I babbled my thanks, he took yet one more Measure, did one fateful Deed\nthat has ensured my safety from that day on. He reached into the foul Circle’s\nbody and crushed the Tyrant’s heart.\n\n![img](Images/p079_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 76. Lumpy space._\n\nThe point of this story is that if we think of space as being made up of a\ncontinuous aether jelly, then it becomes meaningful to speak of stretching or\ndistorting space. Although, as Einstein stresses, we must not think of space\nas made up of particles, it is meaningful to think of space as having bumps\nand undulations. There is no absolute sense in which one might say that a\ngiven bump is moving this way or that, but one can certainly notice how the\nbumps move relative to each other.\n\nBumps in space (space _time_ , strictly speaking) can be used to explain\ngravitational attraction. Einstein’s 1915 general theory of relativity\nincorporates a theory of gravity that can best be understood as saying that\n(1) Matter and energy distort space, and (2) The distortions of space affect\nthe motions of matter and energy. Aether, or space, thus serves as the medium\nfor transmitting gravitational effects. Mass affects space, space affects\nmass. Let’s see how.\n\nWe must imagine that the space around any massive body is stretched. The\ndenser the mass, the greater the stretching. A good image for this is of a cue\nball resting on a rubber sheet. A sheet sags down around the ball. Or we could\nthink of a helium balloon under the sheet, making it sag up (as drawn in\nfigure 77). The “up” or “down” doesn’t matter here; the point is just that the\npresence of matter stretches space.\n\n![img](Images/p080_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 77. A massive body makes a bump in space._\n\nNow let’s try to see how the curvature of space affects the motion of\nparticles in space. A particularly clear-cut example arises if we let our\nmoving particle be a photon, a tiny piece of light.\n\n![img](Images/p080_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 78. The shortest path from_ A _to_ B.\n\nOrdinarily we think of light as traveling along straight lines. But if space\nis curved, there is no such thing as a _really straight_ line in space.\nNevertheless, light does travel along the _straightest possible_ lines.\nEquivalently, we can say that a light ray from point _A_ to point _B_ will\nalways go along the _shortest possible path_ from _A_ to _B._\n\nIf there is a big bump in space between _A_ and _B,_ then the shortest path\nwill not be directly over the bump. The shortest path will be the path that\ncompromises between going right over the bump and looping way out around it.\nThis is easy enough to understand if, in figure 78, we think of _A_ and _B_ as\nvillages separated by a mountain. The natural, shortest trail between the two\nis along the wavy line.\n\n![img](Images/p081_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 79. The shortest path from_ A _to_ B, _seen from above._\n\n![img](Images/p081_2.jpg)\n\n_Side view of Asirian telepathy._\n\n[PUZZLE 6.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa1)\n\n_In Astria, Charles H. Hinton’s version of Flatland, it is explicitly assumed\nthat the two-dimensional creatures have a slight thickness, and that they are\nsliding around on a hard surface. They are like cold cuts lying on a flat tray\nof space, a space that serves as an elastic medium for transmitting all kinds\nof vibrations. Deep within the tissue of his or her body, each Astrian has a\nsharp little 3-D bump, a sort of “astral vibrator.” This vibrator, about the\nsize of a phonograph needle, oscillates with the rhythm of each Astrian’s\nthoughts so as to set up sympathetic vibrations in the underlying space. Any\nother Astrian who is nearby can, without really knowing how, pick up the\nflavor of these thoughts from the vibrations of his own bump. What kind of\nimpression would the Astrians get of one of their fellows who had been turned\nover in the third dimension_?\n\nIf we look down at this path from above, it looks for all the world as if the\ngravitational attraction of the massive object had _bent_ the light ray by\n_pulling_ on it. Yet what has really happened is that the mass stretched the\nspace so that the shortest path from _A_ to _B_ has a bulge in it. The\ngravitational bending of the paths of material objects can also be explained\nin this way, although there the situation gets a little more complicated.\n\nIs the physical world in which we live a purely mathematical construct? Put\nthe question in another way: Is spacetime only an arena within which fields\nand particles move about as “physical” and “foreign” entities? Or is the four-\ndimensional continuum all there is? Is curved empty geometry a kind of magic\nbuilding material out of which everything in the physical world is made: (1) a\nslow curvature in one region of space describes a gravitational field; (2) a\nrippled geometry with a different type of curvature somewhere else describes\nan electromagnetic field; (3) a knotted-up region of high curvature describes\na concentration of charge and mass-energy that moves like a particle? Are\nfields and particles foreign entities immersed _in_ geometry, or are they\nnothing _but_ geometry?\n\nJOHN A. WHEELER,\n\n“Curved Empty Spacetime as the Building Material of the Physical World: An\nAssessment,” 1972\n\nSo gravity can be explained by assuming that matter curves space. But why\nshould matter do this? Why should matter curve space?\n\nOne explanation is that space curvature is what matter _is._ William K.\nClifford first proposed this theory in an 1870 paper called “On the Space\nTheory of Matter\":\n\nI hold in fact\n\n  1. That small portions of space _are_ in fact of a nature analogous to little hills on a surface which is on the average flat; namely, that the ordinary laws of geometry are not valid in them.\n  2. That this property of being curved or distorted is continually being passed on from one portion of space to another after the matter of a wave.\n  3. That this variation of the curvature of space is what really happens in that phenomenon which we call the _motion of matter,_ whether ponderable or ethereal.\n  4. That in the physical world nothing else takes place but this variation, subject (possibly) to the law of continuity.\n\n![img](Images/p082_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 80. Three bits of matter in space._\n\nThis is a very interesting view of matter, a view that the contemporary\nphysicist John Wheeler has called _geometrodynamics._ Traditionally, people\nthought of matter as a solid substance floating in empty space. But under the\ngeometrodynamic viewpoint, space is not really empty and matter is not really\nsolid. Space is an aether, a continuous substance that is curved in higher\ndimensions. And matter is a sort of patterning in the aether.\n\nThis idea is intellectually satisfying because it represents the completion of\na dialectic triad. Before we had as _thesis_ the concept of solid matter, and\nas _antithesis_ the concept of utterly empty space. Matter versus space;\nsomething versus nothing. The _synthesis_ is to regard space and matter both\nas a continuous aether substance: when the aether is flat it looks like empty\nspace, when it is sharply curved it looks like matter. The old thesis and\nantithesis are simply different aspects of the higher synthesis!\n\n![img](Images/p083_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 81. A vortex thread._\n\nClifford’s notion of building up matter out of pure curved space was a very\nbold step forward. A few years earlier, William Thomson had taken a partial\nstep in this direction. Rather than taking matter to be higher-dimensional\n“bumps” in aether or empty space, Thomson proposed that matter is made up of\nthree-dimensional vortex rings in the aether.\n\nA “vortex ring” is something like a smoke ring, a circle of substance that\nswirls around and around on itself. Thomson’s theory was inspired by Hermann\nvon Helmholtz’s 1857 proof that in a perfect fluid, any whirlpools or vortices\nmust be centered on lines that either go out to the boundaries of the fluid or\ncurve back on themselves to make circles. In watching the water drain out of a\nbathtub, one often observes a vortex line of the first type: a wobbly,\nthreadlike whirlpool running from the water’s surface to the drain below. The\nfunnel of a tornado is a similar example of a vortex thread. Now if the vortex\nthread bends back on itself to make a circle, one gets a vortex ring. The\nremarkable thing about vortex rings is that they consist of a closed-off\nregion of the underlying fluid. This can be seen in watching a smoke ring. For\na while at least, a smoke ring does not gain or lose any air … It consists of\nthe same smoky air circling around and around on itself.\n\n![img](Images/p084_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 82. A vortex ring._\n\n![img](Images/p084_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 83. A smoke-ring projector. (Engraving from A. E. Dolbear,_ Matter,\nEther, and Motion.)\n\n[PUZZLE 6.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa2)\n\n_As in puzzle 6.1, we will think about Astrians as being two-dimensional\ncreatures who slide about on top of their space-aether. Each Astrian has a\nkind of higher-dimensional tooth that digs down into the firm, underlying\nspace. How might the Astrians use meditation techniques to levitate_?\n\nSome nineteenth-century investigators actually built smoke-ring projectors and\nspent hours watching how smoke rings move, vibrate, and bounce off each other.\nThe hope was that the various properties of matter could all be explained by\ntreating atoms as vortex rings in some perfectly frictionless underlying\naether. A particularly nice feature of the vortex-ring theory was that it\nexplained how atoms could have a measurable size, yet be indivisible: a smoke\nring has a certain radius, but if you try to cut the ring in half you get\nnothing but some rapidly dispersed air currents.\n\n![img](Images/p085_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 84. The title page from Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Tait’s_ The\nUnseen Universe.\n\nIf in the body there be no other material than the visible particles, and in\nthe brain no other material than a certain quantity of phosphorous and other\nthings, such as we know them in the common state, and if individual\nconsciousness depends upon the structural presence of these substances in the\nbody and brain, then when this structure falls to pieces there are of course\nreasonable grounds for supposing that such consciousness has entirely ceased.\nBut it is the object of this volume to exhibit various scientific reasons for\nbelieving that there is something beyond that which we call the visible\nuniverse; and that individual consciousness is in some mysterious manner\nrelated to, or dependent upon, the interaction of the seen and unseen.\n\nBALFOUR STEWART AND PETER GUTHRIE TAIT,\n\n_The Unseen Universe,_ 1875\n\nThe vortex-ring theory of matter failed to lead to any testable predictions,\nand was eventually abandoned. One of the last books to advocate the theory was\na curious work called _The Unseen Universe_ (1875). The book seems to say that\nthe _soul_ exists as a knotted vortex ring in the aether. By way  of\nillustrating this notion, the authors (Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Tait)\nput a picture of a knot on the title page and the binding of their book.\n\nWhether this vast homogeneous expanse of isotropic matter [the aether] is\nfitted not only to be a medium of physical interaction between distant bodies,\nand to fulfill other physical functions of which, perhaps we have as yet no\nconception, but also as the authors of _The Unseen Universe_ seem to suggest,\nto constitute the material organism of beings exercising functions of life and\nmind as high or higher than ours are at present, is a question far\ntranscending the limits of physical speculation.\n\nJAMES CLERK MAXWELL,\n\n“The Aether,” 1876\n\nAlthough it is not immediately evident, the image of a knotted vortex ring\ninvolves the fourth dimension. The reason for this is that it is impossible to\npass a vortex ring through itself; it has a kind of integrity or solidity akin\nto that of an actual ring of material substance. Just as Slade and Zöllner\nclaimed that higher-dimensional spirits could knot their sealed cords, the\nauthors of _The Unseen Universe_ held that God creates our immortal souls by\nputting intricate knots and braids into vortex rings of aether. James Clerk\nMaxwell was amused and fascinated by this notion, and wrote a poem about it:\n\nMy soul is an entangled knot,\n\nUpon a liquid vortex wrought\n\nBy Intellect in the Unseen residing.\n\nAnd thine doth like a convict sit,\n\nWith marlinspike untwisting it,\n\nOnly to find its knottiness abiding;\n\nSince all the tools for its untying\n\nIn four-dimensional space are lying.\n\n![img](Images/p086_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 85. “My soul is an entangled knot.”_\n\n![img](Images/p086_2.jpg)\n\n_An Astrian slides_ on _space, but a Flatlander is embedded_ in _space._\n\n[PUZZLE 6.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa3)\n\n_We assume that the Flatlanders are actually_ in _their space, like inkblots\nin thin paper, or like color swirls in a soap film. A Flatlander cannot exist\noutside of his or her space. But how, then, was A Cube able to lift A Square\nout of Flatland’s space and turn him over_?\n\nAs the nineteenth century drew to a close, more and more bizarre theories\ninvolving matter, aether, and the fourth dimension began to appear — theories\nthat make one think of baroque, overdone ornamentation, of layer after layer\nof Victorian corsets and petticoats, of opulent, fin de siècle decadence.\n\n![img](Images/p087_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 86. Water squirts._\n\nIn 1892, for instance, Karl Pearson proposed in his _Grammar of Science_ that\nthe aether is a four-dimensional fluid seeping into our three-dimensional\nspace — sort of like water welling up through the holes in the bottom of a\nboat:\n\nIn this theory an atom is conceived to be a point at which ether flows in all\ndirections into space; such a point is termed an _ether squirt._ An ether\nsquirt in the ether is thus something like a tap turned on under water, except\nthat the machinery of the tap is dispensed with in the case of the squirt. Two\nsuch squirts, if placed in ether, move relatively to each other, exactly like\ntwo gravitating particles, the mass of either corresponding to the mean rate\nat which ether is poured in at the squirt.\n\n[PUZZLE 6.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa4)\n\n_Suppose we believe, along with Einstein, that it is possible to permanently\nmark or label a given point in space. But now suppose that we find a hole in\nspace. Doesn’t the hole serve to single out a definite space location_?\n\nA fourth dimension is involved in Pearson’s theory, for this higher dimension\nis needed to store the “machinery of the taps;/ that bring the flow of aether\nto each atom. Two such aether squirts will indeed attract each other because\nthe aether between them is moving more rapidly than in the other parts of\nspace. Let me briefly explain why. There is a law of fluid dynamics called\nBernoulli’s law, which says that the more rapidly a fluid moves, the lower its\npressure is. Since the aether between the squirts moves rapidly, there is a\nlow-pressure region between them, and the rest of the aether will tend to\ncompress this low-pressure region. Thus the two squirts will move together as\nif drawn by gravitational attraction.\n\n![img](Images/p088_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 87.

Recently astronomers found two\nquasars that seem to be unusually close to each other. Further analysis of\nthese two spots of light revealed that what we are seeing is actually two\nimages of the same quasar. This is explained by assuming there is a massive\ngalaxy between us and the quasar. Can you find a “space bump” diagram that\nshows how one quasar’s image can be split into two_?\n\n[PUZZLE 6.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa6)\n\n_Generally we have represented the space curvature caused by a bit of mass as\na rounded-off hump. Suppose that bits of mass were actual points. What kind of\nspace shape would best represent such a mass point_?\n\nCrazy theories … but none of them crazy enough to be right!\n\nIn [chapter 11](21_Chapter11.html) we’ll look at the modern way of building\nmatter up from space-aether. Clifford’s idea that matter is a bump in space is\nbasically correct — but he was too conservative in assuming the underlying\nspace to be three- or four-dimensional. According to modern quantum mechanics,\na bit of matter is a “bump” in an _infinite_ -dimensional Hilbert space!\n\n\n## 7\n\n##  The Shape of Space\n\nIN THE LAST CHAPTER we briefly mentioned the idea that space can be _curved,_\ncurved by bulging it out into the fourth dimension. We looked at two kinds of\nspace curvature: the medium-scale curvature associated with gravitational\nattraction, and the small-scale curvature that may account for matter. Now we\nare going to talk about the large-scale curvature of space taken as a whole.\n\nTo make quite clear what is meant by this talk of different “scales of\ncurvature,” consider the following. On the large scale, we say that the\nsurface of the Earth is curved into the shape of a sphere — a sphere that\nbulges a bit at the equator. On the medium, human-sized scale, we notice that\nthe Earth’s surface is covered with hills and valleys. And on the small scale,\nthe Earth’s surface breaks into individual rocks and clods of dirt.\n\n![img](Images/p090_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 88. Medium-scale curvature._\n\nNow, once again, when I speak of the _small-scale curvature of space,_ I am\nthinking of tiny bumps or bubbles or vortices that might conceivably be the\nsame as elementary particles of matter. When I talk about the _medium-scale\ncurvature of space,_ I am referring to the planet-sized and galaxy-sized space\nhumps that, according to Einstein, account for the effects of gravitational\nattraction. And now, when I talk about the _large-scale curvature of space,_ I\nam asking about the overall shape of our universe.\n\n![img](Images/p091_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 89. What is the shape of space_?\n\nIn cosmology the reliance on physical simplicity, pure thought and revealed\nknowledge is carried well beyond the fringe because we have so little else to\ngo on. By this desperate course we have arrived at a few simple pictures of\nwhat the Universe may be like. The great goal now is to become more familiar\nwith the Universe, to learn whether any of these pictures may be a reasonable\napproximation, and if so how the approximation may be improved. The great\nexcitement in cosmology is that the prospects for doing this seem to be\nexcellent.\n\nP. J. E. PEEBLES,\n\n_Physical Cosmology,_ 1971\n\nWhat is the shape of space? Is it flat, or is it bent? Is it nicely laid out,\nor is it warped and shrunken? Is it finite, or is it infinite? Which of the\nfollowing does space resemble more: (a) a sheet of paper, (b) an endless\ndesert, (c) a soap bubble, (d) a doughnut, (e) an Escher drawing, (f) an ice\ncream cone, (g) the branches of a tree, or (h) a human body?\n\nQuestions about the overall shape of space belong to the science called\ncosmology. I love cosmology: there’s something uplifting about viewing the\nentire universe as a single object with a certain shape. What entity, short of\nGod, could be nobler or worthier of man’s attention than the cosmos itself?\nForget about interest rates, forget about war and murder, let’s talk about\n_space._\n\nThe ancients seem usually to have thought of our universe as bounded. Either\nthe Earth itself actually had edges, or the Earth was to be thought of as a\nball floating inside a large crystal sphere on which the stars were hung. But\nto a modern thinker, the notion of a universe with edges is almost\ninconceivable.\n\n![img](Images/p092_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 90. A finite, bounded universe._\n\nWhat would it be like to come to a place where space stops? Think of a black\ndoorway opening onto Nothingness. Any object that passes through the doorway\nsimply ceases to exist. Beyond the door there is no aether, no space to\nsustain an object’s structure. Such a “door into Nothing” is perhaps a little\nbit like a star that has collapsed to form a black hole. Maybe there are such\ndoors scattered here and there in our universe. But still, we feel that such\ndoors do not exist on any extremely large scale … We do not think that our\nspace, taken as a whole, has edges. In other words, we believe that our space\nis unbounded.\n\n![img](Images/p092_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 91. A hole in space._\n\n![img](Images/p093_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 92. Three types of 1-D space: finite and bounded, infinite and\nunbounded, finite and unbounded._\n\nWhere the sun’s rays grazing the earth in January pass off and merge into\ndarkness lies a strange world.\n\nTis a vast bubble flown in a substance something like glass, but harder far\nand untransparent.\n\nAnd just as a bubble blown by us consists of a distended film, so this bubble,\nvast beyond comparison, consists of a film distended and coherent.\n\nOn its surface in the course of ages has fallen a thin layer of space dust,\nand so smooth is this surface that the dust slips over it to and fro and forms\ndensities and clusters as its own attractions and movements determine.\n\nThe dust is kept on the polished surface by the attraction of the vast film;\nbut, except for that, it moves on it freely in every direction.\n\nAnd here and there are condensations wherein have fallen together numbers of\nthese floating masses, and where the dust condensing for ages has formed vast\ndisks.\n\nCHARLES H. HINTON,\n\n“A plane World,” 1884\n\nAt first blush, one is inclined to think that if space is unbounded, then it\nmust be infinite as well. But this is not the case. In _one_ dimension, a\ncircle is an example of a line that is finitely long, yet has no ends. You can\nwalk round a circle forever. The surface of a sphere, such as Earth, is an\nexample of a two-dimensional space that is finite and unbounded. In a famous\n1854 lecture, “The Hypotheses Which Lie at the Foundations of Geometry,”\nBernhard Riemann first suggested that something similar is also possible for\n_three_ -dimensional space:\n\nIn the extension of space-construction to the infinitely great, we must\ndistinguish between _unboundedness_ and _infinite extent._ The unboundedness\nof space possesses a greater empirical certainty than any external experience.\nBut its infinite extent by no means follows from this. If we ascribe to space\nconstant curvature, then space must necessarily be finite provided this\ncurvature has ever so small a positive value.\n\nRiemann is suggesting here that our space may be the 3-D hypersurface of a 4-D\nhypersphere. Back in [chapter 3](11_Chapter3.html) we talked about what\nhyperspheres look like from the outside. Now we want to try to imagine what a\nhypersphere looks like from a point on its hypersurface. We turn, of course,\nto A Square. What would it be like for the Flatlanders to live not on a plane\nbut on the surface of a 3-D sphere?\n\n[PUZZLE 7.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa1)\n\n_Although no line on a curved surface is_ really _straight, some lines are\nstraighter than others: straighter in the sense of being shortest paths. Such\nstraightest possible lines are called the_ geodesics _of the surface. What\nkinds of lines do you think are geodesics on a sphere!_\n\nThe theme of “Sphereland” has been treated many times  before. What I’d like\nto do here is to approach the theme from a new angle.\n\nBy way of introduction to the tack I’m going to take, I should confess that\nthis summer (it’s October now) I was, for a time, happily obsessed with the\nfictional notion that Flatland really exists, and that Edwin Abbott used to go\nlook at it all the time. Normally, we think of Flatland as an infinite plane,\nbut so far as we can see, there are no glistening, polygon-filled infinite\nplans floating around anywhere near the planet Earth. Since we don’t see\nFlatland, I reasoned that it must be hidden somewhere — in a basement, let us\nsay. So now I had an interesting problem to think about: How might one fit an\nunbounded two-dimensional world inside an ordinary three-dimensional room?\n\n![img](Images/p094_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 93. Let’s put Flatland in the basement!_\n\nSuppose we had a tube of exceedingly small bore bent into a circular shape,\nand within this tube a worm. Then in the limiting case when we make the bore\nof the tube and the worm indefinitely fine, we shall be considering space of\none dimension. Assuming that the worm is incapable of recognizing anything\noutside its own tube-space, it would still be able to draw certain inferences\nas to the nature of the space in which it existed were it capable of\ndistinguishing some mark _C_ on the side of its tube. Thus it would notice\nwhen it returned to the point _C_ , and it would find that this return would\ncontinually recur as it went round in the bore; in other words, the worm would\nreadily postulate the finiteness of space. Further, since the worm would\nalways have the same _amount of bending,_ since all parts of a circle are of\nthe same shape, it might naturally assume the sameness of all space, or that\nspace possessed the same properties at all points.\n\nWILLIAM K. CLIFFORD,\n\n_The Common Sense of the Exact Sciences,_ 1879\n\nWell, I thought of three ways to fit Flatland in the basement. Here’s the\nfirst, presented as excerpts from the first-person account of one Arnold\nKlube. As the first excerpt begins, Klube is about to find Sphereland in the\nbasement of an abandoned technical school.\n\nEXCERPTS FROM ARNOLD KLUBE’S _God of Sphereland_\n\nThe door closed behind me and I moved carefully down the dusty stairs. At the\nbottom I found a light switch. Slowly, hesitantly, I snapped it on.\n\nThe small basement room was dominated by a large sphere, apparently\nweightless. Nearly two meters in diameter, the sphere hovered a few\ncentimeters above the floor. Could this be Flatland?\n\nI moved closer and examined the object’s shimmering surface. It was like the\ntaut skin of a large soap bubble: transparent, yet patterned with shifting\nflecks of color. At first all was confusion, but as I looked closer I began to\nmake out little avenues along which the color flecks moved. These bright,\ndarting animacules were undoubtedly the Flatlanders.\n\n![img](Images/p095_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 94. Sphereland in the basement._\n\nOn one side of the room I found a bench lined with scientific instruments,\nmost notably a stand-mounted binocular microscope. Trembling a bit in my\nexcitement, I set the microscope up next to the wonderful sphere.\n\nI will present the facts as succinctly as possible. The world which I have\ndiscovered is a two-dimensional film curved into the shape of a sphere some\nfive meters in circumference. The inhabitants of this world — which I call\nSphereland — are small polygonal dots, with an average width of one-tenth\nmillimeter. Their space is thus of a circumference equal to some 50,000 body\nlengths. By way of comparison, note that 50,000 human body lengths comes to\n100 kilometers.\n\nBefore long, I learned to read the “lips” of the Spherelanders, and to\nunderstand their language. As Abbott has reported, they are under the\nimpression that they are living in an infinite plane! It is easy enough for us\nto imagine walking 100 kilometers, but the fact of the matter is that no\nSpherelander has ever made the journey “around” space.\n\nThere are good reasons for this. If we recall that the surface area of a\nsphere is given by the formula _E_ 2 / π, where _E_ is the sphere’s equatorial\ncircumference, then it is easy enough to calculate that Sphereland has space\nto accommodate less than one billion of its citizens, even were they to be\npacked edge to edge. So far as I can estimate, the actual population of\nSphereland numbers some fifty million souls. Thus, each of the Spherelanders\nhas at his or her disposal an amount of empty space but twenty times that of\nhis or her body — the equivalent, in our terms, of a low-ceilinged prison cell\njust long enough to lie down in.\n\n![img](Images/p096_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 95. Arnold Klube._\n\nSphereland, in short, is extremely crowded. The entire space is filled with\nbodies and buildings. The crooked little lanes are as packed with life as any\nFar Eastern bazaar. Thieves and murderers are everywhere, and to travel any\ngreat distance is a virtual impossibility.\n\nDays passed into months, and still I hovered over Sphereland, attentive as an\nidle god. I found on the workbench certain tools, apparently designed for\nmanipulating the little creatures’ space.\n\nUpon experimentation, I learned that the space of Sphereland is not quite two-\ndimensional after all. It has a definite, though all but imperceptible,\nthickness. Using some special tweezers and a small cutting frame, I was\nactually able to take out and examine bits of the space. In one case, I lifted\nout a certain Square, turned him over, and set him back.\n\nThe altered Square’s appearance was such that his fellows sought to destroy\nhim. I rescued him and annihilated his chief oppressor. The Square is quite\ndevoted to me now and believes, having seen certain objects which I thrust\ninto his space, that I am a Cube.\n\n![img](Images/p097_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 96. Each point on a sphere is equally central._\n\nMany present-day scientists feel that our space is indeed curved into a\nhypersphere. Recall from the last chapter that we can take Einstein’s general\ntheory of relativity to mean that matter curves space. Apparently, if there is\nenough matter in our universe, then the cumulative curvature will be enough to\nbend our space back on itself. If space is hyperspherical, then there are a\nlimited number of galaxies, yet no galaxy is out on the edge of things. Each\ngalaxy is in an equally central position. This is analogous to the fact that\nany country on Earth can view itself as the central point on the planet.\n\nIf our space is hyperspherical, then flying a spaceship in any fixed direction\nlong enough should eventually lead back to our galaxy. Unfortunately, the\ncircumference of our hypersphere is so great that it is unlikely that any\nMagellan of space will ever carry out such a circumnavigation. One estimate is\nthat our space is about eighty billion light-years in circumference!\n\nJust to get a good image of hyperspherical space, imagine yourself to be\nfloating in a space that’s been curved into the shape of a hypersphere a\nhundred meters in circumference. You’re the only object in the space, so it’s\nreally dark. You fumble a flare out of your spacesuit, light it … and for some\nreason there’s _two_ lights. There’s the flare right next to you, and there’s\na flare fifty meters off! What’s more, there’s somebody else in the space with\nyou, a spacesuited person holding the other flare.\n\n![img](Images/p098_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 97. An un-American world view._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa2)\n\n_Suppose we were to discover a big bright star with nothing inside it but\nlight and empty space. What might we conclude_?\n\n[PUZZLE 7.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa3)\n\n_Most cosmologists assume that any one region of our universe is more or less\nlike any other region. This assumption is known as the_ cosmological\nprinciple. _There is no over-whelming body of evidence for the cosmological\nprinciple. People just like it because it makes things simpler. But now\nsuppose the cosmological principle is wrong. Suppose that there is a single\nmost important object in our universe — a unique mammoth object that is very\nmuch more massive than anything else. If you combine this supposition with the\nassumption that space curves back on itself like a hypersphere, what kind of\nuniverse do you get? Can you draw a Flatland_ _I_ _Sphereland-style picture of\nsuch a space_?\n\nYou decide to go visit the other person with the flare. You leave your flare\nbehind, just floating there, and push yourself through the empty space by\nmeans of a little hand-held jet you happen to have handy. Your flare and the\nother person’s flare stay immobile … but now he’s running away from you! He —\nor is it she? — is upside-down relative to you, and no matter which way you\ngo, he (or she) changes direction to keep you from getting any closer. Could\nthe other person be some sort of mirror image?\n\n![img](Images/p099_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 98. A Square sees a ghost image._\n\nYes. Think of A Square on the surface of a small sphere. We assume that the\nSphereland light rays move around the spherical space in great circles. What\nwe can notice in figure 98 is that all the light rays that start out from\nSquare’s body recross each other at the opposite side of the sphere. This\nmeans that Square will see a bunch of images of pieces of his body over on the\nother side of the sphere, and as it turns out, these images will fit together\nto make a ghost image of himself, upside-down and mirror-reversed.\n\nTo continue. You decide to go look at the other person’s flare. It floats\nthere, blazing away, but when you reach out to touch it you find that nothing\nis there. Why? Because the “other flare” is in fact a virtual image of your\nreal flare. It is a ghost image formed at the place where all the light rays\nfrom your real flare cross each other.\n\nCuriouser and curiouser. After returning to your flare you decide that it’s\ngetting too cramped in your spacesuit. You take out a tremendous rubber\nballoon, crawl inside it, and begin filling it up with air from your tank.\nYou’ve brought the flare along, so the balloon is all lit up inside. It’s nice\nto be inside the balloon and not to have to see the weird ghost images of the\nflare and yourself. You take off your suit and loll against the balloon’s\ngently curving wall. The tank next to you is hissing away, and the balloon is\ngrowing.\n\n![img](Images/p100_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 99. A Square in the weird balloon._\n\n![img](Images/p100_2.jpg)\n\n_A flat space with distorted distances._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa4)\n\n_Here is a two-dimensional pattern of lines. Suppose that in 3-D space you\nwere to stretch this surface so that the distances between each neighboring\npair of lines became the same. What shape would the surface take_?\n\nSuddenly, something is wrong. The balloon wall goes flat and starts curving\naway from you. You are outside the balloon! The tank is still next to you but\nthe air seems thinner. The balloon rapidly shrinks away from you, down to\nbeach-ball size, and collapses. What happened?\n\nPush it down a dimension and look at A Square. A Flatland balloon is just an\nelastic circle. When it expands past the equator it is able to shrink back\ndown to starting size … on the other side of spherical space.\n\nThis is a really odd feature of hyperspherical space. Any sphere that expands\nlong enough ends up by expanding past the maximum possible size and continuing\nto “expand” on down to point size. You can visualize this in our own universe\nby thinking of a fleet of survey ships flying away from Earth in different\ndirections. If they travel at the same speed, the ships will lie on the\nsurface of an expanding sphere centered on Earth. After a while the pilots\nwill notice, to their surprise, that although no one has changed course the\nships are drawing closer and closer together. The unsurveyed space has become\na shrinking sphere! When the ships meet up they’ll be as far from Earth as\nit’s possible to get. And there will be no surprises left.\n\n![img](Images/p101_1.jpg)\n\n_A Möbius strip._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.5](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa5)\n\n_A Möbius strip is formed by taking a strip of paper, giving it a half-twist,\nand taping the two ends together. Think of A Square as an ink pattern that\nsoaks right through the paper of a Möbius strip. If he slides around the\nstrip, what happens to him_?\n\nSo now we have a pretty good image of at least two kinds of space: regular\nold-fashioned flat space, and finite unbounded hyperspherical space. By “flat”\nspace I mean nothing more complex than a standard three-dimensional Euclidean\nspace stretching out to infinity in every direction. A two-dimensional flat\nspace is called a plane, and a three dimensional flat space is sometimes\ncalled a _homaloidal_ space.\n\nWhat homaloidal space and hyperspherical space have in common is that they are\ncurved the same amount everywhere. Similarly, we say that planes and spheres\nare _surfaces of constant curvature._ The sphere is certainly not flat, but\neach point on a sphere is like any other point — there are no lumps. One way\nof characterizing surfaces of constant curvature is to say that only on such\nsurfaces is it possible to slide triangles around without having the sides and\nangles change. By the same token, we say that a three-dimensional _space of\nconstant curvature_ is a space in which one can move a rigid body around\nwithout having the relative proportions of the body change.\n\n![img](Images/p102_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 100. Gravitational space bending._\n\nI dozed off and dreamed. But, surprisingly enough, this time I did not see a\npicture of Lineland — the place which I used to visit as a much wiser\nFlatlander, bent on telling its citizens the truth, so obvious to myself since\nI could see the real relations which the people were unable to perceive — no,\nI dreamed something quite different. I was a Sphere from the country of three\ndimensions and I was visiting my own world, my own Flatland. No, not Flatland,\nbut Sphereland, because I could see clearly now that my world was curved in a\ndirection which had never been visible to me before …\n\nI look to the left, to the right, to all sides, and still the world, my world,\ndoes not stretch infinitely in every direction. Of course not, because my\nworld is not infinite. It does not stretch out on all sides into infinity. It\nis a bend, a curved world. I can go around it! I can go and fly all around my\nworld, my spherical Flatland. How utterly fantastic …\n\nBut how about those light rays? How do they travel? Straight ahead? In\nstraight lines? No, of course not. They cannot leave the space, their space.\nThey have to follow the curve of that space because they belong to it. To us,\nSpherelanders, they look like straight lines. We think that light travels in\nstraight lines. And they are not really curved in our space, but follow the\ncurve of our space. They have to. But seen from the outside, they are not\nstraight lines, they are nothing but the shortest connecting lines possible on\nthe surface of a sphere.\n\nDIONYS BURGER,\n\n_Sphereland,_ 1965\n\nThe fact of the matter is that our space is _not_ a space of constant\ncurvature. A square that is transported to a point near a star will be\ndistorted, by gravitational space bending, into the shape of a curved\nrectangle. But many cosmologists like to assume that at least on the large\nscale our space has constant curvature. On the medium scale, Earth’s surface\nhas anything but constant curvature; but on the large scale Earth’s surface is\napproximately a smooth sphere — perhaps our space’s gravity bumps also average\nout in a smooth way.\n\nIf we do assume that our space has an approximately constant curvature on the\nlarge scale, then what are the possibilities? We have mentioned two: flat (or\nhomaloidal) space, and hyperspherical space. There is a third kind of space\nwith constant curvature. This kind of space is usually called _hyperbolic\nspace._ In order to understand what three dimensional hyperbolic space is\nlike, let’s first look into two-dimensional hyperbolic space. A little while\nback we were thinking about a Flatland that is the surface of a sphere. It\nturns out that two-dimensional hyperbolic space is best represented as the\nsurface of a so-called _pseudosphere._ But what is a pseudosphere?\n\nA pseudosphere, like a sphere, can be thought of as a 2-D surface. The sphere\nis smaller than a plane: it bends back on itself and is finite, whereas the\nplane is, of course, infinite. A pseudosphere, strangely enough, is _bigger_\nthan the plane. Both plane and pseudosphere are infinite, yet the pseudosphere\nmanages to have more room. To begin to get the notion of a pseudosphere, you\nmight think about crawling around on an endless taffy plane. Every few feet\nyou stop to grab and stretch the plane’s material. It gets baggy and wrinkled\n… more and more spacious.\n\nPrecisely because the pseudosphere is actually bigger than the plane, it is\nvery hard to represent it in the normal Euclidean space of our drawings. But\nthere is a special trick for shrinking a pseudosphere to fit inside a disk. In\norder to better understand how such a shrinking procedure works, let’s\nconsider how one might shrink the normal _plane_ to fit inside a _square._\n\n![img](Images/p103_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 101. Infinite checkerboard, shrunk to fit in a square._\n\nI’ll present this method as another imaginary first-person account by a man\nwho finds Flatland in a basement. The man is called Felix Ungluck, and, sad to\nsay, he is very clumsy.\n\nEXCERPT FROM FELIX UNGLUCK’S _The Pure hand_\n\nThe door swung closed behind me. For a moment I could see nothing, and I\nworried that I might fall. But then, moving my head back and forth, I caught a\ngleam of light from below. Something was down there.\n\nI found a light switch and clicked it on. Floating near the foot of the stairs\nwas a weightless square, some two meters on a side. It was marked in an\nirregular pattern which grew ever more intricate near the fuzzy edges. At\nfirst I took it for a sort of flying carpet … but then I realized that each\ncolored bit was moving with a life of its own. This was Flatland, its infinite\nexpanse somehow compressed to the size of a two-meter square.\n\nMesmerized, I descended the staircase and leaned over the shrunken world. The\npolygonal little Flatlanders darted this way and that, waxing as they neared\nthe center, shrinking as they approached the edges. It was like a living\nSunday funnies … an _infinite_ living Sunday funnies section with smaller and\nsmaller boxes squeezed in on every side, an infinitely regressing pattern in\nthe space of a two-meter square.\n\nUpstairs there was a sudden loud crash. Unsure of my footing, frightened by\nthe noise, I fell forward. My body passed through Flatland as easily as a\ndiver passes through a lake’s surface.\n\n![img](Images/p104_1.jpg)\n\n_An unreachable hole._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa6)\n\n_Suppose that there is a hole in Flatland, but that no one can fall into it\nbecause the closer they get to it, the more they shrink. Can you draw a\ncurved-space picture of this situation_?\n\n![img](Images/p105_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 102. Felix Ungluck._\n\nThe little creatures darted away from my intruding bulk, scattering like so\nmany water striders. And I — like a curse from infinity — I eclipsed an\nendless acreage and fell heavily to the floor. I seemed to hear the\nFlatlanders’ faint and desperate cries.\n\nLooking down at my body, I realized with horror that I had torn legions of\nthese innocent beings out of their space. They stuck to me, sliding this way\nand that over the rough fabric of my clothes. I could see that they were\nmortally wounded. Slowly the pale plaid shimmer died out. I put my face in my\nhands and began to weep.\n\n![img](Images/p105_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 103. “I put my face in my hands and began to weep.”_\n\nFigure 101 is not a pseudosphere, but it is based on a trick that will enable\nus to draw a pseudosphere soon. Figure 101 depicts a plane. The whole infinite\nplane is squeezed into a finite square. How is this done? By repeatedly\nhalving the distances as one approaches the square’s boundary.\n\nSome readers will have heard of Zeno’s paradoxes. Zeno was an early Greek\nphilosopher who was interested in demonstrating that the simple idea of\n“motion” can lead to a number of logical difficulties. His best-known paradox\nstates that you can never leave the room you are in. For, reasons Zeno, in\norder to reach the door you must first traverse half the distance there. But\nthen you are still in the room, and to reach the door you must traverse half\nthe remaining distance. But then you are still in the room, and to reach the\ndoor you must traverse half the remaining distance. But then …\n\n![img](Images/p106_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 104. Infinitely many steps._\n\nThe paradox here is that the simple two paces that should get you out of the\nroom can be split into an infinite succession of smaller and smaller paces. In\na sense, leaving the room involves completing an infinite task. Of course, we\ndo not normally make each pace half as long as the pace before, and we leave\nrooms with no difficulty.\n\nBut what if you were in a room filled with some strange kind of force field, a\nforce field that made you get half as big each time you took another step\ntoward the door? You would start out two paces from the door, as before. But\nnow after the first pace you shrink to half your size. You are one old pace,\nor two new paces, from the door. Taking another pace, you shrink again by a\nfactor of two and are now two doubly shrunken paces from the door!\n\nIn figures 101 and 105 we show how to use this Zeno-style shrinking to fit an\ninfinite plane inside, respectively, a square and a circle. In figure 101,\neach of the checkerboard’s squares is supposed to be really the same size. Put\ndifferently, we can turn the object in figure 101 back into a plane by\nstretching each of the checkerboard squares back up to unit size. In figure\n105, each of the triangles is supposed to be really the same size. One can\nlook at the triangles as being arranged in concentric rings, with each ring\nhalf the thickness of the one before. Once again, if we could stretch each\ntriangle back to unit size, we’d get a plane.\n\n![img](Images/p107_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 105. Infinite plane inside a circle._\n\n![img](Images/p108_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 106. Pseudospherical tesselation._\n\nNow, what about the pseudosphere? The pseudosphere can be represented as an\ninfinite pattern of warped triangles squeezed inside a circle, as in figure\n106. The Dutch artist Maurits Escher sometimes used patterns like this. What\nmakes the pseudosphere different is that if you stretched each of its\ntriangles to unit size (and straightened out their sides as well), then you’d\nget something that will not fit in a plane without folds and wrinkles. Notice,\nfor instance, that at some of the corners in the pseudospherical pattern we\nhave _eight_ “equilateral triangles” meeting. But if the pattern could be\nstretched out and laid flat on the plane, then one could have at most _six_\nequilateral triangles coming together at a single point.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to smoothly stretch out the whole pseudosphere in\nour space, we can stretch out pieces of it to get various bounded surfaces of\nconstant curvature. If we stretch out the central disk of the pseudosphere\ndiagram, it becomes saddle-shaped. Unlike the sphere, which at each point is\ncurving in the same direction, the saddle surface is at each point curving in\ntwo different directions. By being thus curved up and down at the same time,\nthe saddle surface stretches to be, in a sense, bigger than a flat disk.\n\n![img](Images/p109_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 107. A disk from the pseudosphere stretches into a saddle shape._\n\nA more dramatic example of stretching out a piece of the pseudosphere occurs\nif we take a sector that runs out to the “infinitely distant” edge. In figure\n108, what we do is cut along lines _e, e′,_ and _H-,_ then we stretch _e_ and\n_e′_ out to their “real” infinite length; and then we bend _H_ around into a\ncircle and glue _e_ and _e′_ together to make _E_. In the 1940s the figure on\nthe right was sometimes called the pseudosphere, but this is wrong. It is only\na sewed-together _sector_ of the pseudosphere. What, then, shall we call it?\n“Gabriel’s Horn” seems appropriate, because it is shaped like the bell of a\ntrumpet, and the mouthpiece of the trumpet is infinitely far away. The image I\nhave in mind is of some fearsome Judgment Day rolling around, and an angel in\nan infinitely far away heaven reaching a long thin trumpet all the way down to\nblast me in the ear.\n\n![img](Images/p109_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 108. A sector of the pseudosphere stretches into Gabriel’s Horn_.\n\nSo by thinking about what happens if we stretch pieces of the pseudosphere out\nto proper size, we begin to get an idea of the full surface. Recall now that\nwe started talking about the pseudosphere so as to have an example of a two-\ndimensional hyperbolic space. But what we really wanted to learn about was\n_three-dimensional hyperbolic space_.\n\nWhat is full hyperbolic space like? Imagine an endless three-dimensional space\nthat has somehow been stretched to be more spacious than flat homaloidal\nspace. Mathematically, one can model such a space by taking the inside of a\nsphere and assuming that the objects inside this sphere shrink endlessly as\nthey move away from the center. This is analogous to our trick of fitting flat\nor pseudospherical Flat-lands inside circles.\n\nIt is a very odd notion to think that perhaps our space is really the\nincredibly warped and shrunken interior of, say, a tennis ball. As Hamlet\nsays, “O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of\ninfinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.”\n\nThe idea of representing a curved space by a flat space that is to be\nstretched and shrunk comes from Bernhard Riemann. As an example of the\ngenerality of Riemann’s technique, we have indicated in figure 109 how a\nvariety of curved surfaces can be represented by assigning different lengths\nto the circumference of a fixed unit-radius circle.\n\n[PUZZLE 7.7](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa7)\n\n_The Gabriel’s Horn surface shown infigure 108 has a very strange property:\nalthough its length is infinite, its surface area is finite. Can you think of\nany way to cut a unit square into infinitely many pieces and arrange these\npieces so as to make up an infinitely long surface with an area of one_?\n\n![img](Images/p111_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 109. Making the distances right_.\n\nOne can make the circumference smaller by bending the surface toward itself,\nor one can make the circumference larger by bending the surface in two\ndifferent directions.\n\nIf you make a fist you will notice some roughly hemispherical bumps where your\nknuckles are. Pause for a moment and think of the freckles of your skin as\nbeing 2-D galaxies in a “Flatland” whose space is the surface of your skin. A\ngalaxy located near your knuckle bumps might have inhabitants who believe that\nspace is spherical. A galaxy in the “saddle” between two knuckle bumps might\nhave citizens  who feel that space is stretched into a pseudospherical\npattern. And the little folks living in the flat expanses of your forearm\nmight take space to be a plane.\n\n![img](Images/p112_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 110. Your skin is an irregularly curved 2-D space_.\n\nIn this chapter we have looked at three kinds of 3-D space: flat space,\nhyperspherical space, and hyperbolic space. What these three kinds of space\nhave in common is that each of them is, on the large scale, uniformly curved.\nNo one region of space is essentially different from any other. But we should\nkeep in mind that the simplifying assumption that our space is of constant\ncurvature might very well be false. The shape of space may be stranger than we\nthought.\n\n![img](Images/p112_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 111. The shape of space may he stranger than we thought_.\n\n\n## 8\n\n##  Magic Doors  \nto Other Worlds\n\nJUST SOUTH OF BALTIMORE there’s a highway exit labeled “Brooklyn.” Wouldn’t it\nbe great if the exit led right into New York? Even better, wouldn’t it be nice\nto have a special kind of superdoor leading, say, from your living room to the\nTuileries gardens in Paris? Or, most exciting of all, how about a hyperdoor\nleading out of your space and into a totally different universe?\n\nPeople have always enjoyed thinking about such magical doors. The perfect\nsymbol of the mind’s freedom from the body’s spatial limitations, magic doors\noccur throughout fantastic literature, from Lewis Carroll to C. S. Lewis to\nRobert Heinlein. As a rule, writers of fiction have been very vague about how\nmagic doors might actually be constructed; at best one hears them explained as\n“tunnels through hyperspace.” But as it turns out, modern cosmologists have\ndeveloped some good ways of thinking about magic doors (also known as\nEinstein-Rosen bridges or Schwarzschild wormholes).\n\nTo get the picture, we turn as usual to A Square. Suppose that Flatland is a\nplane, and parallel to it is another plane called Globland. Ordinarily, there\nis no way that an inhabitant of one of these two-dimensional universes can get\nto the other universe. But suppose that somehow a flap of space from each\nworld has been snipped out, and say that the two flaps are sewn together. Now\nthe Globbers can visit Flatland, and the Flatlanders can visit Globland. I\nquote once again from that imaginary classic, _The Further Adventures of A\nSquare:_\n\n![img](Images/p114_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 112. A space strip connecting Flatland and Globland_.\n\nThe Other-Door which A Cube constructed was most singular. I recognize that to\na Spacelander the entire Connection appears to be nothing more than a strip of\nspace stretching from our Land to Globland. But to us the appearance was of\nthe Other-Door as a frameless, unlinteled door giving onto wholly new\nprospects. This, from the front. From the back, the Other-Door was black\nNothingness, a hole in Space. The entire area behind the Other-Door could be\napproached only at great risk. For here there was no Space at all; from here\nwas taken the Space necessary to build the Way to Globland.\n\n![img](Images/p114_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 113. The Other-Door_.\n\nI myself made the journey several times. The Globbers, though Irregular to the\nlast degree, are a pleasant folk, bucolic and accommodating. Several of them\nventured into our plane land, although for them the trip was not so easy.\nIndeed, more than one of them met an untimely end while traveling the Way from\nSpace to Space. Due to a certain awkwardness and grossness of Size, the\nGlobbers found it difficult to avoid brushing against the absolute Nothingness\nwhich bounded the Way. And from Nothingness there is no return.\n\nThe problem with the world-to-world hookup illustrated in figure 112 is the\npresence of lethal space edges. But there is a much better way to connect two\nplanes.\n\nAfter a day’s thought, A Cube reappeared in my study. Three highly placed\nWomen were visiting me, and the sudden materialization of the Cube’s cross\nsection sent them into an ecstasy of fear. In their eyes I was a magician, the\nCube my familiar spirit. I was eager to dazzle these lovely Segments;\naccordingly I played the wizard’s part.\n\n![img](Images/p115_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 114. A Square showing off for the ladies_.\n\n“Oh, Kitty, how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-\nglass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend\nthere’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the\nglass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s\nturning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get\nthrough —” She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she\nhardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass _was_ beginning to\nmelt away, just like a bright silvery mist.\n\nIn another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down\ninto the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether\nthere was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that\nthere was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind.\n“So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,” thought Alice: “warmer,\nin fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh,\nwhat fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here and can’t get at\nme!”\n\nLEWIS CARROLL,\n\n_Through the Looking-Glass,_ 1872\n\nI: How now, thou humble Hexahedron?\n\nCUBE: I’ve thought of a way to fix it.

Whereas earlier the\nOther-Door had appeared as a window to Globland from the front, and as a\nregion of Nothingness from behind, it was now the same from every prospect: a\nlenslike window which seemingly compressed the whole of Globland to the\nconfines of a Disk. My friend the Cube had in some fashion contrived to join\ntogether the edges of space where heretofore Nothingness had menaced the\nworld-to-world traveler.\n\nNo one had yet ventured through the altered Other-Door. Desirous of assuring\nmy conquest of Una, I courageously pressed forward to the mysterious Disk. It\ngave the strange appearance of a circular Mirror, such as ornament our Trees\nat festival time. Peering into it I could make out smaller and smaller\nGlobbers, ever-dwindling toward the inconceivably distant central Point. I\nfeared to enter, feared that I might be crushed by Shrinkage. But Una was\nvibrating at my side, urging me on with her low, melodious voice. “Come, Una,”\nI said, and slid forward into the weird Disk which somehow contained all of\nGlobland.\n\n![img](Images/p116_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 115. A Square and Una at the space tunnel’s mouth_.\n\nLooking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up — mostly long fur\ncoats. There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She\nimmediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed\nher face against them …\n\n“This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!” thought Lucy, going still further\nin and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then\nshe noticed that there was something crunching under her feet. “I wonder is\nthat more moth-balls?” she thought, stooping down to feel it with her hands.\nBut instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she\nfelt something soft and powdery and extremely cold. “This is very queer,” she\nsaid, and went on a step or two further.\n\nNext moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no\nlonger soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. “Why, it is\njust like branches of trees!” exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was\na light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe\nought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on\nher. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at\nnighttime with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.\n\nC. S. LEWIS,\n\n_The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ , 1960\n\nThe Globbers had appeared quite shrunken and distorted before we entered the\nDoor. But now, as we pressed forward, they took on their familiar, albeit\nIrregular, appearance. Could it be that we had shrunken to their size? All\naround us lay the endless expanse of Globland. Was this really the interior of\nsome magical Disk? My thoughts were interrupted by Una’s excited cries.\n\nUNA: Oh, look, dear Square, Flatland is now a Disk itself!\n\nI (_turning to look back_): Indeed. Perfect Symmetry prevails. As seen through\nthe Space Tunnel, Flatland is a Disk in Globland, and Globland is a Disk in\nFlatland. All this have I wrought for your pleasure, my Lady.\n\nUNA: It is well, my Lord. My Husband cannot disturb us here in this enchanted\nLand.\n\nI: Then let us dally, fairest Una.\n\nUNA: Freely, my Lord … yet look into the Disk of Flatland. There slides my\nMate, A Hexagon!\n\nI: He is small and puny. He is an ant.\n\nUNA: But, oh, dear Square, he waxes as he nears the Disk’s edge!\n\nI (_to a nearby Globber_): How now, sirrah, wilst grant me a boon?\n\nGLOBBER: Blub, yubba, gloop.\n\nI (_seizing him with my Mouth_): Just stretch yourself (mmpf) like this\n(mmpfmmp) and this, dear friend. And in such wise do curtain our Seraglio.\n\nThe deed was done, and Una and I were free to take our pleasure. My perfect\ncontent was marred only by one question: How was it that passing through the\nSpace Tunnel turned Inside to Outside, and Outside to In?\n\n![img](Images/p117_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 116. A Globber blocks A Hexagon’s view of Una’s trans-dimensional\ntryst_.\n\nLooking at the space tunnel from outside the planes of Flatland and Globland,\nwe can see the answer to A Square’s question. The throat of the “wormhole,” or\nspace tunnel, is bounded by a circle in either world. A Flatlander looking at\nthis circle sees light from every part of Globland … Thus it seems to him that\nGlobland is somehow compressed to fit inside a circle. By the same token, a\nGloblander will see light from all over Flatland as coming from the circular\nthroat of the wormhole.\n\n![img](Images/p117_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 117. A Hexagon thinks Globland is a disk_.\n\n![img](Images/p118_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 118. Hyperspace tunnel to another universe_.\n\nJoe noticed something shiny lying on the next mound over. A bright little\nsphere, like a big ball-bearing or a silvered glass Christmas-tree ball. An\nodd thing to find in an asparagus field.\n\nHe hopped over the intervening mound and leaned over the little mirror-ball.\nThe sky was in there, and his face and the horizon and the field. Neat. But …\n\nWait. It wasn’t the _same_. The field in the little reflected image was pink\nand crowded with towering … machinery, tapering in towards the image’s center.\nWorse, the funhouse face looking back at Joe was not his after all … was not\nany living human’s …\n\nThe mouth was moving. Calling others. More faces crowded up. Two, three, five\n… small and distorted in the mirror’s curve.\n\nJoe gasped and stepped back, then stepped forward and gave the ball a poke. It\nrolled off the mound. Nothing in the image changed. The central figure was\nholding up a three-fingered hand and making signs. The vaguely female mouth-\nslash moved soundlessly. Over the figure’s head Joe could make out a tiny\nrocket-plane moving across the curved sky, moving away and away, dwindling\ntowards the infinitely distant central point. It was a whole universe in\nthere.\n\nRUDY RUCKER,\n\n“The Last Einstein-Rosen Bridge,” 1983\n\nNow, as we have done so many times before, let’s imagine raising everything by\none dimension. Imagine that there is another 3-D universe, “parallel” to ours\nin 4-D space. If we could move _ana_ through hyperspace we could get to the\nother universe. But we find it very hard to move in the fourth dimension. How,\nthen, could we ever get to the other universe? By traveling through a\nhyperspace tunnel, a so-called Einstein-Rosen bridge. What would such a\nhyperspace tunnel look like? The entrance to it would look like a sphere that\ncontained a whole other universe, incredibly shrunken and distorted. If you\ndived headfirst into this sphere, you would feel as if you passed right\nthrough it. But then when you looked around you would realize that you were in\nthe other universe now, and looking back at the hyperspace tunnel, you would\nsee a sphere that seemed to contain your whole original universe, incredibly\nshrunken and distorted.\n\nThere is actually a very familiar object that looks just like the mouth of an\nEinstein-Rosen bridge: a glass Christmas tree ornament. Such a spherical\nmirror reflects, in principle, the entire universe around it. The farther an\nobject is from the mirror’s surface, the closer its image seems to lie to the\nmirror’s center. Of course, if you were looking at the mouth of a hyperspace\ntunnel to _another_ universe, you would not see the mirror image of our\nuniverse, you would see what looks like the mirror image of another universe.\n\n![img](Images/p119_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 119. A collapsing star could form an Einstein-Rosen bridge_.\n\nIs there any way — short of the miraculous intervention of a higher-\ndimensional being — that an Einstein-Rosen bridge could actually come into\nexistence in our cosmos? Yes. If there are indeed some other 3-D universes\nparallel to ours, it might be that a sufficiently dense object could bulge our\nspace out enough to touch another space. And the two spaces might join\ntogether like two soap films that have been brought into contact.\n\nIn order to easily illustrate this, let’s just work with a cross section of\ntwo parallel Flatlands. As has been discussed, the presence of matter causes\nspace to bulge out. Now, just as a woman’s high heel will dent a rubber mat\nmore than a man’s larger heel, it turns out that _the denser the matter, the\ngreater the space distortion_. If our sun could be compressed to a much\nsmaller size, then it would distort space much more.\n\nThe sun is basically a ball of hot gas. The gravitational attraction of the\nsun’s particles for one another works to try to make the sun smaller. The\nthermal agitation of the hot gas particles works to try to make the sun\nbigger. The two forces balance out with the sun just the size it is.\nEventually, however, the sun will grow cooler. As it cools there will be less\noutward pressure, and gravity can work to make the sun get smaller and denser.\nThis compression heats the sun back up for a while, but eventually it cools\nagain, and contracts even more.\n\nAll stars go through this stepwise contraction process as they age. Depending\non the star’s starting mass, various final outcomes are possible. If at some\npoint a star contracts too rapidly, it explodes and makes a nova or a\nsupernova. If the star is not too massive to start with, it may contract down\nto form a solid, glowing lump of metal. If it is a bit more massive, it\nsqueezes down further by collapsing the metal atoms. Protons combine with\nelectrons to give neutrons, and one gets a fantastically dense “neutron star.”\nThese stars are made up of a substance called neutronium, which masses about\none billion kilograms per cubic centimeter.\n\nThe contraction is most dramatic if the star’s mass is so great that even the\nneutronium ends up getting crushed. In such cases the star shrinks down to a\ntinier and tinier volume … possibly even down to point size! Such super-dense\ncollapsed stars are the “black holes” that one so often hears about. The\nreason for the name is that if a star is dense enough, then its gravitational\nattraction becomes so powerful that light cannot escape the star. In other\nwords, a star that becomes dense enough takes on the appearance of a black,\nlightless sphere in space — a region that emits no light at all. Obviously it\nis difficult to “see” a black hole, but a variety of indirect observations\nseem to indicate that there really are quite a few black holes floating around\nin space.\n\n![img](Images/p120_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 120. A black hole absorbs light_.\n\nOf all the conceptions of the human mind from unicorns to gargoyles to the\nhydrogen bomb perhaps the most fantastic is the black hole: a hole in space\nwith a definite edge over which anything can fall and nothing can escape; a\nhole with a gravitational field so strong that even light is caught and held\nin its grip; a hole that curves space and warps time. Like the unicorn and the\ngargoyle, the black hole seems much more at home in science-fiction or in\nancient myth than in the real universe. Nevertheless, the laws of modern\nphysics virtually demand that black holes exist. In our galaxy alone there may\nbe millions of them.\n\nThe search for black holes has become a major astronomical enterprise over the\npast decade. It has yielded dozens of candidates scattered over the sky. At\nfirst the task of proving conclusively that any of them is truly a black hole\nseemed virtually impossible. In the past two years, however, an impressive\namount of circumstantial evidence in the constellation Cygnus designated\nCygnus X-l. The evidence makes me and most other astronomers who have studied\nit about 90 percent certain that in the center of Cygnus X-l there is indeed a\nblack hole.\n\nKIP S. THORNE,\n\n“The Search for Black Holes,” 1974\n\nAs indicated in figure 119, if a massive star or black hole distorts space\nenough, it is possible that an Einstein-Rosen bridge to another universe could\nbe created. Flying into the right kind of black hole might pop you out into a\ndifferent world. The theme of black-hole-as-gateway-to-other-realities is\namusingly used in the Walt Disney movie _The Black Hole_. At the end of the\nmovie, the good guys and the bad guys all fall into a huge black hole. The\nhole turns out to be an Einstein-Rosen bridge with two exits: heaven and hell!\nThis type of idea harks right back to the hyperspace theologians of Abbott’s\ntime.\n\nIt is also possible to have a wormhole, or E-R bridge, which leads back to the\nsame space it starts from. This could be very important. Here’s why.\n\n![img](Images/p121_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 121. The wormhole is a short cut from_ A _to_ B.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special theory of relativity, nothing can travel\nfaster than light. This has always been a severe limitation for conscientious\nscience fiction writers. It takes light four years to get to Alpha Centauri,\nour sun’s closest neighbor … And any conversation or cultural exchange that is\nriddled with four-year gaps is going to be pretty dull to read about. If\nyou’re interested in traveling to another galaxy, the situation is much worse:\nour nearest galactic neighbor, the Great Magellanic Cloud, is well over ten\nthousand light-years away!\n\nSF writers have often avoided this problem by supposing that (1) our space is\nfolded back on itself, and (2) there are E-R bridges or wormholes connecting\nthe various folds. By finding the right hyperspace tunnel, a very long journey\ncan be cut down to manageable size. One of the first writers to use this\ndevice was Robert Heinlein, the father of modern SF. The analogy is to an ant\non a silk scarf. Normally it takes the ant a long time to crawl from one\ncorner to the other, but if the scarf is all crumpled, then by leaving the\nmaterial’s surface the ant can find a short and direct path through 3-D space.\n\n![img](Images/p121_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 122. A hyperspace hop_.\n\nOf course, being able to take a desired short cut depends on there being a\nusable E-R bridge at the right location. Some SF writers avoid this problem by\nhaving their space travelers _create_ E-R bridges as necessary. In Piers\nAnthony’s mind-boggling _Macroscope_ , the method of travel is to get inside a\nlarge object (say the planet Neptune), use some miraculous ray to make the\nobject collapse to black-hole size, and then zip through the black hole to\ncome out somewhere different!\n\nIf we could really manipulate the curvature of space at will, then there would\nbe an interesting alternate way of traveling through hyperspace. Instead of\nbuilding a tunnel or wormhole leading to another space, one could pinch a\nsmall hypersphere off our space and just float away. This could be risky, of\ncourse, as you’d have no way of predicting where and when your little space\nbubble might meet another universe. But one nice thing about leaving space by\npinching off a closed piece of it is that this doesn’t leave a hole behind.\n\n![img](Images/p122_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 123. A piece of space pinching off_.\n\nSo far in this chapter we have discussed how one might travel through\nhyperspace to other universes, and we have mentioned how this type of travel\nmight also be useful for finding short cuts from one region of our space to\nanother. One question we have not touched on yet is whether or not there\nreally _are_ any other universes.\n\nAs was hinted at in the last chapter, it is abstractly possible to treat the\ngravitational distortion of space as a type of stretching and shrinking of\nflat space — as opposed to the bulging out of flat space into some higher\ndimensions. Many scientists feel that “curved space” is just a colorful\nphrase, and that there really is nothing outside our three space dimensions.\nFor these somewhat cautious thinkers, the visible universe is all that exists,\nand any talk about alternate universes is just empty dreaming.\n\n![img](Images/p122_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 124. A Square traveling on a space sphere_.\n\nBut if we take the fourth dimension quite seriously, then it seems natural to\nsuppose that there might be other universes. All these universes taken\ntogether make up a much grander entity, variously known as the cosmos or as\nsuper-space. In traditional Christian doctrine, the cosmos has three parallel\nlayers: heaven, our world, and hell. The theosophists hold that the cosmos has\nseven layers, six of these being “astral.” A common notion in science fiction\nis that there are endlessly many parallel universes — with each possible\nuniverse existing somewhere. A variation of this last idea has actually been\nincorporated into modern quantum mechanics, and we will return to it in later\nchapters.\n\n![img](Images/p123_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 125. Parallel worlds_.\n\nProbably the least interesting viewpoint on the question of how many universes\nthere are is that which says: “The whole question is meaningless. No one has\nany idea how to detect another universe. Since statements about other\nuniverses cannot be subjected to immediate scientific testing, these\nstatements don’t really say anything at all.”\n\nSuch a viewpoint combines two assumptions: (1) _Seeing is believing_ , that\nis, if something is real we can find a way to observe it; and (2) _There’s\nnothing new under the sun_ , that is, we’ve already observed every type of\nthing we ever will observe. The first assumption is central to the\nphilosophical school of logical positivism, a modern outgrowth of traditional\nBritish empiricism. For the positivist or empiricist, the world is basically\nequivalent to the sum total of all possible sensory experience. I have no\nproblem with this — indeed, I will advocate a similar position in [part\nIII](18_Part3.html). It is the second assumption I object to. No one has _yet_\nfound a way to observe the other universes, granted. But this does not\nautomatically prove that no one will _ever_ find a way to “see” the other\nworlds.\n\nPeople speculated about atoms centuries before there was any hope of detecting\nan individual atom. And if no one had ever talked about atoms, the means to\ndetect them might never have been developed. Talking about other universes\nwould be a more respectable pastime if we could already see them. But unless\nwe go ahead and try to imagine ways in which this might happen, the day will\nnever come. We have already seen that something like Einstein-Rosen bridges\nmay exist as actual pathways to other universes. What I want to do now is to\nthink of some other ways in which these universes might make themselves known.\n\nJust so as not to be lost in a sea of possibilities, let’s limit ourselves to\none fairly reasonable model for the cosmos: four-dimensional hyperspace with a\nnumber of hyper-spheres floating in it. Each of the hyperspheres makes up a\nsingle universe. We might think of these hyperspheres as being something like\nbubbles in a fluid; alternatively, we might think of them as being like\nplanets floating in space. In terms of two-dimensional beings, we are thinking\nof a bunch of Spherelands.\n\n![img](Images/p124_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 126. Hyperspherical universes floating in hyperspace_.\n\n[PUZZLE 8.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch8pa1)\n\n_What would happen if the Globber infigure 116 were to choke the throat of the\nspace tunnel down to point size_?\n\n![img](Images/p125_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 127. Two spaces merging_.\n\nIf we are limited to the 3-D hypersurface of our hypersphere, is there any way\nin which we can become aware of the other hyperspheres? One very dramatic way\nin which this could happen would be if one of the other universes happened to\nbump into ours. Imagine what a Spherelander would see if his space bubble were\nsuddenly to bump into and join up with another space bubble. The effect would\nbe, in our terms, as if all the visible stars were to move out toward the\nhorizon, leaving room for a whole lot of new stars at the zenith! Of course,\nif the other space was considerably smaller than ours, the effect would be\nless dramatic. If a small hypersphere merges with ours we might perceive this\njoining-up process as the occurrence of an unusually bright spot in the sky.\nConceivably, the very distant and very bright light sources known as quasars\n(for “quasi-stellar objects”) are spots where small energy-filled hyperspheres\nare in the process of joining up with our own hypersphere.\n\n![img](Images/p125_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 128. Quasars_?\n\nBut are there any less large-scale and less obvious effects that might point\nto the existence of other hyperspherical spaces? In thinking about this\nquestion, it is helpful to imagine the situation of a man blind from birth.\nSuppose that he takes it into his head that the sun, the moon, the other\nplanets, the stars, and so on do not exist. Suppose he insists that space is a\nvast emptiness containing but one object: the spherical planet Earth. How\nmight you convince him he is wrong?\n\n[PUZZLE 8.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch8pa2)\n\n_An Einstein-Rosen bridge would look something like a spherical mirror, with\nthe odd property that the world in the mirror was actually different from the\nworld outside the mirror. Now imagine an ordinary flat mirror with the\nproperty that the world seen in the mirror is not the same as our world on our\nside of the mirror. What kind of connection between two spaces is being\ndescribed here_?\n\n![img](Images/p126_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 129. Blind and stubborn_.\n\nOffhand I can think of three approaches: (1) You might teach him to be\nsensitive enough to heat radiation so as to “feel” the sun’s passage across\nthe sky. Or you might couple a telescope to a photocell that controls the\nvolume of a little buzzer. Moving this telescope around, the man would learn\nto perceive the stars as “loud” spots. (2) You could get him to notice the\nrise and fall of the tides, and explain to him that this is caused by the\ngravitational pull of the moon. (3) You could get him to notice the various\neffects of the Earth’s rotation: the equatorial bulge, the so-called Coriolis\nforce, and the existence of poles. And then you could argue that if the Earth\nis really rotating, it must rotate relative to some other celestial objects.\n\nLet’s consider the higher-dimensional analogues of these three sorts of ways\nto notice other worlds.\n\n1\\. Unless another hypersphere actually touches ours, there is no way for\nlight to leave its space and come to ours. So we cannot hope to see it. So far\nas we know, any other kind of radiation would also be confined to the 3-D\nspace where it originates. So it does not seem very likely that any kind of\ntraining or equipment can help us “see” the other hyperspheres. Our position\nis, after all, really like that of a polygon on a Sphereland … not like that\nof a blind man on Earth. And there seems to be no reason that any one Sphere-\nland would send radiation to other Spherelands. A second difficulty here is\nthat even if some higher-dimensional radiation from other spaces did fall on\nour space, the radiation would not be focused at any particular spot. At best,\nthose regions of space that lie nearer to the other hyperspheres would be\nobserved to have more radiation in them.\n\n2\\. Gravity is not so much a type of radiation as a condition of space. It is\nconceivable that there could be a higher-dimensional analogue of gravitation,\naccording to which various four-dimensional objects would distort the\nhyperspace they float in. Just as the moon’s motion around the Earth causes a\nbulge to travel around the Earth’s surface, we can suppose that a nearby\nhypersphere might distort the shape of our own hypersphere. But present-day\nscientific apparatus is not even sensitive enough to measure our hypersphere’s\nradius — let alone “tidal” variations of the same radius.\n\n3\\. This approach is probably the most important one. Given that nonrotating\nspheres are virtually unheard of in our universe, it seems rather likely that\nthe hypersphere that makes up our space is itself rotating. And, as I will now\nargue, if our space is rotating, then it is almost certain that there are\nspaces outside our own. This last move will not seem immediately obvious: it\nis based on a fairly unfamiliar notion called Mach’s principle. Ernst Mach\n(1838-1916) formulated this principle to account for objects’ _inertia_ ,\ntheir tendency to resist being moved. The point Mach makes is that if an\nobject were totally alone in empty space, then it would be meaningless to say\nthe object is rotating or being accelerated. An object alone in empty space\nwould, in effect, have no inertia, no heft, no resistance to being moved.\nTherefore, argues Mach, the fact that an object on Earth has heft is a\nconsequence of the existence of all the distant stars and galaxies. By the\nsame token, the fact that we notice the Earth’s rotation is also the result of\nthe existence of the distant stars. Generalizing Mach’s principle to\nhyperspace, we conclude that if we can find evidence that our hyper-spherical\nuniverse is rotating, then we have good reason to believe that there are other\nuniverses, _relative to which_ we are rotating. O.K. Now the question is this:\nWhat kind of evidence for the rotation of our universe might we hope to find?\n\n![img](Images/p127_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 130. Spinning globe with hurricanes_.\n\nWell… How can the blind man tell that Earth is rotating? A major effect of the\nEarth’s rotation is that the Earth, instead of being a perfect sphere, bulges\nat the equator and is flattened at the poles. But, as was already mentioned,\nwe can’t even measure our universe’s curvature yet — let alone the deviation\nof this curvature from perfect hypersphericity. Another very important effect\nof the Earth’s rotation is the existence of the Coriolis force. It is the\nCoriolis force that causes hurricanes to rotate clockwise in the Northern\nHemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n![img](Images/p128_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 131. The Coriolis force in everyday life_.\n\n“I don’t know exactly how to tell you; it takes equations. Say! Could you lend\nme that scarf you’re wearing for a minute?”\n\n“Huh? Why, sure.” She removed it from her neck.\n\nIt was a photoprint showing a stylized picture of the solar system, a souvenir\nof Solar Union Day. In the middle of the square of cloth was the conventional\nsunburst surrounded by circles representing orbits of solar planets, with a\nfew comets thrown in. The scale was badly distorted and it was useless as a\nstructural picture of the home system, but it sufficed. Max took it and said,\n“Here’s Mars.”\n\nEldreth said, “You read it. That’s cheating.”\n\n“Hush a moment. Here’s Jupiter. To go from Mars to Jupiter you have to go from\nhere to here, don’t you?”\n\n“Obviously.”\n\n“But suppose I fold it so that Mars is on top of Jupiter? What’s to prevent\njust stepping across?”\n\n“Nothing, I guess. Except that what works for that scarf wouldn’t work very\nwell in practice. Would it?”\n\n“No, not that near to a star. But it works fine after you back away from a\nstar quite a distance. You see, that’s just what an anomaly is, a place where\nspace is folded back on itself, turning a long distance into no distance at\nall … The math of it is simple, but it’s hard to talk about because you can’t\nsee it. Space — _our_ space — may be crumpled up small enough to stuff into a\ncoffee cup, all hundreds of thousands of light-years of it. A four-dimensional\ncoffee cup, of course.”\n\nROBERT A. HEINLEIN,\n\n_Starman Jones_ , 1953\n\n[PUZZLE 8.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch8pa3)\n\n_In the last chapter, I said there were_ three _ways to fit Flatland into a\nbasement, but I only described two ways: bend Flatland into a sphere, or\ninfinitely shrink it to fit in a square. What is the third way_?\n\nHow does the Coriolis force work? To see it in operation, go to a playground\nthat has one of those hand-pushed merry-go-rounds. Get on, crank it up, face\nthe center, and let your right leg swing back and forth. What you will notice\nis that when your leg moves toward the center, some mysterious force pushes it\nto the right, and when your leg moves away from the center, a force pushes it\nto the left. This is a Coriolis force, resulting from the merry-go-round’s\nrotation relative to the rest of the universe. If the merry-go-round were the\nonly object in the universe it would be meaningless to say it is rotating and\nyou would, in fact, feel no Coriolis force. Returning to the swinging leg for\njust a moment, note that the net result of the Coriolis force is to turn a\nsimple swinging motion into a clockwise circling motion. It is the same force,\non a larger scale, that causes air masses to spiral in a clockwise fashion in\nEarth’s Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe fact that hurricanes tend to turn different ways in different parts of the\nworld is a definite asymmetry. If we could find some pervasive asymmetry in\nthe behavior of matter throughout space, we might suspect that this asymmetry\nresults from some overall property of the universe. I have no very specific\nsuggestions as to what kinds of asymmetries we should look for, but one\ngeneral principle is that we should expect to find the crucial asymmetry in\nthe domain of very small particles. Why? My feeling is that if our space has a\nslight thickness in the fourth dimension, then very small particles may enjoy\na certain four-dimensional freedom of motion, and thus be more susceptible to\ninfluences from hyperspace. The situation is complicated by the fact that the\nrotation of a hypersphere in hyperspace is more complex than a sphere’s\nrotation in space.\n\nBut enough of these subtleties. Whether there really are other universes is\nnot nearly so important as the realization that we are integral parts of this\none. The fabric of space joins us all together; we are all ripples on the\nbosom of the aether sea. Space is not some dead abstraction, but rather a\nliving and moving thing. We are patterns in space, and, strangely enough, it\nis not beyond our abilities to speculate on the overall shape of space itself.\n\n\n## Part III\n\n## HOW TO  \nGET THERE\n\n\n##  9\n\n## Spacetime Diary\n\n_Monday, November 15, 1982_\n\nIF IT WASN’T for time, I could live forever. Does that make sense? If it\nwasn’t for space, I could be everywhere. Is there a difference? I want to go\nback to my happy college days. I want to be a newlywed again. I want to be\nthree feet tall and sit on my mother’s lap. I don’t want to die. I want to see\nthe future. Time won’t let me. Let’s kill time. Let’s get past time. Let’s\nreach through time and grab hold of eternity. Now there’s no time. There’s no\ntime now.\n\n![img](Images/p133_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 132. Let’s kill time_.\n\nLater. Do you hate time? Alarm clocks, sure. Changing the clocks for daylight-\nsaving time is the worst. How can they just take an hour away like that?\nRemember in 1973 when Nixon took away _two_ hours for the oil companies?\n\n“The older I get, the faster time goes” my mother told me. “The years just fly\nby. Every time I turn around, it’s Christmas or Thanksgiving.” Party time\nspeeds up and slows down like an out-of-control movie. Ten minutes lasts for\ntwo hours, but the next time you look at your watch, it’s three in the\nmorning. Airport time. Sex time. Street time. Fast or slow, it all passes.\n\n![img](Images/p134_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 133. Fast and slow_.\n\nThat was my big realization twenty years ago. It all passes. Here I am at the\nbathroom door, and how can I ever get to the sink? How can high school ever\nend, how can I ever finish college, how can I ever be married? But then I’m at\nthe sink, I’m back out the door, I have a Ph.D., I’m married with three kids,\nand twenty years have passed. Here I am alive, and how can I ever die? But I\nwill, I know I will, I know it in my soul.\n\nDeath. It’s like the basic puzzle issued to each of us at birth. _Hi, you’re\nalive now, isn’t it nice? Someday you’ll die and it’ll be over. What are you\ngoing to do about it_? It’s awful, it’s terrifying, it’s enough to make a\nperson commit suicide!\n\n![img](Images/p135_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 134. It all passes_.\n\n_Philosophia perennis_ — the phrase was coined by Leibniz; but the thing — the\nmetaphysic that recognizes a divine Reality substantial to the world of things\nand lives and minds, the psychology that finds in the soul something similar\nto, or even identical with, divine Reality, the ethic that places man’s final\nend in the knowledge of the imminent and transcendent Ground of all being —\nthe thing is immemorial and universal.\n\nALDOUS HUXLEY,\n\n_The Perennial Philosophy_ , 1944\n\nIf time didn’t pass, I’d always be here now, writing this chapter. I’m scared\nof dying. I’d like to think that time doesn’t really pass. What I’m going to\ndo in this chapter is to present some scientific justifications for the belief\nthat the passage of time is an illusion.\n\nPeople ordinarily think of the world as being a three-dimensional space that\nchanges with the passage of time. The past is gone, the future doesn’t exist\nyet, and only the present is real. But there is another way of looking at the\nworld: we can regard the world as a _block universe_. When we think of the\nworld as a block universe, we put all of space and time together to make a\nsingle huge object. The block universe is made up of _spacetime_. Spacetime is\nfour-dimensional: three space dimensions plus one time dimension. To look at\nspacetime from the outside is to stand outside of history and view things _sub\nspecie aeternitatis_.\n\n“Spacetime” may sound like something technical and far removed from ordinary\nlife. But I would argue that it is really a more natural concept than “space\nthat changes with time.”\n\nSuppose you work in an office miles away from your house. At 7:00 you see your\nbedroom; at 10:00 you see your desk. One day at 10:00 you sit in your office\nand wonder what is real. If you believe the world consists of a space that\nchanges with time, then you are more or less committed to the view that the\npast is gone. So you will feel that your 10:00 bedroom exists, but your 7:00\nbedroom does not exist. Yet your 10:00 bedroom is not something you can _see_\n, sitting there in your office. Wouldn’t it be more reasonable to believe that\nthe 7:00 bedroom (which you _saw_ and can well remember) is real, and that it\nis the 10:00 bedroom whose existence is doubtful?\n\n![img](Images/p136_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 135. What’s real!_\n\nMy world is, in the last analysis, the sum total of my sensations. These\nsensations can be most naturally arranged as a pattern in four-dimensional\nspacetime. My life is a sort of four-dimensional worm embedded in a block\nuniverse. To complain that my lifeworm is only (let us say) seventy-two years\nlong is perhaps as foolish as it would be to complain that my body is only six\nfeet long. Eternity is right outside of spacetime. Eternity is right now.\n\nThis is not a new idea by any means. The teaching that all history is an\neternal Now is central to the classic mystic tradition. In one of his sermons,\nthe fourteenth-century priest Meister Eckhart expressed the basic idea as\nvividly as anyone before or since:\n\nA day, whether six or seven ago, or more than six thousand years ago, is just\nas near to the present as yesterday. Why? Because all time is contained in the\npresent Now-moment.\n\nTo talk about the world as being made by God tomorrow, or yesterday, would be\ntalking nonsense. God makes the world and all things in this present now. Time\ngone a thousand years ago is now as present and as near to God as this very\ninstant.\n\nWhether or not we share Eckhart’s beliefs about God, the image of spacetime\nbeing created all at once is a powerful one. Whenever I read his words I get\nan image of a big old man with a white beard flinging a bucket of paint at a\nbarn wall. _Splat_ : there’s all of spacetime, created all at once, created\nright now.\n\n![img](Images/p137_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 136. “God makes the world and all the things in this present now.”_\n\n_Tuesday, November 16, 1982_\n\nSpace is made up of _locations_ ; spacetime is made up of _events_. An “event”\nis just what it sounds like: a given place at a given time. Each of your sense\nimpressions is a little event. The events you experience fall into a natural\nfour-dimensional order: north/south, east/west, up/down, sooner/later. When\nyou look back at your life, you are really looking at a four-dimensional\nspacetime pattern. So there is nothing very strange or confusing about\nspacetime, as long as we are looking at it from the “inside.”\n\nLooking at spacetime from the “outside” is a little harder: four-dimensional\nthings are always difficult to visualize. Let us, once again, think about\nFlatland. Imagine that A Square is resting alone in an empty field, and that\nshortly after noon his father, A Triangle, slides up to him and then slides\noff. If we take time to be a third dimension perpendicular to the plane of\nFlatland, then we can illustrate these events by a spacetime diagram as shown\nin figure 137. Here A Square and A Triangle are wormlike patterns in\nspacetime. Their brief encounter at 12:05 is represented as a bending together\nof their lifeworms. Nothing really moves here; this is just an eternal pattern\nin spacetime. At 12:05 A Triangle is next to A Square; this is an eternal\nfact, a fact that can never change.\n\nTry to imagine a picture like figure 137 that encompasses the entire space and\ntime of Flatland. This vast tangle of worms and threads would make up what we\ncall the _Flat-land block universe_. You could think of making a model of the\nFlatland block universe by standing above Flatland and filming the action as\nthe polygons move around. If you then cut apart the film’s frames and stacked\nthem up in temporal order, you’d have a good model of part of the Flatland\nblock universe.\n\n![img](Images/p138_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 137. A region of Flatland’s spacetime_.\n\n![img](Images/p138_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 138. Flatland’s spacetime is like a stack of film frames_.\n\nBefore going any further, I should stop to answer a question that some of you\nmay be asking. _If we’re going to think of time as a fourth dimension, does\nthat mean that all the things we’ve said about the fourth dimension are really\nabout time_? The answer is _no_. Just as there is no one fixed direction in\nspace that we always call “width,” there need be no one fixed higher dimension\nthat is always called “time.” All our talk about the fourth dimension has\nenabled us to think of a variety of higher dimensions: a direction in which\none can jump out of space, a direction in which space is curved, a direction\nin which one moves to reach alternate universes. We can, if we like, insist\nthat the past/future axis of time is _the_ fourth dimension. And then we\npretty well have to say that the _ana/kata_ axis out of space is _the_ fifth\ndimension, and _the_ sixth dimension is the direction to other curved\nspacetimes. But there’s no point being so rigid about it. Nobody goes around\nsaying width is _the_ second dimension and height is _the_ third dimension.\nInstead we just say that height and width are space dimensions. Rather than\nsaying time is _the_ fourth dimension, it is more natural to say that time is\njust one of the higher dimensions.\n\n![img](Images/p139_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 139. Space + Time + Hyperspace, for Lineland_.\n\nIf we think of Lineland as being a one-dimensional (east/west) world whose\nspace bulges into hyperspace (_ana/kata_) wherever matter is present, and\nwhose space is different at different times (past/future), then we get a 3-D\nspace-hyperspace-time diagram as drawn in figure 139. Of course, if 1-D\nLineland were beefed up to a full 3-D space, the diagram would have to be 5-D.\nStaying with figure 139 for just another second, note that what is shown is\ntwo segments merging to make one large segment, and an extra-large segment\ngiving birth to a smaller segment. This picture makes up part of what we might\ncall the _Lineland block universe_.\n\nO.K. So now I’ve made the point that although time is one of the higher\ndimensions, there are many other possible dimensions as well. By the end of\nthis book I’ll be raving, and out-of-it, and saying space is infinite-\ndimensional, no doubt. But there’s still a lot more to say about spacetime and\nthe concept of the block universe.\n\nMany philosophers argue that it is wrong to say our reality is a block\nuniverse. They do not want to represent our past-present-future universe as a\nstatic 4-D spacetime pattern.\n\nThey feel that this eternal, unchanging image leaves out something important:\n_the passage of time_.\n\nOf course, the whole reason for introducing the block universe was to get rid\nof the passage of time. But how can I say that so universally experienced a\nphenomenon is nonexistent?\n\n_Wednesday, November 17, 1982_\n\nAnother day has passed, and here I am trying to claim that the passage of time\nis an illusion. What could be more ridiculous? I remember, about five years\nago, visiting my father in the hospital. He was having heart trouble, and felt\ndepressed. I tried to cheer him up by explaining the block universe to him,\nand by pointing out that one’s life is a permanent unchanging pattern in\nspacetime. “Rudy,” he said wearily, “all I know about time is that you get old\nand then you die.”\n\nIt certainly _feels_ like time is passing; I’d be foolish to argue otherwise.\nBut I want to show you that this feeling is a sort of illusion. Change is\nunreal. Nothing is happening. The feeling that time is passing is just that: a\n_feeling_ that goes with being a certain sort of spacetime pattern.\n\nLet me illustrate my thoughts with another excerpt from that imaginary\nclassic, _The Further Adventures of A Square_.\n\nThat afternoon my Father came to advise me of my impending Arrest. Una’s\nhusband had sworn out a Warrant of Complaint. Exhausted from my morning’s\npleasure, I scoffed at the old Triangle’s warnings and sent him on his way.\nWhat need had I to fear the vengeance of flat Polygons? Who of them could harm\n_me_ — friend and follower of A Cube? Filled by the delicious lassitude of\npassion spent, I fell into a slumber.\n\nIn Dream I saw the Sphere again, floating with me in some Higher Space. His\nsurface glowed with a solemn Luster, and I was seized with shame at my Vice.\nSeeking to dissemble, I called out a confident greeting.\n\nI: Hail, lordly Sphere. Long have I sought you, long have you lingered beyond\nmy ken.\n\nSPHERE: The Cube would teach you on his own. Space he has taught you, but now\nthat your Death draws near, I return to teach you Time.\n\nI: Why speak of Death? I have not sinned!\n\nSPHERE: Ah Square, so small is your knowing, so great is your baseness.\nWouldst lie to me, who sees All? I see your past, I see your future, and your\nfuture is fraught with Peril.\n\nI: What must I do to escape?\n\nSPHERE: Ask the villain Cube, when next you see him. Mayhap he knows some ruse\nto extend your Span. But it is all foolishness, your race is Mortal. The\nteaching I bring to this Vision is beyond your squalid struggle for more Time.\nMy Teaching is that Time is Unreal, and Eternity is Now.\n\nI: What kind of Death do you foresee?\n\nSPHERE: Silence, fool. Behold!\n\nAnd there before us I seemed to see a strange and intricate Form of three\ndimensions. It was like a Cube, but transparent and patterned all within.\nTubes and Worms and Threads ran from this strange Cube’s bottom to its top;\nsome of the Tubes were round in cross section, others were Triangular or\nSquare. The uppermost surface of the Cube looked familiar to me, and suddenly\nI realized it was my World.\n\n![img](Images/p141_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 140. A tangled tale_.\n\nThere slumbered my Square form, there was my Father’s familiar Triangle, and\nin the distance cowered a chastened Una. A Hexagon and an Isosceles were near\nmy sleeping form, evidently bent on Violence. Only my loyal Father’s\nintercession was keeping them at bay.\n\nAll this I saw atop the Cube. Moving my attention downward I could trace out\nthe whole tangled history of Love and Hate.\n\nThe Isosceles’s Point attracted my notice above all else, and I begged the\nSphere for aid.\n\nI: You will save me, will you not, most noble Sphere?\n\nSPHERE: Your salvation is not mine to grant. What is this object that we gaze\nupon?\n\nI: An ingenious model of some part of Flatland. There on the top is my\nsleeping Form, my Father, and …\n\nSPHERE: What of the Cube’s interior, Square?\n\nI: You have stacked up many models of my world, O Teacher. Each plane cross\nsection of the Cube displays a different instant of my recent (and regretted)\nCareer. It is indeed a clever Construct, an inspired use of Higher Space.\n\nSPHERE: Suppose I were to tell you this is no Construct? What you see is a\nhigher level of Reality. What you see is your Space and Time. This is your\nWorld.\n\nI: My Liege is pleased to be merry. This dead, unmoving Construct is to\nreplace the passionate bustle of Flatland life? One could as well say that a\npainting breathes, or that a statue weeps!\n\nSPHERE: The Teaching is strange, but it is no Jest. The block you see is a\nregion of Flatland’s Spacetime.\n\nI: Spacetime, my Lord?\n\nSPHERE: Space plus Time, thou Dullard. Hear the words of a great Spaceland\nthinker: _Henceforth space by itself, and time by_ _itself, are doomed to fade\naway into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an\nindependent reality_. Space is a shadow, Time’s passing is an illusion; only\nSpacetime is real.\n\n![img](Images/p142_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 141. The moving “Now.”_\n\nI: Again I must protest, O Round One. Life consists of change and Motion.\nWhere in this Construct of Flatland’s Spacetime is there Motion?\n\nSPHERE: You may _imagine_ the Motion as follows. Suppose that a plane were to\nmove up through the Cube of Spacetime. Think of the plane as a moving “Now.”\nFix your attention upon it, and you will see your Form dancing its sorry Jig.\n\nI: You are saying, then, that my conscious Mind lights up a cross section of\nSpacetime, and that the passage of Time is the upward motion of my Mind?\n\nSPHERE: I say no such thing. There is no motion in spacetime. Your Mind, such\nas it is, extends the length of your Span. More truly spoken, the Mind is\neverywhere, and you have no Mind at all.\n\nI: I do not understand you, my Lord.\n\nSPHERE: Nor do I understand myself.\n\n![img](Images/p143_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 142. Time as the motion of the mind’s eye_.\n\n_Thursday, November 18, 1982_\n\nThe purpose of the last dialogue was to present what the physicist David Park\nhas called “the fallacy of the animated Minkowski diagram.” A spacetime\ndiagram such as figure 140 is called a Minkowski diagram in honor of Russian\nmathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), who was the first to think of\ndrawing such pictures. A Square says that such a diagram is lacking something:\nthe passage of time. We do not experience childhood, adolescence, and maturity\nall at once. We live through one stage, then the next, then the next, and so\non. A Square feels that figure 140 is just a _model_ , but that the reality\nwould be best represented by moving an illuminated plane up through the\nspacetime solid. First one cross section would be lit up, then the next, then\nthe next, and so on. In this manner the static Minkowski diagram could be\n_animated_ , or brought to life. If we think of the spacetime diagram as being\nlike a movie, it is as if A Square is saying that the movie needs to be taken\nout of the can and projected. If we think of the diagram as being like a\nnovel, it is as if A Square is saying that the novel needs a reader who goes\nthrough it page by page.\n\nBut there are a lot of problems with the notion of an animated Minkowski\ndiagram. One difficulty is that if we think of a static spacetime, and then\nimagine an external Mind, which sort of moves a searchlight up along it, we\nhave introduced a second level of time: the time that lapses as the Mind moves\nits attention through spacetime. Now, if spacetime is to be _everything_ ,\nthen it seems awkward and wrong to have a second kind of time lapsing external\nto it. With something like a novel, this poses no problem: the book\nincorporates its own time pattern, and the time it takes me to read the book\nis something else entirely. But we do not stand outside the universe like a\nreader outside a book; we are _in_ our spacetime.\n\nThat’s just my opinion, of course. I have, in fact, met people who do hold to\nthe belief that spacetime _is_ something like a novel being “read” by their\nsoul, the “soul” being some kind of eye or observer that stands outside\nspacetime, slowly moving its gaze up along the time axis. I find this\nunsatisfying.\n\n![img](Images/p144_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 143. Three animations of the same life_.\n\nIf your life is like a novel that your soul is “reading,” then the past is not\nso real after all. Even worse, death is just as real as ever: death is when\nthe soul runs out of spacetime pattern to “read.”\n\nAnother confusing point the animated Minkowski diagram raises is this: what if\nthe diagram is animated more than once? What if, in other words, there is a\nsecond “reader of the novel,” or a third, or a fourth, or infinitely many?\nWhat if a whole series of souls moves through your spacetime, living your life\nover and over? What if a whole infinite continuum of souls is moving up\nthrough your life, one at each instant at all times? But then your whole life\nis “lit up,” so why say any thing’s moving at all?\n\nThe very starting point of special relativity theory consists in the discovery\nof a new and very astonishing property of time, namely the relativity of\nsimultaneity, which to a large extent implies that of succession. The\nassertion that the events _A_ and _B_ are simultaneous loses its objective\nmeaning, in so far as another observer, with the same claim to correctness,\ncan assert that _A_ and _B_ are not simultaneous.\n\nFollowing up the consequences of this strange state of affairs one is led to\nconclusions about the nature of time which are very far-reaching indeed. In\nshort, it seems that one obtains an unequivocal proof for the view of those\nphilosophers who, like Parmenides, Kant, and the modern idealists, deny the\nobjectivity of change and consider change as an illusion or an appearance due\nto our special mode of perception. The argument runs as follows: Change\nbecomes possible only through the lapse of time. The existence of an objective\nlapse of time, however, means that reality consists of an infinity of layers\nof ’now’ which come into existence successively. But, if simultaneity is\nsomething relative in the sense just explained, reality cannot be split up\ninto such layers in an objectively determined way. Each observer has his own\nset of ’nows,’ and none of these various systems of layers can claim the\nprerogative of representing the objective lapse of time.\n\nKURT GÖDEL,\n\n“A Remark on the Relationship Between Relativity Theory and Idealistic\nPhilosophy,” 1959\n\n_Friday, November 19, 1982_\n\nWhat I want to say is that each of us is a certain spacetime pattern in the\nblock universe. Today, or the day of my birth, or the day of my death — all\nare equally real, all are different pieces of the block universe. I will never\nstop living this instant. This instant will never cease to exist; this instant\nhas always existed.\n\nAbout ten years ago I had a chance to meet the great logician Kurt Gödel. I\nused to phone him up and ask him questions about philosophy. In my book\n_Infinity and the Mind_ I have a section that describes a conversation I had\nwith Gödel about the passage of time:\n\nWe talked a little set theory, and then I asked him my last question: “What\ncauses the illusion of the passage of time?”\n\nGödel spoke not directly to this question, but to the question of what my\nquestion meant — that is, why anyone would even believe that there is a\nperceived passage of time at all.\n\nHe went on to relate the getting rid of belief in the passage of time to the\nstruggle to experience the One Mind of mysticism. Finally he said this: “The\nillusion of the passage of time arises from confusing the _given_ with the\n_real_. Passage of time arises because we think of occupying different\nrealities. In fact, we occupy only different givens. There is only one\nreality.”\n\nBy a “given,” Gödel means a person’s sensations at some particular time. At\nany moment the world “gives” us a collection of sights, sounds, smells, and so\non. By a more or less unconscious process, we organize these sensations into a\nstable framework. This background framework, which everyone agrees on, is\nreality: a continuum of three space dimensions and one time dimension. When I\nam in my office, I do not doubt the existence of my home. By the same token,\nwhen it is 10:00, I do not doubt the existence of 7:00. I do not think of a\nperson as an object adrift in space; a person is a certain kind of pattern in\nspacetime.\n\nA human body changes most of its atoms every few years. Daily one eats and\ninhales billions of new atoms, daily one excretes, sheds, and breathes out\nbillions of old ones. Physically, my present body has almost nothing in common\nwith the body I had twenty years ago. Since I feel that I am still the same\nperson, it must be that “I” am something other than the collection of atoms\nmaking up my body. “I” am not so much my atoms as I am the _pattern_ in which\nmy atoms are arranged. Some of the atom patterns in my brain code up certain\nmemories; it is the continuity of these memories that gives me my sense of\npersonal identity.\n\n![img](Images/p146_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 144. People are spacetime braids of atom threads_.\n\nIn figure 144 we have drawn a picture to represent the fact that people are\npersistent spacetime patterns. To simplify things we represent a person as a\nbraid of three atom threads (where an “atom thread” is the spacetime trail of\nan individual atom). Note that in neither of the two braid-people in the\npicture’s center do we have any single atom thread going the whole length.\nNote also that an atom can leave one person’s braid and become part of someone\nelse’s.\n\nWhat I find most striking about figure 144 is that the gray boxes enclosing\nindividual lives are purely _imaginary_. The simple processes of eating and\nbreathing weave all of us together into a vast four-dimensional tapestry. No\nmatter how isolated you may sometimes feel, no matter how lonely, you are\nnever really cut off from the whole.\n\nI find this insight a great comfort. Instead of thinking of myself as a\ndecaying bag of meat, I can think of myself as a part of eternal spacetime.\nThis is a way to cheat death. Instead of identifying myself with my specific\nbody pattern, I identify myself with the block universe as a whole. I am, as\nit were, an eye that the cosmos uses to look at itself. The Mind is not mine\nalone; the Mind is everywhere. If I do not exist, then how can I die?\n\n_Monday, November 22, 1982_\n\n“How can I die?” Well, I could have fallen off that broken viaduct I was\ndrunkenly standing at the edge of, Saturday night, just to show off. Ow. Why,\nat my age, do I still do things like that? _To prove that I have free will_.\n\nEvery so often, one likes to do something foolish or unexpected. Much of life\nis quite predictable, but it is the crazy zigzags that give human life its\npeculiar savor. It’s not really necessary to do something stupid and dangerous\n… Taking your wife out for dinner on a Wednesday night can be unusual enough.\n\nIf we are indeed spacetime patterns in a block universe, then the future\nalready exists. Does this conflict with the notion that we have free will?\n\nNot really. When I say the future is already there, I am _not_ saying that the\nfuture can be predicted. When you are halfway through a detective novel, the\nending is already _there_ , printed on the last pages. But this does not mean\nthat you can always guess what the ending will be. I feel that my entire life\nexists as a timeless whole. But this does not mean that I can predict with\ncertainty what I’ll write tomorrow, or where I’ll live next year.\n\nSometimes when I try to explain the spacetime viewpoint to people they say, “\n_If you’re just a pattern in spacetime and the future’s already fixed, then\nwhy don’t you kill yourself and get it over with? I mean, you’re going to die\nanyway, right? Why not shoot yourself?”_ The answer is simple: “ _Because I\ndon’t want to.”_ I may enjoy dramatizing the choice between life and death by\nstanding at the edge of a hundred-meter drop — but I’m damn careful not to\nfall off.\n\n![img](Images/p148_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 145. I don’t want to die_.\n\nIt is a plant’s nature to grow toward the sun, to bloom, and to bear fruit. It\nis a person’s nature to live and love and work. In all likelihood, there is no\nbig “Answer,” and life has no significance outside itself. But that’s enough.\nAs Don Juan puts it in Carlos Castaneda’s _A Separate Reality_ :\n\nI choose to live, and to laugh, not because it matters, but because that\nchoice is the bent of my nature … A man of knowledge chooses a path with heart\nand follows it … Nothing being more important than anything else, a man of\nknowledge chooses any act, and acts it out as if it matters to him.\n\nThe idea here is that your life is a whole, and the overall pattern is what\ncounts. The unexpected kinks in the pattern correspond to places where you\nfeel yourself to be making a free will decision.\n\nSome people object very much to this view. So strong is their belief in the\nimportance of their own free will, that they feel the future does not exist at\nall. They may grant that the past exists, but they feel that the block\nuniverse is something that is growing upward as time goes on. In figure 146 we\nillustrate this viewpoint, along with the block universe viewpoint, and the\nviewpoint that gives reality only to the present instant.\n\n![img](Images/p149_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 146. Differing world views_.\n\nThe great advantage the block universe has over the other viewpoints is that\nin the block universe there is no objectively existing “Now.” Nothing is\nmoving in the block universe, and there is no need to try to find some\nabsolute and objective meaning for the horizontal space sheet that the other\ntwo models depend on.\n\nAs it turns out, it is actually _impossible_ to find any objective and\nuniversally acceptable definition of “all of space, taken at this instant.”\nThis follows, as we shall see, from Einstein’s special theory of relativity.\nThe idea of the block universe is, thus, more than an attractive metaphysical\ntheory. It is a well-established scientific fact.\n\n_Tuesday, November 23, 1982_\n\nToday I want to draw a lot of Minkowski diagrams: pictures of spacetime. To\nmake things easier, we’ll think of space as a one-dimensional line, and we’ll\nthink of objects as points moving back and forth on this line. The spacetime\ntrail of a dot is called the dot’s _world line_. In figure 147 we see five\ndifferent sorts of world lines. _A_ represents a motionless point, and _B_\nrepresents a point that moves steadily to the right. _C_ is a dot that starts\nout motionless but then begins moving faster and faster to the right. _D_\nmakes an excursion to the right and then comes back to his starting point. _E_\nis in a steady state of right-left oscillation.\n\n[PUZZLE 9.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch9pa1)\n\n_If we say that the fourth dimension is time, then it is possible to construct\na hypersphere in space and time. How_?\n\n![img](Images/p150_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 147. Various kinds of motion_.\n\nIt is really a bit misleading to say that _A_ is motionless, and _B_ is moving\nto the right. If _A_ and _B_ are actual people, say astronauts floating in\nempty space, then all they can really be sure of is that they are moving apart\nfrom each other.\n\n![img](Images/p150_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 148. Three descriptions of the same state of affairs_.\n\nSince it is impossible to make marks on the fabric of space, there really is\nno such thing as absolute motion. The only kind of motion one can hope to\nobserve is the motion of one object relative to some other object. This is the\ncontent of Einstein’s principle of relativity: “The laws by which the states\nof physical systems undergo change are not affected, whether these changes of\nstate be referred to the one or the other of two systems of coordinates in\nuniform translatory motion.” In formulating his theory of space and time,\nEinstein makes one other assumption, the principle of the constancy of the\nspeed of light: Whenever someone measures the speed of light, he or she will\nalways come up with the same value _c_ (= 29,979,245,620 centimeters per\nsecond ≈ one billion miles per hour). These two assumptions have strong\nempirical support. Taken together, they lead to a number of surprising\nconsequences.\n\nUsually, in drawing Minkowski diagrams, one adopts a system of units so that\nthe path of a light ray is represented by a 45° line. Light moves at about one\nbillion miles per hour, so the idea is to mark off the space axis in units of\nbillions of miles and mark off the time axis in units of one hour. In figure\n149 we have marked the axes in this way, and we have drawn in the world line\nof a pulse of light. At time 1, _A_ sends a light flash off to the right. One\nbillion miles away stands _M_ , patiently holding a mirror. After an hour’s\ntravel time, the light hits _M_ ’s mirror and bounces back to the left. _A_\ngets out of the light’s way, and it continues traveling to the left\nindefinitely.\n\n![img](Images/p151_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 149. World line of a photon_.\n\nAs far as we know, nothing travels faster than light. It is interesting to\nrealize that you are never actually seeing the world _right now_. What you see\nis always slightly in the past, as it takes the light time to get to you; what\nyou hear is even\n\n![img](Images/p152_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 150. Sight is faster than smell_.\n\nA person has all sorts of lags built into him, Kesey is saying. One, the most\nbasic, is the sensory lag, the lag between the time your senses receive\nsomething and you are able to react. One-thirtieth of a second is the time it\ntakes, if you’re the most alert person alive, and most people are a lot slower\nthan that … We are all of us doomed to spend our lives watching a _movie_ of\nour lives — we are always acting on what has just finished happening. It\nhappened at least 1/30 of a second ago. We think we’re in the present, but we\naren’t. The present we know is only a movie of the past, and we will really\nnever be able to control the present through ordinary means. That lag has to\nbe overcome some other way, through some kind of total breakthrough.\n\nTOM WOLFE,\n\n_The Electric Kool-Aid Acid_\n\n _Test_ , 1968\n\nfurther in the past; and smells travel even slower than sounds. You see the\nsky rocket’s flash, you hear its explosion, you smell the smoke. Your\nsensations, at any given instant, are all signals from various events in the\npast. Even what you feel and taste is not happening quite exactly now,\n\n![img](Images/p152_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 151. One’s sensations all come from the past_.\n\n![img](Images/p153_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 152. Bug Bites, UFO Zooms, Moon Booms_.\n\nas it takes some time for nerve impulses to travel from your skin to your\nbrain.\n\nTo talk about “all of space, taken right now,” is really to speak very\nabstractly. You certainly don’t _see_ all of space right now. The tree you see\nis really the tree of a ten-millionth of a second ago, the moon you see is the\nmoon of two seconds ago, the light from the setting sun started out nine\nminutes ago, and the twinkling stars are scattered back hundreds and thousands\nof years in the past. In point of fact, you can’t see anything that’s\nhappening right _now_. You have to wait for the light to get to you.\n\nIt is, of course, possible for us to piece together some kind of mental image\nof space right now. Suppose, for instance, that it is midnight, and you are\nsitting outside, looking at the moon. A mosquito bites you, and then two\nseconds later you see the flash of some huge explosion on the moon. Since you\nknow that it takes light two seconds to travel from moon to earth, you can\nconclude that the “Now” that had you being bitten by the mosquito also\nincluded the explosion on the moon.\n\nSo far this does not seem to go against any of the viewpoints that hold that\nthere really is a spacelike “Now” moving forward through time. But there is a\nproblem with the way in which we construct our notion of “all space taken\nright now.” The problem is that if someone is moving relative to us, then he\nwill construct his spacelike “Now” in a different way.\n\nSuppose, to be specific, that a flying saucer had drifted past the Earth-moon\nsystem on that fateful night when the mosquito bit you and you saw a flash on\nthe moon. If the aliens happen to be moving from Earth toward the moon, then\nthey will actually reach the conclusion that the explosion happened _first_.\nIf they are moving from the moon toward the Earth, they will, in their frame\nof reference, say that the explosion happened _second_. The reasoning behind\nthese two claims is not obvious, and I won’t try to give it here.\n\nThe point is simply this: differently moving observers will differ on whether\nor not certain events happen at the same time. Nobody can really be _at_ both\nthe mosquito bite and the explosion. Whether these two events happen at the\nsame time is really just a matter of opinion; nature stipulates no absolute\nanswer to the question.\n\nThe phenomenon just alluded to is called the relativity of simultaneity. The\nimportant consequence of the relativity of simultaneity is that differently\nmoving observers will find different ways of slicing spacetime up into a stack\nof “Nows.” The three observers drawn in figure 153 could be peacefully living\nin three different galaxies that are moving relative to one another. What\nreason could we possibly have to say that one of the three ways of slicing up\nspacetime is correct, and the other two are wrong?\n\n![img](Images/p154_1.jpg)\n\n_Now and the future_.\n\n[PUZZLE 9.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch9pa2)\n\n_What kind of ideas about the past and future are embodied in this picture,\nwhere one thinks of the spacetime solid as being something like a block of ice\nthat melts from the bottom up_?\n\nSo relativity theory implies that there is no one preferred way in which to\nslice spacetime into a stack of “Nows.” Recall that relativity is based on the\nassumption that it is impossible to permanently mark a given space location.\nAnother way of putting this is that “right here” has no real meaning over a\nperiod of time. We have seen that this assumption, oddly enough, implies that\n“right now” has no real meaning over a region of space. Since there is no one\npreferred way of defining “Now,” it must be that “Now” has no objective\nmeaning. This means that there really is no moving present, and that the block\nuniverse viewpoint is the correct one. Spacetime is a single unified whole,\nand the passage of time is just an illusion.\n\n![img](Images/p155_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 153. Three ways to slice spacetime_.\n\n_Wednesday, November 24, 1982_\n\nThe special theory of relativity is extremely well tested. It makes a number\nof definite predictions about the behavior of matter in motion. These\npredictions have been borne out thousands and thousands of times in\nexperiments involving particle accelerators.\n\nYesterday I was discussing one of the very attractive implications of\nrelativity: the implication that we are eternal spacetime patterns in an\nunchanging block universe. But relativity also has some less pleasant\nconsequences. The worst thing about relativity is that it implies that we can\nnever travel faster than the speed of light.\n\nSome people get almost paranoid about this galling prediction. Without ever\nbothering to learn anything about relativity, they jump to the conclusion that\nEinstein was simply a dogmatic spoilsport not much different from the people\nwho used to say that man will never fly. “Why _shouldn’t_ we be able to go\nfaster than a billion miles per hour? If you get a big enough rocket and run\nit long enough, you can go as fast as you like, right? What’s the matter with\nEinstein anyway? Wasn’t he a German or a Jew or something? Un-American for\nsure, and probably scared of progress!”\n\nThere are, according to relativity theory, two problems with faster-than-light\ntravel. The first problem is that the closer any object gets to the speed of\nlight, the greater the object’s mass becomes. And the greater an object’s mass\nis, the harder it is to accelerate the object to a yet higher speed. It would\nrequire, in point of fact, an _infinite_ amount of rocket fuel to accelerate a\nspaceship up to the speed of light.\n\n![img](Images/p156_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 154. Past, Future, and Elsewhere_.\n\nIf I can never travel faster than the speed of light, then only a limited\nregion of spacetime is accessible to me. Those events that I can still reach\nwithout traveling faster than light are called my “future.” This is a use of\nthe word that is peculiar to relativity theory. Normally I think of my future\nas being those events I will actually experience, but here I am using “future”\nto mean all the events that I could conceivably attend or influence, without\nusing faster-than-light travel. In a similar vein, I can take my “past” to be\nall the spacetime locations from which it would have been possible to travel,\nin order to reach me here and now. The rest of spacetime is called\n“elsewhere,” a lovely word. It always relaxes me to think about events as\nbeing “elsewhere.” Whatever our leaders in Washington may be doing right this\ninstant doesn’t really matter: it’s “elsewhere.” Unfortunately, these\nimportant people’s actions don’t _stay_ elsewhere — my “past” is larger at\npoints further along my world line.\n\n![img](Images/p157_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 155. “Elsewhere” today, “Past” tomorrow_.\n\nThe second problem with faster-than-light travel has to do with the relativity\nof simultaneity. Given any event at all in your “elsewhere,” there will be\nsome observer to say it is happening at the same time as your “here and now.”\nThe whole of “elsewhere” is a sort of smeared out “Now.” Usually we think of\n“Now” as a line between “past” and “future,” but in relativity theory, this\n“Now” smears out into the hourglass-shaped “elsewhere.” What this means is\nthat one path into “elsewhere” is as good as any other. The trouble is that\nsome kinds of paths into “elsewhere” seem too weird to be possible. In figure\n156 I have drawn three paths into “elsewhere.” The top one is unproblematic;\nit simply corresponds to someone who travels two billion miles per hour, or\ntwice the speed of light. The next path is horizontal and, relative to the\ninitial frame of reference, seems to represent a person who travels billions\nof miles in no time at all. This corresponds to an _infinite_ velocity. The\nbottom path is the worst. Here the traveler seems to go backward in time. If\nhe were to return from such a trip along a horizontal path, he would be able\nto meet up with his own past self! In other words, faster-than-light travel\ncan lead to time travel — and many scientists feel that time travel must be\nimpossible. The trouble with time travel is that it leads to some really\nvicious paradoxes, paradoxes we’ll go into in the next chapter. For now,\nsuffice it to say that so far as we know, no chains of cause and effect can\nproceed faster than light.\n\n![img](Images/p158_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 156. Trips into Elsewhere_.\n\n[PUZZLE 9.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch9pa3)\n\n![img](Images/p158_2.jpg)\n\n_Willy Lee says_ X _happens simultaneously with_ B.\n\n“ _The relativity of simultaneity” says that different moving observers will\nhave different opinions about which events are simultaneous. In this problem\nwe see how the relativity of simultaneity follows from the two basic\nassumptions: (1) that moving observers are free to think of themselves as\nbeing at rest, and (2) that light always travels at the same speed_.\n\n _The situation is as follows. A rigid platform is moving to the right at\nabout half the speed of light On the left end stands Mr. Willy Lee, and on the\nright end stands Mr. Rye. Mr. Lee sends a flash of light down the platform\ntoward Mr. Rye. Mr. Rye holds a mirror that bounces the light flash back\ntoward Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee receives the return signal. Call these events_ A, B,\n_and_ C, _respectively. Mr. Lee notes the times of events_ A _and_ C _on his\nworld line. After a little thought he decides which event_ X _on his world\nline is simultaneous with_ B. _Where does he put_ X, _and why? (Hint_ : We\n_would place_ X _horizontally across from_ B, _but Mr. Lee will_ not.\n_Simultaneity is relative!_)\n\nWell, that’s all I have time for. I have to go home early today, to help get\nready for Thanksgiving. Seems like every time you turn around it’s Christmas\nor Thanksgiving.\n\n“The number of all the atoms which make up the world is, although excessive,\nfinite, and as such only capable of a finite (although also excessive) number\nof permutations. Given an infinite length of time, the number of possible\npermutations must be exhausted, and the universe must repeat itself. Once\nagain you will be born of the womb, once again your skeleton will grow, once\nagain this page will reach your same hands, once again you will live all the\nhours until the hour of your incredible death.” Such is the customary order of\nthe argument, from its insipid prelude to the enormous threatening dénouement.\n\nJORGE LUIS BORGES,\n\n“The Doctrine of Cycles,” 1934\n\n_Tuesday, November 30, 1982_\n\nAnother holiday over with. My mother came, and my brother Embry with his wife\nand two kids. It was nice to see the five little cousins enjoying it: the\ntreats, the wheel of the seasons, the eternal return.\n\nBorges has an interesting essay on the esoteric doctrine of “the eternal\nreturn.” This is the idea that _everything repeats itself_.\n\nMany things in our ordinary experience do repeat themselves. Exhale/inhale,\nday/night, summer/winter, parent/child: these are cycles that repeat\nthemselves endlessly. Obviously, my 1982 Thanksgiving is not _identical_ with\nall the other Thanksgivings. Yet, on some level, they _are_ all the same, at\nleast as regards the broadest features, the turkey and gravy, loud children,\ndrunkenness, quarreling, laughter, and prayer. At some point during a long\nholiday’s welcome ordeal, most of us will experience moments, or even quarter-\nhours, of transcendence, of timelessness, of that full acceptance of time’s\nfabric, which, paradoxically, sets one free from time entirely. The very\nrepetitiousness of human rituals provides some kind of glimpse into eternity;\nthe endless line is bent into a circle.\n\n![img](Images/p159_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 157. The Eternal Return_.\n\nDespite all this, the eternal return is still a very unlikely notion. Can\nanyone really believe that at some future time the universe will be in exactly\nthe same state as it is now? But this is what the doctrine of the eternal\nreturn asserts: there is some fixed length of time, some cosmic cycle, after\nwhich the entire history of the universe repeats itself. We might suppose a\nfull cycle to last, say, twenty billion years.\n\n![img](Images/p160_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 158. Endless, repeating time_.\n\nThere are two different ways of looking at a cosmos that has the property of\nrepeating itself. We can imagine that time extends to infinity in both\ndirections, and that space-time is made up of infinitely many identical\nhorizontal “stripes.” Alternatively, we can imagine that time is bent into a\nfinite, yet endless, circle. If a person is strongly committed to the “moving\nNow” viewpoint, then the first alternative will seem more attractive. If, that\nis, you believe that only the present has real existence, then you will feel\nthat even if the universe were to repeat itself, the next cycle would be\nsomehow different. But for someone who holds to the “block universe” view of\nspacetime, the second way of illustrating the eternal return will seem more\nnatural. If spacetime is indeed a solidly existing thing, then we have no real\nproblem with bending it into a “cylinder.”\n\n![img](Images/p161_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 159. Circular time_.\n\nSee, I answer him that ask-eth, “What did God before He _made heaven and\nearth_? I answer not as one is said to have done merrily (eluding the pressure\nof the question), “He was preparing hell (saith he) for pryers into\nmysteries.” It is one thing to answer enquiries, another to make sport of\nenquirers.\n\nST. AUGUSTINE,\n\n_Confessions_ , A.D. 400\n\nThe notion of “circular time” leads to some interesting paradoxes, which we’ll\ndiscuss in puzzle 10.5. But right now let’s go on and look at some of the\nother overall shapes that spacetime might have.\n\nKeep in mind that in all of these pictures, we think of the horizontal axis as\nbeing space, and we think of the vertical axis as being time. The horizontal\naxis is, if you will, our concept of “now,” and the vertical axis is our\nconcept of “here.” The event that we call “here and now” is, of course, the\npoint where the two axes intersect. One often “reads” these spacetime diagrams\nby imagining the horizontal axis to move upward as time goes on. But, as I\nhave repeatedly pointed out, it is not always necessary or desirable to\nanimate our Minkowski diagrams in such fashion.\n\nFigure 160 shows three kinds of spacetime. In each of them, space is infinite,\nstretching out endlessly in both directions; and in each of them, the future\nalso is endless. The models differ in the way they depict the past. The\npicture in the middle shows a universe in which all of space springs into\nexistence at once, and the left-hand picture shows a universe that has no\nbeginning in time. The right-hand picture shows a much odder situation, a\nuniverse in which different parts of space come into existence at different\ntimes. In such a universe there might be, for instance, a big hole in space\nout between Neptune and Uranus, a hole that would eventually shrink and\ndisappear. (In the picture I have labeled the event of such a hole’s\ndisappearance with the letter D.)\n\n![img](Images/p161_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 160. Three ways to start the universe_.\n\n![img](Images/p162_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 161. Circular space_.\n\nAnother type of spacetime model arises if we assume that space is\n“hyperspherical,” as was proposed in [chapter 8](17_Chapter8.html). In terms\nof Lineland, this would mean that space is a circle, leading to the kind of\npicture drawn in figure 161. Figure 162 shows an alternate way of viewing a\nuniverse in which traveling far enough in any direction always leads to a\nregion apparently identical with your starting point. Instead of showing space\nas curving back on itself, figure 162 shows space as extending to infinity in\nboth directions, and with spacetime divided into infinitely many identical\nvertical strips. A mysterious harmony would have to be invoked to explain the\nrepetition. Figure 161 is, of course, much more natural, just as a “circular\ntime” model was a more natural way of representing the eternal return.\n\n![img](Images/p162_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 162. Endless, repeating space_.\n\n[PUZZLE 9.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch9pa4)\n\n_Infigure 161, we drew a picture of a circular space that remains the same\nsize as time goes on. A widely held present-day view of the universe is that\nour space is an expanding hypersphere, which started out as point-sized about\ntwelve billion years ago. Can you draw a picture of spacetime that represents\nour space as an expanding circle_?\n\n![img](Images/p163_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 163. A pre-established harmony_?\n\nOne reason that I’ve been dating the sections of this chapter as I write them\nis simply to make a little fun of my argument that time is unreal. A more\nserious reason is that I feel like an Arctic explorer, keeping a log of the\ntrip as he pushes further and further into the unexplored waste. _At night the\nbarking of the dogs, the mad splendour of the Aurora Borealis_. The goal of my\nquest is a certain vision, a vision of the cosmos as a pattern in infinite-\ndimensional space. I want a comprehensive and absolute model for the world\naround me, a system that includes the realities of ordinary human life as well\nas the cold truths of science.\n\n![img](Images/p163_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 164. Onward!_\n\nUntil today I’ve been unsure as to whether I can finish the journey. But this\nmorning I caught sight of the goal. Reality is one, it is a thing that\nprovides an answer to any of the infinitely many questions one might ask; it\nis, in other words, a coloring-in of infinite-dimensional space. Stick with\nme, we’ll get there yet!\n\n\n## 10\n\n## Time Travel  \nand Telepathy\n\nWHY DOES TRAVEL have to be so hard? The perfect vehicle is easy to imagine: a\nsort of automobile with some special buttons on the dash. Get in, punch the\ncode numbers of where and when you want to be, turn the ignition key, and —\n_presto_ — there you are in 1920s Paris, on the Great Plains before the\npioneers, on the moon, or even in another galaxy.\n\nPeople have long dreamed of such a freedom from the fetters of space and time.\nIn one Grimm brothers fairy tale, the young hero gets hold of a “wishing\nsaddle” Get on the saddle, say where you want to be, and instantly you are\nthere. Science fiction writers variously call this teleportation,\ninstantaneous matter transmission, hypertravel, or FTL travel, where _FTL_\nstands for _F_ aster-_T_ han-_L_ ight. Closely related is the idea of time\ntravel, the ability to jump back to the past or forward to the future.\n\nWill time travel and FTL travel ever become a reality? Will the final conquest\nof time and space ever be ours? Speaking practically, the question is what\nsorts of physical phenomena might conceivably make time travel and FTL travel\npossible. Not much is really known here, but there is some chance that by\nmanipulating very massive systems — such as black holes — we could perhaps\ndistort space and time in such a way as to permit the kind of spacetime leaps\nthat time travel and FTL travel call for. Another path toward such travel may\nlead through quantum mechanics, with its hints that at the deepest level of\nreality, time and space do not really exist at all. If one could somehow\nmanage to repeatedly tune in and out of the spacetime framework, one could end\nup anywhere and anywhen at all. But no one has any idea of how actually to do\nthis.\n\n![img](Images/p166_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 165. Quantum mechanics_?\n\nAfter such tempting speculations, it is a little surprising to learn that most\nscientists reject the ideas of time travel and FTL travel. Even though no one\nhas ever tried to carry out tests of a time machine, most scientists are\nconfident that such tests would fail. Is this just blind prejudice?\n\nNot really. The problem with time travel is that it leads to physical\nparadoxes, to contradictions in the fabric of reality. And most scientists\nfeel that our world is too logically put together to allow the occurrence of\ndirect contradictions. The reasons for rejecting time travel and FTL travel\nare thus of an a priori nature: _Contradictions cannot occur in the world,\ntime travel and FTL travel can lead to contradictions, therefore there is no\nsuch thing as time travel or FTL travel in our world_.\n\nThis is a subtle argument, and well worth considering in some detail. First of\nall, what is really wrong with having a contradiction in the world? Don’t\ncontradictions happen all the time? I want a hamburger, and I don’t want a\nhamburger. A photon is a particle, and a photon is a wave. A zebra is white,\nand a zebra is black.\n\nThese are contradictions of a sort, but not really unbearable ones. The fact\nthat I both want and don’t want a hamburger points only to the fact that “I”\nam a conglomerate of conflicting desires. A photon is never observed to be\nboth particle and wave at the same instant. A zebra is black and white, but in\ndifferent stripes.\n\n![img](Images/p167_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 166. Yes and no_.\n\nAlthough our world may appear to have some contradictions in it, these\ncontradictions can ordinarily be resolved by making a finer distinction. But\nwhat about an absolute contradiction? What about some concrete, specific fact\n_A_ for which both _A_ and not-A are true? Here are two examples of what I\ncall _yes-and-no paradoxes_ in time travel.\n\n1\\. At age thirty-six, Professor Zone suffers a temporary psychosis.

On his fiftieth birthday, Zone finally completes his work: the\nconstruction of a working time machine. He gets in the machine, travels back\nsome fourteen years, and goes to look in the window of the house where he and\nhis dear wife used to live.

On Monday the Beagle Boys steal Uncle Scrooge’s new time machine. They use\nit to pop into the future and find out who will win the big horse race on\nWednesday. It’ll be Ole Plug, a hundred-to-one shot! Back on Monday they\nwonder how to get enough money to bet. All they have is one lousy dollar, and\nthe minimum bet is two bucks. “I’ve got it.” Beagle Boy 22-03-46 grins. “On\nThursday we’ll send one of our two hundred greenbacks back to Tuesday. That\nway on Wednesday we’ll have the two smackers to put on Ole Plug!” Tuesday,\nsure enough, a dollar bill appears in their hideout. Wednesday Ole Plug wins,\njust as they knew he would, and the Beagle Boys all go out to celebrate.\nUnfortunately, they overdo it a bit, and on Thursday they’re down to one lousy\ndollar again. “O.K.,” says 22-03-46, “time to send this dollar back to\nTuesday!” “Forget it,” answers young 2308-69. “I’m taking this dollar to buy a\ncan of beans.” 23-0869 snatches the bill away from 22-03-46, and leaves. _The_\n_Paradox_ : Since the dollar appeared Tuesday, they must have sent it back\nfrom Thursday. Yet, when the time comes, they _don’t_ send it back. Do they\nsend a dollar back? _Yes and no_.\n\nThese paradoxes are, on one level, little more than amusing intellectual\ngames. One tends to feel there is always some way to weasel out. What if\nZone-50 actually went to the wrong house? What if 22-03-46, worried about the\nparadox, manages to get a dollar on Friday and _then_ sends it to the Tuesday\nBeagle Boys? But you can’t always be sure of lucking out. Time travel can lead\nto irreconcilable paradoxes. I’d like now to present a nice, clean version of\nsuch a paradox, in terms of a Minkowski diagram.\n\n![img](Images/p169_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 168. Two SF dreams_.\n\nKeep in mind that in these spacetime diagrams, the horizontal direction is\nspace (Lineland, strictly speaking), and the vertical direction is time. World\nlines involving time travel and FTL travel would look something like the\ndiagrams in figure 168. In each case I have used a dotted line for the part of\nthe world line that represents the “jump.” I do this to suggest that such\njumps, if at all possible, would probably be done by somehow moving out of\nnormal spacetime to travel through some higher dimension. A second point worth\nmaking here is that if you are going to time-travel to your own past, it is\nwise to do it while you are in motion. Otherwise you may jump to a place\noccupied by your past self, and there could be a nasty explosion. So the time\ntraveler in figure 168 is moving slowly to the right both before and after his\njump. (We will assume that the time machine jumps back to the same position,\n_relative to the laboratory_ , that it jumps from.)\n\n![img](Images/p170_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 169. A two-minute jump back_.\n\nNow for the paradox. Suppose that I build a small time machine capable of\ntransporting itself two minutes back in time. Around 11:55 A.M. I set it\nslowly rolling to the right on my laboratory bench, and with a timer switch\nset to initiate the jump at 12:01. I sit there watching, and at 11:59 there\nare suddenly two time machines on my bench: _M_ , the one that has not yet\njumped, and _M*_ , the one that has jumped back from the future. For two\nminutes both machines are there, and then at 12:01 the timer switch goes off\nand M disappears. After 12:01 I am left only with _M*_ , which is really a\nlater version of _M_.\n\n![img](Images/p170_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 170. Two time machines_.\n\nSo far, so good. Now we introduce the paradox. Suppose that for safety reasons\nmy time machine _M_ is equipped with a sonar device to make sure that the\nlaboratory bench is clear before any jump takes place. If _M_ senses any other\nobject on the bench with it at 12:01, then it overrides the timer switch and\nrefuses to jump. Now repeat the experiment. What happens?\n\nI suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder\nat what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one hand\nand the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately\nthe second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and,\nlooking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened?\nFor a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the\nclock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten;\nnow it was nearly half-past three!\n\nI drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and\nwent off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett\ncame in, and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I\nsuppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed\nto shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its\nextreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in\nanother moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter\nand ever fainter. Tomorrow night came black, then day again, night again, day\nagain, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a\nstrange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n\nH. G. WELLS,\n\n_The Time Machine_ , 1895\n\nIf _M*_ appears at 11:59, then it will still be around at 12:01, and _M_ will\nsense it with its sonar. If _M_ senses _M*_ , then _M_ will refuse to make the\njump. And if no jump takes place, then _M*_ does not appear at 11:59.\n\nIf _M*_ does not appear at 11:59, then the bench will be clear at 12:01, and\n_M_ will make the jump as planned. If _M_ makes the jump, then _M*_ appears at\n11:59.\n\nConclusion? _M*_ appears at 11:59 if and only if _M*_ does not appear at\n11:59. Now, one of the two alternatives must actually happen: either _M*_\nappears or it doesn’t. But we have just proved that if either alternative\nhappens, then the other alternative happens as well. So _M*_ appears on the\nlaboratory bench at 11:59, and _M*_ does not appear on the laboratory bench at\n11:59. Does _M*_ appear? _Yes and no_.\n\nIt is very hard to imagine a world in which such a logically contradictory\nstate of affairs is possible. Since the existence of a time machine can lead\nto such a contradiction, many scientists feel that time machines are logically\nimpossible.\n\nFurther, it is possible to show that any FTL travel machine can be adapted to\nbecome a time machine. The argument, which we briefly mentioned in the last\nchapter, hinges on what Einstein dubbed the relativity of simultaneity.\nLoosely speaking, the idea is that once you travel faster than light, you are\nin fact traveling into the past relative to some observers. Once this is\naccomplished, you can change your speed in such a way as to end up in your own\npast. In other words, an FTL traveler can return from his trip before he\nleaves — and this is time travel.\n\nSince FTL travel leads to time travel, and time travel leads to logical\ncontradiction, many scientists feel it is also possible to rule out FTL travel\nby a priori reasoning.\n\nHow strong are these arguments, really? Returning to our “disproof” of time\ntravel, there seem to be three kinds of loopholes. (1) What if there were time\nmachines, but no one ever used them to produce contradictions? Perhaps some\nkind of “Time Police” might be recruited to prevent such experiments. Or maybe\nthe cosmos would, in the interest of self-preservation, strike dead anyone\nabout to perform a paradoxical time travel experiment! (2) Maybe there can\nactually be contradictions in the fabric of reality. It is, perhaps, not\n_completely_ impossible to think of an _M*_ that both appears and does not\nappear. Maybe contradictions are rare, but not totally ruled out. After all,\nthere is a sense in which the very existence of our world is a contradiction:\nfor how could something come from nothing? (3) Perhaps there is some more\nrefined sense of the word _exist_ under which something could manage both to\nexist and not exist. If there were many parallel universes, for instance, then\nwe could have _M*_ existing in some and not existing in others. The simplest\nsolution along these lines would be to postulate that a time machine always\ntravels to the past of some world other than the world it starts out in.\nParadoxes arise only if you go into your _own_ past and do something like\nsmothering your own grandfather in his cradle. If you kill some poor baby in a\nparallel world, no contradiction comes up.\n\n![img](Images/p172_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 171. “Time travel” to another universe_.\n\nIf we redraw our two-minute time machine paradox in terms of parallel worlds\nwe get figure 171. When the machine jumps back in time, it also jumps over to\na different sheet of spacetime, as indicated. In a situation like this, all\nyou would see would be the disappearance of your “time machine” at 12:01.\nYou’d probably never see the machine again — though if it was programmed to do\nfurther jumps it might conceivably reappear in your laboratory at some future\ntime. Most science fiction writers use this notion of parallel universes to\navoid the paradoxes of time travel. Strictly speaking, of course, travel to a\nparallel world is not time travel at all.\n\n![img](Images/p173_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 172. The three freedoms_.\n\nIt is interesting to put into one diagram the three kinds of “special travel”\nthat appear over and over in science fiction tales: time travel, travel to\nalternate worlds, and FTL travel. These correspond to three mutually\nperpendicular types of motion. The great popular appeal of these kinds of\ntravel is that they promise freedom from the fetters of the human condition.\nTime travel sets one free from the blind juggernaut of time, free from\nfruitless nostalgia. FTL travel frees one from the obstinate tyranny of\nphysical distance, from the dull necessities of actual travel. Travel to\nalternate worlds frees one from having to occupy any fixed position in\nsociety, and frees one from having to accept the world as it is. At the\ndeepest level there is really not that much psychological difference among the\nthree sorts of travel; each provides a magical escape from the here-and-now-\nand-how. Rationally, we all know that we can change our lives if we really\nwant to: you take a vacation, you find a new job, you sell your house and\nmove. But making a big change is so hard. How much easier it would be to just\nget in a machine and push some buttons!\n\nSo far we have discussed only one basic type of time travel paradox, the yes-\nand-no paradox. There is another, less vicious kind of time travel paradox,\nthe _closed causal loop_. Here are two examples.\n\n![img](Images/p173_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 173.

Every time I tapped it after that, a new\npage appeared. They were written in a kind of linguistic shorthand, but they\nwere complete.

An inventor is in his laboratory, struggling to assemble a working time\nmachine. Suddenly there is a flash of light, and a man from the future\nappears, riding a lovely time machine. “I’m an historian,” says the man from\nthe future. “I want to interview you, as you are the inventor of the time\nmachine.” “But I don’t know how to build one yet,” replies the inventor. “I\ndon’t know if I’ll _ever_ get it right.” “Well, here,” says the helpful\nhistorian, “just look my time machine over, and build yourself a copy of it.”\n_Who invents the time machine_?\n\n2\\. In 1969 the childless yet kindly Goodcheese couple find a baby girl on\ntheir doorstep. They name her Cynthia and raise her like a daughter. Cynthia\nshows an incredible aptitude for physics and earns her Ph.D. from Cal Tech at\nage nineteen. She falls in love with Randy Crassman, a young biologist deeply\ninvolved with cloning research. Foundations shower money upon them. Cynthia\nconstructs the world’s first time machine, and Randy manages to get one of\nCynthia’s cells to grow into an exact copy of baby Cynthia herself. A\nconservative faction takes over the government and rules that the cloned baby\nmust be destroyed. Tearfully, Cynthia puts the baby into her time machine and\nsends it back to 1969. The baby, as chance would have it, lights on the\ndoorstep of the childless yet kindly Goodcheese couple. _Where did Cynthia\nreally come from_?\n\nA simple “laboratory” example of a closed causal loop would be the following.\nOne morning I come into my laboratory and putter around, cleaning off my\nworkbench. At 11:59, to my surprise, a small two-minute time machine appears\non the bench. To test if it really works, I set it to jump back two minutes at\n12:01. At 12:01 it disappears.\n\nIn figure 174 we can see the loop very clearly. There’s no actual\ncontradiction here, but it’s certainly a weird situation. At first one may be\ntempted to think of the little time machine as circling around and around the\nloop. This temptation should be resisted! If we stick to the spacetime\nviewpoint, we do not have to imagine that anything in figure 174 is actually\n_moving_. There is simply a circular loop here, a circle with no beginning and\nno end.\n\nSuch closed causal loops are not ruled out in modern physics. Far from it!\nAccording to quantum mechanics, empty space actually seethes with little\nmatter / antimatter loops. The idea is that energy, such as is carried by a\nphoton of light, can be briefly converted into mass, and then reconverted back\ninto energy. At a given point, one might have an electron and a positron\nemerging out of nothing, only to bump back into each other and disappear.\n\n![img](Images/p175_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 174. A closed causal loop_.\n\nThe reason we might think of this as a closed causal loop is that a positron\nis sometimes thought of as an electron that goes backward in time. A\n_positron_ , I should explain, is a particle with exactly the same mass, spin,\nsize, and so on, as an electron. The only difference between the two is that\nthe electron carries a charge of _minus_ one, and the positron carries a\ncharge of _plus_ one. These matched particles are said to be a matter /\nantimatter pair because whenever an electron and a positron get close to each\nother they disappear in a flash of light. This process is called _mutual\nannihilation_. The other side of the coin is that whenever you create an\nelectron out of nothing, you also have to create a positron at the same time.\nThis process is called _pair production_.\n\n![img](Images/p175_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 175. A pattern in the mass-energy dance_.\n\nThe kind of process illustrated in figure 175 is known to happen very\ncommonly. If we look at it in terms of the “moving Now” viewpoint, it seems a\nlittle surprising that the electron and positron manage so neatly to appear\nand disappear together. But according to physicist Richard Feynman, one can\ntake a spacetime viewpoint and regard the positron as an electron that is\ntraveling backward in time. From this standpoint we simply have a nice little\nclosed causal loop.\n\nThe notion of a particle “moving backward in time” is not really taken too\nseriously by the physicists. It is more a mathematical fiction than an actual\nphenomenon. No physicist, as far as I know, entertains hopes of using a beam\nof positrons to somehow send signals into the past. But once you start\nthinking in these terms it is hard to stop. What would it be like to actually\nlive part of one’s life backward in time? A few years ago I wrote a very short\nstory in which the heroine goes around a “corner in time.” Here it is,\ncomplete with Minkowski diagram:\n\n![img](Images/p176_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 176. Diagram for “A New Experiment with Time.”_\n\nA NEW EXPERIMENT WITH TIME\n\nThe first thing the citizens of Bata notice is a greasy place in the street. A\nfat man slips on it. Bill Stook comes down in the yellow pickup with the\nsmashed fender and throws on a bucket of sand.\n\nLet us imagine an Intelligence who would know at a given instant of time all\nforces acting in nature and the position of all things of which the world\nconsists; let us assume, further, that this Intelligence would be capable of\nsubjecting all these data to mathematical analysis. Then it could derive a\nresult that would embrace in one and the same formula the motion of the\nlargest bodies in the universe and of the lightest atoms. Nothing would be\nuncertain for this Intelligence. The past and the future would be present to\nits eyes.\n\nPIERRE-SIMON LAPLACE,\n\n_Theory of Probability_ , 1812\n\nA week later the patch begins to stink. The stuff has thickened and drawn\ntogether. There’s lots of flies that come and land on your face afterwards.\nThe kindergarten teacher twists her ankle. Black high-heels and a thin summer\ndress.\n\nStook comes back with a shovel, but he can’t get the stuff loose. A few idlers\n— day tripping feebs — give their advice, spit-talking about glare-ice and\nmineral oil. Finally Stook throws on some more sand and goes home.\n\nUnder the arc-lights the patch is elliptical, four by eight feet. It cuts\nacross the crosswalk and both lanes of traffic. The tire-marks on it extend\nout into straight smears in either direction. A dog has dropped a bone in the\nmiddle.\n\nMaisie Gleaves lives in a Buffalo rooming house. She is black and white, with\nred lipstick and a christmas-green raincoat. Every night she lies on her bed,\nlooking at her Bata High School yearbook. Two years now. Somehow she will go\nback.\n\nWorkmen are putting up a banner saying, BATA SIDEWALK SALE DAYS. Meanwhile a\ngroup of men, shopkeepers, inspect the stinking patch of pulp. One of them\ntries to pick up a bone. His fingers slide off it. It’s an outrage. Bill Stook\nis called and threatened with dismissal.\n\nHe covers the patch with sawdust and puts a refreshment stand around it.\nSIDEWALK SALE DAYS. In the hot sun, people order hot dogs, catch a whiff of\ndecay and put on more mustard. Stook mans the booth, nipping whiskey from a\npint bottle. The flattened lump underfoot feels springy.\n\nA white sunset slides under low clouds. They dismantle the booth and the\nsawdust blows away. Mashed arms and legs, tooth cracklings, scraps of green\ncloth. The tire tracks are gone from the flattened corpse. The state police\ntake Stook away.\n\nMaisie watches Buffalo TV in a silver diner. Trouble in Bata. She remembers\nall the lost faces. Ron. She pays for her tea. Back in her room she stares\ninto the mirror for two hours. Her image is moving closer.\n\nSleeping or waking, it’s all the same now. No more boundaries. Something is\ncoming nearer, growing to connect. She lives on air and thinks only of Bata.\nShe will return.\n\nBit by bit the corpse grows whole. Slowly the bones link up, imperceptibly the\nflesh crawls back. One night the face is finished. In the dark is begins to\ntwitch unseen.\n\nStook is out on bail. He is driving a stolen truck, the pickup they used to\nlet him use. All his rage and bitterness is focused on the corpse in the\nstreet. He speeds towards it, past the guards, through the sawhorses. A\nscreech of brakes, a thud. Suddenly his crumpled fender is smooth. The corpse\nwalks off backwards.\n\nStook runs after the skinny corpse, a woman. She minces backwards towards the\nbus stop, glaring at him. He catches up as she climbs into the bus to Buffalo.\nHe tries to grab her, but it’s impossible. He cannot alter her past.\n\nMaisie leaves her room and walks. A block ahead she sees a black and white\nwoman in a christmas-green coat climb off the bus from Bata. She is walking\nbackwards, this woman. Maisie hastens to meet her.\n\n![img](Images/p178_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 177. Maisie Gleaves_.\n\nThe two figures merge and are no more. A cabbie sees them disappear into each\nother. For Maisie it is different. She walks through the flash and down the\nstreet.\n\nEverything is running backwards. Maisie is going back through time, back to\nBata. The bus backs up to where she’d seen herself get out. Ticketless, she\nclimbs in the exit door and sits down. She is nervous. The bus is going forty\nmiles per hour in reverse.\n\nAs the bus backs out of Buffalo onto the Thruway, the man sitting next to\nMaisie begins staring at her. He says something backwards, a drooling gabble.\nShe answers anyway. He turns and stares out the dark window. She spoke because\nhe spoke; he spoke because she spoke. He picks off a wad of gum from under his\nseat and begins chewing it.\n\nWhen the bus leaves the Thruway and backs past the old filling-station, she\nwalks to the door. It opens, and she goes down the steps. Bata. She’s glad she\nwaited so long. She’ll get a room here, and in two years she’ll be back in\nhigh-school. Ron. This time it will work out right.\n\nA short, red-faced man is blocking her way. She sets her face and walks\ntowards him. He backs off, drawing farther and farther away. There are police\naround a pickup parked in the intersection. But there is no traffic.\n\nThe little man scuttles crablike into the cab of the pickup. Just to scare\nhim, she walks right up to it, right up to the fender. There is a sudden jolt.\nThe pickup squeals its brakes and backs away.\n\nThe story was designed as a sort of thought experiment. The idea is that a\nuniverse that has some spacetime patterns other than ordinary cause and effect\nis at least _conceivable_. We cannot very easily imagine a mechanism that\nwould actually make Maisie Gleaves turn a corner in time, but a spacetime that\nhas such a corner is still comprehensible to us. For the rest of this chapter\nI want to discuss the idea that our spacetime may actually have patterns other\nthan those introduced by simple cause and effect.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, people used sometimes to think of the universe as\nbeing like a big clock: _Many, many years ago, God the big watchmaker put the\nwhole thing together, wound it up, and walked off. Given full knowledge of the\nclockwork universe at any time, the whole past and future can be\nextrapolated_. This is really a very limiting and lifeless way of thinking of\nthe world. The one thing that may have made the clockwork universe attractive\nto people is that once God finishes putting it together, you don’t have to\nhave Him hanging around anymore, meddling with your affairs.\n\n![img](Images/p179_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 178. The clockwork universe_.\n\nA great weakness with the clockwork universe viewpoint is that the world does\nnot in fact seem to behave very deterministically. That is to say, a given\ncause does not always produce the same effects. Even if you pull the plunger\nback to the exact same point, two different balls are likely to produce\ntotally different scores on a pinball machine. For many years, advocates of\nthe clockwork universe ascribed such variations to invisibly small motions of\natoms. Underlying the world’s seeming disorder was supposed to be a completely\nlawlike mechanism of bouncing atoms. But with the introduction of quantum\nmechanics in the twentieth century, we have come to regard the behavior of\neven the simplest atom as essentially unpredictable.\n\n![img](Images/p180_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 179. Essentially unpredictable_.\n\nCause and effect still tie together many of the events in our world. But it is\nalso true that many events happen for no real reason at all. If there were a\nGod directing the world’s history, then it would not have been enough for him\nto set up the world billions of years ago and then walk off. He would have to\nwork over all of spacetime, weaving the random blips into a pleasing pattern.\n\nI certainly do not want to put myself in the position of arguing for the\nexistence of some giant humanoid God. The point I am really trying to get at\nis that since the process of cause and effect does not in fact account for all\nthe world’s structure, we might well look for other kinds of patterning. I am\nthinking specifically of the acausal connecting principle known as\n_synchronicity_. What is synchronicity?\n\n[PUZZLE 10.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa1)\n\n_If your were to have complete freedom in moving forward and backward in time,\nthen you could duplicate most of the feats of a hyperbeing who can move_ ana\n_and_ kata _at will. How could you use time travel to enter a sealed room? How\ncould you use it to remove someone’s dinner from his stomach without\ndisturbing him_?\n\n![img](Images/p181_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 180. Synchronicity_.\n\nSynchronicity is not a philosophical view but an empirical concept which\npostulates an intellectually necessary principle. This cannot be called either\nmaterialism or metaphysics …\n\nSynchronicity is no more baffling or mysterious than the discontinuities of\nphysics. It is only the ingrained belief in the sovereign power of causality\nthat creates intellectual difficulties and makes it appear unthinkable that\ncauseless events exist or could ever occur. But if they do, then we must\nregard them as _creative acts_ , as the continuous creation of a pattern that\nexists from all eternity, repeats itself sporadically, and is not derivable\nfrom any known antecedents …\n\nMeaningful coincidences are thinkable as pure chance. But the more they\nmultiply and the greater and more exact the correspondence is, the more their\nprobability sinks and their unthinkability increases, until they can no longer\nbe regarded as pure chance but, for a lack of causal explanation have to be\nthought of as meaningful arrangements.\n\nC. G. JUNG,\n\n_Synchronicity_ , 1952\n\nYou learn a new word, and during the next week you see it in three different\nplaces. You’re thinking of an old high school friend you haven’t seen in\nyears, the phone rings, and it’s your old friend on the line. You go to a\nconvention, hoping to have a discussion with a certain Dr. X … and who should\nbe sitting next to you on the bus in from the airport but Dr. X himself.\n\nMeaningful coincidences. Life is full of them. Where do they come from? What\ndo they mean? Can they be controlled?\n\nC. G. Jung, the great Swiss psychologist, began using the term _synchronicity_\nin 1920, to mean “acausal connection” or “meaningful coincidence.” His\nclearest statement of his ideas about synchronicity is to be found in his\nintroduction to the _I Ching_ , an ancient Chinese book of divination. To\nconsult the _I Ching_ , one flips a group of three coins a total of six times\nto generate a “hexagram,” a pattern of solid and broken lines. There are\nsixty-four possible hexagrams, each of which bears a corresponding name and\npage of advice. The really surprising thing about the / _Ching_ is how often\nthe advice it dispenses is precisely and unambiguously relevant to the\nquestioner’s actual situation.\n\n![img](Images/p182_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 181. The hexagram for “Increase.”_\n\nAn example: a young married couple of my acquaintance were expecting an\nunplanned third child. They decided they could not afford it, and scheduled an\nabortion. Doubts over this course of action set in, and they consulted the _I\nChing_. The reading? “Increase. It furthers one to undertake something. It\nfurthers one to cross the great water.” Heeding this advice, they braved the\nwaters of birth once again, and had their third baby. What made this story\ntruly striking to me was that shortly thereafter Alison Lurie’s novel _The War\nBetween the Tates_ appeared … and this novel contains a description of a\ncouple who go through the same sequence of events.\n\nStatistically, of course, one expects a certain number of remarkable\ncoincidences to occur. If you play roulette long enough, there will come an\nevening when your every bet wins. Usually when I think of someone, he does not\nin fact phone me up … So is the one time that the call _does_ come so very\nsurprising?\n\n![img](Images/p182_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 182. Not all premonitions are correct_.\n\nThere is also a certain amount of self-suggestion present in the observation\nof coincidences. If, for instance, my arm is in a cast, I will be very\nconscious of casts … I will see people in casts everywhere I go. Is this\nsynchronicity, or is it just a simple alteration in the way I am seeing the\nworld?\n\n![img](Images/p183_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 183. You notice people who look like you_.\n\nProbably there were always a lot of people in casts around, but I just didn’t\nnotice them.\n\nYet this last example does seem to contain the germ of an explanation of\nsynchronicity. According to quantum mechanics, reality as we know it is the\nproduct of a mutual interaction between the objective world and the subjective\nobservers. Jung views such interactions as fundamental to synchronicity:\n“Synchronicity takes the coincidence of events in space and time as meaning\nsomething more than mere chance, namely, a peculiar interdependence of\nobjective events among themselves as well as with the subjective (psychic)\nstates of the observer or observers.” Does an individual’s frame of mind\ndetermine what happens to him or her?\n\nThere is a very pretty illustration of synchronicity in Steven Spielberg’s\nfamous movie _E.T_. E.T. (for Extra-Terrestrial) is a pleasant, goblinlike\ncreature who is befriended by a ten-year-old boy named Elliot. E.T. seems to\nhave great psychic powers, and his mind becomes in some way linked to\nElliot’s. At one point, E.T. is watching a romantic adventure on television,\nwhile Elliot is at school fighting with a girl whom he admires. Suddenly the\ntwo images — Elliot-and-girl, hero-and-heroine — take on the same Gestalt, and\njust as the hero kisses the heroine on TV, Elliot kisses the girl in his\nclassroom. Is it that E.T.’s perception of the TV show alters Elliot’s\nreality? Or would it be better to say that Elliot and E.T. are part of a\nlinked system that manifests the same experience in different ways?\n\nThe first way of putting it suggests that E.T. has some sort of “mind ray,”\nwhich, by a chain of cause and effect, alters what is happening in Elliot’s\nclassroom. The second way of looking at the coincidence suggests, rather, that\nthere is some sort of noncausal harmony between the actions of Elliot and E.T.\n\nIn the case of this totally fictional movie, it is, of course, the second view\nthat is correct. The child actor portraying Elliot and the roboticized doll\nrepresenting E.T. have the same “experience” because Steven Spielberg, the\nmovie’s creator, intended them to. He _designed_ the movie so as to contain\nthis particular synchronicity.\n\nMovies and novels very commonly include large numbers of significant\ncoincidences. These synchronistic elements provide a sort of “horizontal”\nstructure complementary to the “vertical” development of the plot. By the same\ntoken, one might think of our world’s synchronicities as a sort of\n“horizontal” spacetime structuring, a structuring that is there for reasons\nthat might be thought of as artistic.\n\n![img](Images/p184_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 184. A common cause_.\n\nLet me make this “horizontal versus vertical” distinction a bit clearer by\nmeans of two spacetime diagrams. In figure 184, we have a spacetime diagram\nrepresenting an object _A_ , which yesterday split into two objects _B_ and\n_C_ , which are now drawing apart from each other. We might, for instance,\ntake _A_ to be an amoeba which splits into two identical amoebas _B_ and _C.\nB_ and _C_ are identical, but this is not an example of synchronicity. The\nsimilar features of _B_ and _C_ can be traced back to a common cause, their\nparent _A_.\n\nFigure 185 illustrates what might be a synchronistic event. Here we have the\ntwo distant objects _B_ and _C_ coincidentally splitting up at the exact same\ntime. _B’s_ split is not the cause of _C_ ’s, and _C_ ’s is not the cause of\n_B_ ’s. They just happen to occur at the same time.\n\n![img](Images/p185_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 185. A coincidence_.\n\nThe point is that cause and effect can be regarded as a sort of “vertical”\npatterning of spacetime, while synchronicity is a “horizontal” patterning of\nspacetime. Cause and effect set up certain branching patterns in time;\nsynchronicity arranges these patterns in step with each other. When both\npatternings are at work, one gets the kind of complex pattern of events\ncharacteristic of life as it is lived.\n\n![img](Images/p185_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 186. Cause-effect_ and _synchronicity_.\n\nIt seems evident that a really first-class universe must include a mixture of\nboth sorts of spacetime patterning. What I am suggesting, in short, is that\nour world contains synchronicity because it is a beautiful and interesting\nworld! But who put all that synchronicity there? Who built in all the deep\nmeaning?\n\nMany would answer that God did it. Indeed, one of the three traditional\ntheological proofs of the existence of God is the “argument from design,”\nwhich reasons that the universe, as a supreme work of art, must have been made\nby some great Artist. But this conclusion is not inescapable. According to the\nquantum-mechanical world view, it is we ourselves who create the world, event\nby event, instant by instant. The universe is, in a sense, a book written by\nits characters, a dream dreamed by its own phantoms.\n\nBut why, then, should the universe exhibit such overall coherence, such\nsynchronicity? Curiously enough, quantum mechanics not only allows for\nsynchronistic events … It _requires_ them. This result, established as\nrecently as the 1970s, has its original inspiration in the so-called Einstein-\nPodolsky-Rosen paradox of 1935.\n\nThe EPR paradox goes as follows. Quantum mechanics predicts that once two\nparticles have been near each other, they continue to instantaneously affect\neach other no matter how widely they may be separated. Now we know from\nEinsteinian relativity that no signals can travel faster than light. Returning\nto figure 185, we can see that there is no way a sudden change in _B_ can\n_cause_ a synchronized change in _C_ (or vice versa), since there is no way\nfor a signal to instantaneously zip from the one to the other. In Einstein’s\nview this was a paradox. _B_ and _C_ act in harmony, even though they cannot\nexchange signals fast enough to causally _organize_ their harmony.\n\nEinstein was, in some ways, a very deterministic thinker. He viewed\nsynchronicity as too miraculous a phenomenon to be built into our physics. He\nsought to escape the conclusions of the EPR paradox by postulating the\nexistence of “hidden variables,” tiny internal clocks, as it were, that would\nbe the hidden cause of _B_ and _C_ ’s simultaneous decay.\n\n[PUZZLE 10.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa2)\n\n_Special relativity says that it is impossible to permanently label any given\nspace location. “Right here last week,” in other words, has no absolute\nmeaning. How would the existence of a time machine go against this\nassumption_?\n\nNow, in the case where _A, B_ , and _C_ are _amoebas_ , such a view is\ncorrect. If _A_ has parented _B_ and _C_ , then the fact that _B_ and _C_\nmature simultaneously is not really synchronistic. Two flowers blooming at the\nsame time is not synchronicity; it is evidence, rather, of a common hidden\ncause: the plants’ common ancestor with its built-in biological clock. The\namoebas _B_ and _C_ mature in concert because they have the same DNA. Einstein\nproposed that even if _B_ and _C_ were things as simple as photons or\nelectrons, then there would still be some internal structure, some “hidden\nvariables,” to account for their synchronistic behavior.\n\n![img](Images/p187_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 187. A hidden common cause._\n\nThese hidden variables cannot be directly observed. But in 1964, physicist\nJohn S. Bell devised a type of experiment that could test for these hidden\nvariables in a statistical way. In the 1970s, physicists at Berkeley, Harvard,\nand other universities carried out a series of such experiments verifying what\nthe quantum physicists had said all along: there are no hidden variables, even\nthough it is true that distant particles can behave in a synchronized way.\n\n![img](Images/p187_2.jpg)\n\n_Faster than light, slower than time._\n\n[PUZZLE 10.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa3)\n\n_Here is a picture illustrating how FTL travel can lead to time travel to\none’s own past. The traveler goes from_ A _to_ B _to_ C, B _being an event on\nthe world line of a distant galaxy that is moving away from Earth at half the\nspeed of light. Explain how the paths_ AB _and_ BC _both can be regarded as\npure FTL trips._\n\nThis result rules out the existence of the sorts of hidden causes that\nEinstein desired. An electron is just what it seems: a completely simple\nparticle with no memory, no internal clock, no “hidden variables.” The fact\nthat two widely separated elementary particles _B_ and _C_ can act in concert\n_has no explanation._\n\nThis, finally, is the essence of synchronicity: the world we live in is filled\nwith harmonies and coincidences that have no explanation in terms of cause and\neffect. It is fruitless to seek after hidden forces and occult powers. The\nworld is a given — it is just as it is, full of cause and effect, full of\nsynchronicity.\n\nSome people have taken these new developments to mean that such psychic feats\nas telepathy and psychokinesis are now firmly established scientific\nrealities. This is not correct. To understand this point, we should make clear\nwhat is meant by telepathy and psychokinesis (PK for short).\n\nThe basic supposition behind these ideas is that if I am a psychic, then by\nthinking a certain way I can change the world around me. In the case of\ntelepathy, I am to transmit my thoughts to other people; in the case of PK, I\nam to make objects move.\n\nA very obvious fact — which is somehow overlooked in most discussions of\npsychic phenomena — is that, in a sense, we all have telepathy and PK. I have\nsome thoughts in my head, I go talk to you, and then you have the same\nthoughts! I want certain words to appear on my typing paper, I will my fingers\nto move, and the words appear! I want my body to move into the next room, I\nmove my legs, and my body is in the next room! There is a sense in which these\nare all rather amazing phenomena. Who needs telepathy when we have telephones?\nWhy wish for PK when you have hands? What makes teleportation so much better\nthan airplanes?\n\n[PUZZLE 10.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa4)\n\n_Not only does FTL travel lead to time travel; the converse is true as well.\nTime travel leads to FTL travel. Given a rocket and a time machine, how could\nyou send a probe all the way around the galaxy, yet have it get back the same\nday_?\n\nBut of course people would like to have more. A somewhat outdated paradigm for\npsychic phenomena is that our brains can generate some mysterious rays that go\nout and change the world around us. But even if there were such rays, would\nthey be so different from radio waves? Mind rays would, in the last analysis,\nstill be susceptible to classical scientific analysis — and the feeling is\nthat psychic phenomena, if they exist, should somehow lie outside normal\nscience.\n\n![img](Images/p189_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 188. The CIA has funded research for “psychotronic warfare.”_\n\nNo, I think that what people really expect from psychic phenomena is an\nability to instantaneously affect external objects without any kind of cause-\nand-effect mediation at all. The wizard clenches his face, and on the other\nside of the galaxy a star goes supernova. Psychic phenomena are supposed to\nact faster than light, horizontally across spacetime.\n\n[PUZZLE 10.5](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa5)\n\n_If time itself were bent into a vast circle, then one might hope to reach the\npast by traveling “around” time. But thinking about a universe in which time\nis a vast circle leads to some strange problems. Say, for instance, that you\nbuild a very durable radio beacon and set it afloat in space near the Earth.\nIs it possible that this beacon can last all the way around time? If it does,\nthen once you set one afloat, how many more should you be able to detect? What\nif you decide to set your beacon afloat if and only if you detect no beacons\nout there before the launch_?\n\nNow, the new quantum experiments have established that — at least at the level\nof individual particles — there are significant and acausal cross-correlations\nbetween certain sequences of events. A typical experiment of this kind might\nconsist of an energy source and two particle detectors at opposite ends of the\nlaboratory. Each of the detectors prints out a random sequence of “yes or no”\nmeasurements. Although each sequence, taken by itself, seems random and\nmeaningless, the experimenter finds that, taken together, the two sequences\nshow a remarkable degree of similarity.\n\nBut this does not mean that one set of measurements is determining the other\nset. Two disparate regions of the universe may sometimes be in a kind of\nfaster-than-light harmony, but it is meaningless to say that the events in one\nregion are _causing_ the events in the other region.\n\nThe great difference between synchronicity and telepathy is that we do not\nexpect to be able to _control_ synchronicity. The wizard’s face clench and the\nstar’s explosion may happen at the same time — but it is foolish to say the\nstar made the wizard grimace, as it would be to say that the wizard made the\nstar explode. Synchronicity just happens.\n\nLet’s imagine a synchronicity at the human level. Say that Bob and Donna are\nlovers driven apart by the decrees of fate. They think of each other often,\nand still exchange letters for the first month or two. One week Bob happens to\nget out his old copy of Tom Wolfe’s _Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_ While\nreading it, he happens to hear a radio playing “Magic Man,” by Heart. So far,\nso what. Bob is just randomly entertaining himself.\n\nThe next week Bob gets a letter from Donna: “ _By the way, have you ever heard\nof ‘Magic Man’ by Heart? You fit the bill. This week I read a book called\n‘Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.’ Do you know it? There’s a girl in there called\n‘Mountain Girl.’ Sometimes she and Kesey would talk for hours; he understood\nher better than anyone else; when I read that I thought of you & me.”_\n\n[PUZZLE 10.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa6)\n\n_We discussed a number of paradoxes that arise from an ability to travel to\nthe past. But just being able to_ communicate _with the past leads to\nparadoxes as well. Suppose, for instance, that I have a magic telephone with\nthe following properties: Whenever I pick up the receiver and dial “1,” the\nmagic telephone rings an hour earlier. 1 am thus able to telephone my past\nself. If I happen to hear the phone ringing, and pick up the receiver, I can\nexpect to hear the voice of my future self. But now, what if at 9:00 I decide\nI will dial “1” at 11:00 unless I have received a call at 10:00_?\n\n![img](Images/p191_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 189. Bob and Donna._\n\nWhat is poor Bob to think? Is Donna reading his mind? Are his actions\ncontrolling Donna’s? No. Each of them is living out the random events of their\nlives. Yet these lives were once so close that there is still a degree of\ncorrelation between them.\n\nThis is a first-class universe we’re in. It’s loaded with symbolic events,\ndeep meanings, and heavy coincidences. There are events that, for want of a\nbetter word, some people call telepathy. But there _is_ a better word: the\nword is _synchronicity._ “Telepathy” suggests the idea of being able to exert\ncontrol over coincidences. But surely the rough and tumble of life has taught\nall of us that any hope of full control is chimerical. Telepathy is a paranoid\nfantasy; synchronicity is a fact of life. As one 1960s slogan put it: “We\ndon’t have to get it together. It _is_ together.”\n\n\n## 11\n\n## What Is Reality?\n\nSTARTING with no preconceptions at all, what is the most reasonable model of\nthe world that we can build up?\n\nOnly two things seem really certain: one exists, and one has perceptions. I\nmay be a meat machine, a soul, an eye of God, a collection of ideas, or who\nknows what — but I am certain that I exist. I am the thing that writes these\nwords. Of course, _you_ may doubt whether I am real — perhaps you are only\ndreaming that you read this book — but you do know for certain that you\nyourself exist.\n\nThe fact that one has experiences is equally certain; to put it more\nneutrally, one cannot doubt that perceptions occur. In classical physics, one\nassumes that the perceptions are caused by objects in three-dimensional space;\nbut, if you think about it, that is really quite an artificial assumption.\n\n![img](Images/p192_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 190. What is reality_?\n\nI do not perceive the world as stable objects, all equally present at all\ntimes. The world of immediate perceptions is all bits and pieces, rags and\ntags. The hiss of the radiator, a bad taste in my mouth, an ache in my hip,\nthe red color of my typewriter, the clack of typing, the sky’s pearl-gray\nglow, my glasses resting on my nose, rain dripping through the ceiling in the\nnext room, birds in the sky, a car’s tires on the street outside, the titles\non my bookcase — this and that, now and again, a stew of perceptions, and\nstable reality is a mere construct! Concentrating now on my line of reasoning,\nI lose all awareness of the sky, rain, and cars; is it not reasonable to say\nthat for this moment they cease to exist? Must an individual be like Atlas,\nwho carries the whole world on his back?\n\n![img](Images/p193_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 191. Immediate perceptions._\n\nThe Irish philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753) advocated an idealistic\nphilosophy called _immaterialism._ No one has written more eloquently on\nBerkeley than Borges does in his essay “A New Refutation of Time.”\n\nBerkeley denied the existence of matter. This does not mean, one should note,\nthat he denied the existence of colors, odors, tastes, sounds and tactile\nsensations; what he denied was that, aside from these perceptions, which make\nup the external world, there was anything invisible, intangible, called\nmatter. He denied that there were pains that no one feels, colors that no one\nsees, forms that no one touches. He reasoned that to add matter to our\nperceptions is to add an inconceivable, superfluous world to the world. He\nbelieved in the world of appearances woven by our senses, but understood that\nthe material world is an illusory duplication.\n\n![img](Images/p193_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 192. \"No elementary phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed\nphenomenon.”_\n\nIt is surprising to learn that such a seemingly perverse world view is\nembraced by modern physicists. In the words of John Wheeler, one of the grand\nold men of physics, “No elementary phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an\nobserved phenomenon.” By this, Wheeler means that the rise of quantum\nmechanics has demolished the view that the universe sits “out there” while we\nsit back and observe it. The kinds of questions one asks — and the order one\nasks them in — has a profound influence on the answers one gets, and on the\nworld view one builds up.\n\nWhat I would like to do now is build up a model of reality based on the notion\nthat all that exists is the perceptions of various observers. The “three space\nplus one time dimension” story is just one particular framework for organizing\nour sensations. We can — and do — equally well order our thoughts and\nimpressions according to many other systems. Thoughts and memories having to\ndo with “food” fall into one area, for instance, and these food thoughts are\nin turn organized according to various kinds of criteria. There are the good-\nfood/bad-food axis, the sweet/salty axis, the raw/cooked, mine/not-mine, home-\nmade/purchased, cold/hot, red/green, and endlessly many other axes.\n\nBut you say, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine trees, for\ninstance, in a park or books existing in a closet, and no body by to perceive\nthem. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: but what is all\nthis, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you\ncall _books_ and _trees_ and at the same time omitting to frame the idea of\nany one that may perceive them? But do you not you yourself perceive or think\nof them all the while? This therefore is nothing to the purpose: it only shows\nyou have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind; but it doth not\nshew that you can conceive it possible, the objects of your thought may exist\nwithout the mind …\n\nGEORGE BERKELEY,\n\n_A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,_ 1710\n\nWhat I am suggesting is that if we take sensations and thoughts as primary,\nthen there is no reason to limit the “dimensions” of the world to the space\nand time dimensions involved in the motions of inanimate objects. Part and\nparcel of every object you see is what the object reminds you of, how you feel\nabout it, what you know about its past, and so on. If we make an honest effort\nto describe the world as we actually live it, then the world grows endlessly\nmore complicated than any simple 3-D picture. There is a feeling that the more\nwe delve into the nature of reality, the more we will find. Far from being\nlimited, the world is inexhaustibly rich.\n\nWe are used to taking left/right, forward/backward, up/down, past/future, and\n— perhaps — _ana/kata_ to be the only possible dimensions. But why shouldn’t\ncold/hot, nice/nasty, pretty/ugly, and all other distinctions have equal claim\nto being dimensions of reality? It is, after all, not enough to just tell a\nperson where and when a given object is. One wants also to know if it is red,\nif it is good to eat, how much it costs, who else sees it, how much it weighs,\nand so on.\n\n![img](Images/p194_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 193. Patterns of atoms._\n\nThe traditional approach of science has been to explain sensory phenomena,\nsuch as color and warmth, in terms of the spacetime patterns of atoms. But who\nhas ever really seen an atom? At best one might see some kind of electron-\nmicroscope photograph of a grainy dot. And one’s _experience_ of seeing such a\nphotograph is in fact a collection of sensory phenomena, involving color,\nbrightness, and so on. Matter may explain our perceptions, but it is our\nperceptions that tell us about matter.\n\nI propose that we stop trying to explain our mental experiences in terms of\ninvisibly tiny objects arranged in patterns in 3-D space. Instead let us take\nour actual thoughts and sensations as the truly fundamental entities. Think of\na “dimension” as being any possible type of variation, category, or\ndistinction. For each question you might ask about an object, there is a range\nof possible answers; we take each of these ranges to be an axis in the _true_\n“space” underlying our perceptions.\n\nWhat shall we call this space? _Fact-space_ sounds good. An entity of any kind\nis a glob in fact-space. To the extent that an entity’s position on some axis\nis precisely given, the corresponding glob will have a narrow cross section in\nthe direction of that axis. If an entity’s properties are vague or\nindeterminate, then its glob will be hazy and spread-out. The world — the\ncollection of all thoughts and objects — is a pattern spread out through fact-\nspace.\n\n![img](Images/p195_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 194. One-dimensional fact-space._\n\nWhat is the pattern like? It will be helpful here to look at a lower-\ndimensional example. Imagine a Lineland inhabited by two Dots. Suppose for now\nthat the Dots are at rest on their line of space, and suppose that they are so\nsimple that all there is to know about any given Dot is its position. If we\nimagine looking at this Lineland from the outside, then it has a fact-space\nthat is simply a line with two Dots on it. If for some reason the exact\npositions of the Dots are uncertain, then the globs representing their\npositions will be smeared out. In thinking of the smeared images, it is\nhelpful to think of spots of light: take the smeared image to be a patch of\nlight that is brighter at the center and shaded off at the edges.\n\nThere are, in practice, no really distinct boundaries between things. In terms\nof our model, this can be represented by supposing that no point between _A_\nand _B_ is _totally_ dark: the whole line is slightly lit, but as it has two\nparticularly bright regions we say there are two distinct Dots.\n\nIf we suppose that the Dots have some properties other than position, then the\nfact-space takes on more dimensions. If we suppose, for instance, that the\nDots can be at different temperatures and in different moods, then we get\nsomething like figure 195. Looking at it, we see that _A_ is to the east of\n_B,_ and that _B,_ though colder than A, is in a better mood. Note also that\nthe uncertainty about the Dots’ exact mood is greater than the uncertainty\nabout their temperature. But hold it; _whose_ uncertainty am I talking about?\n\n![img](Images/p196_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 195. Three-dimensional fact-space._\n\nYou recall how it goes — one of the after-dinner party sent out of the living\nroom, the others agreeing on a word, the one fated to be questioner returning\nand starting his questions. “Is it a living object?” “No.” “Is it here on\nearth?” “Yes.” So the questions go from respondent to respondent around the\nroom until at length the word emerges: victory if in twenty tries or less;\notherwise, defeat.\n\nThen comes the moment when we are fourth to be sent from the room. We are\nlocked out unbelievably long. On finally being readmitted, we find a smile on\neveryone’s face, sign of a joke or a plot. We innocently start our questions.\nAt first the answers come quickly. Then each question begins to take longer in\nthe answering — strange when the answer itself is only a simple “Yes” or “No.”\nAt length, feeling hot on the trail, we ask, “Is the word ‘cloud’?” “Yes,”\ncomes the reply, and everyone bursts out laughing. When we were out of the\nroom, they explain, they had agreed not to agree in advance on any word at\nall. Each one around the circle could respond “yes” or “no” as he pleased to\nwhatever question we put to him. But however he replied he had to have a word\nin mind compatible with his own reply — and with all the replies that went\nbefore …\n\nIn the real world of quantum physics, _no elementary phenomenon is a\nphenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon._ In the surprise version of the\ngame no word is a word until that word is promoted to reality by the choice of\nquestions asked and answers given. “Cloud” sitting there waiting to be found\nas we entered the room? Pure delusion!\n\nJOHN A. WHEELER,\n\n“Frontiers of Time,” 1980\n\nThis is an important point. A fact-space like figure 195 is drawn as if some\nobserver is standing outside the Dots’ universe and measuring the Dots’\nproperties. But this kind of attitude is not going to work if we want to talk\nabout the actual world we live in. _We cannot observe our world from the\noutside._ If we take the “world” to be everything that exists, then there can\nbe no outside observer!\n\nSuppose we drop any notion of observing the Dots from the outside, and assume\nthat the only real facts in Lineland involve _what the Dots know._ Assume\nagain that the only property the Dots have is position. In this case the fact-\nspace will have two axes: one axis for where _A_ thinks the two Dots are, and\none axis for where _B_ thinks the two Dots are. If there were ten Dots, we\nwould need ten axes, one for each Dot’s opinion of the positions.\n\nIn figure 196 I have drawn the fact-space for two Dots, _A_ and _B,_ who\nnotice their mutual positions. The lower patch represents _A,_ and the other\npatch represents _B._ If we drop down vertically from the _A_ -patch we get a\nnarrowly defined location on the position-according-to-A axis. _A_ knows quite\nwell where _A_ is. Notice, however, that _A_ does not have a very good idea\nwhere _B_ is. Studying the diagram further, we can see that _B_ is a less\n“self-centered” Dot than _A_ is. That is to say, if we run across horizontally\nfrom the _A_ -patch and the _B_ -patch, we find that _B_ knows both Dots’\npositions with equal accuracy.\n\n![img](Images/p197_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 196. Self-generated fact-space._\n\nIt is interesting to note that the quality of A’s “self-centeredness” is not\nsomething to be found just by looking at the _A_ -patch. We notice this\nquality only by looking at the whole pattern in fact-space. What, by the way,\nshall we call a pattern in fact-space? Suppose we call it a _world state_ ,\n“state” being used here in the sense of “state of being” or “state of\nconsciousness.” Rephrasing the point just made, we might say that properties\nof an individual are bound up in the overall pattern of the world state.\n\n![img](Images/p197_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 197. A has no idea where_ B _is._\n\nThese ambiguities, redundancies, and deficiencies recall those attributed by\nDr. Franz Kuhn to a certain Chinese encyclopedia entitled _Celestial Emporium\nof Benevolent Knowledge._ On those remote pages it is written that animals are\ndivided into (a) those that belong to the emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c)\nthose that are trained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fabulous ones,\n(g) stray dogs, (h) those that are included in this classification, (i) those\nthat tremble as if they were mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a\nvery fine camel’s hair brush, (1) others, (m) those that have just broken a\nflower vase, (n) those that resemble flies from a distance.\n\nJORGE LUIS BORGES,\n\n“The Analytical Language of John Wilkins,” 1941\n\nIf Dot _A_ were to focus so entirely on its own location as to lose all sight\nof _B,_ we would get a world state as shown in figure 197. For any individual\nat any given time, most of the world is going to be unknown or indeterminate,\nas _B_ is relative to _A_ here. Note, however, that the indeterminacy of _B_\nrelative to _A_ is still compatible with _B’s_ having a good knowledge of\nwhere _B_ and _A_ are.\n\nIt is worth noting here that this kind of model resolves one of the seeming\nparadoxes of immaterialism. Two people, let us say, are standing in a field. A\nrabbit runs past. One of the people sees the rabbit, the other doesn’t. For\nthe first person the rabbit has definite existence; for the second person the\nrabbit does not exist. How can one and the same rabbit both exist and not\nexist? In our fact-space model there is no problem. The glob representing the\nrabbit is shaped so as to have a sharp projection on one person’s axis, and a\nfuzzed-out projection on the other person’s axis.\n\nReturning to our Lineland fact-space, note that if we were to add the\nproperties of “temperature” and “mood” as before, then we would need a total\nof six axes: three axes for _A_ ’s ideas about position, temperature, and\nmood; and three axes for _B_ ’s opinions. In general, a world with _P_\ndistinct properties and _I_ distinct individuals will have _P_ -times-_I_ axes\nin its full fact-space. The state of the world can be thought of as a pattern\nof more or less distinct globs in a fact-space of very many dimensions.\n\n![img](Images/p198_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 198. A great number of individuals._\n\nAs the various individuals interact with each other, their knowledge about\neach other changes. The globs of light shift and merge, thicken and attenuate.\nWe can think of the pattern as changing with the passage of time —\nalternatively, we can take each individual’s time peception as an axis and\nhave time change frozen right into the world state.\n\nSo far I have not discussed the issue of what kinds of things in our world are\ngoing to count as individuals. Just people? People and animals? People,\nanimals, and plants? People, animals, plants, and robots? Should we include\ngalaxies and rocks? Since we’re going to get an unmanageably large collection\nanyway, my inclination is to be generous about this. I’m prepared to go ahead\nand let anything you like be an individual capable of certain kinds of\n“knowledge.” A rock in a field doesn’t know much, but it does know that\nthere’s something massive (the Earth) right under it. We can tell that it\n“knows” since if you lift it and let go, it falls right back down! Putting it\na little more seriously, any given object, animate or not, “knows” or embodies\ninformation about a number of other objects.\n\n[PUZZLE 11.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch11pa1)\n\n_Suppose that space and time are really just mental constructs. In general the\nonly reason we have for saying that one state of mind_ B _comes after another\nstate of mind_ A _is that_ B _includes a memory of state_ A, _but_ A _does not\ninclude a memory of state_ B. _Under this definition of “before and after,”\nwould a person’s perceptions necessarily fit into a linear time sequence_?\n\nThis viewpoint — that everything is in some sense alive or conscious — has\nhistorically been known as hylozoism, or panpsychism. It is, of course, a\nviewpoint that is easy to ridicule. Can a garbage can feel love? Does a shoe\nthink about mathematics? But the point is not that we are to think of objects\nas being “like people.” The point is only that we might perhaps think of\nobjects as integrative centers in fact-space, existing entities in the same\nsense that we are existing patterns ourselves.\n\nSo there are to be a great number of individuals in fact-space. And how many\npossible properties might there be? There really seems to be no end to the\nnumber of properties individuals might be sensitive to. If you start asking\nquestions about some individual object, it seems as though you might really\nkeep on asking questions forever. So if fact-space is to have as many\ndimensions as the number of individuals _times_ the number of properties, I\nthink we may as well go ahead and say that fact-space is probably infinite-\ndimensional. Our world is a pattern in an infinite-dimensional, or “∞-D,”\nspace.\n\n![img](Images/p199_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 199. The world is like a game of “Infinity Questions” — there’s no end\nto the number of questions you can ask._\n\nWe are equal beings and the universe is our relations with each other. The\nuniverse is made of one kind of entity: each one is alive, each determines the\ncourse of his own existence.\n\nThe universe is made of one kind of whatever-it-is, which cannot be defined.\nFor our purpose, it isn’t necessary to try to define it. All we need to do is\nassume that there is only _one kind_ of whatever-it-is, and see if it leads to\na reasonable explanation for the world as we know it.\n\nThe basic function of each being is expanding and contracting. Expanded beings\nare permeative; contracted beings are dense and impermeative. Therefore each\nof us, alone or in combination, may appear as space, energy, or mass,\ndepending on the ratio of expansion to contraction chosen, and what kind of\nvibrations each of us expresses by alternating expansion and contraction. Each\nbeing controls his own vibrations.\n\nA completely expanded being is space … When a being is totally contracted, he\nis a mass particle, completely imploded … When a being is alternating\nexpansion and contraction, he is energy … The universe is an infinite harmony\nof vibrating beings in an elaborate range of expansion-contraction ratios,\nfrequency modulations, and so forth.\n\nWhat we need to remember is that there is nobody here but us chickens. The\nentire universe is made up of beings just like ourselves.\n\nTHADDEUS GOLAS,\n\n_The Lazy Man’s Guide to Enlightenment,_ 1972\n\n![img](Images/p200_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 200. Turtles all the way down._\n\nThe notion of ∞-D space is not something I just made up. The hyperspace\nphilosophers of the late nineteenth century were well aware that the notion of\nhigher dimensions leads to an infinite regress: Earth’s 2-D surface is part of\nour 3-D universe. Our 3-D universe may well be the hypersurface of a 4-D\nhypersphere. Our 4-D hypersphere is a cross section of a 5-D curved spacetime\npattern. Our 5-D curved spacetime is perhaps only a layer in a 6-D stack of\nalternate space-times. The 6-D stack may itself be warped and twisted in 7-D\nspace; various versions of the stack may nestle together in 8-D space. Perhaps\nthe whole 8-D space can be thought of as evolving along a nine-dimensional\naxis of supertime. And so on. Where can it stop? Only at infinity.\n\nHinton compared this to the kind of regress that arises if someone says the\nworld rests on the back of a tortoise. What does the tortoise stand on?\nAnother tortoise, which stands on another, which stands on another, ad\ninfinitum. The theologian Arthur Willink found such an infinite regress of\nspaces exhilarating, and in his 1893 work _The World of the Unseen,_ he argues\nthat God lives in the ultimate ∞-D space:\n\nIt is necessary to go farther, and to recognize a very wide extension of the\nidea of Higher Space, which is by no means exhausted when we have reached the\nconception of Space of Four Dimensions … When we have recognized the existence\nof Space of Four Dimensions there is no greater strain called for in the\nrecognition of the existence of Space of Five Dimensions, and so on up to\nSpace of an infinite number of Dimensions.\n\n[PUZZLE 11.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch11pa2)\n\n_The British writer J. W. Dunne felt that our dreams are made up of\nimpressions taken equally from past and future. He claims in his 1927_ An\nExperiment with Time _that the dreaming mind is able to rise up out of\nspacetime and see what lies ahead. This seems to lead to a sort of paradox:\nSuppose that I am to catch a plane Tuesday, and that, unknown to me, the plane\nis going to crash. Monday night, my dreaming mind sees into the future, and I\nhave a horribly vivid dream of dying in a plane crash. Tuesday morning I am so\nbadly shaken that I decide to postpone the trip. Tuesday evening, I watch the\nnews and see that my intended plane did indeed crash, killing all aboard. The\nparadox is this: Since I did not in fact experience the plane crash, how could\nI have seen it as part of my future? Dunne’s way out of this hinges on his\nclaim that there is a_ second dimension of time. _Can you fill in the details\nof his argument_?\n\n… And though it is impossible even to begin to imagine what the appearance of\na material object in our Space may be to an observer in a much Higher Space,\nstill it is evident that to him is presented a still more infinitely perfect\nview of its constituents than to an observer in any Lower region of Space.\nWhile to an eye in the Highest Space of all, an infinitely perfect revealing\nof the most hidden and secret things is of necessity presented.\n\nThis emphasizes very strongly what has been said about the Omniscience of God.\nFor he, dwelling in the Highest Space of all, not only has this perfect view\nof all the constituents of our being, but also is most infinitely near to\nevery point and particle of our whole constitution. So that in the most\nstrictly physical sense it is true that in Him we live and move and have our\nbeing.\n\nThis is a very interesting passage, certainly one of the first philosophical\nuses of ∞-D space. A somewhat similar passage can be found in an 1886 essay,\n“On the Various Standpoints with Respect to Actual Infinity,” by the German\nmathematician Georg Cantor:\n\nThe fear of infinity is a form of myopia that destroys the possibility of\nseeing the actual infinite, even though it in its highest form has created and\nsustains us, and in its secondary transfinite forms occurs all around us and\neven inhabits our minds.\n\nIt was Georg Cantor who first developed a mathematically rigorous treatment of\ninfinity. Before Cantor, many mathematicians and philosophers had feared that\ninfinity is basically a contradictory notion — but after Cantor, scientists\nwere able to begin using infinities quite casually.\n\nEarly in the 1900s, mathematician David Hilbert drew on Cantor’s work to\ndevelop a theory of infinite-dimensional spaces — spaces like the fact-space\nwe have been talking about. Just as a point in a 3-D space can be\nmathematically represented by an ordered sequence of _three_ coordinate\nnumbers, a point in an ∞-D space is represented as an _infinite_ sequence of\nnumbers. There are various ways of going on to define things like angles and\ndistances in these ∞-D spaces; the most commonly used type of mathematical ∞-D\nspace is known as Hilbert space.\n\n[PUZZLE 11.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch11pa3)\n\n_According to quantum mechanics, if you don’t keep an eye on a person, he or\nshe soon becomes indeterminate for you: you no longer know what the other\nperson is like. Yet if you ask the person questions, you will find him or her\nto have definite characteristics. Is there a contradiction here_?\n\nHow can I express the final Teachings to which A Sphere led me? In my\nanguished fear of Death I begged him for some lasting Vision, some higher\nTruth to help me through the End.\n\nSPHERE: It is difficult, oh Square. Before the Absolute we are both as\nShadows. Space and Spacetime are but Fancies. Only in the Author is there\nfinal knowledge.\n\nI: Where is the Author?\n\nSPHERE: He is all around us, He is the mazy dark in which our patterns play.\nAnd even He is but a pattern in the unspeakable All.\n\nI no longer knew whether I woke or slumbered. The Sphere’s voice faded away,\nand all was confusion. I felt myself as but a Thought, a baseless fragment of\nsome recurrent Dream. All around me I sensed my Dreamer’s mind. Mustering my\ncourage I cried out my plaint.\n\nI: Can you hear me, my Lord?\n\nDREAMER: And how! What time is it?\n\nI: There is no Time — so says the Sphere.\n\nDREAMER: Well, yeah. Not for you, anyway.\n\nI: Return me to my fellows, oh my Author. Grant that the Hexagon forgives me.\n\nDREAMER: I can do that. And thanks, I’ve enjoyed being with you. I hate to say\ngood-bye.\n\nI: But surely you will always be with me? Is not my World a fragment of your\nMind?\n\nDREAMER: It’s not _my_ mind, really. I’m just filling in. Who knows who’ll\ndream you next. You’re the real immortal, Square, not me. You’re an eternal\nForm.\n\nFor an instant I could see it All: the boundless Truth, the many Dreamers, and\nmy own life’s passionate play. And then I woke.\n\nMy father and A Hexagon were there with a policeman. The situation was\ndangerous, but so filled was I with Truth and Love that all was soon resolved.\nThe four of us are fast friends to this day.\n\nA SQUARE,\n\n_The Further Adventures of A Square,_ 1984\n\nFor a decade or so, the work on Hilbert spaces seemed to be simply another\nexample of mathematicians pursuing abstraction for abstraction’s sake. But in\nthe 1920s, physicists Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger discovered that\nthe best way of interpreting quantum mechanics is to say that _particles are\npatterns in_ ∞ _-D Hilbert space._\n\nSince that time, mathematicians and physicists have developed an elaborate\nquantum-mechanical theory of the world as a pattern in an ∞-D Hilbert space.\nOne of the great problems with this theory has been to find some actual\nsignificance for the ∞-D space involved. When classical physics presents us\nwith equations involving four variables, we are able to understand these\nequations as being about the three space dimensions plus the one time\ndimension. But the mathematics of quantum mechanics seems somehow to have\ndeveloped in the absence of any good underlying picture. There is no doubt\nthat the quantum theory as it stands makes correct predictions about definite\nexperiments. But no one seems to have a good feeling for what Hilbert space\nreally means.\n\nIn describing our world of perceptions as a pattern in ∞-D fact-space, I have\nbeen trying to give the notion of ∞-D space some real content. The notion of\nfact-space is, in many ways, modeled on the quantum-mechanical Hilbert space.\nGiven the protean nature of infinity, I would not be surprised to learn that\nthe two spaces are really the same. It is important here to realize that the\nparticular axes one lays down in a given space are quite arbitrary. Although a\nCalifornian and a New Yorker live in the same space, the directions they call\n“up” are slightly different. Space is given in itself, and without axes. Once\nwe build up the world as a pattern in ∞-D fact-space, it could be that a\nsimple redrawing of the axes would lead to the Hilbert space model. The\nimportant thing to remember is that the axes have no objective existence at\nall.\n\nWhat is reality?\n\nTake all your perceptions and all of mine, take everyone’s thoughts and all\nthe visions. In an infinite-dimensional space there is room to fit them all\ntogether; each is a piece of the infinite-dimensional One, and this One is\nreality.\n\nReality is indescribably rich and complex. Sometimes I forget this, and life\ngoes gray. But the world is alive, and we are living parts of it. Thoughts are\nas real and important as objects. Every object is an endless source of wonder.\n\nWe don’t know why we’re here — we don’t even know what we _are._ But we exist,\nand the world is going on. Our ordinary notions of space and time are just a\nconvenient fiction. Higher dimensions are everywhere. There’s no need to work\nfor enlightenment; enlightenment is here and now, as close as the fourth\ndimension.\n\n\n## Puzzle Answers\n\n[ANSWER 1.1](09_Chapter1.html#ch_1pa_1)\n\nIf the two car shapes are of different _size,_ then they can move past each\nother. The third dimension of distance-from-the-window is, in terms of images,\nrepresented by size. For the two-dimensional shapes moving in the window\nglass, size is a higher dimension. Imagine living in a three-dimensional\nanalogue of such a world: you would be able to change your size at will, and\nyou would be able to move “through” people of different sizes.\n\n[ANSWER 2.1](10_Chapter2.html#ch_2pa_1)\n\n![img](Images/p204_1.jpg)\n\n_Self-gripping gut._\n\nOne way to keep poor A Square from going to pieces would be to have the type\nof gut depicted here.

The globs would be very thin and would feel solid to\nthe touch.\n\n[ANSWER 3.2](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_2)\n\n![img](Images/p205_1.jpg)\n\n_A Square scanning Flatland._\n\nA Square’s retina is a line segment designed to take in light from the plane\nof A Square’s body. Now it seems that, looking down at Flatland from the third\ndimension, A Square would really see just those objects of Flatland that\nintersect the plane of his vision. The situation would be exactly like that of\na Flatlander in a perpendicular world, as described in puzzle 3.1.\n\nNow if A Square rocks back and forth, he can scan the various cross sections\nof Flatland and then mentally combine these sections to get a full 2-D image.\nBy the same token, if you were in 4-D space looking at our world, you would\nsee various planar cross sections of our world. With some effort, you would be\nable to combine these sections into a full 3-D image of everything, inside and\nout.\n\n[ANSWER 3.3](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_3)\n\n![img](Images/p205_2.jpg)\n\nIt is pretty easy to see that the number of corners will double each time we\ngo up a dimension. But what about the other entries? How, without actually\ncounting the lines in figure 34, do we know that the hypercube has 32 edges?\nThe idea is that a hypercube is gotten by starting with a cube in initial\nposition, moving the cube one unit _ana,_ and then having the cube in final\nposition. The initial and final cube each contribute 12 edges, and the cube’s\neight corners each trace out an edge during the _ana_ motion. 12 + 8 + 12 =\n32. Similar reasoning will justify the remaining entries.\n\n[ANSWER 3.4](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_4)\n\nThe very bottom face must join up with the very top face, and the side faces\non the bottom cube connect to the four open faces of the main part.

(Answer 3.4)_\n\n[ANSWER 3.5](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_5)\n\nThe formula is S4, and the specific hypercube mentioned would have a\nhypervolume of 16 hypercubic feet.\n\nThe Greeks thought of numbers as specific geometrical magnitudes. For a given\nlength _S, S_ 2 stood for a certain square’s area, and _S_ 3 stood for the\nvolume of a certain cube. Since they had no notion of a fourth dimension, they\ndid almost no work with formulas or equations involving powers higher than 3.\nOnly after the Renaissance did mathematicians feel confident enough of their\nalgebra to work with higher-degree equations in a formal way.\n\n![img](Images/p206_2.jpg)\n\n_The pentahedroid.

These five points are the corners of a so-\ncalled pentahedroid.\n\nIn looking at this picture, we are to imagine that the central point is\nactually a bit further away in the fourth dimension, so that all the edges are\nreally of equal length.\n\nJust as a triangle is made up of three segments, and the tetrahedron is made\nof four triangles, the pentahedroid is made of five tetrahedra. Can you see\nall five?\n\n[ANSWER 4.1](12_Chapter4.html#ch_4pa_1)\n\nIn cross section, a cube can appear to be a square, a triangle, a rectangle,\nor a hexagon.

At\nfirst it is a little hard to get, but the idea is that if you let the folded\n“staircase” reverse back and forth, the bug will alternate between being\nvisible on the floor in front of Kilroy, or being hidden on the ceiling of the\nspace behind Kilroy. The illusion is particularly interesting as it raises the\nidea that Kilroy’s objective reality is not fixed at all.

And a line won’t stay knotted in 4-D space\nbecause, as is discussed in [chapter 5](13_Chapter5.html), the extra degree of\nfreedom will cause any knot to slip through itself. Moving everything up a\ndimension, we expect that a plane can be knotted in 4-D space, but not in 3-D\nor in 5-D. How do you get a knotted plane? The idea is to start with a knotted\nline, and then imagine moving the knotted line _ana_ out of space. The trail\nthe line traces out will be a knotted plane. The plane, it is important to\nrealize, is knotted, _but does not intersect itself._ Of course, if we move\nthe knot in 3-D space, the trail does intersect itself, but since _ana_ is\nperpendicular to every space direction, the 4-D trail will not come back on\nitself anywhere.\n\n[ANSWER 6.1](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_1)\n\nThe turned-over Astrian would have his or her vibrator uselessly sticking up\naway from space. Such a person might seem to be without atmosphere or\nsensitivity, a zombie, a man without qualities, a burnt-out case. Is it\ninteresting here to recall that some early thinkers, including Rene Descartes,\nthought that the pineal gland, located in the brain’s center, might serve as a\nsort of third eye that perceives other people’s auras or astral vibrations.\n\n[ANSWER 6.2](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_2)\n\nIf an Astrian could dig his little 3-D thorn into underlying space hard\nenough, then he could oppose a force of gravity pulling him across space. In\nCharles H. Hinton’s 1907 novel, _An Episode of Flatland,_ this is exactly what\nthe Astrians do:\n\nJust as the captain of a ship has an activity independent of the ship, so our\nsouls have an activity independent of the body. Our souls can act on the\nalongside being [the aether] …\n\nIf, filling my mind with devotion, I think of myself as soaring, as rising\nlike an angel through the air, my soul does that which would make me rise,\naltering my direction by acting on the alongside being.\n\nIf all men were to have the same thoughts, then all of them would tend to\nrise, and the united force would be very great, enough to influence the course\nof the earth in its orbit.\n\n[ANSWER 6.3](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_3)\n\n![img](Images/p208_1.jpg)\n\n_A Square executes a dangerous maneuver._\n\nCube snipped the piece of space containing A Square and turned the piece over.\nNow you might worry about the space of Flatland “popping” from having a hole\nin it. Well, perhaps A Cube took care of that by using something like\nembroidery rings to clamp down around the edges of the hole and of the cut-out\npiece. Or maybe there just was a hole in space for a while. What would it be\nlike to have a hole in space? We’ll get back to the question in [chapter\n7](16_Chapter7.html).\n\n[ANSWER 6.4](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_4)\n\nNo, for we cannot tell whether the hole is moving through space. This is\nanalogous to the fact that a particular matter bump does not serve to mark out\nsome particular region of the fabric of space: as a wave moves across the\nwater, its component water bits are constantly changing. We might compare a\nmoving space hole to a bubble floating up through a liquid. Although the\nbubble’s shape and size stay the same, the bits of liquid that lie at the\nbubble’s boundary are changing as the bubble moves. An offbeat idea suggested\nby these considerations is that perhaps the smallest components of matter are\nnot vortices or space bumps but actual _holes in space._\n\n[ANSWER 6.5](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_5)\n\nThe idea is that the galaxy’s bump is on a line directly between us and the\nquasar. Light from the quasar to us can travel along two alternative shortest\npaths: one around either side of the galaxy’s big space bump. This splitting\nof a quasar’s image was definitely ob-served in 1979. (See Frederic Chaffee,\n“The Discovery of a Gravitational Lens,” _Scientific American,_ November\n1980.) The phrase “gravitational lens” is an exciting way of expressing the\nfact that space curvature can bend light. It is amusing to think of a vast\nsupertelescope based on gravitational lenses millions of miles across.\n\n![img](Images/p209_1.jpg)\n\n_Three bumps in a row, and two shortest paths._\n\n![img](Images/p209_2.jpg)\n\n_Top view of the two paths._\n\n![img](Images/p210_1.jpg)\n\n_Two kinds of singularity._\n\n[ANSWER 6.6](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_6)\n\nA point-sized mass can be most simply represented as a sharp cusp in space.\nAlternatively, one might imagine this cusp to be pulled all the way out to\ninfinity.\n\n[ANSWER 7.1](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_1)\n\nA geodesic on a sphere is a so-called great circle, that is, a circle, such as\nthe equator, which is as big as possible. Relative to the sphere’s surface,\nthe equator is “straight” because it bends neither north nor south. A smaller\ncircle, such as the Arctic Circle, can be seen to bend on the surface of the\nsphere and is not regarded as a geodesic.\n\n[ANSWER 7.2](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_2)\n\n![img](Images/p210_2.jpg)\n\n_Virtual image of an antipodal star._\n\nOne natural explanation of a massless star would be to say that space is\nhyperspherical, and that the massless star is the virtual image of a real star\nat the opposite end of the universe. Unfortunately, even if space really is a\nhypersphere, we are not likely to actually observe any such “fake stars.” The\nproblem is that space is marred by medium-scale irregularities that will\nprevent the perfect focusing of the star’s light rays at the point furthest\naway from the star. Another difficulty is that space contains clouds of dust\nhere and there, dust which will absorb most of a star’s light long before the\nlight makes it halfway round the universe. Were it not for these two problems,\nwe would in general expect to find a virtual image of any observed star at a\ndiametrically opposite spot in the sky — provided, of course, that space\nreally is hyperspherical.\n\n[ANSWER 7.3](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_3)\n\n![img](Images/p211_1.jpg)\n\n_Finite universe with “central” mass._\n\nIt would look like a light bulb, or an ice cream cone: a ball with a big bulge\non it. It is conceivable that our space actually has such a lopsided\nstructure. If we were just about on the opposite side from the superstar that\nmakes the bulge, then we wouldn’t necessarily have to be able to see it\ndirectly. Space dust and intermediate space bumps could dissipate the\nmonster’s image.

Zeno strikes again! If we line up the regions obtained, we get\nsomething that is infinitely long, but of unit area.\n\n[ANSWER 8.1](17_Chapter8.html#ch_8pa_1)\n\nThe two sheets of space might well snap apart. If the snap were too abrupt, it\nmight do some damage to the Globber in question.\n\n[ANSWER 8.2](17_Chapter8.html#ch_8pa_2)\n\nThis is the type of connection represented in figure 112, although the holes\nin the spaces could be eliminated. The image is of a strip of space joining\ntwo distinct spaces together. The strip could, of course, be made very short\nby bulging the spaces down to meet each other at the surface of the mirror.\n(Keep in mind here that just as a mirror in our space is a piece of a plane, a\nmirror in Flatland is a piece of a line.) This kind of link between spaces is\nexactly what Lewis Carroll deals with in _Through the Looking-Glass._ Marcel\nDuchamp was also obsessed with the notion of mirrors as doors to alternative\nuniverses. He was struck by the fact that a point approaching a mirror has the\nchoice, in principle, of either breaking through the mirror and continuing in\nnormal space, or of moving out of our space and into the alternate space we\nsee inside the mirror. Thus, for Duchamp, a mirror represented a sort of\nrailroad switch where one chooses between two spaces: real space and mirror\nspace. See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, _The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean\nGeometry in Modern Art,_ 1983.\n\n![img](Images/p213_1.jpg)\n\n_A link between two worlds._\n\nA very vivid way to enhance the illusion that a mirror is a door into another\nworld is to get a flashlight and go up to a mirror in a dark room. The laws of\noptics are such that if you shine the flashlight into the mirror, the image\nlooks exactly as if the flashlight beam goes through the mirror and into a\ndark room on the other side of the mirror.\n\n[ANSWER 8.3](17_Chapter8.html#ch_8pa_3)\n\nInstall an Einstein-Rosen bridge in the basement, and have this hyperspace\ntunnel lead to an infinite space empty except for the endless plane of\nFlatland.\n\n[ANSWER 9.1](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_1)\n\nTake a small spherical balloon. Blow it up and then let the air out. The\nentire spacetime trail of the balloon’s surface and inside is a solid\nhypersphere. The trail of the surface alone is the hypersurface of the\nhypersphere.\n\nThe speed with which the balloon should be inflated and deflated depends on\nwhat kind of conversion factor between space and time is adopted. In\nrelativity theory the speed of light is used as a conversion factor; that is,\na “meter of time” is taken to be the time it takes a light ray to travel one\nmeter — about three ten-millionths of a second.\n\nConstructing a hypercube in 4-D spacetime is even simpler. As Professor Tom\nBanchoff of Brown University puts it, “A hypercube in spacetime is just a\n_cube … for a while._ ”\n\n[ANSWER 9.2](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_2)\n\nThe “melting future” world view corresponds to the notion that future events\nexist, stored up and waiting for us. A uniform “now” moves forward with the\npassage of time, and instant after instant is permanently used up. In this\nviewpoint, past events are totally nonexistent. It is not uncommon for people\nto feel this way about their lives. Life here becomes a scarce resource that\nis consumed, and once something is over it doesn’t matter at all. This is\nprobably the least rewarding way possible to think about spacetime, as can be\nseen by thinking about the kind of personal philosophies inherent in the other\nthree world views shown in figure 146. Whenever you cut yourself off from your\npast, you’re in an extremely rootless and vulnerable position. But if you do\nthrow out the past, you might as well throw out the future, too, and get\ntotally into the “now.”\n\n[ANSWER 9.3](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_3)\n\nMr. Lee will put _X_ halfway between _A_ and C. The reason is that Lee will\nassume that it takes the light just as long to travel back from the other end\nof the platform as it took it to get there from his end. It is natural for him\nto think this, in view of the assumptions (1) and (2) mentioned in the puzzle.\nWe, of course, feel that it really takes the light longer to get from _A_ to\n_B_ than it takes it to get from _B_ to C … But Mr. Lee will say we just think\nthat because we’re racing past him at half the speed of light!\n\n![img](Images/p214_1.jpg)\n\n_A slanted time line causes a slanted space line._\n\nIf we draw a dotted line connecting _B_ with the event _X_ (which Mr. Lee says\nis simultaneous with _B_), then we get one of Lee’s _lines of simultaneity._\nThis line corresponds to the space axis in a Minkowski diagram that Lee might\ndraw; another way of putting it is that at the event _X,_ this line will\nrepresent Lee’s conception of “now” — just as his world line represents his\nconcept of “here.” It is possible to prove that in such a diagram, the\nobserver’s line of simultaneity will always tilt up by the same angle at which\nhis world line tilts over.\n\n[ANSWER 9.4](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_4)\n\n![img](Images/p215_1.jpg)\n\n_An expanding finite space._\n\nThe picture would be a sort of “conical” spacetime, as drawn here. The\nstarting point is known as “the initial singularity,” or as the Big Bang.\nWhether or not our space will eventually contract back to a point is unknown\nat present. Apparently it depends on how much mass is actually in our\nuniverse: if there is enough mass, then the gravitational forces will pull\nthings back together.\n\n[ANSWER 10.1](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_1)\n\nTo get into the sealed room, travel far, far into the future until you reach a\ntime where the room’s walls have crumbled. Step into the room’s space and then\ntravel back in time. Note that this is exactly analogous to moving _ana,_ then\nmoving across the location where the wall would be, and then coming back\n_kata_ into the room’s space.\n\nGetting the food out of someone’s stomach is a little trickier, since you\nyourself won’t fit in the stomach. Let us imagine that the stomach in question\nbelongs to your uncle Embry, snoozing off his Christmas banquet on his bed\nupstairs. The thing to do is to go forward in time to later that afternoon\nwhen he’s back out of bed. Take a little scoop and set it right on the bed\nwhere his stomach was. Now send the scoop back a few hours, to when he was\nthere, and then bring it back to the empty bed. Do this a few times, and you\ncan get all the chewed food out of Uncle’s stomach. Hide it under his pillow\nso he has a nice surprise that night!\n\n[ANSWER 10.2](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_2)\n\nIf we assume that the time machine goes straight backward in time, then “right\nhere one week ago” is wherever the time machine appears when I send it one\nweek back. One would not expect the Earth to still be “right here” a week ago,\nso traveling backward in time might well land one in empty space. Science\nfiction writers usually deal with this problem by somehow setting their time\nmachine to track along the Earth’s spacetime path.\n\nIt is interesting to realize that even without the paradoxes, time machines\nare already ruled out by relativity’s basic assumption that there is no such\nthing as absolute rest or motion in space. Of course, if people somehow\n_could_ build time machines, then we would probably just add some “except by\nusing time machines” clause to the relativity principle. Or it might be that\none would have to “aim” the time machine at some definite past object.\n\nNote that just as a time machine can be used to define “right here,” a machine\nthat transmitted objects instantaneously could be used to define “right now.”\nOne could, for instance, spew out a whole lot of synchronized clocks all over\nspace at the same instant. This also, of course, would violate relativity.\n\n[ANSWER 10.3](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_3)\n\nThe point is that “instantaneous” is a relative concept. Relative to Earth,\n_B_ happens at the same time as _A,_ so one can travel instantaneously from\n_A_ to _B._ Relative to the distant galaxy that moves away from us, C is\nsimultaneous with _B,_ so one can travel instantaneously from _B_ to C.\nCombining the two trips takes one from _A_ to _C,_ and thus into one’s own\npast.\n\n[ANSWER 10.4](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_4)\n\nEquip the rocket with a good robot brain so that after its hundreds-of-\nthousands-of-years-long journey, it can use the time machine to jump hundreds\nof thousands of years back in time and find the Earth. Once it finds the Earth\nagain, it makes a small time jump to the right day (the day of launch) and\nlands.\n\n[ANSWER 10.5](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_5)\n\nThe idea of a beacon that lasts all the way around time would lead to\ndifficulties. If it drifted away from Earth never to return, then there would\nbe, it seems, endlessly many of them out there, as a consequence of the one\nlaunch! This seems nonsensical. The situation is particularly vicious if we\nsuppose that _B_ 1 sends out a signal that can inhibit the launch of _B_ 0. A\nyes-and-no paradox!\n\n![img](Images/p217_1.jpg)\n\nOne _becomes_ infinite?\n\nMore thought is required. Let us look at the individual particles that make up\nthe beacon. If the universe really repeats itself, then it must be that each\nparticle returns — at the end of each cycle — to its starting position. The\nworld lines of particles are thus like rubber bands looped around the\nspacetime cylinder.\n\nNow say that we are in such a circular-time universe, and say that we have\nbuilt a durable radio beacon. The beacon has the form of a thick tangle of\n“bands” reaching around spacetime. Now, since we assembled the beacon — as\nopposed to just _finding_ it — it must be that all of the beacon’s component\nparticles are going to end up back on Earth: as ore, as glass fragments, and\nso on. Therefore, we can logically conclude that in a circular-time universe,\nany ship we build and launch into space must eventually crash back onto Earth\n… so that its particles can be assembled back into the ship to be launched! It\nis, in other words, _impossible to build a truly indestructible object if time\nis circular!_ For anything you build must in time disintegrate into pieces so\nthat you can “again” build it.\n\n[ANSWER 10.6](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_6)\n\nWe have a yes-and-no paradox here. I dial “1” at 11:00 if and only if I don’t\nget a call at 10:00, but I get a call at 10:00 if and only if I dial “1” at\n11:00. In other words, I get a call at 10:00 if and only if I don’t get a call\nat 10:00. This particular paradox was first raised in a paper by G. Benford,\nD. Book, and W. Newcomb, “The Tachyonic Antitelephone” (1970). Gregory Benford\nis, by the way, a science fiction writer, as well as being a physicist. The\n“tachyons” his paper refers to are hypothetical particles that, unlike\nordinary mass particles, _always_ go faster than light. Benford’s paper argues\nthat since tachyons could be used to send messages into one’s own past, it\nmust be, even in principle, impossible to detect them. If, then, tachyons are\nreal, they fill a sort of undetectable ghost universe whose time direction is\nin a sense perpendicular to our own time direction.\n\n![img](Images/p217_2.jpg)\n\n_Ships that pass in the night._\n\n[ANSWER 11.1](21_Chapter11.html#ch_11pa_1)\n\nNo. There are probably some sections of y our life that do not involve any\nthoughts at all about the other sections. In “A New Refutation of Time,”\nBorges argues that any state of mind that recurs in your life is _actually the\nsame event._\n\n[ANSWER 11.2](21_Chapter11.html#ch_11pa_2)\n\nDunne’s idea is that at any instant we have a fixed future along a familiar\ntime axis called _T_ 1; but that as a second, higher sort of time, _T_ 2,\nlapses, our future changes. Our actual time motion is a combination of _T_ 1\nmotion, which we might think of as _moving into the future,_ and _T2_ motion,\nwhich we might call _moving into alternate worlds._ When I see something\nunpleasant ahead in this Monday’s _T_ 1 future, I am able to move in the _T_ 2\ndirection into an alternate spacetime with a different _T_ 1 future.\n\n![img](Images/p218_1.jpg)\n\n_Saved by precognition!_\n\nDunne tended to think in terms of infinite regresses. His notion of time leads\nto a regress, for if the dreaming mind can see ahead into _T_ 1 future, it is\nnot unreasonable to suppose that it can also see into _T_ 2 future. And if you\ncan see _T_ 2 future, you can change it, which means that you are really\nmoving along, let us say, _T_ 3 time to a whole different _T_ 1-_T_ 2 plane!\nAnd, of course, there is no stop-ping at _T_ 3: the regress goes on forever.\n\nThe reason Dunne was willing to embrace such a crazy system is that he was so\ndissatisfied with a simple Minkowski diagram’s inability to depict our feeling\nthat _time really passes._ As we discuss in [chapter 11](21_Chapter11.html),\nany attempt to “animate” a Minkowski diagram by thinking of a “focus of\nconsciousness” moving up along one’s world line leads to the Dunne-style\nregress.\n\n![img](Images/p219_1.jpg)\n\n_“You’re going to do it till you get it right!”_\n\nIn his 1885 story “An Unfinished Communication,” Charles Howard Hinton\ndescribes a somewhat different sort of two-dimensional time. Hinton’s concept\nis that one’s life is repeated over and over, but with slight changes possible\neach time. After doing y our life often enough, you finally get it right.\n\n[ANSWER 11.3](21_Chapter11.html#ch_11pa_3)\n\nNo, this is just another example of a region of fact-space having a vague\nposition relative to one axis (your opinion), but a sharp posi-tion relative\nto another axis (the other person’s opinion). If you are close enough to a\nperson to be in some sense part of him (or her), then your opinion of him will\nevolve continuously with him. But if you are separated for a while and then\nbrought back together, the other person’s many possible states will seem to\ncollapse down to one or two definite facts. In quantum mechanics this abrupt\nchange is called “the collapse of the wave function.” It is worth noting that,\nin certain relaxed states, you are yourself spread out in fact-space, even\nrelative to your own axes. That is, if you are not presently asking yourself\nwhether you are happy, then there is, at present, no definite answer to the\nquestion. Sharp or hazy, reality is just what it seems.\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\nAbbott, Edwin Abbott. _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions._ 1884\\.\nReprint.

This additional chapter is based on lectures I have given in India\nand Australia entitled \"Geometry and the Pleasure Principle,\" and I hope that\nmy enthusiasm may be shared by others. I cannot think of any possible moral\ndisapproval which can be held to be valid if one enjoys geometrical activity,\nand perhaps one of the beliefs of my youth that excellence in geometry leads\nto excellence in other branches of mathematics may once again become current.\nFor this criterion to be tested, of course, geometry must not be excluded, as\nit has been for too many years, from school and college curricula. Fortunately\nthere are many signs of a revival of interest in geometrical teaching, and the\nMAA is one of the leaders in this very heartening activity. Boldface numerals\nin parentheses, such as (n) which appear in Chapter Zero refer to the list of\nreferences which appear at the end of Chapter Zero. These articles and books\ncan be consulted, of course, for further and more detailed information. DP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota June, 1994 vn\n\nCONTENTS Preface vii CHAPTER 0 xi CHAPTER I 1.

The only tools needed are paper, a pencil, a simple school\ncompass (sometimes called a pair of compasses), a ruler to draw straight lines\nconnecting pairs of points, and perhaps a protractor to measure angles in\ndegrees. The protractor reveals at once the great antiquity of the subject,\nfor the markings around the semicircle are in multiples and divisions of 60°,\nand this system of numeration dates back to Babylonian times. We note that the\nangle on a straight line is 180°, and that a right angle is 90°. We are told\nthat the Greeks of the third century bc, whose geometrical learning was\ncollated by Euclid, were not able to fix the arms of the compass they used at\na constant inclination, so that as the instrument was raised from the sand\ntray on which they made their drawings, the arms collapsed together. Our\nmodern compass has arms which can be made to stay at a fixed distance apart,\nand we can immediately draw that most aesthetic of all curves, a circle.\nMarking a point on this circle, we can \"step around\" the circle (Figure 1°)\nand find the point which is at the other end of the diameter, a property we\nshall use later (p. xix) and, drawing more circles, we can produce a much-\nloved pattern, the basis of the windows found in many cathedrals (Figure 2°).\nFig. 1° XI\n\nxii CIRCLES c Fig. 2° Fig. 3° Our compass with the fixed radius AB (Figure 3°)\ncan produce the vertex C of an equilateral triangle ABC, in which AB = BC =\nCA, and if we assume, as is the case in Euclidean geometry, that the angles of\nany triangle add to 180°, it is clear that the angles of an equilateral\ntriangle are each equal to 60°. If we allow the circular arcs CAC, CBC to\nremain in our figure, we have constructed a shape regarded as fundamental in\nmediaeval architecture, the fish bladder. But of even greater importance is\nthe fact that we have a method, using our compass and ruler, of constructing\nthe perpendicular bisector CC of a given segment AB. Symmetry suggests that if\nP is any point on CC, the distance PA is equal to the distance PB. We use this\nfact to construct the circumcircle (the circle which passes through the\nvertices A, B, and C) of any given triangle ABC. We draw the perpendicular\nbisectors of AB and BC. If these lines intersect at O, then OA = OB (Figure\n4°), and also OB = OC, and we deduce, subconsciously using one of Euclid's\npostulate- axioms, that OA = OC, and finally, although we have not proved this\nconverse, that O must lie on the perpendicular bisector of CA.\n\nCHAPTER 0 xm Fig. 4° A circle with radius OA = OB = OC and centre O will pass\nthrough the vertices A, B, and C of the triangle ABC. This point O is called\nthe circumcentre of the triangle ABC. There are more circles conventionally\nassociated with a triangle ABC, one incircle and three excircles, and to\nintroduce these we must talk about the angle between two given lines. If A is\na point on one line, B on the other, and O the intersection of the lines, we\ncan call OA and OB half-lines, and use our protractor to measure the angle\nbetween them. If the half- lines coincide, the angle is zero degrees (0°), and\nif OB is just an extension of OA (or rather AO), the angle between the lines\nis 180°, that is: two right angles. Fig. 5°\n\nXIV CIRCLES To draw the line bisecting the angle AOB, we use our compass and\nmark OA = OB on the respective lines, and then find P where AP = BP, the\nintersection of arcs centres A and B respectively. Joining P to O, we have a\nline which clearly bisects the angle AOB (Figure 5°). When we say clearly,, we\nare using a theorem that states that if in two given triangles OBP and OAP we\nhave the equalities OP = OP, OA = OB, and AP = BP, then the triangles are\ncongruent (identical, in a sense), and the corresponding angles are equal, so\nthat /-BOP = ZAOP. If we draw the external bisector of angle AOB, the line OQ,\nthen it is not surprising to see that OQ is at right angles to OP. The proof\ndepends on the simplest algebra. Now we can draw a circle which touches the\nsides of a given triangle ABC. A line touches a circle at a given point on the\ncircle if it passes through the point and has no further intersection with the\ncircle. Such a line is tangent to the circle at the given point, and is at\nright angles to the line drawn from the centre of the circle to the given\npoint. You may think that this does not need proof. Assuming this fundamental\ntheorem, we \"drop a perpendicular\" PL from P onto OA, and a perpendicular PM\nonto OB, and we have the equality PL = PM. A circle centre P and radius PL =\nPM will touch both OA and OB (Figure 5°). To construct the incircle of a given\ntriangle ABC, we draw the bisector of angle A, and the bisector of angle B,\nand let / be the intersection of these two lines (Figure 6°). Fig. 6°\n\nCHAPTER 0 xv For all points on AI the perpendicular distance of P from AB is\nequal to the perpendicular distance of P from AC, with a similar argument\nholding for points P on the bisector of angle B. Hence the point I is\nequidistant from AB, AC, and BC, and a circle centre / can be drawn to touch\nAB, AC, and BC. The point / is the incentre of triangle ABC, and we have the\ntheorem: the bisectors of the angles A, B, and C meet at a point. We show how\nto draw the excircle opposite C by drawing the bisectors of the external\nangles of the triangle at A and B, respectively. This excentre lies on the\ninternal bisector of angle C. The triangle has one incircle and three\nexcircles (Figure 7°). There are two other familiar points connected with a\ntriangle ABC. One is the intersection of the medians, the lines joining the\nvertices of the triangle to the midpoints of opposite sides. This point M is\noften called the centroid of the triangle, and trisects each median (Figure\n8°). A final point in our brief discussion is the orthocentre H of a triangle\nABC. If we drop perpendiculars from the vertices onto Fig. 7°\n\nXVI CIRCLES Fig. 8° the opposite sides of triangle ABC, these three lines will\npass through the same point H. If one angle of the triangle exceeds a right\nangle, the point H will lie outside the triangle. Curiously enough, this point\nis not mentioned in Euclid (Figure 9°). Fig. 9° But Euclid does discuss the\nnotion of parallel lines. The famous Postulate V, which distinguishes\nEuclidean geometry from other geometries, declares: If a straight line falling\non two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two\nright angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on the\nside on which the angles are less than two right angles (Figure 10°).\n\nCHAPTER 0 xvii Fig. 10° If we now define parallel lines as straight lines\nwhich, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both\ndirections, do not meet one another in either direction, we obtain the equal\nangles shown in Figure 11°. 1 Fig. 11° The interior angles on the same side of\nthe straight line falling on the two parallel lines add to two right angles.\nFrom these preliminaries it follows rapidly that in Euclidean geometry the\nangle sum of any proper triangle (whose vertices are not collinear) is two\nright angles, and we move on to the notion of similar triangles. These are\ntriangles of the same shape (Figure 12°). In the figure, angle a is equal to\nangle A, angle b to angle B, and angle c to angle C. It can be shown that in\nsuch a case the sides are proportional: that is, if BC — kbc, then CA = kca,\nand AB = kab. Conversely, if equalities of this type hold between the\n\nXV1U CIRCLES FIG. 12° sides of two given triangles, then these triangles have\nthe same shape (they are similar), and corresponding angles are equal. Our\nfinal essential theorem before we move on to properties of circles refers to\ntransversals of three given parallel lines (Figure 13°). A ~ * y V Q >. J- ^\n;- Fig. 13° If one transversal is pqr and another is PQR, then pq/qr = PQ/QR.\nIf we join p to R, we have two triangles with a common side, and in the one:\npq/qr = ps/sR, and in the other ps/sR = PQ/QR. We note that in the figure\nshowing the concurrence of the medians of a triangle (Figure 8°) AB = 2ab, and\nab is parallel to AB. Before we examine circles in some detail, let us dally\nwith a lovely problem which captured my attention many years ago. Given two\npoints O and A, and only a compass, how can one determine, exactly, the\nmidpoint of the segment OA?\n\nCHAPTER 0 xix This problem came from some Cambridge University examination\npapers (called the Mathematical Tripos) in the days when the problems had to\nbe solved by the methods of Euclidean geometry, the calculus being strictly\nforbidden. The stress is on the word \"exactly.\" One is tempted to doodle and\nguess .... However ... draw the circle centre A and radius AO, and, beginning\nat O, step round this circle to B, the opposite end of the diameter through O\n(see Figure 1°). With O as centre draw the circle through A, and with B as\ncentre and radius BO draw a circle which cuts the circle centre O in P and Q.\nWith P as centre and radius PO, draw a circle, and with Q as centre and radius\nPO draw another circle. These last two circles intersect in O and the desired\nmidpoint M. Fig. 14° The proof of the preceding construction depends, very\nsimply, on the theory of similar triangles. There are two isosceles triangles\n(triangles with two equal sides) in the figure, and the base angles being\nequal, the sides are proportional, and this gives the result. This problem\noccurs again in the main section of this book (p. 24). (The two isosceles\nsimilar triangles are POM and BPO.) In the main section of this book it will\nbe shown that the ruler can be dispensed with in the constructions of\nEuclidean geome-\n\nXX CIRCLES try, except, of course, for drawing an actual line connecting two\npoints. How does one check that a given ruler does draw a straight line? Take\ntwo points A and B, and use the ruler to draw the alleged straight line AB.\nNow turn the ruler on its other side, and again draw the line AB. If the two\nlines you have drawn connecting A to B enclose a space, your ruler is\ndefective. Since rulers traditionally receive a lot of wear, it may pass this\ntest, but may still have notches in its edge. It is easier to draw an accurate\ncircle than it is to draw a straight line, and so one should not be too\nsurprised to see that books have been written with the title: How to draw a\nstraight line. A final remark before we examine some of the properties of\ncircles. There are two theorems which deal with a triangle and lines, the Ceva\ntheorem, and the Menelaus theorem. Ceva's theorem. If lines AP, BP, and CP\nthrough the respective vertices of a triangle ABC intersect the respective\nopposite sides in the points L, M, and N, then (Figure 15°)\n(BL/LC)(CM/MA)(AN/NB) = 1. If this relation holds, the lines AL, BM, and CN\nmeet in a point P. Fig. 15°\n\nCHAPTER 0 xxi Fig. 16° Menelaus's theorem. If a line intersects the respective\nsides BC, CA, and AB of a triangle ABC in the points A', B', and C, then\n(Figure 16°) {BA'/A'C){CB'/B'A){AC'/C'B) = -1. If this relation holds, the\npoints A', B', and C lie on a line. The Menelaus theorem is proved simply by\ndropping perpendiculars AL, BM, and CN onto the line, and using the ratio\nproperties of similar triangles, and the Ceva theorem is proved by comparing\nthe areas of triangles with a vertex in common, and along the same baseline.\nThe lengths involved in both theorems are signed lengths. The time-span\nbetween the appearance of the Menelaus theorem and the Ceva theorem runs to\nhundreds of years. (For further information, see 1.) The circle has some\nbeautiful intrinsic properties. If O is the centre of a given circle, P and Q\nare given points on the circle, and the point R is a variable point on the\ncircle, then the angle PRQ is a constant angle as R moves on each of the parts\nof the circle bounded by the points P and Q. The sum of these two constant\nangles is 180° (Figure 17°). This theorem is an obvious deduction from the\ntheorem that the angle POQ is twice the angle PRQ. Since the angle on a line\nis 180°, and the sum of the angles of a triangle is also 180°, the external\nangle of a triangle is the sum of the two interior and opposite angles, and\nif, as in the case we are considering, the triangles POR and QOR are both\nisosceles, the sides OR\n\nxxii CIRCLES Fig. 17° Fig. 18° and OP being equal, and also the sides OR and\nOQ, the angles shown in the figure are equal, and so angle POQ is twice angle\nPRQ. The above proof has to be modified when PR crosses OQ, but the theorem\nstill holds. However, if R lies on the other part of the circle bounded by P\nand Q (Figure 18°), the angle POQ is now the complement of the angle with R on\nthe first arc, the two angles adding to 360°, and we have the theorem: If\nPR'QR are points in this order on a circle, then angle PRQ + angle PR'Q = 2\nright angles. The converse of this theorem also holds for points PR'QR which\nform a convex quadrangle. If the two angles shown in Figure 18° add to two\nright angles, then the four points are concyclic, lying on a circle. Another\npotent theorem which holds for a circle leads to the power concept. If P is a\ngiven point and lines PAB, PA'B' through P intersect a given circle in the\npoints A, B, and A', B' respectively, then PAPB = PA' ■ PB'. This number,\nwhich depends only on P and the given circle is called the power of the point\nP with respect to the given circle. The proof of this theorem (Figure 19°) is\nimmediate from the recognition that the triangles PBA' and PB'A are similar,\nso\n\nCHAPTER 0 FIG. 19° that PB/PA' = PB'/PA. If P lies outside the circle, and PT\nis a tangent at T, the power of P is also (PT)2, and if O is the centre of the\ncircle, R its radius, this is equal to (PO)2 — R2, by the Pythagorean theorem.\nWhen P lies inside the circle (Figure 20°) we again have similar triangles,\nand a similar proof. But now we cannot draw a tangent from P to the circle.\nIf, however, PCC is at right angles to PO, then PC = PC, and so the power is\nequal to (PC)2, which is equal to R2 — (PO)2. It is convenient to write the\npower as (PO)2 — R2 in this case also, a full justification arising when we\ndiscuss circles using analytical geometry, as we do later in this Fig. 20°\n\nXXIV CIRCLES book. Of course, the power of P is zero when P lies on the\ncircle, and it is positive when P lies outside the circle, and negative when P\nlies inside the circle. We now come to the important concept of orthogonal\ncircles, circles which cut each other at right angles. Of course, circles can\ncut each other at other angles, the angle of intersection being measured by\nthe angle between the tangents to each circle at a point of intersection. But\northogonal circles are especially simple to construct. Draw the tangent at a\npoint T on a circle, and on the tangent choose a point O. With O as centre,\ndraw the circle with radius OT (Figure 21°). We now have two circles which\nhave tangents at the point T of intersection at right angles. Of course, this\nis true for the other point of intersection also. Now let QOP be a diameter of\nthe circle centre O which intersects our first circle in the points A and B.\nThen the power of O with respect to the first circle is OB. OA, and this is\nalso (OT)2. But OT is a radius of the second circle, so that we have OBOA=\n(OP)2 = (OQf. (1) The set of points, consisting of the pair A, B, and the pair\nP, Q, is called an harmonic set, and has special properties, as we shall show.\nA and B are said to be harmonic conjugates with respect to P and Q, and P and\nQ are said to be harmonic conjugates with respect to A and B. P divides the\nsegment AB internally in the same ratio that Q divides it externally. That is\nAP/PB = -AQ/QB. Fig. 21°\n\nCHAPTER 0 XXV Likewise PA/AQ = -PB/BQ. Each of these equalities is rapidly\ndeducible from the other. We now show that from AP/PB + AQ/QB = 0, we can\ndeduce the equations (1) above, and conversely. We use coordinates for\nsimplicity, taking the origin at O, the midpoint of PQ. We have the equation\n(p-a)/(b-p) + (q-a)/(b-q) = 0, where p + q = 0, and substituting for q, (p -\na)/(b -p) + (-p - a)/(b + p) = 0. Multiplying by (b — p)(b + p), which is not\nzero, we obtain (p - a)(b + p) - (p + a)(b - p) = 0, which simplifies to 2p2 -\n2ab = 0, that is OAOB = (OP)2 = (OQ)2. From this final equation we can reverse\nevery step taken, and arrive back at AP/PB + AQ/QB = 0. Harmonic sets will\nplay an important part in our next chapter. We have two more theorems to\ndiscuss before returning to the pleasures of geometrical constructions, both\ninvolving the or- thocentre H of a triangle ABC. If AH intersects BC in P, and\nthe circumcircle in K, then HP = PK (Figure 22°). Fig. 22°\n\nxxvi CIRCLES FIG. 23° From the figure the proof is clear. The two triangles\nCPH and CPK are congruent, both have right angles at P, they have the common\nside PC, the angle PCK is equal to the angle BAK, subtended on the\ncircumcircle by BK, and angle BCH is equal to angle BAH, both differing from a\nright angle by the angle B. If A' is the midpoint of BC, then AH = 20A'\n(Figure 23°). If the perpendicular at C to BC intersects the circumcircle\nagain at P', then P'B is a diameter of the circumcircle, and so must pass\nthrough the circumcentre O. Since P'AB is also a right angle, P'A is parallel\nto CH. Hence P'AHC is a parallelogram, and AH is equal to P'C. Finally, in the\nright triangle BP'C, OA' bisecting both BP' and BC, we have P'C is equal to\n20A', and so AH is equal to 20A'. We now return to geometrical constructions\nwhich produce pleasing and unexpected figures. To start with, we draw a\ncircle, which we shall call the base circle. Fix a point A on this base\ncircle, and then draw circles which have their centres on the base circle, but\nalways pass through the given point A. As you move systematically around the\nbase circle, the drawn circles change in size and you will produce, as an\nenvelope, a curve touched by all the circles you have drawn, a heart-shaped\ncurve, a cardioid, (Figure 24°). At the special point A, two parts of the\ncurve touch. Such a point is called a cusp. This curve has been known for\nseveral centuries (see (2)). You may want to experiment, moving the point A\noff the base circle.\n\nCHAPTER 0 xxvii Fig. 24° Curves are usually regarded as traced out by points\non the curve considered, but they can also be defined by their tangents. A\nsimple method for doing this is to crease paper. We begin with a sheet of\npaper on which we designate one edge as £, (Figure 25°), and mark a point on\nthe paper, which we call S. Fold the paper so that the edge £ passes through\nS, and then crease the paper along a line so that the edge £ continues to pass\nthrough S. (Plain writing paper will do, tissue paper is too \"•■V. ? 1 1 1 - /\n/ ^^ Fig. 25°\n\nXXV111 CIRCLES \\ m \\/ s 1/ / A FIG. 26° thin, cardboard is too thick.) When we\nopen the sheet of paper out again, we have the situation shown in Figure 25°,\nand it is important to note the relation of the crease to the edge £ and the\npoint S. The crease bisects SP at right angles, P being the point on the edge\nI where S landed when the paper was folded. If P' is the point where the\ncrease meets SP, what kind of curve does P' trace as P moves along the edge\n(P. Can you prove that P' traces a line parallel to £, and halfway between S\nand P. See Figure 26°. If you continue making creases, you will see that they\ntouch an attractive curve, the parabola, with S as its focus. I say the\nparabola, all parabolas have the same shape, but obviously the size of our\nparabola depends on the distance of S from L Noting the relation of the crease\nto SP in Figure 27°, and drawing the path (the locus) of P', we can draw\ntangents to the Fig. 27°\n\nCHAPTER 0 xxix parabola without making creases by using a simple geometrical\ninstrument, a right triangle, made of wood (or plastic), called a setsquare in\nEngland, but not in America. Let one side of the right angle pass through S,\nthe vertex of the right angle lying on m, the halfway line, and draw the other\nside of the right angle. This is, of course, a quicker method than paper\ncreasing. The halfway line m is a tangent to the parabola, we note, and the\ncurve is symmetrical about the perpendicular from S onto m. This line is\ncalled the axis of the parabola, and m is the tangent at the vertex of the\nparabola. It is not difficult to obtain the focal properties of the parabola\nfrom this construction via its tangents (see (2)), and such properties were\nknown to Albrecht Diirer (1471-1528), a great artist and geometer (Figure\n28°). These properties are used in car headlamp reflectors, in radio antennas,\nand so on. Parabolic dishes are used everywhere. What happens if we pursue our\npaper-folding-creasing construction, and choose a circle C, and mark a point S\ninside it, Fig. 28°\n\nXXX CIRCLES FIG. 29° and then fold our paper so that a point on the circle C\nitself falls on the point S when we crease the paper. Our creases produce the\ntangents to an ellipse (Figure 29°), with the point S as one focus. We can\nagain draw lines instead of making creases if we note that if P is the point\non the circle C which falls on S, then the midpoint P' of SP moves on a circle\nwith radius half that of the circle C. See Figure 30°. Take O as the centre of\nC, and let O' be the midpoint of SO. Prove that O'P' is equal to OP/2, and is\ntherefore a constant length. This follows from the fact that P' bisects SP and\nO' bisects SO. To obtain tangents to an ellipse we therefore join S to points\nP' on the half-circle, and draw lines at right angles through the points P' to\ngive the creases. The shape of the ellipse depends essentially on the ratio of\nthe distances of S from O and the end of the radius of C which passes through\nS.\n\nCHAPTER 0 XXXI Fig. 30° Fig. 31° Finally, let S be a point outside the circle\nC, and repeat the folding-creasing construction. We obtain both branches of an\nhyperbola (Figure 31°), and it is a good geometrical exercise to dis-\n\nXXX11 CIRCLES cover which points P on the circle C give one branch and which\npoints the other, and whether the asymptotes can be located. Again, the focal-\noptical properties of the ellipse and hyperbola follow more easily from the\ntangential generations of the curves than from other methods (2). More can be\nsaid about the outlining of a curve by drawing the tangents to the curve. The\nparabola is rather special in this connection. Take two lines £ and m (Figure\n32°), and divide each into equal segments. The scale on the two lines need not\nbe the same. Number the divisions on each line 1,2,3,... and join the points\nwith the same number to each other. If you have avoided the case of a set of\nparallel lines, you will obtain the tangents to a parabola. This also touches\n£ and m. Carried out with threads of psychedelic colors on a nice piece of\nstained wood, these rank as artistic creations and were very popular (and\nexpensive) some years ago. For more on curve stitching see (2). We began our\ndiscussion of the attractions of geometry with a simple compass, and then we\ndrew straight lines. We continue with the geometry of an unmarked straight\nruler, which, amazingly enough, comprises the whole of projective geometry, of\nwhich Euclidean geometry is a sub-geometry (1). Fig. 32°\n\nCHAPTER 0 xxxm Fig. 33° There is a lovely theorem, easily discovered if we\ndoodle with a straightedge, known for over 2,000 years, namely the Pappus\nTheorem. Take two lines £ and m, and mark points A, B, and C on the one, and\npoints A', B', and C on the other (Figure 33°). These points can be anywhere\non the lines, the theorem being a non-metrical one. Find the intersections L =\nBC D B'C, M = CA'D CA, and N = AB' n MB. L, M, and N are collinear. This is\nsurely a startling result, totally unexpected, easy to grasp, and beautiful to\ncontemplate. In the modern foundations of geometry it is one of the\nfundamental theorems. If we take other points, say D on H and D' on m, the\nintersection CD' fl CD lies on the line already constructed. This line will\nnot, we note, usually pass through the intersection of £ and m.\n\nXXXIV CIRCLES A case where it always does so arises when we choose our points\nA, A', B, B', and C, C in a special way, so that the joins AA', BB', and CC\nall pass through the same point V. The theorem of Pappus still applies, and we\nobtain a figure almost like a national flag, seen in perspective. If O = £ fl\nto, we can prove, from the construction itself, that the line LMN passes\nthrough O. (If we regard O as a point of £, and O' = O as a point of to, where\nis AO' fl A'O?) This line is called the polar line of the point V with regard\nto £ and to. We now prove what may seem to be, at first sight, a difficult\ntheorem: If the polar line of V passes through a point U, then the polar line\nof U passes through the point V. Let U be a point on the polar of V, say at\nthe intersection of the lines PQ' and P'Q (Figure 34°). Then PP' and QQ' both\npass through V. To obtain points on the polar of U with regard to £ and to, we\nmust first draw lines through U to intersect £ and to. Some already exist, the\nlines PQ' and QP' meeting £ in P and Q and to in Q' and P'. The intersection\nof PP' and QQ' gives a point on the polar of U. But this is the point V. We\nhave proved our theorem. This is certainly very pretty, but is it of any\npractical use? The answer is in the affirmative ... we can now solve the\nfollowing problem in civil engineering. Lines £ and to representing roads are\ndrawn, but intersect at an inaccessible point, off the paper (Figure 35°). It\nis required Q' P> Fig. 35°\n\nCHAPTER 0 XXXV to draw a line through a given point V, between I and to, which\nwill pass through the inaccessible point. To do this, draw the polar of V with\nregard to H and to, and mark some point U on this polar, the point U,\nnaturally, being on the paper. Draw the polar of U. It will pass through V, by\nour theorem, and it also passes through the intersection of I and to. The\nnotion of a polar line of a point V with regard to two lines can be extended\nto the idea of a polar line of a point V with regard to a circle, or any\nconic, to the concept of the polar plane of a point P (as we shall see later\nin this book) with regard to surfaces of the second degree in space of three\ndimensions, and in each case harmonic sets of points are involved. Here we use\nthe concept to find the tangents from a point V to a circle (Figure 36°). Fig.\n36° Without deprecating the construction given in Euclid, which involves the\nuse of a compass, it is a matter of experience that those interested in\ngeometry to whom the above construction is new are delighted with its\nsimplicity and beauty. We end this introduction to the main part of this book\nwith a challenge to the reader. Why does the 5-circle construction given\n\nXXXVI CIRCLES below, with a compass of fixed radius, give the vertex C of an\nequilateral triangle ABC, given the points A and B? The fixed opening of the\ncompass must exceed half of the distance AB, so as to give intersecting\ncircles. The Euclidean construction uses a compass with opening equal to AB.\nSome compasses are rusty, and cannot be opened out, hence the above is called\na rusty compass construction. The 5-circle construction first appeared some\nyears ago as a doodle by a student who was completely unaware of what he had\nwrought, and has given rise to some very attractive research on rusty compass\nconstructions. There is good reason to believe that the figure has never\nappeared before (Figure 37°). Fig. 37° Footnote on the history of geometrical\nideas and theorems While writing this Chapter Zero (March 7, 1994), I was\nastonished and delighted to hear from Professor Stephen G. Tellman, of the\nUniversity of Arizona in Tucson, who wrote: I vividly remember my reaction of\namazement and disbelief when, many years ago, I was first introduced to Feuer-\nbach's Theorem—while browsing through the pages of a small book with the\narresting title Circles, which I had more or less randomly come upon. That\nsense of amazement is as alive today as it was then.\n\nCHAPTER 0 xxxvii Not everyone is interested in the history of geometrical\nideas, and in writing a book, too much history may distract the reader from\nthe main discourse. But the story of Karl Wilhelm Feuer- bach's tragically\nshort life (1800-1834), as narrated in the warm and sensitive article by Laura\nGuggenbuhl (3), which Professor Tellman very kindly enclosed with his letter,\nis one that should be remembered, and it throws light on the history of the\nninepoint circle and the great Feuerbach Theorem. See Appendix, p. 89.\nFeuerbach's proof of his theorem is analytical and trigonometrical, using the\nnotion that two circles touch if the distance between their centres is the sum\nor difference of their radii. He seemed to be unaware of at least three of the\npoints which lie on the ninepoint circle. His paper appeared in 1822 (4). A\nfull discussion of the ninepoint circle as the locus of the centres of\nrectangular hyperbolas which pass through the vertices of a triangle and its\northocentre appeared in a joint work by Brianchon and Poncelet in 1821 (5).\nPoncelet, who was always very defensive about priorities in the discoveries of\ngeometrical theorems (6) never laid claim to the Feuerbach theorem. For those\nacquainted with projective geometry, it may be noted that the ninepoint circle\nappears as a special case of the theorem which discusses the conic locus of\nthe centres of conies which pass through four given points (1). Finally, it is\nsaid that the ninepoint circle is called the Feuerbach circle in Europe, but\nit will come as no shock that this does not include England.

The nine-\npoint circle This circle is the first really exciting one to appear in any\ncourse on elementary geometry. It is a circle which is found to pass through\nnine points intimately connected with a given triangle ABC. Three proofs are\ngiven. Each has its own peculiar merits. Fig. 1 (i) H is the orthocentre of\ntriangle ABC, the intersection of the altitudes AP, BQ, CB. The midpoints of\nBC, CA and AB are A', B' and C respectively. L', M', N' are the midpoints of\nHA, HB, HC. We show that a circle passes through the nine points A', B', C,\nL', M', N', P, Q, R. We use the theorem that the line joining the midpoints of\ntwo sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side. Both B'C and N'M' are\n|| to BC, and both B'N' and CM' are || to AH. Hence B'C'M'N' is a rectangle.\nSimilarly C'A'N'L' is a rectangle. l\n\n2 CIRCLES [1.1 Hence A'L', B'M' and C'N' are three diameters of one circle.\nSince A'P and L'P are J_, this circle passes through P. Similarly it passes\nthrough Q and B. Fig. 2 (ii) Let 0 be the circumcentre of ABC and B the\ncircumradius. We know that AH = WA'. Since L' bisects ^H, L'H = OA', and\ntherefore OH and L'^4' bisect each other, in N, say. Now NL' = tf<4' = NP\n(since /_APB = 90°). We also know that HP = PK, and since ON = NH, we have NP\n= \\OK = \\B. Therefore the circle centre N and radius \\B passes through P, A',\nL'. Similarly it passes through Q, B', M' and B, C, N'. Fig. 3\n\n1.1 J THE NINE-POINT CIRCLE 8 (iii) The third proof uses a lemma from the\ntheory of similar figures. If X is a point on a given circle of centre 0 and\nradius B, and H is any given fixed point, the locus of X', the midpoint of HX,\nis a circle centre N, where N bisects HO, and radius \\B. The proof is clear.\nFio. 4 Applying this lemma to the case of the circumcircle of ABC, H being the\northocentre, we see that a circle centre N and radius \\B passes through P, Q,\nB, L', M', N'. We must now show that this circle also passes through A', B',\nC. It is sufficient to show that if HX contains A', then HX is bisected at A'.\nFig. 5 Let AO meet the circumcircle in Y. Then /_ACY = 90°, so that YC || BH.\nSince also /_ABY = 90°, YB \\\\\\ CH. Therefore YBHC is a parallelogram, and the\ndiagonals YH and BC\n\n4 CIRCLES [1.2 bisect each other. Hence Y is the same point as X in the\nprevious diagram, and the theorem is proved. The methods used above are\nelementary, and at least one of the three proofs will be familiar to most\nreaders of this book. In chapter II we shall need to assume some theorems in\ninversion and coaxal systems of circles. As fashions in mathematical teaching\nchange, it cannot be assumed that all readers will be familiar with these\ntheories, and a brief (but adequate) outline of each will now be given. 2.\nInversion This is a one-to-one transformation of the points of the plane by\nFig. 6 means of a given circle, which we shall call E, of radius k and centre\n0. To obtain the transform X' of any given point X, or the inverse of X in the\ncircle E, we join X to 0, and find X' on OX such that OX. OX' = kz. The point\n0 itself is excluded from the points of the plane which may be transformed. It\nis clear that (i) X is the inverse of X'; (ii) points on E transform into\nthemselves; (iii) if A, A' are the ends of the diameter of E through X, then\nX, X' are harmonic conjugates with respect to A, A'. All circles through X and\nX' cut E orthogonally, since the square of the tangent from 0 to such a circle\n= OX.OX' = k2.\n\n1.2] INVERSION Fig. 7 As a corollary to this remark, we see that if # is any\ncircle orthogonal to E, all points on # invert into points on <€, for OX.OX' =\nk2. It is sometimes necessary to consider the process of inversion when 27,\nthe circle of inversion, is a line. If we keep A fixed, and let A' move off to\ninfinity, we see that X' moves towards the geometrical image of X in the\nresulting line. . 13— X' A Fig. 8 For future application we now give a\nconstruction, using only a Fig. 9\n\n6 CIRCLES [1.2 pair of compasses, by which we can find the inverse of a point\nX in a circle 27 of given centre 0. Let the circle centre X and radius XO cut\n27 in Q and Q', and let 0 and X' be the intersections of the two circles with\ncentres Q and Q' and radii QO and Q'O respectively. Then X' is the inverse of\nX in 27. For QOX and X'OQ are isosceles triangles with a common base angle.\nThey are therefore similar, and OX :0Q = OQ : OX'. Hence OX.OX' = 0Q*. This\nconstruction lies at the basis of the discussion on compass geometry in §11.\nWe are interested in the locus of inverse points X' as X describes a given\ncurve <€. This locus is called the inverse of the curve ^ with respect to 27.\nWhen ^ is a circle orthogonal to 27, we have seen that the inverse is #\nitself. The general theorem is: The inverse of a circle is a straight line or\na circle. Fig. 10 (i) The centre of inversion 0 is on <€: Let OA be the\ndiameter of # through 0, and let A' be the inverse of A. Then OA.OA' = k2. If\nX is any point on #, and X' its inverse, 0X.0X' = k*= OA.OA'. Hence A, X, X',\nA' are concyclic points, and since /_AX0 — 90°, IX!A'A = 90°. Therefore X'\ndescribes the line through A'± to OA. We note that this line is || to the\ntangent to # at 0. It naturally passes through the intersections of # and 27,\nsince points on 27 invert into themselves.\n\n1.2] INVERSION 7 Corollary. The inverse of a straight line is a circle through\nthe centre of inversion. (ii) The centre of inversion 0 is not on <€. Let G be\nthe centre Fig. ll of <io. Since OX.OX' = fc2, and OX.OY=t\\ where t is the\ntangent1\" from 0 to #, by division we have OX' = k* 0Y~ t*' Since this ratio\nis constant, it follows that if C is a point on OC such that C'X' || CY, then\nC is a fixed point, and C'X' is constant. Hence X' moves on a circle centre C.\nNote that C is not necessarily the inverse of C. We shall soon find what point\nthe centre of ^ does invert into. We need only one further theorem from the\ntheory of inversion: The angle of intersection oj two circles is unaltered by\ninversion. In fact a more general theorem is true, but this one will suffice\nfor our subsequent needs. t We shall see later that t2 may be negative. Then O\nis inside \"SP.\n\n8 CIRCLES fl.2 (i) If both circles # and 3} pass through the centre 0 of\ninversion, they transform info straight lines parallel to the tangents to #\nand Q at 0, so that the theorem is evident. Fig. 13 (ii) If at least one of\nthe circles #, Q> does not pass through 0, let P be a point of intersection of\nthe two circles, and let I, m be the tangents at P to #, 3> respectively. We\nmay draw a circle (271 through 0 which touches I at P, and a circle 3)x\nthrough 0 which touches m at P. Then the angle between (271 and 3lx is the\nsame as that between # and 2. Now if P' is the inverse of P, the tangent at P'\nto the inverse of # is the inverse of <€1. Hence the angle between the circles\ninverse to # and to 9) is equal to the angle between ^ and 2i1 (by (i) above),\nand this is equal to the angle between # and 3l.\n\n1.3] feuerbach's theorem 9 With the help of this theorem we can now find the\ninverse of the centre of a circle (€. All lines through the centre G cut #\northogonally. These lines invert into circles through the centre of inversion\n0 and the inverse of C. Since all circles through 0 and the inverse of C cut\nthe inverse of # orthogonally, the inverse of C must be the inverse of 0 in\nthe inverse of #. If 0 lies on #, so that the inverse of # is a straight line,\nthe centre of # inverts into the geometrical image of 0 in this line. We now\ngive some applications of the theory of inversion. 3. Feuerbach's theorem The\nnine-point circle of a triangle touches the incircle and excircles of\nthe.triangle. We consider the excircles opposite B and C. Let their centres be\nE2 and Ez, and their points of contact with BC Y2 and Y3. The points A, S\ndivide E2E3 internally and externally in the same ratio, that of the radii of\nthe two excircles. Dropping perpendiculars on BC, it follows that P and S also\ndivide Y2Y3 internally and externally in the same ratio. That is, P and S are\nharmonic conjugates with respect to Y2 and Y3. Let L, M, N be midpoints of BC,\nCA, AB. We note that BY2 = \\\\{BC + CA + AB) = CYZ, so that L is also the\nmidpoint of Y^YZ. From the harmonic relation just proved we see that LP.LS=\nLY*=LY*\n\n10 CIRCLES [1.4 Now let LX be the tangent at L to the circle LMN, where X is\non the same side of BC as N. Then Z.XLN = /_NML = l_ABC. Hence the angle\nbetween LX and CA = /_ABC. It follows that LX is || to the fourth common\ntangent of the two excircles, the common tangent through S other than BC. Now\nsince LP.LS = LY22 = LYS2, the nine-point circle LMN is the inverse of this\nfourth common tangent with respect to the circle centre L and radius LY2. For\nthis nine-point circle contains P, and inverts into the line through S\nparallel to the tangent to the circle at L. Also since the circle of inversion\ncuts both excircles orthogonally, each excircle inverts into itself. We have\nseen that the inverse of the nine-point circle touches these excircles. It\nfollows that the nine-point circle touches the excircles centres E2, E3. In\nprecisely the same way we can show that the nine-point circle touches the\nincircle and the excircle opposite A. 4. Extension of Ptolemy's theorem If A,\nB,C, D are any four points in a plane, then AB.CD + A~D.BG > AC.BD, unless A,\nB, C, D lie, in the order ABCD, on a circle or a straight line. In the latter\ncase, the inequality becomes an equality. This is proved by noting the\ninfluence of inversion on the length of a segment. If the points P, Q invert\ninto the points P', Q', with 0 as centre of inversion, then OPQ and OQ'P' are\nsimilar triangles. Hence P'Q' OP' OP.OP' _ k2 so that PQ OQ OP.OQ OP.OQ p,0,\n_k2PQ .\n\n1.5] fermat's problem 11 Now, given the four points A, B,C, D, we invert with\nrespect to A. Let B', C, D' be the respective inverses of B, C, D. Then B'C +\nCD' > B'D' unless C lies on the line B'D' between B' and D'. In the latter\ncase we have B'C + CD' = B'D'. The first inequality becomes BC CD BD AB.AC +\nACAD > AB.AD ' or AB.CD + AD.BC > AC.BD, unless C lies on the line B'D'\nbetween B' and D', in which case A, B, C, D lie on a circle in the order ABCD,\nor on a straight line. 5. Fermat's problem A, B,C are any three 'points in a\nplane. To find a point P such that PA + PB + PC shall be least. Let B and C be\nthe acute angles of the triangle ABC. On BC, and away from A, describe an\nequilateral triangle BCD. Then by the extension of Ptolemy's theorem, unless P\nlies on the circle BCD so that the order of the points is BPCD, we have BP.CD\n+ PC.DB > PD.BC, or PB + PC> PD, since CD = DB = BC Therefore PA + PB + PC >\nPA + PD.\n\n12 CIRCLES [1.6 Now, unless P lies on AD, we have PA -f PD > AD. Hence, unless\nP is at P' (the other intersection of AD with the circle BCD), we have PA + PB\n+ PC> AD. But if P is at P', both the above inequalities become equalities; so\nthat P'A + P'B + P'C = AD. Hence P'A + P'P + P'C < PA + PP -f PC. Therefore P'\nis the required point. If /_BAG = 120°, A = P', and A is the required point.\nIf /_BAC > 120°, A is still the required point. 6. The centres of similitude\nof two circles Fig. 18 These points have already appeared in some of our\nproofs. We now define them. External centre of similitude. Let # and *€' be\ntwo circles of unequal radii, with centres C and C. Let CP and CP' be parallel\nradii drawn in the same sense. Then it is clear that P'P cuts C'C in a fixed\npoint 0, which divides C'C externally in the ratio of the radii of the two\ncircles. This is the external centre of similitude. If the ratio of the radii\n= k, then OP' : OP = k. We also have OP. OQ = constant. Therefore OP'.OQ =\nconstant.\n\n1.6]thb centres op similitude of two circlbs18 It follows that with centre of\nInversion 0, and a suitable radius of inversion, # can be inverted into W.\nFig. 20 Internal centre of similitude. Here the radii of the circles # and *€'\nmay be equal. CP and C'P' are parallel radii in opposite senses. P'P cuts C'C\nin a fixed point 0', the internal centre of similitude, which divides C'C\ninternally in the ratio of the radii. Direct common tangents of # and W', if\nthey exist, cut the line of centres in 0, and transverse common tangents, if\nthey exist, cut the line of centres in 0'. If # and <€' are concentric, the\ncommon centre is both the internal and external centre of similitude. If # and\n*€' touch externally, that is, if they lie on opposite sides of the tangent at\nthe point of contact, this point is the internal centre of similitude. If the\ncircles touch internally, the point of contact is the external centre. If we\nhave three circles, no two of which have equal radii, and the centres of which\nform a triangle, the six centres of similitude\n\n14 CIRCLES [1.7 lie in threes on four straight lines. This is easily proved, using the theorem of Menelaus. 7. Coaxal systems of circles These are best introduced by using the methods of coordinate geometry. The equation of any line passing through the origin of coordinates in the (x,y) -plane may be written as Xx + fit/ = 0. These lines are said to form a pencil of lines, and the equation of the system depends linearly on two distinct lines of the pencil, given by x = 0 and y = 0. Similarly, ifw = aa; + &t/ + c = 0 and v = a'x + b'y -f c' = 0 are any two distinct lines, the line Aw + [W = 0 represents, for suitable A, [x, any line through the intersection of u = 0 and v = 0. When we consider two distinct circles # and W, given by the equations C = s' + t/2 + 2gs + 2/t/ + c = 0, C = x* + t/2 + 2g'x + 2/'t/ + c' = 0, the system AC + fiC = 0, derived linearly from them, is a system of circles, since it may also be written as X2 | y% | Wte + vtf) , W + hT) Ac + ^_0 A + fi A + fi A + fi If (a',t/') is a point of intersection of # and W, C{x',y') = C'{x',y') = 0, that is, the point satisfies the equations of both circles. Since also, for all values of A, p, XC(x',y') + (iC'OrV) = 0, this same point lies on all circles of the system AC + y.C = 0. Such a system of circles therefore passes through the points of intersection (if any) of # and <€'. The system may be described as a pencil of circles, but for reasons which will soon become clear, we give it the more normal title of a coaxal system of circles. A geometrical meaning may be given to the ratio of the parameters A : p. Let P (x',y') be any point in the plane, and let any line through P cut # in Q and JR. Then it is elementary that the product PQ.PB = x'* + t/'2 + 2gx' + 2/y + c.\n\n1.7] COAXAL SYSTEMS OF CIRCLES 15 This constant, which is > 0 if P is outside\nthe circle and equal to the square of the tangent from P to #, is called, in\nall cases, the power of P with respect to #. If P is inside #, the power is\nnegative, and it is zero, of course, if P is on <€. Since AC + (iC = 0 may be\nwritten as a = -c; (ji C we see that the locus of a point which moves so that\nthe ratio of its powers with respect to two given circles # and *€' is a\nconstant is a circle of the coaxal system determined by %> and W. A particular\nand important member of the system is obtained by taking the ratio of the\npowers to be unity. We then obtain C - C - 2(g - g')x + 2(/ - f')y + c - c' =\n0, a straight line, called the radical axis of the system. If # and #'\nintersect, this line is the common chord of the two circles, and it is evident\nthat points on the common chord of two circles do have equal powers with\nrespect to each circle. But the radical axis Fig. 21 exists even if the\ncircles do not intersect. It is easily verified that the radical axis of two\ncircles is perpendicular to the line of centres. We deduce that the midpoints\nof the common tangents of two circles lie on a line which is perpendicular to\nthe line of centres. We obtain the same coaxal system of circles if we take\nany two distinct members of the system XC -\\\\- \\xC = 0, say d = \\XG + (j^C =\n0, and Ca s AaC + (iaC = 0,\n\n16 CIRCLES [1.8 where A^x ^ Aa/(xa, and write down the system of circles which\ndepend linearly on Cx and Ca. This should be verified. Another theorem of\nimportance is that any two circles of a coaxal system have the same radical\naxis. This explains the term coaxal system. We can verify this directly. The\nradical axis of Gx and C2 is [ Ax + (ij Aa + (ia J L Ai + (ix Aa + fia J + pic\n+ W _ Aac + tA2c,\"[ = 0 L Ax + ^ Aa + (ia J This easily reduces to (AlfAa-\nVi)P*fo- 0') + %(/-f)+e- C] = 0. It follows that the centres of all circles of\na coaxal system lie on a line perpendicular to the radical axis. This is also\nclear from the fact that the centre of AC + [iC = 0 is the point TA(- g) + nC-\ngO A(-/)+tx(-/Q1 . L A + (i ' A + (ji J In the next chapter we shall need to\nbe familiar with a few more properties of coaxal systems, and we derive them\nhere. 8. Canonical form for coaxal system The line of centres and the radical\naxis of a coaxal system offer, in a sense, a natural system of coordinate axes\nfor the system. We take the line of centres as the avaxis, and the radical\naxis as the t/-axis, and see what form the equation of the system takes. Since\ntheir centres are on the a>axis, any two circles # and #' have equations of\nthe form, C = x2 + y2 + 2gx + c = 0, and C = x2 + y2 + 2g'x + c' = 0. The\nradical axis of these two circles is C-C' = 2(g-g')x + c-c' = 0, and since\nthis is to be x = 0, we must have c = c'. The circles of the system may\ntherefore be written in the form x2 + y2 + 2Ax + c = 0,\n\n1.8] CANONICAL FORM FOR COAXAL SYSTEM 17 where c is constant, and A a\nparameter. This is a canonical, or standard form for a coaxal system. We note\nthat the system now depends linearly on the circle x* + V2 + c = 0> &na the\nradical axis x = 0. We can now easily distinguish between the intersecting and\nnon- intersecting type of coaxal system. Intersections, if any, must lie on\nthe radical axis x = 0. This meets circles of the system where t/a + c = 0. If\nc is positive, there are no intersections, and we have the non-intersecting\ntype of coaxal system. If c is negative, all circles of the system cut the\nradical axis in the same two points. (i) c = fea > 0\\. Any circle of the\nsystem may be written in the form (z + A)a + t/a = A2-fc2. For real circles,\nwe must have A2 ^ fc2. There are two circles of zero radius in the system,\nwith centres at (— ft, 0) and (k, 0). These points, which we denote by L and\nL', are called the limiting Fig. 22 points of the system. No circles of the\nsystem have their centres between L and L'. If a circle of the system cuts the\nline of centres in A, A', then OA.OA' = fc2 = OL*, and it follows that L and\nL' are harmonic conjugates with respect to A and A'. Hence any circle through\nL and L' cuts all circles of the coaxal system orthogonally.\n\n18 CIRCLES [1.8 (ii) c = — fc2 < 0\\. This case presents no features which are\nFig. 23 not evident geometrically. (iii) c = 0. This can be regarded as an\nintermediate case. Fig. 24 All circles of the system touch the radical axis,\nand the point of contact may be regarded as consisting of two coincident\nlimiting points. We have remarked that in (i) any circle through L and L' is\northogonal to every circle of the given system. The equation of a circle\nthrough L and L' is x2 + y2 + 2[i# - k2 = 0, and this, of course, is a coaxal\nsystem of the intersecting type. The orthogonality relation is evident\nalgebraically, since the condition to be satisfied, 2gg' + W' — c — c' = 0,\nbecomes here 2A.0 + 2.0.[a — k2 + k2 = 0, which is the case. Hence, associated\nwith every coaxal system of a given type there is a coaxal system of the\nopposite type, and the circles of one cut the circles of the other\northogonally. Such systems are called conjugate systems, for reasons which\nwill become clear in chapter II.\n\n1.9] FURTHER PROPERTIES 19 9. Further properties If we try to find the circles\nof the coaxal system x2 + y2 + 2Xx + c = 0 which pass through P(x',y'), we see\nthat (S'2 + I/'* + 0) . A - £,- , that is, there is a unique value of the\nparameter which determines the circle. Hence one circle of a coaxal system\npasses through a given point P. The construction of this circle is evident for\nintersecting systems, since a circle is determined by three points, but not so\nevident for a non-intersecting system. In this case we invoke the conjugate\nsystem, which is of the intersecting type, and draw the unique circle of this\nsystem which passes through P. We can then construct the required circle by\ndrawing the unique circle through P which is orthogonal to the constructed\ncircle and has its centre on the line of centres of the given coaxal system.\nIf we invert a coaxal system of circles, it is fairly clear that we obtain an\nintersecting coaxal system in the intersecting case, but this is not so clear\nin the non-intersecting case. However we can bring in the conjugate system,\nwhich is of the intersecting type, and remembering that circles which are\northogonal invert into orthogonal circles, we see that the circles of the non-\nintersecting system invert into circles which are orthogonal to all the\ncircles of a coaxal system. Such a system of circles must form the conjugate\ncoaxal system. However, inversion is a transformation which sometimes does\nmore than we demand of it, and the reader may feel reluctant to accept the\nproof indicated when we show, as we do now, that any non-intersecting system\nof coaxal circles may be inverted into a system of concentric circles. The\nquestion he will ask is: if a system of concentric circles is a coaxal system,\nwhy have we not come across it in the above treatment? We leave the reader to\nponder on this apparent paradox, and prove the theorem. Let L and L' be the\nlimiting points of the non-intersecting coaxal system, and invert with respect\nto a circle centre L. Then the circles of the system invert into circles which\nare orthogonal to the inverses of all circles through L and L'. But these\ninverses are straight lines through a fixed point, the\n\n20 CIRCLES [1.9 inverse of L'. Hence the coaxal system inverts into a system\nof concentric circles, with centre at the inverse of L'. This theorem provides\na solution of the attractive problem: Fig. 25 given two circles # and #', one\nlying inside the other, can we find a chain of circles, ^v #2, #3,.. ., #n,\nall of which touch # and #', such that <€x touches #2 &nd ^n» *^2 touches #3\nand <€v .. ., <€n touches <£n_x and Vf Inverting # and #' into concentric\ncircles, we see that the Fig. 26 problem does not always have a solution, but\nthat when there is a solution, we can begin the chain by drawing any circle\nwhich touches # and *&\", and can then fit in the other members of the chain in\nan obvious manner. We conclude this discussion of coaxal circles by\nconsidering the radical axes, in pairs, of three circles #, #', <&\"\". The\nintersection\n\n1.10] PROBLEM OF APOLLONIUB 21 of two of these radical axes is a point which\nhas equal powers with respect to all three circles. This point is therefore on\nthe third radical axis. Hence, if they are not parallel, the radical axes of\nthe three pairs of circles which can be formed from three given circles are\nconcurrent. The point of concurrence is called the radical centre of the three\ncircles. The circle which has its centre at the radical centre, and radius\nequal to the length of the tangent from the centre to any one of the three\ncircles, if it lies outside one, and therefore all three circles, cuts each of\nthe three circles orthogonally and is the only circle which does this. With\nrespect to this circle as circle of inversion, each of the three circles\ninverts into itself. 10. Problem of Apollonius Given three circles <gx, <€%\nand #3, to draw a circle touching all three. We need two preliminary results:\nFig. 27 (i) If two non-concentric circles Jfv Ctif2 touch two other non-\nconcentric circles <ffx, ^^aX A,B and C, D respectively, and if the contacts\nat C and D are of like* or unlike type according as those at A and B are, then\nAB and CD meet in a centre of similitude of the circles JfvJf a»or t^ey ar©\nparallel to the line of centres of these circles. To prove this result we join\nthe centres of Jfv Jf2 and <€x and find, using the theorem of Menelaus, where\nAB cuts the line joining the centres oiJfvJf2. If the given conditions are\nsatisfied, and we consider the triangle formed by the centres of JFX, t\nContacts are of \" like type \" when both are external or both are internal.\n\n22 CIRCLES [1.10 Ofa and #a» w© s©© tna* C-D passes through the same point X,\nand that this is a centre of similitude of Ctifx and Jf2. (ii) We remarked\nearlier (see page 12) that XA .XB = XC.XD, so that X is on the radical axis of\n*€x and #2- We also note that if the contacts at A and B are of like or unlike\ntype according as those at C and D are, then the contacts at A and C are of\nlike or unlike type according as those at B and D are. Therefore AC and BD\nmeet at a centre of similitude of *€x and #2» and this centre is on the\nradical axis of.uK i)*% 2* We have therefore shown that the radical axis of\n<gx and #2 contains a centre of similitude of Ctifx and Jf2, and the radical\naxis of Xx and Jf 2 contains a centre of similitude of ^x and #2- We now\nreturn to our problem, and assume, for simplicity, that the radii of ^x, #2>\n*^3 are three distinct numbers, so that all the centres of similitude exist.\nLet Jf 0 be a circle touching the three circles externally. Inverse. 28 sion\nfrom the radical centre of ^x, #2> *^3 changes these circles into themselves,\nand Jf0 is transformed into a circle $fx which is touched internally by the\nthree circles. The joins of the points of contact of each circle #< (i = 1, 2,\n3) with Jf0 and withjJf! pass through the radical centre. The pole, for <SX,\nof the line joining the points of contact of Jf0 and *€x and of Ctifx and <€x\nis the intersection of the tangents at these points of contact. These tangents\nare the radical axes\n\n1.11] COMPASS GEOMETRY 23 of Jf0 and #! and of tf± and ^ft, and since the\nradical axes of three circles, taken in pairs, are concurrent, this pole lies\non the radical axis of Jf0&ndX'v By the reciprocal property of pole and polar,\nthe polar of this point contains the pole, for ^v of the radical axis. Now the\npolar is the line joining the points of contact of CV0 and ^x and of Jf! and\n#! and passes through the radical centre of ^ #2, #3. Since also the radical\naxis of Jf0 and $fx contains the external centres of similitude of the circles\n<&v #2> ^3 taken in pairs (this was proved in (ii) above), we have the\nfollowing construction, due to Gergonne: Draw the line through the external\ncentres of similitude of <&v ^2 and ^3, taken in pairs, and join its poles for\neach of these circles to the radical centre of the three circles. These joins\ncut the given circles in points of contact of two of the required circles. The\ncentres of similitude of ^v ^2» ^3 he by threes on four lines, and each line\nof centres of similitude gives two tangent circles. In the most favourable\ncase we therefore expect to find eight solutions of the problem of Apollonius.\nWe shall verify this from another point of view in chapter II. 11. Compass\ngeometry We conclude this chapter by showing how the straight edge may be\ndispensed with in the elementary constructions of Euclidean geometry. A\nstraight edge is used to connect two given points by a straight line. No pair\nof compasses will do this. At the same time the straight edge and compasses\nare primarily used to determine certain points. The fundamental problems in\nEuclidean geometry are: (i) to find the intersections of two circles, the\ncentre and radius of each being given; (ii) to find the intersection of a line\ngiven by two points with a circle given by its centre and radius; (iii) to\nfind the intersections of two lines, each given by two points. The solution of\n(i) is naturally possible using only the compasses. Problems (ii) and (iii)\nreduce to (i) after inversion.\n\n24 CIRCLES [1.11 Therefore, to show that all Euclidean constructions are\npossible using only a pair of compasses, we must show: (a) how to find the\ninverse of a given point in a circle of given centre and radius; (b) how to\nfind the centre of a circle which is to pass through three given points. We\ngave the solution of (a) in §2, page 5. Before dealing with (b), we show how\nto find, using compasses only, the midpoint of the segment determined by two\ngiven points. In the first place we show how to extend a given segment AO to\n.0. Fig. 29 twice its length. Draw the circle centre 0 and radius OA, and mark\noff the chords AP = PQ = QA' = OA. Then AOA' is a straight line, and A A' =\n%0A. We can now find the midpoint of the segment OA. Extend AO to A', where AO\n= OA', and find the inverse of A' in the Fig. 30 circle centre A and radius\nAO. If A\" is the inverse, A A'. A A' = A0\\ and since AA' = %A0, the point A\"\nis the midpoint of OA. We can extend OA to A', where OA' = nOA, n being any\npositive integer, and the inverse of A' in the circle centre A and radius AO\ngives OAjn.\n\n1.11] COMPASS GEOMETRY 25 (b) Let A, B, C be the three given points. Invert\nwith respect to the circle centre A and radius AB. The circle ABC inverts Fig.\n31 into the line BC, where C is the inverse of C in the circle of inversion.\nThis point can be constructed. The centre of circle ABC inverts into the\ninverse of the centre of inversion, which is A, in the inverse of circle ABC,\nnamely, the line BC (see §2, page 9). The inverse of A in BC is the\ngeometrical image of A in BC. This is easily constructed, as indicated in Fig.\n81. If this geometrical image be 0', we finally find the inverse of 0' in the\ncircle of inversion. This final point 0 is the centre of circle ABC. The\nreader should carry out this construction for himself. To find where two lines\ndetermined by points A,B and C,D respectively meet, we invert with respect to\nany suitable circle, centre 0, say. If the respective inverse points are A',B'\nand C,D', the intersection of the circles OA'B' and OCD', other than 0, is the\ninverse of the point required. We can draw these circles, by the above\nconstruction, and find this point. Bright students often rediscover this\ncompass geometry for themselves, and are dashed to find that it was fully\ninvestigated, without the benefit of inversion, by Mascheroni in La Geometria\ndel Compasso, Pa via, 1797.\n\nCHAPTER II 1. Representation of a circle In this chapter we adopt a completely\ndifferent point of view from that pursued in the first chapter. We note that\nthe equation of a circle is C = x* + y* + 2gx + <lfy + c = 0, (1) and that\nthis equation contains three parameters (g,f, c). If we are given the values\nof these parameters, we are given the circle *€ represented by the equation C\n= 0. Conversely, the equation of a circle # can be written in only one way in\nthe form (1). Hence, any circle can be represented by the three numbers (g,f,\nc). It is natural to think of three numbers (g,f, c) as giving the three\ncoordinates of a point P in three-dimensional space. We shall amplify -this\nstatement in a moment. But assuming that we understand what is implied by the\nterm \" three-dimensional space \", we can now say that circles in the\n(a;,i/)-plane can be represented by points in three-dimensional space (x, y,\ne). In this chapter we shall study the properties of this representation. 2.\nEuclidean three-space, Ez Let Ox, Oy, Oe be three mutually perpendicular\nstraight lines drawn through a point 0. If P is any point, we consider the\nFig. 32 perpendiculars PL, PM and PN drawn from P to the planes Oys, Osx and\nOxy respectively. The distance LP measures the 26\n\n2.2] EUCLIDEAN THREE-SPACE, Et 27 x-coordinate of P, and is positive if LP is\nin the direction Ox, negative if it is in the opposite direction. Similarly\nfor the y- and ^-coordinates of P. If the coordinates of P are (xvyve^), P is\nthe intersection of the three planes x = xv y = yv and 0 = ex. We do not\nintend to develop the coordinate geometry of E3, but a few results are\nessential for our purpose. The perpendicular from P (xx,yx,Bx) on to the line\nOb is easily seen to be y/{xx2 + Vi2)- Fig. 33 If we imagine the parabola in\nthe (s,t) plane whose equation is 0 — t2 = 0, this parabola touches the t-axis\nat the origin. If we rotate the parabola about the £-axis, we obtain a\nparaboloid of revolution. Since the perpendicular from any point P (x,y,e) of\nthe paraboloid on to the a-axis = y/{x2 + V2) = * = V0' we ^ave x2 + y2 — a =\n0 for the equation of the paraboloid. This surface will play an important part\nin our investigations. The only other fact we shall need is that the\nJoachimstahl ratio- formulae continue to hold in E3. In other words, if P\n(x,y,e) and Q (x',y',8') are two points in Es, the point which divides PQ in\nthe ratio A : 1 has coordinates fx + Xx' y + Xy' 0 + AA U+A ' 1+A ' 1+A/' This\nis derived immediately from the formula in the two-dimensional case by\nprojecting P, Q and the point whose coordinates are required on to the plane\nOxy, say.\n\n28 CIRCLES [2.8 We now return to the representation of a circle <€. It is more\nconvenient to take its equation in the form C = x2 + y2 - 2£c - 2% + £ = 0 (1)\nrather than that given by Eq. (1), §1. For the centre of # is (i,rf), and if\nwe suppose that # lies in the plane Oxy of E3, and represent # by the point P\n(£,i?,£)> the orthogonal projection of P on to the plane Oxy is the centre of\nthe circle *€ which is represented by the point P. 3. First properties of the\nrepresentation The square of the radius of the circle <& given by (1) is £2 +\nr\\2— £• Circles of zero radius are represented by points P (x,y,£) which\nsatisfy the equation Q = x2 + y2 - a = 0. (1) As we saw in §2, this equation\nrepresents a paraboloid of revolution. This paraboloid Q plays a fundamental\npart in our investigation. If, at the point (x,yt0), we erect a perpendicular\nto the n \\p / X 0f,y,o) y Fig. 34 plane Oxy, this meets Q in a unique point P,\nwhich represents the circle centre (x,y,0) and of zero radius. Points above P\n(in an obvious sense) have a a- coordinate which exceeds that of P, and\ntherefore represent circles the square of whose radius is negative. We call\nsuch circles imaginary circles, noting that the centre of such a circle is a\nreal point. Points below P represent real circles, or the ordinary circles of\ngeometry. Since points above P he inside Q, and points below P lie outside Q,\nwe see that the paraboloid separates the points which represent real circles\nfrom those which represent imaginary circles.\n\n2.41 COAXAL SYSTEMS 29 The preceding remarks also show that circles of a\nsystem of concentric circles are represented by the points of a line through\nthe common centre and perpendicular to the Oa^-plane. 4. Coaxal systems The\ncoaxal system defined by the two circles # and #', where #' is given by the\nequation C' = x* + y*- 2?x - tyy + £' = 0, is given by the equation x* +\nyt-2ix-toiy+l + X[x* +1 - 2?x - tyy + £']=0, which, for our purpose, must be\nwritten in the form x* \"-«[^-«[^' + ra-* + AJ U+A The representative point is\ntherefore + A' f+A & r+A ■)■ This point is on the line PP', where P represents\n<&, and P' represents ^\". Hence the circles of a coaxal system are represented\nby the points of a line in E3. Any two distinct points of a given line in E3\ndetermine the line. Hence we see once more that any two distinct circles of a\ncoaxal system determine the coaxal system. The line PP' will meet the\nparaboloid Q in two, one or no real points. Intersections with Q correspond to\nzero circles, or limiting points, in the coaxal system. Hence the line\nrepresenting a non-intersecting system of coaxal circles meets Q in real Fig.\n35 points, whereas the line representing an intersecting system of coaxal\ncircles does not meet Q.\n\n80 CIRCLES [2.5 A pair of points in the Oan/-plane determines a coaxal system\nby the condition that the circles of the system should pass through both\npoints. This coaxal system determines a line in E3. Two lines in Ez which meet\nrepresent coaxal systems which have one circle in common. If both systems are\nof intersecting types, and the common points of one are P, P', and of the\nother Q, Q', it follows in this case that P, P', Q, Q' are concyclic. Bearing\nthese facts in mind, we see that known theorems in E3 yield theorems for\ncoaxal systems of circles. We give two examples. 5. Deductions from the\nrepresentation Let I, m be two skew lines in E3, and V a point which does not\nlie on either line. Through V we can draw a unique line n which Fig. 36 will\nmeet both I and m, that is, a unique transversal of I and m. This line n must\nlie in the plane obtained by joining I to V, and it must also he in the plane\nobtained by joining m to V. These two planes intersect in a line through V,\nand this is the required line n. If there were two such lines n, I and m would\nbe coplanar, contrary to hypothesis. We translate this theorem into its plane\nequivalent: Let I and m both represent intersecting coaxal systems, one\ndefined by the points P, P', the other by the points Q, Q'. Since I and m do\nnot meet, the coaxal systems do not have a common circle, and the four points\nP, P', Q, Q', are not concyclic. The point V represents a circle # which is\nnot a member of either coaxal system. The line n gives a coaxal system which\ncontains <€. If this third system is also of the intersecting type, let JB,\nJR' be the points which define it. These points lie on c€.\n\n2.5] DEDUCTIONS PROM THE REPRESENTATION 81 Since n meets both I and m, there\nis a circle common to the systems represented by I and n, and there is also a\ncircle common to the systems represented by m and n. Hence P, P', B, B' are\nconcyclic, and so are Q, Q', B, B'. The plane theorem becomes: P> P\\ Q> Q' aw\njour points which are not concyclic, and do not lie on a given circle f€. Then\nthere is a unique fair of points B, B' on <& such that P, P', B, B' and Q, Q',\nB, B' are respectively concyclic. This theorem may, of course, be proved\ndirectly. If we draw circles through P, P', their common chords with <€ form a\npencil of lines. This hint should enable the reader to complete the proof.\nFig. 37 Our second example is derived from a theorem in E3 which it would take\nus too long to prove here: Four lines in E3 have two, one, or an infinity of\ntransversals. The proof involves the general theory of quadric surfaces, and\nis beyond our scope in this book. From the preceding discussion we rapidly\narrive at the following theorem: Given four pairs of points P,P', Q,Q', B,B',\nS,S' in a plane, the problem of finding another pair X,X' such that PP'XX',\nQQ'XX', BB'XX' and SS'XX' are respectively concyclic admits of two, one or an\ninfinity of solutions. It would not be so easy to give a direct proof of this\ntheorem.\n\n82 circles [2.6 6. Conjugacy relations Let ^x and tfa be two circles. Then,\nwith the usual notation, Eta. 38 we find the condition that they intersect at\nan angle a. The respective centres are (£vr)J and (i^Vz)' and the radii from\nthe centres to a point of intersection enclose an angle a or tc — a. The\ncosine formula gives the relation (*i ~ ^a + Oh - V*)2 = (!i2 + Vi2 - W + (faa\n+ Vz2 ~ U ± 2(f ia + Vi2 ~ .«* (iz2 + V22 - W1 cos a. This becomes ««■ + *wh —\nCi—C. = T 2(f!« + ^ - W* (f aa + 7,aa - £,)* cos a, which is more useful in\nthe form (2^8 + 9m. - fc - «■ = *(f i2 + V - W (f aa + 7jaa - O cosa a. (1) We\nfirst examine two special cases: (i) a = 0. The circles #! and <€i touch. If\nwe take the variable point (fl + Afr, ^ + A?', Cl + AM on the line \\ 1 +A 1 +A\n1 +A / PiP2> this point lies on £ if and only if (*i + Afa)2 + (tjx + At,,)2 -\n(1 + A) (£x + AW = 0. As a quadratic in A this becomes Aa(£a2 + Vz2 ~ £t) +\nA(2fif. + Shw, - d - « + (* ia + V - W = 0. (2) The condition (1) with cos a =\n1 is just the condition that the quadratic (2) should have equal roots. Hence,\nif the circles #! and <&2 touch, the line PxPt touches Q. But the\nintersections of this line with Q give the limiting points of the coaxal\nsystem determined by <€x and #2. We deduce that a necessary and\n\n2.6] OONJUGAOY RELATIONS 88 sufficient condition that two circles touch is\nthat the limiting points of the coaxal system they determine should coincide,\n(ii) a = £tc. In this case (1) becomes simply 2^2 + ^7,2-^-^ = 0. (8) Prom (2)\nwe see that this condition implies that the roots of the quadratic are of the\nform fc, — fc. Hence the intersections of PiP2 with Q divide PiP2 internally\nand externally in the same ratio. That is, the four points form a harmonic\nrange, and Pi,Pa are conjugate points with respect to Q. Hence orthogonality\nimplies conjugacy, and conversely. The locus of points conjugate, with respect\nto Q, to the fixed point (£',t)',£') is given by the equation 2a*' +\n2i/,?'-s-r = 0. (4) This represents a plane in E3, the polar plane of\n(f',i/,£'). The points of this plane represent the circles orthogonal to the\ncircle x* + y* - 2f x - <2tq'y + T = 0. (5) The plane given by (4) meets Q in\na conic. If (x,y,e) is a point on this conic, e = x2 -f- y2, and since (4) is\nsatisfied, we have 2a*' + 2yr,' - (x* + y*) - £ = 0, which is the same\nequation as (5). The projection of the point (x,y,e) on to the plane Oxy is\nthe point (x,y,0), and we have proved W.C) Fig. 39 that the projection of the\nconic in which the polar plane of a point in E3 meets Q is precisely the\ncircle represented by the point. We may see this from another point of view.\nThe points of the conic cut on Q represent point circles, that is, circles of\nzero radius, orthogonal to the circle given by (5). It is easily verified that\nif a point circle is orthogonal to a given circle, the centre of the point\ncircle must lie on the given circle. Hence the projection of the conic on to\nthe plane Oxy is bound to give the circle itself.\n\n84 CIRCLES [2-6 The polar plane of the point /fi + Af, ih+Ag, Ci±Kj\\ \\ 1 + A '\n1 +A ' 1+A /' which, as A varies, describes the line P^v is\n„(^)+s,(3i±$,)_t_(^)_a This may be written in the form 2«i + 2^i - { - fi +\nA(2«, + 2^ - £ - £2) = 0, which shows that the polar plane always passes\nthrough a fixed line, given by the intersection of the polar planes of Px and\nof P2- If we call this line V, and call P^^ I, any point on I is conjugate to\nevery point of V, and therefore any point on V is conjugate to every point of\nI. Two such lines are called polar lines, and they represent conjugate coaxal\nsystems. If I meets Q in the points P, P', the polar planes of these points\nare the respective tangent planes at the points to Q, and these tangent planes\nwill contain V. If I meets Q, and so represents a non-intersecting system of\ncoaxal circles, V will not meet Q. The tangent plane at P represents the\ncircles orthogonal to the point-circle represented by P, that is, the circles\nwhich pass through the projection of P on to the Ox«/-plane. Hence, V\nrepresents the circles which pass through the limiting points of the coaxal\nsystem represented by I. Again, the projection of I on to the plane Oxy gives\nthe line of centres of the coaxal system represented by I. Hence polar lines\nproject into perpendicular lines. We can easily find a tetrahedron in Ez which\nis self-polar: that is, every face is the polar plane of the opposite vertex.\nChoose any point P not on Q, and let n be its polar plane. Choose any point Q\nin n not on Q, and let n' be its polar plane, iz' contains P and meets n in a\nline I. Choose any point R on I not on Q. Its polar plane contains P and Q and\nmeets I in S. Then it is clear that PQRS is a self-polar tetrahedron. Since\npolar lines project into perpendicular lines, and the opposite edges of PQRS\nare polar lines, we see that if four circles are mutually orthogonal, each\nbeing orthogonal to the other three, then their centres form a triangle and\nits orthocentre. It can be shown that one vertex of a self-polar tetrahedron\nmust lie inside Q. Hence, one of the four mutually orthogonal circles must be\nimaginary.\n\n2.7] CIRCLES CUTTING AT A GIVEN ANGLE 85 7. Circles cutting at a given angle\nWe now return to the general relation (1) of the previous section, and see\nthat the points representing circles which cut a fixed circle <£\" at an angle\na. or k — a. satisfy the equation 4(z2 + i/2 - «) (f» + t?'2 - £') COS2 a =\n(2atf' + 2i/V - 0 - n»- (1) This represents a quadric surface, and the form of\nits equation shows that it has ring-contact with Q along the intersection of Q\nwith the plane 2x£' + 2*/t?' - « - T = 0. (2) If the reader is unfamiliar with\nthe idea of ring-contact he need not be disturbed, since it is only the\nalgebraic form of (1) which will concern us. We know already that the curve in\nwhich the plane given by (2) meets Q projects into the circle <£\" itself. We\nwish to investigate the circles which cut three given circles #!, #2 and #3 at\nangles a. or k — a.. To do this, we must examine the common intersections of\nthe three quadric surfaces: 4(z2 + i/2 - 0) (£r2 + r?r2 - &) cos2« = (2x$r +\n2yr,r - B ~ fr)2 (f = 1, % 8). For the sake of brevity we write these\nequations as 4(x2 + j/2 - e)kr cos2 a = Xr2 (r = 1, 2, 8), (8) where Av is a\nconstant, and Xr = 0 is the polar plane of (£r,i?r,£r). If we equate the\ncommon value of x2 + y2 — 0 in the three equations, we obtain the equations\n/Cj /C2 K3 We note that these equations do not depend on cos a. If we take\nthem in pairs, the system is equivalent to fvT, *x ± Vfci *, = o, < (4)\n[VFix*± VF2x3 = o. Taking all the possible combinations of signs, we have four\nsets of two linear equations in x, y, 0. Since two planes determine a line,\nthe solutions of (4) lie on four straight lines. Since Xx = X2 = X3 = 0\nautomatically satisfies (4), these four lines all pass through the point\ndetermined by the intersection of the polar planes of (£r,77r,£r) (r=l,2,8).\nThis point represents the circle orthogonal to the three given circles.\n\n86 CIRCLES [2.8 Each one of the lines determined by (4) meets each one of the\nthree quadrics given by (8) in the same two points. Hence there are eight\nsolutions of the equations, for a given value of cos a, and we have proved the\nfollowing theorem: There are eight circles which intersect three given circles\nat a given angle a. or % — a.. As the angle a varies the circles vary in four\ncoaxal systems with a common circle, the circle orthogonal to the three given\ncircles. The case a = 0 gives the solution of the problem of Apollonius (see\nchapter I, §10). Since each one of the lines determined by (4) gives two\nsolutions of (8), each one of the four coaxal systems contains two of the\ncircles which satisfy the given conditions. 8. Representation of inversion Let\nA, A' be inverse points in a circle #. Then # is orthogonal to any circle\nthrough A and A', and *€ is a member of the coaxal 'system which is determined\nby the limiting points A, A'. Let P represent the circle #. The zero circles\ncentres A, A' are represented by points on Q. By the remark above, P is\ncollinear with these two points on Q. Since P is regarded as fixed, and A, A'\nas variable, we have the following method for finding the inverse, in a given\ncircle *€, of a given curve, 2, say: Fig. 40 Erect perpendiculars to the plane\nOxy at the points of 2, and let & be the curve in which these perpendiculars\nmeet Q. The cone\n\n2.9] THE ENVELOPE OF A SYSTEM 87 of lines joining P to the points of & meets Q\nin a further curve £'. Project &' down on to the plane Oxy. The resulting\ncurve 2' is the inverse of 2 in c€. We remark that this construction shows at\nonce that the eight circles which were discussed in the preceding section are\ninverse in pairs in the common orthogonal circle of the three circles. Since\neach of the three given circles inverts into itself with respect to the common\northogonal circle, this result is to be expected. If the curve 2 to be\ninverted is a circle, we know that the curve S obtained by projecting it on to\nQ is a plane section. The cone of lines joining P to the points of $ is a\nquadric cone, and since the inverse of a circle is another circle, this cone\nmeets Q again in a further plane section &'. Again, a circle, the circle of\ninversion and the inverse circle are coaxal, so that we obtain the theorem: A\nquadric cone which meets Q in one plane section will meet it again in another\nplane section, and the poles oj the two plane sections are collinear with the\nvertex oj the cone. The more advanced reader will realize that this is a\nprojective theorem, and is therefore true for any quadric Q. 9. The envelope\nof a system We may measure the complexity of a system of circles by the\ncomplexity of the curve in Ez which represents the system. From this point of\nview a coaxal system of circles is the simplest kind of system, since a line\nis the simplest curve in Ez. A coaxal system of circles has no envelope: that\nis, there is no curve touched by all circles of the system. For intersecting\nsystems we may, if we wish, say that the envelope consists of the two points\ncommon to all circles of the system. But interesting envelopes only appear\nwhen we consider conic systems oj circles. A conic system of circles is one\nrepresented by a conic in Ez. A conic is a plane curve, and this plane will\nhave a pole with respect to Q. This pole represents a circle which is\northogonal to all the circles of the conic system. Again, the projection of\nthe conic on to the plane Oxy is, except in one special case, a conic, and\ngives the locus of centres of circles of the conic system. Hence the centres\nof circles of a conic system lie on a conic, and all circles of the system are\northogonal to a fixed circle.\n\n88 CIRCLES [2.9 These two properties serve to define a conic system, since the\nsecond property restricts the representative points to lie in a plane, and the\nintersection of a conical cylinder and a plane is a conic. We now find the\nenvelope of a conic system of circles. Let the curve touched by all circles of\nthe system be <?, and suppose that the circle *€ touches it at the point A. A\ncircle of the system \" near \" to # will intersect ^ in a point which is \" near\n\" to A. In the limit the intersection of # and a neighbouring circle of the\nconic system includes the point of contact of # with $. It can be shown that\nall circles of the system touch the locus of ultimate intersections of\nneighbouring circles, so that all circles of the system touch the envelope at\ntwo points. Let C be the conic in E3 which represents the conic system of\ncircles. If P is the point on C which represents #, the tangent to C at P\nrepresents the coaxal system defined by # and its neighbouring circle. The\ncommon points of this coaxal system are the points on $ we wish to determine.\nNow the line in E3 polar to the tangent to C at P (with respect to Q)\nrepresents the conjugate coaxal system, whose limiting points are the points\non S required. If we find the intersections of this polar line with Q, and\nproject down on to the plane Oxy, we have the points we want. Therefore, to\nobtain the envelope of the system of circles represented by a curve C in Ez,\nwe find the curve in which lines polar to the tangents of C {with respect to\nQ) meet Q, and project this curve orthogonally on to the (x,y)-plane. The\nmethod applies to any curve C, but we are interested in the case in which C is\na conic. Then the lines polar to the tangents of C all pass through a fixed\npoint, the pole of the plane of C, and generate a quadric cone. Hence, the\nenvelope is the orthogonal projection of the curve in which a quadric cone\nmeets Q.\n\n2.10] SOME FURTHER APPLICATIONS 89 Now two quadrics intersect in a curve which\nis cut by a plane in four points, these points being the four intersections of\nthe respective conies in which the plane cuts the quadrics. Such a curve is\ncalled a quartic curve. If the quadric intersecting Q has the equation Q = ax2\n+ hy2 -\\\\- cs2 + 2fyts + Sgex + Qhxy + %ux + 2vt/ + 2wb + d = 0, the\northogonal projection of the intersection with Q is obtained by replacing 0,\nwherever it occurs in the equation, by x2 -f y2. We therefore obtain the curve\na*2 + by* + c(x2 + y2)2 + 2/t/(z2 + V2) + ^g{x2 + y2)x + Zhxy + 2ux + 2vy +\n2w(x2 + y2) + d = 0. This curve has double points at the circular points at\ninfinity, and is called a bicircular quartic curve. The envelope of a conic\nsystem of circles is therefore a bicircular quartic curve. The quartic curve\non Q is the intersection of two quadrics Q = 0 and Q = 0, and therefore the\npencil of quadrics Q + XQ = 0 passes through it. A pencil of quadrics contains\nfour cones. Hence four cones intersect Q in the quartic curve whose projection\ngives the envelope. One of these cones has appeared already, its generators\nbeing the polar lines of the tangents to the conic C which specified the conic\nsystem of circles. Since each quadric cone can be derived as the set of polar\nlines of tangents to a conic, we see that the bicircular quartic curve may be\nregarded as the envelope oifour systems of circles. Again, a conic in E3 meets\nQ in four points. Hence a conic system of circles contains four point-circles.\nSince a point-circle (x-a)2 + (y-b)2=0 may also be written in the form (i = y/\n— 1): [(X - a) + i(y - b)] [(x -a)- i(y - &)] == 0, a point-circle may also be\nregarded as the isotropic lines through the centre (a,b). If these touch a\ngiven curve, the point (a,b) is, by definition, a focus of the curve. Hence\nthe bicircular quartic we have obtained has sixteen foci. It is easy to see\nthat any bicircular quartic may be obtained in this way, and therefore has the\nproperties described above, but we shall not pursue the matter any further.\n10. Some further applications Let us suppose that we are given a plane\nalgebraic curve, of\n\n40 CIRCLES [2.10 equation f(x,y) = 0. This curve is touched by an infinity of\ncircles through the point (0,0). If such a circle is x% + t/2 - 2fr - to® = 0,\nfb,y)=0 Fig. 42 a relation g(£,rj) = 0 holds; that is, the centres of circles\nthrough (0,0) which touch a given curve $(x,y) = 0 lie on a curve g(x,y) = 0.\nWe may call this latter curve {he circle-tangential equation of the given\ncurve. We consider some examples. If the curve f(x,y) = 0 consists merely of\nthe point (a,fe), the circle through (0,0) has to pass through (a,b). The\nlocus of centres Fig. 43 of such circles is the perpendicular bisector of the\njoin of (a,b) and (0,0). If j(x,y) = 0 represents a line, the circle-\ntangential equation is Fig. 44 the locus of a point which moves so that its\ndistance from a fixed\n\n2.10] SOME FURTHER APPLICATIONS 41 point is always equal to its distance from\na fixed line. Thus the locus is a parabola, with (0,0) as focus and the line\nas directrix, fflnally, we consider the case when/(z,t/) = 0 is the circle X2\n+ y2 _ 2i'X - Zq'y + {' = 0. Fig. 45 There are two cases: (i) If (0,0) lies\ninside the circle (£' < 0), the circle-tangential equation is the locus of a\npoint which moves so that the sum of its distances from two fixed points,\n(0,0) and (£',V)> is constant. The locus is therefore an ellipse with these\npoints as foci. (ii) If (0,0) lies outside the circle (£' > 0), it is the\ndifference of the distances from (0,0) and (f',V) which is constant. The\ncircle-tangential equation is then a hyperbola with these points as foci. We\nmay apply the methods of the preceding section to finding the circle-\ntangential equation of a given curve ${x,y) = 0. When applied to the above\nexamples, we shall obtain some properties of the paraboloid Q. Let us suppose\nthen that g(x,y) = 0 is the circle-tangential equation of j(x,y) = 0. Since\nall the circles we are considering pass through (0,0), the curve g{x,y) = 0 is\nitself (he representative curve in E3 of a system of circles which have f(x,y)\n= 0 as envelope. Applying the method of the last section, we find the polar\nlines of the tangents to g(x,y) = 0. We obtain a cone of lines, vertex (0,0).\nThis cone meets Q in a curve of which J(x,y) = 0, the envelope, is the\northogonal projection on to the (x,t/)-plane. Since we are given f(x,y) = 0,\nto obtain g(x,y) = 0 we project\n\n42 [2.10 the given curve up on to Q, obtaining a curve 2, say. The tangent\nplanes to Q at the points of 2 meet the (z,t/)-plane in the tangents of the\nrequired circle-tangential equation. This follows from the fact that the polar\nline of a line passing through (0,0) is the intersection of the polar planes\nof (0,0) and the point where this line meets Q again. The polar plane of (0,0)\nis the (x,t/)-plane, and the polar plane of any other point on Q is also the\ntangent plane at the point. We apply this method to the examples given above.\nFor the circle-tangential equation of a point (a,b), we consider the\nintersection with b = 0 of the tangent plane to Q at the point (a,b, a2 + &2).\nThis intersection must be the perpendicular bisector of the join of (a,b) to\n(0,0). We now operate with the circle x2 + y2 — 2£'x — 2^'y + £'=0. When we\nproject this up on to Q, we obtain a plane section given by the intersection\nof Q and the plane 2£'x + ty'y - b - £ = 0. Tangent planes to Q at the points\nof this section all pass through the pole of the plane, which is the point\n(£',•»?'&'), and meet 8=0 in tangents to the curve given by the intersection\nwith e = 0 of the tangent cone to Q from (£',•>/,£'). The tangent cone is\neasily derived from Eq. (2), §6, chapter II, and is given by the equation 4(f\"\n+ V2 - 0 (x* + V2 - *) - (2f X + V» -V- «)2 = 0. If we put e = 0 in this\nequation, we obtain 4(£'2 + V2 - O (x* + t/2) - (2?x + ty'y - p* = 0. Our\nprevious investigation tells us that this is a conic with, foci at (0,0) and\n(£',V)> an^ an ellipse or a hyperbola according as £' is negative or positive.\n\n2.11] SOME ANALLAGMATIO CURVES 48 The presence of a focus at (0,0) is\nmanifest, since the equation may be written as f If (p + v'2 _ fi I v(r + ^ J\nThe corresponding directrix is the intersection with a = 0 of the polar plane\nof (£',V> £'). We have found then that the tangent cone to Q from the point\n{£',-r) &') meets 0 = 0 in a conic with foci at (0,0) and (f',V)> and that\nthis conic is an ellipse or hyperbola according as £' is negative or positive.\n11. Some anallagmatic curves We conclude this chapter by finding the equations\nof curves of a given order which are anallagmatic (self-inverse) in a given\ncircle. Let the circle have representative point (£,t),Q. As we saw in §8,\npage 86, points which are inverse in the circle x2 + y2 — 2& — fyy + I = 0 are\nrepresented by points on Q collinear with the point (f,ij,£)- A plane through\n(£/»?,£) is given by the equation p(x — I) + qfy — v)+ t(b —0 = 0. This plane\nintersects Q in a conic, the orthogonal projection of which is the circle p(x\n- 0 + q(y -7))+ r(x* + y2-0 = 0. By construction, this circle is self-inverse,\nand therefore orthogonal to the given circle. It is the most general circle\northogonal to the given circle. A quadric cone with vertex at (£,•»?,£) has\nthe equation a(x - ^)2 + M(x -i)(y-v) + b(y - v)2 + 2^-0 (0-O + 2/(y-t,) (0-O\n+ c(0-O2 = O, and therefore the quartic curves anallagmatic in the given\ncircle are obtained by merely substituting 0 = x2 + y2 in this equation. They\nare bicircular quartics. To obtain the anallagmatic cubic curves, the quartic\ncurve of intersection of the quadric cone vertex (£,■»?,£) with Q must have\none point at infinity on the axis, x=y = 0,oi Q. Therefore, one generator of\nthe cone must be parallel to x = y = 0. We therefore put c = 0 in the above\nequation to obtain anallagmatic cubics. This process can easily be extended.\n\nCHAPTER III Our aim in this chapter is to discuss the Poincare model of\nhyperbolic non-Euclidean geometry. This sounds more formidable than it really\nis. Circles play a leading part in the discussion, as we shall see, and so do\nthe elementary properties of complex numbers. We begin by recapitulating these\nproperties. 1. Complex numbers Complex numbers are expressions of the form a +\nbi, where a and b are any real numbers, the rules of calculation for these\ncomplex numbers being the same as for real numbers, plus the rule that i.i =\ni2 = — 1. Hence, we have (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (W + di) = (a + c) +\n(b + d)i, and (a + bi) (c + di) = ac + bci + adi + bdi2 = ac + bci + adi — bd\n= (ac—bd) + (be + ad)i. We say that a is the real part, bi the imaginary part\nof the complex number a + bi. A complex number is only zero if its real part\nand imaginary part are simultaneously zero. Hence, a + bi = e + di if and only\nif a = c and b = d. 2. The Argand diagram If, in a plane, a system of\nrectangular Cartesian axes be taken, the complex number b = x + iy may be\nrepresented by the point with coordinates (x,y). In this way we set up a\ncorrespondence between the complex numbers and points of the plane. In\nparticular, the numbers x + i.O correspond to points of Ox, which is therefore\ncalled the real axis. Such numbers are indistinguishable from ordinary real\nnumbers x. This method of representing complex numbers is called the Argand\ndiagram. The plane thus put into correspondence with the set of complex\nnumbers is called the plane of the complex variable, and we shall speak of the\ncomplex number b or of (he point 44\n\n8.8] MODULUS AND ARGUMENT 45 b, this point b being precisely the point which\ncorresponds to the number b. It is sometimes useful to think of the point b as\na vector Ob with components (x,y). We recall that two vectors are equal if\nthey have the same components, that is to say if the arrows which represent\nthem are parallel, in the same sense, and of equal length, without necessarily\nstarting from the same origin. We see at once that these vectors obey the\nparallelogram law z,+z2 Fig. 47 of addition, since if bx = xx -f- iyv and £2 =\nx2 + Wz> b = bx + «a = xx + x2 + %i + yj- The interpretation of subtraction is\nequally simple: If b = bx — b2) and therefore bx = b + b2, b must be\nrepresented —► by the vector b2bv 3. Modulus and argument If the length of the\nvector Ob be denoted by p, and the angle Fig. 48 through which Ox must be\nrotated to lie along Ob by <p, we have x = p cos 9?, y = p sin <p, p = ^/(x* +\nt/a). p is called the modulus of the complex number, and <p, which is\ndetermined to a multiple of %z, the argument.\n\n46 circles [8.4 It follows that 0 = x + iy = p(cos <p + i sin ©). If now »x\nand *2 are two complex numbers, 0i= Pi(°os fx + t sin ©!), *a = P2(C0S Pa + *\nsin Pa)* their product ssxssz = p^^os (©! + ©2) + * sm (Pi + Pa))' as is\neasily seen by direct multiplication. Hence, to multiply two complex numbers,\nyou multiply their moduli and add their arguments. For division, let ss =\n0i/«a> (*a 9* 0), so that Using the first rule, it follows that the quotient\nof two complex numbers has, for modulus, the quotient of their moduli, and,\nfor argument, the difference of their arguments. 4. Circles as level curves\nLet o, b, ss be any three complex numbers. We denote by {ssdb) the ratio ss— a\n, ,, The modulus of this complex number is the quotient of the moduli of ss —\na and ss—b. It is therefore the quotient ass*/be • Fig. 49 t ax denotes the\ndistance between the points a and z in the Argand diagram.\n\n8.5] THE CROSS-RATIO OF FOUR COMPLEX NUMBERS 47 As for its argument, by the\nabove it is the angle through which the vector ss—b must be turned to give it\nthe direction of the vector a— a. It is therefore the angle between the\nvectors as and be, oriented as in Fig. 49. If we regard a and b as fixed, and\na as variable, we may enquire into the nature of the curves along which mod\n(nob) and arg (eob) are respectively constant. These are the level curves of\nthe respective functions. Both turn out to be circles. If we have azjbz =\nconstant, the ratio of the powers of the point a with respect to the point\ncircles a and b is constant. Therefore a moves on a circle of the coaxal\nsystem determined by the point circles a,b. This coaxal system has these point\ncircles as limiting points. If the angle between an and be is constant, s\nmoves on an arc of a certain circle passing through a and b. The other arc,\nthe arc complementary to the first, corresponds to an argument <p + 7c. If <p\ntakes all possible values, we obtain all circles of the coaxal system through\na and b, including the radical axis ab, when <p = 7c (this gives points\nbetween a and b) and when <p = 0 (this gives points outside ab). For all\nvalues of the modulus and argument of (nab) we therefore obtain all circles of\ntwo conjugate coaxal systems as level curves. 5. The cross-ratio of four\ncomplex numbers Let a, b, c, d be four complex numbers. By definition, the\ncross-ratio of the four numbers in the given order is the ratio (acd)l(bcd).\nWe write y=(a6'cd)' so that (ab,cd) -{b_ c)l{h _ ^ This is formally the same\ndefinition as that which occurs in projective geometry. The modulus of the\ncross-ratio is equal to the quotient of the moduli of (acd) and (bed). Hence,\nfor this modulus to be equal to\n\n48 CIRCLES [8.5 1, it is necessary and sufficient for (acd) and (bed) to have\nthe same modulus. By what we have seen above, a and b must therefore lie on\nthe same circle of the coaxal system which has c,d as limiting points. The\nargument of the cross-ratio is equal to the difference of the arguments of\n(acd) and (bed). The cross-ratio therefore has zero argument if (acd) and\n(bed) have the same argument, which is the case if a and b are on the same arc\nof a circle bounded by c and d. The argument of the cross-ratio is equal to n\nif the arguments Fig. 60 Fig. 51 of (acd) and (bed) differ by 7c, which is the\ncase if a and b are on complementary arcs of a circle through c and d. Now, a\nnumber is real if its argument is 0 or 7c. Hence we have the theorem: For the\ncross-ratio (db,cd) to be real, it is necessary and sufficient that the four\npoints a, b, c, d should lie on a circle (or straight line). More generally,\nwe find the locus of 0 such that the cross- ratio (m,bc) has (i) a constant\nmodulus; and (ii) a constant argument. Since (m,bc) = (zbc)j(abc), the modulus\nand argument of (ssa,bc) will be constant if the respective modulus and\nargument of (ssbc) are constant. (i) The locus of points s such that mod (sbc)\nis constant is a circle of the coaxal system with limiting points b and c.\n(ii) The locus of points s such that arg (sbc) is constant is an arc of a\ncircle limited by b and c. We deduce that if a, b, c are three distinct\ncomplex numbers, u any given complex number, then there is a unique number 3\nsuch that (za,bc) = u.\n\n8.5] THE CROSS-RATIO OF FOUR COMPLEX NUMBERS 49 Fig. 52 For u has a definite\nmodulus and argument, and a is given as the unique intersection of a circle\nand an arc of a circle, as shown in Fig. 52. This important property is worth\nverifying algebraically. If {ssa,bc) = u, then we must have (afcc) = (abcju.\nWrite (abc)u = k. Then (s — &)/(« — c) = k, which gives b — fee We conclude\nthis section by giving an interesting geometrical 6k Fig. 53 interpretation to\nthe cross-ratio (ab,cd) of any four complex numbers. If tf>1 is the argument\nof (acd), and ^2 *na* °^ Q>c3), we know that the argument <p of (ab,cd)\nsatisfies the equation ? = \"Z-i — </'2- Draw the circles through a, c, d and\nb, c, d respectively, and let 0V ©2 be the angles made by cd with the tangents\nat c to these\n\n50 CIRCLES [8.6 circles. Then by the alternate segment theorem, ^x = @x and\n1A2 = ©2» 80 that 9? = ©x — ©2- Hence <p is the angle between the two circles,\nand we have the theorem: The argument of the cross-ratio (ab,cd) is equal to\nthe angle between the two circles passing through a, c, d and b, c, d\nrespectively. 6. Mobius transformations of the 3-plane These are\ntransformations of the plane of the complex variable which map any point 8 on\na point w according to the formula Az + B m W=Cs + D' (1) where A, B,C, D are\nfour complex constants, and AD — BC ^ 0. We exclude the case AjC = BjD,\nbecause then w = AjC for all values of 0, and all points 0 transform into a\nsingle point w. The reader is probably already familiar with transformations\nof type (1) in projective geometry, where they are called bilinear or\nprojective transformations, and transform points of a line. The same algebra\nproves the theorem: A Mobius transformation leaves cross-ratios invariant. In\nother words, if a, b, c, d transform respectively into a', b', c', a\", then\n(ab,cd) = (a'b',c'd'). We make some important deductions from this theorem. I.\nIf w = ^--1-?:, (AD — BC 56 0) is a Mobius transforma- U3 + D tion, and\n(a,a'), {b,b'), (c,c') are three pairs of corresponding points, then the\nequation of the transformation may be written in the form {wa',b'c') = (njbc).\n(2) This follows immediately from the theorem. If z is any point, and w the\ncorresponding point under the Mobius transformation, then the pair (z,w)\nsatisfy (2). On the other hand we know that, 3 having been given, there is a\nunique w which can make the cross-ratio (wa',b'c') = (nsa,bc). Hence the\nequation (2) does, in fact, map 3 on the w given by the Mobius transformation.\nII. Conversely, let a, b, c be three distinct complex numbers, and a!,b',c' a\nsecond set of three distinct complex numbers. Then the equation (wa',b'cf) =\n(ea,bc) is the equation of a Mobius transformation which maps a on a', b on V\nand c on c'.\n\n3.7] A MOBIUS TRANSFORMATION DISSECTED 51 This follows immediately by writing\nout both sides of the equation, and substituting a = a, b, c in turn. We find\nthat w = a', b', c' in turn. III. A Mobius transformation transforms circles\ninto circles. (It is understood that straight lines come into the category of\ncircles.) We shall give two proofs of this important theorem. In the first\nplace let 0 be any point of the circle determined by the three points a, b, c.\nThen the cross-ratio (ga,bc) = real number. Let e' be the transform of 0. Then\n(Bfa',b'c') = (m,bc) = real number, and therefore «' lies on a circle through\na', &', c'. The second proof will be given in the next section. We conclude\nthis section with: IV. A Mobius transformation conserves the angle of\nintersection of two circles. Let b and c be the points common to two circles\n<871 and ^f a, ax a third point on #x and o2 a third point on #2- We have seen\n(see page 50) that the angle between the two circles is given by the argument\nof the cross-ratio {axa2,bc). But this argument is conserved, since the cross-\nratio itself is conserved. A second proof of this theorem will also be given\nlater. 7. A Mobius transformation dissected The reader may ask, at this stage,\nwhether there is any connection between Mobius transformations and inversion.\nWe show that there is. We may write - Ass + B = A , BC -AD W~ Css +D~C+ C(Css\n+ D)' by simple division, or _A BC- AD 1 W~C+ C2 'i + DjC' We now carry out\nthe transformation on s in several stages: (i) Let 01 = 0 _j_ .\n\n52 CIRCLES [8.7 (\") (iii) (iv) Let Let Then 1 . #a > *i BC-AD A , Each stage\ncan be interpreted geometrically, and this we proceed to do. Stage (i) is\nequivalent to a translation of z in a definite direction and through a\ndefinite distance, given by the vector D/C. Stage (ii) is equivalent to\ninversion in the unit circle, followed by reflection in the real axis. For\nwith an obvious notation, r2(cos 02 + t sin &J) — r^cos ®t -J- i sin ®]) = —\n(cos (— @x) -J- i sin (— ®x)), and therefore r2 = l/rx, so that rxr2 = 1, and\n02=- Ox. Stage (iii), multiplication by a fixed complex number is equivalent\nto a dilatation by a fixed amount from the origin, followed by a definite\nrotation about the origin. For if (BC — AD)/C2 = p(cos @ + i sin &), rz = pr2,\nand ©3 = @2 + S. Stage (iv) is another translation. We see that after each one\nof these sub-transformations circles are still circles (or straight lines),\nand that the angle of intersection of two circles is unchanged. Hence we have\nadditional proofs of two of the theorems of the preceding section. Another\nimportant deduction we can make from our dissection of a Mobius transformation\nis the following: If a circle <€ is transformed into a circle W, the interior\nof & is mapped on the interior or the exterior of W. We mean, of course, that\nevery point inside <£ is mapped on points inside #', or every point inside #\nis mapped on points outside #'.\n\n8.8] THE GROUP PROPERTY 53 The only transformation which can turn a circle\ninside-out is (ii), since this is an inversion followed by a reflection. The\ninverse of a circle with respect to a centre of inversion inside the circle\nturns the circle inside out. The other transformations which come into the\ndissection preserve insides and outsides. If the circle 9\" is a straight line,\nthe inside of ^ is mapped on one of the half-planes bounded by the line, the\noutside of ^ on the other. 8. The group property The Mobius transformations of\nthe a-plane form a group. Before we prove this, we give the definition of a\ngroup of transformations. A set of transformations is said to form a group if\nit has the following properties: (a) Every transformation T of the set\npossesses an inverse transformation which is also in the set. If this inverse\ntransformation be denoted by T', the transformation effected by carrying out\nfirst T and then T' is the identical transformation, which leaves everything\nunchanged. (b) If two transformations Tv T2 both belong to the set, the\ntransformation obtained by carrying out first Tx and then T2 also belongs to\nthe set. That the Mobius transformations of the s plane form a group is a\ntheorem easily proved by algebra. Alternatively we can proceed as follows: The\ntransformation inverse to (ea,bc) = {s'a',b'c'), that is, the one which maps\nz' on a, is given by the equation (*'a',6V) = {sa,bc). Now let Mt be a Mobius\ntransformation which maps a on a', b on b', c on c'. It is determined by these\nthree pairs of corresponding points. Let M2 be a Mobius transformation which\nmaps a' on a\", b' on b\" and c' on c\". It is also determined by these three\npairs of corresponding points. Mx is given by the equation (s'a',b'c') =\n(sa,bc); M2 is given by the equation {z\"a\"]o\"c\") — {ss'a',b'c'). The result of\nMx followed by M2 is the transformation (*V,fcV) = (m,bc), which is a Mobius\ntransformation.\n\n54 CIRCLES [8.8 If a set of transformations, all of which belong to a group G\nof transformations, themselves form a group, we call this a subgroup of the\ngroup G. An important example of a group of transformations is afforded by the\ngroup of displacements in a Euclidean plane. We imagine a fixed plane, and\nanother like a large sheet of paper covering it. The paper is moved, with any\npossible figures on it, from one position over the plane to another. We\nconsider only the initial and final positions of a motion or displacement. The\npath does not concern us. Suppose A, B, points of the plane in its first\nposition, become A', B' in its final position. Join AA', BB', and let their\nperpendicular bisectors PX, PY meet in P. Evidently the triangles PAB, PA'B'\nare congruent. Hence the displacement envisaged can be effected by a rotation\nround P. If the right bisectors were parallel, then AA', BB' would be\nparallel, and the displacement would be a translation, every point of the\nplane moving through the same distance and in the same direction. If we follow\na given displacement by another, the result is a displacement, since only\ninitial and final positions are considered. The inverse of a given\ndisplacement is merely that displacement which brings the moving plane back to\nits original position. Hence the displacements, or Euclidean motions of a\nplane, form a group. The set of translations of the plane evidently form a\nsubgroup of the group of displacements.\n\n8.10] THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 55 We may also regard the displacement of one\nplane over another as a mapping of the points of a Euclidean plane into itself\nwhich is one-to-one, transforms lines into lines, preserves angles, and also\norientation. It is this notion which is the basis of applicability in\nEuclidean geometry. In the next section we investigate a group of\ntransformations which, in our non-Euclidean geometry, corresponds to the group\nof Euclidean motions. 9. Special transformations We are interested in a\ncertain subgroup of the group of Mobius transformations, namely that subgroup\nwhich consists of all Mobius transformations which map the inside of a given\ncircle on itself. Let us be more explicit. We choose the circle with centre at\nthe origin and radius = 1. We call the circumference co, and the circular area\nbounded by to we call Q. The points of co are not included in Q. There are\nMobius transformations which transform Q into itself. We shall call these\nM-transformations. For example: the identical transformation w = e; the\ntransformation w = (cos <p + i sin <p)z; this gives a rotation of the plane,\nthrough an angle <p, about the origin. If an M-transformation maps Q on\nitself, the dissection of §7 shows that the boundary co is also mapped on\nitself. But the converse, as we know from the simple example w = 1[b, is not\ntrue. It is easy to see that M-transformations form a group, which is a\nsubgroup of the group of all Mobius transformations. For, if a transformation\nmaps Q on itself, this is also true for the inverse transformation; and if two\ntransformations Mv M2 both map Q on itself, this is also true for the\ntransformation obtained by first carrying out Mx and then M2. We shall now\nrestrict ourselves to these M-transformations and to Q, the interior of the\nunit circle, centre at the origin. We shall show that Q can be regarded as a\nnon-Euclidean space, in which the M-transformations are the group of non-\nEuclidean motions. 10. The fundamental theorem We recall one of the\ncharacteristic properties of the group of displacements of a plane (over\nitself). Let A be any point in the\n\n56 CIRCLES [3.10 plane, a a direction through it, X any other point in the\nplane and <V ( / \"~ Fro. 55 £ a direction through it. Then there is a unique\ndisplacement of the plane which maps A on X and a on £. We show that the\nM-transformations have the same property in Q. The theorem to be proved is:\nLet X and A be any two points of Q, £ and a. directions through X and A\nrespectively. Then there is a unique M-transformation which maps (X,£) on\n(A,a). Fig. 56 We note in the first place that, through any point X, and\ntouching any given line through the point, there passes exactly one circle\northogonal to co. This is immediate by inversion, or may be proved as follows:\ndraw the perpendicular at X to the given line, and let B, C be the points in\nwhich it cuts co. Among the circles of the pencil through B and C, two are\nevidently orthogonal to the circle sought for: co itself and the line BC.\nHence the circle required is of the coaxal system conjugate to that defined by\nto and the line BC. It therefore has B and C as limiting points, and is\nuniquely determined, since it passes through X. If we care to regard it as an\nApollonius circle, it is the locus of a point which moves so that the ratio of\nits distances from two fixed points B and C is always equal to XB/XC.\n\n8.10] THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 57 Call this circle Wx, and let xx and x2 be its\nintersections with to. In the same way, there passes through A a unique circle\n<€A orthogonal to co and tangent at A to the direction a. Let av a2 be its\nintersections with to. Now, since M-transformations map to on itself, they\nnecessarily map circles orthogonal to to on to circles orthogonal to to, being\nMobius transformations. Hence any M-transformation which maps (X,£) on (A,a)\nmust necessarily map %' x on ^A, since ^x will be mapped on a circle through\nA, with direction a, and orthogonal to to, and there is only one such circle,\nnamely ^A. Let us now suppose that the points of intersection of <€x and <SA\nwith to are so numbered that the direction £ is that of xt towards %2 in Q,\nand the direction a is that of ax towards a2 in D. The M-transformation we are\nlooking for must map xx on av x2 on a2 and X on A. These three pairs of\ncorresponding points determine a unique Mobius transformation. Our proof will\ntherefore be complete if we show it is an M-transformation, mapping Q into\nitself. This is clear, since the unique Mobius transformation maps the circle\nthrough x1 and x2 orthogonal to ^x, that is to, on the circle through ax and\na2 orthogonal to ^A, which is again to. It therefore maps to on to. On the\nother hand it maps Q on Q, since it maps the interior point X of Q on the\npoint A of Q. The unique Mobius transformation is therefore an\nM-transformation. Corollary: Let a and b be two points of Q, #a a circle\northogonal to to passing through a, #& a circle orthogonal to to passing\nthrough b. There-exist precisely two M-transformations mapping a on & and #a\non #&. To a given orientation on #a the one transforma- Fig. 57 Fig. 58 tion\nmaps one of the possible directions of motion on #&, and the second\ntransformation maps the other.\n\n58 CIRCLES [8.11 In particular, let a, b be\" two points of Q. There exists a\nunique M-transformation which permutes a and b (that is, which maps a on & and\n& on a). To prove this, we note in the first instance that there exists a\nunique circle orthogonal to to and passing through a and b. Call this circle\n#. An M-transformation interchanging a and b must transform <$ into itself. By\nthe above, there are only two M-transformations which map a on & and # on\nitself. The one which conserves orientation on %> cannot map b on a, since\nthen the sense of a towards b in Q would be transformed into the sense of b\ntowards a in Q. Let M' therefore be the M-transformation which maps a on & and\nalters the orientation of <$. We show that M' maps b on a. Let xx and x2 be\nthe intersections of *$ and to, and a' the transform of b by M'. We want to\nprove that a' = a. Since M' changes the orientation of #, xx is mapped on x2,\nx2 on xv Since a is also mapped on b, and b on a', the cross-ratio property\ngives (xjX^ab) = (x^ba'). But, for any cross-ratio, (XiXfrOb) = (x^x^a). Hence\n(x^^ba) = (x^x^a'), and therefore a' = a. 11. The PoincarS model We can now\ndiscuss Poincare's model of a hyperbolic non- Euclidean geometry. The term \"\nnon-Euclidean \" refers to the fact that in this geometry Euclid's parallel\naxiom does not obtain. Our space is the interior Q of the circle co. We shall\ncall this the 7i-plane. A point of Q is a point, or 7i-point, in our new\ngeometry. But our h-lines are the arcs of circles (or straight lines) inside\nQ, limited by co and orthogonal to co. These are the arcs considered in our\nprevious theorems. If a point in Q lies on one of these arcs, we shall say\nthat the corresponding 7i-point lies on the corresponding 7i-line. We see that\nthe ordinary incidence theorems of Euclidean geometry hold in our 7i-geometry.\nThrough two distinct points of Q there passes a unique circle orthogonal to\nco. Hence, through two distinct h-points there passes a unique h-line.\n\n8.11] THE POINOARB MODEL 59 Two circles orthogonal to co intersect in at most\none point which is inside Q. Hence, two 7i-lines intersect in at most one\n7i-point. We shall consider the pairs of 7i-lines which do not intersect\nlater. Since arcs of circles inside Q orthogonal to co constantly recur, we\ncall them co-arcs. The angle between two co-arcs will be, by definition, the\n7i-angle between the corresponding 7i-lines. The relation of equality between\nthe angles of co-arcs will imply the relation of equality, or 7i-equality,\nbetween Ti-angles. We now come to the more difficult notion of h-equality\nbetween Ti-segments. An h-segment is naturally the portion of an co-arc\nbounded by two points of Q. In elementary geometry two segments are equal if\none can be applied to the other. This involves a displacement, or motion, of\nthe plane. Such a motion transforms lines into lines, and conserves angles. In\nour /i-geometry the equivalent to this group of motions is the group of\nM-transformations, which transform felines into Mines, and conserve angles. We\ntherefore call an M- transformation of Q an h-displacement of the h-flane, and\nsay that two fe-segments AB and CD are fe-equal, written AB i CD, if there is\nan fe-motion which transforms AB into CD. Since M-transformations form a\ngroup, the relation of fe-equality satisfies the usual axioms of equivalence:\n(i) .-^h,— w AB=AB: (ii) if AB = CD, then CD = AB: (iii) if AB = CD, and CD i\nEF, then AB = EF. Again, since there is an M-transformation mapping the\nsegment ah of an co-arc on the segment ba, we also have AB=BA. The ordinary\ntheorems on congruence in Euclidean geometry have an equivalent in our fe-\ngeometry. For example, let us prove the theorem:\n\n60 CIRCLES [3.11 In two h-triangles ABC and A'B'C', the equalities AB = A'B',\nAC = A'C and /_CAB= /C'A'B' imply the equality /_ABC = /_A'B'C. Fro. 59 To\nprove this we must show that if two triangles ABC, A'B'C (made up of co-arcs)\nare such that a = a' (Fig. 59), and there exists an M-transformation which\nmaps AB on A'B', and an M-transformation which maps AC on A'C, then /? = /?'.\nSuppose at first that the triangles ABC, A'B'C have the same orientation. The\nproof will consist in showing that there is an M-transformation which maps the\nco-triangle ABC on the co- triangle A'B'C. Since AB = A'B', there exists a\n(unique) M-transformation which maps A on A' and B on B'. Since this\ntransformation preserves angles in magnitude and orientation, it maps the co-\narc AC on the co-arc A'C in the direction A'C. This M-transformation is the\nonly one which maps A on A' and the co-arc AC in the direction AC on the co-\narc A'C in the direction A'C. Hence, it is the one which maps A on A' and C on\nC, since we know such a transformation exists. We have therefore found an\nM-transformation which maps the co-triangle ABC on the co-triangle A'B'C. This\ntransformation conserves angles, and therefore jS = £'. If the orientations of\nthe co-triangles ABC, A'B'C are different, we take the geometrical image of\nA'B'C in any diameter of Q. Call the transformed triangle A\"B\"C. Then the co-\ntriangles ABC, A\"B\"G\" have the same orientation, and the proof applies. Since\nthe co-triangle A\"B\"G\" arises from A'B'C by a reflection, the theorem follows.\n\n8.18] NON-EU0LIDBAN DISTANCE 61 12. The parallel axiom So far we have shown\nthat there is a complete equivalence between our 7i-geometry and that part of\nEuclidean geometry which is developed before the introduction of the parallel\naxiom. We now come to the parting of ways ! We could say that two co-arcs\nwhich do not intersect shall be called h-parallel h-lines. Through a point A\noutside any co-arc we can draw an infinity of co-arcs which do not cut the\ngiven co-arc. This would lead to there being an infinity of Ti-lines\n7i-parallel Fro. 60 to a given h-ftne through a given 7i-point outside the\n7i-line. We notice that there are two co-arcs through A which touch the given\nco-arc, the respective points of contact being on co. These two co-arcs\nseparate the co-arcs through A into two classes: those which cut the given co-\narc, and those which do not. We prefer to reserve the term h-parallel for the\ntwo co-arcs which touch the given co-arc at a point of co, and therefore now\nhave, instead of Euclid's parallel axiom, the theorem: Through any h-point A\ntaken outside an h-line there pass precisely two h-parallels to the given\nh-line. Hence, the term non-Euclidean geometry. The existence of a model for\nnon-Euclidean geometry shows that the parallel axiom is independent of the\nother axioms, and cannot be deduced from them. Much fruitless effort has gone\ninto attempts to prove the parallel axiom, and even today there exist\norganizations of people devoted to proving the axiom. Needless to say, these\ndevotees are not shaken in their faith by mathematical arguments. 13. Non-\nEuclidean distance We know how to compare two Ti-segments for equality. We\n\n62 CIRCLES [8.18 now want to obtain a distance-function D[ab] for any two fe-points a, b which satisfies the conditions: D{ba] = D[ah] > 0; D[ab] = 0 if and only if b = a; D[ab] + D[bc] £ JDjae], with equality if and only if b lies on the 7i-line ac between a and c. We also want this distance function to be invariant under Ti-motions of the 7i-plane. Let the 7i-line ah cut co in the points a, j8. Then D[ab] = | log (aftafc) | is a suitable distance-function. It evidently satisfies the first two conditions, and also the condition that it be invariant under h- motions of the ^-plane. For D{ba] = | log (ap,ba) 1 log («P,ab) = |-log(afta&)| = D[ab], and, by definition, D[ab] > 0\\. It can only = 0 if (a/3,a&) = 1, when we must have b = a. Again, if any M-transformation of Q maps the points a, /?, a, b on a', /?', a', V respectively, we know that a', J3' will be on co, and that a, $', a', V all lie on an 7i-line. Since also (<xp,ab) = (oc'p',a'b'), D[ab] = D[a'b']. If a, b, c are three points, in this order, on an 7i-line which cuts a in a, p, we have, identically, (a£,ac) = (<xP,ab).(ocf3,bc). As the points a, b, c are ordered as shown, the three logarithms log(ajS,ac), log (aftah) and log (afihc) all have the same sign. Therefore D[ac] = D[ah] + D[bc]. To prove the full triangle inequality is more difficult, but we remark that since the parallel axiom is not used in Euclid's earlier theorems, we can apply the first twenty-eight propositions of Euclid's first book, without change, to our A-plane. We then obtain theorems concerning the congruence of triangles, as we have seen, the theorem that the greatest side of a triangle is opposite the greatest angle, and lastly, the triangle inequality: D[ab] + D[bc] > D[ac],\n\n8.18] NON-EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE 68 if a, b, c are not, in this order, on an\n7i-line. It is possible to go much further into the study of non-Euclidean\ngeometry, but we do not propose to do so in this book. The reader may find\nthat bis interest in the axioms of Euclidean geometry has been aroused, and he\ncannot do better than to study these afresh, and then see what are the\nessential differences between the non-Euclidean geometry we have been\ndiscussing and Euclidean geometry.\n\nCHAPTER IV This chapter discusses the solution of a classical problem: to show\nthat, of all closed plane curves of a given perimeter, the circle encloses the\ngreatest area. This property of a circle is usually referred to as its\nisoperimetric property. 1. Steiner's enlarging process Steiner gave a simple\ngeometric construction by which, given any closed convex plane curve K which\nis not a circle, it is possible to devise a new curve K* which is also plane\nand closed, has the same perimeter, but contains a greater area than K. It\nfollows that K cannot be the solution of the isoperimetric problem. Fig. 61\nThe method is as follows. Choose on K two points A and B which bisect the\nperimeter; that is, the two arcs into which A and B divide K have equal\nlength. If one arc be Kv and if this, together with AB, bounds a curve of area\nFv while the other arc K2 and AB bound a curve of area F2, then we assume that\nFt > F2. The area of the curve is F = Fx + F2. We now wipe out the arc K2, and\nsubstitute in its place the arc K'2 which is obtained from Kx by reflection in\nthe line AB. The closed curve bounded by Kx and K'z evidently has the same\nperimeter as K. Call this new curve K'. Its area is F' = %FV and we have F<F\\\n64\n\n4.2] EXISTENCE OF A SOLUTION 65 Since the equality sign may hold in this\nrelation, we have not yet completed the process. By hypothesis, K was not a\ncircle. Hence, we may certainly choose A and B so that neither of the arcs Kx\nand K2 is a semicircle. Therefore K' is not a circle. Hence we can find a\npoint C distinct from A and B on K' so that /_ACB = y is not a right angle.\nLet D be the image of 0 \\nAB. If we cut out from the area bounded by K' the\nquadrangle ACBD, four lunes remain, as indicated below. Fig. 62 We imagine\nthat the sides of the quadrangle are bars, hinged at A, B, C and D, and that\nthe lunes are fastened to these bars. We now move the bars about the hinges to\na position where the angles at C and D are both right angles. Call the new\nquadrangle A*C*B*D*. Then the symmetric curve K*, which circumscribes the new\nposition of the quadrangle, is the one we are seeking. In fact, the perimeter\nof K* is equal to that of K', being made up of four arcs each congruent to the\ncorresponding arc of K\\ The difference in the areas enclosed by K' and K* is\nequal to the difference in the areas of ACBD and A*C*B*D*, since the lunes are\nunchanged in area. If F* be the area bounded by K*, F*-F' = CA.CB (1 - sin y)\n> 0\\. Hence F* > F', and therefore F*>F, so that our new curve K* has the same\nperimeter, but encloses a greater area. 2. Existence of a solution Does the\nprocess we have just described prove the isoperimetric property of the circle\n? We have shown that if if is a plane closed curve, not a circle, then the\nenlarging process always produces another closed plane curve K* of the same\nperimeter but enclosing a greater area. Hence, the curve K cannot be a\nsolution of the isoperimetric problem.\n\n66 CIRCLES [4.8 If, among all plane closed curves of a given perimeter, we can\nfind one whose area > the area of every other one, this curve must be a\ncircle. However, this does not solve the problem, since we must prove that\nsuch a curve exists. The Steiner construction indicates a method for\nproceeding towards a solution, but this is not enough, and we must digress for\na moment. If the perimeter of a given plane closed curve be L, we shall see\nlater on that the area enclosed, F, satisfies the inequality F<L\\ Hence, the\nset of all plane closed curves with given perimeter L gives rise to a set of\nnumbers F bounded from above. Such a set of numbers has a hast upper bound A,\nsay. Then A has the following characteristic properties: (i) A ^ all numbers\nin the set; (ii) for any e > 0, there exists at least one number in the set >\nA — e. If the least upper bound A is a member of the set of numbers F, the\nisoperimetric property of the circle is proved. But once again, this would\nhave to be proved. The set of numbers 1/2, 2/8,..., nj(n + 1), • • • has 1 as\na least upper bound, but 1 is not a member of the set, so that in a bounded\ninfinite set of numbers there does not necessarily exist a greatest one. We\nare therefore up against a serious difficulty, and, although it can be done,\nwe shall not prove the isoperimetric property of the circle by a continued use\nof Steiner's enlarging process. 3. Method of solution So far we have not\ndiscussed what we mean precisely by the perimeter of a closed curve, and the\narea enclosed by it. This remains to be done. What we shall do in this section\nis to enumerate the points in our proof of the isoperimetric property, giving\nthe details later. Let A be the perimeter and €> the area of an equilateral\npolygon with an even number of vertices. Then we can show that A2 — 4iz0 > 0\\.\nIt follows from this that if K is any closed, rectifiable, continuous curve of\nperimeter L and area F, then L2 - 4tcF > 0.\n\n4.4] AREA OF A POLYGON 67 To show this, we inscribe in K an equilateral\npolygon V* with an even number of vertices, and choose the sides p of V* so\nsmall that the perimeter A* and area €>* of V* differ respectively from the\nperimeter L and area F of K by as small a quantity as we please. If we had La\n- 4nF < 0, we could construct V* so that ,1*2 _ 47C$* < o, and so arrive at a\ncontradiction. Hence L2 - 4tcF > 0\\. If K is a circle, L = 2w, F = w2, and L2\n- 4tcF = 0. If K is any other continuous, closed and rectifiable curve, we can\ndeduce from it, by the Steiner procedure, a curve K' of perimeter U and area\nF' such that L=L' and F < F'. Since L'2 - 4tcF' > 0, it follows that we must\nhave L2 - 4tcF > 0\\. Hence we have the following result: Let K be a\ncmtirvuous, closed and rectifiable plane curve of perimeter L and area F. Then\nL2 - 4tcF > 0, and equality holds if and only if K is a circle, described\npositively. This proves the isoperimetric property of the circle: Amongst all\nplane curves of a given perimeter, the circle, described positively, has the\ngreatest area. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the discussion of\nthe concepts perimeter and area and to the proof of the statements made above.\n4. Area of a polygon Before we can discuss the concept area enclosed by a\ncurve, we must be clear about the area of a polygon. We take the usual system\nof rectangular Cartesian coordinates,\n\n68 CIRCLES [4.4 Fig. 63 and suppose that Tv T2 are two points with coordinates\n(xvyj) and (a^t/j). Then the area of the triangle OT^^ is given by the\nformula: area OT^Ti — lixfli — x^x). If we have n -\\\\-l points: Ti{Xi,yi) (i =\n1,..., n + 1), then, by the area of the polygon OT1Ti • • • Tn+i we understand\nthe sum: area OT^i + area 0T,T3 H h area OTnTn+1 n = \\ £ (xkyk+1 — xk+1yk). We\nassume that Tn+1 and Tx coincide. The area is now \\ S (xkyk+i — xk+1yk) (xn+i\n= xx', yn+i= y-i)- *-i A simple calculation shows that this is independent of\nthe position of the origin, and we call it the area of the closed polygon\nTXT2- • • T„. By a polygon, we mean a finite number of points Tlt T2> * * *»\nwhich are not necessarily distinct, but are ordered. The area is also\ninvariant under a rotation of the axes, and we can therefore say that two\nsimilarly oriented congruent polygons have the same area. If we reverse the\nsense in which the polygon is described, we change the sign of the area. If\ntwo polygons have a sequence of vertices in common which are described in\nopposite senses for the two polygons, their areas can be added, and we obtain\nthe area of the resulting polygon. For example:\n\n4.5] REGULAR POLYGONS 69 Fig. 64 area (^T.r.TJ -f area (T^T^) = area\n(T^.T.Ta). The perimeter of a polygon is a simpler concept. We have perimeter\n(T^, • • • T„) = ST*T*+i, where the length of each side is taken positively.\n5. Regular polygons We assume that we are given an equilateral polygon V with\nan even number of vertices n, and perimeter A. If n and A are fixed, when is\nthe area of the polygon a maximum ? An equilateral polygon is said to be\nregular if its vertices lie on a circle and if, on traversing the\ncircumference of the circle once, all the vertices are traversed just once. We\ncan show that the answer to the question posed above is: the area of the\npolygon is a maximum when it is regular, and traversed positively. We prove\nthis in two stages. By applying the Steiner enlarging process, we complete the\nfirst stage, and can show that no polygon which is not regular can have a\nmaximum area. The second stage is an existence proof: Amongst all equilateral\npolygons with a given number n of vertices and a given perimeter A, there is\none whose area > area of any other. We shall leave the proof of the first\nstage to the reader, as it is quite straightforward. To prove the second\nstage, we first show that: The areas of all the polygons we are considering\nare bounded from above. We may assume that 2\\ is at the origin. Then every\nlength OTt < A/2, for 0 and T* are connected by two paths, made up of sides of\nthe polygon, whose total length is A. One of these\n\n70 CIRCLES [4.5 paths must therefore certainly be of length < AfL. Therefore the length of the straight segment OTk < A/2, by the triangle inequality. Since also TkTk+1 = Ajn, we have | area of triangle OTkTk+11< A2j4n. On the other hand: |*| = | area {T1T2 • • • T„) | < n max | area (OTkTk+1) |, and therefore we have the desired result: \\$\\<hA*. The bounded set of the numbers denoting the areas €> of all the polygons we are considering therefore has a least upper bound *0, and we wish to show that tf>0 is in the set; that is, that there exists at least one polygon with 3>0 for the measure of its area. To prove this, we invoke a classical theorem of function theory. If we consider the expression for the area n 0 = £ 2 (xkyk+1 — xk+1yk), *-i it is evidently a continuous function of the 2w variables xv yv ..., Xn, yn. If we keep Tx at the origin, we can easily designate a closed area of the plane within which the polygon always lies. The square bounded byx= — A,x = A,y = — A,y = A will do. * is a continuous function of xv yv ..., xn, y„ within and on the boundary of the product space given by: xx = ± A, t/i = ± A,..., Xn = ± A, yn = ± A. But we also have the equations (a;* — z*+i)2 + (yk — yk+1)* = A2/n2 (k = 1,..., n). La the product space these equations define a bounded, closed set of points. It is a classical theorem that 0 attains its maximum on this set. Hence if €> is the area of a non-regular equilateral polygon with an even number of vertices, and tf>0 is the area of the regular polygon, described positively, with the same perimeter and number of sides, then * < #o- If r is the radius of the circle circumscribing the regular polygon, then A0 = 2«r sin -,\n\n4.6] RBOTIFIABLB CURVES 71 <P0 = n I br* sin—) = nr* sin - cos -, \\ n I n n so\nthat A\\\\- (4ntan-W=0. For any equilateral polygon with n vertices and\nperimeter A = Aq, we have, by the above proof, A2- (4ntan-W>0, so that, in all\ncases, A* - Un tan -\\\\* > 0\\. We replace this by a weaker inequality which\ndoes not involve the number of sides. Write - = p, then n r 4n tan - = 47c tan\npip. n ' But since 0 < p < \\- , we know that tan p > p, so that 47c tan pip >\n47c, and our inequality becomes A2 - 4tc$ > 0\\. This is the fundamental\ninequality for an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides used in §8.\n6. Rectiflable curves We now define the perimeter of a closed curve. If a < t\n^ b, the continuous functions x(t), y(t) give a parametric representation x =\nx{t), y = y{t) of a continuous curve K with initial point A (t = a) and end\npoint B (t=b). We suppose that there is no subinterval a < t < j8 in which\nboth functions x, y are constant. We now take on K the points Tv T2,..., Tn_i\nwhich correspond to the parametric values a<t1<t2<.- • • < tn_! < b.\n\n72 CIRCLES [4.6 Fig. 65 We join the points A, Tv T2,..., T»_i, B by straight\nlines in order, and obtain the sum A = ATX + T1Ti + • • • + Tn^B, giving the\nlength of the inscribed path ATXT2... Tn_xB. If this sum is always bounded, we\nsay that K is rectifiable, and the least upper bound of the set of positive\nnumbers A is called the arc length L of K. From the property of the least\nupper bound, we always have A^L, and for any e > 0 there always exist values A\nsatisfying A > L — e. An immediate deduction from the definition of arc length\nis the following: if two points A and B are joined by a continuous rectifiable\ncurve K which is distinct from the line AB, then the arc length of K exceeds\nthe length AB. For if K contains a point M which is not on the line AB, then\nthe arc length LoiK satisfies the inequality L> AM + MB> AB. If M is a point\non K corresponding to a value m, where a < m < 6, it can be proved, in an\nevident notation, that We leave this proof to the reader. We now consider a\nclosed continuous curve K: x = x(t), y = y(t), (a < t < 6), x(a) = x(b), y(a)\n= y(b). We can remove the restriction that a < t < b if we decide that x(t),\ny(t) are to have the period b — a; that is, x(t + b — a) = x(t), y(t + b-a) =\ny(t), for all values of t. By a linear substitution, <p = pt + q, we can\ntransform the interval a < t < b into the interval 0 < <p < 27c. Beplacingf by\n<p, we have two continuous functions:\n\n4.7] APPROXIMATION BY POLYGONS 78 x = x{<p), y = y(<p), of period 27c. If,\nbesides this, we put £ = cos <p, t) = sin <p, (£,tj) describes the unit\ncircle. Every point of this circle corresponds, to a multiple of 2n, to a\nunique value of <p, and this value of <p corresponds to a unique point on K.\nHence we may say: By a continuous closed curve we mean the continuous mapping\nof the points of a circle. Such a mapping is not necessarily one-to- one. We\nnow define the perimeter of a closed curve. We merely use the previous\ndefinition of arc length when A = B: L=Lba. L is independent of the choice of\nthe point A = B; that is, Lb = Lb+e By the rule for the addition of arcs, to\nprove this we must show that Laa^+Lba+e=Li,e + Ll^, which reduces to L^=Lb^.\nSince a = b, this is evident. We can sum up for a closed curve K and say:\nInscribe in K a polygon whose vertices follow each other in the correct cyclic\norder. If the least upper bound L of the perimeters A of all these inscribed\npolygons is finite, we say that K is rectifi- able, and L is its perimeter. 7.\nApproximation by polygons We return once again to a rectifiable arc K: x =\nx(t), y = y(t), (a < t < 6), whose initial point A and end point B do not\nnecessarily coincide. We show that the arc length L of K can be approached by\nthe lengths A of inscribed straight line paths in a uniform manner. Let V be\nsuch a path with vertices corresponding to the parametric values a= t0<t1<t2<\n\\- • • <tn=b. We have the following theorem: Given any e>0we can always\ndetermine 8 > 0 so that the length A of an inscribed path V differs from the\nlength L of K by less than e, that is L — A<€,\n\n74 CIRCLES [4.7 as soon as all {he parametric differences tk — h-i < S (k =\n1,..., n). From the definition of L we can find a path V inscribed in K whose\nlength A' satisfies the inequality L-A'< «/2. Let A = T0, T[,..., T^ = B be\nthe vertices of V. If we choose 8 so that 8 < tk — tk_1 (fc = 1,..., m), and\ninscribe in if a path V for which tk — tk-i <8 (fc = 1,..., n), then, between\ntwo consecutive vertices T'k_v T'k of V there is at least one vertex Tr of V.\nThe path from A to B which contains the vertices of V and of V has a length A\"\nsuch that A\" > A', and therefore L — A\"< e/2. Suppose now that T'k lies\nbetween Tr and Tr+1. Since the continuity of x(t), y(t) implies uniform\ncontinuity, for a suitably small value of 8 both the distances TrT'k and\nT'kTr+i will be smaller than an arbitrarily given -q > 0\\. Then A\"-A = X(TrT'k\n+ T'kTr+1 - TrTr+1) < X{TrT'k + TkTr+1) < V». Hence L — yl<I+2rjw. We can\nchoose 8 so that and we then have L — A < e, which is our goal. We can make\nthe successive segments of our paths equal, if we wish. Describe a circle with\nA, the initial point of K, as centre, and radius p so small that K does not\nlie entirely within this circle. The first point of K, that is the point which\nhas the smallest lvalue and lies on the circumference of the circle, we call\nTv With Tt as centre and radius p we describe a circle, and call the first\npoint following Tx which lies on its circumference T%. We\n\n4.7] APPROXIMATION BY POLYGONS 75 Fig. 68 continue in this way, and obtain a\npath consisting of equal segments of length p inscribed in K. As the length of\nthis path cannot exceed L, after a finite number of steps we reach a point TP\nsuch that the arc of K between TP and B lies within the circle radius p and\ncentre Tp. If we now join up the points A, Tv T2,..., TP, B in order, we\nobtain a path V* inscribed in K whose first p sides are of length p, whilst\nthe last side < p. We now prove: p can be taken so small that all the\nparametric differences <*+i — h (k = 0,1,..., p) corresponding to the vertices\nA = T0, Tv ..., TP, Tp+i = B are smaller than an arbitrary positive number 8:\ntk+i — h<8 (k = 0,1,..., p). To see this, we first construct a path V with\nvertices A = To, T'v ..., T„+1 = B for which t^+i — t'k < 8/2. Since, by\nhypothesis, no subinterval a < t < j3 corresponds to a single point of K, we\ncan choose V so that no two consecutive points T'k and T'k+l coincide. If we\nnow take 2p smaller than the smallest segment of V, there must lie between two\nsuccessive vertices T at least one vertex T, and therefore all differences h+i\n— h < S, as desired. Since TPB ^ p, the path V* is not, in general,\nequilateral. If we replace this last segment by a path (not inscribed) of two\nor three sides each of length p, we obtain, instead of V*, an equilateral path\n'V* with an even number of sides. This path is not inscribed, in the previous\nsense. But if we take A = B, so that K is closed, the difference between the\nareas of the polygons V* and 'V* is equal to the area of the triangle (or\nquadrangle) constructed on TPB as base, and is therefore < 4p2, by a previous\nresult (see page 70), whilst the perimeters differ by less than 8p. Hence we\ncan say:\n\n76 circles [4.8 Given e>Owe can determine p, the side of an equilateral polygon V* vrith an even number of vertices approximating to K so that the relation L-A*<€ holds between the length of K and the perimeter of V*. 8. Area enclosed by a curve Once again we assume K to be closed, continuous and rectifiable: x = x(t), y = y(t) (a < t < 6), x(a) = x(b), y(a) = y(b). We inscribe in if a polygon A = T0, Tv ..., Tn = B = A, corresponding to parametric values a = t0 < tt <•••<<» = b. The area 0 of this polygon is given by the formula: 20 = S |s(<*_i)t/(<*) - t/(**_i)a;(<*)l. We wish to show that, given any e > 0 we can find 8 > 0 such that if tk — h_!<8 (fc=l,...,n), then F — &< e, where F is a number which we shall call the area enclosed by K. We cannot do this without a further study of the functions x(t), y(t). We know that K is rectifiable. Hence jsj {x(tk) - *(**_!) ] ^ + \\y{tk) - yit^)} *j* is bounded, for all possible polygons inscribed in K. Since [{x(h) - *(«*_,))» + {»(«») - t/(**_i) j2]* > X(tk) — X(tk_!) > y(t*) — y(h-i) we see that the function x(t) has the property that the sum S | x{tk) - x{tk_i) | i=l is always bounded. Similarly for y(t). Such functions are called functions of bounded variation. Hence, if K is rectifiable, the continuous functions x(t), y(t) must both be of bounded variation. Since [{*(«*) - *(«*_,)) ■ + {y{h) - y{h--d]*$ < | x(tk) - a(**_i) | + | y(tk) - y(tk-i) \\, the condition is also sufficient.\n\n4.8] AREA ENCLOSED BY A CURVB 77 To facilitate the handling of the expression\nfor €>, we prove the following theorem: Every continuous function f(t) of\nbounded variation can be ivritten as the difference f(t) = 9(t) - ffl of two\ncontinuous and monotone increasing functions. Let a < t < /? be any\nsubinterval of a < t < 6\\. We divide it up as shown: „ a = t0 < ix <•••<!» =\np, and form the sum S|/(**)-/(<*_i)|. *=i By hypothesis, this sum is bounded.\nLet the least upper bound for all subdivisions of a < t < j3 be denoted by\nActually, this is the arc-length of the continuous curve *=/(<)> y = o which\nlies on the sc-axis, between t = a and t = j3. Now <p(t) = S'a is a monotone\nincreasing, continuous function. The monotony arises from the additive\nproperty of arc lengths: Si + &+» = S<+\\ Again, from the first theorem of §7,\nwe have, for h < S, S>+»-\\f(t + h)-f(t)\\<e, since the first term denotes an\narc-length, and the second the length of a one-sided inscribed path. Therefore\n<p(t + h)- <p(t) = Sl+A < e + \\f(t + h)~ f(t)\\, and because of the continuity\nof /, the right-hand side can be made as small as we please by diminishing h.\nHence <p(t) is continuous. The continuous function m = ?(t)-f(t) is also\nmonotone increasing. For by the definition of <p, for a<jS, <p{® - 9{cc) =\nS*a> \\f(® - f(<x)\\\\. We therefore have the desired representation: fit) = ?(t)\n- m Eeturning to the formula for 0, we represent y(t), which is of bounded\nvariation, in this way: y(t) = 9{t) - m-\n\n78 circles [4.8 Then 2$ = S [*(<*_i)y(«*)-y(«*-i)*(«*)| =^x(tk_i)L(tk) -\nt/(**;_x)|- - S y(«*_i)|*(<*) -*(**_i)}• Now js *(t*_,){y(**) - y(h-i)\\\n=Vx(tk_x)L{tk) - <p(tk-i)\\ -Zxih^Uitd-tfiih^y Both sums on the right-hand side\nare in a form to which the usual existence proof for the Eiemann definite\nintegral applies. This shows that each sum: n C 1 2 a(**_i) j ?>(<*) —\n?>(<*_i) k ft n tends to a definite limit as we refine the subdivisions of the\ninterval a < t < b; that is, as we diminish S. A similar result holds for\nSy(**-i){*(<*)-*(**-i)j. as we see by representing x(t) as the difference of\ntwo monotone increasing continuous functions. Hence we finally have the\ntheorem: If e > 0 we can choose the length p of the side of an equilateral\npolygon V* approximating to K so that between the area F enclosed by K and the\narea $>* enclosed by V* the inequality \\F-0*\\<€ holds. V* can be chosen to\nhave an even number of vertices. This completes the proof of the theorems\nneeded-in §8. Naturally the circle is a solution of many other problems in\nmathematics. We mention only one. If we have an enclosed plane membrane of\ngiven area, and set it vibrating, what form must the boundary take for the\nfundamental tone to be as deep as possible ? The answer is a circle. It is\nevident that if we pursued circles conscientiously, very few branches of pure\nor applied mathematics would be left unexplored.\n\nEXERCISES Chapter I 1.1.

Two solutions are\ntangents to #3 which are parallel to #1.\n\n86 CIRCLES 1.18. Inverting. Then circle # becomes the line BC, and centre of #\ninverts into the point 0' which is the inverse of the centre of S, the point\nA, in the inverse of %', which is the line BC. The inverse of 0' in S is the\ncentre 0 of the circle <€. 1.19. The circle LAM remains fixed as A moves. If\nAU is parallel to BC, meeting this circle again in U, show that U is fixed on\nthis circle. It is the centre of the envelope of BC. 1.20. Reduce this case to\nthe one treated above by drawing a parallel to AB to pass through the centre\nof <€, and a parallel to AC to pass through the centre of S. Chapter II 2.1.\nThe circle x2 + y2 — 2px — 2qy + r = 0 is mapped on (p,q,r). If r = 0 the\ncircle passes through (0,0). The centres (p,q) of the circles lie on I, and\nthe reflection of (0,0) in the line I is the other common point of\nintersection. If I passes through (0,0), the circles all touch at (0,0). 2.2.\nThe two circles are mapped onto the points (p,q,—k2), (p',q',—k2), and the\nline joining these points is parallel to the Oasy-plane and below Q, so that\nif k ^ 0 it does not intersect Q. Hence its polar line intersects Q in two\ndistinct points, and the coaxal system is of the intersecting type, with two\ndistinct points of intersection. 2.3. If the parallel lines in E3 are (x —\na)jl = (y — b)jm = (z — c)/n = t, and (x — a')jl = (y — b')jm = (z-— c')/n =\nt', the circles are x2 + y2 — 2(a + lt)x — 2(6 + mt)y + c + nt = 0, x2 + y2 -\n2(a' + lt')x - 2(6' + mt')y + c' + nt' = 0, for varying t and t', and each\nsystem has the radical axis: 2lx + 2my — n = 0. 2.4. Common chord of the two\ncircles is: (x - x')(alc + 2x') + (y- y'){bjc + 2y') = 0. 2.5. Circles are\northogonal if their representative points in E3 are conjugate. The point\n(p,q,r) is in the given plane, and therefore conjugate to the pole of the\ngiven plane. 2.6. Three points in E3 which are not collinear define a plane\nwith a unique pole with respect to Q. The pole represents ^Q, the unique\ncircle orthogonal to the three given circles. If the three circles are in a\n\nSOLUTIONS 87 coaxal system of the intersecting type, the point-circles of\nintersection are the only contact circles. If non-intersecting, there are no\ncontact circles. 2.7. Since <gi is orthogonal to *&$, its inverse in #0 is\nitself. If we invert in ^f0 the three given circles invert into themselves,\nand contact circles invert into contact circles, so that the eight contact\ncircles are paired. Chapter III 3.1. The equation of the transformation which\nhas (a,a'), (p,p), (q,q), and (z,w) as corresponding pairs of points is given\nby (2), p. 50, as: {wa',pq) = (za,pq) which leads immediately to the required\nform. 3.2. Since the cross-ratio of four points on a circle is real, we have\n(za,bc) = t, where a, b and c are fixed points on the circle, z a variable\npoint, and t is real. From (z — b)/(z — c) = t(a — b)j(a — c), we find z in\nthe required form. If AD — BC = 0, we should find that At + B = k(Ct + D), so\nthat z = k, whereas z is a variable point on the circle. 3.3. Since the\ncircular arc BC is orthogonal to w the centre of the arc lies outside Q, and\ntherefore the arc BC is convex to the centre of w. 3.4. The arcs AB and AC\nboth pass through the inverse A' of A in w. Take A' as centre of inversion,\nand for circle of inversion the circle E centre A' orthogonal to a>. Then to\ninverts into itself, and since circles through A' and A invert into lines\northogonal to to through the inverse of A in 2, this inverse is the centre of\na>. 3.5. If the A-line intersects w in B and C, after an inversion which maps\noi onto itself, B onto B' and C onto C, and A onto the centre 0 of to, the\ninverse of the A-line BC is the A-line B'C, and the Euclidean line through 0\nand the centre Q of the circle defined by the arc B'C is perpendicular to the\nA-line B'C, the lines joining the point 0 to B' and C respectively touch the\nA-line B'C, and OQ bisects the angle B'OC. 3.6. If the given A-line is I, and\nthe perpendicular A-lines are m and n, 1 and to define a coaxal system of the\nintersecting type, and m and n are circles in the conjugate coaxal system,\nwhich is non-intersecting. 3.7. Two distinct A-lines with no intersection\ndefine a non-intersecting coaxal system, and have limiting points L and L'\nwhich lie on w, since this is a member of the conjugate coaxal system. There\nis a unique circle through L and L' which is orthogonal to w, and this is the\nunique A-line which is perpendicular to the given A-lines.\n\nAPPENDIX Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach, Mathematician by Laura Guggenbuhl* One of the\nmost important theorems of the geometry of the triangle that was developed\nduring the nineteenth century says that \"the nine point circle of a triangle\nis tangent to the inscribed and to each of the three escribed circles of the\ntriangle.\" The theorem was discovered and first proved by Karl Wilhelm\nFeuerbach, a little-known mathematician who led a short and tempestuous life.\nAlthough modern textbooks in college geometry discuss the theorem at great\nlength, a search for additional details has been extremely interesting and\nfruitful (1). Furthermore, it seems that few people realize that Feuerbach,\nthe mathematician, was a member of the famous Feuerbach family of Germany. An\nearly date in this story is 1821. It was in this year that Brianchon and\nPoncelet proved (2) that ... the circle through the feet of the altitudes of a\ntriangle also passes through the midpoints of the sides, as well as the\nmidpoints of the segments of the altitudes from their point of intersection to\nthe vertices of the triangle. Brianchon and Poncelet did not seem to have any\nidea that the circle in question would attract the interest of so many\nmathematicians in years to come. They did not give a name to the circle, and\nafter a page or two they went on to another problem. At almost the same time,\na slender little volume of a bare 62 pages appeared in Nuremburg under the\nformidable title Eigen- schaften einiger merkwurdigen Punkte des geradlinigen\nDreiecks und mehrerer durch sie bestimmten Linien und Figuren. Eine\nanalytisch-trigonometrische Abhandlung (Properties of some notable points of a\nplane triangle, and various lines and figures * Dr. Guggenbuhl was assistant\nprofessor of mathematics at Hunter College in New York. She received her\ntraining at Hunter College and Bryn Mawr College. This article is based on a\npaper presented by the author before Section L, History and Philosophy of\nScience, at the Boston Meeting of the AAAS, December 1953. Reprinted with\npermission from The Scientific Monthly, Vol. 81 (1955) pp. 71-76. 89\n\n90 Circles determined by these points, an analytic-trigonometric treatise).\nThe title page of this book describes the author as Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach,\ndoctor of philosophy. It may be that the book was Feuerbach's doctoral\ndissertation, but it is not possible to be certain whether this was the case\nor not. Feuerbach attended several different schools and universities, but a\ncareful search has failed to uncover the title of his dissertation or the name\nof the university that awarded him the doctor's degree. At any rate, with the\nappearance of this book in 1822, Feuerbach completed his college studies at\nthe University of Freiburg (Br.). This book probably would have been long\nsince forgotten had it not been for an inconspicuous theorem at the bottom of\npage 38, which states simply, ... the circle which passes through the feet of\nthe altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles, which in turn are\ntangent to the three sides of the triangle. ... Feuerbach's proof was purely\nalgebraic and admittedly modeled upon the proof in an article by Euler (3) of\n1765. Feuerbach showed that the two circles in question were tangent by\nproving that the distance between the centers was equal to the sum of the\nradii of the circles. In outline, the proof sounds simple enough. However, one\ncan appreciate the skill and patience that led to this discovery only by\nworking out the details of the algebraic identities involved in the\ndevelopment. Feuerbach gives only three or four references in addition to the\narticle by Euler. It is particularly interesting to note that he refers to an\narticle by L'Huillier, dated 1810, which appeared in Gergonne's Annates de\nmathematiques, and thus indicated that he was familiar with the journal that\ncarried the aforementioned article by Brianchon and Poncelet. However,\nFeuerbach makes no reference to the work of Brianchon and Poncelet and was\nprobably unaware of its existence. One can scarcely say, as some writers\nclaim, that Feuerbach discovered the nine-point circle of a triangle. For at\nno place in his book does he mention the three points that are the midpoints\nof the segments of the altitudes from the orthocenter to the vertices of the\ntriangle, and he does not letter these points on his diagram. Feuerbach's\ndescription of the circle that was to become so closely associated with his\nname was merely the unimagina-\n\nAppendix: Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach, Mathematician 91 VI.

It seems too that Feuerbach did not realize that this one theorem\nwas so much more significant than the others with which it was listed, and he\nsurely did not realize that his fame as a mathematician would rest upon this\nsingle theorem. Shortly after the publication of his book, Feuerbach, only 22\nyears old and without previous teaching experience, was named professor of\nmathematics at the Gymnasium at Erlangen. There is nothing else to indicate\nthat the book made a deep impression upon contemporary mathematicians, or even\nthat it had a wide circulation. In fact, 11 years later (in 1833) Steiner,\nwriting from Berlin, said he did not know that the theorem in question had\nbeen previously proved by Feuerbach (4). In another note at the end of his\nbook, Steiner said that the \"circle is now generally known as the circle of\nFeuerbach.\" In 1842 the theorem was again submitted as an original\ncontribution to mathematical literature and proved anew by Terquem (5). It is\nin this article by Terquem that the circle is first designed as the nine-point\ncircle. In succeeding years many articles were written about the nine-point\ncircle. People seemed to be fascinated by the difficulties in Feuerbach's\nproof and seemed to find it a pleasant chal- JI+ solvtio i». En ergo fub -»no\nconfpettu qutdrata fcx horutn inrcruallornm: I.

It is a little strange\nthat so much has been written about the theorem Feuerbach discovered and that\nso little has been written about the man who discovered the theorem. In an\narticle by Moritz Cantor (8) a few pages are devoted to biographical details,\nbut by far the most poignant story of Feuerbach's short life can be read in\nhis father's letters (9). Karl Wilhelm was the third son in a family of 11\nchildren born to the famous German jurist Paul Johann Anselm Feuerbach, and\nEva Wilhelmine Maria Troster. The first eight children in the family were\nboys, and the last three were girls. Since three of the boys died in infancy,\nKarl is usually spoken of as the second of five sons of the jurist. These five\nsons were Joseph Anselm (1798-1851) philologist and archeologist, and father\nof OS*r=: (AF - AP)» + (OP - SF)J.

Karl was\nborn in Jena 30 May 1800. His father, 25 years old when Karl was born, had\nleft his home in Frankfurt at the age of 16 to study philosophy at the\nUniversity of Jena. However, since there were jurists and public servants on\nboth sides of his family, it is not surprising to learn that, as his family\nresponsibilities increased, he was soon attracted to the more lucrative\nprofession of the law. All manner of success came to him at a very early age.\nBut it was a number of years before his own father, who had been angered when\nhe left home, became reconciled to him. The young man sent many entreating\nletters to his father that remained unanswered. It is in one such ingratiating\nletter that one can read the earliest reference to Karl; his father says, in a\n\n94 Circles letter from Kiel dated 16 November 1802, that \"his youngest son\nKarl is a healthy, red cheeked, fat youngster, who runs around happily and has\nlittle thought for anything except food.\" In 1804 the father writes of taking\nhis wife and three young sons with him from Kiel to Landshut in an open wagon\nin freezing winter weather. As increasing fame and success came to the father,\nhe moved frequently from one city to another in Germany. Thus Karl, while\nstill a young boy, lived successively in Jena, Kiel, Landshut, and Munich.\nWhen Karl was 14 years old his father moved again from Munich to Bamberg. At\nthis time, however, he left his two eldest sons, Anselm and Karl, in school in\nMunich. In 1817 Anselm and Karl entered the University of Erlangen. At\nErlangen they studied under the patronage of King Maximilian Joseph, who had\nennobled their father, and who had promised to provide for the university\neducation of all the jurist's sons.

In Figs. 5 and 6 the\nline EFH is the Euler line of the triangle. [Zentralbibliothek, Zurich]\n\nAppendix: Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach, Mathematician 95 Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach.\nPublished for the first time in Genie und Krankheit by Theodor Spoerri. [New\nYork Academy of Medicine] By 1819 the father had become president of the court\nof appeals in Ansbach. In an 1819 Christmas letter from Ansbach to his father,\nthe jurist writes at great length about Karl's gifts in mathematics and\nphysics. He says that Karl had given some thought to jurisprudence as a\nprofession, but that it was his present ambition to become an engineer in the\narmy. After a short stay at Erlangen, Karl transferred to the University of\nFreiburg (Br.). He did so in order that he might continue his studies in\nmathematics with Karl Buzengeiger, who is credited with having had a great\ninfluence upon the young mathematician. In fact, Feuerbach's 1822 publication\nEigenschaften einiger merkwurdigen Punkte ...) features an introduction (of 16\npages) by this same professor. No doubt Buzengeiger wished to use this means\nto introduce a talented young student to the academic world. However, in his\nintroduction, he says scarcely a word about the student or any of the\ngeometric discoveries that followed in the ensuing pages. As the time passes,\none can read the gradually growing pride and joy of the father in the son's\naccomplishments. He writes of\n\n96 Circles the little book that Karl published in 1822 and asks a dear friend\nto do what she can to bring the book to the attention of influential people in\nBavaria. The Feuerbachs were, after all, not native Bavarians; and moreover\nthey were Protestants in a predominantly Catholic state. For these reasons the\nfather feared that the son might encounter some difficulty in finding a place\nin the academic profession. When the son was appointed professor of\nmathematics at the Gymnasium at Erlangen everything seemed to be going well.\nAnd then very suddenly, completely without warning and in a most humiliating\nmanner, the father's pride, ambitions, and joy in the son Karl were shattered\nby a devastating blow. One day, as Karl was walking to school, he was arrested\non the street. He was one of a group of 20 young men who were rounded up and\nlater imprisoned in the New Tower in Munich. The men were arrested because of\nthe political nature of the activities of an organization to which they had\nbelonged as undergraduates. Karl had been known as a gay and carefree student\nin the early days of his university career. He had incurred debts, and he was\nat times impetuous and unconventional. However, between the lines of his\nfather's letters, one can read the thought that the incident may have been\ninstigated by the father's political enemies. In a long letter of 1 July 1827,\nthe father pours out the anguish in his heart to a very dear personal friend.\nHe tells how the weeks and months were allowed to drag on without action and\nthat Karl was not allowed to receive letters or visitors. Karl became obsessed\nby the idea that only his death could free his 19 companions. He made two\nseparate attempts at suicide. One evening he was found unconscious from loss\nof blood after having cut the veins in his feet. He was transferred to a\nhospital and then made a second attempt at suicide by jumping out a window. He\nwas saved from death by landing in a deep snow bank but was permanently\ncrippled as a result of the accident. The father writes bitterly of the fact\nthat he was not more closely guarded, particularly since he had been declared\non the verge of a mental breakdown when he was arrested. A short time later,\nKarl was paroled in the custody of his former teacher in Munich, Friedrich\nThiersch (10), a close friend of the Feuerbach family. One of the 20 young men\ndied while in prison. Finally, after 14 months, a\n\nAppendix: Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach, Mathematician 97 trial was held, the men\nwere vindicated, released, and allowed to resume their normal activities. For\nabout a year Karl seemed to want nothing more than the companionship of his\nbrothers and sisters, the comfort of his father's home at Ansbach, and the\npeace and quiet that would allow him to complete some mathematical research on\nwhich he had been working while he was in prison in Munich. It is doubtful\nthat this piece of work could have had any greater compliment than the\ncritical analysis to which it was subjected by Cantor in his article in the\nSitzungsberichte der Heidelberg Akademie der Wissenschaften (8). In a final\nsummary Cantor says that Feuerbach in this work proved himself to be an\nindependent codiscov- erer with Mobius of the theory of the homogeneous\ncoordinates of a point in space. Feuerbach's development of the theory of\nhomogeneous coordinates is his second and last study. It is contained in three\nseparate units. First there was a brief notice in Oken's Isis (11) written\nfrom Ansbach and dated 22 October 1826 under the heading \"Einleitung zu dem\nWerke Analysis der dreyeckigen Pyra- mide durch die Methode der Coordinaten\nund Projectionen. Ein Beytrag zu der analytischen Geometrie von Dr. Karl\nWilhelm Feuerbach, Prof. d. Math.\" (Introduction to the analysis of the\ntriangular pyramid, by means of the methods of coordinates and projections. A\nstudy in analytic geometry). In this brief notice, Feuerbach gives a summary\nof his results, lists references, and says that he hopes to find a publisher\nfor the entire work. The following year, 1827, the material was published in a\n48-page booklet at Nuremburg under the title Grundriss zu analytischen\nUntersuchungen der dreyeckigen Pyramide (Foundations of the analytic theory of\nthe triangular pyramid). The third unit in this study is an unpublished\nmanuscript in Feuerbach's handwriting, dated 7 July 1826—a manuscript that is\ndiscussed at great length by Cantor (8). However, Feuerbach's work on the\ntriangular pyramid did not capture the imagination, as did his earlier\npublication Eigenschaften einiger merkwurdigen Punkte— Many years after his\ndeath an effort was made to find a publisher for his manuscript of 1826, but\nthese efforts were unsuccessful. In passing it is worthy of note that\nFeuerbach's Grundriss... , published at\n\n98 Circles Nuremburg, and Mobius' Der barycentrische Calcul, published at\nLeipzig, both bear the date 1827. When the young men who were arrested with\nFeuerbach had finally been released from prison, King Maximilian Joseph took\ngreat pains to help them return to a normal life. Feuerbach was appointed\nprofessor of mathematics at the Gymnasium at Hof. But at Hof Feuerbach was far\nfrom happy. Apparently he found no substitute at Hof for the companionship of\nhis brothers and sisters, for the vivid personalities in his father's circle\nof friends, and for the gay university life at Erlangen. Before long he\nsuffered such a severe relapse in his illness that he was forced to give up\nhis teaching. Two of his brothers, Eduard and Ludwig, brought him back from\nHof to Erlangen for medical treatment. By 1828 he had recovered sufficiently\nto resume teaching at the Gymnasium at Erlangen. But one day he appeared in\nclass with a drawn sword and threatened to cut off the head of every student\nin the class who could not solve the equations he had written on the\nblackboard. After this episode he was permanently retired. Gradually he\nwithdrew more and more from reality. He allowed his hair, beard, and nails to\ngrow long; he would stare at occasional visitors without any sign of emotion;\nand his conversation consisted only of low mumbled tones without meaning or\nexpression. And then there is no further word about Karl, not even in his\nfather's letters. His father ends a letter of 6 July 1829, from Ans- bach to\nthe son Friedrich in Erlangen, with the sentence \"Stay well—you and Eduard and\nLudwig—and let me hear from you soon.\" Karl lived in retirement in Erlangen\nfor 6 years and then died quietly on 12 March 1834. Biographers of the\nFeuerbach family have been unexpectedly generous in granting space to Karl and\nhis accomplishments in mathematics (12). But there is little about him in\nbooks on mathematics beyond the aforementioned article by Cantor (8) and\npractically nothing about him in any English language source. I can think of\nno more appropriate ending for this article than a very liberal interpretation\nof part of a letter that was written by Karl while he was imprisoned in the\nNew Tower in Munich: I will step lightly on my tiptoes, softly, slowly, and\nquietly, as is customary among ghosts, and then I will wriggle through the\nsecret little knothole I have found in the\n\nAppendix: Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach, Mathematician 99 oaken door of my cell. I\nwill go right up to the attic and find my way there through the things that\nare covered up and stored away, and then slip out to freedom through a crack\nunder the eaves. I will take a long deep breath, and then soar up and up,\nhither and yon, and I won't stop until I reach the benevolent moon. Then I\nwill sit down on the very tip of the left horn of the moon, and sing a song of\nfarewell to the earth and my beloved brothers and sisters. I will tarry a\nwhile and wait patiently for the great comet that is supposed to appear in\n1825, and I hope to beg for a tiny spot in the dust of the comet's trail that\nshall be mine and mine alone. And then with full sails, I will fly away over\nall the worlds. References 1.

THIS\nREVISED EDITION of a mathematical classic originally published in 1957 will\nbring to a new generation of students the enjoyment of investigating that\nsimplest of mathematical figures, the circle As a concession to the general\nneglect of geometry in school and college curricula, however, the author has\nsupplemented this new edition with a chapter 0 designed to introduce readers\nto the special vocabulary of circle concepts with which the author could\nassume his readers of two generations ago were familiar. For example, Pedoe\ncarefully explains what is meant by the circumcircle, incircle, and cxcircles\nof a triangle as well as the circum- centre, incentre, and orthoccntre. The\nreader can then understand his discussion in Chapter 1 of the nine-point\ncircle, and of Feuerbach's theorem. As an appendix, Pedoe includes a\nbiographical article by Laura Guggenbuhl on Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach, a little-\nknown mathematician with a tragically short life, who published his theorem in\na slender geometric treatise in 1822. Readers of Circles need only be armed\nwith paper, pencil, compass and straightedge to find great pleasure in\nfollowing the constructions and theorems. Those who think that geometry using\nEuclidean tools died out with the ancient Greeks will be pleasantly surprised\nto learn many interesting results which were only discovered in modern times.\nAnd those who think that they learned all they needed to know about circles in\nhigh school will find much to enlighten them in chapters dealing with the\nrepresentation of a circle by a point in three- space, a model for non-\nEuclidean geometry, and isoperimetric property of the circle. Exercises (with\nsolutions) complement the discussion and help the reader benefit fully from\nthis mathematical view of circles. ISBN-0-88385-518-6\n\n",

Using linear algebra and trans-\n\nformation groups, this book provides a readable exposition of how these\n\nclassical geometries are both differentiated and connected. Following\n\nCayley and Klein, the book builds on projective and inversive geometry\n\nto construct “linear” and “circular” geometries, including classical real\n\nmetric spaces like Euclidean, hyperbolic, elliptic, and spherical, as well\n\nas their unitary counterparts. The first part of the book deals with the\n\nfoundations and general properties of the various kinds of geometries.\n\nThe latter part studies discrete-geometric structures and their symme-\n\ntries in various spaces. Written for graduate students, the book includes\n\nnumerous exercises and covers both classical results and new research\n\nin the field. An understanding of analytic geometry, linear algebra, and\n\nelementary group theory is assumed.\n\n**Norman W. Johnson** was Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Wheaton\n\nCollege, Massachusetts. Johnson authored and coauthored numerous\n\njournal articles on geometry and algebra, and his 1966 paper ‘Convey\n\nPolyhedra with Regular Faces’ enumerated what have come to be called\n\nthe Johnson solids. He was a frequent participant in international con-\n\nferences and a member of the American Mathematical Society and the\n\nMathematical Association of America.\n\n**Norman Johnson: An Appreciation**\n\n**by Thomas Banchoff**\n\nNorman Johnson passed away on July 13, 2017, just a few months short\n\nof the scheduled appearance of his magnum opus, _Geometries and Trans-_\n\n_formations_. It was just over fifty years ago in 1966 that his most famous\n\npublication appeared in the _Canadian Journal of Mathematics_ : “Convex\n\nPolyhedra with Regular Faces,” presenting the complete list of ninety-two\n\nexamples of what are now universally known as Johnson Solids. He not\n\nonly described all of the symmetry groups of the solids; he also devised\n\nnames for each of them, containing enough information to exhibit their\n\nconstituent elements and the way they were arranged.\n\nNow, as a result of this new volume, he will be further appreciated for\n\nhis compendium of all the major geometric theories together with their\n\nfull groups of transformations that preserve their essential characteristic\n\nfeatures. In this process, he follows the spirit of Felix Klein and his Erlan-\n\ngen Program, first enunciated in 1870. Once again, a specific personal\n\ncontribution to this achievement is his facility for providing descriptive\n\nnames for each of the types of transformations that characterize a given\n\ngeometry. His book will be an instant classic, giving an overview that will\n\nserve as an introduction to new subjects as well as an authoritative refer-\n\nence for established theories. In the last few chapters, he includes a similar\n\ntreatment of finite symmetry groups in the tradition of his advisor and\n\nmentor, H. S. M. Coxeter.\n\nIt is fitting that the cover image and the formal announcement of the\n\nforthcoming book were first released by Cambridge University Press at\n\nthe annual summer MathFest of the Mathematical Association of Amer-\n\nica. Norman Johnson was a regular participant in the MathFest meetings,\n\nand in 2016 he was honored as the person there who had been a member\n\nof the MAA for the longest time, at sixty-three years. His friends and col-\n\nleagues are saddened to learn of his passing even as we look forward to\n\nhis new geometrical masterwork.\n\n![](index-5_1.png)\n\nG E O M E T R I E S A N D\n\nT R A N S F O R M AT I O N S\n\nNorman W.

the\n\nonly kind there was or could be, eventually spawned both higher-\n\ndimensional Euclidean space and the classical non-Euclidean metric\n\nspaces—hyperbolic, elliptic, and spherical—as well as more loosely\n\nstructured systems such as affine, projective, and inversive geome-\n\ntry. This book is concerned with how these various geometries are\n\nrelated, with particular attention paid to their transformation groups,\n\nboth continuous and discrete. In the spirit of Cayley and Klein, all the\n\nsystems to be considered will be presented as specializations of some\n\nprojective space.\n\nAs first demonstrated by von Staudt in 1857, projective spaces\n\nhave an intrinsic algebraic structure, which is manifested when they\n\nare suitably coordinatized. While synthetic methods can still be\n\nemployed, geometric results can also be obtained via the underlying\n\nalgebra. In a brief treatment of the foundations of projective geom-\n\netry, I give a categorical set of axioms for the real projective plane.\n\nIn developing the general theory of projective _n_ -space and other\n\nspaces, however, I make free use of coordinates, mappings, and other\n\nalgebraic concepts, including cross ratios.\n\nLike Euclidean space, elliptic and hyperbolic spaces are both “lin-\n\near,” in the sense that two coplanar lines meet in at most one point.\n\nBut spherical space is “circular”: two great circles on a sphere always\n\nmeet in a pair of antipodal points. Each of these spaces can be\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\ncoordinatized over the real field, and each of them can be derived\n\ndirectly or indirectly from real projective space. For the three lin-\n\near geometries, a metric can be induced by specializing an _absolute_\n\n_polarity_ in projective _n_ -space P _n_ or one of its hyperplanes. Fixing a\n_central inversion_ in inversive _n_ -space, realized as an oval _n_ -quadric\nin P _n_ +1, similarly produces one or another kind of circular metric\n\nspace.\n\nEach of these real metric spaces has a _unitary_ counterpart that can\n\nbe derived analogously from complex projective space and coordina-\n\ntized over the complex field. A unitary _n_ -space may be represented\n\nisometrically by a real space of dimension 2 _n_ or 2 _n_ \\+ 1, and vice\n\nversa—a familiar example being the Argand diagram identifying\n\ncomplex numbers with points of the Euclidean plane. Many of the\n\nconnections between real spaces and representations involving com-\n\nplex numbers or quaternions are well known, but new ground has\n\nbeen broken by Ahlfors (1985), Wilker (1993), Goldman (1999), and\n\nothers.\n\nFrom the point and hyperplane coordinates of a projective space\n\nwe may construct coordinates for a metric space derived from it, in\n\nterms of which properties of the space may be described and dis-\n\ntances and angles measured. Many of the formulas obtained exhibit\n\nan obvious symmetry, a consequence of the Principle of Duality that\n\npermits the interchange of projective subspaces of complementary\n\ndimensions. Along with the related concept of dual vector spaces,\n\nthat principle also finds expression in convenient notations for coor-\n\ndinates and for corresponding bilinear and quadratic forms. The\n\npseudo-symmetry of _real_ and _imaginary_ is likewise evident in inver-\n\nsive geometry as well as in the metric properties of hyperbolic and\n\nelliptic geometry.\n\nWith coordinates taken as vectors, transformations may be rep-\n\nresented by matrices, facilitating the description and classification of\n\ngeometric groups, as in the famous _Erlanger Programm_ proposed by\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nKlein in 1872. Many of these occur among what Weyl called the “clas-\n\nsical groups,” and each geometric group is placed in an algebraic\n\ncontext, so that its relationship to other groups may be readily\n\nseen.\n\nWhile there are still excellent treatments like that of Sossinsky\n\n(2012) that make little use of vectors and matrices, in recent years the\n\nstudy of geometries and transformations has benefited from the appli-\n\ncation of the methods of linear algebra. The treatment here has much\n\nin common with the approaches taken by such writers as Artzy (1965),\n\nSnapper & Troyer (1971), Burn (1985), and Neumann, Stoy & Thomp-\n\nson (1994). Conversely, as shown in some detail by Beardon (2005),\n\nmany algebraic concepts can be illuminated by placing them in the\n\nframework of geometric transformations.\n\nOn the other hand, this book is not meant to be a text for a course\n\nin linear algebra, projective geometry, or non-Euclidean geometry,\n\nnor is it an attempt to synthesize some combination of those sub-\n\njects in the manner of Baer (1952) or Onishchik & Sulanke (2006).\n\nMy objective is rather to explain how all these things fit together.\n\nThe first ten chapters of the book essentially deal with transforma-\n\ntions of geometries, and the last five with symmetries of geometric fig-\n\nures. Each continuous group of geometric transformations has various\n\ndiscrete subgroups, which are of interest both in their own right and as\n\nthe symmetry groups of polytopes, tilings, or patterns. Every isometry\n\nof spherical, Euclidean, or hyperbolic space can be expressed as the\n\nproduct of reflections, and discrete groups generated by reflections—\n\nknown as _Coxeter groups_ —are of particular importance. Finite and\n\ninfinite symmetry groups are subgroups or extensions of spherical and\n\nEuclidean Coxeter groups. Irreducible Euclidean Coxeter groups are\n\nclosely related to simple Lie groups.\n\nCertain numerical properties of hyperbolic Coxeter groups have\n\nbeen determined by Ruth Kellerhals and by John G. Ratcliffe and\n\nSteven Tschantz, as well as by the four of us together. A number\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\nof discrete groups operating in hyperbolic _n_ -space (2 ≤ _n_ ≤ 5)\n\ncorrespond to linear fractional transformations over rings of real,\n\ncomplex, or quaternionic integers. The associated _modular groups_ are\n\ndiscussed in the final two chapters, which have for the most part been\n\nextracted from work done jointly with Asia Ivić Weiss.\n\nOne of the advantages of building a theory of geometries and\n\ntransformations on the foundation of vector spaces and matrices is\n\nthat many geometric propositions are easy to verify algebraically.\n\nConsequently, many proofs are only sketched or left as exercises.\n\nWhere appropriate, however, I provide explanatory details or give\n\nreferences to places where proofs can be found. These include both\n\noriginal sources and standard texts like those by Veblen & Young\n\nand Coxeter, as well as relevant works by contemporary authors.\n\nIn any case, results are not generally presented as formal theo-\n\nrems.\n\nThe reader is assumed to have a basic understanding of analytic\n\ngeometry and linear algebra, as well as of elementary group theory.\n\nI also take for granted the reader’s familiarity with the essentials of\n\nEuclidean plane geometry. Some prior knowledge of the properties\n\nof non-Euclidean spaces and of real projective, affine, and inversive\n\ngeometry would be helpful but is not required. A few Preliminaries\n\nprovide a short review. It is my hope that the book may serve not only\n\nas a possible text for an advanced geometry course but also as a read-\n\nable exposition of how the classical geometries are both differentiated\n\nand connected by their groups of transformations.\n\nMany of the ideas in this book are variations on themes pursued\n\nby my mentor, Donald Coxeter, who in the course of his long life did\n\nmuch to rescue geometry from oblivion. I am also grateful for the sup-\n\nport and encouragement of my fellow Coxeter students Asia Weiss,\n\nBarry Monson, and the late John Wilker, as well as many stimulating\n\nexchanges with Egon Schulte and Peter McMullen. It was also a priv-\n\nilege to collaborate with Ruth Kellerhals, John Ratcliffe, and Steve\n\nTschantz. Many details of the book itself benefited from the assistance\n\nPreface\n\nxv\n\nof Tom Ruen, whose comments and suggestions were extremely help-\n\nful, along with Anton Sherwood and George Olshevsky. And I owe\n\nmany thanks to my editors and the production staff at Cambridge,\n\nespecially Katie Leach, Adam Kratoska, and Mark Fox.\n\nP R E L I M I NA R I E S\n\nThe invention of coordinates by Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) and\n\nRené Descartes (1596–1650) united what had been seen as the sep-\n\narate realms of geometry and algebra. Still deeper connections were\n\nrevealed by the subsequent development of new kinds of geometry\n\nand the systematization of algebra. Before we proceed to examine\n\nsome of those connections, it will be useful to set down a few basic\n\nfacts about the geometries and algebraic systems themselves.\n\n**A.** _Euclidean and other geometries._ Euclid’s _Elements_ deals with\nrelations among points, lines, and planes and properties of geometric\n\nfigures such as triangles, circles, and spheres. Among the fundamen-\n\ntal concepts of Euclidean plane geometry are _collinearity_ , _congruence_ ,\n_perpendicularity_ , and _parallelism_. A rigorous treatment also involves\n_order_ and _continuity_ —relations not explicitly dealt with in the\n_Elements_. By omitting or modifying some of these concepts, a variety\n\nof other geometries can be constructed: the real affine and projec-\n\ntive planes, the real inversive sphere, and the so-called non-Euclidean\n\ngeometries. Like Euclidean geometry, all of these alternative systems\n\nhave extensions to higher-dimensional spaces.\n\nAny two points in the _Euclidean plane_ E2 are joined by a unique\n\nline, and lines are of infinite extent. Distances and areas can be\n\nmeasured with the aid of an arbitrarily chosen unit of length. Right\n\nangles provide a standard for angular measure. The Euclidean parallel\n\n1\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\npostulate is equivalent to the assertion that through any point not on\n\na given line there can be drawn _just one_ line that does not intersect\n\nit. (The other postulates imply the existence of _at least one_ such line.)\n\nFrom these assumptions it follows that the sum of the interior angles\n\nof every triangle is equal to two right angles, and that (the area of) the\n\nsquare on the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of (the\n\nareas of) the squares on the other two sides.\n\nThe real _affine plane_ A2 is the Euclidean plane without perpen-\n\ndicularity. There is no way to measure angles, and distances can be\n\ncompared only for points on a line or on parallel lines. Nevertheless,\n\nareas can still be determined. Up to size, all triangles are equivalent,\n\nas are all parallelograms; there is no such thing as a right triangle or\n\na square. Conics can be distinguished only as ellipses, parabolas, and\n\nhyperbolas—there are no circles.\n\nBy adopting the convention that all the affine lines parallel in a\n\ngiven direction meet in a unique “point at infinity” and that all such\n\npoints lie on a single “line at infinity,” we eliminate parallelism. When\n\nwe admit the new points and the new line into the fold with the same\n\nrights and privileges as all the others, we have the real _projective plane_\n\nP2. Incidences now exhibit a “principle of duality”: any two points are\n\njoined by a unique line, and any two lines meet in a unique point.\n\nAngular measure, distance, and area are all undefined. Not only all\n\ntriangles but all quadrilaterals are alike, and there is only one kind of\n\nnondegenerate conic. Congruence, perpendicularity, and parallelism\n\nhave all disappeared; only the notion of collinearity remains.\n\nAlternatively, the Euclidean plane can be given the topology of\n\na sphere by adjoining a single “exceptional point” common to all\n\nlines. A line may then be regarded as a kind of circle. Extended\n\nlines and ordinary circles together form a set of “inversive circles”\n\non the real _inversive sphere_ I2. Any three points lie on a unique inver-\n\nsive circle; points lying on the same circle are _concyclic_. Two circles\n\nmay meet in two, one, or no real points. The distance between two\n\npoints cannot be measured, but the angle between two intersecting\n\nPreliminaries\n\n3\n\ncircles can be. Thus collinearity has been replaced by concyclicity, and\n\nperpendicularity is still meaningful, but congruence and parallelism\n\nhave been eliminated.\n\nThough long suspected of being a theorem in disguise, the par-\n\nallel postulate was eventually shown to be independent of the other\n\nassumptions governing the Euclidean plane. Replacing it with the con-\n\ntrary hypothesis—that through any point not on a given line there is\n\n_more than one_ line not intersecting it—we obtain the _hyperbolic plane_\n\nof Bolyai and Lobachevsky. Moreover, if we do not assume that lines\n\nare of infinite length, we can construct a metrical geometry in which\n\nthere are _no_ nonintersecting lines: in the _elliptic plane_(the projective\nplane with a metric), any two lines meet in a point.\n\nOn the _elliptic sphere_(or simply “the sphere”), points come in\n\nantipodal pairs, and the role of lines is played by great circles; any\n\ntwo nonantipodal points lie on a unique great circle, and any two\n\ngreat circles meet in a pair of antipodal points. When antipodal points\n\nare identified, great circles of the elliptic sphere become lines of\n\nthe elliptic plane (the two geometries are sometimes distinguished\n\nas “double elliptic” and “single elliptic” planes). Another possibility\n\nis the _hyperbolic sphere_ , comprising two antipodal hemispheres sep-\n\narated by an “equatorial circle” of self-antipodal points. Two great\n\ncircles either meet in a pair of antipodal points, are tangent at an equa-\n\ntorial point, or do not meet. Identification of antipodal points converts\n\ngreat circles of the hyperbolic sphere into lines of the hyperbolic\n\nplane.\n\nThe hyperbolic and elliptic planes and the elliptic sphere constitute\n\nthe classical non-Euclidean geometries. Along with the hyperbolic\n\nsphere, they share with the Euclidean plane the notions of collinear-\n\nity (or concyclicity), congruence, and perpendicularity. One notable\n\ndifference is that the sum of the interior angles of a non-Euclidean tri-\n\nangle depends on its area, being proportionally greater than two right\n\nangles for an elliptic (spherical) triangle or proportionally less for a\n\nhyperbolic one.\n\n4\n\nPreliminaries\n\nOther properties of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries\n\n(“real metric spaces”) and how they are related to real affine, pro-\n\njective, or inversive geometry will be described in greater detail\n\nbeginning in Chapter 1. Although each geometry can be based on a\n\nselected set of postulates, a more instructive approach characterizes\n\ngeometries by their transformation groups.\n\n**B.** _Algebraic systems._ A _group_ is a nonempty set _G_ and a binary\noperation _G_ × _G_ → _G_ , with ( _a_ , _b_) → _ab_ , satisfying the\nassociative law ( _ab_) _c_ = _a_( _bc_), having an identity element, and with\neach element having a unique inverse. The group operation is commonly taken as\n\nmultiplication, with the identity element denoted by 1 and the inverse\n\nof _a_ by _a_ −1. The commutative law _ab_ = _ba_ may or may not hold; when it\ndoes, the group is said to be _abelian_. Additive notation is sometimes\n\nused for abelian groups, with the identity denoted by 0 and the inverse\n\nof _a_ by − _a_. The number of elements in a group _G_ is its _order_ | _G_ |. \n\nA subset of a group _G_ that is itself a group with the same operation\n\nis a _subgroup_. For each element _a_ of a (multiplicative) group _G_ , the\nset of all distinct integral powers of _a_ forms an abelian subgroup _a_ ; the\norder of _a_ is the _period_ of _a_. The _center_ Z( _G_) is the subgroup of\nelements that commute with every element of _G_.\n\nA subgroup _H_ of a group _G_ is said to be _normal_(or “self-\n\nconjugate”) if for any element _h_ ∈ _H_ its conjugate _ghg_ −1 by any element\n_g_ ∈ _G_ is in _H_ , i.e., if _gHg_ −1 ⊆ _H_ for all _g_ ∈ _G_ ; we write\nthis as _H_ _G_. If _H_ is a normal subgroup of _G_ , then for every _g_ ∈ _G_\n, the left coset _gH_ = { _gh_ : _h_ ∈ _H_} is the same as the right coset\n_Hg_ = { _hg_ : _h_ ∈ _H_}, and the set _G/H_ of all such cosets is a\ngroup—the _quotient_ _group_(or “factor group”) of _G_ by _H_ —with ( _g_ 1\n_H_)( _g_ 2 _H_) = ( _g_ 1 _g_ 2) _H_.\n\nThe number | _G_ : _H_ | of cosets is the _index_ of _H_ in _G_. The center Z( _G_) of any group _G_ is always normal, and _G/_ Z( _G_) is the _central quotient_ _group_. \n\nIf _a_ and _b_ are two elements of a group _G_ , the element _a_ −1 _b_ −1\n_ab_ is their _commutator_ ; this differs from the identity precisely when\n\nPreliminaries\n\n5\n\n_ab_ = _ba_. The set of commutators generates a normal subgroup of _G_ , the\n_commutator subgroup_(or “derived group”) _G_ . The abelian group\n\n_G/G_ is the _commutator quotient group_.\n\nIf _H_ and _K_ are subgroups of a (multiplicative) group _G_ having only the\nidentity element 1 in common, if every element _g_ ∈ _G_ is the product of\nsome _h_ ∈ _H_ and some _k_ ∈ _K_ , and if _hk_ = _kh_ for every _h_ ∈ _H_\n\nand every _k_ ∈ _K_ , then _G_ is the _direct product_ of _H_ and _K_ , and we\nwrite _G_ = _H_ × _K_. Necessarily both _H_ and _K_ are normal subgroups of\n_G_.\n\nA group _G_ may be presented in terms of a subset _S_ of _generators_ , and we\nwrite _G_ = _S_ , if every element of _G_ can be expressed as a product of\n(positive or negative) powers of elements of _S_. The generators satisfy\ncertain _relations_ , and _G_ is the largest group for which the specified\nrelations (but no others independent of them) hold. Thus the\n\n_cyclic_ group C _p_ , of order _p_ , is the group generated by a single\nelement _a_ satisfying the relation _ap_ = 1, while the _dihedral_ group D _p_\n, of order 2 _p_ , is generated by elements _a_ and _b_ satisfying the\nrelations _a_ 2 = _b_ 2 =\n\n( _ab_) _p_ = 1. For _p_ ≥ 3, these are, respectively, the rotation group and\nthe full symmetry group (including reflections) of a regular _p_ -gon.\n\nA _transformation_ is a permutation of the elements of an arbitrary\n\nset—e.g., some or all of the points of a space—or a mapping of one set\n\ninto another. All the permutations of a given set _S_ form the _symmetric_\n\ngroup Sym( _S_), any subgroup of which is a _transformation group_ acting on\n_S_. A permutation of a finite set is _even_ or _odd_ according as it can be\nexpressed as the product of an even or an odd number of transposi-tions\ninterchanging two elements. The symmetric group on a set with\n\n_n_ elements is denoted by S _n_ and has order _n_!. For _n_ ≥ 2, the even\npermutations constitute a subgroup of index 2 in S _n_ , the _alternating_\ngroup A _n_ , of order ½ _n_!.\n\nWhen the points of a geometry are assigned suitable coordinates,\n\neach transformation preserving the fundamental properties of the\n\ngeometry is represented by a particular type of invertible matrix,\n\nand groups of transformations correspond to multiplicative groups of\n\nmatrices. Coordinates and matrix entries may be real numbers, or they\n\n6\n\nPreliminaries\n\nmay belong to more general number systems, e.g., _rings_. If we define\n\na _semigroup_ as a nonempty set with an associative binary operation\n\nbut possibly lacking an identity element or inverses, then a ring R is a\n\nset whose elements form both an additive abelian group and a multi-\n\nplicative semigroup, satisfying the distributive laws _a_( _b_ \\+ _c_) = _ab_\n\\+ _ac_ and ( _a_ \\+ _b_) _c_ = _ac_ \\+ _bc_. The additive identity of R is\nits _zero_ , and the multiplicative identity (if any) is its _unity_. The\n_trivial_ ring 0 has only one element.\n\nA ring in which multiplication is commutative is a _commutative_\n\n_ring_. An _integral domain_ is a nontrivial commutative ring with unity\nwithout zero divisors, i.e., such that _ab_ = 0 implies that either _a_ = 0\n\nor _b_ = 0. An integral domain in which every element _a_ = 0 has an\n\ninverse _a_ −1, so that the nonzero elements form a multiplicative group,\n\nis a _field_. Among the systems of interest are the integral domain Z\n\nof integers and the fields Q, R, and C of rational, real, and complex\n\nnumbers. For each prime or prime power _q_ there is a finite field F _q_\n\nwith _q_ elements; such systems, also called _Galois fields_ and denoted GF(\n_q_), were first investigated by Évariste Galois (1811–1832).\n\nA ring R is _ordered_ if it has a nonempty subset R+ of _positive_ ele-\n\nments, closed under both ring operations, such that for each element\n\n_a_ in R just one of three cases holds: _a_ ∈ R+, _a_ = 0, or − _a_ ∈ R+; in\nthe last case, _a_ is said to be _negative_. Then _a < b _ if and only if _b_\n− _a_ is positive. The ring Z and the fields Q and R are ordered, but the\nfield\n\nC is not. (Either i or −i would have to be positive, but their squares\n\nboth equal the negative number −1.) No finite ring can be ordered.\n\nThe real field R, which has additional properties of continuity, is a\n\n_complete_ ordered field.\n\nA transformation _T_ mapping the elements of a group, ring, or\n\nother algebraic system _U_ to a similar system _V_ , written _T_ : _U_ → _V_ ,\nis a _homomorphism_ if it preserves the system operation(s), carry-ing sums or\nproducts in the _domain U_ into sums or products in the\n\n_codomain V_. The _kernel_ Ker _T_ is the set of elements in _U_ that are\nmapped into the identity element of _V_(the zero element in the case\n\nPreliminaries\n\n7\n\nof a ring homomorphism). The _image_(or “range”) Img _T_ is the set of\n\nelements in _V_ to which elements of _U_ are mapped. When the systems\n\nare groups, Ker _T_ is a normal subgroup of _U_ and Img _T_ is a subgroup of\n_V_.\n\nThe mapping _T_ : _U_ → _V_ is a _monomorphism_ or “one-to-one”\n\ntransformation if Ker _T_ contains only the identity element of _U_ ; it\n\nis an _epimorphism_ or “onto” transformation if Img _T_ is the entirety of\n_V_. A homomorphism taking _U_ to _V_ that is both one to one and onto has an\ninverse taking _V_ to _U_ that is also a homomorphism. Such a mapping is\ncalled an _isomorphism_(we write _U_ ∼\n\n= _V_) or, if _U_ and\n\n_V_ are the same system, an _automorphism_. If _a_ is a fixed element of a\ngroup _G_ , the mapping _x_ → _axa_ −1 (“conjugation by _a_ ”) is an _inner_\n_automorphism_ of _G_.\n\nWhen transformations of geometric points are expressed as alge-\n\nbraic homomorphisms, successive operations are normally carried out\n\nfrom left to right, as in the diagram\n\n_T_\n\n_T_\n\n_U_\n\n1\n\n−→ _V_ 2\n\n−→ _W_\n\nThe _product_( _T_ 1 followed by _T_ 2) of the homomorphisms _T_ 1 : _U_ → _V_\n\nand _T_ 2 : _V_ → _W_ is then the homomorphism _T_ 1 _T_ 2 : _U_ → _W_ , with\n_x_( _T_ 1 _T_ 2) defined as ( _xT_ 1) _T_ 2.∗ Multiplication of homomorphisms\nis always associative: ( _T_ 1 _T_ 2) _T_ 3 = _T_ 1( _T_ 2 _T_ 3). Any\nalgebraic system has at least the identity automorphism _x_ → _x_ , and every\nautomorphism has\n\nan inverse. Thus the set of all automorphisms of an algebraic system\n\nforms a group.\n\n**C.** _Linear algebra._ Of primary importance in our study of geome-\n\ntries and transformations are _vector spaces_ , additive abelian groups\n\n∗ Homomorphisms may be distinguished from ordinary functions, which typically\n\nprecede their arguments and so are normally composed from right to left.\nBesides\n\nallowing them to be carried out in the order they are written, left-to-right\ncom-\n\nposition of point mappings is compatible with transformations of dual systems\n\n(e.g., left and right vector spaces) as well as systems in which\nmultiplication is\n\nnoncommutative.\n\n8\n\nPreliminaries\n\nwhose elements (“vectors”) can be multiplied by the elements of a\n\nfield (“scalars”). The set of vectors is closed under such “scalar mul-\n\ntiplication”; i.e., if _**V**_ is a (left) vector space over a field F, then\nfor all scalars λ in F and all vectors **x** in _**V**_ , λ**x** is also in\n_**V**_. Scalar multiplication also has the properties\n\nλ(**x** \\+ **y**) = λ**x** \\+ λ**y** , ( _κ_ \\+ λ)**x** = _κ_**x** \\+ λ**x** ,\n( _κ_ λ)**x** = _κ_(λ**x**), 1**x** = **x**.\n\nFor each positive integer _n_ , the canonical vector space F _n_ comprises all\nlists ( _x_ 1, _. . ._ , _xn_) of _n_ elements of F (the “entries” of the\nlist), with element-by-element addition and scalar multiplication. The vector\n\nspace F1 is the field F itself.\n\nGiven an ordered set [**x** 1, _. . ._ , **x** _k_] of vectors in a vector\nspace _**V**_ , for any ordered set of scalars (λ1, _. . ._ , λ _k_) the\nvector λ1**x** 1 + · · · + λ _k_**x** _k_ is a _linear combination_ of the\nvectors. If _S_ is a subset of _**V**_ and if every vector **x** in _**V**_\ncan be expressed as a linear combination of vectors in _S_ , the set _S\nspans**V**_. If a linear combination of distinct vectors **x** _i_ in a set\n_S_ is the zero vector only when all the scalar coefficients λ _i_ are zero,\nthe vectors in _S_ are _linearly independent_. If the vectors in an ordered\nset _S_\n\nspanning a vector space _**V**_ are linearly independent, _S_ is a _basis_ for\n_**V**_ , and the expression for each **x** in _**V**_ is unique. Every vector\nspace has a basis, and the number of basis vectors, called the _dimension_ of\nthe\n\nvector space, is the same for any basis. (The empty set is a basis for the\n\nzero-dimensional vector space **0**.)\n\nA vector-space homomorphism, preserving vector sums and scalar\n\nmultiples, is a _linear transformation_. (When scalars are written on the\n\nleft, linear transformations go on the right, and vice versa.) If _**V**_ is a\nvector space over F, a linear transformation _**V**_ → F is a _linear form_ on\n\n_**V**_. In our treatment, coordinates of points and hyperplanes function as\nrow and column vectors, and geometric operations—expressed algebraically as\nlinear transformations of coordinates—are represented\n\nby matrices. Basic geometric properties, such as distances and angles,\n\nare defined by means of _bilinear forms_ , functions _**V**_ × _**V**_ → F\nthat map pairs of vectors into scalars, preserving linear combinations. The\n\nPreliminaries\n\n9\n\nrelevant theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces will be developed\n\nbeginning in Chapter 4.\n\nMany algebraic systems can be dualized. In particular, correspond-\n\ning to each linear form on a given vector space _**V**_ is a _covector_ of the\n_dual_ vector space ˇ\n\n_**V**_. The _annihilator_ of a vector **x** ∈ _**V**_ is the set of covectors\nˇ**u** ∈ ˇ\n\n_**V**_ for which the corresponding linear form maps **x** to 0.\n\nIf _**V**_ is a left vector space, its dual ˇ\n\n_**V**_ is a right vector space, and vice\n\nversa. If the elements of _**V**_ are rows, the elements of ˇ\n\n_**V**_ are columns.\n\nWhen _**V**_ is finite-dimensional, the dual of ˇ\n\n_**V**_ is isomorphic to _**V**_ , so\n\nthat _**V**_ and ˇ\n\n_**V**_ are mutually dual vector spaces.\n\nIf _**V**_ is an _n_ -dimensional vector space over a field F, we may\n\nexpress the fact that a covector ˇ**u** ∈ ˇ\n\n_**V**_ belongs to the annihilator of\n\na vector **x** ∈ _**V**_(and vice versa) by writing **x** ♦ ˇ**u**. A one-to-\none linear cotransformation _**V**_ → ˇ\n\n_**V**_ mapping each vector **x** to a covector ˇ**x** is\n\na _polarity_ provided that **x** ♦ ˇ**y** whenever **y** ♦ ˇ**x** , and\nvectors **x** and **y** are said to be _conjugate_ in the polarity. These\nconcepts can be extended\n\nto the ( _n_ − 1)-dimensional projective space P _**V**_ whose “points” are\none-dimensional subspaces **x** spanned by nonzero vectors **x** ∈ _**V**_.\n\nA _module_ has the structure of a vector space except that scalars are\n\nonly required to belong to a ring. An _algebra_**A** is a module over a ring R\nin which there is also defined a multiplication of module elements,\n\ndistributive over addition and such that\n\nλ(**xy**) = (λ**x**)**y** = **x**(λ**y**)\n\nfor all λ in R and all **x** and **y** in **A**. If each nonzero element has a\nmultiplicative inverse, **A** is a _division algebra_.\n\n**D.** _Analysis._ The assignment of coordinates establishes a corre-\n\nspondence between points of a geometric line and elements of some\n\nnumber system. When this system is an ordered field (e.g., Q or R),\n\nsets of collinear points have a definite linear or cyclic _order_ , which\n\ncan be described, following Moritz Pasch (1843–1930), in terms of one\n\n10\n\nPreliminaries\n\npoint lying between two others or, following Giovanni Vailati (1863–\n\n1909), one pair of points separating another pair. The order relation\n\ncan be used to define line segments, rays, and the like.\n\nThe property that sets real and complex geometries apart from\n\nothers is _continuity_ , which essentially means that no points are “miss-\n\ning” from a line. The notion of continuity is implicit in the theory of\n\nproportion developed by Eudoxus (fourth century BC) and presented\n\nin Book V of Euclid’s _Elements_. As we shall see in Chapter 2, a for-\n\nmal definition can be based on the theory of rational “cuts” invented\n\nby Richard Dedekind (1831–1916), so that each point but one of a\n\n“chain” corresponds to a unique real number. (If the definition of\n\ncontinuity were modified to allow infinitesimal quantities, one could\n\neven identify the points of a line with the “hyperreal” numbers of\n\nnonstandard analysis.)\n\n**E.** _Arithmetic._ A nonzero integer _b_ is a _divisor_ of an integer _a_ if\nthere is an integer _c_ such that _a_ = _bc_. A positive integer _p_ greater\nthan 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and _p_ itself is a _prime_. If _a_\nand _b_ are integers with _b > _ 0, then there exist unique integers _q_ (the\n“quotient”) and _r_(the “remainder”), such that _a_ = _bq_ \\+ _r_ with 0 ≤ _r\n< b_. The process of determining _q_ and _r_ is called the _division_\n_algorithm_.\n\nThe _greatest common divisor_ of two nonzero integers _a_ and _b_ is the\nlargest integer that is a divisor of both; we denote it by gcd( _a_ , _b_) or\nsimply ( _a_ , _b_). When ( _a_ , _b_) = 1, _a_ and _b_ are said to be\n_relatively prime_.\n\nGiven two nonzero integers _a_ and _b_ , we can repeatedly apply the division\nalgorithm to obtain a decreasing sequence of positive integers\n\n_r_ 1 _> r_ 2 _> _· · · _> rk_, where\n\n_a_ = _bq_ 1 + _r_ 1, _b_ = _r_ 1 _q_ 2 + _r_ 2, _r_ 1 = _r_ 2 _q_ 3 + _r_ 3,\n_. . ._ , _rk_ −1 = _rkqk_ +1 + 0.\n\nThen _rk_ , the last nonzero remainder, is the greatest common divisor\n\n( _a_ , _b_). This process, described in Book VII of the _Elements_ , is\ncalled the _Euclidean algorithm_.\n\nPreliminaries\n\n11\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm can be used to prove the Fundamen-\n\ntal Theorem of Arithmetic: every positive integer can be uniquely\n\nfactored into the product of powers of primes. These ideas can be\n\nextended to other integral domains and number systems, but not every\n\nsystem allows a version of the Euclidean algorithm or has the unique\n\nfactorization property.\n\n**F.** _Geometric transformations._ Each of the geometries described\n\nabove has certain sets of transformations that permute the points\n\nwhile preserving such properties as collinearity and congruence. All\n\nthe transformations that leave a particular property invariant form a\n\ngroup, and in later chapters we shall exhibit the relevant transforma-\n\ntion groups for the different geometries.\n\nFor each geometry to be considered coordinates can be assigned\n\nso that points correspond to vectors and geometric transformations\n\nto linear transformations of a vector space. Linear transformations\n\nin turn can be represented by matrices. When coordinate vectors\n\n**(** _x_**)** = ( _x_ 1, _. . ._ , _xn_) are regarded as rows (1 × _n_\nmatrices), a linear transformation **·** _A_ , determined by an _n_ × _n_\nmatrix _A_ , maps the point _X_\n\nwith coordinates **(** _x_**)** to the point _X_ with coordinates **(**\n_x_**)** _A_ , and geometric transformation groups correspond to\nmultiplicative groups of\n\nmatrices. As a rule, the groups in question turn out to be subgroups of\n\nthe _general linear_ group GL _n_ of invertible _n_ × _n_ matrices or its\ncentral quotient group, the _projective general linear_ group PGL _n_.\n\nIn a variation of this procedure, each point of a projective line FP1\n\nover a field F can be identified uniquely either with some element\n\n_x_ ∈ F or with the extended value ∞ (an extra element that behaves\n\nlike the reciprocal of 0). A “projectivity” of FP1 can be expressed as a\n\n_linear fractional_ transformation of the extended field F ∪ {∞}, defined\n\nfor given field elements _a_ , _b_ , _c_ , _d_( _ad_ − _bc_ = 0) by _x_ → _ax_\n\\+ _c_ ,\n\n_x_ ∈ F\\\\{ − _d/b_},\n\n_bx_ \\+ _d_\n\n12\n\nPreliminaries\n\nwith − _d/b_ → ∞ and ∞ → _a/b_ if _b_ = 0 and with ∞ → ∞ if _b_ = 0.\n\nSuch mappings can also be represented by 2 × 2 invertible matrices\n\nover F, constituting the projective general linear group PGL2(F).\n\nThis book is primarily concerned with geometries that can be coor-\n\ndinatized over the real field R, but many results can be generalized to\n\nthe complex field C and other systems, including the noncommutative\n\ndivision ring (“skew-field”) of quaternions. Also, real spaces may be\n\nrepresented by complex or quaternionic models. For example, the real\n\ninversive sphere I2 can be modeled by the complex projective line,\n\nwith circle-preserving “homographies” of I2 corresponding to linear\n\nfractional transformations of C ∪ {∞}.\n\nBesides the mostly continuous groups of transformations of whole\n\nspaces, we shall also investigate the discrete symmetry groups of cer-\n\ntain geometric figures, such as polytopes and honeycombs. In the latter\n\npart of the book we shall rely heavily on H. S. M. Coxeter’s theory\n\nof groups generated by reflections. Discrete “modular” groups that\n\noperate in hyperbolic _n_ -space for 2 ≤ _n_ ≤ 5 are defined by linear\nfractional transformations (or 2 × 2 matrices) over rings of real, complex,\n\nor quaternionic integers.\n\n1\n\nH O M O G E N E O U S S PAC E S\n\nEuclidean geometry is the prototype of a real _metric space_ , in which\n\nthe distance between any pair of points is a nonnegative real num-\n\nber, so that lengths and angles can be measured in a consistent way.\n\nIn a _homogeneous_ space, any point can be taken to any other point\n\nby a distance-preserving transformation, or _isometry_. Euclidean and\n\nother homogeneous spaces can be distinguished by how their sub-\n\nspaces are related. Every isometry can be expressed as the product\n\nof reflections, a fact that enables us to classify the different isometries\n\nof _n_ -dimensional space. Complex conjugation allows a real-valued dis-\n\ntance function to be defined on spaces coordinatized over the complex\n\nfield, and each real metric space has a _unitary_ counterpart.\n\n1.1\n\nREAL METRIC SPACES\n\nThe classical real metric spaces are what Riemann (1854) called\n\n“spaces of constant curvature.” For each _n_ ≥ 0 we have _spherical_ ,\n\n_Euclidean_ , _hyperbolic_ , and _elliptic n_ -space, denoted respectively by\nS _n_ , E _n_ , H _n_ , and eP _n_. For _n_ ≥ 1 such geometries are _n_\n-manifolds (locally Euclidean topological spaces); for _n_ ≥ 2 the spaces S\n_n_ , E _n_ , and H _n_ are simply connected—any two points can be linked by a\npath, and every\n\nsimple closed curve can be shrunk to a point. Having constant curva-\n\nture means that each of these spaces is _homogeneous_(any two points\n\nare related by a distance-preserving transformation) and _isotropic_(all\n\n13\n\n14\n\nHomogeneous Spaces\n\ndirections are alike). In later chapters we shall see how the different\n\ngeometries can be derived from projective, affine, or inversive spaces.\n\nHere we note a few of their distinctive properties.\n\nEach _n_ -dimensional real metric space contains various lower-\n\ndimensional subspaces. A _k_ -dimensional subspace of Euclidean,\n\nhyperbolic, or elliptic _n_ -space ( _k < n_) is a _k-plane_ E _k_ , H _k_ ,\nor eP _k_ —a _point_ if _k_ = 0, a _line_ if _k_ = 1, a _plane_ if _k_ = 2, a\n_hyperplane_ if _k_ = _n_ −1.\n\nSpherical _k_ -space can be embedded in any metric _n_ -space ( _k < n_) as a\n_k-sphere_ S _k_ —a _pair_ of points if _k_ = 0, a _circle_ if _k_ = 1, a\n_sphere_ if _k_ = 2, a _hypersphere_ if _k_ = _n_ − 1. The points of S _n_\noccur in antipodal pairs; a _k_ -sphere in S _n_ that contains such a pair is\na _great k_ -sphere, a _k_ -dimensional subspace of spherical _n_ -space. The\nempty set ∅ may be\n\nregarded as a universal subspace of dimension −1.\n\nSubspaces of the different geometries are related in different\n\nways. Any two points of E _n_ , H _n_ , or eP _n_ are joined by a unique line,\nand any two nonantipodal points of S _n_ lie on a unique great circle.\n\nAny two great circles on a sphere S2 intersect in a pair of antipo-\n\ndal points (see Figure 1.1a), while two lines in the elliptic plane eP2\n\nintersect in a single point; in each case, the great circles or lines\n\nhave a unique common perpendicular. Two lines in the Euclidean\n\nplane E2 either intersect or are _parallel_ , and parallel lines in E2 are\n\neverywhere equidistant (Figure 1.1b). In the hyperbolic plane H2,\n\ntwo nonintersecting lines are either _parallel_ or\n_diverging_(“ultraparallel”). Parallel lines in H2 are asymptotic, converging\nin one direction\n\n(Figure 1.1c), while two diverging lines have a unique common per-\n\npendicular, away from which the distance between them increases\n\nwithout bound (Figure 1.1d).\n\nAs its center recedes along a given line, the limit of a circle through\n\na fixed point in E2 is a straight line, but in H2 the limit is a _horocycle_ —\n\na “circle” with its center at infinity. Similarly, the locus of points at\n\na constant distance from a given line in E2 is a pair of parallel lines,\n\nbut in H2 it is a two-branched “equidistant curve” or _pseudocycle_. In\n\neP2 the locus is a circle (or a single point). In S2 the locus of points\n\n1.1 Real Metric Spaces\n\n15\n\nFigure 1.1a Great circles in S2\n\nFigure 1.1b Parallel lines in E2\n\nFigure 1.1c Parallel lines in H2\n\nFigure 1.1d Diverging lines in H2\n\nat a constant distance from a great circle is an antipodal pair of small\n\ncircles (or points).\n\nEven before the seminal work of Lobachevsky (1829–30) and\n\nBolyai (1832), Gauss’s student F. L. Wachter (1792–1817) observed\n\nthat, independently of the parallel postulate, the geometry of a sphere\n\nwhose radius increases without bound becomes Euclidean in the limit\n\n16\n\nHomogeneous Spaces\n\n(Stäckel 1901; cf. Bonola 1906, § 30; Sommerville 1914, p. 15; Cox-\n\neter 1942, pp. 7, 220). In Euclidean _n_ -space the limit of a _k_ -sphere\n\nS _k_( _k < n_) is a _k_ -plane E _k_ , while in hyperbolic _n_ -space it is a\n_k-horosphere_ , isometric to Euclidean _k_ -space.\n\nHyperbolic _k_ -space can be embedded in hyperbolic _n_ -space ( _k < _\n\n_n_) not only as a _k_ -plane H _k_ but also as one of the two sheets of an\n\n“equidistant _k_ -surface” or _k-pseudosphere_. A portion of the hyper-\n\nbolic plane (a horocyclic sector) can be embedded in Euclidean 3-\n\nspace as a “pseudospherical surface” (Beltrami 1868a; cf. Bonola 1906,\n\n§ 67; Sommerville 1914, pp. 168–170; Coxeter 1942, pp. 256–258; Still-\n\nwell 1996, pp. 1–5), but Hilbert (1901) showed that there is no way to\n\nembed all of H2 in E3. Still, H _k_ can be isometrically immersed in E _n_ —\n\npossibly with self-intersections—if _n_ is sufficiently large, as when _n_ ≥\n\n6 _k_ − 5 (Blanuša 1955; cf. Alekseevsky, Lychagin & Vinogradov 1988,\n\nchap. 8, §§ 6–7).\n\nOrdinary Euclidean _n_ -space E _n_( _n_ ≥ 1) may be extended by\n\nadjoining to the ordinary points of each line one _absolute point_(or\n\n“point at infinity”), the resulting _extended Euclidean_ space being\n\ndenoted ¯\n\nE _n_. All the absolute points of ¯\n\nE _n_ lie in an _absolute hyper-_\n\n_plane_ , and each ordinary _k_ -plane, together with all the _k_ -planes\nparallel to it, meets the absolute hyperplane in an _absolute_( _k_ − 1)\n_-plane_.\n\nThe geometry of the absolute hyperplane of ¯\n\nE _n_ is elliptic.\n\nLikewise, ordinary hyperbolic _n_ -space H _n_( _n_ ≥ 1) may be\n\nextended by adjoining to the ordinary points of each line an _absolute_\n\n_pair_ of points—i.e., two “points at infinity,” one in each direction—the\n\nresulting _extended hyperbolic_ space being denoted ¯\n\nH _n_. All the abso-\n\nlute points of ¯\n\nH _n_ lie on an _absolute hypersphere_ , and each ordinary\n\n_k_ -plane meets the absolute hypersphere in a unique _absolute_( _k_ − 1) _-_\n\n_sphere_. Each ordinary plane is thus bounded by an _absolute circle_. As\nnoted by Liebmann (1905, pp. 54–58), the geometry of the absolute\n\nhypersphere of ¯\n\nH _n_ is inversive.\n\nExtended hyperbolic _n_ -space can be completed by embedding it in\n\n_projective n_ -space P _n_ , thereby adjoining to the ordinary and absolute\n\n1.1 Real Metric Spaces\n\n17\n\nFigure 1.1e Ordinary, absolute, and ideal lines\n\npoints a set ˇ\n\nH _n_ of _ideal_(or “ultra-infinite”) points, exterior to the\n\nabsolute hypersphere (Bonola 1906, app. iv; Sommerville 1914, pp. 47–\n\n50). In _complete hyperbolic n_ -space hP _n_ , any _k_ \\+ 1 points of general\nposition (1 ≤ _k_ ≤ _n_ − 1) lie in a unique _k_ -plane, which is _ordinary_ ,\n_absolute_ , or _ideal_ according as it meets the absolute hypersphere in an\nabsolute ( _k_ − 1)-sphere, a single absolute point, or not at all.∗ The\n\ntwo-dimensional case is illustrated in Figure 1.1e. The absolute hyper-\n\nsphere is the locus of self-conjugate points in an _absolute polarity_ that\n\npairs each ordinary, absolute, or ideal point with an ideal, absolute, or\n\nordinary hyperplane.\n\nIndeed, as shown by Cayley (1859) and Klein (1871, 1873), each of\n\nthe non-Euclidean _n_ -spaces eP _n_ and H _n_(as contained in hP _n_) results\nfrom fixing a polarity in projective _n_ -space (an _involution_ if _n_ = 1),\n\n∗ The geometry of an ordinary, absolute, or ideal _k_ -plane is respectively\nhyperbolic, co-Euclidean, or elliptic. The points and subspaces of an ordinary\n_k_ -plane hP _k_ may themselves be ordinary, absolute, or ideal. An absolute\n_k_ -plane Ě _k_(dual to Euclidean _k_ -space) has a bundle of absolute\nsubspaces passing through its\n\none absolute point; all other points and subspaces are ideal. All the points\nand\n\nsubspaces of an ideal _k_ -plane eP _k_ are ideal.\n\n18\n\nHomogeneous Spaces\n\nand Euclidean _n_ -space E _n_ can be obtained from _affine n_ -space A _n_ by\nfixing a polarity in the (projective) hyperplane at infinity. For both eP _n_\n\nand E _n_ , the polarity is _elliptic_ ; i.e., there are no self-conjugate\npoints.\n\nFor hP _n_ , the polarity is _hyperbolic_ : the locus of self-conjugate\npoints—\n\nthe absolute points of ¯\n\nH _n_ —is an _oval_( _n_ − 1) _-quadric_ in P _n_(a _conic_ in P2, a pair of\npoints in P1). Fixing a hyperbolic polarity in the hyperplane at infinity of A\n_n_ produces _Lorentzian n_ -space (sometimes called\n\n“Minkowski space”), which is homogeneous but not isotropic.\n\nIn projective ( _n_ \\+ 1)-space P _n_ +1, an oval _n_ -quadric __ is a\nconformal (angle-preserving) model for _inversive n_ -space I _n_ , alias the\n\n_Möbius n_ \\- _sphere_. When we specialize an _inversion_ on I _n_ , induced\nby a collineation of P _n_ +1 that takes __ into itself but interchanges\n“antipodal” points, we obtain a _central n_ -sphere, with a metric. If the\n_central_\n\n_inversion_ so defined has no fixed points, this is the _elliptic n_ -sphere S\n_n_. Otherwise, we have the _hyperbolic n_ -sphere ¨S _n_ , with an\n“equatorial” ( _n_ − 1)-sphere of fixed (“self-antipodal”) points. When\nantipodal\n\npoints are identified, S _n_ is converted to elliptic _n_ -space eP _n_ , and\n¨S _n_ to extended hyperbolic _n_ -space ¯\n\nH _n_(Johnson 1981, pp. 452–454).\n\n1.2\n\nISOMETRIES\n\nAccording to the _Erlanger Programm_ of Klein, a geometry is char-\n\nacterized by the group of transformations that preserve its essen-\n\ntial properties. Each of the metric spaces to be considered here\n\nhas a group of _isometries_(or “rigid motions”), transformations that\n\npreserve distances. A Euclidean space also has a larger group of\n\n_similarities_ , preserving ratios of distances.\n\n**A.** _Isometry groups._ An isometry of Euclidean _n_ -space E _n_ taking points _X_ and _Y_ respectively to points _X_ and _Y_ keeps the distance between them the same: | _X_ _Y_ | = | _XY_ |. A similarity of scale _μ > _ 0\n\nhas | _X_ _Y_ | = _μ_ | _XY_ | for every pair of points. The isometry group of E _n_ is the _Euclidean_ group E _n_ , a normal subgroup of the Euclidean\n\n1.2 Isometries\n\n19\n\nsimilarity, or _euclopetic_ , group ˜\n\nE _n_(i.e., if _R_ ∈ E _n_ and _S_ ∈ ˜E _n_ , then\n\n_SRS_ −1 ∈ E _n_).∗\n\nA _translation_ in E _n_ is a direction-preserving isometry, with each\n\npoint moving the same distance, so that | _XX_ | is the same for all points\n\n_X_. The _translation_ group T _n_ is a normal subgroup of E _n_. Moreover, as\nthe additive group of the vector space R _n_ , T _n_ is abelian; i.e., the\ntranslations form a commutative subsystem of isometries. Likewise, a\n\n_dilatation_ is a similarity that preserves or reverses directions, so that\n\n_X_ _Y_ is parallel to _XY_ , and the dilatations (including translations)\nconstitute a normal subgroup of ˜\n\nE _n_. Detailed treatments of Euclidean\n\nisometries and similarities, especially in E2, are readily available (e.g.,\n\nsee Yaglom 1955, Martin 1982, or Barker & Howe 2007).\n\nThe isometry group of the elliptic ( _n_ −1)-sphere S _n_ −1 is the\n_orthogonal_ group O ∼\n\n_n_ = E _n/_ T _n_ , induced by the isometries of E _n_ that leave a given\npoint fixed. The center of O _n_ —the subgroup of isometries\n\nof S _n_ −1 that commute with every isometry—is the _unit scalar_(or\n\n“central”) group ¯SZ, the group of order 2 generated by the central\n\ninversion, sometimes denoted simply by ‘2’. Elliptic ( _n_ − 1)-space\n\neP _n_ −1 = S _n_ −1 _/_ 2 results from the identification of antipodal points\nof S _n_ −1, and its isometry group is the _projective orthogonal_ group\n\nPO ∼\n\n_n_ = O _n/_ ¯\n\nS _Z_. The isometry group of H _n_ −1 is the _projective pseudo-_\n\n_orthogonal_ group PO _n_ −1,1, the central quotient group of the isometry\ngroup O _n_ −1,1 of the hyperbolic ( _n_ − 1)-sphere ¨S _n_ −1 (Johnson 1981,\npp. 446–447).\n\nEuclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical spaces are orientable, with\n\ntwo distinguishable _senses_ , as are odd-dimensional elliptic spaces. An\n\nisometry of an orientable space is either _direct_(sense-preserving) or\n\n_opposite_(sense-reversing), the direct isometries forming a subgroup\n\nof index 2 in the full isometry group. In a Euclidean space, the same is\n\ntrue of similarities.\n\n∗ Appended to a suitable stem, the suffix “-petic” (from the Greek _anapeteia_\nexpan-sion) indicates the result of combining a measure-preserving\ntransformation and a\n\nscaling operation.\n\n20\n\nHomogeneous Spaces\n\nThe set of images of a given point of a metric space under the\n\noperations of a group of isometries is its _orbit_. If every point has a\n\nneighborhood that includes no other points in its orbit, the group is\n\nsaid to be _discrete_.\n\n**B.** _Products of reflections._ The transformation that leaves every\n\npoint of a geometry invariant is the _identity_ 1\\. An isometry of a real\n\nmetric space, other than the identity, that leaves invariant every point\n\nof an ordinary hyperplane or great hypersphere is a _reflection_ , and the\n\ninvariant hyperplane or hypersphere is its _mirror_. In elliptic _n_ -space,\nextended Euclidean _n_ -space, or complete hyperbolic _n_ -space, a reflection\nleaves one other point invariant—the _pole_ of the mirror. In any\n\n_n_ -space, a reflection interchanges noninvariant points in pairs and thus\n\nis _involutory_ , i.e., of period 2.\n\nEvery isometry of _n_ -space can be expressed as the product of\n\nreflections. Let us say that an isometry of _n_ -space is of _type l_ if it\ncan be expressed as the product of _l_ , but no fewer, reflections (Coxeter\n1988, p. 43). Thus the identity is of type 0 and a reflection is of\n\ntype 1. By a famous theorem of Élie Cartan (1869–1951) and Jean\n\nDieudonné (1906–1992), the type of an isometry of _n_ -space is at most\n\n_n_ \\+ 1; that is, every isometry can be expressed as the product of\n\n_n_ \\+ 1 or fewer reflections. In elliptic _n_ -space, the maximum type is\n\n_n_ or _n_ \\+ 1, whichever is even (Coxeter 1942, pp. 114, 130). In an\norientable space, an isometry of type _l_ is direct if _l_ is even, opposite\nif _l_ is odd.\n\nIn any _n_ -space, the product of two reflections whose ( _n_ − 1)-\n\ndimensional mirrors intersect in an ordinary ( _n_ − 2)-plane or a great\n\n( _n_ − 2)-sphere is a _rotation_ about the intersection, the _pivot_ of the\nrotation, through twice the angle between the mirrors. If the angle\n\nis commensurable with π, the period of the rotation is finite; in\n\nany case, points in the orbit of a point not on the pivot lie on a\n\ncircle. When the mirrors are coincident, the rotation reduces to the\n\nidentity.\n\n1.2 Isometries\n\n21\n\nIn hyperbolic _n_ -space ( _n_ ≥ 2), two ordinary hyperplanes are paral-\n\nlel when their absolute ( _n_ −2)-spheres are tangent. The product of two\n\nreflections in parallel mirrors is a _striation_ , essentially a\n“pararotation”\n\nabout the common absolute ( _n_ − 2)-plane of the two mirrors. When\n\nthe mirrors coincide, the transformation is just the identity. Except\n\nfor this, every striation is of infinite period. Points in the orbit of any\n\nordinary point lie on a horocycle.\n\nIn Euclidean or hyperbolic _n_ -space, the product of two reflections\n\nin mirrors that are both orthogonal to some ordinary line is a _trans-_\n\n_lation_ along the line, the _axis_ of the translation, through twice the\ndistance between the mirrors. When the mirrors are coincident, the\n\ntranslation reduces to the identity. Otherwise, in E _n_( _n_ ≥ 2) the mirrors\nare parallel, and any line parallel to the given line can serve as\n\nthe axis of the translation. In H _n_( _n_ ≥ 2), the mirrors are diverging,\nand the axis is unique. Except for the identity, a translation is of infinite\n(or imaginary) period. In the Euclidean case, repeated translates\n\nof any point are collinear. In the hyperbolic case, a point on the axis\n\ntranslates to other points on the axis, while points in the orbit of a\n\npoint not on the axis lie on one branch of a pseudocycle. A hyper-\n\nbolic translation can be thought of as a “hyperrotation” about the\n\nideal ( _n_ − 2)-plane absolutely polar to the axis.\n\nEvery isometry of even type 2 _k_(other than the identity) can be\n\nexpressed as the commutative product of _k_ −1 rotations and a transla-\n\ntion, of _k_ −1 rotations and a striation, or of _k_ rotations. Every isometry\nof odd type 2 _k_ \\+ 1 can be expressed as the commutative product of an\n\nisometry of type 2 _k_ and a reflection. The _rank_ of an isometry is the\nsmallest integer _m_ such that it can be effected in E _n_ or H _n_(or eP _n_\nif of odd type) for any _n_ ≥ _m_ or in S _n_(or eP _n_ if of even type) for\nany _n_ ≥ _m_ −1. Table 1.2 lists the type and rank of every nontrivial\nisometry of S _n_(or eP _n_), E _n_ , or H _n_.\n\nThe prefixes “trans-” and “stria-” and the combining term “rotary”\n\nare used in naming products of isometries.

These approaches are usefully employed by Alekseevsky, Vin-\n\nberg & Solodovnikov (1988, chap. 5), whose terminology differs\n\nin some respects from that used here. In particular, their “parallel\n\n1.2 Isometries\n\n23\n\ndisplacement along a line” is our _translation_ , and their “parabolic\n\ntranslation” (Coxeter’s “parallel displacement”) is our _striation_.\n\n**C.** _Special cases._ The product of reflections in _l_ mutually orthogonal\nhyperplanes or great hyperspheres of _n_ -space (1 ≤ _l_ ≤ _n_) is an\ninvolutory isometry, an _inversion_ in the ( _n_ − _l_)-plane or great ( _n_ −\n_l_)-\n\nsphere common to the _l_ mirrors. When _l_ = 1, this is just a reflection.\n\nFor _l_ = 2, it is a _half-turn_ ; for _l_ = 3, a _flip reflection_ ; for _l_\n= 2 _k_ ≥ 4, a _k-tuple half-turn_ ; for _l_ = 2 _k_ \\+ 1 ≥ 5, a _k-tuple flip\nreflection_. The product of reflections in _n_ \\+ 1 mutually orthogonal great\nhyperspheres of\n\nS _n_ is the central inversion. The product of reflections in _n_ \\+ 1\nmutually orthogonal hyperplanes of eP _n_ is the identity. Some writers call\nall\n\ninvolutory isometries “reflections.”\n\nThe term “inversion” is also used for certain involutory transfor-\n\nmations of inversive _n_ -space I _n_. While this duplication of terminology\nmight seem unfortunate, the two meanings of the word are not totally\n\nunrelated. In the derivation of S _n_ as the elliptic _n_ -sphere, a fixed\n“elliptic” inversion of I _n_ becomes the central inversion of S _n_ , which\nis an inversion in a point—the center of an _n_ -sphere—when S _n_ is embedded\nin some ( _n_ \\+ 1)-dimensional metric space. A fixed “hyperbolic”\n\ninversion of I _n_ defining the hyperbolic _n_ -sphere ¨S _n_ likewise becomes\nan inversion in a hyperplane, i.e., a reflection.\n\nIn odd-dimensional elliptic or spherical space eP2 _k_ −1 or S2 _k_ −1, the\n\nproduct of rotations through equal angles in _k_ mutually orthogonal\n\nplanes or great spheres is a special _k_ -tuple rotation called a _Clifford_\n\n_translation_(Clifford 1873; Bonola 1906, app. ii; Coxeter 1942, pp. 135–\n\n141). This transformation has the property, shared with Euclidean\n\ntranslations, that the distance between any point and its image is con-\n\nstant. A Clifford translation in elliptic 3-space leaves invariant one of\n\ntwo sets of “parallel” (actually skew) lines lying in a ruled quadric—a\n\n_Clifford surface_ —which has zero curvature everywhere and thus a\n\nEuclidean metric.\n\n24\n\nHomogeneous Spaces\n\nThe orbit of a point in Euclidean _n_ -space under a discrete group\n\nof translations is called a _lattice_ ; a line through two points of a lattice\n\npasses through an infinite number of lattice points, equally spaced.\n\nA lattice can also be realized in hyperbolic _n_ -space as the orbit of a\n\npoint under a discrete group of striations that leave some absolute\n\npoint ˙\n\n_O_ invariant; lattice points are equally spaced on horocycles with\n\ncenter ˙\n\n_O_.\n\nEXERCISES 1.2\n\nNote: The symbol ‘’ preceding a statement indicates that it is a theorem to\n\nbe proved.\n\n**1.** The product of reflections in two perpendicular lines of E2 or H2 or\ntwo\n\northogonal great circles of S2 is a half-turn.\n\n**2.** The product of two half-turns in E2 is a translation.\n\n**3.** The set of all translations and half-turns in E2 forms a group.\n\n**4.** Every isometry in S2 is a reflection, a rotation, or the commutative\n\nproduct of a reflection and a rotation.\n\n**5.** Every isometry in E3 is either a reflection, a rotation, or a\ntranslation or the commutative product of two of these.\n\n1.3\n\nUNITARY SPACES\n\nEach of the real metric spaces eP _n_ , E _n_ , H _n_ , and S _n_ has a\ncomplex analogue—namely, _elliptic unitary n_ -space Pu _n_ , _Euclidean\nunitary_ _n_ -space Eu _n_ , _hyperbolic unitary n_ -space Hu _n_ , and\n_spherical unitary_ _n_ -space Su _n_ —each of which can be derived from a\ncomplex projective space of dimension _n_ or _n_ \\+ 1. The basic structure of\nthese spaces is described in this section; a more detailed treatment will be\ngiven\n\nstarting in Chapter 7.\n\nSelf-conjugate points of a polarity correspond to solutions of a\n\nquadratic equation. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, the\n\n1.3 Unitary Spaces\n\n25\n\ncomplex field C is algebraically closed, so that there are no irreducible\n\nquadratic polynomials over C. Hence there are no elliptic polarities\n\nin complex projective _n_ -space CP _n_. However, unlike the real field R,\n\nwhich has no nontrivial automorphisms, C has an involutory automor-\n\nphism ∗ : C → C of complex conjugation, with _z_ = _x_ \\+ _y_ i mapped to _z_ ∗ = ¯ _z_ = _x_ − _y_ i. Thus ( _z_ \\+ _w_)∗ = _z_ ∗ + _w_ ∗ and ( _zw_)∗ = _z_ ∗ _w_ ∗ for all _z_ and _w_. The nonnegative real number _zz_ ∗ = | _z_ |2 = _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 is the _norm_ of _z_. This automorphism can be used to define an _antipolarity_ in CP _n_(an _anti-involution_ if _n_ = 1), pairing each point with a unique hyperplane, and complex antipolarities (like real polarities) may or may not have\n\nself-conjugate points.\n\nEach of the unitary metric spaces Pu _n_ , Eu _n_ , and Hu _n_ can be\n\nobtained by fixing an _absolute antipolarity_ in CP _n_ or, in the Euclidean\nunitary case, by first fixing a hyperplane CP _n_ −1 and then (if _n > _ 1)\nfixing an absolute antipolarity in CP _n_ −1 (cf. Coolidge 1924, pp. 133–\n\n154; Mostow 1980, pp. 180–183; Goldman 1999, pp. 11–25). For both\n\nPu _n_ and Eu _n_ , the absolute antipolarity is _elliptic_ ; i.e., there are\nno self-conjugate points. For Hu _n_ the absolute antipolarity is _hyperbolic_\n: the locus of self-conjugate points is an _oval_( _n_ − 1)- _antiquadric_ in\nCP _n_(an _anticonic_ in CP2, a _chain_ in CP1).\n\nThe complex projective line CP1 with one point fixed is the\n\nEuclidean unitary line Eu1. As evidenced by the well-known _Argand_\n\n_diagram_(after J. R. Argand, 1768–1822),∗ Eu1 has the same met-\n\nric as the real Euclidean plane E2. Likewise, CP1 with an absolute\n\nanti-involution is, according as the anti-involution is elliptic (no fixed\n\npoints) or hyperbolic (a chain of fixed points), either the elliptic uni-\n\ntary line Pu1 (which has the same metric as the real elliptic sphere S2)\n\nor the hyperbolic unitary line Hu1 (which has the same metric as the\n\n∗ Though he was not the first to identify C with R2, it was Argand’s 1806\npamphlet\n\nthat first gained the attention of the mathematical community, as the\ninsightful\n\n1797 paper of Caspar Wessel (1745–1818) went virtually unnoticed for nearly a\ncen-\n\ntury.

In general, a unitary _n_ -space Eu _n_ , Pu _n_\n, or Hu _n_ has a representation as a real Euclidean 2 _n_ -space E2 _n_ or as\na real elliptic or hyperbolic 2 _n_ -sphere S2 _n_ or ¨S2 _n_.\n\nIn complex projective ( _n_ \\+ 1)-space CP _n_ +1, an oval _n_ -antiquadric\nserves as a conformal model for _inversive unitary n_ -space Iu _n_ —the\n\n_Möbius n_ \\- _antisphere_. This is to be distinguished from the _complex_\n_inversive_(or “complex conformal”) _n_ -space CI _n_ described for _n_ =\n\n2 by Veblen & Young (1918, pp. 264–267) and more generally by\n\nScherk (1960). (That geometry, in which complex conjugation plays no\n\nrole, is modeled in CP _n_ +1 not by an _n_ -antiquadric but by an _n_\n-quadric, defined by a polarity rather than an antipolarity.) Fixing a family\nof\n\n“unitary inversions” converts Iu _n_ into spherical or pseudospherical\n\nunitary _n_ -space Su _n_ or ¨Su _n_ , which has a representation as a real\nelliptic or hyperbolic (2 _n_ \\+ 1)-sphere.\n\nEXERCISES 1.3\n\n**1.** Show that the equation _x_ 2\n\n2\n\n1 + _x_ 1 _x_ 2 + _x_ 2\n\n= 0 has no nontrivial solutions\n\nin real numbers _x_ 1 and _x_ 2\\.\n\n**2.** Find a nontrivial solution of the equation _z_ 2\n\n2\n\n1 + _z_ 1 _z_ 2 + _z_ 2\n\n= 0 in complex\n\nnumbers _z_ 1 and _z_ 2\\.\n\n**3.** Show that the equation _z_ 1 ¯ _z_ 1 + _z_ 2 ¯ _z_ 2 = 0 has no\nnontrivial solutions in complex numbers _z_ 1 and _z_ 2\\.\n\n2\n\nL I N E A R G E O M E T R I E S\n\nEach of the spaces described in Chapter 1 can be derived by introduc-\n\ning an appropriate metric into projective, affine, or inversive geome-\n\ntry.

Both\n\nof these are _linear_ geometries—two points lie on a unique line, and\n\ntwo lines meet in at most one point. The real projective plane is based\n\non a few elementary axioms, but for higher dimensions we make use\n\nof coordinates. In this chapter we shall see how the selection of an\n\n_absolute polarity_ converts projective or affine _n_ -space into a linear\nmetric space—elliptic, hyperbolic, or Euclidean _n_ -space. The elliptic\n\nand hyperbolic _n_ -spheres on the other hand are _circular_ metric spaces; in\nthe next chapter we shall show how each of them can be obtained\n\nfrom inversive _n_ -space.\n\n2.1\n\nPROJECTIVE PLANES\n\nFollowing the path originally marked out by Arthur Cayley (1821–\n\n1895) and more fully delineated by Felix Klein (1849–1925), our\n\nstarting point for defining and coordinatizing various real and com-\n\nplex spaces is projective geometry. The two-dimensional theory can be\n\nbased on the primitive terms _point_ and _line_ and a relationship of\n_incidence_ , together with certain properties of _harmonic_ and\n_quadrangular_ sets and the notions of _order_ and _continuity_.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nLinear Geometries\n\n**A.** _Incidence._ A _projective plane_ is a set of primitive objects, called\n_points_ and _lines_ , with an undefined relation of _incidence_. If a point\n_P_\n\nis incident with a line ˇ\n\n_Q_ , we write _P_ ♦ ˇ\n\n_Q_ or ˇ\n\n_Q_ ♦ _P_ and say that _P_ “lies\n\non” ˇ\n\n_Q_ or that ˇ\n\n_Q_ “passes through” _P_. If two points are incident with\n\na given line, the line is said to _join_ the points, while two lines inci-\n\ndent with a given point are said to _meet_(or “intersect”) in the point.\n\nThree or more points lying on one line are _collinear_ , and three or\n\nmore lines passing through one point are _concurrent_. In any projective\n\nplane, we make the following assumptions of incidence (cf.

An affirmative answer requires still another\n\nassumption:\n\n2.1 Projective Planes\n\n31\n\nAxiom M. _Each point of a harmonic set is uniquely determined by the_\n\n_remaining points._\n\nTwo triangles are said to be _perspective from a point_ if the lines\n\njoining pairs of corresponding vertices are concurrent, and _perspec-_\n\n_tive from a line_ if the points in which corresponding sides meet are\n\ncollinear. Given Axioms I, J, K, L, and M, one can prove the following\n\nresult, a special case of the celebrated two-triangle theorem of Girard\n\nDesargues (1593–1662):\n\nTheorem 2.1.1 (Minor Theorem of Desargues). _If two triangles are_\n\n_perspective from a point, and if two of the three points in which cor-_\n\n_responding sides meet lie on a line through this point, then so does the_\n\n_third._\n\nA projective plane in which the Minor Theorem holds is called\n\na _Moufang plane_ , after Ruth Moufang (1905–1977), who first inves-\n\ntigated such planes. For more details, see Bruck 1955 (pp. 12–16),\n\nHall 1959 (pp. 366–372), or Artzy 1965 (pp. 220–226).\n\nGiven a complete quadrangle _PQRS_ , let ˇ\n\n_O_ be a line not passing\n\nthrough any vertex (see Figure 2.1b). Let the concurrent sides _PS_ , _QS_ ,\n_RS_ meet ˇ\n\n_O_ in the respective points _A_ , _B_ , _C_ , and let the nonconcurrent sides\n_QR_ , _RP_ , _PQ_ meet ˇ\n\n_O_ in the respective points _D_ , _E_ , _F_. Then\n\nwe call the ordered hexad ( _ABC_ , _DEF_) a _quadrangular set_ and write\n_ABC_\n\n∧ _DEF_. The points of the set need not all be distinct. If _A_ = _D_\n\nand _B_ = _E_ , so that ˇ\n\n_O_ passes through two of the three diagonal points,\n\nthen the tetrad ( _AB_ , _CF_) is a harmonic set. A stronger assumption\n\nthan Axiom M is\n\nAxiom N. _Each point of a quadrangular set is uniquely determined by_\n\n_the remaining points._\n\nSince a harmonic set is a special case of a quadrangular set, Axiom\n\nN implies Axiom M.

The vertices and sides of\n\nthe two triangles, the lines joining pairs of corresponding vertices, the\n\npoints in which corresponding sides meet, and the center and axis of\n\nperspectivity form a _Desargues configuration_ 103 of ten points and ten\n\nlines, with three lines through each point and three points on each\n\nline (see Figure 2.1c). When the center lies on the axis, as in the Minor\n\nTheorem, the ten points and ten lines form a _Moufang superfiguration_\n\n(cf. Grünbaum 2009, pp. 86–87). The finite plane F2P2, too small to\n\ncontain a pair of perspective triangles or a Desargues configuration, is\n\ntrivially Desarguesian.\n\nIf the nonrestricted Desargues’s Theorem or its equivalent is taken\n\nas an axiom, then Axiom N can be proved as a theorem (cf. Veblen &\n\nYoung 1910, pp. 16–18, 47–50).

Hence if one of the ordered tetrads\n\n( _AB_ , _CD_), ( _AB_ , _DC_), ( _BA_ , _CD_), ( _BA_ , _DC_) is a harmonic\nset, then so are the others. Given Axioms I, J, K, L, and\n\nN, one can also show that the harmonic relation is symmetric (Veblen\n\n& Young 1910, p. 81):\n\nTheorem O. _If (AB, CD) is a harmonic set, then so is (CD, AB)._\n\nThe two triples of a quadrangular set can be subjected to the\n\nsame permutation; thus _ABC_\n\n∧ _DEF_ implies _ACB_ ∧ _DFE_ and\n\n_BCA_\n\n∧ _EFD_.

We may omit Axiom L and replace Axiom N\n\nby a stronger assumption:\n\n34\n\nLinear Geometries\n\nAxiom P. _If (ABC, DEF) is a quadrangular set, then so is (DEF,_\n\n_ABC)._\n\nThis makes corresponding points of the two triples pairs of an\n\ninvolution ( _AD_)( _BE_)( _CF_), so that Axiom P implies Axiom N. Given\nAxioms I, J, K, and P, one can derive the theorem first proved by\n\nPappus of Alexandria in the fourth century:\n\nTheorem 2.1.3 (Pappus). _If the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately_\n\n_on two lines, then the three points in which pairs of opposite sides meet_\n\n_lie on a third line._\n\nThe vertices and sides of the hexagon, together with the three\n\npoints and the three lines, form a _Pappus configuration_ 93 of nine\n\npoints and nine lines, with three lines through each point and three\n\npoints on each line (see Figure 2.1d).\n\nIf Pappus’s Theorem or its equivalent is taken as an axiom, then\n\nAxiom P can be proved as a theorem (cf. Veblen & Young 1910, pp. 95,\n\n100–101). Gerhard Hessenberg showed in 1905 that in any projective\n\nplane, Pappus’s Theorem implies Desargues’s Theorem, although the\n\nconverse does not hold (cf. Coxeter 1949/1993, § 4.3; Artzy 1965, pp.\n\n235–237). Thus every Pappian plane is Desarguesian, but there exist\n\nDesarguesian planes that are not Pappian.\n\n_C_\n\n_B_\n\n_A_\n\n_L_\n\n_N_\n\n_M_\n\n_D_\n\n_E_\n\n_F_\n\nFigure 2.1d The Pappus configuration\n\n2.1 Projective Planes\n\n35\n\n**C.** _Order and continuity._ In a plane satisfying Axioms I, J, K, and M, a\npoint _P_ on a line ˇ\n\n_O_ is said to be _harmonically related_ to three distinct\n\npoints _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ on ˇ\n\n_O_ if it is one of a sequence of points _A_ , _B_ , _C_ ,\n\n_D_ , _. . ._ , each of which, after the first three, is the harmonic\nconjugate of one of the preceding points with respect to two others. All\npoints\n\nharmonically related to _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ form the _net of rationality_(or\n\n“harmonic net”) Q( _ABC_), described in the real case by A. F. Möbius\n\nin 1827. If _L_ , _M_ , and _N_ are three distinct points of Q( _ABC_), then\nQ( _LMN_) = Q( _ABC_) (Veblen & Young 1910, pp. 84–85).\n\nThe number of points in a net of rationality may be either finite or\n\ninfinite but is the same for any net on any line. If finite, it must be of\n\nthe form _p_ \\+ 1, where _p_ is a prime. There may be more than one net of\nrationality on a line, possibly infinitely many. In a Desarguesian plane\n\nwith _p_ \\+ 1 points in a net of rationality, the number of points on a line\n\nmay be either finite, of the form _pm_ \\+ 1, or infinite.\n\nTo ensure that there are not only infinitely many points on every\n\nline but infinitely many in any net of rationality, we make the following\n\nassumption:\n\nAxiom Q. _No net of rationality is finite._\n\nThis axiom (also due to Fano) is considerably stronger than Axiom\n\nL, which requires only that a net of rationality have more than three\n\npoints.\n\nIn a projective plane satisfying Axioms I, J, K, M, and Q, a _circuit_\n\nis an infinite set of collinear points, including the entire net of rational-\n\nity of any three points in the set, with a relation of _separation_ , written\n\n_AB//CD_(“ _A_ and _B_ separate _C_ and _D_ ”), having the following\nproperties (cf. Veblen & Young 1918, pp. 44–45; Coxeter 1949/1993, § 3.1;\n\nArtzy 1965, pp. 239–240):\n\n(1) If _AB//CD_ , then the points _A_ , _B_ , _C_ , and _D_ are distinct.\n\n(2) The relation _AB//CD_ implies _AB//DC_ and _CD//AB_.\n\n(3) If _A_ , _B_ , _C_ , and _D_ are four distinct points, one and only one of\nthe relations _AB//CD_ , _BC//AD_ , and _CA//BD_ holds.\n\n36\n\nLinear Geometries\n\n(4) If _AB//CD_ and _BC//DE_ , then _CD//EA_.\n\n(5) If _AB /_ − _/ CD_ , then _AB//CD_.\n\nIf _AB//CD_ , still other permutations are valid, so long as we have ‘ _A_ ’\n\nand ‘ _B_ ’ together on one side and ‘ _C_ ’ and ‘ _D_ ’ together on the\nother.\n\nNote that the above properties are not axioms applying to all sets of\n\ncollinear points but are part of the definition of a circuit, which may\n\nor may not include all the points of a line.\n\nIf _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ are distinct points of a circuit, the _segment AB/C_\n\n(“ _AB_ without _C_ ”) is the set of all points _X_ such that _AB//CX_. If\n_AB//CD_ , the two points _A_ and _B_ decompose the circuit into just two\nsegments, _AB/C_ and _AB/D_ , with _AB/C_ containing _D_ and _AB/D_\n\ncontaining _C_.\n\n\nSeparation, as a way of characterizing _order_ in a projective plane,\n\nwas first defined by Giovanni Vailati in 1895. The following axiom\n\nof _continuity_ is essentially the “cut” devised by Richard Dedekind in\n\n1872 (see Figure 2.1e):\n\nAxiom R. _Any three collinear points A, B, C belong to a unique circuit_\n\nR( _ABC_) _with the following property: If the points of the net of ratio-_\n\n_nality_ Q( _ABC_) _belonging to the segment AB/C are divided into two_\n_nonempty sets such that AY//BX for any point X of the first set and_\n\n_any point Y of the second, then there exists a point M in the segment_\n\n_(not necessarily in the net of rationality) such that AM//BX for every_\n\n_point X_ = _M in the first set and AY//BM for every point Y_ = _M in the_\n_second set._\n\n_X_\n\n_Y_\n\n_A_\n\n_M_\n\n_B_\n\n_C_\n\nFigure 2.1e The chain R( _ABC_)\n\nThe circuit R( _ABC_) is called a _chain_. Axioms Q and R imply that\n\na chain is a compact continuum of points, having the topology of a\n\n2.1 Projective Planes\n\n37\n\nreal circle S1. To obtain the real projective plane P2, we may combine\n\nAxioms I, J, K, P, Q, and R with the following axiom of completion (cf.\n\nCoxeter 1949/1993, app. 1):\n\nAxiom S. _There is not more than one chain on a line._\n\nAll ten of the foregoing axioms hold in P2, since Q implies L and\n\nP implies both M and N. While other combinations of the axioms\n\ngenerally have a variety of models, the set {I, J, K, P, Q, R, S} is\n\ncategorical.\n\n**D.** _Coordinates._ The points and lines of a projective plane can gen-\n\nerally be coordinatized by some algebraic system, with operations\n\nsuch as addition and multiplication. One such system is a _division_\n\n_ring_ ; the elements of a division ring K form an additive abelian\n\ngroup T(K), the nonzero elements form a multiplicative group GL(K),\n\nand multiplication is distributive over addition. If multiplication is\n\ncommutative, K is a _field_ ; if not, K is a _skew-field_.∗\n\nIn 1899 David Hilbert famously showed how certain geometric\n\nproperties of a projective plane correspond to algebraic properties\n\nof its coordinate ring. In particular, Hilbert found that Pappus’s The-\n\norem is equivalent to the commutative law of multiplication _ab_ =\n\n_ba_ , while Desargues’s Theorem is equivalent to the associative law\n\n( _ab_) _c_ = _a_( _bc_).\n\nIn 1907 Oswald Veblen and J. H. M. Wedderburn described a class\n\nof non-Desarguesian projective planes that can be coordinatized over\n\nwhat have come to be known as _Veblen-Wedderburn systems_. In 1933\n\nRuth Moufang showed that at least the Minor Theorem of Desargues\n\nholds so long as multiplication obeys the alternative laws ( _aa_) _b_ =\n\n_a_( _ab_) and ( _ab_) _b_ = _a_( _bb_). A Veblen-Wedderburn system having the\nproperties of a division ring except that multiplication is alternative\n\n∗ As used here, the terms _field_ and _skew-field_ are mutually exclusive. The\ngroup GL(K) is often denoted by K∗ or K×.\n\n38\n\nLinear Geometries\n\nbut not necessarily associative is an _alternative division ring_. In 1943\n\nMarshall Hall unified these theories by means of more primitive sys-\n\ntems called _ternary rings_ , in which addition and multiplication are\n\nbound together in a single operation combining three elements at a\n\ntime. Various properties of projective and affine planes depend on the\n\nstructure of their coordinatizing ternary rings (Hall 1959, pp. 356–366;\n\nArtzy 1965, pp. 203–219).\n\nWedderburn proved in 1905 that every finite associative division\n\nring is commutative and hence a finite field F _q_ , where _q_ is a prime or a\nprime power. Emil Artin and Max Zorn later showed that the same is\n\ntrue of a finite alternative division ring. Thus every finite Desarguesian\n\n(or Moufang) plane is Pappian. Finite projective planes of order _q_ , i.e.,\n\nwith _q_ \\+ 1 points on a line, exist for every prime power _q_ = _pm_ ; one\nalways has at least the Desarguesian plane F _q_ P2. Whether _q_ can have\nother values is not known, though certain values (e.g., 6 and 10) can\n\ndefinitely be excluded.\n\nThe _characteristic_ of a ring R with unity 1 is the smallest positive\n\ninteger _p_(necessarily a prime if R is a division ring) for which the sum\n\nof _p_ 1’s equals the zero element; if no such integer exists, the charac-\n\nteristic is 0. For a projective plane satisfying Axiom M, the number of\n\npoints in a finite net of rationality is one more than the characteristic\n\nof the coordinatizing ring. Axiom L excludes projective planes coor-\n\ndinatized by rings of characteristic 2, and Axiom Q allows only rings\n\nof characteristic 0.\n\nThe fields Q, R, and C of rational, real, and complex numbers all\n\ncoordinatize Pappian projective planes. Hamilton’s skew-field H of\n\nquaternions, associative but not commutative, coordinatizes a Desar-\n\nguesian plane HP2 that is not Pappian. The Cayley-Graves algebra O\n\nof octonions, alternative but not associative, coordinatizes a Moufang\n\nplane OP2 that is not Desarguesian.\n\nThe axiomatic and algebraic theory of projective planes can\n\nbe extended to spaces of three or more dimensions, but with one\n\nmajor qualification. In any projective 3-space it is possible to prove\n\nDesargues’s Theorem from the three-dimensional axioms of incidence\n\n2.2 Projective _n_ -Space\n\n39\n\nalone (Veblen & Young 1910, p. 41; Robinson 1940, pp. 14–16;\n\nArtzy 1965, pp. 232–233). This means that for _n > _ 2 every projective _n_ -\n\nspace is coordinatizable by a division ring. Thus no non-Desarguesian\n\nplane can be embedded in any higher-dimensional projective space.\n\nEXERCISES 2.1\n\n**1.** Assuming Axioms I, J, and K, prove Theorems ˇI, ˇJ, and ˇ\n\nK.\n\n**2.** Prove that in any projective plane there are at least three points on\nevery line and at least three lines through every point.\n\n**3.** The four vertices of a complete quadrangle and any two of its diagonal\n\npoints are the vertices of a complete quadrilateral.\n\n**4.** Construct an incidence table for the Fano configuration 73, showing\nwhich\n\nof the seven points lie on each of the seven lines.\n\n**5.** Assuming Axioms I, J, K, and L, prove Theorem Ľ.\n\n**6.** Choose three points _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ on a line in P2, and find the\npoint _D_ such that _AB /_ − _/ CD_.

As\n\nan example, recall that Theorem 2.1.2 (Desargues) holds only in pro-\n\njective planes satisfying Axiom N and Theorem 2.1.3 (Pappus) only\n\nin planes satisfying Axiom P. But Hessenberg showed that every Pap-\n\npian plane is Desarguesian. A synthetic proof of this fact is not difficult\n\nbut requires the consideration of various special cases (cf. Artzy 1965,\n\npp. 235–236). However, in view of Hilbert’s discovery of the connec-\n\ntion between Pappus’s Theorem and the commutativity of multiplica-\n\ntion, any Pappian plane can be coordinatized over a field. This enables\n\nus to prove Desargues’s Theorem in a projective plane FP2 as follows:\n\nGiven two triangles _PQR_ and _P_ _Q_ _R_ perspective from a point _S_ , we\nmay without loss of generality suppose that coordinates have been\n\nassigned so that (assuming Axiom L) their respective vertices are the\n\npoints\n\n_P_ = (0, 1, 1),\n\n_Q_ = (1, 0, 1),\n\n_R_ = (1, 1, 0),\n\n_P_ = ( _x_ , 1, 1),\n\n_Q_ = (1, _y_ , 1), _R_ = (1, 1, _z_),\n\nwhere _x_ , _y_ , and _z_ are arbitrary elements, other than 0 or 1, of the\ncoordinatizing field F.

In such a plane, points _P_ , _Q_ , and _R_ as given\nabove would all lie on the line [1, 1, 1].

If _A_ is an _m_ × _n_ matrix over a\nfield or other commutative ring, with ( _i_ , _j_) ⇒ _aij_ , the _transpose_\nof _A_ is the _n_ × _m_ matrix _A_ ˇ with ( _i_ , _j_) → _aji_.† An _n_ × _n_\nmatrix _A_ is _symmetric_ if _A_ ˇ = _A_ , _skew-symmetric_ if _A_ ˇ = − _A_.\nWith ( _A_ \\+ _B_)ˇ = _A_ ˇ + _B_ ˇ\n\nand ( _AB_)ˇ = _B_ ˇ _A_ ˇ, transposition is a “co-automorphism” of the ring\nof _n_ × _n_ matrices.\n\nAny invertible symmetric matrix _A_ of order _n_ +1 defines a polarity\n\n· _A_ ˇ on FP _n_(an involution if _n_ = 1). The _polar_ of a point _X_ with\ncoordinates **(** _x_**)** is the hyperplane ˇ\n\n_X_ with coordinates **[** _x_**]** = _A_**(** _x_**)** ˇ, and the _pole_ of a\nhyperplane ˇ\n\n_U_ with coordinates **[** _u_**]** is the point _U_ with coordinates **(**\n_u_**)** = **[** _u_**]** ˇ _A_ −1. Thus **(** _x_**)** = **(** _x_**)** and\n**[** _u_**]** = **[** _u_**]**. Two points _X_\n\nand _Y_ or two hyperplanes ˇ\n\n_U_ and ˇ\n\n_V_ are _conjugate_ in the polarity, i.e.,\n\neach is incident with the polar or pole of the other, if and only if\n\n**(** _x_**)** _A_**(** _y_**)** ˇ = 0 or **[** _u_**]** ˇ _A_ −1**[**\n_v_**]** = 0.\n\nIn other words, conjugacy in the polarity is defined by means of a\n\nsymmetric _bilinear form_ · _A_ · : F _n_ +1 × F _n_ +1 → F, with [**(**\n_x_**)** , **(** _y_**)**] →\n\n∗ By what is often called the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry, on\n\na projective line over a field, two triples ( _ABC_) and ( _A_ _B_ _C_) of\ndistinct points define a unique projectivity _ABC_ ⇒ _A_ _B_ _C_. The\nprojectivity is an involution ( _AA_)( _BB_)( _CC_) if and only if ( _ABC_ ,\n_A_ _B_ _C_) is a quadrangular set (Veblen & Young 1910, p. 103; Coxeter\n1949/1993, § 4.7). Thus, given Axiom P, the statement\n\n_ABC_\n\n∧ _A_ _B_ _C_ may be interpreted to mean that the projectivity determined by\nthe two triples is an involution.\n\n† Curiously, there is no standard notation for the transpose of a matrix.\nSince matrix transposition is a dualizing operation, I employ the inverted\ncircumflex or _caron_ —\n\nthe mark commonly used for duals—as an appropriate symbol for the transpose.\n\n2.2 Projective _n_ -Space\n\n45\n\n_xiaijyj_. Values of such bilinear forms (or the forms themselves)\n\nmay be denoted by expressions like **(** _x y_**)**(cf. Sommerville 1914, p.\n130; Coxeter 1942, p. 224; Coxeter 1949/1993, § 12.6). Bilinearity of a form\n\n**(** _x y_**)** means that it is “linear” as a function F _n_ +1 → F of\neither **(** _x_**)** or **(** _y_**)** individually, i.e., that\n\n**(** _w_ \\+ _x y_**)** = **(** _w y_**)** \\+ **(** _x y_**)** and **(** _x y_\n\\+ _z_**)** = **(** _x y_**)** \\+ **(** _x z_**)** , **(** λ _x y_**)** =\nλ**(** _x y_**)**\n\nand\n\n**(** _x μy_**)** = **(** _x y_**)** _μ_ ,\n\n(2.2.6)\n\nfor all vectors **(** _w_**)** or **(** _z_**)** and for all scalars λ or _μ_.\nThe form is _symmetric_ if **(** _x y_**)** = **(** _y x_**)** for all **(**\n_x_**)** and **(** _y_**)** , _skew-symmetric_ if **(** _x y_**)** = −**(** _y\nx_**)**. The _dual_ of a bilinear form **(** _x y_**)** = **(** _x_**)**\n_A_**(** _y_**)** ˇ is the form **[** _u v_**]** = **[** _u_**]** ˇ _A_\n−1**[** _v_**]**.\n\nThe locus **(** _x x_**)** = 0 of self-conjugate points or the envelope\n\n**[** _u u_**]** = 0 of self-conjugate hyperplanes (if any) of a given\npolarity is an ( _n_ − 1)- _quadric_ , a _conic_ if _n_ = 2 (von Staudt 1847,\np. 137).\n\nThere is only one kind of projective conic, as opposed to the familiar\n\nEuclidean (or affine) trichotomy of ellipses, parabolas, and hyper-\n\nbolas. Higher-dimensional quadrics may be of different types (e.g.,\n\n“oval” or “ruled”).\n\nWhen the field F is not of characteristic 2, a quadric is a self-dual\n\nfigure: the polars of the points of a quadric locus are the hyperplanes\n\nof a quadric envelope, and vice versa. When char F = 2, the polars of\n\na quadric locus do not form a quadric envelope but all pass through a\n\npoint, and the poles of a quadric envelope do not form a quadric locus\n\nbut all lie in a hyperplane.\n\nOther geometries can be obtained from projective geometry\n\nthrough various specializations. Affine _n_ -space FA _n_ is projective\n\n_n_ -space with one hyperplane and all the subspaces incident with\n\nit removed; two subspaces of FP _n_ whose intersection lies on this\n\n“hyperplane at infinity” become _parallel_ subspaces of FA _n_. Following\nCayley (1859, 1872) and Klein (1871, 1873), we may derive elliptic,\n\nEuclidean, or hyperbolic geometry by fixing a certain _absolute polar-_\n\n_ity_ in real projective _n_ -space P _n_ = RP _n_. Many projective\nproperties,\n\n46\n\nLinear Geometries\n\nusually including some form of duality, carry over to these other\n\nspaces.\n\nEXERCISES 2.2\n\n**1.** Given the points _I_ = (1, 0, 0) and _E_ = (1, 1, 1), find the\ncoordinates of the line ˇ\n\n_L_ = _IE_.\n\n**2.** Given the lines ˇ _I_ = [1, 0, 0] and ˇ _E_ = [1, 1, 1] and the result\nof Exercise 1, find the coordinates of the points _P_ = ˇ _L_ ·ˇ _I_ and _Q_ =\nˇ _L_ · ˇ _E_.\n\n**3.** Use Formula (2.2.5) and the results of the preceding exercises to find\nthe\n\ncross ratio _IE_ , ˇ _I_ ˇ _E_ and hence the cross ratio _IE_ , _PQ_.\n\n**4.** The twenty-four permutations of four collinear points _A_ , _B_ , _C_ ,\n_D_ yield at most six different cross ratios, which for distinct points take\nthe values\n\n_x_ , 1 _/x_ , 1 − _x_ , 1 _/_(1 − _x_), _x/_( _x_ − 1), ( _x_ − 1) _/x_.\n\n**5.** Show that if _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ are three distinct points on a line,\nthen _AB_ , _CA_ = ∞, _AB_ , _CB_ = 0, and _AB_ , _CC_ = 1.\n\n**6.** How does the proof of Desargues’s Theorem given above depend on the\n\ncommutativity of multiplication?\n\n**7.** Use suitably chosen coordinates to prove Desargues’s Theorem for a\n\nprojective plane over a field of characteristic 2.\n\n2.3\n\nELLIPTIC AND EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY\n\nWhen a polarity on P _n_ is defined by a matrix _E_ that is congruent to the\nidentity matrix _I_ = _In_ +1 = \\1, 1, _. . ._ , 1\\ (i.e., _PEP_ ˇ = _I_ for\nsome invertible matrix _P_), the quadratic forms **(** _x_**)** → **(** _x\nx_**)** and **[** _u_**]** → **[** _u u_**]**\n\non R _n_ +1 and Ř _n_ +1 corresponding to the dual bilinear forms\n\n**(** _x y_**)** = **(** _x_**)** _E_**(** _y_**)** ˇ and **[** _u v_**]** =\n**[** _u_**]** ˇ _E_ −1**[** _v_**]**\n\nare _positive definite_.

Coordinates of the absolute points of a conic defined\n\nby a symmetric matrix _A_ satisfy the quadratic equations **(** _x_**)**\n_A_**(** _x_**)** ˇ = 0\n\nand **(** _x_**)** _H_**(** _x_**)** ˇ = 0, leading to a homogeneous quartic\nequation in two of the coordinates. In order for the conic to be a circle, the\n\nlatter equation must have either two double roots or one quadru-\n\nple root. In the complete hyperbolic plane, circles (other than the\n\nabsolute circle) can be _ordinary_ , _ideal_ , or _exceptional_(Johnson 1981,\npp. 460–463).∗\n\nFor an ordinary circle there are three possibilities. A “proper cir-\n\ncle” or _pericycle_ , the locus of points at a fixed distance (the _radius_)\nfrom a given point (the _center_), is tangent to the absolute circle at\n\ntwo imaginary points. A “limiting curve” or _horocycle_ , a circle of infi-\n\nnite radius, is doubly tangent to the absolute circle at one real point.\n\nAn “equidistant curve” or _pseudocycle_ , the locus of points at a fixed\n\ndistance (the _coradius_) from a given line (the _axis_), is tangent to the\nabsolute circle at two real points (Sommerville 1914, pp. 257–258;\n\nCoxeter 1942, pp. 216–217); like a hyperbola, a pseudocycle has two\n\n∗ Apart from where it touches the absolute circle, all the points and tangent\nlines\n\nof an ordinary circle are ordinary, and those of an ideal circle are all\nideal. An\n\nexceptional circle is the envelope of ordinary lines making a fixed acute\nangle with\n\na given line, together with two absolute lines; its nonabsolute points are\nideal. In the Beltrami-Klein model, ordinary and ideal circles appear as\nellipses (or Euclidean\n\ncircles), exceptional circles as hyperbolas.\n\n54\n\nLinear Geometries\n\nbranches.∗ We denote the respective circles by S1, ˙S1, and ¨S1. A line\n\nmeets an ordinary circle in at most two ordinary or absolute points.\n\nIn the elliptic and Euclidean planes, all circles are bounded, and\n\na circle can be drawn through any three points not on a line (in eP2,\n\nthere are four such circles). In the hyperbolic plane, three noncollinear\n\npoints lie on a unique pericycle, horocycle, or branch of a pseudocycle.\n\nIn addition, three distinct pseudocycles pass through the vertices of\n\nany triangle, with two vertices on one branch and one on the other.\n\nIn hyperbolic 3-space, an ordinary sphere is a quadric of constant\n\npositive, zero, or negative curvature: a _perisphere_ S2, a _horosphere_\n\n˙S2, or a _pseudosphere_ ¨S2 (a “proper sphere,” a “limiting surface,”\n\nor an “equidistant surface”). Perispheres and horospheres are sim-\n\nply connected; a pseudosphere has two sheets. Analogously, there\n\nare three types of ordinary hypersphere in hyperbolic _n_ -space H _n_\n\n( _n > _ 3). The terms “horocycle” and “horosphere” were coined by\n\nLobachevsky. The names “pseudocycle” and “pseudosphere” are\n\nadapted from Beltrami, who called a manifold of constant negative\n\ncurvature “pseudospherical” space.†\n\nWe have referred to the classical Euclidean and non-Euclidean\n\ngeometries as “metric spaces.” A (real) _metric_ on a space is a real-\n\nvalued function _d_ on pairs of points that is nonnegative, nondegen-\n\nerate, and symmetric and satisfies the Triangle Inequality. That is,\n\n_d_( _X_ , _Y_) ≥ 0, _d_( _X_ , _Y_) = 0 if and only if _X_ = _Y_ , _d_( _X_ ,\n_Y_) = _d_( _Y_ , _X_),\n\n∗ That a pseudocycle is tangent to the absolute circle is evident in the\nBeltrami-Klein model for the hyperbolic plane. In the “conformal disk” model,\na branch of a pseudocycle (also called a “hypercycle” or an “equidistant”) is\nrepresented by an arc of\n\na circle that intersects the boundary circle at an angle equal to the angle of\nparal-\n\nlelism for its coradius (cf. Goldman 1999, p. 24; Onishchik & Sulanke 2006,\n¶2.6.6), but this is a property of the model and not of the geometry. If the\ntangents to two\n\ncurves at a common absolute point of ¯\n\nH2 are ordinary lines, they are parallel or\n\ncoincident and the angle between the curves is zero. But if either of the\ncurves is\n\ntangent to the absolute line through that point, as when one of the curves is\nthe\n\nabsolute circle itself, the angle between them is infinite or indeterminate.\n\n† These seem more appropriate than the alternatives “hypercycle” and “hyper-\n\nsphere,” especially as the latter term is ambiguous.\n\n2.4 Hyperbolic Geometry\n\n55\n\nand _d_( _X_ , _Y_) ≤ _d_( _X_ , _Z_) + _d_( _Z_ , _Y_) (Ratcliffe 1994/2006,\n§ 1.3). A space with such a metric is a _metric space_. It is evident that\ndistance as it has\n\nbeen defined for each of the linear geometries eP _n_ , E _n_ , and H _n_ has\nthe first three properties, as does distance on S _n_(to be defined in the\nnext\n\nsection). We defer discussion of the Triangle Inequality to § 3.4.\n\nAngles are naturally measured in terms of radians, so that a right\n\nangle is π _/_ 2\\. However, distance in a given metric space is defined\n\nonly up to multiplication by a positive constant. In a Euclidean space,\n\nthe unit of distance is arbitrary, but in elliptic or hyperbolic space,\n\nthere is a natural metric determined by the curvature of the space.\n\nThe formulas presented here assume an elliptic or hyperbolic unit of\n\ndistance corresponding to a spatial curvature of ±1.\n\nThe idea of a real metric space being defined by an ( _n_ − 1)-\n\nquadric—the _absolute_ —in real projective _n_ -space is due to Cay-\n\nley (1859), who considered the cases where the absolute is an imagi-\n\nnary or degenerate conic.∗ Klein (1871, 1873) completed what Cayley\n\nhad begun, obtaining the hyperbolic plane by letting the absolute be\n\nreal and treating the elliptic plane as a sphere with antipodal points\n\nidentified. It was also Klein who proposed the names “elliptic” and\n\n“hyperbolic” for the non-Euclidean linear geometries. An affine conic\n\nis an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola according as it has 0, 1, or 2\n\nreal points at infinity, and a line in elliptic, Euclidean, or hyperbolic\n\n_n_ -space meets the absolute in 0, 1, or 2 real points.\n\nEXERCISES 2.4\n\n**1.** Find the angle of parallelism for the distance _x_ = ½ log 3.\n\n**2.** Taking _H_ as the pseudo-identity matrix \\1, 1, −1\\, find an equation\nfor the pericycle in H2 with center (0, 0, 1) and radius cosh−1 2.\n\n∗ The degenerate case had been anticipated by von Staudt (1847), who obtained\nthe\n\nEuclidean plane from the real affine plane by fixing an absolute elliptic\ninvolution\n\non the line at infinity.\n\n56\n\nLinear Geometries\n\n**3.** Taking _H_ as the pseudo-identity matrix \\1, 1, −1\\, find an equation\nfor\n\n√\n\nthe pseudocycle with axis [1, 0, 0] and coradius sinh−1\n\n3\\.\n\n**4.** With the absolute circle of ¯\n\nH2 given by the equation _x_ 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1 + _x_ 2 − _x_ 3\n\n= 0,\n\nthe three points (2, 2, 3), (−2, 2, 3), and (0, 0, 1) lie on a horocycle.

With more structure than a projective\n\ntriangle, which is just a configuration of three points and three lines,\n\nthis is a set\n\n_ABC_ = {∅; _A_ , _B_ , _C_ ; _BC_ , _CA_ , _AB_ ; _ABC_}, partially ordered\nby dimensionality and incidence, consisting of eight\n\ngeometric “entities”: the _nullity_(the empty set ∅); three _vertices_(the\npoints _A_ , _B_ , and _C_); three _sides_(the segments _BC_ , _CA_ , and\n_AB_); and the triangle’s _body_(the interior region _ABC_).\n\nAny three points _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ on the elliptic sphere S2 that do not lie\non a great circle are the vertices of a unique triangle _ABC_ , each\n\nof whose sides _BC_ , _CA_ , and _AB_ is a proper great arc and whose body\n_ABC_ is contained within a hemisphere. The three points, together\n\nwith their antipodes ¯\n\n_A_ , ¯\n\n_B_ , and ¯\n\n_C_ , are the vertices of a tessellation of\n\nS2 by eight spherical triangles, consisting of four antipodal pairs of\n\ncongruent triangles, namely,\n\n_ABC_ = {∅; _A_ , _B_ , _C_ ; _BC_ , _CA_ , _AB_ ; _ABC_} and\n\n¯ _A_ ¯ _B_ ¯ _C_ = {∅; ¯ _A_ , ¯ _B_ , ¯ _C_ ; ¯ _B_ ¯ _C_ , ¯ _C_ ¯ _A_ , ¯\n_A_ ¯ _B_ ; ¯ _A_ ¯ _B_ ¯ _C_},\n\n76\n\nCircular Geometries\n\n¯ _ACB_ = {∅; ¯ _A_ , _C_ , _B_ ; _BC_ , _B_ ¯ _A_ , ¯ _AC_ ; ¯ _ACB_} and _A_\n¯ _C_ ¯ _B_ = {∅; _A_ , ¯ _C_ , ¯ _B_ ; ¯ _B_ ¯ _C_ , ¯ _BA_ , _A_ ¯ _C_ ; _A_\n¯ _C_ ¯ _B_}, _C_ ¯ _BA_ = {∅; _C_ , ¯ _B_ , _A_ ; ¯ _BA_ , _CA_ , _C_ ¯ _B_ ;\n_C_ ¯ _BA_} and\n\n¯ _CB_ ¯ _A_ = {∅; ¯ _C_ , _B_ , ¯ _A_ ; _B_ ¯ _A_ , ¯ _C_ ¯ _A_ , ¯ _CB_ ; ¯\n_CB_ ¯ _A_}, _BA_ ¯ _C_ = {∅; _B_ , _A_ , ¯ _C_ ; _A_ ¯ _C_ , ¯ _CB_ , _AB_ ;\n_BA_ ¯ _C_} and\n\n¯ _B_ ¯ _AC_ = {∅; ¯ _B_ , ¯ _A_ , _C_ ; ¯ _AC_ , _C_ ¯ _B_ , ¯ _A_ ¯ _B_ ; ¯\n_B_ ¯ _AC_}.\n\nTwo triangles that have two vertices and one side in common, the\n\nother pair of vertices being antipodal and the other pairs of sides\n\nbeing supplementary—e.g., _ABC_ and each of the three triangles\n\n¯ _ABC_ , _C_ ¯ _BA_ , _BA_ ¯ _C_ —are said to be a _colunar_ pair. The region\nbounded by two great semicircles that is the union of the bodies\n\nand the common side of such a pair of triangles is called a _lune_(or\n\n“biangle”).\n\nIn all cases, the body of a triangle is a bounded convex region,\n\nand in any of the metric spaces S2, E2, or H2, each interior angle of a\n\ntriangle has a radian measure between 0 and π. Triangles in the elliptic\n\nplane eP2 also have these properties. Any three noncollinear points _A_ ,\n\n_B_ , and _C_ determine a tessellation of eP2 by four triangles, any two of\nwhich are colunar (except that antipodal vertices are now coincident).\n\nAll four triangles have the same vertices _A_ , _B_ , and _C_. If the sides of\none triangle are labeled _BC_ , _CA_ , and _AB_ and its body denoted by _ABC_\n—with the supplementary segments being _CB_ , _AC_ , and _BA_ and the colunar\nregions being _ACB_ , _CBA_ , and _BAC_ —then we have the\n\ntriangles\n\n_ABC_ = {∅; _A_ , _B_ , _C_ ; _BC_ , _CA_ , _AB_ ; _ABC_}, _ACB_ = {∅; _A_ ,\n_C_ , _B_ ; _BC_ , _BA_ , _AC_ ; _ACB_}, _CBA_ = {∅; _C_ , _B_ , _A_ ; _BA_ ,\n_CA_ , _CB_ ; _CBA_}, _BAC_ = {∅; _B_ , _A_ , _C_ ; _AC_ , _CB_ , _AB_ ;\n_BAC_}.\n\n3.4 Triangles and Trigonometry\n\n77\n\nThree points _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ in the same hemisphere of the\n\nhyperbolic sphere ¨S2 that do not lie on a great circle and the three\n\nantipodal points ¯\n\n_A_ , ¯\n\n_B_ , and ¯\n\n_C_ are the vertices of an antipodal pair of\n\ntriangles\n\n_ABC_ = {∅; _A_ , _B_ , _C_ ; _BC_ , _CA_ , _AB_ ; _ABC_} and\n\n¯ _A_ ¯ _B_ ¯ _C_ = {∅; ¯ _A_ , ¯ _B_ , ¯ _C_ ; ¯ _B_ ¯ _C_ , ¯ _C_ ¯ _A_ , ¯\n_A_ ¯ _B_ ; ¯ _A_ ¯ _B_ ¯ _C_}.\n\nEach side of either triangle is a proper great arc, and each of their\n\nbodies is a bounded convex region.\n\nBecause S2, E2, and H2 are simply connected, any line or great cir-\n\ncle separates the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane or the elliptic sphere\n\ninto two half-planes or hemispheres. If _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ are the vertices\nof a triangle, the (open) half-plane or hemisphere bounded by the line\n\nor great circle joining _A_ and _B_ that contains _C_ may be denoted by\n\n· _AB_ · ↑ _C_ and the one that does not by · _AB_ · _/C_. The body (interior)\nof _ABC_ is then the intersection of · _BC_ ·↑ _A_ , · _CA_ ·↑ _B_ , and ·\n_AB_ ·↑ _C_ , and its exterior is the union of · _BC_ · _/A_ , · _CA_ · _/B_ ,\nand · _AB_ · _/C_.\n\nThe _area_ of a triangle is the area of its body. If the interior angles at\n\nthe vertices _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ of a metric triangle _ABC_ have the\nrespective measures _α_ , _β_ , and _γ_ , then the sum _α_ \\+ _β_ \\+ _γ_ lies\nin the range 0 to 3π, with\n\n3π _> α _\\+ _β_ \\+ _γ > _π for _ABC_ in S2 or eP2;\n\n_α_ \\+ _β_ \\+ _γ_ = π for _ABC_ in E2;\n\n(3.4.1)\n\n0 _< α _\\+ _β_ \\+ _γ < _π for _ABC_ in H2 or ¨S2.\n\nThe amount by which the angle sum _α_ \\+ _β_ \\+ _γ_ exceeds or falls short of\nπ\n\nfor a non-Euclidean triangle _ABC_ is its _spherical excess_ or _hyperbolic_\n_defect_ and (assuming a spatial curvature of ±1) is equal to its area.\n\nThe area of a triangle is also a function of the lengths of its sides,\n\nwhich depend on the chosen unit of distance. Some writers treat non-\n\nEuclidean lengths and areas as if they were independent of each other\n\nand consequently arrive at mutually inconsistent formulas.\n\n78\n\nCircular Geometries\n\n**C.** _The Triangle Inequality._ If the sides _BC_ , _CA_ , and _AB_ of a\nmetric triangle _ABC_ have the respective lengths _a_ , _b_ , and _c_ , then\nbecause lines in a plane or great circles on a sphere are geodesics and\nbecause\n\n_ABC_ is a bounded convex region, it follows that for both Euclidean\n\nand non-Euclidean triangles we have the strict inequalities\n\n_b_ \\+ _c > a_,\n\n_c_ \\+ _a > b_,\n\n_a_ \\+ _b > c_.\n\n(3.4.2)\n\nMoreover, most of the familiar Euclidean theorems about congruent\n\ntriangles—in particular side-angle-side, angle-side-angle, and side-\n\nside-side—hold for non-Euclidean triangles as well. (However, angle-\n\nangle-side congruence does not generally hold either in the elliptic\n\nplane or on the elliptic sphere.) Since the interior angles of a non-\n\nEuclidean triangle determine not just its shape but its size, there is\n\nalso an angle-angle-angle congruence theorem.\n\nIn the Euclidean and hyperbolic planes E2 and H2 and on the ellip-\n\ntic and hyperbolic spheres S2 and ¨S2, the length of a side _AB_ of a\n\ntriangle _ABC_ is the same as the distance between the points _A_ and\n\n_B_. This makes it easy to extend the Triangle Inequality\n\n| _AB_ | ≤ | _BC_ | + | _CA_ |, \n\n(3.4.3)\n\nwhich holds for any three points _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ in Euclidean _n_ -space,\nto hyperbolic _n_ -space and to the elliptic and hyperbolic _n_ -spheres (in\n\n¨S _n_ the points must be restricted to the same _n_ -hemisphere). If _A_ ,\n_B_ , and _C_ do not lie on a line or a great circle, they are the vertices of\na\n\nunique triangle _ABC_ and the conclusion follows from (3.4.2). Other-\n\nwise, we still have strict inequality except when _C_ lies in the segment\n\nor proper great arc _AB_ or, in the case of S _n_ , when _A_ and _B_ are\nantipodal, the only situations in which one distance equals the sum of the\n\nother two.\n\nBecause the total length of an elliptic line is π, the length of a side\n\n_AB_ of a triangle in the elliptic plane eP2 may be greater than the dis-\n\ntance [ _AB_] between the points _A_ and _B_(no distance can exceed π _/_ 2).\n\n3.4 Triangles and Trigonometry\n\n79\n\nConsequently, the validity of the Triangle Inequality for three non-\n\ncollinear points _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ in eP _n_ does not immediately follow\nfrom the inequalities (3.4.2). Nevertheless, by considering triangles _ABC_\n\nwith sides of various lengths less than, equal to, or greater than π _/_ 2,\n\none can verify that [ _AB_] _< _[ _BC_] + [ _CA_] in every case. (I leave the\ndetails to the reader.) For three collinear points _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ ,\neither the sum of the three distances is π or else one of the distances is the\n\nsum of the other two; in either case, we have [ _AB_] ≤ [ _BC_] + [ _CA_].\n\nCombining the two results, we find that the Triangle Inequality holds\n\nfor any three points in elliptic _n_ -space.∗ Thus distance in each of the\n\ngeometries S _n_ , E _n_ , H _n_ , and eP _n_ has the essential properties\nthat define a metric space.\n\n**D.** _Trigonometry._ How the sides and the angles of a triangle are\n\nrelated depends on the curvature of the underlying space. For exam-\n\nple, in a Euclidean triangle _ABC_ , the side lengths _a_ , _b_ , _c_ and the\ncorresponding angles _α_ , _β_ , _γ_ satisfy the Law of Sines\n\nsin _α_ = sin _β_ = sin _γ_.\n\n(3.4.4)\n\n_a_\n\n_b_\n\n_c_\n\nOn the elliptic sphere S2 or in the elliptic plane eP2, the formula is\n\nsin _α_ = sin _β_ = sin _γ_ ,\n\n(3.4.5)\n\nsin _a_\n\nsin _b_\n\nsin _c_\n\nwhile on the hyperbolic sphere ¨S2 or in the hyperbolic plane H2 it is\n\nsin _α_ = sin _β_ = sin _γ_.\n\n(3.4.6)\n\nsinh _a_\n\nsinh _b_\n\nsinh _c_\n\n∗ Two elliptic triangles whose corresponding sides have equal lengths are\ncongru-\n\nent. However, two triangles having equal distances between corresponding pairs\n\nof vertices need not be. Moreover, if _A_ , _B_ , and _C_ are three points on\na line such that none of the three distances [ _BC_], [ _CA_], and [ _AB_] is\nequal to the sum of the other two, then the three segments into which they\nseparate the line can have the\n\nsame lengths as the sides of a triangle, and the three distances can be equal\nto the\n\ndistances between pairs of vertices of a triangle.\n\n80\n\nCircular Geometries\n\nTwo sides and the included angle of a Euclidean triangle _ABC_\n\nare related to the third side by the Law of Cosines\n\n_c_ 2 = _a_ 2 + _b_ 2 − 2 _ab_ cos _γ_.\n\n(3.4.7)\n\nWhen the angle at _C_ is a right angle, this reduces to the Pythagorean\n\nTheorem.

The area\nof an asymptotic triangle is still finite and equal to the hyperbolic defect,\n\nso that a “tricuspal” triangle, with three absolute vertices, has an area\n\nof π.\n\nTwo Euclidean triangles whose corresponding angles are equal\n\nhave the lengths of their sides proportional: the triangles are similar\n\nbut not necessarily congruent. In the elliptic or hyperbolic plane, how-\n\never, equality of angles implies equality of side lengths. Consequently,\n\nit is sometimes said that scale models are impossible in non-Euclidean\n\ngeometry, but this is not entirely true. A spherical triangle with shorter\n\nsides can have the same angles as a plane triangle in elliptic 3-space,\n\nand a pseudospherical triangle with longer sides can have the same\n\nangles as a plane triangle in hyperbolic 3-space.\n\nThe _n_ -dimensional analogue of a triangle, a polytope with _n_ \\+ 1\n\nvertices and _n_ \\+ 1 sides (or “facets”), is called a _simplex_.

Thus a horocycle cannot have an\n\nequation analogous to (3.5.4) or (3.5.6). However, all horocycles\n\nare congruent, so that, following Coxeter (1942, p. 250), we can\n\ndeduce their metric properties from a conveniently chosen particular\n\ncase.\n\n3.5 Non-Euclidean Circles\n\n85\n\nThe three points\n\n_P_ ∞ = (0, 1 | 1), \n\n_P_ 0 = (0, 0 | 1), \n\nand\n\n_P_ 1 = (1, 1 | 3 )\n\n2\n\n2\n\ndetermine a horocycle whose center is the absolute point _P_ ∞ and\n\nwhose ordinary points are, for each real number _x_ ,\n\n_Px_ = _x_ , 1 _x_ 2 1 _x_ 2 + 1 .\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe radial line joining _Px_ to the center and the tangent line at _Px_ are\nrespectively\n\nˇ\n\n_Rx_ = 1, _x_ − _x_\n\nand\n\nˇ _Tx_ = _x_ , 1 _x_ 2 − 1 − 1 _x_ 2 .\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe horocyclic arc with endpoints _Px_ and _Py_ has length _s_ = | _y_ − _x_ |, and a horocyclic sector ¨\n\n_W_( _s_) of arc length _s_(see Figure 3.5d) has area\n\n_s_. Thus the arc from _P_ 0 to _P_ 1 has length 1 and the corresponding\nsector has area 1. Moreover, the radial line at one end of a horocyclic arc of\n\nunit length is parallel to the tangent line at the other end. Thus ˇ\n\n_R_ 0 is\n\nparallel to ˇ\n\n_T_ 1 and ˇ _R_ 1 is parallel to ˇ\n\n_T_ 0\\.\n\nThe foregoing results for pericycles, pseudocycles, and horocycles\n\nalso hold for small circles on the hyperbolic sphere ¨S2.\n\nFigure 3.5d Horocyclic sector in H2\n\n86\n\nCircular Geometries\n\nEXERCISES 3.5\n\n**1.** The area of the elliptic plane is 2π.\n\n**2.** Find the length of the chord of a pericycle of radius sinh−1 2 joining\nthe\n\nends of an arc of length π.\n\n**3.** The tangent lines at the ends of a horocyclic arc of unit length\nintersect at an angle of π _/_ 3\\.\n\n**4.** Show that the isosceles asymptotic triangle _P_ 0 _P_ 1 _P_ ∞ has area\nπ −\n\n2 tan−1 2.\n\n3.6\n\nSUMMARY OF REAL SPACES\n\nThe following diagram (Figure 3.6a) exhibits the relationships among\n\nthe various real linear and circular geometries.

A dualizing\n\ntransformation of projective _n_ -space mapping points to hyperplanes\n\nand hyperplanes to points is a _correlation_. All collineations of\n\nFA _n_ preserve midpoints; an _affinity_ preserves barycenters. Like-\n\nwise, any collineation or correlation of FP _n_ preserves harmonic sets;\n\na _projective_ one preserves cross ratios. We shall mainly be con-\n\ncerned in this chapter with operations on real geometries. Given\n\na suitable coordinate system, each collineation of A _n_ or P _n_ can\n\nbe represented by a _linear transformation_ of a real vector space.\n\nThe structure of affine and projective collineation groups and sub-\n\ngroups corresponds to relations among groups of linear transforma-\n\ntions.\n\n4.1\n\nLINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS\n\nGeometric operations on projective and affine spaces and the metric\n\nspaces derived from them can be expressed in terms of certain trans-\n\nformations of vector spaces, which are not geometries but algebraic\n\nsystems with quasi-geometric properties. The set R _n_ of all lists of _n_\n\nreal numbers, regarded as rows **(** _x_**)** = ( _x_ 1, _x_ 2, _. . ._ ,\n_xn_), constitutes an _n_ -dimensional left vector space over the real field\nR, with vector\n\naddition and scalar multiplication defined by\n\n87\n\n88\n\nReal Collineation Groups\n\n**(** _x_**)** \\+ **(** _y_**)** = ( _x_ 1 + _y_ 1, _. . ._ , _xn_ \\+ _yn_),\n(4.1.1)\n\nλ**(** _x_**)** = (λ _x_ 1, _. . ._ , λ _xn_),\n\nfor all [**(** _x_**)** , **(** _y_**)**] ∈ R _n_ × R _n_ and all [λ, **(**\n_x_**)**] ∈ R × R _n_.

Vectors of either space correspond\n\nto _linear forms_ on the other. Each column **[** _u_**]** defines a linear\nform\n\n·**[** _u_**]** : R _n_ → R, with **(** _x_**)** → **(** _x_**)[** _u_**]** ,\nand each row **(** _x_**)** defines a linear form **(** _x_**)** · : Ř _n_ →\nR, with **[** _u_**]** → **(** _x_**)[** _u_**]**.\n\nGiven a set of _k_ rows **(** _xi_**)** , the set **(** _x_ 1**)** , _. . ._ ,\n**(** _xk_**)** of all linear combinations λ1**(** _x_ 1**)** \\+ · · · + λ\n_k_**(** _xk_**)** is a subspace of R _n_ , their _span_. For _k_ = 0, this is\nthe trivial subspace 0 _n_ = {**(** 0**)**}. If\n\nλ _i_**(** _xi_**)** = **(** 0**)** only\n\nwhen every λ _i_ = 0, the rows are _linearly independent_. The span of\n\n_n_ linearly independent rows of R _n_ is the whole space, and the rows\n\nform a _basis_ for R _n_. Similar definitions apply to columns of the dual\nspace Ř _n_.\n\nAn _m_ × _n_ matrix _A_ over R determines a dual pair of _linear_\n_transformations_\n\n· _A_ : R _m_ → R _n_ , with **(** _x_**)** → **(** _x_**)** _A_ and _A_ · : Ř\n_n_ → Ř _m_ , with **[** _u_**]** → _A_**[** _u_**]**.\n\n4.1 Linear Transformations\n\n89\n\nConversely, the matrix _A_ is uniquely determined by the effect of either\n\ntransformation on a basis for its domain. Linearity means that · _A_ and\n\n_A_ · satisfy the distributive and associative laws\n\n[**(** _x_**)** \\+ **(** _y_**)**] _A_ = **(** _x_**)** _A_ \\+ **(** _y_**)**\n_A_ and _A_(**[** _u_**]** \\+ **[** _v_**]**) = _A_**[** _u_**]** \\+ _A_**[**\n_v_**]** ,\n\n[λ**(** _x_**)**] _A_ = λ[**(** _x_**)** _A_]\n\nand\n\n_A_(**[** _u_**]** _ρ_) = ( _A_**[** _u_**]**) _ρ_ , (4.1.3) thus preserving\nlinear combinations. Because multiplication of real\n\nnumbers is commutative, linear transformations themselves behave\n\nlike vectors, with\n\n**(** _x_**)**[· _A_ \\+ · _B_] = **(** _x_**)** _A_ \\+ **(** _x_**)** _B_ and\n( _A_ · + _B_ ·)**[** _u_**]** = _A_**[** _u_**]** \\+ _B_**[** _u_**]** ,\n**(** _x_**)**[λ· _A_] = λ[**(** _x_**)** _A_]\n\nand\n\n( _A_ · _ρ_)**[** _u_**]** = ( _A_**[** _u_**]**) _ρ_. (4.1.4) The set of all\n_m_ × _n_ matrices over R (or all linear transformations\n\nR _m_ → R _n_ or Ř _n_ → Ř _m_) forms an _mn_ -dimensional vector space R _m_\n× _n_ , with additive group T _m_ × _n_.

The center ZMat _n_(R) of the\n\nring Mat _n_(R) is the field of _n_ × _n_ scalar matrices, isomorphic to R via\nthe mapping λ _I_ → λ.\n\nThe multiplicative semigroup of Mat _n_(R) is isomorphic to the _lin-_\n\n_ear semigroup_ L _n_ = L( _n_ ; R) of all linear transformations taking R _n_\nor Ř _n_ into itself. Each operation on either space is represented by an\n\n_n_ × _n_ matrix over R, with products of operations corresponding to\n\nproducts of matrices.

By\n\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry (equivalent to\n\nPappus’s Theorem), a projective collineation of P _n_ −1 is uniquely\n\ndetermined by its effect on the frame of reference. Specifically, let the\n\ndesired images of the points _i_(1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _n_) and __ be the _n_ \\+ 1 points\n_A_ 1,\n\n_A_ 2,\n\n_. . ._ , _An_ ,\n\nand\n\n_P_ ,\n\nno _n_ lying in the same hyperplane, with respective coordinate vectors\n\n**(** _a_ 1**)** , **(** _a_ 2**)** , _. . ._ , **(** _an_**)** , and **(**\n_p_**)**.\n\nThe _n_ \\+ 1 _n_ -vectors are linearly dependent, while any _n_ of them are\nlinearly independent. It is therefore possible to express **(** _p_**)** as a\nlinear combination of the vectors **(** _ai_**)**(1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _n_). Since the\ncoordinates are homogeneous, we may assume without loss of generality that\n**(** _p_**)** =\n\n**(** _ai_**)**. Thus, if _A_ is the invertible matrix of order _n_ with rows\n**(** _ai_**)** =\n\n**(** _δi_**)** _A_ , so that\n\n**(** _ai_**)** = **(** **)** _A_ , the projective collineation _i_ → _Ai_ ,\n\n__ → _P_ , with **(** _δi_**)** → **(** _ai_**)** and **(** **)** → **(**\n_p_**)** , is induced by the _projective_ _linear transformation_\n\n· _A_ : PR _n_ → PR _n_ , with **(** _x_**)** → **(** _x_**)** _A_ , det _A_ =\n0.\n\n(4.4.1)\n\nHere PR _n_ = R _n/_ GZ denotes the ( _n_ − 1)-dimensional _projective linear_\n_space_ whose “points” are one-dimensional subspaces **(** _x_**)** of R _n_.\nAll nonzero scalar multiples of _A_ define the same transformation.\n\n4.4 Projective Collineations\n\n103\n\nIf the columns of _A_ are denoted by **[** _aj_**]** , with\n\n**[** _aj_**]** = **[** _q_**]** , then the\n\nsame projective collineation is also uniquely determined as a mapping\n\n**[** _aj_**]** → **[** _δj_**]** , **[** _q_**]** → **[** **]** of\nhyperplanes. In this guise, the collineation is induced by the “inverse dual”\nof the transformation (4.4.1), i.e., by\n\nthe projective linear transformation\n\n_A_ −1· : P Ř _n_ → P Ř _n_ , with **[** _u_**]** → _A_ −1**[** _u_**]**.\n\n(4.4.2)\n\nThus the general projective collineation has two dual aspects:\n\nregarded as a transformation **(** _x_**)** → **(** _x_**)** of points of P\n_n_ −1, it corresponds to postmultiplication of the row vector **(** _x_**)**\nby an invertible matrix _A_ ; as a transformation **[** _u_**]** → **[**\n_u_**]** of hyperplanes of P _n_ −1, it is effected by premultiplying the\ncolumn vector **[** _u_**]** by the matrix _A_ −1.\n\nAny nonzero scalar multiple of either the vector or the matrix will\n\nserve equally well. In short, given an invertible matrix _A_ of order _n_ , a\nprojective collineation of P _n_ −1 is defined by either of the rules\n\nλ( _x_) = **(** _x_**)** _A_ or _A_**[** _u_**]** = **[** _u_**]** _ρ_ ,\n(4.4.3)\n\nwhere λ and _ρ_ are any nonzero scalars. When the dimension _n_ − 1\n\nof the space is odd, the collineation is direct or opposite according as\n\ndet _A_ is positive or negative. (Projective spaces of even dimension are\n\nnot orientable.)\n\nIn the case of a fixed point or a fixed hyperplane of the projective\n\ncollineation defined by a real _n_ × _n_ matrix _A_ , **(** _x_**)** or **[**\n_u_**]** is a scalar multiple of **(** _x_**)** or **[** _u_**]**. Thus **(**\n_x_**)** _A_ = λ**(** _x_**)** or _A_**[** _u_**]** = **[** _u_**]** λ for\nsome λ. Any such scalar λ is an _eigenvalue_ of _A_ , with **(** _x_**)** or\n**[** _u_**]** being a corresponding row or column _eigenvector_. If _A_ is\nmultiplied by some\n\nnonzero scalar, then so are the eigenvalues. Projective collineations of\n\nP _n_ −1 are of various types, with the configuration of fixed points and\n\nhyperplanes depending on the solutions of the _characteristic equation_\n\ndet ( _A_ − λ _I_) = 0 (cf. Veblen & Young 1910, pp. 271–276). The only\nprojectivity on P1 with more than two fixed points is the identity;\n\nany other projectivity is said to be _elliptic_ , _parabolic_ , or\n_hyperbolic_ according as the number of fixed points is 0, 1, or 2.\n\n104\n\nReal Collineation Groups\n\nAs previously noted, the set of all invertible real matrices of\n\norder _n_ forms a multiplicative group, the _general linear_ group GL ∼\n\n_n_ =\n\nGL( _n_ ; R). The center of GL _n_ is the _general scalar_ group GZ of nonzero\nscalar matrices. The set of classes _A_**** of nonzero scalar multiples of\nmatrices _A_ ∈ GL\n\n∼\n\n_n_ forms the central quotient group PGL _n_ =\n\nGL _n/_ GZ, the (real) _projective general linear_ group, which is isomorphic\nto the _general projective_ group GP _n_ −1, the group of projective\n\ncollineations of P _n_ −1.\n\nMatrices of the type _A_ −1 _B_ −1 _AB_ , called “commutators,” generate the\ncommutator subgroup of GL _n_ : the _special linear_ group SL _n_ , comprising\nall matrices with determinant 1 (cf. Artin 1957, pp. 162–163).\n\nWhen _n_ is odd, the groups PGL _n_ and SL _n_ are isomorphic. The center of\nSL\n\n∼\n\n_n_ is the _special scalar_ group SZ _n_ = C( _n_ ,2), consisting of the\nscalar matrices of order _n_ with determinant 1, i.e., _I_ alone for _n_ odd,\n\n± _I_ for _n_ even.∗ The _projective special linear_ group PSL ∼\n\n_n_ = SL _n/_ SZ _n_ ,\n\n( _n_ even) is isomorphic to the _special projective_ group SP _n_ −1, the\ngroup of _equiprojective_(sense-preserving) collineations of P _n_ −1.\n\nThe _general commutator_ quotient group GCom ∼\n\n= GL _n/_ SL _n_ is\n\nthe multiplicative group of equivalence classes _α_ = { _A_ ∈ GL _n_ : det _A_\n= _α_}, where _α_ · _β_ = _αβ_. Thus the mapping GL _n_ → GCom, with _A_ → det\n_A_ , is a homomorphism with kernel SL _n_ = 1. (The\n\nequivalence classes are just the cosets of SL _n_.) The extended mapping\n\ndet : L _n_ → Com from the set L _n_ of all real _n_ × _n_ matrices\n(invertible or not) to the set Com = GCom ∪ 0 of their determinant classes is\na semigroup homomorphism. The group G+Com ∼\n\n= G+L _n/_ SL _n_ of classes of\n\nmatrices with positive determinants is the _direct commutator_ quotient\n\ngroup. The two classes 1 and –1 form the _unit commutator_ quotient\n\ngroup ¯SCom ∼\n\n= ¯SL _n/_ SL _n_. Note that GCom is the direct product of the\n\nsubgroups G+Com and ¯SCom.\n\nThe groups GCom, G+Com, and ¯SCom are respectively isomor-\n\nphic to the groups GZ, GZ+, and ¯SZ of general, positive, and unit\n\n∗ Here ( _n_ , 2) denotes the greatest common divisor of _n_ and 2.\n\n4.4 Projective Collineations\n\n105\n\nscalar matrices, and the class _α_ may be identified with the scalar\n\n_α_. Note, however, that the determinant mappings GZ → GCom,\n\nGZ+ → G+Com, and ¯SZ → ¯SCom, with λ _I_ → λ _n_ , are isomorphisms\n\nonly when _n_ is odd.\n\nWhen _n_ is even, we have several short exact sequences (the image\n\nof one mapping being the kernel of the next), with subgroups and\n\nquotient groups of the general linear group GL _n_ related as in the\n\nfollowing commutative diagram.\n\nEvery collineation of a projective _n_ -space (over a field) preserves\n\nharmonic sets, tetrads with cross ratio −1. A _projective_ collineation\n\npreserves all cross ratios. In the standard notation, invented by von\n\nStaudt, if some projective collineation transforms a figure X into a fig-\n\nure X, we write X X. If related by an elation or a homology, the\n\nfigures are _perspective_ , and we write X X (cf. Veblen & Young 1910,\n\np. 57); for a harmonic homology this becomes X\n\n∧ X. Every projective\n\ncollineation can be expressed as a product of perspective collineations.\n\nIn some treatments a projective collineation is defined as such a prod-\n\nuct; since every perspective collineation preserves cross ratios, this is\n\nconsistent with our definition.\n\n106\n\nReal Collineation Groups\n\nEXERCISES 4.4\n\n**1.** Find the projective collineation of P2 that maps the reference points\n\n1, 2, 3, and __ into the points _A_ 1, _A_ 2, _A_ 3, and _P_ with respective\ncoordinates (1, −1, −1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 0, −1), and (2, 1, −2).\n\n**2.** Find the lines into which the reference lines ˇ\n\n1, ˇ 2, ˇ 3, and ˇ __ are mapped\n\nby the collineation of Exercise 1.\n\n**3.** Two real _n_ × _n_ matrices _A_ and _A_ are _similar_ if there exists\nan invertible matrix _P_ such that _PAP_ −1 = _A_.

Like a projective collineation, a projective cor-\n\nrelation is uniquely determined by its effect on the frame of reference.\n\nThus, given _n_ \\+ 1 hyperplanes\n\n4.5 Projective Correlations\n\n107\n\nˇ _A_ 1,\n\nˇ _A_ 2, _. . ._ , ˇ _An_ , and ˇ _P_ ,\n\nno _n_ passing through the same point, let\n\n**(** _a_ 1**)** , **(** _a_ 2**)** , _. . ._ , **(** _an_**)** , and **(**\n_p_**)**.\n\nbe the transposes of their coordinate vectors, adjusted to make\n\n**(** _p_**)** =\n\n**(** _ai_**)** , and let _A_ be the _n_ × _n_ matrix with rows **(**\n_ai_**)** , so that **(** _ai_**)** = **(** **)** _A_. Then the projective\ncorrelation _i_ → ˇ _Ai_ , __ → ˇ _P_ , with **(** _δi_**)** → **(** _ai_**)**\nˇ and **(** **)** → **(** _p_**)** ˇ, is induced by the _projective linear_\n_cotransformation_\n\n· _A_ ˇ : PR _n_ → P Ř _n_ , with **(** _x_**)** → **(** _x_**)** _A_ ˇ, det\n_A_ = 0.\n\n(4.5.1)\n\nDenote the columns of _A_ by **[** _aj_**]** , and let\n\n**[** _aj_**]** = **[** _q_**]**. Then the\n\nsame projective correlation is also uniquely determined as a mapping\n\n**[** _aj_**]** → **[** _δj_**]** ˇ, **[** _q_**]** → **[** **]** ˇ, taking\nhyperplanes into points. This is induced by the projective linear\ncotransformation\n\n_A_ −1·ˇ : P Ř _n_ → PR _n_ , with **[** _u_**]** → _A_ −1**[** _u_**]** ˇ.\n\n(4.5.2)\n\nThus, given an invertible matrix _A_ of order _n_ , a projective correlation\nof P _n_ −1 is defined by either of the rules\n\nλ**[** _x_**]** ˇ = **(** _x_**)** _A_ or _A_**(** _u_**)** ˇ = **[** _u_**]**\n_ρ_ , (4.5.3)\n\nwhere λ and _ρ_ are any nonzero scalars.\n\nIf some projective correlation transforms a figure X into a figure\n\nX, we write X X. The product of two projective correlations is a\n\nprojective collineation. Thus if X X and X X, then X X.\n\nThe group PGL _n_ of dually paired projective linear transformations\n\n(PR _n_ , P Ř _n_) → (PR _n_ , P Ř _n_)\n\nis a subgroup of index 2 in the _double projective general linear_ group\n\nDPGL _n_ of such transformations and dually paired projective linear\n\ncotransformations\n\n(PR _n_ , P Ř _n_) → (P Ř _n_ , PR _n_).\n\n108\n\nReal Collineation Groups\n\nFor _n > _ 2, the group DPGL _n_ is isomorphic to the _dualized general_\n_projective_ group ˇ\n\nGP _n_ −1 of projective collineations and correlations,\n\nor _projectivities_ , of P _n_ −1.\n\nA projective correlation of period 2 is a _polarity_ , pairing each point\n\nwith a unique hyperplane. Two points or two hyperplanes are _conju-_\n\n_gate_ in a given polarity if each is incident with the hyperplane or point\n\nthat is polar to the other. A point or a hyperplane that is incident\n\nwith its own polar or pole is _self-conjugate_. If two figures X and X are\n\nrelated by a polarity, we write X\n\n∨ X.\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition for an invertible matrix _A_ of\n\norder _n_ to define a polarity of P _n_ −1 is that _A_ be either symmetric or\nskew-symmetric. To see why this is so, suppose that we have a projective\ncorrelation · _A_ ˇ of period 2, taking **(** _x_**)** into **[** _x_**]** and\n**[** _x_**]** into **(** _x_**)** = **(** _x_**)** , i.e., the polarity with\n**(** _x_**)** and **[** _x_**]** as pole and polar. Then we must have both\n\nλ**[** _x_**]** ˇ = **(** _x_**)** _A_ and _A_**(** _x_**)** ˇ = **[**\n_x_**]** _ρ_.\n\nPostmultiplying the first equation by **(** _x_**)** ˇ and premultiplying the\nsecond by **(** _x_**)** , we get\n\nλ**[** _x_**]** ˇ**(** _x_**)** ˇ = **(** _x_**)** _A_**(** _x_**)** ˇ = **(**\n_x_**)[** _x_**]** _ρ_.\n\nIf we now take the transpose of each expression, reversing the order,\n\nwe get\n\n_ρ_**[** _x_**]** ˇ**(** _x_**)** ˇ = **(** _x_**)** _A_ ˇ**(** _x_**)** ˇ =\n**(** _x_**)[** _x_**]** λ.\n\nThis is an identity for all points **(** _x_**)**. Unless **[** _x_**]**\nˇ**(** _x_**)** ˇ = **(** _x_**)[** _x_**]** is always zero, we must have λ =\n_ρ_ , and hence _A_ ˇ = _A_ ; i.e., _A_ is symmetric.\n\nBut if **(** _x_**)** _A_**(** _x_**)** ˇ is identically zero, then _A_ must\nbe skew-symmetric: _A_ ˇ = − _A_. In the latter case, which can occur only\nwhen _n_ is even, we have a _null polarity_ , in which every point (and every\nhyperplane) is\n\nself-conjugate.\n\nOn the projective line P1, hyperplanes are points, so that each\n\npoint has dual coordinates **(** _x_**)** and **[** _x_**]**. The\ncorrespondence between the two sets of coordinates is given by the identity\nregarded as a null\n\npolarity\n\n4.5 Projective Correlations\n\n109\n\nλ**[** _x_**]** ˇ = **(** _x_**)** _J_ or _J_**(** _x_**)** ˇ = **[** _x_**]**\n_ρ_ , (4.5.4)\n\ndefined by the skew-symmetric matrix\n\n0\n\n1\n\n_J_ =\n\n.\n\n−1 0\n\nA true polarity on P1, defined by a symmetric matrix, is an _involution_ ,\n\na projectivity interchanging conjugate points, at most two being self-\n\nconjugate.\n\nIn any projective space over a field F, the correlation that inter-\n\nchanges points and hyperplanes with identical coordinates **(** _x_**)** and\n**[** _x_**]**\n\nis a polarity, the _canonical polarity_ for the chosen frame of reference.\n\nWhen F = R, the equation **(** _x_**)[** _x_**]** = 0 has no nonzero\nsolutions, so that no point or hyperplane is self-conjugate; i.e., the real\npolarity\n\n**(** _x_**)** ↔ **[** _x_**]** is elliptic.\n\nBecause of the fact that the real field R has no nontrivial auto-\n\nmorphisms, _all_ collineations and correlations of a real projective space\n\npreserve cross ratios; i.e., for _n > _ 1, _every collineation or correlation\nof_ P _n_ −1 _is projective_(Veblen & Young 1918, pp. 251–252). In projective\nspaces over some other number systems, such as the complex field C,\n\nthere are collineations and/or correlations that are not projective.∗\n\nEXERCISES 4.5\n\n**1.** Show that the projective correlation of P2 that maps the reference\npoints\n\n1, 2, 3, and __ into the lines ˇ _A_ 1, ˇ _A_ 2, ˇ _A_ 3, and ˇ _P_ with\nrespective coordinates [−1, 3, 2], [−1, 1, 1], [2, −3, −4], and [4, −3, −5] is\na\n\npolarity.\n\n∗ By definition, any collineation of a projective line over a field F\npreserves harmonic sets. If F has no nontrivial automorphisms, preservation of\nharmonic sets implies\n\npreservation of cross ratios, so that every one-dimensional collineation is a\nprojec-\n\ntivity; in the case of the real field R, this was first shown by von Staudt.\nIn general, if K is a division ring, a one-to-one mapping of a projective line\nKP1 onto itself\n\nthat preserves harmonic sets will preserve cross ratios only up to an\nautomorphism\n\nor co-automorphism of K (Artin 1957, p. 85). Onishchik & Sulanke (2006,\n¶1.4.5)\n\nprove this for the case where K is a field but elsewhere (p. 1) erroneously\nstate that invariance of harmonic sets by itself implies invariance of cross\nratios.\n\n110\n\nReal Collineation Groups\n\n**2.** Find the points into which the reference lines ˇ\n\n1, ˇ 2, ˇ 3, and ˇ __ are\n\nmapped by the polarity of Exercise 1.\n\n**3.** A skew-symmetric matrix of odd order is singular.\n\n4.6\n\nSUBGROUPS AND QUOTIENT GROUPS\n\nSince every _n_ -dimensional vector space over R is isomorphic to R _n_ ,\n\nand since the choice of a basis or a coordinate system is arbitrary,\n\nthere is no loss of generality in using R _n_ itself and the standard basis\n\n[**(** _δ_ 1**)** , _. . ._ , **(** _δn_**)**] to define linear, affine, or\nprojective transformations and groups. The different representations of a\ngiven transformation\n\nthat result from a change of basis vectors or coordinates are equivalent\n\nunder matrix similarity.\n\nBasic operations on vector spaces or geometries leave certain fun-\n\ndamental properties invariant: linear transformations preserve linear\n\ncombinations, affine collineations preserve barycenters, and projec-\n\ntive collineations preserve cross ratios. These invariant properties\n\ncharacterize the associated linear, affine, and projective transforma-\n\ntion groups. Affine collineations or linear transformations preserving\n\nsense, size, or slope determine various normal subgroups (direct, unit,\n\nor dilative) of the general affine group GA _n_ or the general linear\n\ngroup GL ∼\n\n_n_ = GA _n/_ T _n_.\n\nThe relationship between the general affine and general linear\n\ngroups can be expressed as a short exact sequence\n\n0 → T _n_ → GA _n_ → GL _n_ → 1.\n\nLikewise, for the general dilative and general scalar groups we have\n\n0 → T _n_ → GD _n_ → GZ → 1.\n\nHere 0 is the trivial subgroup of the additive group of translations.\n\n4.6 Subgroups and Quotient Groups\n\n111\n\nThe one-dimensional affine and linear groups are identical to the\n\ncorresponding dilative and scalar groups:\n\nGA ∼\n\n∼\n\n∼\n\n∼\n\n1 = GD1,\n\nG+A1 = GD+, ¯SA = ¯SD\n\n= T1,\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1,\n\nSA1\n\nGL ∼\n\n∼\n\n∼\n\n∼\n\n1 = GZ,\n\nG+L1 = GZ+,\n\n¯SL1 = ¯SZ,\n\nSL1 = 1.\n\nAlso, the additive group T(R) ∼\n\n= T1 is isomorphic to the multiplicative\n\ngroup G+L(R) ∼\n\n= GZ+ of positive reals, via the mapping _x_ → exp _x_.\n\nWhen _n_ ≥ 2, the various groups of affinities of A _n_ or linear\ntransformations of R _n_ are all distinct. The general, positive, and unit\nscalar\n\ngroups GZ, GZ+, and ¯SZ do not vary with _n_.\n\nHow the subgroups of the general affine group GA _n_ or the gen-\n\neral linear group GL _n_ are related to one another depends in part on\n\nwhether _n_ is even or odd. The following diagrams (Figure 4.6a) show\n\nthe principal normal subgroups of GA _n_. When two groups are joined\n\nby a line, the one below is a (normal) subgroup of the one above, and\n\nthe line is marked with the quotient group. Similar diagrams show-\n\ning normal subgroups of GL _n_(with the same quotient groups) can\n\nbe constructed by changing group symbols A _n_ to L _n_ , D _n_ to Z, and T\n_n_ to 1.

It is customary\nto call _x_ and _y_ the _abscissa_ and the _ordinate_ of _P_. The vertices of\nthe triangle of reference are the _origin O_ = (0, 0) and the two basepoints\n\n_I_ = (1, 0) and _J_ = (0, 1).\n\nAn affine line ˇ\n\n_Q_ may be given homogeneous coordinates [ _u_ , _v_ , _w_],\n\nwith _P_ lying on ˇ\n\n_Q_ if and only if _xu_ \\+ _yv_ \\+ _w_ = 0. If _v_ = 0, we may normalize the\ncoordinates of ˇ\n\n_Q_ as [ _m_ , −1, _b_], which we abbreviate to\n\n[ _m_ , _b_]; _m_ and _b_ are called the _slope_ and the _y-intercept_ of ˇ\n\n_Q_. If _v_ = 0,\n\n113\n\n114\n\nEquiareal Collineations\n\nthen _u_ = 0, and the coordinates are normalized as [−1, 0, _a_], which\n\nwe abbreviate to [ _a_]; we call _a_ the _x-intercept_ of ˇ\n\n_Q_. The line ˇ\n\n_Y_ = [0, 0]\n\n(equation _y_ = 0) is the _x-axis_ , and the line ˇ\n\n_X_ = [0] (equation _x_ = 0)\n\nis the _y-axis_. Also significant are the _unit point E_ = (1, 1) and the\n_unit_ _line_ ˇ\n\n_E_ = [−1, −1].\n\nTwo lines [ _m_ 1, _b_ 1] and [ _m_ 2, _b_ 2] are parallel if and only if _m_\n1 = _m_ 2, and any two lines [ _x_ 1] and [ _x_ 2] are parallel. To obtain the\nextended affine plane F ¯\n\nA2, we adjoin to the _ordinary_ points ( _x_ , _y_) a set of _clinary_ points\n( _m_), one lying on each _usual_ line [ _m_ , _b_] of slope _m_ , and a point\n( ) lying on every _vertical_ line [ _x_]. The point _X_ = (0) that lies on\nevery _horizontal_ line is the _terminus_ , and the point _Y_ = ( ) is the\n_zenith_. The adjoined points all lie on the _meridian_(“line at infinity”) ˇ\n\n_O_ = [ ].

The “straight” rotation · _R_ leaves each branch\n\nof the hyperbola invariant, while the “crossed” rotation · _S_ inter-\n\nchanges the two branches. As an affine collineation, a metalinear\n\nreflection is a unit affinity; a hyperbolic rotation is an equiaffinity.\n\nW\n\n_t_\n\nO\n\n1\n\nI\n\nFigure 5.4a Hyperbolic sector of area 1 _t_\n\n2\n\nEach point _W_ on the branch of the hyperbola _x_ 2 − _y_ 2 = 1 with _x > _ 0\ndetermines a hyperbolic sector, bounded by radius vectors from\n\nthe origin _O_ to the points _I_ = (1, 0) and _W_ = (cosh _t_ , sinh _t_) and\nby the arc from _I_ to _W_(see Figure 5.4a).

Every\nequiaffinity can be expressed as the product of two affine reflections and as\nthe product\n\nof at most three shears.\n\nThough we have sorted affine reflections into ortholinear, paralin-\n\near, and metalinear families, these are distinctions based on matrix\n\nrepresentations; all affine reflections are actually conjugate in the\n\nunit affine group ¯SA2. The only other kind of opposite unit affin-\n\nity is an affine transflection, the product of an affine reflection and a\n\ntranslation; all affine transflections are likewise conjugate. Equiaffini-\n\nties, on the other hand, fall into classes with essentially different\n\ngeometric properties (cf. Artzy 1965, pp. 92–97; Neumann, Stoy &\n\nThompson 1994, pp. 133–135).\n\nThe particular kind of equiaffinity represented by (5.5.2) depends\n\nmainly on the trace _a_ \\+ _d_ of the matrix. It is an elliptic rotation if\n\n| _a_ \\+ _d_ | _< _ 2; a translation, a shear, or a parabolic rotation if _a_ \\+ _d_ =\n\n2; a half-turn or a half-shear if _a_ \\+ _d_ = −2; a hyperbolic rotation if\n\n| _a_ \\+ _d_ | _> _ 2 (“straight” if _a_ \\+ _d > _ 2, “crossed” if _a_ \\+ _d < _−2). With a change of coordinates if need be, any equiaffinity can be put into\n\none of the canonical forms of the preceding sections; the trace of the\n\ntransformation matrix and the kind of equiaffinity are the same in any\n\ncase. The set of all unimodular transformations of the vector space R2\n\nconstitutes the special linear group SL2, and the set of all equiaffinities\n\nof A2 constitutes the special affine group SA2.\n\nAll nontrivial equiaffinities of A2 are listed in Table 5.5.\n\n5.5 Summary of Equiaffinities\n\n131\n\nTable 5.5 _Plane Equiaffinities_\n\nEquiaffinity\n\nTypical Mapping\n\nInvariant Pencil\n\nFixed Points\n\nElliptic\n\n_μ_(cos _θ_ , sin _θ_) →\n\nEllipses\n\nCenter (0, 0)\n\nrotation\n\n_μ_(cos ( _θ_ \\+ _ρ_), sin ( _θ_ \\+ _ρ_))\n\n_x_ 2 + _y_ 2 = _w_ 2\n\nTranslation\n\n( _x_ , _y_) → ( _x_ \\+ _h_ , _y_ \\+ _k_)\n\nParallel lines\n\nNone\n\n_kx_ − _hy_ = _u_\n\nShear\n\n( _x_ , _y_) → ( _x_ , _y_ \\+ _fx_)\n\nParallel lines\n\nAxis _x_ = 0\n\n_x_ = _u_\n\nParabolic\n\n( _x_ , _y_) → ( _x_ \\+ _h_ , _y_ \\+ 2 _hx_ \\+ _h_ 2) Parabolas\n\nNone\n\nrotation\n\n_y_ = _x_ 2 + _v_\n\nHalf-turn\n\n( _x_ , _y_) → (− _x_ , − _y_)\n\nConcurrent lines\n\nCenter (0, 0)\n\n_y_ = _mx_\n\nHalf-shear\n\n( _x_ , _y_) → (− _x_ , − _y_ \\+ _hx_)\n\nParataxes\n\nCenter (0, 0)\n\n_x_ 2 = _u_ 2\n\n_μ_(cosh _t_ , sinh _t_) →\n\n_μ_(cosh ( _t_ \\+ _r_), sinh ( _t_ \\+ _r_)),\n\n_ν_(sinh _t_ , cosh _t_) →\n\nHyperbolic\n\n_ν_\n\nHyperbolas\n\nCenter (0, 0)\n\n(sinh ( _t_ \\+ _r_), cosh ( _t_ \\+ _r_))\n\nrotation\n\n_x_ 2 − _y_ 2 = _u_ 2\n\nor\n\n(2 types)\n\n_μ_\n\nor\n\n(cosh _t_ , sinh _t_) →\n\n− _μ_\n\n_y_ 2 − _x_ 2 = _v_ 2\n\n(cosh ( _t_ \\+ _s_), sinh ( _t_ \\+ _s_)),\n\n_ν_(sinh _t_ , cosh _t_) →\n\n− _ν_(sinh ( _t_ \\+ _s_), cosh ( _t_ \\+ _s_))\n\nIf _P_ 0 = ( _x_ 0, _y_ 0), _P_ 1 = ( _x_ 1, _y_ 1), and _P_ 2 = ( _x_ 2, _y_\n2) are any three points of A2, the directed area _P_ 0 _P_ 1 _P_ 2 of the\nordered triad ( _P_ 0 _P_ 1 _P_ 2) is given by\n\n_x_\n\n_x_\n\n_x_\n\n2 _P_\n\n1\n\n_y_ 1\n\n2\n\n_y_ 2\n\n0\n\n_y_ 0\n\n0 _P_ 1 _P_ 2 =\n\n_x_\n\n\\+\n\n\\+\n\n.\n\n(5.5.3)\n\n2\n\n_y_ 2\n\n_x_ 0 _y_ 0\n\n_x_ 1 _y_ 1\n\nThe directed area is zero if the three points are collinear and otherwise\n\nis positive or negative according as the sense of the triangle _P_ 0 _P_ 1 _P_\n2\n\nagrees or disagrees with the sense of the reference triangle _OI J_.

An extensive treatment of geometries of this type is given\n\nby Onishchik & Sulanke (2006, § 2.8).

If _P_ = _Q_ and **(** _f_**)** = **(** _g_**)** ,\nthen the mirrors coincide, and the isometry is the identity. If _P_ = _Q_ but\n**(** _f_**)** = **(** _g_**)** , then the mirrors are parallel, and the\nisometry is a translation orthogonal to the mirrors\n\nthrough twice the distance between them. Otherwise, the two mirrors\n\nare intersecting, and the isometry is a rotation about their common\n\nhyperline through twice the angle between them.\n\nThe rotation that is the product of reflections in given inter-\n\nsecting hyperplanes ˇ\n\n_P_( _f_) and ˇ\n\n_Q_( _g_) with coordinates [**[** _p_**]** , _f_] and\n\n[**[** _q_**]** , _g_] is represented by a _transorthogonal rotation matrix_ ,\nwhich is a transorthogonal matrix [ _R_ , **(** _h_**)**]1 = [ _P_ , **(**\n_f_**)**]1 · [ _Q_ , **(** _g_**)**]1 with _rij_ = **(** _pi_**)[** _qj_**]**\nand _hj_ = **(** _f_**)[** _qj_**]** \\+ _gj_ , (6.2.5)\n\n146\n\nReal Isometry Groups\n\nwhere **(** _pi_**)** and **[** _qj_**]** are the _i_ th row and the _j_ th\ncolumn of the corresponding orthogonal reflection matrices _P_ and _Q_ and\nwhere **(** _f_**)** and **(** _g_**)** are the corresponding displacement\nvectors.

A chain is essentially a real projective line\nembedded in a complex projective space (cf. Veblen &\n\nYoung 1918, pp. 16–23; Coxeter 1949/1993, app. 1). Some writers, e.g.,\n\nSchwerdtfeger (1962, p. 1) and Goldman (1999, p. 9), prefer to speak\n\nof “circles,” a term reserved here for 1-spheres in a real inversive or\n\nreal metric space.\n\nWe observe that the complex projective plane CP2 has all the pos-\n\ntulated properties of a real plane except for not satisfying Axiom S\n\nof § 2.1. Given four distinct collinear points _U_ , _V_ , _W_ , and _Z_ not\nall belonging to the same chain, let us define the _shell_ C( _UVWZ_) to be\nthe set of points on the line _UV_ that contains those four points together\n\nwith all the points of the chain through any three points of the set.\n\n(A shell has the topology of a real sphere S2.) Then we obtain the\n\ncomplex projective plane by replacing Axiom S with\n\nAxiom S2. _There is more than one chain on a line but not more than_\n\n_one shell._\n\nPoints and hyperplanes of CP _n_ can be given homogeneous coor-\n\ndinates in C _n_ +1 and Č _n_ +1, and collineations and correlations are then\nassociated with square matrices. The _antitranspose A_ ∗ of a complex\n\nmatrix _A_ is its transposed conjugate ¯\n\n_A_ ˇ; a matrix _A_ is _Hermitian_(“anti-\n\nsymmetric”) if _A_ ∗ = _A_. Any invertible Hermitian matrix _A_ of order _n_\n\\+ 1 defines an antipolarity on CP _n_(an anti-involution on CP1).

In particular, any homology of unit cross ratio _ι_\n\nwhose center _O_ is antipolar to its median hyperplane ˇ\n\n_O_ induces a _uni-_\n\n_tary inversion_ on Iu _n_. For a harmonic homology, with cross ratio −1, this\nis an _orthogonal inversion_ , of period 2. When _O_ and ˇ\n\n_O_ are, respec-\n\ntively, interior and exterior to , as when they have the respective\n\ncoordinates\n\n(1, 0, _. . ._ , 0, 0) and [1, 0, _. . ._ , 0, 0],\n\nthe inversions so induced are _elliptic_ , leaving no points of Iu _n_ fixed.\n\nBy restricting ourselves to those holomorphisms that commute with\n\nthese _central inversions_ , we convert the Möbius _n_ -antisphere Iu _n_ into\nthe _elliptic n_ -antisphere Su _n_( _n_ ≥ 0).\n\nAs applied to the complex projective line CP1, this procedure\n\nis carried out on an inversive chain Iu0, which is essentially a real\n\ninversive circle I1. The central inversions on Iu0 are induced by pro-\n\njectivities that leave a certain pair of points of CP1 fixed, yielding the\n\nelliptic chain Su0, with the same metric as the real elliptic circle S1.\n\nA point _Z_ on Su _n_ has normalized coordinates\n\n**(** _z_**)** = ( _z_ 1, _z_ 2, _. . ._ , _zn_ +1), where | _z_ 1|2 + | _z_ 2|2 + · · · + | _zn_ +1|2 = 1. If | _ι_ | = 1, the points **(** _z_**)** and _ι_**(** _z_**)** are _confibral_ ; all points that are confibral to a given point _Z_ lie on a _great chain_ _Z_. This is what Coolidge (1924, pp. 140–141) calls a\n\n“normal” chain or a “geodesic thread.” The points **(** _z_**)** and −**(**\n_z_**)** are _antipodal_.

Thus the\n\nelliptic _n_ -antisphere is isometric to the real elliptic (2 _n_ \\+\n1)-sphere, with great chains of Su _n_ corresponding to great circles of S2\n_n_ +1, and great hyperchains to great (2 _n_ − 1)-spheres. If confibral\npoints are\n\nidentified, Su _n_(“spherical unitary” _n_ -space) is transformed into\nelliptic unitary _n_ -space Pu _n_ , which is isometric to S2 _n_. Great\nchains of Su _n_ project into points of Pu _n_ , great hyperchains of Su _n_\ninto hyperplanes of Pu _n_. All the great chains of Su1 form a _Hopf\nfibration_ of S3\n\n(Hopf 1931, p. 655), and the corresponding projection S3 → S2 is the\n\n_Hopf mapping_(Banchoff 1988, p. 227; cf.

An ellip-\n\ntic inversion can be expressed as the product of inversions in three\n\nmutually orthogonal real circles and is thus an antihomography. Every\n\ncircularity is the product of at most four hyperbolic inversions.\n\nThe formulas and criteria of § 3.1 are applicable. Two real circles\n\n◦\n\n◦\n\n_u_ and _v_ , with respective coordinates [[ _u_]] and [[ _v_]], are\nseparating, tangent, or separated according as the discriminant\n\n[[ _u u_]] [[ _v v_]] − [[ _u v_]]2\n\nis positive, zero, or negative. The cosine of the angle between two\n\nseparating circles is\n\n|[[ _u v_]]|\n\n,\n\n[[ _u u_]] [[ _v v_]]\n\nso that the circles are orthogonal if [[ _u v_]] = 0.\n\n9.2 The Real Inversive Sphere\n\n193\n\nThe product of inversions in two real circles is a _rotary_(or\n\n“elliptic”) homography if the circles are separating, an _elative_(or\n\n“parabolic”) homography if they are tangent, a _dilative_(or “hyper-\n\nbolic”) homography if they are separated. The product of inversions\n\nin three real circles, two of which may be taken to be orthogonal to the\n\nthird, is an _elliptic_ , _parabolic_ , or _hyperbolic_ antihomography\naccording as the first two are separating, tangent, or separated. The product\nof\n\ninversions in four real circles—two separating circles each orthogonal\n\nto both of two separated circles—is a _spiral_(or “loxodromic”) homog-\n\nraphy, the commutative product of a rotary and a dilative homography\n\n(Veblen & Young 1918, pp. 246–248; Coxeter 1966a, pp. 230, 235–237).\n\nThe matrix of any circularity of the real inversive sphere can be\n\nexpressed as the product of inversion matrices (9.2.9), taking one of\n\ntwo forms depending on whether the circularity is direct or opposite.\n\nIn terms of the diagonal matrix _H_ = − _I_ 1,3 = \\ − 1, 1, 1, 1\\, a matrix\n_M_ of determinant 1 such that _MHM_ ˇ = _H_ induces a homography\n\non I2, and a matrix _N_ of determinant −1 such that _NHN_ ˇ = _H_ an\nantihomography. We may call _M_ and _N homographic_ and _antihomographic_\nmatrices. Since _H_(being congruent to _I_ 3,1) is the matrix of a hyperbolic\npolarity, and since the same transformation is induced by\n\na matrix _M_ or _N_ and any of its nonzero scalar multiples, the _general_\n_inversive_ group GI2 of all circularities of I2 is the projective\npseudoorthogonal group PO3,1.

Then the mapping CP1 → ˙S2 can be achieved by\n\nstereographic projection, in which a line through ( _x_ , _y_ , 0) and (0, 0,\n1) meets the sphere again in the point ( _ξ_ , _η_ , _ζ_), with (0, 0, 1)\nitself corresponding to the point at infinity (Klein 1884, part i, chap. 2, §\n2;\n\nNeumann, Stoy & Thompson 1994, pp. 210–211; Carter, Segal & Mac-\n\ndonald 1995, pp. 55–56; cf.

Complex symplec-\n\ntic transformations and matrices and the complex symplectic group\n\nSp( _n_ ; C) ∼\n\n= S˘p _n_ were mentioned at the end of § 5.6. More relevant to\n\nour purposes, however, are transformations, matrices, and groups that\n\ninvolve complex conjugation.\n\nThe standard _inner product_ of two rows **(** _z_**)** and **(** _w_**)** of\nC _n_ or two columns **[** _w_**]** and **[** _z_**]** of Č _n_ is given by\nthe Hermitian sesquilinear form **(** _z_ ¯\n\n_w_**)** = **(** _z_**)(** _w_**)** ∗ or **[** ¯ _w z_**]** = **[** _w_**]**\n∗**[** _z_**]** , (10.1.1)\n\nwhere the star denotes the antitranspose. The associated real-valued\n\nantiquadratic forms **(** _z_ ¯ _z_**)** and **[** ¯\n\n_w w_**]** are positive definite. A _unit_ row\n\n**(** _z_**)** or column **[** _w_**]** has **(** _z_ ¯ _z_**)** = 1 or **[** ¯ _w w_**]** = 1. A _unitary transformation_ of C _n_ or Č _n_ is a linear transformation that takes unit rows into unit rows or unit columns into unit columns. A necessary and sufficient condition for a complex _n_ × _n_ matrix _R_ to determine a unitary transformation · _R_ : C _n_ → C _n_ or _R_ · : Č _n_ → Č _n_ is that _RR_ ∗ = _I_ , and a matrix with this property is called a _unitary matrix_. If _R_ is a unitary matrix, then | det _R_ | = 1. \n\nThe set of all unitary transformations of C _n_ or Č _n_ , or all _n_ × _n_\nunitary matrices, forms a group, the _unitary_ group U ∼\n\n_n_ = U( _n_). Unitary\n\ntransformations whose matrices have determinant 1 form a normal\n\nsubgroup, the _special unitary_ group SU ∼\n\n_n_ = SU( _n_). The center of the\n\nunitary group is the complex unit scalar group ¯SZ(C), represented by\n\nthe unit scalar matrices _ιI_ where | _ι_ | = 1.

Given an ( _n_ \\+ 1) × (\n_n_ \\+ 1) unitary matrix _R_ , the unitary transformation · _R_ : C _n_ +1 → C\n_n_ +1, with **(** _z_**)** → **(** _z_**)** _R_ , defines an _isometry_ of Su\n_n_. A point _Z_ with coordinates **(** _z_**)** is taken into a point _Z_\nwith coordinates **(** _z_**)** _R_ , and a great hyperchain ˘\n\n_W_ with coordinates **[** _w_**]** is taken into a great hyperchain\n\n˘\n\n_W_ with coordinates _R_ ∗**[** _w_**]**. An isometry of Su _n_ preserves\ndistances (7.2.1) between points, but not every distance-preserving\ntransformation is an isometry. The _anti-isometry_ of Su _n_ defined by the\n_anti-unitary_ _transformation_ _R_ : C _n_ +1 → C _n_ +1, with **(** _z_**)**\n→ **(** ¯ _z_**)** _R_ , also preserves distances.\n\nAn isometry other than the identity that leaves invariant every\n\npoint of a great hyperchain is a _unitary reflection_. A unitary reflec-\n\ntion · _R_(2π _/θ_) is determined by its _mirror_ ˘ _R_ and its _angle_ ½ _θ_\n, where 0 _< θ < _ 2π. If ˘ _R_ has coordinates **[** _r_**]** , the\nreflection is represented by a _unitary reflection matrix_ , a unitary matrix\n_R_(2π _/θ_) of order _n_ \\+ 1 with entries\n\n¯ _rirj_\n\n_rij_ = _δij_ \\+ ( _ι_ − 1)\n\n,\n\n(10.1.2)\n\n**[** ¯ _r r_**]**\n\nwhere _ι_ = exp i _θ_.

If _p_ = 2, corres\nponding to an angle of π _/_ 2, (10.1.2) defines an _orthogonal reflection_.\n\nA _central inversion_ , which permutes the confibral points of each\n\ngreat chain and takes each great hyperchain into itself, is represented\n\nby a unit scalar matrix _ιI_. The _negation_ , with _ι_ = −1, interchanges\nanti podal points. Central inversions commute with every isometry.\n\nThe group of all isometries of Su _n_ is the unitary group U _n_ +1.

Artin 1957,\n\npp. 151–158; Aslaksen 1996), the determinant of a square quater-\n\nnionic matrix is a nonnegative real number. If { _A_} is the 2 _n_ × 2 _n_\ncomplex duplex matrix corresponding to an _n_ × _n_ quaternionic matrix\n\n_A_ , then det { _A_} = (det _A_)2. A square matrix _A_ is invertible if and\nonly if det _A_ = 0. The commutator subgroup of GL _n_(H) is the _quaternionic\nspecial linear_ group SL _n_(H) of _n_ × _n_ quaternionic matrices with\ndeterminant 1. The general commutator quotient group GCom(H) ∼\n\n=\n\nGL _n_(H) _/_ SL _n_(H), isomorphic to the positive scalar group GZ+, is the\nmultiplicative group of equivalence classes _α_ of invertible matrices\n\nwith the same determinant _α_.\n\nThe _contrapose A_ ☼ of an _m_ × _n_ quaternionic matrix _A_ is the _n_ × _m_\nmatrix obtained from _A_ by transposing and taking quaternionic conjugates. If\n_m_ = _n_ , then det _A_ ☼ = det _A_. As separate operations, transposition\nand conjugation generally do not preserve quaternionic\n\ndeterminants or even matrix invertibility. For example,\n\n1\n\ni\n\n1\n\n−j\n\n1\n\nj\n\n1\n\n−i\n\nj\n\nk = −i −k = 2 but\n\ni k = −j −k = 0.\n\nA square matrix _S_ with quaternionic entries is _symplectic_ if\n\n_SS_ ☼ = _I_. A symplectic matrix has determinant 1. Each symplectic\n\nmatrix _S_ induces a _symplectic transformation_\n\n· _S_ : H _n_ → H _n_ , with **(** Q**)** → **(** Q**)** _S_ , or _S_ ☼·: ˇ\n\nH _n_ → ˇH _n_ , with **[** Q**]** → _S_ ☼**[** Q**]**.\n\n∗ The convenience of these matrix representations is largely the result of our\nchoos-\n\ning to identify quaternions with _rows_( _t_ , _x_ , _y_ , _z_) or ( _u_ ,\n_v_), belonging to a _left_ vector space over R or C. Because quaternionic\nmultiplication is noncommutative, adopting the opposite convention—identifying\nquaternions with _columns_ and treating H\n\nas a _right_ vector space—is not an inconsequential change, and the\ncorresponding matrix forms are much less intuitive (cf. Du Val 1964, pp.\n39–42).\n\n214\n\nUnitary Isometry Groups\n\nThe (quaternionic) _symplectic_ group S ˜p\n\n∼\n\n_n_\n\n= Sp( _n_ ; H), the multi-\n\nplicative group of _n_ × _n_ symplectic matrices over H, is the group\n\nof symplectic transformations of the left linear space H _n_ of rows\n\n**(** Q**)** = (Q1, _. . ._ , Q _n_) or the right linear space ˇ\n\nH _n_ of columns **[** Q**]** =\n\n[Q1, _. . ._ , Q _n_].\n\nReal and complex symplectic matrices and the real and complex\n\ngroups Sp _n_ and S˘p _n_ were defined in § 5.6. If a real duplex matrix\n\nis orthogonal, it is also symplectic, and conversely, the _orthogonal_\n\n_duplex_ group O\n\n∼\n\n(2) _n_ = O2 _n_ ∩ Sp2 _n_ is isomorphic to the unitary group\n\n_Un_. Likewise, a complex duplex matrix is unitary if and only if it is\n\nsymplectic. The _unitary duplex_ group _U_\n\n∼\n\n(2) _n_ = _U_ 2 _n_ ∩ S ˘\n\np2 _n_ is isomor-\n\nphic to the symplectic group S ˜p _n_(cf. Weyl 1939, pp. 171–173), as is\n\nthe _orthogonal quadruplex_ group O\n\n∼\n\n∼\n\n(4) _n_ = O4 _n_ ∩ Sp\n\n= O\n\n.\n\n4 _n_\n\n4 _n_ ∩ Sp\n\n4 _n_\n\nRelationships among some of these groups are shown in Figure 10.4a.\n\nThe group S ˜p ∼\n\n1 = SU2 is the multiplicative group SL(H) of unit\n\nquaternions (cf. Beardon 1983, pp. 17–18; Neumann, Stoy & Thomp-\n\nson 1994, pp. 196–197). For given unit quaternions L and R, the\n\nmappings Q → ˜LQ and Q → QR correspond respectively to left\n\nand right double rotations of S3, represented by the unit 3-sphere\n\n_t_ 2 + _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 + _z_ 2 = 1 in E4. Every direct isometry of S3 is the\nproduct of a left rotation and a right rotation, corresponding to a\n\nmapping Q → ˜LQR. Since (− ˜L)Q(−R) = ˜LQR, this is a two-to-one\n\nhomomorphism S ˜p ×\n\n→\n\n1\n\nS ˜p1\n\nO+. For each unit quaternion s, the map-\n\n4\n\nping Q → ˜SQS corresponds to a simple rotation that takes the great\n\n2-sphere _t_ = 0, _x_ 2 + _y_ 2 + _z_ 2 = 1 into itself, giving a two-to-one\nhomomorphism S ˜p →\n\n1\n\nO+ (cf. Conway & Smith 2003, pp. 23–24). Factoring\n\n3\n\nout the central inversion Q → −Q, we then have P+O ∼\n\n4 = O+ × O+.\n\n3\n\n3\n\nFor any given nonzero pure quaternion p, the set of unit quater-\n\nnions T = _t_ \\+ _τ_ P, with _t_ and _τ_ real, forms a multiplicative group, a\nsubgroup of the group S ˜p1 of all unit quaternions. The transformations\n\nH → H defined by the mappings Q → ˜TQ and Q → QT correspond to\n\nleft and right Clifford translations of the 3-sphere S3 or elliptic 3-space\n\neP3 (Artzy 1965, pp. 191–193).\n\n10.4 Quaternions and Related Systems\n\n215\n\nA nonzero real scalar multiple λ _S_ of a quaternionic symplectic\n\nmatrix _S_ is a _gyropetic matrix_ , and the multiplicative group of _n_ × _n_\ngyropetic matrices over H is the (quaternionic) _gyropetic_ group G ˜p _n_.\n\nThe group G ˜p ∼\n\n1 =\n\nSU2 is the multiplicative group GL(H) of nonzero\n\nquaternions.\n\nFigure 10.4a Orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic groups\n\n**B.** _The quaternionic projective line._ John Wilker (1993) showed that\n\nthe real inversive 4-sphere I4, represented by the parabolic 4-sphere\n\n˙S4, provides a conformal model for the quaternionic projective line\n\nHP1. Real circles of I4 are _chains_ of HP1. A chain-preserving trans-\n\nformation of HP1 is a _concatenation_ , which is either a projectivity\n\n216\n\nUnitary Isometry Groups\n\nor an antiprojectivity, according as cross-ratio conjugacy classes are\n\npreserved or replaced by their quaternionic conjugates. (Quater-\n\nnionic cross ratios are defined only up to an inner automorphism.)\n\nA concatenation of HP1 is a circularity of I4.\n\nIf _M_ = [(A, B), (C, D)] is a 2 × 2 invertible matrix over\n\nH, a projectivity HP1 → HP1 is induced by the _linear fractional_\n\n_transformation_\n\n· _M_ : H∪{∞} → H∪{∞}, with Q → (QB+D)\\\\(QA+C), det _M_ = 0,\n\n(10.4.4)\n\nwhere Q → ∞ if QB + D = 0, ∞ → B\\A if B = 0, and ∞ → ∞\n\nif B = 0. (The left quotient B\\A is the product of B−1 and A, in that\n\norder.) An antiprojectivity HP1 → HP1 is likewise induced by the\n\n_antilinear fractional transformation_\n\n_M_ : H∪{∞} → H∪{∞}, with Q → ( ˜QB+D)\\\\( ˜QA+C), det _M_ = 0.\n\n(10.4.5)\n\nNote that the linear fractional transformation defined by a nonreal\n\nscalar matrix \\S, S\\ is an inner automorphism. Since a projectivity\n\npreserves all cross-ratio classes and an antiprojectivity preserves real\n\ncross-ratio classes, each of these transformations takes chains into\n\nchains.\n\nIf N is a unit quaternion and _δ_ is a real number, the inversive\n\n3-sphere ˘\n\n_N_( _δ_) = {Q : (re ˜\n\nQn) + _δ_ = 0} ∪ {∞} is a great hyper-\n\nsphere (hyperplane) of ˙S4. If _C_ is a point associated with a finite\n\nquaternion C and _ρ_ is a positive real number, the inversive 3-sphere\n\n◦\n\n_μ(C)_ = {Q : |Q − C| = _ρ_} is a small hypersphere with center _C_\n\nand radius _ρ_. A reflection in a hyperplane ˘\n\n_N_( _δ_) and an inversion in\n\n◦\n\na hypersphere _μ(C)_ are respectively given by\n\nQ → −N( ˜\n\nQN + 2 _δ_)\n\nand\n\nQ → ( ˜\n\nQ − ˜C)\\\\( ˜\n\nQC + _μ_),\n\nwhere _δ_ is real and |N| = 1 and where _μ_ is real and |C|2 + _μ_ = _ρ_ 2 =\n0.\n\nThe respective antiprojectivities are defined by the matrices\n\n10.4 Quaternions and Related Systems\n\n217\n\nN\n\n0\n\nC\n\n1\n\n_N_( _δ_) =\n\nand\n\n_μ_( _C_) =\n\n(10.4.6)\n\n2 _δ_ − ˜N\n\n_μ_ − ˜C\n\n(cf. Wilker 1993, pp. 115–116). Either of these matrices may be\n\nmultiplied by a nonzero _real_ scalar, but they cannot otherwise be\n\nmodified.\n\nWilker showed how a homography or antihomography of the\n\nMöbius 4-sphere I4 (or a direct or opposite isometry of hyperbolic\n\n5-space) can be represented by a linear fractional or antilinear frac-\n\ntional transformation H ∪ {∞} → H ∪ {∞} determined by a 2 × 2\n\ninvertible matrix over H (or a nonzero real scalar multiple thereof).\n\nThe special inversive group SI ∼\n\n4 = P+O5,1 is thus isomorphic to the\n\n_quaternionic projective general linear_ group PGL2(H). The general\n\ninversive group GI ∼\n\n4 = PO5,1 of all circularities of I4 (or all isometries\n\nof H5) is isomorphic to the _quaternionic projective general semilinear_\n\ngroup PG ¯\n\nL2(H), containing PGL2(H) as a subgroup of index 2.\n\nFollowing Ahlfors (1985, pp. 66–69; cf. Maclachlan, Waterman &\n\nWielenberg 1989, p. 740), we define the _reverse_ of a quaternion Q =\n\n_u_ \\+ _v_ j = _t_ \\+ _x_ i+ _y_ j+ _z_ k to be the quaternion Q∗ = _u_ +j _v_\n= _t_ \\+ _x_ i+ _y_ j− _z_ k.\n\nWhen Q is represented by a complex bivalent matrix, the matrix for\n\nQ∗ is the matrix for ˜\n\nQ turned upside down.

Typi-\n\ncally, these are _Coxeter groups_ , generated by reflections in the facets of\n\na simplex (e.g., a triangle or a tetrahedron) whose dihedral angles are\n\nsubmultiples of π, or else subgroups or extensions of such groups. As\n\na discrete subgroup of the continuous group of isometries of some real\n\nmetric space, a Coxeter group may be _spherical_ , _Euclidean_ , or\n_hyperbolic_. Spherical Coxeter groups, described in this chapter, are finite.\n\nTheir infinite Euclidean and hyperbolic counterparts will be discussed\n\nin Chapters 12 and 13.\n\n11.1\n\nPOLYTOPES AND HONEYCOMBS\n\nA polygon or a polyhedron is a two- or three-dimensional instance of a\n\n_polytope_ , a geometric figure consisting of points, line segments, planar\n\nregions, etc., having a particular hierarchical structure. When realized\n\nin some Euclidean or non-Euclidean space, a polytope also has cer-\n\ntain metric properties, such as edge lengths and (dihedral) angles. A\n\npartition of a line or a circle into segments or arcs or a tessellation\n\nof a plane or a sphere by polygons joined edge to edge is a one-\n\nor two-dimensional version of a _honeycomb_ , a kind of degenerate\n\npolytope.\n\n223\n\n224\n\nFinite Symmetry Groups\n\nAbstractly, an _n-polytope_ can be defined as a partially ordered set\n\nof _j_ -dimensional elements (−1 ≤ _j_ ≤ _n_), its _j_ \\- _faces_ , including\njust one of rank −1 and just one of rank _n_. Each _j_ -face _J_ has a unique\n_span_ _J_ , a partially ordered subset of _i_ -faces (−1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _j_)\nconstituting a _j_ -polytope, and a unique _cospan_ _J_ , a partially ordered\nsubset of _k_ -\n\nfaces ( _j_ ≤ _k_ ≤ _n_) having the structure of an ( _n_ − _j_ − 1)-polytope.\nAn _i_ -face _I_ is _subsidiary_ to a _j_ -face _J_ , written _I_ ≤ _J_ ,\nwhenever _I_ ∈ _J_. If _I_ ≤ _J_ but _I_ = _J_ , we write _I < J_. Each _j_\n-face of a _real n_ -polytope is part of a _j_ -subspace of a real metric _n_\n-space.\n\nAll real _n_ -polytopes are _dyadic_ ; i.e., for each _j_ from 0 to _n_ −1,\ngiven a ( _j_ − 1)-face _I_ and a ( _j_ \\+ 1)-face _K_ with _I < K_, there are\nexactly two _adjacent j_ -faces _J_ 1 and _J_ 2 such that _I < J_ 1 _< K _ and\n_I < J_ 2 _< K_. (This condition holds vacuously when _n < _ 1.) An _n_\n-polytope must be _properly connected_ ; i.e., no proper subset of the _j_\n-faces has all the foregoing properties.\n\nAs a partially ordered set, every _n_ -polytope has a _Hasse diagram_\n\n(after Helmut Hasse, 1898–1979), with _n_ \\+ 2 levels of nodes rep-\n\nresenting the _j_ -faces of each rank, nodes on successive levels being\n\nconnected by a branch if the corresponding _j_ -faces are incident. For\n\nexample, Figure 11.1a shows the Hasse diagram for a tetrahedron\n\n_ABCD_ , with four 0-faces, six 1-faces, and four 2-faces. Contained\n\nwithin the Hasse diagram of any polytope are subdiagrams for the\n\nspan and cospan of each of its elements.\n\nThe unique (−1)-face of every real _n_ -polytope is the _nullity_ , alias\n\nthe empty set ∅. The unique (−1)-polytope is the _nullitope_ , the\n\nset {∅} whose only member is the empty set. A 0-face, or _vertex_ , is\n\na point, which may be either ordinary or absolute. A 0-polytope (or\n\n_monon_) _A_ is the set {∅; _A_} spanned by a single point _A_. A 1-face, or\n_edge_ , is a line segment or a minor arc of a great circle. A 1-polytope\n\n(or _dion_) _AB_ = {∅; _A_ , _B_ ; _AB_} comprises the empty set, two points\n_A_ and _B_ , and the segment or arc _AB_ joining them. A 2-polytope is a\n_polygon_ , a 3-polytope is a _polyhedron_ , and a 4-polytope is a\n\n_polychoron_.\n\n11.1 Polytopes and Honeycombs\n\n225\n\nFigure 11.1a Hasse diagram for _ABCD_\n\nThe vertices of a dion are its _endpoints_ , and the edges of a polygon\n\nare its _sides_. The 2-faces of a polyhedron are just called _faces_ , and the\n3-faces of a polychoron are _cells_. The single _n_ -face of an _n_ -polytope\nis its _body_ , essentially its “interior”; an ( _n_ − 1)-face (“hyperface”)\nis a _facet_ , and the ( _n_ − 2)-face between two adjacent facets is a\n_ridge_.\n\nAn _n_ \\- _honeycomb_ , or polytopal space-filling, is abstractly the same\n\nas an ( _n_ +1)-polytope but has a _scope_(all or part of _n_ -space) instead\nof a body. The only 0-honeycomb is an _antipodion_ , consisting of the two\n\npoints of S0. A 1-honeycomb is a _partition_ of a line or a circle, and its\n\n1-faces are called _parts_. A 2-honeycomb is a _tessellation_ of a plane or a\nsphere, and a 3-honeycomb is a _cellulation_. The _n_ -faces (“hypercells”) of\nan _n_ -honeycomb are its _cellules_ , and the ( _n_ − 1)-faces separating\nadjacent cellules are _walls_.\n\nA totally ordered subset of _j_ -faces of an _n_ -polytope or ( _n_ − 1)-\n\nhoneycomb, one of each rank from −1 to _n_ , is called a _flag_. A polytope or\nhoneycomb is _regular_ if there are isometries permuting the vertices\n\n226\n\nFinite Symmetry Groups\n\nand taking any flag into any other flag. The nullitope )( is trivially\n\nregular, as are all monons () and any dion { } with two ordinary or two\n\nabsolute endpoints (but not one of each).\n\nA polygon is regular if it is both equiangular and equilateral, and\n\na partition is regular if it is equilateral. A regular _p_ \\- _gon_ , either a\npolygon with _p_ vertices and _p_ sides or a partition of the circle S1 into\narcs of length 2π _/p_ , is denoted { _p_}. A regular _apeirogon_{∞} is either\na partition of the Euclidean line E1 into infinitely many equal-length\n\nsegments or an infinite polygon inscribed in a horocycle or in the abso-\n\nlute circle of the hyperbolic plane. A regular _pseudogon_{πi _/_ λ} is a\n\npartition of the hyperbolic line H1 into segments of length 2λ.\n\nEach regular figure has a _Schläfli symbol_(after Ludwig Schläfli,\n\n1814–1895). A regular polyhedron or tessellation whose face poly-\n\ngons are { _p_}’s, _q_ meeting at each vertex, so that its “vertex figures”\n\nare { _q_}’s, is denoted { _p_ , _q_}. In general, a regular polytope or\nhoneycomb whose facet or cellule polytopes are { _p_ , _q_ , _. . ._ , _u_}’s\nand whose vertex figures are { _q_ , _. . ._ , _u_ , _v_}’s is denoted { _p_ ,\n_q_ , _. . ._ , _u_ , _v_}.∗ Each regular _n_ -polytope P has a _dual_ ˇ\n\nP, with the _j_ -faces of ˇ\n\nP corresponding\n\nto the ( _n_ − _j_ − 1)-faces of P. The Schläfli symbol for ˇP is the reverse\nof the symbol for P.\n\nEXERCISES 11.1\n\n**1.** Identify the regular polyhedra (or spherical tessellations) {3, 3}, {3,\n4},\n\n{4, 3}, {3, 5}, and {5, 3}.\n\n**2.** Describe the Euclidean tessellations {4, 4}, {3, 6}, and {6, 3}.\n\n11.2\n\nPOLYGONAL GROUPS\n\nThe _symmetry group_ of a figure in a metric space (exclusive of\n\n“fractal” figures with self-similarities) is the group of isometries that\n\n∗ The curly brackets conventionally used in Schläfli symbols should not be\nconfused\n\nwith the standard notation for set membership.\n\n11.2 Polygonal Groups\n\n227\n\ntake the figure into itself. We shall be particularly interested in\n\nfigures whose symmetry groups are discrete. Since every isometry\n\nof a Euclidean or non-Euclidean space is the product of reflections,\n\nany discrete symmetry group is a subgroup of a discrete group gen-\n\nerated by reflections or an extension of such a group by a group\n\nof automorphisms (other isometries). These groups are known as\n\n_Coxeter groups_ , after H. S. M. Coxeter (1907–2003), who developed\n\nthe general theory of reflection groups in the classical real metric\n\nspaces.\n\nIt will be sufficient to consider discrete groups operating in spher-\n\nical, Euclidean, or hyperbolic space. Any group operating in elliptic\n\n_n_ -space eP _n_ is either isomorphic to a group _G_ that operates on the _n_\n-\n\nsphere S _n_ or (if _G_ contains the central inversion) is a quotient group\n_G/_ 2 of half the order.

If the set of generating reflec-\n\ntions of a Coxeter group _W_ has a subset whose product with every\n\nother reflection is of even or infinite period, then _W_ has an _ionic_\n\n_subgroup_ generated by direct isometries that are products of two\n\nreflections in the subset, together with the other reflections and/or\n\n240\n\nFinite Symmetry Groups\n\ntheir conjugates by reflections in the subset. There is an ionic subgroup\n\nof index 2 for each subset of this kind, and there is an ionic sub-\n\ngroup of index 2 _k_ for every _k_ subsets that have no pairs of reflections\nin common.

In order for the group to be discrete, the\n\ndihedral angles of P must all be submultiples of π. When _W_ is finite,\n\nP is a _Möbius simplex_ in S _n_ −1.\n\nIn general, a Coxeter group _W_ ∼\n\n= _ρ_ 0, _. . ._ , _ρn_ −1 generated by\n\nreflections satisfies the relations\n\n( _ρiρj_) _pij_ = 1 (0 ≤ _i_ ≤ _j_ ≤ _n_ − 1, _pii_ = 1) (11.5.1)\n\n(Coxeter 1934a, p. 588; Witt 1941, p. 294). Usually the exponents _pij_\n\nare positive integers, but infinite or imaginary exponents may be used\n\nto indicate that the product _ρiρj_ does not have a finite period.\n\nThe discussion of Coxeter groups is greatly facilitated when a\n\ngroup _W_ is represented by its _Coxeter diagram_ , a labeled graph with\n\n_n_ nodes representing the generators. If the period of the product of\n\ngenerators _ρi_ and _ρj_ is _pij_ , the nodes are joined by a branch marked\n\n‘ _pij_ ’, except that marks ‘3’ are customarily omitted and that when\n\n11.5 Spherical Coxeter Groups\n\n247\n\n_pij_ = 2 the nodes are not joined. For example, the symmetry group\n\n[ _p_ , _q_ , _. . ._ , _u_ , _v_] of the regular polytope or honeycomb { _p_\n, _q_ , _. . ._ , _u_ , _v_}\n\nor its dual { _v_ , _u_ , _. . ._ , _q_ , _p_} is represented by the “string\ndiagram”\n\nfor which the Möbius simplex P is an _orthoscheme_ , a simplex whose\n\nfacets may be serially ordered so that any two that are not consecutive\n\nare orthogonal.\n\nSince reflections are involutory, the relation ( _ρiρj_)2 = 1 implies\n\nthat generators _ρi_ and _ρj_ commute. The angle between facets of P\n\ncorresponding to nodes _i_ and _j_ is π _/pij_ , so that facets corresponding\nto nodes not joined by a branch are orthogonal. When the diagram\n\nof a Coxeter group _W_ consists of two or more disconnected pieces,\n\n_W_ is the direct product of the subgroups represented by the separate\n\nsubdiagrams; otherwise, _W_ is _irreducible_.\n\nThere is a relatively simple test for determining the nature of\n\na Coxeter group _W_ defined by (11.5.1) and acting in an ( _n_ − 1)-\n\ndimensional space. Denote by P the simplex with (dihedral) angles\n\n_αij_ = _αji_(1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _j_ ≤ _n_), and let _A_ be the _n_ × _n Gram matrix_\nwith entries _aij_ = − cos _αij_. The _Schläflian σ_ of P is defined to be the\ndeterminant of the _Schläfli matrix_ 2 _A_ :\n\n_σ_(P) = det 2 _A_ = 2 _n_ det _A_.\n\n(11.5.2)\n\nIf _n_ = 0, we take _σ_(P) equal to unity. Then the simplex P, or the\n\ngroup generated by reflections in its facets, is spherical, Euclidean, or\n\nhyperbolic according as _σ_(P) is greater than, equal to, or less than\n\nzero. We call this rule the Schläfli Criterion (Coxeter 1948, pp. 133–\n\n136; cf. Ratcliffe 1994/2006, §§7.2–7.3). The matrix of cosines, usually\n\ncredited to J. P. Gram (1850–1916), was actually first employed by\n\nSchläfli (1858, §3).\n\nEach irreducible Euclidean Coxeter group is an infinite extension\n\nof some _crystallographic_ spherical Coxeter group (sometimes called a\n\n248\n\nFinite Symmetry Groups\n\n“Weyl group”), with the exponents _pij_( _i_ = _j_) in (11.5.1) restricted to\nthe values 2, 3, 4, and 6. Each such Euclidean group is associated with\n\na simple _Lie group_(after Sophus Lie, 1842–1899), and the spherical\n\nsubgroup is denoted by the corresponding _Cartan symbol_\n\n**A**\n\n∼\n\n_n_( _n_ ≥ 0), **B** _n_ = **C** _n_( _n_ ≥ 1), **D** _n_( _n_ ≥ 2), **E**\n_n_( _n_ = 6, 7, 8), **F** 4, **G** 2\\.\n\nNoncrystallographic spherical Coxeter groups have no such associ-\n\nation but are often given analogous symbols **H** _n_( _n_ = 2, 3, 4) or **I**\n2( _p_) ( _p > _ 6) (cf. Humphreys 1990, p. 32; Davis 2008, p. 104).

Nor are these particular polytopes the only instances of pyramids,\n\nfusils, and prisms.\n\nIn general, if P and Q are disjoint polytopes of dimensions _m_ and _n_ in an\n( _m_ \\+ _n_ \\+ 1)-dimensional space, a _pyramid_ P ∨ Q is constructed by\nconnecting each vertex of P to each vertex of Q. For example, { } ∨ { } is a\ndisphenoid,\n\n() ∨ { _p_} is a _p_ -gonal pyramid, and { } ∨ { _p_} is a dionic _p_ -gonal\npyramid (in 4-space) with _p_ \\+ 2 vertices and _p_ \\+ 2 cells.\n\nLet P and Q be polytopes of dimensions _m_ and _n_(each at least 1) lying in\nsubspaces of an ( _m_ \\+ _n_)-space that intersect in a single point contained\nin the body of each polytope. If each vertex of P is connected to each vertex\nof\n\nQ, the convex hull of the resulting figure defines a _fusil_ P + Q. For\nexample,\n\n{ } + { _p_} is a _p_ -gonal fusil (or “bipyramid”), and { _p_} + { _q_} is a\nfour-dimensional\n\n252\n\nFinite Symmetry Groups\n\n_p_ -gonal _q_ -gonal fusil with _p_ \\+ _q_ vertices and _pq_ cells (a “double\nfusil” if _p_ = _q_).\n\nAgain, let P and Q be polytopes of dimensions _m_ and _n_(each at least 1)\nlying in subspaces of an ( _m_ \\+ _n_)-space intersecting in a single point\nbut with the point now a vertex of each polytope. If at each other vertex of P\nis erected\n\na parallel copy of Q and vice versa, the resulting figure is a _prism_ P × Q.\n\nFor example, { } × { _p_} is a _p_ -gonal prism, and { _p_} × { _q_} is a\nfour-dimensional _p_ -gonal _q_ -gonal prism with _pq_ vertices and _p_ \\+ _q_\ncells (a “double prism” if _p_ = _q_).\n\nThe join, sum, and product operations are associative and commutative,\n\nand a pyramid, fusil, or prism may have any number of components. The join\n\nof two or more simplexes is a simplex. The rhombic sum of two or more ortho-\n\nplexes is an orthoplex. The rectangular product of two or more orthotopes is\n\nan orthotope.\n\nThe only other irreducible spherical Coxeter groups are three\n\n_exceptional_ groups with 6, 7, and 8 generators, of respective orders\n\n72·6!, 576·7!, and 17280·8!, namely,\n\n**E** ∼\n\n∼\n\n∼\n\n6 = [32,2,1],\n\n**E** 7 = [33,2,1],\n\n**E** 8 = [34,2,1],\n\n(11.5.9)\n\nwith Coxeter diagrams\n\nThese are the symmetry groups of three “semiregular” _n_ -polytopes\n\n( _n_ − 4)21 discovered by Thorold Gosset in 1900.

McMullen (1991; cf. McMullen & Schulte 2002, pp.\n\n83–94) has shown how to calculate the orders using only elementary\n\nmethods.\n\nWhen one Coxeter group _W_ contains another Coxeter group _V_\n\nas a subgroup, the fundamental region for _V_ can be dissected into _c_\n\ncopies of the fundamental region for _W_ , where | _W_ : _V_ | = _c_. In some cases, as with halving subgroups, the Coxeter diagram for _V_ is symmetric, and the supergroup _W_ is obtained from it as an extension by\n\na group of automorphisms (reflections or other isometries) permuting\n\nthe generators.\n\nEXERCISES 11.5\n\n**1.** The Schläflian of the circular arc P = ( _p_) of angle π _/p_ is _σ_(P)\n= 4 sin2 π _/p_ = 2 − 2 cos 2π _/p_.\n\nThe length of each part of a regular partition { _p_} or the central angle\nsub-\n\ntended by each side of a regular polygon { _p_} is 2π _/p_.

The toroidal tessellation is reflexible if and only if\n\n_bc_( _b_ − _c_) = 0, and its symmetry group is then the _torohedral_ quotient\ngroup\n\n[3[3]]( _b_ , _c_),\n\n[4, 4]( _b_ , _c_),\n\nor\n\n[3, 6]( _b_ , _c_).\n\nThe order of the group is the number of toroidal triangles, respectively\n\n6( _b_ 2 + _bc_ \\+ _c_ 2), 8( _b_ 2 + _c_ 2), or 12( _b_ 2 + _bc_ \\+ _c_ 2).\nWhen _bc_( _b_ − _c_) = 0, the toroidal tessellation is chiral, with only\nrotational symmetry, the\n\ngroup being\n\n[3[3]]+\n\n,\n\n[4, 4]+\n\n,\n\nor\n\n[3, 6]+\n\n,\n\n( _b_ , _c_)\n\n( _b_ , _c_)\n\n( _b_ , _c_)\n\nof half the order, i.e., 3( _b_ 2 + _bc_ \\+ _c_ 2), 4( _b_ 2 + _c_ 2), or 6(\n_b_ 2 + _bc_ \\+ _c_ 2).\n\nIf the apeirohedral patterns of Figure 12.3b are taken to be\n\nconfined to the hexagonal, square, or rhombic regions shown, with\n\nopposite sides of the boundary polygon identified, they represent the\n\n280\n\nEuclidean Symmetry Groups\n\ntorohedral groups\n\n[3[3]](2,0),\n\n[4, 4](3,0),\n\nand\n\n[3, 6](5,0).\n\nThese three patterns are of particular interest as Euclidean models for\n\nthe finite affine planes\n\nF2A2,\n\nF3A2, and F5A2.\n\nA finite affine plane is a configuration (( _q_ 2) _q_ +1, ( _q_ 2 + _q_) _q_)\nof _q_ 2 points and _q_ 2 + _q_ lines ( _q > _ 1), with _q_ \\+ 1 lines through\neach point and _q_ points on each line. In all known cases, _q_ is a prime or\na prime power.\n\nWith _q_ equal to 2, 3, or 5, this is a configuration (43, 62), (94, 123), or\n\n(256, 305). The first of these is simply a complete quadrangle. The sec-\n\nond is the _Hessian configuration_(after Otto Hesse, 1811–1874), which\n\nalso exists in any projective plane over any field (e.g., C) that contains\n\ntwo cube roots of unity different from 1, say _ω_ and _ω_ 2 (Coxeter & Moser\n1957, p. 98; Coxeter 1974, p. 123). In such a plane, the cross\n\nratio _UV_ , ˇ\n\n_W_ ˇ\n\n_Z_ of two points and two lines of the configuration can\n\ntake on only the two values − _ω_ and − _ω_ 2\\.\n\nFigures 12.4a, 12.4b, and 12.4c illustrate the three cases. Points are\n\ndenoted by capital letters, replacing the asterisks of Figure 12.3b, and\n\nlines are indicated by sequences of three or more dots between let-\n\nters. Repeated occurrences of each of the 4, 9, or 25 points and of\n\neach of the 6, 12, or 30 lines are to be identified. Any two points lie\n\non a unique line, and any two lines either meet in a unique point\n\nor are parallel. The lines comprise 3, 4, or 6 sets of parallel lines,\n\nwith 2, 3, or 5 lines in each direction. Because of their toroidal real-\n\nizations, each of these affine geometries also has a metric structure\n\nand may be regarded as a finite _Euclidean_ plane F2E2, F3E2, or\n\nF5E2.\n\nEvery affinity of the plane F2A2—i.e., every permutation of the\n\nfour points—is an isometry of F2E2, and the isometry group E2(F2) ∼\n\n=\n\n[3[3]](2,0) is the symmetric group S4, of order 24.

Point and line coordinates for each of the planes are\n\nlisted below. A point with coordinates ( _x_ 1, _x_ 2, _x_ 3) lies on a line\nwith coordinates [ _u_ 1, _u_ 2, _u_ 3] if and only if _x_ 1 _u_ 1 + _x_ 2 _u_\n2 + _x_ 3 _u_ 3 is congruent to zero modulo 2, 3, or 5, respectively.\n\nAny 3 × 3 invertible matrix over F2, F3, or F5 defines a projec-\n\ntive collineation of F2P2, F3P2, or F5P2. Those collineations that take\n\nthe unit line [1, 1, 1] into itself are affinities of the associated affine\n\nplane.

Élie Cartan (1927, 1928) showed that each\n\n296\n\nEuclidean Symmetry Groups\n\nsimple Lie group is related to an infinite (Euclidean) group gener-\n\nated by reflections. Moreover, each such “affine Weyl group” is an\n\nextension of one of the finite Weyl groups. This connection was rigor-\n\nously established by Eduard Stiefel (1942). The symbols introduced by\n\nCartan (1927, pp. 218–224) for families of simple Lie groups provide\n\na concise alternative notation for the corresponding crystallographic\n\nCoxeter groups.\n\nA slightly different approach was taken by Ernst Witt (1941,\n\np. 301), who gave each group generated by _n_ reflections in a Euclidean\n\nspace of dimension _n_ or _n_ − 1 its own distinctive symbol, using letters\nfrom the beginning or the end of the alphabet for finite or infinite\n\ngroups, respectively. Coxeter (1948, p. 297) adopted Witt’s group\n\nsymbols as names for the simplexes that serve as fundamental regions\n\nfor the groups (cf. McMullen & Schulte 2002, pp. 72–73).\n\nWitt’s notation for the finite (spherical) groups is consistent with\n\nthat of Cartan in denoting [3 _n_ −1] by **A** _n_ , [3 _n_ −2, 4] by **C**\n_n_ , [3 _n_ −4,2,1]\n\n( _n_ = 6, 7, 8) by **E** _n_ , and [3, 4, 3] by **F** 4\\. However, Witt’s use\nof **B** _n_ for\n\n[3 _n_ −3,1,1], of **D** _p_\n\n2\n\nfor [ _p_], and of **G** 3 and **G** 4 for [3, 5] and [3, 3, 5] obvi-\n\nously conflicts with the Cartan symbols for other groups. The Cartan\n\nnotation for Lie groups is firmly established, and the corresponding\n\nCartan symbols for finite Coxeter groups are the ones now used by\n\nmost authors.\n\nNonetheless, Witt’s notation for the infinite groups has certain\n\nadvantages when used in conjunction with the Cartan symbols for the\n\nfinite groups. First, each spherical or Euclidean group generated by\n\n_n_ reflections has a simple literal symbol, with subscript _n_. Second, it\nmakes possible a notation for _hyperbolic_ groups generated by _n_ \\+ 1\n\nreflections analogous to the extended Cartan symbols for Euclidean\n\ngroups generated by _n_ \\+ 1 reflections.\n\nEach Euclidean group belonging to one of the families (12.5.5),\n\n(12.5.8), (12.5.6), and (12.5.7) has a _Witt symbol_ as follows (Cox-\n\neter 1948, p. 194):\n\n12.6 Other Notations\n\n297\n\n**W** ∼\n\n∼\n\n2 = [∞],\n\n**P** _n_ = [3[ _n_]] ( _n_ ≥ 3),\n\n**Q** ∼\n\n∼\n\n4 = [3[4]],\n\n**Q** _n_ = [31,1, 3 _n_ −5, 31,1] ( _n_ ≥ 5),\n\n(12.6.1)\n\n**R** ∼\n\n∼\n\n3 = [4, 4],\n\n**R** _n_ = [4, 3 _n_ −3, 4] ( _n_ ≥ 4),\n\n**S** ∼\n\n∼\n\n3 = [41,1],\n\n**S** _n_ = [4, 3 _n_ −4, 31,1] ( _n_ ≥ 3).\n\nThere are also the five exceptional groups\n\n**T** ∼\n\n∼\n\n∼\n\n7 = [32, 2, 2],\n\n**T** 8 = [33, 3, 1],\n\n**T** 9 = [35, 2, 1],\n\n**U** ∼\n\n5 = [3, 3, 4, 3],\n\n(12.6.2)\n\n**V** ∼\n\n3 = [3, 6].\n\nWe shall regard these as useful alternatives to the extended Cartan\n\nsymbols employed in the preceding section.\n\nEach hyperbolic Coxeter group is an extension of one or another\n\nspherical or Euclidean group and has an appropriate “extended” Witt\n\nsymbol. In order to distinguish different extensions of the same spher-\n\nical or Euclidean group, synonyms are used for the names of a few\n\ngroups.

The branch is unmarked if the period\n\nis 3 and is marked ‘ _p_ ’ if the period _p_ is greater than 3. Witt (1941, p.\n301) proposed the substitution of a ( _p_ − 2)-tuple branch for a\n\nbranch marked ‘ _p_ ’. Thus a single branch would indicate a period of\n\n3, a double branch a period of 4, a triple branch a period of 5, and\n\nso on.\n\nA still neater version of this scheme, especially well suited to\n\nthe representation of simple Lie groups and crystallographic Coxeter\n\ngroups, was devised by E. B. Dynkin (1946, p. 349). In independently\n\ninventing what is now often called the _Coxeter-Dynkin diagram_ ,\n\nDynkin used single, double, and triple branches to denote periods of\n\n3, 4, and 6. The general rule is that two nodes are joined by a branch\n\nof multiplicity 4 cos2 π _/p_ = 4 − _σ_( _p_), where _p_ is the period of the\nproduct of the generators and _σ_( _p_) = 4 sin2 π _/p_ is the Schläflian\n(11.5.2) of the group [ _p_]. Nodes corresponding to parallel mirrors\n\n( _p_ = ∞) are joined by a quadruple branch. Any other value of _p_\n\nis indicated by a branch marked ‘ _p_ ’, as in the equivalent Coxeter\n\ndiagram.\n\n13\n\nH Y P E R B O L I C C OX E T E R G RO U P S\n\nThe fundamental region for an irreducible spherical or Euclidean\n\nCoxeter group is the closure of a simplex all of whose dihedral angles\n\nare submultiples of π.

As first\n\nshown by Poincaré, the infinitely many such groups that operate in\n\nthe hyperbolic plane have important applications to complex analysis.\n\nNumerous subgroup relationships hold between hyperbolic Coxeter\n\ngroups; some of these are quite remarkable.

If _p_ = _q_ =\n_r > _ 2, the group is denoted more concisely by [ _p_[3]]. The triangle ( _p\nq_ 2) is an orthoscheme (right triangle) with Coxeter diagram\n\nand the group is denoted by [ _p_ , _q_] or [ _q_ , _p_].\n\nThe group [( _p_ , _q_ , _r_)] is spherical, Euclidean, or hyperbolic\naccording as the sum of the angles of the triangle ( _p q r_) is greater than,\n\nequal to, or less than π, i.e., according as _p_ −1 + _q_ −1 + _r_ −1 − 1 is\npositive, zero, or negative. As we have seen, the only spherical groups are\n\nthe orthorectangular group [2, 2], the full ortho- _p_ -gonal groups [2, _p_]\n\n( _p_ ≥ 3), and the full polyhedral groups [3, 3], [3, 4], and [3, 5]. The\n\nonly Euclidean groups are the full ortho-apeiral group [2, ∞] and the\n\nfull apeirohedral groups [3[3]], [4, 4], and [3, 6].\n\nAll other groups [( _p_ , _q_ , _r_)] with _p_ , _q_ , and _r_ finite are\ngenerated by reflections in the sides of an ordinary hyperbolic triangle ( _p\nq r_).\n\nWe may also consider groups whose fundamental regions are _asymp-_\n\n_totic_(or “ideal”) triangles, with one, two, or all three vertices being\n\nabsolute points, or “cusps.” Groups [( _p_ , _q_ , ∞)] ( _pq > p _\\+ _q_), [(\n_p_ , ∞,\n\n∞)] ( _p_ ≥ 2), and [∞[3]] are generated by reflections in the sides\n\nof unicuspal, bicuspal, or tricuspal (i.e., “singly,” “doubly,” or “tre-\n\nbly” asymptotic) triangles ( _p q_ ∞), ( _p_ ∞ ∞), and (∞ ∞ ∞). We\n\nnote especially the groups [ _p_ , _q_] with _pq > _ 2( _p_ \\+ _q_), [ _p_ ,\n∞] with _p > _ 2, and [∞, ∞], which are the symmetry groups of regular\n\ntessellations of the hyperbolic plane.

A finitary group is also\n\nsaid to be “of finite covolume.” If in addition each subgroup gen-\n\nerated by _n_ − 1 of the reflections is spherical, we say that _W_ is\n\n_compact_(cf. Humphreys 1990, pp. 138–144). If _W_ is finitary and if\n\neach subgroup generated by _n_ − 1 of the reflections is either spher-\n\nical or Euclidean, including at least one of the latter, we say that\n\n_W_ is _paracompact_. If _W_ is finitary but at least one subgroup generated\nby _n_ − 1 of the reflections is hyperbolic, we say that _W_ is\n\n_hypercompact_.\n\n13.2 Compact Hyperbolic Groups\n\n305\n\nA hyperbolic group generated by _n_ reflections in the facets of a\n\nconvex polytope P is compact if P is an ordinary simplex, paracompact\n\nif P is an asymptotic simplex, or hypercompact if P is not a simplex.\n\nWe distinguish the three cases by calling P a _Lannér simplex_ , a _Koszul_\n\n_simplex_ , or a _Vinberg polytope_. Compact hyperbolic groups exist only\n\nfor _n_ ≤ 5 and paracompact groups only for _n_ ≤ 10. There are 9\n\ncompact and 23 paracompact hyperbolic groups generated by four\n\nreflections, 5 compact and 9 paracompact groups generated by five\n\nreflections, 12 paracompact groups generated by six reflections, 3 by\n\nseven reflections, 4 by eight reflections, 4 by nine reflections, and 3 by\n\nten reflections (Lannér 1950, pp. 51–56; Coxeter & Whitrow 1950, pp.\n\n430–431; Koszul 1968; Chein 1969; cf.

For\n\n_m_ ≥ 5 there are no discrete groups generated by reflections in the\n\nfacets of an ordinary simplex in H _m_.\n\nAs with direct products of Euclidean groups, hyperbolic Coxeter\n\ngroups may be generated by reflections in the facets of simplicial\n\nprisms (Kaplinskaya 1974; Esselmann 1996), but many other combi-\n\nnatorial types are possible. However, as the number of dimensions\n\n308\n\nHyperbolic Coxeter Groups\n\nincreases, fewer and fewer polytopes whose dihedral angles are sub-\n\nmultiples of π will fit in hyperbolic space. Coxeter groups with\n\nbounded fundamental regions are known to exist in H _m_ for _m_ ≤ 8\n\nand are known not to exist for _m_ ≥ 30 (Vinberg 1984). Other finitary\n\ngroups are known to exist for _m_ ≤ 21; there are no finitary groups in\n\nH _m_ for _m_ sufficiently large (Prokhorov 1986). Fuller descriptions of\nhyperbolic reflection groups are given by Vinberg (1985) and Vinberg\n\n& Shvartsman (1988, chaps. 5–6).\n\nIm Hof (1985, 1990) has enumerated all Coxeter groups defined by\n\nsimplexes or simplexes truncated by one or two hyperplanes whose\n\nfacets can be serially or cyclically ordered so that any two nonadja-\n\ncent ones are orthogonal. Groups of this kind exist in H _m_ for _m_ ≤ 9.\n\nRuth Kellerhals (1989, pp. 550–568; 1991, pp. 206–210) has calculated\n\nthe content of the fundamental regions of some of them. The sizes of\n\nother Lannér and Koszul simplexes have been determined by Keller-\n\nhals (1992, 1995), Ratcliffe & Tschantz (1997, pp. 64–68), and Johnson,\n\nKellerhals, Ratcliffe & Tschantz (1999).\n\nEXERCISES 13.2\n\n**1.** The dihedral angle of a Euclidean dodecahedron {5, 3} is π − tan−1 2,\n\nabout 116◦34.

It follows that, in addition to the thirty-two\n\ncompact and paracompact Coxeter groups generated by four reflec-\n\ntions in H3, there are infinitely many other discrete groups generated\n\nby more than four reflections.\n\n13.4 Paracompact Groups in H4 and H5\n\n313\n\nIn one essential respect, however, such hypercompact Coxeter\n\ngroups in a hyperbolic space of three or more dimensions differ\n\nfrom their counterparts in H2. Two hyperbolic _n_ -gons ( _n > _ 3) hav-\n\ning the same angles, in the same cyclic order, may have sides of\n\ndifferent lengths and so need not be congruent. But the shape of\n\na convex hyperbolic polyhedron or higher-dimensional polytope is\n\ncompletely determined by its dihedral angles. This fact is usually\n\ncalled the Mostow Rigidity Theorem (Mostow 1968; cf. Vinberg &\n\nShvartsman 1988, chap. 7, § 1; Ratcliffe 1994/2006, § 11.8).

An\n\ninteger of norm 1 is a _unit_. In a _basic system_ of integers, the units span\na 1-, 2-, 4-, or 8-dimensional lattice. Each of the three basic systems\n\nof integral quaternions defines a modular group of linear fractional\n\ntransformations corresponding to a subgroup of a Coxeter group oper-\n\nating in H5, as well as a “pseudo-modular” group of transformations\n\ncorresponding to isometries of H4. While there are no linear fractional\n\ntransformations or modular groups over nonassociative subrings of\n\nO, each of the four basic systems of integral octonions defines an\n\n_octonionic modular loop_.\n\n15.1\n\nINTEGRAL QUATERNIONS\n\nThe division ring H of quatemions was discovered in 1843 by William\n\nRowan Hamilton. In 1856, at the instigation of his friend John\n\nGraves, Hamilton devised a system of quaternionic integers, but his\n\nnotes remained unpublished for more than a century before being\n\nappended to his _Mathematical Papers_(Hamilton 1967). An extensive\n\ntheory along the same lines was subsequently developed by Rudolph\n\nLipschitz (1886). Whereas both Hamilton and Lipschitz defined an\n\nintegral quaternion as one whose components are rational integers,\n\n349\n\n350\n\nQuaternionic Modular Groups\n\nAdolf Hurwitz (1896) constructed a system with nicer arithmetic prop-\n\nerties by allowing the components to be either all integers or all halves\n\nof odd integers.\n\nIn defining a _basic system_ of quadratic integral quaternions, a rea-\n\nsonable approach is to require (1) that each element be a zero of a\n\nmonic quadratic polynomial with coefficients in Z, (2) that the ele-\n\nments form a subring of H with the units forming a subgroup of the\n\ngroup SL(H) of unit quaternions, and (3) that when H is taken as a\n\nfour-dimensional vector space over R, the elements are the points of\n\na four-dimensional lattice spanned by the units. As we shall see, there\n\nare exactly three such systems.\n\nThe first condition is satisfied by any quaternion q = _q_ 0 + _q_ 1i +\n\n_q_\n\n2\n\n2j + _q_ 3k such that _q_ 0 is an integer or half an odd integer and _q_ 0\n\n+\n\n_q_ 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1 + _q_ 2 + _q_ 3\n\nis an integer (Dickson 1923b p. 111).\n\nDu Val (1964, pp. 49–54) described all the finite groups of quater-\n\nnions, which operate as four-dimensional rotation groups. Abstractly,\n\nsuch a group is either a cyclic group C _p_ , of order _p_( _p_ ≥ 1), or an\nextension of one of the _polyhedral_ groups ( _p_ , _q_ , 2) ∼\n\n= [ _p_ , _q_]+,\n\nwhich are the rotation groups of the regular polyhedra { _p_ , _q_} and the\nright prisms { _p_} × {}. The _binary polyhedral_ group (( _p_ , _q_ , 2)), of\norder 8 _pq/_(2 _p_ \\+ 2 _q_ − _pq_), is defined by the relations\n\n_σ p_\n\n_q_\n\n2\n\n1\n\n= _σ_ 2 = _σ_ 3 = _σ_ 1 _σ_ 2 _σ_ 3,\n\n(15.1.1)\n\nwhere _p_ ≥ 2, _q_ ≥ 2, and _pq < _ 2( _p_ \\+ _q_) (Coxeter & Moser 1957, pp.\n67–69). The center of (( _p_ , _q_ , 2)) is the group 2 generated by _ζ_ =\n\n_σ_ 1 _σ_ 2 _σ_ 3, and the central quotient group (( _p_ , _q_ , 2)) _/_ 2 is\n( _p_ , _q_ , 2). The actual cases are the _binary dihedral_(or “dicyclic”)\ngroups (( _p_ , 2, 2)) ∼\n\n=\n\n2D\n\n∼\n\n_p_( _p_ ≥ 2), the _binary tetrahedral_ group ((3, 3, 2)) ∼\n\n= 2A4 = SL2(F3),\n\nthe _binary octahedral_ group ((4, 3, 2)) ∼\n\n= 2S4, and the _binary icosahe-_\n\n_dral_ group ((5, 3, 2)) ∼\n\n= 2A ∼\n\n5 = SL2(F5), of respective orders 4 _p_ , 24, 48,\n\nand 120 (Coxeter 1974 pp. 74–80; cf. Conway & Smith 2003 p. 33).\n\nAs a subgroup of SL(H), C _p_ is a two-dimensional rotation group\n\ngenerated by a single quaternion in the conjugacy class of cos 2 _π/p_ +\n\n15.1 Integral Quaternions\n\n351\n\ni sin 2 _π/p_. The group 2D _p_ , generators for which are cos _π/p_ \\+ i sin\n_π/p_ and j, contains C2 _p_ as a subgroup of index 2. When _p_ = 2, this is\nthe _Hamilton group_ generated by i and j, whose eight elements are\n\n±1, ±i, ±j, ±k.\n\nWhen _p_ = 3, it is a “hybrid” group of order 12 generated by the\n\n√\n\nquaternions _ω_ = −½ + ½ 3i (of period 3) and j (of period 4).\n\nAlthough every binary dihedral group 2D _p_ can be extended to a\n\nquaternion ring, the ring elements are the points of a four-dimensional\n\nlattice only when _p_ equals 2 or 3.\n\nThe binary tetrahedral group 2A4 contains 2D2 as subgroup of\n\nindex 3. As a subgroup of SL(H), it is the _Hurwitz group_ , generated\n\nby the quaternions\n\n_u_ = 1 − 1 i − 1 j + 1 k and _v_ = 1 + 1 i − 1 j − 1 k\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(both of period 6), consisting of the eight Hamilton units together with\n\nthe sixteen additional elements\n\n±1 ± 1i ± 1j ± 1k.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThe group 2A4 is a subgroup of index 2 in 2S4 and a subgroup of index\n\n5 in 2A5. As a subgroup of SL(H), the binary octahedral group 2S4 is\n\n√\n\n√\n\nthe _octian group_ , generated by _u_ , _v_ , and _η_ = ½ 2+½ 2i (of period\n8), consisting of the twenty-four Hurwitz units together with twenty-four\n\nothers obtained by multiplying each of them by _η_ , i.e., quaternions\n\n√\n\n√\n\nwhose coordinates are permutations of (±½ 2, ±½ 2, 0, 0). Like-\n\nwise, the binary icosahedral group 2A5 is the _icosian group_(cf.\n\nConway & Sloane 1988, pp. 207–210), which consists of the twenty-\n\nfour Hurwitz units and ninety-six others (each of period 5) whose\n\ncoordinates are even permutations of (±½τ, ±½¯τ, ±½, 0), where\n\n√\n\n√\n\nτ = ½( 5 + 1) and ¯τ = ½( 5 − 1).\n\nJohnson & Weiss (1999b, pp. 167–168) proved that the only basic\n\nsystems of quadratic integral quaternions are the rings associated with\n\nthe binary dihedral groups 2D2 and 2D3 and the binary tetrahedral\n\n352\n\nQuaternionic Modular Groups\n\ngroup 2A4. The lattice of _Hamilton integers_ Ham = H22 = Z[i, j]\n\nderived from the Hamilton group 2D2 is spanned by the four unit\n\nquaternions 1, i, j, and k = ij. The lattice of _hybrid integers_ Hyb =\n\nH32 = Z[ _ω_ , j] derived from the hybrid group 2D3 is spanned by 1, _ω_ , j,\nand _ω_ j. The lattice of _Hurwitz integers_ Hur = H33 = Z[ _u_ , _v_] derived\nfrom the Hurwitz group 2A4 is spanned by 1, _u_ , _v_ , and _w_ = ( _uv_)−1.\nAll three systems are of interest; there is no need to decide which is the\n\n“best.”\n\nCorresponding to the occurrence of 2D2 as a subgroup of 2A4,\n\nHam is a subring of Hur, so that Ham is not a “maximal” system.\n\nAlthough neither the ring H43 of octians nor the ring H53 of icosians\n\nhas a representation as a four-dimensional lattice, both can be realized\n\nas lattices in R8. As quaternion rings, H43 and H53 both contain Ham\n\nand Hur as subrings.\n\nAs points of Euclidean 4-space, the elements of Ham are the ver-\n\ntices of the regular honeycomb {4, 3, 3, 4} of tesseracts {4, 3, 3}. The\n\nelements of Hur are the vertices of the regular honeycomb {3, 3, 4, 3}\n\nof 16-cells {3, 3, 4}. The elements of Hyb are the vertices of a uniform\n\nhoneycomb {3, 6} × {3, 6}, all of whose cellular polychora are double\n\nprisms {3} × {3}.\n\nThe rings Ham and Hur of Hamilton and Hurwitz integers may be\n\nregarded as quaternionic analogues of the rings G and E of Gaussian\n\nand Eisenstein integers. The subrings Z[i], Z[j], and Z[k] of either are\n\nisomorphic to G, and the subrings Z[ _u_], Z[ _v_], and Z[ _w_] of Hur are\nisomorphic to E. The ring Hyb of hybrid integers has a subring Z[ _ω_]\n\nisomorphic to E and subrings Z[j], Z[ _ω_ j], and Z[ _ω_ 2j] isomorphic to\n\nG.\n\nThe elements of Ham are the quaternions g = _g_ 0 + _g_ 1i + _g_ 2j + _g_ 3k,\nwhere i, j, and k satisfy Hamilton’s relations\n\ni2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1\n\n(15.1.2)\n\nand ( _g_ 0, _g_ 1, _g_ 2, _g_ 3) ∈ Z4.

In most cases these are subgroups\n\nof the symmetry group of some regular honeycomb.\n\nThe rational modular group is the rotation group of the regular\n\ntessellation {3, ∞} of the hyperbolic plane H2:\n\nPSL2(Z) ∼\n\n= [3, ∞]+\n\n(15.6.1)\n\nThree semiquadratic modular groups are likewise the rotation groups\n\nof other regular hyperbolic tessellations:\n\n√\n\nPSL1+1(Z[ 2]) ∼\n\n= [4, ∞]+,\n\nPSL1+1(Z[τ]) ∼\n\n= [5, ∞]+,\n\n(15.6.2)\n\n√\n\nPSL1+1(Z[ 3]) ∼\n\n= [6, ∞]+.\n\nThe Gaussian modular (Picard) group and the Eisenstein modular\n\ngroup are subgroups of the rotation groups of the regular cellulations\n\n{3, 4, 4} and {3, 3, 6} of hyperbolic 3-space:\n\n15.6 Summary of Modular Groups\n\n377\n\nPSL2(G) ∼\n\n= [3, 4, 1+, 4]+,\n\n(15.6.3)\n\nPSL2(E) ∼\n\n= [(3, 3)+, 6, 1+].\n\nThe Hamilton and Hurwitz pseudo-modular groups are subgroups\n\nof the rotation group of the regular honeycomb {3, 4, 3, 4} of hyper-\n\nbolic 4-space, and the hybrid pseudo-modular group is a subgroup of\n\na hypercompact Coxeter group also operating in H4:\n\nPS∗L2(Ham) ∼\n\n= [3, 4, 3∗, 4]+,\n\nPS∗L2(Hur) ∼\n\n= [3, 4, 3+, 4]+,\n\n(15.6.4)\n\nPS∗L2(Hyb) ∼\n\n= [∞, 3, 3, 3, 6, 1+]+.\n\nThe Hamilton and Hurwitz modular groups are subgroups of the rota-\n\ntion groups of the regular honeycombs {3, 4, 3, 3, 4} and {3, 3, 3, 4, 3}\n\nof hyperbolic 5-space, and the hybrid modular group is an exten-\n\nsion of the commutator subgroup of a hypercompact Coxeter group\n\noperating in H5:\n\nPSL2(Ham) ∼\n\n= [3, 4, (3, 3), 4]+,\n\nPSL2(Hur) ∼\n\n= [(3, 3, 3)+, 4, 3+],\n\n(15.6.5)\n\nPSL2(Hyb) ∼\n\n= 4[1+, 6, (3, 3, 3, 3)+, 6, 1+].\n\nConnections between hyperbolic isometries (or Möbius trans-\n\nformations) and real, complex, or quaternionic linear fractional\n\ntransformations have been established by numerous authors. Rele-\n\nvant citations include Klein (1879) Poincaré (1882), Picard (1884),\n\nBianchi (1891, 1892), Fricke & Klein (1897) Vahlen (1902),\n\nAhlfors (1985), Maclachlan, Waterman & Wielenberg (1989) Water-\n\nman (1993), Wilker (1993), Schulte & Weiss (1994), and Monson\n\n& Weiss (1995, 1997). More details can be found in Johnson &\n\nWeiss 1999a,b and in Feingold, Kleinschmidt & Nicolai 2009.\n\nHaving described the real, complex, and quaternionic cases, it\n\nwould be natural to expect to continue with the octonions. As we\n\nshall see in the next section, there is no difficulty in defining systems\n\nof octonionic integers and interpreting them geometrically. However,\n\n378\n\nQuaternionic Modular Groups\n\nsince any real division algebra of more than four dimensions is\n\nnonassociative, the notions of linear fractional transformations and\n\nmodular groups cannot be extended. (It may not be entirely coinci-\n\ndental that regular hyperbolic honeycombs exist only in spaces of two,\n\nthree, four, and five dimensions.)\n\n15.7\n\nINTEGRAL OCTONIONS\n\nThe alternative division ring O of octonions is an eight-dimensional\n\nvector space over the real numbers. Systems of octonions analo-\n\ngous to the rational integers Z; the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers\n\nG = Z[i] and E = Z[ _ω_]; and the Hamilton, Hurwitz, and hybrid\n\nintegers Ham, Hur, and Hyb have been investigated by L. E. Dick-\n\nson (1923a,b) and others, e.g., Coxeter (1946) and Conway & Smith\n\n(2003, chap. 9).\n\nAs with complex numbers and quaternions, each octonion\n\n**x** = _x_ 0 + _x_ 1e1 + _x_ 2e2 + _x_ 3e3 + _x_ 4e4 + _x_ 5e5 + _x_ 6e6 +\n_x_ 7e7\n\nhas a _conjugate_\n\n˜**x** = _x_ 0 − _x_ 1e1 − _x_ 2e2 − _x_ 3e3 − _x_ 4e4 − _x_ 5e5 − _x_ 6e6 −\n_x_ 7e7, in terms of which we can define its _trace_ tr **x** = **x** \\+\n˜**x** = 2 _x_ 0 and _norm N_(**x**) = **x** ˜**x** = _x_ 2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n\\+ · · · + _x_ 7 , both of which are real. Traces\n\nare additive and norms multiplicative, i.e., tr (**x** \\+ **y**) = tr **x** \\+\ntr **y** and _N_(**xy**) = _N_(**x**) · _N_(**y**). Just as every real number\n_a_ satisfies a quadratic equation _x_ 2 − 2 _ax_ \\+ _a_ 2 = 0, every octonion\n**a** satisfies a “rank equation” **x** 2 − (**a** \\+ ˜**a**) **x** \\+ **a**\n˜**a** = 0. (Similar definitions apply and corresponding equations hold for\ncomplex numbers and quaternions.)\n\nThe nonzero octonions under multiplication form a _Moufang loop_\n\nGM(O), alternative but not associative.\n\n**A.** _Cayley-Graves integers_. According to Dickson (1923b, pp. 141–\n\n142), a set of complex, quaternionic, or octonionic integers should\n\n15.7 Integral Octonions\n\n379\n\nhave the following properties: (1) for each number in the set, the\n\ncoefficients of its rank equation are rational integers, (2) the set is\n\nclosed under subtraction and multiplication, and (3) the set contains\n\n1\\. Restating the first property and imposing somewhat stricter con-\n\nditions in place of the last two, consistent with the definition given\n\nin § 15.1, we shall adopt the following criteria for a _basic system_ of\n\nintegral elements:\n\n(1) the trace and the norm of each element are rational integers;\n\n(2) the elements form a subring of C, H, or O with a set of invertible\n\nunits (elements of norm 1) closed under multiplication;\n\n(3) when C, H, or O is taken as a vector space over R, the ele-\n\nments are the points of a two-, four-, or eight-dimensional lattice\n\nspanned by the units.\n\nDickson also demands of a set of integers that it be _maximal_ , not\n\na subset of a larger set meeting the other criteria. Though a maximal\n\nsystem like Hur may have desirable properties that an extendable sys-\n\ntem like Ham lacks, we do not make this a requirement: basic systems\n\nmay or may not be maximal.\n\nUp to isomorphism, there are exactly four basic systems of\n\noctonionic integers (Johnson 2013, pp. 58–59). The simplest system\n\nconsists of all octonions\n\n**g** = _g_ 0 + _g_ 1e1 + _g_ 2e2 + _g_ 3e3 + _g_ 4e4 + _g_ 5e5 + _g_ 6e6 +\n_g_ 7e7\n\nwhose eight components _gi_ are rational integers. Geometrically these\n\nare the points of an eight-dimensional lattice C8, the vertices of a reg-\n\nular honeycomb {4, 36, 4} of Euclidean 8-space E8. In honor of John\n\nGraves, who discovered the octonions—or “octaves,” as he called\n\nthem—in 1843, and Arthur Cayley, who rediscovered them in 1845,\n\nwe denote this system by Ocg and call its elements the _Cayley-Graves_\n\n_integers_ or, following Conway & Smith (2003, p. 100), the _Gravesian_\n\n_octaves_. There are sixteen units, namely,\n\n380\n\nQuaternionic Modular Groups\n\n± 1, ±e1, ±e2, ±e3, ±e4, ±e5, ±e6, ±e7,\n\n(15.7.1)\n\nwith the following nonassociative multiplication table.\n\ne1\n\ne2\n\ne3\n\ne4\n\ne5\n\ne6\n\ne7\n\ne1\n\n−1\n\ne4\n\ne7\n\n−e2\n\ne6\n\n−e5\n\n−e3\n\ne2\n\n−e4\n\n−1\n\ne5\n\ne1\n\n−e3\n\ne7\n\n−e6\n\ne3\n\n−e7\n\n−e5\n\n−1\n\ne6\n\ne2\n\n−e4\n\ne1\n\ne4\n\ne2\n\n−e1\n\n−e6\n\n−1\n\ne7\n\ne3\n\n−e5\n\ne5\n\n−e6\n\ne3\n\n−e2\n\n−e7\n\n−1\n\ne1\n\ne4\n\ne6\n\ne5\n\n−e7\n\ne4\n\n−e3\n\n−e1\n\n−1\n\ne2\n\ne7\n\ne3\n\ne6\n\n−e1\n\ne5\n\n−e4\n\n−e2\n\n−1\n\n**B.** _Coxeter-Dickson integers_. With all their coordinates in Z,\n\nthe system Ocg of Gravesian octaves is the analogue in O of the\n\ncommutative ring G of Gaussian integers in C and the noncommu-\n\ntative ring Ham of Hamilton integers in H. As we saw in §15.1, the\n\nHurwitz integers Hur can be obtained from Ham by adjoining quater-\n\nnions with coordinates in Z + ½. Something similar can be done to\n\nextend the Cayley-Graves integers to a larger system.\n\nDickson (1923a, pp. 319–325) showed that certain sets of octonions\n\nhaving all eight coordinates in Z, four in Z and four in Z + ½, or\n\nall eight in Z + ½ form a system of octonionic integers. In fact, he\n\nobtained three such systems, each containing all the octonions with all\n\ncoordinates in Z and some of the ones with all or half their coordi-\n\nnates in Z + ½. But this is not the whole story. Coxeter (1946) found\n\nthat there are actually _seven_ of these systems, one corresponding to\n\neach of the unit octonions e1, _. . ._ , e7. Each system has 240 units, con-\n\nsisting of the 16 Gravesian units and 224 others having coordinates\n\nof the type (±½, ±½, ±½, ±½, 0, 0, 0, 0). Of these 128 are unique to a\n\nparticular system, and three sets of 32 are each shared with two other\n\nsystems.\n\n15.7 Integral Octonions\n\n381\n\nWe shall denote any of these seven systems by Ocd and call\n\nits elements the _Coxeter-Dickson integers_ or the _Dicksonian octaves_ ; the\nsystems can be distinguished as Ocd(1), _. . ._ , Ocd(7). Conway &\n\nSmith (2003, pp. 100–105) call the seven systems “octavian rings,”\n\none of which they single out as the “octavian integers.” The elements\n\nof any one system are the points of a _Gosset lattice_ E8, the vertices\n\nof a uniform honeycomb 521 of Euclidean 8-space E8, the symmetry\n\ngroup of which is the Coxeter group ˜\n\n**E** ∼\n\n8 = [35,2,1]. The cellular poly-\n\ntopes of 521 are simplexes _α_ 8 and orthoplexes _β_ 8, and its vertex figure\nis the uniform polytope 421, which has 240 vertices (Coxeter 1946,\n\n§§ 8–9).\n\nThe identity 1 and any of the Gravesian units e _i_ span a two-\n\ndimensional sublattice C2 whose points are the vertices of a regular\n\ntessellation {4, 4} of E2. The points of each such lattice correspond to\n\nthe elements of a ring G of Gaussian integers. Each of these rings is\n\na subring of the system Ocg of Gravesian octaves and hence also of\n\neach of the seven systems Ocd( _i_) of Dicksonian octaves.\n\n**C.** _Coupled Hurwitz integers_. The octonions satisfy the alterna-\n\ntive laws ( _aa_) _b_ = _a_( _ab_) and ( _ab_) _b_ = _a_( _bb_) but are not\ngenerally associative. Together with the identity element 1, any of the seven\n\nsets of Gravesian units e _i_ , e _j_ , and e _k_ that form an associative\ntriple, so that (e _i_ e _j_)e _k_ = e _i_(e _j_ e _k_), span a four-\ndimensional lattice C4 whose points correspond to a ring Ham( _ijk_) of\nHamilton integers. By adjoining points with coordinates in Z+½, each such\nlattice can be extended\n\nto a lattice D4 whose points correspond to a ring Hur( _ijk_) of Hurwitz\n\nintegers. The four complementary Gravesian units span another four-\n\ndimensional lattice C4, orthogonal to the first, which can likewise be\n\nextended to a lattice D4.\n\nThe two orthogonal D4 lattices span an eight-dimensional lat-\n\ntice D4 ⊕ D4 whose points are the vertices of a uniform prismatic\n\nhoneycomb\n\n{3, 3, 4, 3} × {3, 3, 4, 3}\n\n382\n\nQuaternionic Modular Groups\n\nof E8. The cellular polytopes of this honeycomb are hexadecachoric\n\n(16-cell) double prisms {3, 3, 4} × {3, 3, 4}. As octonions, the lattice\n\npoints constitute a system Och of _coupled Hurwitz integers_ or _Hur-_\n\n_witzian octaves_ ; Conway & Smith (2003, pp. 101–103) call this a\n\n“double Hurwitzian” system. There are forty-eight units, consisting\n\nof the sixteen Gravesian units and thirty-two others having coordi-\n\nnates 0, _i_ , _j_ , and _k_ equal to ±½ and the other four equal to 0 or vice\nversa. Since there are seven choices for _i_ , _j_ , and _k_ , there are seven\nsuch systems, namely,\n\nOch(124), Och(235), Och(346), O(457), Och(561),\n\nOch(672), Och(713).\n\nEach system Och( _ijk_) of Hurwitzian octaves is a subring of three\n\nsystems Ocd( _i_), Ocd( _j_), and Ocd( _k_) of Dicksonian octaves.\n\nThe intersection of all seven systems of Dicksonian octaves (or any\n\ntwo systems of Hurwitzian octaves), which Conway & Smith (2003,\n\np. 103) call the “Kleinian octaves,” is not a basic system of integral\n\noctonions, since the corresponding eight-dimensional lattice is not\n\nspanned by the common units. Nor is their union, whose units are not\n\nclosed under multiplication.\n\nTo bring out the connection with the complex numbers and\n\nthe quaternions, we may follow Dickson and denote the Gravesian\n\nunits by\n\n1,\n\ni,\n\nj,\n\nk,\n\ne,\n\nie,\n\nje,\n\nke\n\n(15.7.2)\n\nand their negatives. This notation can be related to the one we have\n\nbeen using by setting i = e1, j = e2, e = e3, k = e4, je = e5,\n\nke = −e6, ie = e7. Thus i, j, and k = ij form an associative triple.\n\nCoxeter (1946, § 5) also finds it useful to define h = ½(i + j + k + e).\n\nA group ¯SL(G) ∼\n\n= {±1, ±i} of Gaussian units is generated by i. A\n\ngroup SL(Ham) ∼\n\n= {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} of Hamilton units is generated by\n\ni and j. The analogous Moufang loop SM(Ocg) of Gravesian units,\n\nof order 16, is generated by i, j, and e. The Moufang loop SM(Ocd)\n\n15.7 Integral Octonions\n\n383\n\nof Dicksonian units, of order 240, is generated by i, j, and h, with the\n\nlattice E8 being spanned by the units\n\n1,\n\ni,\n\nj,\n\nk,\n\nh,\n\nih,\n\njh,\n\nkh.\n\n(15.7.3)\n\nLet the unit octonions u, v, and w = (uv)−1 be defined by\n\nu = 1 − 1 i − 1 j + 1 k,\n\nv = 1 + 1 i − 1 j − 1 k,\n\nw = 1 − 1 i + 1 j − 1 k.\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nThen a group ¯SL(E) ∼\n\n= {±1, ±u, ±u2} of Eisenstein units is generated\n\nby u. A group SL(Hur) ∼\n\n= 2A4 of Hurwitz units, of order 24, is gener-\n\nated by u and v. When the division algebra O of octonions is taken as a\n\nvector space over R, the lattice D4 ⊕ D4 of the ring Och of Hurwitzian\n\noctaves is spanned by the unit octonions\n\n1,\n\nu,\n\nv,\n\nw,\n\ne,\n\nue,\n\nve,\n\nwe.\n\n(15.7.4)\n\nThe Moufang loop SM(Och) of Hurwitzian units, of order 48, is\n\ngenerated by u, v, and e.\n\n**D.** _Compound Eisenstein integers_.

The\n\npoints of the lattice are the vertices of a regular tessellation {3, 6} of the\n\nEuclidean plane E2. The group ¯SL(E) ∼\n\n= {±1, ± _ω_ , ± _ω_ 2} of Eisenstein\n\nunits is generated by − _ω_ or − _ω_ 2\\.\n\nWhen the division ring H of quaternions is taken as a vector space\n\nover R, the ring Hyb of hybrid integers is a four-dimensional lattice\n\n√\n\nA2 ⊕ A2 spanned by 1, _ω_ , j, and _ω_ j, where _ω_ = −½ + ½ 3i and\n\n√\n\n_ω_ j = −½j + ½ 3k. The points of the lattice are the vertices of a\n\nuniform prismatic honeycomb {3, 6} × {3, 6} of E4. The cellular poly-\n\nchora of {3, 6}×{3, 6} are triangular double prisms {3}×{3}. The group\n\nSL(Hyb) ∼\n\n= {±1, ± _ω_ , ± _ω_ 2, ±j, ± _ω_ j, ± _ω_ 2j} of hybrid units is generated by\n_ω_ and j.\n\n384\n\nQuaternionic Modular Groups\n\nThe lattice A2 ⊕ A2 is the direct sum of two sublattices A2, one\n\nspanned by 1 and _ω_ and the other by j and _ω_ j, the points of which\n\nrepresent the ring E of Eisenstein integers. Other pairings, e.g., 1 and\n\nj, span four sublattices C2 whose points correspond to the ring G of\n\nGaussian integers.\n\nThe quaternionic ring Hyb has an octonionic analogue, the system\n\nOce of _compound Eisenstein integers_ or _Eisenstein octaves_ , which can be\nrealized as an eight-dimensional lattice 4A2 = A2 ⊕ A2 ⊕ A2 ⊕ A2\n\nspanned by the unit octonions\n\n1,\n\n_ω_ , j, _ω_ j, e, _ω_ e, je, _ω_ j.e,\n\n(15.7.5)\n\n√\n\nwhere _ω_ = −½ + ½ 3i. The points of the lattice are the vertices of\n\na uniform honeycomb {3, 6}4 of Euclidean 8-space E8. The cellular\n\npolytopes of {3, 6}4 are triangular quadruple prisms {3}4.

Thus, corresponding to the seven\n\npossible triples, there are seven isomorphic systems\n\nOce(124), Oce(235), Oce(346), Oce(457), Oce(561),\n\nOce(672), Oce(713).\n\nIf we let g = ½(i − j + ie − je), then a group SL(Ham) ∼\n\n= 2D2 of\n\nHamilton units is generated by g and e, while a group SL(Hyb) ∼\n\n= 2D3\n\nof hybrid units is generated by u and g. The loop u, g, e is seen\n\nto be isomorphic to the Moufang loop SM(Oce) ∼\n\n= _ω_ , j, e by the\n\ncorrespondence −u ↔ _ω_ , g ↔ j, e ↔ e. Thus a loop of Eisenstein\n\nunits is also generated by u, g, and e, and it is evident that this is a\n\nsubloop of the loop SM(Ocd) of Dicksonian units.

These results are summarized in Table 15.7.\n\nTable 15.7 _Basic Systems of Integers_\n\nFamily\n\nBasic\n\nSymbol\n\nSystem\n\nUnits\n\nLattice\n\nHoneycomb\n\n_G_ 1\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nC1\n\n{∞}\n\n_G_ 2\n\nG\n\n4\n\nC2\n\n{4, 4}\n\nE2\n\nE\n\n6\n\nA2\n\n{3, 6}\n\n_G_ 4\n\nHam\n\n8\n\nC4\n\n{4, 3, 3, 4}\n\nE4\n\nHyb\n\n12\n\n2A2\n\n{3, 6}2\n\n_H_ 4\n\nHur\n\n24\n\nD4\n\n{3, 3, 4, 3}\n\n_G_ 8\n\nOcg\n\n16\n\nC8\n\n{4, 36, 4}\n\nE8\n\nOce\n\n24\n\n4A2\n\n{3, 6}4\n\n_H_ 8\n\nOch\n\n48\n\n2D4\n\n{3, 3, 4, 3}2\n\n_D_ 8\n\nOcd\n\n240\n\nE8\n\n{35, 32,1}\n\nSix of the ten basic systems are maximal and seven of them are\n\nminimal, containing no smaller basic system of the same dimension.\n\nThe lattice C4 being a sublattice of D4, the system Ham is a subsystem\n\nof Hur. Likewise, C8 = 2C4 is a sublattice of 2D4, which is a sub-\n\nlattice of E8; correspondingly, Ocg is a subsystem of Och, which is a\n\nsubsystem of Ocd. Moreover, 4A2 is a sublattice of E8, and Oce is a\n\nsubsystem of Ocd. These and other connections between the various\n\nsystems are described by Conway & Smith (2003, §10.4).\n\nEXERCISES 15.7\n\n**1.** What are the common units of the seven systems of Dicksonian octaves,\n\ni.e., the units of the “Kleinian octaves”?\n\n15.8 Octonionic Modular Loops\n\n387\n\n**2.** Show that the product of Hurwitzian octaves belonging to different\n\nsystems need not be an octonionic integer.\n\n**3.** Show that the unit octonions i, j, and h generate the 240 units of one\n\nsystem of Dicksonian octaves.\n\n15.8\n\nOCTONIONIC MODULAR LOOPS\n\nThe _Gravesian special Moufang_ loop SM2(Ocg) of invertible 2 × 2\n\nmatrices with entries in Ocg is generated by the matrices\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n_A_ =\n\n, _B_ =\n\n, _M_ =\n\n, _N_ =\n\n,\n\n−1 0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\ni\n\n0\n\nj\n\n1\n\n0\n\n_P_ =\n\n.\n\n0\n\ne\n\nIdentifying any such matrix with its negative, we obtain the _Gravesian_\n\n_modular loop_ PSM2(Ocg) ∼\n\n= SM2(Ocg) _/_ SZ2(Ocg), which is gener-\n\nated by the elements\n\n_α_ = · _A_ , _β_ = · _B_ , _μ_ = · _M_ , _v_ = · _N_ , _π_ = · _P_ .\n\nBecause octonionic multiplication is nonassociative, the elements\n\nof the loop PSM2(Ocg) cannot be treated as projective or linear\n\nfractional transformations.\n\nEach of the other three basic systems of integral octonions defines\n\nanalogous special Moufang and modular loops.

An expla-\n\nnation of the terminology and notation used in each table, with some\n\nadditional commentary, follows.\n\n**A.** _Real transformation groups_. Table A lists the principal groups\n\nof collineations of real projective, affine, and areplectic _n_ -space; cir-\n\ncularities of real inversive _n_ -space; and isometries and similarities of\n\nEuclidean _n_ -space and other real metric spaces. Each of these is an\n\nextension or a quotient group of the general linear group of invertible\n\nmatrices of order _n_ , _n_ \\+ 1, or _n_ \\+ 2, or one of its subgroups,\nincluding the symplectic, orthogonal, and pseudo-orthogonal groups described\n\nin Chapters 5 and 6. The translation group T _n_ is the additive group of\n\nthe vector space R _n_.\n\nFor _n_ equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, the projective and special projective\n\npseudoorthogonal groups PO _n_ ,1 and P+O _n_ ,1, which are the isometry\n\nand direct isometry groups of hyperbolic _n_ -space or the circularity and\n\nhomography groups of inversive ( _n_ − 1)-space, can be expressed as\n\nlinear or antilinear fractional transformations over R, C, or H, as given\n\nby (10.4.7).\n\n390\n\nTables\n\n391\n\n**B.** _Groups generated by reflections_. These are the Coxeter groups\n\nthat were described in Chapters 11, 12, and 13. Table B lists all\n\nirreducible spherical and Euclidean groups and all compact and para-\n\ncompact hyperbolic groups generated by reflections. The fundamental\n\nregion for such a group is the closure of a simplex whose dihedral\n\nangles are submultiples of π. For a group generated by _n_ reflections\n\nall of whose subgroups of rank _n_ −1 are spherical, this is a _Möbius, Car-_\n\n_tan_ , or _Lannér_ simplex according as the group is spherical, Euclidean, or\nhyperbolic; for a hyperbolic group some of whose subgroups are\n\nEuclidean, it is a _Koszul_ simplex, with one or more absolute vertices.\n\nEach group is identified by a numeric “Coxeter symbol” corre-\n\nsponding to its Coxeter diagram, as well as a literal _Cartan symbol_\n\nfor spherical and Euclidean groups or a _Witt symbol_ for Euclidean\n\nand hyperbolic groups. The ( _n_ − 1)-dimensional content of the funda-\n\nmental region is the _size_ of the group, to be discussed further below.\n\nA spherical group has a finite _order_ , and its _center_ is of order 2 or 1\n\ndepending on whether or not the group contains the central inversion.\n\nThe _Coxeter number h_ is the period of the product of the generators.\n\nThe _Schläflian σ_ , the determinant of the Schläfli matrix, is positive,\n\nzero, or negative according as the group is spherical, Euclidean, or\n\nhyperbolic; for a crystallographic group _σ_ is an integer.\n\nCorresponding to each finite irreducible crystallographic group\n\ngenerated by _n_ reflections is a simple Lie algebra with the same Car-\n\ntan symbol. If _h_ is the Coxeter number of the group, the algebra has\n\ndimension _n_( _h_ +1). In particular, the respective dimensions of the\nclassical Lie algebras _An_ , _Bn_ , _Cn_ , and _Dn_ are _n_( _n_ \\+ 2), _n_(2\n_n_ \\+ 1), _n_(2 _n_ \\+ 1), and _n_(2 _n_ − 1), while the exceptional Lie\nalgebras _G_ 2, _F_ 4, _E_ 6, _E_ 7, and _E_ 8 have dimensions 2(6 + 1) = 14,\n4(12 + 1) = 52, 6(12 + 1) = 78,\n\n7(18 + 1) = 133, and 8(30 + 1) = 248.\n\nThe size of a spherical group generated by _n_ reflections is inversely\n\nproportional to its order and can be calculated by dividing the content\n\nof the ( _n_ −1)-sphere S _n_ −1 by the order of the group. The size of the\ncircular group [ _p_] is the arc length π _/p_ of the circular dion ( _p_).\nThe area\n\n392\n\nTables\n\nof a Möbius triangle ( _p q_ 2) whose closure is the fundamental region\n\nfor the full polyhedral group [( _p_ , _q_ , 2)] ∼\n\n= [ _p_ , _q_] is equal to the spherical\n\nexcess ( _p_ −1 + _q_ −1 − ½)π. In general, the size of a spherical group can\nbe expressed in terms of the gamma function and is commensurable\n\nwith a power of π.\n\nThe size of a Euclidean group is defined only up to a scalar factor,\n\nbut relative sizes are of interest. When, relative to commensurable\n\nscales, the size of one group is a multiple of the size of another, the first\n\nis a subgroup of the second, the index being the ratio of the respective\n\nsizes.\n\nThe content of a simplex P in Euclidean _m_ -space is readily\n\ncalculated. Let the vertices of P have Cartesian coordinates\n\n**(** _pi_**)** = ( _pi_ 1, _pi_ 2, _. . ._ , _pim_), 1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _m_ \\+ 1,\n\nand let _P_ be the ( _m_ \\+ 1) × ( _m_ \\+ 1) matrix with rows (**(** _pi_**)**\n, 1). Then the content of P is given by\n\n|P| = 1 | det _P_ |. \n\n(1)\n\n_m_!\n\nThe size of a hyperbolic group generated by _n_ reflections is com-\n\nmensurable with a power of π when _n_ is odd, i.e., when the group\n\noperates in an even-dimensional space. In particular, the area of a\n\nLannér or Koszul triangle ( _p q r_) whose closure is the fundamen-\n\ntal region for a group [( _p_ , _q_ , _r_)] is equal to the hyperbolic defect\n(1 − _p_ −1 − _q_ −1 − _r_ −1)π. Values for some hyperbolic Coxeter groups\nhave only recently been calculated (Johnson, Kellerhals, Ratcliffe &\n\nTschantz 1999).\n\nThe volume of the fundamental region for a compact or paracom-\n\npact Coxeter group in hyperbolic 3-space can be expressed in terms\n\nof functions devised by Lobachevsky (1836) and Schläfli (1860) for\n\ndealing with non-Euclidean volumes. The _Lobachevsky function_\n\nis\n\ndefined by\n\n_x_\n\n( _x_) = −\n\nlog |2 sin _t_ | d _t_ , \n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nTables\n\n393\n\nwhile the _Schläfli function S_ , defined by an infinite series, eval-\n\nuates to four times the volume of a spherical orthoscheme with\n\nspecified angles (cf. Coxeter 1935a, pp. 15–16, 22–28; Milnor 1982,\n\npp. 17–22; Alekseevsky, Vinberg & Solodovnikov 1988, chap. 7, § 3;\n\nRatcliffe 1994/2006, § 10.4). The Lobachevsky function is continuous,\n\nperiodic with period π, and equal to zero at multiples of π _/_ 2\\. Applied\n\nto a hyperbolic orthoscheme with essential angles _α_ , _β_ , _γ_ , the\nSchläfli function is imaginary, and the volume is one-fourth the value of the\n\n(real) “hyperbolic Schläfli function”\n\ni _S_( 1 π − _α_ , _β_ , 1 π − _γ_) = ( _α_ \\+ _δ_) − ( _α_ − _δ_) 2\n\n2\n\n\\+ (1π − _δ_ \\+ _β_) + (1π − _δ_ − _β_)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\\+ ( _γ_ \\+ _δ_) − ( _γ_ − _δ_) + 2 (1π − _δ_), (3)\n\n2\n\nwhere _δ_ =\n\n.\n\nOther tetrahedra can be dissected into orthoschemes and the vol-\n\numes of the several pieces then added together. In a few cases, the\n\nresulting expressions are too big for the table. Exact formulas for the\n\nsizes of the five compact groups whose fundamental regions are the\n\nclosures of cycloschemes, as given by Cho & Kim (1999, p. 365), are:\n\n**AB** 3 : ( 1 π + 1 _ω_) − ( 1

S\n\nCollected in the following pages for ready reference are lists,\n\ntogether with such other data as might be found useful, of real\n\ntransformation groups and groups generated by reflections. An expla-\n\nnation of the terminology and notation used in each table, with some\n\nadditional commentary, follows.\n\n**A.** _Real transformation groups_. Table A lists the principal groups\n\nof collineations of real projective, affine, and areplectic _n_ -space; cir-\n\ncularities of real inversive _n_ -space; and isometries and similarities of\n\nEuclidean _n_ -space and other real metric spaces. Each of these is an\n\nextension or a quotient group of the general linear group of invertible\n\nmatrices of order _n_ , _n_ \\+ 1, or _n_ \\+ 2, or one of its subgroups,\nincluding the symplectic, orthogonal, and pseudo-orthogonal groups described\n\nin Chapters 5 and 6. The translation group T _n_ is the additive group of\n\nthe vector space R _n_.\n\nFor _n_ equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5, the projective and special projective\n\npseudoorthogonal groups PO _n_ ,1 and P+O _n_ ,1, which are the isometry\n\nand direct isometry groups of hyperbolic _n_ -space or the circularity and\n\nhomography groups of inversive ( _n_ − 1)-space, can be expressed as\n\nlinear or antilinear fractional transformations over R, C, or H, as given\n\nby (10.4.7).\n\n390\n\nTables\n\n391\n\n**B.** _Groups generated by reflections_. These are the Coxeter groups\n\nthat were described in Chapters 11, 12, and 13. Table B lists all\n\nirreducible spherical and Euclidean groups and all compact and para-\n\ncompact hyperbolic groups generated by reflections. The fundamental\n\nregion for such a group is the closure of a simplex whose dihedral\n\nangles are submultiples of π. For a group generated by _n_ reflections\n\nall of whose subgroups of rank _n_ −1 are spherical, this is a _Möbius, Car-_\n\n_tan_ , or _Lannér_ simplex according as the group is spherical, Euclidean, or\nhyperbolic; for a hyperbolic group some of whose subgroups are\n\nEuclidean, it is a _Koszul_ simplex, with one or more absolute vertices.\n\nEach group is identified by a numeric “Coxeter symbol” corre-\n\nsponding to its Coxeter diagram, as well as a literal _Cartan symbol_\n\nfor spherical and Euclidean groups or a _Witt symbol_ for Euclidean\n\nand hyperbolic groups. The ( _n_ − 1)-dimensional content of the funda-\n\nmental region is the _size_ of the group, to be discussed further below.\n\nA spherical group has a finite _order_ , and its _center_ is of order 2 or 1\n\ndepending on whether or not the group contains the central inversion.\n\nThe _Coxeter number h_ is the period of the product of the generators.\n\nThe _Schläflian σ_ , the determinant of the Schläfli matrix, is positive,\n\nzero, or negative according as the group is spherical, Euclidean, or\n\nhyperbolic; for a crystallographic group _σ_ is an integer.\n\nCorresponding to each finite irreducible crystallographic group\n\ngenerated by _n_ reflections is a simple Lie algebra with the same Car-\n\ntan symbol. If _h_ is the Coxeter number of the group, the algebra has\n\ndimension _n_( _h_ +1). In particular, the respective dimensions of the\nclassical Lie algebras _An_ , _Bn_ , _Cn_ , and _Dn_ are _n_( _n_ \\+ 2), _n_(2\n_n_ \\+ 1), _n_(2 _n_ \\+ 1), and _n_(2 _n_ − 1), while the exceptional Lie\nalgebras _G_ 2, _F_ 4, _E_ 6, _E_ 7, and _E_ 8 have dimensions 2(6 + 1) = 14,\n4(12 + 1) = 52, 6(12 + 1) = 78,\n\n7(18 + 1) = 133, and 8(30 + 1) = 248.\n\nThe size of a spherical group generated by _n_ reflections is inversely\n\nproportional to its order and can be calculated by dividing the content\n\nof the ( _n_ −1)-sphere S _n_ −1 by the order of the group. The size of the\ncircular group [ _p_] is the arc length π _/p_ of the circular dion ( _p_).\nThe area\n\n392\n\nTables\n\nof a Möbius triangle ( _p q_ 2) whose closure is the fundamental region\n\nfor the full polyhedral group [( _p_ , _q_ , 2)] ∼\n\n= [ _p_ , _q_] is equal to the spherical\n\nexcess ( _p_ −1 + _q_ −1 − ½)π. In general, the size of a spherical group can\nbe expressed in terms of the gamma function and is commensurable\n\nwith a power of π.\n\nThe size of a Euclidean group is defined only up to a scalar factor,\n\nbut relative sizes are of interest. When, relative to commensurable\n\nscales, the size of one group is a multiple of the size of another, the first\n\nis a subgroup of the second, the index being the ratio of the respective\n\nsizes.\n\nThe content of a simplex P in Euclidean _m_ -space is readily\n\ncalculated. Let the vertices of P have Cartesian coordinates\n\n**(** _pi_**)** = ( _pi_ 1, _pi_ 2, _. . ._ , _pim_), 1 ≤ _i_ ≤ _m_ \\+ 1,\n\nand let _P_ be the ( _m_ \\+ 1) × ( _m_ \\+ 1) matrix with rows (**(** _pi_**)**\n, 1). Then the content of P is given by\n\n|P| = 1 | det _P_ |. \n\n(1)\n\n_m_!\n\nThe size of a hyperbolic group generated by _n_ reflections is com-\n\nmensurable with a power of π when _n_ is odd, i.e., when the group\n\noperates in an even-dimensional space. In particular, the area of a\n\nLannér or Koszul triangle ( _p q r_) whose closure is the fundamen-\n\ntal region for a group [( _p_ , _q_ , _r_)] is equal to the hyperbolic defect\n(1 − _p_ −1 − _q_ −1 − _r_ −1)π. Values for some hyperbolic Coxeter groups\nhave only recently been calculated (Johnson, Kellerhals, Ratcliffe &\n\nTschantz 1999).\n\nThe volume of the fundamental region for a compact or paracom-\n\npact Coxeter group in hyperbolic 3-space can be expressed in terms\n\nof functions devised by Lobachevsky (1836) and Schläfli (1860) for\n\ndealing with non-Euclidean volumes. The _Lobachevsky function_\n\nis\n\ndefined by\n\n_x_\n\n( _x_) = −\n\nlog |2 sin _t_ | d _t_ , \n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nTables\n\n393\n\nwhile the _Schläfli function S_ , defined by an infinite series, eval-\n\nuates to four times the volume of a spherical orthoscheme with\n\nspecified angles (cf. Coxeter 1935a, pp. 15–16, 22–28; Milnor 1982,\n\npp. 17–22; Alekseevsky, Vinberg & Solodovnikov 1988, chap. 7, § 3;\n\nRatcliffe 1994/2006, § 10.4). The Lobachevsky function is continuous,\n\nperiodic with period π, and equal to zero at multiples of π _/_ 2\\. Applied\n\nto a hyperbolic orthoscheme with essential angles _α_ , _β_ , _γ_ , the\nSchläfli function is imaginary, and the volume is one-fourth the value of the\n\n(real) “hyperbolic Schläfli function”\n\ni _S_( 1 π − _α_ , _β_ , 1 π − _γ_) = ( _α_ \\+ _δ_) − ( _α_ − _δ_) 2\n\n2\n\n\\+ (1π − _δ_ \\+ _β_) + (1π − _δ_ − _β_)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\\+ ( _γ_ \\+ _δ_) − ( _γ_ − _δ_) + 2 (1π − _δ_), (3)\n\n2\n\nwhere _δ_ =\n\n.\n\nOther tetrahedra can be dissected into orthoschemes and the vol-\n\numes of the several pieces then added together. In a few cases, the\n\nresulting expressions are too big for the table. Exact formulas for the\n\nsizes of the five compact groups whose fundamental regions are the\n\nclosures of cycloschemes, as given by Cho & Kim (1999, p. 365), are:\n\n**AB** 3 : ( 1 π + 1 _ω_) − ( 1

Y M B O L S\n\nListed in the following pages, with brief definitions, are some of the\n\nsymbols used in this book to denote number systems, geometries and\n\nmeasures, vectors and matrices, mappings, continuous and discrete\n\ngroups, polytopes and honeycombs, and a few other things. Follow-\n\ning each symbol definition is a reference to the section or sections of\n\nthe text where a fuller treatment may be found. Some widely used\n\nsymbols first appear in the Preliminaries.\n\nMany algebraic and geometric concepts involve some kind of dual-\n\nity, which is reflected notationally by the interchange of parentheses\n\nand brackets and by the caron (inverted circumflex) now commonly\n\nused in symbols for dualized figures or structures. One basic dualiz-\n\ning operation is matrix transposition: the transpose of a matrix _A_ is\n\ndenoted by _A_ ˇ.\n\nA parenthesized F in a symbol generally stands for either the real\n\nfield R or the complex field C. For a transformation group, the real\n\nfield is usually to be understood if none is specified. Thus the sym-\n\nbols T _n_(R) and GL _n_(R) for the real translation and general linear\n\ngroups can be abbreviated to T _n_ and GL _n_ , and O _n_ denotes the real\northogonal group. However, the unitary group U _n_ operates on a complex\nvector space, and the real, complex, and quaternionic symplectic\n\ngroups are distinguished as Sp _n_ , S˘p _n_ , and S˜p _n_.\n\nMany transformation groups are subgroups or quotient groups\n\nof others. The direct product of two groups _H_ and _K_ is denoted by\n\n406\n\nList of Symbols\n\n407\n\n_H_ × _K_ , and the direct product of _n_ copies of a group _H_ by _Hn_. If\n_N_ is a normal subgroup of a group _G_ and _Q_ ∼\n\n= _G/N_ another subgroup of\n\n_G_ , with _N_ ∨ _Q_ ∼\n\n= _G_ and _N_ ∩ _Q_ ∼\n\n= 1, then _G_ is an extension of _N_ by _Q_ ,\n\nexpressible as a semidirect product _N_ _Q_. The wreath product _H_ S _n_ is a\nsemidirect product _Hn_ S _n_.\n\nDiscrete groups generated by reflections can be represented either\n\nby Coxeter’s bracket notation or by alphabetic Cartan or Witt sym-\n\nbols, as given in Table B. The principal finite reflection groups are\n\nlisted here, along with related symbols for polytopes and honeycombs.\n\n_Number systems_\n\nF _q_\n\nFinite field with _q_

So it seems remarkable that information concerning\ntheir history and mathematical properties is quite difficult to find. The\nstudy of polyhedra is still an active area of research and, along with other\nparts of geometry, is currentlv enjoying something of a renaissance. However,\nit is still possible (even probable) that students can complete their\neducation to graduate level and not moot such fundamental objects as the five\nPlatonic solids. The lack of adequate sources of information may contribute to\nthis state of affairs. This book is my response to this vacuum. It tells the\nstory of what people have thought about polyhedra over the ages, and explains\nsome of the mathematics that has been developed to study them. I started the\nproject that developed into this book by chance over sovon years ago. I had\njust completed my Ph.D. studies at Liverpool University, where the mathematics\ndepartment had recently begun to build up a collection of mathematical\nexhibits. These included models of all the polyhedra labelled iegulai: the\nfive Platonic solids, the four star polyhedra, and five compounds. Each week,\none departmental seminar was set aside for general interest talks given by\nmembers of staff and research students so that people could find out what\ntheir colleagues were thinking about. In one of these sessions I decided to\nexplain some of the mathematical properties of the new polyhedral models.\nNaively expecting to find all the information I needed presented in several\neasily available books, I visited the library. The books I found were of three\ntypes. Some contained what is often referred to as 'recreational mathematics'.\nThese books often had a chapter or two on the basic properties of a few kinds\nof polyhedra. The more advanced of such books mentioned Euler's formula. The\nsecond category of books fell at the other end of the spectrum. They\nconcentrated on polytopes in arbitrary dimensions and occasionally dealt with\nthree-dimensional examples. The other books I found were guides for model-\nmaking. Even large volumes on the historv of mathematics contained few\ncomments on the subject of polyhedra after the Greeks, presumably because it\nis not seen as part of 'mainstream mathematics'. I gleaned all the information\nI could from these sources, followed up their references to journal articles\nand gradually built up enough material to present a survey of the area. I\nsupplemented the display models with some from inv own collection and talked\non 'The history of polyhedra'. After the seminal several\n\nXll Preface colleagues asked for my sources of information. On hearing of the\ntrouble I had had they suggested that I write up the talk. Since then I have\nsearched for information to fill in some of the details of my original talk\nand this book is the result. I am not a historian and I doubt whether the book\nshould be regarded as a history of polyhedra. I have simply collected together\nthe things that I found interesting and arranged them by theme in approximate\nchronological order. My aim was to present more than a catalogue of\ndefinitions and theorems. The dry predigested style commonly used in textbooks\ntends to ignore the motivation that led to the results being described and\nleaves readers confused by details they see no need for. I have tried to place\nresults in context, to trace the development of the underlying ideas, and find\ntheir influences on, and connections with, other subjects both within\nmathematics and further afield. My selection of topics is, of course, a\npersonal choice. Although the work is certainly not encyclopaedic, I think the\ncoverage is fairly complete up to the turn of the century. I have chosen to\nconcentrate on the three-dimensional, geometric aspects of the subject since a\nlarge part of the attraction of polyhedra deiives from making and\nexperimenting with models. Very few topics that could be iecast as graph\ntheory have been included. This means that many developments made this century\non the combinatorial properties of polyhedra are not covered. There are three\nmajor omissions of this kind that I am aware of. The first is Steinitz'\ntheorem, which plays a central role in connecting the geometric and\ncombinatorial sides of the subject. A presentation of this theorem is easily\navailable in Branko Grunbaum's book Convex Polytopes. A discussion of\nEberhard-type theorems and Alexandrov's theorem is also missing. Perhaps moie\nsmprising to some readers will be the omission of references to duality.\nAlthough we can retrospectively find the concept in much early work, it is not\nclear whether the authors were aware of it. In any case, what do we mean by\nduality? A few passing remarks on the reciprocal properties of the Platonic\nsolids could cause more confusion than insight: projective and combinatorial\nduality have been muddled for ages. Furthermore, we do not always find duality\nin places where it might be expected. For instance, there is no way to\nconstruct the vertex-transitive polyhedra from the face-transitive ones 'by\nduality'. To discuss the topic fullv would take a chapter in itself. Other\ntopics that are not mentioned are space-filling or neighbour lv polyhedra,\nconnections with higher-dimensional polytopes or tilings, woven polvhedra of\nvarious kinds, polyhedral embeddings of mathematically interesting surfaces,\nor applications to linear programming and computational geometry. Skimming\nthrough the book you will see it contains many illustrations. I think these\nare essential when discussing a subject so many of whose underlying intuitions\nderive from visual experience. The book also contains proofs I have\n\nAcknowledgements Xlll tried to explain these simply but fully. For the most\npart they are self-contained. One exception to this rule is the application of\nsome group theory in the last two chapters. The theorem which is appealed to\nis discussed in Appendix 2.

Peter Cromwell\nLiverpool, 1996\n\n1 Introduction Geometry is a skill of the eves and the hands as well as of the\nmind. J Pedorsoii Models of polyhedra adorn the personal spaces of people with\na broad range of mathematical experience. In the university office of the\nprofessional mathematician, the teacher's classroom, and the child's bedroom,\nthese attractive geometrical objects have a universal appeal. Their popularity\nhas endured for centuries. This book explores how the study of polyhedra has\ndeveloped, the ways people have used them and thought about them over the\nages, and how their ideas have evolved. No science advances in a smooth and\ncontinuous way and the study of polyhedra is no exception. We follow some of\nthe searches for explanations of observed or conjectured properties of\npolyhedra. Sometimes this is a frustrating struggle to understand the\nfoundations and limitations of a new concept. What we might retrospectively\nregard as a significant milestone is often the result, of the accumulated\neffort of many people over a long period. Progress can also be made in rapid\nleaps as a fresh mind brings a brilliant insight to an old problem which then\nthrows open a whole new region for exploration. We shall see that the study of\npolyhedra has contributed to several aieas of mathematics and has connections\nwith many others. However, polyhedra are not confined to mathematics. Anything\nwhich is bounded by flat surfaces and which has well-defined corners has a\npolyhedral form. It is easy to think of examples from architecture. Many more\ncan be found in the three kingdoms of nature— mineral, vegetable and animal.\nPolyhedra have been used in philosophical or scientific explanations of the\nworld around us. They have even found theii way into art, literature and\ntheological debate. We will begin with a brief look at some of these.\nPolyhedra in architecture Examples of polyhedra in architecture are easy to\nfind. The ancient pyramids at Giza in Egypt, built over four and a half\nthousand years ago, are probably\n\n2 Introduction the most simple in design. Modern office blocks are often\nprismatic stmctuies of steel and glass. Other buildings combine both elements,\nplacing a pyramidal roof structure on a prismatic living space. An octagonal\nversion of this principle underlies the Baptistry at Florence in Italy. More\nunusual polyhedral constructions have been used for apartments in various\nparts of the world. A complex of cubes with their diagonals placed vertically\nso that each rests on a corner has been erected in Rotterdam in Holland. In\nIsrael, apartments have been made from a complex of dodecahedra. The geodesic\ndomes invented by R. Buckminster Fuller in the 1940's are some of the most\nlemaikable forms of polyhedral architecture. These first impressed the world\nat the Expo 67 world fair held at Montreal in Canada. They are now used to\nprotect astronomical telescopes and radio antennae from the elements. On a\nsmaller scale they are used as the frameworks for hemispherical glasshouses\nand tents, and children's climbing frames. Polyhedra in art Polyhedra became\npopular motifs in art when linear perspective was introduced by the Italians\nof the fifteenth century. The flat faces and hard edges of polvhedral forms\nmake them very good exercises for those wanting to practice perspective\nconstructions, and many painters' manuals written in the Renaissance include\ninstructions for foreshortening the Platonic solids. Finished paintings\nsometimes included polyhedra as ornaments but they were usually disguised as\npavilions, architecture or headwear. Polyhedra also appear in twentieth-\ncentury art. The Sacrament of the Last, Supper by Salvador Dali contains a\nskeletal outline of part of a regular dodecahedron—the Platonic symbol of the\nuniverse. Several works by the Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher contain\npolyhedra, often star polyhedra or compounds. Op-art designs include many\napparently flat-faced objects which cannot be given a consistent three-\ndimensional interpretation. These can be regarded as 'impossible polyhedra'. A\nwell-known object of this kind is the Penrose tribar shown in Figure 1.1.\nFigure 1.1. The Penrose tribar—an 'impossible' polyhedron.\n\nPOLYHEDRA IN ORNAMENT 3 The same properties of polyhedra which made them\nattractive to the first artists who used perspective techniques (the fact the\npositions of a few vertices give enough information to completely describe the\nsolid) make them appealing as computer graphics. Computers can manipulate and\ndraw pictures of simple polyhedra very quickly. More complex polyhedral meshes\nare used by computer- aided design packages to assist engineers create the\nbodies of new cars and aircraft. In the science-fiction film Tron a man finds\nhimself transported into a computer where he meets various programs and other\nelements of computer architecture. In one of the more friendly encounters, he\nhas a conversation with a floating polyhedron that continually changes shape.\nAfter having all his questions answered either 'yes' (when the polyhedron\nmetamorphoses into a large yellow regular octahedron) or 'no' (as it becomes\nan orange stellation of the icosahedron) he realises that this object is the\nmost basic element inside the machine—a bit. Much modern abstract sculpture\nhas a polyhedral form. Sometimes this is as simple as a cube with one corner\nembedded in the ground. Other sculptors use tetrahedra stuck together face to\nface to make vertical columns or sprawling snakelike creatures. One of the\nlargest polyhedral sculptures is in Vegreville, Alberta, Canada. It is a huge\nEaster egg over seven metres high designed and built by Ronald Dale Resch. It\nis constructed from 2732 bronze, silver and gold tiles some eighty percent of\nwhich are equilateral triangles. The others are non- convex equilateral\nhexagons in the shape of three-pointed stars. The variations in the egg's\ncurvature are achieved by changing the angles in the stars. Polyhedra in\nornament Many ornaments have polyhedral forms. Vases and decorative containers\nare an obvious source. A commonly used shape is the cub-octahedron, probably\nbecause it is so easy to make. Earrings of this shape dating from 450AD have\nbeen found in Germany. Cub-octahedra are also found in the decorations on\nJapanese shrines. A large cub-octahedron embellished with chrysanthemums, the\nemblem of the emperor, sits on top of a tea house in the Shugakuin Imperial\nVilla in Kyoto. Sacred lanterns of this shape have been made since the\nthirteenth century and are still used in ceremonies to commemorate the dead.\nThe Koreans use rhomb- cub-octahedral lanterns. Around fifty bronze ornaments\nor charms of dodecahedral shape have survived from Roman times and can be seen\nin the museums around Europe. Most are hollow with circular holes of various\nsizes cut in their faces and small balls attached at their vertices. Some\nolder examples of Etruscan origin are also known. A dodecahedron recently\ndiscovered in Switzerland has a lead core covered with silver and the names of\nthe signs of the zodiac inscribed on its faces. The association of the twelve\nmonths with the dodecahedron still continues. One issue\n\n4 Introduction Figure 1.2. Net for the Tipu Sultan icosahedron. each year of\nMathematics in School, a magazine for teachers, prints the net of a\ndodecahedron with a calendar printed on it—one month per face. Dice are\nanother common form of polyhedral object. All the regular solids have been\nused as dice. A curious icosahedral die was found in the treasure of Tipu\nSultan in India when he was overthrown by the British in 1799. It is made of\ngold and has an unusual distribution of numbers on it. A net is shown in\nFigure 1.2. To obtain a die with ten faces both dipyramids and prisms have\nbeen used. A very unusual die in the shape of a rhomb-cub-octahedron was\nunearthed at Corfe Castle, southern England, in 1973. It is made from a local\nblack marble and is thought to be between two and three hundred years old.\nOnly the square faces have markings on them. Pairs of letters are incised in\nsix of them and the other squares contain patterns of circles representing the\nfirst twelve integers. Figure 1.3 contains a net for this solid. Its use is\nunknown. Polyhedra in nature The precious gemstones cut and set into rings are\nsparkling examples of polvhedra but their facets are produced artificially.\nNatural processes can produce equally striking results: crystals (Plate 2).\nBounded by flat reflective planes, theii obvious geometric features contrast\nstrongly with the rounded, soft, flexible oi inegulai qualities more\nfrequently found in natural forms. Because of this distinctiveness, they have\nalways attracted attention. In the nineteenth century, the study of polyhedra\nand crystals led to the geometric analysis of symmetry Symmetry theory,\ntogether with the assumption that crystals are built up as icpeating anays of\natoms, implies the crystallographic restriction: crystals can onlv have two-\nfold.\n\nPOLYHEDRA IN NATURE 5 o LS o o o o A 0 0 0 0 0 V 2 O ooo ooo ooo ND 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 o o CZ5 N A ooo o o ooo V o TA A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 V oooo oooo oooo NH oooo\nooo oooo A ooo ooo V Figure 1.3.

For this reason,\nthe discovery in 1984 of a crystalline-looking substance with five-fold\nsymmetry caused great excitement. These objects are now called quasicrystals.\nThe kernels of some nuts and fruits contain many small seeds which grow in a\nrestricted space. Pomegranates are one example. As each seed grows it presses\nup against its neighbours. The seeds prevent each other from expanding\nuniformly and they grow to fill the available space producing flat-faced seeds\nwith sharp corners. If the seeds had a perfectly uniform distribution before\nthey began to grow and were subjected to isotropic compression forces they\nwould end up as rhombic dodecahedra. The principal of economy—maximising\nvolume from given materials— leads to the construction of roughly spherical\norganisms. These sometimes have polyhedral substructures. Ernst Haeckel on his\nvoyage on H.M.S. Challenger, in the 1880's, drew many pictures of microscopic\nsingle-celled creatures called radiolaria. A radiolarian has a spherical\nskeleton that is polyhedral in character. Haeckel named three of them\ncircoporus octahedrus, circorrhegma dodecahedra and circo- gonia icosahedra\nbecause he thought they resembled the Platonic solids. His illustrations are\nshown in Figure 1.4. Spherical cages also form part of simple viruses such as\nthat responsible for polio. Viruses reproduce themselves by taking over the\nprotein synthesising equip-\n\n6 Introduction Figure 1.4. Three of Haeckel's sketches of radiolaria. ment of\nliving cells. The viral nucleic acid introduced into the cell causes the\ncell's machinery to produce parts for new protein cages which protect the\nreplicated RNA in the new viruses. The simplest virus cages are built up from\nrepeating units that clump together in groups of five (pentamers) or six\n(hexamers). These pentagons and hexagons then fit together to form spherical\ncapsules with approximate icosahedral symmetry. The recently discovered\nallotrope of carbon also forms polyhedral spheres, ellipsoids and tubes. In\nthe smallest example, C60, the sixty atoms are arranged in the same pattern as\nthe vertices of a truncated icosahedron—familial as a soccer ball. These\ncarbon cages have been named Fullerenes in honour of Buckminster Fuller but\nthey are colloquially known as 'Bucky balls'. Polyhedral molecules have been\nknown for some time. Organic chemists have made carbon-hydrogen structures\nsuch as cubane, C8H8, whose carbon atoms lie at the corners of a cube. Many\nmore examples occur in inorganic chemistry, particularly with compounds\ninvolving the transition metals. In a molybdenum chloride ion (Mo6Clg+) the\nchlorine atoms form a cubic cage around an octahedron composed of metal atoms.\nHalides of platinum and zirconium provide further examples of molecular\npolyhedra. Compounds of boron and hydrogen, called boranes, have triangular-\nfaced polyhedral structures which include some of the deltahedra. Molecules of\nthe borane B8H8 oscillate back and forth between the forms of a Siamese\ndodecahedron and a square antiprism.\n\nPOLYHEDRA IN CARTOGRAPHY 7 Polyhedra in cartography Making maps of the world\nhas been a problem ever since we discovered that the Earth is not flat. A\nglobe is spherical and can be used to represent the world accurately but it\nprovides a limited view: we cannot study the whole of the Earth's surface at\nthe same time. Transferring data from a sphere to a fiat surface presents\ngreat difficulties and always results in some distortion. In the commonly seen\nMercator projection, invented in the sixteenth century, a cylinder is placed\naround the globe so that the two surfaces touch along the equator. The\nfeatures on the surface of the sphere are then projected outwards until they\nmeet the cylinder. The map is an exact representation along the line of\ncontact, but away from the equator the map is less precise. The distortion is\nworse nearest the poles; the poles themselves cannot be represented.\nBuckminster Fuller was frustrated by this inaccurate view of the woild in\nwhich Greenland appears three times as large as South America when, in\nreality, the opposite is the case. Distortion must appear in any flat map of\nthe Earth but it might be possible to smear it out evenly so that it is less\nnoticeable. Fuller sought to show the shape, distribution, and relative sizes\nof the Eaith's landmasses while containing the worst distortion to the\nseventy-five percent of the Earth's surface covered by water. He took a\nregular solid, the icosahedron, composed of twenty cquilateial triangles and\nsubdivided each face into smaller triangles. Calculating from a similar grid\nsuperimposed on the Earth he could transfer the data from the sphere to the\npolyhedron. This was all done between the two world wars before computers were\navailable to assist with the calculations. The resulting map is unique in its\nlack of visible distortion. Fuller also had to choose the position of the\nicosahedron carefully so that it could be cut along its edges and opened out\nflat without creating unnatural breaks in any landmass. The result, known as\nthe Dymavion map, is shown in Figure 1.5. In February 1943, Life magazine\nincluded a colour, cut-out version of Fuller's map. Before it was published,\nthe editors had the map examined by a panel of experts to certify that it was\nan accurate representation of the Earth and that it was a new discovery. The\npanel, which included the Chief Geographer of the U.S. State department and\ntwo mathematicians, could not find geographical or mathematical flaws in\nFuller's map but were still uncertain as to how it had been created. In terms\nfilled with negative connotations, their report concluded that it was 'pure\ninvention'. When Fuller applied for a patent for his map he found a ruling had\nbeen issued which decreed all possible projection methods used in cartography\nhad been exhausted. Hence his application was rejected. He presented the\nPatent Office with the Life report. The testimony of the experts could not be\nargued with and he was granted the first patent this centmv for innovation in\nmap-making.\n\n8 Introduction The word 'Dymaxion' and the Fuller Projection Dymaxion Map\ndesign aie tiademaiks of the Buckminster Fuller Institute, Santa Barbara. ©\n1938, 1967 and 1992 All lights loscived.

Both Plato\nand Kcplei made use of the five regular solids. For Kepler, the polyhedra\ndetermined the size of the known universe, the number and relative distances\nof the planets. Plato associated the solids with the four Empedoclean elements\nand the heavens, and tried to explain the properties of matter. Following\nIsaac Newton's description of the 'clockwork universe' the Design Argument for\nthe existence of God became popular: since we see evidence of design all\naround us, there must be a designer. The Natural Theology of William Paley\n(1743-1805) argues this case. In his argument against the existence1 of an\ninherent, universal ordering principle, Paley used the Platonic solids as the\narchetypal example of order. Order is not universal; which it would be if it\nissued from a constant and necessary principle ■ ■ ■. Where order is wanted we\nfind it; where order is not wanted, i.e. where, if it prevailed, it would be\nuseless, there we do not find it. • • • No useful purpose would have arisen\nfrom moulding rocks and mountains into regular solids, or bounding the channel\nof the ocean by geometrical curves. a In what must be the earliest work of\nscience-fiction, L'Autrc Monde ou Les Etats et Empires de la Lime et du\nSoleil, Cyrano de Bergerac (1619 1055) writes about a space flight. He was\nimprisoned in a tower room and hatched a plan to escape. A friend brought him\nmaterials and he constructed a flying machine which he hoped would carry him\nto his friend's estate. The craft was light and stiong. a crystal globe having\nmany facets, a ball like a blazing mirror, in the shape of an icosahedron! It\nworked by catching as much light as possible to create a void which sucked in\nair and thereby carried the machine upwards. However, tin1 powei of the sun's\nrays was greater than he anticipated and instead of landing safely outside his\nprison, he was carried beyond the Earth's atmosphere and towards the sun.\nAfter four months he landed on a sunspot and began an advent me. About this\nbook The chapters of this book are a series of related essays, each of which\nexplores a particular theme. They are arranged in approximate chronological\norder but are largely independent units that can be read in any sequence. The\nonlv exception to this is Chapter 8 which develops the ideas and notation for\ndescribing symmetry. This notation is used in the following two chapters. As\nin a piece of music, some themes appear several times in the book, but each\nentry is slightly different from the last. The subject is modified and\ndeveloped or\n\n10 Introduction treated from a new viewpoint which brings previously hidden\nelements to the fore. One such topic is regularity. Regular polyhedra were\nintroduced bv the Greeks more than two thousand years ago as part of their\nstudy of solid geometry. They knew the five solids named after Plato. When\nJohannes Kepler experimented with new ways of constructing polyhedra, he found\ntwo more which could be labelled regular. Two centuries later, Louis Poinsot\nrediscovered them and found another two. The mathematical development of\nsymmetry led to a new way of interpreting regularity which had wider\napplications to compound polvhedra. Other themes which recur throughout the\nbook are a part of everv blanch of mathematics—the problems of definition,\nclassification and enumeration. What objects are we talking about? When are\ntwo objects to be regarded as the same? What kinds of object are there and how\nmany are there? Is there any pattern or structure in such a diverse\ncollection? Even though the study of polyhedra is one of oldest branches of\nmathematics, the theory is still being advanced. However, this does not mean\nthat it is necessary to scale high barriers of intimidating mathematics\nerected over the past two thousand years to attain some understanding of what\nhas been achieved and what is being investigated today. Because of the\ngeometrical nature of the subject, many of the results are accessible to non-\nspecialists. Geometry has a strong visual component. It is this which gives\nthe aesthetic appeal to the subject and which means many ideas can be\ncommunicated with the aid of pictures 01 models. Even though there are many\nillustrations in this book, sometimes they may not be sufficient. At a few\nplaces I have suggested that you make your own models to enhance your\nunderstanding of a particular point. Hands-on experience with actual three-\ndimensional polyhedra is the best way to find out what is going on. Once\nintuition is developed the pictures may suffice as reminders. The inclusion of\nproofs Although this book tells a story, it also includes proofs of the\ntheorems. Not everyone will want to delve into the fine details of every\nproof, but the ideas and arguments presented in them are a part of the story.\nIt is for the undcistanding provided by these explanations that people have\nworked so hard. Creating a proof is like taking something apart to see what\nmakes it work. A good proof well explained shows not only that something is\ntrue but also why it has to be true. Unfortunately, the language of rigorous\nargument can be intimidating. The reasons for some of the pedantry are often\nlost on the reader, and a mass of details sometimes obscures the flow of\nideas. Remember that a proof is just an argument designed to convince its\nintended audience of the truth of some statement. As audiences have become\nmore demanding over time, so the standards required have been raised. When the\noversights in yesterday's pi oofs\n\nApproaches to the book 11 are taken into account, and the errors are removed,\ntoday's level of pi oof can be reached. Tomorrow they will be revised again\nwhen the conditions arc intcipieted in new and unforeseen ways and new\ncounter-examples slip round the lestiiclions. Although new ideas are often\nneeded to create an acceptable proof, thev do not grow out of logical\ndeductions. Behind every proof there is an intuitive feeling of what should\nhappen. Mathematicians seek a deeper understanding than a mere chain of\nsyllogisms. This intuition is sometimes more convincing and reassuring than\nthe proof itself. But proof is essential. The function of argument is to be\ncritical and to focus attention on points that have been overlooked. To\nadvance mathematics in an original direction requires imagination. Pi oofs\npoint out where limitations and restrictions need to be imposed when our\nimaginations jump to conclusions which are too general. A proof is the check\nthat we have not deceived ourselves. Approaches to the book This is both a\nmathematics book and a book about how mathematics is done. It can be\napproached on several levels. For readers wishing to trace the evolution of\nideas over a long period of time, the details in the proofs may be\nunnecessary. Others who want to concentrate on the theory will hopefully find\nthe inibiniation they desire. I expect most readers will vary their approach\naccording to topic, dipping more deeply into the subjects they find\nattractive. Whatever your approach, there are a few things you should note.\nUnfamiliar mathematical ideas cannot be fully understood by just, reading\nabout them, no matter how good the exposition. Learning mathematics is an\nactive process not a passive one. There will be places where you cannot see\neverything in youi mind and will need to reach for a pencil or a model to find\nout why something works. You learn through experience—making and handling\nmodels, solving problems, working through arguments. When you come to the\nstatement of a thcoiem make sure you understand what it, means. Identify the\nconditions and the conclusion. Check it out on a few examples to verify it.\nReading a proof is a skill which has to be learned through practice. If vou\nget, lost in a proof, try to take a step back and locate the underlying\nessentials and the way they fit together. If you get truly stuck then skip the\nproof foi a while and return to it later. (The end of a proof is marked with\nthe symbol ■.) A period of incubation allows the new ideas to settle and when\nyou reread the arguments you may not see where you had a problem. On the other\nhand you mav still be stuck. If this happens you can either omit the proof,\nwork through the whole argument on a specific example and follow what happens,\nor try to create your own argument or counter-example. Remember that,\nultimately, a proof appeals to your imagination and previous experiences. It\nis an argument to convince an\n\n12 Introduction audience. It is subjective and what matters is whether it\nconvinces you. Many previously overlooked flaws are discovered because people\nare skeptical about some point of a demonstration. Some final remarks on the\nlayout of the text. A few isolated paragraphs are marked with a dagger (f)\nsymbol. These clarify or expand some point in the preceding text but assume\nsome prior knowledge which not all readers will possess. They provide\nsupplementary information only, so if you do not understand them skip over\nthem. The sources of the quotations are collected together at the back of the\nbook. They are listed by chapter and are indexed by small letters at the end\nof the quotations. Figures and tables are numbered in a single sequence. Basic\nconcepts There is one rather awkward problem to be overcome in writing a book\nabout the history of polyhedra and that is to decide what is meant by the term\n'polyhedron'. A glance at the figures in this book will give you some idea of\nthe variety of objects that have been described as polyhedra. Trying to make a\ncatch-all definition is impossible as different writers have applied the same\nterm to several different ideas, some of which are mutually exclusive. At the\nmost elementary level we can ask whether a polyhedron is a solid object or a\nhollow surface. The answers to such questions depend to a large extent on the\nperiod in which the geometers lived and the problems that they studied. To a\nclassical Greek geometer a polyhedron was solid. Over the past 200 years, it\nhas become more convenient to think of polyhedra as surfaces. Today, some\nmathematicians regard polyhedra as frameworks. It has been said that the only\nthing all polyhedra have in common is the name. However, there is some common\nground to be found. The polyhedra in the illustrations clearly share some\ncharacteristics. Their most obvious property is that they are made of (or\nbounded by) polygons. This fundamental property constituted a definition of\n'polyhedron' for many centuries, even if it was not stated explicitly. As we\nshall see, such an open-ended definition can be interpreted in many ways. It\ndoes not supply any restriction on how the polygons are to be put together or\non what kinds of polygon we can use. This ambiguity has been extremely\nfruitful, allowing the term to evolve in several directions and leading to the\nstudy of different kinds of polyhedral objects. Because of this, I shall leave\n'polyhedron' as this vaguely defined term. Throughout the course of the book,\nwe shall see how its meaning has been refined and altered at various times. We\nshall, however, need some basic terminology to refer to pieces of polyhedra—\nterminology which can be used however 'polyhedron' is interpreted. I have\ntried to use the language appropriate to the period under discussion but\noccasionally it is more convenient to use modern terminology. This means\n\nBasic concepts 13 that some basic terms must be introduced before their\ncorrect place in the story. These are listed below and illustrated in Figure\n1.6. • Each polygon is called a face of the polyhedron. • A line segment along\nwhich two faces come together is called an edge. • A point where several edges\nand faces come together is called a vertex. I shall make a distinction between\nthe constituent parts of polygons and those of polyhedra. Thus a polygon has\nsides and corners whereas a polyhedron has faces, edges and vertices. Each\nedge of a polyhedron is formed from the sides of two faces. Faces which have\ntwo sides joined to form an edge are said to be adjacent. Figure 1.6. Basic\nterminology. There are also several kinds of angle in a polyhedron. • The\nangle in the corner of a polygonal face is called a plane angle. • In a solid\npolyhedron, the region of the polyhedron near a vertex is called a solid\nangle. It is a chunk of the corner and is bounded by three or more plane\nangles. • The angle between two adjacent faces is called a dihedral angle. To\nfind a dihedral angle mark a point on the shared edge and a line perpendicular\nto the edge in each of the two faces starting at the chosen point. The\ndihedral angle is the angle between the two lines (see Figure 1.7). You will\nprobably be familiar with the names of a few basic polyhedra. A pyramid is\nformed by connecting all the corners of a planar polygon to another point not\nlying in the plane. The polygon is called the base and the extra vertex is the\napex. All the faces surrounding the apex will be triangular. A prism is formed\nfrom two congruent polygons lying in parallel planes connected by a ring of\nrectangles. An antiprism is similar except that the connecting ring is\ncomposed of isosceles triangles. See Figure 2.25 for examples.\n\n14 Introduction Figure 1.7. A dihedral angle. Making models At various places\nin this book you will be encouraged to make a few models to enhance your\nunderstanding of the concepts being discussed. In geometry, pictures are often\nbetter than words, and in the study of three-dimensional geometry, an object\nthat you can touch and see from many different angles is bettei than a\npicture. Experience with a few models will make it easier for you to perceive'\nthe many figures in the book in a three-dimensional context. The suggested\nmodels are small and convex and should not present much difficulty. However,\nyou may wish to make models of some of the other polvhedra shown in the plates\nand illustrations, some of which are quite intricate. All model-makers soon\ndevelop their own ways of achieving satisfactory results. The variety of\ninstructions given in various books is evidence of this fact. For guidance\npurposes, I shall offer my own techniques used to construct the models shown\nin the colour plates. The most important part of any model is the pattern. It\nis essential that the pattern pieces are constructed accurately otherwise they\nwill not meet conectly and the model will not close up properly. The kind of\npattern pieces needed will depend on how you intend to decorate the finished\nmodel. If you want to use materials of different colours then you will\nprobably need to cut out many faces individually. If you are happy with a\nplain model or want to paint it when completed then you can design larger\npattern pieces which have several faces in each piece. Some polyhedra can be\nfolded up from a single piece. This reduces the number of joins that need to\nbe made. Having drawn the pattern pieces, the next step is to transfer the\ndesigns to the material to be used for the model. The models shown in the\nplates are made from thin index card. Several sheets can be marked out\nsimultaneously by stapling them together in two opposite corners. The corners\nof each pattern can then be pricked through all the layers of card at once\nusing a pin or other pointed implement. Do this on a sturdy flat surface\ncovered with something soft to receive the pin. A carpeted floor or a folded\ntowel on a table are good for this. When you have pricked out the number of\npieces required, separate the sheets\n\nMaking models 15 of card and lightly sketch on the outlines of each face with\na pencil. Decide where you need tabs and folds then score along these lines\nusing a steel ruler as a guide. An empty ballpoint pen makes an excellent\nscoring tool. To cut out the pieces you can use a craft knife against a steel\nruler for accuracy but scissors are usually adequate. The choice of where to\nput tabs will depend on several factors. Then1 are two methods to make joins:\nyou can put a tab on both pieces to be joined and glue the tabs together, or\nyou can put a tab on only one piece and glue the other piece onto it. The\nfirst method produces a rib inside the model along each edge which gives the\nmodel added strength. This method is particularly useful when the dihedral\nangle along the join is greater than 180°. The second method is the one I\nusually use. It is a good idea to try to alternate tabs and free sides around\neach face as far as possible as this helps to prevent misalignment. You may\nalso find a pair of needle-nose pliers helpful to apply pressure along a tab\nwhile the glue dries, especially as the model progresses and the interioi\nbecomes increasingly difficult to get at. Models which have both mountain and\nvalley folds are often unstable They can sometimes be deformed unless struts\nare added in the interior to piovide extra rigidity. Some kind of internal\nsupport is also needed for models in which several faces are supposed to be\ncoplanar (star polyhedra and compounds). Defoimities in such models are\nusually clearly visible. I feel I should offer a word of warning here. Model-\nmaking can become addictive. Polyhedra tend to come in natural groups and once\nyou have made one member of a set you can feel a strong desire to make all the\nothers With large complex models taking many hours, this can become a very\ntime consuming obsession. On the other hand, it is cheap, safe, and produces\nunusual decorative ornaments.\n\nFrom The Fractal Geometry of Nature by Benoit B. Mandelbrot. Freeman 1982, by\npermission.\n\nIndivisible, Inexpressible and Unavoidable Infinities and indivisibles\ntranscend out finite understanding, the former on account of their magnitude,\nthe latter because of theii snmllness, imagine what they are when combined \"\nGalileo One of the most basic applications of mathematics is the determination\nof area and volume. This branch of mathematics, known as mensuration,\noriginated in the practical problems of everyday life. Measuring, counting,\nand pattern-making are probably the oldest forms of mathematical activity. The\nearliest writing on geometrical problems consists of sets of rules to he\nfollowed when solving a particular type of problem: How to calculate the aiea\nof a field, or the quantity of grain that can be stored in a barn, for\nexample. We do not know how or when these techniques were developed, just as\nwe can sav nothing of the origins of language. The early texts that have\nsurvived recoid no more than sets of instructions. Later generations sought to\nexplain the formulae they used and to find out why they worked. This led to\nseveral unexpected difficulties. Even the simplest of geometrical figures\ncaused problems. In particular, the formula for the volume of a pyramid proved\nhard to establish. Castles of eternity Planted on the fringe of the Egyptian\ndesert, stark and austere, the pyramids dominate the landscape. Rising from a\nsquare base, their four triangular faces slope inwards to meet at a single\npoint. The clean lines of their geometrical form contrast with the amorphous\nirregularity of their surroundings; theii simple outward appearance conceals\nan intricate design within.\n\n18 Chapter 1 Yet these huge structures are more than mere monuments: they aic\ntombs built to protect mummified pharaohs from disturbance and destruction.\nThe Egyptians went to such great lengths to preserve the king's body because'\nthey believed that the attainment of immortality depended on the continuing\nexistence of his Earthly form. Thus the king's tomb had to be virtually\nindestructible—it was his 'castle of eternity'. The era of pyramid building\nspans the Old Kingdom (2686 2181bc), the period of Egyptian history covered by\nthe third to the sixth dynasties of pharaohs. The first pyramid was built\naround 2650BC. It was a step pyramid produced by successive heightening of a\nflat-topped tomb, a stairway to heaven. As the sun god Re became the dominant\ndeity in Egypt some of the pharaohs proclaimed their divinity by adjoining the\nname of the sun god to their own: Khaef-Re and Menkau-Re for example. Also\nabout this time the tombs evolved into the smoothfaced, geometrically true\npyramid. It has been suggested that the pyramid was a material representation\nof the sun's rays along which the spirit of the deceased pharaoh ascended to\njoin the gods. A more recent theory explains the locations of the pyramids\nalong the Nile and the positions of their internal shafts bv reference to the\nstars. The transition from the step to the true pyramidal form occurred in the\nreign of Seneferu. The three pyramids that he erected show the various stages\nof development. The first structure started out as a step pyramid but at some\nstage the steps were filled in with rubble and the whole cased in limestone\ndiessed to form a true pyramid. On another site Seneferu built a second\npyramid which was intended to have the true form from the outset. However, the\nground underneath the pyramid was unable to withstand the pressure of the\nstones piled upon it, and before the pyramid was completed it started to\ncrack. The building work continued but, in an attempt to lessen the weight of\nthe remainder, the angle of slope was reduced from 54° to 43° producing an\nabrupt change of shape midway up the pyramid. Having failed, Seneferu tried\nagain, building a third pyramid next to the disfigured one. This time he was\nsuccessful and produced the pyramid with the gentlest incline of any now\nknown: 43° compared to the more usual 52° of later pyramids. Seneferu's son\nand successor was Khufu (or Cheops in Greek) who is famous for erecting the\nGreat Pyramid at Giza. The two other pyramids in the Giza group were built by\nKhaefre (Chephren) and Menkaure (Mycerinus). These edifices are colossal.\nWhile on his expedition to Egypt at the end of the eighteenth century,\nNapoleon Bonaparte is said to have calculated that these three mountains of\nstone contain enough material to build a wall along the entire French frontiei\nten feet high and one foot thick. The mathematician Gaspard Monge, who\naccompanied him, is said to have confirmed his calculation. Work on the\nconstruction of the pyramids was probably carried out during\n\nEgyptian geometry 19 the summer months. The cycle of life in Egypt was\ndictated by the river Nile. It provided an artery for commerce, and made\ncultivation possible along a narrow strip of land. Each year, between August\nand October, the river would rise and flood the surrounding area. After the\nwater had receded, it became possible to grow crops, but by March, the ground\nhad dried to a hard-baked mud. When farming became infeasible, the people who\nworked the land were available to quarry, transport and position the many tons\nof stone required to build each pyramid. Without the existence of such a large\nlabour force of peasants and enslaved foreigners it seems unlikely that such\nhuge structures could have been erected. The very existence of the pyramids is\na testament to the immense power exercised by the pharaohs. The shape of a\npyramid is extremely helpful in reducing the effort required to raise stone\nfor fewer blocks are required at each course. Over 87 percent of the volume of\nthe pyramid is in the bottom half. Even so, the pyramids remain a remarkable\nachievement. They display a high standard of craftsmanship. The stones could\nbe cut with great precision. The Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie found that\nthe average gap along joints between the casing stones of the Great Pyramid is\none-fiftieth of an inch. The bases of the pyramids are levelled to very high\naccuracy, and they are almost perfect squares. What level of mathematics did\nthe Egyptians possess to plan and construct such structures? What did they\nknow of the geometry of a pyramid? Egyptian geometry Our knowledge of Egyptian\nmathematics comes largely from papyri that have been preserved by the dryness\nof the desert climate. They contain various problems of a practical nature:\nthe distribution of wages, the conversion of units, the calculation of areas\nand volumes; together with exercises in the use of fractions. The principal\ndifficulty in all the problems is the calculation itself. In plane geometry\nthe Egyptians knew formulae to find the areas of basic polygons: rectangles\n(length x breadth) and triangles (xjibase x height). To calculate the area of\na circle they squared 8/g of its diameter. This rule is equivalent to using a\nvalue of approximately 3.16 for ir—a contrast to other early civilisations who\ntook n to be 3. They knew how to calculate the area of a trapezium and seem to\nhave applied a similar idea to quadrilaterals in general: they took the area\nto be the product of the averages of the lengths of the two pairs of opposite\nsides (see Figure 1.1). The result produced by this procedure is usually too\nlarge. And yet, 200 years after Euclid taught in Alexandria, this inaccurate\nformula was still in use. It appears among the inscriptions on the Temple of\nHorus at Edfu which records events in the first century BC. In solid geometry,\nthe volumes of cylinders, barns, and beams were evaluated\n\n20 Chapter 1 b area= '/2(a+b)h Figure 1.1. Egyptian formulae for finding the\narea of a trapezium and a general quadrilateral. The second is incorrect. as\nthe product of the area of a cross-section and the length (or height). The\ndifficulty of the calculation lies in the conversion of units—from volume to\ngrain measures, for instance. It is generally accepted (on indirect evidence)\nthat the Egyptians could find the volume of a pyramid, and that they also had\na rudimentary notion of trigonometry which allowed them to express the degree\nof slope, or gradient, of a pyramid. Since the Egyptians did not possess a\nsymbolic notation in which to express their formulae, they had to give a\nseries of worked examples—special cases with particular numbers rather than\nthe general case. The same example would be used in different contexts. For\ninstance, problems 57 and 58 of the Rhind mathematical papyrus both deal with\nthe same pyramid. In the former problem, the height and base are the data and\nthe slope is calculated; in the latter, the height is the unknown quantity.\nProblem 56 also concerns the slope of a pyramid. It reads as follows: Example\nof reckoning a pyramid, height 250, base 360 cubits. What is its slope? Find\nhalf of 360: 180 Divide 180 by 250: \\ + £ + ^ cubits Now a cubit is 7 palms.\nThen multiply 7 by \\ + ± + ^ [calculation omitted] 5^r palms. This is its\nslope.b The result means that the pyramid rises 1 cubit for every 5^ palms\nhorizontally. area = >/2 (a+b) '/2 (c+d)\n\nEgyptian geometry 21 The calculation of ^|jj results in the reciprocal of what today is called the gradient. Alternatively, it can be thought of as the cotangent of the dihedral angle between a face and the base. Notice that they only used fractions whose numerators were 1. The final part of the calculation alters the units of the measurement. The measurements used in the problem are realistic. In the following table they are compared to those of the Giza pyramids. Khufu Khaefre Menkaure Problem 56 Height 147m 144m 66m 131m Base 230m 216m 108m 188m Slope 51°52' 52°20' 50°47' 54°14' Another papyrus also contains a problem relating to the geometry of a pyramid. The fourteenth problem of the Moscow mathematical papyrus is concerned with the volume of a truncated pyramid. This solid is sometimes called the frustum of a pyramid (from the Latin word for 'fragment'). The papyrus itself is about 8cm wide and over 5m long. It contains 25 problems, many of which are unclear because the papyrus is damaged. Figure 1.2 shows the portion containing problem 14. The text is written in hieratic script, a simplified form of hieroglyphics. In the hieroglyphic transcription shown beneath, the numbers in the problem can be picked out: the symbols D and I stand for tens and units respectively. The text is read from right to left. An English translation reads as follows: Method of calculating a truncated pyramid. If you are told: a truncated pyramid of 6 cubits in height, of 4 cubits on the base, by 2 on top You are to square this 4: result 16 You are to double this 4: result 8 You are to square 2: result 4 Add together this 16, the 8 and the 4: result 28 Take | of 6: result 2 Take 28 twice: result 56. See, it is 56—you have found it right.' By following the instructions we obtain two intermediate results. Firstly 4x4 + 2x4 + 2x2 = 16 + 8 + 4 = 28 and then i/3 x 6 = 2. Combining these gives the volume as 2 x 28 = 56 cubic cubits.\n\n22 Chapter 1 Replacing the specific measurements by the symbols h, b and a for\nthe height, base and top, respectively, we find that the algorithm evaluates\nthe sum 1/3/1 (b2 + ba + a2) which is the standard formula for the volume of a\ntruncated pyramid. As a corollary of this example, one is led to believe that\nthe Egyptians must also have known the formula for the volume of a complete\npyramid (L/$ hi)2) but there is no specific example where it has been used.\nHow did the Egyptians discover their formulae and algorithmic procedures? In\ngeneral, we cannot answer this question since the papyri are not concerned\nwith such things. They contain neither motivation, nor any justification to\nvalidate the methods they describe. Their principal function is to communicate\nknowledge of a technique or the rules of calculation to be followed in\nparticular circumstances. The Egyptians did not possess a notation in which\nthey could express general formulations of their results: They were a people\nwho had no plus, minus, multiplication, or division signs, no equals or\nsquare-root signs, no zero, no decimal point, no coinage, no indices, and no\nmeans of writing the common fraction Courtesy of the State Pushkin Museum of\nFine Arts, Moscow. Figure 1.2. Problem 14 from the Moscow papyrus.\n\nBabylonian geometry 23 This lack of notation was overcome by giving several\nworked examples of a similar nature using different numbers to illustrate the\nmethod of solving a particular type of problem. They expected that the general\nprocedure would be abstracted from sufficiently many specific examples. In\nthese non-symbolic descriptions, the values were taken to be typical; other\nvalues can be substituted so that the general case becomes apparent. However,\ndescriptions of procedures cannot establish the universal validity of a\nformula. Moreover, in some cases, a systematic derivation of a procedure is\nnot possible since the resulting formula is either an approximation (as in the\ncase of the area of a circle) or wrong (the area of a general quadrilateral).\nBabylonian geometry An ancient civilisation also developed in Mesopotamia, the\nfertile plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, now part of Iraq. The\nmathematics of the Babylonians, along with other records, is preserved in the\nform of clay tablets. These tablets were inscribed with wedge-shaped signs by\npressing a stylus into the surface of the soft clay. The script is now called\ncuneiform from 'cuneus', the Latin word for wedge. The extant tablets come\nfrom two distinct periods: most date from 1800- 1600BC, a few from 300bc-0ad.\nThe mathematical tablets can be separated into problem texts and tables. The\nlatter include multiplication tables, lists of squares, cubes, square roots,\nreciprocals, and so on. Some of the problem texts contain examples of\nelementary geometry. In plane geometry, the Babylonians knew formulae for\nfinding the areas of rectangles, triangles and trapeziums. In many of the\nproblems concerning circles a bad approximation is used: for instance, the\narea is taken to be one-twelth of the square of the circumference, which is\nequivalent to using 3 for 7r. It is obvious that this value for n is too small\nsince the perimeter of a regular hexagon is three times the diameter of its\ncircumcircle. One tablet containing a list of numbers has been interpreted as\na list of approximations to the ratios of area to length-of-side for regular\npolygons of up to seven sides. It also contains a comparison of the perimeters\nof a hexagon and its circumcircle which leads to a value of 3^8 for 7r. In\nsolid geometry, the Babylonians considered similar problems to the Egyptians.\nVolumes of prisms and cylinders were calculated as the product of base-area\nand height. There are also problems dealing with cones, pyramids, and their\nfrustums, although in these cases the wrong formulae seem to have been used.\nThe method .applied in most of these problems concerning frustums is to\naverage the areas of the top and base, then multiply by the height. This is\ncertainly wrong (even if we assume n to be 3) but it is analogous to the\nformula for the area of a trapezium. In one problem, the volume of a truncated\nsquare-based pyramid is\n\n24 Chapter 1 calculated as where the second term in the calculation is\nunclear, the text being damaged. This term has been interpreted in various\nways: possibly it reads in which case the formula is correct, but a more\nlikely reading is which is equivalent to the averaging procedure used in other\nproblems. Chinese geometry The Chinese are another ancient people who\ndeveloped mathematics at an early date. The oldest surviving and most\ninfluential of the ancient Chinese mathematics texts is the Chiu-Chang Suan-\nShu (Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art), also known as Chiu-Chang Suan-\nChing (Mathematical Manual in Nine Chapters). It is a collection of problems\nthat probably appeared in its current form in the first century AD but which\ncontains older material that some believe to date from the third century BC.\nEven by the third century AD, the origins of the work were uncertain. In the\npreface to his Commentary on the Nine Chapters (263ad) Liu Hui says that the\nclassics were either lost or destroyed when the emperor Ch'in Shih Huang\n(221-209BC) ordered the burning of all books in 213BC and the Nine Chapters\nwas compiled from the remains of works that survived. The fact that some\nproblems refer to contemporary events, ranks, or official titles which belong\nto particular periods helps to date the work and shows that different parts\nwere written at different times. The Nine Chapters contains a series of 246\nproblems together with their solutions. The problems are connected with day-\nto-day life and it seems that the book was intended as a handbook to be used\nby engineers, architects, and tradesmen. As in the Egyptian and Babylonian\ntexts, the problems are stated with definite numbers. The solutions, however,\nare presented as general procedures. Two of the nine chapters (I and V) treat\ngeometric subjects. The othei chapters deal with proportions, the distribution\nof wealth, taxation, and the solution of simultaneous linear equations. The\nfirst chapter, on surveying, gives rules for the calculation of areas: it\ndeals with triangles, rectangles, trapeziums, circles and their sectors, and\nannuli.\n\nChinese geometry 25 The ancient Chinese evaluated the area of a circle as\neither 3/i the square of the diameter, or l/u the square of the circumference.\nBoth of these formulae correspond to using the value 3 for n. Later Chinese\nmathematicians improved this approximation considerably. Chang Heng (78-139ad)\nused \\/l0 :¾ 3.16. Liu Hui described an iterative method to approximate a\ncircle by inscribed regular polygons. Starting with a regular hexagon, and\nrepeatedly doubling the number of sides so as to produce a regular polygon\neach time, he compared the perimeter of the resulting polygon with the\ndiameter of its circumcircle (see Figurel.3). The more times the process is\nrepeated, the more accurate the resulting value of n. After four iterations,\nthe polygon has 6 x 24 — 96 sides. This gives the1 value of 7r as 3.14, which\nis good enough for practical purposes. The fifth chapter 'Consultations on\nengineering works' concerns earthworks (walls, dykes, canals) and the labour\nrequired to construct them. It also contains the formulae giving the volumes\nof solids: prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones, truncated pyramids and cones,\nand a particular case of a tetrahedron. Although the solutions to the problems\nare given as general procedures, not as particular worked examples, there is\nno attempt to justify their correctness. In his Commentary on the Nine\nChapters, Liu Hui supplements the brief discussions in the original work with\narguments to demonstrate the validity of the algorithms. His explanations have\na high standard of logical rigour but he does not state explicitly all the\nassumptions on which his derivations are based. Consequently, his proofs\nretain the intuitive element which is often excised by the pedantic axiomatic\nstyle used in many modern textbooks. Figure 1.3. Approximations to the value\nof n can be calculated by comparing the perimeter of a regular polygon with\nthe diameter of its circumcircle.\n\n26 Chapter 1 To illustrate Liu's style of proof, the frustum of a square-based\npyramid will be used as an example. In his derivation of the formulae for the\nvolumes of solids Liu uses dissection arguments. This involves splitting up\nthe solid in question into pieces of known volume, then combining the formulae\nof the constituents to arrive at a formula for the whole. In order to describe\nthe dissection of a solid he uses a set of four standard blocks, each one unit\nin height, width and length. These are illustrated in Figure 1.4. Liu clearly\npossessed a set of such blocks and expected his reader to be familiar with\nthem. He calls them ch'i, a name usually used for the pieces in a board game\nsuch as chess, so it is possible that they were part of a game or puzzle with\na fairly wide circulation. cube ch'ien-tu yang-ma pieh-nao Figure 1.4. The\nfour Chinese blocks, known as ch'i, used by Liu Hui. By restricting his\ndissections to be composed of these blocks, Liu can treat only particular\ncases of the problems. In the case of a truncated pyramid, he considers the\nspecial case when the base is 3 units square, the top 1 unit square, and the\nheight is also 1 unit. Thus b = 3, a = 1 and h = 1. He needs to show that its\nvolume is 1/3 (ab + a2 + b2) h. This particular truncated pyramid can be\ndissected as a cube (in the centre) surrounded by four ch'ien-tu (the wedges\nat the sides) and four yang-ma (one at each corner). Figure 1.5 illustrates\nthis dissection. Figure 1.5. Liu's dissection of a truncated pyramid into\nch'i.\n\nChinese geometry 27 Liu considers each of the terms abh, b2h and a2h in turn\nfinding collections of ch'i that have these volumes. The demonstration is\ncompleted by observing that these same pieces can be arranged to form three\nfrustums. Firstly, to construct a figure whose volume is equal to the product\nof the top and base dimensions together with the height, Liu takes the central\ncube and the four ch'ien-tu. These blocks can be rearranged to form a\nrectangular prism whose dimensions are a, b and h (see Figure 1.6). To form a\nfigure of volume b2h Liu builds up the truncated pyramid with extra blocks to\nmake a cuboid. A ch'ien-tu matched with each one in the dissection fills in\neach side; and two yang-ma can be placed at each corner to complete the prism.\n(That three yang-ma can be fitted together in this situation to form a cube is\nfortuitous—a general cuboid cannot be dissected into three congruent\npyramids.) The figure is then composed of 12 yang-ma, 8 ch'ien-tu and a cube.\nThe central cube in the dissection provides a figure whose volume is a'2h. We\nnow see that the expression abh + b2h + a2h is the volume of cube + 4 ch'ien-\ntu + cube + 8 ch'ien-tu + 12 yang-ma -I- cube = 3 (cube + 4 ch'ien-tu + 4\nyang-ma) or, in other words, three times the volume of the original figure—the\ntiuncated pyramid. ■ Liu has only dealt with the particular case when b = 3, a\n= 1 and h, = 1. In the general case when a, b, and h are arbitrary the\ndissection of the frustum can still be performed: the central block becomes a\nsquare-based prism; the other blocks are also stretched or squashed.\nRearranging the pieces of the dissection is now not quite so easy. The ch'ien-\ntu can still be fitted together. The vang-ma, however, cannot. Liu shows\nelsewhere that the volume of a yang-ma is one-third Figure 1.6.\n\n28 Chapter 1 of the product of its dimensions. In general, this is not easy to\nprove but, in the special case of the dissection into standard blocks, it is\nsimple to demonstrate since three of the yang-ma blocks can be placed together\nto form a cube1 as shown in Figure 1.7. Figure 1.7. Dissection of a cube into\nthree yang-ma pyramids A common origin for oriental mathematics Even though\nthe early civilisations were separated by vast distances, their mathematics\nhas much that is common. Examples of these similarities appeared in the\ngeometry discussed above. The Egyptians, the Babylonians, and the Chinese all\ntreat similar problems with a similar style of approach. Their mathematics\ntexts take the form of problems with solutions. The volumes of elementary\nsolids such as beams and cylinders are a common feature; perhaps more\nsurprising is that they all treat frustums of pyramids or cones. Some of the\nsimilarities seem to be more than just coincidences. One Babylonian tablet has\nthe same contents as the fifth of the Chinese Nine Chapters: both texts start\nwith problems on dams, walls and the number of men required for constructions,\nand then treat the volumes of solids. Another link between the Babylonians and\nthe Chinese is that both use the formula ' l/\\2 the square1 of the\ncircumference' to find the area of a circle. These similarities are just a few\nof many that have been catalogued by B. L. van der Waerden covering diverse\nareas of mathematics. These parallels led him to conclude that the mathematics\nof these three cultures, and of India as well, is interrelated and derives\nfrom a common source. Traditionally, scholars have taken the view that\nmathematics originated in the Near East and was subsequently developed and\ntransmitted to Europe, India and China. Van der Waerden maintains that since,\nfor example, the correct formula for the volume of a frustum appears in China\nand Egypt but not in Babylonia, the common source cannot be Babylonian. He\nfavours an earlier period: I have ventured a tentative reconstruction of a\nmathematical science\n\nGreek mathematics and the discovery of incommensurability 29 which must have\nexisted in the Neolithic Age, say between 3000 and 2500BC, and spread from\nCentral Europe to Great Britain, to the Near East, to India, and to China* He\nsuggests that the mathematical knowledge which existed at this time was\ntransmitted by means of problems with solutions and worked examples, that this\ntradition is preserved in the texts of the early cultures, and that the\nChinese have kept the most faithful copy of this early mathematics for they\nhave retained the geometrical imagery and many details whereas the others have\nrecorded only the rules and procedures. However, these conclusions are still\nthe subject of debate. Greek mathematics and the discovery of\nincommensurability The characteristic of Greek mathematics which distinguishes\nit from that, of earlier cultures is the notion of proof. It is uncertain\nwhether early civilisations could even formulate propositions in a general\ncontext, and there are no traces of deductive arguments being used to justify\nmethods in any pre-Hellenic culture. In all ancient mathematics there is just\na description of a process, often given as a sequence of worked examples. The\nGreeks not only stated general propositions but furnished them with rational\narguments to demonstrate their validity. Why did they find it necessary to\nprovide statements with proofs? One possibility is that it started as a way of\njudging between the various results they collected abroad. The Greeks\nthemselves wrote that the orient was a major source of material for their\nmathematics and other sciences. There are tales that many of the influential\nGreek mathematicians travelled widely: Thales, Pythagoras, Democritus, and\nEudoxus are all reputed to have visited Babylon, Egypt, and possibly as far\nafield as India. Comparing the methods used by different cultures dealing with\nsimilar problems would have shown up discrepancies and inconsistencies. Which\nof the formulae for the volume of a truncated pyramid is correct: the Egyptian\nor the Babylonian? There was also the need to distinguish between formulae\nthat gave exact results and those giving approximations. Given two\napproximations it would also be helpful to determine the relative accuracy of\nthe different techniques. The knowledge gained through travels in foreign\nlands would have consisted solely of the procedures to be followed in\nparticular circumstances. Any arguments that had been used in the past to\nderive the formulae or establish their correctness would have been long\nforgotten. The earliest proofs probably consisted in drawing diagrams which\nexhibited the desired result and reasoning from them. The Greek term for 'to\nprove1' can be translated as 'to show', 'to point out' or 'to explain'. Thus,\none pointed out reasons for believing a statement to be true. Initially, the\narguments would have made a large use of visual evidence either in dissection\narguments where a figure\n\n30 Chapter 1 was subdivided to illustrate interrelationships, or by the use of\nsuperposition to show the equality of different parts. The word 'theorem' is\nderived from the Greek for 'to look at'. Later proofs were semantic in nature\nrelying on the meanings of words: 'odd', 'even' and 'add' for example.\nAlthough particular cases of propositions involving odd or even numbers can be\nillustrated by arranging pebbles in rows, the arguments used to justify the\ngeneral case need to be visualised in the mind. This helped to develop the\nability to reason about abstract objects. Without abstract thought, such\ncounter-intuitive results as the existence of incommensurable line segments\ncould not have been discovered. Common sense tells us that any two lines we\ndraw will be integral multiples of some common unit segment. But quite early\non in Greek history, certainly by the end of the fifth century BC, people had\nfound that some pairs of lines have no common measure—a discovery which pushed\nmathematics further away from empiricism and towards abstraction. The\nPythagoreans had a doctrine that 'number is the essence of all things', by\nwhich they meant that everything could be explained using ratios of whole\nnumbers. This belief was strengthened by (or perhaps derived from) the\ndiscovery that consonant musical intervals fit into such a pattern. The\nproblem of incommensurability becomes apparent when this theory is applied to\ngeometry, for the lines in some basic figures do not conform to such a rule.\nThe ratio of the lengths of the side and diagonal of a square (or,\nequivalently, the sides of a right-angled isosceles triangle) cannot be\nexpressed using integers. A very early proof, if not the original\ndemonstration, of the incommensurability of the side and diagonal of a square\nhas been preserved in an appendix to the tenth book of Euclid's Elements. It\nuses an arithmetic argument based on the properties of odd and even numbers.\nIt shows that if the two lengths were commensurable then a number would exist\nwhich is both odd and even -an impossibility. This indirect method of proof\nrequires strict logical reasoning and it is only when the contradiction is\nreached that the hypothesis is established. This has led some scholars to\nsuggest that the initial discovery of incommensin ability was made in a\ndifferent context. Kurt von Fritz writes It is difficult to believe that the\nearly Greek mathematicians should have discovered the incommensurability of\nthe diameter of a square with its side by a process of reasoning which was\nobviously so laborious for them if they had no previous suspicion that any\nsuch thing as incommensurability existed at all. If, on the other hand, they\nhad already discovered the fact in a simpler way, it is perfectly in keeping\nwith what we know of their methods to assume that they at once made every\neffort to find out whether there were other cases of incommensurability. The\nisosceles right-angled triangle in that case was the natural first object of\ntheir further investigations/\n\nGreek mathematics and the discovery of incommensurability 31 The problem is\nthat the proof is an 'all or nothing' affair. There is no intuitive basis to\nguide the reasoning, no picture to suggest the result is true. In general, the\nway a mathematical result is discovered and the form in which it is presented\nare not the same. A formal proof is constructed 'after the event'. Prior to\nthis, the result must have been understood on an intuitive level. There is\nnearly always a picture of what is going on. It may have suggested the result,\nand then guided attempts to find a proof. Unfortunately, in the final proof,\nthis initial insight is often lost, smothered in a mass of detail. The\nquestion is: What image aroused the suspicion that some line segments may not\nhave a common measure? The side and diagonal of a square are used as the\narchetypal example of incommensurable lines throughout Greek writings to such\nan extent that thev were1 probably also the first example. However, von Fritz\nand others have proposed that the initial discovery could have involved the\ngolden ratio. Line segments in this ratio can be proved incommensurable by\ngeometric arguments. Furthermore, the geometry of the regular pentagon leads\nto the kind of suggestive image we seek. A pentagram is the star-shaped figure\nformed by the set of diagonals of a regular pentagon. In the middle of a\npentagram, the lines bound anothei pentagon. The possibility of repeatedly\ninscribing pentagrams inside one another is the key element in the proof of\nthe following theorem. Theorem. The side and diagonal of a pentagon are\nincommensurable. Proof: Let s\\ and d\\ denote the side and diagonal\nrespectively of the pentagon ABCDE (see Figure 1.8). By using elementary\ngeometry, in particular the properties of isosceles triangles, it is easy to\nshow that AB = AL and LC = LN. Let s2 and d2 denote the side and diagonal of\nthe inner pentagon JKLMN. Then, since AC = AL + LC = AB + LN, we have rfi = si\n+ d2. Rearranging, we get that dx - si = d2. Hence, if d\\ and S\\ have a common\nmeasure then this unit will also measure d2. We also have that AK = LC = LN\nand AL = AB. So AL = AK + KL & AB = LN + KL & Si = d2 + 6'2 & si - d2 = s2.\n\n32 Chapter 1 Figure 1.8. Since we know that a common measure for si and d\\\nwould also measure d2, this last equality shows that it would measure s2 as\nwell. Therefore, s2 and d2 can be measured with the same unit as si and d\\\\.\nThis process can be repeated to produce a ceaseless stream of smaller and\nsmaller pentagons. A line segment which is a common measure for the side and\ndiagonal of the initial pentagon ABCDE would also measure the sides and\ndiagonals of all the smaller pentagons. Since these can be made as small as\ndesired, this is clearly impossible. Hence such a measuring segment cannot\nexist and si and d\\ are incommensurable.1 ■ Tradition assigns the discovery of\nincommensurability to the Pythagorean Hippasus of Metapontum (early fifth\ncentury bc). The Pythagoreans were familiar with regular polygons such as the\npentagon, and also with the pentagram, or star pentagon, which they used as a\nbadge of recognition. An argument such as that used to prove the preceding\ntheorem could have been understood by the Pythagoreans. It uses only the basic\npropositions of geometry: such fundamental results as the angle sum of a\ntriangle and the properties of isosceles triangles. These results would have\nbeen known in Hippasus' time even if the arguments used to justify them were\nprimitive and not up to the standards demanded by later mathematicians. All\nthat was necessary was to present an argument which would convince its\nintended audience. That Hippasus managed to demonstrate the existence of\nincommensurables to his contemporaries is supported by the legend that he\nperished at sea. Some versions say that he was punished by the gods for having\ndone violence to the 1A similar argument for showing that the side and\ndiagonal of a square are incommensurable is given in T. L. Heath, The Thirteen\nBooks of Euclid's Elements, Cambridge Univ. Press 1908, volume 3, ppl9-20.\n\nThe nature of space 33 Pythagorean dream with the introduction of\n'inexpressible' ratios, others that he attempted to take glory in his\ndiscovery when traditionally all results were ascribed to Pythagoras himself,\nor that he betrayed the secret knowledge outside the brotherhood. The\ndiscovery of incommensurability must have been a huge shock to the\nPythagoreans for it demolished their belief that everything could be expressed\nin integer ratios. It is remarkable that this one result sufficed to end\nPythagorean numerology, especially when it is realised that incommensurability\nonly makes sense as a part of pure geometry, as an abstract notion in the\nrealm of ideas. Incommensurability can only be justified by theoretical\nconstructions, never by empirical methods or visual evidence. In a practical\nsense, the process of constructing ever smaller pentagons must terminate\nbecause, at, some stage, it becomes physically impossible to construct any\nmore. When this happens, the side and diagonal of the pentagon can be\nconsidered equal for any practical puipose. However, when considered in a\nmathematical context, the construction is ideal, and it is theoretically\npossible to continue the process indefinitely, constructing a never-ending\nsequence of ever-smaller pentagons. This confrontation between practical\nexperience and mathematical idealism pushed mathematics further towards the\nabstract. The visual evidence contained in diagrams could no longer be relied\nupon; empirical methods were rejected as people sought a more intellectual\napproach. The nature of space The discovery that some geometrical figures\ncontain lines which are incommensurable focused attention on the properties of\nspace. In particular, the pioblem of whether space can be continually\nsubdivided or whether it ultimately becomes indivisible occupied the\nphilosophers. The notion that a line is composed of points underlies our\nunderstanding of the terms 'line' and 'point'. Their meanings are derived from\nthe experience of drawing diagrams. The dot which we make to represent a point\nhas a certain size. But is the mathematical idealisation abstracted from it\nextended in space? Early Greek philosophers seem to have regarded it so. This\nimparts a gianular structure to space. If space is quantised into discrete\nunits then a line contains only finitely many points. Assuming such points to\nbe uniform in size, all lines would be commensurable, and the calculation of\narea or volume would be reduced to counting the number of atomic constituents.\nThe hypothesis that space is composed of extended indivisible units is called\nthe discrete theory. The alternative, called the continuous theory, is to\nassume that space can be subdivided indefinitely. A consequence of this is\nthat any line segment, no matter how small, contains infinitely many points.\n\n34 Chapter 1 Early Chinese philosophers seem to have recognised the two\nalternative theories. The following passage from the Mo Ching, a text believed\nto date from C.330BC, attempts to define a point in the discrete theory of\nspace: If you cut a length continually in half, you go on forward until you\nreach the position that the middle [of the fragment] is not big enough to be\nseparated any more into halves; and then it is a point. ■ • ■ Or, if you keep\non cutting into half, you will come to a stage in which there is an 'almost\nnothing', and since nothing cannot be halved, this can no more be cut.9\nAnother writer describes the continuous theory: A one foot-long stick, though\nhalf of it is taken away each day, cannot be exhausted in ten thousand\ngenerations.11 The famous paradoxes of the Greek Zeno of Elea (c.490-c.425bc)\nconcern the problem of the divisibility of space and time. It is difficult to\nidentify the original thrust of the thought experiments Zeno described since\nthey only survive in abbreviated accounts by later writers. He seems to parody\nboth the discrete and continuous theories and deduces that the concept of\nmotion is inconceivable. In the 'paradox of the runner' Zeno argues against\nthe continuous theory of space. In order to run from A to B, the runner must\nfirst reach the point halfway between. He must then reach the midpoint of the\nremaining distance, and so on passing a never-ending sequence of midpoints.\nThus, to complete the course, the runner has to cover infinitely many distinct\ndistances. Zeno felt that if something involved infinity then he had reached a\ncontradiction. In the 'paradox of the arrow' he argues against the discrete\ntheory of space and time. Under this hypothesis, motion would consist of a\nsuccession of small jerks. At each instant of time, the arrow is in a\nparticular place. What distinguishes a moving arrow from a stationary one? How\ndoes the arrow 'know' whether or not to jerk forward at the next instant? When\na thought experiment reaches a puzzling or nonsensical conclusion it often\npays to examine the underlying assumptions on which it is based. If the\nreasoning is correct then what appears at first sight to be paradoxical may be\nresolved if the hypotheses are modified or replaced. The new hypotheses may\nseem strange; we may need to abandon a cherished belief; the conclusion may be\nsurprising. Yet, if such changes make the argument consistent, it is an\nindication that our intuitive understanding may be at fault. The Greeks found\nthe concept of infinity disturbing. They tried to separate notions involving\nthe infinite into 'potentially infinite' and 'actually infinite'. An example\nof the distinction is as follows: A line segment is bounded and of finite\nlength. It can be extended by any finite amount an unlimited number of times.\n\nDemocritus' dilemma 35 The line can be made as long as required but, at every\nstage, the line always has a definite length. This is a potential infinity. To\nconsider the 'whole line1 would be using an actual or completed infinity. In\nhis runner paradox, Zeno expressed a finite line segment as a sum of\ninfinitely many shorter segments—as a completed infinity. Although this may be\ndisquieting, it is a consequence of the continuous theory of space. If we\nassume that any line segment, no matter how small, can be divided to produce\ntwo shorter segments then we are forced to accept that a line segment contains\ninfinitely many points arranged in a continuum. The alternative hypothesis\n(the discrete theory) leads to an even nioie puzzling situation. Zeno's arrow\nparadox leads to the conclusion that rest and motion are indistinguishable. We\ncannot tell whether a body is in motion or not until the next instant arrives\nand we can see whether it is occupying the same position. In the realm of\nmathematics and ideal constructions the continuous theory is used. The\npeculiar nature of this mathematical myth is neatly summed up by Aristotle:\nThe continuum is that which is divisible into indivisibles that fire\ninfinitely divisible.1 Democritus' dilemma The problem of repeated subdivision\narose not only in plane geometrv with the construction of ever-smaller\npentagons and line segments. It also appealed in solid geometry in the\ncalculation of volumes. Democritus of Abdera (late fifth century BC) took an\ninterest in both science and mathematics. Although none of his works survives,\nhe is known to have discussed the atomic theory of matter and contributed to\nthe debate on the divisibility of space. He is said to have regarded a sphere\nas being really a polyhedron with imperceptibly small faces. This idea is\nprobably connected with the atomic theory of matter rather than space. A\nmaterial sphere composed of indivisible atoms would presumably have this\nproperty; a mathematical spheie is an ideal object with a perfectly smooth\ncurved surface. The distinction between mathematical objects and their\nimperfect material counterparts was discussed by Plato (427-347BC) but was\ncertainly known earlier. According to Archimedes, it was Democritus who first\nunderstood the problem of finding the volume of a pyramid though his arguments\ndid not constitute a rigorous proof. The Greeks had no word for volume and so\nthey used the name of the object itself to denote its quantity. Thus in Greek\nmathematics, the pyramid formula is expressed as: 'A pyramid is one third of\nthe prism having the same base-area and height'.\n\n36 Chapter 1 Suppose, for the moment, that the volume of a pyramid is\nproportional to its base-area and height. (In the light of other volume\nformulae, this is not unreasonable.) If we let V, A and h denote the volume,\nbase-area, and height of a pyramid then we have assumed that V = k Ah, where k\nis the constant of proportionality. Now, Ah is the volume of a prism whose\nbase-area is A and whose height is h. There is a straightforward argument\nwhich shows that k = l/z. Theorem. The volume of a pyramid is one-third the\nvolume of a prism having the same base and equal height. Proof: Since any\npolygon can be split up into triangles, it is sufficient to prove the theorem\nfor triangular-based pyramids as any other pyramid can be split up into these.\nThe triangular prism ABCPQR can be dissected into three pyramidal pieces as\nshown in Figure 1.9. If we can show that all three pieces have the same volume\nthen it follows that each pyramid has one-third the volume of the prism.\nFigure 1.9. Dissection of a prism into three pyramids. We are assuming that\nthe volume of a pyramid is proportional to the product of its base-area and\nheight. Thus pyramids whose bases and heights are equal will have equal\nvolumes. First we show that the pyramids ABCR and PQRB have the same volume.\nRegard the former as having base ABC and apex R, and the latter as having base\nPQR and apex B. Then, since the bases are opposite faces of the prism, they\nhave equal area. The heights are equal since they are the height of the prism.\nAs the bases and heights are equal, the volumes must also be equal. To show\nthat the third pyramid has the same volume as the others, we regard the\npyramid BPQR as having base BPQ and apex R, and the third pyramid as having\nbase APB and apex R. Since the bases are each half the rectangle ABQP they\nhave equal area. And since the bases are coplanar and R is the apex of both\npyramids, their heights are equal. Hence, they have equal volumes. Thus the\nthree pyramids have equal volumes. ■\n\nDemocritus' dilemma 37 It remains to show that the assumption on which this\ntheorem rests is valid: that the volume of a pyramid is proportional to its\nbase-area and height. This is not easy to justify rigorously. There is,\nhowever, an intuitive argument that makes the result seem plausible. If we\nimagine two pyramids having the same base and equal height, each being divided\nup into thin laminae, then, since the sections at equal heights will be\ncongruent (why?), they will have the same volume (Figure 1.10). Therefore, the\nwholes are identical sums of equal volumes, and are therefore equal. Figure\n1.10. Layers at equal heights are congruent. Sliding the layers over one\nanother suggests that the pyramids have equal volume. However, in order for\nsuch a procedure to be 'accurate' the sections must be 'infinitesimally thin'\nand consequently the pyramid is composed of infinitely many such layers. Again\nwe run into the problem of the continuity of space. What is the 'volume' of\neach elemental section which has no thickness? Although this thought\nexperiment does not furnish a rigorous proof, it does give an indication of\nwhat might be proved. This is important, for it is easier to supply a proof\nwhen, from previous experience or reflection, a particular result is expected\nto be true. Archimedes writes It is easier to supply the proof when we have\npreviously acquired • ■ • some knowledge of the questions than it is to End it\nwithout any previous knowledge. That is the reason why, in the case of the\ntheorems the proofs of which Eudoxus was Erst to discover, namely on the cone\nand the pyramid, that the cone is one-third of the cylinder and the pyramid\none-third of the prism having the same base and equal height, no small share\nof the credit should be given to Democritus, who was the Erst to state the\nfact about the said Egure[s], though without proofJ And, as we shall see\nlater, in order to apply Eudoxus' method of proof, it is necessary to know a\npriori what answer is expected. That Democritus argued along lines similar to\nthose outlined above is suggested in a passage in Plutarch's De Communibus\nNotitiis Adversus Stoicos (in\n\n38 Chapter 1 which he argued against the common notions used by the Stoic\nphilosophers). He records that Democritus raised the following question: If a\ncone were cut by a plane parallel to the base, what must we think of the\nsurfaces of the sections, that they are equal or unequal? For if they are\nunequal, they will make the cone irregular, as having many indentations, like\nsteps, and unevennesses; but, if they are equal the sections will be equal,\nand the cone will appear to have the property of the cylinder and to be made\nup of equal, not unequal circles, which is very absurd.k The idea that a solid\nis a sum of infinitely many plane sections, all parallel and of negligible\nthickness, clearly underlies Democritus' argument. His dilemma again centres\non the difference between atomism and continuity. Some sav that in this\npassage Democritus is not posing a genuine dilemma but is arguing for the\natomic theory of matter: a cone is obviously not a cylinder and therefore it\nmust have 'steps'. However, his statement applies equally well to ideal\nmathematical cones and imperfect physical ones. This single fragment does not\ntell us the nature of Democritus' discussions or his conclusions, only that he\nwas aware of the conceptual difficulties involved in one of the major problems\noccupying the philosophers of his time. Liu Hui on the volume of a pyramid\nEarlier we saw how Liu Hui derived the formula for the volume of a truncated\npyramid by dissecting it into a central square-based prism, four ch'ien-tu and\nfour yang-ma. The formulae for the prism and the ch'ien-tu are straightforward\nto demonstrate. Justifying the formula for the yang-ma proves to be more\ndifficult. The procedure described in the Nine Chapters is to multiply the\nbreadth and length together, multiply by the height, then divide by three.\nLiu's commentary on the problem gives an ingenious method for proving this\nformula is correct. It involves the use of repeated dissection which gives\nrise to a never-ending process. Not surprisingly, Liu has some problems trying\nto express what ultimately happens as the pieces become unimaginably minute.\nThat he presents any proof at all shows him to be one of the greatest masters\nof empirical geometry. The first part of the demonstration consists of fitting\ntogether a yang-ma with a pieh-nao as shown in Figure 1.11 to form a wedge (or\nch'ien-tu) whose volume is known to be lfa obh. If Y denotes the volume of the\nyang-ma, and P denotes the volume of the pieh-nao then Y + P= i/2 aWi. He\nwants to show that Y = 1/z abh. This would imply that P = % <ihh 01 that Y =\n2P. It is this last equality that Liu attempts to demonstrate.\n\nLiu Hui on the volume of a pyramid 39 & Figure 1.11. Dissection of a ch'ien-tu\ninto a yang-ma and a pieh-nao. He proceeds by subdividing the yang-ma and the\npieh-nao into smaller components. He writes To make a pieh-nao with breadth,\nlength, and height each 2 ch'ih,2 use two ch'ien-tu and two pieh-nao blocks,\nall of them red. To make a yang-ma with breadth, length, and height each 2\nch'ih, use one cubical block, two ch'ien-tu blocks, and two yang-ma blocks,\nall of them black. Joining together the red and black blocks to make a ch'ien-\ntu, the breadth, length and height are each 2 ch'ih.1 These dissections are\nillustrated in Figure 1.12. Figure 1.12. Subdivisions of the yang-ma and pieh-\nnao into smaller ch'ih. To show that Y = 2P we need to show that the volume of\nthe black pieces is twice the volume of the red pieces. Liu rearranges the\nblocks so that the volumes of the red and black pieces can be compared. The\ntwo red ch'ien-tu can be placed together to form a cube. Likewise, the two\nblack ch'ien-tu form a cube. The remaining pieces comprise the black cube, two\nblack yang-ma and two red pieh-nao. The four latter blocks can be fitted\ntogether to form a pair of ch'ien-tu coloured in the same way as the original\n2One ch'ih is about 21cm.\n\n40 Chapter 1 wedge. These two black-and-red wedges can be placed together to form a cube having the same volume as the three others. We have constructed four cubes: two black, one red, and one mixed. Thus three-quarters of the volume of the original ch'ien-tu is of known to be in the proportion black: red = 2:1. The remaining quarter of the volume comprises two black yang-ma and two red pieh-nao blocks. These fit together to produce two scaled down versions of the original black-and-red ch'ien-tu. The dissection process can be repeated on each of these wedges. This shows that three-quarters of the undetermined volume is in the ratio black: red = 2 :1. Therefore, we know that | + \\ x | of the volume is in the desired ratio; only | x | = ^ ^ left undetermined. By repeating this process indefinitely, continually subdividing the vang-ma and pieh-nao blocks, the unknown amount decreases, becoming arbitrarily small and tending to zero. Liu expresses this idea like this: To exhaust the calculation, halve the remaining breadth, length, and height; an additional three-quarters can thus be determined. The smaller they are halved, the finer are the remaining [parts]. The extreme of fineness is called \"subtle\" [or intangible]; that which is subtle is without form. When it is explained in this way, why concern oneself with the remainder?71 In another problem where Liu is approximating a curved figure by a polygonal one to determine its area, he makes a similar remark: Although there is something left over it is not worth mentioning.11 In the commentary to his translation of the derivation of the volume formula for the yang-ma, Donald Wagner explores the philosophy behind these ideas. The endless process of repeated subdivision is interpreted as follows. The more the pieces are subdivided, the smaller they become. Ultimately, they become intangible and formless. This limit does not comprise a collection of dimensionless, infinitely small yang-ma and pieh-nao but rather a collection of formless objects which are unimaginable and beyond description. It is meaningless to speak of their dimensions. As they cannot be examined, why bother with them'.'' These concepts are deeply rooted in Chinese philosophy. Wagner uses an extract from Chapter 14 of Lao Tsu's Tao Te Ching to illustrate the use of the ideas in another context:3 Looic, it cannot be seen—it is beyond form. Listen, it cannot be heard—it is beyond sound. 3I have chosen to use a different translation since I find this version more poetic than the one used by Wagner.\n\nEudoxus' method of exhaustion 41 Grasp, it cannot be held—it is intangible.\nThese three are indefinable; therefore they are joined in one. From above it\nis not bright; From below it is not dark: An unbroken thread beyond\ndescription. It returns to nothingness. The form of the formless The image of\nthe imageless It is called indefinable and beyond imagination0 Eudoxus' method\nof exhaustion The problem of how to treat the convergence of infinite\nprocesses rigorously was solved by Eudoxus of Cnidus (c.408-355bc). He was a\ncontemporary of Plato and contributed to the development of many fields\nincluding geometry, medicine and astronomy. His method bears the name of\n'exhaustion' but that is something of a misnomer. For although he uses the\nfact that, by repeated subdivision, the difference between an actual volume\nand a computable approximation to it can be made arbitrarily small, he does\nnot need to pursue the calculation to its limit and 'exhaust' the volume.\nRather, to prove that a solid has volume V, he shows that any value for the\nvolume other than V can be proved incorrect in finitely many steps. This\ntechnique was seen as an outstanding achievement. The attribution of the\ndiscovery of the method of exhaustion to Eudoxus was made by Archimedes who\nused it as a standard with which to compare his own work. He regarded his own\nwork On the Sphere and Cylinder as his most beautiful mathematical result, so\nmuch so that he requested to have a figure illustrating the result carved on\nhis tombstone. He wrote in the preface to this work that he had no hesitation\nin setting his results alongside those theorems of Eudoxus on solids which are\nheld to be most irrefragably established, namely that any pyramid is one third\npart of the prism which has the same base with the pyramid and equal height,\nand that any cone is one third part of the cylinder which has the same base\nwith the cone and equal height.13 In order to illustrate Eudoxus' method we\nneed a dissection of a pyramid into parts of known volume and a remainder\nwhich can be further subdivided. It is sufficient to consider only pyramids on\na triangular base for other pyramids can be produced as combinations of these.\nFigure 1.13 illustrates how a triangular- based pyramid can be dissected into\ntwo smaller pyramids, equal to each other and similar to the original one, and\ntwo prisms. The vertices of the component\n\n42 Chapter 1 pieces bisect the edges of the large pyramid. The volumes of the\ntwo prisms are equal, and together they occupy more than half the volume of\nthe pviamid. Furthermore, it is possible to show that the volumes of these\nprisms depend only on the base-area and the height of the pyramid: if two\npyramids have bases of equal area and are of the same height, and if each of\nthem is dissected in this manner, then the resulting prisms all have the same\nvolume. Figure 1.13. Dissection of a pyramid into two similar pyramids and two\nprisms. As the two smaller pyramids are just scaled down versions of the\noriginal one, each of them can be subdivided to produce four more prisms and\nfoui more pyramids. This process can be continued indefinitely. We are now set\nup to use the 'method of exhaustion' to show that the volumes of two pyramids,\nequal in height, are in the same ratio as the areas of their bases. Hence,\nwhen the base-areas are equal, the two pyramids occupv equal volumes. As in\nthe previous theorem demonstrating the existence; of incommensurable\nmagnitudes, the indirect method of proof is used. The proof also relies on the\nfollowing 'axiom of continuity':4 Given two unequal quantities, U and V, where\nU is less than V, if wo remove at least half of V, then remove at least half\nof the remainder, and so on repeating the process continually, eventually wo\nwill roach a quantity less than U. In particular, suppose that a pyramid has\nvolume V, and that W is an approximation to V which underestimates the volume.\nThen we can choose U = V — W. In the dissection shown in Figure 1.13, the two\nprisms occupy more than half the volume. The axiom states that by repeatedly\ndissecting the resulting pyramids and removing the prisms, we shall eventually\narrive at a collection of pyramids whose total volume is less than U—the error\nin the approximation. 4 Although this form of the axiom is most convenient for\nuse here, it is worth noting that, simpler but equivalent statements have been\nproposed as substitutes. One such is duo to Archimedes: Given two unequal\nquantities, the larger exceeds the smaller by an amount which it lcpontcdlv\nadded to itself will exceed any prescribed quantity.\n\nElIDOXUS' METHOD OF EXHAUSTION 43 Theorem. Two triangular-based pyramids of\nequal height have their volumes in the same ratio as the areas of their bases.\nProof: Let Pi and P2 be two triangular-based pyramids of equal height whose\nbases have areas B\\ and B2, respectively. Let V\\ and V2 denote their\nrespective volumes. Then we need to show that the ratios B\\: B2 and V\\ : V2\nare equal. Suppose that this is not the case. Then there is some volume W such\nthat Bi : B2 = Vi : W. Since W is not equal to V2, it is either less than or\ngreater than V2. Suppose that W is less than V2. The pyramid P2 can be\ndissected into two prisms and two pyramids, the latter of which can be further\nsubdivided. The process can be repeated until the volume of the remaining\npyramids is less than V2 — W (applying the axiom of continuity). Then V2 >\n(volume of prisms in P2) > W. Partition the pyramid Pi in the same way\nrepeating the subdivision process the same number of times. Now, since the\nvolume of the prisms in such a dissection depends only on the height of the\npyramid and the area of its base, and since Pi and P2 have equal height,\n(volume of prisms in Pi) : (volume of prisms in P2) — B\\ : B2. By hypothesis\nPi : B2 = VX:W so, consequently, (volume of prisms in P\\\\) :V\\ ~ (volume of\nprisms in P2) : W. But this leads to a contradiction since (volume of prisms\nin Pi) < V\\ which implies (volume of prisms in P2) < W, and, we know by\nconstruction that (volume of prisms in P2) > W. Therefore, the supposition\nthat W <V2 must be false. A similar contradiction can be derived if we assume\nthat W > Y2. Since W can be neither less than nor greater than V2, the two\nquantities must be equal. Hence BX:B2 = Vi : V2. ■\n\n44 Chapter 1 As a simple corollary to this theorem, we see that two\ntriangular-based pyramids of equal height and equal base-areas have equal\nvolumes. We saw earlier that from this key proposition, it is straightforward\nto show that a pyramid has one third the volume of a prism on the same base\nand equal height. Eudoxus' method was an outstanding achievement. However,\nalthough the method is remarkably ingenious, and neatly avoids the problem of\nnever-ending calculations, it suffers one major drawback: before the method\ncan be used it is necessary to know the target formula. A proof using the\nmethod of exhaustion proceeds by eliminating all possibilities except the\ndesired result, deriving a contradiction in a finite number of steps. Such a\nproof is non-constructive—-it does not produce an answer. The answer has to be\nknown in advance. Eudoxus' method is useless as a way of discovering new\nresults. It can only be used to provide rigorous justification for results\nalready suggested by other evidence1. How is such prior knowledge obtained?\nThought experiments of the kind we used earlier are one source of data.\nRegarding a pyramid as a stack of thin laminae suggested that its volume\ndepended only on its height and base measurements—not on its shape. We can\nimagine the pyramid as a stack of infinitely many planar sections so that we\nare no longer using an approximation but the actual volume. Arguments such as\nthis may not rest on such a logically firm foundation as Eudoxus' method does,\nbut they do have the big advantage of providing an answer. Furthermore, they\nprovide an intuitive picture of why the theorem is true, an element missing in\nthe rigorous proof. Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to prove many\ntheorems concerning the areas of curved regions and the volumes of solids. And\nalthough no-one could doubt the truth of his results, it was impossible to\ntell how he had discovered them. He later divulged his secret source in a\nletter to Eratosthenes. In it he described the kind of limiting process we\nused on the pyramid. We see again that, in mathematics, discovery and proof\nare frequently two different activities: 'Democritus has found the theorem,\nbut only Eudoxus has proved it'. Hilbert's third problem All the arguments\nseen so far which attempt to justify the validity of the formula for the\nvolume of a pyramid have one thing in common: they all make use of\ninfinitesimally small quantities and ability to go to a limiting case. Recall\nDemocritus' paradox of the cone: is it a cylinder or a 'devil's staircase'\nwhose steps are extremely thin? Liu Hui regarded the end of his dissection\nprocess as something formless, dimensionless, unimaginable and unexaminable.\nConsequently he asks 'Why concern oneself with it?'. Eudoxus' method of\nexhaustion requires\n\nHilbert's third problem 45 the existence of a procedure by which pieces of\narbitrarily small volume can be constructed. Does every proof justifying the\nvolume formula necessarily involve such complicated concepts, or is there a\nsubtle argument which avoids the use of limits and infinite processes? In the\ngeometry of plane figures such processes are not needed. If two polygons have\nthe same area then they are congruent by dissection or equidecomposable. This\nmeans that they can be dissected into the same set of pieces; they are both\nsolutions of a common jigsaw. Figure 1.14 shows dissections of some regular\npolygons which can be reassembled to form a square. In fact, to show that\nevery pair of polygons are equidecomposable, it suffices to show that any\npolygon is equidecomposable with a square since polygons that are\nequidecomposable to the same thing are equidecomposable with each other.\nFigure 1.14. This theorem, that any two polygons of equal area are congruent\nby dissection, was proved by several people working independently of one\nanother: William Wallace discovered the essential ideas in 1807, and Farkas\nBolyai (father of Janos Bolyai who did early work on non-Euclidean geometry)\nand P. Gerwien produced their proofs in the early 1830's. The dissections\nshown in Figure 1.14 are interesting in that they use small numbers of pieces.\nTo find a jigsaw with the minimum number of pieces requires great ingenuity.\nHowever, to prove that any polygon can be dissected and the pieces rearranged\nto form a square requires a general strategy that can be applied in all\nsituations. Such a process will not produce imaginative, minimal jigsaws. A\ndescription of one method for constructing a dissection is outlined in Figure\n1.15. Since any polygon can be converted into a square of equal area, and the\narea of a square is easily calculated, a theory of area measurement can be\ndeveloped without recourse to a limiting process. Is the same true for a\ntheory of volume?\n\n46 Chapter 1 Are any two polyhedra with the same volume equidecomposable? Can\na pyramid be dissected and reassembled to form a cube? Is it just that\nmathematicians have not been lucky enough to find, or crafty enough to devise,\na method for dissecting two given polyhedra into sets of equal pieces, or is\nsuch a task not always possible? First, separate the polygon into triangles. \\\nThe rectangle can be dissected into another rectangle, one of whose sides is\nthat of the desired square The rectangles produced from all the triangles are\nthen stacked together to form a square. Figure 1.15. How to dissect a polygon\ninto a square of equal area.\n\nHilbert's third problem 47 At the beginning of the twentieth century, David\nHilbert (1862-1943) compiled a list of 23 problems which he considered to be\nthe major unsolved 1)1()1)10108 of the time and which most deserved to be\nworked on in the dawning century. He presented them in a famous report to the\nsecond International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris in 1900. In his\nthird problem he called attention to the fact that some kind of limiting\nprocess seemed to be necessary to establish a theory of volume for polyhedra.\nThe essence of the problem was to justify the use of limits and show that\nwithout them a theory of volume is not possible. The problem reads: In two\nletters to Gerling, Gauss expresses his regret that certain theorems of solid\ngeometry depend upon the method of exhaustion, i.e., in modern phraseology,\nupon the axiom of continuity (or upon the axiom of Archimedes). Gauss mentions\nin particular the theorem of Euclid, that triangular pyramids of equal\naltitudes are to each other as their bases. Now the analogous problem in the\nplane has been solved. Gerling also succeeded in proving the equality of\nvolume of symmetrical polyhedra by dividing them into congruent parts.\nNevertheless, it seems to me probable that a general proof of this kind for\nthe theorem of Euclid just mentioned is impossible, and it should be our task\nto give a rigorous proof of its impossibility.9 Hilbert goes on to say that\nsuch a proof would be obtained as soon as a counterexample were found—when two\npolyhedra were discovered which could not be dissected into congruent pieces\nand the impossibility of such a dissection demonstrated. Some polyhedra are\nequidecomposable. Any prisms of the same height whose bases have equal areas\nare equidecomposable (by the polygon result). In 1844, C. L. Gerling had shown\nthat two mirror-image polyhedra are equidecomposable by dissecting them into\ncongruent sets of acheiral pieces. (This is what Hilbert is referring to when\nhe speaks of dividing symmetrical polyhedra into congruent parts.) Other\nexamples of individual cases of pairs of equidecomposable polyhedra were known\nin 1900. In 1896 M. J. M. Hill gave examples of tetrahedra that are\nequidecomposable with a cube. One of these has the form of the 'pieh-nao'\nChinese block. Figure 1.16 illustrates the transition from a pieh-nao to a\nprism with the same base and a third of the initial height. However, Hilbert\nfelt that these were special cases, the exception rather than the rule. This\nconjecture was soon confirmed. Even before Hilbert's problems had appeared in\nprint, Max Dehn (1878-1952) announced that he had solved the problem and\nexhibited two polyhedra of equal volume which are not congruent by dissection.\nFollowing the discovery of an 1896 paper by the French engineer Raoul Bricard,\nthe Russian mathematician V. F. Kagan produced a simplified and more\nsystematic exposition of the result. Bricard's work specifies a condition\n\n48 Chapter 1 Figure 1.16. The 'pieh-nao' tetrahedron is equidecomposable with\na prism on the same base. on the dihedral angles of two polyhedra which must\nbe satisfied if they are equidecomposable. Unfortunately, his proof of the\nnecessity of this condition rests on an erroneous assumption. The key to\nDehn's proof is to associate a number (now called the Dehn invariant) to each\npolyhedron which is left unchanged by dissection and reassembly of the pieces:\ntwo polyhedra which are congruent by dissection must have the same Dehn\ninvariant. The crux is that not all polyhedra with the same volume have the\nsame Dehn invariant. This happens for a regular tetrahedron and a cube, for\nexample, showing that these two solids are not equidecomposable. The converse,\nthat polyhedra with the same Dehn invariant are congruent by dissection, is\nalso true. Hilbert's conjecture was correct. Unlike the case of polygons,\nthere are polyhedra of equal volume that are not equidecomposable. Therefore,\nto formulate a theory of volume we cannot use dissection arguments. To\nrigorously establish the volume formulae for some polyhedral solids it is\nnecessary to use some kind of non-elementary method: the infinite is\nunavoidable.\n\nxV ? \" / - iv *■ H * WKte^ * -— glisten Sitcom.

' 8 ^, A^nr From Perspectiva\nCorporum Regularium by Wenzel Jamnitzer, 1568.\n\n51 Rules and Regularity It should be clear that the man who first introduced\nthe notion of regular solid made a significant contribution to mathematics.0,\nW. C. Waterhouse The oldest surviving discussion of polyhedra in a\nphilosophical rather than a practical context occurs in one of Plato's\ndialogues: Timaeus. This is Plato's account of the world we live in. After a\nbrief introduction, in which the four characters set the scene and discuss the\nmythical island of Atlantis, Timaeus takes the floor to tell 'the story of the\nuniverse till the creation of man'. Through the voice of this Pythagorean,\nPlato discusses the origins and workings of natural phenomena. His enquiries\nrange from astronomy and the motions of the heavenly bodies to the anatomy and\nphysiology of humans. Polyhedra appear in his detailed discussion of the\nstructure of matter. The Platonic solids The idea that matter is composed of a\nfew elemental substances combined in different ways had been proposed by\nwriters of the fifth century BC. For some, a single element sufficed: water,\nfor example, has many forms—ice, steam, rain, snow, dew—and is essential to\nlife. Empedocles maintained that there were four elements: water, earth, air\nand fire. He thought that the many different substances were formed by\ncombining these in different proportions, like combining a few letters in many\nways to produce a large variety of words. (The genetic code demonstrates the\nimmense variety that can be expressed with a four-letter alphabet.) Leucippus\nand Democritus also proposed atomic theories of matter. Plato (427-347bc)\nconsidered what makes these elements different from each other.\n\n52 Chapter 2 He suggested that they correspond to different kinds of\nfundamental paiticle. (This idea was revived only in the nineteenth century by\nJohn Dalton one of the founders of modern chemistry.) Plato explained that\nfire, earth, air, and water are bodies; bodies aie solids; solids are bounded\nby plane surfaces, and these are composed of triangles. He chose two\nfundamental triangles, both right-angled: isosceles and scalene. The former is\nunique but of the unlimited number of scalene right triangles he selected 'the\nmost perfect • • • that of which a pair compose an equilateral triangle.' He\nthen proceeded to construct the four 'most perfect figures.' (a) (b) Figure\n2.1. We will begin with the construction of the simplest and smallest figure.\nIts basic unit is the triangle whose hypotenuse is twice the length of its\nshorter side. If two of these are put together with the hypotenuse as the\ndiameter of the resulting figure, and if the process is repeated throe times\nand the diameters and the shorter sides of the three figures are made to\ncoincide in the same vertex, the result is a single equilateral triangle\ncomposed of six basic units [see Figure 2.1(a)]. And if four equilateral\ntriangles are put together, three of their plane angles meet to form a single\nsolid angle • • • and when four such angles have been formed the result is the\nsimplest solid figure which divides the surface of the sphere circumscribing\nit into equal and similar parts.6 Prosaic accounts such as this passage by\nPlato are common in ancient texts. Because works did not contain\nillustrations, the writers' descriptions had to be sufficiently detailed to\nenable their audience to construct their own diagrams where necessary. The\npolyhedron described in this passage is shown on the left of Figure 2.2. When\nit rests on one of its faces it is more clearly a pyramid—it looks the same\nwhichever face it is resting on. If all the vertices of a polyhedron lie on a\nsphere then the sphere is said to circumscribe the polyhedron, and is called\nits circumsphere. The four vertices of Plato's pyramid lie on a sphere.\nConnecting these four points by arcs of great\n\nThe Platonic solids 53 Figure 2.2. circles divides the circumsphere into four\nequal parts as shown on the right of Figure 2.2. Two of the other polyhedra\nthat Plato describes are also constructed from equilateral triangles. One has\na total of eight faces arranged so that each of the six solid angles is\nsurrounded by four plane angles; in the other, the twenty faces form twelve\nsolid angles, each bounded by five plane angles. See Figure 2.3. Plato\ncontinues: After the production of these three figures the first of our basic\nunits is dispensed with, and the isosceles triangle is used to produce the\nfourth body. Four such triangles are put together with their right angles\nmeeting at a common vertex to form a square [see Figure 2.1(b)]. Six squares\nfitted together complete solid angles each composed by three plane right\nangles. The figure of the resulting body is the cube, having six plane square\nfaces. There still remained a fifth construction, which the god used for\nembroidering the constellations on the whole heaven.0 The last sentence in\nthis passage, which seems to have been inserted as an afterthought, refers to\na solid formed from twelve regular pentagons. Its inclusion reflects the fact\nthat there are precisely five polyhedra bounded by regular polygons arranged\nin a regular manner. They are illustrated in Figure 2.3 and are collectively\nknown as the Platonic solids, cosmic figures, or regular polyhedra. Task. Many\nmathematicians have been fascinated by this group of five polyhedra and have\nstudied their properties. They feature prominently in the following chapters,\nboth in the theory and as a source of examples. Even if you make no other\nmodels, you should make yourself a set of Platonic solids. Plato's two\nfundamental triangles cannot be put together to form a pentagon, so the last\nfigure does not occur as one of his elementary particles. Instead\n\n54 Chapter 2 dodecahedron Figure 2.3. The five Platonic solids. he employs it\nto hold the constellations of stars. Plutarch, in the fifth of his Platonic\nQuestions, asks why Plato discarded the most perfect of figures (the sphere)\nand used a rectilinear figure to represent the celestial orb. Ho suggests that\nthe dodecahedron can play the role of the sphere because, like the balls made\nfrom twelve pieces of leather, it is flexible and on being inflated it would\nbecome distended and spherical. He also makes the following numerological\nobservation: It has been assembled and constructed out of twelve equiangular\nand equilateral pentagons each of which consists of thirty of the primary\ntriangles, and this is why it seems to represent at once the zodiac and the\nyear in that the divisions into parts are equal in number.'1 Figure 2.4 shows\none way to decompose a regular pentagon into 30 scalene triangles (not Plato's\nfundamental units). The twelve pentagons of thirtv triangles\n\nThe Platonic solids 55 can signify both the twelve houses of the zodiac each\nof thirty degrees, and the twelve months each of thirty days. Figure 2.4.\nAfter constructing his four fundamental particles, Plato goes on to explain\nhow the attributes of each solid correspond to the properties of its\nassociated element. The stability of the cube he associates with earth. The\npyramid, having the fewest parts, is lightest. It also has the sharpest\ncorners and so it is the most penetrating. These properties make the pyramid\nthe basic unit of fire. By similar arguments, he allocates the other figures\nto air (octahedron) and water (icosahe- dron). The models shown in Figure 2.5\nhave been covered with tessellations of birds and fish to illustrate these\nrelationships. A brilliant representation of the association of fire with the\ntetrahedron is provided by John Robinson's sculpture Prometheus' Hearth shown\nin Plate 1 but he says this is serendipitous. Plato's associations of the\nelements with the regular polyhedra have inspired many illustrations. The\nsixteenth century plate by Wenzel Jamnitzer shown on page 50 contains a\ndescription of the octahedron in the centre panel surrounded by an assortment\nof things symbolising air: birds, bats, insects, windmills and wind\ninstruments. Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) decorated his sketches (see Figure\n2.6) of the five solids with symbols appropriate to each element—the cube, for\nexample, has pictures of a tree, garden tools and a carrot. Kepler gave his\nown account of the connections between the solids and the elements: That the\ncube stands upright on a square base expresses stability, which is\ncharacteristic of terrestrial matter, whose weight tends down to the lowest\npoint, while, it is commonly believed, the whole globe of Earth is at rest at\nthe centre of the World. The octahedron, on the other hand, is viewed most\nappropriately suspended by opposite angles, as in a lathe, the square which\nlies exactly midway between these angles dividing the figure into two equal\nparts, just as a globe suspended by its poles is divided by a great circle.\nThis is an image\n\n56 Chapter 2 of mobility, as air is the most mobile of the elements, in speed\nand direction. The tetrahedron's small number of faces is seen as signifying\nthe dryness of fire, since dry things, by definition, keep within their\nboundaries. The large number of faces of the icosahedron, on the other hand,\nis seen as signifying the wetness of water, since wetness, by definition, is\nheld within the boundaries of other things.e But he also realised the\nfragility of the connections: Although, I say, this sort of analogy is\nacceptable, yet framed in this manner it has no force of necessity; indeed, it\nadmits of other intci- pretations, not only because certain properties are at\nvariance within the analogy, but also because ■ • ■ the number of elements and\nwhether the Earth is at rest are matters much more open to dispute than is the\nnumber of figures/ The fact that the number of elements did not match the\nnumber of solids posed a problem. Plato's evasion of the difficulty by\nassigning the spare solid to the heavens did not satisfy his followers and the\nsubject was a source of much I i\"%*t_.' '>!--* Figure 2.5. Two models\ndecorated to illustrate Plato's associations of elements with polyhedra.\n\nThe Platonic solids 57 debate at the Academy, even after Plato's death. In\naccounts of the theorv written by later Platonists a fifth element, ether, is\npostulated. Plato did not seek merely to describe nature; he attempted to\nexplain how the four elements combine to produce the variety of matter we\nobserve, and how the different substances change and interact. He sought a\nkind of 'physical chemistry'. By allowing the size of his fundamental\ntriangles to vary he thought that the quality of the element would alter—his\nelements did not constitute 'being a thing' but rather 'having a quality'.\nThus water was a generic form of liquid, earth and air corresponded to solid\nand gaseous phases of matter. He tried to explain how substances were\ntransformed into one another. For instance1, if water is heated by fire, the\nsharp corners of the fire particles break down the water particles into their\nconstituent triangles and the fragments recombine to produce two air particles\n(steam) and a fire particle. To arrive at this 'chemical equation' Plato has\nbalanced the number of triangles on both sides: <liquid> ^4 2 <gas> \\+ <fire>\n20 = 2x8+4 Even though this was extremely ingenious, it did not go\nuncriticised. Plato treats his elements both as solid particles and as hollow\ngeometric shells that can be broken down. His fundamental particles\ndisintegrate, and his elements tiansmute. Nevertheless, Plato's belief that\nmathematics can be used to understand nature has had far-reaching\nconsequences. Figure 2.6. Kepler's sketches of the Platonic solids showing\ntheir associations with the elements.\n\n58 Chapter 2 The mathematical paradigm Although Plato influenced the\ndevelopment of mathematics, this was not due to any significant advances of\nhis own discovery but rather because of his enthusiasm for the subject. He\nencouraged his pupils to study mathematics to discipline their minds, to teach\nthem to reason logically and provide sound arguments, as a prelude to the\nstudy of philosophy. That Plato could use mathematics in this way was part of\nthe fall-out of the discovery of incommensurability by the Pythagoreans. This\nmade a big impact on the development of Greek mathematics. It led to a\ndistrust of experience and sense data, and to a greater reliance on argument\nto establish propositions. The degree of justification required to prove\nresults changed with time. As the corpus of mathematical knowledge grew,\nmathematicians sought to verify things that had once seemed undeniable.\nMathematics grew roots as well as branches. After two centuries of\ndevelopment, logical argument had reached the standard we find fossilised in\nwhat is probably the world's best known textbook: the Elements of geometry\ncompiled by Euclid (c.300bc). This book was to dominate the teaching of\nmathematics for two millennia. Unfortunately, its very success means that we\ncannot trace its evolution—Euclid's Elements overshadowed all the previous\ntexts to such an extent that none has survived. Euclid's style of presentation\nset the paradigm for mathematical arguments that has been followed ever since:\npropositions are established by a series of logical deductions from explicitly\nstated hypotheses. This format is not the momentary inspiration of one man but\nwas the product of many years of refinement. During its gestation, two\nfundamentally Greek ideas entered mathematics: the power of abstraction, and\nthe rules of deductive logic. Abstraction Abstraction plays an essential role\nin mathematics. It is applied instinctively to generate the concepts of number\nand shape. Even a people who only have words for a few small numbers have\nidentified that two trees, two people, two hands share a common property,\nnamely, 'two-ness'. Our character '2' symbolises the many pairs in the world\naround us. Similarly, the naming of shapes corresponds to the abstraction of\nsome common property—a recognition of the key qualities of an object and their\nrelevance to other situations. The abstraction and naming of a concept implies\na purpose. There is no name for the set of polygons with a prime number of\nsides which contain a right angle in at least one corner. Although such\ncharacteristics could be abstracted to define a class of shapes, it has not\nbeen done because there is nothing to be gained by doing so, no role in any\ncurrent theory for such polygons to occupy.\n\nPrimitive objects and unproved theorems 59 Only the need to refer to a\ncollection gives the motivation to name it. Abstraction can take the form of\nidealism. Any physical example of a cube, whether it be a natural crystal or\nof artificial construction, will exhibit imperfections. The mathematical\nnotion of a cube is a purified form devoid of the inevitable defects\nencountered in the material world. For Plato, the idealised forms were the\nreality: permanent, ageless and incorruptible. The material world contained\nonly distorted images, approximations to the genuine objects, merely\nrepresentations of reality, but the mind could perceive the true unpolluted\narchetypal forms. For all their preoccupation with the Platonic world, the\nGreeks did not dispense with sense data. They still used diagrams to assist\nwith their arguments. Plato writes in the Republic: Do you not know also that\nalthough they further make use of the visible forms and reason about them,\nthey are not thinking of these but of the ideals which they resemble. ■ • ■\nThey are really seeking to behold the things themselves which can only be seen\nwith the eye of the mind.9 The diagrams served as reminders of the true\nfigures. Curiously, experiments in perceptual psychology have shown that the\nmind 'cleans up' the data it receives. Even a roughly drawn figure can help to\nvisualise a problem because the mind smooths out the irregularities and tries\nto simplify the image. 'The eye perceives but the mind will obligingly\noverlook.' For a mathematician, abstraction is also an active process: it is\nthe search for the crucial aspects of a situation. When you reach the heart of\na problem, it becomes clear which data are relevant and which are redundant.\nThe critical points can be studied in isolation without distraction. It is far\neasier to concentrate on particular features rather than become submerged in a\nmass of multifarious details. This approach has another benefit: any other\nobject that shaies the studied features will also share the properties derived\nfrom them. Discarding the inessential is the essence of mathematics. Primitive\nobjects and unproved theorems The identification of properties shared by\nseveral objects leads to definitions: a name is given to the collection of all\nobjects with particular properties in common, and to any member of it. For\nexample, a triangle is a plane figure bounded by three lines. The definition\ndescribes how the term 'triangle' is to be interpreted, it states what the\nessential characteristics of a triangle are. But this is only useful if we\nunderstand the terms used in the description. We need to know something of\nplane figures and lines before the definition makes any sense. An attempt\n\n60 Chapter 2 could be made to define lines and planes but this would only\ndefer the pioblem. Eventually, if the process is not to result in an unending\nchain of definitions, and we are to avoid circular definitions (in which an\nobject is defined in teims of itself), some primitive concepts must be taken\nas understood. Natural candidates for such primitive undefined terms are\n'point', 'line' and 'space'. In addition to accepting a few undefined terms,\nit is necessary to admit some1 statements concerning the behaviour and\ninterrelationships of these primitive concepts. These are required to form the\nbasis of logical arguments. Just as a definition must not be circular or\ninfinite, so a proof must terminate. There must be some 'unproved theorems'\nwhich are admitted as hypotheses, initial statements taken on trust before a\nproof can get off the ground. These postulates, or axioms usually state things\nthat appear self-evident and which are accepted without much trouble. For\nexample, one such axiom states that we can diaw a straight line joining any\ntwo points. Ideally, the numbers of primitive terms and of hypotheses should\nbe as small as possible. If one of the primitive terms can be defined in terms\nof the others, it is superfluous. Similarly, any axiom that can be derived\nfrom the others is redundant. The axioms must also be consistent. This means\nthat it is impossible to prove contradictory things: every statement must be\ntrue or false not both. There is no objective way to choose primitive concepts\nand axioms. Those used by Euclid were distilled over a long period. At the\nbeginning of book I of the Elements he lists his chosen axioms and purports to\nderive all the results of his thirteen books from just ten statements. Not\nsurprisingly, after 2()()() years, it is possible to criticise Euclid's\npresentation: standards of what comprises an acceptable hypothesis have\nchanged during this time. At the end of the nineteenth century, David Hilbert\nrevised the foundations of Euclidean geometry. He added extra axioms and\nsupplied proofs of some of the 'self-evident' propositions which were not so\neasily accepted. Some of these had been so obvious to the Greeks that the\npossibility of doubting them, and hence needing to add them as hypotheses,\nwould not have occurred to them. That two lines which cross have a point in\ncommon seems obvious—because we automatically attribute the quality of\ncontinuity to lines. Hilbert found it necessary to include axioms of\ncontinuity to ensure this. In spite of these faults, Euclid's great\nachievement was to set the standard that succeeding generations of\nmathematicians would aspire to attain. Even tliough Euclid himself missed the\nmark on occasions, the axiomatic method developed by the Greeks has become the\ncornerstone of all mathematics.\n\nThe problem of existence 61 The problem of existence The purpose of a\ndefinition is to name an object, image, idea or a collection of such things.\nIt tells us what a thing is—what properties distinguish it from other things\nso that we can recognise it. A definition does not, however, assert that the\ndefined thing actually exists. It may require that the object has incompatible\nproperties, in which case the definition is vacuous and meaningless. An\nexample (used by Leibniz) is that of a regular polyhedron with ten faces. Any\ntheorems about such a polyhedron are nonsense. Apart from the primitive\nconcepts, whose existence is assumed and whose properties are described in the\naxioms, the existence of a defined object must be demonstrated. This problem\ncan be approached in two ways: in the direct approach the object is\nconstructed mathematically and shown to possess the desired characteristics;\nthe indirect approach seeks to show that the assumed nonexistence of the\nobject contradicts an axiom or a previously established fact. The\npsychological advantage of having a concrete example to experiment on, rather\nthan just the knowledge that such an example must exist, strongly favours the\nfirst method. The Greeks certainly preferred this constructive type of\nexistence proof. The constructions recorded by Euclid describe how, by drawing\nlines and circles, the positions of the important parts of an object can be\nestablished. The steps that Euclid allowed himself are restricted by his\nchoice of hypotheses. He provided three primitive constructions: (1) A\n[unique] straight line can be drawn from any point to any other point. (2) A\nstraight line segment can be continuously extended by a finite amount to\nproduce another straight line segment. (3) A [unique] circle may be drawn\ncentred on any point with any radius. These statements encapsulate the\nproperties of two standard drawing instruments: compasses and a straight edge.\nBecause their properties provide the fundamental constructs in the Elements,\nthese instruments are sometimes called the Euclidean tools. However, the\nproperties abstracted from these implements are idealised. The straight edge\nwould have to be unlimited in length to be able to join any two points; the\ncompasses would have to be able to draw a circle of any radius, however large.\nIt is also important to notice that neither of the Euclidean tools can be used\nto transfer distance: the straight edge is ungraduated and so is not a ruler,\nthe compasses collapse when lifted from the page. Even with so few operations\navailable, a surprising amount can be achieved. Indeed, all the geometrical\npropositions in the thirteen books of the Elements are\n\n62 Chapter 2 derived using only the ability to construct lines and circles.\nThese propositions can be classified into two kinds: theorems (which\ndemonstrate properties) and constructions (which prove existence). A\nconstruction usually has two parts: first the construction of an object is\ndescribed, then the object is shown to possess the desired characteristics.\nThe following examples, all of which are taken from the Elements, illustrate\nthe process. The first example is Euclid's opening proposition in book I.\nExample 1. To construct an equilateral triangle. Given the straight line AB,\nconstruct a circle centred on A which passes through B (postulate 3 above\nensures that this can be done). Construct a second circle centred on B which\npasses through A, and let C be a point where the two circles meet. Draw the\nstraight lines AC and BC (postulate 1). These steps can be followed in Figure\n2.7. Figure 2.7. Construction of an equilateral triangle. We now need to show\nthat the triangle ABC is equilateral. Because AB and AC are both radii of the\nsame circle (centred on ^4), their lengths are equal. Similarly the lengths of\nAB and BC are equal. One of Euclid's axioms is: 'things equal to the same\nthing are equal to each other'. Therefore AC = AB and AB = BC implies AC = BC.\nHence all three sides have the same length. ■ Once a proposition is\nestablished it can be used in other constructions. Euclid applies his first\nproposition when he constructs a perpendicular to a given line. Example 2. To\nconstruct a perpendicular. Suppose that AB is the given line and that the\npoint C on AB is to be the foot of the perpendicular. The method is indicated\nin Figure 2.8. Choose a point D on AC and construct a circle centred on C\nwhich passes through D. Let E be the point where the circle meets CB.\nConstruct an equilateral triangle on DE whose third corner we shall call F.\nThen FC is the desired line.\n\nThe problem of existence 63 Figure 2.8. Construction of a perpendicular. To\nshow that FC is perpendicular to AB we must prove that angle LACF is a right\nangle. The lengths CD and CE are equal (by construction) as are the lengths FD\nand FE. Hence the triangles CDF and CEF have sides of the same length. In a\nprevious proposition Euclid has shown that the angles in such triangles are\nalso equal. In particular, angles IDCF and LECF ai(! equal. They are also\nadjacent to each other, and Euclid defines equal, complementary angles to be\nright angles. ■ This proposition forms part of a small 'tool kit' of\nfundamental constructions that are used many times. Other such primary\nconstructions include finding the midpoint of a line segment and bisecting an\nangle. Over the 2000 years since Euclid compiled his Elements people have\nsought to find alternatives to some of his constructions and to simplify them.\nThe construction of a regular pentagon given below is not that given by Euclid\nbut was found by H. W. Richmond at the end of the nineteenth centuiy. Example\n3. To construct a regular pentagon. Given a line AB, let C be its midpoint.\nDraw a circle centred on C which passes through B. Construct the perpendicular\nto AB at C, and let D be the point where it meets the circle. Let E be the\nmidpoint of CD and draw the line BE. Construct the line which bisects angle\nIBEC and let F denote the point where it meets BC (see Figure 2.9). Now\nconstruct the perpendicular to BC at F and let G be the point where it meets\nthe circle. The points B and G are two corners of a regular pentagon inscribed\nin the circle. The other corners can be found by drawing a few circles.\n\n64 Chapter 2 Figure 2.9. Construction of a regular pentagon. Problem. Verify\nthat this construction is valid. Although a great deal is accomplished in the\nElements, Euclid's decision to rely on so few primitive constructions placed\nlimitations on the kind of geometry he could perform. For example, it is\nimpossible to construct some regular polygons using straight edge and\ncompasses alone. A hexagon can be constructed, a heptagon cannot. An octagon\ncan be obtained from a square by bisecting arcs on its circumcircle, but a\n9-gon is impossible. The constructibility of regular polygons with up to 25\nsides is listed in Table 2.10, together with the propositions in the Elements\nfor the cases covered by Euclid. Is there any pattern which separates the\nconstructible polygons from the impossible ones? The fourth column of the\ntable shows the decomposition of the number of sides into prime factors. The\nfactors of 2 are isolated on the left of the column since they can be\nintroduced or removed at will (it is easy to double the number of sides of a\nregular polygon, and the number of sides can be halved by joining alternate\nvertices). The odd primes are sorted: those in the centre of the column\ncorrespond to the constructible polygons. Are the primes correlated with\nconstructibility? The factors 3 and 5 appear to be 'good' while 7 and 11 are\nnot. The pattern of which polygons are constructible, and the reasons\nunderlying it, were unknown until 1796—two millennia after Euclid. Karl\nFriedrich Gauss (1777-1855) made a systematic study of the cyclotomic equation\n(zn = 1). In geometrical terms, the solutions of this equation divide a circle\ninto arcs of equal length, and hence locate the vertices of regular polygons.\nGauss used this relationship to solve the problem of which polygons could be\nconstructed with the Euclidean tools: it is possible to construct a regular\nn-sided polygon if the factorisation of n into primes has the form n = 2k p!\np2 ■ • • pr (*) where each of the odd primes pi can be written as 22\"1 + 1 for\nsome m, and all the Pi are distinct. Prime numbers of this kind are called\nFermat primes after the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat\n(1601-1665)—famous for his 'Last\n\nThe problem of existence 65 Theorem'. The first few Fermat primes are 3 = 22°\n+ l 5 = 22l + l 17 = 222 + l 257 = 223 + l 65537 = 22' + l Gauss' announcement\nthat the regular 17-gon is constructible was the first advance in this area\nsince the Elements was compiled. When m is between 5 and 16, 22\"1 + 1 is not a\nprime number so any other regular polygon which is proved constructible by\nthis method must have an enormous number of sides (22 « 1020000). Such an\nobject would not be constructible in any practical sense of the word.

This explains\nwhy a regular heptagon cannot be constructed since seven is not a Fermat\nprime. The 9-gorr cannot be constructed because the prime factors of nine are\nnot distinct. Constructing the Platonic solids Constructions for three-\ndimensional objects are considerably more involved than those for simple\nplanar figures. Indeed, Euclid does not begin his treatment of solid geometry\nuntil book xi, and the constructions of the Platonic solids are the last topic\ncovered in the Elements. Few people would have progressed so far. Euclid\ndefines each Platonic solid by describing the number and kind of faces that\ncontain it. He concludes the construction of each solid by showing that all\nits vertices lie on a sphere. This is achieved by showing that all the\nvertices lie on semicircles having the same diameter. It is for this reason\nthat Euclid gives a rather unusual definition of a sphere as the surface swept\nout bv rotating a semicircle about its diameter. From this definition it would\nappear that the generating axis is in some way special whereas, in fact, all\nthe diarrreters of a sphere are equivalent. The definition is more a way of\ngenerating a sphere than a statement of its essential characteristic: all its\npoints are equidistant from a given centre. The constructions of the regular\npolyhedra that follow are rrot complete and merely sketch possible ways of\napproach. For most of the solids, the methods are based on those given in the\nElements. Construction. To construct a tetrahedron. First, take a semicircle\nof diameter NS. Divide the length NS to produce a point Q so that NQ : QS = 2\n:1. (The length NQ will be the height of the tetrahedron.) Construct the\nperpendicular to NS at Q and let P be the point where it meets the semicircle\n(see Figure 2.11). Draw the line NP (this will be the edge-length of the\ntetrahedron). This has produced what we can think of as arr 'elevation' view\nof part of the tetrahedron. We shall now construct a 'plan' view. Draw a\ncircle centred on a point Q' whose radius has the same length as QP, and\ninscribe an equilateral triangle inside it. Denote the corners of the\ntriarrgle by A, B and C. Erect a line passing through Q perpendicular to the\nplane containing triangle ABC and place the points N' and S' on opposite sides\nof Q' so that N'Q' = NQ and S'Q' = SQ. Now, the four points A, B, C arrd N'\nare the corners of a tetrahedron and the lines joining them determine its four\ntriangular faces: ABC, ABN', BCN' and CAN'. It remains to show that these\ntriangles are all equal. The crux of the problem\n\nConstructing the Platonic solids 67 N A Figure 2.11. Construction of a\ntetrahedron. is to show that a line such as AN' has the same length as AB—we\nshall not consider this further. To construct the circumsphere, note that the\ntriangle N'Q'A equals triangle NQP so A lies on a semicircle with diameter\nN'S'. The points B and C can be similarly shown to lie on semicircles with\ndiameter N'S'. Therefore, rotating such a semicircle about N'S' will create a\nsphere that contains all the corners of the tetrahedron. ■ Construction. To\nconstruct an octahedron. Take a semicircle with diameter NS and let Q be the\npoint that bisects NS. Construct the perpendicular to NS at Q and let P denote\nthe point where it meets the semicircle. Draw the line NP. This completes the\n'elevation' view. Figure 2.12. Construction of an octahedron. Construct a\nsquare with corners A, B, C, D and with side-length equal to NP. Let Q' be the\ncentre of the square (formed by the intersection of the diagonals).\n\n68 Chapter 2 Erect a line perpendicular to the plane of the square which\npasses through Q' and place points N' and S' on opposite sides of Q' so that\nN'Q' = NQ and S'Q' = SQ. Join each of N' and S' to the four points A, B, C and\nD. The six points A, B, C, D, N' and S' are the corners of an octahedron whose\neight faces are ABN', BCN', CDN', DAN', ABS', BCS', CDS', and DAS'. It remains\nto show that all these triangles are equilateral. As in the case of the\ntetrahedron, rotating a semicircle about its diameter N'S' will produce a\nsphere containing all the vertices. ■ Construction. To construct a cube. Take\na semicircle with diameter NS. Divide NS at the point Q so that NQ: QS — 2:1.\nConstruct the perpendicular to NS at Q and let P denote the point where it\nmeets the semicircle. Draw the line SP. D Figure 2.13. Construction of a cube.\nConstruct a square with corners A, B, C, D whose side has length equal to SP.\nErect a line on A perpendicular to the plane of the square and place a point E\non the line so that AE = SP. Repeat this at each of B, C and D to give points\nF, G and H respectively, all of which are on the same side of the square as E.\nConnect E, F, G and H to form a square—this will complete the cube. This cube\ncan be inscribed in a sphere of diameter equal to NS. To construct this\ncircumsphere, Euclid uses the fact that a right-angled triangle meets the\nsemicircle on its hypotenuse (see Figure 2.14). So, for example, since angle\niGCA is a right angle, C lies on a semicircle with diameter AG. Similarly, the\nfive corners B, D, E, F and H also lie on such semicircles. The sphere swept\nout by rotating a semicircle about AG passes through all the vertices of the\ncube. ■ A line AB can be divided by a point C into two segments AC and CB so\nthat the ratio of the whole to the longer segment and the ratio of the longer\nto\n\nConstructing the Platonic solids 69 the shorter segment are equal: i.e. so\nthat AB : AC — AC:CB. The Greeks called this division into extreme and mean\nratio. In the Renaissance it was called the divine proportion, and it is also\nknown as the golden section or golden ratio. This ratio is approximately 5:3.\nHowever, the diagonal and side of a regular pentagon are in the golden ratio,\nand in the Chapter 1 we saw that such segments are incommensurable: they\ncannot be expressed exactly as the ratio of whole numbers. The precise value\nof the ratio is (y/5 + 1): 2. (ZS Figure 2.14. A right-angled triangle meets\nthe semicircle on its hypotenuse. Construction. To construct a dodecahedron.\nEuclid's strategy for constructing a dodecahedron is to start with a cube and\nbuild a 'roof shaped structure on each face (see Figure 2.15). The problem is\nto find the correct height and length of the ridge of such a roof. Figure\n2.15. A dodecahedron can be constructed by adding a 'roof to each face of a\ncube. To construct a roof, take a square with corners A, B, C, D. Let E and F\nbe the midpoints of AB and CD respectively and connect them by a line. Let G\nbe the midpoint of EF. Divide EG in the golden ratio to produce H so that EH\nis the shorter part. Divide FG similarly to produce J. Erect lines\nperpendicular to the plane of the square passing through H and J and mark off\npoints K and L so\n\n70 Chapter 2 that the lengths HK and JL are equal to HG. The points K and L\ndetermine the ridge of the roof. If this construction is applied to each\nsquare face of a cube (being careful to orient the roofs consistently) then\nthe result is a regular dodecahedron. To prove this, it is necessary to show\nthat the triangular end-piece of one roof and the quadrangular piece of the\nadjacent roof are coplanar—thus fitting together to form a pentagon. We also\nhave to show that these pentagons are regular. ■ H G J D Figure 2.16.\nConstruction of a 'roof. Euclid's construction for an icosahedron follows\nalong similar lines to those of the first three solids. The construction below\nis more in the spirit of the dodecahedron construction: the twelve vertices\nare located on the surface of a cube. Construction. To construct an\nicosahedron. The twelve vertices of the icosahedron can be located on the\nsurface of a cube— two on each face. To locate such a pair of points in a\nsquare with coineis .4, J5, C, D, let E and F be the midpoints of AB and CD\nrespectively and connect them by a line. Let G be the midpoint of EF. Divide\nEG in the golden ratio to produce H so that EH is the shorter part. Divide FG\nsimilarly to produce -/. The required points are H and J (see the left diagram\nof Figure 2.1G). Besides being the vertices of an icosahedron, the twelve\npoints also deteimine three mutually perpendicular golden rectangles (see\nFigure 2.17). ■ The discovery of the regular polyhedra Almost everyone who\nencounters the regular solids finds something appealing about them. That the\nGreeks made such detailed and sustained studies of them is probably connected\nwith their unexpected finiteness: there are onlv five of them, in contrast to\nthe unlimited number of regular polygons. Fascination with\n\nThe discovery of the regular polyhedra Figure 2.17. Three mutually\nperpendicular golden rectangles can he inscribed in an icosahedron. these\nsolids led both Kepler and Plato to use them in their theories of the cosmos.\nTheir aesthetic properties attracted Renaissance artists and craftsmen. They\nare also associated with ideas in many areas of modern mathematics from the\nalgebra of group theory to the study of geometric singularities. As they have\npermeated so much, it seems worthwhile spending a little time trying to\nidentify their source. Although the oldest surviving account of the regular\npolyhedra is preserved in Plato's Timaeus, Plato should not be credited with\ntheir discovery. Solids like; the cube and the pyramid are such fundamental\nfigures that they were known very early on. Perhaps more surprisingly, the\ndodecahedron is also an ancient figure. Etruscan charms and ornaments of\ndodecahedral form dating from about 500BC have been found in Italy. Pyrite\ncrystals possibly provided the insphation for these ornaments. Commonly known\nas fool's gold, pyrite (FeS2) is the most common sulphide and today its main\nuse is as a source of sulphur for the production of sulphuric acid. It is\noften found alongside copper ores and would have been familiar to early mine\nworkers. Its crystals are often cubic; another common shape has twelve\npentagonal facets. These pentagons are not quite regular but the Platonic form\nis easily imagined. Plate 2 shows a group of pyrite crystals. Even though the\nindividual crystals have grown into each other, it is still possible to\nidentify the dodecahedral forms. The southern part of Italy, where the\nPythagorean school was situated, is particularly rich in pyrite deposits. The\neye-catching crystals must have attracted the Pythagorean's attention. Indeed,\nthe Syrian philosopher Iamblichus (r.250- c.330ad) records that Hippasus wrote\nabout a 'sphere of twelve pentagons'. One problem in tracing the history of\nGreek mathematics is that many results are attributed to Pythagoras. The\nPythagorean brotherhood ascribed all their results to their founder, and later\nhistorians faced with material of unknown origin followed in this tradition.\nFor instance, in what is known as the 'Eudemian\n\n72 Chapter 2 summary'1 we read that It was he [Pythagoras] who discovered the\nsubject of incommensurable quantities and the composition of the cosmic\nfigures.'1 Fortunately, for the history of the regular solids there is an\nalternative source of information. A scholium to the thirteenth book of the\nElements reads: In this book, the thirteenth, are treated the five so-called\nPlatonic figures which, however, do not belong to Plato, three of the\naforesaid five figures being due to the Pythagoreans, namely the cube, the\npyramid and the dodecahedron, while the octahedron and the icosahedron arc due\nto Theaetetus. They are named after Plato because he mentions them in the\nTimaeus. This book also carries Euclid's name because he embodied it in the\nElements. These two passages are the best accounts we have. The former reports\nthe kind of history based on legend. The latter is given more credence\nprecisely because it goes against such traditions. Its details are not the\nkind of conjectured facts one would invent to fill in an unknown piece of the\nhistorical jigsaw. It records that the Pythagoreans knew the pyramid, the cube\nand the dodecahedron which, as we have seen, is not improbable. The discovery\nof the other two is ciedited to Theaetetus (c.415-369bc), a friend of Plato.\nThe major puzzle posed by this passage is the date of the octahedron: why is\nit so late? Icosahedra are not found in nature so the late discovery of this\nform is not unexpected. But octahedra, like cubes and almost-regular\ndodecahedra, occur as crystals. Surely they would have been known to the\nPythagoreans. As William Waterhouse has pointed out, this problem is solved as\nsoon as we realise that a crucial part of the history of the regular solids\nhas been overlooked: at some point, the notion of regularity itself had to be\ndiscovered. Until the properties that define a regular solid were isolated,\nthe pyramid, the cube and the 'sphere of twelve pentagons' were merely useful\nor interesting shapes; before their common features were abstracted they were\nunrelated individual solids. (The reader who is unfamiliar with the definition\nof a regular polyhedron may like to try to find a set of properties that\ncharacterise regularity. It is not as easy as you may think.) With the\nrealisation that the notion of regularity had to be abstracted, the lateness\nof the octahedron does not seem so unnatural. Although the octahedral shape\nmay have been familiar, it was only thought worthy of study when its JThe\nEudemian summary is a passage in the prologue to Proclus' commentary on the\nfirst book of the Elements. It gives a brief account of the development of\nGreek mathemati< s and is thought to be based on the now lost History of\nGeometry written by Eudemus of Rhodes.\n\nThe discovery of the regular polyhedra 73 relationship to other solids was\nrecognised. Only after the concept of legulaiity was invented did it become\nimportant. As Waterhouse explains: [As T. L. Heath] quite correctly said, the\noctahedron \"is only a double pyramid with a square base\"; and that is a very\ngood reason why no one would have bothered with it. We can readily grant that\na man who in some sense could construct a dodecahedron could in the same sense\nconstruct an octahedron—but why should he? Someone thoroughly familiar with\npyramids would attach no special importance to this particular combination of\nthem. He could assemble an octahedron, he might even admire its appearance;\nbut mathematically he would have nothing to say about it. Only someone\npossessing the concept of regular solid would have reason to single it out.\n(Consider for comparison the quartz crystal. Quartz (S1O2) is the most common\nmineral on earth; its crystals are large, unmistakaJ)le hexagonal pyramids and\nprisms; the Greek word for it has given jis the very word \"crystal\". Yet in\nall of the Greek geometry theie is no special study of hexagonal prisms or\npyramids. The shapes were familiar enough, but there simply was nothing\nparticular to say about them.) The discovery of the octahedron thus was rather\nlike the discovery of, say, the fifth perfect number: what required discovery\nwas not so much the object itself as its significance. Some Babylonian\naccountant may well have written down the number 33,550,336; but he did not\nthereby discover the fifth perfect number because he did not observe the\nproperty which distinguishes this number from others. Similarly, the\noctahedron became an object of special mathematical study only when someone\ndiscovered a role for it to play.1 The late recognition of the octahedron as a\nregular solid must be closelv connected with the discovery of regularity\nitself. Besides the testimony of the scholium, further evidence which supports\nthis view can be found in the etymology of the names of the five figures. The\nmodern names for the solids derive from Greek roots: the numbers four, six,\neight, twelve, and twenty, and the word 'hedr' meaning seat. Thus octahedron\nmoans 'eight faces'. The use of this terminology is more than mere descriptive\nlabelling. The Greeks only used these names in connection with the Platonic\nsolids. (The hexagonal prism is never called an octahedron, for example, even\nthough it has eight faces.) The fact that these names are sufficient to\ndistinguish between tin1 figures means that whoever labelled the polyhedra in\nthis way knew several kev facts: he recognised that the five figures have\nproperties in common and, as such, form a family. Moreover, the systematic\nnomenclature can only have been chosen after\n\n74 Chapter 2 an enumeration had been performed to find all the polyhedra\nsharing these properties. Only then is it apparent that no two of them have\nthe same number of faces. This marks one of the earliest classifications in\nthe history of mathematics. Besides their technical names, the three solids of\nancient origin also have vernacular names: pyramid, cube, 'sphere of twelve\npentagons'. But it appears that the other two (the octahedron and the\nicosahedron) have only ever had scientific names. This suggests that the\noctahedron and the icosahedron are known only as part of the family, and hence\ntheir recognition or discovery occurred at about the same time as the\nabstraction of the notion of regular solid. On this point, then, the\nscholiast's account does not seem so implausible. The scholiast's attribution\nof the discovery to Theaetetus is also supported by circumstantial evidence.\nBook xm of the Elements begins with propositions on the golden ratio and\ninscribing regular polygons in circles—topics already covered in earlier\nbooks. If the presentation were due to Euclid, he could have shortened it\nconsiderably. This suggests that book xm is based on an earlier treatise which\nwas incorporated into the Elements in a largely unrevised and unedited state.\n(The scholiast also comments to this effect.) Scholars have found strong\nstylistic, as well as mathematical, links between books xm and x, connections\nthat are sufficient to suggest that both books are based on works by the same\nauthor. And it is widely accepted that Theaetetus laid the foundations for the\ntenth book. There is one last fragment of information concerning the history\nof the regular polyhedra. A tradition preserved up until the eleventh century\nAD was recorded by the Byzantine writer Suidas. He compiled an encyclopaedia,\nnow known as the Suda Lexicon, which covers many topics including history,\nliterature, philosophy, and science. It contains the following comments:\nTheaetetus, of Athens, astronomer, philosopher, disciple of Socrates, taught\nat Heraclea. He first wrote on 'the five solids' as they are called.^ On the\nwhole, the traditions concerning the history of the regular solids agree. In\nan embryonic phase, some of the solids were studied individually for their own\nsake. But people were not yet aware of a family connection—they were not\nstudying regular solids since the concept was unknown. The study of the\nregular solids begins with the abstraction of regularity. And we can be fairly\nconfident in attributing that achievement to Theaetetus. What is regularity?\nWhat properties did Theaetetus abstract from the regular polyhedra when he\nmade his definition? Unfortunately, we do not know. Book XI of the Elements\n\nWhat is regularity? 75 contains definitions of the five individual solids, but\nEuclid did not state which of their shared properties determine their family\nconnection. We can get some idea from the final proposition of the Elements, a\nproposition thought to have been appended by Euclid or a scholiast and not\npart of the original treatise1 that forms the remainder of the book.\nProposition. No other figure, besides the said five figures, can he\nconstructed which is contained by equilateral and equiangular figures equal to\none another. PROOF: The proof proceeds by examining the different kinds of\nsolid angle that can occur. First we note that at least three polygons must\nmeet at anv solid angle, and that the sum of all the plane angles around a\nsolid angle must be less than four right angles. If the polyhedron is made of\nequilateral triangles then a solid angle can be surrounded by three, four or\nfive polygons. These are the solid angles of the tetrahedron, the octahedron\nand the icosahedron. Six equilateral triangles suiiound a point in the plane\nand so do not form a solid angle. Seven or more tiiaugles cannot surround a\npoint because their angle sum is larger than four right angles. Three squares\naround a point form the solid angle of a cube. Four squares fit round a point\nin the plane, and more than four squares cannot fit aiound a point. Three\npentagons together form the solid angle of a dodecahedion. Foui 01 more\npentagons cannot form a solid angle since their angle sum is too large. No\nother regular polygons can form a solid angle because of the angle sum\nrestriction. ■ From the statement of the proposition it is clear that the two\nfollowing properties were associated with regularity: («) the faces must be\nequal, and (ii) the faces must be regular polygons. However, these conditions\nare insufficient and, as it stands, the statement of the proposition is false.\nThere are other polyhedra besides the Platonic solids that are bounded by\nequal regular polygons. In fact, they are all bounded by triangles; together\nwith the tetrahedron, the octahedron and the icosahedron, they form the family\nof eight (convex) deltahedra illustrated in Figure 2 18. The name\n'deltahedron' was used by Martyn Cundy for any polyhedron bounded by\nequilateral triangles: the Greek capital letter delta ('A') looks like such a\ntriangle. Two of the five non-regular deltahedra are dipyramids. Another is\nformed by attaching three square-based pyramids to the square faces of a\ntriangular prism. A fourth is obtained from a square-antiprism by erecting\npyramids on both of its\n\n76 Chapter 2 square faces. The names given in the figure to these last two\ndeltahedra are due to Norman Johnson, who developed a systematic nomenclature\nfor polyhedra with regular faces. We shall see more of this below. The\nremaining solid is not described so easily. It has twelve faces and is\nsometimes called the Siamese dodecahedron—a name coined by H. S. M. Coxeter.\nJohnson called it the snub disphenoid. triangular dipyramid tri-augmented\ntriangular prism Siamese dodecahedron gyro-elongated square dipyramid Figure\n2.18. Convex deltahedra. These examples show that Euclid's characterisation of\nregularity is incomplete. The Platonic solids do have equal regular faces but\nthey are not the only polyhedra to do so. Extra conditions are required to\ncapture precisely the aesthetic quality of regularity exhibited by the\nPlatonic solids but which is lacking in the deltahedra. The lack of clarity\ndisplayed in some parts of Euclid's work has been advantageous. As regularity\nwas left incompletely defined, people felt free to piopose their own\ndefinitions. This has led to a variety of descriptions of the regulai solids\nwhich provide alternative ways to study them. The different hypotheses can be\nweakened in many different ways and this gives a rich collection of ideas\nabout 'semiregular' polyhedra. (We may note in passing that Euclid did not\ndefine 'polyhedron' either—an omission which led to a wide variety of\ninterpretations of that term. We shall take this up in Chapter 5.) Let us\nreturn to our search for the original definition of regularity. Notice that\n\nWhat is regularity? 77 Euclid is careful to show how each solid can be\nconstructed in a circumscribing sphere. Plato, too, notes that the tetrahedron\nis the simplest solid figure which divides the surface of its circumsphere\ninto equal and similar parts. The other figures he describes are more complex\nsolids having the same property. It seems likely that this feature was the\nthird key property required to define regularity: the polyhedra with equal\nregular faces that can be inscribed in a sphere are precisely the five regular\nsolids. A more modern definition of a regular polyhedron is one whose faces\nand vertex figures are regular polygons. (In this case, the congruence of the\nfaces does not need to be specified since it can be deduced from the other\nconditions.) Roughly speaking, a vertex figure is the polygon you see after\nslicing off a corner in a way that removes the same amount of each edge.2 Many\ndefinitions of 'regular polyhedron' require the polyhedron to have equal\nregular faces.3 Some of the proposals for an extra condition to characterise\nregularity are collected in the following theorem. It does not matter which of\nthe five statements is chosen to complete the definition of regularity: the\ntheorem shows that they all lead to the same set of polyhedra. Theorem. Let P\nbe a convex polyhedron whose faces are congruent regular polygons. Then the\nfollowing statements about P are equivalent: (1) The vertices of P all lie on\na sphere. (2) All the dihedral angles of P are equal. (3) All the vertex\nfigures are regular polygons. (4) All the solid angles are congruent. (5) All\nthe vertices are surrounded by the same number of faces. Proof: The proof\nconsists of showing that (1)=^(2)=^(3)=^(4)=^(5)=^(1). (1)=>(2): If two\nadjacent faces of a polyhedron have all their vertices on the same sphere then\nthe dihedral angle between them depends on the radii of the circum- circles of\nthe two faces and the length of their common edge. Since all the faces of P\nare congruent, their circumcircles will all be the same size. Furthermore,\nsince all the faces are regular polygons, all the edges must have the same\nlength. Consequently, all the dihedral angles must be equal. 2 More precisely,\nI shall take a vertex figure to be the spherical polygon formed by the\nintersection of the faces surrounding a vertex with a small sphere centred on\nthat vertex. 3An example of a definition which does not require this\nexplicitly, nor even convexity, is the following proposed by H. S. M. Coxeter.\nA polyhedron is regular if there exist three concentric spheres one of which\ncontains all the vertices, one contains the midpoints of all the edges, and\none meets all the centres of all the faces.\n\n78 Chapter 2 (2)=>(3): The plane angles that surround a vertex determine the\nlengths of the sides of its vertex figure: a larger angle gives a longer side.\nSince all the plane angles in P are the same, all the vertex figures are\nequilateral. Moreover, the angles in the vertex figures are determined by the\ndihedral angles of P. If the dihedral angles are all equal then the vertex\nfigures are equiangular. An equilateral, equiangular polygon is regular (by\ndefinition). (3)=>(4): A vertex figure cuts off a solid angle from a\npolyhedron. If the vertex figure is a regular polygon then the solid angle has\nthe form of a right pyramid. The angles in a vertex figure determine the\ndihedral angles of the polyhedron, and conversely. If all the vertex figures\nare regular then all the dihedral angles must be equal. This means that the\nvertex figures all have the same number of sides, and hence that the solid\nangles are all congruent. (4)=>(5): If the solid angles are all congruent then\nthey are surrounded bv the same number of faces. (5)=>(1): The remaining\nimplication (as is often the case in this style of pioof) is far more subtle.\nIn fact, it seems to require the enumeration of all possible polyhedra\nsatisfying condition (5) and then verifying that each candidate satisfies\ncondition (1). The final proposition of the Elements (see page 75) shows that\nat most five different kinds of solid angle can be formed from regular\npolygons. In the preceding propositions, five polyhedra are constructed in\ntheir ciicumspheres, one with each type of solid angle. This, however, is not\nthe end of the argument. It is not immediately clear why there should be only\none polyhedron for each type of solid angle. Is the shape of the complete\npolyhedron constrained by the local behaviour at each vertex to such an extent\nthat a single possibility remains? It is easy to answer this question when\neach vertex is surrounded bv three faces. In this case the solid angles are\nrigid—they can take only one form. Fitting polygons together according to this\nrule guarantees a unique result. Therefore, the tetrahedron, the cube and the\ndodecahedron are the only polyhedra which can be made by fitting three\ncongruent regular polygons around each vortex. However, when four or more\nfaces surround each vertex there; is no such control. The contrast between the\ntwo situations is apparent in partly made models of polyhedra. Triangular\nvertex figures give rigidity to the structure so that a half-built\ndodecahedron is stiff and cannot be deformed. On the other hand, an unfinished\nmodel of an icosahedron is flexible—the local conditions on the vertices do\nnot give it any stability until it is practically complete. Experimenting with\nmodels will probably convince you that the icosahedron and the octahedron are\nunique but to prove this rigorously is not easy. To complete the proof we need\nto invoke the Rigidity Theorem—a topic we shall leturn to in Chapter 6. ■\n\nBending the rules 79 Bending the rules Regular polyhedra are often defined as\nthose having the same number of congruent regular faces meeting at each\nvertex. John Flinders Petrie (1907 1972) (son of the archaeologist mentioned\nin Chapter 1) found a new way of interpreting this condition. He and H. S. M.\nCoxeter had known each other since their school days and Coxeter recounts how\nhe first heard of his friend's discovery. One day in 1926, J. F. Petrie told\nme with much excitement that he had discovered two new regular polyhedra;\ninfinite, but without false vertices. When my incredulity had begun to subside\nhe described thvni to me: one consisting of squares, six at each vertex\n[Figure 2.19(a)], and one consisting of hexagons, four at each vertex [Figure\n2.19(h)]. It was useless to protest that there is no room for more than four\nsquares round a vertex. The trick is to let the faces go up and down in a kind\nof zig-zag formation so that the faces that adjoin a given 'horizontal' face\nlie alternately 'above' and 'below' it. When I understood this, I pointed out\na third possibility: hexagons, six at ouch vertex [Figure 2.19(c)].fc These\nstructures are not polyhedra in the conventional sense. They do not close up,\nforming a structure with an natural sense of what lies inside and what lies\noutside. Instead, they can be extended indefinitely in any direction: the\n'complete' polyhedra have infinitely many faces. Furthermore, each one\nseparates space into two immense labyrinths, both of the same shape. These\n'polyhedra' have become known as regular honeycombs or sponges. The\nArchimedean solids In the fifth book of his Mathematical Collection, Pappus\nattributes the discovery of thirteen polyhedra to Archimedes: Although many\nsolid figures having all kinds of faces can be conceived, those which appear\nto be regularly formed are most deserving of attention. These include not only\nthe five figures found in the godlike Plato • ■ • but also the solids,\nthirteen in number, which were discovered by Archimedes and are contained by\nequilateral and equiangular, but not similar, polygons.1 Pappus goes on to\ndescribe the thirteen figures. He arranges them in order according to the\ntotal number of faces, and lists the kinds of face that make up each\npolyhedron. These data are summarised in Table 2.20. Even though Archimedes'\nown account of them is now lost, the thirteen polyhedra illustrated\n\n80 Chapter 2 (a) (b) Figure 2.19. The three regular honeycombs. in Figure 2.21\nand in Plates 3 and 4 are known as the Archimedean solids. (They are sometimes\ncalled the semiregular polyhedra.) Some of these polyhedra have been\ndiscovered many times. According to Heron, the third solid on Pappus' list,\nthe cub-octahedron, was known to Plato. During the Renaissance, and especially\nafter the introduction of perspective into art, painters and craftsmen made\npictures of the Platonic solids. To vary their designs they sliced off the\ncorners and edges of these solids, naturally producing some of the Archimedean\nsolids as a result. The process of removing all the corners in a symmetrical\nfashion is called truncation.\n\nThe Archimedean solids 81 Faces 8 14 14 14 26 26 32 32 32 38 62 62 92\nTriangles 4 8 8 8 20 20 32 20 80 Squares 6 6 18 12 6 30 30 Numbers of\nPentagons 12 12 12 12 Hexagons 4 8 8 20 20 Octagons 6 6 Decagons 12 12 Table\n2.20. Composition of the Archimedean solids. Kepler rediscovered the whole set\nof thirteen solids and gave them the names by which they are known today. The\nfive Archimedean solids obtained by truncating the Platonic solids are given\nthe obvious names: 'truncated tetrahedron' for example. For Kepler, parts of\nthe edges are always retained in a truncated solid. If we allow deeper cuts to\nbe made, all three of the 14-faced Archimedean solids can be obtained by\nslicing the corners off either a cube or an octahedron to varying degrees (see\nFigure 2.22). The truncated cube and the truncated octahedron are most\nobviously derived from the Platonic solids in their respective names. The\nlatter polyhedron is also known as Kelvin's solid because William Thomson\n(Lord Kelvin) studied its space-filling properties. Kepler gave the name cub-\noctahedron to the solid midway between the cube and the octahedron. An\nanalogous situation holds for the three 32-faced solids: the ti unrated\ndodecahedron, the truncated icosahedron, and the icosi-dodecahedron. (The last\ntwo of these, especially the truncated icosahedron, may be familiar from the\npatterns on soccer balls.) The solids that Kepler calls the truncated cub-\noctahedron and the truncated icosi-dodecahedron are not true truncations.\nFigure 2.23(a) shows the result of truncating a cub-octahedron: not all of its\nfaces are regular polygons. The Archimedean figure is obtained by distorting\nthe figure so that the rectangles become square. Kepler himself recognised\nthis: [• • • a polyhedron] which I call a truncated cuboctahedron: not because\nit can be formed by truncation but because it is like a cuboctahedron that has\nbeen truncated. m\n\n82 Chapter 2 truncated tetrahedron cub-octahedron truncated octahedron\ntruncated cube rhomb-cub-octahedron great rhomb-cub-octahedron icosi-\ndodecahedron truncated icosahedron truncated dodecahedron Figure 2.21. The\nArchimedean solids.\n\nThe Archimedean solids 83 snub cube rhomb-icosi-dodecahedron great rhomb-\nicosi-dodecahedron snub dodecahedron Figure 2.21 (continued). Because of this\ndiscrepancy, alternative names have been proposed, the most common being\n'great rhomb-cub-octahedron'. Figure 2.24 shows that the solid Kepler calls\nthe rhomb-cub-octahedron4 (sometimes given the prefix 'small') has faces in\ncommon with three polyhedra: a cube, an octahedron, and the rhombus-faced\npolyhedron shown in Figure 2.23(b). His alternative name for this Archimedean\nsolid, sectus rhombus cuboctaedricus, indicates that it is formed by slicing\nthe corners off the rhombic polyhedron. This name is translated as 'truncated\nsolid rhombus' but Kepler makes a distinction between this truncation and the\nothers, for which he uses the adjective truncus rather than sectus. 4 The\nhyphenation of these names is not standard practice but I find it easier on\nthe eye when the names become so long.\n\n84 Chapter 2 Figure 2.22. The truncated cube, cub-octahedron and truncated\noctahedron can all be obtained by slicing through either a cube or an\noctahedron. Problem. The rhomb-icosi-dodecahedron has faces in common with\nanother rhombus-faced solid that we shall encounter later. Try to work out\nwhat it looks like. The two remaining Archimedean solids differ from the\nothers in several ways. For one thing, they cannot be derived from the\nPlatonic solids by a process of simple truncation, and consequently they have\nbeen discovered by relatively few (a) (b) Figure 2.23.\n\nThe Archimedean solids 85 Figure 2.24. The rhomb-cub-octahedron has face-\nplanes in common with three other polyhedra. people. They also lack any mirror\nsymmetry. This causes them to appear twisted, and it also means that they can\nexist in two forms, each a mirror image of the other—like left and right\nhands. Polyhedra related in this way are said to be enantiomorphic. The solid\nKepler called a snub cube actually has faces in common with both the cube and\nthe octahedron. For this reason some have suggested that 'snub cub-octahedron'\nwould be more appropriate but the name has not caught on. Similarly, the snub\ndodecahedron is related just as much to the icosahedron as to the\ndodecahedron. Problem. Explain why there is no 'snub tetrahedron'. If you try\nto construct one, you should find a familiar polyhedron. Kepler also\ninvestigated two other families of polyhedra made from regular polygons. A\nprism is formed from two n-sided polygons separated by a ring of n squares. An\nantiprism also contains two n-sided regular polygons, this time separated by a\nring of 2n equilateral triangles. An example of each kind is shown in Figure\n2.25: a pentagonal prism and a square antiprism. Figure 2.25. Pentagonal prism\nand square antiprism.\n\n86 Chapter 2 Problem. The square prism and the triangular antiprism are better\nknown by other names. Identify them. Polyhedra with regular faces Pappus'\ndescription of the Archimedean solids as figures 'contained by equilateral and\nequiangular, but not similar, polygons' is insufficient to characterise them.\nJust as Euclid's description of the regular polyhedra as solids bounded bv\nregular polygons is incomplete, so Pappus' condition requires only that a\npolyhedron has regular polygons as faces—it does not say anything about their\narrangement. There are many polyhedra bounded by regular polygons. There are\nten whose faces are all congruent: the Platonic solids and the deltahedra.\nBesides the thirteen Archimedean solids, there are about 75 convex polyhedra\nwhose1 faces are regular polygons of more than one kind. One way to construct\nmany of these is to dissect the Platonic and Archimedean solids into smaller\npieces. The octahedron, for example, can be separated into two square-based\npyramids. Pentagonal pyramids can be shaved off an icosahedron in several ways\nto produce five different fragments (see Figure 2.26). The regular-faced\npolyhedra were enumerated empirically by Norman Johnson: some computer-\nassisted calculations done by Victor Abramovitch Zalgaller showed that his\nlist was complete. Many of these polyhedra are formed bv joining smaller\nregular-faced polyhedra together and Johnson used this property as the basis\nfor a systematic nomenclature. The polyhedra which cannot be separated into\nregular-faced pieces are the building blocks and Johnson calls these\nelementary polyhedra. A regular-faced polyhedron is elementary if it cannot be\nseparated by a plane into two smaller regular-faced polyhedra. All the other\nregular-faced polyhedra can be formed by sticking these basic units together\nin different ways. The tetrahedron, the cube and the dodecahedron are\nelementary, as are nine of the Archimedean solids. The prisms, and all the\nantiprisms except the octahedron furnish further examples of elementary\npolyhedra. The cub-octahedron and the icosi-dodecahedron can both be split\ninto 'hemispheres'. In Johnson's nomenclature, the former hemisphere is an\nexample of a cupola, the latter is a rotunda. The general cupola is formed\nfrom an n-gon and a 2n-gon sitting in parallel planes connected by n triangles\nand n, squares joined alternately in a ring. The cub-octahedron hemisphere is\na triangular cupola. The square cupola and the pentagonal cupola are 'caps'\noff the rhomb-cub-octahedron and the rhomb-icosi-dodecahedron, respectively.\nOther elementary polyhedra arc1 produced by removing such caps from these two\npolyhedra. The removal of opposite square cupolas from a rhomb-cub-octahedron\nleaves an octagonal prism. The rhomb-icosi-dodecahedron can be 'diminished' by\nthe removal of one, two or three\n\nPOLYHEDRA WITH REGULAR FACES 87 pentagonal cupolas. These fragments of the\nArchimedean solids are illustrated in Figure 2.27. Besides the fragments of\nthe Platonic and Archimedean solids there are a further eight elementary\npolyhedra. One of these is the Siamese dodecahedron— the deltahedron with\ntwelve faces. The other seven, together with Johnson's names, are shown in\nFigure 2.28. The interrelationships between the different families of regular-\nfaced polyhedra are illustrated schematically in Figure 2.29. The 31\nelementary polyhedra fit together to produce 71 other polyhedra with regular\nfaces. Sometimes the same set of pieces can be put together in more than one\nway.

These are most easily described as the effect of\nrotating various 'caps' by 36°: (i) twist a single cap, (ii) twist two\nopposite caps, (iii) twist two non-opposite caps, (iv) twist three caps.\n\nPOLYHEDRA WITH REGULAR FACES 89 hebe-spheno-mega-corona triangular hebe-\nspheno-rotunda dispheno-cingulum Figure 2.28. More elementary regular-faced\npolyhedra. Chemists use the term isomerism to refer to an analogous situation:\nmolecules can differ structurally but be composed of the same set of atoms.\nMolecules related in this way are called isomers (from the Greek words meaning\n'same parts'). Adopting this terminology, we can say that the rhomb-icosi-\ndodecahedron has five isomeric forms. Enantiomerism is a special case of\nisomerism. There is one isomeric form of an Archimedean solid that is quite\nwell-known. While trying to make a model of the (small) rhomb-cub-octahedron,\nJ. C.

The polyhedron he made is shown in Figure\n2.30. This polyhedron has been discovered and rediscovered many times. It is\npossible that Kepler was familiar with it. It has been called by a variety of\nnames: the pseudo rhomb-cub-octahedron, Miller's solid, and elongated square\ngyro bicupola. The last of these names is Johnson's and it indicates how the\nsolid is constructed from elementary polyhedra: take two square cupolas\n(square bicupola) rotated relative to one another (gyro) and separated by a\nprism (elongated). For brevity I shall refer to it as Miller's solid. Figure\n2.30. Miller's solid has congruent solid angles but they are not all\nequivalent. Out of this whole menagerie of polyhedra bounded by 'equilateral\nand equiangular, but not similar, polygons' what is special about the\nArchimedean solids? What distinguishes them from the others? Pappus gives us a\nhint when he says that they are included among the polyhedra 'which appear to\nbe regularly formed'. This is certainly true, but what does 'regularly formed'\nactually mean? Earlier in the chapter, we saw that an extra condition was\nrequired to complete Euclid's characterisation of the regular polyhedra, and\nthat any one of five statements ranging from the existence of a circumsphere\nto the congruence of the vertices proved to be adequate. How can Pappus'\nstatement be extended so that it characterises the Archimedean solids? Simply\nrequiring that the polyhedra have a circumsphere is not enough since the\npyramids and all the isomeric forms of the Archimedean solids have this\nproperty. Surprisingly, the much stronger condition of requiring that all the\nsolid angles are congruent is also insufficient: Miller's solid has this\nproperty. Because of this, some writers have suggested that this polyhedron\nshould be counted as a fourteenth Archimedean solid. This, however, misses the\npoint. The true Archimedean solids, like the Platonic solids, have an\naesthetic quality which Miller's solid does not possess. This attractiveness\ncomes from their high degree of symmetry—a property that is easily appreciated\nand understood on an intuitive level. It is not the congruence of the solid\nangles that is the important characteristic but rather the fact that the solid\nangles are all indistinguishable from one another. The vertices in an\nArchimedean solid are\n\n92 Chapter 2 surrounded by the same faces arranged in the same way, and each\nvertex plays the same role in the polyhedron as a whole. For Miller's solid\nthis is not the case. The twist allows us to distinguish between two kinds of\nvertices: those near the 'equator', and those in the 'polar regions'. This\nbecomes clear when the polyhedron is turned onto its side—we can detect that\nit has been moved. If the true rhomb-cub-octahedron is turned on its side in\nthe same way, it looks untouched—if we did not observe the motion take place,\nwe would be unable to tell that a change had occurred. These observations are\nthe beginnings of a detailed investigation of symmetry. Although easy to\nidentify qualitatively, symmetry is quite tricky to quantify. The mathematical\nanalysis of symmetry is explored more fully in Chapter 8. Applying some of the\nideas developed there in Chapter 10, we shall sec that the Archimedean solids\nare 'vertex transitive'. For now, it suffices to recognise;, as Archimedes and\nPappus did, the natural beauty of regularly formed figures.\n\nFrom Livrc de Perspective by Jean Cousin, 1568.\n\n95 Decline and Rebirth of Polyhedral Geometry At age twenty, Alexander\nsucceeded his father Philip II as king of Macedonia. Two years earlier in\n338BC Athens had fallen to Philip as he extended his territory southwards into\nGreece. Alexander continued his father's expansionist conquests. Within five\nyears he had established an empire that extended eastwards to India and\nincluded Egypt, Syria and Persia. He chose a well-placed port on the north\nAfrican coast to be the site of a new city that was to be his\ncapital—Alexandria. After Alexander's death in 323BC, the empire was divided\nand the Egyptian kingdom came under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty. The\nPtolemies shared Alexander's vision for the new city and it became a great\ncentre of cultme and learning. To promote science and philosophy, a school and\na library weie built and by 300BC this 'university' had attracted a\ndistinguished staff. It is heie that the last contributions of any\nsignificance were made to the history of polyhcdra for well over a thousand\nyears. In this chapter we trace the steps of our subject as the various\nstrands unravel, sleep-walk across vast distances in space and time, and then\nare reunited as the study of polyhedra emerges to flourish once more. The\nAlexandrians Alexandria was a prosperous, cosmopolitan city at a junction of\nseveral trade routes. Jews settled there as merchants and traders. Greeks\narrived with Ptolemy I. Romans, Persians, Arabs, and Indians also inhabited\nthe city. The Ptolemies recognised the importance of the schools of\nPythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle and sought to provide a climate conducive to\nscholarship. The teachers at the university they established came from the\nmajor cultural centres and many were trained in mathematics. Besides\nmathematics, the students were taught literature, medicine and astronomy. The\nlast two subjects also had a mathematical content (medicine because it made\nuse of astrology). Although much of the syl-\n\n96 Chapter 3 labus was based on Greek learning, other cultures exerted their\ninfluence, most notably the Egyptian and Babylonian. Where Greek geometry had\nconcentrated on qualitative relationships, the Alexandrians sought something\nmore quantitative and applicable to the real world. The inductive spirit of\nmathematics, the 'how to' recipe approach used in the early Egyptian and\nBabylonian texts returned, especially in arithmetic. Many of the great\ngeometers taught or studied at the university. It is probably at Alexandria,\nwith access to the great library, that Euclid compiled his Elements of\ngeometry. The final book of the Elements is the high point of the classical\nstudy of polyhedra. It contains the fundamental properties of the reguhu\nsolids and presents the mathematics of their construction and basic\nrelationships such as comparisons of volume. Such was the prestige of the\nEuclidean canon that other books have been appended to it at various times.\nThe first of these, the so-called Fourteenth Book of the Elements, is thought\nto have been written by Hypsicles in the second century BC. He was another\nteacher at Alexandria. The book contains further properties of the regular\nsolids. It is based on work by Aristaeus and Apollonius. According to Pappus,\nthese were the mathematicians who, together with Euclid, comprised the 'three\ngeometers skilled in analysis'. The preface to book xiv recounts a meeting\nbetween Basilides of Tvre and the author's father in Alexandria. On one\noccasion, when looking into the tract written by Apollonius about the\ncomparison of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in one and the same\nsphere, that is to say, on the question what ratio they bear to one another,\nthey came to the conclusion that Apollonius' treatment of it in this book was\nnot correct; accordingly, us I understood from my father, they proceeded to\namend and rewrite it. But I myself afterwards came across another book\npublished by Apollonius, containing a demonstration of the matter in question,\nand I was greatly attracted by his investigation of the problem. Now the book\npublished by Apollonius is accessible to all; for it has a large circulation\nin a form which seems to have been the result of later careful elaboration.\"\nIt appears that Hypsicles' father saw an early version of Apollonius' work and\nthat a complete proof was widely circulated sometime later as Comparison of\nthe Dodecahedron with the Icosahedron. The theorem attributed to Apollonius\nstates that the surface areas of the two solids are in the same ratio as their\nvolumes. Aristeaus' contribution to book XIV is a theorem proved in his now\nlost work The Comparison of the Five Figures. It states that if an icosahedron\nand a dodecahedron are inscribed in the same sphere then the same circle\ncircumscribes a triangular face of the former solid and a pentagonal face of\nthe latter.\n\nMathematics and astronomy 97 Mathematics and astronomy Alongside the\ndevelopment of mathematics, the Greeks laid the foundations of another\nscience: astronomy. Many early civilisations observed the heavens in order to\nkeep track of time. The positions of the planets and the stars established\ntheir calendar. The desire to record and map the changes in the sky naturally\nled to the study of the geometry of the sphere. The Pythagoreans, who studied\nthe properties of great circles, may not have distinguished between astronomy\nand spherical geometry: the word 'sphaeric' applied to both. Plato's\ninsistence that nature could be understood through mathematics, and the idea\nthat the perfect heavenly bodies would follow paths based on the perfect\nfigure (a circle) led to the development of the epicyclic system. Many\nmathematicians spent some time studying astronomical problems. Euclid wrote\nabout spherical geometry in his Phaenomena. Hypsicles and Apollonius are known\nas astronomers as well as mathematicians. Apollonius was very familiar with\nthe epicyclic theory and he determined the points of orbits where planets\nappear stationary. In On the Risings of the Stars Hypsicles used the\nBabylonian division of the circle into 360° and divided each degree into sixty\nsubunits, and each of these into sixty, and so on. This was the first time\nthat degrees were mentioned in a Greek manuscript. Unlike the Greeks, who were\nsolely interested in exact relationships, the Alexandrians also wanted to use\nphysical measurements. This desire to be able to calculate the positions of\nheavenly bodies led to the development of trigonometry—work which was done\nlargely by the astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes. He divided the diameter of a\ncircle into 120 units and each of these into sixty, and so on. Using this\ndivision and the division of the circumference into degrees he made a table of\nchords—what would be equivalent in modern times to tabulating the sine\nfunction. Much of the work on trigonometry and its applications to astronomy\nwas collated by Claudius Ptolemy1 (c.lOO-c.168). His Mathematica Syntaxis is\nnow usually known as Almagest after its Arabic title. It was the dominant work\nin its field for many centuries and held authority similar to that of the\nElements. The geocentric epicyclic theory that it contained was not superseded\nfoi over a thousand years. Besides inventing trigonometry, astronomers tackled\nanother mathematical problem: how to make a map of a round object on a flat\nsurface. Hipparchus used orthographic (or parallel) projection to produce a\nmap of the heavens, a task that involves mapping the hemispherical firmament\nonto a disc. He possibly knew the technique of stereographic projection. This\nwas certainly known to Ptolemy, who used it in his Planisphaerium, where he\ndescribes the mathematics underlying the construction of an astrolabe. Not\npart of the ruling family.\n\n98 Chapter 3 Heron of Alexandria As has been remarked above, the mathematics\nof the Alexandrian period had a different bias from that produced by the\nclassical Greeks. It is concerned more with practical problems than with pure\ngeometry. One person who exemplifies this Alexandrian outlook is Heron\n(c.62ad). Although Heron was familiar with Euclidean geometry, he was not a\nclassical geometer. He was more practically minded, an engineer and inventor\nof great ingenuity. The ancient writers attribute many treatises to Heron,\nsome of which survive intact, some only in corrupted form after revision by\nlater editors, and others not at all. His works are classified into two\ncategories: mathematical and mechanical. The latter class contains the\nPneumatica which describes his well-known water and steam powered automata,\nMechanics, and the Dioptra which describes a kind of theodolite used for\nsurveying. In this last work Heron gives details of an eclipse—information\nthat helps to determine his approximate dates. The most important of Heron's\nmathematical writings is his Metrica. It deals with the measurement of area,\nprogresses to volume measurement, and then considers the division of figures\ninto parts of a given ratio. It contains the following 'Heronic formula' for\nthe area of a triangle: if a triangle has sides of lengths a, b and c, and if\ns = 72(0 + b + c) denotes half the perimeter then its area is given by area =\nys(s — a)(s — b)(s — c). It also includes a generalisation of the formula for\nthe volume of a truncated pyramid. The solid shown in Figure 3.1 has\nrectangular base and top lying in parallel planes. The sides have lengths a,\nb, c, d as shown and the height of the solid is h. Its volume is given as\nvolume = h{l/4{a + c)(b + d) + i/i2(a - c){b - d)). Problem. Verify this is\ncorrect. In the main, the results presented in Heron's compendium are taken\nfrom works by Greek and Alexandrian mathematicians. They are far superior to\nthe Figure 3.1.\n\nPappus of Alexandria 99 traditions preserved by the Egyptian priests as is\napparent from the inscriptions at Edfu (see Figure 1.1). Unlike the classical\nwriters, who were satisfied to exhibit relationships between quantities, Heron\nwas concerned with numerical answers. Intermingled with the accurate formulae,\nsome of which are proved, aie others which give only approximate solutions.\nThe latter would have appealed to craftsmen who would have found extracting\nroots difficult. Like the Arabs after him, who continued the development of\nalgebra, Heron was uninhibited by the restrictions of the Greek geometric\nalgebra. He was happy to consider expressions equivalent to our x2 + y or x2 x\ny2—things that would have appalled the Greeks, the former being an area added\nto a length, the other a four-dimensional quantity without a geometrical\ninterpretation. Pappus of Alexandria In the 300 years from Apollonius to\nClaudius Ptolemy, the only mathematicians of significance to our story are\nHypsicles and Heron. Other mathematicians of the period are known mainly\nthrough the writings of commentators; their original works have not survived.\nPappus, a commentator of the eailv fourth century, has been mentioned in\nprevious chapters because of his Mathematical Collection. It is only from this\nwork, for example, that we know the discoverer of the Archimedean solids.\nPappus also wrote commentaries on the Elements, and Ptolemy's Almagest and\nPlanisphaerium. The Mathematical Collection provides us with a lot of\ninformation. It is a handbook to the classics, a systematic account of the\nmost important works of Greek mathematics. It includes historical comments and\ndescriptions of the contents of many works now lost. Since he finds it\nnecessary to include these, it is likely that many of the works were lost or\ninaccessible even in his own time. When an original text is easily available,\nPappus gives alternative proofs or extends the results in some way. In book\nin, for example, he discusses the regular solids. Whereas Euclid's\npresentation shows how to construct each solid and then its circumsphere,\nPappus shows how to inscribe each solid in a given sphere. In a later book he\nconsiders isoperimetric problems. These involve comparisons between figures\nwith boundaries of equal size. For example, he shows that a sphere has greater\nvolume than any regular solid with the same surface aiea. Pappus precedes his\nproofs by an analysis which explains how his constructions arise. This is\nunusual for, except for the odd hint, the classical writers do not say why\nsubjects were investigated nor how results were obtained. Their primary\nobjective was to organise their achievements in a systematic fashion and to\npresent the formal polished arguments needed to establish their results.\nAlthough concise, this strict deductive presentation style has some\ndisadvantages. It can give the impression that mathematics is created in this\nway. We should\n\n100 Chapter 3 not forget that, before such an account can be written, many\nexperiments have been tried and paths explored. Conjecture comes before proof.\nAnother problem with the Euclidean style of presentation is that it is often\ndifficult to see how the proofs were discovered. Even if you can decipher the\narguments, you may not gain any insight as to how a similar problem could be\ntackled. The proofs of all the propositions in the Elements are synthetic they\nwork on the 'bottom-up' principle, starting from what is known and building to\nthe conclusion. This provides a good basis for logical arguments but rarelv\nallows the reader any hint of the steps that led to it. Very often the reveise\npiocess was involved. The analytic approach uses the 'top-down' philosophy. In\nthis case we start with the conclusion and work backwards towards what we\nalready know. With luck, all the steps involved can then be reversed. These\nproblems with the classical texts may go a long way towards explaining the\npopularity of commentaries. Plato's heritage Towards the end of the third\ncentury AD interest in Plato's philosophy began to be revived in Alexandria.\nThis Neoplatonism soon spread. Plotinus, its founder, travelled to Rome and\nset up his own school; others took it to Greece and Constantinople.\nIamblichus, who was considered a leading authority on Neoplatonism for 200\nyears, introduced a mystical interpretation of some concepts and placed an\nincreased emphasis on religious observance. The last great Neoplatonist was\nProclus. Educated at Alexandria, and by Plutarch at Plato's academy, he later\nbecame head of the academy whence\" he received the title 'Diodochus', meaning\nsuccessor. He wrote commentaries and critiques on many aspects of Greek\nculture. His commentaiy on the fiist book of Euclid's Elements is invaluable\nbecause of its historical passages. He had access to many works that have not\nsurvived, including the history oi geometry written by Eudemus and the\nhistorical passages in Geminus' work, tie also wiote commentaries on many of\nPlato's dialogues, including the Tiumeus and Republic. The Timaeus became one\nof the most influential works written in antiquity. The importance of the\noriginal text declined as Greek became less widelv understood. The language\nwas lost in the West after the separation of the Roman empire; in western Asia\nit became replaced by Syriac. However, the fust pait of Plato's dialogue\npassed into Europe in Chalcidius' Latin version and anothei fragment preserved\nby Cicero. The Platonic message appealed to manv thinkeis of the Dark Ages and\nhad a strong influence on religious thought. The mixture of rational\nexplanation and teleology, and its creator god, fitted well with Christian\nnotions and many Platonic ideas were introduced into Christianity In the West\nthis was largely the work of Augustine but Byzantine scholars had a similar\ninfluence in the East.\n\nThe decline of geometry 101 Copies of Chalcidius' work could be found in the\nlibraries of many medieval monasteries. The monks also kept Neoplatonic works\nwritten by Boethius (c.475- 524). He was a Roman, educated in both Latin and\nGreek, and is best known for his book On the Consolation of Philosophy. He\nalso translated most of Aristotle's work on logic into Latin as well as some\nfragments of Euclidean geometry and Nichomachus' Arithmetic. The paucity of\nthe works is illustrated by his geometry text: it contains statements of a few\npropositions from books I, in and IV of the Elements without proof. Later,\nthese came to be considered the height of mathematical achievement. The\ndecline of geometry In the sixth century, a second book became added to the\nEuclidean canon. Like Euclid's book xm and Hypsicles' book xiv, this so-called\nbook xv contains further propositions on the regular solids. It has three\nparts which seem to have been written at different times. The first part,\nwhich may have been around in Pappus' time, describes how some regular solids\ncan be inscribed in others. In the second part the numbers of edges and solid\nangles of the five solids are given. The third part shows how to calculate the\ndihedral angle between the faces of any Platonic solid. This is done by\nconstructing an isosceles triangle whose apex equals the dihedral angle. The\nrules for drawing these triangles are attributed to 'Isidorus our great\nteacher'. This refers to Isidorus of Miletus, one of the architects of the\ngreat church of Saint Sophia in Constantinople. He also had a school in the\ncity and wrote commentaries on the Elements. The fifteenth book does not reach\nthe high standard of the work to which it is appended. Mathematics in general,\nand geometry in particular, had begun to decline about the beginning of the\nfirst century AD. Few new results were obtained and mathematicians were\nreduced to studying the works of their predecessors, finding alternative\nproofs, or filling in gaps where manuscripts had been lost. The Greeks had\nconcentrated on geometry and had restricted this to deductions from the\nproperties of lines and circles. The main reason for doing this was to solve\nthe problem of existence: objects could be constructed using simple operations\nto ensure that definitions were consistent. This narrowness of vision and the\ninsistence on completeness allowed a thorough examination of a small field to\nbe conducted. But the Greeks' conception of mathematics had severe\nlimitations. They valued the aesthetic beauty of abstract mathematics and\nwanted their knowledge to be secured on the solid foundations of obviously\ntrue axioms. This led them to reject any notion that involved the infinite\nwhether it be infinitely large or infinitesimally small objects, or endless\nprocesses. Even the length of the diagonal of a unit square was never fully\naccepted as a number. Irrational quantities were limited to geometric\ninterpretations. Thus Greek contributions were mainly in the areas of number\ntheory and geometry. They mined\n\n102 Chapter 3 the vein of line and circle geometry so thoroughly that it was\nhard to sec how to continue. Further progress in the same direction was very\ndifficult. The Alexandrians, and those who followed them, had to broaden their\noutlook in order to proceed. Geometry continued to be studied but it did not\nmake any major advances. Instead, people concentrated on arithmetic and\nalgebra (subjects where the Greeks felt inhibited) and trigonometry, the\nmathematics motivated by astronomy. These were young subjects for\ninvestigation and could be advanced relatively easily. With the rise of\nAlexandria, the Greek schools had gone into decline. The Romans, who\ncontrolled central and northern Italy and the Greek colonies in southern Italy\nand Sicily, conquered Greece in 146BC, and Mesopotamia in 64bc. Unable to\nignore a major power on the north African coast, they attacked Alexandria.\nPart of the library was destroyed when they set fire to the Egyptian fleet at\nharbour in the city. Some of the manuscripts escaped this tragedy only to be\ndestroyed later by Christian and then Moslem raids on the city. The first of\nthese was a consequence of Theodocius' order in 392 to destroy Greek temples\nthroughout the empire. The spread of Christianity had led Constantine to adopt\nit as the official religion, giving the Christians greatly increased\ninfluence. Opposed to any pagan learning (which included much Greek thought)\nthey sought to eradicate it. Plato's academy lasted until 529 but this, too,\ncame to an end when the Byzantine emperor Justinian closed all the Greek\nschools. The rise of Islam The fall of the Roman empire in the mid-fifth\ncentury signalled Europe's descent into the Dark Ages. East-West trade ceased,\nengineering projects lay abandoned, many skills were forgotten. The Church\nbecame a powerful body and exerted its influence on many aspects of life.\nLatin, the language of the Church, became the language of scholarship. A tiny\nremnant of the former learning was preserved in the monasteries but there was\na general disinterest in the physical world. Spiritual concerns were not\nconfined to Europe. The seventh century witnessed intense religious fervour in\nAfrica and western Asia. As Europe was being overrun by Huns, Goths and\nVandals, the Arabs united under Mohammed and began to build the Islamic\nempire. The capture of Egypt and Alexandria in 640 meant many of the remaining\nmanuscripts were burned. Most of the scholars fled the city. Many, seeking\nrelative safety, travelled to Constantinople taking their precious manuscripts\nwith them. By 642 the Moslem conquest of Persia was complete. During the next\nhundred years Islam spread east across India to the Chinese border and west\nacross north Africa and southern Italy to Spain and southwest France. The\nearlv political centre of this empire was at Damascus. In 755 the empire split\ninto two kingdoms:\n\nThabit ibn Qurra 103 the Umayyad caliphate reestablished itself in Cordoba in\nsouthern Spain and the Abbasids remained in the East. The second Abbasid\ncaliph, al-Mansur, moved his capital to Baghdad. The city was to become a\nflourishing cultural and intellectual centre—a new Alexandria. The ambitious\nprogramme was carried out by caliphs Harun al-Rashid and al-Mamun. They\nerected a library, an observatory, and an institute for translation and\nresearch known as the 'House of Wisdom'. Together these housed some of the\ngreatest scholars of the period. Here, they had access to all the major Greek\nworks, either in Greek or as translations into Syriac or Hebrew. The empire\nsubsumed any Alexandrian learning that had survived. People were sent to seek\nout and buy manuscripts in foreign lands. In fact, manuscripts were so highly\nprized that al-Mamun obtained them as part of peace treaties. The classical\nworks of science and mathematics were translated and became part of the Arabic\nheritage. Moslem geometry owes most to writers like Euclid, Archimedes and\nHeron but other civilisations also had things to contribute. For example, an\napproximate construction for a regular heptagon in its circumcircle is known\nas the Indian rule which may indicate its origin. The side of the heptagon is\ntaken to be the altitude of one of the six equilateral triangles forming a\nhexagon inscribed in the same circle. (Recall that an exact construction for\nthis polygon using the Euclidean tools is impossible.) Thabit ibn Qurra One\noutstanding translator, who also made original contributions to algebra and\ngeometry, was Thabit ibn Qurra (836-901). He belonged to the Mandaean sect\nwhose astrology had much in common with that of the Babylonians. The Man-\ndaeans produced many astronomers and mathematicians. Thabit's gift for\nlanguages and his mathematical ability gave Arabic some of its best\ntranslations. They also include fine illustrations. Where men less skilled in\nmathematics copied manuscripts they carefully left spaces for diagrams but,\nunfortunately, many have not been drawn in. Thabit's Kitab al-Mafrudat (Book\nof Data) was very popular during the Middle Ages and was included in a\ncompilation volume by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, together with the Elements and the\nAlmagest. It contains problems in elementary geometry, geometric algebra and\nsome constructions. Another work, Kitab & Misahat al-Ashkal al-Musattaha\nwa'1-Mujassama (Book on the Measurement of Plane and Solid Figures) contains\nrules for computing the areas of plane figures and the surface areas and\nvolumes of solids. It contains a rule by Thabit (though his proof has not\nsurvived) for calculating the volumes of truncated pyramids and cones. If A\nand B are the areas of the base and the top, and h is the height of such a\nsolid then its volume is given by\n\n104 Chapter 3 volume = 1/3h [A + \\\\[AB + B) . He also wrote on the\n'construction of a circumscribed solid with fourteen faces'— the cub-\noctahedron. Abu'l-Wafa The last great representative of the Baghdad school of\nmathematicians was Abu'l- Wafa (940-998). Of Persian descent, he moved to\nBaghdad in 959. His work Kitab Fi Ma Yahtaj Ilayh al-Kuttab Wa'1-ummal Mm Ilm\nal-Hisib (Book on What Scribes and Businessmen Need from Arithmetic) was very\npopular. In it he sets out the methods of calculation used by merchants and\nfinance clerks in a systematic manner. He also gives some methods used by\nsurveyors and ridicules the 72(0 + b) ^-/2(0 + d) rule for the area of\nquadrilaterals. He remarks that it is obviously incorrect and rarely\ncorresponds to the truth. Another of his works, the Kitab Fi Ma Yahtaj Ilayh\nal-Sani Min al-Amal al-Handasiyya (Book on What the Artisan Needs from\nGeometry) describes two- and three-dimensional constructions. Some of them are\noriginal but many are taken from Euclid, Archimedes, Heron and Pappus. He\nincludes constructions of Platonic and some Archimedean polyhedra in their\ncircumspheres. Most constructions are exact and use the Euclidean tools but a\nfew are good approximations such as the construction of a heptagon. However,\nAbu'l-Wafa is best known for his constructions using straight edge and\ncompasses of fixed opening. These so-called rusty compass constructions had\nbeen studied earlier but he conducted an extensive exploration of the field\nsolving a large number of problems. The inclusion of these constructions in a\nbook for craftsmen is easily explained— in practical applications they are\nmore accurate than the standard Euclidean methods. Europe rediscovers the\nclassics At the turn of the eleventh century, Christianity began to surge back\nin northern Spain, and the East was overrun by the Seljuk Turks. The following\ntwo centuries also saw the crusades. Through these, and the revived\nMediterranean trade routes, northern peoples came into contact with many new\nideas. They also became aware of the ancient Greek learning. As knowledge of\nthe Greek classics began to filter into western Europe, scholars travelled to\nAfrica, Spain, and the Near East to buy manuscripts. They sought both Arabic\ntranslations of Greek texts and Moslem learning. Much of it became easily\naccessible when Toledo was recaptured by the Christians in 1085. Like the\nninth century, the twelth century became a century of translation. Latin\nversions of works by Euclid, Ptolemy,\n\nOptics 105 Aristotle, and Archimedes soon appeared. Just as the Moslems had\nsought out scientific works, the Europeans also concentrated on science paying\nlittlo attention to literature. This influx of Greek learning led scholars to\nexamine the physical world around them. Attempts at rational explanations of\nphenomena became increasingly more common. Although the first half of the\nTimaeus had been available in Latin since the fourth century, it had not\nattracted much attention. Now it was studied in the cathedral schools and the\nPlatonic vision of understanding nature through mathematics reinforced their\nnew way of looking at the world. Chalcid- ius' translation did not include\nPlato's own geometric theory of the universe -his atomic theory based on the\nregular solids. The principal source of knowledge of this theory came from\nAristotle's criticism in De Caelo et Mundo. This was translated into Latin in\nthe early thirteenth century and Aristotle's vigorous attack was almost\nuniversally accepted. A part of the Timaeus that medieval scholars found more\nrelevant was Plato's discussion of light and vision. The science of optics was\nvirtually unknown in medieval Europe but by the Renaissance it had become a\nuniversity subject. Optics Speculation on the nature of light and vision goes\nback to antiquity. Gieek thought on the subject was collected by Euclid in the\nthird century bc and recorded in his Optica. It postulates that light travels\nin straight lines, and that light rays connect the eye and the object being\nobserved. The phenomenon of sight was explained in various ways by different\nschools of philosophy. Some proposed that the eye was a source of light rays\nwhich then interacted with the object; others that the object itself emitted\nan image-like essence which radiated in all directions carrying the form of\nthe object to the eye. Euclid, however, does not concern himself with the\nphysiology of sight, but concentrates on the geometry. Irrespective of the\nmechanism involved, if light travels in straight lines then the rays which\nconvey the image of an object to the eye can be thought of as a pyramid or\ncone with the eye at the apex and the object as the base. The principles of\ngeometry can be applied to this pyramid, and Euclid showed that the apparent\nsize of an object depends on the angle at the apex. The largei the angle, the\nlarger the object appears to be. Claudius Ptolemy also wrote on optics. He\ndiscussed reflection and miirors, and refraction. He was also interested in\nthe perception of colour. He noted that light rays reflected from a surface\ntake on its colour, and that the more distant an object is, the duller it\nappears. Artists of his day made use of the latter phenomenon applying bright\ncolours for near objects and darker shades for those farther away. This\ntechnique is now called atmospheric perspective.\n\n106 Chapter 3 The Moslems investigated mirrors and lenses, spherical\naberration, and the formation of rainbows. The most influential writer was Abu\nali al-Hasan ibn al- Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965-1040), known in the West as\nAlhazen. He maintained that light was produced by the sun and candles, and\nthat when an object is illuminated by such a source some of the light is\nreflected towards the eye. Despite much experimentation, he was unable to\nfully explain the properties of i ('fraction. However, he used the phenomenon\nto give an explanation of the visual process. Drawing on the writings of\nAristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy and Galen, he used the visual pyramid and the laws\nof optical geometry to show how an image could be conveyed into the eye from\nwhere the form of the object can be recognised by the brain. Alhazen's book\nKitab al-Manazir was introduced into Europe in a Latin translation entitled\nPerspectiva. Around 1265 John Peckham wrote Perspectiva Communis, which was\nessentially a summary of Alhazen's work. It was very popular and achieved a\nwide circulation. At this time the Latin word 'perspectiva' referred to the\nstudy of optics and visual perception. It was not concerned with what we think\nof as perspective: an artistic technique for representing space on a flat\nsurface. Later, the notion that viewing a painting should be like looking\nthrough an open window was connected with the visual pyramid of light rays\nconverging on the eye. Mathematics was then applied to justify the artistic\nprocess: if a painting is to be a cross-section of the visual pyramid then\nnatural perspective (optics) explained the geometric constructions used in\nartificial perspective (art). As we shall see below, ait was one of the\nimportant factors in the rediscovery of solid geometry. Campanus' sphere The\ntwelth-century translations of scientific and mathematical works were mainly\nfrom Arabic sources. Translations of the Elements were made by people such as\nAdelard of Bath and Gerard of Cremona. Gerard's translation was one of the\nbetter versions since he used one of the best Arabic sources—a translation\nmade by Thabit. However, the most widely used edition of the Elements until\nthe Renaissance was not a direct translation. It was written in the late\n125()'s by Campanus of Novara and is a reworking of several earlier editions.\nAt least one of his sources seems to be based on Adelard's translation.\nCampanus was a competent mathematician who understood and communicated\nEuclid's geometry well. His clear exposition of all fifteen books became the\nversion of Euclid read in the Middle Ages and, subsequently, the first to\nappear in print. It retained its position as the definitive version of the\nElements until translations from Greek sources appeared in the sixteenth\ncentury. In proposition 17 of book XII Euclid shows how to construct a\npolyhedron sandwiched between two concentric spheres. (He goes on to apply\nEudoxus'\n\nCollecting and spreading the classics 107 method of exhaustion to this setup\nto show that the volume of a sphere varies as the cube of its diameter.) The\nconstruction produces a polyhedron with n rings, each containing 2n faces. So\nthe polyhedral sphere has 2n2 face's in total. The 72-faced example (shown in\nFigure 3.2) obtained by taking n to be six was described by Campanus. During\nthe Renaissance this polyhedron attained a status and popularity equal to that\nof the Platonic solids, as we shall sec; later. The construction of this\npolyhedral sphere is outlined below. Proposition. How to construct a\npolyhedron which approximates a sphere. Let JV and S be the North and South\npoles of a sphere and let C be its equatorial circle. Inscribe in C a regular\npolygon with an even number of sides, say 2n. We can now construct n circles,\neach of which passes through the two poles and two opposite corners of the\nequatorial polygon. Into each of these circles we can inscribe a regular\n2n-gon so that the points N and S appear as corners. These correspond to lines\nof longitude on the sphere. The polyhedron is completed by connecting up the\nvertices of these n polygons with lines of constant latitude in planes\nparallel to the equator. The result when n = 6 is shown in Figure 3.2. ■\nFigure 3.2. A polyhedron which approximates a sphere. Collecting and spreading\nthe classics The thirteenth century saw the new universities replace\nmonasteries as the centres of learning. The writings of Aristotle became very\npopular and the revived interest in mathematics was transferred to the study\nof scholastic physics. At this time, trade across the mediterranean increased\nand Italy became the gateway into Europe. Goods from Asia and north Africa\nentered its seaports, and the\n\n\n108 Chapter 3 banking houses made it a great financial centre. The great\nwealth this produced supported the advance of learning and the arts. The\npassion to rediscover the classics of antiquity led to the rapid growth of\nlibraries in the fifteenth century. These collections, much larger than the\nlibraries of the Middle Ages, had a strong bias towards classical works and\nincluded many Greek manuscripts. This was particularly true in the case of\nmathematics texts. Whereas medieval collections contained only Euclid and\nArchimedes in Latin translation, the humanists assembled an almost complete\ncorpus of mathematical writings including works by Apollonius, Heron, Proclus\nand Pappus in the Greek language. This endeavour was greatly assisted by the\ncollapse of the Byzantine empire. The fall of Constantinople to the Turks in\n1453 led to a flood of scholars fleeing to Italy bringing their treasured\nmanuscripts with them. The fifteenth century also witnessed many other changes\nin Europe. The secrets of making paper and gunpowder arrived from China.\nGunpowder radically altered the nature of warfare and fortifications had to be\nredesigned. The study of projectiles also became important. Paper replaced\nparchment and combined with the invention of printing with movable type to\nproduce a revolution in the spread of information. Although books by both\nancient and contemporary writers were printed daily in Venice, it was thirty\nyears before a mathematics text appeared. This was partly due to the\ndifficulty of printing diagrams but this problem was overcome by Erhard\nRadolt. In 1482, Campanus' version of the Elements became the first\nmathematics book off the press. The restoration of the Elements The first\ntranslation of the Elements from a Greek source was made by Bar- tolomeo\nZamberti (1473-C.1539) and printed in 1505. Zamberti sought to restore the\nElements to their original condition and heavily criticised Campanus for his\ninaccuracies. He realised that books XIV and XV were not part of the original\ncorpus and thought both had been written by Hypsicles. Zamberti's attack on\nCampanus and his poor grasp of mathematics prompted retaliation. Campanus'\nedition was defended by Luca Pacioli, who revised it and republished it in\n1509. Pacioli thought the source of the errors in Campanus' text did not rest\nwith the author but was to be found in the manuscripts he had available:\ncareless copyists introduced many mistakes, especially into diagrams. Even\nthough Zamberti worked from Greek sources and tried to produce a faithful\ntranslation, he failed to spot errors in the mathematics. The inadequacy of\nZamberti and other translators as mathematicians led to the realisation\namongst many scholars that good translations of mathematics texts were still\ndesperately needed. Ideally, these new translations should be made by\nmathematicians who knew Greek. It is part of the beauty of mathematics that\nthe\n\nA NEW WAY OF SEEING 109 restoration of mathematical texts is possible at all.\nTranslators in other fields perpetuated the errors in corrupted texts, often\nwithout recognising the faults. This was also the case in mathematics, where\nfew translators were expert in the field. But the logical development and\ninternal consistency of mathematics makes it clear when something is amiss.\nThese same features also allow the original meaning of a text to be recovered\neven if the original words aie lost. The desire to revive the study of\nmathematics and repair the ancient texts became an obsession for many Italian\nmathematicians. Francesco Maurolico (1494- 1575) was one such man. His father\nhad left Constantinople and settled in Sicily where he taught his son\nmathematics and astronomy. Maurolico's knowledge of Greek and mathematics\nmeant he had both the linguistic and technical skills to reconstruct the\nclassical texts. His translation of the Elements covered all fifteen books\nbut, sadly, his labour contributed little to the revival of mathematics.\nNearly all his work exists in manuscript form but only books XII to XV on\nsolid geometry were published after his death. The translator whose edition of\nthe Elements made the biggest impact was Federigo Commandino (1509-1575). He\nwas one of the leading translators and editors of Greek classics in the\nsixteenth century. His version of the Elements was printed in 1572 and it\ndominated geometry until the nineteenth century. A new way of seeing The new\nway of looking at the world which arrived with the rediscovery of ancient\nknowledge influenced art. As graven images are condemned in the Bible, the\ndecoration allowed in the early churches was strictly limited. Its purpose was\nto glorify God, and Biblical themes were very popular. Paintings were used to\neducate as well as decorate. Many of the Church's members were illiterate and\nthe pictures served as reminders of its teachings. They had to narrate a story\nsimply and clearly, concentrating on the essential elements. Generally, the\npaintings have a gold background indicating that something special is\nhappening. The scene is not natural, rather something supernatural or\nmiraculous. The characters which inhabit these paintings are stiff. They show\nno emotions and seem lifeless, even weightless—a quality which adds to their\nethereal appearance. The Greek mastery of motion and expression is completely\nabsent. Where there is variation in height it conveys the relative importance\nof objects or some social hierarchy: the saints are depicted larger than the\npeople. The infusion of classical learning into Europe during the twelth and\nthii teenth centuries, with its emphasis on man and the universe, stimulated\nartists and scholars to study their surroundings. Their new interest in nature\nand their attempts to record it revealed the lack of realism in their art.\nThey became aware of the lifelessness of their pictures. Gradually the solid\ngold backgrounds\n\n110 Chapter 3 were replaced by blue, and other features were introduced to\nsuggest a location, a room interior for example. Shading was used to give the\nimpression of volume. In their early attempts to convey solidity, painters\ndepicted objects as they were experienced rather than as they actually looked.\nA rectangular table would be shown as in Figure 3.3(a). The object is drawn as\nthough seen from many sides simultaneously instead of from a single fixed\nviewpoint. This produces a result in which there is a diminution in size\ntowards the observer. In contrast to the optical perspective which was to\ncome, this tendency is sometimes called inverted, or reversed, perspective,\nalthough there is no systematic reduction in scale as there is in the later\nmathematically-based system. Diagrams of this form continued to be used in\nmathematical and scientific treatises long after optical perspective was\nintroduced into art. A cylinder, for example, would be illustrated as shown in\nFigure 3.3(b) where its most notable characteristics, circular ends and\nparallel sides, are combined. (HP cm (a) (b) Figure 3.3. This portrayal of\nsubjective experience gave way to a more objective approach. The artist became\ndetached from the scene and observed from a single viewpoint rather than\nimagining himself involved in it. The compositions showed more purposeful\narrangements of objects and consistency in their spatial relationships; they\nwere no longer viewed as collections of separate objects, each dealt with\nindependently. By the fourteenth century, artists had achieved realistic\nrepresentations of space. Objects had mass and volume, and depth was\nconvincingly portrayed. There was an intuitive feeling of the geometrically\nprecise perspective to come. Lines that were above eye-level sloped downwards\nas they receded; those below eye-level sloped upwards. Lines to the left of\ncentre moved to the right as they went into the distance; those on the right\ninclined to the left. These general principles meant that lines which, in\nreality, were parallel to each other and skew to the picture plane, showed a\ntendency to converge, although not always to a single point. Despite what we\nwould regard as a high degree of inaccuracv in these constructions, a\nsatisfactory illusion of space can be obtained by following these\n\nPerspective 111 simple rules of convergence. Oblique views of buildings became\npopulai settings because the converging lines they contain produce a strong\nthree-dimensional effect. Giotto and Duccio often achieved a good impression\nof space in this way. They were among the first artists to display\nsubstantial-looking buildings with convincing structures. Over this period the\nidea that a painting should be like a window evolved. The observer looking at\na canvas should not see a flat image representing the world, but rather see\nthrough the canvas, as through an open window, to a scene beyond. Painters\naspired to produce a truly three-dimensional illusion, to portray space and\nnot merely suggest it. The ultimate illusion was performed in public on the\nsteps of Florence cathedral some time in the first quarter of the fifteenth\ncentury. In a now famous demonstration, Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-144G)\nexhibited a picture which not only looked realistic but which actually\nproduced the same image in the eye as did the real scene. He had painted a\npicture of the baptistry reflected in a mirror so that his painting was a\nmirror image of the actual building. He made a small eye-hole in the board and\ninvited people to look thiough the eye-hole from the back of the board at the\nreal baptistry. He then held a mirror in front of the painting so that the\nobserver saw a reflection of the painting. By removing and replacing the\nmirror the observer could compare the painting with the real scene. We do not\nknow what motivated Brunelleschi nor how he created his picture. However, the\nresults were so convincing that this event is now taken to mark the beginning\nof perspective theory in art. Perspective Up until the middle of the fifteenth\ncentury, the Latin word 'perspectiva' was not used in connection with artistic\nattempts to represent space. Earlier treatises on the subject dealt with\nnatural perspective, that is, optics and visual perception. None were\nconcerned with representing space on a flat surface. At some time, the notion\nthat viewing a painting should be like looking through an open window must\nhave been connected with the idea of a visual pyramid of light rays converging\non the eye: for the eye to receive the same impression from a painting as from\nthe original scene, the picture must be a cross-section of the visual pvramid.\nAs an architect, Brunelleschi would have been familiar with making giound\nplans and elevations of buildings. Given the desire to construct a 'realistic'\npicture, the information in such plans is sufficient to construct\ngeometrically the intersection of a picture plane and visual pyramid. One\nmerely needs to add the position of the observer and the picture plane to the\nplans (see Figure 3.4). Then the ground plan (the scene viewed from above) is\na horizontal section through the visual pyramid, and the elevation (the side\nview) is a vertical section through the pyramid. The picture plane is a\ntransverse section through the pyramid and\n\n112 Chapter 3 appears as a line on both plans. The lateral position of a point\nin the picture can be read off from the ground plan, and its height from the\nelevation. Combining these two pieces of information allows the image of the\npoint to be located precisely on the picture plane. The completed image is\ndependent on the position of the observer. As the distance from the observer\nto the building changes, the view of the building alters in response. The\ndistance of the picture plane from the observer does not affect the\nperspective construction—only the size of the image changes, not its\nproportions. It is this that is the essence of linear perspective. However,\nthe distance of the picture from the observer is vital when it comes to\nviewing the resulting painting. If the picture is to produce the same image in\nthe eye as the real scene then the eye has to be placed at the apex of the\nvisual pyramid. Thus, if a realistic effect is to be achieved, the ratio of\nthe width of the pictme to its distance from the observer must be the same for\nboth the construction and the final viewing. After constructing several of\nthese images some shortcuts become apparent. Any lines parallel to the picture\nplane are undistorted; parallel lines which are skew to the picture plane\nconverge and meet in a single point. Furthermore, all such vanishing points\nlie on a single line—the horizon. Whether or not Brunelleschi went through a\nprocess such as this when he discovered artificial perspective, this kind of\ntechnique was described in later manuals for artists. Early perspective\nartists For sometime after Brunelleschi's demonstration, the techniques of\nperspective painting were passed from one artist to another. The systematic\nrules are easily learned and applied to produce realistic looking structures.\nHowever, their use does not guarantee aesthetically pleasing or artistic\nresults. Perspective1 accuracy is only one factor influencing the overall\nimpression given by a painting. Achieving a unified and balanced composition\nis far more important than constructing a strictly mathematical diagram. Among\nthe first to use perspective constiactions were Brunelleschi's friends\nMasaccio, Masolino and Donatello. Masaccio quickly found that strict\nperspective can give harsh results and he made instinctive1 adjustments to the\nrigid formulae to produce more comfortable compositions. Other fifteenth-\ncentury artists also felt free to accept or ignore perspective as their\ncompositions required. It is the talent of great artists to know when and how\nto bieak the rules. The overpowering impression of depth which can result from\nstrict application of perspective can be opposed in a variety of ways. The\nsense of depth can be lessened by reversing the atmospheric\nperspective—applying bright colours for distant objects, dull colours for near\nones. Another technique is to choose the\n\nEarly perspective artists 113 rt x* O \"O W <+-. Figure 3.4. Using a plan-and-\nelevation diagram to construct a perspective view.\n\n114 Chapter 3 vanishing point so that it lies behind (and therefore within the\noutline of) an object in the painting, thus preventing the eye from being\ndrawn into the1 distance by the orthogonals. In fact, a strategic choice of\nvanishing point can be used to control the viewer's focus of attention. The\neye follows the converging oithogonals to their natural limit point. If the\npoint of convergence coincides with the main centre of activity, it emphasises\nits importance. Alternatively, if the vanishing point is placed some distance\nfrom the natural focus, it can highlight a detail that might otherwise be\noverlooked, or create a feeling of conflict and tension. We must remember not\nto regard the introduction of perspective' as meielv an improvement in\ntechnique. Masaccio loved to paint naturally falling diapeiv but earlier\nartists could have looked at drapery for themselves. It is not the aitists'\ntechnique which changed so much as their intention. The change in artistic\nstyle came about because they had a new way of seeing the world. Leon Battista\nAlberti The conversion of plans and elevations to perspective drawings is a\nlaborious process, and it is not particularly well suited to imaginary scenes.\nA simpler construction method was described by Leon Battista Alberti (1404\n1472) in his De Pictura written in 1435. This was the first treatise to\nexplain the theoiv and constructions of artificial perspective. Alberti's\naudience for this Latin volume comprised the patrons of the arts. A companion\nvolume in Italian Delia Pittura, which appeared the following year, addressed\nthe artists themselves. Tluough these works Alberti made the techniques of the\nnew art accessible to nianv other artists. Although he uses optical geometry\nin his treatises, Alberti expresses the ideas in terms that would be familiar\nto craftsmen, not in the abstract teims of mathematicians. 7 wish it to be\nborne in mind that I speak in these matters not as a mathematician but as a\npainter. Mathematicians measure the shapes and forms of things in the mind\nalone and divorced entirely from matter. We, on the other hand, who wish to\ntalk of things that, are visible, will express ourselves in cruder terms.b\nThis approach soon becomes apparent, as does the influence of Euclid. His\nfirst definitions paraphrase the beginning of the Elements. A mark is anything\nvisible to the eye; a -point is a mark which cannot be divided into parts; a\nhnc is a mark whose length can be divided but whose width cannot be split;\nmany lines close together like threads in cloth form a surface. In order to\npaint as though the picture were an open window, it is essential to be able to\njudge the position and scale of all the objects in the painting.\n\nPaolo Uccello 115 Alberti established the size and location of objects on a\ncanvas by marking out a tessellated pavement to act as a reference grid. The\npavement, which is sometimes called the ground plane, is regularly subdivided\nand diminishes coiiectlv as it recedes into the distance. It determines the\nposition and proportion of the other objects in the scene. The fundamental\naxiom of perspective is that the image of an object is reduced linearly—its\nproportions remain the same, only the scale1 changes. The pavement forms the\nheart of Alberti's method so it is fundamental to be able to construct it\ncorrectly. This is precisely the problem which earlier artists had failed to\nsolve adequately. One method in common usage was to make1 constant ratios\nbetween adjacent rows of tiles—take a third off the depth each time. Alberti's\ngeometrically-based method which replaced this became known as costruzione\nlegittima—the legitimate construction. Paolo Uccello The new perspective\ngeometry applied most naturally to objects composed of straight lines and\nplane surfaces. Although the principles of perspective1 are simple, applying\nthem can have problems. As a result the kinds of physical spaces and objects\nwhich artists dared to tackle were greatly simplified. Fifteenth-century\npictures contain many more right angles and straight lines than appear in\nnature or earlier paintings. Buildings still provided popular backdrops:\nexternal architecture and room interiors could be constructed easily and\naccurately. In some cases the grid described by Alberti as part of the\nconstruction process appears as a patterned floor or pavement in the finished\npainting. Besides buildings, another source of rectilinear objects was\nprovided bv solid geometry. Polyhedral objects and frameworks were frequently\nused as exorcises in perspective construction. Paolo Uccello (1397-1475) took\ngreat interest in geometry and perspective. He devoted much of his time to the\nstudy of perspective problems, constructing complex objects in great detail.\nIn his Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects the biographer Giorgio\nVasari (1511 1574) writes of Uccello When Paolo showed his intimate friend,\nDonatello the sculptor, mn/,- zocchi [polyhedral tori] with projecting points\nand bosses, represented in perspective from different points of view, spheres\nwith seventy-two facets like diamonds, and on each facet shavings twisted\nround sticks, with other oddities on which he wasted his time, the sculptor\nwould say, \"Ah, Paolo, this perspective of yours leads you to abandon the\ncertain for the uncertain; such things are only useful for marquetry, in which\nchips and oddments, both round and square, and other like things are\nnecessary. \"c\n\n116 Chapter 3 Vasari was of the opinion that Uccello spent too much time on\nhis perspective constructions and that his paintings would be improved if he\ndevoted himself to animals and figures in the same way. Notice also the\nreference to Campanus' sphere. Between 1426 and 1431 Uccello was in Venice. It\nis thought that he was involved in designing the patterns in the floor of the\nBasilica of San Marco. Some of the designs have a striking three-dimensional\nquality due to the careful juxtaposition of contrasting shades of marble. In\none of the doorwavs at the west end is a panel showing a polyhedron surrounded\nby a necklace of hexagonal prisms (see Plate 7). This design is often\nattributed to Uccello. Polyhedra in woodcrafts In the above quotation from\nVasari, Donatello mentions perspective in association with marquetry. Wood was\na popular medium in which the new art was expressed. The intarsia craftsmen\nexcelled in the study of perspective, so much so that they were often called\n'maestri di prospettiva'. Many inlaid pictures survive to show their virtuosic\nskill. The early panels depicted simple geometrical objects or views of\nbuildings in perspective. Some motifs became so popular they were a kind of\ntrademark. The relatively simple forms of polyhedra were a favourite theme.\nThe Platonic solids and some Archimedean solids were used, as was the 72-faced\nsphere described by Campanus. Another common object was the rnazzorcino—a kind\nof polyhedral torus. An example is included in Figure 3.5. The name is derived\nfrom a form of headwear. Other popular motifs were books, scientific\ninstruments such as armillary spheres, and musical instruments like the lute\nand the organ. Figure 3.6 shows a still-life design for a marquetry panel by a\nFlorentine craftsman, dating from about 1470. To make the construction moie\ndifficult, thus showing greater skill and technical proficiency with the new\ntechniques, hollow forms of the polyhedra were used so that the faces at the\nrear were made visible. These frameworks of edges are called skeletal\npolyhedra. Polyhedra inscribed in each other were also used. These\ncombinations of polyhedra were taken up by carvers of wood and ivory. They\nplaced polyhedra inside each other so that the smaller ones were imprisoned by\nthe larger ones but rotated freely. The best surviving examples of intarsia\nare in Verona and Urbino. Fia Giovanni da Verona created some magnificent\npanels in the choir-stalls and the sacristy in the church of Santa Maria in\nOrgano, in Verona. Two of the scenes in the sacristy contain perspective\npictures of polyhedra.2 One, containing Campanus' sphere, an icosahedron and\nits truncated form, is shown in Plate G. The 2If you want to see them, you\nwill need to ask to be shown the sacristy.\n\nPOLYHEDRA IN WOODCRAFTS 117 Courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni Culturali e\nAmbientali, Urbino Figure 3.5.

Other examples of these mazzocchi can be found in the choir-\nstalls of Modena cathedral. There are also examples of polyhedra in the royal\npalace at El-Eseoriel just outside Madrid.

The doors to the throne- room at the palace were a gift from his\nfather-in-law, Maximilian II. Thev were ornately carved and inlaid by German\ncraftsmen.

Piero della\nFrancesca The principles set down by Alberti which allowed artists to produce\nrealistic representations of space are not sufficient to enable complex\ndesigns such as polyhedra to be constructed. Although the methods for\nconstructing polyhedra accurately were not included in Della Pittura, it is\nclear that techniques for doing so were known, certainly in the second half of\nthe century if not before. They were first written down by Piero della\nFrancesca (c.1410-1492), and after this, peispec- tive constructions of\npolyhedra became a standard feature of painters\" manuals. Vasari wrote of him:\n\nPiero della Francesca 119 Piero was, as I have said, a diligent student of his\nart who assiduously- practised perspective, and had a thorough acquaintance\nwith Euclid, so that he understood better than anyone else all the curves in\nthe regular bodies and we owe to him the fullest light that has been thrown on\nthe subject.d In the early 1470's Piero gave up his career as an artist and\nconcentrated on his studies of the mathematical theory of perspective. His\nwork De Prospectiva Pingendi was written some time between 1482 and 1487 but\nthe ideas it contains were formed much earlier. He describes two methods of\nconverting plan views of objects to perspective views in a picture plane. One\nof these is similar to the method described above by which Brunelleschi might\nhave constructed perspective views of buildings. Piero's other method is an\nextension of Alberti's idea using a tessellated pavement of square tiles.\nAlberti and Piero probably met quite often at Urbino. Figure 3.7 is Piero's\ndiagram showing how to construct a regular pentagon lying in the ground plane.\nThe point labelled A is the central vanishing point, and BCED is a square\nprojected into the picture plane. Imagine that this square is not an image\ncomposed of lines in the picture plane but an actual tile existing behind the\npicture plane. If the edge BC is regarded as a hinge then this tile can be\nrotated so that it hangs down under the hinge. To foreshorten a figure, in\nthis case a regular pentagon, first draw it in this genuine square on the\npaper. The problem now is to transfer this figure to the image of the square.\nTo facilitate this, the diagonal BE is added to both the square BCED and its\nimage. To show how the image of a point in the figure may be located, the\ncorner labelled H will be used as an example. Transferring the lateral\ncoordinate is straightforward: construct a vertical line through H until it\nmeets BC, then join its end point on BC to the vanishing point A. The image of\nH must lie somewhere on this line. The diagonal BE is used to determine the\nprecise location. First construct a horizontal line through H and let iV be\nthe point where it crosses BE. The image of iV can be found easily since its\nlateral position can be determined in the same way as that for H, and its\nimage must lie on the image of the line BE. The image of the horizontal line\nNH is also horizontal. Thus the image of H lies at the intersection of the two\nlines which are known to pass through it. Proceeding in this way, all the\ncorner points of the pentagon can be transferred to the image plane. Piero\ngoes on to describe how to locate images of points which do not lie in the\nground plane. This method of constructing an object point by point may be\ntedious and time consuming but it is not difficult. Given sufficient patience\nany point can be constructed and complicated patterns can be properly\nforeshortened. Besides being an artist, Piero was also a competent\nmathematician of his time. His two mathematical treatises are Trattato d'Ab&co\nwritten about 1450,\n\n120 Chapter 3 * % i » \\ » Figure 3.7. Pieio's perspective construction of a\nregular pentagon.\n\nPlERO DELLA FRANCESCA 121 and Libellus de Quinque Corporibus Regularibus (Book\non the Five Regular Bodies) written about thirty years later. The latter work\nis dedicated to Duke Guidobaldo and is concerned with the mensuration of\nregular polygons and poly- hedra. Piero takes the fixed proportions between\nthe geometric solids and uses them as arithmetic problems. For example, given\na cube inscribed in a sphere of diameter seven units, find its surface area.\nAgain, if an octahedron is inscribed in a cube composed of squares of side 12\nunits how long is the side of the octahedron? Archimedean solids also feature\nin the exercises: given a polyhedron composed of four triangles and four\nhexagons (a truncated tetrahedron) inscribed in a sphere of diameter 12 units,\nfind its sides and surface area. Piero's Trattato d'Abaco is one of a long\nline of abaco texts, all ultimately derived from two works by Leonardo of Pisa\n(c. 1170-1250), also known as Fibonacci. Fibonacci was educated in north\nAfrica and travelled widely. He introduced Arabic numerals and methods of\ncalculation into Europe in his Liber Abbaci (1202) and translated some Greek\nand Arabic geometry and trigonometry into Latin in his Practica Geometriae\n(1220). He lists three of the five Platonic solids and refers interested\nreaders to Euclid for further information. Piero must have followed this\ndirection and gone to Campanus' version for he discussed all five solids, and\nsome parts of his Quinque Corporibus Regularibus come from book xv. Abaco\ntexts were primarily concerned with teaching the mathematics of commerce to\nfuture merchants. Some were of the recipe type giving rules and worked\nexamples; others included the theoretical basis for the rules. At this time\nthere were no standardised weights and measures, nor even containers of\nuniform size. Each city also had its own currency. Thus merchants needed to\nwork with proportions (for rates of exchange) and had to be able to find the\nvolume of barrels and other containers quickly and accurately. Graduated rules\nseem to have been used to gauge sizes in northern Europe but in Italy they\nused geometry. Solids were divided up into two categories: pyramidal and\ncolumnar. The volume of barrels could be found by treating them either as\nshort fat cylinders or as two truncated cones stuck end to end. These skills\nin decomposing complex forms into simpler ones were also used by artists. The\nobjects whose volumes are easily calculated are also simple to draw. This\nproduced an affinity between the artist and his audience for the viewers would\nbe able to analyse a painting into its underlying forms. They could see a tent\nas a cone on a cylinder, or a hat as a prism. Like Piero's book on painting,\nhis abaco is more advanced than similar works in its field. He does not\nrestrict his applications of geometry to everyday objects but studies abstract\npolygons and polyhedra. He even considers the regular solids and other\npolyhedra that can be inscribed in a sphere which is certainly far more than\nany merchant ever needed.\n\n122 Chapter 3 Luca Pacioli Luca Pacioli (1445-1517) grew up in Borgo San\nSepolcro in Tuscany, the town where Piero had his workshop. It is uncertain\nwhether Piero provided Pacioli's early education but the two were certainly\nfriends in later life. They often met at the Urbino court of Duke Federigo da\nMontefeltro. It is through Pacioli that Piero's work achieved wide\ncirculation. His manuscripts were kept in the Urbino library and were only\nprinted because Pacioli incorporated parts of them into his own works. The\nwell-known portrait of Pacioli shown in Plate 5, originally displayed at\nUrbino, now hangs in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples. Painted in 1495, it\nshows the master giving a geometry lesson. The organisation of the painting\nresembles that commonly used at the time for the title pages of mathematics\nbooks. The glass polyhedron floating in the upper left of the picture\nsymbolises the pure and eternal truths of mathematics in the Platonic realm of\nideas. The teacher sees this perfect archetype and tries to explain it to his\npupil with the aid of books, diagrams and models. The identity of the second\nfigure, who appears disinterested in the lesson, is unknown. One proposal is\nthat it is a portrait of Duke Guidobaldo; another that the artist included\nhimself. (Who painted the picture is another point of debate. It is usually\nattributed to Jacopo de' Barbari.) More recently, Nick MacKinnon has proposed\nthat the figure is Albrecht Diirer. Pacioli was ordained as a Franciscan in\nthe 1470's and is shown in his friar's robes. Other objects in the picture\ninclude geometrical instruments such as compasses, a model of a dodecahedron,\nand a slate with 'Euclides' inscribed on the frame. The pages of the book from\nwhich he has copied a diagram onto the slate contain the words LIBER XIII,\nwhich must refer to Euclid's account of the regular polyhedra in the last book\nof the Elements. Applying perspective geometry to the circle on the slate\nshould have produced an ellipse but the oval in the picture appears not to be\na conic section. The other book in the portrait has the letters LI. R. LUC.\nBUR. inscribed on its spine. This can be decoded as 'Liber Rev- erendi Lucae\nBurgensis' (Book by the Reverend Luca of Burgo) identifying the work as\nPacioli's encyclopaedia of mathematics Summa de Arithmetica, Geome- tria,\nProportioni et Proportionality which was printed in 1494 and dedicated to\nGuidobaldo. It is a compilation which draws on many sources including Piero's\nTrattato d'Abaco. This pattern was adopted for several other portraits of\nRenaissance mathematicians. The best-known work of Nicolas Neufchatel is a\nportrait of the Nuremberg mathematician and calligrapher Johann Neudorfer with\nhis son, painted in 1561 (Figure 3.8). Neudorfer is shown explaining the\ngeometry of the dodecahedron, a model of which he is holding, while his son\nattentively takes notes. The Platonic realm is represented by a skeletal cube\nfloating above them.\n\nLUCA PACIOLI 123 Hi o \\ 2 J y \\ior Is .vl ) MIJI Courtesy of the Bayerische\nStaatsgemaldesammlungen, Munich. Figure 3.8. Neufchatel. Johann Neudorfer and\nhis son (1561) painted by Nicolas In 1496 Pacioli was invited to the court of\nLudovico Sforza in Milan to teach mathematics. He stayed until 1499, when the\nDuke lost the city to Louis xil of France. Here he met Leonardo da Vinci\n(1452-1519). Amongst manv other things, Leonardo was interested in geometry,\nand in particular, the construction of regular polygons. He knew approximate\nconstructions used by engineers and craftsmen and tried devising constructions\nof his own, both exact and approximate. Pacioli may have given Leonardo\nlessons in Euclidean geometry. Leonardo certainly studied Euclid and would\nhave found the Latin text hard to follow. His notebooks show that he studied\nbooks I and II on regular poly-\n\n124 Chapter 3 gons, books v and VI on the theory of proportions, and book x\nalso on polygons. His notes are supplemented by summarised extracts from De\nProportionibus et Proportionalitatibus—the second of the two books of\nPacioli's Summa. It was at Milan that Pacioli completed work on his Divina\nProportione, a work probably in progress at the time of the portrait but which\nwas not published until 1509. Written in Italian, the work comprises three\nbooks. The first, Compendio de Divina Proportione, is dedicated to Ludovico\nSforza. It contains a summary of the properties of the divine proportion, or\ngolden ratio, and a study of polyhedra. The 'best of all' properties was that\nthe diagonals of a regular pentagon divide each other in the golden ratio. An\n'almost incomprehensible effect' concerned the icosahedron. The five triangles\nforming a solid angle1 of the icosahedron can be thought of as a pentagonal-\nbased pyramid. A rectangle can be inscribed in an icosahedron whose sides are\nalternately sides and diagonals of such pentagons. Thus the sides of the\nrectangle are in the golden ratio. Three such golden rectangles can be\nsimultaneously inscribed in an icosahedron so that they are mutually\nperpendicular (see Figure 2.17). The first book also contains studies of the\nregular solids and other polyhedra which can be derived from them. These\ninclude the glass polyhedron shown in the portrait, the rhomb-cub-octahedron.\nPacioli mentions that this solid and Campanus' 72-faced sphere are useful for\narchitectural purposes as they can be used to construct hemispherical\nstructures such as the dome of the pantheon. Pacioli uses two procedures to\ngenerate new polyhedra—truncation and augmentation. The truncation process is\nnot applied consistently. When pyramids are sliced from the corners of the\ntriangular-faced solids then the usual truncated tetrahedron, truncated\noctahedron and truncated icosahedron result. The truncated forms he gives of\nthe other two regular solids are what we now call the cub-octahedron and the\nicosi-dodecahedron. Augmentation is a kind of dual process in which pyramidal\npieces are stuck on to the faces of a polyhedron. Pacioli refers to augmented\npolyhedra as 'elevated'. Augmentation is applied to the five regular solids,\nthe cub-octahedron, the icosi-dodecahedron and the rhomb-cub- octahedron.\nIllustrations of all these polyhedra were drawn by Leonaulo. They are depicted\nin both skeletal (or vacuous as Pacioli puts it) and solid forms. Some\nexamples are shown in Figure 3.9. The augmented octahedron can be interpreted\nin several ways and will reappear many times in later chapters. Apart from\nbeing an octahedron with a pyramid stuck on each face, it can also be thought\nof as two interpenetrating tetrahedra. The second book of Divina Proportione\nis concerned with Vitruvian architecture. The third book Libellus in Tres\nPartiales Tractatus Divisus Quinquc Corporum Regularium is an Italian\ntranslation of Piero's Quinque Coiporibus Regularibus. The Montefeltro dukes\nwere patrons of both Piero and Pacioli. and Pacioli would have had access to\nthe original manuscript in the Urbino library.\n\nLuca Pacioli 125 Reproduced from the Companion Encyclopaedia of the History\nand Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences. Figure 3.9. Some of Leonardo's\ndrawings for Pacioli's Divina Pvopoitkmv.\n\n126 Chapter 3 Pacioli is often accused of plagiarism for his unacknowledged\nuse of Piero's work. However this may be, it is very doubtful whether Piero's\nideas would have reached such a wide audience had Pacioli not incorporated\nthem into his printed works. Albrecht Durer The new style of painting soon\nspread through Italy and beyond. The person who did most to introduce the\nknowledge of perspective to northern Europe was Albrecht Diirer (1471-1528).\nIn his early twenties, he travelled to Venice where he was exposed to Italian\nart—an influence which affected all his subsequent work. He became\nincreasingly interested in perspective. When in 1505, an outbreak of plague\nreached his home city of Nuremberg, many of its citizens took flight. Diirer\ntook the opportunity to make a second visit to Venice. In the autumn of the\nfollowing year he wrote in a letter that he would ride to Bologna as someone\nthere had agreed to teach him the 'secret of perspective'. It is not known who\nthis teacher was but he must have been well informed—familiar with both the\nMilan school and the work of Piero della Francesca. It could have been Donato\nBramante, or Scipione del Ferro, who taught mathematics. Another possibility\nis Pacioli though he was based in Florence at the time. The knowledge Diirer\nacquired in Bologna was theoretical. (It is unlikely that he would have\ntravelled so far just to learn the practical tricks of technique.) He gained\nan understanding of the geometry underlying the practice, how the mathematics\nof the visual pyramid and an intersecting picture plane allowed precise\nconstructions to be derived. Following his return to Nuremberg in 1507, Diirer\ndevoted much of his time to the study of perspective. Help in this direction\nmay have come from a handbook on the subject, De Artificial! Perspectiva by\nJohannes Viator, which was reprinted by a local publisher in 1509. Diirer\ncertainly knew Alberti's treatise on painting and was also familiar with some\nGreek geometry by authors such as Euclid, Archimedes and Apollonius. Motivated\nperhaps by the lack of books on the theory of art in languages northern\ncraftsmen could understand, he decided to write his own handbook. He had\nthought about the idea before his second visit to Italy but the project did\nnot get off the ground until his return. He planned to cover all aspects of\nart—practical, theoretical and ethical. Like Piero, Diirer devoted much of the\nlast years of his life to his theoretical studies. His project was an\nambitious one and he made comprehensive studies of classical texts. The manual\nof instruction for his fellow artists finally appeared in 1525: the work in\nfour books was called Unterweysung der Messung mit dem Zirkel un Richtscheyt\nin Linien Ebnen unnd Gantzen Corporen (Instruction in the Art of Measurement\nwith Compasses and Ruler of Lines, Planes and Solid Bodies). The first book\nbegins by discussing the basics of geometry (point, straight line) and\nprogresses to more complicated curves such as conchoids, epicycloids\n\nAlbrecht Durer 127 and helices. When dealing with the conic sections Durer\nfails to overcome the intuitive expectation that an oblique section of a cone\nmust be egg-shaped whereas his method of constructing an ellipse should have\ngiven the correct symmetrical form. Book II is concerned with regular polygons\nfor which Durer gives both theoretically exact and also approximate\nconstructions. This is the first time that approximate constructions had\nappeared in print though many of them had been known for a long time. He\nincludes a construction used by the craftsmen of his day that produces an\napproximate 9-gon, and he gives the Indian rule method of inscribing an\napproximate heptagon in a circle. Besides a theoretically correct construction\nof a pentagon taken from Ptolemy, he also includes two approximations, one of\nwhich is still one of the quickest methods known.3 Diirer goes on to show how\nregular polygons can be incorporated into ornaments, parquet Moors and\ntessellated pavements. Practical problems are also considered in book ill,\nwhich deals with problems in architecture and engineering. The fourth book\nreturns to the geometric theme and starts with solid geometry. The Platonic\nsolids and several of the Archimedean solids are discussed together with some\npolyhedra of Diirer's own invention. He introduces a technique of conveying\ninformation about three-dimensional objects on a flat surface via paper-\nfolding which in modern times is called a net. The method involves developing\nthe surface of a polyhedron onto a plane sheet of paper so that the resulting\nfigure can be cut out as a single connected piece then folded up to form a\nthree-dimensional model of the original polyhedron. His illustration for the\ndodecahedron is shown in Figure 3.10. The techniques for drawing in correct\nperspective are also included in this book. The notion that a painting can be\nthought of as the intersection of the picture plane with a visual pyramid with\nits apex fixed at the viewpoint is vividly illustrated by a series of\nwoodcuts. In one of these, a man maintains a single viewpoint by placing his\neye at the top of a small obelisk placed on the table and paints on a glass\nscreen the features of a man sitting on the other side. Although artists'\nmanuals showed how to apply perspective to simple shapes, drawing instruments\nof some kind were often used to render more complex designs. The painting-on-\nglass technique has some limitations. The distance between the eye and the\npicture plane can be at most an arm's length. This causes apparent distortion\nwhen an object has a large depth of field (such as a lute with a long\nfingerboard, for example). The parts near to the screen appear too large. This\ncan be cured by moving the object further away from the screen, in which case\nthe image is reduced in size, or by moving the viewpoint furthei back from the\nscreen. The second approach can be achieved by using a piece of rope to follow\nthe path of the light rays from the object to an artificial eye.

Diirer's net for a dodecahedron. de Keyser is\ncredited with inventing an instrument of this type. The second of Diirer's\nwoodcuts (reproduced in Figure 3.11) shows two men using such a device to\nproduce a perspective image of a lute—one of the set-piece motifs. The\ncomplexity of their task is clearly illustrated when we recall that the most\ncomplex of the regular solids, the dodecahedron, can be completely determined\nby constructing just twenty points. In contrast, Diirer's lute has over 150\npoints. Wenzel Jamnitzer Diirer's influence on the theory and practice of art\nwas enormous. This is particularly noticeable in German graphic art. Taking\ntheir lead from Pacioli and Durer, Nuremberg artists adopted polyhedra for\nperspective studies. A series of books were printed which contained\nperspective drawings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids and many elaborate\nvariations derived from them. Augustin Hirschvogel's Geometria (1543), Lorenz\nStoer's Perspectiva (1567), and Hans Lencker's Perspectiva (1571) are a few\nexamples.\n\nWenzel Jamnitzer 129 Figure 3.11. One of Diirer's woodcuts illustrating the\nprinciples of perspective. The outstanding work of this genre is Wenzel\nJamnitzer's (1508-1585) Per- spectiva Corporum Regularium (Perspective of\nregular bodies) published in 1568. I have used his plates for some of the\nfrontispieces of the chapters in this book. Jamnitzer and his brother were\naccomplished goldsmiths and jewellers. Sixteenth-century Nuremberg was\nrenowned as a centre for gold work and its goldsmiths worked closely with\nother local arists such as sculptors and printmakers who supplied them with\npatterns and models. In 1561 Jost Amman (1539-1591), one of the best graphic\nartists, arrived in the city. He was a printmaker and designer of jewelry and\ngoldwork, and collaborated with Jamnitzer on several occasions. He made an\nengraved portrait of his friend at work in his studio involved in a geometric\nconstruction (see Figure 3.12). It was Amman who turned Jamnitzer's\nperspective drawings of polyhedra into engravings suitable for publication.\nThe high quality of Amman's work and the sheer variety of Jamnitzer's designs\ncombined to make the Perspectiva Corporum Regularium a masterpiece. The title\npage of the work is shown in Figure 3.13. The frame includes the figures of\nArithmetic, Geometry, Architecture and Perspective, all depicted with their\nassociated symbols. Notice the visual pyramid which is Perspective's main\nattribute. These fields echo Diirer's belief\n\n130 Chapter 3 Figure 3.12. Engraving of Wenzel Jamnitzer in his study. that an\nartisan should understand geometry and proportion (arithmetic) so that his\nwork is natural and balanced. Jamnitzer was a great admirer of Diirer and\nowned a collection of all his prints in their first editions. The main part of\nthe book is arranged in six chapters, each with its own title page. The first\nfive show the influence of Plato's Timaeus and the correspondence of the\nregular solids with the four elements (fire, air, earth, water) and the\nheavens. The title page of the chapter on octahedra is shown on page 50. The\nformat of a central description of the solid surrounded by objects indicating\nits associated element is repeated for the other chapters. The symbols of fire\non the title page of the chapter on tetrahedral forms include candles,\nlanterns, dragons and canons. Earth, for chapter three, is symbolised by fruit\nand vegetables, rabbits, rams and farm tools. Crabs, shells, fish and sea\nserpents symbolise water; and stars, clouds, astronomical instruments and\nzodiacal figures cover the page for the chapter on dodecahedral forms. The\ndrawings comprising each chapter are of the Platonic solids, both solid and\nskeletal, and of other polyhedra derived from these fundamental forms by\naugmentation, truncation, cutting notches into the sides or faces, or some\ncombination of these, all done in a regular manner. These themes with\nvariations are arranged like ornaments on page after page.

Notice the true truncation of the cub-octahedron\n(Figure 2.23(a)) in the lower right of Figure 3.14. The final chapter is\nconcerned with mazzocchi, cones, spheres and what are best described as\npolyhedral monuments. (It is this chapter that has provided the\nfrontispieces.) Many of the monuments could never be erected as structures.\nSome balance precariously on a single vertex, others are connected only\nthrough vertices. Some have parts which are not supported at all but which\nfloat in space. A typical example is shown on page 288. Although in one sense\nJamnitzer's book represents the culmination of research begun by Piero and\nDiirer, its purpose is different from theirs. His geometrical fantasies are\npresented simply for what they are—completed designs. He does not explain how\nthey were constructed. We can, however, guess at his methods, for the pictures\nthemselves tell us something about his technique. The perspective is very\nshallow as though the objects are seen from a relatively distant viewpoint. It\nis probable that he used an artificial eye of the kind described by Diirer.\nIndeed, Amman's portrait of Jamnitzer shows him using something similar to the\nDiirer- Keyser device to sketch geometric bodies. As a manufacturer of all\nkinds of scientific instruments he could easily have made such an instrument\nspecially for the purpose. Even so, it is unlikely that he made models of all\nhis varied designs. His perspective machine, along with a few models, would\nprovide the frameworks for his drawings. The rest is pure imagination.\nPerspective and astronomy The Platonic themes which so appealed to Pacioli and\nJamnitzer were also taken up by Daniele Barbaro (1514-1570). He wrote two\ntreatises on perspective with almost identical titles. One work La Practica\ndella Prospettiva, which deals with the geometry of regular and semiregular\npolyhedra, exists only as a manuscript. The other, La Practica della\nPerspettiva printed in 1559, covers various aspects of perspective. Barbaro\nwas taught perspective geometry by Giovanni Zamberti, brother of Bartolomeo,\nbut he also draws on the work of Piero and Diirer. Following their lead, he\ngives the two standard methods of construction (plan/elevation and Alberti's\npavement) and then progresses to the study of polyhedra, a topic he covers in\nmore detail than earlier treatises. He deals with the construction of regular\nand semiregular solids, mazzocchio, and some variations. He also includes nets\nand explains the rules for shading and the construction of shadows. Besides\nthe projection of shadows, Barbaro also explains the optical geometry of\nsundials and techniques for mapping the celestial sphere. By this time it was\napparent that perspective geometry was closely connected with the stenographic\nprojection used in astronomy. In fact, the two ideas are equivalent. This was\nmade\n\nPerspective and astronomy 133 Figure 3.14. Page from Jamnitzer's Perspectiva\nCorporum Regul, showing polyhedra derived from a cube. arium\n\n134 Chapter 3 Figure 3.15.

This text attracted attention not\nonly as a treatise bv the author of the Almagest but also as a source of the\nmathematics underlying the construction of astrolabes. This involves\nprojecting the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn and the circle of the ecliptic\nonto the equatorial plane using the celestial South pole as the centre of\nprojection. These three things, the fixed eye (South pole), the picture plane,\nand the projected object, are the three basic elements of perspective. The\ntechnique of orthographic (or parallel) projection provides the basis for the\ngeometry of sundials and shadows. Commandino treated this aspect in a\ncompanion volume—a commentary on Ptolemy's Analemma. It is uncertain how soon\nthe connection between perspective and astionomy was made. It has been\nsuggested that it may even have played a pait in the initial process of\ndiscovery. Brunelleschi's training as a goldsmith would have included the\npractical mathematics used by craftsmen and found in the abaco texts. As a\nmaker of scientific instruments, he would also need to know the projective\ngeometry needed to construct an astrolabe. Unfortunately, there are many\nthreads linking perspective to other areas of science and we shall probably\nnever know which ones Brunelleschi drew together to make his revolutionary\ndiscovery. Polyhedra revived The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were a time\nof renewal in Europe. The humanists collected, translated and commented on the\nprincipal texts of antiquity and scholarship began to be revived. Mastery of\nthe new ideas was essential before new steps could be taken. But this was not\na simple process of assimilation or replacing obviously false notions with\ncorrect ones. The new philosophies and ideas had to be grappled with;\ninconsistencies in the many different sources had to be removed. Amid this\nuncertainty there was one body of knowledge which seemed to offer a secure\nfoothold—the axiomatic truths of mathematics. The publishing of mathematics\ntexts played an important role in spreading new science. This is particularly\ntrue in solid geometry. Increased trade had led to great interest in\nstereometry—the determination of volumes of containeis. The rediscovery of\nPlato in the fifteenth century introduced the Pvt hagorean creed 'Number is\nthe basis of all things' and the idea that nature could be understood through\nmathematics. The Neoplatonist writings of Plotinus were translated into Latin\nin 1492. Pla- tonism came into vogue as the Renaissance thinkers sought to\nthrow off medieval scholasticism: it became a major force in the fight against\nAristotle. The Platonic tradition, though never entirely lost in the West, now\nacquired many new adherents with its attractive fusion of rational explanation\nwith theology tlnough the\n\nPOLYHEDRA REVIVED 137 mathematical design of the Creator. Contemplating the\nuniverse and uncovering the divine plan held great appeal for the Renaissance\nphilosophers. One of the most prolific thinkers to explore this idea is the\nsubject of the next chapter.\n\n■<*- \\ ^ L' Iv & 'o J V > I X. < « ,, ^, ■vy**-.-.,--^./'^ j* :3^ /' 0> V.\n■■»»!';;V:'Jt:l!tj:i»r '■i ''' Co //A r\\\\- Johannes Kepler. Courtesy of the\nDeutsches Museum, Munich.\n\n139 Fantasy, Harmony and Uniformity Kepler's most notable contributions to\npure mathematics were in the geometry of regular polygons and polyhedral H. S.\nM. Coxeter Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) lived in an age of transition, in a\nturbulent Europe with its upheavals of religious and political structures, at\nthe frontier of the medieval and modern eras. His theology, belief in God the\nCreator, coupled with his Pythagorean-like mysticism led him to search for the\nmathematical order underlying the phenomena of nature, the Eternal Geometry\nbehind its design. Unlike earlier philosophers, Kepler also demanded that his\ntheories matched the facts. Although he is remembered chiefly for his\nastronomical works, Kepler was a prolific author and wrote on many diverse\nsubjects from crystals to optics. His interest in polyhedra spans his whole\ncareer. They occur in his first published treatise, Mysterium Cosmographicum,\nand also in one of his last major works, Harmonices Mundi Libri V. Both works\nexhibit his desire to expose the mathematical design of the universe, to find\nthe harmonious and unifying scheme which the great Architect used in its\ncreation. A biographical sketch Kepler was born in Weil, a small town near\nStuttgart. After completing his schooling he won a scholarship to study at the\nuniversity in Tubingen. The Dukes of Wurttemberg, having been converted to the\nProtestant religion, founded 4\n\n140 Chapter 4 the universities at Tubingen and Wittenberg to train leaders for\nthe Reformed Church, and Kepler's education was to prepare him for the\nLutheran ministry. Kepler was taught geometry and astronomy by Michael\nMastlin. an astronomer with whom he maintained contact after leaving\nTiibingen. Although Mastlin and Kepler discussed the new Copernican philosophy\nin private, in his lessons Mastlin taught only the traditional astronomy.\nKepler graduated from the facultv of arts to the faculty of theology, but\nnever completed his training. A Protestant school in Graz had asked the\nuniversity to recommend a candidate to fill a vacant teaching position. The\nuniversity suggested Kepler and, in 1594, he withdrew from his studies and\nmoved to the Austrian province of Styria to teach astionomv and mathematics\nWhile at Graz, Kepler read the Neoplatonic writing of Proclus, whose\ncommentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements had been published in a\nGreek edition some sixty years earlier. He also studied Commandino's Latin\ntranslations of works by Archimedes, Apollonius and Pappus. It appears that\nlie also had access to Franciscus Flussatus Candalla's Latin version of the\nElements. This edition purported to be a translation from Greek sources but it\nseems to be based as much on Campanus' and Zamberti's editions as on any\noriginal manuscript. Candalla appended his own work to the canon: propositions\nshowing how the regular polyhedra could be inscribed in one another. This may\nhave stimulated Kepler's interest in polyhedra—an interest he was to retain\nfor the rest of his life. It was also at Graz that Kepler produced his first\ntreatise. It contained his answer to the mystery of the universe. His model of\nthe planetary orbits was an attempt to explain the proportions of the known\nuniverse and he believed that the regular polyhedra played a key role in\nshaping its design. Now that his future career was not to be in the church, he\nfelt his calling was to reveal God's perfect design in nature, to fathom the\nmind of the Creator himself. He sent copies of his Mysterium Cosmographicnm to\nmany of the leading scholars in Europe including Galileo and the Danish\nastronomei Tvcho Brahe. Tycho thought the work original and imaginative and\nrecognised Keplei's mathematical ability. When the Protestants were expelled\nfrom Graz, Kepler tiavclled to Prague and became his assistant leaving Graz on\nNew Year's day, 1600. Their collaboration lasted only 18 months and ended with\nTycho's death. Keplei succeeded him as Imperial Mathematician to Rudolph n.\nThis gave him access to the large collection of astronomical observations\nTycho had mack1 during his life. Kepler continued to work on the problem he\nhad been set by his late master--an analysis of the motion of Mars. Mars has\nthe most eccentric of the planetary orbits and thus caused the most problems\nto the circular motion theories. Eventually these studies led him to the\ndiscovery of his first two laws that planets follow elliptical orbits, and\nthat a line from the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time\n—thus demolishing the paradigm of circular motion at\n\nA BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 141 constant speed. He presented these two laws in his\nAstronomia Nova published in 1609. The political situation deteriorated a few\nyears later and, after the empeior's death, Kepler moved to Austria taking a\nposition as Mathematician at Linz. Here he wrote two major treatises: Epitome\nAstronomiac Copcrnicanao (1018 1022) and Harmonicas Mundi (1019). The first of\nthese, despite its title, is not on Copernican astronomy but is a textbook\npresenting Kepler's own astionomical laws. The second work is almost a sequel\nto the Mystcrium Cosmograpliicum and, indeed, its conception can be traced\nback to 1599, just three yeais latei. In it Kepler attempts a grand\nunification of geometry, music, astrology and astion- omy; he wants to expose\nthe hidden harmonies of the universe. He aims to derive the phenomena included\nin his survey from the 'one and eternal Geonietiy\". The first two of its five\nbooks are concerned with the mathematics of icgulai polygons and their\ncombinations. The second book contains nearly all Kepler's writing on\npolyhedra, including his explanation of why each of the Platonic solids is\nassociated with a particular element (see Chapter 2). However, Haimoniccs\nMundi is not a treatise on pure1 mathematics and Kepler is not investigating\nthe pioperties of geometrical bodies for their own sake. He is concerned with\nestablishing a hierarchy of polygons according to their 'sociability' —a\nmeasure of theii capacity to combine with other polygons to form tessellations\nand polyhedra. In a later book of Harmonicas Mundi this ranking of polygons is\nused to explain astiological phenomena. When discussing music he uses the\ngeometry of polygons to explain why certain ratios of frequencies are\ndiscordant. The Pythagoreans had discovered that strings whose lengths are in\nsimple numerical ratios form pleasant chords. Thus the octave is 1:2, and the\nfifth is 2:3. But why are ratios such as 1-7 oi 3:7 discordant? Keplei argues\nthat the answer lies in geometry, not arithmetic, and is connected with the\nconstructibility of regular polygons. A heptagon is not constructible with\nrulei and compasses, so it is not truly known and, theiefore, cannot have been\nused in a harmonious design of the universe. Kepler also found harmonic ratios\nbetween the angular velocities of the planets. In amongst all this, the work\ncontains Kepler's third law of planetary motion relating the distance of a\nplanet from the sun to its period, the time taken foi a complete oibit. His\nefforts were then directed towards completing the task with which he had been\ncharged many years earlier by Rudolph II -the compilation of new astronomical\ntables to replace the outdated Alphonsine tables. The gieat work was concluded\nin 1020. Kepler travelled to Germany to supervise theii printing and at the\nbeginning of 1028 he handed a copy of the Tabulae Rudol]>hiunc to the emperor\nFerdinand II. Kepler lived for another three years. It is fortuitous that wo\nstill have his original papers for, after his death, his manuscripts suffered\nseveral misadventures\n\n142 Chapter 4 before finding a safe resting place. They were rescued from a\nfire, onlv to be pawned and then lost. After their surprise rediscovery nearly\n150 years Inter their new owner offered them for sale. Several universities\nand scientific societies were approached but none showed any interest.\nEventually scholars at the Russian Academy of Science in Saint Petersburg (one\nof whom was Leonhaid Euler a mathematician who also figures prominently in the\nhistory of polyhedia, as we will see in Chapter 5) convinced the empress\nCatherine II of the value of the manuscripts and she agreed to buy them. They\nare now preserved in the Academy's library. A mystery unravelled Seldom in\nhistory has so wiong a book been so seminal in diiecting the future course of\nscience '' 0 GiiiRciich A precursor to Cosmographical Treatises, containing\nthe Cosmic Mystery of the admirable proportions between the heavenly Orbits\nand the true and proper reasons for their Numbers, Magnitudes and Periodic\nMotions demonstrated by the five regular geometric solids. So reads the full\ntitle of Kepler's treatise Mysterium Cosmographicnm - a work in which he\nattempts to recreate the Architect's design for the universe. Kepler records\nthat he began to wonder why the cosmos was as it was. Why aie there six\nplanets? Why are their distances and speeds what they are? The originality of\nsuch questions is easily overlooked. Prior to this, astronomers had merely\nobserved the sky and recorded what they saw. Kepler sought not merely\ndescriptions but causal explanations. At first he tried to find numerical\nrelationships between the sizes of the orbits but without success. He devised\nvarious schemes hoping to force sensible latios to appear, even resorting to\nthe addition of several planets, but these also failed. Inspiration came while\nhe was giving a lesson. He was explaining how the conjunctions of Saturn and\nJupiter progress through the houses of the zodiac. He marked on a circle the\npoints where such conjunctions occur and connected them in sequence. This\nresulted in a diagram like the one in Figure 4.1. Each line spans a gap of\neight signs so three lines almost form a triangle. The conjunctions progress\nround the zodiac precisely because the 'triangle' does not close up. When many\nof these lines have been drawn in they outline a smaller circle. Studying this\nfigure, it suddenly struck him that he could use geometrical relationships\nrather than numerical ones, for the circumscribed circle and the inscribed\ncircle of an equilateral triangle were in the same ratio to each other as the\noibits of\n\nA MYSTERY UNRAVELLED 143 Reproduced from the Dictionary of Scientific\nBiography with permission of the American Council of Learned Societies. Figure\n4.1. The progression of the conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter through the\nzodiac. Saturn and Jupiter. These were the outermost planets, and the triangle\nis the first figure. Almost instantaneously he reasoned that the next\ninterval, that between Jupiter and Mars, must correspond to the next figure,\nthe square and so on. But again he met with failure. He was now thinking in\ngeometrical terms. It dawned on him that instead of fitting two-dimensional\nfigures to the oibits in space, it was more natural to use three-dimensional\nforms. And there was the answer. For although there are an unlimited number of\nregular polygons, there are only five regular polyhedra. Thus there can be\nonly five intervals between the planets and hence only six planets. He writes:\n\n144 Chapter 4 We must first eliminate the irregular solids because we are only\nconcerned with orderly creation. There remain six bodies, the sphere and the\nfive regular polyhedra. To the sphere corresponds the outer heaven. On the\nother hand, the dynamic world is represented by the Hat-faced solids. Of these\nthere are five. When viewed as boundaries, however, these five boundaries\ndetermine six distinct things—hence the six planets that revolve about the\nsun.c Besides answering his question of why there were six planets, his\ndiscovery could also explain their spacing. Into the sphere which carried\nSaturn he inscribed a cube, and into the cube another sphere which carried\nJupiter. Between the spheres of Jupiter and Mars he placed the tetrahedron;\nbetween Mars and Earth, the dodecahedron; between Earth and Venus, the\nicosahedron; and between Venus and Mercury, the octahedron. The fact that in\nclassical times these particular polyhedra had been called the Cosmic Figures\ngave some credibility to their incorporation into the design of the universe.\nThe well-known plate that illustrated Kepler's book is reproduced in Figure\n4.2. The polyhedra are displayed in skeletal form, similar to those drawn by\nLeonardo for Luca Pacioli's book Divina Proportione. The plate appears to\ndepict an actual solid model but this cannot be the case since the pieces do\nnot support each other. Kepler proceeds to explain why the solids should be\nplaced in just the positions they occur by considering various affinities\nbetween the planets and the polyhedra. Each planet is associated with the\nadjacent polyhedron nearest Earth. Thus Saturn is linked with the cube;\nJupiter with the tetrahedron; Mars, the dodecahedron; Venus, the icosahedron;\nand Mercury, the octahedron. The astrological attributes of each planet are\nthen shown to match the characteristics of its associated solid. For example,\nthe Saturnian love of solitude is connected with the uniqueness among angles\nof the right angle—the type of angle in the cube. By contrast, Jupiter has\nchosen from the many acute angles. As astrology is geocentric, the Earth has\nno astrological attributes. Its position among the polyhedra is explained as\nfollows. The polyhedra fall naturally into two classes: those whose nature is\nto float (the octahedron and the icosahedron) and those whose nature is to\nstand upright. For if the former are made to rest on a face, or the latter on\na corner then 'the eye shies from the ugliness of such a sight'. Falling back\non the medieval homocentric view of the universe, Kepler argues that the most\nappropriate place for the Earth, home of Man created in God's image, is so as\nto separate one sort from the other. By arguments of this kind Kepler\njustifies everything he believes about his model. After all this fantasising\nand speculation there is an abrupt change in his presentation. He announces\nthat the model must be checked against empirical data. He knew that the\nplanetary orbits are not circular but oval shaped. The spheres which carried\nthe planets had to be thought of as shells of sufficient thickness\n\nA MYSTERY UNRAVELLED 145 Figure 4.2. A plate from Kepler's Mysterium\nCosmographicum illustrating his model of the universe. to contain the oval\norbits, with the innermost wall marking the planet's minimum distance from the\nsun (perihelion) and the outer shell its greatest distance (aphelion). These\nshells are marked in Figure 4.3, which illustrated Harmonicas Mundi. In some\nplaces the model agreed quite well, in others there were significant\ndiscrepancies. The problem with Jupiter was attributed to its great distance.\nThe shell for Mercury was too small so instead of the inscribed sphere, he\nused the midsphere of the octahedron, that is, the sphere that touches the\nmidpoints of all the edges. This is shown in the illustration of the four\ninnermost planets (Figure 4.4). The Copernican data he was using gave the\ndistances of the planets as mea-\n\n146 SfrCr^N* .rlcj I Xtedi emus <^x VVS'* ^Aii Figure 4.3.\n\nA MYSTERY UNRAVELLED 147 Figure 4.4. sured from the mean sun—the centre of the\nEarth's orbit. This was a mathematically convenient origin for Copernicus to\nchoose as it simplified his calculations. Kepler, hoping to improve the fit of\nhis model, engaged Mastlin's help to recalculate the distances as measured\nfrom the actual sun. Even though this change in the data did not result in any\nsignificant improvement, Kepler continued to use his version of the data. His\ninterest was in the actual universe and its properties, and he wanted\nphysically meaningful data. When trying to decide whether or not the Earth's\nshell should include the moon's orbit, he admits that he will choose whichever\nsolution gives the best fit. Convinced that his model has to be right, he\nexplains away as many discrepancies as he can, and blames those that remain on\nCopernicus' faulty data. In his book The Sleepwalkers, Arthur Koestler likens\nit all to a game of 'Wonderland croquet through mobile celestial hoops'.\nKepler took the draft of his book back to Wurttemberg for publication. In his\nenthusiasm he persuaded Friedrich, Duke of Wurttemberg, to have a model of the\nuniverse made in silver showing the positions of each of the five regular\npolyhcdra and with the planetary symbols inset in precious stones. It was to\nbe made in parts by different silversmiths so that the Duke would be the first\nto see the assembled model. In order to satisfy himself that the project was\nworthwhile, the Duke asked to see a copper version. Kepler, not having\nsufficient money, made a model of coloured paper instead. The Duke asked\nMastlin's opinion of the completed model; he commended it, whereupon the Duke\nconsented to the work being done. The project was never completed. It appears\nthat the silversmiths\n\n148 Chapter 4 had difficulty understanding the design, but the Duke was\nunwilling to abandon the project and it dragged on for several years before\nlapsing. The structure of the universe Kepler's polyhedral model of the\nuniverse was motivated by the desire to expose its mathematical design, to\nreveal the plan which its Creator had used in its construction. He followed in\nthe Pythagorean tradition and believed that such a plan would be expressible\nin harmonious geometrical relationships reflecting the decisions of the\nArchitect. His model attempted to explain the structuie of the universe and to\nprovide a unified account of some of its properties. This was the first time\nsuch a system had been proposed. He did not believe that the polyhedra and\ncrystal spheres actually existed in space; he thought of them more as an\ninvisible skeleton, as part of the perfect design by which each planet was\nallotted its own region of space. The illusory and fallacious nature of the\nplanetary model was shown up by the discovery of new planets after Kepler's\ndeath. Uranus was found in 1781, Neptune in 1846 and Pluto in 1930.\nAstronomers are currently seaiching for a tenth planet, the so-called planet\nx, whose existence has been postulated to account for certain discrepancies\nbetween the predicted and observed paths of the known planets. Similar\ngravitational anomalies led to the discovery of Neptune. Had the planets been\ndiscovered in Kepler's lifetime, he could possiblv have accommodated them in a\nrevised version of his model. For, although thcic are only five Platonic\nsolids, under a wider definition of regularity there aie f'oui other regular\npolyhedra. Kepler discovered two of these polyhedra and tinkeied with his\nmodel to see whether it could incorporate one of them. Kepler's planetary\nmodel has been compared to the modern theoiv of paiticle physics which seeks\nto explain the number and properties of elementaly particles. Just as Kepler\nadmired the regularity of the Platonic solids and was attracted by the idea\nthat nature must be constructed around such elegant foims, so the modern\nphysicist idolises symmetry. Kepler intuitively recognised the high degree of\ngeometric symmetry exhibited by the regular polyhedra; the physicist searches\nfor more abstract symmetries in nature. Current models of particle phvsics are\nbased on what is known as unitary symmetry, a notion closely related to\nrotational symmetry. Unitary symmetry theory suggests that the elementary\nparticles can be ai- ranged in families according to their properties and that\nthev display definite patterns. The first classification scheme proposed in\nthe 19G()'s was based on representations of the special unitary group SU(3).\nIt incorporated all the then known particles and successfully predicted the\nproperties of new particles which were later discovered. Rather surprisingly,\nKepler also managed to make a sue-\n\nFitting things together 149 cessful prediction based on his model of the\nuniverse. When he heard that Galileo had discovered four new planets with the\nnewly invented telescope, he lefused to accept that they could be planets\norbiting the sun as he had proved that there could be only six such planets.\nThus he deduced that these four astronomical bodies must be satellites of the\nknown planets, like the Earth's moon Clalileo's four planets are, in fact, all\nmoons of Jupiter. The patterns shown by the SU(3) model led to the proposal\nthat protons and neutrons are not fundamental particles but are composed of\nsmallei entities. These constituents have come to be called quarks. The\noriginal quark model associated with SU(3) required three quarks which were\nlabelled 'up', 'down' and 'strange'. These quarks combine in triplets\nproducing baryons such as the pioton and neutron, and as quark antiquark pairs\nproducing mesons such as the pion and the kaon. In the mid-1970's a new kind\nof particle was discovered which did not fit the current model. A fouith quark\nlabelled 'charm' was postulated to solve the problem, and the unitary symmetry\ntheory now considered representations of the group SU(4). Unlike Kepler's\npolyhedral hypothesis, which was demolished with the discovers of the outei\nplanets, the discovery of new particles does not cause such a devastating\nproblem to particle physicists. Although the numbei of logulai polyhedra is\nlimited to five, there are many groups of symmetries to choose fiom. Fitting\nthings together Kepler's writing on the mathematics of polyhedra is mostly\ncontained in the second book of his Hannouices Mundi. The first two of the\nfive books are concerned with polygons and the different ways in which they\nform 'congruences'. In book I Kepler defines a polygon to be regular if it is\nequilateral and has equal angles. He then defines a half-regular1 polygon to\nbe one which is equilateral, and lestiicts attention to those having four\nsides. Thus Kepler's half-regular polygons are, in fact, rhombi. In the second\nbook he investigates the ways in which regular and half-iegular polygons can\nbe fitted together around a point. This leads to the construction of\ntessellations of the plane, and of polyhedra. Kepler uses the word nmqru- ence\nmeaning 'fitting together' to describe both situations—a tessellation being a\ncongruence in the plane, and a polyhedron being a congruence in space. Here\nKepler is concerned with harmony in its broad sense for the word 'haimonv' is\nderived from the Greek for 'fitting together'. He remarks that stacking poly-\n'This would noiinally be tianslated 'scmiregular'. I have used 'half-regular\ninstead be< ause, further on, Kepler defines half-iegulai polyhedra as those\ncomposed of half-iegulai figuies. Retaining the conventional translation rould\nbe a source of confusion since, in anient teiminology. 'semiregular polyhedra'\nrefeis to the Archimedean and Catalan solids.\n\n150 Chapter 4 hedra together to fill space is another form of congruence. He\nconsideicd such space-filling polyhedra in De Nive Sexangula. He defines a\npolyhedron as follows: There is a congruence in space, and a solid figure,\nwhen the individual angles of several plane figures make up a solid angle, and\nregnlm 01 hall-regular figures are fitted together so as to leave no gap\nbetween the sides of the figures, which join up on the opposite side of the\nsolid figure, or, if a gap is left, it is such that it can be tilled by a\ntigmv of one of the kinds already employed, or, at least, by a regular\ntigmv.'1 To Kepler, then, a polyhedion was a three-dimensional figure composed\nof lcgulai polygons or rhombi fitted together edge-to-edge. He describes\npolyhedia that do not close up completely as semisolid. He continues his list\nof definitions and describes, in turn, the kinds of polyhedra that he is\ninterested in. His classification is summarised by the diagiam in Figure 4.5.\nPerfect (similar vertices) Most Perfect Perfect to a Lower Degiee (congruent\nfaces) (regular faces of several kinds) Regular Half-regular Archimedean Impel\nfeet (Platonic) (Rhombic) (Piismatic) Figure 4.5. Kepler's classification of\npolyhodra. Having defined a perfect congruence as one in which all the vei\nrices aie similarly surrounded, he subdivides this class into those that are\nmost perfect and those that are perfect to a lower degree. The former category\ncomprises the polyhedra whose faces are all the same shape. These are further\nsubdivided into regular and half-regular according to whether their faces are\nregulai or half-iegular polygons. In fact, the rhombic polyhedra are not a\nsubclass of the peifect polv- hedra at all because not all the vertices are\nsurrounded by the same number of polygons. Kepler knows this but remarks:\nThere is no reason why we should not call this congruence most perfect, for\nits imperfection is in the faces and is not a consequence of its being solid\nbut, rather, an accidental feature.''\n\nRhombic polyhedra 151 The polyhedra that Kepler calls perfect to a lower\ndegree have regular faces of several kinds. We know them as the Archimedean\npolyhedra and the families of prisms and antiprisms. Kepler notes that among\nthe prismatic figures, the triangular antiprism and the square-based prism\nbelong to the most perfect polyhedra (the former being the regular octahedron,\nthe latter the cube). All the other prismatic solids are classified as\nimperfect being either more like plane figures, in the case of prisms, or more\nlike parts of figures than whole ones. Kepler's diagram showing an exploded\nview of an icosahedron shows clearly what he had in mind (Figure 4.6). The\ncentral section is a pentagonal antiprism. Figure 4.6. Kepler's sketch of an\nexploded icosahedron shows it decomposed into an antiprism and two pyramids.\nFollowing his definitions, Kepler describes examples of the various kinds of\npolyhedra. He tries to find all the possibilities and then often continues to\nprove that there are no more. The first family that he enumerates are the\nregular polyhedra. He notes that this classification forms the last\nproposition in Euclid's Elements and his proof follows the Euclidean one: he\ntries fitting combinations of polygons around a point and eliminates all the\narrangements whose angle sum is greater than 360°. The five remaining\npossibilities can be realised by the Platonic solids. Kepler uses this method\nof proof consistently in his study of polyhedra. He considers all possible\nways that a vertex could be surrounded and excludes those that are impossible,\neither because the angle sum is too large or because the required pattern\ncannot be continued. This proof by exhaustion of possibilities is long-winded\nbut effective. It has elegance in its uniformity of style rather than in any\nconcise ingenious arguments. Rhombic polyhedra Kepler knew two examples of his\nhalf-regular polyhedra. They are shown in Figure 4.7. The first is bounded by\ntwelve rhombi whose diagonals are in the ratio of 1:^/2. The second rhombic\npolyhedron is bounded by thirty rhombi whose\n\n152 Chapter 4 Figure 4.7. Kepler's two rhombic polyhedra. diagonals are in the\ngolden ratio. They are called the rhombic dodecahedron and the rhombic\ntriacontahedron, respectively. In an earlier work, Kepler provides a hint as\nto how he discovered those two polyhedra. The De Nive Sexangula, a work\nwritten in 1611 as a Now Year's gift for a counsellor at Rudolph's court in\nPrague, is nominally concerned with the question of why snowflakes have six\ncorners but it makes frequent diversions and touches on many other topics. In\none of these asides Kepler considers another example of hexagonal forms\noccurring in nature, namely a honeycomb. Ho notes that a bee's cell is\nterminated at the base by three equal rhombi. He continues: These rhombi put\nit into my head to embark on a problem of geometry: whether any body, similar\nto the five regular solids and to the fourteen Archimedean solids could be\nconstructed with nothing but rhombi. I found two, one with affinities to the\ncube and octahedron, the other to the dodecahedron and icosahedron—the cube\ncan itself serve to present a third, owing to its affinity with two tetrahedra\ncoupled together. The first is bounded by twelve rhombi, the second by thirty\nf The clue is in the reasons given for including the cube as a third\npossibility. Two equal tetrahedra can be placed so that the edges of one meet\nthe edges of the other at right angles, and so that the points of intersection\nbisect the edges. Such a pair of coupled tetrahedra is shown in Figure 4.8(a).\nKepler named this body stella octangula but it was known to many others\nincluding Pacioli and Jamnitzer. Pacioli called it 'octaedron elevatum'. The\neight corners of this compound polyhedron coincide with the corners of a\ncube;, the edges of the tetrahedra forming diagonals of the square faces. An\noctahedron and a cube of appropriate sizes can also be coupled together so\nthat their edges bisect each other at right angles (see Figure 4.8(b)). The\nrelationship between the rhombic dodecahedron and this compound is analogous\nto that between the cube and the compound of two tetrahedra: the corners of\n\nRhombic polyhedra 153 (c) Figure 4.8. Compounds of the Platonic solids. the\nrhombic polyhedron coincide with those of the cube and the octahedron, and two\nintersecting edges of the compound are diagonals of a rhombic face. The\nregular dodecahedron and the icosahedron can also be coupled together to form\na compound polyhedron (Figure 4.8(c)). This compound shows a similar affinity\nwith the rhombic triacontahedron. These rhombic polyhedra have some\nresemblance to the Platonic solids. Like them, they are spherical in shape,\nhave congruent faces, and a high degree of symmetry. Moreover, the geometry of\nthe Platonic solids limits the number of possibilities to only five. Kepler\nwanted to show that the number of rhombic polyhedra is limited and that he had\nfound all the possibilities. To enumerate something you need a definition.\nKepler's was as follows: The solid formed is half-regular when the plane\nfigures are half-regular. Its solid angles are then not all the same, but\ndiffer in the number of lines they contain, though the angles are not of more\nthan two kinds and neither are they distributed on more than two spherical\nsurfaces, which are concentric. The number of angles of each kind must be the\nsame as the number of angles of one of the regular solid figures.9\n\n154 Chapter 4 Figure 4.9. Two rhombohedra. He then tries to show that the two\npolyhedra he has discovered are the only ones that satisfy this definition.\nFirst he observes that in any rhombus opposite angles are equal, two being\nacute, the others being obtuse. Furthermore, the sum of an acute angle and an\nobtuse angle is 180°. The obtuse angle must be greater than 90°, hence there\ncannot be four or more obtuse angles surrounding a point because the angle sum\nwould be greater than 360°. So, if all the angles bounding a solid angle are\nobtuse, there must be exactly three rhombi forming the solid angle. The acute\nangles of three rhombi can be fitted together to form a solid angle, and two\nsuch sets can be joined to form a (prolate) rhombohedron (see Figure 4.9). Its\neight vertices lie on two concentric spheres, six on the inner sphere, and two\non the outer one. The final clause of Kepler's definition of a half-regular\npolyhedron excludes this case since no regular polyhedron has two vertices.\nThey are also ruled out because the same number of polygons surround every\nvertex. But, Kepler argues, this polyhedron should also be excluded because\nthe six equatorial solid angles are 'mixed' being composed of both acute and\nobtuse angles: Each of the six obtuse solid angles is formed by two obtuse\nplane angles and one acute one, an irregularity which is once more contrary to\nthe definitions.11 Such 'irregularities' are not in fact excluded. Perhaps\nthey are not in the spirit of perfection implicit in the definitions. In the\nremainder of the proof, he relies on this extra 'implicit' condition: that\neach solid angle is bounded by a single type of plane angle so that acute\nangles meet only acute angles, and obtuse angles meet only obtuse angles. If\nthe obtuse angles in the rhombus are greater than 120° then three obtuse\nangles cannot be brought together to form a solid angle. If the obtuse angles\nare exactly 120° then the rhombi can be fitted together to form a tessellation\nof the\n\nRhombic polyhedra 155 plane (Figure 4.10). So, to form a polyhedron the obtuse\nangles in a lhombus must be less than 120° and, consequently, the acute angles\nmust be greatei than 60°. If all the plane angles surrounding a solid angle\nare acute then there can be at most five of them, since if there were six or\nmore, the angle sum would be greater than 360°. The case with three acute\nangles meeting has already been excluded, so the only possibilities remaining\nare for a solid angle to be bounded by four or five acute angles. These two\npossibilities are realised in the two rhombic polyhedra. ■ There are two\npoints to note arising from this discussion. Firstly, the proof is not\nconstructive—it does not tell us what shape of rhombus we need to be able to\nmake the polyhedra. Nor does it guarantee their existence. However, Kepler\nalready knows that two such polyhedra do exist and only wants to show that\nthere are no others. Even so, the question of uniqueness still needs to be\nconsidered. Is there only one of each kind? The second point concerns the\ndefinition of half-regular polyhedra Kepler assembled his definition by\nlisting several properties shared by both polyhedra and hoped that these would\nbe sufficient to characterise them. In ordei to exclude the rhombohedron, he\nrestricted the number of solid angles of each kind to be the same as occurs in\none of the Platonic solids. (He applied a similar restriction when dealing\nwith the Archimedean solids intending to exclude the pi isms and antiprisms\nbut, in fact, excluding others as well.) In the course of the proof he finds\nit more convenient to use another property that both of his rhombic polyhedra\npossess but which is not included in the definition. As in much of Kepler's\nwriting, here we can watch thought processes in action. At this point, a\nmodern mathematician would go back and alter the definition so that it\ncontained the properties needed in the proof. In this case, such a proof-\ngenerated definition could be phrased as follows: a polyhedron is half-iegulai\nif all its faces are equal half-regular polygons and each solid angle is\nsurrounded by a single kind of plane angle. Sometimes the process of juggling\ndefinitions <><><><><6 Figure 4.10. A rhombic tiling.\n\n156 Chapter 4 and proofs to achieve the strictest accuracy and widest\napplicability of theorems can take quite a long time and needs to be repeated\nseveral times. At the end, however, we cover over our early attempts at\ndefinitions which do not provide the properties we need. This can lead to\ndefinitions that appear to be unnecessarily complex until the problems which\nled to them are explained. The definition of polyhedron developed in Chapter 5\nis an example of this kind. Besides the two rhombic polyhedra that Kepler\ndescribed, and the rhombo- hedra, there are two more polyhedra whose faces are\nall congruent rhombi. They do not, however, satisfy his 'implicit' condition\nsince some of their vertices are surrounded by both acute and obtuse angles.\nOne was discovered bv Evgraf Stephanovich Fedorov in 1885. It is an oblate\nsolid with twenty faces a lhombic icosahedron (Figure 4.11(c)). It can be\nderived from the rhombic triacontahedron by collapsing a belt of rhombi that\nrun around it. The sequence of polvhedra in Figures 4.11(a)-(c) indicates how\nsuch a belt collapses. The other rhombic polyhedron is formed from Fedorov's\nby collapsing another belt of rhombi. This is illustrated by Figures 4.11\n(c)-(e). This results in another rhombic dodecahedron, shown again from a\ndifferent viewpoint in Figure 4.11(f). It was discovered in 1960 by Stanko\nBilinski when he made an exhaustive enumeration of rhombic solids. He called\nit the rhombic dodecahedron of the second kind to distinguish it from the one\ndescribed by Kepler. The Archimedean solids Pappus, writing in the fourth\ncentury AD, attributes to Archimedes a tieatise on thirteen polyhedra:\n'Figures contained by equilateral and equiangular, but not similar, polygons'.\nIn the fifth book of his Mathematical Collection, he describes each of these\npolyhedra. The revival of interest in solid geometry and tin1 creation of new\nfigures for perspective designs led to the rediscovery of some Aichimedean\nsolids. They appear among the drawings in Pacioli's Divina Proportiouc,\nDiner's Unterweysung der Messung, and Jamnitzer's Perspectiva Corpormn\nPtcgularinm (see Figures 3.14-3.16). These examples were produced by\ntruncating the Platonic solids. However, not all the Archimedean solids can be\nproduced in this way and, prior to Kepler, no-one seems to have rediscovered\nthe complete set. It is also possible that Kepler found the pseudo-Archimedean\nsolid known as Miller's solid, (Figure 2.30) for in the passage from De Nive\nSexangula quoted above (page 152) he makes a passing reference to fourteen\nArchimedean solids. From his reference to 'Archimedean solids' we can deduce\nthat Keplei was aware of Pappus' work and that, therefore, he knew to search\nfor thirteen polvhedra. However, through his systematic analysis, he found\nthat prisms and an- tiprisms also satisfy the definition; the latter had not\nbeen described beioie He defines these figures as follows:\n\nThe Archimedean solids 157 A congruence is perfect, but of lower degree, when\nthe plane figures are regular and all the angles lie on the same spherical\nsurface and are similar to one another, but the faces are of various kinds,\nthough the number of each kind must be the same as the number of faces of one\nof the most perfect figures, that is, not less than four which is the minimum\nnumber of planes to bound a solid figure. There is an imperfect congruence or\nfigure when other conditions remain the same but the larger plane figure does\nnot occur more than twice.1 The requirement that the number of faces of each\nkind in one of these figures is the same as the number of faces in a most\nperfect polyhedron (that is 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20 for the Platonic solids, and 12\nor 30 if Kepler's rhombic solids are included) is intended to exclude prisms\nand antiprisms. Kepler regards these as imperfect figures being 'discus-\nshaped' rather than 'globe-shaped' like a sphere—the most perfect of all\nsolids. Rather than insist that the number of each kind of face is Figure\n4.11. Two rhombic polyhedra can be derived from the rhombic triacontahedron by\ncollapsing 'belts' of rhombi.\n\n158 Chapter 4 at least three, which appears to be a somewhat arbitrary\nrestriction, he links the numbers of faces to the perfect solids which seems\nmore legitimate. However, the condition is far stronger than is needed and\nexcludes more than Keplei intended. There are Archimedean solids that do not\npossess this property the snub polyhedra have more than 30 triangular faces.\nKepler's enumeration of these polyhedra proceeds by considering all possible\nways that a solid angle can be formed from regular polygons. Two simple\nobservations make the process easier and Kepler states these as propositions\npreceding the main argument. The first one concerns the number of kinds of\nface that can surround a vertex. Lemma. If the faces of a convex polyhedron\nare all regular polygons then at most three different kinds of face can appear\naround any solid angle. PROOF: The four regular polygons having the smallest\ninternal angles aie the triangle (60°), the square (90°), the pentagon (108°),\nand the hexagon (120°). The total sum of these four angles is greater than\n360° so these four regular polygons cannot all be present around a vertex.\nWith a different set of four or more different regular polygons, the total\nangle sum is even larger. Hence, four or more different kinds of polygon\ncannot surround a vertex. ■ Figure 4.12. Two types of the same vertex species.\nKepler's second lemma is used to exclude certain combinations of polygons\ncontaining an odd number of sides. It is necessary for us to make a\ndistinction between the set of faces which bound a solid angle and the\nspecific orclei in which they occur. The species of a solid angle is an\nunordered list of the face's which are present, while the type of a solid\nangle specifies the order in which the faces occur around the vertex. For\nexample, the species of solid angle bounded by two triangles and two squares\ncomprises two types of solid angle according to whether opposite faces are the\nsame or different. The two types are illustrated schematically in Figure 4.12.\nThe diagrams represent the region around a vertex and the numbers indicate the\nkinds and relative positions of the polygons which surround it. This\ninformation can be written in a shorthand fashion as (3,4,3,4) and (3,3,4,4),\nwhere the lists contain the number of sides of each face in order. Kepler\nappears not to have made a distinction between species and types. He\nenumerates only vertex species, and in the case of the above example, he\nwrites:\n\nThe Archimedean solids 159 Two trigon angles and two tetragon angles are less\nthan four right angles. Thus eight trigons and six tetragons fit together to\nform a tessareskaedecahedron which I call a cuboctahedron. It is shown here\nwith the number eight [see Figure 4.13] J He does not mention that there are\ntwo possible arrangements of the polygons around the vertex. The illustration\nshows how they are to be arranged; the type (3,3,4,4) is not considered. This\ncase cannot be realised as a perfect polyhedron. Kepler states that three\npolygons of different kinds cannot form a solid angle in a perfect figure if\nany of them has an odd number of sides. An analogue of this result which\napplies to vertices surrounded by four polygons can be used to exclude the\ncase (3,3,4,4) above. These two results are collected togethei in the\nfollowing lemma. Lemma. A polyhedron in which all the solid angles are\nsurrounded in (he same way cannot have solid angles of the following types: (0\nwhere a is odd and b ^ c. («) where a ^ c. Proof: In the first case, the fact\nthat all the solid angles have the same tvpe implies that the 6-gon faces must\nalternate with the c-gon faces round the boundary of an a-gon face. But, since\na is assumed to be odd, this leads to a contradiction. This is clearly seen in\nthe example shown in Figure 4.14(a) which illustiates the case when a = 7. In\ncase (ii), we consider the way that the faces must be arranged around the\n3-gon. At each angle, the face opposite the 3-gon is always a 6-gon. Since all\nthe vertices have the same type, the sides of the 3-gon must be attached to\nrz-gons and c-gons, and these must alternate around the 3-gon. This again\nleads to an inconsistency (see Figure 4.14(b)). ■ Kepler then states the\nproposition: There are thirteen solid congruences which are perfect to a lower\ndegree. From these thirteen we obtain the Archimedean solids}\n\n0«) I. Cubiu Cm u.

The main difference is\nthat I have distinguished between species and types whereas Kepler did not.\nThe proof becomes somewhat repetitive once vou have the idea. Theorem. Suppose\nthat all the solid angles of a convex polyhedron have the same type. Besides\nthe two families of types (4, 4, n) and (3,3,3,//) theie are thirteen types of\nsolid angle that can occur. These possibilities are lealised by the families\nof prisms, antiprisms, and the Archimedean solids lespectivelv. PROOF: The\ntheorem is proved by exhausting all the possible combinations of faces which\ncan surround a solid angle and excluding those which cannot be extended in the\nrequired manner. The first lemma above shows that the species of solid angle\npresent can be surrounded by at most three sorts of regulai polvgon. and there\nmust be at least two sorts of polygon (by definition). Following Kepler, these\ntwo cases are investigated separately. First, we consider those species of\nsolid angle where there are two soits of faces. (1) species of solid angle\nbounded by 3-gons and 4-gons only. Suppose there is only one 4-gon at each\nsolid angle. Then there can be at most four 3-gons since the angle sum of five\nor more 3-gons and a 4-gon is greater than 360°. Thus there are three possible\ntypes of solid angle. (3,3,3,3,4) which is realised in the snub cube;\n(3,3,3,4) which forms a square antiprism; and (3,3,4) which is excluded\nbecause part (i) of the pievious lemma shows that this type of solid angle\ncannot be extended.\n\nThe Archimedean solids 163 V [>3 :>0\" 3 ^~^ 3 v\\3 snub cube 3 4 3 3 square\nantiprism impossible Next, suppose that there are two 4-gons in the species of\nsolid angle Three 3-gons and two 4-gons fit round a point in a plane so there\ncan be at most two 3-gons at the solid angle. The species of solid angle\ncontaining two 4- gons and two 3-gons comes in two types. One of these\n(3,3,4,4) is excluded by part (n) of the preceding lemma; the other (3,4,3,4)\ncorresponds to the cub-octahedron. The remaining case of two 4-gons and a\nsingle 3-gon (3,4,4) forms a triangular prism. 4 4 3 /\\ 3 / 3\\ =3( >0\" 3 4\nimpo 3 4 ssible 3 4 4 3 cub-octahedron 4 4 3 triangu lar prism If there are\nmore than two 4-gons at the solid angle then there is a single possibility,\nnamely (3,4,4,4), the rhomb-cub-octahedron.

The analysis of this\ncase is the same as the preceding one. If there is only one 5-gon at a solid\nangle then there can be at most four 3-gons. The three possible types give\nrise to the snub dodecahedron (3,3,3,3,5), and a pentagonal antiprism\n(3,3,3,5).\n\n164 Chapter 4 3 /\\ 3 >360\" snub dodecahedron pentagonal antiprism impossible\nIf there are two 5-gons in the species of solid angle then there can be at\nmost two 3-gons. Again, the species containing two 3-gons comes in two types:\n(3,3,5,5) cannot be extended by part (ii) of the lemma; and (3,5,3,5) which is\nthe icosi-dodecahedron. The remaining case is excluded by part, (i) of the\nlemma. There are no other species of solid angle containing 5-gons as oven a\nsingle 3-gon with three 5-gons has an angle sum larger than 360°. 3 /\\ 3 >360\"\nimpossible 3 5 5 3 icosi-dodecahedron 5 impo 5 3 ssible (3) species of solid\nangle bounded by 3-gons and 6-gons only. In the case when the species contains\na single 6-gon there can be at most three 3-gons as four 3-gons and a 6-gon do\nnot form a convex angle but are planar. Three 3-gons and a 6-gon (3,3,3,6)\nform a hexagonal antipiism, and the case of two 3-gons and a 6-gon (3,3,6) is\nexcluded by the lemma. 3 /\\ 3 =360\" hexagonal antiprism impossible If there\nare two 6-gons at the solid angle then there can be only one 3-gon, otherwise\nthe angle sum is too great. This single case (3,6,6) conesponds to the\ntruncated tetrahedron.

And if n is even and greater than 10, the sum of the plane angles\nis greater than 360°. This leaves the cases (3,8,8) which is the truncated\ncube, and (3,10,10), the truncated dodecahedron. 10 10 12 >360\" truncated cube\ntruncated dodecahedron =360\" This completes the analysis of all the species of\nsolid angle containing 3-gons and one other type of polygon. Next, the other\nspecies which contain only two kinds of polygon are investigated. (5) species\nof solid angle containing 4-gons and n-gons only (n ^ 5). If there is a single\n??,-gon face then the type of solid angle must be (4. 4, n) as the sum of the\nplane angles of three or more 4-gons and an r;-gon is too large. The allowable\ncase is a prism with an n-gon base. If there are two n-gon faces then there is\nonly a single 4-gon (otherwise the angle sum would be too large). Thus, the\ntype of solid angle is (4, ik d). If\n\n166 Chapter 4 n ^ 8 then the angle sum is too large, and if n is odd then pait\n(/) of the lemma shows that no polyhedron is possible. The onlv remaining case\nis (4,6,6). This is realised as the truncated octahedron. The possibility of\nthree or more n-gons together with 4-gons is excluded by their angle sum.\n>36()\" >360\" truncated octahedion (6) species of solid angle containing 5-gons\nand n-gons only (n ^ C). A single n-gon cannot form part of a solid angle, for\nthe angle sum of three 5-gons and an n-gon is greater than 360°, and an angle\nof type (o. 3, n) is excluded by part (?) of the lemma. If there are two\nn-gons then an angle sum argument shows that the solid angle must be of type\n(5,n,n). The smallest value of n gives the truncated icosahedron (5,6,6). For\nany larger value of n the sum of the plane angles is more than 360°. More than\ntwo n-gons leads to an angle sum that is too huge. >360\" >360\" truncated\nicosahedion In any other species of solid angle containing only two sorts of\npolygon t lit\" smallest possible angle sum arises from two 6-gons and a 7-gon,\nand this is laigei than 360°. Thus every species of solid angle which contains\nonly two kinds of polvgon has now been dealt with. It remains to consider the\nspecies involving three kinds of polygon. (7) species of solid angle\ncontaining 3-gons, 4-gons and n-gons (?> ^5). Assume first of all that there\nis a single n-gon. If there were one 4-gon there could be at most two 3-gons;\nthe species containing two 3-gons are excluded by part (ii) of the lemma\nabove; and the angle type (3,4,?;) is excluded bv part (i).\n\nThe Archimedean solids 1G7 4 n \"*/\\ ^ / 3\\ 3 4 3 n 3 4 n 3 4 >360\" impossible\nimpossible impossible If there are two 4-gons and a single n-gon at the solid\nangle then there can be only one 3-gon, otherwise the sum of the plane angles\nis at least 300°. The angle sum is also too large if n ^ 6. Thus there are two\npossible tvpes: (3,4,4,5) which is excluded by part (ii) of the lemma; and\n(3,4,5,4) which is the rhomb-icosi-dodecahedron. =360\" =360\" impossible rhomb-\nicosi-dodecahedi on (8) species of solid angle containing three kinds of face,\nnone of which aie 3-gons. Suppose that four faces form the solid angle. The\nsmallest possible combination is to have two 4-gons, a 5-gon and a 6-gon. The\nsum of the internal angles of these polygons is greater than 360° so there\nmust be three polygons forming the solid angle, all of which are different.\nPart (i) of the lemma shows that, in this case, none of the polygons can have\nan odd number of sides. The smallest possible combination of faces is (4,6,8)\nwhich corresponds to the great rhomb-cub-octahedron (or truncated cub-\noctahedron). The next smallest combination is (4,6,10) which corresponds to\nthe great rhomb-icosi- dodecahedron (or truncated icosi-dodecahedron). In all\nother combinations of faces the angle sum is too large to produce a solid\nangle. truncated eub-octahedron truncated icosi-dodecahedron =360\" >36()\" All\nthe possibilities of placing regular polygons together to form a solid angle\nhave now been considered. All the types of solid angle that are not excluded\nby the simple conditions in the previous lemmas are candidates for polyhedra\nwhich are 'perfect to a lower degree'. After excluding the prismatic families,\nthe thirteen\n\n168 CHAPTER 4 possibilities that remain are realised by the Archimedean\nsolids. Keplei s illustrations of them are shown in Figure 4.13. Notice that\nthe order of the polyhedra in the figures does not match the order in which\nthey appear in the enumeiation. Instead, all the truncated solids are grouped\ntogether. Furthermore, the timirations of the Platonic solids are in the same\nsequence as the Platonic figuirs in the cosmological model. ■ Star polygons\nand star polyhedra Star-shaped polygons such as the pentagram have been known\nsince antiquity. A vase dating from the seventh century BC has a pentagram\nforming part of its decoration. Moorish tilings contain a variety of star\npolygons. Symbolic and mystical properties have been attributed to the\npentagram in manv cultmes and professions. It has been used as a symbol of\nrecognition, a talisman oi charm, and is associated with alchemy, astrology\nand magic. The golden latio occins in several aspects of its geometry—a fact\nknown to the Greeks and also lecoidcd bv Pacioli. Star polygons were first\nstudied mathematically by Thomas Biadwardine (1290 1349) and were later\ninvestigated by Charles de Boulles (1470 1533) Kepler also made a study of\nthem and wrote an account of them in book I oi Hnr- monices Mundi. He defines\na regular polygon as a figure whose sides aie all equal in length and whose\nangles are equal and pointing outwards. He goes on to distinguish two kinds of\nregular polygon: the fundamental or primary ones whose sides do not cross; and\nothers of a more general type called stellated polygons (stellar meaning\nstarlike). These stellated polygons can be derived iioni the primary ones by\nextending non-adjacent sides until they intersect. He int hides onlv those\nstellated polygons that can be traced in a single line. Thus the compound\npolygons in Figures 4.15(b) and (c) are excluded. Keplei then generalised this\nprocedure so that it could be applied to the regular polyhedra. When\nconsidering polygons it is clear that the stellated figures aie produced by\nextending the sides of the convex figures. But in three dimensions it is less\nclear how to proceed. What should be extended? Which parts of a polyhedron are\nits sides? Kepler gives two alternative generalisations of this idea. Firstly,\nthe sides of the faces of the polyhedron can be extended until thev intersect.\nHe calls a polyhedron produced in this way an echinus (the Latin foi\n\"hedgehog\" oi 'sea urchin'), and aptly describes such polyhedra as spiky or\nprickly His second method involves extending the faces themselves until they\nintersect, the lesulting polyhedron being called an ostrea ('oyster'). These\ntwo methods are now railed edge-stellation and face-stellation, respectively.\nThe two stai polyhedra which Kepler discovered appear to have been pio-\n\nStar polygons and star polyhedra 169 (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 4.15. Star\npolygons (a), (d) and compound polygons (b), (c). duced by applying the first\nmethod to the Platonic solids. In his account of the resulting polyhedra he\ngives descriptions only and, unusually, does not pass on any indication of how\nthey were discovered. Extending the edges of a tetrahedron does not produce a\nnew polyhedron since the lines do not intersect apart from at the original\nvertices. The same is true of the cube and the octahedron. Applying the edge-\nstellation process to the dodecahedron does produce an example of an echinus;\nthe icosahedron furnishes the other example. These two polyhedra are shown in\nFigure 4.16 and Plate 8. Kepler's own sketches of them are reproduced in\nFigure 4.17. Figure 4.16. Kepler's two star polyhedra.\n\n170 Chapter 4 Figure 4.17. Kepler's sketches of his 'prickly' polyhedra. In\nthe last few years of his life, Kepler started preparing a treatise on\ngeometry. Among his notes for this unfinished work there is a section entitled\nDa Auctis (On Augmented Figures) which deals with the stellation process. In\nthis work he calls the twelve-spiked star polyhedron 'echinus major\nicosaedricus' and the twenty-spiked one 'echinus minor icosaedricus' (larger\nand smaller icosahedral hedgehogs). Kepler also recognised that the larger\nhedgehog could be derived from the dodecahedron via the second process of\nface-stellation. In fact, both of the polyhedra can be produced in this way,\nand it is the process of face-stellation which is referred to in their current\nEnglish names: the twelve-pointed one being the small stellated dodecahedron,\nthe twenty-pointed one the great stellated\n\nStar polygons and star polyhedra 171 dodecahedron. These names were introduced\nby Arthur Cayley in 1859 The Stella octangula, or compound of two tetrahedra,\ncan also be produced bv face- stellation, this time by extending the faces of\nan octahedron. All three stellations can easily be regarded as being formed\nfrom convex regular polyhedra with a suitable pyramid erected on each face.\nFrom this viewpoint one is led to compare the convex figure with the augmented\none. Noticing this, Kepler comments that the stellated figures are so closely\nrelated the one to the dodecahedron and the other to the icosahedron that the\nlatter two figures, particularly the dodecahedron, seem somehow truncated or\nmaimed when compared to the figures with spikes.1 The process of augmenting\nconvex polyhedra by adding pyramids of various heights had been used to\ngenerate many new polyhedra in the preceding 200 years. It is not surprising,\ntherefore, to find that all of Kepler's stellated foims had already been\ndepicted. Earlier sketches of the Stella octangula appear in the works of\nPacioli and Jamnitzer. A picture of the small stellated dodecahedron dating\nfrom the 1420's can be seen in Saint Mark's Basilica in Venice (see Plate 7).\nIt is inlaid in marble and forms part of the floor decorations in one of the\nmain doorways. The design has been attributed to Uccello. The great stellated\ndodecahedron was pictured by Jamnitzer as part of one of his polyhedral\nmonuments. The spiky component at the core of the monument shown on page 288\nis an example of this polyhedron. However, Kepler's interest in these figures\nwas not merely aesthetic. He considered them in a mathematical context. The\ntwo stellations of the dodecahedron can be interpreted in yet another way. A\nclose examination of the small stellation reveals that the triangular faces\nare arranged in groups of five so that all the faces in each group lie in a\nplane. Furthermore, each group surrounds a regular pentagon buried under a\npyramid. Together, a pentagon and its five satellite triangles form a\npentagram. Therefore, this polyhedron can be regarded as having pentagrams for\nfaces, twelve in total, arranged with five meeting at each vertex. The great\nstellation can also be regarded as being built up from twelve pentagrams,\nmeeting in thiees at the vertices. The models of these polyhedra shown in\nPlate 8 are coloured so that each pentagram is painted in a single colour.\nUnder this radically different interpretation the faces of the polyhedra are\nallowed to pass through each other like the sides of a star polygon. The star\npentagon faces are joined side against side as in conventional polyhedra, yet\nthey pass through each other allowing some parts of each face to be seen and\nconfining others to the interior of the polyhedron hidden from sight. The\nDutch artist Maurits Cornells Escher (1898-1972) used this interpretation in\nsome of his work. Figure 4.18 is a preliminary sketch which he made\n\n172 Chapter 4 \\ 1 / ' I © 1996 M. C. Escher / Cordon Art - Baarn - Holland.\nAll lights resoiwd. Figure 4.18. A sketch by M. C. Escher showing a cut-away\nview of the small stellated dodecahedron. showing a cut away diagram of the\nsmall stellation. The sketch clearly shows the faces continuing under each\npyramid. In his 1952 print Gravity, shown on page 248, Escher adds twelve\nanimals, one standing on each face and poking four limbs and a head tortoise-\nlike through the holes in a pyramid. Escher also made a perspex model of the\ncomplete polyhedron and engraved a starfish into each of the twelve pentagram\nfaces. Regarding the faces of these polyhedra as pentagrams forces us to\naccept the following surprising conclusion: they are regular polyhedra, for\ntheii faces are equal regular polygons and the same number surround each solid\nangle. Including the star polygons among the regular polygons allows a more\ngeneral type of regular polyhedron to be constructed. Kepler does not\nrecognise that, in this generalised setting, his new regular polyhedra have\nthe same status as the convex regular polyhedra. In the same way that he\nseparated regular polygons into primary and stellated, he regards the convex\npolyhedra as fundamental and\n\nSemisolid polyhedra 173 their stellations as secondary: 'nothing but an\naugmented dodecahedron (but augmented most regularly)'. Peihaps pait of the\nreason why he was reluctant to raise his stai polvhedia to the level of the\nPlatonic polyhedra is that it would ruin his solution of the cosmic mystery.\nEven after his work on the elliptical nature of planelaiv oibits. Kepler\ncontinued to experiment with his planetary model. In book v of Harmonicas\nMuudi he investigates the possibility of replacing the dodecahedion and\nicosahedron by a single 'echinus major' with its circumsphere bounding the\noibit of Mais and its midsphere bounding the orbit of Venus leaving Earth's\noibit free and undetermined. But in a later work, Epitome Astronomiae\nCopernicanae, he discards this idea. If such an alteration were made then the\nreason (here are but six planets would evaporate, and the whole harmonious\nnature of his system would be destroyed. This unwillingness to abandon his\ncherished model may go some way to explaining why Kepler did not investigate\nthe properties of his star-faced polyhedra more thoroughly. In the case of the\ntwo rhombus-faced polyhedra, he pioceeded to analyse them and show that he had\nfound all the possibilities. In contiast, he makes no attempt to establish\nwhether any other polyhedra have properties similar to his star polyhedra. The\ntwo stellations are composed of pentagrams meeting in groups of three or five\nto form the solid angles. Is it possible to construct a polyhedron with four\npentagrams surrounding each solid angle? Furthermore, the angle in the corner\nof a pentagram is 36° so up to nine can be fitted round a vertex. It is\nconceivable that polyhedra with up to nine pentagrams per solid angle could be\nconstructed. The other star polygons provide further possibilities. Are\nKepler's star polyhedra the only orres? Kepler himself is strangely silent on\nthis topic. We shall return to the problem in Chapter 7. Semisolid polyhedra\nKepler did experiment with other star polygons. Besides the two pentagiani-\nfRced polyhedra, he found two semisolid polyhedra: one composed of star\noctagons, the other of star decagons. The sides of the first mid fourth points\nof star octagons and star decagons lie in a line, which passes through two\nintermediate points, and the stars can be fitted together with such sides\njoined two by two. The star octagons make a kind of cube, and the star\ndecagons a kind of dodecahedron, figures which have not angles but cars, for\nwhen two of the plane angles are fitted together they must leave a gap, which\ncan not be closed.1\"\n\n174 Chapter 4 (a) (b) Figure 4.19. Kepler's two 'semisolid' polyhedra. The\n'eared cube' and the 'eared dodecahedron' are shown in Figure 4.19. Like the\nstar polyhedra whose faces are pentagrams, the faces of these incomplete\npolyhedra are star polygons that meet along their edges. As these edges cross\neach other, the faces pass through each other. In each figure, the shaded\nparts are the visible parts of a single face. Recall Kepler's requirement that\nif a polyhedron does not close up then we must be able to fill in any gaps\nwith regular polygons. The two semisolid polyhedra with 'ears' can be\ncompleted by the addition of regular polygons although it is not certain that\nthe way in which it is done is what Kepler had in mind. He made no reference\nto it. The 'eared cube' is completed by adding eight triangles to the six\noctagrams. The result is shown in Figure 4.20(a)—the visible parts of one\ntriangular face are shaded. The sides of the triangles are joined to the\nunused sides of the octagrams so that two polygons meet at every edge.\nHowever, this is not possible without allowing the triangles to intersect each\nother. The lines where they meet are not counted as edges just as the points\nwhere the sides of a star polygon cross are not counted as vertices. The\ncompounds of polyhedra mentioned earlier also exhibit this phenomenon. In\nthose cases, the faces of one polyhedron pass through the faces of another;\nhere the polyhedron intersects itself. The other 'eared' polyhedron is\ncompleted by the addition of twelve pentagons (see Figure 4.20(b)). Curiously,\nboth of these figures arise by extending the edges of an Archimedean solid.\nThey are edge-stellations of the truncated cube and truncated dodecahedron,\nrespectively. This is, perhaps, how Kepler discovered them.\n\nUniform polyhedra 175 (a) (b) Figure 4.20. Kepler's semisolid polyhedra can be\ncompleted to produce uniform polyhedra. Uniform polyhedra The two polyhedra in\nFigure 4.20 are examples of uniform polyhedra. These are to the Archimedean\nsolids what the star polyhedra are to the Platonic solids. All their vertices\nare surrounded in the same way2 and their faces are regular polygons (star or\nconvex). Now, however, the faces are allowed to intersect each other. Included\nunder this definition are the Platonic and Archimedean solids, the prisms and\nantiprisms, and Kepler's two pentagram-faced star polyhedra. There are new\npossibilities, too. MX Figure 4.21. Prism and antiprism with star polygon\nbases. For a start, we can form prisms and antiprisms with star polygons as\nbases. An example of each is shown in Figure 4.21. The base for the prism is a\npentagram. The sides of the pentagrams are not drawn in full and the top\nappears as a ten-sided non-convex polygon. (This decagon is sometimes called a\npentacle.) 2We also need to impose some kind of restriction on the symmetry of\nthe resulting figure. To be precise, the polyhedron must be vertex transitive.\n\n176 Chapter 4 However, all the star-shaped polygons in Figures 4.20-4.25 are\nto be thought of as star polygons like those illustrated in Figure 4.15. The\nsquare faces of the prism are attached along the sides of the pentagrams and\nintersect each other. The visible parts of one of these squares are shaded.\nThe antiprism is based on one of the star heptagons and the shaded regions are\nthe visible parts of an equilateral triangle. Other uniform polyhedra can be\nderived from the Platonic and Archimedean solids. For example, the edge-\nframework of the rhomb-cub-octahedron can be viewed as bounding six octagons\nwhich intersect each other (Figure 4.22(a)). Two uniform polyhedra can be\nformed by adding to these either twelve squares, or eight triangles and six\nsquares. These two possibilities are shown in Figures 4.22(b) and (c). (a) (b)\n(c) Figure 4.22. Two uniform polyhedra, (b) and (c), with the same edge-\nskeleton as a rhomb-cub-octahedron. The edge-framework of an octahedron bounds\nthree squares as shown in Figure 4.23(a). By adding four triangles to these we\ncomplete another uniform polyhedron (Figure 4.23(b)). It is commonly called\nthe heptahedron since it has seven faces. The cub-octahedron furnishes two\nfurther examples. Its edge-framework\n\nUniform polyhedra 177 (a) (b) Figure 4.23. Four triangles added to three\northogonal squares form the heptahedron. bounds four hexagons (Figure\n4.24(a)), and uniform polyhedra result by adding either the squares or the\ntriangles of the original cub-octahedron (Figures 4.24(b) and (c)). Apart from\nthe two uniform polyhedra derived from Kepler's semisolid ones, none of these\nexamples contains star polygons. Four uniform polyhedra containing star\noctagons are shown in Figure 4.25. In the first two examples, the six\noctagrams occupy equivalent positions. The polyhedra are completed by the\naddition of (a) six squares and eight triangles, or (b) twelve squares. In the\nfirst case, the squares lie in planes parallel to the octagrams. In the second\nexample, the squares are parallel to planes passing through two opposite edges\nof the surrounding cube. Figure 4.25(c) contains eight hexagons and six\noctagons besides its six octagrams, and Figure 4.25(d) is completed with\ntwelve squares and eight hexagons. The hexagons in this last example are\nalmost entirely hidden from view. The small triangular regions are, in fact,\nopenings which give access to large cavities inside the polyhedron whose walls\nare formed by the hexagons. There are many more uniform polyhedra. As well as\nthose listed above, there are two more composed of a single kind of polygon\n(the star polyhedra discovered (b) (c) Figure 4.24. Two uniform polyhedra, (b)\nand (c), with the same edge- skeleton as a cub-octahedron.\n\n178 Chapter 4 (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 4.25. Four uniform polyhedra. by Louis\nPoinsot in 1810 discussed in Chapter 7) and 42 having more than one kind of\nface. Some of them were discovered in the early 1880's. The Frenchman A.\nBadoureau considered systematically each of the Platonic and Archimedean\nsolids, searching for regular polygons in their edge-frameworks or star\npolygons in their faces. He found 37. At the same time, working independently\nin Austria, Johann Pitsch found 18, four of which were not included on\nBadoureau's list. Fifty years later, H. S. M. Coxeter and J. C. P. Miller used\na different method of enumeration and added twelve new uniform polyhedra. This\nbrought the total to 75, 53 of which were non-convex and non-regular. However,\nthey could not prove that they had found all the possibilities. Ten years\nlater M. S. and H. C. Longuet-Higgins worked on the problem and rediscovered\neleven of the twelve. Jean Lesavre and Raymond Mercier concentrated on a\nspecial case: they searched for uniform polyhedra without reflection symmetry\nand found five such snub polyhedra. Eventually, in 1954, the list of 75\nuniform polyhedra was published. It was not until the advent of the computer\nthat J. Skilling was able to show that the list was complete.\n\nUniform polyhedra 179 The uniform polyhedra were the main subject for Magnus\nWenningers hook Polyhedron Models. Starting with the simple Platonic and\nArchimedean solids, he progresses to some stellated models and then to the 53\nother uniform polyhedra. The work contains photos of completed models and\ninstructions on how to make your own. Some of them are extremely intricate. He\nalso names each solid. His names for the completions of Kepler's 'eared'\npolyhedra (Figure 4.20) are 'quasitruncated hexahedron' and 'quasitruncated\nsmall stellated dodecahedron'. Kepler's influence on the subsequent\ndevelopment of mathematics was minimal. His work on star polyhedra was\ncertainly unknown to Poinsot 200 vcars on. Later still, Eugene Charles Catalan\nwas unaware that Archimedean polyhedra had been previously investigated. One\nreason that Kepler's lesults were overlooked has to do with the fact that much\nof his work is not published in the form of a scientific exposition, but\nrather as a saga recording the trials of the process of discovery. He includes\nin his accounts the motivation, the assaults he has tried, the failures and\ndead-ends, the moment of inspiration, his feelings when success comes, as well\nas his solution to the problem at hand. This makes it difficult to isolate the\nuseful results from the discussion in which they aie embedded. Consequently,\nthe work of this most creative of people lay neglected for many years.\n\nElMliiiiii'-'il'JiiilH From Perspectiva Corporum Regularium by Wenzel\nJamnitzer, 1568.\n\n181 Surfaces, Solids and Spheres The first impoitant notions in topology were\nacquired in the course o/ the study of polyhedral Henri Lobcsgue The reader\nwho has made several models may have observed the following phenomenon: as the\nnumber of solid angles of a polyhedron increases, the sharpness of its corners\ndecreases. Compare a cube with a dodecahedron, foi instance. The eight solid\nangles in the cube are all acute whereas the twenty solid angles in a\ndodecahedron are obtuse. This 'sharpness' can be quantified if we cut along\none of the edges and open out the faces so they lie flat (Figure 5.1). In anv\nsolid angle the sum of its face angles is always less than 360° and it is the\nsize of the deficit which determines the sharpness of the solid angle: the;\nlarger the deficit, the more acute the resulting angle. Examining the\ndeficiencies in the two polyhedra more closely reveals another phenomenon.\nEach of the eight angles in a cube has a deficit of 90° and each solid angle\nin a dodecahedron has a deficit of 36°. In both cases, the deficiencies of all\nthe solid angles add up to 720°. These observations illustrate a theorem\ndiscovered by Rene Descartes (1596-1650). Descartes' theorem appears as part\nof a work called Progymnasimitn <lc Soli- dorum Elcmentis (Exercises on the\nElements of Solids) along with other propositions in solid geometry and a\nsection on polyhedral numbers—analogues of the familiar triangular and square\nnumbers. He gives formulae for polyhedial numbers corresponding to the five\nPlatonic solids and nine of the Archimedean solids. Descartes did not publish\nthis manuscript and it is a quirk of fortune that its contents have survived.\nIn the autumn of 1649, Descartes went to Stockholm at the invitation of\n\n182 Chapter 5 -^90° Figure 5.1. Deficiencies of the cube and dodecahedron.\nQueen Christina of Sweden, but the severity of the climate was too much for\nhim and he died six months later. His belongings were shipped back to France\nbut suffered accident on route, the box carrying his manuscripts ending up in\nthe Seine at Paris. The papers were rescued from the river, separated and\ndried. Later, some were published and the remainder were made available for\nconsultation. In 1676 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (one of the founders of the\ncalculus) made copies of several of the latter manuscripts including the work\non polyhedra. Descartes' original manuscript has vanished and it is only\nthrough the copy that the work is preserved. Even so, it remained unknown\nuntil 1860 when the copy was discovered by Comte Foucher de Careil among a\ncollection of uncatalogued Leibniz papers. Descartes was the first person to\nstudy polyhedra in a general context. Prior to this, people had concentrated\ntheir attention on specific examples oi on particular properties shared by a\nfew polyhedra; the idea of investigating the set of all polyhedra as a whole\ndoes not seem to have occurred to anyone. During the two centuries which\nelapsed while Descartes' work lay forgotten and unknown, another mathematician\ninitiated a general study of polyhedra a study which had far-reaching effects.\nLeonhard Euler (1707-1783) revolutionised the theory of polyhedra by\nintroducing new ideas and a new vocabulary. He discovered a formula that\nrelated the numbers of the various constituent parts of a polyhedron but he\ncould not explain its origin. Many mathematicians after him struggled to\nunderstand the nature of his discovery and to find its underlying causes, the\nfoundations on which it depended. The ensuing debate played a major ioIo in\nthe development of mathematics. Out of the original uncertainty arose a new\nkind of geometrical discipline—topology.\n\nPlane angles, solid angles, and their measurement 183 Plane angles, solid\nangles, and their measurement In order to arrive at Descartes' theorem it is\nnecessary to explore the problems of angle measurement. Once this has been\ndone, and some preliminary results have been established, the proof of the\ntheorem becomes almost immediate. An angle is a region of a plane contained\nbetween two intersecting lines so that segments of the two lines and their\npoint of intersection form part of its boundary. It is also a measure of the\ninclination of the lines to each other. Since classical times there have been\ntwo units of measurement for angles: the Babylonian system of degrees used in\nastronomy and trigonometry, and the right angles used in geometry. Euclid\nsingles out the right angle as the fundamental angle and expi esses other\nangles as multiples of it. The tenth definition of his Elements says that when\na line stands on another line so that the adjacent angles are equal to each\nother then each of these angles is a right angle; the fourth postulate is that\nall right angles are equal. The sizes of plane angles are then expressed as ft\nactions of a right angle. Thus the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is\ntwo right angles; each of the interior angles in a regular pentagon is one-\nand-a-hfth right angles. Proclus extended Euclid's result on the interior\nangle sum of a triangle to polygons in general. By dividing an n-sided polygon\ninto triangles he showed that its interior angle sum is 2(n — 2) right angles.\nHe also proved that the sum of the exterior angles in any polygon was equal to\nfour right angles. The exterior angle measures the amount by which one arm of\nan angle deviates from the straight course of the other (see Figure 5.2(a)).\nTherefore, when going round a polygon, we would expect that the total sum of\nall the deviations make a complete turn (5.2(b)). Proclus proves this by\nnoting the fact that exterior and interior angles are complementary—they add\nup to two right angles. Thus the sum of all the interior and exterior angles\nin an n-sided polygon is 2n right angles. Deducting the 2(n — 2) right angles\nwhich comprise the interior angle sum, we see that the exterior angle sum is\nfour right angles—a complete turn. Another angle that is associated to a plane\nangle is its supplementary angle. This is constructed by erecting a\nperpendicular on each line forming the angle and extending them until they\nmeet (Figure 5.3(a)). It is a simple exercise to show that an angle and its\nsupplement come to two right angles and thus they are complementary.\nTherefore, the supplement of an angle and its external angle are equal. Hence,\nall the supplementary angles in a polygon add up to foui right angles. A\ndifferent proof of this fact is indicated in Figures 5.3(b) and (c): all the\n'wedges' of the supplementary angles can be translated to fit together mound a\npoint. Besides the two traditional ways of measuring angles, there is a third,\nmore\n\n184 Chapter 5 ^x^exterior angle (a) Figure 5.2. Exterior angles. modern, measure. It uses the length of the arc intercepted by the angle on a circle of radius one unit centred on the point of intersection of the two lines. This is called the radian measure, and an angle measures one radian when the length of arc is one unit, that is, when it is equal to the radius of the circle. A whole circle is 27r radians (or 360° or four right angles). A right angle is | radians; the angles in an equilateral triangle are each | radians. Proclus' theorems can be restated as: the sum of the interior angles in an n-sided polygon is (n — 2)7r, and the sum of its exterior angles is 2ir. In book XI of the Elements, Euclid begins his treatment of solid geometry. He defines a solid angle as the space which is contained by three or more planes meeting at a point and not lying in a plane. He then shows that the sum of the plane angles forming the solid angle must be less than four right angles, but he makes no attempt to quantify the solid angle itself. There is some difficulty in this. How should the size of a solid angle be measured? How can solid angles be compared to one another? If a plane angle is measured by the arc of a circle then perhaps solid angles supplementary angle (a) (b) (c) Figure 5.3. Supplementary angles. %\n\nPlane angles, solid angles, and their measurement 185 can be measured by segments of a sphere. To pursue this analogy, imagine a sphere of radius one unit centred on the apex of a solid angle. It will intersect the plane figures forming the solid angle in arcs of great circles, and these arcs will bound a polygon on the sphere which lies inside the solid angle (see Figure 5.4). This spherical polygon is a measure of the solid angle. The angles between its sides are the dihedral angles between the faces of the solid angle, and the sides are a measure of the plane angles of the faces. In fact, the length of a side is the radian measure of a plane angle. Just as the length of an arc is used as a measure of a plane angle, so the area of a spherical polygon can be used to measure a solid angle. The units for this quantity are called steradians. Figure 5.4. Consider the particular solid angle formed from three mutually perpendicular planes. Every plane angle and every dihedral angle is a right angle. The spherical polygon which measures this angle will cover one eighth of the surface of the sphere. Since the sphere has unit radius, its total surface area is 47r, hence the measure of this solid angle is |. This solid angle is an example of a solid right angle. (Recall that plane right angles also measure |.) However, whereas all plane right angles are equal (congruent), there are many solid right angles since the number of spherical polygons whose area is | is unlimited. The supplementary angle to a plane angle is constructed by erecting lines perpendicular to those forming the angle. Similarly, a supplementary solid angle can be constructed from a given solid angle by erecting planes perpendicular to its faces and edges in such a way that they meet in a point (see Figure 5.5). The dihedral angles of this supplementary solid angle are the supplements of the face angles of the original solid angle. So, for example, in the figure, f3 is the supplement of a and hence a + (3 = n radians. And, as in the case of the supplementary plane angles of a polygon, the supplementary solid angles of a polyhedron can be translated to fit together around a point. Therefore, the sum of the supplementary solid angles is in—the whole sphere. In order to find an analogy to the exterior plane angle in the solid geometry\n\n186 Chapter 5 Figure 5.5. Construction of a supplementary solid angle. setting\nit is helpful to have a slightly different viewpoint. Rather than think of the\nexterior angle as the amount by which a line deviates from a straight-on\ndirection, we can see it as the amount by which the interior angle falls short\nof a straight line. Thus an exterior angle measures a deficit. For an\nanalogous idea applicable to solid angles we can measure the amount by which\nthey 'fall short' of being planar. The angle by which the sum of the plane\nangle's around a solid angle is less than 2n is called its deficiency. Solid\nangles with a large deficiency (like tetrahedral angles, for example) are\nsharp while those with small deficiencies (dodecahedral angles) are blunt and\nsquat. Recall that the exterior and supplementary angles of a plane angle aie\nequal. It is a remarkable fact that the deficiency of a solid angle is equal\nto the size of its supplementary angle. This is a consequence of a certain\nproperty of spherical polygons. Unlike plane polygons, whose area depends on\ntheir size as well as their shape, the area of a spherical polygon is\ncompletely determined by its shape. This result first appeared in print in\n1629 in a collection of essays bv Albert Girard. In the third essay, entitled\nDe la Mesure de la Supcrficc des Tiianglcs & Polygones Sphericques,\nNouvellement Inventee, he showed that the area of a spherical polygon equals\nthe sum of its interior angles minus the sum of the interior angles in a plane\npolygon having the same number of sides.

His other geometric results can be\nconsidered as consequences of it. The manuscript begins: A solid right angle\nis one which embraces the eighth part of the spheie even though it is not\nformed by three plane right angles. ■ • • As in a plane figure all the\nexterior angles, taken together, equal fom right angles, so in a solid body\nall the exterior angles, taken togethei. equal eight solid right anglcs.(\nAlthough he does not define an exterior solid angle, Descartes does state some\nof their properties. These include! the fact that they can be measured by the\namount by which the sum of the plane angles bounding the (interior) solid\nangle is less than four right angles. Thus we have Theorem. The sum of the\ndeficiencies of the solid angles in a polvhedion is eight right angles. ■ The\nmanuscript contains no proof of this theorem but the results concerning angle\nmeasurement presented in the previous section were all known by Ki.'M). and\nthe proof follows easily from them: the sum of the supplementary solid angles\nof a polyhedron is known to equal eight right angles (the whole sphere1) and\nthe lemma shows that the supplementary angles equal the deficiencies.\n\n188 Chapter 5 Descartes follows his proposition with a simple corollary.\nKnowing the sum of the deficiencies of all the solid angles enables one to\ncalculate1 the sum of the plane angles of all the faces. If 5 denotes the\nnumber of solid angles then the sum of the plane angles is 45 — 8 right\nangles. The fact that there can be at most five regular polyhedra can be\nderived from this result as follows. Suppose that a polyhedron has 5 solid\nangles, each of which is surrounded by q faces, and that each face has p\nsides. Then the sum of the interior angles of each face is 2(p — 2) right\nangles and hence every plane angle measures 2b -2) . u right angles. V Since q\nplane angles come together at each solid angle, then1 are qS plane angles in\ntotal and their sum is 2Jp-2) . qS right angles. P The above corollary states\nthat the sum of the plane angles is 45 - 8 light angles so these two\nexpressions can be equated 4S-8 = ,5^0^ V and then solved for 5 to get 4p 5 =\n2{p + q) -pq The denominator of this fraction is equal to 4 — (p — 2)((/ — 2)\nfrom which it is clear that (p — 2){q — 2) must be less than four. As p and q\nmust both be integers greater than two, the five solutions for (p,q) are\n(3,3), the tetrahedron: (3,4), the octahedron; (3,5), the icosahedron; (4,3),\nthe cube; and (5,3), the dodecahedron. In contrast to Euclid's geometric proof\nthat there are at most five regular solids, this proof is essentially\nalgebraic in nature. We have calculated p and q. Descartes does not offer a\ncomplete proof in his manuscript, but notes that if a regular body has F faces\nand 5 solid angles then both 25-4 2F - 4 -^- and -^- must be integers, and\nthat this is possible only when 5 — 4, C, 8. 12 or 20 and F = 4, 8, 6, 20 or\n12 respectively. This sample of the results contained in De Solidorum\nElcmentis illustiates the originality of Descartes' approach to polyhedral\ngeometry. No-one befoie him had attempted to study polyhedra in general, and\nsome of his results weie still new to geometers when Leibniz's copy was\ndiscovered two centuries latei. Like\n\nThe announcement of Euler's formula 189 Kepler's work, this investigation by\nDescartes lay dormant for many vears and did not influence mathematical\nprogress. In the intervening period the theory of polyhedra developed in a\nquite different direction. The announcement of Euler's formula With the\nintroduction of printing in the fifteenth century access to information was\ngreatly increased. However, the market for mathematics books was limited and\nthey were expensive. Neither were books a suitable medium for the\ndissemination of new ideas as most results were too short. Even with the\nadvent of journals, supported by the rising academies and learned societies,\nit could take several years before a paper appeared in print. Thus\nmathematicians related their discoveries in letters to friends. Leonhard Euler\nand Christian Goldbach corresponded for many yeais. In a letter written in\nNovember, 1750 Euler told Goldbach that he had started to investigate\npolyhedra. He wanted to introduce some sort of order into the diversity of\nseemingly unrelated solids. He writes Recently it occurred to me to determine\nthe general properties of solids bounded by plane faces, because there is no\ndoubt that general theorems should be found for them, just as for plane\nrectilinear figures, whose properties are: (1) that in every plane figure the\nnumber of sides is equal to the number of angles, and (2) that the sum of all\nthe angles is equal to twice as many right angles as there are sides, less\nfour. Whereas for plane figures only sides and angles need to be considered,\nfor the case of solids more parts must be taken into account.'1 The parts\nwhich Euler considered to be important are: the faces and solid angles of the\npolyhedron, the plane angles and sides of its polygonal faces, and the joints\nwhere two faces come together meeting side against side. He could not find a\nterm which had been previously applied to this last kind of pai t so he chose\na name, the Latin word 'acies' meaning ridge or sharp edge. This allowed him\nto distinguish between the edges of the polyhedron and the sides of its faces.\nHe proceeded to describe how the numbers of these parts were related to one\nanother. Letting H be the number of faces (hedrae) S be the number of solid\nangles (angulorum solidorum) A be the number of edges (acies) L be the number\nof sides (latus) P be the number of plane angles (angulorum planorum)\n\n190 Chapter 5 he observed that In each face the number of sides equals the\nnumber of plane angles. Therefore L = P. Two sides meet at every edge so A =\nl/2L. So L (and hence P) is always an even number. Every face has at least\nthree sides so L ^ 3H. At least three faces surround each solid angle so L ^\n3S. Besides these rather obvious statements, Euler mentioned two furthoi\nrelationships which are far more fundamental. Firstly, S+H=A+2 and also The\nsum of all the plane angles equals 45 — 8 right angles. The second of these\ntwo statements had been previously recorded by Descartes but this was not\nknown at the time. The other relation was totally original and has become\nknown as Euler's formula (or his polyhedral formula, to distinguish it from\nother celebrated relationships he discovered). It is worth pausing at this\npoint to check some examples. Firstly, wv observe that Euler's formula holds\nfor all the Platonic solids. For instance, a cube has 6 faces, 8 solid angles,\nmaking a total of 14, and it has 12 edges. An icosahodron has 20 faces, 12\nsolid angles and 30 edges. As more general examples, there are the families of\npyramids and prisms. A pyramid with an n-sided base has (n+ 1) faces, (n+ 1)\nsolid angles and In edges. A prism with an n-sided base has (n + 2) faces and\nIn solid angles, making a total of 3n + 2, and it has 3n edges. An example\nwhich verifies the formula in a particular case is included in Euler's letter.\nHe goes on to derive some consequences of his relations, then remarks: I find\nit surprising that these general results in solid geometry have not previously\nbeen noticed by anyone, so far as I am aware; mid furthermore, that the\nimportant ones ■ ■ ■ are so difficult that I have not yet been able to prove\nthem in a satisfactory way.c A few weeks later Euler presented the first of\ntwo papers on his polyhedron formulae to the Saint Petersburg Academy. In it\nhe expanded the summarised account he had sent to Goldbach and verified that\nthe formula holds for several families of solids, but admitted that he could\nnot offer a proof of the general case. His proposed proof appeared in a second\npaper which he presented the following year.\n\nThe naming of parts 191 The naming of parts The crucial observation that\nenabled Euler to discover his formula was the isolation and labelling of the\nelements called edges. Prior to this, people had analysed polyhedra in terms\nof bases and solid angles in analogy with the sides and angles of polygons.\nYet Euler did more than merely find a name for something previously\nunlabelled. He needed to find a name because of his radically new way of\nbreaking down a polyhedron into its component parts—each of a different\ndimension. In his first paper he writes: Three kinds of bounds are to be\nconsidered in any solid body; namely points, lines and surfaces, or with the\nnames specifically used for this purpose: solid angles, edges and faces. These\nthree kinds of bounds completely determine the solid. But a plane figure has\nonly two kinds of bounds which determine it; namely points or angles, and\nlines or sidesJ These new elements are tactile, they are differences in\ntexture. If vou hold a model polyhedron you feel its flat faces, the ridges\nwhere they meet, and the sharp points at the corners. Although Euler created\nthe term 'edge' to distinguish the lines in the surface of a polyhedron from\nthe lines (sides) bounding its polygonal faces, he retained the term 'solid\nangle' giving it a new meaning. The term 'apex' had been used for the top of a\npyramid but there was no separate term for the tip of a solid angle. Adrien\nMarie Legendre continued in this vein using 'solid angle' to refer to the\npoints where three or more faces come together. Later French mathematicians\nintroduced the term 'sommet' (meaning summit). Perhaps this choice was\ninfluenced by Legendre's translation of 'acies' as 'arete' (meaning ridge of a\nmountain). The Englishman Arthur Cayley used both 'summit' and 'vertex'; the\nlatter has become the standard English name. The need to distinguish between\ndifferent sorts of vertices according to how many faces surrounded them\nproduced more terminology. Cayley wrote of 'trihedral summits' to describe\nvertices surrounded by three faces. In another context, in order to emphasise\nthe fact that three edges met at a vertex, he called them 'tripleural summits'\n(from the Greek work for rib). A different terminologv arose with the progress\nof molecular chemistry. By the middle of the nineteenth century chemists had\ndistinguished elements (containing a single kind of atom) from compounds\n(composed of atoms of several kinds), and it was clear that the constituent\nelements of a compound substance were combined in certain fixed proportions.\nBy comparing these ratios for many simple molecules the notion of valence\ndeveloped. This refers to the capacity for the atoms of an element to combine\nwith other atoms. Thus a carbon atom can\n\n192 Chapter 5 link to four other atoms, a hydrogen atom to just one. Various\nkinds ol diagrams were used to illustrate these relationships, but the most\nimportant of those were those introduced by Alexander Crum Brown (1838-1922).\nHis graphic notation quickly caught on as it neatly explained the phenomenon\nof chemical isomerism - - substances having the same composition but different\nproperties. The diagrams showed clearly that the same atoms could be linked in\ndifferent ways pioducing molecules with different shapes and structures (see\nFigure 5.6). (h) (h) (h) ®—(j)—(c^^^^h) (h) (h) (h) (h) (h) (h) ® (°h \"(c)\n(c>—® (h)(0)(h) Figure 5.6. Brown's molecular notation explained isomerism.\nThese diagrams were not only of interest to chemists but were also studied by\nmathematicians who were interested in finding the number of different isomers\nwith a given composition. These studies were part of the origins of graph\ntheory— the part of mathematics concerned with the study of networks or\ngraphs. The notion of valency is common to both chemistry and mathematics. To\na chemist, a carbon atom has valence four since it can make four bonds to\nother atoms. To a mathematician, a vertex has valence four if it is the\nendpoint of four edges. In general, a vertex is said to have valence n, or to\nbe n-valent, if it is the meeting point of n edges and, therefore, is\nsurrounded by n faces. Throughout this book the terms face, edge, vertex and\nvalence are used. (The term 'face' was favoured by the French writers and has\ncome to replace 'base'— the term inherited from the Greeks.) When symbols are\nrequired to expiess the quantities of these various elements, the traditional\npractice of using the initial\n\nConsequences of Euler's formula 193 letters of the words they represent will\nbe followed. This is, of couise. language dependent whence Euler's S, A, H for\nangulorum solidorum, acies and hcdrae, and the German E, K, F for Ecken\n(corners), Kanten (edges) and Flachen (faces). Using symbols corresponding to\nour chosen English terminology, Euler's foi inula is expressed V+F= E+2 or\nalternatively V-E+F=2 where the terms on the left-hand side are arranged in\norder of dimension. Consequences of Euler's formula Before examining some\nattempts to show that Euler's formula is valid ioi all polyhedra, some of its\nmany consequences will be derived. Using the Ycitices, Edges and Faces\nterminology, we write Euler's formula as V + F = E + 2. (A) Some of his other\nobservations can be combined and expressed as 2E ;> 3F (B) 2E ;> 3V. (C) One\nof the consequences of these formulae which Euler mentioned in his letter to\nGoldbach is that a polyhedron cannot have 7 edges. For suppose that there\nexists a polyhedron which has E = 7. Then relation (B) implies that 3F ^ 14.\nSince F is the number of faces, it must be an integer greater than 3,\ntheiefore F = 4. Similarly, from (C), 3V < 14 implies that V = 4. Now\nsubstituting \\' = 4, F = 4 and E = 7 into formula (A) produces a\ncontradiction: 4 + 4 ^ 7 + 2. The existence of this restriction raises the\nquestion of whether theie aie any other combinations of V, E and F for which\nthere is no corresponding polvhedron. Clearly F ^ 4, V ^ 4, F ^ 6 arc\nrestrictions, and now also E ^ 7 But can any other choice of V, E and F which\nsatisfies Euler's formula bo realised as the number of vertices, edges and\nfaces of some polyhedron? Is there, for example, a polyhedron which has 10\nfaces and 17 vertices? In fact theie is no such polyhedron: if such a\npolyhedron satisfied Euler's formula it would have 25 edges and these values\nof V and E do not satisfy relation (C). The relationships (A), (B) and (C)\nabove can be combined to produce restrictions on F and V. Multiplying (A) by\ntwo, and combining the result with (B) gives 2V + 2F = 2F + 4 ;> 3F + 4.\n\n194 Chapter 5 2V Simplifying produces -4 ^ F V > y2F + 2. Similarly, combining\ntwice (A) with (C) gives 2V + 2F = 2E + 4 ^ 3V + 4 or and thus 2F-4 > V. Euler\nknew both of these corollaries. On the left part of Figure 5.7 the two\ninequalities V ^ lfe F + 2 and V ^ 2F — 4 are shown graphically. The shaded\nregion indicates combinations of vertices and faces which are impossible. Each\nopen circle indicates a point which could correspond to a polyhedron. OOOO\nOOOOO OOOOO OOOOOO SMr t* fjfitfW 1 2 3 6 7 9 10 11 12 -*? Figure 5.7. There\nis, in fact, at least one polyhedron corresponding to each circle. To prove\nthis it is sufficient to construct a polyhedron having the required numbers of\nfaces and vertices for each point indicating a possibility. Firstly, observe\nthat any pyramid with a regular n-sided polygon as a base has (n + 1) faces,\n(n + 1) vertices and 2n edges. Therefore, there is a polyhedron corresponding\nto each circle on the line V — F. Polyhedra corresponding to the other circles\ncan be formed from these pyramids either by truncation or augmentation.\nTruncation. If a 3-valent vertex is truncated then the number of faces is\nincreased by one and the number of vertices by two. Every pyramid contains\n3-valent vertices, and the truncation process creates extra 3-valent vertices,\nso this procedure can be continued indefinitely.\n\nConsequences of Euler's formula 195 Augment at ion. A low triangular-based\npyramid can be erected on any triangular face so that the resulting polyhedron\nremains convex. This increases the number of faces by two and the number of\nvertices by one. This process can be applied to pyramids as they contain\ntriangular faces, and the process can be continued since it creates extra\ntriangular faces. Figure 5.8 shows the results of applying each of these\nprocesses to a hexagonal pyramid. On the right of Figure 5.7 the arrows\nindicate how to get from one polyhedron to another by truncation or\naugmentation. Examples of convex polyhedra covering all the possibilities can\nbe constructed. ■ augmented truncated Figure 5.8. The (F, V) coordinates can\nbe altered by augmenting or truncating a polyhedron. Two other consequences\nthat Euler knew are the following: A polyhedron must contain at least one\n3-sided, 4-sided or 5-sided face. A polyhedron must contain at least one\n3-valent, 4-valent or 5-valent vertex. In order to deduce these results more\neasily, two further relations will be derived from (A), (B) and (C) above.\nMultiplying (A) by three gives 3V + 3F = 3E + 6 and combining this with (C)\nproduces 2E + 3F > 3E + 6. Simplifying gives 3F-E > 6 A similar argument using\n(A) and (B) shows that 3V — E ^ 6.\n\n196 Chapter 5 To show that every polygon contains a 3-sided, 4-sided or\n5-sided face let. Fv be the number of faces of the polyhedron which have n\nsides. Thus F( is the number of triangular faces. Now, the total number of\nfaces is F = F3+ F4 + F5 +F6 + -•• + #, +••• and the total number of sides of\nall the polygons is 2E = 3F3 + 4F4 + 5F5 + 6F6 + --- + 11^, + ---. Doubling\nthe relation 3F — E ^ 6 and substituting these values for F and E gives\n6(F3+F4+F5+F6+---+F„ + ---) - (3F3+4F4+5F5+6Ffi + --- + r/.F„ + ---) > 12\\.\nThe left-hand side evaluates to 3F3 + 2F4 + F5 - F7 (n - 6)Fn • • • and since\nthis has to be positive (in fact at least twelve) at least one of the terms\nF:i, F4 or F5 must be non-zero. Thus there must be at least one 3-sided,\n1-sided or 5-sided face in a polyhedron. A similar calculation based on the\nnumbers of vertices of diffeient valence and using the relation 3V — E ^ 6\nyields the second result. ■ The fact that there are at most five regular\npolyhcdra can also be deiived from Euler's formula. To see this, suppose that\nevery face of a polyhedion has p sides. Then there are a total of pF sides\njoined in pairs to form edges. Thus pF = IE. Suppose also that every vertex is\ng-valent. Then, since each edge has two ends, qV — 2E. The values F = — and V\n= — P <1 can be substituted into Euler's formula to produce 2E 2E — + — = E +\n2. q p Solving for E gives 2pq E = 2{p + q) -pq This fraction has the same\ndenominator as the fraction derived eailiei in the chapter when we were\nlooking at regular polyhedra in the context of Descartes' theorem. The same\nargument shows that (p — 2)(q — 2) must be less than four, and hence the same\nsolutions for p and q are produced, corresponding to the five Platonic solids.\n\nEuler's proof 197 It is also possible to express F and V in terms of p and q:\n2(p + q)-pq 2(p + q)-pq' By substituting the allowed values for p and q into\nthese formulae, the number of faces and vertices of each solid can be\ncalculated. Euclid's and Descartes' enumerations of the Platonic solids rely\non the geometric properties of angles. This deduction from Euler's formula\nshows that there is a deeper reason why at most five regular bodies can be\nconstructed. No stage in the proof uses metric information. The faces are not\nassumed to be equilateral, or equiangular, or even congruent to each other.\nAll that is required is that they have the same number of sides. This,\ntogether with the requirement that all the vertices have the same valency, is\nsufficient. The fact that there are at most thirteen Archimedean solids can\nalso be derived from Euler's formula. These proofs do not, of necessity, imply\nthat all five regular and all thirteen Archimedean polyhedra exist, they\nmerely exclude any other possibilities. That all the allowable cases can be\nconstructed from equilateral, equiangular polygons seems miraculous. Euler's\nproof A year after announcing the discovery of his formula Euler proposed a\nproof of its validity. He described a method for removing sections of a\npolyhedron so that the number of vertices is reduced but so that the sum V — E\n+ F is unchanged. By repeating this process, Euler hoped that the number of\nvertices could be decreased until only four remained, in which case the\npolyhedron must be a tetrahedron. Since the sum V — E + F equals 2 for the\ntetrahedron and is unchanged by the truncation process, the original\npolyhedron must also have satisfied V - E + F = 2. To elaborate on this\nstrategy, the process of removing a vertex will be described, although, to\nsimplify the situation, it is assumed that all the faces meeting at the vertex\nare triangular. Let v0 be the vertex to be deleted and suppose that it is\nn-valent (Figure 5.9(a)). Let V\\, V2,---,vn be the n vertices connected to v0\nby edges of the polyhedron. To form the new polyhedron, remove vq and all the\nedges and faces connected to it. This leaves a (possibly skew) polygonal hole\nwith n sides (see Figure 5.9(b)). To form a closed polyhedron with plane\nfaces, (n — 3) edges are added across this skew polygon, namely those\nconnecting v\\ with t>3, «4, • • •, vn-i- The covering of the wound is\ncompleted with the addition of (n — 2) triangular faces which span the skew\npolygon and the new edges (see Figure 5.9(c)). The amputation of the vertex\nhas reduced V (the number of vertices) by one;\n\n198 Chapter 5 (a) (b) (c) Figure 5.9. Application of Euler's algorithm for\nremoving a vertex. the number of edges has been changed from E to E— n+(n —\n3), or more simply to E — 3; the number of faces has changed from F to F — n +\n(n — 2) or F — 2. Although each of V, E and F are altered during the process,\nthe sum V - E + F remains unchanged. If this procedure were valid in all\nsituations then Euler would have proved that his formula held for all\npolyhedra. However, in certain circumstances the object that remains after\ncutting off a vertex does not really qualify as a polyhedron. It is possible\nto get more than two faces meeting along an edge. A example is shown in Figure\n5.10: such a multiple edge is produced if the top vertex is removed.\nTechnically this is described by saying that Euler's algorithm does not stay\nwithin its class. This means that the end result of the process is not always\nthe same kind of object that was fed in at the beginning. In this case,\nvarious 'degenerate' polyhedra can result. Figure 5.10. Euler's algorithm can\nproduce degenerate results. Legend re's proof The first rigorous proof of\nEuler's formula was given by Adrien Marie Legendre (1752-1833) in his book\nElements de Geometrie published in 1794. This book\n\nLegendre's proof 199 was very popular, went through many editions, and was\ntranslated into several languages. Through its large circulation Euler's\nformula became widely known. Legendre's proof is based on the geometry of the\nsphere and, in particular, it makes use of the spherical excess formula for\nthe areas of spherical polygons. Before this can be applied, the polyhedron\nhas to be transformed into a network of polygons on a sphere. Suppose that a\nconvex polyhedron is made so that the interiors of all the faces are\ntransparent, but so the edges and vertices are opaque forming a kind of\nframework. Imagine this polyhedron placed inside a sphere so that the centre\nof the sphere lies inside the polyhedron. A light source at the centre of the\nsphere will cast shadows of the edges of the polyhedron onto the sphere. The\nlines on the sphere are shadows of straight line segments and will be arcs of\ngroat circles. They divide the sphere up into a network of spherical polygons\nwhich fit together in exactly the same way as the plane polygons in the\noriginal polyhedron. This method of producing a polyhedral network on a sphere\nfrom a given polyhedron is called radial projection. A radial projection of\nthe tetrahedron is shown in Figure 2.2. In order to prove that a polyhedron\nsatisfies Euler's formula, instead of considering the polyhedron itself,\nLegendre considered its radial projection onto a sphere. This polyhedral\nnetwork on the sphere will be the same as the original polyhedron in all the\nessential respects: it will have the same numbers of faces, edges and vertices\n(though these are now spherical polygons, arcs of gioat circles, and points\nwhere more than two such arcs meet, respectively) and these constituent parts\nwill be connected together in precisely the same way. Assume that the sphere\nhas radius one unit. Then its surface area is Air The surface area is also the\nsum of the areas of all the faces of the network. As each face is a spherical\npolygon, its area is equal to the sum of its angles minus (v — 2)n, where n is\nits number of sides. The sum of all these areas can be separated into three\nparts: (i) the sum of all the angles of all the spherical polygons. This must\nbe equal to 2nV since there is a contribution of 2n from each vertex. (ii) the\nsum of the numbers of sides of all the polygons is 2E, and each of these\ncontributes tt. (Hi) there is a contribution of 2n from each face. Expressed\nsymbolically this becomes y^ (area of spherical polygon) faces = ^2, ((angle\nsum) — (number of sides)7r + 27M faces\n\n200 Chapter 5 = ^2 (angle sum) — ^ (number of sides)n + y^ 2i\\ faces faces\nfac(\\s 2nV - 2En + F2n Thus the total area of the sphere equals 4ir and also\n2-kV — 27tE + 2ttF. Equating these two results and dividing through by 2n\ngives Euler's formula. ■ In 1810 Louis Poinsot pointed out that Legendre's\nproof applies not only to convex polyhedra but also to those non-convex\npolyhedra that can be radially projected onto a sphere such that each part of\nthe sphere is the image of a unique point in the polyhedron. This last\ncondition ensures that the projections of the faces do not overlap. Legendre's\nproof contrasts strongly with Euler's. Euler analyses the wav the various\nparts are connected together and makes combinatorial adjustments that leave V\n— E + F invariant. Legendre adapts the problem so that he can use the metric\nproperties of the sphere. At first sight this is surprising. The statement of\nEuler's formula includes only quantities of various elements; it makes no\nreference to geometric properties and does not prepare the reader for the\nintroduction of spherical geometry in order to establish its validity. Henri\nLebesgue commented: It is certain that when one has read \"Theorem: the numbers\nF, V, E of faces, vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron satisfy the\nrelation V + F = E + 2\" in the moments of reflection one takes before passing\non to the proof, one does not think of the formula for the area of a spherical\ntriangle.9 Although Legendre's proof is ingenious, there is an element of\nmystery about it. The demonstration is easily seen to be logically correct\nand, in this sense, it is clear. However, it does not explain the\nconclusion—the reasons for the truth of the theorem remain hidden. Euler's\nproof, even though it is incomplete, is much more in the spirit of the formula\nitself. Cauchy's proof A proof of Euler's formula that did not rely on metric\nproperties but on arguments concerning the way in which the constituent parts\nare combined together was given in 1813 by Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857).\nHe also introduced the important notion of deformability. His idea was to\nchoose one face of the polyhedron and then 'transport' the remaining faces so\nthat they formed a tessellation of polygons within this chosen face:\n\nCauchy's proof 201 Taking one of the faces as a base, and transporting onto\nthis face all the other vertices without changing their number, one obtains a\nplauai figure composed of several polygons enclosed in a given contour.1' The\nnumber of faces (bounded regions), edges and vertices of this plauai network\nwould then satisfy V + F = E + 1. Joseph Diaz Gergonne thought of this in the\nfollowing way. Imagine that one of the faces of a convex polyhedron is\ntransparent. If your eye were sufficiently close to this face you would be\nable to see the inside surfaces of all the othei faces. You could take a pen\nand trace over all the edges. The transparent face would then contain a\ntessellation of polygons fitted together in the same way as the polygons of\nthe original polyhedron. (This is reminiscent of the early explanations of\nperspective.) Cauchy seems to have thought in terms of continuously defoi ming\n(or deflating) the polyhedron so that it lies flat on a plane. What Cauchy\nactually proved is that, for any planar tessellation of polygons, V + F = E +\n1. He then deduced that polyhedra must satisfy Euler's formula. His\ndemonstration proceeds as follows. By adding diagonals to any non-triangular\nfaces, the planar network can be altered so that the resulting tessellation\ncontains only triangular faces. This modification does not alter the sum V — E\n+ F since if n diagonals are added across an (n + 3)-sided polygon, the number\nof edges increases by 77, and n extra faces are created. The aim now is to\nremove triangular faces from the boundary of the netwoik. and repeat the\nprocess until only a single face remains. An outermost tiiangle can have\neither one or two sides forming part of the boundary contour of the network.\nIn the first case, when the triangle is removed, one edge is also removed but\nthe number of vertices is unchanged (see Figure 5.11(a)). In the second case,\nthe removal of the face entails the deletion of two edges and one vortex from\nthe network (see Figure 5.11(b)). In both cases the sum V — E + F is\nunchanged. Faces can be removed in this way until there is a single face\nremaining, in which case all of its sides belong to the boundary contour. For\nthis last triangular face F = 1, E = 3 and V = 3 and so V — E + F = 1. Since\ndismembering the network has not altered the left-hand sum, this expression\nmust also hold tine of the original tessellation. ■ This proof was a\nsignificant advance for it showed that all polyhedra which can be deflated to\nlie flat after the removal of one face satisfy Euler's formula. What is less\nclear is that you must choose the triangles you delete with care Just as\nEuler's algorithm can lead to degenerate polyhedra, so Cauchy's algorithm can\nlead to 'bad'1 networks. However, the argument can be extended to cover these\ncases. Graphs with more than one block.\n\n202 Chapter 5 Exceptions which prove the rule At the same time that Cauchy was\ndeveloping his proof a Swiss mathematician was compiling a catalogue of\npolyhedra for which Euler's formula fails Simon Antoine Jean L'Huilier\n(1750-1840), professor of mathematics at the Geneva Academy, found three\ndifferent kinds of exceptional case. The first kind of exception can occur\nwhen two polyhedra are joined to form a larger one as when a small cube is\nplaced on top of a larger one, foi example. If the small cube is placed so\nthat none of its edges meet those of the huge cube then the new body will have\n11 faces—five from the small cube and six from the large one (Figure 5.12).\nAll the vertices and edges of the constituent cubes are also vertices and\nedges of the composite body. So for this polvhcdroii V - E + F = 16-24 + 11 =\n3. Solids of this kind can be found in natmally occurring crystals and\nL'Huilier acknowledges a friend who had allowed him to study his collection of\nminerals. A similar kind of exception occurs if a depiession is gouged out of\nthe centre of a face. A common housebrick is a solid body of this type, and it\ntoo satisfies V — E + F = 3. In fact, the sum V — E + F can be made as large\nas desired. L'Huilier gives the example of a tower of prisms piled up like a\nstep pyramid. If there are n prisms in the tower then the solid will have V —\nE + F = 1 + n. The same is true for the column on the right of Figuie 5.12.\nThe source of the discrepancy is the same for all of these exceptional\npolyhedra: they contain annular faces, that is, faces which have two separate\nholders. The polyhedra considered previously have not contained faces of this\nkind. L'Huilier also described a contrary situation where V — E + F can be\nmade as small as desired, not just zero, but negative. One example he gives is\nthe following. Let a prism be cut by a plane parallel to its base. Draw a\npolygon in this plane section which lies in the interior of the prism and\nwhose sides are parallel to the sides of the prism. Trapeziums can then be\nadded between the bases of the prism and this internal polygon (see Figure\n5.13). The resulting polyhedron can also (a) (b) Figure 5.11.\n\nExceptions which prove the rule 203 Figure 5.12. Counter-examples to Euler's\nformula. be thought of as a solid prism from which two truncated pyramids have\nbeen cut out. For this polyhedron V — E + F = 0. Other examples which exhibit\nthe same relationship between V, E and F can be constructed by removing a\nprism-shaped core from a dipyramid—rather like coring an apple. This time the\ndiscrepancies arise because there are tunnels through the polyhedron. If n\ntunnels are bored through a solid body then it will satisfy V — E + F = 2(1 —\nn). A third kind of exception occurs when the polyhedron has internal\ncavities. Such solids arise naturally when one crystal becomes encapsulated\nwithin another. For example, opaque lead sulphide crystals are sometimes found\nin translucent calcium flouride crystals. The translucent perimorphic part of\nthis double crystal is an example of a solid with a cavity. If both its\ninterior and exterior surfaces are regarded as cubic then, for this solid, V —\nE + F = 4. If a solid contains n internal cavities then V — E + F = 2(1 + n).\nThe different ways that the individual types of exception affect V — E + F can\nbe collected together and incorporated into one formula. If A denotes the\nnumber of annular faces, T the number of tunnels, and C the number of cavities\nin a polyhedron then V-E + F = 2 + A-2T + 2C. More or less complete versions\nof this formula were discovered and rediscovered many times over during the\ncourse of the nineteenth century. Besides highlighting these exceptions to\nEuler's formula, L'Huilier also gave a proof that it holds for convex\npolyhedra. He did this by adding a vertex in the centre of the polyhedron and\nthen regarding the solid as being composed of pyramids, each with its apex in\nthe centre and a face of the polyhedron as a base (see Figure 5.14). He then\nshowed that the formula holds for pyramids and is still valid when they are\nglued together to form the original polyhedron. Another example of a\npolyhedron which fails to satisfy Euler's formula is Kepler's 'larger\nicosahedral hedgehog'—the small stellated dodecahedron. For this pentagram-\nfaced polyhedron F=12, V = 12 and E = 30, and therefore\n\n204 Chapter 5 Figure 5.13. L'Huilier's polyhedral torus. V — E + F = —6. This\nwas pointed out (in 1810) by Poinsot, who rediscovered Kepler's pair of star\npolyhedra along with two more. Of these four self-intersecting polyhedra, two\nsatisfy Euler's formula and two fail. Of course, it is only when Kepler's\npolyhedron is thought of as having pentagram faces that the discrepancy\noccurs. If it is regarded as a solid body whose surface consists of 60\ntriangular faces then there is no disagreement with the formula. In the 1830's\nfurther counter-examples to Euler's formula were recorded by the mineralogist\nJohann Friedrich Christian Hessel. He had observed double crystals and so\nreproduced L'Huilier's example of polyhedra with internal cavities. (It was\nHessel who gave the specific example of a compound mineral cited above.) He\nalso found two other kinds of exception which have no tunnels, no cavities and\nno annular faces, and yet still fail to satisfy the formula. Examples can be\nformed by joining two pyramids together either edge to edge, or vertex to\nvertex (see Figure 5.15). The first of these counter-examples contains an edge\nwhich is a side of more than two faces. It is the possible production of this\nkind of solid Figure 5.14. L'Huilier proved Euler's formula by building up\npolyhedra from pyramids.\n\nWhat is a polyhedron? 205 (a) (b) Figure 5.15. Hessel's counter-examples to\nEuler's formula. that invalidates Euler's proof and it seems sensible to\nexclude such things from consideration. So, for a solid to be classed as a\npolyhedron we could stipulate that exactly two faces must meet at every edge.\nWhat about the second of Hessel's counter-examples—should it be classed as a\npolyhedron? And if not, why not? Several of the beautiful polyhedral forms\ndisplayed in the stellations of the icosahedron (Chapter 7) are connected in\nthis way. Should all the exceptions be ruled out as 'improper' polyhedra? Or\ndoes the fact that Euler's formula can be generalised to cope with objects\nhaving cavities and tunnels mean that these more general objects are examples\nof polyhedra? If so, then our notion of polyhedron has certainly stretched a\nbit. It is in this state of uncertainty that we realise we have been using\n'polyhedron' as an undefined, or at best ill-defined, term! What is a\npolyhedron? \"When I use a word\" Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone,\n\"it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less\". \"The question\nis\", said Alice, \"whether you can make words mean so many different things\".1\nLewis Carroll At different times, to different people, the word 'polyhedron'\nhas conjured up a wide variety of images, some of which are incompatible with\neach other. It is not unknown for the same person to use different\ninterpretations on different occasions. It is the lack of a precise definition\nwhich led to the misunderstandings about the domain of validity of Euler's\nformula. The list of exceptional cases which fail to satisfy it highlighted\nthe problem. Some people regarded such examples as 'pathological'—deliberate\nattempts at sabotage, created with malicious intent to discredit a theorem.\nThe exceptions were ignored, hushed up, or dismissed as being weird creations\nto which the theorem was obviously never intended to apply.\n\n206 Chapter 5 It is probably true that the formula holds for everything that\nEulei had in mind at the time he discovered it. The Greeks, and most\nmathematicians after them, restricted their attention to convex polyhedra.\nEven after the Renaissance artists had produced a wide diversity of non-convex\npolyhedral foims. mathematicians still concentrated on convexity. Many of the\nproofs of the validitv of the formula assume, either implicitly or explicitly,\nthat all polyhedia aie convex. Traditionally this was the case, but later it\nwas recognised that some of the proofs applied to some concave polyhedra as\nwell. It became apparent that Euler's formula did not depend on convexity, but\ncorresponded to something more fundamental. Trying to discern the essential\ningredient upon which the all-encompassing proof would rely was not easy as\nthe appropriate concepts had yet to be developed. Writing in 1858 Poinsot\nnoted: What makes the theory of polyhedra very difficult is that it requires\nan essentially new science, which may be called 'geometry of position' because\nits principal concern is not the size or proportion of figures, but the order\nand [relative] position of the elements composing thorn.1 And indeed a new\ndiscipline was born out of the struggle to find the foundations on which the\nformula rested —a discipline related to geometry as algebra is i elated to\narithmetic. It concentrates on the relationships and connections between the\nvarious constituent elements; specific details such as size, area, angles, and\nin fact all metric properties are ignored, just as algebraic equations express\ngeneral relationships between numbers but do not deal with particular cases.\nOiiginally called analysis situs (geornetrie de situation in French, Geometric\ndcr haqc in German), Johann Benedict Listing coined the name topology—the name\nbv which this new geometry is now known. An important step in the creation of\ntopology, and one which gieatlv contributed to a resolution of the Euler\nformula puzzle, was the paradigm transition from solids to hollow shells. For\nmany centuries, 'polyhedron' was synonymous with 'convex solid'. Euclid\noccasionally used the term 'polyhedron'. Foi example, in book XII, proposition\n17 he constructs a polyhedral solid whose surface lies between two concentric\nspheres. We met an example as Campanus' sphere in Chapter 3. But he does not\ndefine the term, leaving its meaning to be abstiacted from the particular\ncases he does describe. More often, he used the term 'solid figure'. Later\nauthors also refei to \"solid bodies' when writing about polyhedra. We still\ntalk of Platonic and Archimedean solids even though our models are usually\nhollow. Descartes and L'Huiliei viewed the study of polyhedra as part of solid\ngeometry. Legendre defines a polyhedron to be a solid whose surface consists\nof polygonal faces. In contrast, otheis have thought a polyhedron to be the\nsurface itself. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries artists began to\nconcentiate on\n\nWhat is a polyhedron? 207 the surfaces containing objects, and broke them down\ninto planar pieces to assist with their perspective constructions. Albrecht\nDiirer carried this fuithor and created nets which close up to form polyhedral\nsurfaces. Kepler considered the ways that polygons can be fitted together to\nform tessellations of the plane and 'congruences in space'. He probably made\nmodels in this way reinforcing his mental image of a hollow surface. His star-\nfaced polyhedra can only be understood as surfaces that pass through\nthemselves. Cauchy certainly regarded polvhedra as surfaces composed of\npolygons. Deforming, or deflating, a polyhedron to lie flat in a plane cannot\nbe performed on a solid. In a later paper, Cauchv analysed collections of\nrigid polygons joined by hinged edges—an idea abstracted from paper models,\nperhaps. Cauchy viewed polyhedra as more than just a surface, he saw a\npotentially flexible, deformable surface (though not yet the 'rubber sheet'\nmade up of undulating faces with curved edges—this did not appear until the\n1860's). Euler, too, recognised that it was the surface of the solid that was\nimportant: The consideration of solid bodies therefore must be directed to\ntheir boundary; for when the boundary which encloses a solid body on all sides\nis known, that solid is known.k After Cauchy's proof appeared, attention\nshifted from solids to the consideration of surfaces. Consequently, the notion\nof cavity no longer applied. In the example of the double crystal, although\nthe outer part is a single solid, its boundary consists of two distinct\npieces. Each part of its disconnected surface satisfies Euler's formula. By\nconcentrating on connected surfaces (those1 in one piece), cavities ceased to\nbe of interest and were forgotten. Solids with tunnels presented more of a\nproblem. It does not make; sense to speak of tunnels running through a\nsurface, and the notion of tunnels through a solid had to be translated into\nan analogous concept applicable to surfaces. Yet even the notion of tunnels is\nunclear, for if tunnels are branched, how should they be counted? Before\ntrying to count tunnels, it would be useful to be able to detect them—to know\nwhether there are any tunnels at all. Reinhold Hoppe described the essential\ncharacteristic of a tunnel: Let the polyhedron be of some stuff that is easy\nto cut like soft clay, let a thread be pulled through the tunnel and then\nthrough the clay. It will not fall apart.1 If there are no tunnels through a\nsolid then every cut separates it into two pieces. The idea of cutting up a\npolyhedron applies equally to solids and surface's: you cut through a solid,\nor along a curve in a surface. A closed curve in a surface1 is called non-\nseparating if the surface remains in one piece when the curve1 is cut. Some\nsurfaces possess non-separating curves, in others every curve sepai ate«s the\n\n208 Chapter 5 surface into two pieces. Non-separating curves on a surface\ncorrespond to tunnels through a solid, and Hoppe defined the number of tunnels\nas the maximum number of cuts which leave the surface connected. Although\nannular faces were incorporated into formulae for many years, in the end they,\nlike cavities, were discarded. Faces of the conventional kind could be\nidentified in several ways. Firstly, there are curves on an annular face, both\nof whose ends are on the boundary of the face, which do not separate it. If\nthe curve is cut, the face remains in one piece. In a conventional face all\nsuch curves separate it. Alternatively, conventional faces have a single\nboundary contour whereas annular faces have two disconnected boundaries. From\nthis viewpoint excluding annuli is analogous to excluding cavities: the\nboundary of the solid and the boundaries of all its faces must be connected.\nSome of the properties of polyhedral solids have now been recast and\nidentified with equivalent properties of polyhedral surfaces: tunnels\ncorrespond to non- separating curves, cavities to disconnected surfaces. Yet\nthe original problem remains unresolved—What is a polyhedron? August Ferdinand\nMobius' answer to this question appears in an 1865 paper, the same one in\nwhich he described his famous one-sided strip.2 He attempted to preclude the\nproblematic polyhedra with the following definition: A polyhedron is a system\nof polygons arranged in such a way that (i) The sides of exactly two polygons\nmeet at every edge. (ii) It is possible to travel from the interior of one\npolygon to the interior of any other without passing through a vertex. To\nMobius, a polyhedron is a surface composed of polygons; the second condition\nensures that the surface is connected. Moreover, Mobius has tried to exclude\nsingularities (places where the surface pinches together) of the kind seen in\nHes- sel's counter-examples. This marks a considerable change in emphasis horn\nthe 'flat-faced solid' sort of definition in common use 50 years before. If\none were introduced to polyhedra for the first time through this definition it\nis probable that the second of Mobius two conditions would appeal contrived or\nirrelevant. It is difficult to imagine what purpose such a restriction could\nserve unless one can think of objects that fail to satisfy it. The motivation\nbehind it is to exclude singular vertices—those of the form shown in Figure\n5.15(b). Despite good intentions, however, this kind of behaviour can still\nslip through the net: the 'croissant'-shaped polyhedron shown in Figure 5.16\nsatisfies Mobius definition. This illustrates the difficulty involved in\ntrying to achieve precision in definitions. 2From entries in his diary we know\nthat he had discovered the 'Mobius strip' as caily as 1858. J. B. Listing also\ndiscovered it independently around the same time.\n\nWhat is a polyhedron? 209 Figure 5.16. A polyhedral croissant. Actually,\nMobius' definition is almost complete. The 'croissant' has crept in because\ncondition (ii) refers to the complete polyhedron. The problem is cured by\nmodifying the definition so that it applies locally to each vertex, not\nglobally to the polyhedron as a whole. We can now give a full answer to the\nquestion at hand. Definition. A polyhedron is the union of a finite set of\npolygons such that (i) Any pair of polygons meet only at their sides or\ncorners. (ii) Each side of each polygon meets exactly one other polygon along\nan edge. (Hi) It is possible to travel from the interior of any polygon to the\ninterior of any other. (iv) Let V be any vertex and let F1; F2, • • •, Fn be\nthe n polygons which meet at V. It is possible to travel over the polygons F*\nfrom one to any other without passing through V. In this context, polygon\nmeans a planar figure bounded by straight lines that is topologically\nequivalent to a disc. The restriction excludes the star polygons used by\nKepler and polygons such as annuli whose boundaries are not connected. The\nfirst condition excludes star polyhedra of the kind described by Poinsot (see\nChapter 7) and other self-intersecting polyhedra. Conditions (ii) and (iv)\nexclude singular edges and vertices, and condition (Hi) ensures that the\npolyhedron is connected. Of the five original sources of counter-examples to\nEuler's formula—cavities, annular faces, tunnels, self-intersections, and\nsingularities— only one remains: a polyhedral surface can have tunnels. With\n'polyhedron' now well defined, Euler's formula can be seen to depend only on\nthe type (or genus) of the polyhedral surface. L'Huilier's version of the\nformula can be revised to give the following. If a polyhedral surface has T\ntunnels\n\n210 Chapter 5 then V-E + F = 2-2T. The observation that the number V — E + F\ndoes not depend on the particular polyhedron, only on the topological type of\nthe underlying surface, was the starting point for Listing's investigations.\nHis extensive study was very influential and helped to set topology on course\nas an independent and valuable branch of mathematics. Von Staudt's proof The\nsearch for understanding that surrounded Euler's formula focused attention on\nseveral concepts, notably convexity and connectedness (the number of tunnels).\nThe former is a geometric property and is peripheral to the point of being a\ndiversion; the latter is a topological notion and lies at the heart of the\nproblem. The importance of connectedness and its relevance to the Euler\nformula was first explained by Karl Georg Christian von Staudt (1798-1867) in\nhis book Geometric der Lage published in 1847. His proof is very illuminating\n- an example of what mathematicians consider a good proof. It does not merely\ndemonstrate that a theorem is true, but shows why it is true without\nintroducing any extraneous ideas. The equation V + F = E + 2 describes how the\nquantities of various constituent parts of a polyhedral surface are related.\nSince metric properties aie not mentioned, they should be avoided in a proof.\nLegendre's use of spherical geometry and the areas of spherical polygons\nintroduces ideas which are completely foreign to those used to state the\ntheorem. Furthermore, the scope of his proof is limited by the need to\nradially project the polyhedron on to a sphere. Various kinds of limitation\nfeature in the many proofs of Eulei's formula. These ought to be reflected in\nrestrictions on the type of objects which satisfy the hypothesis of the\ntheorem, but the ambiguity in the term 'polyhedron1 allowed each writer to\nchoose a convenient interpretation in his individual circumstances, often\nsubconsciously. Even though the theorem statement usually read 'the number of\nfaces plus the number of vertices of a polyhedron exceeds by two the number of\nedges' the proofs that followed were not all attempts to demonstrate the same\ntheorem. The following proof does not suffer from these deficiencies. The\nhypotheses of the theorem state necessary and sufficient conditions on the\npolyhedron for the formula to be satisfied, and as a consequence of the proof,\nthe foundations of the theorem become clear: the polyhedron must be\n'spherical'.

Then P satisfies Euler's formula: V + F = E + 2. PROOF: The\nargument proceeds by dividing the edges of the polyhedron into two kinds and\ncounting the number of each sort. To keep a record of which edges have been\ncounted we can imagine colouring them in two colours. (In fact, the reader may\nfind it helpful to carry out the steps involved in the proof on a model of a\ndodecahedron.) Suppose we colour an edge of P red, say. (In actual fact, since\nedges aie lines which have no thickness, we colour a small sausage-like region\naround the edge—see Figure 5.17.) The two vertices at its ends will also have\nbeen coloured red. Choose another edge which has a red vertex at one end and\nan lmcoloured vertex at the other end, and colour this edge red as well.\nProceed in this fashion until no more edges can be added. Figure 5.17. When\nthis colouring process has stopped, all the vertices will have been coloured\nred. For, if some vertex remains uncoloured then, by hypothesis (z), there is\na path of edges which connects this vertex to a red vertex and the number of\nred edges can be increased by colouring this path. Therefore, when the process\nterminates, every uncoloured edge has a red vertex at both ends. We now\ndetermine the number of edges that have been coloured so far. When the first\nedge was coloured, two vertices were also coloured. In colouring every\nsubsequent edge only one extra vertex was coloured. Since all the vertices are\ncoloured, the number of coloured edges must be one less than the number of\nvertices. The uncoloured portion of the polyhedron is formed from the\ninteriors of all the faces and the uncoloured edges. Suppose that this\nuncoloured part is not\n\n212 Chapter 5 connected. Then there must be a loop of red edges separating it\ninto at least two distinct pieces. But in order to complete a loop of red\nedges, the edge between two previously coloured vertices must be coloured red,\nand this was not allowed. Hence the uncoloured piece must be connected. To\nexamine the structure of the uncoloured part of the polyhedron we can colour\neach face green (say) in turn. To do this, we choose any face and colour its\ninterior and any of its sides which are uncoloured edges of P. Then choose an\nuncoloured face which has exactly one green side and colour it green.\nProceeding in this way, we continue to enlarge the area of green until no more\nfaces can be coloured—either because all faces are green, or because the\nuncoloured face's have more than one green side. Suppose that the second case\noccurs, that is, that an uncoloured face meets two or more green faces. Then\nthere would be a closed curve running through this face and through the green\nregion that did not cross any red edges, and which had vertices lying on both\nsides of it. By hypothesis (ii), this means that the curve separates the\nvertices into two disconnected sets. However, all the vertices are part of the\nred region of P which is connected, giving a contradiction. Therefore, the\nonly other possibility is that all the faces have been coloured. From the\nmethod used to colour the faces, we can see that the number of green edges\nmust be one less than the number of faces since the colouring of every face\nexcept the first adds a green edge. Let V be the number of vertices and F the\nnumber of faces of P Let En and Eq be the numbers of red and green edges\nrespectively. Then we have shown that ER = V -I and EG = F - 1. If E denotes\nthe total number of edges of P then E = ER + EG = (V-1) + (F-1) = V + F-2 and\nhence E + 2 = V + F. m In the course of the preceding proof, we have divided\nthe polyhedron into two parts by colouring it red and green. Both of these\nparts are connected and have a single boundary contour—the line where red and\ngreen meet. This means that both parts can be deformed into discs. The surface\nformed by gluing two discs together along their perimeters is a sphere, so the\npolyhedron can be deformed into a sphere. On the polyhedron itself the two\n'discs' will be interleaved in a complex pattern. A tennis ball provides a\nsimpler example of a sphere foimed from two interleaved (topological) discs.\n\nComplementary viewpoints 213 If a polyhedron satisfies Euler's formula it can\nbe deformed into a spline. The converse is also true: if a polyhedron can be\ndeformed into a sphere then it satisfies Euler's formula. One way to prove\nthis is to show that such polyhedra satisfy conditions (i) and (ii) of the\nprevious theorem. That this is so is a consequence of the famous Jordan Curve\nTheorem, one of the first results in topology, which states that a closed\ncurve in a plane separates it into two pieces. In light, of this, the first\ncondition also holds since the definition of 'polyhedron' being used excludes\nannular faces. Alternatively, the attempted proof given by Euler can be\nreinterpreted in the context of polyhedral surfaces in which case it is seen\nto be valid. Problem. Construct your own proof of Euler's formula by applying\nhis ideas to networks on a sphere. An outline of the stages involved in such a\nproof is as follows. (1) Assume the polyhedral surface can be deformed into a\nnetwork on a sphere. (2) Show the network can be triangulated without altering\nV — E + F. (3) Show how to reduce the number of vertices in the network so\nthat the result is still triangulated and V — E + F is unchanged. (4) Reduce\nthe number of vertices to four and show that the formula holds in this case.\n(5) Deduce that the formula holds for the original polyhedron. (f) Euler's\nformula shows no preference for either V or F, they are both of an equal\nstatus and the formula is symmetric in these two quantities. However, in many\nattempts to prove the validity of the formula this intrinsic symmetry is\nneglected and therefore is unexplained. Euler concentrated on reducing the\nnumber of vertices, while Cauchy chose to remove faces. When viewed as a\nforniula about networks on smooth surfaces, von Staudt's proof can be phrased\nso that the origin of this symmetry becomes clear. In this setting the red\nregion is seen to be a neighbourhood of a spanning tree of the edge-network,\nand the green legion is a neighbourhood of the complementary tree spanning the\n(combinatorial) dual network. Complementary viewpoints Although Descartes'\ntheorem and Euler's formula appear to be concerned with different aspects of\npolyhedral geometry and topology, they are in fact inten elated in a very\nstrong way: they are logically equivalent and can be derived from one another.\n\n214 Chapter 5 Many people have observed that Euler's formula arises as a\nsimple consequence of combining two statements in Descartes' manuscript: There\nare always twice as many plane angles as sides [edges] on the surface of a\nsolid body for one side [edge] is always common to two faces. I always take a\nfor the number of solid angles and (j> for the number of faces. • • ■ The\nactual number of plane angles is 2<f> \\+ 2ct — 4.m This has led some to\nconclude that Descartes was aware of Euler's formula. However, Descartes\nhimself does not seem to have connected the two statements. He did not possess\nthe requisite concepts to see the benefit of doing so. Leibniz also failed to\nsee any connection when he copied the manuscript. Conversely, Euler did not\nnotice Descartes' theorem, nor did any of his successors so that it was still\nunknown to geometers when the Leibniz' manuscript was unearthed. It is as\nthough the same coin were being viewed from opposite sides: Descartes,\napproaching polyhedra with the classical concepts of faces and solid angles,\nderived metrical properties by analogy with polygons; Euler, gaining\ninformation by scientific induction (observing many particular instances and\nextrapolating to polyhedra in general), produced topological results. People\nsometimes state that they find it surprising that Euler's formula was unknown\nto the Greeks. (Some even assert that Archimedes was aware of it, but any\nevidence would have been destroyed in the fire at Alexandria.) I find this\nextremely improbable since they, like Descartes, were not in possession of\ntopological concepts. A more likely person to have discovered the formula\nbefore Euler is Kepler. He thought of polyhedra as surfaces, he produced\nstellations by extending their edges, and he had an obsession for finding\nrelationships between things. However, there is no reason to suppose that he\nwas familiar with Euler's formula. Neither Descartes' theorem nor Euler's\nformula is easy to establish directly. However, to show that they are\nlogically equivalent is straightforward. The sum of all the plane angles of a\npolyhedron can be found by adding up all the interior angles of the faces. The\nsum of the interior angles of a face with n sides is (n — 2)ir radians. So sum\nof the plane angles = ^ (interior angle sum) faces = ^2 ((number of sides)7r —\n2-kj. faces\n\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem 215 Since the sum of the numbers of sides of all the\nfaces is twice the number of edges, this equals 2Ett-F2tt. The sum of the\nplane angles can also be expressed in terms of the deficiencies of all the\nsolid angles: sum of the plane angles = ^ (2tt — (deficiency) J vertices =\nV2-k — ^2 (deficiency). vertices Equating these two expressions shows that the\nsum of all the deficiencies of the solid angles equals 2ir(V — E + F): J2\n(deficiency) = 2tt(V-E + F). vertices Now, if it is known that a polyhedron\nhas V — E + F = 2 (so that it satisfies Euler's formula) then, by applying the\nabove equality, it must also have the sum of its deficiencies equal to 2ir • 2\nwhich is 47r, and hence the polyhedron satisfies Descartes' theorem.\nConversely, if it is known that a given polyhedron obeys Descartes' theorem\nthen it must also satisfy Euler's formula. The two results are completely\ninterdependent. Furthermore, the argument which shows this equivalence does\nnot require any restriction on the topological type of the polyhedron—it can\nbe convex, concave, or have tunnels. If the concept of the deficiency of a\nvertex is interpreted in a more general context which allows negative\ndeficiencies when the angle sum is greater than 2-k radians then the\nrelationship between the Euler number V — E + F and the total deficiency still\nholds. This is closely related to a celebrated result in differential\ngeometry—a branch of mathematics in which smooth surfaces (rather than\npolyhedral ones) are studied. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem In 1827 Karl Friedrich\nGauss (1777-1855) introduced the idea that a smooth (differentiable) surface\nhas an intrinsic geometry. This geometry is based on measuring the lengths of\narcs in the surface, and from arclength other geometric notions such as angles\nand area can be defined. Having the notion of arclength also means that\nshortest curves, or geodesies, can be considered. In the plane the geodesies\nare straight line segments; on a sphere the geodesies are arcs of great\ncircles. The shape and local properties of a surface affect its geometry. We\nencountered an example of this earlier in the chapter: the interior angle sum\nof a triangle\n\n\n216 Chapter 5 depends on the surface it sits in. That the sum of the interior\nangles of a spherical polygon should be related to its area may have seemed\npuzzling. After all, basic dimension analysis suggests that something is amiss\nsince area is a two- dimensional quantity whereas angles are one-dimensional.\nIn fact, the angles of a polygon are related to its area in almost all\ngeometric surfaces. It is onlv because the most familiar geometry is done on a\nflat plane that the idea seems strange. Gauss introduced a precise measure of\nthe curvature, or non-planaiity, of a surface. Since a surface can be flatter\nat some points than at others, this curvature is defined for each point on the\nsurface, and can vary from place to place on the surface. For a plane it takes\nthe value zero at every point; for the sphere, every point has positive\ncurvature. There is also another kind of curvature known as geodesic\ncurvature, which applies to lines in a surface. It measures how much the line\ndeviates from being a geodesic. When the line is a geodesic, its geodesic\ncurvature is zero. Now suppose that we have a polygon P sitting in a smooth\ngeometric surface, each of whose sides is a smooth curve. The exterior angles\nof this polygon can be defined at each corner. For a conventional planar\npolygon, the sum of the exterior angles is 2ir. This is a measure of the total\nangle one turns through when traversing the boundary of the polygon. For\npolygons in non-planar surfaces, it is not only the exterior angles which\ncontribute to this total angle—the bending or turning of the sides of the\npolygon has to be taken into account, as does the curvature of the surface\nitself since it affects the amount of turn on each side of P. All this\ninformation is collected together in the Gauss- Bonnet Formula: y^ (exterior\nangle) +/ kg ds + Ik dA = 2n. corners or p The first term in this expression\nis the sum of the exterior angles. The second term measures the curvature on\nthe sides of the polygon P: k(J stands for geodesic- curvature, and since this\nis a continuous rather than a discrete quantity, summation is replaced by\nintegration with respect to arclength, ds. The third term takes into account\nthe curvature of the surface itself: k is the Gaussian curvature and it is\nintegrated over the area (dA) of the polygon. Two examples will help to\nclarify this. If the polygon is bounded bv geodesies then kg = 0 and the\nmiddle term is zero. If the polygon is planar then the Gaussian curvature is\nalso zero and we have the statement that, for planar polygons bounded by\nstraight lines, y^ (exterior angle) + 0 + 0 = 2ir. corners of p If the polygon\nis on a sphere of unit radius then the Gaussian curvature /,- = 1\n\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem 217 and the third term equals the area of the\npolygon: k dA = area of P. Jr If the polygon is bounded by arcs of great\ncircles then, again, kq is zeio. Rearranging the order of the terms in the\nGauss-Bonnet formula gives area of P — 2tt — ^ (exterior angle). corners of p\nRewriting this in terms of the interior angles of the polygon rather than its\nexterior angles produces area of P = 2n — ^ (n — interior angle). corners of p\nIf P is a polygon with n sides, and therefore n corners, then this equals area\nof P = ^ (interior angle) — (n — 2)tt corners of p which is the spherical\nexcess formula for the area of a spherical polygon with v, sides. By covering\na geometric surface with a network of polygons, and adding up their individual\ncontributions to get the total area (rather like Legendre did) it is possible\nto derive the Gauss—Bonnet Theorem. Suppose that a connected network on a\nsmooth surface S has V vertices, E edges and F faces. Then k dA = 2tt {V - E +\nF) m This theorem is truly amazing. It defies our intuition. For on the left-\nhand side is a quantity defined completely in terms of the intrinsic geometiv\nof the surface: curvature is a metric property. Yet on the right-hand side is\nan expression which is completely independent of any metrical information: the\nnetwork is purely topological. This paradoxical situation reflects the\ninterrelation between Descartes' and Euler's theorems. Choosing a fixed\nnetwork and altering the geometry of the surface shows that the total\ncurvature is independent of the geometry. Conversely, fixing the surface and\nvarying the network shows that V — E + F does not depend on the network\nchosen—yet another deiivation of Euler's formula. .\n\n:s . * Augustin Louis Cauchy (1821)\n\n219 Equality, Rigidity Q) and Flexibility Euclid's \"principle of\nsuperposition\" ■ ■ ■ raises the question of whether a figure can be moved\nwithout changing its internal structure.11 H. S. M. Coxcter When are two\npolyhedra the same? At first glance this question appears straightforward\nenough. Two things are the same when no observation can distinguish between\nthem. To show that two polyhedra are different it is sufficient to find a\nproperty of one not possessed by the other. This may be something easily\ndetermined such as the number of square faces, for example, or it may involve\nthe way that the faces are arranged. However, this is not a general solution\nto the problem. Even though it may be easy to find differences, what kinds of\nproperties should we allow ourselves to use in order to distinguish between\ntwo polyhedra? Is it only the combinatorial properties of polyhedra which need\nto be taken into account, or do metric properties matter as well? Are size, or\nposition, or orientation in space relevant? A definition that tells you\nwhether or not two objects are thought of as the same is called an equivalence\nrelation. The definition of equivalence lists the properties which are to be\nregarded as important. These can be anything. For example, polyhedra which\nhave the same number of faces can be defined to be equivalent. When you have\nan equivalence relation defined on a collection of objects, you can classify\nthem into sets so that all the items belonging to one class are equivalent,\nand things from separate classes are different. In some contexts we might want\na fairly coarse equivalence relation which regards only a few properties as\nrelevant and which leads to large equivalence classes. For example, a\ntopologist interested only in combinatorial properties would like any prism on\na quadrilateral\n\n220 Chapter 6 base to be considered equivalent to a cube. A crystallographer,\non the othei hand, would need to retain the geometric information. The\nquestion 'When are two polyhedra the same?' is a request for an equivalence\nrelation to be defined on the set of polyhedra. It is the goal of this chapter\nto find one. However, we are not merely searching for a relation which is\nconvenient for some people some of the time, but one which matches oui\nintuitive notion of when polyhedra are 'the same'. Disputed foundations The\nproblem of how to define equality for polyhedra has a long history. Early\nreferences occur in Euclid's definitions in the Elements. The first appears in\nhis list of basic premises: axiom 4 states Things which coincide are equal.\nThis axiom is the basis of proofs which use superposition arguments. These are\nderived from the experience (direct or imagined) of drawing two figures on a\npiece of paper, cutting round one of them and placing it directly over the\nothei. This method of proof is used in the very first theorem in the Elements.\nAfter three propositions which describe constructions, proposition 4 of book I\nstates a general result about triangles: If the two sides and the included\nangle of a triangle are equal respectively to two sides and the included angle\nof a second triangle then the two triangles are equal in all particulars. In\nhis Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements Proclus describes the\nideas that lie behind the proof: The proof of this theorem, as anyone can see,\ndepends entirely on the common notions [axioms] and grows naturally out of the\nvery clarity of the hypotheses. Because two sides are equal respectively to\ntwo sides, they coincide with one another; and because the angles contained by\nthese sides are equal, they also coincide. Since the angle coincides with the\nangle and the sides with the sides, the lower extremities of the sides also\ncoincide; and if they coincide, the base coincides with the base; and if three\nsides coincide with three sides, so does the triangle with the triangle and\neverything with everything. Visible equality, therefore, in things of the same\nform is manifestly the ground of the entire proof.6 Note that besides using\nthe axiom that things which coincide are equal, the discussion also supposes\nthe converse: things which are equal can be made to coincide.\n\nDisputed foundations 221 Even in Euclid's time, there was an unease about the\nfourth axiom and its connotations. Euclid himself rarely made use of\nsuperposition arguments if he could avoid them. The unease was still felt 2000\nyears later. In 1844, the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer remarked that he was\nsurprised mathematicians attacked the parallel postulate rather than the axiom\nthat figures which coincide are equal. For, either coincident figures are\nautomatically identical or equal, and hence no axiom is required; or else\ncoincidence is something empirical which belongs to external sensuous\nexperience, not to pure intuition. Furthermore, the axiom presupposes the\nmobility of figures, but that which is movable is matter and therefore is\noutside geometry. The objection to the definition is fundamental:\nsuperposition arguments rely on the implicit assumption that a figure retains\nall its properties (such as size and shape) when moved from one place to\nanother. To assume that the properties of a figure remain unchanged as it is\nmoved around is to make some strong assumptions about the nature of space.\nWhen Euclid starts to deal with three-dimensional geometry, he introduces two\nfurther definitions of equality which relate to solid bodies. Definitions 9\nand 10 at the beginning of book XI read: 9. Similar solid figures are those\ncontained by similar planes equal hi multitude. 10. Equal and similar solid\nfigures are those contained by similar planes equal in multitude and\nmagnitude. The first of these definitions implies that two figures are similar\nif the faces of one can be matched to the faces of the other so that\ncorresponding faces lrave the same shape and are similarly surrounded. The\nsecond definition savs that if, in addition, corresponding faces have the same\nsize, then the figures are identical or equal. These definitions, too, have\nreceived much criticism. The problem is that the equality of the figures is\ndefined in terms of the equality of their constituent parts. While there is\nnothing intrinsically wrong in this (we can define an equivalence relation\nhowever we like), the usefulness of a definition is determined by the extent\nto which it agrees with our intuition. A problem arises because there are some\npolyhedra which definition 10 asserts are equal but which we intuitively\nregard as different. One such pair is shown in Figure 6.1. Each of the\npolyhedra has twenty triangular faces: the orre on the left is the regular\nicosahedron, the other has a depression where the top has been pushed in. In\nthis case, the confusion can be avoided if, besides giving information on the\nsize, shape and arrangement of the faces, we specify the convexity\ncharacteristic of each edge—whether the edges are mountain folds or valley\nfolds. However, even such a detailed description is not\n\n222 Chapter 6 Figure 6.1. The Platonic icosahedron and a non-convex isomer.\nalways sufficient to uniquely determine a polyhedron. The net shown at the top\nof Figure 6.2 can be folded up to give two distinct models. Both are derived\nfrom a triangular prism by twisting the top relative to the base. In fact, if\nyou make a model out of thin card, you will find that the two positions are\ninterchangeable— under light pressure the polyhedron will jump from one state\nto the other. This 'jumping octahedron' was discovered by Walter Wunderlich.\nIts two positions are illustrated in Figure 6.2, both from above and from a\nmore general viewpoint. Two more examples of nets which can be folded up in\nmore than one way were described by Michael Goldberg. They have similar\narchitecture and properties. One is built from 20 equilateral triangles and\nlooks like two dipyramids stuck together (Figure 6.3(a)). Its three stable\npositions can be interchanged by applying light pressure. The second example\nhas twelve isosceles triangular faces whose apex angle is slightly more than\n103°. This tristable dodecahedron is shown in Figure 6.3(b). An example of a\n'flexible' deltahedron was discovered by Paul Mason. It is formed by erecting\na pyramid on each face of a cube and separating one of them by a square\nantiprism (Figure 6.4). (In fact, the model remains flexible if the isolated\npyramid is replaced by a square face.) A model of this polyhedron can be\neasily manipulated and we cannot tell by playing with it how many genuinely\nstable positions it has. But by applying powerful mathematical methods, we can\nprove that some part of the model must be distorted very slightly as it is\nflexed. Examples of this kind are sometimes called shaky polyhedra (or are\nsaid to be infinitesimally flexible). It is probable that Euclid was thinking\nonly of convex solids when he made his definitions. However, even by\nrestricting attention to convex figures, it is not obvious that two figures\ncomprised of similar faces similarly arranged are necessarily 'equal'. How can\nwe be certain that a situation analogous to those described above is\nimpossible after convexity has been imposed? Our experience with models does\nsuggest that convex figures cannot be assembled in more than one way. Even so,\ndefinitions 9 and 10 are not as self-evident as other definitions or axioms.\nThe ideology underpinning mathematics demands that any assertion\n\nDisputed foundations 223 Figure 6.2. Wunderlich's bistable octahedron.\n\n224 Chapter 6 (a) (b) Figure 6.3. Goldberg's tristable polyhedra. that is not\nimmediately acceptable must be proved. Adrien Marie Legendre remarked:\nDefinition 10 is not a proper definition but a theorem which it is necessary\nto prove, for it is not evident that two solids are equal for the sole reason\nthat they have an equal number of equal faces, and if true should be proved by\nsuperposition or otherwise.0 Legendre himself made some progress in trying to\nconvert this definition into a theorem by proving its truth in special cases.\nBuilding on this work, Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) was able to show that\nEuclid's definitions do agree in the case of convex polyhedra—that is, convex\nfigures built in the same way can be superposed on one another. Figure 6.4.\nMason's 'flexible' deltahedron.\n\nStereoisomerism and congruence 225 Stereo-isomerism and congruence Before\ndiscussing Cauchy's work, it is necessary to introduce a few definitions of\nour own which allow more precise expressions of the content of Euclid's\ndefinitions to be formulated. In Chapter 2 the notion of isomerism was\nborrowed from chemistry to describe the relationship between two polyhedra\nwhich have the same constituent faces. Miller's solid and the rhomb-cub-\noctahedron are one example of a pair of isomers, and some of the other\nArchimedean solids also have various isomeric forms. In the two isomeric forms\nof Wunderlich's 'jumping octahedron' the faces are even assembled in the same\nway. Adopting further chemical nomenclature, two polyhedra which are related\nin this way are called stereo-isomers: their faces differ only in their\npositions in space, not in their relative positions in the polyhedra. Stereo-\nisomers can be unfolded to produce the same net. The pair of icosahedra in\nFigure 6.1 are examples of stereo-isomers. The various forms of Goldberg's\ntristable polyhedra are also stereo-isomers. Miller's solid and the rhomb-cub-\noctahedron are not stereo-isomers: even though they are comprised of the same\nfaces they cannot be made from the same net. If we are allowed to turn a net\nover and convert valley folds into mountain folds then mirror-image polyhedra\nsuch as the two snub cubes become stereo-isomers. The two icosahedra in Figure\n6.1 cannot be interchanged without being dismantled then reassembled. Isomers\nof this type are called configurational isomers. The two forms of the jumping\noctahedron can be interchanged: by adding energy to the system, it can be\nforced to flip over into the opposite state all the intermediate positions are\nunstable. This behaviour occurs because the material from which the model is\nmade is easily deformed. As the model jumps, the faces buckle. If the model\nwere made from a stronger material so that the faces could not be distorted\nthen the two forms of the polyhedron would both be rigid -the 'excited'\nintermediate states would no longer be accessible. So, strictly speaking,\nthese polyhedra must be considered as configurational isomers. This\nterminology is again borrowed from chemistry. In that context, stereoisomers\nare categorised into two types according to the ease with which thev can be\ninterconverted. Those which can only be interchanged by breaking and remaking\nbonds are called configurational isomers. This requires the input of a\nsubstantial amount of energy (sufficient to break bonds) and so each form of\nthe isomer tends to be stable. The interconversion of two isomeric molecules\ncan occur in ways that do not require bonds to be broken. Simple rotation\nabout a bond produces molecules with different shapes. This kind of continuous\ndeformation requires very little energy and isomers of this kind are\nrelatively unstable and interconvert freely. This raises the question of\nwhether some kind of continuous deformation can\n\n226 Chapter 6 occur in polyhedra. Is there something like Mason's deltahedron\nwhich is truly flexible? The reader who has made models will probably have\nnoticed that a partly made model is often flexible. It can be deformed with\nvery little effort, the edges between adjacent faces acting as hinges. This\nsituation may continue until the addition of the final face, after which the\nmodel becomes more rigid and stable. This is especially true of small convex\nmodels when no flexing at all can be detected in the completed model. If the\nmodel has a large number of faces, or if it is 'angular' and non-convex with\nre-entrant angles some movement may be seen. But the deformations of these\npolyhedra are not continuous motions of the polyhedral surface. They can\nusually be traced to a distortion of the model— often a separation of the\nfaces at a re-entrant vertex, or the bending of edges and faces. This is the\ncase with the jumping octahedron. We shall insist that the faces remain rigid\nthroughout the deformation, only the dihedral angles may vary with the edges\nacting as hinges. Experience of polyhedral models (convex ones at least)\nsuggests that polyhedra are rigid—they cannot be deformed without being broken\napart. Suppose for a moment that a flexible polyhedron did exist. Then it\ncould be continuously deformed from one position into another. Its initial and\nfinal forms would not be coincident so, by Euclid's fourth axiom, these two\nforms are not equal. But the two forms are derived from the same polyhedron by\nflexing so they must have equal faces similarly arranged. Hence by definition\n10 of book XI, they are equal. The two polyhedra are simultaneously equal and\nnot equal; the same yet different. This paradox may lead one to believe that\nflexible polyhedra do not exist. However, the contradiction does not arise\nfrom the assumption that flexible polyhedra exist, but from the assumption\nthat the two definitions of the woid 'equal' are equivalent and can be used\ninterchangeably. We have already seen from the examples above that the two\ndefinitions do not always agree. However, in this case it is not clear which\ndefinition is intuitively correct. In this situation, it is essential to\nunderstand precisely what is meant by 'equal' each time it is used. This will\ndepend on the definition being invoked at the time. In definition 10 of book\nXI of the Elements, two polyhedra aie defined to be equal if they are stereo-\nisomers. The other definition, Euclid's fouith axiom, corresponds to our\nmodern notion of congruence. The term 'congruence' can be defined in various\nways and these diffci in their choice of primitive concepts. Congruence itself\ncan be used as an undefined term in the same way as 'point' or 'line'. In this\ncase a list of statements must be given which describes the way in which\ncongruence is assumed to behave. These axioms of congruence include:\n\nStereoisomerism and congruence 227 A thing is congruent to itself. Things\ncongruent to the same thing are congruent to each other. These two together\nreplace the fourth axiom since they imply that things which coincide are\ncongruent. The axioms also list some basic objects that are taken to be\ncongruent. One such axiom is If two sides and the included angle of a triangle\nare congruent respectively to the two sides and their included angle of a\nsecond triangle then the two triangles are congruent. This last statement was\ngiven in the form of a theorem by Euclid which he proved using superposition\nbut, as we have seen, such an argument relies on unstated assumptions. David\nHilbert (1862-1943), whose research into the foundations of mathematics led to\nformal systems of axioms for several areas of mathematics including geometry,\nrealised that it had to be treated as an axiom if congruence were taken to be\nan undefined term. If motion is regarded as an undefined term then\nsuperposition arguments can be made rigorous and Euclid's fourth axiom can be\ntaken as a definition of congruence. Of course, some axioms of motion are\nneeded to specify the properties that motion is assumed to possess: figures\nmust retain their shape and metric properties during motion, for example.\nAlternatively, distance can be taken as an undefined term. A motion of space\ncan then be defined as a continuous one- to-one transformation which\nassociates to each point of space a unique image point. The motions which\npreserve the distances between points are called rigid motions (or isometries)\nand these can be used to model superposition arguments. Whichever of these\nformal definitions of congruence is used, the intuitive idea of placing one\ncut-out figure over another so that they coincide is made explicit, and this\nprovides a solid basis for investigation. If two polyhedra are congruent then\nclearly they are also stereo-isomers. However, the converse is not necessarily\ntrue. When discussing equality, it is essential Figure 6.5.\n\n228 Chapter 6 to know which equivalence relation is being used: what does\n'equal' mean in the current context. Euclid's two definitions give rise to two\ndifferent equivalence relations, and the conflict concerning a possible\nflexible polyhedron arose because the two were mixed. All that can be said\nabout two forms of a flexible polyhedron is that they would be stereo-isomers\nbut would not be congruent. Cauchy's rigidity theorem Cauchy's most important\ncontiibution to geometry is his proof of the statement that up to congruency a\nconvex polyhedron is determined by its faces'' H. Fieudenthal The proof that\nEuclid's two different definitions of equality are consistent when restricted\nto convex polyhedra came in 1813 when Cauchy proved what, is known as the\nRigidity Theorem: a closed convex polyhedron is rigid. Although it is often\nexpressed in these terms, the proof actually shows the stronger result that\nconvex stereo-isomers are congruent. From this it is easy to derive the\nrigidity of convex bodies: a flexible convex polyhedron would still be convex\nafter a slight deformation. Thus there would be two convex stereo-isomers\nwhich were not congruent and this violates the theorem. Hence, a flexible\nconvex polyhedron does not exist. Theorem. Closed, convex polyhedra which are\nstereo-isomers are congruent. Proof: The theorem is proved by assuming that a\npair of convex steieo-isomers exists which are not congruent, and then\nderiving a contradiction. This is achieved by analysing the relationship\nbetween local geometrical properties and the global topological nature of the\npolyhedra. So suppose there exist two convex polyhedra which are stereo-\nisomers but which are not congruent. They are bounded by the same kinds of\nfaces similarly arranged and corresponding faces are congruent. If every\ndihedral angle in one polyhedron were congruent to the corresponding dihedral\nangle in the other then the two polyhedra would be congruent. So, since the\ntwo polyhedra are assumed not to be congruent, they must differ in at least\none of their dihedral angles, and consequently some of their solid angles must\ndiffer as well. The differences between the two polyhedral isomers manifest\nthemselves at the solid angles, so studying the variety of solid angles and\ntheir combinations provides information about what sorts of isomers are\npossible. The properties of a solid angle can be represented by a polygon on a\nsphere. As in Chapter 5, a sphere of radius one unit is placed with its centre\nat the vertex of the solid angle. The faces of the polyhedron surrounding this\nvertex intersect\n\nCauchy's rigidity theorem 229 the sphere in arcs of great circles forming a\nspherical polygon (Figure 6.5). The lengths of the sides of this spherical\npolygon are a measure of the plane angles of the faces which form the solid\nangle, and the angles of the polygon are equal to the dihedral angles between\nthese faces. Corresponding faces of the two stereo-isomers being considered\nare congruent, so corresponding plane angles must also be congruent.\nTherefore, the spherical polygons formed from corresponding solid angles must\nhave sides of the same length. Any differences between the two polygons must\nbe in their angles, which vary as the dihedral angles of the polyhedron vary.\nAs an example to show the power of this method of description, consider a\nconvex polyhedron in which every vertex is 3-valent. In this case, there are\nthree faces meeting at every solid angle, so all of the spherical polygons\nwhich describe these solid angles are triangles. As with planar triangles, a\nspherical triangle is completely determined by the lengths of its three sides.\nThis means the spherical polygon associated to a solid angle of any convex\nstereo-isomer of this polyhedron must be congruent to the spherical polygon of\nthe corresponding solid angle in the original polyhedron because corresponding\nsides must have the same length. This means that their corresponding angles\nare also congruent, and therefore the dihedral angles of the two isomers are\ncongruent, implying the congruence of the two polyhedra. To apply this idea to\npolyhedra in general, it is necessary to know how other kinds of spherical\npolygon with sides of fixed length can be deformed. In particular, it is\nuseful to know how the angles may change as this gives information on the way\nin which the dihedral angles of the polyhedron can vary. This motivates the\nfollowing discussion and lemma. The spherical polygon can be thought of as a\nchain of rigid rods connected by hinged vertices. We are interested in the\ndifferent ways in which this chain can be placed so that it forms a convex\npolygon, and also in the relationships between corresponding angles of the\nvarious positions. An initial reference position can be chosen for the polygon\nand then other positions can be compared to it. In this way, the angles of the\npolygon in any of its positions can be labelled '+' or ' —' according to\nwhether they are larger or smaller than their corresponding angles in the\nreference polygon. Lemma. When reading round the labels on the angles of the\npolygon in cyclic order, at least four changes of sign must be encountered.\nPROOF: There must be an even number of changes of sign when reading round the\npolygon since the sets of'+' labels and '—' labels must alternate. So to show\nthat there are at least four it is sufficient to show that there cannot be\nzero or two changes of sign. Firstly, consider a polygon in which all the\nsides except one have fixed length.\n\n230 Chapter 6 (In the 'closed chain of rods' image, one of the rods has been\nreplaced by an elasticated cord.) If the polygon is triangular then it is\nclear that as the angle between the two rigid sides varies, the length of the\nvariable side also changes, increasing or decreasing as the angle increases or\ndecreases. If the polygon has n sides and all the angles between the rigid\nsides are varied together then the length of the variable side also\nchanges—increasing when all the angles increase, and decreasing when they all\ndecrease.1 So, if the variable length side is now made rigid, all the angles\nbetween the rods cannot simultaneously all increase nor all decrease.\nTherefore, if the angles do change, some must increase and others decrease.\nThis means that both '+' labels and ' —' labels must appear at the vertices.\nTherefore, there are at least two changes of sign around the polygon. Suppose\nthat there are exactly two. Then the polygon can be divided by a line into two\nparts so that all the angles in one part are labelled '+' and all the angles\nin the other part are labelled '—' (see Figure 6.6). If all the angles\nlabelled '+' were to increase then the length of this diagonal line would also\nincrease; and if all the angles labelled '—' were to decrease then the length\nof the line would decrease in response. But the line cannot grow both longer\nand shorter at the same time, therefore the angles of the polygon cannot be\nseparated into the two sets and there must be at least four changes of sign\naround the polygon. Figure 6.6. Until now, it has been assumed that all the\nangles are labelled so that none of the corresponding angles are equal. But\nsuppose that only some of the angles alter while the others remain unchanged.\nAnother polygon can be inscribed in the first by connecting the labelled\nvertices with lines (see Figure 6.7). The shaded regions in the figure are\nrigid because their sides in common with the original polygon are rigid, and\nthe angles between these sides do not change. Hence the sides in common with\nthe inscribed polygon are also rigid. Thus all the angles of this inscribed\npolygon are labelled and all of its sides are rigid. The same argument as\nabove shows that there must be at least four changes of sign around 1 Although\nthis is easily believable, it is tricky to establish rigorously as we shall\nsee in a later section.\n\nCauchy's rigidity theorem 231 this inscribed polygon, and hence at least four\nchanges of sign around the original polygon. ■ Figure 6.7. This lemma provides\nsufficient information to complete the proof of the theorem. Suppose that one\nof the two non-congruent stereo-isomers is taken as the reference point and\nthe other is compared to it. Then its dihedral angles can be labelled '+' or\n'—' according to whether they are larger or smaller than the corresponding\ndihedral angles in the reference polyhedron. These labels can also be attached\nto the angles in the spherical polygons since they are equal to the dihedral\nangles. We now proceed to count the total number of changes in sign (denoted\nby T) which are encountered when reading round all of the spherical polygons\nin turn. This will be done in two ways one of which produces a lower bound and\nthe other an upper bound. Further analysis leads to the following\ncontradiction T ^ (upper bound) < (lower bound) ^ T. Step 1. The lower bound.\nThe lemma shows that there must be at least four changes of sign when reading\nround each spherical polygon, so the total number of changes of sign must be\nat least four times the number of vertices. Letting V denote the number of\nvertices, this gives the lower bound for T as T > 4V. (A) Step 2. The upper\nbound. To calculate an upper bound for T we look at the faces of the\npolyhedron. Suppose, initially, that every dihedral angle of the polyhedron is\nlabelled. Two edges of the polyhedron which are adjacent sides of a face are\nalso adjacent edges at a vertex of the polyhedron. Suppose that a face is\ntriangular and has edges e\\, e2 and e3. The labels on the dihedral angles\nassociated with the edges can be\n\n232 Chapter 6 used to label the edges themselves. Suppose that ex is labelled\n'+'. In order that the maximum number of changes of sign occur around the\nvertices, the edges adjacent to e\\ must be labelled ' —'. This forces both e2\nand e3 to be labelled ' —'. There is now no change of sign between the two\nedges meeting at the third corner of the triangle (see Figure 6.8). So at most\ntwo changes of sign are contributed to T by triangular faces. Figure 6.8. A\nfour-sided face or a pentagonal face can contribute at most four changes of\nsign to T (see Figure 6.9), and similarly a hexagonal or heptagonal face can\ncontribute at most six changes of sign, and so on. Figure 6.9. Adding all\nthese contributions together gives an upper bound for T. Let Fn denote the\nnumber of faces of the polyhedron which have n sides. Then T ^ 2F3 + 4F4 + 4F5\n+ 6F6 + 6F7 + • • •. (B) Step 3. The contradiction. To show the contradiction\ncontained in statements (A) and (B), Cauchy used\n\nCauchy's early career 233 Euler's formula (of which he had recently given a\nproof). Let the number of edges and faces of the polyhedron be denoted by E\nand F respectively. Then F = F3 + F4 + F5 + F6 + F7 + • • • E = 1/2 (3^3 + 4F4\n+ 5F5 + 6F6 + 7F7 + • • •). Euler's formula can be written V = 2 + E — F.\nMultiplying this by four and substituting in the above values for E and F\ngives AV = 8 + 2F3 + 4F4 + 6F5 + 8F6 + 10F7 + • • •. (C) A straightforward\ncomparison shows that the expression on the right-hand side of this equation\nis strictly greater than the upper bound for T derived in B. But AV is a lower\nbound for T, so the contradiction has been established. The extension of this\nproof to the case where only some of the dihedral angles differ (and hence not\nall of the edges are labelled) is analogous to the extension of the polygonal\ncase in the previous lemma. The edges which are associated to labelled\ndihedral angles can be labelled themselves. There are at least four changes of\nsign round a vertex so if one edge incident to a vertex is labelled then at\nleast three other edges incident to that vertex must also be labelled. Hence,\nthe labelled edges form a network which partitions the faces of the polyhedron\ninto groups, each of which is rigid. The set of edges of this network may not\nbe connected, in which case Euler's formula needs to be adapted, becoming V ^\n2+E—F, and (C) becomes an inequality. Using the same argument as before, we\ncan reach the same contradiction. ■ Cauchy's early career In 1805 Cauchy\nentered the Ecole Polytechnique aged 16. Two years later he graduated to the\nEcole des Ponts et Chaussees and was trained in civil engineering. After\nfinishing his education he was employed on some major building projects: the\nconstruction of the Ourcq canal, and the harbour at Cherbourg which was to be\nNapoleon's naval base for his assault on England. It was the influence of\nJoseph Louis Lagrange which set Cauchy on a mathematical path. Cauchy's work\non polyhedra was the first research he undertook. Lagrange suggested that he\ninvestigate how to enumerate the regular star polyhedra— a problem posed by\nLouis Poinsot in 1810. His solution (which is discussed in Chapter 7),\ntogether with his derivation of Euler's formula, formed his first paper. He\nsubmitted it to the Institut de France (which took over the functions of the\nAcademie des Sciences during the Napoleonic era). The commission that\nevaluated his work comprised Legendre and Etienne-Louis Malus (1775-1812).\nThey gave Cauchy a very favourable report and suggested that he continue his\n\n234 Chapter 6 studies of polyhedra. A year later he submitted his proof that\nEuclid's definitions of equality agree for convex polyhedra. This time Malus\nwas harder to convince. Cauchy wrote to his father who was acting as\nintermediary: If M. Malus seemed unsatisfied with the proof I sent you it\nprobably has to do with the fact that you did not advise him of what I had\ntaken care to tell you; namely, that my proof rests on several lemmas that are\neasy to prove. It does not, therefore, surprise me in the least that M. Malus\nhas concluded that I assumed what could not be assumed. But, that is not the\nquestion: if I had the time, I would have sent you the proofs of the lemmas I\nused. Today, I will reduce the question down to the matter of knowing whether\nor not my proof is acceptable, assuming the lemmas are established. As to the\nform of the proof that I used, I think it would be not only difficult to\nchange it, but downright impossible. The reason is that until now a geometric\nargument has not been given, except in terms ofreductio ad absurdum, of the\ntheorem that in 2-dimensional geometry is analogous to the one in\n3-dimensional geometry that I dealt with: I mean the theorem by which it is\nproved that two triangles are equal if their three sides are equal. If one\nshould establish this latter theorem without using either trigonometry or\nreductio ad absurdum, I would agree that my proof ought not to be admitted. It\nthus seems impossible to banish the reductio ad absurdum proof from geometry;\nand this is particularly true in the present case. In fact, in order to prove\nthat under certain conditions only one polyhedron can be constructed, it is\nnecessary to see that after the first figure has been constructed subject to\nthe given conditions then one cannot construct a second figure without\nencountering a contradiction. I insist on this argument because the type of\nproof I gave seems to me to be inherent in the nature of the theorem in\nquestion. Moreover, it is precisely what M. Legendre used in establishing\nseveral particular cases of the same theorem.'' Four weeks after Cauchy\nsubmitted his paper, the evaluating commission (composed of Legendre, Carnot\nand Biot) gave it a glowing report. Once Cauchy's proof had been accepted and\nappeared in print, it became highly regarded and was reproduced in several\nnineteenth-century geometry books. It displayed originality and ingenuity and\ndid not require a mastery of difficult techniques to be able to follow. Even\nso, developing the brilliant insights which make it work required the mind of\na fine mathematician. Cauchy went on to make numerous contributions to many\nbranches of mathematics. The sheer volume of his output, second only to Euler,\nis made up of several books and around 800 papers which occupy the two dozen\nvolumes of his collected works. His huge productivity led to a rule still\nenforced by the Academic\n\nSteinitz' lemma 235 des Sciences limiting papers in its journal Comptes Rendus\nto a maximum length of four pages. Cauchy submitted articles so frequently\nthat the Academie could not keep up with the rising cost of printing. Cauchy's\ntwo landmark papers on polyhedra were the only work he did in the field. His\nlater works were mainly in analysis (the study of convergence or divergence of\ninfinite series), functions of real and complex variables, differential\nequations and mathematical physics. But he is probably best remembered by the\nmathematical community for his demands for rigour in analysis and calculus.\nHis inspiration helped to convince many of the need to banish the intuitive\narguments which often led to false conclusions. Steinitz' lemma In spite of\nCauchy's great achievement in proving the rigidity theorem, as time went by,\nsmall cracks appeared in his argument. The most serious Haw went unnoticed for\nmore than a century. In the 1930's Ernst Steinitz noticed a defect in the very\nfoundation of the theorem—the lemma concerned with the effects of varying the\nangles in a polygon. The entire proof rests on this one result: If, in a plane\nor spherical convex polygon ABCDEFG all of whose sides AB, BC, CD, ■ • -, FG\nwith the exception of AG have fixed length, one increases (or decreases)\nsimultaneously the angles B, C, D, E, F, G between these same sides then the\nlength of the variable side increases in the first case, and decreases in the\nsecond. Cauchy thought that changing the varying angles one at a time would\nproduce the same effect as making all the changes simultaneously. In this way\nhe could repeatedly use the analogous result for triangles (proved by\nLegendre) to show that altering each angle in turn increases the length of the\nextendable side. However, because the lemma deals with convex polygons, it is\nnecessary to ensure that all the intermediate stages are also convex. The\nexample shown in Figure 6.10 illustrates this point: when only one angle is\nchanged and the polygon becomes non-convex. Steinitz, who was first to notice\nthis deficiency, provided a correct proof. His proof, however, is quite long\nand this has prompted others to search for shorter ones. The version given\nbelow is due to Issai J. Schoenberg. Lemma. Let A\\, A2, • ■ ■ ,An and J5i, B2,\n■ • •, Bn be the corners of two convex n-sided polygons whose sides are such\nthat AXA2 = B\\B2, A2A% = B2BU ■ ■ -, An-iAn = Bn-iBn and whose angles are such\nthat lA2 ^ lB2, lA.>, ^ lBA, LAn_\\ ^ LBn-\\, where at least one inequality is\nstrict. Then A\\An < B\\B7I. Proof: The proof uses induction on the number of\nsides of the polygon. As Cauchy observed, the lemma is true for triangles—the\ncase n — 3. We now assume\n\n236 Chapter 6 Figure 6.10. that the lemma holds for all polygons with fewer\nthan n sides and establish the result for n-gons. Step 1. Suppose that at\nleast one of the angle relations is an equality so that lAi = iBi. The\ntriangles with vertices Ai-i, Ai, Ai+i and 5j_i, 5,;, Bl+i are congruent so\nthe lengths Ai-iAi+i and 5j_15j+1 are equal. Therefore, the polygons -^1 j\"'\")\n-^t-i) -^t+i)'-' iAn and By, • • •, 5j_i, Bj+i, ■ ■ ■, Bn are both convex and\nsatisfy the conditions of the lemma. They have (n — 1) sides and so, by the\ninductive hypothesis, we have AiAn < B\\Bn. Step 2. Assume now that all the\nangle inequalities are strict so that lAi < IBi for all i = 2,3, • • •, (n —\n1). Let 9 be an angle between lAn-y and lBn_\\\\. Consider the polygon whose\nvertices are A\\, A2, • • • ,An_i,Ag, where the angle An_2An-iAo = 9 and the\nside An-iAg = An-iAn (see Figure 6.11). While this polygon remains convex we\nhave that A\\An < A\\Ag (by step 1). If the polygon A\\, A2, • • •, An-i,Ag is\nconvex for all values of 9 then when 9 — lBn^i it has one angle in common with\nthe polygon B], ■ • •, Bn. Applying step 1 again we see that A\\Ag < BiBn.\nHence AxAn < AiAg < BiB,\n\nRotating rings and flexible frameworks 237 Figure 6.11. Step 3. We have still\nto deal with the case when the polygon Ai,A2,---, -4,,_i, A0 is not convex for\nall values of 6 between Z^4„_i and Z5n_x. Let 0 be the last value of 0 for\nwhich the polygon is convex (Figure 6.12). By step 1 we have AxAn < A^Ap (A)\nThe angle at A\\ is now 180° so A,A? = A2A^-A2AX. (B) The two polygons whose\nvertices are A2, A3, ■ ■ ■, An-i, A^ and B2, ■ ■ ■, Z?„_i, Bn are convex and\nboth have (n — 1) sides. Applying the induction hypothesis to these polygons\ngives A2A$ < B2Bn. Since BiB2Bn is a triangle, its sides satisfy B\\B2 + B\\Bn ^\nB2Bn. Putting all this together gives the following: Ax An < AxAd = A2A?-AXA2\n< B2Bn — B\\B2 ^ B\\Bn. The proof is now complete. ■ from (A) from (B) from (C)\nfrom (D) (C) (D) Rotating rings and flexible frameworks There are some kinds\nof structures of a polyhedral nature which are not rigid but which move freely\nin some way. One kind of these flexible structures seems to have been\ndiscovered several times over. An example was described by Max Briickner\n\n238 Chapter 6 Figure 6.12. in his 1900 compendium on polyhedra Vielecke und\nVielflache. These structures are formed by joining identical tetrahedra\ntogether in a chain. A tetrahedron is attached to two others along opposite\nedges so that the connecting edges act as hinges. When the chain of tetrahedra\nis sufficiently long the two ends can be brought together to form a closed\nring. The flexibility of the hinged joints allows the ring to move and it can\nbe rotated continuously through its centre. A ring of as few as six tetrahedra\nhas this remarkable property. You can verify this by making a model from the\nnet shown in Figure 6.13. (Each column of triangles folds up into a\ntetrahedron. The net will naturally form a chain and you will need to join the\ntwo ends together.) Examples can also be constructed from irregular tetrahedra\nor sphenoids. Rings of scalene sphenoids have a twisted appearance and when\nthey are rotated the tetrahedra tumble into the centre in sequence. Doris\nSchattschneider and Wallace Walker have covered the faces of various rings of\ntetrahedra (along with the Platonic solids and the cub-octahedron) with Figure\n6.13. A net for a rotating ring of six tetrahedra.\n\nRotating rings and flexible frameworks 239 some of the repeating patterns\ndrawn by M. C. Escher. These retail under the name 'Kaleidocycles'. I also\nhave an educational ring of tetrahedra marketed as a 'Techtonocycle'. This is\na ring of six tetrahedra which have a hexagonal appearance like the model made\nfrom Figure 6.13. Each of the four apparent hexagons contains a map of the\nEarth at a particular era in history. By rotating the ring so that different\nfaces become visible, the movement of landmasses under the influence of plate\ntechtonics can be traced. An attempt to construct ordinary polyhedra which\nflex was made by a French engineer named Raoul Bricard. In 1897 he discovered\nsome flexible 'octahedra'. However, his examples of flexible polyhedra all\npossess self-intersections: models cannot be made without some face passing\nthrough another. The flexibility of these polyhedra can be demonstrated by\nmodels in which the interiors of the faces are omitted. The resulting skeletal\nframework of edges and vertices can be thought of as a set of rods joined at\nthe vertices so that they can rotate freely. Each face of the polyhedron is a\ntriangle so the faces are rigid even though their interiors are missing. Two\nof Bricard's three flexible octahedra are described below. Bricard's first\nflexible octahedron. U V Figure 6.14. Construction of Bricard's first flexible\noctahedron. To construct the first type of octahedron start with a\nquadrilateral ABCD which is non-planar and such that the pair of opposite\nedges AD and BC have the same length, and similarly for the pair AB and CD.\nEven though the quadrilateral is not planar, it still has 2-fold rotational\nsymmetry. The vertices U and V lie above the quadrilateral and are chosen so\nthat the rotational symmetry is preserved. Four of the faces of this\noctahedron are the triangles of the pyramid with base ABCD and apex U. The\nother four faces are the triangles of the pyramid on the same base with apex\nV. This construction is illustrated in Figure 6.14. Notice that the sides of\nthe triangular faces ADV and BCU are linked so these faces must intersect.\n(These faces have been omitted in the figure.) A model\n\n240 Chapter 6 of the edge-and-vertex framework can easily be made from\ndrinking straws and string. The straws form the bars of the framework and a\nsingle piece of string can be threaded through all the straws (because the\noctahedron is 4-valent) and knots placed at the joints. Bricard's second\nflexible octahedron. Figure 6.15. Construction of Bricard's second flexible\noctahedron. To construct the second example, choose four points P, Q, R, T on\na circle with centre O such that the arc PQ has the same length as the arc RT.\nA quadrilateral which has vertices PQRT can be inscribed in the circle as\nshown in Figure 6.15. Let L be a line perpendicular to the plane of the circle\nwhich passes through O. Choose two points N and S on L which lie on opposite\nsides of O and which are equidistant from O. Again, the faces of the\noctahedron are formed from the triangular faces of two pyramids—one with apex\nN and base PQRT and the other on the same base with apex S. In the figure\nfaces QRN and PST are omitted. Are all polyhedra rigid? The flexible\nstructures described in the preceding section are not genuine polyhedra.\nCauchy's proof of the equivalence of Euclid's two definitions implies that\nconvex polyhedra must be rigid. But what about polyhedra in general -are they\nall rigid? People had speculated that this was the case long before Cauchy\nprovided the first mathematical evidence in favour of the conjecture;. In 1766\n\nAre all polyhedra rigid? 241 Leonhard Euler wrote A closed spatial figure\nallows no changes as long as it is not rip})c<l apart/ The conviction that all\npolyhedra are rigid became known as the Rigiditv Conjecture. Research on\nrigidity developed in many directions as people sought to extend Cauchy's\ntheorem. Some people adapted Cauchy's ideas to differential geometry and\nproved analogous results about the rigidity of smooth surfaces. This led to\nthe study of infinitesimal rigidity. Something which is infinitesimally rigid\nis also rigid in the normal sense. Polyhedra which are not infinitesimally\nrigid are called infinitesimally flexible or shaky. Mason's deltahedron shows\nthat the two kinds of rigidity are not identical for it is both shaky and\nrigid. People have also studied the rigidity of the edge-skeletons of\npolyhedra. A convex polyhedron with triangular faces has a rigid skeleton.\nOther skeletons, like that of a cube for example, are flexible. Since any\npolygon can be cut up into triangles by adding diagonals, any convex skeleton\ncan be triangulated by adding extra edges. Alexander Danilovich Alexandrov\nmodified Cauchy's theorem and showed that a convex skeleton which is\ntriangulated by adding extra edges becomes rigid. The additional edges must\nend at the original vertices or at new vertices on the original edges. If new\nvertices are added in the interioi of a face then an infinitesimal flexing can\noccur. Herman Gluck studied Alexandrov's work and in the early 1970's he\nproved that, for non-convex polyhedra, almost all triangular skeletons are\ninfinitesimally rigid. This curious result implies that almost all polyhedra\nare rigid. The Rigidity Conjecture was now known to be true in nearly every\ncase. Gluck remarked Euler's conjecture in this case is therefore\n\"statistically\" true.'1 The reader may feel that expressions such as 'nearly\nevery' and 'almost all' are too vague to appear in the statement of a theorem.\nHowever, they can be given precise interpretations. As an example to\nillustrate this usage, imagine part of a plane is coloured white and that a\nmathematical figure composed of points and lines lies in this plane and is\ncoloured black. We can think of this as a diagram on a page. The expression\n'almost all' can be used in the same way it is used above to describe the\nrelative numbers of black and white points: almost all the points on the page\nare white. The probability that a point of the page chosen at random is\ncoloured black is given by the ratio of the area of the diagram to the area of\nthe page. But since mathematical lines are idealised and have no thickness,\nthe diagram has zero area. So 'statistically' all the points are white. The\ntechnical statement of Gluck's theorem requires a knowledge of the topological\nnotion of an open dense set. (In the above example, the white points form\n\n242 Chapter 6 an open dense subset of the plane.) The theorem states that the\ninfinitesimally rigid polyhedra are open and dense in a space of all\npolyhedra. Gluck's proof uses methods from algebraic geometry. Ethan Bolker\nused the same machinery to derive properties which a flexible polyhedron would\nbe forced to possess. For example, the flexing would only stop when one face\ncollided with another. Mason's deltahedron does not have this property. Its\napparent motion cannot be continued this far without some edges tearing and\nthe polyhedron breaking apart. Therefore, it must be rigid. Just as the\nobservation that almost all points on a page are white does not allow one to\nconclude that every point is white, so Gluck's proof that almost all polyhedra\nare rigid does not imply that flexible polyhedra cannot exist. It does mean,\nhowever, that if such polyhedra do exist then they are extremely laie. This\ntantalisingly small window of opportunity attracted the attention of a young\nAmerican Ph.D student: Robert Connelly resolved to find the elusive missing\npiece of the jigsaw. The fact that almost all polyhedra are rigid means that\nit is extremely unlikely that a flexible polyhedron can be found by accident.\nSuch a thing would need to be explicitly constructed to break the conjecture.\nConnelly started investigating skeletons or frameworks. In particular, ho\nstudied frameworks constructed from planar polygons by adding two extra\nvertices, one on either side of the plane—a process called suspension. He\nwanted to discover which polygons have flexible suspensions. Using suspension\nand other constructions, Connelly found several classes of flexible frameworks\nincluding Bricard's flexible octahedral skeletons. Unfortunately, all of them\nsuffered from the problem that the faces could not be filled in. There were\nalways places where faces had to pass through each other for the mechanism to\nflex. Connelly asked himself how bad these self-intersections needed to be.\nWas there anything in his catalogue of flexible frameworks which could be\nconsidered as having the fewest self-intersections? He found that one of\nBricard's octahedra can be adapted to produce an immersed polyhedial surface\nwith only two self-intersections, and these were particularly nice: places\nwhere edges crossed through each other; there were no intersections in the\ninteriors of the faces. All he needed was some way to remove these last two\nobstructions. At a 1975 topology conference in Cornell University, Connelly\nheard that another mathematician, working in different area of mathematics,\nhad been working on the same problem and had found a flexible polyhedron.\nDisheartened by the news, but curious to find out more, Connelly traced the\nrumour back to its source. Eventually he discovered that it referred to\nhimself! Two years after this meeting, Connelly was back at Cornell after\ntaking visiting fellowships at Paris and Syracuse. He was puzzling over his\nlists of flexible frameworks once more. Then, in one of those rare moments\nwhen fortune smiles on the prepared mind, things clicked into place. He\nrecalls vividly this moment of\n\nThe Connelly sphere 243 illumination. It was a warm June day and he glanced up\nat the clock: it was 3pm. He spent the next few weeks working with renewed\nenthusiasm chocking ovory detail to make sure nothing had been overlooked, to\nensure that his quest was really over. It was true. He had constructed a\ngenuinely flexible polvhedron— one without self-intersections. He had created\na counter-example to the Rigidity Conjecture; a black point in the vastness of\nthe white page. The Connelly sphere Connelly constructed his flexible\npolyhedral sphere as follows. Take a planar framework of twelve edges and six\nvertices like that illustiated in Figure 6.16(a)—the two crossover points in\nthe interior are not vortices. This framework is flexible and is one of\nBricard's first type of octahedia. In this case some of the edges intersect\nother edges, and the whole of every face moots parts of some other faces. The\npolyhedron does not remain planar when it is flexed. This polyhedron can be\nconverted into one with fewer self-inteisections and which is still flexible.\nTo achieve this, each triangular face is replaced by a group of three\ntriangular faces forming a pyramid without a base. The foui faces which\nsurround vertex V are replaced by four pyramids lying above the plane of the\nframework like mountains, and the four faces surrounding U are replaced by\npyramids beneath the framework forming pits (Figures 6.16(b) and (o)). The\nresulting surface has two points of self-intersection which occur where oik1\nedge passes through another. The regions of the polyhedral surface around each\nof these points is illustrated in Figure 6.16(d). The next stage in the\nprocess is to find a way of removing these two remaining intersection points.\nThis is achieved by the insertion of what Connelly calls crinkles. A crinkle\nis derived from Bricard's second type of octahedron by removing two faces.\nThis creates a flexible surface with no self-intersections, and which has a\nboundary that can be attached to another surface. A crinkle can be inserted\ninto the edge of a polyhedron as follows. Lot E be the edge and let F\\ and F2\nbe the faces which are joined along E. Let C bo a circle which meets E in two\npoints, P and R, such that the plane containing the circle bisects the angle\nbetween the two faces F\\ and F2. Let N be a point on i<\\ and S be a point on\nF2 such that the line NS passes through the contic of the circle C and is\nperpendicular to the plane of C. Remove the triangles PRN from Fi and PRS from\nF2 as shown in Figure 6.17(a). Choose two points Q and T on C with Q under E\nand T above E so that the distance from P to Q is the same as the distance\nfrom R to T. A crinkle can then be constructed from the points P,Q,R,T,N and S\nwhich plugs the hole in F\\ and F2. The crinkle is isolated in Figure 6.17(b)\nand shown inserted into the fold in 6.17(c)). As the crinkle is constructed\nfrom a flexible octahedron, the edge E still acts as a hinge between the two\nfaces attached to it.\n\n244 Chapter 6 (a) (c) Figure 6.16. Construction of the Connelly sphere. The\nconstruction of the flexible polyhedron is completed by inserting a crinkle\ninto one of the two edges at each intersection point in the surface. Further\ndevelopments Connelly sent a detailed description of the flexible sphere to\nhis colleagues at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques in Paris. They\nheld a contest to see whether simpler examples could be found. Connelly had\npaid little attention to the complexity of his polyhedron. He was satisfied\njust to have found just one\n\nFurther developments 245 (c) Figure 6.17. Inserting a crinkle into a fold.\nexample. Nicolaas H. Kuiper and Pierre Deligne modified Connelly's example by\nexpanding the crinkles and amalgamating some of the vertices. They obtained a\nflexible polyhedron with 18 faces and 11 vertices. Klaus Steffen took a more\nindependent approach and found an example with only 14 faces and 9 vertices. A\nnet for this polyhedron is shown in Figure 6.18. The reader is encouraged to\nmake a model and work out how it flexes. Observe how the flexing is limited by\nthe collision of several faces. Earlier, we noted that this must be the case\nfor a genuinely flexible polyhedron. A Russian mathematician, I. G. Maksimov,\nhas recently shown that all polyhedral spheres with triangular faces and fewer\nthan nine vertices are rigid. This implies that Steffen's flexible polyhedron\nhas as few vertices as possible. An intriguing property of all the known\nflexible polyhedra is that their volume does not change as they are flexed.\nThis raises the question of whether or not it is possible to construct\npolyhedral bellows—does there exist a flexible polyhedron whose volume varies\nas it is flexed? Dennis Sullivan conjectured that no such\n\n246 Chapter 6 2 \"o n Figure 6.18. A net for Steffen's flexible polyhedron.\n\nWhen are polyhedra equal? 247 bellows exist and that all flexible polyhedra\nflex with constant volume. Connelly has nicknamed this the Bellows\nConjecture.2 When are polyhedra equal? At the beginning of this chapter we\nstarted on a quest to search for an equivalence relation defined on polyhedra\nwhich captures our intuitive idea of when two polyhedra are the same. The\nsuperposition arguments used in Greek times convey a great deal of what is\ninvolved perceptually and, until the discovery of flexible polyhedra,\ncongruence was probably the best choice of equivalence relation. However, the\nexistence of flexible polyhedra leads us to reconsider whether congruence\nstill matches our experience. For surely, one of these polyhedra remains the\nsame polyhedron while it is being flexed, even though it passes through a\ncontinuum of non-congruent positions during the process. Our equivalence\nrelation needs to be modified to take this into account. We define two\npolyhedra to be equal if one is congruent to the other, or if one can be\ndeformed into a polyhedron congruent to the other by flexing. Definition. Two\npolyhedra Pi and P2 are equal if either (i) Pi is congruent to P2, or (ii)\nthere is a continuous deformation of Pi which preserves the metric properties\nof the faces and which results in a polyhedron congruent to P2. With this\ndefinition, a rigid polyhedron is equal only to itself and is the unique\nmember of its equivalence class. The equivalence class of a flexible\npolyhedron contains all of the polyhedra into which it can be deformed and\nthese are all regarded as equivalent forms of one polyhedron. We could remove\nthe dependence on scale by replacing congruence with similarity. Then\npolyhedra of different sizes would also be equivalent. An unfortunate aspect\nof this equivalence relation is the complexity which can be involved in\ndeciding whether two stereo-isomers can actually be interconverted by a\ncontinuous deformation. To prove that Mason's deltahedron is rigid takes a lot\nof high powered mathematics. We can again adapt some chemical terminology to\ndescribe the way in which the different positions of a flexible polyhedron are\nrelated. Isomers of a molecule which differ only by a rotation of one part of\nthe molecule about a bond are called rotational isomers, or rotamers for\nshort. By analogy, we can call isomers of a polyhedron which are related by a\ncontinuous deformation fleximers. With this terminology our equivalence\nrelation becomes easy to state: two polyhedra are equal if, and only if, they\nare fleximers. 2This has recently been established. See R.

Those figuios can ho regarded as regular polyhedra hut, to\ngive this interpretation, the hguios must he seen as being composed of star\npentagons rather than naively from triangles. The faces then seem to pass\nthrough one another even though they still moot edge to edge. We have also\nseen examples of a generalised kind of Aiohiinedean polyhedron that are\nconstructed from regular polygons (convex or star like) hut whose faces\nintersect in places that are not edges. These are the uniform polyhedra (also\ndiscussed in Chapter 4). The Russian Evgraf Stephanovich Fodorov called such\nself-intersecting, or re-entrant, polyhedra koilohedra (from the Gieek for\nconcave). In these examples, the term 'polyhedron' is interpreted in a hioadei\nsense than the topologist's polyhedral surface defined in Chapter 5. This moie\ngeneral typo of polyhedron is the subject of this chapter. As a polyhedron\nwill ahvavs be some kind of collection of polygons, whatever other conditions\nan1 imposed, we shall begin by studying the kinds of building blocks\navailable. Generalised polygons A polygon is often visualised as a fragment of\na plane bounded by segments of straight lines. However, a polygon can also be\nviewed as a collection of distinct points (called vertices) connected by\nstraight lines with the constraint that exactly two lines meet at ('very\nvortex. The lines are the sides of the polygon. This transition from a filled-\nin polygon to one which is a circuit of edges is analogous to the transition\nfrom a solid polyhedron to a surface discussed in Chaptei 5. For the moment,\nwe shall restrict attention to planar polygons, those1 whoso vertices lie in a\nplane. Some examples are illustrated in Figure 7.1. At first sight,\n\n250 Chapter 7 it appears that some of the polygons in the figure do not\nsatisfy the lequhement that exactly two sides meet at every vertex. However,\nthe points whore four line segments meet are not vertices; they are points\nwhere two sides pass thiough each other. Figure 7.1. Some general polygons. In\nthe special case of a regular convex polygon, all of the vertices lie on a\ncircle and are equally spaced around it. The sides of the polygon join\nadjacent vertices on the circle. If these vertices are connected in any other\nwav then the resulting polygon must have some sides which pass through each\nother. If all the sides are the same length, so that they connect vertices\nwhich are the same distance apart on the circle, then a regular star polygon\nis formed. For example, in a pentagram the five vertices are equally spaced\naround a circle and the sides connect every second vertex. Regular star\npolygons share many of the properties of the traditional (convex) regular\npolygons: equal angles at the vertices, equal length sides, the vortices all\nlie on a circle, as do the midpoints of all the sides. One feature which\ndistinguishes a convex polygon from a star polygon is the number of times it\nwinds around a point in its interior. If you trace along the sides of a\nregular convex polygon then, when you return to the starting point, you will\nhave encircled the centre point of the polygon exactly once. However, if you\nrepeat this procedure on a regular star polygon, you will wind around the\ncentre more than once before letiacing youi path. In the case of the star\npentagon, you go round twice. The star pentagon is said to cover its centre\npoint twice. Another way to find this covering number is to count the number\nof times a line from the centre of the polygon to a point outside it crosses\nthe sides of the polygon. The line should avoid vertices and places where\nsides pass tluough one another. For a convex polygon, the line has to cross\none side to leach the exterior. For the star pentagon it must cross two. This\nmethod woiks loi any polygon so long as all the interior angles are less than\n180°.' 'It can be made to work for general polygons by careful counting The\npolygon h;is to bo oriented and the direction taken into account each time a\nside is ciossod.\n\nPOINSOT'S STAR POLYHEDRA 251 Figure 7.2. A pyramid with a pentagram base. The\nnotion of covering number can be extended to polyhedra. Here, we will restrict\nattention to polyhedra whose dihedral angles are all less than 180°. We say\nthat a polyhedron covers a point in its interior n times if a line from the\ncentre of the polyhedron to the exterior intersects n faces of the polyhedron.\nAs before, the line should avoid the vertices, edges and other places where\nthe faces intersect each other. For example, M. C. Escher's cut-away diagram\nof the small stellated dodecahedron (Figure 4.18) helps us to see that it\ncovers an interior point twice. Poinsot's star polyhedra Early in the\nnineteenth century, unaware of the previous work by Keplei, Louis Poinsot\n(1777-1859) investigated the possibility that polyhedra could be built from\nthese generalised polygons. He allowed star polygons to be used as faces but,\nunlike Kepler, he also investigated the possibility that vertex figures could\nbe star polygons. Recall that a vertex figure is a (spherical) polygon which\ndescribes how the faces are arranged around a vertex. It is formed as the\nintersection of the faces that meet at a vertex with a small sphere centred on\nthat vertex. Figure 7.2 shows an inverted pyramid with a pentagram base. The\nvertex figures at the base are all isosceles triangles, and the vertex figure\nof the apex is a star pentagon. Since the pentagram covers its centre point\ntwice, we say that the triangular faces cycle around the vertex twice. In\ngeneral, if a vertex figure covers its centre point n times then the faces\nmeeting there will cycle around the vertex n times Poinsot begins his paper by\ndiscussing the properties of generalised polygons. When he turns his attention\nto polyhedra, he notes that the proofs which show that there can be at most\nfive regular polyhedra depend on an implicit assumption: Until now, we have\nknown only five perfectly regular bodies, that is to\n\n252 Chapter 7 say those formed from equal regular polygons, equally inclined\nto one another, and assembled with the same number around each vertex. By\nimposing these conditions, we suppose it is impossible to construct any more\nand that the ancient geometers were able to make a complete enumeration.\nFirst, it is necessary to have at least three planes to form a solid angle,\nand then the sum of the plane angles which form the solid angle must be less\nthan four right angles. ■ • ■ However, I observe that of these two conditions,\nonly the first is absolutely necessary, the other is associated in general\nwith what is called convexity. I say in general because this condition, that\nthe sum of the angles around each vertex is less than four right angles, does\nnot always lead to a convex surface: one which has the property that no line\ncuts the surface in more than two points. But one tacitly supposes this third\ncondition, so much so that we only make the five combinations which give rise\nto the five regular bodies that we know. But if, while conserving the general\ndefinition of regular solid, we extend the idea of convexity, we see the\npossibility to construct new regular polyhedra, not only with the new polygons\nI have just considered but even with the ordinary regular polygons.0. For\nPoinsot, there is the hidden assumption that regular polyhedra are convex. In\nthe above passage he states the modern very restrictive definition of\nconvexity: no straight line meets the polyhedron in more than two points. This\ndefinition can be applied to any geometric object. However, in his discussion\nof polygons, he suggests that an alternative definition of convexity would be\nto require that all the interior angles of a polygon be less than 180°. Under\nthis notion of convexity, the regular star polygons would then be considered\nconvex. He proposes a similar alternative for polyhedra: a polyhedron is\nconvex if all its dihedral angles are less than 180°. Under this definition,\npolyhedra like Kepler's pair made up of pentagrams are convex. Poinsot\ndescribes another example. Recall that the Platonic icosahedron can be\ndecomposed into a pentagonal anti- prism and two pentagonal pyramids. This\nshows that a pentagon can be inscribed in the icosahedron (see Figure 7.3(a)).\nDo this in as many ways as possible and you end up with twelve pentagons which\npass through each other (Figure 7.3(b)). If we define an edge to be the line\nwhere the sides of two pentagons are joined, and ignore the other\nintersections, then we get a polyhedron. Its edges and vertices happen to be\nthe same as those of the original icosahedron. Furthermore, all its dihedral\nangles are equal and are less than 180°. So, according to Poinsot, this is\nanother regular convex polyhedron. Curiously, a very similar looking figure\ncan be found among Wenzel Jamnitzer's sketches in his Perspectiva Corporum\nRegularium: see the centre-left of his plate reproduced in Figure 3.16.\n\nPoinsot's star polyhedra 253 In Legendre's proof of Euler's formula (see\nChapter 5), the polyhedron is projected onto an enclosed sphere to produce a\nnetwork of spherical polygons. The areas of these polygons can be expressed in\nterms of the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of the original polyhedron.\nEquating their total area to the area of the sphere produces the proof.\nPoinsot used a similar idea to derive a formula which must be satisfied by his\ngeneralised regular polyhedra. This then allowed him to deduce some possible\nstructures for them. His argument runs as follows. Suppose that the faces of a\nstar polyhedron are equal regular polygons of the conventional kind, and that\nthe vertex figures are allowed to be anv legular polygon—simple or star.\nSuppose that all the faces of such a polvhedion are p-gons, and that all the\nvertices are surrounded in the same manner with q faces coming together at\neach vertex and cycling around it n times. Suppose also that the whole\npolyhedron covers an interior point N times. This polyhedron can be projected\nonto an inscribed sphere to give a network of vertices, edges, and spherical\npolygons. The spherical polygons are all equal and regrrlai so all the\ninterior angles of these polygons are equal. Let a denote this common\nirrterior angle. At the vertices of the network, q spherical polygons come\ntogether arrd the total angle formed by all the polygons at the vertex is qa.\nThese faces rrrake n complete cycles around the vertex so the total angle is\nalso 1-nn. Eqrrating these gives 77, 27T77, = qa which implies a = 27r—. 9 The\narea of each of the spherical p-gons is given by pa — (p — 2)n = p • 27T— —\np-n + 2n. Q Suppose that the polyhedron has F faces. Then the sum of the areas\nof these (a) (b) Figure 7.3. The great dodecahedron (right).\n\n254 Chapter 7 faces must equal the area of the sphere multiplied by the number\nof times it is covered by the polyhedron. Thus F(p -27T- -pn + 2-n) = AirN and\ndividing through by n gives F(2p--p + 2) = 4N. Poinsot used this last formula\nto deduce possible forms of star polyhedra. The formula has five variables so,\nin order to explore the possibilities, some of them must be fixed and the\nconsequences of the choice followed through. Wo can choose to concentrate on a\nparticular kind of face, or covering, 01 anv other combination of the\nvariables. Firstly, we can check that the formula holds for conventional\npolvhodra. In this case, a polyhedron covers its insphere once and the faces\ncycle around each vertex once so we substitute N = 1 and n = 1. If we further\nsuppose that all the faces are equilateral triangles then p is set to 3.\nSubstitutirrg all these values into the formula gives F(2 x3x--3 + 2) = 4x1. v\nQ ' Rearranging this, we get a formula relating the number of faces of the\npolvhedron to the valency of its vertices. There must be at least three faces\naround any vertex so q ^ 3. For q = 3 wo have F — 4 giving the regular\ntetrahedron. When q = 4 wo get F — 8 giving the regular octahedron, and when q\n= 5, we get F = 20, the regular icosahedron. For any other value of </, F is\nundefined or negative which does not make serrse for a polyhedron. Varying the\nvalue of p while keeping iV and n fixed at 1 shows (yet again) that there are\nat most five Platonic polyhedra. New possibilities arise when the traditional\nviewpoint is enlarged to allow star polygons as vertex figures. The simplest\nsuch figure is the star pentagon. If a polyhedron has star pentagon vertex\nfigures then five faces meet at overv vertex and they cycle around it twice.\nThis gives us q = 5 and n = 2. If wo continue to concentrate on polyhedra\nwhose faces are equilateral triangles then, again, we have p — 3. Substituting\nthese values into Poinsot's formula gives / 2 N F{2 x3x--3 + 2j = 47V which\nreduces to IF = 20iV.\n\nPoinsot's star polyhedra 255 The smallest values of F and N which satisfy this\nequation are F — 20 and N — 7. This suggests the possible existence of a\npolyhedron having twenty triangular faces which come together at the vertices\nin sets of five aiianged to give star pentagon vertex figures. This polyhedron\nwould cover an enclosed sphere seven times. Remarkably, such a polyhedron does\nexist! It is shown in Figuio 7.4 and Plate 9. The shaded regions in the figure\nare the visible parts of one of the triangular faces. Figure 7.4. The great\nicosahedron. Continuing this investigation of polyhedra with triangular faces,\nthe next simplest star polygon which could appear as a vertex figure is a stai\nheptagon. There are two star heptagons, one which covers an inscribed circle\ntwice, the other three times. Substituting the values p = 3, q = 7, n = 2 into\nthe formula leads to the equation 5F = 28iV and substituting the values p = 3,\nq = 7,n = S gives 11F = 287V. The problem now arises as to whether or not\npolyhedra can be constructed which have the required properties. Poinsot's\nformula gives conditions which must be satisfied by a generalised regular\npolyhedron, but does every set of values foi p, q, n, N, and F which satisfy\nthe formula correspond to an actual polyhedron? In particular, can either of\nthese potential polyhedra with star heptagon vertex figures be realised? We\nshall return to this problem later. The investigation can be continued using\nother star polygons as veitex figures and different polygons for the faces. In\nthe case of pentagonal faces meeting with\n\n256 Chapter 7 star pentagon vertex figures we get p = 5, q = 5 and n = 2.\nThese values substituted into the formula give F = 4iV. The solution F = 12\nand .V = 3 of this equation corresponds to the polyhedron described earlier\n(sec1 Figure 7.3). Poinsot also considered whether the star polygons can be\nused as faces of polyhedra and rediscovered the two polyhedra described by\nKepler 200 vears earlier. However, they are not produced through a careful\nanalysis like the other two star polyhedra but are introduced as completed\nobjects. He notes that thev can be constructed by extending the sides of the\npentagons in both the Platonic dodecahedron and his new star dodecahedron to\nform star pentagons This is perhaps how he discovered them. He therefore knew\nof four star polyhedra: two with star pentagon face's one of which has three\nfaces surrounding a vertex, the othei has five face's surrounding each vertex;\none with triangular faces meeting in fives so that the veitex figuies are star\npentagons; and one with pentagonal faces also having stai pentagon vertex\nfigures. Poinsot's conjecture Hero is a question which deseives investigation\nbut which seems diilU ult to ievolve rigorously1' L Poinsot Having found four\nstar polyhedra, Poinsot naturally desired to know whethei he had found all the\npossibilities. He observed that the face planes of each of these four\npolyhedra coincide with those of a Platonic solid (either the dodecahedron or\nthe icosahedron) and he wondered whether this would be hue of all legulai star\npolyhedra. He put forward evidence for and against this hypothesis but was\nunable to decide one way or the other. First he argued that one can start to\nbuild a model of anv regulai stai polyhedron. Imagine constructing a model of\na triangular-faced polvhedion wheie seven faces meet at each vertex and so\nthat they cycle around a veitex twice Start with seven equilateral triangles\nand arrange them around a veitex so that they are equally inclined to each\nother, and proceed to build up the model bv attaching triangles, completing\nvertices or forming new ones. If this assembly of triangles closes up then the\nnumber of faces will be a multiple of 28 and the lesult- ing polyhedron will\ncover an inscribed sphere the same multiple of 3 times The crucial point is\nwhether the polyhedron ever closes up or whethei an unlimited number of\ntriangles can be assembled without this happening. If such a polyhedron does\nexist then its inscribed sphere will touch the eentie of every face, and these\ntouching points will be evenly and unifornilv distiibuted\n\nCayley's formula 237 over the sphere. These points can be regarded as the\nvertices of a convex-' polyhedron sitting inside the sphere. Poinsot is now\ncaught in a dilemma. On one hand he cannot see any reason why this convex\npolyhedron, whose1 veitices arc uniformly and regularly distributed over the\nsphere, should be anything other than a regular polyhedron. This would resolve\nthe problem of whether or not the polyhedron imagined above can be\nconstructed. If such a polyhedron did exist, the number of its faces, and\nhence the number of vertices of the convex polyhedron inside the sphere, would\nbe a multiple of 28. But none of the convex legulai polyhedra has a number of\nvertices which is a multiple of 28, so the polyhedron cannot exist. On the\nother hand, what does it mean to say that a set of points is legulai lv\ndistributed on a sphere? Is a convex polyhedron which has such a set of points\nfor vertices necessarily a regular solid? After all, the 30 midpoints of the\nedges of a regular icosahedron all lie on a sphere, and this is surely an\nevenly distiUnited arrangement of points. However, these points are not the\nvertices of a Platonic figure but of an Archimedean solid—the icosi-\ndodecahedron composed of triangles and pentagons. Another Archimedean solid\nresults from the midpoints of the edges of a cube: the cub-octahedron. If the\nface centres of a legulai star polyhedron were distributed over a sphere like\nthe 30 midpoints of the edges of an icosahedron then his previous argument\nwould not apply. In this discussion, Poinsot displays two competing thought\npiocesses which mathematicians go through when trying to determine the truth\nof a conjecture. While considering a possible method for proving his\nconjectuie, Poinsot is also looking for obstacles to his strategy. A knowledge\nof the situations when1 a method fails is often very useful. Sometimes the\nobstacles can be overcome; sometimes a new strategy of attack is required; in\nother situations they can lead to new examples which require the original\nconjecture to be modified or abandoned. As Poinsot remarks, one of the things\nwhich makes the theoiv of polyhedra so difficult is the ease with which the\nstudy of a few isolated examples leads to speculation and conjecture about\npolyhedra in general. Cayley's formula An appendix to Poinsot's paper shows\nhow Euler's formula can be geneialised so that it applies to polyhedra with\nstar polygon vertex figures. Suppose1 a polyhedron covers an enclosed sphere N\ntimes and that the faces which meet at a veit.ex cycle around it n times.\nUsing Legendre's proof as a basis, Poinsot showed that nV + F = E + 2N. 2From\nhere onwards, convex has its modern restrictive meaning: an object is (onvex\nif it meets any straight line in at most two points.\n\n258 Chapter 7 where V, E and F denote the number of vertices, edges and faces\n(as usual) When TV and n equal one this reduces to Euler's original formula.\nThe ft >i inula fails to work when the faces are star polygons. Some 50 years\nlater, Arthur Cayley presented a different way of measuring the number of\ntimes a star polyhedron covers an enclosed sphere. This nuinbei has come to be\ncalled the density of a polyhedron. Density is calculated in a similar way to\nthe covering number: we count the number of times a line from the centre of\nthe polyhedron to its exterior cuts the faces. The difference is that we take\ninto account how many 'layers' of each face the line goes through Convex\npolygons have only a single layer so the density of a polyhedron with convex\nfaces is the same as its covering number. For star polygon faces, the number\nof layers depends upon which point of the polygon the line passes through. The\nsides of a planar polygon divide up the plane into regions, and the number of\nlayers is constant in each region. To work out how manv lavers of a polygon\ncover a region, trace a path around the polygon and count how main- t hues you\nwind around a point inside the region before retracing your steps Foi example,\nthe five corner regions of a pentagram have only one layer, but the cential\nlegion has two layers (see Figure 7.5). We also define the density of a\npolygon to be its greatest thickness. For star polygons this is the same as\nits covering number. Figure 7.5. The layers of a pentagram. With this new way\nof counting the intersections of the faces with a line, we can find the\ndensity of the star polyhedron in Escher's sketch (Figure 4.18). A line from\nthe interior of the polyhedron will pass through the central legion of one\nface, and a corner region of another. The first intersection passes tiuough\ntwo layers, and the second intersection contributes only one lavei. Theietore.\nthe density of the polyhedron is 3. Using the idea of density, Cayley was able\nto obtain a generalised version of Euler's formula which is satisfied by all\nfour of Poinsot's star polvhedia and in which the symmetry between V and F is\nrestored. If dy and dF aie the densities of the vertex figures and of the\nfaces respectively, and D is the density of the polyhedron then dvV + dFF = E\n+ 2D. Again, when all the densities are 1, this reduces to Euler's original\nformula.\n\nCauchy's enumeration of star polyhedra 259 The names which Cayley used for\nPoinsot's four star polyhedra have become their accepted English names. The\none with 20 triangular faces is called the qreat icosahedron, the one with 12\npentagonal faces is called the great dodecahedron. The two polyhedra which\nhave 12 star pentagonal faces are called the small stellated dodecahedron and\nthe great stellated dodecahedron, the small one having 12 vertices, the great\nhaving 20 vertices. Cauchy's enumeration of star polyhedra The problem of how\nmany regular star polyhedra can be constructed was resolved by Augustin Louis\nCauchy in 1812. His solution, together with his proof of Euler's formula,\nformed the contents of his first paper. Using concepts that we would now call\nsymmetry and transitivity, he interpreted what is meant by regularity in a new\nway. However, it is important to remember that the fundamentals of symmetry\nwere not fully developed until later in the nineteenth centuiv when\ncrystallographers used symmetry to explain the shape and structure of\ncrystals. Cauchy applied the principles of rotational symmetry in an intuitive\nway. Rather than use the standard definition of regularity, which requires the\ncongruence of the faces, solid angles and dihedral angles, he observed that\nall the Platonic solids can be superposed on themselves in more than one way.\nFor example, let P and Q be two cubes of equal size. We can choose a face of\neach cube and then superpose P on Q so that the chosen faces are also\nsuperposed. This is possible because all the faces of a cube play equivalent\nroles in its structure. Furthermore, having aligned the chosen faces, we can\nchoose a side of each face and superpose the cubes in such a way that both the\nchosen faces and their chosen edges coincide. The classical definition of\nregularity forces a regular polyhedron to possess Cauchy's 'multiple\ncoincidence' property. The defining properties are sufficiently explicit to be\nused as a set of instructions for making a regular polvhedion. All you need to\nknow is what kind of polygon to use for the faces and how many to place around\neach vertex. You start by taking a regular polygon to form the first face.\nThen take another polygon and attach it to the first. Since both polygons are\nthe same, and both are regular, it makes no difference which two sides are\njoined to make the first edge. A vertex can be built up by surrounding it with\nthe appropriate number of polygons. Since all the dihedral angles must be the\nsame, each vertex figure must be a regular polygon. Thus, there is no choice\nin the shape of the solid angle. Continue to add faces building up the model\nuntil it closes up. At no stage in the process is there a choice: the faces\nare all the same, the solid angles are all the same, the faces are rigid, the\nvertex figures aie ligid. When you examine the completed model, you cannot\ntell how the polyhedron was constructed. All the faces and vertices are\nequivalent. Knowing the instruc-\n\n260 Chapter 7 tions does not help because everything looks the same. You\ncannot tell which was the first face. It is because the construction could\nhave started with anv face, and the rules completely determine the rest of the\nshape, that the polvhedron can be superposed on itself in the way Cauchy\nobserved. With a slight modification to the rules, this description of\nbuilding up a regular polyhedron applies to star polyhedra as well as to the\nPlatonic solids To describe Poinsot's polyhedra, it is no longer sufficient to\ngive only the valence of the vertices: one must give the vertex figure. This\nproperty of regular polyhedra can also be used in reverse as a definition of\nregularity. The fact that any face can be superposed on any othei means that\nall the faces are congruent. Furthermore, since each face can be rotated to\nsuperpose one side on any other side, the faces must be regular polygons. By\ncombining these operations we can superpose an edge of the polyhedion on any\nother so all the dihedral angles must be the same. In this way, we can lecover\nthe classical definition from Cauchy's observation—the two viewpoints are\nequivalent. With this new way of thinking about regularity we can now turn our\nattention to Cauchy's solution of Poinsot's question. Lemma. The face-planes\nof a regular star polyhedron coincide with those of a Platonic solid. Proof:\nSuppose you have two copies of a regular polyhedron. One can be brought into\ncoincidence with the other in several ways. Firstly, a face of one can be\nsuperposed on any face in the other. Furthermore, any side of the face in the\nfirst polyhedron can be paired with any side of the chosen face in the second\ncopy of the polyhedron. This is possible for both convex and star regulai\npolvhedia. Now imagine yourself transported to the centre of a regular star\npolyhedron If the faces are opaque then your view of the polyhedron will be\nlimited to a convex kernel whose faces lie in the face-planes of the star\npolyhedron What happens to this kernel when the star polyhedron is superposed\non a second star polyhedron? The face-planes of the second star polvhedion aie\nthe same as those of the first so the kernels of the two polyhedra coincide.\nSince a face of the first star polyhedron can be superposed on any face of the\nsecond stai polyhedron, a face of the first kernel can be superposed on any\nface of the second kernel. Therefore, the faces of the convex kernel are all\ncongruent. This implies (via a corollary of Euler's formula) that its faces\nhave three1, four or five sides. Because we can align a given side of a face\nin the first star polvhedion with any side of the chosen face in the second, a\nface of the kernel can be supeiposed on itself in more than one way. If the\nfaces of the star polvhedion have n sides then each face of the kernel can be\nrotated onto itself in at least it ways If the faces of the kernel have p\nsides then p must be a multiple of ?/. But p = 3. 4 or\n\nCauchy's enumeration of star polyhedra 2G1 5 and n is at least 3. So, in fact,\np = n. This means that a side of a face of the first kernel can be superposed\non any side of the chosen face in the second kernel Thus, the kernel is a\nconvex regular solid. ■ This lemma answers Poinsot's question 'Do the face-\nplanes of a lcgulai star polyhedron have to coincide with those of a Platonic\nsolid?' in the aiiiimative and so excludes his two hypothetical examples\nhaving triangular faces and stai heptagon vertex figures. However, we still\nneed to show that he found all the possibilities. To enumerate the star\npolyhedra, Cauchy analysed the faces of the Platonic solids to see which could\nbe extended to bound regular polygons. In the case of the cube it is easy to\nsee that its face-planes never meet again when thev aie extended. They bound\nonly the cube. The same is true of the tetiahedion. The other cases need more\ncareful consideration. First, we observe that the face-planes of the\noctahedron, dodecahedron, and the icosahedron come in parallel pairs. If we\nplace a model of one of them on a table, there is a natural choice of a base\nface (in contact with the table sin face) and a top face (opposite the base).\nTo construct regular star polvhedia we shall examine the possible wavs that\ngroups of faces can be extended to bound a leguhu polygon in the top face-\nplane. For a set of face-planes to intersect the top face- plane in lines that\nbound a regular polygon, they must be arranged syniinetiieallv around the axis\npassing through the centres of the top and the base. We shall refer to such a\nsymmetrically placed set of faces as a group. The faces of the octahedron can\nbe divided into four groups, the top. the base, the three faces adjacent to\nthe top, and the three adjacent to the base. The base and the top are parallel\nand do not meet. The faces adjacent to the top bound only the top face and do\nnot give anything new. The thiee face-planes adjacent to the base do bound a\nnew regular polygon in the top face-plane a triangle whose sides are twice as\nlong as those of the octahedron (Figuie 7 6). Four of these triangles form a\nPlatonic tetrahedron. When all eight of the face's of the octahedron are\nextended to form these triangles, Kepler's Stella octangula is formed. This is\na compound polyhedron and not what we are seaiching foi Figure 7.6.\n\n262 Chapter 7 (a) (b) (c) Figure 7.7. face-plane (Figure 7.7(a)).

As usual, the top, the base, and the three faces adjacent to the top\nare three of them. To see the otheis, label each of the faces adjacent to the\nbase 'A', and apply successive1 letters to the faces around its top vertex as\nshown in Figure 7.8. Each set of three face- planes labelled with a given\nletter forms a group. When searching for regular polygons in the top face-\nplane we need only consider these five lettered gioups of face-planes—the\nother groups clearly do not bound any new polygons. Figure 7.9 shows the\npolygons formed by groups 'A', 'C and 'E'. The shading indicates which faces\nbelong to the group. The three face-planes labelled 'A' bound a large triangle\nwhich is the face of the great icosahedron (see Figure 7.9(c)). The three\nface-planes of group 'C or of group 'D' deteiniine a smaller triangle (Figure\n7.9(a)), eight of which fit together to form a Platonic octahedron. When all\nthe faces are extended in this manner a compound of five octahedra is produced\n(see Plate 13). The three face-planes of group 'B' oi of group lE' determine\nanother triangle, one of intermediate size (Figure 7.9(b)). Four of them fit\ntogether to form a Platonic tetrahedron. Extending all the faces in this way\nproduces a compound of five tetrahedra (see Plate 12). This completes Cauchy's\nexhaustive search for regular star polyhedia. Only the four described by\nPoinsot are produced. Face-stellation The process of producing new polyhedra\nby extending the faces of a given one is called face-stellation. It was first\ndescribed by Kepler. Although he probably discovered his star polyhedra by\nextending edges rather than faces, he knew that the small stellated\ndodecahedron could be obtained from the Platonic dodecahedron by face-\nstellation. The stellation process may seem clear enough but there is some\nambiguity about how we should interpret the result. For example, is the great\ndodecahedron composed of twelve regular pentagons, or 60 isosceles triangles.\nIs a stellated polyhedron a solid whose face-planes coincide with those of the\noriginal (solid)\n\n264 Chapter 7 Figure 7.9. polyhedron, is it the bounding surface of such a\nsolid, or is it a set of intersecting polygons. This freedom of interpretation\nmeans that there are complementary ways to think about the process of face-\nstellation. Cauchy's approach is essentially two- dimensional: choose one\nface-plane and see how the others intersect it. From the information in this\none plane, we then deduce possible faces for stellated forms. Another approach\nis three-dimensional: the stellations are thought of as being built up from\nlayers of solid cells. To show how these different means of expression\n\nFace-stellation 265 The three-dimensional approach. Each face of a convex\npolyhedron lies in a unique plane, and the set of all these face-planes\npartitions space into a collection of cells. The original polyhedron must be\none of the cells, and there will always be some unbounded cells. The situation\nbecomes interesting when there is more than one bounded cell. This happens\nwhen the dihedral angles of the polyhedron are greater than 90°. The bounded\ncells come in layers surrounding the central, core polyhedron. They can be\nstuck together to form new polyhedra whose faces will lie in the same planes\nas those of the original polyhedron. A regular dodecahedron is surrounded by\nthree kinds of finite cell. The first layer consists of twelve pentagonal-\nbased pyramids (see Figure 7.10). The second layer consists of 30 wedges that\nsit between the pyramids. The wedge on the left of Figure 7.11 sits behind and\nto the right of the pyramid. Notice how each successive layer completely\ncovers the faces of the previous layer. The final layer of cells is a set of\n20 spikes each of which is an asymmetric triangular dipyramid. These fit into\nthe hollows between the wedges. On the left of Figure 7.12 the sharp end of\nthe spike points backwards, and the spike fits in a depression hidden from\nview on the upper right of the second stellation. The figures are all drawn to\nthe same scale. Figure 7.10. The first stellation of the dodecahedron is built\nfrom a layer of 12 pyramids. Figure 7.11. The second stellation of the\ndodecahedron is built from a layer of 30 wedges.\n\nChapter 7 Figure 7.12. The third stellation of the dodecahedron is built from\na layer of 20 spikes. The two-dimensional approach. If we place a dodecahedron\non a table, there is a unique plane parallel to the table top containing its\ntop face. The plane containing the base does not meet this top face-plane, but\neach of the other ten face-planes do. The five planes adjacent to the top face\nintersect the top face-plane in five lines. These lines bound the top\npentagonal face and also form a star pentagon (Figure 7.7(a)). When the five\nplanes containing the faces adjacent to the base are extended to meet the top\nface-plane, five more lines of intersection are produced which pass through\nthe vertices of this pentagram (Figure 7.7(c)). These ten lines of\nintersection form a pattern called a stellation pattern. It is shown in Figure\n7.13. As the dodecahedron is regular, all its faces are equivalent and the\nstellation patterns formed in all the face-planes are all the same. The\nstellation pattern contains four kinds of bounded region. In this case, each\nkind of region corresponds to a dodecahedral form. Take the central pentagon\nfrom each face-plane and you reconstruct the original dodecahedron. Take all\nthe small acute-angled isosceles triangles from each face-plane and the first\nstellation appears. The obtuse-angled isosceles triangles form the second\nstellation— the great dodecahedron. The remaining triangles form the great\nstellated dodecahedron. The lines in the stellation pattern do not bound any\nmore finite regions and so this is the last of the dodecahedron stellations.\n\nStellations of the icosahedron 267 Figure 7.13. The stellation pattern of the\ndodecahedron. In a more complex stellation pattern, such as that of the\nicosahedron, the regions have to be chosen carefully. Just selecting\ncorresponding regions in each face-plane may result in a set of disconnected\npolygons with free edges not attached to other faces. To enumerate the\nstellated forms, it is necessary to work out which sets of regions fit\ntogether to form closed polyhedra. Stellations of the icosahedron All the\nstellations of the dodecahedron happen to be regular star polyhedra. Stel-\nlating the icosahedron, on the other hand, is far more challenging. Its\nstellation pattern is shown in Figure 7.14. It consists of the 18 lines where\na face-plane is met by the face-planes of all the faces except the opposite\none (which is parallel to it). These lines divide the face-plane into 66\nfinite regions, in addition to the central triangle which is a face of the\nicosahedron. Try to imagine how many face patterns can be built by piecing\nthese together in different ways. We can also consider this abundance of\npossibilities from the three-dimensional viewpoint. The 20 face-planes of the\nicosahedron partition space into 473 bounded cells of some 11 or 12 kinds\n(depending on whether you class mirror images as the same or different). With\nsuch a large number of blocks from which to start building up stellations,\nsome care is needed in deciding which sets of cells are to be counted as\nproper stellated forms. Although we can construct 212 — 1 combinations of\ncells from the icosahedral decomposition of space, this does not mean we can\nbuild over 4000 stellations of the icosahedron. We need to decide which\ncombinations should be included. What should be the acceptance criteria by\nwhich we judge their validity? What properties should a stellation possess?\n\n268 Chapter 7 Figure 7.14. The stellation pattern of the icosahedron. A few\nexamples of stellations of the icosahedron were known, and recognised as such,\nat the turn of the twentieth century. Sonic are identified in Max Bruckner's\nbook Vieiecice und Viclflache published in 1900. Besides the great icosahedron\n(Plate 9) and the compounds of five octahedra (Plate 13) and five and ten\ntetrahedra (Plate 12) known to Cauchy, he described six otheis. Thev are shown\namong the Figures 7.15-7.33 and Plate 10. All the stellations in the figures\nare drawn on the same scale and from the same viewpoint. Nine more stellations\nwere discovered by Albert Harry Wheeler bringing the\n\nStellations of the icosahedron 2G9 total to 19 stellated forms plus the\nicosahedron itself. Most of his stellations are shown in the figures. One of\nthem (Figure 7.27) is cheiral like the compound of five tetrahedra. Inspired\nby Wheeler, an exhaustive search was made for more stellations. As mentioned\nabove, in order to perform such an enumeration, a definition of what is meant\nby 'stellation' is required. The following criteria were proposed !>v •). C.\nP. Miller. (i) The faces of the stellated form must lie in the face-planes of\nthe original polyhedron. (li) All the regions composing the faces must be the\nsame in each plane; these regions need not be connected. (m) The regions\nincluded in a plane must have the same rotational symmetry as a face of the\noriginal polyhedron. Together with (n), this implies that the stellation\nprocess preserves the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron. (iv) The\nregions included in a plane must be accessible in the completed stellation.\n(v) Compounds of simpler stellations are excluded. More specifically, we\ndisallow unions of two stellations with no face-to-face contact except\ncombinations of mirror images. Applying these rules to the manifold\npossibilities reduces their number substantially. There remain 31 stellations\nwith mirror symmetry, and 27 cheiial stellations (or pairs of enantiomorphs).\nThe complete list was published in 1938 in a delightful little booklet called\nThe Fifty-nine Icosahedra. Of the four authors J. F. Petrie produced the fine\nillustrations, H. T. Flather made a complete set of models which are now\nhoused in the Mathematics Department at Cambridge3, and H. S. M. Coxeter and\nPatrick Du Val wrote the text each supplying a different method of\nenumeration. Coxeter used the two-dimensional approach and Du Val worked with\ncells. Another problem to be overcome is how to describe each stellation in a\nsystematic and economical way. The method Du Val used to solve this problem\nwas to classify the cells into their various kinds and then list the\ncombination of cell types which forms each stellation. As an example, we shall\napply the method to the dodecahedron to see how it works. A number can be\nassociated with each cell which is a measure of its distance1 from the central\ncell—the dodecahedron itself. The index of a cell is the number of 3They can\nbe viewed by appointment. Write to the Head of the Department of Mathematics,\nUniversity of Cambridge, 16 Mill Lane, Cambridge. CB2 1SB. England.\n\n270 Chapter 7 face-planes a straight line from the cell to the centre passes\nthrough (compare this with the definition of covering number or density). So,\nfor example, dodecahedron cells have following indices: 0 : the dodecahedron 1\n: the 12 pyramids 2 : the 30 wedges 3 : the 20 spikes. A layer of cells is\ndefined to be all the cells that have a given index. These laveis form a\nseries of concentric shells which envelop the core. Each layer is denoted by a\nlower-case letter running in sequence from the centre outwards. Thus the\ndodecahedron is layer a, the pyramids are layer b, the wedges are lavei c. and\nthe spikes are layer d. When describing stellations it is also helpful to have\nsymbols for the set of all cells with index less than or equal to a given\nnumbei. These are denoted by upper-case letters. The set of all cells of index\nat most 0 (which is just the central dodecahedron) is denoted A. The set of\ncells with index at most 1 (the small stellated dodecahedron) is denoted B.\nSimilarly, the great dodecahedron, denoted C, is formed by adding layer c to\nB. The third stellation. D, is the set of all (bounded) cells taken together.\nFor any initial polyhedron, the stellations A, B, C, D, E, ... arc called the\nmain sequence. They form a natural progression and are the oidv stellations\nthat can be sensibly ordered: B is the first stellation, C is the second, and\nso on. Notice that Wheeler did not find the entire main sequence foi the\nicosahedion he missed E (Figure 7.18). All the stellations in the main\nsequence of the icosahedion aie illustiated here. Figure 7.15(b) shows\nstellations A, B and C. The triakis tcosaltcilron. B, is formed by erecting a\npyramid on each face of the icosahedion. (The term 'triakis' is borrowed from\ncrystallography.) C is the compound of five octahe- dra. Figure 7.17 shows the\nresult of extending the faces of this compound until they meet again. Figure\n7.20 shows the sixth stellation, G, familial as Poinsot's great icosahedron.\nThe final stellation, H, composed of all the cells, is shown in Plate 10. It\nis known as the complete icosahedron. This system of nomenclature can be used\nto label the cells and then combinations which arise by stellating any convex\npolyhedron. In the case of the icosahedron the situation becomes more\ncomplicated, and more interesting, because three of the eight layers contain\ndifferent kinds of cell. One lavei even contains cheiral cells. Layers e and g\ncan both be separated into two kinds of cells. These are denoted ei (shown in\nFigure 7.21) and e2, gi (shown in Figure 7.30) and g2. All four of these\nstellations exhibit an unusual featuie which has not appeared in stellations\nseen earlier. They are not polvhedia in the sense\n\nStellations of the icosahedron 271 of the polyhedral surfaces described in\nChapter 5 but have singulai points where they are vertex-connected. Other\nstellations of the icosahedron, such as fi, are edge-connected having more\nthan two faces meeting at an edge. Those aio naturally occurring instances of\nHessel's counter-examples to Euler's formula (see Figure 5.15). Layer f is the\nmost unusual of all. The cells in one sot, f2, are completely disconnected\n(see Figure 7.33). The remaining cells, fi, can be split into two mirror-image\nforms. One cheiral set is shown in Figure 7.32. It is denoted f'i note the\nchange in typeface. It is the inclusion of just one of those two cheiral sets\nthat produces the cheiral stellations such as the compound of five tctrahedra,\nEf,. By comparing the figures with one another you may begin to bo able to\nvisualise the different building blocks and the ways they combine. For\nexample, by adding cells gi (7.30) to Fg2 (7.31) we get the great icosahedron\nG (7.20). Adding gi to the compound of ten tctrahedra (7.22) produces a non-\nconvex deltahedion (7.24). The inclusion of the twelve spikes of f2 is\nespecially easy to identify. Wheeler's cheiral stellation (7.27) is formed by\nadding them to a compound of five tetrahedra. Figures 7.24 and 7.25 show a\nsimilar relationship. The last polyhedron in Table 7.16, eifigi, has tunnels\nthrough it. It is not shown here but is easily described: it is the figure\nformed by removing De2f2 (Figuie 7.29) from Fg! (Figure 7.25). These examples\nmust suffice though there are many more. Some aio polyhedral surfaces which\nare not spherical but have tunnels through them. Some are very intricate and\nsimple line drawings of them are difficult to intoipiot. As usual, the best\nway to understand is to play with models. Figure 7.15. The icosahedron and the\nfirst two stellations in its main sequence.

Whereas\n(';mch\\ examined face-planes and reduced the problem to looking for regular\nstcllations of the Platonic solids, Bertrand concentrated on the vertices of\nstar polvhedra and ended up searching for regular polygons inside the Platonic\nsolids He claimed that his method is easiei to visualise than the stellation\nprocess and I am inclined to agree. The enumeration is based on a lemma which\nis dual to Cauchy's lemma: \"face' and 'kernel1 are replaced by 'vertex' and\n'convex hull', respectively. The rmivrj hull of a set of points is the\nsmallest convex polyhedron that contains them The vertices of the hull always\nbelong to the given set of points. The convex hull of a non-convex polyhedron\nis the just convex hull of its vertices. For example, the convex hull of the\nStella octangula is a cube. Lemma. The vertices of a regular star polyhedron\ncoincide with those of a Platonic solid. PROOF: Let P be a regular star\npolyhedron and let Q be its convex hull. The vertices of P all lie on a sphere\nso all of them are also vertices of Q. Now, P can be superposed on itself in\nmany ways. We can lotale P so tliat a given vertex of P can be aligned with\nany designated vertex of Q. Fin thei more, after the two vertices have been\nmatched, there are at least three wavs that P can be superposed on itself\n(because the vertex must be at least 3-valent). Theiefore, all the solid\nangles of the convex hull are congruent, and each solid angle can be\nsuperposed on itself in at least three ways. A corollary of Euler's formula\nimplies that the vertices of Q are 3-valent, 4-valent or 5-valent. These last\ntwo facts imply that each of the plane angles forming the solid angle can be\nsupciposed on any of the others, and similarly for the dihedral angles. Hence,\neach solid angle of the convex hull is formed from equal plane angles equally\ninclined to one anothei. Moreover, all the edges of Q have the same length.\nSince all the solid angles of Q are congruent, the plane angles in the corners\nof a face of (J aie all equal. Therefore, the faces of Q are regular polygons\nand the convex hull is a Platonic solid. ■ The next stop in Bertrand's\nenumeration of the regular star polyhedia is to search for regular polygons\ninside the Platonic solids. This step, called Juc( Uuhj, is easier to\nvisualise than the stellation process. The possibilities are illustialed in\nFigure 7.34. There are no facetted forms of the tetrahedron since the only\nregular polygons spanned by these vertices are the original faces. The\nveiticos of a cube span a triangle (Figure 7.34(b)) and four of these\ntriangles foim a legulai\n\n282 Chapter 7 tetrahedron. The vertices of an octahedron bound three squaies\n(Figuie 7.34(c)) but these do not form a polyhedron since they do not share\ncommon sides. Potentially the most fruitful case is the dodecahedron. Its\nvertices span five distinct regular polygons besides the original pentagons.\nSome of its vertices can be taken as the corners of a square (Figure 7.34(d)).\nThis is clear from Euclid's construction which circumscribes a dodecahedron\nabout a cube. There aie also two kinds of triangular face (7.34(e)-(f)). The\ntriangles of one kind do not join up, the others form tetrahedra. Another\nsubset of the dodecahedral vertices are the corners of a pentagon and\npentagram (7.34(g)-(h)). Onlv the stai pentagon can be used to form a\npolyhedron—the great stellated dodecahedron. The convex pentagons do not have\nsides in common. All the polygons in an icosahedron give rise to star\npolyhedra. As Poinsot noted, an inscribed pentagon is a face of the great\ndodecahedron (7.34(i)). A pentagram with the same vertices gives the small\nstellated dodecahedron (7.34(])). There is also a triangle which is a face of\nthe great icosahedron (7.34(k)). This exhausts the possibilities. Hence there\narc only four regulai star polvhedra. Regular skeletons Poinsot worked on his\nstar polyhedra in the first decade of the nineteenth century. This was part of\nthe period when people were trying to find a basis f'oi Euler's formula, and,\nalthough the term 'polyhedron' was interpreted in a vaiietv ofwavs, it was\nalways thought of in terms of a surface—either hollow or as the boundary of a\nsolid. This may go some way to explain why Poinsot is not consistent in his\nuse of the term 'polygon'. When he is considering polygons for their own sake,\nhe is happy to think of them as collections of line segments in the plane, but\nwhen it comes to building polyhedra, he uses the conventional filled-in kind\nof polygon for the faces, and uses his star polygons only to describe the\nvertex figures The two star-faced polyhedra that he discovered do not arise\nout of a detailed analysis like the other pair. He simply states that thev\nexist, and they can be formed by extending the sides of pentagons in polyhedia\naheadv known. Since he mentions the number of times that they cover an\ninscribed spheie, we must assume that he thought of them as being constructed\nfrom some kind of filled-in polygons. Had he been consistent, Poinsot would\nhave constituted his polyhedra from the polygons he discussed in the first\npart of his papei. In that case, a polyhedron would still be built up by\nattaching polygonal faces to each other, gluing their sides together to form\nedges, but the result would be a skeletal polyhedron—an edge framework.\nHowever, it is onlv recently that mathematicians have discarded the\npsychological crutch of filled-in polygons and staited to investigate such\nskeletal polyhedra in any depth.\n\nRegular skeletons 283 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) <J) (k) Figure 7.34.\nFacets of the Platonic solids.\n\n284 Chapter 7 The polygons that Poinsot used were all planar. In this case, it\nis sometimes helpful to 'fill-in' the faces of a polyhedron to show how it is\nput together. For example, the edge-skeleton of the Platonic icosahedron looks\nthe same as that of the great dodecahedron. How are we to know whether to\ninterpret it as a collection of 20 triangles or 12 pentagons or, indeed, in\nsome other way? Filling in the faces is one way that its internal structure\ncan be conveyed. Spanning a polygon by a piece of the plane is possible (if\nnot desirable) when the polygon is planar. However, the definition of what\nconstitutes a polygon can be expanded in several directions, and in some cases\nthere is no natural choice of a spanning membrane and even if one can be\nfound, its addition often creates more problems than it solves. As before, we\nthink of a polygon as a set of distinct points (vertices) connected by line\nsegments (sides) so that every line joins two vertices, and every vertex meets\ntwo sides. If the sides intersect only at the vertices then we have a simple\npolygon. If the vertices do not all lie in a plane then we have a skew\npolygon. Figure 7.35 shows (a) a simple skew hexagon inscribed in a cube, and\n(b) a self-intersecting skew hexagon inscribed in a triangular prism. (a) (b)\nFigure 7.35. Skew hexagons. Figure 7.36 shows how three skew 4-gons can be\njoined to form a (skeletal) polyhedron. The completed edge-skeleton looks the\nsame as that of the Platonic tetrahedron. In fact, both the skew 4-gons and\nthe polyhedron itself can be regarded as regular. The polygons are equilateral\nand their angles are all 60°. All the faces of the polyhedron are congruent,\nall its vertices are surrounded by three polygons, all the dihedral angles are\nequal, and so on. Branko Griinbaum discovered nine such regular skeletal\npolyhedra whose faces are regular skew polygons. In fact, one can be\nconstructed from each of the five Platonic solids and the four star polyhedra.\nTo find a skew face in one of these more familiar polyhedra, trace a path\nalong its edges such that each pair of adjacent edges are sides of a face of\nthe polyhedron, but no three consecutive\n\nRegular skeletons 285 4^ Figure 7.36. edges are sides of a single face. A\npolygon constructed in this manner is called a Petrie polygon after its\ndiscoverer. The skew 4-gons in Figure 7.36 arc Petrie polygons of the\ntetrahedron, and the skew hexagon in Figure 7.35(a) is a Petrie polygon of the\ncube. Table 7.37 lists the properties of Griinbaum's nine regular skeletal\npolyhedra. The first three columns describe how many faces are used, how many\nsides each face has, and the angle at the corner of each face. The symbol 10/3\ndesignates a skew polygon with ten sides which, when viewed from 'above',\nlooks like the star decagon formed by connecting every third point on a\ncircle. The fourth column states how many faces come together at each vertex\nof the polyhedron. The symbol 5/2 indicates that the vertex figure is a\npentagram. The last, column gives the Platonic or star polyhedron from which\nthe skew-faced polyhedron is derived. A further generalisation of a polygon\nwould be to allow an infinite number of vertices. In this case, we can impose\nthe restriction that the polygon is locally No. faces 3 4 4 6 6 10 10 6 6 No.\nsides 4 6 6 10 10 6 6 10/3 10/3 Angle 60° 90° 60° 108° 60° 36° 108° 36° 108°\nValence 3 3 4 3 5 5 5/2 3 5/2 Relative tetrahedron cube octahedron\ndodecahedron icosahedron small stellated dodecahedron great dodecahedron great\nstellated dodecahedron great icosahedron Table 7.37. The composition of\nGriinbaum's regular skeleta.\n\n286 Chapter 7 finite in the sense that every bounded portion of space meets\nonly finitely many sides of the polygon. The regular infinite polygons can be\nstraight, zig-zag or helical. Using only a single kind of polygon, an infinite\npolyhedron can be constructed either from an infinite number of bounded\npolygons, producing objects like tilings and honeycombs (Figure 2.19), or from\ninfinite polygons pioducing tubes or lattices. Griinbaum listed examples of\nregular infinite polyhedia along with his other examples of regular skeletal\npolyhedra. Later, Andreas Dress performed a systematic enumeration and showed\nthat this empirically discovered list was complete. We could also relax the\ncondition that vertices are distinct points. This means that different\nvertices can occupy the same position in space, not that a polygon can visit\nthe same vertex more than once. Although we defined a polygon to have distinct\nvertices, Poinsot did not make this explicit in his definition. He. Cauchy,\nand many others seem to have regarded it as an implicit condition. Gninbaum\nnoticed this in 1990. More recently he remarked: The Original Sin in the\ntheory of polyhedra goes back to Euclid, mid through Kepler, Poinsot, Cauchy,\nand many others continues to afflict all work on this topic. ■ ■ ■ The writers\nfailed to define what arc the 'polyhedra' among which they are finding the\nregular ones. ' Frustrated by the use of implicit assumptions, the\ninconsistent use of terms like 'polygon' and 'polyhedron', and the imposition\nof unnecessary restrictions in the work of many authors, he developed\nextremely general definitions of polygon and polyhedron. His definitions are\nabstract and describe 'probably the most general type of object one may wish\nto call a polyhedron'. Starting fiom this baseline, the more familiar ways of\ninterpreting what is meant by 'polvhedion' can be recovered by adding extra\nconditions. Griinbaum calls the polyhedral surface described in Chapter 5 an\nacoptic polyhedron one which does not cut itself. A polyhedron all of whose\nfaces are planar is called epipedal. At last there is now some means of\ndescribing which particular family of polyhedra one is studying. This is\nimportant when trying to enumerate polvhedra with particular properties. Even\ntrying to list the regular polyhedra is problematic unless you know which set\nof polyhedra you are investigating. Although this sounds obvious, authors\nrarely state in sufficient detail (if at all) the kinds of polyhedra that they\nare interested in. This means that results are unclear and proofs are\nincomplete. As Griinbaum remarks, the complete enumeiation of regular\npolyhedra can still be considered an outstanding problem.\n\nM—^-i From Perspectiva Corporum Rcgularium by Wcnzel Jamnitzer, 1568.\n\n289 o) Symmetry, Shape 2) and Structure Svnunctiv is to the ^coiuctn ot\n])olyhcdrn what imiul>ci theory is to niithmetic \" A Badouicau A friend once\nremarked on seeing my collection of models of some of (Ik1 stella- tions of\nthe icosahedron (Figures 7.15 7.33) that they weie like three-dimensional\nsnowfiakes. Apart from their white colour, what had triggered this analogy was\ntheir high degree of iegularity and order. Snow crystals often have six\nsimilailv shaped spikes radiating out from a central point, equally spaced\naiound it This remarkable hexagonal svmmetry is the same in many snowfiakes\neven though t hex- have such a diversity of foims, and it reflects the\nunderlying ordei of tlicit atomic structure. All the stellations of the\nicosahedron are also highly symmetrical and, although each stellation is\nunique and differs from each of the others, the nature of this symmetry is the\nsame in every case. To appreciate xvhat it means to say that two polyhedra\nhave the same type of symmetry it is necessary to find a way to describe and\nquantify this aesthetic quality of polyhedra. What do we mean by symmetry? To\nthe Greeks symmetry meant balanced and well proportioned. It xvas an ideal\nthat signified perfection. In a geometric context symmetry xvas associated\nwith commensurability. It also implied a regularity of form, and the\nharmonious relationship exhibited between the different parts of a whole. In\nthe nineteenth century attempts to explain the physical properties and shapes\nof civstals led to the development of a more precise notion of symmetry. The\nscientific tenninologv captured the intuitive notions expressed in the Greek\nideal and piovided a basis for a mathematical theory of symmetry. This made it\npossible to compaie the\n\n290 Chapter 8 symmetry properties of two objects and clarify the meaning of\nstatements like 'A dodecahedron is moie symmetrical than a square-based\npyramid\". We begin our discussion of symmetry with a fundamental question:\nWhat distinguishes a symmetrical object from an irregular one? Suppose that\nyou have a model of a symmetrical polyhedron (such as one of the Platonic\nsolids) which is well constructed so that there aie no blemishes on the faces\nto distinguish one from another. The model can be moved to a new position\nwhich cannot be distinguished from its original one. If yom eves were closed\nwhile the motion took place, when you opened them again, examining the\npolyhedron in its surroundings would not enable you to toll whethoi the model\nhad been rotated. A symmetrical polyhedron is characterised by the fact that\nit looks the same from different viewpoints. Alternatively, a polyhedron is\nsymmetrical if it is possible to perform certain operations (such as rotation)\nwhich change the positions in space of individual faces but which leave the\npolyhedron in a position that is indistinguishable from its original position.\nThe number of different but indistinguishable positions in which a polyhedron\ncan be placed is a measure of the amount, or degree, of svmniotiv which it\npossesses. For example, a regular tetrahedron can be placed in 12 diffeient\npositions: any of the four faces can be placed on a table, and any of the\ntlnoe edges of this base face can be placed at the front. A hexagonal\ndipyraniid can also be placed in 12 different positions since it can rest on\nany of its 12 faces in a unique way. Although these two polyhedra have the\nsame amount of synimotiv, they do not appear to have the same kind of\nsymmetry. The dipyraniid has two apices which differ from its other vertices\nimparting a definite direction to it. wheieas the tetrahedron is more\nisotropic with all its vertices having an equal status. The symmetry of a\npolyhedron needs to be qualified as well as quantified. To describe the\ndifferent kinds of symmetry, it is helpful to investigate the operations which\ncarry a polyhedron into its indistinguishable positions Such an operation is\ncalled a symmetry of the polyhedron. A symmetry is dotoiinined by its effect\non the polyhedron; it is not the action of moving the polvhedion or the route\ntaken which are important, but rather the relationship of its initial and\nfinal positions. Using 'symmetry' as a noun in this way is justified by the\nfact that the more symmetrical a polyhedron is in the everyday sense, the more\nsymmetries it has in this technical sense. The symmetries of a polyhedron are\nrules which describe the lelationships between its various parts. It has been\nsaid that the aesthetic appeal of svniinetii- cal objects results from the\npsychological process of discovering these rules. They imply an orderly\nstructure, the existence of an organising principle. In the following\nsections, the different kinds of symmetry operation are desciibed. and the\nways in which they can bo combined to produce different systems of symmetries\nare investigated.\n\nRotation symmetry 291 Rotation symmetry The action of picking up a model of a\npolyhedron and repositioning it so that it appears not to have been moved is\nan example of a direct symmetry operation. The polyhedron is physically\ncarried to a different but indistinguishable position. In later sections\nindirect symmetries will be encountered; the effect of these cannot be seen by\nmanipulating a model but require the aid of a mirror. The actual motion of a\npolyhedral model during a direct symmetry operation may be very complicated\nand difficult to describe, but since it is the difference between the initial\nand final positions which characterises a symmetry, the complexity of the\nmotion is irrelevant—it is the effect which is important. To describe a\nsymmetry we can choose a particular motion that produces the desired effect to\nrepresent the symmetry operation. The conventional motion is that of simple\nrotation. The notion of rotation is a natural one. The Earth rotates around an\naxis which joins the north and south poles; a wheel rotates about an axle. In\nthese physical examples of rotations there is always a part which remains\nfixed during the motion. For example, a point on the axle does not leave its\nposition whereas a point in the wheel describes a circle as it rotates around.\nA direct symmetry operation for a polyhedron is a rotation about an axis\nthrough a certain angle. The symmetry element associated with a symmetry\noperation is the set of points not affected by the operation—the points which\nremain fixed. For a rotation, the symmetry element is the axis. (Later, we\nshall see that the symmetry element for an indirect symmetry is a plane or a\nsingle point.) Mathematically, a rotation is described by giving a straight\nline (which forms the axis) and an angle. For example, the motion that the\nEarth makes in one hour about its axis is a rotation of 15°. (Of course, it\nhas also revolved about the sun during that time as well.) Leonhard Euler\nshowed that every direct symmetry of a polyhedron can be achieved by a\nrotation about some axis. A polyhedron can have more than one axis of\nrotational symmetry; Euler showed that in such circumstances all the axes must\nintersect at a point in the centre of the polyhedron. A rotational symmetry of\na polyhedron carries it from its original position to a second position.\nBecause this new position is indistinguishable from the original one, the\nsymmetry operation can be applied again, and the polyhedron rotated to a third\nposition—also indistinguishable from the original one. Indeed, if the symmetry\nis rotation by 180° then it will be identical to the original position. It is\noften helpful to regard the act of moving a polyhedron and placing it back in\nan identical position as a symmetry operation. Such an operation is called the\nidentity symmetry. The fact that a symmetry can be repeatedly applied to a\npolyhedron pro-\n\n292 Chapter 8 vides an alternative method of describing the magnitude of a\nrotation. Rather than specifying the size of the angle, we can state the\nnumber of times that the rotation needs to be repeated to return the\npolyhedron to its staiting position. For example, if a rotation of 90° is\napplied four times, the total angle thiough which the polyhedron is rotated by\nthe combined rotation is 3G()° a complete turn. Thus a rotation of 90° is also\ncalled a 4-fold rotation because a ioui-fold application of the symmetry is\nthe same as the identity symmetry. In gencial, a rotation of (-)° is called an\nn-fold rotation. An axis of n-fold rotational symmetry is sometimes called an\n//-told axis. Care has to be taken when labelling axes in this way because the\nsame axis can be associated with different rotations. A 4-fold axis must also\nbe a 2-lold axis, for example. It is the convention that the largest possible\nvalue of n is chosen to label the axis. Now that the terminology of rotational\nsymmetry has been established let us see what it means and how it is applied\nin practice. Systems of rotational symmetry We already know that the number of\ndistinct but indistinguishable positions in which a polyhedron can be placed\nis a measure of the dcf/jcc of svnimetiv. Identifying the axes of rotational\nsymmetry in a polyhedion gives us a wav of distinguishing different kinds of\nsymmetry. Thus a hexagonal prism and a legular tetrahedron have different\ntypes of symmetry even though they have t he same degree of symmetry. In order\nto gain a good understanding of the various kinds oi lotational symmetry it is\nhelpful to locate the positions of the axes on models of poh hedra. In simple\ncases, where there is a single axis, a picture may suffice but. as the number\nof axes increases, it becomes more difficult to imagine the wav in which they\nare interrelated. In the case of the Platonic solids, in which theie aie nianv\naxes, the rotational symmetries form a complex, strongly inteiconiiected\nsystem. In the following examples, a variety of polyhedra are examined and the\ncombinations of rotation axes that occur are recorded. You may find it helpiul\nto rotate models of polyhedra between your fingertips as you lead the text\nCyclic symmetry. The simplest system of rotational symmetry that a polyhedron\ncan have is exhibited by the pyramids; they have a single axis of rotational\nsymmeti v A hexagonal- based pyramid, for example, has an axis which passes\nthrough the apex and the centre of the base (Figure 8.1). The rotations about\nthis axis which can v the pvia- mid onto itself are all the multiples of\n(2jp)°, namelv GO0,120°. 180\". 2 10\". 300\". and 3G0° —the last symmetry being\nthe identity. This kind oi symmetiv is < ailed\n\nSystems of rotational symmetry 293 Figure 8.1. A rotation axis in a cyclic\nsystem. cyclic. The pyramid is said to have 6-fold cyclic symmetry, or just\nC(i symmetry for short. If the pyramid has a regular n-gon as its base then it\nhas a single axis of n-fold rotational symmetry and has Cn symmetry. Dihedral\nsymmetry. The triangular prism is another polyhedron which, like the hexagonal\npyramid, has six rotational symmetries . However, unlike the pyramid, the\nprism has more than one axis of rotational symmetry. In fact, it has four such\naxes. ()ne axis passes through the centres of the two triangular faces (as\nshown on the left of Figure 8.2). A rotation of 120° about this axis carries\nthe prism to a different but indistinguishable position. Repeating this\noperation twice more returns the prism to its starting position as three\nrotations of 120° are the same as a rotation of 360° or the identity symmetry.\nTherefore, this axis is a 3-fold axis. The other rotational symmetries of the\nprism turn it over so that the two triangular faces are interchanged. The\nrotations which invert the prism in this way have axes that pass through the\ncentre of one of the rectangular faces and the midpoint of the opposite edge\n(Figure 8.2). There are three such axes and they are all 2-fold axes. These\nthen are the four axes of symmetry of a triangular prism. The .3-fold axis is\ncalled the principal axis of the system, and the three secondary 2-fold axes\nlie in a plane perpendicular to it. It is the principal axis which gives the\ndirectional nature to the symmetry of polyhedra such as prisms and dipyramids.\nThis type of symmetry is called dihedral and is denoted Dn where n is the\norder of the principal axis. In the example given here, the prism has D^\nsymmetry since the principal axis is 3-fold. In the general case of a prism\nwith a regular n-gon base, the principal axis is an axis of n-fold rotational\nsymmetry and there are n secondary axes of 2-fold symmetry lying in a plane\nperpendicular to it which are all equally spaced around it at intervals of\n(-)°. A closer study reveals that when n is odd (as for the triangular prism)\nall of the secondary axes are equivalent. However, when n is even, they\nseparate out\n\n294 Chapter 8 Figure 8.2. Principal and secondary axes in a dihedral system.\ninto two sorts. This can be seen in a hexagonal-based prism: half of the\n2-fold axes join the centres of opposite faces, the others join the midpoints\nof opposite edges (Figure 8.3). When n is odd any secondary axis can be\ncarried on to the position of any other by a rotation about the principal\naxis, but when n is even the two sorts of secondary axis cannot be\ninterchanged in this way. A special case of dihedral symmetry occurs when the\nprincipal axis is a 2-fold axis. In such circumstances it is not sensible to\nspeak of a 'principal' axis since all the three axes are 2-fold, and they are\nmutually perpendicular—there; is nothing to distinguish one axis from another.\nExamples of polyhedra with this type of symmetry are shown in Figure 8.4.\nAnother example is a prism on a rectangular base whose width, length and\nheight measurements are all different. This type of symmetry is usually\nclassified along with the other dihedral types of symmetry and is labelled /¾.\nHowever, it should be remembered that in this case all of the axes have equal\nstatus. Besides £>2, there are other types of symmetry where there is no\npreferred axis. These types of symmetry are collectively known as spherical\n(or polyhedral) Figure 8.3. When n is even, the secondary axes in Dn can be\nseparated into two kinds.\n\nSystems of rotational symmetry 295 Figure 8.4. Polyhedra with D2 symmetry.\ntypes.1 The Platonic solids are examples of polyhedra with spherical symmetry\nand we now turn our attention to some of these. Tetrahedral symmetry. The\nregular tetrahedron has seven axes of rotational symmetry—four 3-fold axes and\nthree 2-fold axes (Figure 8.5). Each 3-fold axis passes through the centre of\na face and the opposite vertex. Each 2-fold axis passes through the midpoints\nof opposite edges. Any polyhedron which has this system of rotational\nsymmetries is said to have tetrahedral symmetry. This type of symmetry is\ndenoted by the label T. Figure 8.5. Rotation axes in the tetrahedral system.\nOctahedral symmetry. The regular octahedron has three sets of rotation axes\n(Figure 8.G). Firstly, there are three mutually perpendicular axes of 4-fold\nsymmetry. Each of these passes through two opposite vertices. There are also\nfour 3-fold axes each passing through the centres of a pair of opposite faces.\nLastly there are six axes of 2-fold symmetry. These axes pass through the\nmidpoints of pairs of opposite edges. 'Some mathematicians find it convenient\nto include the cyclic and dihedral cases as spherical systems. In the more\nrestricted meaning used here, only the D-i type is spherical; the term\n'prismatic' is applied to the other systems .\n\n296 Chapter 8 Figure 8.6. Rotation axes in the octahedral system. Any\npolyhedron which has this system of rotational symmetries has octahedral\nsymmetry. This system is denoted by O. Icosahedral symmetry. The regular\nicosahedron has axes of 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold rotational symmetry (Figure\n8.7). A 5-fold axis passes through each pair of opposite vertices: a 3-fold\naxis passes through the centres of each pair of opposite faces; a 2-fold axis\npasses through the midpoints of each pair of opposite edges. Thus there are\nsix 5-fold axes, ten 3-fold axes and fifteen 2-fold axes. This system of\nrotational symmetries is called the icosahedral system and is denoted by I.\nFigure 8.7. Rotation axes in the icosahedral system.\n\nHOW MANY SYSTEMS OF ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY ARE THERE? 297 How many systems of\nrotational symmetry are there? So far, every polyhedron that has been examined\nhas given rise to a new type of symmetry. The pyramids, prisms, and some\nPlatonic solids all have different systems of rotational symmetry. It is quite\nsurprising to find that these are the only systems of rotational symmetries\nwhich a polyhedron can have. Any polyhedron, if it has rotational symmetry at\nall, must have one of the five types described above: cyclic, dihedral,\ntetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral. A cube, for example, has the same\nsymmetry as an octahedron. So do some of the Archimedean solids such as the\nsnub cube and the rhomb-cub-octahedron. Kepler's star-faced polyhedra have\nicosahedral symmetry. Miller's solid has dihedral symmetry. Before proving\nthat there are no other systems of rotational symmetry, it will be helpful to\nstudy the way in which the rotations in a particular system are related to\neach other. The tetrahedral system is used as an example. The two points where\nthe Earth's axis pierces its surface are called poles. By analogy, the set of\npoints where the axes of rotational symmetry pierce a polyhedron are also\ncalled poles. Each axis punctures the polyhedron at two points so there are\ntwice as many poles as axes. The poles can be split, up into different kinds.\nFirstly, a pole which lies on an n-fold axis is called an //-pole. The\ntetrahedron, for example, has 2-poles and 3-poles. All the 2-poles are the\nsame but the 3-poles can be separated into two sets: four 3-poles are situated\nat, the face-centres, four more 3-poles lie at the vertices. Two poles are\nsaid to be equivalent if there is a rotational symmetry of the polyhedron\nwhich carries one pole to the other. So, for example, all the 2-poles of a\ntetrahedron are equivalent, but its 3-poles fall into two equivalence classes\nas no symmetry carries a vertex onto a face-centre. The number of poles in an\nequivalence class is related to the total number of symmetries and the kind of\npole. The number of 2-poles in the tetrahedral system is y = 6. The number of\npoles in each of the two equivalence classes of 3- poles is y = 4. In general\nif a polyhedron has a total of N rotational symmetries (including the identity\nsymmetry) then an equivalence class of n-poles contains y poles. To see that\nthis is the case, place a point close to an n-pole and apply each symmetry to\nthe point in turn marking the image point on the polyhedron. In Figure 8.8\nthis has been done with the 3-poles at the face-centres of a tetrahedron. This\nresults in a total of N points being placed on the polyhedron arranged in\ngroups of n around each pole in the equivalence class. Thus there are y poles.\nKnowledge of the number of poles in each equivalence class enables the number\nof rotational symmetries to be calculated. Ignoring the identity symmetry,\nthere are (n — 1) rotations associated with an n-pole. These are the rotations\nof - x 360°, - x 360°, • • • , ^-^ x 360°. n n n\n\n298 Chapter 8 Figure 8.8. For a 3-pole these are 120° and 240°. In the\ntetrahedral system the sum (number of 2-poles) x ( number of rotations\nassociated with each 2-pole) + (number of 3-poles) x ( number of rotations\nassociated with each 3-pole) equals twice the number of (non-identity)\nrotations because each rotation has been counted twice—once at each pole on\nits axis. Now, the number of /(-poles in an equivalence class is —, and the\nnumber of rotations associated with an //-pole is (n — 1). So, by separating\nthe term concerning 3-poles into its two classes of poles, the above sum\nbecomes (f)\"\"-^(f)»M + (|)«^.. which evaluates to 22—twice the number of non-\nidentity rotations Repeating this analysis in the general case leads to an\nequation ielating the number of rotations in a system to the types of poles\n(and hence types of lotations) that the system can contain. By finding all the\nsolutions of this equation, all the different systems of rotational symmetry\ncan be deduced. Theorem. The system of rotational symmetries of a polyhedron\nmust be one of the following types: cyclic, dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral\nor icosahedral. Proof: Consider a general system of rotational symmetries and\nassume that it contains a total of iV rotations. Choose a polyhedron which\nexhibits this tvpe of symmetry and examine the equivalence classes of poles.\nAn equivalence class of n-poles contains — poles, and associated to each\nn-pole there aie (a — 1) non- identity rotations. Adding up all of these\nrotations associated to the poles gives twice the number of non-identity\nrotations since each is counted twice. Tims N 2(iV-l) = £-(n-l) i n\n\nHOW MANY SYSTEMS OF ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY ARE THERE? 299 which can be rewritten\nas If Af = 1 then the only symmetry in the system is the identity symmetry So\nwe can assume that N is at least 2. This means that 1 * 2-| < 2\\. The values\nof n in the summation must all be at least 2 (why?), hence '/2 ^ 1-- < 1\\. n\nSuppose that the system of rotations contained only one equivalence class of\npoles. Then the right hand side of (A) would be less than 1, which contradicts\nthe fact that the left-hand side of (A) is at least 1. Therefore, there must\nbe at least two classes of poles. Also, the system of rotations cannot contain\nfour or more equivalence classes of poles for then the left-hand side of (A)\nis less than 2 while the right-hand side of (A) is v- /\\ !\\ 1111 > 1 ^ - + - +\n- + - = 2 Y //72222 poles Thus the possibilities are narrowed down to either\ntwo or three equivalence classes of poles. Suppose that the system contains\ntwo equivalence classes of poles one of ;;-poles and one of (/-poles. Then\nsubstituting these values into (A) gives '-* - HhHY Rearranging gives N N 2 =\n—+ —. V Q Now, the equivalence class of p-poles contains — poles and hence ~\nis an integei not equal to zero. Similarly — is a non-zero integer. Therefore\n— = — = 1 and hence N = p = q. Thus the system has two poles (one in each\nequivalence class) and, therefore, a single axis. Both poles are p-poles so\nthe axis is /;-fold. and the system of symmetry is cyclic, Cv. Now consider\nthe remaining case when there are three equivalence classes of poles. Suppose\nthese are ;;-poles, (/-poles and r-poles. Then substituting these\n\n300 Chapter 8 into (A) gives -£ = KW-;H-; Rearranging gives 2 111 1 + — = - +\n- + -. I\\ p q r If all of p, q and r were at least 3 then 111 111 - + - + - <\no + o + o = L p q r 3 3 3 However, 1 +- -^ is always greater than 1, so at\nleast one of p, q, <>i r must he 2. Choose r = 2 and assume also that p ^ q.\nThus A p q 2 y Rearranging this expression gives (p-2)((/-2) = 4 (l - ^) < 4\n(C) which implies that (p — 2)(q — 2) is 0, 1, 2 or 3. In the first case, when\nthe product is zero, q = 2. Substituting this into (B) gives - — j/, which\nimplies N = 2p. Thus this system has throe equivalence classes of poles, one\nof/;-poles, and two others of 2-poles. Each class of 2-poles contains y = p\npoles. This is the dihedral system Dp. The other solutions to (C) are (p,q) —\n(3,3),(4,3) and (5,3). Those solutions correspond to the systems T,0 and I\nrespectively. There aio no other possibilities. ■ Reflection symmetry The\nsymmetry operations discussed in the previous sections were all dhoct\nsymmetries—they could all be physically applied to a model. The symmetries to\nbe considered now are indirect and require a mirror to visualise the results.\nThe polyhedron shown in Figure 8.9 does not have any rotational symmctiv but\nit is not asymmetric. It has bilateral symmetry—the sort of symmetry soon\napproximately in a human face. This means it can be split into two halves\nwhich are mirror images of each other. The plane which separates the\npolyhedion in this way is called a plane of symmetry or a mirror plane. The\npolyhedron has minor or reflection symmetry.\n\nPrismatic symmetry types 301 Figure 8.9. A polyhedron with bilateral symmetry.\nMost everyday objects have reflection symmetry and objects without it. such as\na corkscrew, can look twisted. Polyhedra which do not possess reflection\nsymmetry are called cheiral (from the Greek word for 'hand'). They conic in\ntwo forms which are related like a left and right hand—they are mirror images\nof each other. Such a pair of polyhedra are called enantiomorphs. The snub\ncube and the compound of five tetrahedra are two examples of cheiral\npolyhedra. Bilateral symmetry is the simplest type of reflection symmetry as\nthere is only one mirror plane. This type of symmetry is given the label C.s.\n(The subscript comes from 'Spiegel', the German word for mirror.)2 When a\npolyhedron has more than one mirror plane, it must have rotational symmetry as\nwell because the line in which the mirrors meet acts as a rotation axis. If a\npolyhedron is reflected first in one mirror plane and then in another, it is\nchanged from being right handed to left handed and back to right handed again,\nso the composite effect must be a rotation. Thus all the types of symmetry\n(except (7.,.) which contain reflection symmetries must also contain one of\nthe systems of rotational symmetries described above. Prismatic symmetry types\nThe types of symmetry described in this section have a principal axis of\nrotation and their rotational symmetry type is either cyclic or dihedral.\nExamples of polyhedra exhibiting each of these types of symmetry can be made\nby decorating\" prisms with various patterns. Thus these symmetry types are\ncollectively known as prismatic. The decorations can take the form of\nselective augmentation or truncation, making incisions or cutting out notches,\nor simply by painting on a design. Patterns are occasionally seen on the faces\nof crystals. The facets are corrugated having tiny ridges and channels running\nacross them. Such markings are called striae or striations. Examples can be\nseen on some facets of the pyrite crystals shown in Plate 2. These patterns\nreveal the symmetry of the underlying structure of the crystals. 2 Several\nalternative labelling schemes are compared in Appendix 1.\n\n302 Chapter 8 (a) (b) (O (0 (g) (h) Figure 8.10. Polyhedra with prismatic\nsymmetry. The best way to gain a good understanding of the different symmetry\ntypes is to study a set of models. A set of small hexagonal prisms is easily\nmade from thin card and patterns can be drawn on their surfaces so that they\nexhibit the various types of symmetry. Careful examination of such models\nallows the symmetries in each system to be identified, and the various systems\nto be compared with one another so that their differences become apparent. The\nreader is strongly encouraged to make such a set.\n\nPrismatic symmetry types 303 Symmetry type D. nh' Figure 8.11. First, the set\nof symmetiies of an unmarked prism will be examined. A hexagonal- based prism\nwill be used as a specific example (Figure 8.11). Its rotational symmetry type\nis dihedral since it has a principal axis of 6-fold rotational symmetry and\nsix secondary axes of 2-fold rotational symmetry. Assume that the prism is\nresting on a hexagonal face so that the principal axis is vertical. Then there\nis a mirror plane which lies horizontally and cuts the prism in half. Other\nminor planes are arranged vertically and they each contain the principal axis.\nThe lines where the six vertical mirror planes meet the horizontal mirror\nplane are axes of rotational symmetry and form the 2-fold axes of the dihedral\nsystem. This is the complete system of mirror planes and rotation axes of an\nunmarked prism. The label given to this system is D6/l. The D6 refers to the\ntype of rotational symmetry, and the subscript h refers to the existence of a\nhorizontal mirror plane. The horizontal mirror cannot be the only mirror plane\nand the symmetry elements named in the label force the existence of the\nvertical mirrors. Another polyhedron which has this symmetry type is the\nhexagonal dipyramid (see Figure 8.10(a)). Symmetry type Dnv. Figure 8.12. If a\nhexagonal prism is decorated with chevrons that point up and down on alternate\nfaces round the prism, as shown in Figure 8.12, then some of the symmetry\nelements of the unmarked prism are destroyed. The horizontal plane is no\nlonger a plane of symmetry, neither are the vertical planes which pass through\nopposite edges. The 2-fold axes which join opposite face centres have been\ndestroyed as well. The principal axis has been reduced to an axis of 3-fold\nrotational symmetry. This system of symmetry elements is labelled /)3,,. The\nsystem of rotational\n\n304 Chapter 8 symmetries is /¾ and the subscript v indicates the existence of\nvertical minor planes. (Some authors use the label D3d to denote this system.)\nA polyhedron with symmetry type D6v is the hexagonal antiprisin. It has the\nsame rotational symmetries as an unmarked hexagonal prism. Howevei. the\nhorizontal mirror plane has disappeared and, instead of the 2-fold rotation\naxes being contained in the vertical mirror planes as they are in the £>„/,\nsystem, the axes and the planes are interleaved around the principal axis.\nAnother polvhedron with D6v symmetry is the hexagonal isosceles trapezohedron\n(see Figure 8.10(b)). Symmetry type Dn. Figure 8.13. If a hexagonal prism is\ndecorated as shown in Figure 8.13 then all the i (■flection symmetries are\ndestroyed but the complete system of rotational symmetries remains intact.\nThis system of pure rotational symmetry is labelled D(, The hexagonal scalene\ntrapezohedron (Figure 8.10(c)) has this symmetry tvpe Symmetry type Cnv. ' \\\nFigure 8.14. The hexagonal prism can be decorated as shown in Figure 8.14\nwhere all of the chevrons point upwards. In this case, the 2-fold rotations\ncease to be symmetries This means that the rotational symmetry type has been\nreduced from dihedral to cyclic. The vertical mirror planes are still\nsymmetries but the horizontal plane is not. (If both vertical and horizontal\nmirror planes were present then the 2-fold axes would also be present.) This\ntype of symmetry is labelled C(}V. The C(, shows the rotational symmetry type\nand the v refers to the vertical mirror planes. An elongated hexagonal pyramid\nhas this type of symmetry (Figure 8.10(f)).\n\nCompound symmetry and the S2n symmetry type 305 Figure 8.15. Symmetry type\nCnh. If the pattern shown in Figure 8.15 is applied to the prism then, again,\nthe rota- tional symmetry is reduced to the cyclic system. This time the\nvertical reflection symmetries are destroyed and the horizontal mirror plane\nremains This hvstem is labelled Cah. Figure 8.10(e) shows a polyhedron with\nthis symmetry type Symmetry type Cn. Figure 8.16. When the prism is decorated\nas shown in Figure 8.16, all the symmetries except, the axis of 6-fold\nrotational symmetry are destroyed. This system is just C'(t. See Figure\n8.10(h) for an example. Problem. Identify the symmetry types of the polyhedra\nin Figures 8.10 (d) and (g). Problem. Identify the symmetry types of the five\noctagonal-based prisms which are formed by applying each of the following\npatterns in turn to their rectangular faces: A E H N P Do any of the other\nletters of the alphabet give a symmetry type which is different from each of\nthese? Compound symmetry and the S2n symmetry type What is the symmetry type\nof the hexagonal-based prism decorated with a pattern like the one shown in\nFigure 8.17? It has no planes of reflection symmetry\n\n306 Chapter 8 and only one axis of rotational symmetry which is 3-fold. So, in\nthe above list, it has symmetry type C;j. Yet this symmetry type recognises\nonlv the fact that alternate faces have the same pattern whereas, in fact, the\nsame motif appears on all the rectangular faces, and there seems to be a\nhigher degree of svmmctiy than the straightforward cyclic type. Figure 8.17.\nThere is an analogy between this kind of symmetry of a solid and the symmetry\nof a linear pattern known as glide-reflection. Suppose that we choose a\nscalene triangle as a motif since it is asymmetric. Then reflection symmetry\nrepeats the motif but with the opposite handedness (see Figure 8.18) A second\nkind of symmetry (called translation) repeats the motif in an equally spaced\nlinear pattern. These two symmetries can be combined to produce a single\ncompound operation—a reflection and a translation together. To carry one copy\nof the motif onto the next one along, you translate it and then reflect it.\nThis motion is called a glide-reflection. It is the symmetry of a line of\nfootprints on a beach Now, let us take a section of the linear pattern with\nglide-reflection symmetry and join the ends together to form a loop (see\nFigure 8.19). If the section contains six copies of the triangle then the\nresulting loop will have the same svmmetrv as the decorated hexagonal prism\nabove. The translational symmetiy of the strip pattern has been converted into\nrotational symmetry of the loop, and the glide line of the strip pattern is\nnow a plane. The symmetry which canies one face onto the next is a combination\nof a rotation about the principal axis by 60° followed by a reflection in a\nhorizontal mirror plane. This operation is a compound symmetry and is called a\nrotation-reflection. The principal axis is called an axis of lotation-\nreflection, and in this example it is a 6-fold axis since the operation has to\nbe carried out six times before the polyhedron returns to its original\nposition. The label given to this type of symmetry is Sn. The example here has\nS(; symmetry. For this type of symmetry, n must be an even number otherwise\nit. is the same as a Cnh type of symmetry. When n is 2, the strip has only two\nmotifs on it. and there is no rotational symmetry. In this case, the symmetry\nis often described by a different operation, which is called central inversion\nor reflection m a point. To see why the latter name is appropriate consider\nwhat happens when an object is reflected in a plane. The distance from the\nmirror plane to a point in\n\nCompound symmetry and the S2n symmetry type 307 line .^* translation vector\nglide line Figure 8.18. A glide-reflection is a compound symmetry made up of a\ntranslation and a reflection. the object equals the distance from the mirror\nplane to the point's reflection in the mirror image (Figure 8.20). In an Si\nsymmetry, there is a central point which functions in the same way as a mirror\nplane: the distance from the centre to a point in the object equals the\ndistance from the centre to the point's image. This symmetry operation need\nnot occur in isolation and is included in other, more complex, systems of\nsymmetry. The cube, for example, has inversion symmetry. The regular\ntetrahedron, on the other hand, does not.

Cubic symmetry types All the polyhedra considered in this section have\nthe same axes of rotational symmetry as a cube although, in some instances, an\naxis of 4-fold symmetry is reduced to a 2-fold axis. As in the case of prisms,\neach of the types of cubic symmetry can be illustrated by decorating a cube\nwith an appropriate pattern. It will be helpful to make some small cubes and\napply patterns to them so that the differences in symmetry can be clearly\nseen. Symmetry type Oh. Firstly, the complete set of symmetry elements of an\nundecorated cube will be described. There are three axes of 4-fold rotational\nsymmetry which join the centres of opposite faces; four axes of 3-fold\nrotational symmetry which join diagonally opposite vertices; and six 2-fold\nrotation axes joining the midpoints of opposite edges. This system of axes is\nidentical to that of the octahedron, so the rotational symmetry system\npossessed by a cube is O. The system of reflection symmetries is equally rich.\nThere are three mirror planes, each of which contains two of the 4-fold axes,\nand which together form a system of mutually perpendicular planes (see Figure\n8.21(a) and (b)) There are also six other mirror planes, each of which\ncontains two of the 3-fold axes (Figure 8.21(c)). The cube also has a centre\nof inversion. The axes of rotational symmetry of highest degree in this system\nare 4-fold. If one of these primary axes is placed vertically then there is a\nplane of reflection symmetry which lies horizontally. This system of symmetry\nis given the label (¾.\n\nCubic symmetry types 309 (c) Figure 8.21. The reflection planes of a cube.\nSymmetry type O. If the pattern shown in Figure 8.22 is applied to the faces\nof the cube so that all the 3-fold axes of rotational symmetry are preserved,\nthen the whole system of rotational symmetry is preserved as a consequence.\nHowever, all of the reflection symmetries are destroyed. So the label of this\nsymmetry type is O. The snub cube has this type of symmetry, as does the\noctahedron covered with the tessellation of birds (Figure 2.5). Figure 8.22.\nSymmetry type Th. Suppose that the cube is decorated with the pattern shown in\nFigure 8.23. Again, the pattern respects the axes of 3-fold rotational\nsymmetry. The other rotational symmetries have been altered or destroyed: the\naxes of 4-fold symmetrv of the\n\n310 Chapter 8 I Figure 8.23. unpatterned cube have been reduced to 2-fold\naxes, and the axes which join the midpoints of opposite edges are no longer\nelements of rotational symmetry. The system of rotational symmetries therefore\nconsists of four axes of 3-fold symmetry and three axes of 2-fold symmetry.\nThis is, in fact, the same system as that of a regular tetrahedron. Figure\n8.24. Polyhedra with T/j symmetry. The decorated cube still retains some\nreflection symmetry. The three mutually perpendicular mirror planes are still\nplanes of reflection symmetry; the other planes do not function as symmetry\nelements. This symmetry type is labelled Th- The two dodecahedra shown in\nFigure 8.24 are examples of polyhedra with this symmetry type. Polyhedra with\nthis symmetry type also have inversion symmetry. This feature can be used to\ndistinguish easily between Th and the following symmetry system which does not\ncontain a centre of inversion. Symmetry type Td. A cube decorated as shown in\nFigure 8.25 also has the tetrahedral system of rotational symmetries. In this\ncase, however, it is the orthogonal planes of reflection symmetry that are\ndestroyed and the others which are retained. This symmetry type is labelled\n7^. It is the complete symmetry type of a regular tetrahedron.\n\nICOSAHEDRAL SYMMETRY TYPES 311 Figure 8.25. Symmetry type T. When the pattern\nshown in Figure 8.26 is used to decorate the cube, all the reflection\nsymmetries are destroyed. The only remaining symmetries are the set of\nrotations of a tetrahedron. This symmetry type is labelled T. A polyhedron\nwith this system of symmetry can be formed by suitably twisting and deforming\nan icosahedron to produce a 'snub tetrahedron' (Figure 8.27). Icosahedral\nsymmetry types The analysis of the symmetry types of polyhedra having the\nicosahedral symmetry system is much easier than the preceding analyses of the\nprismatic and cubic- systems. In fact, there are only two types. One of these\ncontains planes of reflection symmetry and is labelled //,; the other contains\nrotational symmetries only and is labelled I. The dodecahedron and the four\nKepler-Poinsot star polvhedra have symmetry type //,. The snub dodecahedron,\nthe compound of five tetrahe- dra (Plate 12), and the icosahedron decorated\nwith fish motifs (Figure 2.5) have symmetry type /. Problem.

Figure 8.26.\n\n312 Chapter 8 Figure 8.27. A 'snub tetrahedron'. Determining the correct\nsymmetry type The above list of symmetry types of polyhedra is complete except\nfor one further type—the system containing no symmetry operations at all. In\nsuch a situation the polyhedron is called asymmetric. The symmetry type is\nlabelled C\\ since an axis of 1-fold symmetry implies that a polyhedron has to\nbe rotated through a complete turn of 360° before its position is\nindistinguishable from its starting position. Every line meeting an asymmetric\npolyhedron is an axis of 1-fold symmetry and these are the only 'symmetries'\nit has. So, a polyhedron can have one of 17 types of symmetry. (The prismatic\ntypes are actually families containing an unlimited number of closely related\nsystems.) The 17 types of symmetry are Ci, Ci, Cs, ^ni ^nvi ^nhi *-Jni L-'nvi\n'-'nhi &ni T, Td, Th, O, Oh J, Ih With so many classes, it is important to be\nable to correctly identify the symmetry type of a polyhedron in a\nstraightforward manner. A simple scheme for doing this is shown in Figure\n8.28. By answering a series of simple yes/no questions about the polyhedron in\nquestion, a path is traced through the decision tree which (provided no\nmistakes are made) leads to the correct symmetry type being obtained. When one\nof the prismatic types is obtained and the principal axis has n-fold\nrotational symmetry, the n part of the label should be replaced appropriately.\nProblem.

A decision tree to determine the symmetry type of a polyhedron.\n\n314 Chapter 8 Groups of symmetries A striking example of the development of a\nPlatonic vision is the mathematical analysis of symmetry which has led to the\ntheory of groups.'1 F E. Biowdoi and S. Mac Lane All the possible systems of\nsymmetries of polyhedra have now been described. This was accomplished by\ndescribing the symmetry elements (axes, planes, and point of symmetry) present\nin each system, together with their relative positions. However, not all of\nthese elements are mutually independent. Sometimes the presence of particular\nelements in a system forces the existence of another. For instance, two planes\nof reflection symmetry determine an axis of rotation symmetry. This is because\nthe act of successively applying a reflection in one mirror plane and then in\na second carries the polyhedron to a position indistinguishable from its\noriginal (via an intermediate such position) and it can be shown that the\nresulting symmetry operation is a rotation whose axis is the line of\nintersection of the two mirror planes. The process of applying two symmetry\noperations to produce a thiid leads to the idea of a rule of combination—a\nrule that describes the effect of combining two symmetry operations. The set\nof all such rules describes the structure of the system. As an example, the\nrules of combination for the symmetries in the C-ih system will be derived.\nThe defining elements of symmetry in the C2h system are an axis of 2-fold\nrotational symmetry and a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis. The two\ncorresponding symmetry operations are a rotation of 180° and a reflection.\nWhen these two symmetry operations are combined so that the reflection follows\nthe lotation, the combination is a compound symmetry: it is a 2-fold rotation-\nreflection. This symmetry is normally called inversion, and the point where\nthe axis intersects the mirror plane is also an element of symmetry—it is the\ncentre of inveision or point of reflection symmetry. If the symmetries are\ncombined in the leveise older then the same result is produced. It is\nimportant to note that this is not always the case: the order in which\noperations are applied can affect the result. Suppose the symmetry operations\ndiscovered so far are denoted by letters: let r denote the rotation, m denote\nthe reflection, and i denote the inversion. Then the two rules of combination\njust determined can be written as r ■ m = i and m ■ r = i. As the result may\ndepend on the order in which the operations are carried out, it is important\nto establish a convention as to which is done first. In the examples here, the\nleftmost operation is applied first. (The convention chosen vaiies fiom one\nauthor to another.)\n\nGroups of symmetries 315 Other rules of combination can be worked out. For\nexample, what are the results of r ■ i, i ■ m and in ■ m? In fact, none of\nthese combinations leads to new elements of symmetry; the resulting operation\nis always r, m, i, or the identity symmetry. If the reflection is applied to a\npolyhedron twice in succession then the polyhedron returns to its original\nposition. Denoting the identity symmetry by 1, this rule can be written m ■ rn\n= 1. The symbol 1 is chosen because of the analogy with combining numbers\nusing multiplication. Multiplying any number by 1 has no effect. Likewise,\ncombining any symmetry with the identity symmetry leaves it unchanged. Thus 1\n■ m = m, r ■ 1 = r, i ■ 1 = i. All of these rules of combination can be\nsummarised in a table which gives the result of combining any two operations.\nSuch a table is very like the multiplication tables which school children use.\nHowever, there is one important difference: the product of two numbers does\nnot depend on their order whereas changing the order of two symmetry\noperations can produce different results. We shall use the convention that the\nsymbols at the side of the table indexing the lows aie the first operation and\nthe symbols across the top of the table indexing the columns are the second.\nThe table below shows the rules for C^h- C?h 1 r m i 1 1 r m i r r 1 i m m m i\n1 r i i m r 1 A table of rules can be worked out for any symmetry system. Two\nmore examples deal with the cases of the 54 system and the /¾ system. In the\nS4 system there is a single defining symmetry element: an axis of rotation-\nreflection symmetry. Let s denote the symmetry operation of lotating a\npolyhedron by 90° about this axis then reflecting in a mirror plane\nperpendicular to the axis. If this operation is performed twice in succession,\nit is equivalent to rotating the polyhedron by 180° about the axis. If r\ndenotes a 2-fold rotation about the axis then s • s = r. The combination of r\nand s is a rotation of 270° about the axis followed by a reflection and this\noperation is denoted by t. Thus r ■ s = t. Applying s for a fourth time\nresults in a rotation of 360° so t ■ s = 1. The complete set of rules for\nthese operations is shown in the table.\n\n316 Chapter 8 s4 1 s r t 1 1 s r t s s r t 1 r r t 1 s t t 1 s r The symmetry\nelements in the D? system are three axes of 2-fold rotation which are mutually\nperpendicular. These axes can be labelled Ar, Y and Z as shown below. The\noperation of rotating a polyhedron by 180° about the A\"-axis can be denoted x.\nLikewise, y and z denote the 2-fold rotations about the Y and Z axes\nrespectively. The combination table for this system is then D2 1 X y z 1 1 X y\nz X X 1 z y y y z 1 :/; 'y ~ y j. l These tables, which provide a description\nof the structure of a symmetry system, are examples of the abstract\nmathematical concept called a (/roup. A group is formed from a set of objects\nand a procedure which tells you how to combine any two objects to produce\nanother. In our case, the objects of the group are symmetry operations and the\ncombination procedure is 'apply the two symmetries one after the other'. For a\nset and its associated combination procedure to form a group, it must have\nseveral specific properties. Firstly, the combination of any two objects must\nresult in another object in the set. For example, the set of reflection\nsymmetries of a cube do not form a group since the composition of two\nreflections is not a reflection but a lotation. The set of all rotational\nsymmetries of a cube is a group since the composition of any two rotations\nalways results in another rotation. Secondly, there must be an object which\nacts like the identity svmmetiv. This object is usually denoted by 1. Then, if\n# is any other object in the gioup, both of the following rules must be true:\n(j ■ 1 = g and 1 • g = g. The third property that a group must have is\nexhibited in the gioups of symmetries by the fact that any symmetry operation\ncan be undone. The effect of a symmetry can be neutralised by applying a\nsecond symmetry so that their combined result is the identity symmetry. For\nexample, in the S.\\ system, the\n\nGroups of symmetries 317 operation denoted by s is undone by the operation t\nsince « • t — 1 (check the table). This property is expressed abstractly by\nrequiring that, for everv object g in the group, there exists an object h so\nthat g ■ h = 1. The last property of a group allows lengthy expressions\ninvolving maiiv compositions to be evaluated in any order. (This is not the\nsame as allowing the order of the objects to be changed.) Using the S4 system\nas an example again, the expression r • s ■ t can be evaluated in two\ndifferent ways. These aie (i) Evaluate the left-hand composition first: (r •\ns) ■ t r ■ s = t and then t ■ t = r. (ii) Evaluate the right-hand composition\nfirst: r ■ (a ■ t) s ■ t = 1 and then r • 1 = r. Both give the same result as\nrequired. These four requirements on the objects of a set are the axioms of a\ngroup. When studying groups in this abstract sense, it is only the structure\nwhich is taken into account. The objects are not interpreted as any physical\nopeiation which can actually be carried out. All that is used is the knowledge\nof the way in which they combine. The tables which express this structure are\ncalled group tables. In this abstract sense, the structures of the C211 and\nthe D2 systems of symmetries are the same. Their group tables have the same\npattern and thus the same abstract structure. The groups are said to be\nisomorphic, meaning 'same form'. However, this structure is interpreted in two\ndifferent ways. In the /¾ case, all of the objects are realised as rotations,\nbut in the realisation as C-2h, indirect symmetries also appear. The other\ngroup table found so far is that of the S4 system of symmetries. This group is\nabstractly different from those of the /¾ and the C211 systems. The patterns\nin the tables are different. This can be easily checked by noticing that in\nthe £>2 group table, the composition of every symmetry with itself is the\nidentity, whereas in the S4 system there are only two such symmetries. This\nproperty of the patterns in the group tables shows that the groups are\nabstractly different and that the symmetry systems have different structures.\nIn groups with a large number of objects, the structure can be very complex.\nFor example, the group table of the symmetry system Ih is an array of 120 x\n120 elements. The abstract structure of the dihedral symmetry system D^ is\nshown below. The objects of this group can be interpreted as the rotations of\na triangular prism: the 2-fold rotations correspond to p, q and r while a and\nb are rotations round the principal axis. Notice that this group contains\nexamples of composition where the order of the objects is important. For\ninstance, a • p — r but p ■ a = q.\n\n318 Chapter 8 D, 1 a b V <1 r 1 1 a b V 1 r a a b 1 <1 r V b b 1 a r P Q V V r\n<1 1 b a (J <1 V V a 1 b r r <1 V b a 1 People were using groups long before\nthey had been formally defined In the problems being studied, such as the\nsymmetries of polyhedra, the axioms of a group are automatically satisfied. It\nwas only after much experience of these and other similar structures that the\nfour properties listed above were distilled out as their characteristic\nfeatures and abstract groups were defined axiomaticallv. The term group was\nfirst used to describe such structures in 18C9 bv Caniille .Ionian\n(1838-1922), although he used only the first property, that of closuie of the\nsystem, to define a group. He was studying groups of symmetries and the other\nthree axioms follow automatically from the way that symmetries combine. He did\nnotice that every symmetry had an 'equal and opposite' svmmetiv associated\nwith it, that is, an inverse. In 1854, Arthur Cayley recognised the need for\nthe fourth property (associativity) and the existence of an identity. He\ndefined a group using abstract symbols and expressed rules of combination as a\ngroup table. In 1856, William Rowan Hamilton gave one of the first\npresentations of a group—a method of describing a group without writing out\nits complete group table. He gave a presentation of the icosahedral group\nwhich can be wiitten on a single line (a considerable saving of space and\neffort when compaied to the 60 x 60 group table) and called his system\n'icosian calculus' The fom properties listed above, which are the modern\naxioms of a group, wen1 first published in 1882 independently by both Walter\nvon Dyck and Heinrich Webei. The analysis of abstract groups is called group\ntheory and the aiea now forms a very important branch of mathematics. It has\napplications in many disciplines including subatomic particle physics,\nmolecular bonding schemes in chemistry, classification of patterns and\nornamental designs, the description of different kinds of geometry, and\ncrystallography. Crystallography and the development of symmetry The\ndevelopment of the mathematical theory of symmetry groups spanned the\nnineteenth century and much of the motivation came from investigations into\nthe nature of crystals. Crystals have always attracted man's attention. The\nflatness of theii sm faces, their precise geometrical shapes, their\ntranslucency and light refracting pioperties\n\nCrystallography and the development of symmetry 319 distinguish them from the\nother amorphous forms found in nature. The decks confused the clear crystals\nof quartz with glaciers, thinking them to be water which had been congealed by\nthe intense cold in the mountains. The Greek word 'krystallos' means ice.\nUntil the seventeenth century the only crystals known were those visible to\nthe naked eye, and crystals were thought to be rare and something of a\ncmiosity. The invention of the microscope enabled naturalists to see that many\nfine grained minerals contain crystals. The early chemists watched solids\ncrystallising out of solutions, the plane faces and symmetrical shapes\nappearing spontaneously. Observations like these hinted at an orderliness to\nthe structure of crystals. One of the first to suggest that internal structure\naccounts for the external form was Robert Hooke (1635-1703). In his\nMicrographia, or some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies (1665) he\nsuggested that crystals were stacks of small spherical particles packed\nclosely together. The fact that crystals fracture easily in certain directions\nleaving flat faces led Christiaan Huygens (1629 1695) to propose that these\ncleavage planes are natural divisions between sheets of particles. Domenico\nGuglielmini (1655-1710), a professor of mathematics at Bologna and Padua,\nobserved that the directions of the cleavage planes were always the same in\nany given substance and he believed that the fundamental units from which a\ncrystal is built must themselves be miniature crystals with plane faces. In\n1772, Jean-Baptiste Louis Rome de l'lsle (1736-1790) published his Essai de\nCristallographie. In his view, the chief characteristic for classifying\nminerals was their external geometrical shape, and his essay contains detailed\ndescriptions of over 100 crystal forms. In a later work (1783) he expanded\nthis list to more than 450. Precise measurements were taken of each crystal\ndescribed and this led to the discovery of the constancy of interfacial\nangles. Rene Just Haiiy (1743-1822) also wrote on the structure of crystals In\nan essay that appeared in 1784 he put forward ideas which also arose\" fioni\nthe contemplation of cleavage planes. There is a story that he accidentally\ndiopped a large calcite crystal which belonged to a friend who thereupon\npresented him with the resulting fragments. Haiiy noticed that the cleavage\nplanes weie not the same as the face planes and that if the crystal were split\napart sufficiently, a small core would be left, all of whose faces were\nparallel to cleavage planes. In the case of calcite, this core is rhombohedral\nin shape. He went on to show how units of this shape could be stacked up to\nproduce faces with different slopes by supposing that rows were omitted in a\nregular fashion in successive layers. The idea that a crystal was built from\ntiny identical building blocks arranged in an array that can be finished off\nin different ways accounted for the variety of external forms in crystals of a\nsingle mineral. At one time the existence of different forms of the same\ncrystal had been used as an argument against internal structure. The diagram\nreproduced in Figure 8.29 is from Haiiy's Traitc de Mineralogie published\n\n320 Chapter 8 in 1801. It shows how small cubes can be stacked to produce\nshapes with the form of a rhombic dodecahedron and a pyritohedron. The faces\nare stepped because the ratio of the size of the solid to the size of the\nbuilding block is large. In real crystals the blocks are submicroscopic and\nthe faces are apparently planar. The importance of this building block theory\nof crystal structure has led to Haiiy being called the 'Father of\ncrystallography'. Figure 8.29. Diagram from Hauy's Traite de Mineralogie\nshowing how various crystal shapes can be formed by stacking up many small\ncongruent blocks. At first, Haiiy had just six building blocks but later the\nset was enlarged to eighteen. He also allowed his blocks to be modified so\nthat new faces appeared but he imposed a law of symmetry to restrict the\npossibilities: parts of the initial form that were indistinguishable to the\neye had to be modified in the same fashion. This gave Haiiy an intuitive\nunderstanding of some of the different symmetry types of solid objects.\nMathematicians of the time had not ventured beyond simple mirror symmetry.\n\nCrystallography and the development of symmetry 321 A problem with Haiiy's\ntheory is that the fundamental units formed bv cleaving a crystal cannot\nalways be stacked up to fill space in the way that cubes can. This led to\ndebates about the reality of Haiiy's building blocks. Some suggested replacing\neach block by a point at its centre of gravity which resulted in a lattice of\npoints distributed through space in a pattern that repeated itself over and\nover in all directions. Others replaced the blocks by spheres, reviving\nHooke's idea. Gabriel Delafosse (1796-1878) proposed that Haiiy's blocks be\nreplaced by 'polyhedral molecules' which had spherical atoms at their\nvertices. These molecules were to be arranged in a lattice (like Haiiy's\nblocks) and their shape would determine the external form and physical\nproperties of the crystal. Understanding this new structure required a\ndetailed analysis of the symmetries of the molecules themselves, of the\nlattice structure, and of theii intei relationships. These problems were\nattacked by Auguste Bravais (1811 1863). In a paper that appeared in 1849 he\ndefined axes, planes and centres of svnnnetry and distinguished between\nprincipal and secondary axes. By considering the various combinations of\nsymmetries, he enumerated the list of symmetry types of polyhedra presented\nearlier in the chapter apart from one exception: he missed the type S^n when n\nis even. (His list of symmetry operations did not include rotation-\nreflections. When n is odd, S^n can be generated from rotations and\ninversion.) The mathematician and astronomer August Ferdinand Mobius (1790\n1868) also investigated the possible systems of symmetries which a\npolyhedrally shaped object can have. His definition of symmetry is the same as\nthat used fodav: a figure is symmetrical if it is congruent to itself in more\nthan one way. He enteied his work for a prize offered by the Paris Academy in\n1861 for 'work perfecting some aspect of the theory of polyhedra'. Among the\nother entrants was Eugene Charles Catalan, who enumerated some semiregular\npolyhedra including the Archimedean solids. None of the entries was judged to\nbe of sufficient quality to be awarded the prize. The first enumeration of the\nsymmetry types that the external form of a crystal can have was achieved\nearlier than this. The mineralogist Joliann Fiiediich Christian Hessel\n(1796-1872) classified the 32 kinds of symmetry that a ciystal can have in\n1830, but his work went unnoticed until Leonhard Solmcke (1842 1897) drew\nattention to its importance. It was republished in the 189()'s as pait of a\ncollection of papers on crystallography. In 1850 Bravais continued his own\ninvestigations and studied the symmetries of points arranged regularly in\nspace. He found seven different lattice systems, now called the cubic,\nhexagonal, tetragonal, rhombohedral (or trigonal), orthorhombic, monoclinic,\nand triclinic systems. He followed this with a finer classification which\nproduced fourteen different types of lattice. The lattice structure of a\ncrystal restricts the kinds of rotational symmetry\n\n322 Chapter 8 that can appear to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold and 6-fold. This\n(rystalloi/i a ph.tr restriction is implicit in Haiiy's work. A consequence is\nthat crystals cannot have icosahedral symmetry since this system contains\nforbidden 5-fold syminctiv axes. The rotational symmetries of a cube are not\nexcluded and cubic crystals occur in nature. Of the infinite families of\nsymmetry types in the prismatic systems of symmetry, only those whose\nprincipal axis is 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold 01 6-fold can occur as the symmetry\ntype of a crystal. Hence there are only finitely many possibilities for the\nsymmetry types of the external forms of crystals. These 32 symmetry types are\ncalled the crystal classes. Crystallographers separate the 32 crystal classes\ninto seven kinds conospoiid- ing to Bravais' original classification of\nlattices. Each lattice is built up by repeating a fundamental unit, and the\nshape of the building block detei mines the type of lattice. Haiiy's diagram\nshows how cubic blocks can produce crystals having cubic symmetry types 0¾\n(the cube and rhombic dodecahedron) and 7), (the pyritohedron). The other\nkinds of building blocks and the related symmetry groups are shown in Table\n8.30. One is a square-based prism with i octangular sides. This is a building\nblock for the tetragonal systems. If the fundamental units are shaped like\nbricks in which the height, width and length measuiemonts are all different\nthen the orthorhombic symmetry types are created. If the brick is sheared in\none direction it becomes the building block for the monoclimc systems, and if\nit is sheared in two directions to produce a skew parallelepiped then it is\nthe fundamental unit for the triclinic systems. The two kinds of symmetry\nwhich contain 3-fold rotational symmetry are the rhombohedral (or trigonal)\nand the hexagonal systems. The building blocks for these systems are a\nlhombohodion and a rhombus-based prism respectively. The variety of external\nforms which crystals of the same species can exhibit means that classification\nsystems based on geometrical shape are not very useful. However, all crystals\nof a given species have the same internal structure and this makes a better\nbasis for classification. For this reason investigations into the possible\nstructures continued in the second half of the nineteenth oontuiv. In his\nclassification of patterns in space, Bravais had assumed that even- molecule\nin the lattice had the same orientation so that they were all aligned in the\nsame direction. This restriction was relaxed and replaced by the condition\nthat each molecule had the same relation to the pattern as a whole,\niiiospectivo of its orientation. This meant that direct symmetries in general\nneeded to be considered, not just translations. Louis Poinsot studied screw\nmotions, another type of diiect svniinotiv operation. A screw is a compound\noperation involving a rotation followed by a translation along its axis.\nBuilding on Bravais' and Poinsot's woik. Camillo Jordan investigated systems\nof direct symmetries in a group theoretical manner (although groups were not\nyet formally defined). He examined the ways that io-\n\nCrystallography and the development of symmetry 323 Building block System\nGroup Related groups cubic Oh O, Th, Td, T tetragonal D.

Table 8.30. tations, translations and screw symmetries could be\ncombined. Sohncke reworked Jordan's ideas in the less abstract form of\nrepeating patterns in space. He completed the list of groups extending it from\n59 to 66 (two of these were later found to be the same). Indirect symmetries\nsuch as rotation-reflection and rotation-inversion had been neglected in these\nclassifications and the resulting crystallographic theory was unable to\naccount for certain directional properties of crystals. Some crystals become\npolarised when they are subjected to changes in temperature or pressure—two\nopposite faces acquire positive and negative charges. The pyro- electric\nproperty was known since at least 1757 when Franz Aepinus found that\ntourmaline became polarised after being placed in hot water. These pyro-\nelectric and piezo-electric properties led Pierre Curie (1859-1906) to study\ncrystal symmetry, and he drew attention to the omission of indirect\nsymmetries. The inclusion of indirect symmetries raises the number of groups\nof symmetries that a three-dimensional repeating pattern can have to a total\nof 230.\n\n324 Chapter 8 The enumeration of these 'space groups' was carried out in the\nearlv 1890's by the Russian Evgraf Stephanovich Fedorov (1853-1919), who\nextended Sohncke's work, and simultaneously by the German mathematician Arthur\nMoritz Schoen- flies (1853-1928), who, under the influence of Felix Klein,\nfollowed the group theoretical approach of Jordan. Both men missed a few cases\nbut when they became aware of each other's work they corresponded to check\nthat theii lists agreed. They finally produced a list of 230 groups. The same\nproblem was being worked on independently by the Englishman William Barlow\n(1845 1934). who published his classification in 1894. Like Sohncke and\nFedorov, he thought in terms of lattices and he made models by arranging\ngloves on a rack to help him visualise the regular patterns in space. He also\nstudied the ways that spheres can be packed together in an economical manner\nand found five1 dense oi close packings which he believed represented the\nstructures of some crystals. This achievement was the climax of the golden age\nof theoretical crystallography—a complete mathematical classification of\ncrystal structures based on the assumption that crystals are built of units\nstacked up in a repetitive manner. The theory was written up by Harold Hilton\nand published as Mathematical Crystallography and the Theory of Groups of\nMovements in 1903. Neai the close of his book Hilton remarks The geometrical\ntheory of crystal-structure now seems to ho fairly complete; it is probable\nthat further advance is to be expected on the physical or mechanical side.c At\nthe turn of the century, the physical composition of crystals was undecided\nalthough it was frequently stated that all crystals possessed a periodic\nstructure. Another unsolved problem at that time was to determine the nature\nof the radiation discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen in 1895. It had been\nsuggested that these x-rays were very short wavelength electromagnetic\nradiation. Max von Laue (1879-1960), who had been working on the interference\npatterns foimed when light passes through a diffraction grating, realised that\nif both assumptions were correct then a similar phenomenon should occur if\nx-rays were passed through a crystal. Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping\ntested his idea experimentally by irradiating a copper sulphate crystal. The\nphotographic plate placed behind the crystal revealed a set of regularly\nordered dark patches. This was the first x-ray diffraction pattern and\nprovided the key experimental evidence1 foi a repeating structure on the\natomic scale. The announcement of success was made in 1912 and the\nsignificance of this discovery was recognised with tin1 awaid of a Nobel prize\nin 1914.\n\n©1996 P. R. Cromwell\n\n327 0 ] Counting, Colouring 2/ and Computing A mathematician, like a painter\nor a poet, is a maker of patterns. ■ ■ ■ The mathematician's patterns, like\nthe painter's or the poet's, must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colours or\nthe words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test:\nthere is no place in the world for ugly mathematics.'1 G. H. Hardy One way of\nenhancing the aesthetic qualities of polyhedral models is to paint them.\nBesides adding to their visual appeal, colour can be used to highlight various\nrelationships between the component parts of a polyhedron since the eye is\ndrawn to elements of like colour. This technique has been used to colour the\nmodels shown in some of the colour plates. In many of the models of the\nArchimedean solids (Plates 3 and 4) faces of like shape have the same colour\nshowing how each type of face is distributed over the polyhedron. In each of\nthe compound polyhedra (Plates 11-16) all the visible parts of a component,\nare coloured the same and each individual component has a separate colour.\nLikewise for the star polyhedra (Plates 8-9) where each face is monochromatic:\neven though the accessible parts of a face are physically disconnected, they\nare linked by colour and are seen as parts of a planar whole. The faces of a\npolyhedron can also be embellished with markings or patterns. Some of the\noldest examples of this are a pair of Roman icosahedral dice found in Egypt,\nnow in the British Museum, which date from the Ptolemaic dynasty. The\ntessellations of the octahedron with bird motifs and of the icosahedron with\nfish shown in Figure 2.5 are further examples of decorated polyhedra. However,\nin the present investigation these kinds of pattern will be ignored; we shall\nconcentrate\n\n328 Chapter 9 on colourings in which each face is coloured in a single colour.\nFurthermore, we shall restrict attention to 'spherical' polyhedra, that is, to\npolyhedral surfaces1 which can be continuously deformed into a sphere. It is\nsometimes necessary to appeal to this property to show that particular kinds\nof colouring are possible, as for instance when Euler's formula is applied.\nColouring the Platonic solids The first mathematical question relating to\ncoloured polyhedra appeared in 1824 in Joseph Diaz Gergonne's journal Annales\nde Mathematique, Pures et Ap- pliquees. It concerned the number of different\nways each of the Platonic solids can be coloured if all of their faces receive\ndifferent colours. Implicit in this question is the problem of deciding\nwhether two colourings are different. As an illustration we shall examine the\npossibilities of colouring a cube with six colours, each face receiving a\ndifferent colour. The six faces of the cube can be labelled 'top', 'bottom',\n'left', 'right', 'front', and 'back'. When colouring the cube, the faces are\nto be coloured in this order. We can choose from six colours for the top face.\nThere is a choice of five unused colours remaining for the bottom face, four\nfor the left face, and so on until only one colour remains unused and this is\napplied to the back face. Therefore the number of possibilities for assigning\nthe colours to the faces is 6x5x4x3x2x1 = 720. This result is not yet the\nfinal answer to our question. For the purposes of calculation the faces of the\ncube were labelled so that they could be distinguished but, when studying a\nmodel of coloured cube, all the faces are alike. Apart from colour, there is\nnothing to distinguish between them. If you were handed two coloured cubes and\nasked whether they were coloured in the same way, you would turn them and try\nto match the patterns. Because the cube is symmetrical, the same pattern of\ncolours can occur in several orientations, and rotating one of the cubes would\nallow you to see all the possibilities. The above calculation did not take\ninto account the symmetry properties of the cube. The answer of 720 is too\nlarge because colourings which one intuitively thinks of as being the same\nhave been counted more than once. The cube has 24 rotational symmetries so\neach particular pattern of colours can be placed in any of 24 orientations.\nEach pattern will appear in the list of 720 colourings 24 times over.\nTherefore, the number of different colourings of the cube using six colours is\nactually ^ = 30. This method can be applied to the other Platonic solids.\nSuppose that the polyhedron has F faces and that each face is given a unique\nlabel. Colour each 1See the definition of 'polyhedron' in Chapter 5.\n\nColouring the Platonic solids 329 face choosing from a palette of F colours so\nthat no two faces have the same colour. Then the number of distinct colourings\nof the labelled polyhedron is F x (F - 1) x (F - 2) x (F - 3) x • • • x 3 x 2\nx 1. This expression is usually written in the shorthand notation F! (read 'F\nfactorial'). At this point it is necessary to decide which colourings count as\nbeing the same. This became hidden in the discussion of the cube and the\ndefinition will be isolated here since it is used throughout the chapter.\nSuppose that two models of a polyhedron have been coloured. Then the two\ncolourings are the same if one of the models can be rotated and repositioned\nso that it looks identical to the other with corresponding faces having like\ncolour. This can be restated as follows: Definition. Two colourings of a\npolyhedron are equivalent if there is a rotational symmetry of the polyhedron\nwhich carries one colouring onto the other. The same pattern of colours can\nappear in various orientations and the number of these different positions is\nequal to the number of rotational symmetries of the polyhedron. Arthur Cayley\nobserved that, in the case of a Platonic solid, the number of rotational\nsymmetries equals twice its number of edges.2 In the cube example, there are\n12 edges and 24 symmetries. If E denotes the number of edges of a polyhedron,\neach colouring can occur in 2F different orientations. Each of these is\ncounted as a distinct colouring when the faces of the polyhedron are labelled,\nso every pattern is repeated in the list 2F times over. To find the number of\ndifferent colourings of the unlabelled polyhedron we divide the number of\ncolourings of the labelled polyhedron by the repeat frequency.

The aim is to select any cube from the set then find eight of the\nremaining 29 cubes which can be put together to form a cube twice as high as\nthe original pieces which is coloured the same as the chosen cube on the\noutside, and so that the touching faces of adjacent cubes have the same\ncolour. 2The Platonic solids arc special in this respect—they are edge-\ntransitive as we shall see in Chapter 10. 3This puzzle, together with its\nsolution, is discussed in A. Ehrenfeucht, Tin* Cube Made Interesting,\ntranslated from the Polish by W. Zawadowski, Pergamon Press 1964, pp53 58.\n\n330 Chapter 9 How many colourings are there? In the previous section a\nparticular case of the question 'How many colour ings are there?' was\nconsidered, namely, 'How many different ways are there to colour a polyhedron\nwith F faces if no two faces have the same colour?'. The answer was shown to\nbe ^, where n is the number of rotational symmetries of the polyhedron. The\nmore general problem of finding the number of different ways to colour a\npolyhedron where the colour of each face can be freely chosen from a given set\nof colours is more difficult. For example, how many indistinguishable\ncolourings of a square-based pyramid are there using only black and white?\nIgnoring the symmetries of the pyramid, we see that there can be at most 2r> =\n32 such colourings since the pyramid has five faces and each of them can be\neither black or white independently. In fact, there are only 12\nindistinguishable colourings and the situation is simple enough that they can\nall be found by hand. The four triangular faces can be coloured either all\nwhite, three white and one black, two white and two black, one white and three\nblack, or all black. The case where ■ there are two faces of each colour\nproduces two types of pattern according to whether opposite faces have the\nsame colour or not. Each of the other cases gives rise to a single type of\npattern. All six pattern types are shown in Figure 9.1. Each can occur whether\nthe square face is black or white, so there is a total of 12 different\ncolourings. Figure 9.1. Overhead views of six coloured pyramids. The problem\nof determining the number of different colourings becomes more difficult as\nthe number of faces of the polyhedron increases. A large number of colours, or\na high degree of symmetry of the polyhedron also complicates the problem. For\ninstance, try to imagine how many different colourings of a cube there are\nwhich use at most five colours. Fortunately, we do not have to make an\nexhaustive search and list all the possibilities to answer this kind of\nquestion. There is a technique which allows us to calculate the number of\ndifferent colourings of any polyhedron with any number of colours. By applying\nthis method, we shall see that the cube has 800 such colourings.\n\nA COUNTING THEOREM 331 A counting theorem Trying to determine the number of\nways a polyhedron can be coloured is an example of a more general class of\nproblems that concern the number of ways in which something can happen.\nCounting the number of chemical isomers of a molecule is another example. This\nkind of problem can often be solved bv using group theory. The method\ndescribed below is an application of an abstract result in group theory\ngenerally known as Burnside's Lemma or Burnside's Counting Theorem after\nWilliam Burnside (1852-1927), although the theorem originates in work by G.\nFrobenius. The theorem is not stated in its general context here, neither is a\nproof given for the special case of colourings. Rather, the black and white\ncolourings of the square-based pyramid are analysed in detail to show how the\nresulting formula is derived and illustrate why the method works. For the\npurposes of the following discussion it is necessary to make a distinction\nbetween colourings of labelled and unlabelled polyhedra. The term colouring\nwill be used when referring to labelled polyhedra (those in which all the\nfaces can be distinguished regardless of symmetry), and colouring type when\nreferring to unlabelled polyhedra. Thus a colouring is a particular assignment\nof colours to labelled faces, and colouring type refers to the pattern so\nproduced; different colourings may have the same colouring type. When asking\nhow many different ways a polyhedron can be coloured we want to know the\nnumber of colouring types. Burnside's theorem gives a formula for the number\nof colouring types in terms of the numbers of colourings with particular\nproperties. The latter quantities are straightforward to calculate and this\nmakes the formula effective. Example. Re-analysing the pyramid. To simplify\nthe situation slightly, assume that the base of the square-based pyramid has\nbeen coloured white. Each of the other four faces can be either black or white\nindependently. This results in a set of 24 = 16 possible colourings of the\npyramid. We now make a list of the symmetries which each of these coloured\npolyhedra possesses. The (direct) symmetries of the pyramid comprise the\nidentity and three rotations about the axis joining the centre of the base to\nthe apex. Two of the rotations are 4-fold, the other is 2-fold. A symmetry\noperation in this set is a symmetry of a coloured pyramid if it carries the\ncoloured pyramid to a position indistinguishable from its original one. This\nrequires that the faces are carried onto faces of like colour. The list of the\n16 colourings and their symmetries is given in Table 9 3. The first column\nassigns a number to each colouring. The next column describes the colours of\neach of the four triangular faces. These faces of the pyramid can be\n\n332 Chapter 9 Figure 9.2. labelled 'front', 'back', 'left', and 'right' as\nshown in Figure 9.2. The symbol in the second column of the table gives the\n(initial letters of the) colours of the faces in the cyclic order: 'front',\n'left', 'back', 'right'. Thus the colouring in the sixth row is a pyramid\nwhose 'front' and 'back' faces are coloured black, and whose 'left' and\n'right' faces are white. The third column indicates the symmetries possessed\nby each particular colouring. The symmetries are labelled 1 for the identity,\nV2 for the 2-fold rotation, r± for the 4-fold rotation clockwise, and r^1 for\nthe 4-fold rotation counter-clockwise. A tick (/) under a particular symmetry\nindicates that a colouring possesses that symmetry. The horizontal lines\ndivide up the colourings into the six colouring types found previously, and\nthe final column describes each of these types. The aim now is to calculate\nthe number of ticks in the table. This will be done in two ways: first by\nadding the totals of each column, and second by adding the totals of each\nhorizontal division. Since these two calculations must give the same result,\nthey can be equated and a formula deduced for the number of types of\ncolouring. The number of ticks in each column is the number of colourings\nwhich have a particular symmetry. Every colouring has the identity symmetry;\nfour colourings have 2-fold rotational symmetry; only two colourings have\n4-fold rotational symmetry. The total number of ticks in the table is (the\nnumber of colourings with symmetry 1) + (the number of colourings with\nsymmetry r-i) + (the number of colourings with symmetry r4) + (the number of\ncolourings with symmetry rj1). The sum can be written in a concise form using\nthe summation notation: y^ (the number of colourings with symmetry s) s in d\nwhere the summation variable s ranges over all the symmetries of the\npolyhedron. This sum is quite easy to calculate for a given polyhedron and any\nset of colours: it is this that makes the resulting formula useful.\n\nA COUNTING THEOREM 333 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Colouring\n(W,W,W,W) (W,W,W,B) (W,W,B,W) (W,B,W,W) (B,W,W,W) (B,W,B,W) (W,B,W,B)\n(B,B,W,W) (B,W,W,B) (W,W,B,B) (W,B,B,W) (B,B,B,W) (B,B,W,B) (B,W,B,B)\n(W,B,B,B) (B,B,B,B) 1 r2 r4 r^1 //// / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / ////\nColouring type all white three white and one black two white, two black,\nopposite faces the same two white, two black, opposite faces different one\nwhite and three black all black Table 9.3. The symmetries of the different\ncolourings of a pyramid. The second part of the analysis consists of\ncalculating the number of ticks in each horizontal division, then adding the\nresults. For this we need an important result from group theory which is known\nas the Orbit-Stabiliser Theorem.4 Its technicalities need not concern us since\nits consequences are clearly visible in the table: in each of the horizontal\ndivisions which correspond to a colouring type there are precisely four ticks.\nThe reason that four occurs here is that the1 pyramid has four symmetries.\nMore generally, the theorem implies that /'number of colourings with\\ /number\nof symmetries\\ \\a particular colouring type/ \\oi that colouring type/ _ (\nnumber of symmetries of \\ — \\the uncoloured polyhedron/ ' In the pyramid\nexample, there are two colourings which have the colouring type 'two black,\ntwo white, opposites the same', namely colourings 6 and 7.

The number of colourings of a square-based pyramid. In this\nfirst example, the square-based pyramid is analysed again, this time\nconsidering the general case of how many colourings with n colours aie\ndistinguishable. We need to determine the number of colourings which possess\neach type of symmetry. Every colouring has the identity symmetry, and the\ntotal number of colourings is n5 since there is a choice of n colours for each\nof the five faces of the pyramid. How many colourings have 2-fold rotational\nsymmetry? This symmetry places a restriction on the arrangement of the colours\non the triangular faces: the front and back faces must be of the same colour,\nand so must the left and right faces. There are three choices to be made: a\ncolour for the base, a colour for the front-back pair, and a colour for the\nleft-right pair. Each of the three choices is made from n colours so there are\nn3 colourings which have 2-fold symmetry. If a colouring has 4-fold rotational\nsymmetry then all of the triangular faces must have the same colour. There are\ntwo choices to be made: a colour for the base of the pyramid, and a colour for\nthe other four faces. Thus there aie n2 colourings with 4-fold symmetry. Both\nof the 4-fold symmetries contribute the same number of colourings to the\nsummation. Substituting these values into the above formula, and recalling\nthat the pyramid has four symmetries gives that the /number of types \\ \\ of\ncolouring J\n\nApplications of the counting theorem 335 number of different colourings of a\nsquare-based pyramid using n colours is n5 + n3 + n2 + n2 = i/4n2(n3 + n + 2).\nWhen n is 2 this evaluates to 12, which is the same result as before. Example.\nThe number of colourings of a regular tetrahedron. choice choice choice choice\n(a) (b) Figure 9.4. Firstly, we need to calculate the number of colourings\nwhich have a given symmetry of the tetrahedron. Again, the number of\ncolourings using at most n colours will be found. The regular tetrahedron has\n12 direct symmetries: the identity, eight 3-fold rotations, and three 2-fold\nrotations. The number of colourings with the identity symmetry is n4 since\nthere are four faces and there is a choice of n colours for each face. A\n3-fold rotation axis passes through the centre of one face (which will be\ncalled the base) and the opposite vertex. For the colouring to have 3-fold\nsymmetry, the three faces adjacent to the base must all be the same colour. So\nthere are only two choices of colour: one choice of colour for the base, and\none for the other three faces (Figure 9.4(a)). As each of the choices can be\nmade independently from the set of n colours, there are n2 colourings with\n3-fold symmetry. The 2-fold axes pass through the midpoints of opposite edges.\nTherefore, both faces adjacent to an edge which meets the axis must have the\nsame colour. The faces separate into two pairs, and again there are two\nchoices of colour, one for each pair (Figure 9.4(b)). So there are n2\ncolourings with 2-fold symmetry. The formula now gives the number of\nindistinguishable ways to colour a regular\n\n336 Chapter 9 tetrahedron using at most n colours: V12 (n4 + 8n2 + 3n2) = V12\nn2{n2 + 11). Problem. Find the five different colourings of the tetrahedron\nusing black and white. Example. The number of colourings of a cube. The 24\nsymmetries of a cube can be broken up into five families, each of which must\nbe considered individually. Since the cube has six faces, the total number\nchoice choice choice choice choice choice choice (a) (b) choice choice choice\nchoice choice (c) (d) Figure 9.5.\n\nProper colourings 337 of colourings (all of which have the identity symmetry)\nis n6. There are six 4-fold rotations. An axis of one of these symmetries\njoins the centres of opposite laces. Assume that the axis is vertical. There\nare three choices of colour: one each for the top and bottom faces, and one\nfor the other four faces which must all be the same colour (Figure 9.5(a)). So\nn3 colourings have this 4-fold symmetry. Each of the three 4-fold axes is also\nan axis of 2-fold rotational symmetry. There are now four choices of colour:\none each for the top and the bottom; the four other faces divide into two\npairs of opposite faces, and a colour can be chosen for each pair (Figure\n9.5(b)). There are eight 3-fold rotations whose axes are the diagonals of the\ncube joining opposite vertices. With this axis in a vertical position, the two\nchoices of colour are: one for the upper three faces, and one for the lower\nthree (Figure 9.5(c)). Thus there are n2 colourings preserved bv this 3-fold\nsymmetry. Lastly, there are six more 2-fold rotations to consider whose axes\njoin the midpoints of opposite edges. With one of these axes vortical, the\nthree independent choices of colour are: one for the two upper faces which\nmeet the axis, one for the two lower faces meeting the axis, and one for the\nremaining pair of opposite faces (Figure 9.5(d)). Thus there are n3 colourings\nwhich have this 2-fold symmetry. Substituting all these data into the formula\ngives that the number of different ways to colour a cube in at most n colours\nis V24 (n6 + 6n3 + 3n4 + 8n2 + 6n3) = V24n2(n4+3n2 + 12n + 8). As mentioned\nabove, substituting n = 5 into this formula shows there are 800 colourings\nusing at most five colours. Problem. Find the ten different colourings of the\ncube using only black and white. Problem. The adventurous reader who wants to\ntry out this technique may like to verify that the number of ways to colour a\nregular octahedron with at most n colours is y24n2(n6 + 17n2 + 6). Proper\ncolourings The only restriction placed on the colourings in the previous\nsections was that each face be coloured in a single colour. This allowed the\nwhole polyhedron to be painted in a single colour which does not show up any\nstructural features of the polyhedron. In this section, an additional\nrequirement is forced upon the colouring: faces that share a common edge must\nhave different colours. One lesult of this is that the outlines of the faces\nstand out and their individual shapes show up. A colouring which has this\nproperty is called a proper colouring.\n\n338 Chapter 9 As before, the question can be asked 'How many different proper\ncolourings of a polyhedron are there which use a given number of colours?'. As\nmight be expected, this extra restriction on the behaviour of a colouring\nsubstantially reduces the number of possibilities. Among the 57 colourings of\na cube which use at most three colours, there is a unique proper colouring.\nOut of almost 60 million colourings of the icosahedron using at most three\ncolours, only 144 are proper colourings. Some of them are illustrated\nschematically in Figure 9.C and the others can be obtained from these by\npermuting the colours and taking their mirror images. The first seven are\nunchanged by swapping pairs of colours but do change when the colours are\ncycled. Reflections also give new colourings so these patterns contribute 42\ncolourings. For the next two patterns, swapping two colours or taking a\nreflection achieves the same result. This gives another 12 colourings. The\nnext pattern is the only one which has mirror symmetry. All six permutations\nof the colours give different colourings. For the remaining seven patterns,\nall permutations of the colours and reflections give different colourings— 84\nin all.5 It may seem surprising that, in some situations, it is impossible to\nfind a proper colouring of a polyhedron with the given number of colours. Foi\nexample, the tetrahedron cannot be properly coloured with three or fewer\ncolouis since each of its four faces touches all of the others, forcing every\nface to have a different colour. With four colours, however, there are two\nenantiomorphic proper colourings. This shows that four colours are necessary\nto colour the tetrahedron. Rather than investigate how many proper colourings\nare possible using a given number of colours, it is perhaps more pertinent to\nask whether a proper colouring is possible at all. We have already seen that\nthe tetrahedron requires four colours. The cube cannot be properly coloured\nwith two colours since three faces meet at a vertex and each of them must be\ncoloured differently. However, three colours are sufficient. For the regular\noctahedron, only two colours are required, and it can be properly coloured in\nthe manner of a chessboard. It would be nice to be able to determine how many\ncolours are necessary to properly colour a given polyhedron by inspection,\nthat is to say, just by checking whether the polyhedron has particular\nproperties. An example of this was used above to show that the cube could not\nbe properly coloured with two colours—its faces meet wrongly at the vertices.\nThis observation can be extended to provide a complete characterisation of\nproperly 2-colourable polyhedra. This means that there is a property which is\nshared by all polyhedra that can be properlv coloured in two colours and which\nonly they possess. rjFor further information on how to enumerate these\ncolourings see W.

Schematic diagrams showing the proper colourings of the icosa-\nhedron. Theorem. A polyhedron can be properly coloured with two colours if,\nand only if, every vertex is surrounded by an even number of faces. PROOF:\nSuppose that a polyhedron is properly coloured with two colours. Then the\ncolours must alternate on the faces around any vertex. This implies that there\nis an even number of faces around each vertex. To show the converse, it is\nsufficient to describe a method for colouring an\n\n340 Chapter 9 even-valent polyhedron in two colours. To start the procedure,\nchoose a face of the polyhedron and colour it white. This face will be denoted\nby Fw. Those faces that share an edge with this face must be coloured black so\nthat now the patch of coloured faces has a black border. All the faces\nadjacent to a black face which are still uncoloured can be coloured white\nleaving a white border to the patch. To ensure that the patch of colours can\nbe extended in this way by adding white and black faces alternately until the\nwhole polyhedron is coloured, we must show that a contradiction cannot arise:\nat no time is an uncoloured face1 adjacent to both a black and a white face.\nLet Fu be an uncoloured face of the polyhedron. A line on the polyhedron\njoining Fw to Fv which does not pass through any vertices, and which crosses\neach edge at most once, is called a route from Fw to Flf (see Figure 9.7(a)).\nSince the faces along the route will be coloured alternately white and black,\nthe colour given to Fu depends on the number of edges of the polyhedron\ncrossed by the route: if the route crosses an even number of edges then Fu\nwill be white, if an odd number then black. We need to show that all routes\nfrom Fw to Fu cross an even number of edges, or all routes cross an odd number\nof edges. Choose two routes from Fw to Fu- Since the polyhedron is spherical,\none of these routes can be deformed (or rerouted) so that it coincides with\nthe other. While this deformation is performed, the route line will pass\nthrough some vertices of the polyhedron (Figure 9.7(b)). But since an even\nnumber of edges meet at every vertex, the parity of the length of the route\nremains constant: if the length were odd going around the vertex one way, it\nwould also be odd via the other; similarly for even length paths. Therefore,\nthe colour given to face Fu does not depend on the route chosen. No ambiguity\ncan result. ■ This theorem was known over a century ago and was discussed bv\nPeter Guthrie Tait in 1880. It provides an easily verifiable prescription to\ntest whether a polyhedron is 2-colourable. Furthermore, the test is\nconclusive: if a polyhedron passes then a 2-colouring exists; if it fails then\nsuch a colouring is impossible. Having obtained such a complete solution to\nthe problem of identifying those polyhcdra that can be properly 2-coloured, it\nis natural to progress to a slightly more complex situation and ask whether it\nis possible to characterise the 3- colourable polyhedra. Clearly, a polyhedron\nwhich is properly coloured in two colours can also be properly coloured in\nthree colours just by recolouring any one of the faces with a third colour.\nHence, any even-valent polyhedron can be properly 3-coloured. It is also clear\nthat the even-valent polyhedra do not exhaust all the possibilities. The cube,\nfor example, can be properly coloured in three colouis Perhaps it is too\noptimistic to expect that a simple criterion can be found which will determine\nwhether or not any polyhedron can be properly coloured with three\n\nProper colourings 341 colours. However, in two families of polyhedra a\ncharacterisation has been found. These are the 3-valent polyhedra, and the\npolyhedra whose faces are all triangles. These families are sometimes called\nthe simple, and the simplicial polvhcdia respectively. Theorem. A 3-valent\npolyhedron can be properly coloured with three colours if, and only if, each\nface has an even number of sides. PROOF: Suppose that a 3-valent polyhedron\nhas been properly coloured with three colours red, green and blue. Choose a\nred face and look at the faces which are adjacent to it. They must be either\nblue or green. As three faces meet at every vertex, the colours must be\nalternately blue and green around the boundaiv of the red face. Hence, the red\nface has an even number of sides. A similar argument can be applied to every\nface. Figure 9.7.\n\n342 Chapter 9 The converse is proved by describing a colouring procedure and\nthen showing that it cannot lead to inconsistencies. The first stage in the\ncolouring procedure is to label the vertices of the polyhedron. The current\nsituation is the reverse of that considered in the preceding theorem: here\nevery face is bounded bv an even number of sides; previously, an even number\nof edges met at every vertex. Just as it was possible to colour the faces in\ntwo colours so that every edge separated the two colours, so a similar\nargument shows (in the current context) that it is possible to label the\nvertices with (say) '+' and ' —' signs so that every edge connects a vertex\nlabelled '+' to one labelled '—'. With the vertices labelled in this fashion,\nthe faces can be coloured as follows. Choose a face and colour it red. The\ncolours of the remaining faces are determined from the faces already coloured\nand the '+' and ' —' labels of the vertices by applying the following rule:\nthe colours appear in the order red-green-blue clockwise round the '+'\nvertices and counter-clockwise round the ' —' vertices. Notice that, for\nexample, this ensures that the faces adjacent to the initial red face are\ncoloured alternately blue and green. We need to show that the patch of\ncoloured faces can be extended to cover the whole polyhedron without giving\nrise to a contradiction. As in the proof of the previous theorem, we let Fv be\nan uncoloured face and let Fr denote the starting face coloured red. We need\nto show that all the routes from Fl{ to Fv lead to the same colouring of Fu-\nAgain, we choose two routes from Fr to Fv and investigate what happens when\none is deformed into the other. When a route crosses an edge of the polyhedron\nthe colour of the next face is determined by the colouring rule. The possible\npatterns are shown in Figure 9.8. Convince yourself that, as a route is\ndeformed and passes through a vertex, the outcome is not affected. ■ If the\npolyhedron is not 3-valent then the hypothesis that the polyhedron can be\n3-coloured is not enough to guarantee all faces have an even number of sides.\nThe rhomb-icosi-dodecahedron is 4-valent and is composed of triangles,\n\\Greeri/ Red X5/ Blue Blue A /Green \\ \\Blue / Green Green A /Red \\ Red A /Blue\n\\ Figure 9.8.\n\nProper colourings 343 squares, and pentagons. If each type of face is coloured\ndifferently then a proper 3-colouring results. However, not all of the faces\nhave an even number of sides. The condition of 3-valency is also important for\nthe converse. There are examples of polyhedra, all of whose faces have an even\nnumber of sides, which cannot be properly coloured with three colours. An\nexample is shown in Figure 9.9. It can be viewed as a hexagonal prism from\nwhich two wedges have been shaved off. Its faces have either four or six sides\nbut it is not 3-valent. Suppose the base is coloured red. The six vertical\nfaces must be coloured alternately (in blue and green, say) if only three\ncolours are to be used. One of the top faces can be coloured red, but there is\nno colour remaining for the last face since it meets faces of all three\ncolours. Figure 9.9. This polyhedron cannot be properly 3-coloured. The other\nfamily of polyhedra to be considered are those with triangular faces. To prove\nthe following theorem, which characterises which of these; polyhedra are\n3-colourable, we need to know how many different routes there are on a\npolyhedron from one face to another. Recall that a route is a line on the\npolyhedron joining two faces which does not pass through any vertex, and which\ncrosses each edge at most once. It follows from work done in the early 1930's\nby Hassler Whitney that on any convex polyhedron6 there are at least three\ndistinct routes between any pair of faces. (Two routes are distinct if the\nonly faces they have in common are their end faces.) Theorem. Let P be a\npolyhedron all of whose faces are triangular. Then P can be properly coloured\nwith three colours if, and only if, P is not a tetrahedron. PROOF: We have\nalready seen that a tetrahedron requires four colours to colour it properly.\nSo we need to show that every other triangular-faced polyhedron can be\nproperly coloured with three colours. In the proofs of the two preceding\ntheorems, a method of colouring was described which was then shown to produce\na proper colouring. A different approach will be used in this proof. Here, we\nwill 6 Convexity is not the critical point here. What we are using is the fact\nthat the edge-skeleton of the combinatorial dual is 3-connected.\n\n344 Chapter 9 start with a proper colouring which contains too many colours\n(in this case four) and then show how to rearrange them so that their number\ncan be reduced. The faces of P can be coloured with the four colours red,\ngreen, blue, and yellow to produce a proper colouring of P as follows: start\nat any face and apply any colour to it; this forms the initial patch of\ncolour. This patch can be extended by colouring a face which adjoins the\npatch. Since the face is triangular, it meets at most three different colours\nand so there is always a fourth colour which can be used to colour it. In this\nway the patch of coloured faces can be extended to cover the whole polyhedron.\nThe aim now is to rearrange the colours on some of the faces of P while\nmaintaining the properness of the colouring, so that the number of yellow\nfaces is reduced. Eventually no yellow faces will remain and P will be\npropeily coloured with three colours. If there is a yellow face which meets\nfewer than three colours then there is a third colour which can be used to\nrecolour the yellow face. For example, if a yellow face meets two red faces\nand a green one, it can be recoloured blue. By using this observation, the\nyellow faces can be made to wander around on P so that they migrate towards a\ncentral place. Eventually a single yellow face remains. This then wanders to a\nplace where it can be recoloured. The details of this process will now be\ndescribed. Suppose that at least two faces of P are coloured yellow, and\nchoose a route joining two of them. A route can be described by listing the\nfaces which it passes through in order. So suppose our chosen route is F\\ —>\nF2 —> F:{ —> ■ ■ ■ —> Fn, where i*\\ and Fn are yellow. The first two faces can\nbe recoloured so that Fi is not yellow: simply uncolour the faces F\\ and F2,\nthen F\\ can be recoloured in a non-yellow colour since it meets only two other\ncolours, and F2 can then be recoloured, possibly with yellow. This process is\nillustrated in Figure 9.10. The effect of this is to shorten the length of the\nroute between the two yellow faces, or to remove one of them. This trick can\nbe repeated so that the face F2 which has just been coloured yellow can be\nrecoloured non-yellow and the (possibly) vcllow face migrates to F3 again\nreducing the distance between the two yellow faces. At the last stage, the\nface Fn_i can be coloured non-yellow since it is adjacent to a yellow face and\nat most two other colours. Thus the number of yellow faces of P can be reduced\nby one. This process can be repeated with any pair of yellow faces until\neventually a solitary yellow face remains. Now there is a single face of P\ncoloured yellow. Let F be a face of P which is not adjacent to the yellow\nface, and let A, B, C be its three neighbouring faces. At least two of these\nneighbours must have the same colour because the three non-yellow colours are\nused up by the face F itself and two of its neighbours. Suppose that faces B\nand C have the same colour. Let Fy be the vellow face of P. From the remark\nthat preceded this theorem we know that theie are\n\nProper colourings 345 Figure 9.10. three distinct routes on P which connect Fy\nto F, one passing through each of A, B, and C. The route which we need is the\none passing through A, that is, FY —»--•—>■ A —>■ F. The same procedure that\nwas used above can be repeated on this route so that the yellow face migrates\nalong the route towards F. This time, when we reach the end, there is certain\nto be a non-yellow colour with which to label F. Its two neighbours, B and C,\ndid not appear on the route and so have\n\n346 Chapter 9 not been recoloured. Therefore, they still share the same\ncolour. This means that at most two different colours are adjacent to F and\nthere is a non-yellow colour with which it can be coloured. All of the yellow\nfaces have now been removed from P and it is properly coloured in red, green\nand blue. ■ Problem. If this construction were applied to a tetrahedron to\nproduce a proper 3-colouring, it would fail. Why? More specifically, the proof\nuses a property of polyhedra which all triangle-faced polyhedra have except\nthe tetrahedron. What is the property and where is it used? Although we have\nestablished a few useful results, the general problem of determining whether\nan arbitrary polyhedron can be properly coloured with three colours is not\neasy. One result in this direction concerns the number of places in a\npolyhedron where three colours are essential. Such places occur at 3-valent\nvertices where each of the three incident faces has an edge in common with the\nother two, thus forcing three colours to be used around the vertex. Another\nsituation where three colours are essential occurs when three faces form a\ntriangular tube. In both of these situations, there is a set of three faces\nwhich are mutually adjacent. Such a set is called a 3-cycle of faces. The two\nforms are illustrated in Figure 9.11. Figure 9.11. A 3-valent vertex and a\ntriangular tube both contain 3-cycles of faces. In the late 1950's Herbert\nGrotzsch proved that polyhedra which do not contain any 3-cycles of faces can\nbe properly coloured with three colours. Later (1963) Branko Griinbaum\nextended the theorem to the following. Theorem. Every polyhedron which\ncontains at most three 3-cycles of faces can be properly coloured with three\ncolours. ■ In some respects this is the best result possible. A further\nincrease in the number of 3-cycles allowed is not possible since the\ntetrahedron has four 3-cycles (one at each vertex) and it cannot be properly\ncoloured in three colours. On the other hand, this is not the complete set of\nproperly 3-colourable polyhedra since the cube has six 3-cycles and is still\nproperly 3-colourable.\n\nHOW MANY COLOURS ARE NECESSARY? 347 How many colours are necessary? As the\nnumber of available colours is increased further, one might think that the\nproblem of determining which families of polyhedra can be properlv coloured\nwould get still more difficult. In fact, this is not the case. If your paint-\nbox is sufficiently large then you can properly colour every polyhedron placed\nbefore you. It is a simple consequence of Euler's formula that a palette\ncontaining six colours is large enough to properly colour any polyhedron.\nTheorem. Every polyhedron can be properly coloured with at most six colours.\nPROOF: A colouring of the faces of P is a topological property. Therefore, no\nrelevant information is lost if P is continuously deformed, and we can assume\nthat P is a coloured network on a sphere. We shall prove the theorem foi such\nspherical networks. Let F be the number of faces of P, and suppose that we\nhave established that all spherical networks with fewer than F faces can be\nproperly colouied with at most six colours. One of the corollaries of Euler's\nformula is that every polyhedron contains at least one face with fewer than\nsix sides. For the purposes of illustration, assume that P contains a\npentagonal face. There is a polyhedral network, Q, which has F — 1 faces, and\nwhich is the same as P except near this face whore the two networks differ as\nshown in Figure 9.12. Since Q has fewer than F faces, it can be properly\ncoloured with at most six colours (by hypothesis). The corresponding faces of\nP can, therefore, also be coloured using at most six colours leaving just the\npentagonal face uncoloured. Since this face meets at most five different\ncolours, there is always a spare colour for it. Hence P can be properly\ncolouied with six or fewer colours. This analysis has reduced the problem of\ncolouring a network with F faces in six colours to colouring a network with F\n— 1 faces in six colours. If we can solve the latter (less complicated)\nproblem then we can solve the foimer. The Figure 9.12.\n\n348 Chapter 9 argument can be repeated to show that Q can be properly\n6-oolourod if we can colour all networks with F — 2 faces in six colours.\nProceeding in this fashion we can reduce the complexity of the problem (number\nof faces) as far as we wish. Once we reach the situation where 'We can colour\nP if we can colour a network with six faces' the problem is solved because\nevery polyhedral network with six or fewer faces can be properly coloured\nusing at most six colours: each face can be painted a different colour. (This\nstrategy is called the inductive method of proof. In this case we used\ninduction on the number of faces.) ■ This theorem raises a new question: if\nsix colours are sufficient to colour every polyhedron, how many are necessary?\nDetermining how many colours are required is a problem with a history dating\nback to the middle of the nineteenth century. It has been known since the\n1890's that any polyhedron can be properly coloured with five colours. But\ntrying to decide whether every polyhedron can be properly coloured with four\ncolours turned out to be very complex. It became one of the best known\nunsolved problems in mathematics, and in the end was resolved only with the\naid of a computer. The four-colour problem The problem of finding proper\ncolourings of polyhedra is a particulai case of a more general topological\nproblem, namely, colouring the faces of a polyhedral network on a sphere.\nAnother case of this problem is colouring maps on a globe, and indeed, this is\nthe original setting of the four-colour problem. Alfred Bray Kempe (1849-1922)\nwriting in Nature in 1880 described it like this: The problem is to show how\nthe districts of a map may ho coloured with four colours, so that no two\ndistricts which have a common boundary or boundaries shall be of the same\ncolour. The object o/ this colouring being to make the division of the map\ninto districts clear without reference to boundary lines which may be confused\nwith rivers, etc., it is obvious that nothing will be lost if districts which\nare remote from each other, or touch only at detached points arc coloured the\nsame colour} Kempe's article goes on to describe his proposed solution to the\nproblem which we shall see later. The origin of the problem has been traced\nback a further 25 years to Fiancis Guthrie (1831-1899). He observed that he\nneeded only four colours to colour a map of the English counties and wondered\nwhether this would alwavs be the case, whatever the map. He wrote to his\nyounger brother, then at university in London,\n\nThe four-colour problem 349 who raised the problem with Augustus De Morgan\n(1806-1871). De Morgan could not solve it and wrote of it in a letter to\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton in the autumn of 1852. This is the earliest documented\nreference to the four-colour problem. A major source of confusion and\nmisunderstanding of this problem stems from the fact that no arrangement of\nfive faces exists so that each is adjacent to the other four, thus forcing\nfive colours to be used. De Morgan proved that it is impossible to construct\nfive mutually adjacent faces. Prior to this, in the 1840's, Auguste Ferdinand\nMobius teased his students by asking them to divide a kingdom into five parts,\neach having a border with the other four, so that the land could be shared\nbetween the king's five sons. To see why this fact is not sufficient to solve\nthe problem, consider an analogous situation involving only three colours. The\npresence of four mutually adjacent faces in a polyhedral network prevents or\nobstructs attempts to pioperly colour the network in three or fewer colours.\nThe obstruction is localised and is due to the arrangement of only four faces\nof the whole network. A pentagonal- based prism does not have any set of four\nmutually adjacent faces and thus has no local obstructions to proper colouring\nin three colours. However, foui colours are still required to achieve a proper\ncolouring. In this case there is a global obstruction to proper colouring in\nthree colours—the nature of the polyhedron as a whole prevents a proper\ncolouring in fewer than four colours. De Morgan and Mobius knew that five\nmutually adjacent faces cannot exist. So there are no polyhedral networks that\ncontain a local obstruction to proper colouring with four colours. This does\nnot prove the four-colour problem is true in eveiv case because there may be\nan example of a global obstruction. Problem. Convince yourself that a\npentagonal prism cannot be propcilv coloured with only three colours. The\nfour-colour problem received little attention until it was publicised by\nArthur Cayley. At a meeting of the London Mathematical Society in 1878, he\nasked whether anyone could solve it. This prompted Kempe to woik on the\nproblem and the following year he proposed a solution. His argument is similar\nto the proof of the 6-colour theorem above, though he describes a procedmc by\nwhich the colours can be rearranged so that fewer than six colours aie\nrequired. Kempe's argument. The structure of Kempe's proof is the same as that\nin the preceding theorem: lie uses induction on the number of faces. The\ntetrahedron, with four faces, piovides a foundation for the induction since it\ncan clearly be properly coloured with four colours. Given a polyhedron with F\nfaces, we assume that every polyhedron having fewer than F faces can be\nproperly coloured with four colours. In the same way as before, we can colour\nall but one of the faces using at most four\n\n350 Chapter 9 colours. The problem is to show that the colouring can be\nextended to covei the last remaining face. If the uncoloured face has fewer\nthan four sides then it is clear that this is possible. Suppose that the\nuncoloured face has four sides. If the four adjacent faces do not use all four\ncolours then there is a colour left over which can be used to colour the final\nface. If all four colours do appear on the adjacent faces then Kcmpe showed\nhow to rearrange some of the colours to overcome this problem. Suppose that\nthe colours surround the uncoloured face in the order led, blue, yellow,\ngreen. Kempe's idea was to look at areas coloured in two colours. In this\nexample, areas coloured red-or-yellow and areas of blue-or-green. This can be\nthought of as red-yellow continents and islands, and blue-green oceans and\nlakes. These two-coloured regions are now called Kernpe chains. It is possible\nthat the blue face and the green face adjacent to the uncoloured face both\nbelong to the same sea, or that the red face and the yellow face adjacent to\nthe uncoloured face both belong to the same landmass but, since the network is\ndrawn in a splieie, it is impossible for both of these to happen\nsimultaneously. So assume, foi example, that the red face and the yellow face\nare in different islands. Then the colours red and yellow can be interchanged\non one of the islands without destroying the properness property of the\ncolouring. When this is done the uncoloured face is adjacent only to blue,\ngreen and yellow faces and so red can be used to colour the final face. This\nprocess is illustrated in Figure 9.13. The squaie face in the upper diagram\nmeets all four colours. The faces on the left and right of this square belong\nto the same Kempe chain so interchanging the colours in this chain will not\nhelp. However, if the colours in the Kempe chain above the1 squaie are\ninterchanged, a colour becomes available to colour the square (as shown in the\nlower diagram). This trick can be applied when the uncoloured face has five\nsides. However, this only reduces the number of different colours adjacent to\nthe uncoloured face to four. Kempe assumed that the trick could be repeated on\ndifferent pairs of colours so that the uncoloured pentagon was adjacent to at\nmost three different colours. However, there is a flaw in this assumption. It\nwent unnoticed foi moie than a decade, but in 1890 Percy John Heawood (1861\n1955) found an example for which Kempe's method fails. Kempe's argument does\nshow, howevei. that five colours are always sufficient to colour any\npolyhedral netwoik on a sphere. Although Kempe's proof turned out to be\nincomplete, it contains the basis of the technique which was used to solve the\nproblem. The idea is to contract a subset of faces, colour the remaining faces\n(by induction), replace the contiacted faces, then show how to extend the\ncolouring to the whole netwoik. This process\n\n£IQ amSij 's/ ISC HSiaOHd HnOlOO-HAOd 3HX\n\n352 Chapter 9 is called reduction, and the patch of faces, or configuration,\nfor which this method works is said to be reducible. Kempe found two reducible\nconfigurations In both of his examples the configuration consists of a single\nface: cither tiiangular or four-sided. His argument failed to show that\npentagons are reducible. Reducible configurations are one of the twin pillars\non which the final proof stands. The other is the notion of unavoidability. A\nset of eonfigmations is unavoidable if every polyhedral network must contain\nat least one of them. Kempe's unavoidable set, derived as a consequence of\nEuler's formula, contained three configurations: a triangle, a quadrangle, and\na pentagon. One way to solve the four-colour problem is to find an unavoidable\nset in which every configuration is reducible. Unfortunately Kempe's set is\nnot sufficient since the pentagon is not known to be reducible. Figure 9.14.\nGeorge David Birkhoff (1884-1944) analysed Kempe's work and, aftei\ncontributing some new ideas of his own, was able to show that some larger\nconfigurations were reducible. An example is the diamond configuration of\npentagons shown in Figure 9.14. Building on this work, Philip Franklin (1898\n1965) proved that a smallest counter-example to the four-colour problem must\nhave at least 26 faces, and consequently every polyhedral network with 25\nfaces or fewer can be properly coloured with four colours. In subsequent years\nthis bound was increased. In 1926 C. N. Reynolds showed a counter-example must\nhave at least 28 faces; in 1936, Franklin raised this to 32 faces; in 1938 C.\nE. Winn reached 36 faces. In 1968, Oystein Ore and Joel Stemple proved that\nevery polvhedral network with 40 or fewer faces can be properly coloured with\nfour coloms. so a counter-example has at least 41 faces. Through this\ncollective efibit nianv configurations had been shown to be reducible, but the\nnumber of these was nowhere near sufficient to form an unavoidable set.\nHeinrich Heesch began working on the four-colour problem in the 1930's. He\nbecame convinced that it could be solved by finding an unavoidable set of\nreducible configurations. In the 1950's he estimated that such a set would be\nquite large, possibly containing 10 000 configurations, but that each\nconfigura-\n\nThe four-colour problem 353 tion would be limited in size. At the time, this\nstrategy seemed to offer little prospect of producing a solution because of\nthe huge amount of calculation involved. However, the arrival of computers and\ntheir rapid development meant that this kind of attack became feasible. In\nsurveying the known techniques for proving that a configuration was reducible,\nHeesch noticed at least one procedure was mechanical enough to be performed by\nmachine. His student Karl Diirre wrote a program to test the re- ducibility of\nconfigurations. As with many techniques, when the program was successful, the\nconfiguration was reducible, but a failure signified only that the method was\nnot powerful enough, not that no way of reducing the configuration existed.\nDuring the testing of many configurations, Heesch noticed that configurations\ncontaining particular patterns were never reduced by the program. He found\nthree such obstacles to reduction and all of them are easily described. No\nconfiguration which contains one of these obstacles has yet been reduced.\nHeesch also developed a technique for producing unavoidable sets. The method\nis based on the idea of moving charge around an electrical network. A\ndischarging procedure is an algorithm for redistributing initial charges in a\nnetwork. Charge cannot be created or destroyed in the process and the\nalgorithm must stop, and not circulate charge forever. By analysing the\npossible outcomes, the places where charge accumulates can be used to\nconstruct an unavoidable set of configurations. Changing the algorithm\nproduces different sets. In 1970, Wolfgang Haken noticed ways to improve\nHeesch's discharging procedures. He hoped that such improvements might be\nsufficient to solve the four- colour problem. His planned attack on the\nproblem is outlined schematically irr Figure 9.15. Before embarking on such a\nprogramme it is helpful to have some1 kind of indication that such a strategy\nis likely to succeed. What if the unavoidable set is very large? What if\nchecking for reducibility takes so long that the project would take decades or\ncenturies to complete? What if an unavoidable set of reducible configurations\ndoes not exist and the process never stops? In 1972 Haken was joined by\nKenneth Appel and they began computer experiments to try to answer some of\nthese questions and to search for an effective discharging procedure. After\nsome months of experimenting, gathering information about the likely sizes of\nconfigurations in an unavoidable set and the size of the set itself, they\ndecided to prove that their method of attack had a reasonable chance of\nsuccess. This involved arguing from certain assumptions that a discharging\nprocedure which produced an unavoidable set of reducible configurations was\n'overwhelmingly likely' to exist. Their first observation was that for\nconfigurations with a given perimeter, the likelihood of reducibilitv\nincreases with the complexity of the interior. This means that when\nconfigurations are sufficiently large they are almost certain to be reducible.\nThis makes it verv unlikely that the process can run forever. The next step\nwas to show that \"suf-\n\n354 Chapter 9 1 Modify the discharging algorithm / i h ^ ves (start) V Use a\ndischarging algorithm to generate an unavoidable set v Does any configuration\ncontain a reduction obstacle' no v Is every configuration reducible^ yes v a\nPROBLEM SOLVED °> Figure 9.15. ficiently large' configurations are actually\nsmall enough to bo manageable and that, therefore, the process would finish in\na reasonable amount of time. In 1975 their attention turned to developing\ncomputer programs that would test configurations for reducibility. By 1976\nthey were ready to start constructing a suitable set of configurations. The\ndischarging procedure used to genoiato the unavoidable set was implemented by\nhand. This meant that the procedure was more flexible and could be modified as\nrequired. Over the first six months of 197C the discharging procedure was\nrefined until at last an unavoidable sot of reducible configurations was\nproduced. The final set contained almost 2000 ooiihguiations. What is proof?\nWhen Appel and Haken announced their proof it caused much controversy in the\nmathematical community. The fame of the problem and its apparent simplicity\nhave led many mathematicians to try to settle it. The announcement of a proof\nled people to expect that some brilliant insight had been discovered, and\nmaiiv were dismayed and disappointed to find that it involved analysing\nhundreds of cases by computer. Also people became suspicious when they\nrealised that computer calculations were essential to the proof. Although the\ndischarging prooodme can be performed by hand and the generation of the\nunavoidable set can bo chocked, most of the configurations are so complicated\nthat proving reducibilitv can bo achieved only with the use of a computer.\nAppel and Haken themselves lcmarked 'It does not seem possible to check the\nreducibility computations themselves by hand.'\n\nWhat is proof? 355 This raises philosophical questions concerning the nature\nof proof. A mathematical proof is supposed to leave no room for doubt, to\ndeduce guaranteed conclusions from an agreed starting point. Prior to the\nintroduction of computers, the arguments used in proofs could always be\nverified by other mathematicians; each step in the deduction from hypothesis\nto conclusion could be checked for its logical validity. When many of these\nsteps are performed by a computer, and the calculations can be verified only\nby other computers, a mathematician has to ask himself whether his faith that\ncomputers behave as they ought is equal to his faith in his own reasoning\nability. Three other examples of computer-assisted proof have been mentioned\nin earlier chapters. Both V. A. Zalgaller's enumeration of convex polyhedra\nwith regular faces (Chapter 2) and J. Skilling's enumeration of uniform\npolyhedra (Chapter 4) used a computer to search for new possibilities. In both\ncases, a previously known list was shown to be complete. Unlike the four-\ncoloui problem, neither of these problems was particularly well-known and so\nthese confirmations did not attract much attention. Maksimov's proof that all\npolyhedra with fewer than nine vertices are rigid (Chapter 6) also made use of\na computer. Another use of computers in mathematics is to test large numbers\nfoi primal- ity. In a computational sense there is no difference between a\ncomputer calculation which shows that a large number is prime and another\nwhich shows that a configuration is reducible. The difference lies in the\ninterpretation of the results. Both types of calculation can be seen as\nestablishing certain facts whose truth depends on the correct working of the\ncomputer. In the first case, these facts are treated as data from which one\ncan draw opinions or conjectures—about the distribution of prime numbers, for\ninstance. The data do not constitute a proof, merely an indication of what one\nmight try to prove, so a small risk of en or is tolerable. In the second case,\nan accumulation of computed facts is the proof. It can be argued that the\nnature of the calculations involved in the proof of the four-colour theorem is\nso mechanical and repetitive that, if they could be performed by hand, a human\nattempting the task would, in all probability, make more errors than a\ncomputer. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of errors\noccurring, of either human or computer origin. At this point Appel and Haken's\nmethodology provides a way out. If one accepts the assumptions underlying\ntheir probability argument that the method must succeed then there are many\ndifferent proofs of the theorem depending on the choice of discharging\nalgorithm and the resulting set of configurations which is used. So if there\nis an error in the published proof, there is almost certain to be another\nsimilar set which will suffice. The theorem is 'overwhelmingly likely' to be\ntrue. Another objection to computer proof is that it violates the aesthetic\nquality of mathematics. Mathematicians are not concerned merely with facts and\nanswers but with understanding; not only with truth but also with beauty. A\ngood proof\n\n356 Chapter 9 is supposed to expose the underlying reasons of why a result is\ntrue. When most of a proof is hidden away in a machine this psychological\nrequirement is denied. A computer provides no insight, just a mechanical\nverification. History has shown that the accepted standard of proof varies\nwith time. It is probable that this new style of proof will become accepted as\nit is used to solve other problems in the future. In fact, such proofs may bo\nnecessary to solve some problems. At the turn of the century, it was generally\nbelieved that any mathematical problem could be solved by using sufficiently\npowerful techniques. But, in the 1930's, it was shown that there are true\nstatements foi which no proofs exist, and others whose proofs are so long that\nit is impracticable lo write them down. It is possible that a conventional\nshort topological proof of the four- colour theorem will be found. However,\nAppel and Haken estimate that over ten million man-hours of effort have been\nspent trying to find such a solution. It is conceivable that their method is\nthe only way and that we are witnessing the birth of a new style of proof.\n\nFrom Perspectiva Corporum Regularium by Wenzel Jamnitzer, 1568.\n\n359 Combination, Transformation and Decoration The whole is moir th,iu the sum\nof its pints \" A list otic Some of the most fascinating polyhedral models to\nplay with arc compounds. As you turn them in your hands, the individual\ncomponents catch your eve in turn, and your attention jumps from one to\nanother as you study the intiiguing way they are interlocked. The easiest\nexamples to appreciate are those in which the individual components stand out\nclearly and are quickly recognised. For this reason compounds of regular\npolyhedra are particularly striking, especially when each component is painted\nin a different colour. Examples of compound polyhedra have appeared in earlier\nchapters. Compounds of two tetrahedra, a cube and octahedron, and a\ndodecahedion with an icosahedron were known to Kepler (Chapter 4). Compounds\nof five and ten tetrahedra, and of five octahedra occur among the stellations\nof the icosahedion (Chapter 7). We will now construct more examples. Making\nsymmetrical compounds A compound polyhedron is a set of distinct polyhedra,\ncalled the < oinponcnts of the compound, which are placed together so that\ntheir centres coincide. If the component polyhedra are of similar sizes then\nthey will probablv intersect each other, the faces of one component passing\nthrough the faces of the others. Although it is possible to make compounds of\nany polyhedra, we shall restrict attention to compounds of Platonic solids and\nin which all the components are the same. These can have a high degree of\nsymmetry which makes them verv attractive. ©\n\n360 Chapter 10 (a) (b) Figure 10.1. A tetrahedron can be inscribed in a cube\nin two ways. Consider the compound of two tetrahedra shown in Figure 10.1. It\ncan be inscribed in a cube so that the 4 + 4 vertices of the two tetrahedra\ncoincide with the eight vertices of the cube. This shows that a single\ntetrahedron can be inscribed in a cube in two different ways. The compound\nresults from doing this in both ways simultaneously. This method of inscribing\none polyhedron in another in several ways is a quick way to generate compound\npolyhedra. Recall Euclid's construction of a dodecahedron. He started with a\ncube and erected a 'roof on each face in such a way that the sloping parts on\nadjacent faces were coplanar and formed regular pentagons (Figure 10.2(a)).\nThere are two ways to erect a roof on the face of a cube. Using both\nsimultaneously produces the compound of two dodecahedra shown in Figure\n10.2(b) and Plate 16. (a) (b) Figure 10.2. A dodecahedron can be circumscribed\nabout a cube in two ways. This idea of placing one polyhedron in another in\ndifferent ways can also be used the other way round. Euclid's construction\nalso shows that a cube can be inscribed in a dodecahedron. To form a compound,\nwe do this in as many different ways as possible, simultaneously. How many\ncubes can be inscribed in a dodecahedron? Each of the 12 edges of the cube is\na diagonal of one of the 12\n\nSymmetry breaking and symmetry completion 3C1 faces of the dodecahedron. There\nare five choices for the diagonal of a pentagonal face, and therefore five\ndifferent ways to inscribe a cube in a dodecahedron. All of these cubes taken\ntogether form a compound of five cubes. The compound is shown in Plate 13. We\nknow that a tetrahedron can be inscribed in a cube in two wavs Unfortunately,\ntrying to reverse the situation does not produce a new compound: the cube can\nbe circumscribed about a tetrahedron in only one way. Symmetry breaking and\nsymmetry completion The question of how many times one polyhedron can be\ninscribed in (01 circumscribed about) another polyhedron in a particular way\nis closely related to symmetry. More precisely, it is connected with the\nsymmetry of three things: the inscribed polyhedron, the circumscribed\npolyhedron, and the compound of the two taken together. We need to introduce\nsome terminology: the inscribed polyhedron will be called the kernel, the\ncircumscribed polyhedron will be called the shell, and the compound of the\nkernel and the shell will be called the; amalgam,. In the cube-in-dodecahedron\nexample, the cube is the kernel and the dodecahedron forms the shell. The\n(rotational) symmetry groups of the kernel, shell and amalgam are O, I and T\nrespectively. Notice that the amalgam has a lower degree of symmetry than\neither the kernel or the shell alone. Some of the svmme- try has been\ndestroyed. However, in the resulting compounds of five cubes and of two\ndodecahedra, the lost symmetry has been reinstated: the five cubes have\nicosahedral symmetry; the two dodecahedra have octahedral symmetiy. This is\nnot a coincidence and the idea of reinstating destroyed symmetry can be used\nto create a variety of compounds. The cube-in-dodecahedron example will be\nexamined in more detail so that the relationships between the symmetry groups\nof the kernel, shell, amalgam and their compounds become apparent. Then this\nprocess of symmetry completion will be used to generate more compound\npolyhedra. Example. A cube in a dodecahedron. symmetry groups: kernel (cube) O\nshell (dodecahedron) I amalgam T The symmetries of the kernel can be divided\ninto two sets: those that are also symmetries of the amalgam, and those that\nare not. The first set will form a group, in this case the tetrahedral group,\nT. The other set contains the symmetries of the kernel which are destroyed in\nthe amalgam. This set is not a group since, for one thing, it does not contain\nthe identity symmetry. If these\n\n362 Chapter 10 destroyed symmetry operations are performed on the amalgam then\nthe kernel will remain unchanged because these operations are symmetries of\nthe kernel. However, they are not symmetries of the shell so the shell will be\nrallied to new positions different from the original one. In our example, the\nrotations of 90°, which are symmetries of the cube, are not symmetries of the\namalgam. They carry the dodecahedron to a second position. This compound of\ndodecahedra will then have the same symmetry as that of the kernel.\nFurthermore, the number of components can be worked out from the sizes of the\ngroups involved: /number of components in the\\ = (number of symmetries of the\nkernel) Vcompound of shell polyhedra/ _ (number of symmetries of the amalgam)'\nThis process can be applied using the symmetries of the shell in place of\nthose of the kernel. This results in a compound of kernel polyhedra which has\nthe same symmetry as the shell. The number of components is then: ( number of\ncomponents in the \\ = (number of symmetries of the shell) \\compound of kernel\npolyhedra/ _ (number of symmetries of the amalgam)' The examples here have\nproduced compounds of y| shells (that is two dodecahedra) and y| kernels (five\ncubes). Example. A tetrahedron in a cube. symmetry groups: kernel\n(tetrahedron) T shell (cube) () amalgam T The point to notice here is that the\nsymmetry groups of the kernel and the amalgam are identical. Therefore,\nalthough applying the symmetries of the shell to the amalgam produces a\ncompound of two tetrahedra, applying the symmetries of the kernel to the\namalgam does not produce anything new. Example. A cube in an octahedron.\nsymmetry groups: kernel (cube) () shell (octahedron) () amalgam D,\\ A cube can\nbe inscribed in an octahedron as shown in Figure 10.3(a). Both the kernel and\nthe shell have octahedral symmetry. However, they are arranged so that only\none pair of 4-fold axes match up in the amalgam, the othei 4-fold axes are\nreduced to 2-fold axes. This means that the amalgam has dihedral symmetry of\ntype D4. Some symmetries of both the shell and the kernel are destroyed in the\namalgam and both sets can be used to generate compounds. Reinstating the\nsymmetry of the shell gives a compound of three cubes (Figure 10.3(b)) and\n\nSymmetry breaking and symmetry completion 363 (a) (b) (c) Figure 10.3.\ncompleting the symmetry of the kernel produces a compound of three octahedra\n(Figure 10.3(c)). Both compounds have octahedral symmetry and are shown in\nPlate 14. Example. An octahedron in a cube. symmetry groups: kernel\n(octahedron) O shell (cube) O amalgam D3 An octahedron can be inscribed in a\ncube as shown in Figure 10.4(a). The symmetry of the amalgam is again dihedral\nbut is now of type /¾. Completing the symmetry of the shell gives a compound\nof four octahedra, and completing the symmetry of the kernel produces a\ncompound of four cubes. These are shown in Figures 10.4(b) and (c), and in\nPlate 15. In the above examples, the amalgam of the two polyhedra is formed by\ninscribing one polyhedron in another. The fact that the two polyhedra share\nsuch a close relationship is not essential to the process of generating new\ncompounds. All that we are doing is using a set of rules (the symmetries) to\nrepeat a given object. One of the polyhedra is a template for the components\nof the compound,\n\n364 Chapter 10 (a) (b) (c) Figure 10.4. and the other acts merely as a\nreference marker to indicate how the template is situated with respect to the\nsymmetry elements which are used to generate the compound. We can choose any\npolyhedron to be the template and repeat it using the symmetry operations in\nany symmetry group. However, the most interesting compounds arise when some of\nthe symmetries of the template coincide with those being used to generate the\ncompound. The following example illustrates some of these points. Figure 10.5\nshows two tetrahedra with a common vertex. The larger one is the template and\nthe symmetries of the other determine how it is to be repeated to generate a\ncompound. The result is the compound of four tetrahedra shown in Plate 11.\nModels of other compound polyhedra are shown in the plates. These include\ncompounds of five octahedra and five dodecahedra.\n\nAre there any regular compounds? 365 Figure 10.5. Are there any regular\ncompounds? Do any of the compounds described above (or any others) deserve the\nprestigious label of 'regular'? Clearly, since all the components of these\ncompounds are Platonic solids, all their faces are equal regular polygons and\nthe same number meet at every vertex. Even so, some are still 'more regular'\nthan others. This can be seen most clearly by examining the visible parts of\nthe faces. In some compounds the same regions are visible whichever face is\nlooked at. Others have more than one kind of face pattern. In the three\noctahedra, for example, all the faces are equivalent whereas the compound of\nthree cubes has two kinds of face. These are shown in Figure 10.6—the shaded\nparts are visible. In this latter case, the faces do not all play the same\nrole because we can distinguish the two kinds. We can also consider the\nvertices. They are all similarly surrounded but are they all\nindistinguishable? Do they all play the same role? In the compound of four\ncubes there are two kinds of vertex: some are surrounded by three kite-shaped\nportions of the square faces, others by an 'L'-shaped piece and two triangles.\nFigure 10.6.\n\n366 Chapter 10 The fact that, sometimes, some things cannot be distinguished\nhints that there is an aspect of symmetry involved. This is not surprising\nsince regularity and symmetry are closely related concepts. Regularity and\nsymmetry When considering the Platonic solids the terms 'regular' and\n'symmetrical1 are often regarded as synonyms but, if the words are taken in\ntheir technical sense, this is incorrect. The definition of regularity\nrequires that the same number of congruent regular polygons surround every\nvertex. This is a local condition which specifies how an individual face is\nsituated with respect to its neighbours. It restricts the way that faces can\nmeet. On the other hand, symmetry opeiations consider the polyhedron as a\nwhole; they take a global viewpoint. The difference between local order\nproperties and global symmetry becomes noticeable when the conditions are\napplied in a wider context. The rhomb-cub- octahedron and Miller's solid have\nthe same local order properties: their solid angles are all congruent.\nHowever, their symmetry properties are different. In the rhomb-cub-octahedron\nall the vertices are equivalent, but in Millers solid this is not the case: we\ncan distinguish two kinds of vertex when we look at their position in the\npolyhedron as a whole. The contrast between local and global viewpoints has\nrecently become the focus of attention in various subjects. In\ncrystallography, for example, symmetry groups have proved very useful in\ndescribing the internal structure of civstals, and they convey information\nabout global properties. However, as a crystal grows, the molecules or ions\njoining the crystal align themselves according to the configuration of those\nmolecules already belonging to it. The atomic forces which govern the building\nof a crystal are of a local nature. When confronted with the differences\nbetween the rhomb-cub-octahedron and Miller's solid it seems lather fortuitous\nthat the resulting crystal structure has a strong global symmetry. Why should\nlocal ordering rules that are effective over a short range produce; a\nstructure with long range symmetries? Returning to the case of polyhedra, it\nseems clear that the local and global viewpoints are different responses to\nthe same problem. They are both ways of trying to express the same visual\nproperty of the Platonic solids namely, that they look the same from different\ndirections. When you turn a model of a Platonic solid in your hands then\nwhenever you see it face first, the same image is presented to the eye no\nmatter which face is at the front. Similar lv. when viewed edge on, or vertex\nfirst, the picture does not depend orr the edge or vertex that you choose to\nlook at. This aesthetic quality can be expressed by saying that all the faces\nare congruent, that the dihedral arrgles are equal, and that all the vertices\nare similarly surrounded. It can also be expressed by noting that\n\nTransitivity 367 the model has a particularly strong kind of symmetry. The\nidea involved in this second case can be made precise using the notion of\ntransitivity which unites the concepts of regularity and symmetry.\nTransitivity The notion of transitivity makes explicit the intuitive idea that\ncertain objects (such as faces or vertices) are equivalent or\nindistinguishable, that they all look the same no matter which is focused on.\nThe transitivity properties of a polyhedron describe the different directions\nfrom which the polyhedron looks the same. The word 'transitive' has the same\nroot as the words 'transit' and 'transition', commonplace words that convey\nideas of motion, of change of place, of passage from one state to another.\nThis is appropriate because transitivity concerns the possibility of moving\nobjects around. A polyhedron is said to be face-transitive if, for any pair of\nfaces, there is a symmetry of the polyhedron which carries the first face onto\nthe second. Physically, this means that the polyhedron looks the same when\nviewed face on, no matter which face is presented to the eye. Every time the\nmodel is rotated so that it is seen face first, the rotation involved is a\nsymmetry of the polyhedron so the initial and final positions are\nindistinguishable. (Face-transitive polyhedra are sometimes called isohedral.)\nExamples of face-transitive polyhedra include the Platonic solids, and the\ndipyramids and trapezohedra (Figure 8.10(a)-(c)). Another thirteen examples,\nwhich include Kepler's two rhombic polyhedra, are shown in Figure 10.7. They\nare related to the Archimedean solids and were first described by Eugene\nCharles Catalan (1814-1894). Polyhedra which are not face-transitive are easy\nto find since the faces of a face-transitive polyhedron must be all the same\nshape. Therefore the prisms and Archimedean solids cannot be face-transitive.\nThe faces of the Siamese dodecahedron are all congruent equilateral triangles,\nbut it is still not face-transitive. Its symmetry group (£^) contains only six\nsymmetries: the identity, two reflections in perpendicular mirror planes, and\nthree 2-fold rotations (about the principal axis, and each of the two\nsecondary axes). So any one of the 12 faces can be carried to at most five\nother faces by the symmetry operations in this group. Many non-convex\npolyhedra are face-transitive. The four regular star polyhedra are examples.\nThe stellations of the dodecahedron are still face-transitive when we\ninterpret them as spherical polyhedral surfaces each composed of sixty\nisosceles triangles. If the octahedron is augmented by regular tetrahedra then\nwe see that the stella octangula can be interpreted as a spherical surface\ncomposed of 24 equilateral triangles. Other compounds give examples of non-\nconvex face- transitive polyhedra when seen in this naive way. In this light\nthe 'five tetrahedra'\n\n368 Chapter 10 Figure 10.7. The Catalan solids. is composed of sixty non-\nconvex pentagons. Some of the other stellations of the icosahedron provide\nfurther examples of face-transitive polyhedra. General properties of face-\ntransitive polyhedral surfaces have been investigated by Branko Griinbaum and\nGeoffrey Shephard. They found that all such polyhedra must be star-shaped\n(that is, there must be a point in the interior from which it is possible to\nget an unobscured view of the whole surface). The faces of these polyhedra can\nbe triangles, convex quadrilaterals, or star-shaped1 pentagons. Some of\nGriinbaum and Shephard's examples are shown in Figure 10.8. 1 Do not confuse\nstar-shaped polygons and polyhedra with star polygons and star polyhedra in\nthe Kepler-Poinsot sense.\n\nTransitivity 369 Figure 10.7 (continued). A polyhedron is vertex-transitive\n(or isogonal) if any vertex can be carried to any other by a symmetry\noperation. This corresponds to the fact that a polyhedron looks the same when\nviewed with any of its vertices directed forwards. The Archimedean solids are\nall vertex-transitive. However, Miller's solid has symmetry group D±v and\nthese 16 symmetries are insufficient to carry a vertex onto each of the 23\nothers. The Greeks did not express the aesthetic quality they saw sufficiently\nwell to ensure that all the semiregular polyhedra allowed under their\ndefinition looked the same from every vertex. The fact that Archimedes did not\nrecord Miller's solid among his list of semiregular polyhedra may indicate\n\n370 Chapter 10 Figure 10.8. Some face-transitive polyhedra. that he was\nintuitively searching for vertex-transitive solids. However, his list did not\ninclude the prisms either and these are vertex-transitive. Perhaps he, like\nKepler, did not find polyhedra with prismatic symmetry so pleasing on the eye.\nRather surprisingly, there are examples of vertex-transitive polyhedra which\nare not spherical. Unlike the face-transitive polyhedra, they cannot be\ndeformed into a sphere but .have tunnels running through them. These vertex-\ntransitive polyhedra were discovered by Griinbaum and Shephard. Some can be\nobtained from prisms. Figure 10.9(a) shows a polyhedron which has the same\nvertices as the octagonal prism shown in Figure 10.9(b) but which has been\n'twisted' so that each of the eight square faces has become a pair of\ntriangles. Combining the squares of the prism with the sixteen triangles of\nthe 'twisted prism' produces a vertex-transitive polyhedral surface which is\ntopologically a torus.\n\nTransitivity 371 Other examples can be constructed which have higher genus\n(nioie tunnels). Figure 10.9(c) shows a polyhedron which is combinatorially\nequivalent to a snub cube. Its convex hull, shown in Figure 10.9(d), has the\nsame set of vertices and is also equivalent to a snub cube but geometrically\nthe two polyhedra are different. If the square faces are removed from each\npolyhedron and the two remaining pieces glued together, a vertex-transitive\npolyhedron of genus five is produced. Other examples can be constructed which\nhave genera 3, 7, 11 and 19. A polyhedron is edge-transitive (or isotoxal) if\nany edge can be carried to any other by a symmetry operation. This corresponds\nto the fact that the polyhedron looks the same when viewed edge on, from any\nedge. Edgo-transitivitv differs from the two previous kinds of transitivity in\nthat it cannot occur alorre. Every edge-transitive polyhedron has to be either\nface-transitivo or vertex-transitive (possibly both). For example, the rhombic\ndodecahedron is edge-transitive and face-transitive. Examples of polyhedra\nwhich are both face-transitive and vcr tex- transitive but not edge-transitive\nare the irregular tetrahcdra known as sphenoids (see Figure 10.10). These have\nisosceles or scalene triangles for faces. The eom- (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure\n10.9. Constructions of two aspherical, vertex-transitive polyhedra.\n\n372 Chapter 10 Figure 10.10. Isosceles and scalene sphenoids. plete\nicosahedron (Plate 10) provides another example if its faces are interpreted\nas irregular star 9-gons which pass through each other. The three basic\nelements of a polyhedral surface used to define transitivity properties can be\ncombined to produce even stricter kinds of transitivity requirements. Cauchy\nobserved that, in a Platonic solid, any face can be rotated to the place of\nany other and, following that, any side of that face can be rotated to the\nposition of any other of its sides. This can be thought of as transitivity of\n(face-edge) pairs. Cauchy used this property to characterise regularity in his\nenumeration of regular star polyhedra. Bertrand, on the other hand, used\ntransitivity of (vertex-edge) pairs in his proof of the same result. In fact,\nrestating their theorems in these terms shows that the two theorems are not\nequivalent. Cauchy enumerated polyhedra which are (face-edge)-transitive, and\nBertrand enumerated polyhedra which are (vertex-edge)-transitive. It happens\nthat the two sets of polyhedra are the same, and correspond to the polyhedra\ndiscovered by Poinsot. But the two men interpreted 'regular' in different\nways, so the two theorems are not actually proving the same result.\nCrystallography is another area where large groups of symmetries are used to\ngenerate transitive sets of points. Bravais' investigation of space lattices\nwas effectively a study of this kind. We must remember, however, that all\nthese mathematicians applied transitivity arguments intuitively. The\ntechnology of symmetry groups was not far enough developed for them to use it\nexplicitly. Another kind of transitivity often used in connection with\nregularity is called flag-transitivity. A flag is a (face-edge-vertex) triple\nin which the edge is a side of the face, and the vertex is an end of the\nchosen edge. A polyhedron is flag- transitive if any one of these flag triples\ncan be carried onto any other flag by a symmetry operation. This is a very\nstrong requirement and, in fact, if only rotational symmetries are allowed no\npolyhedron is flag-transitive. If indirect symmetries are included then ten\npolyhedra are flag-transitive: the five Platonic solids, the four Kepler-\nPoinsot star polyhedra, and the stella octangula.\n\nPolyhedral metamorphosis 373 Polyhedral metamorphosis Transitivity properties\nare particularly nice features of polyhedra. They make descriptions very easy\nto state. Instead of describing the positions of all the parts, we can give\nthe position of just one of them and the rules for repeating it. A vertex-\ntransitive convex polyhedron can be completely specified with just two pieces\nof information: the coordinates of one vertex and the symmetry group of the\npolyhedron. A cub-octahedron, for example, might be given by the pair ((1,1,\n0), Oh ). Of course, the amount of information required has not been reduced:\nwe still need to know three real numbers to position each vortex. The\ndifference is in how the information is presented. A lot of information is\nencoded into the symbol for the symmetry group and this is what makes the\ndescription so concise. The repetition rules of the symmetry group describe\nhow the set of vertices is related to the given point and, because we are\nassuming that the polyhedron is convex, the faces can then be filled in in a\nunique way. This notation for describing particular polyhedra can also be used\nin teverse. The given information consists of a point in space and a symmetry\ngroup and these data can be used to generate a polyhedron: apply the\nsymmetries to the given point to produce a set of vertices and form their\nconvex hull to make a polyhedron. Which polyhedra can be created in this way?\nThe seed point and the group can both be changed—the point can move\ncontinuously in space and there are several symmetry groups to choose from.\nHow do these parameters affect the resulting polyhedron? For the moment we\nshall restrict our attention to one symmetry group and investigate what\neffects the choice of seed point has. We shall concentrate on the group Oh- If\nthe seed point is moved along a line that passes through the centre of\nsymmetry then all that changes is the size of the polyhedron. Since changes of\nscale are not very interesting we can ignore how far away the seed point is\nfrom the centre of symmetry and just record its direction. This can be\nachieved by restricting the seed point to lie on a sphere centred at the\ncentre of symmetry. Choosing different points on this sphere should give rise\nto different polyhedra. The mirror planes of the Oh symmetry system intersect\nthe sphere in great circles. They divide up the sphere into a network of 48\nspherical triangles (shown in Figure 10.11) and these act as a reference grid\nto indicate where the symmetry elements are situated. Where two great circles\nintersect, a 2-fold rotation axis pierces the sphere. Similarly, the 3-fold\nand 4-fold axes occur where three or four great circles meet. If the seed\npoint is chosen to lie on an axis then the polyhedron which results is either\nan octahedron (4-fold axis), a cube (3-fold axis) or a cub-octahedron (2-fold\naxis). When the seed point lies inside a triangle we get a polyhedron which\nhas 48 vertices—there will be one vertex in each triangle. For one special\npoint inside\n\n374 Chapter 10 Figure 10.11. each triangle, the generated polyhedron will have\nregular faces: it will bo the great rhomb-cub-octahedron, an Archimedean\nsolid. All the other polyhedra generated from points inside the triangle will\nbe like the great rhomb-cub-oetahodron in many respects (some examples are\nshown in the centre of Figure 10.12). They are all made up of six octagons,\neight hexagons, and twelve rectangles, and every vertex is surrounded by one\nof each of the three kinds of face. The shapes of the faces change as the seed\npoint is varied but the way that they are put together is preserved. All the\npolyhedra have the same combinatorial structuio. Such polyhedra are said to be\nisomorphic.2 This word is derived from the Greek for 'same form' and is used\nin many areas of mathematics when objects have a common structure. There are\nother points on the parameter sphere which have not been investigated yet.\nThese are the points that lie on exactly one great circle. The points on any\none of the sides of a spherical triangle generate a family of polvhedra which\nare all isomorphic. The points on a line connecting a 2-fold axis to a 3-fold\naxis are isomorphic to a truncated cube, the points on a line connecting a\n2-fold axis to a 4-fold axis are isomorphic to a truncated octahedron, and the\npoints on a line connecting a 3-fold axis to a 4-fold axis are isomorphic to a\nrhomb-cub- octahedron. One point on each line generates a regular-faced\nArchimedean solid. Examples from these isomorphism classes are illustrated\naround the edge of Figure 10.12. The diagram is a schematic map of one of the\nspherical triangles. The polyhedra illustrated show what kinds of polyhedron\nare generated by choosing a seed point in various regions. Studying the\ndifferences in these figures and their relative positions gives a good idea of\nhow the polyhedron varies with the choice of seed point. A better way to get a\nfeel for the variety of polyhedra and their interrelationships is to use a\ncomputer (if your machine and programming skills cope with the 2Note that some\nauthors describe polyhedra which have the same net as isomorphic In this book,\nsuch polyhedra are called stereo-isomers.\n\nPolyhedral metamorphosis 375 challenge). Interactive graphics provide an\nexcellent tool for understanding these changes in a very direct way. Using a\nmouse to drag the seed point about, inside a triangular region, you can watch\nas the polyhedron changes shape in response. You actually experience the\nmetamorphosis of polyhedral forms. What happens if we change the symmetry\ngroup? If we replace 0\\, bv the group containing only the rotations of a cube,\nO, then many of the polyhedra that appear are the same as those generated by\nthe Oh group. The point on the 3-fold axis still produces a cube, for example.\nIn fact, all the points which lie on one or more of the great circles produce\na polyhedron with mirror symmetry. The only differences between the O and Oh\ngroups occur in the interiors of the spherical triangles. Instead of\ngenerating isomorphs of the great rhomb-cub-octahedron, isomorphs of the snub\ncube appear. Some examples are illustrated in Figure 10.13. There are two\nenantiomorphic forms of the snub cube. Which one is produced depends on where\nthe seed point is located. Half of the triangles give one form, and the rest\ngive its mirror image. It is apparent from these examples that the spherical\ntriangles in the parameter space are more than just a convenient reference\nsystem. Knowing how the polyhedra are related to the seed points in any one of\nthese triangles is sufficient to understand the whole behaviour. Each triangle\nis called a fundamental region for the group Oh', each triangle can be carried\nto any other by a symmetry in the group, and together they cover the whole\nsphere. All the triangles are equivalent because they are all in the same\ntransitivity class. For the group O there are two transitivity classes of\ntriangles which are mirror images of each other. Taking one triangle from each\nclass produces a fundamental region for O. The analysis of the symmetry groups\nIh and I is analogous that for ()/, and O. Schematic diagrams showing the\nrelative positions of the various polyhedra would exhibit the same general\nfeatures. The three tetrahedral groups are more interesting. Figures\n10.14-10.16 are schematic diagrams showing the kinds of polyhedron which are\ngenerated by seed points in a spherical triangle using the symmetry groups T,\nTd and Th. Notice the appearance of the Platonic icosahe- dron. It lies on the\ngreat circle connecting the cub-octahedron to the octahedron in Figures 10.14\nand 10.16. The squares of the cub-octahedron are folded along a diagonal to\nproduce a polyhedron isomorphic to the icosahedron but which has obtuse-angled\nisosceles triangles for some of its faces. As the seed point progresses\ntowards the 4-fold axis these triangles become acute-angled and finally vanish\nto become an edge of the octahedron. Somewhere along this route, all the\ntriangles are equiangular and the icosahedron is regular. The spherical\ntriangles in these figures are still the fundamental triangles shown in Figure\n10.11. It is sufficient to study just one of these even though all the\ntetrahedral groups have fundamental regions which are larger than this. The\nfundamental regions for the groups Td and Th are formed from two of the\ntriangles.\n\n376 Chapter 10 Seed points in the two triangles produce mirror-image polyhedra\nbut because these polyhedra are not cheiral we cannot tell them apart. The\nrotation group T does produce cheiral polyhedra—what we might call 'snub\ntetrahedia'. Its fundamental region is made up of four triangles but again, if\nwe ignore cheirality, it is sufficient to consider only one of them. The space\nof vertex-transitive convex polyhedra A mathematician who asks \"what space you\nare working in?\" is not lcfciiing to the size of your officeb Ian Stewart\nTraditionally, space is where the objects of geometry live and have extension.\nThe structural properties of this Euclidean space are set out at the beginning\nof the Elements. For the modern mathematician, the word 'space' is not limited\nto the conventional notions of a three-dimensional space of points. It is used\nto refer to the collection of objects being considered, and the structure of\nthe space reflects the relationships between these objects. In the previous\nsection, polyhedra were generated by choosing a seed vertex from a spherical\ntriangle. The point chosen is a variable parameter and the triangle is the\ncollection of all the possible values it can take. The triangle is an example\nof a parameter space. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the points\nin a triangle and the convex vertex-transitive polyhedra with a particular\nsymmetry group. We can also interpret the triangle as a space of polyhedra:\neach 'point' (or element) in the space is a polyhedron. Furthermore, the\nstructure of the space has a useful interpretation: polyhedra which are almost\nthe same are very close together in this space. The distance between two\npoints of the space (that is, two polyhedra) gives a measure of how different\nthey are. The idea of a space of polyhedra can be made very precise. Using a\nparameter- space as an example of how such a space can be constructed is\nsomewhat misleading but it does give the flavour of what is involved. We want\na space of polyhedra to have a structure which reflects the relationships\nbetween polyhedra. We can give a qualitative description of such a space which\nexhibits its primary features. This is rather like a map of an underground\nrail network. In this case, the important points which need to be recorded are\nthings like the order of the stations along each track and the crossover\nstations where you can change lines. The actual physical layout of the tracks\nthrough the city is irrelevant to the passengers. All that they need to know\nis that nearby points on the map conespond to nearby points in the city. How\ncan we make a schematic map of the space of polyhedra? To simplify the problem\ngreatly, we shall restrict our attention to convex\n\nThe space of vertex-transitive convex polyhedra 377 Figure 10.12. Polyhedra in\nthe parameter space of the group Oh-\n\n378 Chapter 10 Figure 10.13.

Polyhedra in\nthe parameter space of the group TV\n\n382 Chapter 10 Figure 10.17. These polyhedra are 'close' in the Hausdorff\nmetric. polyhedra. The combinatorial properties of polyhedra do not depend on\nscale so we shall regard polyhedra which are similar (in the geometric sense)\nas being the same. In our map, size is not important. In order to know which\npolyhedra should be placed close together on the map we need a measure of\ndistance on the space of (similarity classes of) polyhedra. We think of two\npolyhedra as being 'almost the same' if the vertices of one are close to the\nvertices of the other, and vice versa. This idea can be made explicit using\nwhat is called the Hausdorff distance between two sets. In this sense the two\npolyhedra shown in Figure 10.17 are close together: each vertex of the wedge\nis close to a vertex of the other polyhedron. Notice that the polyhedra are\nnot isomorphic. In fact, objects classed as close by the Hausdorff metric need\nnot even have the same dimension. A very shallow square prism and a square\npolygon are 'nearby' in this sense. To make it possible to draw pictures of\nthe resulting map, we shall narrow down the field of interest even further and\nfocus attention on vertex-transitive polyhedra which have a spherical symmetry\ngroup. In this special case, there is some nice structure of the space of\npolyhedra which can be indicated on the map. In particular, it is possible to\ndivide up the map into regions of polyhedra with similar features. We shall\nconcentrate on two properties: the symmetry group and the number of vertices.\nThe desired map can be constructed by gluing together the triangles described\nin the previous section. The examples of polyhedra drawn in each triangle and\ntheir relative positions illustrate the kinds of polyhedra which are 'nearby'\nin the technical sense of our space of polyhedra and which must therefore be\nclose together on the map. Furthermore, we can observe that the same polyhedra\nappear in more than one triangle. For example, the triangles for the groups\n0/,, and O have the same sequence of polyhedra along their boundaries but\ndiffer in their interiors. We can glue these two triangles together to form\n(topologically speaking) a sphere as shown in Figure 10.18. Around the equator\nthere are three points, called nodes, which correspond to the cube, the\noctahedron and the cub- octahedron. These have 8, 6 and 12 vertices\nrespectively. All the other polyhedra on the equator have 24 vertices but they\nare not all the same. Some are isomorphic to the truncated cube or the\ntruncated octahedron, others to the rhomb-cub-\n\nThe space of vertex-transitive convex polyhedra 383 truncated octahedron^.\noctahedron great rhomb-cub-octahedron cub-octahedron *. -———___^. rhom b-cu\nb-octahedron snub cube truncated —~-~^cube cube Figure 10.18.

The three nodes divide the equator into three line\nsegments—one line corresponds to each isomorphism class. In the upper\nhemisphere are polyliedra with 48 vertices and Oh symmetry; in the lower\nhemisphere are polyhedra with 24 vertices and symmetry group O. A similar\nanalysis of the polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry can be used to construct\nanother sphere for the groups Ih and I. Such a sphere is shown in the upper-\nright part of Figure 10.20. The numbers on the nodes, lines and faces match\nthe polyhedra listed in the Table 10.21. The triangles containing the\npolyhedra with one of the tetrahedral symmetry groups contain examples from\nboth the octahedral and icosahedral spheres. In fact, the three triangles in\nFigures 10.14-10.16 can be joined into a large region whose boundary is the\nsame as the equator of the sphere of octahedral symmetries (see Figure 10.19).\nThis region also contains a point corresponding to the regular icosahedron. So\nwe must wrap this region around the equator of the octahedral sphere and\nattach it to the icosahedral sphere at a single point. This completes our map\nof the space of vertex-transitive convex polyhedra whose symmetry group is one\nof the seven spherical groups. The map is shown in Figure 10.20. The upper\nhemisphere of the octahedral sphere which contains polyhedra with Oh symmetry\n(coloured grey in the figure) has been flattened so that the tetrahedral part\nof the map can be attached to its equator. The points, line segments, and\nregions of the map delineate its structure. They mark places where there is a\ndiscontinuity in the space—either a jump in the number of vertices or a switch\nof symmetry group. This division of the space\n\n384 Chapter 10 of polyhedra produces 24 types. These are indicated by the\nnumbers on the diagram and the data about each type are displayed in Table\n10.21. The number of vertices and symmetry group are listed in the first two\ncolumns but these alone are not enough to distinguish between the types. The\nstructure of the space is richer than that. All the polyhedra in each class\nare isomorphic to each other and to one of the Platonic or Archimedean solids.\nThe last column contains the name of that solid, and the third column contains\na tick if the regular-faced one is actually a member of the class. The first\nseven polyhedra in the table lie at the nodes of the map. These points\ncorrespond to the five Platonic solids together with the cub-octahedron and\nthe icosi-dodecahedron. The next ten rows of the table deal with the line\nsegments in the map. Seven of these lines contain an Archimedean solid. The\nother three classes are not covered by the classical discussions because none\nof the polyhedra on these lines is regular-faced. Notice the icosahedra with\nisosceles triangular faces are separated into two kinds in the space of\npolyhedra. Those with 'fat' triangles (row 10) and those with 'thin' triangles\n(row 11). The apex angle in a fat isosceles triangle is larger than 60°, in a\nthin triangle it is less than 60°. In this context the special angle is not\nthe right angle which gives rise to the acute/obtuse classification of\ntriangles in Euclid's Elements but the angle in an equiangular triangle. The\nlast seven rows of the table contain the polyhedra in the regions of the map.\nFour of the regions contain a familiar Archimedean solid, the others contain\nmore examples of polyhedra unknown in ancient times. Notice how the\nicosahedron plays a crucial role in making the space connected. Because it is\npossible to connect any two points in the map by a line, it is possible Figure\n10.19. A map of the space of convex, vertex-transitive polyhedra with\ntetrahedral symmetry groups (T, and 7^ and T^).\n\nTotally transitive polyhedra 385 Figure 10.20. A map of the space of convex,\nvertex-transitive polyhedra with a spherical symmetry group. to continuously\ndeform any one of these polyhedra to any of the others in such a way that all\nthe polyhedra it passes through are also convex and vertex-transitive. A more\ndetailed and rigorous study of this space was carried out by Stewart\nRobertson, Sheila Carter and Hugh Morton in 1970. They also analysed the\nprismatic groups. This is more awkward to describe since there are infinitely\nmany prismatic groups. However, the map of the spherical groups is connected\nto the prismatic part of the map through the tetrahedron, the octahedron, and\nthe cube. Totally transitive polyhedra We now return to the problem of finding\ncompound polyhedra which are regular. The definition of a regular polyhedron\ncan be recast using transitivity. The conditions of equal faces, equal\ndihedral angles, and congruent solid angles correspond to face-, edge-, and\nvertex-transitivity. A polyhedron that is face-transitive, edge- transitive\nand vertex-transitive is said to be totally transitive. The totally transitive\npolyhedra include the Platonic solids and the four Kepler-Poinsot star\npolyhedra—the polyhedra we call regular. The advantage of the transitivity\ninterpretation of regularity is that it applies to compounds. The transitivity\nproperties of the examples of compounds described above are listed in Table\n10.22. Five of them are totally transitive.

The compounds of five and ten\ntetrahedra, of five cubes, and of five octahedra were first described by\nEdmund Hess in 1876.

The compound of\nfour tetrahedra has no transitivity properties at all. The remainder of this\nsection will be spent proving that all the totally transitive polyhedra have\nbeen found. To do this correctly we need to state the kind of polyhedra we are\ninterested in. Only when this is done can we begin to look among them for\nthose that are totally transitive. Since the primary motivation Figure 10.23.\nA compound of two sphenoids.\n\n388 Chapter 10 for introducing transitivity was to study compounds, we shall\nallow the polyhedra to have self-intersections where faces pass through each\nother. The faces are to be planar polygons whose sides may pass through each\nother. Thus our objects of study include the star polyhedra described in\nChapter 7 together with compounds of such polyhedra. With this understanding,\nthe only possibilities are the five Platonic solids, the four Kepler-Poinsot\nstar polyhedra, and the five compounds listed above. Lemma. The faces of a\npolyhedron that is edge- and vertex-transitive are regular polygons. PROOF: As\nthe polyhedron is vertex-transitive, all of its vertices lie on a sphere. A\nface of the polyhedron can be thought of as the base of a pyramid whose apex\nis the centre of this sphere (see Figure 10.24). All the sides of the base of\nthe pyramid are the same length because the polyhedron is edge-transitive. So,\nthe other faces of the pyramid are all congruent isosceles triangles. This\nforces the pyramid to be a right pyramid on a regular polygon base. ■ Figure\n10.24. A simple corollary of this lemma is that the convex totally transitive\npolyhedra are precisely the Platonic solids. Edge- and vertex-transitivity\nimply that the faces are regular polygons, face-transitivity means that the\nfaces are all equal, and vertex-transitivity implies that all the vertices lie\non a sphere and are similarly surrounded. Thus we have recovered the ancient\ndefinition. To enumerate the other totally transitive polyhedra we shall use\nsome group theory, in particular, the notion of a stabiliser. This is a sort\nof localised symmetry group. The stabiliser of a particular face of a\npolyhedron is the set of symmetries of the polyhedron which carry the face to\nitself. These symmetries leave the face unchanged or 'stabilise' it. The\nstabiliser of a face is always a subgroup of the\n\nTotally transitive polyhedra 389 symmetry group of the polyhedron and it\nalways contains at least one symmetry: the identity. Stabilisers of edges and\nvertices can be defined in the same way. Theorem. There are fourteen totally\ntransitive polyhedra: the five Platonic solids, the four Kepler-Poinsot star\npolyhedra, and five compound polyhedra. Proof: The preceding lemma showed that\nthe faces of a totally transitive polyhedron must be regular polygons. Face-\ntransitivity forces all the faces to be congruent. The proof of the theorem\nproceeds in several steps and combines ideas from both Cauchy's and Bertrand's\nenumerations of the star polyhedra. The first step is to show that (at least)\none of the following holds: (i) there is a rotation which carries a face onto\nitself, or (ii) there is a rotation which carries a vertex onto itself. In the\nfirst case, we can show that the face-planes of the polyhedron bound one of\nseven possible convex kernels. Searching their stellation patterns for regular\npolygons produces candidates for totally transitive polyhedra. This is\nCauchy's method. Case (ii) corresponds to Bertrand's method: totally\ntransitive polyhedra can be produced by facetting any of seven convex solids.\nStep 1. The stabiliser of a face contains a rotation. Since the polyhedron is\nface-transitive, the stabilisers of the faces are all the same size. (In fact,\nthe subgroups are all conjugate.) Similarly, all the stabilisers of the edges\nare the same size. Let <f> be the number of symmetries in the stabiliser of\nsome face, and let r\\ be the number of symmetries in the stabiliser of an\nedge. If we can show that <f> is at least three then the stabiliser of a face\nmust contain rotations which carry the face onto itself and therefore an axis\nof rotation must pass through the face. We now apply the Orbit-Stabiliser\ntheorem. This implies that the number of faces multiplied by the number of\nsymmetries which stabilise a face equals the number of symmetries of the\npolyhedron. Similarly for the edges. If we write F and E for the numbers of\nfaces and edges of the polyhedron then the number of symmetries of the\npolyhedron = F • <f> and also the number of symmetries of the polyhedron = E ■\nr\\\\. Equating these two things and rearranging gives 77 _ F lj> ~ E'\n\n390 Chapter 10 The ratio of faces to edges is easy to calculate. All the faces\nare iegular n- sided polygons, for some n ^ 3, and two sides are brought\ntogether to form each edge. So nF = 2E. This implies that 1 - - - 2 0 ~~ E ~ n\n_ 2 2 2 2 3' 4' 5' 6 When these fractions are in their lowest terms, all\nexcept one have a denominator bigger than two. Hence (j) must be at least\nthree in every case except when the faces are squares. We shall see later that\nif the polyhedron had square faces and the stabiliser of a face did not\ncontain a rotation then case (ii) would hold: its vertices would lie on\nrotation axes. Step 2. Every vertex lies on a rotation axis. Since the\npolyhedron is vertex-transitive, the stabilisers of the vertices all contain\nthe same number of symmetries. Let ip be the number of symmetries in the\nstabiliser of a vertex. As in the case of faces, if we can show that -</' is\nat l^ast three then the stabiliser must contain rotations which carry the\nvertex onto itself and therefore the vertex must lie on the axis of one of\nthese rotations. Writing V for the number of vertices of the polyhedron and\napplying the Orbit Stabiliser theorem again we see that the number of\nsymmetries of the polyhedron = V ■ ■(/>. As before, equating this statement\nwith the analogous one about edges, we deduce that 1 - X. i> ~ e' All the\nvertices have the same valency (because the polyhedron is voitex- transitive).\nAssume that rn edges meet at each vertex. Then mV = 'IE. This implies 77 _ V _\n2_ 0 Em 2 2 2 2 3' 4' 5' 6 When these fractions are in their lowest terms all\nexcept one have a denominator bigger than two. Hence </; must be at least\nthree in every case except when the vertices are 4-valent. There are two\nsituations that are problematic. Step 1 did not deal with the case of square\nfaces and step 2 has not dealt with 4-valent vertices. Howevei, it is\n\nTotally transitive polyhedra 391 impossible to construct a polyhedron which\nhas square faces and 4-valent vei tices so both situations cannot occur\ntogether. Therefore, at least one of statements (i) and (ii) above is true.\nStep 3. There are seven possible kernels for stellating. Suppose a rotation\naxis passes through every face. A symmetry which carries one face onto another\nmust also carry one axis onto another. So, as the polyhedron is face-\ntransitive, the axes piercing the faces must be of the same kind. That is,\nthey must all be 2-fold, all be 3-fold, all be 4-fold, or all be 5-fold. The\nconvex polyhedra which satisfy these properties are the upper seven shown in\nFigure 10.25. They are the five Platonic solids together with the rhombic\ndodecahedron and the rhombic triacontahedron. The systems of rotational\nsymmetry in which all the axes of a given kind lie in a plane cannot occur.\nThe remaining possibilities are D2, T, O and I. Step 4. There are seven\npossible shells for facetting. A symmetry which carries one vertex onto\nanother must also carry one axis onto another. If the polyhedron is vertex-\ntransitive, its vertices must all lie on axes of the same kind. The convex\npolyhedra which satisfy these properties are the five Platonic solids, the\ncub-octahedron, and the icosi-dodecahedron. Thev aie the lower seven figures\nin Figure 10.25. Step 5. The enumeration. Of the nine convex polyhedra shown\nin Figure 10.25, only the Platonic solids are totally transitive. The other\nfour are sometimes called quasiregular. The rhombic solids are not vertex-\ntransitive, and the Archimedean solids are not face- transitive. Notice that\nthey are all edge-transitive. We have shown that the faces of a totally\ntransitive polyhedron must lie in the face-planes of one of the first seven\nsolids, or can be found by facetting one of the last seven solids. So to find\nthe possibilities we can scan stellation patterns looking for tegular\npolygons. This was done for the Platonic solids in Chapter 7. The stellation\npatterns for the two rhombic solids are shown in Figure 10.26. The rhombic\ndodecahedron does not have any totally transitive stellations. The square in\nthe stellation pattern of the rhombic triacontahedron gives rise to the\ncompound of five cubes. The other method of generating totally transitive\npolyhedra is to facet one of seven solids. The Platonic solids were covered in\nChapter 7. The cub-octahedron cannot be facetted: the only regular polygons it\ncontains are equatorial hexagons and triangles. Besides equatorial 10-gons and\npentagons, the icosi-dodecuhedron contains triangles. Eight of these close up\nto form an octahedron (Figure 10.27), and inscribing all the triangles\nproduces the compound of five octahedra. All the\n\n392 Chapter 10 Figure 10.25. totally transitive polyhedra must be generated by\nat least one of these methods. Curiously, they all appear on both lists. The\ntotally transitive polyhedra are listed in Table 10.28. The kernels of\nstellated forms are listed in the second column; the shells of the facetted\nforms are given in column three. ■ One last comment on this proof. Recall from\nChapter 7 Poinsot's confusion over when a set of points is regularly\ndistributed on a sphere. He thought that the vertices of the Platonic solids\nand also the midpoints of their edges should be\n\nTotally transitive polyhedra 393 Figure 10.26. Stellation patterns for two\nrhombic polyhedra. examples of such sets. We can now see that these are the\nplaces where the lotation axes of the polyhedra puncture the sphere. Only the\n3-fold, 4-fold and 5-fold axes can be derived from the vertices. The 2-fold\naxes come from the midpoints of the edges or alternatively from the vertices\nof two of the quasiregular solids.\n\n394 Chapter 10 Figure 10.27. Symmetrical colourings Compound polyhedra are\noften painted in a way which displays their composite nature very clearly. The\ncomponents are painted in a different colours, and each component is\nmonochromatic. (The compounds illustrated in Plates 11 1G are coloured in this\nway.) When the uncoloured compound has a high degree of symmetry, one would\nexpect that such a systematic method of colouring would produce a highly\nordered and symmetrical colouring. In Chapter 8 we studied the symmetry of an\nobject by finding different positions from which the polyhedron appeared the\nsame. Describing how these indistinguishable positions are related to each\nother gave us a symmetry group. A similar technique can be applied to study\nthe coloured compounds. This time we want the polyhedra to be\nindistinguishable as coloured objects—the symme- Polyhedron tetrahedron cube\noctahedron dodecahedron icosahedron small stellated dodecahedron great\ndodecahedron great stellated dodecahedron great icosahedron compound of two\ntetrahedra compound of five tetrahedra compound of ten tetrahedra compound of\nfive cubes compound of five octahedra Kernel dodecahedron dodecahedron\ndodecahedron icosahedron octahedron icosahedron icosahedron rhombic\ntriacontahedron icosahedron Shell icosahedron icosahedron dodecahedron\nicosahedron cube dodecahedron dodecahedron dodecahedron icosi-dodecahedron\nTable 10.28. The totally transitive polyhedra.\n\nSymmetrical colourings 395 tries must preserve the pattern of colours. Such\nsymmetries are called colour- preserving symmetries, and together they form a\nstructure called the colour- preserving group. It is important to\ndifferentiate between the symmetry group of a coloured object and the symmetry\ngroup of the underlying uncoloured polyhedron. For example, the compound of\nthree cubes shown in Plate 14 has colour-preserving group D2 but has\noctahedral symmetry as an uncoloured object. The number of rotational\nsymmetries has been reduced from 24 to 4. The colour-preserving groups of the\ncoloured compounds of five tetrahedra (Plate 12), of five cubes (Plate 13),\nand of four cubes (Plate 15) are all trivial: the only colour-preserving\nsymmetry for these coloured polyhedra is the identity! The following examples\nshow other ways in which the colour-preserving group can differ from the\noidinary geometric symmetry group. Example 1. The simplest polyhedron, the\nregular tetrahedron, can be coloured with four colours, one per face. Only one\nof the twelve rotational symmetries of the tetrahedron, the identity,\npreserves the arrangement of the colours. So the colour-preserving group is\nthe trivial group, C[. The identity is always a colour- preserving symmetry.\nExample 2. At the other extreme, every symmetry of the uncoloured polyhedron\ncan also be a colour-preserving symmetry. For example, if a low, rhombus-based\npyramid is added to every face of a rhombic triacontahedron then a polyhedron\nwith 120 faces is obtained (see Figure 10.29). It can be properly coloured\nwith two colours. In this case, the group of colour-preserving symmetries is\nthe whole icosahedral group, I, the same as the group of the underlying\npolyhedron. Figure 10.29. An augmented rhombic triacontahedron.\n\n396 Chapter 10 Example 3. The octahedron is another polyhedron which can be\nproperly coloured with two colours. Here, the group of colour-preserving\nsymmetries is the tetrahedral group. This can be seen by extending all the\nfaces of either colour until they meet forming a tetrahedron. This shows that\nthe tetrahedral group is a subgroup of the octahedral group. This relationship\nis often written as T < O. Example 4. A cube can be coloured with three\ncolours so that opposite faces have the same colour. The colour-preserving\nsymmetries are the 2-fold rotations about axes joining opposite face centres,\nso the colour-preserving group is D2- A pyritohedron is a dodecahedron with\nirregular pentagons for faces (Figure 10.30). Its symmetry group is the\ntetrahedral group. It can be coloured so that from a distance, it looks\nsimilar to the colouring of the cube described above: three colours are used\nand the faces of each colour fall into two pairs of adjacent faces on opposite\nsides of the polyhedron. The colour-preserving group is again D2. These two\nexamples show that D2 < O and also D2 <T. Figure 10.30. Example 5. A pyramid\nwith a regular hexagon base can be coloured with two colours so that the\ncolours alternate round the sloping sides, and either colour occurs on the\nbase. The colour-preserving group is C3 and the symmetry group of the\nuncoloured pyramid is Cq. Similar colourings of pyramids can be devised to\nshow that Cn < Cnp, where p is any integer. Problem. A hexagonal dipyramid has\nsymmetry group D6. Find three colourings of this polyhedron which have the\nfollowing colour-preserving groups: C3, C6, and D3. These examples illustrate\nthat groups of colour-preserving symmetries are often much smaller than the\ngeometric symmetry groups, even when the colours\n\nColour symmetries 397 are distributed in a regular and systematic pattern.\nClearly, the colour-preserving group does not capture our intuitive idea of\nwhat a symmetrical colouiing is like. The problem stems from the definition of\nwhat we mean by a symmetrical colouring. The definition uses geometrical\nsymmetries such as rotations to try to describe a non-geometric situation.\nGeometrical symmetries arc1 good at describing the symmetrical nature of\nshape, but they are not sufficient to describe the symmetry of a pattern\nformed by an arrangement of colours. The pioblem, then, lies not in the desire\nto use groups of symmetries to describe1 tho degree and structure of the\nsymmetry of an arrangement of colours, but in the use of geometric symmetry\noperations. The concept of a symmetry needs to be onhuged to include non-\ngeometric operations. Colour symmetries In general, an operation is described\nas a symmetry of a system if no change can be detected in the system after the\noperation has been peifoimed The rotations which carry a polyhedron onto\nitself are symmetries under this definition since they carry the polyhedron to\na position indistinguishable from its original position. They are geometric\nsymmetries of a geometric object. Examples of non-geometric symmetries appear\nin physics. When measuring certain quantities in physical systems, the choice\nof the zero-level on the gauge or scale is not important. The origin can be\nplaced anywhere and the scale1 can be translated. A physical system which is\ninvariant under a translation of a measuring scale is said to have a gauge\nsymmetry. An example is the scale of voltages. The choice of where to place\nzero volts on the scale does not matter since only differences in voltage\nlevels can be measured. The equations of electrical systems deal with voltage\ndifferences and they have a gauge symmetry. This kind of non-geometric\nsymmetry has far-reaching consequences: in the case of voltage, it leads to\nthe law of conservation of electric charge. In order to improve our\nmathematical description of the symmetrical nature of a coloured object or\npattern, we need a better understanding of the wav in which the eye-brain\nsystem interprets coloured images. This will lead to anothei kind of non-\ngeometric symmetry called a colour symmetry. When faced with a coloured scene,\none of the things the mind does is to study each colour separately against the\nbackground formed by the1 others. This gives an impression of the distribution\nof each colour within the scene. Attention can be switched from colour to\ncolour quite rapidly. Painters make use of this response to link areas of a\npicture together: areas of the same coloui become associated in the mind. In\nview of this, it seems reasonable to assume that when the brain is processing\nthe image formed by looking at a coloured polyhedron, the following properties\nof the colouring play a role in determining the biain's\n\n398 Chapter 10 assessment of the degree of structure in the pattern formed by\nthe colours: (i) the structure of the monochromatic patterns formed by each\ncolour taken individually, (ii) the variety of these structures and their\ninterrelationships, (Hi) the positions of the colours in relation to one\nanother. To some extent, the first of these properties is described\nmathematically by the colour-preserving symmetries. A colour-preserving\nsymmetry carries each face to one of like colour so it is also a symmetry of\neach of the monochromatic patterns. However, the set of colour-preserving\nsymmetries may not be the whole set of symmetries which preserve a pattern of\na particular colour. For example, if a cube is properly coloured with three\ncolours so that opposite faces have the same colour then the group of colour-\npreserving symmetries is D2 comprising the 2-fold rotations about each of the\nthree axes joining opposite face centres. The symmetries which preserve the\nfaces of a given colour, red (say), also include 4-fold rotations so the red-\npreserving group is D4. The second property concerns the variety and\ninterrelationships of these single-colour structures. In the coloured models\nwhich we intuitively regard as highly ordered or symmetrical (such as the\ncompounds), all of the monochromatic structures are the same. After the eye\nhas picked out one component (being all of one colour) it then moves on to\nanother colour and identifies another copy of the same thing. Whilst scanning\nthe patterns formed by each colour individually, the structure abstracted from\nthe pattern does not change. This may be why the brain interprets these\ncolourings as having a high degree of symmetry. If this property can be\ndescribed mathematically, it may capture the intuitive idea of what we regard\nas a symmetrical colouring. The fact that there is something here which is the\nsame in different situations suggests that a symmetry could be used to\ndescribe it. (Recall that, when used in a technical sense, a symmetry is an\noperation which cannot be detected or which leaves something unchanged.) When\nobserving a coloured compound, the structure of the pattern formed by any one\ncolour does not depend on the colour you choose to look at. Even though your\nattention shifts from one colour to another, from the point of view of their\nstructure, the patterns are indistinguishable since all the components are the\nsame. A symmetry operation can be defined which models this consistency of\nstructure to some degree. It is analogous to the way that the structure in the\nindividual monochromatic patterns is partially modelled by the colour-\npreserving symmetries of a polyhedron. Like the colour-preserving symmetries,\nit is related to the geometric symmetries of the (uncoloured) polyhedron, and\na restriction is placed on the way in which it can affect the colouring: the\ncolours can be reallocated but the overall pattern must not change. For\nexample, a rotation of a polyhedron\n\nColour symmetries 399 may result in every red face being carried onto a green\nface, every green face to a blue face, and every blue face to a red face. This\nrearrangement of the colour scheme is called a permutation of the colours.\nThis particular permutation can be written (red —» green , green —» blue, blue\n—» red). The rotation is said to have induced the permutation of the colours.\nClearly, for this to happen, the structure of the monochromatic patterns\nformed by the red, green, and blue faces individually must be the same since\nthe rotation carries one pattern onto another. Such an operation is called a\ncolour symmetry. Definition. A colour symmetry of a coloured polyhedron is a\ngeometric symmetry of the (uncoloured) polyhedron which induces a permutation\nof the colours. The set of colour symmetries of a polyhedron forms a group\nwhich is called the colour symmetry group or simply the colour group. The\ncolour-pieseiving symmetries carry faces to ones of like colour so they induce\nthe identity per mutation of the colours. Therefore, they can also be\ninterpreted as colour symmetries and a copy of the colour-preserving group is\ncontained in the colour group. An example which illustrates the differences\nbetween the three kinds of symmetry is provided by the following colouring of\na regular octahedron. Regard the octahedron as a triangular-based antiprism\nand colour the base and the top red, the faces adjacent to the top white, and\nthose adjacent to the base black. This results in a proper 3-colouring of the\noctahedron. The rotational symmetry group of the underlying polyhedron is the\noctahedral group consisting of 24 rotational symmetries. The colour-preserving\nsymmetries are the rotations about the axis joining the centres of the red\nfaces, so the colour-preserving group is C:j. The colour symmetries include\nthe three colour-preserving symmetries and also three others: these are the\n2-fold rotations about axes which join the midpoints of opposite edges and\nwhich are parallel to the base. They all induce the same permutation of the\ncolours: (red —¥ red , black —¥ white, white —¥ black). Therefore, the colour\ngroup contains six colour symmetries and is D>,. (There is a subtle change of\ninterpretation hidden in the last sentence. In Chapter 8, we defined D$ to be\na group of rotational symmetries. In the current context, the elements of the\ngroup are realised as colour symmetries, not geometric ones.) The third\nproperty which may influence the brain's interpretation of an arrangement of\ncolours is the way in which the monochromatic patterns arc1 physically\nrelated. This has more to do with the local properties of the colouring than\nwith the global symmetry of the pattern. The jump between cases (n) and\n\n400 Chapter 10 (Hi) is larger than that between the first two cases, both\nperceptually and mathematically. This is reflected by the fact that\nmathematicians have only recently begun to study the problem of when two\ncolourings have the same 'pattern type'. The following example illustrates\nthat the above groups of symmetries are inadequate to give a complete account\nof a colouring. Figure 10.31 shows two identical pyramids with irregular\nhexagons for bases viewed from above. Although they are coloured differently,\ntheir colour groups are the same, as are their colour- preserving groups and\nsymmetry groups. And in both cases, a clockwise rotation of 120° induces the\nsame permutation: (black —> white, white —> grey, grey —> black). V^ Figure\n10.31. Perfect colourings A colouring of a polyhedron is called a perfect\ncolouring if every (rotational) symmetry of the underlying polyhedron is also\na colour symmetry. The colouring of the octahedron in the previous example is\nnot perfect since its colour group (D3) and symmetry group (O) are different.\nA tetrahedron which is properly coloured (in four colours) is perfectly\ncoloured even though its colour-preserving group is trivial. The coloured\ncompounds are also examples of perfectly coloured poly- hedra. This confirms\nthat colour symmetries capture something of our intuitive idea of a systematic\npattern. The coloured polyhedra described in Examples 1-5 above provide\nfurther examples of perfectly coloured polyhedra. Earlier, these examples were\nused to illustrate the kinds of colour-preserving group that can occur and\ntheir relationships to the rotational symmetry groups. As all the colourings\nare perfect, these examples also show the variety of ways that a group of\ncolour-preserving symmetries can sit inside a colour group. Besides the cases\nwhere the colour-preserving group is either trivial or the whole of the colour\ngroup, the following relationships\n\nPerfect colourings 401 appeared in these examples: T<(), D2<T, D2<0, Cn<Cnp.\nThe exercise on colouring a dipyramid gave examples of two more relationships:\nExamining a large number of coloured polyhedra leads to the observation that\nthese seem to be the only relationships which occur. The colour-preserving\ngroup always sits inside the colour group in one of these ways. One thing to\nnotice about this list is the absence of the icosahedial gioup. This seems\nstrange since, for all the other types of groups (the octahedial, tetra-\nhedral, dihedral and some cyclic groups), examples of coloured polvhedra can\nbe found where the colour-preserving group is non-trivial and yet neithei is\nit the complete set of colour symmetries. But for the icosahedral group, no\nsuch intermediate groups occur. For any coloured polyhedron with icosahedial\ncolour group, the group of colour-preserving symmetries is either trivial (the\ncompound of five cubes) or else it is the whole colour group (the polyhedron\nin Example 2). This phenomenon is a consequence of the internal structure of\nthe icosahedral group. On one hand, as the icosahedral group is large (having\n60 elements), one might expect that it has the potential to contain a lot of\nsubgroups that can arise as groups of colour-preserving symmetries. On the\nother hand, there is a tendency for some kinds of systems to become more\ncomplex as thev become larger. When there is sufficient space within a system,\nits elements can become tangled and intertwined to produce a complicated\nstructure. The icosahedral group fits into the latter category. When the\nmembers of the icosahedial group are interpreted as colour symmetries, its\ninternal structure is such that none of its proper subgroups can occur as\ngroups of colour-preserving symmetries. This property of the subgroups of the\nicosahedral group can be identified abstractly and can be demonstrated to be\nan algebraic property of the group structuie itself. (f) The reader who is\nfamiliar with elementary group theory will have lealised that the structure\nbeing referred to is a lack of normal (or invariant) subgioups. In fact, the\nabove list of colour-preserving groups is based on an enumeiation of the\nnormal subgroups of the rotation groups. In the examples, all of the colour-\npreserving groups are normal subgroups of the symmetry group of the undei\nlying polyhedron. This happened because all of the colourings are perfect and\nbecause of the following fact: Theorem. A colour-preserving group is always a\nnormal subgroup of the colour group. To see this let G be the colour group and\nlet Sn be the group of pei mutations of n objects. There is a natural\nhomomorphism from G to 5,,. The kernel of this map, the group of symmetries\nwhich map onto the identity permutation, is the colour-preserving group. A\nfundamental theorem in group theory states\n\n402 Chapter 10 that the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup. It is\nalso well-known that the only normal subgroups of the icosahedral group are\nitself and the trivial group. The solution of fifth degree equations The\ncomplexity of the structure of the icosahedral group has drop implications in\nanother area of mathematics, namely the theory of equations. This branch of\nmathematics is concerned with finding solutions of polynomials. Methods for\nsolving polynomial equations date back to antiquity. The Gieeks were able to\nsolve quadratic equations using geometrical constructions. Before them, the\nBabylonians (and possibly the Egyptians too) could solve pioblems requiring\nthe solution of a quadratic equation, although they did not have the notation\nto express their method. An algebraic formulation did not appear until after\nthe first century AD. The Chinese also studied the theory of equations and by\nthe thirteenth century their techniques for finding solutions wore wav ahead\nof those in the West. We can find the two solutions of the quadratic equation\nax2 + b:i +<■ = [) by using the formula -b ± Vb2 - Aac 2a ' A similar method\nfor solving cubic equations was unknown in Europe until the sixteenth century.\nAt the end of his Summa de Arithmetica (1494) Luca Pacioli remarked that\nsolving the equations x3 + ex — d and x'] + d — r.v with the current state of\nknowledge was as impossible as squaring the circle. Yet within fifty years,\nthe cubic could be solved. In 1545, the physician Girolamo Caidano published\nhis Ars Magna in which he gave a complete discussion of the solution of cubic\nequations. The methods are ascribed to Niccolo Fontana (also known by his\nnickname 'Tartaglia', the stammerer) who had discovered them at least ten\nyears earlier. He had refused to reveal the details and was persuaded to\ndivulge them to Cardano only after having sworn him to secrecy. The Ars Magna\nalso contains a method of reducing equations of degree four to cubics which is\ndue to Ludovico Ferrari. The methods resulted in formulae similar to that\nabove for the quadratic. The solutions are expressed in terms of the\ncoefficients of the equations combined using only the four basic operations of\narithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and the\nextraction of roots. All polynomials of degree less than five could now be\nsolved by formulae of this kind, and the search started foi a foi inula which\nwould solve quintic (degree five) equations. Despite great effort no progress\nwas made, and by the nineteenth century people were beginning to speculate\nthat a formula might not exist. Joseph-Louis\n\nThe solution of fifth degree equations 403 Lagrange (1736-1813) observed that\nthe method for solving a cubic equation is to reduce the problem to that of\nsolving a quadratic, and that solving a quar- tic proceeds using essentially\nthe same idea to reduce the problem to a cubic. However, applying the trick to\nquintic equations did not reduce the scale of the problem, but produced a\npolynomial of degree six. The first proof that a formula for finding the\nsolutions of a general equation of degree five does not exist was given in\n1799 by the Italian physician Paolo Ruffini (1765-1822). However, some people\nremained unconvinced by Ruffini's arguments, especially those professional\nmathematicians who had devoted a lot of time to the problem. The discussion\nwas ended in 1824 when the Norwegian Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) gave a\nconclusive proof. After it was known that a general formula for solving all\nquintic equations was not possible, attention shifted to the problem of\nfinding necessary and sufficient conditions for determining whether or not a\nformula for the solutions of a particular equation existed. Underlying the\narguments used by Ruffini and Abel is a relationship between the radicals (nth\nroots) and certain subgroups of permutation groups. At that time, the group\nconcept had not been isolated and the ideas involved were not sufficiently\nwell understood for a general theory that applied to arbitrary equations to be\nworked out. A major step in this direction was taken by a young Frenchman\nnamed Evariste Galois (1811-1832). He also realised the importance of 'normal\nsubgroups' and this enabled him to answer completely the problem of which\nequations can be solved by a formula. Galois' idea was to associate a group\nwith the equation which described the way that its solutions are related to\neach other. The properties of this group of 'algebraic symmetries' reflected\nthe properties of the solutions. In particular, if a formula for finding the\nsolutions of the equation exists then the group can be decomposed into smaller\ngroups in a special way. The structures of the Galois groups associated with\nthe equations of degree less than five can be decomposed in the required way,\nand knowledge of these decompositions allows the formulae to be reconstructed.\nHowever, the group associated with most equations of degree five contains the\nicosahedral group and the structure of this group is too complicated to be\nsplit up in the required way. So there is no formula to solve equations of\ndegree five. In the sixteenth century Frangois Viete had shown that cubic\nequations can be reduced to a form where only one of the coefficients is\nunknown. This enabled him to express its solutions in terms of trigonometric\nfunctions. In 1786 E. S. Bring showed how to reduce quintic equations to a\nsimilar form, but his work went unnoticed for fifty years. The reduction of a\ngeneral quintic equation to one having a single parameter meant that its\nsolutions could be found by applying a technique analogous to Viete's solution\nof cubics. This was achieved in 1858 by Charles Hermite (better known for\nproving the transcendence of e). Following\n\n404 Chapter 10 a hint of Galois, he showed that the solutions of a quintic\ncould be found using elliptic functions in place of trigonometric ones. These\nmany strands—the symmetries of polyhedra, group theory, the solution of\nequations, and elliptic functions—were all woven together by Felix Khun in his\nLectures on the Icosahedron and the Solution of Equations of the Fifth Degree.\nThis illustrates the remarkable unity of mathematics. On some occasions\nsimilai ideas will occur to different groups of people working in different\ndisciplines. For a while they develop in parallel, then unexpected connections\nare found; eventually the unifying theme is identified and abstracted. The\ngioup concept, for instance, arose in algebraic equations and geometric\nsymmetries. At other times, many pieces of the patchwork of mathematics are\nbrought together and produce a coherent and beautifully interwoven whole. In\nthe prologue1 to his famous lecture of 23 problems David Hilbert commented on\nthis unexpected unity and used Klein's work as an illustration: It often\nhappens • • ■ that the same problem finds application in the most unlike\nbranches of mathematical knowledge. ■ ■ ■ How convincingly has F. Klein, in\nhis work on the icosahedron, pictured the significance which attaches to the\nproblem of the regular polyhedra in elementary geometry, in group theory, in\nthe theorv of equations and in that of linear differential equations.c Like\nthe components of a compound, the branches of mathematics interlock in\nintriguing ways.\n\nAppendix I Because symmetry groups have been studied in so many areas of\nmathematics, and also in crystallography, several notations have been\ndeveloped to denote them. Each notation has its own rules and internal\nconsistency which comes from the kind of analysis used to study the symmetry\ngroups. Some are compared in the table below.

It is essentially that used by Arthur Schoenflies in his\nKristallsysteme und Krys- tallstructur and described by Harold Hilton in his\nMathematical Crystallography and the Theory of Groups of Movements. Its labels\nare derived from the kinds of symmetry elements (axes and mirror-planes) which\nare present. The second column lists the notation used by H. S. M. Coxeter and\nW. O. J. Moser in their book Generators and Relations for Discrete Groups.\nTheir labels indicate how the groups can be generated as subgroups of\nreflection groups. A plus sign (+) indicates that only the rotational\nsymmetries contributed by certain generators are to be included. The labels in\nthe third column are described by A. V. Shubnikov and V. A. Koptsik in\nSymmetry in Science and Art. As with Schoenflies' notation, the symbols\nindicate some of the symmetry elements which are present. The letter m denotes\nthe presence of a mirror-plane, a single dot (•) means that it contains a\nrotation axis, and two dots (:) means that it is normal to a rotation axis.\nThe tilde symbol (~) over a number indicates an axis of rotation-reflection.\nThe notation in the fourth column was derived by John Conway and William\nThurston from the topological features of quotient orbifolds. Numbers\nfollowing an asterisk (*) refer to the angles at the corners of the orbifold's\nboundary, other numbers indicate the kinds of cone-points, and a cross (x)\nindicates a cioss-cap. For a more complete explanation see Conway's account:\n'The Orbifold Notation for Surface Groups' published in the Proceedings of the\n1990 Durham Conference on Groups, Combinatorics and Geometry, Cambridge Univ.\nPress 1992. The final column lists the notation used by L. Fejes Toth in his\nbook Regular Figures. Rather than concentrate on reflections as the previous\nnotations do, the structure underlying this notation comes from rotations and\ninversion. This causes a discrepancy in the cases of some cyclic and dihedral\ngroups as to when two groups belong to the same kind of system. This shows up\nin the table as odd and even cases of n being listed separately.\n\nAppendix II Chapters 9 and 10 made use of a group theoretic result known as\nthe Orbit- Stabiliser theorem. It was quoted in the form: ( the number of \\\n/the number of symmetries^ \\equivalent objects ) \\ of each object ) _ /the\nnumber of symmetries\\ \\ of the polyhedron ) In Chapter 9 the objects were\ncoloured polyhedra and we were counting equivalent colourings; in Chapter 10\nthe objects were faces, edges or vertices, and the right hand term (the number\nof symmetries of each object) was called the stabiliser. It will be no\nsurprise to learn that the other term (number of equivalent objects) is called\nan orbit. The purpose of this appendix is to give a proof of this theorem.\nSuppose that we have a polyhedron and we wish to study some component or\nproperty of it which we will denote by A. Thus A might be a particular face or\na colouring. Let G be the symmetry group of the polyhedron. The stabiliser of\nA, written stabc(^4), is the set of all symmetries of the polyhedron which\ncarry A to itself: stabc(yl) = {g in G such that g(A) = A }. In the earlier\nexamples, the stabiliser was the set of symmetries which fixed a face, or the\n(colour-preserving) symmetries of a coloured polyhedron. The stabiliser is a\nsubgroup of G. For convenience we shall write H for staba(A) and suppose that\nit contains m symmetries: H = {hu h2,---, hm}- One of these must be the\nidentity and we can choose hi = 1. The orbit of A, written orbited), is the\nset of all the places A is carried to by the symmetries of the polyhedron:\norbitG(yl) = { g(A) for all g in G }. In the colouring example, the orbit\nconsists of the different orientations of a coloured polyhedron. In the\ntransitivity examples, all the faces of a face-transitive\n\n409 polyhedron form a single orbit. Suppose that there are n different things in the orbit of A: orbitG(,4) = {^1,^2,---, An}. One of these must be A itself so we can choose Ax = A. Choose n symmetries g{, #2, • • •, <7n in G such that gt(A) = A{. There may be several symmetries to choose from in each case. For example, any element of stab<7(/4.) can be chosen as gx. Writing |X| to denote the number of members of the set X, we can state the Orbit-Stabiliser theorem as follows. Theorem. |G| = |orbitG(/l) | x |stabG(.4) |. PROOF: To prove the theorem we split up the symmetries of the polyhedion into several sets. We can form a new set (denoted gH) of elements of G as follows: gH = {ghu gh2,---, ghm}. All the products g-hi are distinct because the hi are distinct. Consider the following n such sets: giH = {gihi,gih2,---,gihm} g2H = { g2hu g2h2, ■■•, g-ihm } (JnH = {gnhi, gnh2,---, gnhm} These n sets are called cosets of H. The first one is H itself since ;j\\ is in H. If we can show that all these sets are disjoint and that every element of G appears in some coset then we will have proved |G| = n x m, which is what we need. Step 1. All elements of G can be written in the form gihj. Given any symmetry g in G we consider #(^4) in orbited). Now g(A) must, equal Ai for some i. Hence g(A) = gi{A) for some i =► gTlg{A) = A => g~[g =■ h for some h in H => f) = 9ih.\n\n410 We have written g in the required form. Step 2. The sets g{H are disjoint.\nSuppose some element is in two different sets so that #.7; = //,//, where .1\nand y are some elements of H. Then gjlgi — yx~x. Now yx~l is a product of\nelements of H and is therefore also in H. So gjlgi — h for some h in H and\nthus //, = /7,-/1. We now consider the action of these elements on A. gx{A) =\ngjh{A) => 9i(A) — gj(A) because h is in stab^A) But this is a contradiction\nsince the ^'s were chosen so that this could not happen.\n\nSources of Quotations Introduction a) J.

I devoured Dover’s volumes on\nmazes, the fourth dimension, infinity, and language games—all of these to\nbecome lifelong interests.\n\nMy _Fourth Dimension_ has been one of my best-selling books, with translations\nappearing in France, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Germany, the Netherlands,\nPortugal, and spain. I’m very pleased that Dover is republishing it in\npaperback and ebook editions.\n\nThe fourth dimension is a universal skeleton key, applicable to any number of\nconundrums. I always start with the hallowed _Flatland_ analogy: 4-D is to 3-D\nas 3-D is to 2-D. By now, good old A Square feels like a friend of mine, or\nperhaps an eccentric cousin. Eventually I went so far as to write a novel\ncalled _Spaceland_ , featuring a man named Joe Cube. He begins in our normal\nworld, encounters a four-dimensional being, and travels into higher space. It\nwas an interesting challenge for me to visualize what he saw there. As usual,\nmy starting point was _Flatland_.\n\nI’m glad to have had the fourth dimension in my life for so many years. And\nI’m happy to share this higher knowledge with you.\n\nWelcome to _The Fourth Dimension_!\n\nRudy Rucker\n\nJune 22, 2014\n\n\n**Foreword**  \nby Martin Gardner\n\nAs WRITERS, mathematicians are notoriously inept. There are happy exceptions,\nof course, and at least one teacher of mathematics, Lewis Carroll, wrote\nimmortal fantasy fiction. Eric Temple Bell not only wrote colorfully about\nmathematics for laymen, but under the pseudonym John Taine he churned out a\nraft of science fiction novels. In more recent times, several professional\nmathematicians have written science fiction with strong mathematical\nunderpinnings. Now along comes Rudolf von Bitter Rucker — mathematician,\nnovelist, cartoonist, rock music buff, and a thinker with the courage to\nexplore dark and unfamiliar territory in what he likes to call the mindscape.\n\nRucker’s major mathematical interests are transfinite sets (he has a doctorate\nin mathematical logic from Rutgers) and spaces of higher dimensions. After\nediting a selection of Charles Hinton’s writings about the fourth dimension,\nand writing a popular account of four-space and relativity, Rucker’s first big\nsuccess came in 1982 with the publication of _Infinity and the Mind._ Science\nfiction fans had earlier known him for his wild, funny, sexually outrageous\nnovels and stories in which higher spaces often play essential roles. His\nbest-known novel, _White Light_ , actually has the subtitle _What Is Cantor’s\nContinuum Problem_? The subtitle is the exact title of a paper by the eminent\nlogician Kurt Gödel, with whom Rucker had the privilege of many stimulating\nconversations.\n\n _The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher Reality_ will be eagerly\nread by writers and readers of science fiction, but anyone with even a minimal\ninterest in mathematics and fantasy will find the book as informative and\nmind-dazzling as Rucker’s book on infinity. After exploring the whimsical\nunderworld of Flatland, he plunges into spaces above three with a zest and\nenergy that is breathtaking. The book is interspersed with clever problems for\nthe mathematically competent, and finally, in a grand Carrollian climax,\nRucker boldly invades the infinite dimensions of Hilbert space.\n\nScience fiction? In part, yes, and Rucker pauses frequently to quote from some\nof his bizarre tales. But without the tool of infinite-dimensional spaces,\nmodern physics would be almost impossible. Older books on quantum mechanics\ntalk about how the measurement of particles and quantum systems “collapses the\npsi function.” More recent books prefer the language of a complex Hilbert\nspace, an approach adopted by John von Neumann in his classic work on quantum\ntheory. When you measure a quantum system you are said to “rotate the state\nvector,” an abstract line of precisely defined length and orientation that\nrepresents the system’s state in a set of coordinate systems that constitute a\nHilbert space. Are such spaces “real”? Or are they no more than convenient\nfictions used by physicists to simplify their calculations?\n\nIt is with such deep ontological questions that Rucker concerns himself\nthroughout this book and especially in the final chapters. Here I am unable to\ngo along with his “All is One” philosophy. He seems to have inherited a\ngenetic fondness for the Absolute from his great-great-great-grandfather, the\nfamous philosopher Hegel. Like William James, I do not know if ultimate\nreality is One or Many. Nor can I accept Rucker’s views on synchronicity,\ntaken over from Jung and Koestler, and his seeming belief that consulting the\n_I Ching_ is more likely to produce meaningful “coincidences” than consulting\nsay, Homer, the Bible, or the works of Isaac Asimov.\n\nBut no matter. We are each entitled to what fames called our “over beliefs.”\nWhether you agree or disagree with Rucker’s Tao-tinged metaphysics, you will\nfind his speculations twisting your mind toward fundamental questions that\nrefuse to go away no matter how hard pragmatists and positivists try to banish\nthem.\n\n\n**Preface**\n\nIN 1958, the Louisville Free Public Library had a single shelf of science\nfiction books. My friend Niles Schoening and I used to read and discuss them,\nwondering about time travel, wondering about the fourth dimension. This is\nwhere it all began.\n\nWhen I went off to college in 1963, my father, Embry Rucker, gave me a copy of\nEdwin Abbott’s _Flatland_. As an Episcopal priest, my father had already\nrealized that the fourth dimension can serve as a symbol for higher spiritual\nrealities.\n\nIn the ensuing years, I puzzled over the relationship between the fourth\ndimension as _higher reality_ , and the fourth dimension as _time_. When I got\nmy first teaching job, at SUNY Geneseo, I began working out these connections\nin my lectures for a course on higher geometry. These lectures were published\nby Dover Publications in 1977, under the title _Geometry, Relativity and the\nFourth Dimension_.\n\nIn the seven years since then, I’ve learned a lot more about the fourth\ndimension. In writing _The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Geometry of Higher\nReality_ , I’ve tried to present a definitive and popular account of what the\nfourth dimension means, both physically and spiritually. I am grateful to\nMartin Gardner for lending me a number of rare books on the fourth dimension;\nto Thomas Banchoff for his help with the more technical research; to my\neditor, Gerard Van der Leun, for his encouragement; and to my illustrator,\nDavid Povilaitis, for his wit and weirdness.\n\nMost of all, I would like to thank my family, my friends, my students, and my\ncorrespondents. Enjoy the book!\n\n\n## Part I\n\n## THE  \nFOURTH  \nDIMENSION\n\n\n## 1\n\n## A New Direction\n\nIS THIS ALL THERE IS? Struggle, loneliness, disease, and death … Is this all\nthere is? Life can seem so chaotic, so dreary, so grindingly hard. Who among\nus has not dreamt of some higher reality, some transcendent level of meaning\nand peace?\n\nThere actually _is_ such a higher reality … And it is not so very hard to\nreach. For many, the fourth dimension has served as a gateway into it. But\nwhat is the fourth dimension?\n\n![img](Images/p003_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 1. A new answer for old questions._\n\nNo one can point to the fourth dimension, yet it is all around us.\nPhilosophers and mystics meditate upon it; physicists and mathematicians\ncalculate with it. The fourth dimension is part and parcel of many respected\nscientific theories, yet it is also of great use in such disreputable fields\nas spiritualism and science fiction.\n\nThe fourth dimension is a direction different from all the directions in\nnormal space. Some say that time is the fourth dimension … And this is, in a\nsense, true. Others say that the fourth dimension is a hyperspace direction\nquite different from time … This is also true.\n\nThere are, in fact, many higher dimensions. One of these higher dimensions is\ntime, another higher dimension is the direction m which space is curved, and\nstill another higher dimension may lead toward some utterly different\nuniverses existing parallel to our own.\n\n![img](Images/p003_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 2. Where is it_?\n\nAt the deepest level, our world can be regarded as a pattern in infinite-\ndimensional space, a space in which we and our minds move like fish in water.\n\nOrdinarily, of course, we say that we live in three-dimensional space. What\nprecisely is meant by this? Why _three_? Watch the wheeling flight of swallows\nchasing gnats at dusk. Mathematically speaking, these lovely sweeping curves\nare of great complexity. But it is possible to break any such space curve down\ninto three types of motion: east / west, north / south, and up / down. By\ncombining the three mutually perpendicular types of motion, one can trace out\nany possible curve in our space. _No more than three_ directions are needed,\nand _no less than three_ directions will do — hence we call our space _three_\n-dimensional.\n\n![img](Images/p004_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 3. Etch-A-Sketch drawing of A Square._\n\nAnd when we shall see or feel ourselves in the world of four dimensions we\nshall see that the world of three dimensions does not really exist and has\nnever existed; that it was the creation of our own fantasy, a phantom host, an\noptical illusion, a delusion — anything one pleases excepting only reality.\n\nP. D. OUSPENSKY,\n\n_Tertium Organum,_ 1912\n\nThis fact is illustrated in two dimensions by a toy that was popular a few\nyears ago, the Etch-A-Sketch. The underside of the Etch-A-Sketch’s glass\nscreen is covered by some silvery dust. Turning the knobs moves a stylus under\nthe screen, and the stylus scrapes off dust, leaving dark trails. The left-\nhand knob moves the stylus in the left / right direction, and the right-hand\nknob moves the stylus in the up / down direction. If one twists the two knobs\nat the same time, one can draw any two-dimensional curve at all.\n\nIt is not too hard to imagine a three-dimensional Etch-A-Sketch that would,\nlet us say, move a brightly flaring sparkler about in a dark room. As the\nimage of a sparkler stays on the retina for a few seconds, one could thus have\nthe experience of seeing three-dimensional curves generated by twiddling three\ndifferent knobs: left / right, up / down, and back / forth.\n\nSpeaking of sparklers, there is a nice picture inside the cover of the Rolling\nStones album _Black and Blue._ It is a time exposure of the five Stones waving\nsparklers. Bill Wy-man traces a flat, tightening spiral. Ronnie Wood produces\na messy figure eight. Charlie Watts slowly and patiently draws a big letter\n_O_. Keith starts out high and lets the sparkler fall in a tired zigzag. And\nMick … Ah, Mick … Mick traces the only truly three-dimensional curve in the\ngroup: a complex rodeo pattern of swoops and loops. Waving sparklers in the\ndark is a good way to really savor our space’s three-dimensionality.\n\n![img](Images/p005_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 4. Two degrees of freedom on a curved surface._\n\nAnother way of expressing all this is to say that motion in our space has\n_three degrees of freedom._ At any instant, a bird has three essentially\ndifferent ways to alter its flight: speed up / slow down, wheel left / wheel\nright, climb / dive. Although we can wave our sparklers with just as much\nfreedom, we cannot really move our bodies around in this way. Someone hiking\nin the hills moves up and down with the roll of the land … Yet in terms of\ncontrol, he has only _two_ degrees of freedom: forward / backward, and left /\nright. One can, of course, jump up and down a bit, but because of gravity, the\neffects of this are more or less negligible.\n\nThe point I am making here is that in terms of degrees of freedom, motion on\nthe Earth’s bumpy surface is basically two-dimensional. The surface itself is\na curved three-dimensional object, granted. But any motion that is confined to\nthis surface is essentially a two-dimensional motion. It could be that\nmankind’s perennial dream of flight is a hunger for more dimensions, for more\ndegrees of freedom. The average person only experiences three-dimensional body\nmotion when he or she swims underwater.\n\nDriving a car involves sacrificing yet another degree of freedom. One speeds\nup or slows down (possibly even reversing direction), but that’s all. The road\nitself is a space curve in three-dimensional space, but motion that is\nconfined to this particular curve is basically one-dimensional.\n\n![img](Images/p006_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 5. One degree of freedom on a curved line._\n\nLet us assume that the three dimensions of space are visualized in the\ncustomary fashion, and let us substitute a color for the fourth dimension.\nEvery physical object is liable to changes in color as well as in position. An\nobject might, for example, be capable of going through all shades from red\nthrough violet to blue. A physical interaction between any two bodies is\npossible only if they are close to each other in space as well as in color.\nBodies of different colors would penetrate each other without interference …\nIf we lock a number of flies into a red glass globe, they may yet escape: they\nmay change their color to blue and are then able to penetrate the red globe.\n\nHANS REICHENBACH,\n\n_The Philosophy of Space and Time,_ 1927\n\nAs we will see later, the space we live in is also curved: curved like a\nhillside, twisted like a mountain road. But, in terms of _degrees of freedom,_\nit is clear that our space is three-dimensional. Another way of expressing\nthis is to point out that we can give any location above the Earth’s surface\nby using _three_ numbers: longitude, latitude, and height above sea level.\nAgain, if we’re both in a city, I might typically tell you how to find me by\ngiving you _three_ bits of information. “Walk four blocks uptown, turn right\nand go two blocks crosstown, then go in the building there and ride the\nelevator to the twenty-fifth floor.”\n\nNow, if our space were four-dimensional, such instructions would usually need\na fourth component. “Get out of the elevator and shift through six levels of\nreality.” just as there are many floors over a given location on a city’s two-\ndimensional street grid, we can abstractly imagine there being many different\n“reality levels” available at each of our space locations. In a sense this is\ntrue … Even though we’re in the same room, I might ask, “Where’s your head\nat?” in an effort to get into closer contact.\n\nLet us pursue this line of thought a bit further. Imagine that objects in\nspace could exist at different reality levels, and to make it quite concrete,\nsuppose that each level has its characteristic color — ranging from red\nthrough green to blue. Assume that objects interact only with objects of the\nsame color. A person on the twenty-fifth floor will not stumble over someone\non the second floor; we propose that a blue person can pass right through a\ngreen person.\n\nIn this example, _reality level_ or _color_ would constitute a fourth\ndimension. The three space dimensions plus the color dimension would make up a\nsort of four-dimensional space. A typical person would probably exist on\nseveral levels at once. Waving a four-dimensional sparkler here would involve\nhaving the light’s color, or reality level, change in some complicated way.\nThis would be one way of beginning to think about a four-dimensional space.\n\nAnother, somewhat similar, approach is to propose using _time_ as a fourth\ndimension. If, after all, I really want to see you, it is not enough to tell\nyou how many blocks and how many floors to travel. I need to tell you _how\nsoon_ to show up. Maybe I will not be at the rendezvous for another hour … And\nmaybe I’ll then stay there for only fifteen minutes. To really specify an\nevent, it is not enough to give its longitude, latitude, and height above sea\nlevel. One must also state _when_ it occurs. Just as a blue person can walk\nthrough a green person, a 2:00 A.M. person can walk through a 6:00 P.M.\nperson. In terms of the waving sparklers, the dimension of time comes into\nplay when one notes how _rapidly_ the sparkler moves along each part of its\npath.\n\nBut somehow it misses the mark to represent the fourth dimension by reality\nlevel, by color, or by time. What is really needed here is the concept of a\nfourth _space_ dimension. It is very hard to visualize such a dimension\ndirectly. Off and on for some fifteen years, I have tried to do so. In all\nthis time I’ve enjoyed a grand total of perhaps fifteen minutes’ worth of\ndirect vision into four-dimensional space. Nevertheless, I feel that I\nunderstand the fourth dimension very well. How can this be? How can we talk\nproductively about something that is almost impossible to visualize?\n\nThe key idea is to reason by analogy. The fourth dimension is to three-\ndimensional space as the third dimension is to two-dimensional space.\n4-D:3-D::3-D:2-D. This particular analogy is one of the oldest head tricks\nknown to man. Plato was the first to present it, in his famous allegory of the\ncave.\n\n![img](Images/p008_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig._ 6\\. _Plato’s Cave._\n\nSOCRATES: And now, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened\nor unenlightened: — Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which\nhas a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they\nhave been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that\nthey cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains\nfrom turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a\ndistance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and\nyou will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen\nwhich marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the\npuppets.\n\nGLAUCON: I see.\n\nS: And do you see men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels,\nand statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various\nmaterials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others\nsilent.\n\nG: You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.\n\nS: Like ourselves; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one\nanother, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?\n\nG: True; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never\nallowed to move their heads?\n\nS: And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only\nsee the shadows?\n\nG: Yes.\n\nS: And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose\nthat they were naming what was actually before them?\n\nG: Very true.\n\nS: And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other\nside, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke that\nthe voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?\n\nG: NO question.\n\nS: To them, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the\nimages.\n\nG: That is certain.\n\nPLATO,\n\n_The Republic,_ circa 370 B.C.\n\nHere Plato asks us to imagine a race of men who are chained up in an\nunderground den, chained in such a way that all they can ever look at is\nshadows on their cave’s wall. Behind the men is a low ramp, and behind that a\nfire. Objects move back and forth on the ramp, and the fire casts shadows of\nthese objects on the cave’s wall. The prisoners think that these shadows are\nthe only reality … They do not even realize that they have three-dimensional\nbodies. They talk to each other, but hearing the echoes bounce off the wall,\nthey assume that they and their fellows are also shadows.\n\nThere are several interesting features in Plato’s allegory. It is particularly\nstriking that the prisoners actually think that they are their own shadows.\nThis is interesting because it suggests the idea that a person is _really_\nsome higher-dimensional soul that influences and watches this “shadow world”\nof three-dimensional objects.\n\nTo bring this particular idea home, let us update Plato’s cave allegory a bit.\nImagine a very large TV screen that displays full-color computer-generated\nimages of people and objects moving about. Now imagine some people who have\nfrom birth been chained motionless in front of the giant tube. Electrodes run\nfrom their nervous systems to the image-generating computer, and for each\nperson there is a particular TV personality he or she can control. These\nprisoners would mistake the flat phosphorescent TV screen for reality.\n\n![img](Images/p009_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 7. Plato’s Cave II._\n\nSo, one conclusion to draw from Plato’s allegory is that we should not be too\nsure that our everyday view of the world is the most correct and most\ncomprehensive view possible. Common sense can be misleading, and there may be\na great deal more to reality than meets the eye.\n\n[PUZZLE 1.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch1pa1)\n\n_Stare out your window and imagine that the objects you see are actually two-\ndimensional shapes embedded in the window glass. The window glass is thus a\nsort of two-dimensional world. Under what condition can, say, two car shapes\nmove through each other without collision_?\n\nAn even more important aspect of Plato’s allegory is that this allegory\nintroduces the notion of a two-dimensional world. Insofar as the prisoners in\nthe cave really think that they are shadows on the wall, they are viewing\nthemselves as two-dimensional patterns. What would it be like to be a two-\ndimensional being? Would a two-dimensional being be able to imagine a third\ndimension?\n\n![img](Images/p010_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 8. A Square._\n\nIn the next chapter we will talk about an imaginary two-dimensional world\nknown as Flatland; and we will study the adventures of A Square, Flatland’s\nmost famous citizen. A Square’s path to an understanding of the third\ndimension is, we will see, a guide for our own attempts to understand the\nfourth dimension.\n\n\n## 2\n\n## Flatland\n\nF _LATLAND ,_ first published in 1884, is the story of a square who takes a\ntrip into higher dimensions. A century has passed and people are still talking\nabout it. The author of _Flatland_ was a Victorian schoolmaster named Edwin\nAbbott Abbott. Given the curious fact that his middle and last names were\nidentical, it seems possible that Abbott might have been nicknamed _Abbott_\nSquared or _A_ Squared. Thus, it may be that Abbott felt a considerable degree\nof identification with A Square, the hero of _Flatland._ After all, Abbott’s\nlife was, in some ways, as strictly regulated as the life of a two-dimensional\nFlatlander.\n\nEdwin Abbott Abbott was born in London on December 20, 1838, the son of Edwin\nAbbott, head of the Philological School at Marylebone. Abbott attended the\nCity of London School as a boy. He went on to Cambridge, was ordained a\nminister, was married, and at the age of twenty-seven returned to the City of\nLondon School as headmaster. He wrote a number of books on grammar and\ntheology, books with titles like _How to Parse_ and _Letters on Spiritual\nChristianity. Flatland_ was his one venture into fantasy.\n\nThe book works on three levels. Most obviously, it is a satire on the staid\nand heartless society of the Victorians. “Irregulars” (cripples) are put to\ndeath, women have no rights at all, and when A Square tries to teach his\nfellows about the third dimension he is imprisoned. The second level of\nmeaning in _Flatland_ is scientific. By thinking about A Square’s difficulties\nin understanding the third dimension, we become better able to deal with our\nown problems with the fourth dimension. Finally, at the deepest level, we can\nperhaps view _Flatland_ as Abbott’s circuitous way of trying to talk about\nsome intense spiritual experiences. A Square’s trip into higher dimensions is\na perfect metaphor for the mystic’s experience of higher reality.\n\n![img](Images/p012_1.jpg)\n\n_Edwin Abbott Abbott (1838-1926)_\n\nI call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, but to make its nature\nclearer to you, my happy readers, who are privileged to live in Space.\n\nImagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, Triangles, Squares,\nPentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, instead of remaining fixed in their\nplaces, move freely about, on or in the surface, but without the power of\nrising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows — and you will then\nhave a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas, a few years\nago, I should have said “my universe” but now my mind has been opened to\nhigher views of things.\n\nEDWIN A. ABBOTT,\n\n_Flatland,_ 1884\n\nFlatland is a plane inhabited by creatures that slide about. We might think of\nthem as being like coins on a tabletop. Alternatively, we could think of them\nas colored patterns in a soap film, or ink spots in a sheet of paper.\n\nIn Flatland, the lower classes are triangles with only two sides equal. The\nupper classes are regular polygons, that is, figures with all sides equal. The\nmore sides one has, the greater one’s social standing. The highest caste of\nall consists of polygons with so many sides that they are indistinguishable\nfrom perfect circles.\n\nAs mentioned above, _Flatland_ is more than just a book about dimensions. In\nsomewhat the same manner as _Gulliver’s Travels,_ it satirizes the attitudes\nof the society in which its author lived. In our Western culture, women have\nprobably never been at such a disadvantage as in the nineteenth century.\nAccordingly, the women of Flatland are not even skinny triangles: they are but\nlines, infinitely less respected than the priestly circles. Abbott, of course,\nrealizes the injustice of this. When a sphere from “Space-land” visits\nFlatland, he has this to say: “It is not for me to classify human faculties\naccording to merit. Yet many of the best and wisest in Spaceland think more of\nthe affections than of the understanding, more of your despised Straight Lines\nthan of your belauded Circles.”\n\n![img](Images/p013_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 9. Eight Flatlanders: Woman, Soldier, Workman, Merchant, Professional\nMan, Gentleman, Nobleman, High Priest._\n\nI take the plane upon which my shadow-man is, and move it through three\ndimensions. Thus the shadow-man perceives this third dimension. The man\nhimself may be changed, and, at the end of his trip be pale and rumpled, when\nhe had started the trip rosy and flat.\n\nGUSTAV THEODOR FECHNER,\n\n“Why Space Has Four Dimensions,” 1846\n\nAn initial question about Flatland is the problem of how these lines and\npolygons can see anything at all. If you were to put a number of cardboard\nshapes on a tabletop and then lower your eye to the plane of the table, you\nwould really see just a bunch of line segments. How can Flatlanders tell a\ntriangle from a square? How do they build up the idea of a two-dimensional\nworld from their one-dimensional retinal images?\n\nAbbott reports that the space of Flatland is permeated with a thin haze.\nBecause of this, the glowing sides of the polygons shade off rapidly into\ndimness. If you are looking at the corner of a triangle and the corner of a\npentagon, you can tell them apart because the triangle’s sides shade off more\nrapidly.\n\nThis may seem a bit artificial, but just stop to consider this: _our_ retinal\nimages of the world are two-dimensional patterns, yet we can distinguish a\nwide range of three-dimensional objects. If I look, for instance, at a sphere\nand a flat disk, I can tell them apart by their shading. Another important way\nin which we notice our world’s three-dimensionality is by the fact that\nobjects can move _behind_ and _in front of_ each other. If, looking out a\nrestaurant window, I see a person walk in front of my car, I do not assume\nthat he is somehow dematerializing my car. I recognize that there is a third\ndimension of space, and that in this dimension the sidewalk is closer than the\nstreet. Just as we can build up a mental image of our three-dimensional world,\nthe Flatlanders have adequate images of their two-dimensional world.\n\n![img](Images/p014_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 10. Depth is simpler than dematerialization._\n\nThis great man was used to say that, as we can conceive beings (like\ninfinitely attenuated bookworms in an infinitely thin sheet of paper) which\npossess only the notion of space of two dimensions, so we may imagine beings\ncapable of realising space of four or a greater number of dimensions.\n\nSARTORIUS VON\n\nWALTERSHAUSEN,\n\n_Biography of Carl Friedrich Gauss,_ 1860\n\nA Square’s dimensional adventures begin when he has a dream, a dream of\nLineland:\n\nI saw before me a vast multitude of small Straight Lines (which I naturally\nassumed to be Women) interspersed with other Beings still smaller and of the\nnature of lustrous points — all moving to and fro in one and the same Straight\nLine, and, as nearly as I could judge, with the same velocity.\n\nA noise of confused multitudinous chirping or twittering issued from them at\nintervals as long as they were moving; but sometimes they ceased from motion,\nand then all was silence.\n\nApproaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women, I accosted her,\nbut received no answer. A second and a third appeal on my part were equally\nineffectual. Losing patience at what appeared to me intolerable rudeness, I\nbrought my mouth into a position full in front of her mouth so as to intercept\nher motion, and loudly repeated my question, “Woman, what signifies this\nconcourse, and this strange and confused chirping, and this monotonous motion\nto and fro in one and the same Straight Line?”\n\n![img](Images/p015_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 11. Abbott’s drawing of Lineland._\n\n“I am no Woman,” replied the small Line: “I am the Monarch of the world.”\n\nAlthough all the Linelanders can see of each other is a single point, they\nhave a very good sense of hearing, and can estimate how far away each of their\nfellows is. The men have a voice at either end: bass on the left, tenor on the\nright. By noting the time lag between the two voices it is possible to tell\nhow long a given male Linelander is. The poor women, of course, are just\npoints!\n\n![img](Images/p015_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 12. A Square moves through Lineland._\n\nA Square tries to tell the king about the second dimension. The king doesn’t\nunderstand, and asks A Square to move in the direction of the mysterious\nsecond dimension. A Square complies, and moves right through the space of\nLineland. (In figure 12 I have labeled the king’s bass and tenor ends.)\nNaturally enough, the king simply perceives this “motion” as a segment that\nappears out of nowhere, stays for a minute, and then disappears all at once.\nThe king denies the reality of the second dimension, A Square loses his\ntemper, the dream ends.\n\n![img](Images/p016_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 13. A Square and his wife in a locked room._\n\nI landed on all fours … There was a sort of floor about a yard below the plane\nof Flatland. When I stood up, it was as if I were standing waist-deep in an\nendless, shiny lake. My fall through the Flatlanders’ space had smashed up one\nof their houses. Several of them were nosing at my waist, wondering what I\nwas. To my surprise, I could feel their touch quite distinctly. They seemed to\nhave a thickness of several millimeters …\n\nI was standing in the middle of a “street,” that is to say, in the middle of a\nclear path lined with Flatland houses on either side. The houses had the form\nof large squares and rectangles, three to five feet on a side. The Flatlanders\nthemselves were as Abbott has described them: women are short Lines with a\nbright eye at one end, the soldiers are very sharp isosceles Triangles, and\nthere are Squares, Pentagons and other Polygons as well. The adults are, on\nthe average, about twelve inches across.\n\nThe buildings that lined my street bore signs in the form of strings of\ncolored dots along their outer walls. To my right was the house of a childless\nHexagon and his wife. To my left was the home of an equilateral Triangle,\nproud father of three little Squares. The Triangle’s door, a hinged line-\nsegment, stood ajar. One of his children, who had been playing in the street,\nsped inside, frightened by my appearance. The plane of Flatland cut me at the\nwaist and arms, giving me the appearance of a large blob flanked by two\nsmaller blobs — a weird and uncanny spectacle, to be sure.\n\nRUDY RUCKER,\n\n“Message Found in a Copy of Flatland,” 1983\n\nThe next evening A Square and his wife are comfortably sealed up in the safety\nof their home, when suddenly a voice out of nowhere speaks to them. And then,\na moment later, a circle appears in the confines of their tightly locked\nhouse. It is A Sphere, come to teach A Square about the third dimension.\n\n![img](Images/p016_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 14. A Circle appears in A Square’s locked room._\n\nReasoning by analogy, you can see that a four-dimensional creature would be\nable to reach into any of our rooms or cubbyholes, no matter how well they are\nsealed up. A four-dimensional creature could empty out a safe without cracking\nit, for the safe has no walls against the fourth dimension. A four-dimensional\nsurgeon could reach into your viscera without breaking your skin. A four-\ndimensional creature could drink up your Chivas Regal without ever opening the\nbottle!\n\n![img](Images/p017_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 15. Liquor thief from the next dimension._\n\nIf only you had the muscles to twitch part of your arm up into the fourth\ndimension, you could reach in “around” the window at Tiffany’s and take out\nthe biggest diamond on display. This _would not_ be done by somehow having\nyour arm turn into gas or a ray of light. The heist would be done by having\nyour arm move up through the fourth dimension. The diamond would be brought\nout by lifting it up into the fourth dimension to get “around” the sheet of\nglass.\n\n![img](Images/p017_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 16. The perfect crime._\n\nReturning to A Square, there he is, locked in his house, talking to what seems\nto be a circle, another two-dimensional creature. The Sphere objects to this\nflat characterization of himself:\n\n“I am not a plane Figure, but a Solid. You call me a Circle; but in reality I\nam not a Circle, but an indefinite number of Circles, of size varying from a\nPoint to a Circle of thirteen inches in diameter, one placed on the top of the\nother. When I cut through your plane as I am now doing, I make in your plane a\nsection which you, very rightly, call a Circle. For even a Sphere — which is\nmy proper name in my own country — if he manifest himself at all to an\ninhabitant of Flatland — must needs manifest himself as a Circle.\n\n“Do you not remember — for I, who see all things, discerned last night the\nphantasmal vision of Lineland written upon your brain — do you not remember, I\nsay, how when you entered the realm of Lineland, you were compelled to\nmanifest yourself to the King, not as a Square, but as a Line, because that\nLinear Realm had not Dimensions enough to represent the whole of you, but only\na slice or section of you? In precisely the same way, your country of Two\nDimensions is not spacious enough to represent me, a being of Three, but can\nonly exhibit a slice or section of me, which is what you call a Circle.”\n\n![img](Images/p018_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 17. A Sphere moves through Flatland._\n\nThe Sphere proceeds to demonstrate the third dimension by moving through A\nSquare’s plane, just as A Square had moved through Lineland for the king. What\nA Square sees is a point that turns into a circle. The circle swells to a\ncertain maximum size, then shrinks back to a point, which disappears. His\ngreat difficulty is in thinking of all these different circles as existing all\ntogether in the form of a sphere.\n\nPause for a moment and try to imagine four-dimensional space. It is right next\nto you, but in a direction you can’t point to. No matter how well hidden you\nmay be, a four-dimensional creature can see you perfectly well, inside and\noutside.\n\n![img](Images/p018_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 18. A hypersphere moves through our space._\n\nWhat would you see if, right this moment, a four-dimensional hypersphere were\nto pass through the space near your head? Reasoning strictly by analogy, you\nwould expect to see first a point, then a small sphere, then a bigger sphere,\nthen a small sphere, and then a final point that disappears. Visually, it\nwould be much the same as seeing a balloon that is first blown up and then\ndeflated. Next time you have a balloon in hand, you might even try smoothly\nblowing it up and letting the air back out. That, basically, is what you would\nsee if a hypersphere passed through the space of your room. A sphere is a\nthree-dimensional stack of circles; a hypersphere is a four-dimensional stack\nof spheres.\n\nBut it is very hard to see how to stack things up in a new dimension. A\nSquare, far from believing that he has seen the cross sections of a sphere,\nshrieks, “Monster, be thou juggler, enchanter, dream or devil, no more will I\nendure thy mockeries,” and rams his hardest right angle against A Sphere’s\ncross section.\n\n![img](Images/p019_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 19. Impaled by a policeman._\n\nAn interesting question comes up here. If A Square were actually to cut into A\nSphere, would it matter to the sphere? Would it be possible for the\nFlatlanders to keep a three-dimensional being captive? To make this question\nquite concrete, imagine that you had somehow found the real Flatland. You\nstick your hand through it and an enraged isosceles triangle spears right\nthrough your wrist. Then what?\n\nTo answer the question, we have to decide exactly what Flatland is like. If\nthe Flatlanders are truly two-dimensional, with no thickness at all, then they\nwill be as immaterial as shadows or patches of light. In this case, having an\nisosceles intersect your wrist would not hurt, nor would it limit your freedom\nof movement. Indeed, it is debatable whether such an insubstantial Flatlander\nwould actually be able to poke through your skin.\n\nOne problem with the idea of truly two-dimensional Flatlanders is that it is a\nlittle hard to see how they could have any solidity or reality. If they were\nindeed just like shaded regions of the plane, then there would really be\nnothing to prevent them from freely moving through each other. One way out of\nthis difficulty might be to have the “atoms” of a two-dimensional Flatland\nconsist of little wrinkles or bumps in the plane of the Flatland space. Thus A\nSquare might be a sort of mesa in the rubbery sheet of Flatland’s space. Here\nwe could suppose that the space is infinitely thin, but it is easier to\nimagine that the “rubbery sheet of Flatland’s space” does itself have a slight\nthickness.\n\n![img](Images/p020_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 20. A Square as a bump in the plane._\n\nWhen residing and touring in the North of England several years ago, I talked\nand lectured several times on the fourth dimension. One day after having\nretired to bed, I lay fully awake thinking out some problems connected with\nthis subject. I tried to visualize or think out the shape of a four-\ndimensional cube, which I imagined to be the simplest four-dimensional shape.\nTo my great astonishment I saw before me first a four-dimensional globe and\nafterwards a four-dimensional cube, and learned only then from this object-\nlesson that the globe is the simplest body, and not the cube, as the third-\ndimensional analogy ought to have told me beforehand.\n\nThe remarkable thing was that the definite endeavor to see the one thing made\nme see the other. I saw the forms as before me in the air (though the room was\ndark), and behind the forms I saw clearly a rift in the curtains through which\na glimmer of light filtered into the room …\n\nI forgo the attempt to describe the four-dimensional cube as to its form.\nMathematical description would be possible but would at thè same time\ndisintegrate the real impression in its totality. The fourth-dimensional globe\ncan be better described. It was an ordinary three-dimensional globe, out of\nwhich, on each side, beginning at its vertical circumference bent, tapering\nhorns proceeded, which, with a circular bend, united their points above the\nglobe from which they started. The effect is best indicated by circumscribing\nthe numeral 8 by a circle. So three circles are formed, the lower one\nrepresenting the initial globe, the upper one representing empty space, and\nthe greater circle circumscribing the whole. If it now be understood that the\nupper circle does not exist and the lower (small) circle is identical with the\nouter (large) circle, the impression will have been conveyed, at least to some\nextent …\n\nI have in a like manner had rare visions of the fifth-and sixth-dimensional\nfigures … The fifth-dimensional vision is best described by saying that it\nlooked like an Alpine relief map, with the singularity that all mountain peaks\nand the whole landscape represented in the map were _one_ mountain, or again\nin other words as if all the mountains had one single base.\n\nJOHAN VON MANEN,\n\n_Some Occult Experiences,_ 1913\n\nSo now what if the Flatlanders _do_ have a slight thickness? Abbott himself\nopts for this alternative in the preface to the second edition of _Flatland._\nHere he describes how A Square comes to believe that insofar as Flatland\nreally exists inside some higher space, it must be that the Flatlanders have\nheight as well as length and breadth. Since each of them has the same height,\nthere is no way for them to notice it. A Square reports an unintentionally\nfunny conversation in which he discusses this point with the ruler of\nFlatland:\n\nI tried to prove to him that he was “high,” as well as long and broad,\nalthough he did not know it. But what was his reply? “You say I am ‘high’;\nmeasure my ‘high-ness’ and I will believe you.” What could I do? How could I\nmeet his challenge?\n\nEven if all the Flat-landers were fully one inch high, they would not be able\nto notice this height, provided they still had no power of motion or variation\nin the third dimension. Of course, if there were Flatlanders of varying\nheights, then _some_ kind of difference would be noticed, though the Fiat-\nlanders’ description of the difference might be some vague, nongeometrical\nquality like charisma, force of personality, or “aura.”\n\n![img](Images/p021_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 21. A Square is high with the boss._\n\nNow, if the Flatlanders did have an actual three-dimensional thickness, then\nhaving one of them cut into you would be like being cut with a knife blade.\nAnd if the creature was large enough, it might have enough mass to make your\nescape difficult.\n\nIn _Flatland,_ as it turns out, Sphere becomes angry with Square’s attempts to\nstab him, and finally grabs Square and lifts him up into space. A Square finds\nit an unsettling experience:\n\nAn unspeakable horror seized me. There was a darkness; then a dizzy, sickening\nsensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line that was no Line;\nSpace that was not Space: I was myself, and not myself. When I could find\nvoice, I shrieked aloud in agony, “Either this is madness or it is Hell.” “It\nis neither,” calmly replied the voice of the Sphere, “it is Knowledge; it is\nThree Dimensions: open your eye once again and try to look steadily.”\n\n![img](Images/p021_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 22. What if the Sphere just got A Square’s skin}_\n\nHere again, an interesting side issue comes up. Mightn’t it be harmful for A\nSquare to be lifted out of his space? We had better assume that the Square has\nsome thin membranes sealing off his upper and lower faces against the third\ndimension, for otherwise when A Sphere pulls on a corner he might get only the\nskin! And rather than thinking of A Square as resting _on_ his space, let’s\nregard him as _in_ a slightly thickened plane.\n\n![img](Images/p022_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 23. A Square is really a thick part of a thick plane._\n\nAmong the countries of the world, Chile is remarkable for its great length and\nextreme narrowness. On the west coast of South America for 2700 miles it\nstretches ribbonlike from north to south, between the Andes Mountains and the\nPacific Ocean. In some places it is less than 40 miles wide.\n\nLet us suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the people of this land of\nChile for some reason should be restricted from passing outside the boundaries\nof their country and in fact become incapable of having any communication with\nthe outside world. Let us suppose also that the width of the country in an\neast and west direction gradually diminishes till it becomes so small as to be\npractically negligible. The Chilean world would thus become a very thin north\nand south vertical slice of space which would be two-dimensional for all\npractical purposes.\n\nCorrespondingly the inhabitants of the Chilean Thinland would become thin\npaper-like beings, capable of north and south and vertical motions, but not\nable to sidestep objects or to rotate the head sideways …\n\n[T]he two eyes of a Chilean Thinlander would take up positions on the front\nedge of the face, as for instance one above the other on the forehead, or in\norder to get a longer base triangulation in distance vision, one on the\nforehead and the other on the tip of the chin. In order to look backward, that\nis, behind one, since there could be no turning around of the body or head\nsidewise as such motion would involve a use of the third dimension, a long\nflexible neck would have to be developed so that the head could be tilted\nbackwards into an upside-down position.\n\nFLETCHER DURRELL,\n\n_Mathematical Adventures,_ 1938\n\nThe best-known two-dimensional world other than Flat-land is known as Astria.\nIt is described in Charles H. Hin-ton’s 1907 book, _An Episode of Flatland: Or\nHow a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension._ Here is the passage where\nHinton explains his idea for the world:\n\n![img](Images/p022_2.jpg)\n\n_A Square’s gut busts him._\n\n[PUZZLE 2.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch2pa1)\n\n_It would seem that Flatlanders cannot have a complete digestive system in the\nform of a tube running the length of their bodies, for such a tube cuts them\nin half. Is there any way around this problem_?\n\nPlacing some coins on the table one day, I amused myself by pushing them\nabout, and it struck me that one might represent a planetary system of a\ncertain sort by their means. This large one in the center represents the sun,\nand the others its planets journeying round it. And in this case considering\nthe planets as inhabited worlds, confined in all their movements round the\nsun, to a slipping over the surface of the table, I saw that we must think of\nthe beings that inhabit these worlds as standing out from the rims of them,\nnot walking over the flat surface of them. Just as attraction in the case of\nour earth acts towards the center, and the center is inaccessible by reason of\nthe solidity on which we stand, so the inhabitants of my coin worlds would\nhave an attraction proceeding out in every direction along the surface of the\ntable from the center of the coin, and “up” would be to them out from the\ncenter beyond the rim, while “down” would be towards the center inwards from\nthe rim. And beings thus situated would be rightly described as standing on\nthe rim. [Most of Hinton’s essays can be found in _The Selected Writings of C.\nH.

Astrians on a small planet._\n\n[PUZZLE 2.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch2pa2)\n\n_Abbott’s Flatland is not really a very close analogue of our world. For\nalthough our space is 3-D, we cannot move around freely in 3-D space. Instead\nwe must walk around on the surface of a sphere. What would be an analogous\ndesign for a 2-D world_?\n\nA drawback with a world design like this is that the polygons have so much\ntrouble moving past each other, building houses, and so on. Many of these\ndifficulties are resolved in A. K. Dewdney’s 1984 book _The Planiverse._ As is\n_The Fourth Dimension,_ Dewdney’s book is in some measure a celebration of\n_Flatland’s_ centennial.\n\nOne final plane-universe book worth mentioning is the 1965 book _Sphereland,_\nby the Dutch mathematician Dionys Burger. Burger describes a world that is\nsomething of a compromise between Flatland, with its great freedom of\nmovement, and Astria, with its close resemblance to Earth. Burger’s notion is\nthat, as in Astria, the 2-D creatures live near the surface of a disk planet.\nBut he proposes that they be very light, and thus able to live in their\nplanet’s atmosphere. It is as if people were able to live in clouds, clouds\nfloating above tropical vegetation that is, in turn, floating on a sea that\nsurrounds the planet’s dense core.\n\n![img](Images/p024_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 25. Cities in the sky._ (_Drawing from Dionys Burger’s_ Sphereland.)\n\n\n## 3\n\n## Pictures of the  \nGone World\n\nIMAGINE that you have been lifted up into hyperspace. What would our world\nlook like from this vantage point? To begin with, note that our 3-D space\nwould cut 4-D hyperspace into two regions, just as a 0-D point cuts a 1-D line\nin two, a 1-D line cuts a 2-D plane in two, and a 2-D plane cuts a 3-D space\nin two. (By the way, we speak of a point as _zero_ -dimensional, 0-D, because\nsomeone whose entire space is limited to one point has _no_ degrees of freedom\nin his or her motions.)\n\n![img](Images/p025_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 26. An n-dimensional space cuts an_ (n + _1_)_-dimensional space in\nhalf._\n\nWhat shall we call the two regions of hyperspace determined by our space?\nCharles H. Hinton has suggested the words _ana_ and _kata,_ to be used more or\nless like the words _up_ and _down._ Just to have something to think about, we\nmight think of heaven as lying _ana_ above our space, and hell as lying _kata_\nbelow. A 4-D angel expelled from heaven would tumble through our space like a\nman falling through Flatland: an exciting moment of grotesque,\nincomprehensible cross sections splitting and merging and falling about!\n\n![img](Images/p026_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 27. Man falling through Flatland._\n\nLet us take a certain plane — for instance, that which separates the surface\nof Lake Ladoga which surrounds us, from the atmosphere above it, in this quiet\nautumn evening. Let us suppose that this plane is a separate world of two\ndimensions, peopled with its own beings, which can move only on this plane …\n\nLet us suppose that, having escaped from behind our Schlusselburg bastions,\nyou went for a bathe in the lake.\n\nAs beings of three dimensions you also have two dimensions which lie on the\nsurface of the water. You will occupy a definite place in the world of shadow\nbeings. All the parts of your body above and below the level of the water will\nbe imperceptible to them, and they will be aware of nothing but your contour,\nwhich is outlined by the surface of the lake. Your contour must appear to them\nas an object of their own world, only very astonishing and miraculous. The\nfirst miracle from their point of view will be your sudden appearance in their\nmidst. It can be said with full conviction that the effect you would create\nwould be in no way inferior to the unexpected appearance among ourselves of\nsome ghost from the unknown world. The second miracle would be the surprising\nchangeability of your external form. When you are immersed up to your waist\nyour form will be for them almost elliptical, because only the line on the\nsurface surrounding your waist and impenetrable for them will be perceptible\nto them. When you begin to swim you will assume in their eyes the outline of a\nman. When you wade into a shallow place so that the surface on which they live\nwill encircle your legs, you will appear to them transformed into two ring-\nshaped beings. If, desirous of keeping you in one place, they surround you on\nall sides, you can step over them and find yourself free from them in a way\nquite inconceivable to them. In their eyes you would be an all-powerful being\n— an inhabitant of a higher world, similar to those supernatural beings about\nwhom theologians and metaphysicians tell us.\n\nN. A. MOROSOFF,\n\n“Letter to My Fellow-Prisoners in the Fortress of Schlusselburg,” 1891\n\nJust as man’s Flatland cross section could be a number of irregular shapes\nwith skin boundaries, a hyperbeing’s cross section in our space might be a\nbunch of bobbing globs of skin-covered flesh. Some of the blobs might have\nthings like teeth or claws! Being “picked up” by a hyperbeing would probably\ninvolve a bunch of globs closing in on you like cross sections of a hand’s\nfingers.\n\nOnce you are out in hyperspace, you can get some very strange perspectives on\nthose you left behind. Consider how Flatland looks to us: we can see all four\nsides of A Square, and we can see every detail of innards. By the same token,\na 4-D creature should be able to look down at me and, at one glance, see every\nsquare inch of my skin, the inside and outside of my stomach, the convolutions\nof my brain, and so on.\n\n![img](Images/p027_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 28. Woman menaced by a creature from the fourth dimension._\n\nBut how, you may ask, could a 4-D person “see” all sides of a 3-D object at\nonce? A human being’s retina is a two-dimensional disk of nerve endings. By\nanalogy, we would expect a 4-D creature’s retina to be a three-dimensional\nsphere of nerve endings. My seeing A Square consists of the excitation of a\nsquare-shaped pattern of nerve endings in my retina. A 4-D creature’s “seeing”\nme would consist of the excitation of a person-shaped pattern of nerve endings\nin the little ball of his retina. Each point in A Square’s body sends a light\nray up to a single point in my retina. Each point in my body sends a light ray\n_ana_ to a single point in the 4-D creature’s retina.\n\n![img](Images/p027_2.jpg)\n\n_Perpendicular worlds._\n\n[PUZZLE 3.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa1)\n\n_In four dimensions it is possible to have two 3-D spaces “perpendicular” to\neach other. Two such spaces would have only a plane in common. Suppose now\nthat there is a 3-D space perpendicular to ours, a space with people moving\naround in it. Use a Flatland analogy to figure out how these people would\nappear to us._\n\n![img](Images/p028_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 29. A 2-D with an image of A Square, and a 3-D retina with an image of a\nperson._\n\nI felt myself rising through space. It was even as the Sphere had said. The\nfurther we receded from the object we beheld, the larger became the field of\nvision. My native city, with the interior of every house and every creature\ntherein, lay open to my view in miniature. We mounted higher, and lo, the\nsecrets of the earth, the depths of mines and inmost caverns of the hills,\nwere bared before me.\n\nEDWIN A. ABBOTT,\n\n_Flatland_ , 1889\n\nIt is a curious feature of 4-D space that we can connect two points in the\ninteriors of two solid 3-D objects without piercing these objects’ surfaces.\nThe trick is to use _ana / kata_ motions to get in and out of the solid 3-D\nobjects. If you’re inside a cubical room and move _ana_ out of it, it’s as if\nyou had suddenly dematerialized. You don’t go through the walls or the floor\nor the ceiling, you move over in the _ana_ direction to a part of 4-D space\nwhere the room doesn’t exist at all.\n\n![img](Images/p028_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 30. Connecting interior points without cutting through the boundary._\n\n[PUZZLE 3.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa2)\n\n_If we assume that A Square’s eye stays the same when he is lifted into 3-D\nspace, he will not really be able to see whole 2-D objects as we do. What will\nhe see_? _How might he build up a mental image of the full 2-D Flatland_?\n\nSo the reason that a 4-D creature can see all of me inside and out is that\nsuch a creature’s “retina” is able to form a completely detailed model of my\nbody. But this is not really so puzzling or occult a phenomenon. The human\nbrain is able to mimic such behavior … For do you not have a detailed 3-D\nmental image of your right hand? When you think of your hand you do not\nnecessarily think of just the front or just the back. It is really possible to\nhave the idea of a 3-D object seen from no particular direction — or from all\ndirections at once.\n\nWe can form especially good 3-D images of transparent objects such as\npaperweights, wine bottles, or glasses of water. Here, unlike with the hand,\nthere is no difficulty in imagining the inside parts. Holding 3-D images in\nyour mind is definitely something worth doing. Try, for instance, to think\nabout your house — all of it, seen from no particular vantage point. Here you\nare getting close to a higher-dimensional experience.\n\nSo a 4-D view of our 3-D world is not totally inconceivable. But what would it\nbe like to look at 4-D objects? We saw with the hypersphere in [chapter\n2](10_Chapter2.html) that it is possible to get images of various 3-D cross\nsections of such a hyperobject, but how are we to combine these sections into\na 4-D whole?\n\nSome people might say at the outset that it is hopeless to try to think of\nfour-dimensional objects. For how can our 3-D brains ever hold images of 4-D\nobjects? This argument has some force, but it is not really conclusive.\nDrawings use 2-D arrangements of lines to represent 3-D objects. Why shouldn’t\nwe be able to build up 3-D arrangements of neurons that represent 4-D objects?\nMore fancifully, perhaps our minds are not just 3-D patterns: maybe our brains\nhave a slight 4-D hyperthickness, or maybe our minds extend out of our brains\nand into hyperspace!\n\nI’ll spend the rest of this chapter discussing two of the simpler 4-D shapes:\nthe hypersphere and the hypercube. We’ll start with the hypersphere, though if\nyou hate math you might want to skip up to where I talk about the hypercube.\n\nA sphere of any dimensionality is specified by giving its center and its\nradius. In any space, the sphere with center point _0_ and radius _r_ is the\nset of all points _P_ whose distance from _0_ is _r._ In 2-D space this\ndefinition leads to a circle of radius _r_ , in 3-D space it gives a\ntraditional sphere, and in 4-D space it gives a hypersphere.\n\n![img](Images/p030_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 31. A circle is a 2-D sphere._\n\nPick a point _0_ in space near you and try to imagine a hypersphere centered\non this point, a hypersphere with a five-foot radius. What points _P_ lie on\nthe hypersphere? First of all, there are the points in your space that are\nfive feet from _0._ But moving in our space is not the only way to move away\nfrom _0._ What if one combines motion away from _0,_ as before, with a motion\n_ana_ out of our space? We might, for instance, move four feet away from _0_\nin our space, turn at right angles, and then move _ana_ three feet into\nhyperspace. (Those who remember the Pythagorean theorem, or the “distance\nformula” of analytic geometry, can check that this is true because 42 \\+ 32 =\n52.)\n\n![img](Images/p030_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 32. 2-D plus “up” is like 3-D plus “ana._ ”\n\nThe sphere of my vision now began to widen. Next I could distinctly perceive\nthe walls of the house. At first they seemed very dark and opaque; but soon\nbecame brighter, and then _transparent:_ and presently I could see the walls\nof the adjoining dwelling. These also immediately became light, and vanished,\n— melting like clouds before my advancing vision. I could now see the objects,\nthe furniture, and persons, in the adjoining house as easily as those in the\nroom where I was situated … But my perception still flowed on! The broad\nsurface of the earth, for many hundred miles, before the sweep of my vision —\ndescribing nearly a semicircle — became transparent as the purest water; and I\nsaw the brains, the viscera, and the complete anatomy of animals that were at\nthat moment sleeping or prowling about in the forests of the Eastern\nHemisphere, hundreds and even thousands of miles from the room in which I was\nmaking these observations.\n\nANDREW JACKSON DAVIS,\n\n_The Magic Staff,_ 1876\n\nWhat is interesting to notice here is that no matter which direction of our\nspace the original four-foot displacement from _0_ is taken in, the additional\nthree-foot _ana_ motion gives a point exactly five feet away from _0_. So if\nwe take all the points on a four-foot sphere around _0_ and then move _ana_\nthree feet, we will get a displaced sphere of points all belonging to the\nfive-foot hypersphere around _0._\n\nNow we can see why the full hypersphere consists of a series of spheres,\nspheres that grow smaller as one moves _ana_ or _kata_ from the space where\nthe center lies. Taken together, this family of spheres makes up a three-\ndimensional “hypersurface,” analogous to the two-dimensional surface of a\nsphere. The hypersurface of a hypersphere is a curved 3-D space located in 4-D\nspace.\n\nThis is an important concept because many scientists believe that the space of\nour universe is in fact the hypersurface of a very large hypersphere. Let’s\ntry to understand it a little better.\n\nFirst of all, shouldn’t the hypersurface of a hypersphere be _four_\n-dimensional, not _three_? Not really. Consider the surface of an ordinary 3-D\nsphere such as the planet Earth. Although the surface is certainly curved in\nthree dimensions, someone limited to the surface has only _two_ degrees of\nfreedom in moving: east/west or north/south. A Flat-lander sliding around on a\n3-D sphere’s surface still feels himself to be in a 2-D space. It’s just that\nthis space somehow curves back on itself.\n\nNow think of a little hyperfly who can move in hyperspace, but who has to stay\nexactly five feet from the point _0._ If the fly starts out five feet away\nfrom _0_ in our space then it has basically three kinds of motion open to it:\neast/west or north/south (around a five-foot sphere centered on _0_ in our\nspace) or an _ana/kata_ motion (combined with a motion toward _0_ to keep the\ndistance at five feet).\n\nWe’ll come back to the hypersphere later, but now it’s time to look at the\n_hypercube._\n\nThe hypercube, also known as the _tesseract,_ is probably the best-known 4-D\ngeometrical pattern. It arises in the following way:\n\n[PUZZLE 3.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa3)\n\n_See if you can complete this table:_\n\n![img](Images/p031_1.jpg)\n\n![img](Images/p032_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 33. From point to cube._\n\nThere wasn’t much to the machine. All great things are simple, I suppose.\nThere were three trussed beams of aluminum at right angles to each other, each\nwith a cylinder and plunger, and, from them, toggles coming together at a\npoint where there was a sort of “universal joint” topped by a mat of thick\nrubber. That was all…\n\nSo Banza stepped on the rubber mat and Bookstrom instructed him.\n\n“Move this switch one button at a time. That will always raise you a notch.\nLook around each time until you get it just right.”\n\nWith the first click Banza disappeared, just as people vanish suddenly in the\nmovies. Cladgett groaned and squirmed and then was quiet. With another click\nBanza reappeared, and in his hand was a pair of old-fashioned pince-nez\nspectacles, moist and covered with a grayish film. He held them toward\nCladgett, who grabbed them and mumbled something.\n\n“Can you imagine,” breathed Banza, “standing in the center of a sphere and\nseeing all the abdominal organs around you at once? Something like that, it\nseemed, not exactly either. There above my head were the coils of the small\nintestine. To the right was the cecum with the spectacles beside it, to my\nleft the sigmoid and the muscles attached to the ilium, and beneath my feet\nthe peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall. But I was terribly dizzy for\nsome reason; I could not stand it very long, much as I should have liked to\nremain inside of him for a while —”\n\nMILES J. BREUER,\n\n“The Appendix and the Spectacles,” 1928\n\nStart with a point and move it one unit to the right. This produces a one-\ndimensional line segment. Now move the line segment one unit down the page,\nproducing a two-dimensional square. If we move the square one unit out of the\npage we get a three-dimensional cube.\n\nNow, we can’t really fit a three-dimensional object into the two-dimensional\nconfines of this page. The standard convention, which we have used above, is\nto represent the third dimension as a direction diagonal to the first two.\nWhat if we were to use the _other_ diagonal direction as the fourth dimension?\nIf we move our image of the cube one unit in this “fourth dimension,” we get a\npicture of a four-dimensional hypercube.\n\n![img](Images/p032_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 34. The hypercube._\n\nThis figure is fun to look at … It has a certain mandala-like quality. If you\nare interested in drawing your own, note that the figure can be produced by\nconstructing a square on each of the inner edges of a regular octagon. A\nregular octagon can be obtained by tearing down a STOP sign or, preferably, by\ndividing a circle into eight equal slices.\n\nThe hypercube arises as the “trail” of a cube moving in four-dimensional\nspace. A cube arises as the “trail” of a square moving in three-dimensional\nspace. Any given cube can be generated in three different ways, depending\nwhich of three possible pairs of opposite squares are thought of as being the\n“start” and “finish” positions. The hypercube includes four pairs of cubes.\nCan you see them all?\n\n![img](Images/p033_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 35. Squares on an octagon._\n\nA different way of drawing a hypercube is based on the idea that if you hold\nthe wire skeleton of a cube close to your face, it will look like a small\nsquare inside a big square. Analogously, we can represent a hypercube by\ndrawing a small cube inside a large cube. The idea is that the small cube is\n“farther away” in the direction of the fourth dimension. Surprisingly, such a\nhypercube shape can be naturally produced by dipping a cubical framework into\nsoap solution, and then adding a bubble at the center.\n\n![img](Images/p033_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 36. A cube as a square in a square, and a hypercube as a cube in a cube.\n(Hypercube drawing from D. Hilbert and H. Cohn-Vossen,_ Geometry and the\nImagination)\n\nYet another way of representing a hypercube is by _unfolding_ one. As before,\nwe reason by analogy. If you cut some of the edges of a paper cube, you can\nflatten the cube down into a connected two-dimensional pattern of six squares.\nThis can be done in eleven essentially different ways.\n\n![img](Images/p034_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 37. The eleven ways to unfold a cube._\n\n“All right. Now listen — a tesseract has eight cubical sides, _all on the\noutside._ Now watch me. I’m going to open up this tesseract like you can open\nup a cubical pasteboard box, until it’s flat. That way you’ll be able to see\nall eight of the cubes.” Working very rapidly he constructed four cubes,\npiling one on top of the other in an unsteady tower. He then built out four\nmore cubes from the four posed faces of the second cube in the pile. The\nstructure swayed a little under the loose coupling of the clay pellets, but it\nstood, eight cubes in an inverted cross, a double cross, as the four\nadditional cubes stuck out in four directions. “Do you see it now? It rests on\nthe ground floor room, the next six cubes are the living rooms, and there is\nyour study, up at the top.”\n\nBailey regarded it with more approval than he had the other figures. “At least\nI can understand it. You say that is a tesseract, too?”\n\n“That is a tesseract unfolded in three dimensions. To put it back together you\ntuck the top cube onto the bottom cube, fold those side cubes in till they\nmeet the top cube, and there you are. You do all this folding through a fourth\ndimension of course; you don’t distort any of the cubes, or fold them into\neach other.”\n\nBailey studied the wobbly framework further. “Look here,” he said at last,\n“why don’t you forget about folding this thing up through a fourth dimension —\nyou can’t anyway — and build a house like this?”\n\nROBERT A. HEINLEIN,\n\n“And He Built a Crooked House,” 1940\n\nIf a hypercube is cut in the proper way, then it can be unfolded and\n“flattened down” into a connected three-dimensional pattern of eight cubes.\nOne unfolding of the hypercube produces a sort of three-dimensional cross.\nSalvador Dali actually uses this unfolded hypercube as a crucifix in his 1954\npainting _Christus Hypercubus._ In his classic story “And He Built a Crooked\nHouse,” Robert Heinlein describes a house built in this pattern. The twist in\nHeinlein’s story occurs when there is an earthquake and the house folds up\ninto a hypercube!\n\n![img](Images/p034_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 38. One way to unfold a hypercube._\n\nAs a last approach to the hypercube, let’s imagine a hollow stone hypercube,\nanalogous to a hollow stone prison cell. What would we see if this\nhypercubical prison was pushed through our space?\n\nWell, what would A Square see if we pushed a hollow stone cube through the\nplane of Flatland? At the beginning the whole solid stone floor would\nintersect his space, later there would be hollow stone squares made up of\ncross sections of the walls, and finally there would be the solid stone cross\nsection of the ceiling. He would see a solid square, followed by hollow\nsquares, followed by a solid square. By the same token, if we were to push a\nFlatland prison cell — a hollow stone square — through Lineland, the\nLinelanders would see a solid segment, hollow segments, and then a solid\nsegment.\n\n![img](Images/p035_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 39.

Try to figure out which sides should\nget glued to which if the thing is to be folded back up into a four-\ndimensional hypercube. Specifically, which faces get glued to the faces of the\nbottom cube_?\n\n[PUZZLE 3.5](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa5)\n\n_The volume of a cube_ S _feet on a side is given by the formula_ S3. _What do\nyou think would be the formula for the hypervolume of a hypercube_ S _feet on\na side? Specifically, what would be the hypervolume of a 2-by-2-by-2-by-2\nhypercube_?\n\nReasoning by analogy, it is not hard to see that if a hollow stone hypercube\nwere to pass through our space, we would see first a solid cube of stone, then\na series of hollow stone cubes, and finally a last solid stone cube. The eight\nsolid “boundary cubes” of the hypercube would arise as the two solid cubes\nseen at beginning and end, and as the six “trails” of the floors, walls, and\nceilings of the hollow cubes.\n\n![img](Images/p036_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 40. Escaping from a sealed room._\n\nThe hollow stone hypercube could serve as a prison cell in which a hyperbeing,\nsay an angel, could be incarcerated. Think of the room you are in as having a\nsolid stone floor, walls, and ceiling. Even an angel can’t get through that\nsolid stone. Normally, however, an angel could escape the room by moving\n_ana,_ over, and _kata._ But if your room is only a cross section of a stone\nhypercube, then when the angel moves _ana_ he finds himself not in an empty\nspace but still inside a stone-walled room. If the angel keeps moving _ana_ he\nwill run into one of the boundary cubes: a whole roomful of solid stone,\nimpossible to move beyond.\n\n![img](Images/p036_2.jpg)\n\n_From segment to tetrahedron._\n\n[PUZZLE 3.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch3pa6)\n\n_The two points at either end of a line segment have the pleasant property of\nbeing equally far way from each other. If we move into 2-D space, we can find\na third point so that now all three points are equally far away from each\nother. The three points, of course, are the vertices of an equilateral\ntriangle. In 3-D space we can go out of the triangle’s plane and get a fourth\npoint so that now all four points are the same distance from each other. These\nfour points make up the corners of a triangular pyramid, also known as a\ntetrahedron. What kind of 4-D figure do you get if you continue this procedure\nthrough one more step_?\n\n![img](Images/p037_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 41. No escape._\n\nWe have now discussed a variety of four-dimensional phenomena, but many\nreaders may still feel that something is missing. One doesn’t want only to\n_reason_ about the fourth dimension, one wants somehow to _see_ it. Most of\nwhat we have learned about the fourth dimension so far has been by using\nLineland and Flatland analogies. Although the analogies are very instructive,\nit is not unusual to have the feelings P. D. Ouspensky describes in _Tertium\nOrganum._\n\nThe method of analogies is, generally speaking, a rather tormenting thing.\nWith it, you walk in a vicious circle. It helps you to elucidate certain\nthings, and the relations of certain things, but in substance it never gives a\ndirect answer to anything. After many and long attempts to analyze higher\ndimensions by the aid of the method of analogies, you feel the uselessness of\nall your efforts; you feel that you are walking alongside of a wall. Thereupon\nyou begin to experience simply a hatred and aversion for analogies, and you\nfind it necessary to search for the direct way which leads where you need to\ngo.\n\nIn the next chapter we will look at a direct, though somewhat dangerous, path\ninto the fourth dimension.\n\n\n## 4\n\n## Through the  \nLooking Glass\n\nTHE FOURTH DIMENSION is essentially a modern idea, dating back not much\nfurther than the midnineteenth century. Although the vague notion of a higher\nworld has always been with us, the scientific concept of a geometrical fourth\ndimension was late to develop.\n\nThe first philosopher to seriously entertain the idea of higher-dimensional\nspaces was the great Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). In one of his earliest essays\nhe writes longingly of such spaces: “A science of all these possible kinds of\nspace would undoubtedly be the highest enterprise which a finite understanding\ncould undertake in the field of geometry … If it is possible that there could\nbe regions with other dimensions, it is very likely that God has somewhere\nbrought them into being.”\n\nLater in his career, Kant proposed a famous puzzle that is related to the idea\nof the fourth dimension: If all of space were empty except for a single human\nhand, would it make sense to say that the hand was specifically a _right_\nhand? As it turns out, the answer is no. The concepts of “left” and “right”\nare meaningless in an empty space.\n\nTo begin to understand why, imagine a big Plexiglas sign advertising a\npalmistry shop, a shop run by the famous fortuneteller Mom Oxo. The outline\nand wrinkles of a palm are drawn on the transparent Plexiglas. Now, if you\nlook at the sign from one side you see a right palm; if you look from the\nother you see a left palm. Once you realize that it is possible to look from\noutside the two-dimensional plane of the sign, you see that it would make no\nsense to say the palm is really a right palm.\n\n![img](Images/p039_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 42. Kant’s hand for Mom Oxo’s Palmistry._\n\nWhat can be more similar in every respect and in every part more alike to my\nhand and to my ear than their images in the mirror? And yet I cannot put such\na hand as is seen in the glass in the place of its original; for this is a\nright hand, that in the glass is a left one, and the image or reflection of\nthe right ear is a left one, which never can take the place of the other.\nThere are in this case no internal differences which our understanding could\ndetermine by thinking alone. Yet the differences are internal as the senses\nteach, for, notwithstanding their complete equality and similarity, the left\nhand cannot be enclosed in the same bounds as the right one (they are not\ncongruent); the glove of one hand cannot be used for the other. What is the\nsolution?\n\nIMMANUEL KANT,\n\n_Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics,_ 1783\n\nThe same is true of three-dimensional space. Depending which four-dimensional\n“side” you look at space from, a hand can appear to be a left or a right.\nAnother way of putting this is that a left hand can be converted into a right\nhand by lifting it into four-dimensional space and “turning it over.”\n\nLet’s dramatize this in terms of A Square. At the end of _Flatland,_ Square’s\ntrip into the third dimension ends with a big argument between him and A\nSphere. Reasoning by analogy, A Square concludes that there must be a four-\ndimensional world beyond the sphere’s 3-D space, and asks to be taken there.\nBut here, as sometimes happens, the student is seeing much further than the\nteacher has ever dared. Sphere is annoyed and finally angered by Square’s\ninsistence that there must be a four-dimensional “Thoughtland” beyond\nLineland, Flatland, and Spaceland. Yet A Square prattles on, dreaming of\nhigher and higher dimensions. Sphere loses all patience and the trip is over:\n\nMy words were cut short by a crash outside, and a simultaneous crash inside\nme, which impelled me through space with a velocity that precluded speech.\nDown! down! down! I was rapidly descending; and I knew that return to Flatland\nwas my doom. One glimpse, one last and never-to-be-forgotten glimpse I had of\nthat dull level wilderness — which was now to become my Universe again —\nspread out before my eye. Then a darkness. Then a final, all-consummating\nthunder-peal; and, when I came to myself, I was once more a common creeping\nSquare, in my Study at home, listening to the Peace-Cry of my approaching\nWife.\n\nNow of course A Square wants to tell everyone about his revelations but —\nsurprise, surprise — in Flatland it’s illegal to talk about higher dimensions.\nSquare tries to hold himself back, but finally at a meeting of the Local\nSpeculative Society,\n\nI so far forgot myself as to give an exact account of the whole of my voyage\nwith the sphere into Space … At first, indeed, I pretended that I was\ndescribing the imaginary experiences of a fictitious person but my enthusiasm\nsoon forced me to throw off all disguise, and finally, in a fervent\nperoration, I exhorted all my hearers to divest themselves of prejudice and to\nbecome believers in the Third Dimension.\n\nNeed I say that I was at once arrested and taken before the Council?\n\nA Square is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. As time goes by he\nfinds it harder and harder to think about the third dimension. Edwin Abbott’s\n_Flatland_ ends on this downbeat note, with the increasingly depressed Square\nhaving served out seven years of his sentence.\n\nNineteen eighty-four is the hundredth anniversary of _Flatland’s_ publication.\nI am delighted to report that A Square is alive and flourishing. Not only is\nhe alive, but he has consented to communicate an account of his further\nadventures. I will be quoting from my notes on _The Further Adventures of A\nSquare_ throughout the rest of this book. I will begin by quoting the first\ntwo paragraphs here, and will then proceed to some excerpts dealing with\nproblems of left and right.\n\nA full century has elapsed since last I communicated with your happy Spaceland\nrace. My health, once failing, is again robust. Far from languishing in\nprison, I am now a respected Professor of Theology. The new Chief Circle\nencourages the Masses to worship Higher Space Beings as Angels and Gods. And\nmy assistants are ever pressing forward the mathematical theory of many\nDimensions.\n\nMy special Revelation, once so arcane, now suffers, if anything, from too\ngreat a currency among the Vulgar, and from too erudite an analysis among the\nClever. Let us never lose sight of the fact that Higher Space is a royal road\nto that which is beyond all imagining. He that hath ears, let him hear.\n\nAt first I took the intruder for a fellow Square. But, feeling his Perimeter,\nI discovered something quite Irregular: he had no eye. I thought to console\nhim, and the following conversation ensued.\n\n1\\. Have they then imprisoned you for Blindness? And why in my cell?\n\n![img](Images/p041_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 43. A Cube visits A Square._\n\nSTRANGER. Lock me up? Not on your life, Square. I’m a Cube from Spaceland.\nPleased to meet you.\n\n1\\. Oh blessed Providence, can it be? But what has become of my old Mentor,\nthe Sphere?\n\nCUBE. The Sphere doesn’t care, Square. If he did he’d have rescued you long\nago. How much time have you served?\n\n1\\. You inquire regarding the length of my imprisonment thus far? Seventy\nyears, my Lord. I used, it is true, to wonder why A Sphere did not lift me up\nout of my cell. But if I escaped, the Council would only reimprison me, or\nworse.\n\nCUBE. Don’t worry. I’ve been thinking what I could do for you. Cube and\nSquare, they go together, right? My idea is that I do something to you that\n_proves_ there’s a third dimension.\n\n1\\. Your meaning is yet veiled, my Lord.\n\nCUBE. Well, check _this_ out, cousin.\n\n![img](Images/p042_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 44. A Square turns over._\n\nThe Cube lunged at me and seized my Corner in his mouth. I felt a strange\nwhirling about my center and then all was still. The Cube had vanished, and I\nwas in my cell, yet … everything was different, everything was as if seen in a\nglass. Dizzy and confused, I slept and dreamt of Lineland.\n\nIn his dream of Lineland, A Square imagines that once again he is talking to\nthe king of Lineland, a segment with a bass voice at his left end and a tenor\nvoice at his right end. Seized with a desire to really upset the king, A\nSquare reaches down into Lineland and flips the king over, rotating him around\nhis central point. The other Linelanders can hear that the king doesn’t sound\nright: he’s been turned into his own mirror image. In a frenzy, they set upon\nthe king and tear him to shreds.\n\n![img](Images/p042_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 45. The king of Lineland flips._\n\nWhen A Square wakes up the next morning, everything still looks backwards. And\nthe guard who brings breakfast takes one look at our friend and begins to\nscream. It’s really true, that crazy Cube has turned A Square over, rotating\nhim about his central axis.\n\nNormally, if a Flatlander’s eye is on his north side, then his mouth is facing\neast. But now A Square is the opposite.\n\nJust a totally flipped square.\n\n![img](Images/p043_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 46. Flatland mirror._\n\nThe Council met, pronounced A Square an “object of horror to the gods,” and\ndecided to execute him.\n\nWe’ll get back to A Square’s adventures in a while, but now let’s stop and ask\nwhat it would be like to get “turned over” in the fourth dimension. It would\nseem that a 4-D being could turn you into your own mirror image by rotating\nyou, in the fourth dimension, around a plane that cuts through your body — say\nthe plane that includes the tip of your nose, your navel, and your spine. That\none plane of your body would stay in our space. Your right half would move\n_ana,_ let us say, and your left half would move _kata._ The two halves would,\nin their parallel spaces, move past the plane of rotation, and then they would\nswing back into our space. Rotation about a plane is hard for us to imagine …\nBut just remember how hard it is for a Flatlander to think of rotation about a\nline.\n\n[PUZZLE 4.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch4pa1)\n\n_A cube that intersects a plane at right angles makes a square cross section.\nWould it be possible to place a cube so that it intersects a plane in a\ntriangular cross section_? _How_? _What other cross-sectional shapes could a\ncube show_?\n\nWhile you were in the process of rotating you would really look strange, for\nall of you that would remain in our space would be a cross section something\nlike a microtomed tissue. If you were moved up and down at right angles to our\nspace, we could see each of your cross sections in turn, and really get a good\n3-D knowledge of your inner workings.\n\n![img](Images/p044_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 47. Before and after._\n\nWhat appeared to be a thin slice from the world’s largest blood-sausage had\nappeared in the center of the scale-ship. Vernor wavered … attracted by\ncuriosity, but repelled by fear. “Is that you, Mick? You don’t look so good.”\n\nThe shape of the slice gradually changed until finally what seemed to be an\nanimated silhouette was floating in front of Vernor. It was like a thin, thin\npaper cut-out of a man, only colored all different colors … a strange,\nshifting color pattern. Suddenly Vernor realized that he was looking at an\nactual cross-section of Mick Stones. It was as if someone had, with a huge\nsharp razor, split Mick’s front half from his back half; and then shaved off\none slice to wave at Vernor.\n\nThe cross-section wavered slightly, and then Mick Stones was back in the\nscale-ship. He seemed all right except that he looked funny, crooked. He\nreached his left hand out towards Vernor reassuringly. “It’s great out —” He\nwas interrupted by a violent explosion in front of his face.\n\nVernor’s gears suddenly meshed. “Go back!” he shouted. “You’re backwards!\nYou’re made of anti-matter now!” _That_ was why Mick had looked funny; he had\nturned over in hyperspace and come back as his mirror-image. Which meant that\neach of his particles was a mirror-image particle: anti-matter.\n\nRUDY RUCKER,\n\n_Spacetime Donuts,_ 1981\n\nActually the diagnostic tool known as a CAT scan consists of a process\nsomething like this: the building up of a 3-D model of the body by looking at\na series of cross-sectional x-rays.\n\nMysterious as a four-dimensional rotation into one’s own mirror image may\nseem, it is actually possible for us to watch such a rotation taking place, as\nwe will see shortly. The method, which provides genuine insight into the\nfourth dimension, has to do with A Cube.\n\n![img](Images/p044_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 48. A Cube._\n\nA Cube, you will notice, has typically schizoid features. The right half of\nhis face, which is controlled by the analytic and sociable left brain, has a\nfriendly smile and a precise triangular eye. The left half of his face,\ncontrolled by the dark and intuitive right brain, has a lax expression and a\nwandering round eye. Clearly A Cube and A Cube’s mirror image are totally\ndifferent. A Cube has his triangle eye on the right, but\n![img](Images/p045_2.jpg) A has his triangle eye on the left.\n\n![img](Images/p045_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 49. A Cube and his mirror image._\n\nIt is to be regretted that Plattner’s aversion to the idea of postmortem\ndissection may postpone, perhaps forever, the positive proof that his entire\nbody has had its left and right sides transposed. Upon that fact mainly the\ncredibility of his story hangs. There is no way of taking a man and moving him\nabout _in space,_ as ordinary people understand space, that will result in our\nchanging his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still his right, his left\nhis left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of course. If\nyou were to cut a figure out of paper, any figure with a right and left side,\nyou could change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over. But\nwith a solid it is different. Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way\nin which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking\nthat body clean out of space as we know it — taking it out of ordinary\nexistence, that is — and turning it somewhere outside space. This is a little\nabstruse, no doubt, but anyone with a slight knowledge of mathematical theory\nwill assure the reader of its truth. To put the thing in technical language,\nthe curious inversion of Plattner’s right and left sides is proof that he has\nmoved out of our space into what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that he\nhas returned again to our world. Unless we choose to consider ourselves the\nvictims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication, we are almost bound to\nbelieve that this has occurred.\n\nH. G. WELLS,\n\n“The Plattner Story,” 1896\n\nJust as no amount of sliding around in the plane ever could have turned A\nSquare into his own mirror image, no 3-D contortions could ever turn A Cube\ninto ![img](Images/p045_2.jpg) A. But, as the mathematician August Ferdinand\nMöbius discovered in 1827, it is in fact possible to turn a 3-D object into\nits mirror image by an appropriate rotation through four-dimensional space.\n\nSurprisingly enough, it is actually possible for our minds to perform such a\nrotation. Many readers will be familiar with the “reversing cube diagram,”\nalso known as the Necker cube. If one stares at a skeleton drawing of a cube\nfor a while, the mind’s 3-D interpretation of the figure flip-flops back and\nforth between the two versions shown. If you have trouble getting the figure\nto “do” this, it might help to focus your attention near the middle of the\ndrawing and try mentally “pushing” or “pulling” at one of the corners.\n\nWhat makes the Necker cube reversal so important here is that the two possible\n3-D interpretations of the original skeleton drawing are in fact mirror images\nof each other!\n\n![img](Images/p046_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 50. The Necker cube and its two interpretations._\n\nWe can see this if we draw A Cube’s features in on the Necker cube, and\nimagine that A Cube’s body is clear as glass. If we take the features to be on\nthe side of the cube closer to us, then we are looking just at A Cube, who has\na triangle eye on his right. But if we interpret the features as being on the\nside of the cube further away from us, then we are looking at a rear view of\n![img](Images/p045_2.jpg) A, A Cube’s mirror image, who has a triangle eye on\nhis _left._ If A Cube is transparent, then the original ambiguous figure can\nbe seen as either the Cube or the Cube’s mirror image.\n\n![img](Images/p046_2.jpg)\n\n_Can Kilroy see the bug?_\n\n[PUZZLE 4.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch4pa2)\n\n_Here is a very remarkable Necker-type illusion. Can the little man see the\nbeetle or not_?\n\nThe point of this is that the sort of twinkling rearrangement that takes place\nwhen a Necker cube reverses is equivalent to a rotation through the fourth\ndimension. It happens so fast it’s hard to catch, but if you watch it for a\nwhile it begins to feel like maybe you’re getting a peek into the fourth\ndimension. The hypercube drawing, by the way, is particularly good to look at\nin terms of Necker cube reversals. Stare at it as at a mandala and the thing\nfairly seethes with activity, doing its best to get hyper.\n\n![img](Images/p047_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 51. A Cube changing into_ ![img](Images/jung1.jpg).\n\nParadise? I experienced all of that recently.\n\nParadise must consist of the stopping of pain. That means, however, that we\nlive in Paradise as long as we have no pain! And we don’t even know it.\n\nHappy and unhappy people live in the same world, and they don’t even know it!\n\nI have the feeling as if during the past months I have been walking around my\nown life in a fantastic, mysterious maze, and now I have returned precisely to\nthat spot at which I began. But, since I moved outside the normal dimensions,\nright and left somehow got exchanged. My right hand is now my left one, my\nleft hand my right one.\n\nReturned into the same world and see it now as a happy one.\n\nThe shreds of peeled paint on the door belong to a mysterious work of art.\n\nLARS GUSTAFSSON,\n\n_The Death of a Beekeeper_ , 1978\n\n![img](Images/p047_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 52. The Hypercube._\n\nAn especially dramatic version of the Necker cube can be created by folding\ntogether the Neck-A-Cube model depicted in figure 53. When it is folded, the\npaper is in the shape of ![img](Images/p047_3.jpg) A, as seen from the inside\nof his hollowed-out head. After Necker reversal pulls the corner out at you,\nit looks like A Cube should. But when you break the illusion (by opening your\nother eye, or by turning the model far enough to show its back), then the\nthing “topples” through the fourth dimension back to the hollowed-out\n![img](Images/p047_3.jpg) A form.\n\n  1. Trace figure.\n  2. Cut out around outline.\n  3. Crease line _AC_ , and then crease line _DE_. Each time crease by folding the marked surfaces together.\n  4. Slit from _A_ to _B_.\n  5. Slide one of the upper “squares” behind the other to make something like the corner of a room where walls meet ceiling. Cup the object in your right hand.\n  6. Close one eye and stare at the corner. “Pull” at the corner till Necker cube reversal takes place.\n  7. Once the object is solidly reversed, try moving your hand around.\n  8. If you have trouble getting the illusion, make sure that the model is uniformly lit (so that shadows don’t provide depth cues); and make sure to hold it still till Necker reversal has taken place.\n\n![img](Images/p048_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 53. Design for the Neck-A-Cube._\n\nOnce the cube is reversed, it seems to move in an un-natural way. If you have\nit reversed and cradle it in your hand, then it will seem to stick up in the\nair and rock in the opposite way that your hand moves. An even more remarkable\neffect is obtained if you set the cube down, or glue it to the wall, and then\nreverse it. Now, if you can manage to hold it reversed as you move your head\naround, you will see the cube apparently turning so as to always stare right\nat you!\n\n“In actual, physical life I can turn as simply and swiftly as anyone. But men-\ntally, with my eyes closed and my body immobile, I am unable to switch from\none direction to the other. Some swivel cell in my brain does not work. I can\ncheat, of course, by setting aside the mental snapshot of one vista and\nleisurely selecting the opposite view for my walk back to my starting point.\nBut if I do not cheat, some kind of atrocious obstacle, which would drive me\nmad if I persevered, prevents me from imagining the twist which transforms one\ndirection into another, directly opposite. I am crushed, I am carrying the\nwhole world on my back in the process of trying to visualize my turning around\nand making my-self see in terms of ‘right’ what I saw in terms of ‘left’ and\nvice versa.”\n\nVLADIMIR NABOKOV,\n\n_Look at the Harlequins,_ 1974\n\nI should mention here that my model is based on a similar design by jerry\nAndrus, a brilliant illusionist living in Albany, Oregon. Andrus calls his\nreversing pattern a Parabox.\n\nStaring at the Neck-A-Cube too much before bedtime can lead to really\nunpleasant dreams. Although the fourth dimension is of great theoretical and\nphilosophical interest, there is something frightening and mind-warping about\nit when it starts to get too real. I remember in particular a series of dreams\nI had in 1976, soon after I carne to understand that left and right are\nconcepts as relative as up and down, or front and back.\n\nIn these dreams I would be walking down a street with someone on either side\nof me — my wife, Sylvia, let us say, on my left, and my friend Greg on my\nright. I would move out of my body and watch the three of us from a distance,\nfirst from a point in our space, then from a point entirely outside of space.\nWhat struck me was that _depending on which half of hyperspace I looked from,_\nthe order of the three people would be Sylvia-Rudy-Greg, or Greg-Rudy-Sylvia.\nIn my dream of walking down the street, I would begin to internalize such a\nshift, and the whole city around me would change back and forth between itself\nand its own mirror image. Some mornings I would wake up convinced that I and\nthe whole universe had been replaced by our mirror images overnight. The worst\nday of all was when I sat up in bed and actually saw the reversal taking\nplace: the whole room, furniture and all, rambunctiously do-si-do-ing about\ninto mirror reversal. But, of course, I couldn’t prove anything … I’d turned\nover, too.\n\n[PUZZLE 4.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch4pa3)\n\n_Looking at a Necker cube can help us to think about the fourth dimension. Can\nyou think of a “Flatland Necker Illusion” that A Square could use to help\nthink of the third dimension!_\n\nAfter these experiences I often wondered if there could be any objective fact\ncorrelated to a person’s feeling that the world has turned into its mirror\nimage. One possible idea that carne to mind was that a person might have a 4-D\ncomponent of mind that projects out of the brain and into hyperspace. If this\n“hyperbrain” material were to shift from being primarily on, let us say, the\n_ana_ side to being primarily on the _kata_ side, then one would be justified\nin saying that the world has changed — in the same way that the palm drawn in\nfigure 42 changes when an observer moves from one side to the other.\n\nSometimes I get so confused about left and right that all I’m really sure\nabout is what is next to what. I get this feeling if I go to England … or just\nwatch an English movie … where everyone drives on the left side of the road. A\nvery commonplace instance of left-right confusion arises if you happen to\nstudy your teeth in the mirror while feeling them with your tongue. Left and\nright can get hopelessly mixed up in short order. Charles Hinton, whom we will\ntalk about in the next chapter, felt that deliberately inducing such a\nconfusion about left and right was the best path to four-dimensional thought.\n\n\n## 5\n\n##  Ghosts from  \nHyperspace?\n\nSPIRITUALISM — the belief that spirits of the dead are nearby and eager to\ncontact us — has never been so popular as in the late nineteenth century.\nThroughout the United States, England, and Europe, amateur or professional\nmediums were organizing séances. A group of people would sit around a table in\na darkened room, the medium would moan and mutter, and then the spirits would\nmanifest themselves.\n\nAnd what would said spirits do? They would make noises: sharp raps on the\ntable. They would move things: turning or rocking the table and, occasionally,\neven lifting the table up into the air. They would send messages: often by\ncausing a piece of pencil to scratch some words on a slate held under the\ntable. They would materialize as white fogs, or sometimes as spirit hands that\nwould reach up over the table’s edge.\n\nSpiritualism mediums were, of course, under heavy suspicion of fraud from the\nvery beginning. People are so eager to believe in life after death that their\nreports of what they experience at a séance are not very reliable. No\naccumulation of colorful anecdotes can ever take the place of a really\nscientific investigation. The few scientists who believed in spiritualism\nbegan trying to find some kind of solid theory to support their belief in\nghosts.\n\nQuite abstractly, there seem to be two possibilities if spirits exist. Either\nthey are in our space, but very insubstantial, or they are somehow out side\nour space altogether. The idea of spirits as tenuous forms in our space was\npopular with some early spiritualists: they held that the spirits were made of\n“ectoplasm” or, even less concretely, of “vibrational energy.” One difficulty\nhere was that if the spirits were so very insubstantial, how could they do\nthings like lifting a heavy séance table?\n\n![img](Images/p052_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 54. Occult forces._\n\n(1) Physically, the souls of the dead come into the thraldom of certain living\nbeings who are called mediums. These mediums are, for the present at least, a\nnot widely diffused class, and they appear to be almost exclusively Americans.\nAt the command of these mediums, departed souls perform mechanical feats which\npossess throughout the character of absolute aimlessness. They rap, they lift\ntables and chairs, they move beds, they play on the harmonica, and do other\nsimilar things. (2) Intellectually, the souls of the dead enter a condition\nwhich, if we are to judge from the productions which they deposit on the\nslates of the mediums, must be termed a very lamentable one. These slate-\nwritings belong throughout in the category of imbecility; they are totally\nbereft of any contents. (3) The most favored, apparently, is the moral\ncondition of the soul. According to the testimony which we have, its character\ncannot be said to be anything else than that of harmlessness. From brutal\nperformances, such, for instance, as the destruction of bed-canopies, the\nspirits most politely refrain.\n\nWILHELM WUNDT,\n\n“Spiritualism, A Question of Science So-Called,” 1889\n\nNo such difficulty arises if we think of spirits as solid and substantial\nbeings, but here of course we have the question of why one doesn’t notice\nspirits very often if they really are so solid. The answer to this is to\nassert that the home of spirits is somehow outside our space entirely. How\nbest to have spirits live outside space? One could have them be infinitely far\naway, but then one would have the problem of how they can get here so rapidly\nwhen summoned up by a medium. A much more satisfactory explanation is to say\nthat _spirits live in the fourth dimension._\n\nThe beauty of this idea is that the spirits are wholly outside of our normal,\nmaterial space yet they are … at the same time … right next to us, waiting\njust a few feet _ana_ or _kata._ Although the idea of spirits as 4-D beings\nhad its greatest popularity in the nineteenth century, it had been hinted at\nsome two hundred years before, by the Cambridge Platonist Henry More\n(1614-1687). Like the scientific spiritualists, More was opposed to the idea\nthat spirits, angels, and Platonic forms could exist as insubstantial\nabstractions. He felt that if spirits really exist, then they must actually\n_take up space._ Yet, if a person’s soul takes up space, we have the question\nof how it can fit into the person’s solid physical body. In 1671, More carne\nup with the suggestion that spirits should be four-dimensional. He phrased\nthis in terms of an occult quality he called _spissitude,_ meaning something\nlike “denseness of substance.” His idea seems to have been that the\ndifferences between the physically identical bodies of a dead person and a\nliving person would be that the living body has more spissitude, and that\nspissitude is physically unobservable because it corresponds to a certain\nhyperthickness in the direction of the fourth dimension.\n\n![img](Images/p053_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 55. Body and soul._\n\nThe person who really popularized the spiritualist notion of ghosts from the\nfourth dimension was Johann Carl Friederich Zöllner (1834-1882). Zöllner was a\nprofessor of astronomy at the University of Leipzig, the same university where\nAugust Möbius made his 1827 discovery that it would be possible to turn a 3-D\nobject into its mirror image by a hyperspace rotation, and the same university\nwhere Gustav Fechner wrote his 1846 essay “Why Space Has Four Dimensions.”\nZöllner got his interest in spiritualism from an 1875 trip to England, where\nhe visited William Crookes, inventor of the cathode-ray tube.\n\nCrookes was very committed to spiritualism, and was the champion of the\nAmerican medium Henry Slade. When Slade’s stay in England ended in arrest and\nconviction for fraud, the medium went to visit Zöllner, who was eagerly\nwaiting for someone to help him prove that spirits are four-dimensional.\nAccording to Zöllner’s _Transcendental Physics_ of 1878, the experiments were\nan immediate success.\n\nThe first thing Slade did was to tie four simple overhand knots in a string\nZöllner provided. What made this feat so striking was that the string was\noriginally unknotted, with its ends joined together by a glob of sealing wax\nimpressed with Zöllner’s own seal. Of course, in reality Slade undoubtedly\nmanaged to switch the strings, but if he had not cheated, his trick would have\nbeen genuinely four-dimensional.\n\nWhy? Well, if a spirit could move a little segment of the string _ana_ out of\nour space, then it would be, for all practical purposes, like having a gap in\nthe string so that one could move it “through” itself to get a knot. Once the\nstring is in the proper position, you move the displaced segment back _kata_\nto our space and you’ve tied a knot without moving the ends of the string.\n\nThat’s one way to do it. An easier way is to tie the knot first and then seal\nthe ends together. In and of itself, a knotted string with its ends sealed\ntogether does not immediately make one believe that the knot was tied by a\nfour-dimensional spirit. Zöllner was of course aware of this, and he designed\nseveral interesting tests by which Slade’s spirit friends could have\nestablished lasting proof of their four-dimensionality. Three of the tests are\ndescribed in _Transcendental Physics:_\n\n![img](Images/p054_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 56. Zöllner’s string, before and after._\n\n1\\. Two wooden rings, one of oak, the other of alderwood, were each turned\nfrom one piece … Could these two rings be interlinked without breaking, the\ntest would be additionally convincing by close microscopic examination of the\nunbroken continuity of the fibre. Two different kinds of wood being chosen,\nthe possibility of cutting both rings from the same piece is likewise\nexcluded. Two such interlinked rings would consequently in themselves\nrepresent a “miracle,” that is, a phenomenon which our conceptions heretofore\nof physical and organic processes would be absolutely incompetent to explain.\n\n2\\. Since among products of nature, the disposition of whose parts is\naccording to a particular direction, as with snail-shells twisted right or\nleft, this disposition can be reversed by a four-dimensional twisting of the\nobject, I had provided myself with a large number of such shells, of different\nspecies, and at least two of each kind.\n\n3\\. From a dried gut, such as is used in twine-factories, a band without ends\nwas cut. Should a knot be tied in this band, close microscopic examination\nwould also reveal whether the connection of the parts of this strip had been\nsevered or not.\n\nSo the idea was that Slade’s spirits should link the two wood rings, turn some\nsnail shells into their mirror-image forms, and produce a knot in a closed\nloop of skin cut from a pig’s bladder. Did it work?\n\n![img](Images/p055_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 57. Evidence of 4-D ghosts? (Engraving from J. C. F. Zöllner,_\nTranscendental Physics.)\n\nSeldom happens just that which we, according to the measure of our limited\nunderstanding, wish; but if, looking back on the course of some years, we\nregard what has actually come to pass, we recognize gratefully the\nintellectual superiority of that Hand which, according to a sensible plan,\nconducts our fates to the true welfare of our moral nature, and shapes our\nlife dramatically to a harmonic whole.\n\nIn other words, no. Instead of doing what Zöllner had wanted, the spirits put\nthe rings around a table leg, moved a snail shell from the tabletop to the\nfloor beneath the table, and burned a spot on the bladder band.\n\nVery few scientists were convinced by Zöllner’s experiments. Although Zöllner\nhimself may well have been an honest man, he was almost unbelievably gullible\n— an unworldly scientist easily taken in by a professional charlatan like\nSlade. One might think that now, a century later, scientists could no longer\nbe fooled by cheap conjuring tricks, but this does not seem to be the case.\nJust a few years ago, Uri Geller — who is almost certainly a fraud — was able\nto obtain the backing and endorsement of a number of physicists at the\nStanford Research Institute. A glance at any supermarket tabloid makes it\nclear that the public’s interest in ghosts is greater than it has ever been.\n\n![img](Images/p055_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 58. Where the balls went in_ Poltergeist.\n\nMost modern ghost tales do not bring in the fourth dimension. An interesting\nexception is Steven Spielberg’s movie _Poltergeist._ The 4-D aspect of this\nmovie arises when balls that are thrown into the closet of one room appear\nfrom the ceiling of another room … indicating a route through the fourth\ndimension!\n\nThere have always been mysterious phenomena, and there always will be. Yet, as\nwe have often seen that the progress of science has again and again revealed\nas natural what former generations held to be supernatural, it is certainly\nwholly wrong to bring in for the explanation of phenomena which now seem\nmysterious an hypothesis like that of Zöllner, by which everything in the\nworld can be explained. If we adopt a point of view which regards it as\nnatural for spirits arbitrarily to interfere in the workings of the world, all\nscientific investigation will cease, for we could never more trust or rely\nupon any chemical or physical experiment, or any botanical or zoological\nculture. If the spirits are the authors of the phenomena that are mysterious\nto us, why should they also not have control of the phenomena which are not\nmysterious? The existence of mysterious phenomena justifies in no manner or\nform the assumption that spirits exist which produce them. Would it not be\nmuch simpler, if we _must_ have supernatural influences, to adopt the naive\nreligious point of view, according to which everything that happens is\ntraceable to the direct, actual, and personal interference of a single being\nwhich we call God?\n\nHERMANN SCHUBERT,\n\n“The Fourth Dimension,” 1898\n\nThe main effect of Zöllner’s work was that the fourth dimension began to seem\ndisreputable and unscientific. Yet his basic message, _spirits live in the\nfourth dimension,_ did not fall on totally deaf ears. The notion of beings\nliving in an unseen hyperspace world was taken up by turn-of-the-century\nProtestant clergymen all over England.\n\nThe best known of these clergymen is, of course, Edwin Abbott, but there were\nmany others who enthusiastically adopted the notion that heaven, hell, our\nsouls, the angels, and God himself could be comfortably lodged in some higher\ndimension. The basic credo of these Christian spiritualists can be found in A.\nT. Schofield’s 1888 book, _Another World:_\n\nWe conclude, therefore, that a higher world than ours is not only conceivably\npossible, but probable; secondly, that such a world may be considered as a\nworld of four dimensions; and thirdly, that the spiritual world agrees largely\nin its mysterious laws, in its language which is foolishness to us, in its\nmiraculous appearances and interpositions, in its high and lofty claims of\nomniscience, omnividence, etc., and in other particulars, with what by analogy\nwould be the laws, language, and claims of a fourth dimension …\n\nThough the glorious material universe extends beyond the utmost limits of our\nvision, even artificially aided by the most powerful telescopes, that does not\nprevent the spiritual world and its beings, and heaven and hell being by our\nvery side.\n\n![img](Images/p056_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 59. “Aided by the most powerful telescopes.”_\n\nFar from these spiritual regions occupying some small corner of the material\nuniverse, as surely as the greater includes the less, so surely is the\nmaterial universe, vast as it is, swallowed up in the spiritual.\n\n![img](Images/p057_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 60. God the Father_?\n\nTo a sophisticated thinker, there is something just a little too crude and\nmaterialistic about having souls and angels and God be literal chunks of\nhypermatter in four-dimensional space. Why precisely _four_?. If any kind of\nhigher-space view of higher reality is reasonable, I would think it to be the\nnotion that our souls are patterns _infinite_ -dimensional Hilbert space. A\nsecond objection to the idea of spirits and angels swarming about our space is\nthe feeling that, at higher levels, the whole concept of separately acting\nindividuals might well fall away.\n\nLet me illustrate this last thought with a Flatland picture, figure 61.\n\n![img](Images/p057_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 61. The One and the Many._\n\nWhat seems to be a collection of many individuals may turn out, at some higher\nlevel, to just be parts of one higher entity. There is something lacking in a\nworld view that leaves out the notion of higher unity and has diverse spirits\npoking at our world like pool sharks at a game of eight ball.\n\nAnother failing in spiritualism, Christian or not, is the reliance on\nanecdotes about miracles and psychic feats. If higher dimensions have any real\nmeaning for us, that meaning should be part of our ordinary life. I don’t\nbelieve in miracles; I don’t disbelieve in them. The whole subject just leaves\nme cold. You can walk on water? You can bend spoons? So what. You’ve proved\nthat nobody really walks on water? You’ve proved that nobody really bends\nspoons? I couldn’t care less. What I want to know is much simpler: _What is it\nlike to be alive_?\n\n![img](Images/p058_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 62. Bend that spoon._\n\n“We live in a three-dimensional space” is really quite a complex statement,\nand not a statement that every person would automatically think of as true.\nExplaining to someone why it is that space is three-dimensional really\ninvolves convincing them that they should think of the world around them in a\ncertain way. Imagine an alien culture whose architecture is not based on\ncubes. Without the inevitable three perpendicular lines in each corner of\none’s room, the notion of reducing all experiences to the oscillations of a\nthree-knobbed Etch-A-Sketch might seem a bit strange. What about feelings,\nwhat about levels of thought, what about dreams?\n\nWhat I am trying to suggest here is that perhaps we ourselves are, in some\nvery real sense, beings of more than three  dimensions. P. D. Ouspensky wrote\nsomething very interesting about this in his 1908 essay ’The Fourth\ndimension.”\n\nThe music faded into silence as the grotto became completely dark except for\nthe brilliantly illuminated front wall. The shadow of the minister rose before\nus. After announcing the text as Ephesians, [Chapter 3](11_Chapter3.html),\nverses 17 and 18, he began to read in low, resonant tones that seemed to come\ndirectly from the shadow’s head: “… that ye, being rooted and grounded in\nlove, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and\nlength, and depth, and height …”\n\nIt was too dark for note-taking, but the following paragraphs summarize\naccurately, I think, the burden of Slade’s remarkable sermon.\n\nOur cosmos — the world we see, hear, feel — is the three-dimensional “surface”\nof a vast, four-dimensional sea …\n\nWhat lies outside the sea’s surface? The wholly other world of God! No longer\nis theology embarrassed by the contradiction between God’s immanence and\ntranscendence. Hyperspace touches every point of three-space. God is closer to\nus than our breathing. He can see every portion of our world, touch every\nparticle without moving a finger through our space. Yet the Kingdom of God is\ncompletely “outside” of three-space, in a direction in which we cannot even\npoint.\n\nMARTIN GARDNER,\n\n“The Church of the Fourth dimension,” 1962\n\nton outlines in detail his system\n\nIf the fourth dimension exists, one of two things is possible. Either we\nourselves possess the fourth dimension, i.e., are beings of four dimensions,\nor we possess only three dimensions and in that case do not exist at all.\n\nIf the fourth dimension exists while we possess only three, it means that we\nhave no real existence, that we exist only in somebody’s imagination and that\nall our thoughts, feelings and experiences take place in the mind of some\nother higher being, who visualizes us. We are but products of his mind, and\nthe whole of our universe is but an artificial world created by his fantasy.\n\nIf we do not want to agree with this we must recognize ourselves as beings of\nfour dimensions.\n\nDo we not in sleep live in a fantastic fairy kingdom where everything is\ncapable of transformation, where there is no stability belonging to the\nphysical world, where one man can become another or two men at the same time,\nwhere the most improbable things look simple and natural, where events often\noccur in inverse order, from end to beginning, where we see the symbolical\nimages of ideas and moods, where we talk with the dead, fly in the air, pass\nthrough walls, are drowned or burnt, die and remain alive?\n\nAll this taken together shows us that we have no need to think that the\nspirits that appear or fail to appear at spiritualistic séances must be the\nonly possible beings of four dimensions. We may have very good reason for\nsaying that we are ourselves beings of four dimensions and we are turned\ntowards the third dimension with only one of our sides, i.e., with only a\nsmall part of our being. Only this part of us lives in three dimensions, and\nwe are conscious only of this part as our body. The greater part of our being\nlives in the fourth dimension, but we are unconscious of this greater part of\nourselves. Or it would be still more true to say that we live in a four-\ndimensional world, but are conscious of ourselves only in a three-dimensional\nworld. This means that we live in one kind of condition, but imagine ourselves\nto be in another.\n\nFor Ouspensky, the fourth dimension was not only a spatial concept but a type\nof consciousness, an awareness of greater complexities and higher unities. For\nhim, the mathematical study of the fourth dimension led quite naturally to a\nbelief in the teachings of mysticism. In their simplest form, these teachings\nare but two: _All is One_ and _The One is Unknowable._\n\n![img](Images/p060_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 63. All is One._\n\nWhat, you may ask, do these two high-sounding precepts have to do with the\nfourth dimension? Quite briefly, the first idea is that higher space can be\nviewed as a background of connective tissue tying together the world’s diverse\nphenomena. If one moves toward higher and higher conceptions of space, one is\ntending toward some ideal “Superspace” in which everything — near and far,\npast and future, big and small, real and imagined — is together in some great\nUnity.\n\nIn his 1885 essay “Many Dimensions” the great hyper-space philosopher Charles\nH. Hinton speaks very clearly and colorfully about his identification of the\nabstract idea of “space” with the “One” of mysticism:\n\nYet with them [the Eastern mystics] I feel an inward sympathy, for I too, as\nthey, have an inward communion and delight, with a source lying above all\npoints and turns and proofs — an inward companion, whose presence in my mind\nfor one half-hour is worth more to me than all the cosmogonies that I have\never heard of, and of which all the thoughts I have ever thought are but\nminutest fragments, mixed up with ignorance and error. What their [the\nmystics’] secret is I know not, mine is humble enough — the inward\napprehension of space.\n\nAnd I have often thought, travelling by railway, when between the dark\nunderground stations the lads and errand boys bend over the scraps of badly\nprinted paper, reading fearful tales — I have often thought how much better it\nwould be if they were doing that which I may call “communing with space.”\n’Twould be of infinite delight, romance, and interest; far more than are those\ncreased tawdry papers, with no form in them-selves or in their contents.\n\nAnd yet, looking at the same printed papers, being curious, and looking deeper\nand deeper into them with a microscope, I have seen that in splodgy ink stroke\nand dull fibrous texture, each part was definite, exact, absolutely so far and\nno farther, punctiliously correct; and deeper and deeper lying a wealth of\nform, a rich variety and amplitude of shapes, that in a moment leapt higher\nthan my wildest dreams could conceive.\n\nAnd then I have felt as one would do if the dark waters of a manufacturing\ntown were suddenly to part, and from them, in them, and through them, were to\nuprise Aphrodite, radiant, undimmed, flashing her way to the blue beyond the\nsmoke; for there, in these crabbed marks and crumpled paper, there, if you but\nlook, is space herself, in all her infinite determinations of form.\n\nSo for Hinton, space itself is the medium by which one is to grasp the world’s\nunity. And what of the second teaching of mysticism, _The One is Unknowable_?\nHere we must be clear on the sense in which the word “know” is to be used.\nMystically speaking, the One _is_ knowable, knowable in the sense that we can\nfeel space around us, knowable in the sense that we can open our hearts to\nfeel life and beauty and love. It is only for the _rational_ mind that the One\nis un-knowable.\n\n![img](Images/p061_1.jpg)\n\n _Fig. 64. The One is Unknowable._\n\nNo finite string of human symbols can really represent the ultimate reality:\ncall it God, the One, the Absolute, Everything, or what you will. The\nsituation here is a bit analogous to trying to understand an infinite set such\nas the set _N_ of all whole numbers (1, 2, 3, …). Given the idea of number, we\ndo have a pretty good understanding of what _N_ is — this higher understanding\nis to be likened to the mystical knowing of the One. But if we insist on a\ncomplete, explicit listing of members, then the set _N_ will always lie beyond\nour grasp — this is comparable to the rational mind’s inability to fully grasp\nthe One.\n\nIn the following long excerpt (also from “Many Dimensions”), Hinton makes\nclear the sense in which space is, at the deepest level, to be known by the\nheart and not by the brain.\n\nAnd, indeed, space is wonderful. We all know that space is infinite in\nmagnitude — stretching on endlessly.\n\nAnd when we look quietly at space, she shows us at once that she has infinite\ndimensions.\n\nAnd yet, both in magnitudes and dimensions there is something artificial.\n\nTo measure, we must begin somewhere, but in space there is no “somewhere”\nmarked out for us to begin at. This measuring is something, after all, foreign\nto space, introduced by us for our convenience.\n\nAnd as to dimensions, in order to enumerate and realize the different\ndimensions, we must fix on a particular line to begin with, and then draw\nother lines at right angles to this one.\n\nBut the first straight line we take can be drawn in an infinite number of\ndirections. Why should we take any particular one?\n\nIf we take any particular line, we do something arbitrary, of our own will and\ndecision, not given to us naturally by space.\n\nNo wonder then if we take such a course we are committed to an endless task.\n\nWe feel that all these efforts, necessary as they are to us to apprehend\nspace, have nothing to do with space herself. We introduce something of our\nown, and are lost in the complexities which this brings about.\n\nMay we not compare ourselves to those Egyptian priests who, worshipping a\nveiled divinity, laid on her and wrapped her about with ever richer garments,\nand decked her with fairer raiment.\n\nSo we wrap around space our garments of magnitude and vesture of many\ndimensions.\n\nTill suddenly, to us as to them, as with a forward tilt of the shoulders, the\ndivinity moves, and the raiment and robes fall to the ground, leaving the\ndivinity herself, revealed, but invisible; not seen, but somehow felt to be\nthere.\n\nAnd these are not empty words. For the one space which is not this form or\nthat form, not this figure or that figure, but which is to be known by us\nwhenever we regard the least details of the visible world — this space can be\napprehended. It is not the shapes and things we know, but space is to be\napprehended in them.\n\n![img](Images/p063_1.jpg)\n\n _Fig. 65. “The least details of the visible world.”_\n\nThe true apprehension and worship of space lies in the grasp of varied details\nof shape and form, all of which, in their exactness and precision, pass into\nthe one great apprehension.\n\nAnd we must remember that this apprehension does not lie in the talking about\nit. It cannot be conveyed in description.\n\nWe must beware of the attitude of standing openmouthed just because there is\nso much mechanics which we do not understand, but geometry and mathematics\nonly spring up there where we, in our imperfect way, introducing our own\nlimitations, tend towards the knowledge of inscrutable nature.\n\nIf we want to pass on and on till magnitude and dimensions disappear, is it\nnot done for us already? That reality where magnitude and dimensions are not,\nis simple and about us. For passing thus on and on we lose ourselves, but find\nthe clue again in the apprehension of the simplest acts of human goodness, in\nthe most rudimentary recognition of another human soul wherein is neither\nmagnitude nor dimension, and yet all is real.\n\n![img](Images/p063_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 66. “The simplest acts of human goodness.”_\n\nThe author of this strange yet compelling passage led — in the context of his\ntime — an equally strange life.\n\nCharles Howard Hinton, known to his family as Howard, was born in London in\n1853. His father, James, was a well-known author who over the course of his\nlife moved from being an ear surgeon to a religious philosopher to the\nchampion of a new sexual morality. In his declining years, James Hinton\nmanaged to surround himself with a circle of admiring women, most of whom were\nsexually intimate with him. One of his sayings was, “Christ was the Saviour of\nmen, but I am the saviour of women, and I don’t envy Him a bit!”\n\nHoward obtained his B.A. from Oxford in 1877, and soon after he married Mary\nBoole, daughter of the famous logician who invented “Boolean algebra.” In 1880\nHinton obtained a post as science master at the Uppingham School, meanwhile\ncontinuing work for a master’s degree in mathematics.\n\nDespite all of his education, Hinton felt somehow adrift, as if he could not\nget hold of any really concrete knowledge. For who knows what reason, he hit\non the idea of memorizing a cubic yard of one-inch cubes. That is, he took a\n36-by-36-by-36 block of cubes, assigned a two-word Latin name (for example,\n_Glans Frenum_) to each of the 46,656 units, and learned to use this network\nas a sort of “solid paper.” Thus, when he wished to visualize some solid\nstructure, he would do so by adjusting its size so that it fit into his cubic\nyard. Then he could describe the structure by reviewing the list of occupied\ncells. (Although this sounds incredible, it is not really impossible — Hinton\nhad a system that reduces the number of brute facts to 216.)\n\nAs it turned out, this seemingly insane idea was a fantastic source of\ninspiration for Hinton. For what he had in effect done was to create within\nhis mind the kind of “three-dimensional retina” that a 4-D being would have\n(as we discussed in [chapter 3](11_Chapter3.html)). Some mysterious\ninspiration drove Hinton forward on the correct path, and he next had the idea\nof learning his block of cubes in each of its twenty-four possible\norientations (six choices for the bottom face times four choices for the front\nface).\n\nThe result of this was that Hinton was now able to take a 3-D object and see\nits parts simply in terms of what is next to what, thus freeing himself from\nour spacebound concepts of front-back and up-down. Shortly after this, he took\nthe final step and let the concept of left-right fall away, thus arriving at a\nperfectly four-dimensional view of the world (as we discussed in [chapter\n4](12_Chapter4.html)). Now Hinton could, without difficulty, visualize all the\ncross sections of a hypercube, undisturbed by the way in which these cross\nsections can become their own mirror images depending on where the hypercube\nlies relative to our space.\n\nAs his understanding of the fourth dimension grew, Hinton set to writing about\nit. His first published essay, “What Is the Fourth dimension?,” appeared in\n1880 in the _Dublin University Magazine,_ was reprinted in the _Cheltenham\nLadies’ College Magazine_ of September 1883, and finally was released as a\npamphlet, with the crassly commercial subtitle “Ghosts Explained,” by Swann\nSonnenschein & Co. in 1884. In the period 1884-1896, Swann Sonnenschein\npublished nine pamphlets by Hinton, which were then collected in the two-\nvolume set _Scientific Romances._ Some of the pieces were essays on the fourth\ndimension, and some were what we would now call science fiction stories.\n\n![img](Images/p065_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 67. Hinton was a bigamist._\n\nHinton might have settled into a comfortable life like his father’s: the life\nof a writer respected by intellectuals and loved by many women. But in 1885\ndisaster struck. Charles Howard Hinton was arrested for bigamously marrying a\nwoman called Maude Weldon, with whom he had spent a week in King’s Cross\nHotel, and by whom he was the father of twins. The headmaster at Uppingham\nhad, till this time, been under the impression that Maude Weldon was Hinton’s\nsister — apparently she was a regular guest of Howard and his legitimate wife,\nMary. Of course, he lost his job. His career was ruined. When he carne up for\nsentencing in 1886 the magistrate let him off with a token three days in jail.\nSoon after this, Howard, Mary, and their children fled to a teaching post at a\nmiddle school in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nThe torment Hinton must have undergone during this period shows in two of his\n“Scientific Romances\": “Stella” and “An Unfinished Communication.” “Stella”\ntells of a girl whose guardian has made her invisible, so that she will not\nfall into the traps of vanity and physical love. Yet Stella does find a lover,\na man who forces her to wear clothes and make-up so that all can see her. It\nis easy to imagine that Maude Weldon is the model for Stella.\n\n“An Unfinished Communication” is a very strange story indeed. It tells of a\ndesperate man who seeks the services of an Unlearner, a man who can make him\nforget his horrible past. The Unlearner stresses the importance of living\nopenly and sharing one’s secrets, something Hinton must have been frantic to\ndo as he sank deeper and deeper into the morass created by his attempts to\nlive out his father’s free-love philosophy.\n\n![img](Images/p066_1.jpg)\n\n_A knot._\n\n**[PUZZLE 5.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch5pa1)**\n\n_A line or string can only be knotted in 3-D space: no string can be knotted\nin 2-D space, and no knot will stay tied in 4-D space. Why not? In 4-D space\nit is possible to knot a plane. Can you imagine how_?\n\nWhen Hinton left for Japan, he left a manuscript in the hands of two friends.\nThis book, _A New Era of Thought,_ appeared in 1888. Here Hinton outlines in\ndetail his system for learning to think four-dimensionally by manipulating a\nset of eighty-one colored cubes, cubes that are to stand for the eighty-one\nparts of a 3-by-3-by-3-by-3 hypercube. Hinton is at his most confident here,\nand he asserts that “the particular problem, at which I have worked for more\nthan ten years, has been completely solved. It is possible for the mind to\nacquire a conception of higher space as adequate as that of our three-\ndimensional space, and to use it in the same manner.”\n\nIn _A New Era of Thought_ Hinton also explains _why_ it should be possible for\nus to form 4-D thoughts. People sometimes feel that since our brains are made\nup of 3-D nets of neurons it is futile to hope to model 4-D patterns in our\nbrains. But, replies Hinton, is it not possible that our space has some slight\n4-D hyperthickness? If this is indeed the case, then the small bits of matter\nthat code up our thoughts may be free to form actual 4-D patterns, and 4-D\nthought is easily achieved.\n\n![img](Images/p067_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 68. Thick Square with mental image of A Cube._\n\nAlthough on account of his enthusiasm for metageometry he was never a great\nsuccess as an instructor in his college positions, he made many friends, and\nin Princeton endeared himself to the students by one of the most successful\npractical jokes ever perpetrated there. This was just after his perfection of\nthe baseball gun. He invited the faculty and students to a lecture at which he\ndemonstrated the machine and described its scientific theory. While he was\nupon the platform the lecture was interrupted by the arrival of a special\ndelivery postman who walked down the aisle and called to the professor. As he\nhad been the victim of many practical jokes and “horsed” by the students\naccording to the Princeton custom, the audience prepared for some absurd\ndiversion. After protesting against the interruption, but not being able to\nsend away the messenger, Prof. Hinton begged permission to look at a letter\nimportant enough to demand consideration at such a time. He read aloud, and\nhad turned two pages, reading an account of a baseball game in the year\n_1950,_ before the students discovered that the joke was upon them.\n\nGELETT BURGESS,\n\n“The Late Charles H. Hinton,” 1907\n\nIt was at one time possible to purchase sets of Hinton cubes from his\npublisher. I once made myself a set of them, and was somewhat disappointed.\nPlaying with the colored cubes may not really be the best way to start\nthinking four-dimensionally.\n\nEighteen ninety-three found Howard Hinton at Princeton University, as an\ninstructor in the Mathematics Department. Oddly enough, Hinton devoted most of\nhis energies while at Princeton to the invention of a “baseball gun.” The\npoint of having such a gun was that during the week’s practice sessions the\nPrinceton team could practice hitting really fast balls — without the pitchers\nhaving to wear out their arms. The gun could shoot a baseball at speeds of up\nto seventy miles per hour, and two rubber-coated steel fingers attached to the\nmuzzle made it possible to shoot curves as well.\n\nHinton was fired before long, and found his next job at the University of\nMinnesota. In 1900 he left Minnesota for Washington, D.C., where he worked\nfirst at the Naval Observatory and then at the Patent Office. His faithful\nwife Mary followed Howard through all these peregrinations, bearing him four\nsons. She was known in Washington as a lecturer on poetry.\n\nHinton died suddenly and dramatically at the age of fifty-four, in 1907. A\ncontemporary news article on his death, headlined SCIENTIST DROPS DEAD,\ndescribes how Hinton fell dead after complying with the toastmaster’s request\nfor a toast to “female philosophers,” at the annual banquet of the Washington,\nD.C., Society of Philanthropic Inquiry.\n\nCharles Howard Hinton lived a wild and varied life. I would like to think that\nwhat sustained him through it all was that mystical vision of space he enjoyed\nas a young man.\n\nI hope that by now most readers will have some feeling for the fourth\ndimension as a concept interesting in its own right. In [parts\nII](14_Part2.html) and [III](18_Part3.html) of this book we will proceed to\nsee how the fourth dimension can be used to understand the true nature of\nspace, matter, time, and mind.\n\n\n## Part II\n\n## SPACE\n\n\n## 6\n\n## What We’re Made Of\n\nWE ARE ACCUSTOMED to thinking of the world as made up of lumps of matter\nfloating in empty space. Matter is something, and space is nothing. But is\nthis really correct? In the past, many powerful thinkers have held that the\nspace between visible objects is filled with a subtler material, a smooth and\ncontinuous substance, a “universal plenum,” or _aether._\n\nOne does not hear much about the aether these days. But in the nineteenth\ncentury the concept was as commonplace as “fields” are now. In his article on\naether for the ninth edition of the _Encyclopaedia Britannica,_ James Clerk\nMaxwell (1831-1879), founder of the modern theory of electromagnetism, wrote:\n\nWhatever difficulties we may have in forming a consistent idea of the\nconstitution of the aether, there can be no doubt that the interplanetary and\ninterstellar spaces are not empty, but are occupied by a material substance or\nbody, which is certainly the largest, and probably the most uniform body of\nwhich we have any knowledge.\n\nBut why bother filling space up with aether? What’s wrong with having space\njust be the empty background against which matter moves? One problem is that\nif space is really empty, then it’s hard to understand how gravitational force\ncan be transmitted. Isaac Newton set up his famous law of gravity as a\nquantitative description of the gravitational force, but he was keenly aware\nthat he lacked any understanding of how this force could act across the empty\ndistance of space. Writing in the late seventeenth century, Newton complains:\n\n![img](Images/p072_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 69. How do we send signals through the void_?\n\nWe have supposed in the case of a plane world that the surface on which the\nmovements take place is inactive, except by its vibrations. It is simply a\nsmooth support.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity let us call this smooth surface “the aether” in the\ncase of a plane world.\n\nThe aether that we have imagined to be simply a smooth, thin sheet, not\npossessed of any definite structure, but excited by real disturbances of the\nmatter on it onto vibrations, which carry the effect of these disturbances as\nlight and heat to other portions of matter. Now, it is possible to take an\nentirely different view of the aether in the case of a plane world.\n\nLet us imagine that, instead of the aether being a smooth sheet serving simply\nas a support, it is definitely marked and grooved.\n\nCHARLES H. HINTON,\n\n_A New Era of Thought,_ 1888\n\nIt is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation\nof something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter\nwithout mutual contact. That one body can act upon another at a distance,\nthrough a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else … is to me so great\nan absurdity, that I believe no man, who has in philosophical matters a\ncompetent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it.\n\nAs we will see shortly, the modern theory of gravity embodied in Einstein’s\ngeneral theory of relativity does use a sort of “space-filling aether” to\nexplain how gravitating bodies can influence the motions of faraway objects.\nFor Einstein, the continuous aether is simply space itself, and it is the\nbending of this aether in higher dimensions that produces gravitational\nattraction! But I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nLate in the eighteenth century, Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel successfully\nadvocated the theory that light is a type of wave motion, rather than a stream\nof particles. A variety of optical effects, such as diffraction and\npolarization, seemed to indicate that light must be a vibration in some\nunderlying medium. It was assumed that outer space is filled with a\n“luminiferous aether,” which transmits the wave motion that is light. As the\nnineteenth century wore on, this aether carne to be regarded as the\ntransmitter of magnetic and electrical forces as well.\n\n![img](Images/p073_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 70. Wave-particle duality._\n\nNowadays we are comfortable with the quantum-mechanical idea that light is\nboth particle and wave. A photon is a wavy yet solid little package that can\nzip through empty space without the benefit of any invisible vibrating jelly\nunderfoot. Just to grasp how alien the notion of a luminiferous aether has\nbecome, try to picture a nineteenth-century drawing room from which all the\nluminiferous aether has been evacuated. The gas jets are burning but no one\ncan see them! A light source with no luminiferous aether to ferry the light’s\nvibrations would be like a bell pounding silently in an evacuated bell jar.\n\nThe idea of a room emptied of aether is, of course, quite unrealistic, for\nmost aether theorists felt that ordinary matter offered an open structure to\naether. In Thomas Young’s words, aether should be able to pass through solid\nobjects “like wind through a grove of trees.” If this is the case, then no\nroom’s walls could ever keep the aether out.\n\nThe idea of an aether wind blowing right through your body is sort of\nrefreshing. Sometimes, standing on the breezy crest of a hill, I have the\nillusion that the air is blowing through me, dusting off my molecules. If we\ndo think of aether as being the same as space, it would seem to make sense to\nthink of the aether as actually blowing through us as we move through space.\n\nBut does this _really_ make sense? Certainly we can move relative to other\nobjects, but is space the kind of thing one can move relative to? The answer,\nas it turns out, is 220. Sometimes one hears that modern physics has proved\nthere is no aether. What this actually means is that modern physics has proved\nthat it is meaningless to speak of motion relative to empty space. How did\nthis come about?\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, physicists and astronomers became interested\nin determining the Earth’s absolute motion. The idea was that space is filled\nwith stagnant, motionless aether, so that as our Earth and our solar system\nand our galaxy tumble about, we should feel some kind of aether breeze on our\nfaces. The direction in which the breeze feels strongest would then be the\ndirection in which we are really moving.\n\n![img](Images/p074_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 71. A light source, with and without aether wind._\n\n“Feeling the breeze” is of course a metaphorical way of speaking: the actual\nexperimental technique was to measure the speed of light in various\ndirections. Light would go fastest when traveling with the aether wind, and\nslowest when traveling directly against it.\n\nA number of attempts to thus measure the motion of the earth through the\naether were made, the most famous of these being the well-known Michelson-\nMorley experiment of 1887. The results were that a light signal always travels\nat the same speed, regardless of which direction it goes in. Feeling for the\naether wind by measuring speeds of light rays is like sticking a flag out of a\nspaceship to see which way you’re going. Nothing happens: there’s no air in\nouter space, and no wind.\n\n![img](Images/p075_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 72. No air, no wind._\n\nAfter the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, a few physicists\nstill hoped to find some alternative way of measuring the earth’s motion\nthrough space and the aether. But most scientists began to suspect that there\nis, even in principle, no possibility of detecting an aether wind. In 1905\nAlbert Einstein made just such an assumption, and created his enormously\npowerful special theory of relativity. This theory, which we will discuss in\nmore detail in [chapter 9](19_Chapter9.html), is based on two assumptions: (1)\nThe speed of light is always the same, and (2) There is no way to detect\nabsolute motion.\n\nThe first assumption was, by 1905, pretty well established on the basis of\nexperiments like Michelson and Morley’s. The second assumption is the one that\nrepresents a dramatically new way of looking at things. According to Einstein,\n_there is no possible way in which one can detect motion through empty space._\nHe jumps here from an experimental fact (that measuring speeds of light rays\ndoes not reveal an aether wind) to a blanket hypothesis (that no possible\nexperiment can ever detect an aether wind).\n\nMost of us smile when we hear of the nineteenth-century aether concept. But it\nis important to realize that insofar as we believe in space as something\nexisting in its own right, we too have an aether concept. Empty space is\naether, aether is empty space. But what, then, is the meaning of Einstein’s\nsecond assumption vis-à-vis aether? Here is what Einstein wrote on this\nquestion in his 1920 essay “Ether and Relativity.”\n\nMore careful reflection teaches us that the special theory of relativity does\nnot compel us to deny ether. We may assume the existence of an ether; only we\nmust give up ascribing a definite state of motion to it.\n\n![img](Images/p076_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 73. Space is like a sea’s surface._\n\nThink of waves on the surface of water. Here we can describe two entirely\ndifferent things. Either we may observe how the undulatory surface forming the\nboundary between water and air alters in the course of time; or else — with\nthe help of small floats, for instance — we can observe how the position of\nthe separate particles of water alters in the course of time. If the existence\nof such floats for tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a\nfundamental impossibility in physics — if, in fact, nothing else whatever were\nobservable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it varies in\ntime, we should  have no ground for the assumption that water consists of\nmovable particles. But all the same we could characterize it as a medium.\n\nGeneralizing we must say this: — There may be supposed to be extended physical\nobjects to which the idea of motion cannot be applied. They may not be thought\nof as consisting of particles which allow themselves to be separately tracked\nthrough time. The special theory of relativity forbids us to assume the ether\nto consist of particles observable through time, but the hypothesis of ether\nin itself is not in conflict with the special theory of relativity.\n\nUnfortunately the passion of the moment predominates, in the Frail Sex, over\nevery other consideration. In their fits of fury they remember no claims and\nrecognize no distinctions. I have actually known a case where a Woman has\nexterminated her whole household, and half an hour afterwards, when her rage\nwas over and the fragments swept away, has asked what has become of her\nhusband and her children …\n\nEven in our best regulated and most approximately Circular families I cannot\nsay that the ideal of family life is so high as with you in Spaceland. There\nis peace, in so far as the absence of slaughter may be called by that name,\nbut there is necessarily little harmony of tastes or pursuits …\n\nEDWIN A. ABBOTT,\n\n_Flatland,_ 1884\n\nThe reader may wonder why Einstein bothers to go through such intellectual\ncontortions. If the aether isn’t made up of distinct trackable parts, then why\nbother with it? Why not just go ahead and say that empty space is pure\nnothingness? Why pretend that space is some continuous substance called\naether? Let’s go back to Flatland for an answer.\n\n![img](Images/p077_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 74. A Square about to get guillotined._\n\nThe Chief Circle decides to let his wife execute A Square … She’s a\nbloodthirsty segment, ready and willing to cut poor Square in half. Our hero\nis shackled in a heavy box with one opening. The Queen surges forward, her\nsharp end aglitter. She thrusts her point into the box’s small opening,\nthrusts again, and thrusts once more for good measure. But when they open the\nguillotine box, A Square is as good as new. What happened?\n\nTo understand what happened, we should start thinking of the space of Flatland\nas being somewhat like a rubber sheet or, even better, something like a huge\nunbreakable soap film. If A Cube seizes a piece of Flatland’s space and pulls\nup, then he can stretch a bit of the space to be bigger than one would expect.\nAnd this is just what he did. Cube grabbed the bit of space inside the\nguillotine box and stretched that space for all he was worth. The Queen’s\ntwelve-inch body was not long enough to reach over the “space bump” and get to\nA Square. Here is how it seemed to Square (I quote again from the imaginary\n_Further Adventures of A Square):_\n\n![img](Images/p078_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 75. A Cube stretching Flatland’s space._\n\nIf my account of what happened is confused, I can only say that this confusion\nreflects what I and my Countrymen all felt.\n\nThe Cube called out to me from Space as the Guillotine Box was fastened around\nme. Laughingly, he urged me to be composed and of good Cheer. In my unhappy\nstate, this seemed a frivolous, and even an unkind, request.\n\nAs the Queen approached, a curious tension thrilled through all my Being. The\nBox around me seemed to take on more spacious Dimensions. Somehow the hole in\nthe Box’s wall grew so deep that the Queen’s thirsty point could not attain to\nmy trembling flesh.\n\nWomen’s sharp Stingers are all but nerveless, and the Queen was not cognizant\nof her failure. Crying out that the Execution was accomplished, she withdrew.\nAn Isosceles busied himself with the opening of the Box.\n\nBut before this was achieved, I was again whirled about my central Axis. My\nnoblest Archetype, the Cube, had now restored me to my original Orientation.\nAs I babbled my thanks, he took yet one more Measure, did one fateful Deed\nthat has ensured my safety from that day on. He reached into the foul Circle’s\nbody and crushed the Tyrant’s heart.\n\n![img](Images/p079_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 76. Lumpy space._\n\nThe point of this story is that if we think of space as being made up of a\ncontinuous aether jelly, then it becomes meaningful to speak of stretching or\ndistorting space. Although, as Einstein stresses, we must not think of space\nas made up of particles, it is meaningful to think of space as having bumps\nand undulations. There is no absolute sense in which one might say that a\ngiven bump is moving this way or that, but one can certainly notice how the\nbumps move relative to each other.\n\nBumps in space (space _time_ , strictly speaking) can be used to explain\ngravitational attraction. Einstein’s 1915 general theory of relativity\nincorporates a theory of gravity that can best be understood as saying that\n(1) Matter and energy distort space, and (2) The distortions of space affect\nthe motions of matter and energy. Aether, or space, thus serves as the medium\nfor transmitting gravitational effects. Mass affects space, space affects\nmass. Let’s see how.\n\nWe must imagine that the space around any massive body is stretched. The\ndenser the mass, the greater the stretching. A good image for this is of a cue\nball resting on a rubber sheet. A sheet sags down around the ball. Or we could\nthink of a helium balloon under the sheet, making it sag up (as drawn in\nfigure 77). The “up” or “down” doesn’t matter here; the point is just that the\npresence of matter stretches space.\n\n![img](Images/p080_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 77. A massive body makes a bump in space._\n\nNow let’s try to see how the curvature of space affects the motion of\nparticles in space. A particularly clear-cut example arises if we let our\nmoving particle be a photon, a tiny piece of light.\n\n![img](Images/p080_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 78. The shortest path from_ A _to_ B.\n\nOrdinarily we think of light as traveling along straight lines. But if space\nis curved, there is no such thing as a _really straight_ line in space.\nNevertheless, light does travel along the _straightest possible_ lines.\nEquivalently, we can say that a light ray from point _A_ to point _B_ will\nalways go along the _shortest possible path_ from _A_ to _B._\n\nIf there is a big bump in space between _A_ and _B,_ then the shortest path\nwill not be directly over the bump. The shortest path will be the path that\ncompromises between going right over the bump and looping way out around it.\nThis is easy enough to understand if, in figure 78, we think of _A_ and _B_ as\nvillages separated by a mountain. The natural, shortest trail between the two\nis along the wavy line.\n\n![img](Images/p081_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 79. The shortest path from_ A _to_ B, _seen from above._\n\n![img](Images/p081_2.jpg)\n\n_Side view of Asirian telepathy._\n\n[PUZZLE 6.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa1)\n\n_In Astria, Charles H. Hinton’s version of Flatland, it is explicitly assumed\nthat the two-dimensional creatures have a slight thickness, and that they are\nsliding around on a hard surface. They are like cold cuts lying on a flat tray\nof space, a space that serves as an elastic medium for transmitting all kinds\nof vibrations. Deep within the tissue of his or her body, each Astrian has a\nsharp little 3-D bump, a sort of “astral vibrator.” This vibrator, about the\nsize of a phonograph needle, oscillates with the rhythm of each Astrian’s\nthoughts so as to set up sympathetic vibrations in the underlying space. Any\nother Astrian who is nearby can, without really knowing how, pick up the\nflavor of these thoughts from the vibrations of his own bump. What kind of\nimpression would the Astrians get of one of their fellows who had been turned\nover in the third dimension_?\n\nIf we look down at this path from above, it looks for all the world as if the\ngravitational attraction of the massive object had _bent_ the light ray by\n_pulling_ on it. Yet what has really happened is that the mass stretched the\nspace so that the shortest path from _A_ to _B_ has a bulge in it. The\ngravitational bending of the paths of material objects can also be explained\nin this way, although there the situation gets a little more complicated.\n\nIs the physical world in which we live a purely mathematical construct? Put\nthe question in another way: Is spacetime only an arena within which fields\nand particles move about as “physical” and “foreign” entities? Or is the four-\ndimensional continuum all there is? Is curved empty geometry a kind of magic\nbuilding material out of which everything in the physical world is made: (1) a\nslow curvature in one region of space describes a gravitational field; (2) a\nrippled geometry with a different type of curvature somewhere else describes\nan electromagnetic field; (3) a knotted-up region of high curvature describes\na concentration of charge and mass-energy that moves like a particle? Are\nfields and particles foreign entities immersed _in_ geometry, or are they\nnothing _but_ geometry?\n\nJOHN A. WHEELER,\n\n“Curved Empty Spacetime as the Building Material of the Physical World: An\nAssessment,” 1972\n\nSo gravity can be explained by assuming that matter curves space. But why\nshould matter do this? Why should matter curve space?\n\nOne explanation is that space curvature is what matter _is._ William K.\nClifford first proposed this theory in an 1870 paper called “On the Space\nTheory of Matter\":\n\nI hold in fact\n\n  1. That small portions of space _are_ in fact of a nature analogous to little hills on a surface which is on the average flat; namely, that the ordinary laws of geometry are not valid in them.\n  2. That this property of being curved or distorted is continually being passed on from one portion of space to another after the matter of a wave.\n  3. That this variation of the curvature of space is what really happens in that phenomenon which we call the _motion of matter,_ whether ponderable or ethereal.\n  4. That in the physical world nothing else takes place but this variation, subject (possibly) to the law of continuity.\n\n![img](Images/p082_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 80. Three bits of matter in space._\n\nThis is a very interesting view of matter, a view that the contemporary\nphysicist John Wheeler has called _geometrodynamics._ Traditionally, people\nthought of matter as a solid substance floating in empty space. But under the\ngeometrodynamic viewpoint, space is not really empty and matter is not really\nsolid. Space is an aether, a continuous substance that is curved in higher\ndimensions. And matter is a sort of patterning in the aether.\n\nThis idea is intellectually satisfying because it represents the completion of\na dialectic triad. Before we had as _thesis_ the concept of solid matter, and\nas _antithesis_ the concept of utterly empty space. Matter versus space;\nsomething versus nothing. The _synthesis_ is to regard space and matter both\nas a continuous aether substance: when the aether is flat it looks like empty\nspace, when it is sharply curved it looks like matter. The old thesis and\nantithesis are simply different aspects of the higher synthesis!\n\n![img](Images/p083_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 81. A vortex thread._\n\nClifford’s notion of building up matter out of pure curved space was a very\nbold step forward. A few years earlier, William Thomson had taken a partial\nstep in this direction. Rather than taking matter to be higher-dimensional\n“bumps” in aether or empty space, Thomson proposed that matter is made up of\nthree-dimensional vortex rings in the aether.\n\nA “vortex ring” is something like a smoke ring, a circle of substance that\nswirls around and around on itself. Thomson’s theory was inspired by Hermann\nvon Helmholtz’s 1857 proof that in a perfect fluid, any whirlpools or vortices\nmust be centered on lines that either go out to the boundaries of the fluid or\ncurve back on themselves to make circles. In watching the water drain out of a\nbathtub, one often observes a vortex line of the first type: a wobbly,\nthreadlike whirlpool running from the water’s surface to the drain below. The\nfunnel of a tornado is a similar example of a vortex thread. Now if the vortex\nthread bends back on itself to make a circle, one gets a vortex ring. The\nremarkable thing about vortex rings is that they consist of a closed-off\nregion of the underlying fluid. This can be seen in watching a smoke ring. For\na while at least, a smoke ring does not gain or lose any air … It consists of\nthe same smoky air circling around and around on itself.\n\n![img](Images/p084_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 82. A vortex ring._\n\n![img](Images/p084_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 83. A smoke-ring projector. (Engraving from A. E. Dolbear,_ Matter,\nEther, and Motion.)\n\n[PUZZLE 6.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa2)\n\n_As in puzzle 6.1, we will think about Astrians as being two-dimensional\ncreatures who slide about on top of their space-aether. Each Astrian has a\nkind of higher-dimensional tooth that digs down into the firm, underlying\nspace. How might the Astrians use meditation techniques to levitate_?\n\nSome nineteenth-century investigators actually built smoke-ring projectors and\nspent hours watching how smoke rings move, vibrate, and bounce off each other.\nThe hope was that the various properties of matter could all be explained by\ntreating atoms as vortex rings in some perfectly frictionless underlying\naether. A particularly nice feature of the vortex-ring theory was that it\nexplained how atoms could have a measurable size, yet be indivisible: a smoke\nring has a certain radius, but if you try to cut the ring in half you get\nnothing but some rapidly dispersed air currents.\n\n![img](Images/p085_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 84. The title page from Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Tait’s_ The\nUnseen Universe.\n\nIf in the body there be no other material than the visible particles, and in\nthe brain no other material than a certain quantity of phosphorous and other\nthings, such as we know them in the common state, and if individual\nconsciousness depends upon the structural presence of these substances in the\nbody and brain, then when this structure falls to pieces there are of course\nreasonable grounds for supposing that such consciousness has entirely ceased.\nBut it is the object of this volume to exhibit various scientific reasons for\nbelieving that there is something beyond that which we call the visible\nuniverse; and that individual consciousness is in some mysterious manner\nrelated to, or dependent upon, the interaction of the seen and unseen.\n\nBALFOUR STEWART AND PETER GUTHRIE TAIT,\n\n_The Unseen Universe,_ 1875\n\nThe vortex-ring theory of matter failed to lead to any testable predictions,\nand was eventually abandoned. One of the last books to advocate the theory was\na curious work called _The Unseen Universe_ (1875). The book seems to say that\nthe _soul_ exists as a knotted vortex ring in the aether. By way  of\nillustrating this notion, the authors (Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Tait)\nput a picture of a knot on the title page and the binding of their book.\n\nWhether this vast homogeneous expanse of isotropic matter [the aether] is\nfitted not only to be a medium of physical interaction between distant bodies,\nand to fulfill other physical functions of which, perhaps we have as yet no\nconception, but also as the authors of _The Unseen Universe_ seem to suggest,\nto constitute the material organism of beings exercising functions of life and\nmind as high or higher than ours are at present, is a question far\ntranscending the limits of physical speculation.\n\nJAMES CLERK MAXWELL,\n\n“The Aether,” 1876\n\nAlthough it is not immediately evident, the image of a knotted vortex ring\ninvolves the fourth dimension. The reason for this is that it is impossible to\npass a vortex ring through itself; it has a kind of integrity or solidity akin\nto that of an actual ring of material substance. Just as Slade and Zöllner\nclaimed that higher-dimensional spirits could knot their sealed cords, the\nauthors of _The Unseen Universe_ held that God creates our immortal souls by\nputting intricate knots and braids into vortex rings of aether. James Clerk\nMaxwell was amused and fascinated by this notion, and wrote a poem about it:\n\nMy soul is an entangled knot,\n\nUpon a liquid vortex wrought\n\nBy Intellect in the Unseen residing.\n\nAnd thine doth like a convict sit,\n\nWith marlinspike untwisting it,\n\nOnly to find its knottiness abiding;\n\nSince all the tools for its untying\n\nIn four-dimensional space are lying.\n\n![img](Images/p086_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 85. “My soul is an entangled knot.”_\n\n![img](Images/p086_2.jpg)\n\n_An Astrian slides_ on _space, but a Flatlander is embedded_ in _space._\n\n[PUZZLE 6.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa3)\n\n_We assume that the Flatlanders are actually_ in _their space, like inkblots\nin thin paper, or like color swirls in a soap film. A Flatlander cannot exist\noutside of his or her space. But how, then, was A Cube able to lift A Square\nout of Flatland’s space and turn him over_?\n\nAs the nineteenth century drew to a close, more and more bizarre theories\ninvolving matter, aether, and the fourth dimension began to appear — theories\nthat make one think of baroque, overdone ornamentation, of layer after layer\nof Victorian corsets and petticoats, of opulent, fin de siècle decadence.\n\n![img](Images/p087_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 86. Water squirts._\n\nIn 1892, for instance, Karl Pearson proposed in his _Grammar of Science_ that\nthe aether is a four-dimensional fluid seeping into our three-dimensional\nspace — sort of like water welling up through the holes in the bottom of a\nboat:\n\nIn this theory an atom is conceived to be a point at which ether flows in all\ndirections into space; such a point is termed an _ether squirt._ An ether\nsquirt in the ether is thus something like a tap turned on under water, except\nthat the machinery of the tap is dispensed with in the case of the squirt. Two\nsuch squirts, if placed in ether, move relatively to each other, exactly like\ntwo gravitating particles, the mass of either corresponding to the mean rate\nat which ether is poured in at the squirt.\n\n[PUZZLE 6.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa4)\n\n_Suppose we believe, along with Einstein, that it is possible to permanently\nmark or label a given point in space. But now suppose that we find a hole in\nspace. Doesn’t the hole serve to single out a definite space location_?\n\nA fourth dimension is involved in Pearson’s theory, for this higher dimension\nis needed to store the “machinery of the taps;/ that bring the flow of aether\nto each atom. Two such aether squirts will indeed attract each other because\nthe aether between them is moving more rapidly than in the other parts of\nspace. Let me briefly explain why. There is a law of fluid dynamics called\nBernoulli’s law, which says that the more rapidly a fluid moves, the lower its\npressure is. Since the aether between the squirts moves rapidly, there is a\nlow-pressure region between them, and the rest of the aether will tend to\ncompress this low-pressure region. Thus the two squirts will move together as\nif drawn by gravitational attraction.\n\n![img](Images/p088_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 87.

Recently astronomers found two\nquasars that seem to be unusually close to each other. Further analysis of\nthese two spots of light revealed that what we are seeing is actually two\nimages of the same quasar. This is explained by assuming there is a massive\ngalaxy between us and the quasar. Can you find a “space bump” diagram that\nshows how one quasar’s image can be split into two_?\n\n[PUZZLE 6.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch6pa6)\n\n_Generally we have represented the space curvature caused by a bit of mass as\na rounded-off hump. Suppose that bits of mass were actual points. What kind of\nspace shape would best represent such a mass point_?\n\nCrazy theories … but none of them crazy enough to be right!\n\nIn [chapter 11](21_Chapter11.html) we’ll look at the modern way of building\nmatter up from space-aether. Clifford’s idea that matter is a bump in space is\nbasically correct — but he was too conservative in assuming the underlying\nspace to be three- or four-dimensional. According to modern quantum mechanics,\na bit of matter is a “bump” in an _infinite_ -dimensional Hilbert space!\n\n\n## 7\n\n##  The Shape of Space\n\nIN THE LAST CHAPTER we briefly mentioned the idea that space can be _curved,_\ncurved by bulging it out into the fourth dimension. We looked at two kinds of\nspace curvature: the medium-scale curvature associated with gravitational\nattraction, and the small-scale curvature that may account for matter. Now we\nare going to talk about the large-scale curvature of space taken as a whole.\n\nTo make quite clear what is meant by this talk of different “scales of\ncurvature,” consider the following. On the large scale, we say that the\nsurface of the Earth is curved into the shape of a sphere — a sphere that\nbulges a bit at the equator. On the medium, human-sized scale, we notice that\nthe Earth’s surface is covered with hills and valleys. And on the small scale,\nthe Earth’s surface breaks into individual rocks and clods of dirt.\n\n![img](Images/p090_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 88. Medium-scale curvature._\n\nNow, once again, when I speak of the _small-scale curvature of space,_ I am\nthinking of tiny bumps or bubbles or vortices that might conceivably be the\nsame as elementary particles of matter. When I talk about the _medium-scale\ncurvature of space,_ I am referring to the planet-sized and galaxy-sized space\nhumps that, according to Einstein, account for the effects of gravitational\nattraction. And now, when I talk about the _large-scale curvature of space,_ I\nam asking about the overall shape of our universe.\n\n![img](Images/p091_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 89. What is the shape of space_?\n\nIn cosmology the reliance on physical simplicity, pure thought and revealed\nknowledge is carried well beyond the fringe because we have so little else to\ngo on. By this desperate course we have arrived at a few simple pictures of\nwhat the Universe may be like. The great goal now is to become more familiar\nwith the Universe, to learn whether any of these pictures may be a reasonable\napproximation, and if so how the approximation may be improved. The great\nexcitement in cosmology is that the prospects for doing this seem to be\nexcellent.\n\nP. J. E. PEEBLES,\n\n_Physical Cosmology,_ 1971\n\nWhat is the shape of space? Is it flat, or is it bent? Is it nicely laid out,\nor is it warped and shrunken? Is it finite, or is it infinite? Which of the\nfollowing does space resemble more: (a) a sheet of paper, (b) an endless\ndesert, (c) a soap bubble, (d) a doughnut, (e) an Escher drawing, (f) an ice\ncream cone, (g) the branches of a tree, or (h) a human body?\n\nQuestions about the overall shape of space belong to the science called\ncosmology. I love cosmology: there’s something uplifting about viewing the\nentire universe as a single object with a certain shape. What entity, short of\nGod, could be nobler or worthier of man’s attention than the cosmos itself?\nForget about interest rates, forget about war and murder, let’s talk about\n_space._\n\nThe ancients seem usually to have thought of our universe as bounded. Either\nthe Earth itself actually had edges, or the Earth was to be thought of as a\nball floating inside a large crystal sphere on which the stars were hung. But\nto a modern thinker, the notion of a universe with edges is almost\ninconceivable.\n\n![img](Images/p092_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 90. A finite, bounded universe._\n\nWhat would it be like to come to a place where space stops? Think of a black\ndoorway opening onto Nothingness. Any object that passes through the doorway\nsimply ceases to exist. Beyond the door there is no aether, no space to\nsustain an object’s structure. Such a “door into Nothing” is perhaps a little\nbit like a star that has collapsed to form a black hole. Maybe there are such\ndoors scattered here and there in our universe. But still, we feel that such\ndoors do not exist on any extremely large scale … We do not think that our\nspace, taken as a whole, has edges. In other words, we believe that our space\nis unbounded.\n\n![img](Images/p092_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 91. A hole in space._\n\n![img](Images/p093_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 92. Three types of 1-D space: finite and bounded, infinite and\nunbounded, finite and unbounded._\n\nWhere the sun’s rays grazing the earth in January pass off and merge into\ndarkness lies a strange world.\n\nTis a vast bubble flown in a substance something like glass, but harder far\nand untransparent.\n\nAnd just as a bubble blown by us consists of a distended film, so this bubble,\nvast beyond comparison, consists of a film distended and coherent.\n\nOn its surface in the course of ages has fallen a thin layer of space dust,\nand so smooth is this surface that the dust slips over it to and fro and forms\ndensities and clusters as its own attractions and movements determine.\n\nThe dust is kept on the polished surface by the attraction of the vast film;\nbut, except for that, it moves on it freely in every direction.\n\nAnd here and there are condensations wherein have fallen together numbers of\nthese floating masses, and where the dust condensing for ages has formed vast\ndisks.\n\nCHARLES H. HINTON,\n\n“A plane World,” 1884\n\nAt first blush, one is inclined to think that if space is unbounded, then it\nmust be infinite as well. But this is not the case. In _one_ dimension, a\ncircle is an example of a line that is finitely long, yet has no ends. You can\nwalk round a circle forever. The surface of a sphere, such as Earth, is an\nexample of a two-dimensional space that is finite and unbounded. In a famous\n1854 lecture, “The Hypotheses Which Lie at the Foundations of Geometry,”\nBernhard Riemann first suggested that something similar is also possible for\n_three_ -dimensional space:\n\nIn the extension of space-construction to the infinitely great, we must\ndistinguish between _unboundedness_ and _infinite extent._ The unboundedness\nof space possesses a greater empirical certainty than any external experience.\nBut its infinite extent by no means follows from this. If we ascribe to space\nconstant curvature, then space must necessarily be finite provided this\ncurvature has ever so small a positive value.\n\nRiemann is suggesting here that our space may be the 3-D hypersurface of a 4-D\nhypersphere. Back in [chapter 3](11_Chapter3.html) we talked about what\nhyperspheres look like from the outside. Now we want to try to imagine what a\nhypersphere looks like from a point on its hypersurface. We turn, of course,\nto A Square. What would it be like for the Flatlanders to live not on a plane\nbut on the surface of a 3-D sphere?\n\n[PUZZLE 7.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa1)\n\n_Although no line on a curved surface is_ really _straight, some lines are\nstraighter than others: straighter in the sense of being shortest paths. Such\nstraightest possible lines are called the_ geodesics _of the surface. What\nkinds of lines do you think are geodesics on a sphere!_\n\nThe theme of “Sphereland” has been treated many times  before. What I’d like\nto do here is to approach the theme from a new angle.\n\nBy way of introduction to the tack I’m going to take, I should confess that\nthis summer (it’s October now) I was, for a time, happily obsessed with the\nfictional notion that Flatland really exists, and that Edwin Abbott used to go\nlook at it all the time. Normally, we think of Flatland as an infinite plane,\nbut so far as we can see, there are no glistening, polygon-filled infinite\nplans floating around anywhere near the planet Earth. Since we don’t see\nFlatland, I reasoned that it must be hidden somewhere — in a basement, let us\nsay. So now I had an interesting problem to think about: How might one fit an\nunbounded two-dimensional world inside an ordinary three-dimensional room?\n\n![img](Images/p094_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 93. Let’s put Flatland in the basement!_\n\nSuppose we had a tube of exceedingly small bore bent into a circular shape,\nand within this tube a worm. Then in the limiting case when we make the bore\nof the tube and the worm indefinitely fine, we shall be considering space of\none dimension. Assuming that the worm is incapable of recognizing anything\noutside its own tube-space, it would still be able to draw certain inferences\nas to the nature of the space in which it existed were it capable of\ndistinguishing some mark _C_ on the side of its tube. Thus it would notice\nwhen it returned to the point _C_ , and it would find that this return would\ncontinually recur as it went round in the bore; in other words, the worm would\nreadily postulate the finiteness of space. Further, since the worm would\nalways have the same _amount of bending,_ since all parts of a circle are of\nthe same shape, it might naturally assume the sameness of all space, or that\nspace possessed the same properties at all points.\n\nWILLIAM K. CLIFFORD,\n\n_The Common Sense of the Exact Sciences,_ 1879\n\nWell, I thought of three ways to fit Flatland in the basement. Here’s the\nfirst, presented as excerpts from the first-person account of one Arnold\nKlube. As the first excerpt begins, Klube is about to find Sphereland in the\nbasement of an abandoned technical school.\n\nEXCERPTS FROM ARNOLD KLUBE’S _God of Sphereland_\n\nThe door closed behind me and I moved carefully down the dusty stairs. At the\nbottom I found a light switch. Slowly, hesitantly, I snapped it on.\n\nThe small basement room was dominated by a large sphere, apparently\nweightless. Nearly two meters in diameter, the sphere hovered a few\ncentimeters above the floor. Could this be Flatland?\n\nI moved closer and examined the object’s shimmering surface. It was like the\ntaut skin of a large soap bubble: transparent, yet patterned with shifting\nflecks of color. At first all was confusion, but as I looked closer I began to\nmake out little avenues along which the color flecks moved. These bright,\ndarting animacules were undoubtedly the Flatlanders.\n\n![img](Images/p095_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 94. Sphereland in the basement._\n\nOn one side of the room I found a bench lined with scientific instruments,\nmost notably a stand-mounted binocular microscope. Trembling a bit in my\nexcitement, I set the microscope up next to the wonderful sphere.\n\nI will present the facts as succinctly as possible. The world which I have\ndiscovered is a two-dimensional film curved into the shape of a sphere some\nfive meters in circumference. The inhabitants of this world — which I call\nSphereland — are small polygonal dots, with an average width of one-tenth\nmillimeter. Their space is thus of a circumference equal to some 50,000 body\nlengths. By way of comparison, note that 50,000 human body lengths comes to\n100 kilometers.\n\nBefore long, I learned to read the “lips” of the Spherelanders, and to\nunderstand their language. As Abbott has reported, they are under the\nimpression that they are living in an infinite plane! It is easy enough for us\nto imagine walking 100 kilometers, but the fact of the matter is that no\nSpherelander has ever made the journey “around” space.\n\nThere are good reasons for this. If we recall that the surface area of a\nsphere is given by the formula _E_ 2 / π, where _E_ is the sphere’s equatorial\ncircumference, then it is easy enough to calculate that Sphereland has space\nto accommodate less than one billion of its citizens, even were they to be\npacked edge to edge. So far as I can estimate, the actual population of\nSphereland numbers some fifty million souls. Thus, each of the Spherelanders\nhas at his or her disposal an amount of empty space but twenty times that of\nhis or her body — the equivalent, in our terms, of a low-ceilinged prison cell\njust long enough to lie down in.\n\n![img](Images/p096_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 95. Arnold Klube._\n\nSphereland, in short, is extremely crowded. The entire space is filled with\nbodies and buildings. The crooked little lanes are as packed with life as any\nFar Eastern bazaar. Thieves and murderers are everywhere, and to travel any\ngreat distance is a virtual impossibility.\n\nDays passed into months, and still I hovered over Sphereland, attentive as an\nidle god. I found on the workbench certain tools, apparently designed for\nmanipulating the little creatures’ space.\n\nUpon experimentation, I learned that the space of Sphereland is not quite two-\ndimensional after all. It has a definite, though all but imperceptible,\nthickness. Using some special tweezers and a small cutting frame, I was\nactually able to take out and examine bits of the space. In one case, I lifted\nout a certain Square, turned him over, and set him back.\n\nThe altered Square’s appearance was such that his fellows sought to destroy\nhim. I rescued him and annihilated his chief oppressor. The Square is quite\ndevoted to me now and believes, having seen certain objects which I thrust\ninto his space, that I am a Cube.\n\n![img](Images/p097_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 96. Each point on a sphere is equally central._\n\nMany present-day scientists feel that our space is indeed curved into a\nhypersphere. Recall from the last chapter that we can take Einstein’s general\ntheory of relativity to mean that matter curves space. Apparently, if there is\nenough matter in our universe, then the cumulative curvature will be enough to\nbend our space back on itself. If space is hyperspherical, then there are a\nlimited number of galaxies, yet no galaxy is out on the edge of things. Each\ngalaxy is in an equally central position. This is analogous to the fact that\nany country on Earth can view itself as the central point on the planet.\n\nIf our space is hyperspherical, then flying a spaceship in any fixed direction\nlong enough should eventually lead back to our galaxy. Unfortunately, the\ncircumference of our hypersphere is so great that it is unlikely that any\nMagellan of space will ever carry out such a circumnavigation. One estimate is\nthat our space is about eighty billion light-years in circumference!\n\nJust to get a good image of hyperspherical space, imagine yourself to be\nfloating in a space that’s been curved into the shape of a hypersphere a\nhundred meters in circumference. You’re the only object in the space, so it’s\nreally dark. You fumble a flare out of your spacesuit, light it … and for some\nreason there’s _two_ lights. There’s the flare right next to you, and there’s\na flare fifty meters off! What’s more, there’s somebody else in the space with\nyou, a spacesuited person holding the other flare.\n\n![img](Images/p098_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 97. An un-American world view._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa2)\n\n_Suppose we were to discover a big bright star with nothing inside it but\nlight and empty space. What might we conclude_?\n\n[PUZZLE 7.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa3)\n\n_Most cosmologists assume that any one region of our universe is more or less\nlike any other region. This assumption is known as the_ cosmological\nprinciple. _There is no over-whelming body of evidence for the cosmological\nprinciple. People just like it because it makes things simpler. But now\nsuppose the cosmological principle is wrong. Suppose that there is a single\nmost important object in our universe — a unique mammoth object that is very\nmuch more massive than anything else. If you combine this supposition with the\nassumption that space curves back on itself like a hypersphere, what kind of\nuniverse do you get? Can you draw a Flatland_ _I_ _Sphereland-style picture of\nsuch a space_?\n\nYou decide to go visit the other person with the flare. You leave your flare\nbehind, just floating there, and push yourself through the empty space by\nmeans of a little hand-held jet you happen to have handy. Your flare and the\nother person’s flare stay immobile … but now he’s running away from you! He —\nor is it she? — is upside-down relative to you, and no matter which way you\ngo, he (or she) changes direction to keep you from getting any closer. Could\nthe other person be some sort of mirror image?\n\n![img](Images/p099_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 98. A Square sees a ghost image._\n\nYes. Think of A Square on the surface of a small sphere. We assume that the\nSphereland light rays move around the spherical space in great circles. What\nwe can notice in figure 98 is that all the light rays that start out from\nSquare’s body recross each other at the opposite side of the sphere. This\nmeans that Square will see a bunch of images of pieces of his body over on the\nother side of the sphere, and as it turns out, these images will fit together\nto make a ghost image of himself, upside-down and mirror-reversed.\n\nTo continue. You decide to go look at the other person’s flare. It floats\nthere, blazing away, but when you reach out to touch it you find that nothing\nis there. Why? Because the “other flare” is in fact a virtual image of your\nreal flare. It is a ghost image formed at the place where all the light rays\nfrom your real flare cross each other.\n\nCuriouser and curiouser. After returning to your flare you decide that it’s\ngetting too cramped in your spacesuit. You take out a tremendous rubber\nballoon, crawl inside it, and begin filling it up with air from your tank.\nYou’ve brought the flare along, so the balloon is all lit up inside. It’s nice\nto be inside the balloon and not to have to see the weird ghost images of the\nflare and yourself. You take off your suit and loll against the balloon’s\ngently curving wall. The tank next to you is hissing away, and the balloon is\ngrowing.\n\n![img](Images/p100_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 99. A Square in the weird balloon._\n\n![img](Images/p100_2.jpg)\n\n_A flat space with distorted distances._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa4)\n\n_Here is a two-dimensional pattern of lines. Suppose that in 3-D space you\nwere to stretch this surface so that the distances between each neighboring\npair of lines became the same. What shape would the surface take_?\n\nSuddenly, something is wrong. The balloon wall goes flat and starts curving\naway from you. You are outside the balloon! The tank is still next to you but\nthe air seems thinner. The balloon rapidly shrinks away from you, down to\nbeach-ball size, and collapses. What happened?\n\nPush it down a dimension and look at A Square. A Flatland balloon is just an\nelastic circle. When it expands past the equator it is able to shrink back\ndown to starting size … on the other side of spherical space.\n\nThis is a really odd feature of hyperspherical space. Any sphere that expands\nlong enough ends up by expanding past the maximum possible size and continuing\nto “expand” on down to point size. You can visualize this in our own universe\nby thinking of a fleet of survey ships flying away from Earth in different\ndirections. If they travel at the same speed, the ships will lie on the\nsurface of an expanding sphere centered on Earth. After a while the pilots\nwill notice, to their surprise, that although no one has changed course the\nships are drawing closer and closer together. The unsurveyed space has become\na shrinking sphere! When the ships meet up they’ll be as far from Earth as\nit’s possible to get. And there will be no surprises left.\n\n![img](Images/p101_1.jpg)\n\n_A Möbius strip._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.5](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa5)\n\n_A Möbius strip is formed by taking a strip of paper, giving it a half-twist,\nand taping the two ends together. Think of A Square as an ink pattern that\nsoaks right through the paper of a Möbius strip. If he slides around the\nstrip, what happens to him_?\n\nSo now we have a pretty good image of at least two kinds of space: regular\nold-fashioned flat space, and finite unbounded hyperspherical space. By “flat”\nspace I mean nothing more complex than a standard three-dimensional Euclidean\nspace stretching out to infinity in every direction. A two-dimensional flat\nspace is called a plane, and a three dimensional flat space is sometimes\ncalled a _homaloidal_ space.\n\nWhat homaloidal space and hyperspherical space have in common is that they are\ncurved the same amount everywhere. Similarly, we say that planes and spheres\nare _surfaces of constant curvature._ The sphere is certainly not flat, but\neach point on a sphere is like any other point — there are no lumps. One way\nof characterizing surfaces of constant curvature is to say that only on such\nsurfaces is it possible to slide triangles around without having the sides and\nangles change. By the same token, we say that a three-dimensional _space of\nconstant curvature_ is a space in which one can move a rigid body around\nwithout having the relative proportions of the body change.\n\n![img](Images/p102_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 100. Gravitational space bending._\n\nI dozed off and dreamed. But, surprisingly enough, this time I did not see a\npicture of Lineland — the place which I used to visit as a much wiser\nFlatlander, bent on telling its citizens the truth, so obvious to myself since\nI could see the real relations which the people were unable to perceive — no,\nI dreamed something quite different. I was a Sphere from the country of three\ndimensions and I was visiting my own world, my own Flatland. No, not Flatland,\nbut Sphereland, because I could see clearly now that my world was curved in a\ndirection which had never been visible to me before …\n\nI look to the left, to the right, to all sides, and still the world, my world,\ndoes not stretch infinitely in every direction. Of course not, because my\nworld is not infinite. It does not stretch out on all sides into infinity. It\nis a bend, a curved world. I can go around it! I can go and fly all around my\nworld, my spherical Flatland. How utterly fantastic …\n\nBut how about those light rays? How do they travel? Straight ahead? In\nstraight lines? No, of course not. They cannot leave the space, their space.\nThey have to follow the curve of that space because they belong to it. To us,\nSpherelanders, they look like straight lines. We think that light travels in\nstraight lines. And they are not really curved in our space, but follow the\ncurve of our space. They have to. But seen from the outside, they are not\nstraight lines, they are nothing but the shortest connecting lines possible on\nthe surface of a sphere.\n\nDIONYS BURGER,\n\n_Sphereland,_ 1965\n\nThe fact of the matter is that our space is _not_ a space of constant\ncurvature. A square that is transported to a point near a star will be\ndistorted, by gravitational space bending, into the shape of a curved\nrectangle. But many cosmologists like to assume that at least on the large\nscale our space has constant curvature. On the medium scale, Earth’s surface\nhas anything but constant curvature; but on the large scale Earth’s surface is\napproximately a smooth sphere — perhaps our space’s gravity bumps also average\nout in a smooth way.\n\nIf we do assume that our space has an approximately constant curvature on the\nlarge scale, then what are the possibilities? We have mentioned two: flat (or\nhomaloidal) space, and hyperspherical space. There is a third kind of space\nwith constant curvature. This kind of space is usually called _hyperbolic\nspace._ In order to understand what three dimensional hyperbolic space is\nlike, let’s first look into two-dimensional hyperbolic space. A little while\nback we were thinking about a Flatland that is the surface of a sphere. It\nturns out that two-dimensional hyperbolic space is best represented as the\nsurface of a so-called _pseudosphere._ But what is a pseudosphere?\n\nA pseudosphere, like a sphere, can be thought of as a 2-D surface. The sphere\nis smaller than a plane: it bends back on itself and is finite, whereas the\nplane is, of course, infinite. A pseudosphere, strangely enough, is _bigger_\nthan the plane. Both plane and pseudosphere are infinite, yet the pseudosphere\nmanages to have more room. To begin to get the notion of a pseudosphere, you\nmight think about crawling around on an endless taffy plane. Every few feet\nyou stop to grab and stretch the plane’s material. It gets baggy and wrinkled\n… more and more spacious.\n\nPrecisely because the pseudosphere is actually bigger than the plane, it is\nvery hard to represent it in the normal Euclidean space of our drawings. But\nthere is a special trick for shrinking a pseudosphere to fit inside a disk. In\norder to better understand how such a shrinking procedure works, let’s\nconsider how one might shrink the normal _plane_ to fit inside a _square._\n\n![img](Images/p103_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 101. Infinite checkerboard, shrunk to fit in a square._\n\nI’ll present this method as another imaginary first-person account by a man\nwho finds Flatland in a basement. The man is called Felix Ungluck, and, sad to\nsay, he is very clumsy.\n\nEXCERPT FROM FELIX UNGLUCK’S _The Pure hand_\n\nThe door swung closed behind me. For a moment I could see nothing, and I\nworried that I might fall. But then, moving my head back and forth, I caught a\ngleam of light from below. Something was down there.\n\nI found a light switch and clicked it on. Floating near the foot of the stairs\nwas a weightless square, some two meters on a side. It was marked in an\nirregular pattern which grew ever more intricate near the fuzzy edges. At\nfirst I took it for a sort of flying carpet … but then I realized that each\ncolored bit was moving with a life of its own. This was Flatland, its infinite\nexpanse somehow compressed to the size of a two-meter square.\n\nMesmerized, I descended the staircase and leaned over the shrunken world. The\npolygonal little Flatlanders darted this way and that, waxing as they neared\nthe center, shrinking as they approached the edges. It was like a living\nSunday funnies … an _infinite_ living Sunday funnies section with smaller and\nsmaller boxes squeezed in on every side, an infinitely regressing pattern in\nthe space of a two-meter square.\n\nUpstairs there was a sudden loud crash. Unsure of my footing, frightened by\nthe noise, I fell forward. My body passed through Flatland as easily as a\ndiver passes through a lake’s surface.\n\n![img](Images/p104_1.jpg)\n\n_An unreachable hole._\n\n[PUZZLE 7.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa6)\n\n_Suppose that there is a hole in Flatland, but that no one can fall into it\nbecause the closer they get to it, the more they shrink. Can you draw a\ncurved-space picture of this situation_?\n\n![img](Images/p105_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 102. Felix Ungluck._\n\nThe little creatures darted away from my intruding bulk, scattering like so\nmany water striders. And I — like a curse from infinity — I eclipsed an\nendless acreage and fell heavily to the floor. I seemed to hear the\nFlatlanders’ faint and desperate cries.\n\nLooking down at my body, I realized with horror that I had torn legions of\nthese innocent beings out of their space. They stuck to me, sliding this way\nand that over the rough fabric of my clothes. I could see that they were\nmortally wounded. Slowly the pale plaid shimmer died out. I put my face in my\nhands and began to weep.\n\n![img](Images/p105_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 103. “I put my face in my hands and began to weep.”_\n\nFigure 101 is not a pseudosphere, but it is based on a trick that will enable\nus to draw a pseudosphere soon. Figure 101 depicts a plane. The whole infinite\nplane is squeezed into a finite square. How is this done? By repeatedly\nhalving the distances as one approaches the square’s boundary.\n\nSome readers will have heard of Zeno’s paradoxes. Zeno was an early Greek\nphilosopher who was interested in demonstrating that the simple idea of\n“motion” can lead to a number of logical difficulties. His best-known paradox\nstates that you can never leave the room you are in. For, reasons Zeno, in\norder to reach the door you must first traverse half the distance there. But\nthen you are still in the room, and to reach the door you must traverse half\nthe remaining distance. But then you are still in the room, and to reach the\ndoor you must traverse half the remaining distance. But then …\n\n![img](Images/p106_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 104. Infinitely many steps._\n\nThe paradox here is that the simple two paces that should get you out of the\nroom can be split into an infinite succession of smaller and smaller paces. In\na sense, leaving the room involves completing an infinite task. Of course, we\ndo not normally make each pace half as long as the pace before, and we leave\nrooms with no difficulty.\n\nBut what if you were in a room filled with some strange kind of force field, a\nforce field that made you get half as big each time you took another step\ntoward the door? You would start out two paces from the door, as before. But\nnow after the first pace you shrink to half your size. You are one old pace,\nor two new paces, from the door. Taking another pace, you shrink again by a\nfactor of two and are now two doubly shrunken paces from the door!\n\nIn figures 101 and 105 we show how to use this Zeno-style shrinking to fit an\ninfinite plane inside, respectively, a square and a circle. In figure 101,\neach of the checkerboard’s squares is supposed to be really the same size. Put\ndifferently, we can turn the object in figure 101 back into a plane by\nstretching each of the checkerboard squares back up to unit size. In figure\n105, each of the triangles is supposed to be really the same size. One can\nlook at the triangles as being arranged in concentric rings, with each ring\nhalf the thickness of the one before. Once again, if we could stretch each\ntriangle back to unit size, we’d get a plane.\n\n![img](Images/p107_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 105. Infinite plane inside a circle._\n\n![img](Images/p108_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 106. Pseudospherical tesselation._\n\nNow, what about the pseudosphere? The pseudosphere can be represented as an\ninfinite pattern of warped triangles squeezed inside a circle, as in figure\n106. The Dutch artist Maurits Escher sometimes used patterns like this. What\nmakes the pseudosphere different is that if you stretched each of its\ntriangles to unit size (and straightened out their sides as well), then you’d\nget something that will not fit in a plane without folds and wrinkles. Notice,\nfor instance, that at some of the corners in the pseudospherical pattern we\nhave _eight_ “equilateral triangles” meeting. But if the pattern could be\nstretched out and laid flat on the plane, then one could have at most _six_\nequilateral triangles coming together at a single point.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to smoothly stretch out the whole pseudosphere in\nour space, we can stretch out pieces of it to get various bounded surfaces of\nconstant curvature. If we stretch out the central disk of the pseudosphere\ndiagram, it becomes saddle-shaped. Unlike the sphere, which at each point is\ncurving in the same direction, the saddle surface is at each point curving in\ntwo different directions. By being thus curved up and down at the same time,\nthe saddle surface stretches to be, in a sense, bigger than a flat disk.\n\n![img](Images/p109_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 107. A disk from the pseudosphere stretches into a saddle shape._\n\nA more dramatic example of stretching out a piece of the pseudosphere occurs\nif we take a sector that runs out to the “infinitely distant” edge. In figure\n108, what we do is cut along lines _e, e′,_ and _H-,_ then we stretch _e_ and\n_e′_ out to their “real” infinite length; and then we bend _H_ around into a\ncircle and glue _e_ and _e′_ together to make _E_. In the 1940s the figure on\nthe right was sometimes called the pseudosphere, but this is wrong. It is only\na sewed-together _sector_ of the pseudosphere. What, then, shall we call it?\n“Gabriel’s Horn” seems appropriate, because it is shaped like the bell of a\ntrumpet, and the mouthpiece of the trumpet is infinitely far away. The image I\nhave in mind is of some fearsome Judgment Day rolling around, and an angel in\nan infinitely far away heaven reaching a long thin trumpet all the way down to\nblast me in the ear.\n\n![img](Images/p109_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 108. A sector of the pseudosphere stretches into Gabriel’s Horn_.\n\nSo by thinking about what happens if we stretch pieces of the pseudosphere out\nto proper size, we begin to get an idea of the full surface. Recall now that\nwe started talking about the pseudosphere so as to have an example of a two-\ndimensional hyperbolic space. But what we really wanted to learn about was\n_three-dimensional hyperbolic space_.\n\nWhat is full hyperbolic space like? Imagine an endless three-dimensional space\nthat has somehow been stretched to be more spacious than flat homaloidal\nspace. Mathematically, one can model such a space by taking the inside of a\nsphere and assuming that the objects inside this sphere shrink endlessly as\nthey move away from the center. This is analogous to our trick of fitting flat\nor pseudospherical Flat-lands inside circles.\n\nIt is a very odd notion to think that perhaps our space is really the\nincredibly warped and shrunken interior of, say, a tennis ball. As Hamlet\nsays, “O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of\ninfinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.”\n\nThe idea of representing a curved space by a flat space that is to be\nstretched and shrunk comes from Bernhard Riemann. As an example of the\ngenerality of Riemann’s technique, we have indicated in figure 109 how a\nvariety of curved surfaces can be represented by assigning different lengths\nto the circumference of a fixed unit-radius circle.\n\n[PUZZLE 7.7](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch7pa7)\n\n_The Gabriel’s Horn surface shown infigure 108 has a very strange property:\nalthough its length is infinite, its surface area is finite. Can you think of\nany way to cut a unit square into infinitely many pieces and arrange these\npieces so as to make up an infinitely long surface with an area of one_?\n\n![img](Images/p111_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 109. Making the distances right_.\n\nOne can make the circumference smaller by bending the surface toward itself,\nor one can make the circumference larger by bending the surface in two\ndifferent directions.\n\nIf you make a fist you will notice some roughly hemispherical bumps where your\nknuckles are. Pause for a moment and think of the freckles of your skin as\nbeing 2-D galaxies in a “Flatland” whose space is the surface of your skin. A\ngalaxy located near your knuckle bumps might have inhabitants who believe that\nspace is spherical. A galaxy in the “saddle” between two knuckle bumps might\nhave citizens  who feel that space is stretched into a pseudospherical\npattern. And the little folks living in the flat expanses of your forearm\nmight take space to be a plane.\n\n![img](Images/p112_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 110. Your skin is an irregularly curved 2-D space_.\n\nIn this chapter we have looked at three kinds of 3-D space: flat space,\nhyperspherical space, and hyperbolic space. What these three kinds of space\nhave in common is that each of them is, on the large scale, uniformly curved.\nNo one region of space is essentially different from any other. But we should\nkeep in mind that the simplifying assumption that our space is of constant\ncurvature might very well be false. The shape of space may be stranger than we\nthought.\n\n![img](Images/p112_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 111. The shape of space may he stranger than we thought_.\n\n\n## 8\n\n##  Magic Doors  \nto Other Worlds\n\nJUST SOUTH OF BALTIMORE there’s a highway exit labeled “Brooklyn.” Wouldn’t it\nbe great if the exit led right into New York? Even better, wouldn’t it be nice\nto have a special kind of superdoor leading, say, from your living room to the\nTuileries gardens in Paris? Or, most exciting of all, how about a hyperdoor\nleading out of your space and into a totally different universe?\n\nPeople have always enjoyed thinking about such magical doors. The perfect\nsymbol of the mind’s freedom from the body’s spatial limitations, magic doors\noccur throughout fantastic literature, from Lewis Carroll to C. S. Lewis to\nRobert Heinlein. As a rule, writers of fiction have been very vague about how\nmagic doors might actually be constructed; at best one hears them explained as\n“tunnels through hyperspace.” But as it turns out, modern cosmologists have\ndeveloped some good ways of thinking about magic doors (also known as\nEinstein-Rosen bridges or Schwarzschild wormholes).\n\nTo get the picture, we turn as usual to A Square. Suppose that Flatland is a\nplane, and parallel to it is another plane called Globland. Ordinarily, there\nis no way that an inhabitant of one of these two-dimensional universes can get\nto the other universe. But suppose that somehow a flap of space from each\nworld has been snipped out, and say that the two flaps are sewn together. Now\nthe Globbers can visit Flatland, and the Flatlanders can visit Globland. I\nquote once again from that imaginary classic, _The Further Adventures of A\nSquare:_\n\n![img](Images/p114_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 112. A space strip connecting Flatland and Globland_.\n\nThe Other-Door which A Cube constructed was most singular. I recognize that to\na Spacelander the entire Connection appears to be nothing more than a strip of\nspace stretching from our Land to Globland. But to us the appearance was of\nthe Other-Door as a frameless, unlinteled door giving onto wholly new\nprospects. This, from the front. From the back, the Other-Door was black\nNothingness, a hole in Space. The entire area behind the Other-Door could be\napproached only at great risk. For here there was no Space at all; from here\nwas taken the Space necessary to build the Way to Globland.\n\n![img](Images/p114_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 113. The Other-Door_.\n\nI myself made the journey several times. The Globbers, though Irregular to the\nlast degree, are a pleasant folk, bucolic and accommodating. Several of them\nventured into our plane land, although for them the trip was not so easy.\nIndeed, more than one of them met an untimely end while traveling the Way from\nSpace to Space. Due to a certain awkwardness and grossness of Size, the\nGlobbers found it difficult to avoid brushing against the absolute Nothingness\nwhich bounded the Way. And from Nothingness there is no return.\n\nThe problem with the world-to-world hookup illustrated in figure 112 is the\npresence of lethal space edges. But there is a much better way to connect two\nplanes.\n\nAfter a day’s thought, A Cube reappeared in my study. Three highly placed\nWomen were visiting me, and the sudden materialization of the Cube’s cross\nsection sent them into an ecstasy of fear. In their eyes I was a magician, the\nCube my familiar spirit. I was eager to dazzle these lovely Segments;\naccordingly I played the wizard’s part.\n\n![img](Images/p115_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 114. A Square showing off for the ladies_.\n\n“Oh, Kitty, how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-\nglass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend\nthere’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the\nglass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s\nturning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get\nthrough —” She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she\nhardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass _was_ beginning to\nmelt away, just like a bright silvery mist.\n\nIn another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down\ninto the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether\nthere was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that\nthere was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind.\n“So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,” thought Alice: “warmer,\nin fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh,\nwhat fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here and can’t get at\nme!”\n\nLEWIS CARROLL,\n\n_Through the Looking-Glass,_ 1872\n\nI: How now, thou humble Hexahedron?\n\nCUBE: I’ve thought of a way to fix it. Square. I’ll pull the Way around into a\ntube and get rid of all the edges.\n\nI: ’Tis well. Go then and do my bidding.\n\nCUBE: What kind of talk is that?\n\nI: Begone.\n\nCUBE: Look here, you crummy flat …\n\nI: Godspeed, noble Lord.\n\nCUBE: That’s more like it. Later.\n\nThe apparition vanished, and Una, the loveliest of the three noblewomen,\npressed up to me, her natural sway an intoxicating flutter. I promised on the\nspot to escort her to Globland, or, as she chose to call it, the Astral Plane.\n\nWe found the Other-Door quite altered in appearance. Whereas earlier the\nOther-Door had appeared as a window to Globland from the front, and as a\nregion of Nothingness from behind, it was now the same from every prospect: a\nlenslike window which seemingly compressed the whole of Globland to the\nconfines of a Disk. My friend the Cube had in some fashion contrived to join\ntogether the edges of space where heretofore Nothingness had menaced the\nworld-to-world traveler.\n\nNo one had yet ventured through the altered Other-Door. Desirous of assuring\nmy conquest of Una, I courageously pressed forward to the mysterious Disk. It\ngave the strange appearance of a circular Mirror, such as ornament our Trees\nat festival time. Peering into it I could make out smaller and smaller\nGlobbers, ever-dwindling toward the inconceivably distant central Point. I\nfeared to enter, feared that I might be crushed by Shrinkage. But Una was\nvibrating at my side, urging me on with her low, melodious voice. “Come, Una,”\nI said, and slid forward into the weird Disk which somehow contained all of\nGlobland.\n\n![img](Images/p116_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 115. A Square and Una at the space tunnel’s mouth_.\n\nLooking into the inside, she saw several coats hanging up — mostly long fur\ncoats. There was nothing Lucy liked so much as the smell and feel of fur. She\nimmediately stepped into the wardrobe and got in among the coats and rubbed\nher face against them …\n\n“This must be a simply enormous wardrobe!” thought Lucy, going still further\nin and pushing the soft folds of the coats aside to make room for her. Then\nshe noticed that there was something crunching under her feet. “I wonder is\nthat more moth-balls?” she thought, stooping down to feel it with her hands.\nBut instead of feeling the hard, smooth wood of the floor of the wardrobe, she\nfelt something soft and powdery and extremely cold. “This is very queer,” she\nsaid, and went on a step or two further.\n\nNext moment she found that what was rubbing against her face and hands was no\nlonger soft fur but something hard and rough and even prickly. “Why, it is\njust like branches of trees!” exclaimed Lucy. And then she saw that there was\na light ahead of her; not a few inches away where the back of the wardrobe\nought to have been, but a long way off. Something cold and soft was falling on\nher. A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at\nnighttime with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air.\n\nC. S. LEWIS,\n\n_The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ , 1960\n\nThe Globbers had appeared quite shrunken and distorted before we entered the\nDoor. But now, as we pressed forward, they took on their familiar, albeit\nIrregular, appearance. Could it be that we had shrunken to their size? All\naround us lay the endless expanse of Globland. Was this really the interior of\nsome magical Disk? My thoughts were interrupted by Una’s excited cries.\n\nUNA: Oh, look, dear Square, Flatland is now a Disk itself!\n\nI (_turning to look back_): Indeed. Perfect Symmetry prevails. As seen through\nthe Space Tunnel, Flatland is a Disk in Globland, and Globland is a Disk in\nFlatland. All this have I wrought for your pleasure, my Lady.\n\nUNA: It is well, my Lord. My Husband cannot disturb us here in this enchanted\nLand.\n\nI: Then let us dally, fairest Una.\n\nUNA: Freely, my Lord … yet look into the Disk of Flatland. There slides my\nMate, A Hexagon!\n\nI: He is small and puny. He is an ant.\n\nUNA: But, oh, dear Square, he waxes as he nears the Disk’s edge!\n\nI (_to a nearby Globber_): How now, sirrah, wilst grant me a boon?\n\nGLOBBER: Blub, yubba, gloop.\n\nI (_seizing him with my Mouth_): Just stretch yourself (mmpf) like this\n(mmpfmmp) and this, dear friend. And in such wise do curtain our Seraglio.\n\nThe deed was done, and Una and I were free to take our pleasure. My perfect\ncontent was marred only by one question: How was it that passing through the\nSpace Tunnel turned Inside to Outside, and Outside to In?\n\n![img](Images/p117_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 116. A Globber blocks A Hexagon’s view of Una’s trans-dimensional\ntryst_.\n\nLooking at the space tunnel from outside the planes of Flatland and Globland,\nwe can see the answer to A Square’s question. The throat of the “wormhole,” or\nspace tunnel, is bounded by a circle in either world. A Flatlander looking at\nthis circle sees light from every part of Globland … Thus it seems to him that\nGlobland is somehow compressed to fit inside a circle. By the same token, a\nGloblander will see light from all over Flatland as coming from the circular\nthroat of the wormhole.\n\n![img](Images/p117_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 117. A Hexagon thinks Globland is a disk_.\n\n![img](Images/p118_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 118. Hyperspace tunnel to another universe_.\n\nJoe noticed something shiny lying on the next mound over. A bright little\nsphere, like a big ball-bearing or a silvered glass Christmas-tree ball. An\nodd thing to find in an asparagus field.\n\nHe hopped over the intervening mound and leaned over the little mirror-ball.\nThe sky was in there, and his face and the horizon and the field. Neat. But …\n\nWait. It wasn’t the _same_. The field in the little reflected image was pink\nand crowded with towering … machinery, tapering in towards the image’s center.\nWorse, the funhouse face looking back at Joe was not his after all … was not\nany living human’s …\n\nThe mouth was moving. Calling others. More faces crowded up. Two, three, five\n… small and distorted in the mirror’s curve.\n\nJoe gasped and stepped back, then stepped forward and gave the ball a poke. It\nrolled off the mound. Nothing in the image changed. The central figure was\nholding up a three-fingered hand and making signs. The vaguely female mouth-\nslash moved soundlessly. Over the figure’s head Joe could make out a tiny\nrocket-plane moving across the curved sky, moving away and away, dwindling\ntowards the infinitely distant central point. It was a whole universe in\nthere.\n\nRUDY RUCKER,\n\n“The Last Einstein-Rosen Bridge,” 1983\n\nNow, as we have done so many times before, let’s imagine raising everything by\none dimension. Imagine that there is another 3-D universe, “parallel” to ours\nin 4-D space. If we could move _ana_ through hyperspace we could get to the\nother universe. But we find it very hard to move in the fourth dimension. How,\nthen, could we ever get to the other universe? By traveling through a\nhyperspace tunnel, a so-called Einstein-Rosen bridge. What would such a\nhyperspace tunnel look like? The entrance to it would look like a sphere that\ncontained a whole other universe, incredibly shrunken and distorted. If you\ndived headfirst into this sphere, you would feel as if you passed right\nthrough it. But then when you looked around you would realize that you were in\nthe other universe now, and looking back at the hyperspace tunnel, you would\nsee a sphere that seemed to contain your whole original universe, incredibly\nshrunken and distorted.\n\nThere is actually a very familiar object that looks just like the mouth of an\nEinstein-Rosen bridge: a glass Christmas tree ornament. Such a spherical\nmirror reflects, in principle, the entire universe around it. The farther an\nobject is from the mirror’s surface, the closer its image seems to lie to the\nmirror’s center. Of course, if you were looking at the mouth of a hyperspace\ntunnel to _another_ universe, you would not see the mirror image of our\nuniverse, you would see what looks like the mirror image of another universe.\n\n![img](Images/p119_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 119. A collapsing star could form an Einstein-Rosen bridge_.\n\nIs there any way — short of the miraculous intervention of a higher-\ndimensional being — that an Einstein-Rosen bridge could actually come into\nexistence in our cosmos? Yes. If there are indeed some other 3-D universes\nparallel to ours, it might be that a sufficiently dense object could bulge our\nspace out enough to touch another space. And the two spaces might join\ntogether like two soap films that have been brought into contact.\n\nIn order to easily illustrate this, let’s just work with a cross section of\ntwo parallel Flatlands. As has been discussed, the presence of matter causes\nspace to bulge out. Now, just as a woman’s high heel will dent a rubber mat\nmore than a man’s larger heel, it turns out that _the denser the matter, the\ngreater the space distortion_. If our sun could be compressed to a much\nsmaller size, then it would distort space much more.\n\nThe sun is basically a ball of hot gas. The gravitational attraction of the\nsun’s particles for one another works to try to make the sun smaller. The\nthermal agitation of the hot gas particles works to try to make the sun\nbigger. The two forces balance out with the sun just the size it is.\nEventually, however, the sun will grow cooler. As it cools there will be less\noutward pressure, and gravity can work to make the sun get smaller and denser.\nThis compression heats the sun back up for a while, but eventually it cools\nagain, and contracts even more.\n\nAll stars go through this stepwise contraction process as they age. Depending\non the star’s starting mass, various final outcomes are possible. If at some\npoint a star contracts too rapidly, it explodes and makes a nova or a\nsupernova. If the star is not too massive to start with, it may contract down\nto form a solid, glowing lump of metal. If it is a bit more massive, it\nsqueezes down further by collapsing the metal atoms. Protons combine with\nelectrons to give neutrons, and one gets a fantastically dense “neutron star.”\nThese stars are made up of a substance called neutronium, which masses about\none billion kilograms per cubic centimeter.\n\nThe contraction is most dramatic if the star’s mass is so great that even the\nneutronium ends up getting crushed. In such cases the star shrinks down to a\ntinier and tinier volume … possibly even down to point size! Such super-dense\ncollapsed stars are the “black holes” that one so often hears about. The\nreason for the name is that if a star is dense enough, then its gravitational\nattraction becomes so powerful that light cannot escape the star. In other\nwords, a star that becomes dense enough takes on the appearance of a black,\nlightless sphere in space — a region that emits no light at all. Obviously it\nis difficult to “see” a black hole, but a variety of indirect observations\nseem to indicate that there really are quite a few black holes floating around\nin space.\n\n![img](Images/p120_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 120. A black hole absorbs light_.\n\nOf all the conceptions of the human mind from unicorns to gargoyles to the\nhydrogen bomb perhaps the most fantastic is the black hole: a hole in space\nwith a definite edge over which anything can fall and nothing can escape; a\nhole with a gravitational field so strong that even light is caught and held\nin its grip; a hole that curves space and warps time. Like the unicorn and the\ngargoyle, the black hole seems much more at home in science-fiction or in\nancient myth than in the real universe. Nevertheless, the laws of modern\nphysics virtually demand that black holes exist. In our galaxy alone there may\nbe millions of them.\n\nThe search for black holes has become a major astronomical enterprise over the\npast decade. It has yielded dozens of candidates scattered over the sky. At\nfirst the task of proving conclusively that any of them is truly a black hole\nseemed virtually impossible. In the past two years, however, an impressive\namount of circumstantial evidence in the constellation Cygnus designated\nCygnus X-l. The evidence makes me and most other astronomers who have studied\nit about 90 percent certain that in the center of Cygnus X-l there is indeed a\nblack hole.\n\nKIP S. THORNE,\n\n“The Search for Black Holes,” 1974\n\nAs indicated in figure 119, if a massive star or black hole distorts space\nenough, it is possible that an Einstein-Rosen bridge to another universe could\nbe created. Flying into the right kind of black hole might pop you out into a\ndifferent world. The theme of black-hole-as-gateway-to-other-realities is\namusingly used in the Walt Disney movie _The Black Hole_. At the end of the\nmovie, the good guys and the bad guys all fall into a huge black hole. The\nhole turns out to be an Einstein-Rosen bridge with two exits: heaven and hell!\nThis type of idea harks right back to the hyperspace theologians of Abbott’s\ntime.\n\nIt is also possible to have a wormhole, or E-R bridge, which leads back to the\nsame space it starts from. This could be very important. Here’s why.\n\n![img](Images/p121_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 121. The wormhole is a short cut from_ A _to_ B.\n\nAccording to Einstein’s special theory of relativity, nothing can travel\nfaster than light. This has always been a severe limitation for conscientious\nscience fiction writers. It takes light four years to get to Alpha Centauri,\nour sun’s closest neighbor … And any conversation or cultural exchange that is\nriddled with four-year gaps is going to be pretty dull to read about. If\nyou’re interested in traveling to another galaxy, the situation is much worse:\nour nearest galactic neighbor, the Great Magellanic Cloud, is well over ten\nthousand light-years away!\n\nSF writers have often avoided this problem by supposing that (1) our space is\nfolded back on itself, and (2) there are E-R bridges or wormholes connecting\nthe various folds. By finding the right hyperspace tunnel, a very long journey\ncan be cut down to manageable size. One of the first writers to use this\ndevice was Robert Heinlein, the father of modern SF. The analogy is to an ant\non a silk scarf. Normally it takes the ant a long time to crawl from one\ncorner to the other, but if the scarf is all crumpled, then by leaving the\nmaterial’s surface the ant can find a short and direct path through 3-D space.\n\n![img](Images/p121_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 122. A hyperspace hop_.\n\nOf course, being able to take a desired short cut depends on there being a\nusable E-R bridge at the right location. Some SF writers avoid this problem by\nhaving their space travelers _create_ E-R bridges as necessary. In Piers\nAnthony’s mind-boggling _Macroscope_ , the method of travel is to get inside a\nlarge object (say the planet Neptune), use some miraculous ray to make the\nobject collapse to black-hole size, and then zip through the black hole to\ncome out somewhere different!\n\nIf we could really manipulate the curvature of space at will, then there would\nbe an interesting alternate way of traveling through hyperspace. Instead of\nbuilding a tunnel or wormhole leading to another space, one could pinch a\nsmall hypersphere off our space and just float away. This could be risky, of\ncourse, as you’d have no way of predicting where and when your little space\nbubble might meet another universe. But one nice thing about leaving space by\npinching off a closed piece of it is that this doesn’t leave a hole behind.\n\n![img](Images/p122_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 123. A piece of space pinching off_.\n\nSo far in this chapter we have discussed how one might travel through\nhyperspace to other universes, and we have mentioned how this type of travel\nmight also be useful for finding short cuts from one region of our space to\nanother. One question we have not touched on yet is whether or not there\nreally _are_ any other universes.\n\nAs was hinted at in the last chapter, it is abstractly possible to treat the\ngravitational distortion of space as a type of stretching and shrinking of\nflat space — as opposed to the bulging out of flat space into some higher\ndimensions. Many scientists feel that “curved space” is just a colorful\nphrase, and that there really is nothing outside our three space dimensions.\nFor these somewhat cautious thinkers, the visible universe is all that exists,\nand any talk about alternate universes is just empty dreaming.\n\n![img](Images/p122_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 124. A Square traveling on a space sphere_.\n\nBut if we take the fourth dimension quite seriously, then it seems natural to\nsuppose that there might be other universes. All these universes taken\ntogether make up a much grander entity, variously known as the cosmos or as\nsuper-space. In traditional Christian doctrine, the cosmos has three parallel\nlayers: heaven, our world, and hell. The theosophists hold that the cosmos has\nseven layers, six of these being “astral.” A common notion in science fiction\nis that there are endlessly many parallel universes — with each possible\nuniverse existing somewhere. A variation of this last idea has actually been\nincorporated into modern quantum mechanics, and we will return to it in later\nchapters.\n\n![img](Images/p123_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 125. Parallel worlds_.\n\nProbably the least interesting viewpoint on the question of how many universes\nthere are is that which says: “The whole question is meaningless. No one has\nany idea how to detect another universe. Since statements about other\nuniverses cannot be subjected to immediate scientific testing, these\nstatements don’t really say anything at all.”\n\nSuch a viewpoint combines two assumptions: (1) _Seeing is believing_ , that\nis, if something is real we can find a way to observe it; and (2) _There’s\nnothing new under the sun_ , that is, we’ve already observed every type of\nthing we ever will observe. The first assumption is central to the\nphilosophical school of logical positivism, a modern outgrowth of traditional\nBritish empiricism. For the positivist or empiricist, the world is basically\nequivalent to the sum total of all possible sensory experience. I have no\nproblem with this — indeed, I will advocate a similar position in [part\nIII](18_Part3.html). It is the second assumption I object to. No one has _yet_\nfound a way to observe the other universes, granted. But this does not\nautomatically prove that no one will _ever_ find a way to “see” the other\nworlds.\n\nPeople speculated about atoms centuries before there was any hope of detecting\nan individual atom. And if no one had ever talked about atoms, the means to\ndetect them might never have been developed. Talking about other universes\nwould be a more respectable pastime if we could already see them. But unless\nwe go ahead and try to imagine ways in which this might happen, the day will\nnever come. We have already seen that something like Einstein-Rosen bridges\nmay exist as actual pathways to other universes. What I want to do now is to\nthink of some other ways in which these universes might make themselves known.\n\nJust so as not to be lost in a sea of possibilities, let’s limit ourselves to\none fairly reasonable model for the cosmos: four-dimensional hyperspace with a\nnumber of hyper-spheres floating in it. Each of the hyperspheres makes up a\nsingle universe. We might think of these hyperspheres as being something like\nbubbles in a fluid; alternatively, we might think of them as being like\nplanets floating in space. In terms of two-dimensional beings, we are thinking\nof a bunch of Spherelands.\n\n![img](Images/p124_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 126. Hyperspherical universes floating in hyperspace_.\n\n[PUZZLE 8.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch8pa1)\n\n_What would happen if the Globber infigure 116 were to choke the throat of the\nspace tunnel down to point size_?\n\n![img](Images/p125_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 127. Two spaces merging_.\n\nIf we are limited to the 3-D hypersurface of our hypersphere, is there any way\nin which we can become aware of the other hyperspheres? One very dramatic way\nin which this could happen would be if one of the other universes happened to\nbump into ours. Imagine what a Spherelander would see if his space bubble were\nsuddenly to bump into and join up with another space bubble. The effect would\nbe, in our terms, as if all the visible stars were to move out toward the\nhorizon, leaving room for a whole lot of new stars at the zenith! Of course,\nif the other space was considerably smaller than ours, the effect would be\nless dramatic. If a small hypersphere merges with ours we might perceive this\njoining-up process as the occurrence of an unusually bright spot in the sky.\nConceivably, the very distant and very bright light sources known as quasars\n(for “quasi-stellar objects”) are spots where small energy-filled hyperspheres\nare in the process of joining up with our own hypersphere.\n\n![img](Images/p125_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 128. Quasars_?\n\nBut are there any less large-scale and less obvious effects that might point\nto the existence of other hyperspherical spaces? In thinking about this\nquestion, it is helpful to imagine the situation of a man blind from birth.\nSuppose that he takes it into his head that the sun, the moon, the other\nplanets, the stars, and so on do not exist. Suppose he insists that space is a\nvast emptiness containing but one object: the spherical planet Earth. How\nmight you convince him he is wrong?\n\n[PUZZLE 8.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch8pa2)\n\n_An Einstein-Rosen bridge would look something like a spherical mirror, with\nthe odd property that the world in the mirror was actually different from the\nworld outside the mirror. Now imagine an ordinary flat mirror with the\nproperty that the world seen in the mirror is not the same as our world on our\nside of the mirror. What kind of connection between two spaces is being\ndescribed here_?\n\n![img](Images/p126_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 129. Blind and stubborn_.\n\nOffhand I can think of three approaches: (1) You might teach him to be\nsensitive enough to heat radiation so as to “feel” the sun’s passage across\nthe sky. Or you might couple a telescope to a photocell that controls the\nvolume of a little buzzer. Moving this telescope around, the man would learn\nto perceive the stars as “loud” spots. (2) You could get him to notice the\nrise and fall of the tides, and explain to him that this is caused by the\ngravitational pull of the moon. (3) You could get him to notice the various\neffects of the Earth’s rotation: the equatorial bulge, the so-called Coriolis\nforce, and the existence of poles. And then you could argue that if the Earth\nis really rotating, it must rotate relative to some other celestial objects.\n\nLet’s consider the higher-dimensional analogues of these three sorts of ways\nto notice other worlds.\n\n1\\. Unless another hypersphere actually touches ours, there is no way for\nlight to leave its space and come to ours. So we cannot hope to see it. So far\nas we know, any other kind of radiation would also be confined to the 3-D\nspace where it originates. So it does not seem very likely that any kind of\ntraining or equipment can help us “see” the other hyperspheres. Our position\nis, after all, really like that of a polygon on a Sphereland … not like that\nof a blind man on Earth. And there seems to be no reason that any one Sphere-\nland would send radiation to other Spherelands. A second difficulty here is\nthat even if some higher-dimensional radiation from other spaces did fall on\nour space, the radiation would not be focused at any particular spot. At best,\nthose regions of space that lie nearer to the other hyperspheres would be\nobserved to have more radiation in them.\n\n2\\. Gravity is not so much a type of radiation as a condition of space. It is\nconceivable that there could be a higher-dimensional analogue of gravitation,\naccording to which various four-dimensional objects would distort the\nhyperspace they float in. Just as the moon’s motion around the Earth causes a\nbulge to travel around the Earth’s surface, we can suppose that a nearby\nhypersphere might distort the shape of our own hypersphere. But present-day\nscientific apparatus is not even sensitive enough to measure our hypersphere’s\nradius — let alone “tidal” variations of the same radius.\n\n3\\. This approach is probably the most important one. Given that nonrotating\nspheres are virtually unheard of in our universe, it seems rather likely that\nthe hypersphere that makes up our space is itself rotating. And, as I will now\nargue, if our space is rotating, then it is almost certain that there are\nspaces outside our own. This last move will not seem immediately obvious: it\nis based on a fairly unfamiliar notion called Mach’s principle. Ernst Mach\n(1838-1916) formulated this principle to account for objects’ _inertia_ ,\ntheir tendency to resist being moved. The point Mach makes is that if an\nobject were totally alone in empty space, then it would be meaningless to say\nthe object is rotating or being accelerated. An object alone in empty space\nwould, in effect, have no inertia, no heft, no resistance to being moved.\nTherefore, argues Mach, the fact that an object on Earth has heft is a\nconsequence of the existence of all the distant stars and galaxies. By the\nsame token, the fact that we notice the Earth’s rotation is also the result of\nthe existence of the distant stars. Generalizing Mach’s principle to\nhyperspace, we conclude that if we can find evidence that our hyper-spherical\nuniverse is rotating, then we have good reason to believe that there are other\nuniverses, _relative to which_ we are rotating. O.K. Now the question is this:\nWhat kind of evidence for the rotation of our universe might we hope to find?\n\n![img](Images/p127_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 130. Spinning globe with hurricanes_.\n\nWell… How can the blind man tell that Earth is rotating? A major effect of the\nEarth’s rotation is that the Earth, instead of being a perfect sphere, bulges\nat the equator and is flattened at the poles. But, as was already mentioned,\nwe can’t even measure our universe’s curvature yet — let alone the deviation\nof this curvature from perfect hypersphericity. Another very important effect\nof the Earth’s rotation is the existence of the Coriolis force. It is the\nCoriolis force that causes hurricanes to rotate clockwise in the Northern\nHemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n![img](Images/p128_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 131. The Coriolis force in everyday life_.\n\n“I don’t know exactly how to tell you; it takes equations. Say! Could you lend\nme that scarf you’re wearing for a minute?”\n\n“Huh? Why, sure.” She removed it from her neck.\n\nIt was a photoprint showing a stylized picture of the solar system, a souvenir\nof Solar Union Day. In the middle of the square of cloth was the conventional\nsunburst surrounded by circles representing orbits of solar planets, with a\nfew comets thrown in. The scale was badly distorted and it was useless as a\nstructural picture of the home system, but it sufficed. Max took it and said,\n“Here’s Mars.”\n\nEldreth said, “You read it. That’s cheating.”\n\n“Hush a moment. Here’s Jupiter. To go from Mars to Jupiter you have to go from\nhere to here, don’t you?”\n\n“Obviously.”\n\n“But suppose I fold it so that Mars is on top of Jupiter? What’s to prevent\njust stepping across?”\n\n“Nothing, I guess. Except that what works for that scarf wouldn’t work very\nwell in practice. Would it?”\n\n“No, not that near to a star. But it works fine after you back away from a\nstar quite a distance. You see, that’s just what an anomaly is, a place where\nspace is folded back on itself, turning a long distance into no distance at\nall … The math of it is simple, but it’s hard to talk about because you can’t\nsee it. Space — _our_ space — may be crumpled up small enough to stuff into a\ncoffee cup, all hundreds of thousands of light-years of it. A four-dimensional\ncoffee cup, of course.”\n\nROBERT A. HEINLEIN,\n\n_Starman Jones_ , 1953\n\n[PUZZLE 8.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch8pa3)\n\n_In the last chapter, I said there were_ three _ways to fit Flatland into a\nbasement, but I only described two ways: bend Flatland into a sphere, or\ninfinitely shrink it to fit in a square. What is the third way_?\n\nHow does the Coriolis force work? To see it in operation, go to a playground\nthat has one of those hand-pushed merry-go-rounds. Get on, crank it up, face\nthe center, and let your right leg swing back and forth. What you will notice\nis that when your leg moves toward the center, some mysterious force pushes it\nto the right, and when your leg moves away from the center, a force pushes it\nto the left. This is a Coriolis force, resulting from the merry-go-round’s\nrotation relative to the rest of the universe. If the merry-go-round were the\nonly object in the universe it would be meaningless to say it is rotating and\nyou would, in fact, feel no Coriolis force. Returning to the swinging leg for\njust a moment, note that the net result of the Coriolis force is to turn a\nsimple swinging motion into a clockwise circling motion. It is the same force,\non a larger scale, that causes air masses to spiral in a clockwise fashion in\nEarth’s Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe fact that hurricanes tend to turn different ways in different parts of the\nworld is a definite asymmetry. If we could find some pervasive asymmetry in\nthe behavior of matter throughout space, we might suspect that this asymmetry\nresults from some overall property of the universe. I have no very specific\nsuggestions as to what kinds of asymmetries we should look for, but one\ngeneral principle is that we should expect to find the crucial asymmetry in\nthe domain of very small particles. Why? My feeling is that if our space has a\nslight thickness in the fourth dimension, then very small particles may enjoy\na certain four-dimensional freedom of motion, and thus be more susceptible to\ninfluences from hyperspace. The situation is complicated by the fact that the\nrotation of a hypersphere in hyperspace is more complex than a sphere’s\nrotation in space.\n\nBut enough of these subtleties. Whether there really are other universes is\nnot nearly so important as the realization that we are integral parts of this\none. The fabric of space joins us all together; we are all ripples on the\nbosom of the aether sea. Space is not some dead abstraction, but rather a\nliving and moving thing. We are patterns in space, and, strangely enough, it\nis not beyond our abilities to speculate on the overall shape of space itself.\n\n\n## Part III\n\n## HOW TO  \nGET THERE\n\n\n##  9\n\n## Spacetime Diary\n\n_Monday, November 15, 1982_\n\nIF IT WASN’T for time, I could live forever. Does that make sense? If it\nwasn’t for space, I could be everywhere. Is there a difference? I want to go\nback to my happy college days. I want to be a newlywed again. I want to be\nthree feet tall and sit on my mother’s lap. I don’t want to die. I want to see\nthe future. Time won’t let me. Let’s kill time. Let’s get past time. Let’s\nreach through time and grab hold of eternity. Now there’s no time. There’s no\ntime now.\n\n![img](Images/p133_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 132. Let’s kill time_.\n\nLater. Do you hate time? Alarm clocks, sure. Changing the clocks for daylight-\nsaving time is the worst. How can they just take an hour away like that?\nRemember in 1973 when Nixon took away _two_ hours for the oil companies?\n\n“The older I get, the faster time goes” my mother told me. “The years just fly\nby. Every time I turn around, it’s Christmas or Thanksgiving.” Party time\nspeeds up and slows down like an out-of-control movie. Ten minutes lasts for\ntwo hours, but the next time you look at your watch, it’s three in the\nmorning. Airport time. Sex time. Street time. Fast or slow, it all passes.\n\n![img](Images/p134_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 133. Fast and slow_.\n\nThat was my big realization twenty years ago. It all passes. Here I am at the\nbathroom door, and how can I ever get to the sink? How can high school ever\nend, how can I ever finish college, how can I ever be married? But then I’m at\nthe sink, I’m back out the door, I have a Ph.D., I’m married with three kids,\nand twenty years have passed. Here I am alive, and how can I ever die? But I\nwill, I know I will, I know it in my soul.\n\nDeath. It’s like the basic puzzle issued to each of us at birth. _Hi, you’re\nalive now, isn’t it nice? Someday you’ll die and it’ll be over. What are you\ngoing to do about it_? It’s awful, it’s terrifying, it’s enough to make a\nperson commit suicide!\n\n![img](Images/p135_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 134. It all passes_.\n\n_Philosophia perennis_ — the phrase was coined by Leibniz; but the thing — the\nmetaphysic that recognizes a divine Reality substantial to the world of things\nand lives and minds, the psychology that finds in the soul something similar\nto, or even identical with, divine Reality, the ethic that places man’s final\nend in the knowledge of the imminent and transcendent Ground of all being —\nthe thing is immemorial and universal.\n\nALDOUS HUXLEY,\n\n_The Perennial Philosophy_ , 1944\n\nIf time didn’t pass, I’d always be here now, writing this chapter. I’m scared\nof dying. I’d like to think that time doesn’t really pass. What I’m going to\ndo in this chapter is to present some scientific justifications for the belief\nthat the passage of time is an illusion.\n\nPeople ordinarily think of the world as being a three-dimensional space that\nchanges with the passage of time. The past is gone, the future doesn’t exist\nyet, and only the present is real. But there is another way of looking at the\nworld: we can regard the world as a _block universe_. When we think of the\nworld as a block universe, we put all of space and time together to make a\nsingle huge object. The block universe is made up of _spacetime_. Spacetime is\nfour-dimensional: three space dimensions plus one time dimension. To look at\nspacetime from the outside is to stand outside of history and view things _sub\nspecie aeternitatis_.\n\n“Spacetime” may sound like something technical and far removed from ordinary\nlife. But I would argue that it is really a more natural concept than “space\nthat changes with time.”\n\nSuppose you work in an office miles away from your house. At 7:00 you see your\nbedroom; at 10:00 you see your desk. One day at 10:00 you sit in your office\nand wonder what is real. If you believe the world consists of a space that\nchanges with time, then you are more or less committed to the view that the\npast is gone. So you will feel that your 10:00 bedroom exists, but your 7:00\nbedroom does not exist. Yet your 10:00 bedroom is not something you can _see_\n, sitting there in your office. Wouldn’t it be more reasonable to believe that\nthe 7:00 bedroom (which you _saw_ and can well remember) is real, and that it\nis the 10:00 bedroom whose existence is doubtful?\n\n![img](Images/p136_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 135. What’s real!_\n\nMy world is, in the last analysis, the sum total of my sensations. These\nsensations can be most naturally arranged as a pattern in four-dimensional\nspacetime. My life is a sort of four-dimensional worm embedded in a block\nuniverse. To complain that my lifeworm is only (let us say) seventy-two years\nlong is perhaps as foolish as it would be to complain that my body is only six\nfeet long. Eternity is right outside of spacetime. Eternity is right now.\n\nThis is not a new idea by any means. The teaching that all history is an\neternal Now is central to the classic mystic tradition. In one of his sermons,\nthe fourteenth-century priest Meister Eckhart expressed the basic idea as\nvividly as anyone before or since:\n\nA day, whether six or seven ago, or more than six thousand years ago, is just\nas near to the present as yesterday. Why? Because all time is contained in the\npresent Now-moment.\n\nTo talk about the world as being made by God tomorrow, or yesterday, would be\ntalking nonsense. God makes the world and all things in this present now. Time\ngone a thousand years ago is now as present and as near to God as this very\ninstant.\n\nWhether or not we share Eckhart’s beliefs about God, the image of spacetime\nbeing created all at once is a powerful one. Whenever I read his words I get\nan image of a big old man with a white beard flinging a bucket of paint at a\nbarn wall. _Splat_ : there’s all of spacetime, created all at once, created\nright now.\n\n![img](Images/p137_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 136. “God makes the world and all the things in this present now.”_\n\n_Tuesday, November 16, 1982_\n\nSpace is made up of _locations_ ; spacetime is made up of _events_. An “event”\nis just what it sounds like: a given place at a given time. Each of your sense\nimpressions is a little event. The events you experience fall into a natural\nfour-dimensional order: north/south, east/west, up/down, sooner/later. When\nyou look back at your life, you are really looking at a four-dimensional\nspacetime pattern. So there is nothing very strange or confusing about\nspacetime, as long as we are looking at it from the “inside.”\n\nLooking at spacetime from the “outside” is a little harder: four-dimensional\nthings are always difficult to visualize. Let us, once again, think about\nFlatland. Imagine that A Square is resting alone in an empty field, and that\nshortly after noon his father, A Triangle, slides up to him and then slides\noff. If we take time to be a third dimension perpendicular to the plane of\nFlatland, then we can illustrate these events by a spacetime diagram as shown\nin figure 137. Here A Square and A Triangle are wormlike patterns in\nspacetime. Their brief encounter at 12:05 is represented as a bending together\nof their lifeworms. Nothing really moves here; this is just an eternal pattern\nin spacetime. At 12:05 A Triangle is next to A Square; this is an eternal\nfact, a fact that can never change.\n\nTry to imagine a picture like figure 137 that encompasses the entire space and\ntime of Flatland. This vast tangle of worms and threads would make up what we\ncall the _Flat-land block universe_. You could think of making a model of the\nFlatland block universe by standing above Flatland and filming the action as\nthe polygons move around. If you then cut apart the film’s frames and stacked\nthem up in temporal order, you’d have a good model of part of the Flatland\nblock universe.\n\n![img](Images/p138_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 137. A region of Flatland’s spacetime_.\n\n![img](Images/p138_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 138. Flatland’s spacetime is like a stack of film frames_.\n\nBefore going any further, I should stop to answer a question that some of you\nmay be asking. _If we’re going to think of time as a fourth dimension, does\nthat mean that all the things we’ve said about the fourth dimension are really\nabout time_? The answer is _no_. Just as there is no one fixed direction in\nspace that we always call “width,” there need be no one fixed higher dimension\nthat is always called “time.” All our talk about the fourth dimension has\nenabled us to think of a variety of higher dimensions: a direction in which\none can jump out of space, a direction in which space is curved, a direction\nin which one moves to reach alternate universes. We can, if we like, insist\nthat the past/future axis of time is _the_ fourth dimension. And then we\npretty well have to say that the _ana/kata_ axis out of space is _the_ fifth\ndimension, and _the_ sixth dimension is the direction to other curved\nspacetimes. But there’s no point being so rigid about it. Nobody goes around\nsaying width is _the_ second dimension and height is _the_ third dimension.\nInstead we just say that height and width are space dimensions. Rather than\nsaying time is _the_ fourth dimension, it is more natural to say that time is\njust one of the higher dimensions.\n\n![img](Images/p139_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 139. Space + Time + Hyperspace, for Lineland_.\n\nIf we think of Lineland as being a one-dimensional (east/west) world whose\nspace bulges into hyperspace (_ana/kata_) wherever matter is present, and\nwhose space is different at different times (past/future), then we get a 3-D\nspace-hyperspace-time diagram as drawn in figure 139. Of course, if 1-D\nLineland were beefed up to a full 3-D space, the diagram would have to be 5-D.\nStaying with figure 139 for just another second, note that what is shown is\ntwo segments merging to make one large segment, and an extra-large segment\ngiving birth to a smaller segment. This picture makes up part of what we might\ncall the _Lineland block universe_.\n\nO.K. So now I’ve made the point that although time is one of the higher\ndimensions, there are many other possible dimensions as well. By the end of\nthis book I’ll be raving, and out-of-it, and saying space is infinite-\ndimensional, no doubt. But there’s still a lot more to say about spacetime and\nthe concept of the block universe.\n\nMany philosophers argue that it is wrong to say our reality is a block\nuniverse. They do not want to represent our past-present-future universe as a\nstatic 4-D spacetime pattern.\n\nThey feel that this eternal, unchanging image leaves out something important:\n_the passage of time_.\n\nOf course, the whole reason for introducing the block universe was to get rid\nof the passage of time. But how can I say that so universally experienced a\nphenomenon is nonexistent?\n\n_Wednesday, November 17, 1982_\n\nAnother day has passed, and here I am trying to claim that the passage of time\nis an illusion. What could be more ridiculous? I remember, about five years\nago, visiting my father in the hospital. He was having heart trouble, and felt\ndepressed. I tried to cheer him up by explaining the block universe to him,\nand by pointing out that one’s life is a permanent unchanging pattern in\nspacetime. “Rudy,” he said wearily, “all I know about time is that you get old\nand then you die.”\n\nIt certainly _feels_ like time is passing; I’d be foolish to argue otherwise.\nBut I want to show you that this feeling is a sort of illusion. Change is\nunreal. Nothing is happening. The feeling that time is passing is just that: a\n_feeling_ that goes with being a certain sort of spacetime pattern.\n\nLet me illustrate my thoughts with another excerpt from that imaginary\nclassic, _The Further Adventures of A Square_.\n\nThat afternoon my Father came to advise me of my impending Arrest. Una’s\nhusband had sworn out a Warrant of Complaint. Exhausted from my morning’s\npleasure, I scoffed at the old Triangle’s warnings and sent him on his way.\nWhat need had I to fear the vengeance of flat Polygons? Who of them could harm\n_me_ — friend and follower of A Cube? Filled by the delicious lassitude of\npassion spent, I fell into a slumber.\n\nIn Dream I saw the Sphere again, floating with me in some Higher Space. His\nsurface glowed with a solemn Luster, and I was seized with shame at my Vice.\nSeeking to dissemble, I called out a confident greeting.\n\nI: Hail, lordly Sphere. Long have I sought you, long have you lingered beyond\nmy ken.\n\nSPHERE: The Cube would teach you on his own. Space he has taught you, but now\nthat your Death draws near, I return to teach you Time.\n\nI: Why speak of Death? I have not sinned!\n\nSPHERE: Ah Square, so small is your knowing, so great is your baseness.\nWouldst lie to me, who sees All? I see your past, I see your future, and your\nfuture is fraught with Peril.\n\nI: What must I do to escape?\n\nSPHERE: Ask the villain Cube, when next you see him. Mayhap he knows some ruse\nto extend your Span. But it is all foolishness, your race is Mortal. The\nteaching I bring to this Vision is beyond your squalid struggle for more Time.\nMy Teaching is that Time is Unreal, and Eternity is Now.\n\nI: What kind of Death do you foresee?\n\nSPHERE: Silence, fool. Behold!\n\nAnd there before us I seemed to see a strange and intricate Form of three\ndimensions. It was like a Cube, but transparent and patterned all within.\nTubes and Worms and Threads ran from this strange Cube’s bottom to its top;\nsome of the Tubes were round in cross section, others were Triangular or\nSquare. The uppermost surface of the Cube looked familiar to me, and suddenly\nI realized it was my World.\n\n![img](Images/p141_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 140. A tangled tale_.\n\nThere slumbered my Square form, there was my Father’s familiar Triangle, and\nin the distance cowered a chastened Una. A Hexagon and an Isosceles were near\nmy sleeping form, evidently bent on Violence. Only my loyal Father’s\nintercession was keeping them at bay.\n\nAll this I saw atop the Cube. Moving my attention downward I could trace out\nthe whole tangled history of Love and Hate.\n\nThe Isosceles’s Point attracted my notice above all else, and I begged the\nSphere for aid.\n\nI: You will save me, will you not, most noble Sphere?\n\nSPHERE: Your salvation is not mine to grant. What is this object that we gaze\nupon?\n\nI: An ingenious model of some part of Flatland. There on the top is my\nsleeping Form, my Father, and …\n\nSPHERE: What of the Cube’s interior, Square?\n\nI: You have stacked up many models of my world, O Teacher. Each plane cross\nsection of the Cube displays a different instant of my recent (and regretted)\nCareer. It is indeed a clever Construct, an inspired use of Higher Space.\n\nSPHERE: Suppose I were to tell you this is no Construct? What you see is a\nhigher level of Reality. What you see is your Space and Time. This is your\nWorld.\n\nI: My Liege is pleased to be merry. This dead, unmoving Construct is to\nreplace the passionate bustle of Flatland life? One could as well say that a\npainting breathes, or that a statue weeps!\n\nSPHERE: The Teaching is strange, but it is no Jest. The block you see is a\nregion of Flatland’s Spacetime.\n\nI: Spacetime, my Lord?\n\nSPHERE: Space plus Time, thou Dullard. Hear the words of a great Spaceland\nthinker: _Henceforth space by itself, and time by_ _itself, are doomed to fade\naway into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an\nindependent reality_. Space is a shadow, Time’s passing is an illusion; only\nSpacetime is real.\n\n![img](Images/p142_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 141. The moving “Now.”_\n\nI: Again I must protest, O Round One. Life consists of change and Motion.\nWhere in this Construct of Flatland’s Spacetime is there Motion?\n\nSPHERE: You may _imagine_ the Motion as follows. Suppose that a plane were to\nmove up through the Cube of Spacetime. Think of the plane as a moving “Now.”\nFix your attention upon it, and you will see your Form dancing its sorry Jig.\n\nI: You are saying, then, that my conscious Mind lights up a cross section of\nSpacetime, and that the passage of Time is the upward motion of my Mind?\n\nSPHERE: I say no such thing. There is no motion in spacetime. Your Mind, such\nas it is, extends the length of your Span. More truly spoken, the Mind is\neverywhere, and you have no Mind at all.\n\nI: I do not understand you, my Lord.\n\nSPHERE: Nor do I understand myself.\n\n![img](Images/p143_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 142. Time as the motion of the mind’s eye_.\n\n_Thursday, November 18, 1982_\n\nThe purpose of the last dialogue was to present what the physicist David Park\nhas called “the fallacy of the animated Minkowski diagram.” A spacetime\ndiagram such as figure 140 is called a Minkowski diagram in honor of Russian\nmathematician Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), who was the first to think of\ndrawing such pictures. A Square says that such a diagram is lacking something:\nthe passage of time. We do not experience childhood, adolescence, and maturity\nall at once. We live through one stage, then the next, then the next, and so\non. A Square feels that figure 140 is just a _model_ , but that the reality\nwould be best represented by moving an illuminated plane up through the\nspacetime solid. First one cross section would be lit up, then the next, then\nthe next, and so on. In this manner the static Minkowski diagram could be\n_animated_ , or brought to life. If we think of the spacetime diagram as being\nlike a movie, it is as if A Square is saying that the movie needs to be taken\nout of the can and projected. If we think of the diagram as being like a\nnovel, it is as if A Square is saying that the novel needs a reader who goes\nthrough it page by page.\n\nBut there are a lot of problems with the notion of an animated Minkowski\ndiagram. One difficulty is that if we think of a static spacetime, and then\nimagine an external Mind, which sort of moves a searchlight up along it, we\nhave introduced a second level of time: the time that lapses as the Mind moves\nits attention through spacetime. Now, if spacetime is to be _everything_ ,\nthen it seems awkward and wrong to have a second kind of time lapsing external\nto it. With something like a novel, this poses no problem: the book\nincorporates its own time pattern, and the time it takes me to read the book\nis something else entirely. But we do not stand outside the universe like a\nreader outside a book; we are _in_ our spacetime.\n\nThat’s just my opinion, of course. I have, in fact, met people who do hold to\nthe belief that spacetime _is_ something like a novel being “read” by their\nsoul, the “soul” being some kind of eye or observer that stands outside\nspacetime, slowly moving its gaze up along the time axis. I find this\nunsatisfying.\n\n![img](Images/p144_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 143. Three animations of the same life_.\n\nIf your life is like a novel that your soul is “reading,” then the past is not\nso real after all. Even worse, death is just as real as ever: death is when\nthe soul runs out of spacetime pattern to “read.”\n\nAnother confusing point the animated Minkowski diagram raises is this: what if\nthe diagram is animated more than once? What if, in other words, there is a\nsecond “reader of the novel,” or a third, or a fourth, or infinitely many?\nWhat if a whole series of souls moves through your spacetime, living your life\nover and over? What if a whole infinite continuum of souls is moving up\nthrough your life, one at each instant at all times? But then your whole life\nis “lit up,” so why say any thing’s moving at all?\n\nThe very starting point of special relativity theory consists in the discovery\nof a new and very astonishing property of time, namely the relativity of\nsimultaneity, which to a large extent implies that of succession. The\nassertion that the events _A_ and _B_ are simultaneous loses its objective\nmeaning, in so far as another observer, with the same claim to correctness,\ncan assert that _A_ and _B_ are not simultaneous.\n\nFollowing up the consequences of this strange state of affairs one is led to\nconclusions about the nature of time which are very far-reaching indeed. In\nshort, it seems that one obtains an unequivocal proof for the view of those\nphilosophers who, like Parmenides, Kant, and the modern idealists, deny the\nobjectivity of change and consider change as an illusion or an appearance due\nto our special mode of perception. The argument runs as follows: Change\nbecomes possible only through the lapse of time. The existence of an objective\nlapse of time, however, means that reality consists of an infinity of layers\nof ’now’ which come into existence successively. But, if simultaneity is\nsomething relative in the sense just explained, reality cannot be split up\ninto such layers in an objectively determined way. Each observer has his own\nset of ’nows,’ and none of these various systems of layers can claim the\nprerogative of representing the objective lapse of time.\n\nKURT GÖDEL,\n\n“A Remark on the Relationship Between Relativity Theory and Idealistic\nPhilosophy,” 1959\n\n_Friday, November 19, 1982_\n\nWhat I want to say is that each of us is a certain spacetime pattern in the\nblock universe. Today, or the day of my birth, or the day of my death — all\nare equally real, all are different pieces of the block universe. I will never\nstop living this instant. This instant will never cease to exist; this instant\nhas always existed.\n\nAbout ten years ago I had a chance to meet the great logician Kurt Gödel. I\nused to phone him up and ask him questions about philosophy. In my book\n_Infinity and the Mind_ I have a section that describes a conversation I had\nwith Gödel about the passage of time:\n\nWe talked a little set theory, and then I asked him my last question: “What\ncauses the illusion of the passage of time?”\n\nGödel spoke not directly to this question, but to the question of what my\nquestion meant — that is, why anyone would even believe that there is a\nperceived passage of time at all.\n\nHe went on to relate the getting rid of belief in the passage of time to the\nstruggle to experience the One Mind of mysticism. Finally he said this: “The\nillusion of the passage of time arises from confusing the _given_ with the\n_real_. Passage of time arises because we think of occupying different\nrealities. In fact, we occupy only different givens. There is only one\nreality.”\n\nBy a “given,” Gödel means a person’s sensations at some particular time. At\nany moment the world “gives” us a collection of sights, sounds, smells, and so\non. By a more or less unconscious process, we organize these sensations into a\nstable framework. This background framework, which everyone agrees on, is\nreality: a continuum of three space dimensions and one time dimension. When I\nam in my office, I do not doubt the existence of my home. By the same token,\nwhen it is 10:00, I do not doubt the existence of 7:00. I do not think of a\nperson as an object adrift in space; a person is a certain kind of pattern in\nspacetime.\n\nA human body changes most of its atoms every few years. Daily one eats and\ninhales billions of new atoms, daily one excretes, sheds, and breathes out\nbillions of old ones. Physically, my present body has almost nothing in common\nwith the body I had twenty years ago. Since I feel that I am still the same\nperson, it must be that “I” am something other than the collection of atoms\nmaking up my body. “I” am not so much my atoms as I am the _pattern_ in which\nmy atoms are arranged. Some of the atom patterns in my brain code up certain\nmemories; it is the continuity of these memories that gives me my sense of\npersonal identity.\n\n![img](Images/p146_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 144. People are spacetime braids of atom threads_.\n\nIn figure 144 we have drawn a picture to represent the fact that people are\npersistent spacetime patterns. To simplify things we represent a person as a\nbraid of three atom threads (where an “atom thread” is the spacetime trail of\nan individual atom). Note that in neither of the two braid-people in the\npicture’s center do we have any single atom thread going the whole length.\nNote also that an atom can leave one person’s braid and become part of someone\nelse’s.\n\nWhat I find most striking about figure 144 is that the gray boxes enclosing\nindividual lives are purely _imaginary_. The simple processes of eating and\nbreathing weave all of us together into a vast four-dimensional tapestry. No\nmatter how isolated you may sometimes feel, no matter how lonely, you are\nnever really cut off from the whole.\n\nI find this insight a great comfort. Instead of thinking of myself as a\ndecaying bag of meat, I can think of myself as a part of eternal spacetime.\nThis is a way to cheat death. Instead of identifying myself with my specific\nbody pattern, I identify myself with the block universe as a whole. I am, as\nit were, an eye that the cosmos uses to look at itself. The Mind is not mine\nalone; the Mind is everywhere. If I do not exist, then how can I die?\n\n_Monday, November 22, 1982_\n\n“How can I die?” Well, I could have fallen off that broken viaduct I was\ndrunkenly standing at the edge of, Saturday night, just to show off. Ow. Why,\nat my age, do I still do things like that? _To prove that I have free will_.\n\nEvery so often, one likes to do something foolish or unexpected. Much of life\nis quite predictable, but it is the crazy zigzags that give human life its\npeculiar savor. It’s not really necessary to do something stupid and dangerous\n… Taking your wife out for dinner on a Wednesday night can be unusual enough.\n\nIf we are indeed spacetime patterns in a block universe, then the future\nalready exists. Does this conflict with the notion that we have free will?\n\nNot really. When I say the future is already there, I am _not_ saying that the\nfuture can be predicted. When you are halfway through a detective novel, the\nending is already _there_ , printed on the last pages. But this does not mean\nthat you can always guess what the ending will be. I feel that my entire life\nexists as a timeless whole. But this does not mean that I can predict with\ncertainty what I’ll write tomorrow, or where I’ll live next year.\n\nSometimes when I try to explain the spacetime viewpoint to people they say, “\n_If you’re just a pattern in spacetime and the future’s already fixed, then\nwhy don’t you kill yourself and get it over with? I mean, you’re going to die\nanyway, right? Why not shoot yourself?”_ The answer is simple: “ _Because I\ndon’t want to.”_ I may enjoy dramatizing the choice between life and death by\nstanding at the edge of a hundred-meter drop — but I’m damn careful not to\nfall off.\n\n![img](Images/p148_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 145. I don’t want to die_.\n\nIt is a plant’s nature to grow toward the sun, to bloom, and to bear fruit. It\nis a person’s nature to live and love and work. In all likelihood, there is no\nbig “Answer,” and life has no significance outside itself. But that’s enough.\nAs Don Juan puts it in Carlos Castaneda’s _A Separate Reality_ :\n\nI choose to live, and to laugh, not because it matters, but because that\nchoice is the bent of my nature … A man of knowledge chooses a path with heart\nand follows it … Nothing being more important than anything else, a man of\nknowledge chooses any act, and acts it out as if it matters to him.\n\nThe idea here is that your life is a whole, and the overall pattern is what\ncounts. The unexpected kinks in the pattern correspond to places where you\nfeel yourself to be making a free will decision.\n\nSome people object very much to this view. So strong is their belief in the\nimportance of their own free will, that they feel the future does not exist at\nall. They may grant that the past exists, but they feel that the block\nuniverse is something that is growing upward as time goes on. In figure 146 we\nillustrate this viewpoint, along with the block universe viewpoint, and the\nviewpoint that gives reality only to the present instant.\n\n![img](Images/p149_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 146. Differing world views_.\n\nThe great advantage the block universe has over the other viewpoints is that\nin the block universe there is no objectively existing “Now.” Nothing is\nmoving in the block universe, and there is no need to try to find some\nabsolute and objective meaning for the horizontal space sheet that the other\ntwo models depend on.\n\nAs it turns out, it is actually _impossible_ to find any objective and\nuniversally acceptable definition of “all of space, taken at this instant.”\nThis follows, as we shall see, from Einstein’s special theory of relativity.\nThe idea of the block universe is, thus, more than an attractive metaphysical\ntheory. It is a well-established scientific fact.\n\n_Tuesday, November 23, 1982_\n\nToday I want to draw a lot of Minkowski diagrams: pictures of spacetime. To\nmake things easier, we’ll think of space as a one-dimensional line, and we’ll\nthink of objects as points moving back and forth on this line. The spacetime\ntrail of a dot is called the dot’s _world line_. In figure 147 we see five\ndifferent sorts of world lines. _A_ represents a motionless point, and _B_\nrepresents a point that moves steadily to the right. _C_ is a dot that starts\nout motionless but then begins moving faster and faster to the right. _D_\nmakes an excursion to the right and then comes back to his starting point. _E_\nis in a steady state of right-left oscillation.\n\n[PUZZLE 9.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch9pa1)\n\n_If we say that the fourth dimension is time, then it is possible to construct\na hypersphere in space and time. How_?\n\n![img](Images/p150_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 147. Various kinds of motion_.\n\nIt is really a bit misleading to say that _A_ is motionless, and _B_ is moving\nto the right. If _A_ and _B_ are actual people, say astronauts floating in\nempty space, then all they can really be sure of is that they are moving apart\nfrom each other.\n\n![img](Images/p150_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 148. Three descriptions of the same state of affairs_.\n\nSince it is impossible to make marks on the fabric of space, there really is\nno such thing as absolute motion. The only kind of motion one can hope to\nobserve is the motion of one object relative to some other object. This is the\ncontent of Einstein’s principle of relativity: “The laws by which the states\nof physical systems undergo change are not affected, whether these changes of\nstate be referred to the one or the other of two systems of coordinates in\nuniform translatory motion.” In formulating his theory of space and time,\nEinstein makes one other assumption, the principle of the constancy of the\nspeed of light: Whenever someone measures the speed of light, he or she will\nalways come up with the same value _c_ (= 29,979,245,620 centimeters per\nsecond ≈ one billion miles per hour). These two assumptions have strong\nempirical support. Taken together, they lead to a number of surprising\nconsequences.\n\nUsually, in drawing Minkowski diagrams, one adopts a system of units so that\nthe path of a light ray is represented by a 45° line. Light moves at about one\nbillion miles per hour, so the idea is to mark off the space axis in units of\nbillions of miles and mark off the time axis in units of one hour. In figure\n149 we have marked the axes in this way, and we have drawn in the world line\nof a pulse of light. At time 1, _A_ sends a light flash off to the right. One\nbillion miles away stands _M_ , patiently holding a mirror. After an hour’s\ntravel time, the light hits _M_ ’s mirror and bounces back to the left. _A_\ngets out of the light’s way, and it continues traveling to the left\nindefinitely.\n\n![img](Images/p151_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 149. World line of a photon_.\n\nAs far as we know, nothing travels faster than light. It is interesting to\nrealize that you are never actually seeing the world _right now_. What you see\nis always slightly in the past, as it takes the light time to get to you; what\nyou hear is even\n\n![img](Images/p152_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 150. Sight is faster than smell_.\n\nA person has all sorts of lags built into him, Kesey is saying. One, the most\nbasic, is the sensory lag, the lag between the time your senses receive\nsomething and you are able to react. One-thirtieth of a second is the time it\ntakes, if you’re the most alert person alive, and most people are a lot slower\nthan that … We are all of us doomed to spend our lives watching a _movie_ of\nour lives — we are always acting on what has just finished happening. It\nhappened at least 1/30 of a second ago. We think we’re in the present, but we\naren’t. The present we know is only a movie of the past, and we will really\nnever be able to control the present through ordinary means. That lag has to\nbe overcome some other way, through some kind of total breakthrough.\n\nTOM WOLFE,\n\n_The Electric Kool-Aid Acid_\n\n _Test_ , 1968\n\nfurther in the past; and smells travel even slower than sounds. You see the\nsky rocket’s flash, you hear its explosion, you smell the smoke. Your\nsensations, at any given instant, are all signals from various events in the\npast. Even what you feel and taste is not happening quite exactly now,\n\n![img](Images/p152_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 151. One’s sensations all come from the past_.\n\n![img](Images/p153_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 152. Bug Bites, UFO Zooms, Moon Booms_.\n\nas it takes some time for nerve impulses to travel from your skin to your\nbrain.\n\nTo talk about “all of space, taken right now,” is really to speak very\nabstractly. You certainly don’t _see_ all of space right now. The tree you see\nis really the tree of a ten-millionth of a second ago, the moon you see is the\nmoon of two seconds ago, the light from the setting sun started out nine\nminutes ago, and the twinkling stars are scattered back hundreds and thousands\nof years in the past. In point of fact, you can’t see anything that’s\nhappening right _now_. You have to wait for the light to get to you.\n\nIt is, of course, possible for us to piece together some kind of mental image\nof space right now. Suppose, for instance, that it is midnight, and you are\nsitting outside, looking at the moon. A mosquito bites you, and then two\nseconds later you see the flash of some huge explosion on the moon. Since you\nknow that it takes light two seconds to travel from moon to earth, you can\nconclude that the “Now” that had you being bitten by the mosquito also\nincluded the explosion on the moon.\n\nSo far this does not seem to go against any of the viewpoints that hold that\nthere really is a spacelike “Now” moving forward through time. But there is a\nproblem with the way in which we construct our notion of “all space taken\nright now.” The problem is that if someone is moving relative to us, then he\nwill construct his spacelike “Now” in a different way.\n\nSuppose, to be specific, that a flying saucer had drifted past the Earth-moon\nsystem on that fateful night when the mosquito bit you and you saw a flash on\nthe moon. If the aliens happen to be moving from Earth toward the moon, then\nthey will actually reach the conclusion that the explosion happened _first_.\nIf they are moving from the moon toward the Earth, they will, in their frame\nof reference, say that the explosion happened _second_. The reasoning behind\nthese two claims is not obvious, and I won’t try to give it here.\n\nThe point is simply this: differently moving observers will differ on whether\nor not certain events happen at the same time. Nobody can really be _at_ both\nthe mosquito bite and the explosion. Whether these two events happen at the\nsame time is really just a matter of opinion; nature stipulates no absolute\nanswer to the question.\n\nThe phenomenon just alluded to is called the relativity of simultaneity. The\nimportant consequence of the relativity of simultaneity is that differently\nmoving observers will find different ways of slicing spacetime up into a stack\nof “Nows.” The three observers drawn in figure 153 could be peacefully living\nin three different galaxies that are moving relative to one another. What\nreason could we possibly have to say that one of the three ways of slicing up\nspacetime is correct, and the other two are wrong?\n\n![img](Images/p154_1.jpg)\n\n_Now and the future_.\n\n[PUZZLE 9.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch9pa2)\n\n_What kind of ideas about the past and future are embodied in this picture,\nwhere one thinks of the spacetime solid as being something like a block of ice\nthat melts from the bottom up_?\n\nSo relativity theory implies that there is no one preferred way in which to\nslice spacetime into a stack of “Nows.” Recall that relativity is based on the\nassumption that it is impossible to permanently mark a given space location.\nAnother way of putting this is that “right here” has no real meaning over a\nperiod of time. We have seen that this assumption, oddly enough, implies that\n“right now” has no real meaning over a region of space. Since there is no one\npreferred way of defining “Now,” it must be that “Now” has no objective\nmeaning. This means that there really is no moving present, and that the block\nuniverse viewpoint is the correct one. Spacetime is a single unified whole,\nand the passage of time is just an illusion.\n\n![img](Images/p155_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 153. Three ways to slice spacetime_.\n\n_Wednesday, November 24, 1982_\n\nThe special theory of relativity is extremely well tested. It makes a number\nof definite predictions about the behavior of matter in motion. These\npredictions have been borne out thousands and thousands of times in\nexperiments involving particle accelerators.\n\nYesterday I was discussing one of the very attractive implications of\nrelativity: the implication that we are eternal spacetime patterns in an\nunchanging block universe. But relativity also has some less pleasant\nconsequences. The worst thing about relativity is that it implies that we can\nnever travel faster than the speed of light.\n\nSome people get almost paranoid about this galling prediction. Without ever\nbothering to learn anything about relativity, they jump to the conclusion that\nEinstein was simply a dogmatic spoilsport not much different from the people\nwho used to say that man will never fly. “Why _shouldn’t_ we be able to go\nfaster than a billion miles per hour? If you get a big enough rocket and run\nit long enough, you can go as fast as you like, right? What’s the matter with\nEinstein anyway? Wasn’t he a German or a Jew or something? Un-American for\nsure, and probably scared of progress!”\n\nThere are, according to relativity theory, two problems with faster-than-light\ntravel. The first problem is that the closer any object gets to the speed of\nlight, the greater the object’s mass becomes. And the greater an object’s mass\nis, the harder it is to accelerate the object to a yet higher speed. It would\nrequire, in point of fact, an _infinite_ amount of rocket fuel to accelerate a\nspaceship up to the speed of light.\n\n![img](Images/p156_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 154. Past, Future, and Elsewhere_.\n\nIf I can never travel faster than the speed of light, then only a limited\nregion of spacetime is accessible to me. Those events that I can still reach\nwithout traveling faster than light are called my “future.” This is a use of\nthe word that is peculiar to relativity theory. Normally I think of my future\nas being those events I will actually experience, but here I am using “future”\nto mean all the events that I could conceivably attend or influence, without\nusing faster-than-light travel. In a similar vein, I can take my “past” to be\nall the spacetime locations from which it would have been possible to travel,\nin order to reach me here and now. The rest of spacetime is called\n“elsewhere,” a lovely word. It always relaxes me to think about events as\nbeing “elsewhere.” Whatever our leaders in Washington may be doing right this\ninstant doesn’t really matter: it’s “elsewhere.” Unfortunately, these\nimportant people’s actions don’t _stay_ elsewhere — my “past” is larger at\npoints further along my world line.\n\n![img](Images/p157_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 155. “Elsewhere” today, “Past” tomorrow_.\n\nThe second problem with faster-than-light travel has to do with the relativity\nof simultaneity. Given any event at all in your “elsewhere,” there will be\nsome observer to say it is happening at the same time as your “here and now.”\nThe whole of “elsewhere” is a sort of smeared out “Now.” Usually we think of\n“Now” as a line between “past” and “future,” but in relativity theory, this\n“Now” smears out into the hourglass-shaped “elsewhere.” What this means is\nthat one path into “elsewhere” is as good as any other. The trouble is that\nsome kinds of paths into “elsewhere” seem too weird to be possible. In figure\n156 I have drawn three paths into “elsewhere.” The top one is unproblematic;\nit simply corresponds to someone who travels two billion miles per hour, or\ntwice the speed of light. The next path is horizontal and, relative to the\ninitial frame of reference, seems to represent a person who travels billions\nof miles in no time at all. This corresponds to an _infinite_ velocity. The\nbottom path is the worst. Here the traveler seems to go backward in time. If\nhe were to return from such a trip along a horizontal path, he would be able\nto meet up with his own past self! In other words, faster-than-light travel\ncan lead to time travel — and many scientists feel that time travel must be\nimpossible. The trouble with time travel is that it leads to some really\nvicious paradoxes, paradoxes we’ll go into in the next chapter. For now,\nsuffice it to say that so far as we know, no chains of cause and effect can\nproceed faster than light.\n\n![img](Images/p158_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 156.

Seems like every time you turn around it’s Christmas\nor Thanksgiving.\n\n“The number of all the atoms which make up the world is, although excessive,\nfinite, and as such only capable of a finite (although also excessive) number\nof permutations. Given an infinite length of time, the number of possible\npermutations must be exhausted, and the universe must repeat itself. Once\nagain you will be born of the womb, once again your skeleton will grow, once\nagain this page will reach your same hands, once again you will live all the\nhours until the hour of your incredible death.” Such is the customary order of\nthe argument, from its insipid prelude to the enormous threatening dénouement.\n\nJORGE LUIS BORGES,\n\n“The Doctrine of Cycles,” 1934\n\n_Tuesday, November 30, 1982_\n\nAnother holiday over with. My mother came, and my brother Embry with his wife\nand two kids. It was nice to see the five little cousins enjoying it: the\ntreats, the wheel of the seasons, the eternal return.\n\nBorges has an interesting essay on the esoteric doctrine of “the eternal\nreturn.” This is the idea that _everything repeats itself_.\n\nMany things in our ordinary experience do repeat themselves. Exhale/inhale,\nday/night, summer/winter, parent/child: these are cycles that repeat\nthemselves endlessly. Obviously, my 1982 Thanksgiving is not _identical_ with\nall the other Thanksgivings. Yet, on some level, they _are_ all the same, at\nleast as regards the broadest features, the turkey and gravy, loud children,\ndrunkenness, quarreling, laughter, and prayer. At some point during a long\nholiday’s welcome ordeal, most of us will experience moments, or even quarter-\nhours, of transcendence, of timelessness, of that full acceptance of time’s\nfabric, which, paradoxically, sets one free from time entirely. The very\nrepetitiousness of human rituals provides some kind of glimpse into eternity;\nthe endless line is bent into a circle.\n\n![img](Images/p159_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 157. The Eternal Return_.\n\nDespite all this, the eternal return is still a very unlikely notion. Can\nanyone really believe that at some future time the universe will be in exactly\nthe same state as it is now? But this is what the doctrine of the eternal\nreturn asserts: there is some fixed length of time, some cosmic cycle, after\nwhich the entire history of the universe repeats itself. We might suppose a\nfull cycle to last, say, twenty billion years.\n\n![img](Images/p160_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 158. Endless, repeating time_.\n\nThere are two different ways of looking at a cosmos that has the property of\nrepeating itself. We can imagine that time extends to infinity in both\ndirections, and that space-time is made up of infinitely many identical\nhorizontal “stripes.” Alternatively, we can imagine that time is bent into a\nfinite, yet endless, circle. If a person is strongly committed to the “moving\nNow” viewpoint, then the first alternative will seem more attractive. If, that\nis, you believe that only the present has real existence, then you will feel\nthat even if the universe were to repeat itself, the next cycle would be\nsomehow different. But for someone who holds to the “block universe” view of\nspacetime, the second way of illustrating the eternal return will seem more\nnatural. If spacetime is indeed a solidly existing thing, then we have no real\nproblem with bending it into a “cylinder.”\n\n![img](Images/p161_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 159. Circular time_.\n\nSee, I answer him that ask-eth, “What did God before He _made heaven and\nearth_? I answer not as one is said to have done merrily (eluding the pressure\nof the question), “He was preparing hell (saith he) for pryers into\nmysteries.” It is one thing to answer enquiries, another to make sport of\nenquirers.\n\nST. AUGUSTINE,\n\n_Confessions_ , A.D. 400\n\nThe notion of “circular time” leads to some interesting paradoxes, which we’ll\ndiscuss in puzzle 10.5. But right now let’s go on and look at some of the\nother overall shapes that spacetime might have.\n\nKeep in mind that in all of these pictures, we think of the horizontal axis as\nbeing space, and we think of the vertical axis as being time. The horizontal\naxis is, if you will, our concept of “now,” and the vertical axis is our\nconcept of “here.” The event that we call “here and now” is, of course, the\npoint where the two axes intersect. One often “reads” these spacetime diagrams\nby imagining the horizontal axis to move upward as time goes on. But, as I\nhave repeatedly pointed out, it is not always necessary or desirable to\nanimate our Minkowski diagrams in such fashion.\n\nFigure 160 shows three kinds of spacetime. In each of them, space is infinite,\nstretching out endlessly in both directions; and in each of them, the future\nalso is endless. The models differ in the way they depict the past. The\npicture in the middle shows a universe in which all of space springs into\nexistence at once, and the left-hand picture shows a universe that has no\nbeginning in time. The right-hand picture shows a much odder situation, a\nuniverse in which different parts of space come into existence at different\ntimes. In such a universe there might be, for instance, a big hole in space\nout between Neptune and Uranus, a hole that would eventually shrink and\ndisappear. (In the picture I have labeled the event of such a hole’s\ndisappearance with the letter D.)\n\n![img](Images/p161_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 160. Three ways to start the universe_.\n\n![img](Images/p162_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 161. Circular space_.\n\nAnother type of spacetime model arises if we assume that space is\n“hyperspherical,” as was proposed in [chapter 8](17_Chapter8.html). In terms\nof Lineland, this would mean that space is a circle, leading to the kind of\npicture drawn in figure 161. Figure 162 shows an alternate way of viewing a\nuniverse in which traveling far enough in any direction always leads to a\nregion apparently identical with your starting point. Instead of showing space\nas curving back on itself, figure 162 shows space as extending to infinity in\nboth directions, and with spacetime divided into infinitely many identical\nvertical strips. A mysterious harmony would have to be invoked to explain the\nrepetition. Figure 161 is, of course, much more natural, just as a “circular\ntime” model was a more natural way of representing the eternal return.\n\n![img](Images/p162_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 162. Endless, repeating space_.\n\n[PUZZLE 9.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch9pa4)\n\n_Infigure 161, we drew a picture of a circular space that remains the same\nsize as time goes on. A widely held present-day view of the universe is that\nour space is an expanding hypersphere, which started out as point-sized about\ntwelve billion years ago. Can you draw a picture of spacetime that represents\nour space as an expanding circle_?\n\n![img](Images/p163_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 163. A pre-established harmony_?\n\nOne reason that I’ve been dating the sections of this chapter as I write them\nis simply to make a little fun of my argument that time is unreal. A more\nserious reason is that I feel like an Arctic explorer, keeping a log of the\ntrip as he pushes further and further into the unexplored waste. _At night the\nbarking of the dogs, the mad splendour of the Aurora Borealis_. The goal of my\nquest is a certain vision, a vision of the cosmos as a pattern in infinite-\ndimensional space. I want a comprehensive and absolute model for the world\naround me, a system that includes the realities of ordinary human life as well\nas the cold truths of science.\n\n![img](Images/p163_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 164. Onward!_\n\nUntil today I’ve been unsure as to whether I can finish the journey. But this\nmorning I caught sight of the goal. Reality is one, it is a thing that\nprovides an answer to any of the infinitely many questions one might ask; it\nis, in other words, a coloring-in of infinite-dimensional space. Stick with\nme, we’ll get there yet!\n\n\n## 10\n\n## Time Travel  \nand Telepathy\n\nWHY DOES TRAVEL have to be so hard? The perfect vehicle is easy to imagine: a\nsort of automobile with some special buttons on the dash. Get in, punch the\ncode numbers of where and when you want to be, turn the ignition key, and —\n_presto_ — there you are in 1920s Paris, on the Great Plains before the\npioneers, on the moon, or even in another galaxy.\n\nPeople have long dreamed of such a freedom from the fetters of space and time.\nIn one Grimm brothers fairy tale, the young hero gets hold of a “wishing\nsaddle” Get on the saddle, say where you want to be, and instantly you are\nthere. Science fiction writers variously call this teleportation,\ninstantaneous matter transmission, hypertravel, or FTL travel, where _FTL_\nstands for _F_ aster-_T_ han-_L_ ight. Closely related is the idea of time\ntravel, the ability to jump back to the past or forward to the future.\n\nWill time travel and FTL travel ever become a reality? Will the final conquest\nof time and space ever be ours? Speaking practically, the question is what\nsorts of physical phenomena might conceivably make time travel and FTL travel\npossible. Not much is really known here, but there is some chance that by\nmanipulating very massive systems — such as black holes — we could perhaps\ndistort space and time in such a way as to permit the kind of spacetime leaps\nthat time travel and FTL travel call for. Another path toward such travel may\nlead through quantum mechanics, with its hints that at the deepest level of\nreality, time and space do not really exist at all. If one could somehow\nmanage to repeatedly tune in and out of the spacetime framework, one could end\nup anywhere and anywhen at all. But no one has any idea of how actually to do\nthis.\n\n![img](Images/p166_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 165. Quantum mechanics_?\n\nAfter such tempting speculations, it is a little surprising to learn that most\nscientists reject the ideas of time travel and FTL travel. Even though no one\nhas ever tried to carry out tests of a time machine, most scientists are\nconfident that such tests would fail. Is this just blind prejudice?\n\nNot really. The problem with time travel is that it leads to physical\nparadoxes, to contradictions in the fabric of reality. And most scientists\nfeel that our world is too logically put together to allow the occurrence of\ndirect contradictions. The reasons for rejecting time travel and FTL travel\nare thus of an a priori nature: _Contradictions cannot occur in the world,\ntime travel and FTL travel can lead to contradictions, therefore there is no\nsuch thing as time travel or FTL travel in our world_.\n\nThis is a subtle argument, and well worth considering in some detail. First of\nall, what is really wrong with having a contradiction in the world? Don’t\ncontradictions happen all the time? I want a hamburger, and I don’t want a\nhamburger. A photon is a particle, and a photon is a wave. A zebra is white,\nand a zebra is black.\n\nThese are contradictions of a sort, but not really unbearable ones. The fact\nthat I both want and don’t want a hamburger points only to the fact that “I”\nam a conglomerate of conflicting desires. A photon is never observed to be\nboth particle and wave at the same instant. A zebra is black and white, but in\ndifferent stripes.\n\n![img](Images/p167_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 166. Yes and no_.\n\nAlthough our world may appear to have some contradictions in it, these\ncontradictions can ordinarily be resolved by making a finer distinction. But\nwhat about an absolute contradiction? What about some concrete, specific fact\n_A_ for which both _A_ and not-A are true? Here are two examples of what I\ncall _yes-and-no paradoxes_ in time travel.\n\n1\\. At age thirty-six, Professor Zone suffers a temporary psychosis. During\nhis period of madness, he murders his beloved wife Zenobia. He is found not\nguilty by reason of insanity, but, stricken with remorse, he decides to devote\nall his energies to undoing his wrong. He hopes somehow to go back and change\nthe past. On his fiftieth birthday, Zone finally completes his work: the\nconstruction of a working time machine. He gets in the machine, travels back\nsome fourteen years, and goes to look in the window of the house where he and\nhis dear wife used to live. There is his poor Zenobia, and there is that mad\nkiller, Zone-36. Zone-50 had hoped to arrive early enough to talk some sense\ninto Zone-36, but the crucial moment is already at hand! Zone-36 is stalking\nZenobia, a heavy pipe wrench raised high overhead! Without stopping to think,\nZone-50 aims his bazooka and shoots mad Zone-36 through the heart. _The\nParadox_ : If Zone-36 dies, then there can be no Zone-50 to come back and kill\nZone-36. If Zone-36 does not die, then there will be a Zone-50 to come back\nand kill Zone-36. Does Zone-36 die? _Yes and no_.\n\n![img](Images/p168_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 167. Professor Zone_.\n\n2\\. On Monday the Beagle Boys steal Uncle Scrooge’s new time machine. They use\nit to pop into the future and find out who will win the big horse race on\nWednesday. It’ll be Ole Plug, a hundred-to-one shot! Back on Monday they\nwonder how to get enough money to bet. All they have is one lousy dollar, and\nthe minimum bet is two bucks. “I’ve got it.” Beagle Boy 22-03-46 grins. “On\nThursday we’ll send one of our two hundred greenbacks back to Tuesday. That\nway on Wednesday we’ll have the two smackers to put on Ole Plug!” Tuesday,\nsure enough, a dollar bill appears in their hideout. Wednesday Ole Plug wins,\njust as they knew he would, and the Beagle Boys all go out to celebrate.\nUnfortunately, they overdo it a bit, and on Thursday they’re down to one lousy\ndollar again. “O.K.,” says 22-03-46, “time to send this dollar back to\nTuesday!” “Forget it,” answers young 2308-69. “I’m taking this dollar to buy a\ncan of beans.” 23-0869 snatches the bill away from 22-03-46, and leaves. _The_\n_Paradox_ : Since the dollar appeared Tuesday, they must have sent it back\nfrom Thursday. Yet, when the time comes, they _don’t_ send it back. Do they\nsend a dollar back? _Yes and no_.\n\nThese paradoxes are, on one level, little more than amusing intellectual\ngames. One tends to feel there is always some way to weasel out. What if\nZone-50 actually went to the wrong house? What if 22-03-46, worried about the\nparadox, manages to get a dollar on Friday and _then_ sends it to the Tuesday\nBeagle Boys? But you can’t always be sure of lucking out. Time travel can lead\nto irreconcilable paradoxes. I’d like now to present a nice, clean version of\nsuch a paradox, in terms of a Minkowski diagram.\n\n![img](Images/p169_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 168. Two SF dreams_.\n\nKeep in mind that in these spacetime diagrams, the horizontal direction is\nspace (Lineland, strictly speaking), and the vertical direction is time. World\nlines involving time travel and FTL travel would look something like the\ndiagrams in figure 168. In each case I have used a dotted line for the part of\nthe world line that represents the “jump.” I do this to suggest that such\njumps, if at all possible, would probably be done by somehow moving out of\nnormal spacetime to travel through some higher dimension. A second point worth\nmaking here is that if you are going to time-travel to your own past, it is\nwise to do it while you are in motion. Otherwise you may jump to a place\noccupied by your past self, and there could be a nasty explosion. So the time\ntraveler in figure 168 is moving slowly to the right both before and after his\njump. (We will assume that the time machine jumps back to the same position,\n_relative to the laboratory_ , that it jumps from.)\n\n![img](Images/p170_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 169. A two-minute jump back_.\n\nNow for the paradox. Suppose that I build a small time machine capable of\ntransporting itself two minutes back in time. Around 11:55 A.M. I set it\nslowly rolling to the right on my laboratory bench, and with a timer switch\nset to initiate the jump at 12:01. I sit there watching, and at 11:59 there\nare suddenly two time machines on my bench: _M_ , the one that has not yet\njumped, and _M*_ , the one that has jumped back from the future. For two\nminutes both machines are there, and then at 12:01 the timer switch goes off\nand M disappears. After 12:01 I am left only with _M*_ , which is really a\nlater version of _M_.\n\n![img](Images/p170_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 170. Two time machines_.\n\nSo far, so good. Now we introduce the paradox. Suppose that for safety reasons\nmy time machine _M_ is equipped with a sonar device to make sure that the\nlaboratory bench is clear before any jump takes place. If _M_ senses any other\nobject on the bench with it at 12:01, then it overrides the timer switch and\nrefuses to jump. Now repeat the experiment. What happens?\n\nI suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder\nat what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one hand\nand the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately\nthe second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and,\nlooking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened?\nFor a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the\nclock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten;\nnow it was nearly half-past three!\n\nI drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and\nwent off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett\ncame in, and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I\nsuppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed\nto shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its\nextreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in\nanother moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter\nand ever fainter. Tomorrow night came black, then day again, night again, day\nagain, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a\nstrange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n\nH. G. WELLS,\n\n_The Time Machine_ , 1895\n\nIf _M*_ appears at 11:59, then it will still be around at 12:01, and _M_ will\nsense it with its sonar. If _M_ senses _M*_ , then _M_ will refuse to make the\njump. And if no jump takes place, then _M*_ does not appear at 11:59.\n\nIf _M*_ does not appear at 11:59, then the bench will be clear at 12:01, and\n_M_ will make the jump as planned. If _M_ makes the jump, then _M*_ appears at\n11:59.\n\nConclusion? _M*_ appears at 11:59 if and only if _M*_ does not appear at\n11:59. Now, one of the two alternatives must actually happen: either _M*_\nappears or it doesn’t. But we have just proved that if either alternative\nhappens, then the other alternative happens as well. So _M*_ appears on the\nlaboratory bench at 11:59, and _M*_ does not appear on the laboratory bench at\n11:59. Does _M*_ appear? _Yes and no_.\n\nIt is very hard to imagine a world in which such a logically contradictory\nstate of affairs is possible. Since the existence of a time machine can lead\nto such a contradiction, many scientists feel that time machines are logically\nimpossible.\n\nFurther, it is possible to show that any FTL travel machine can be adapted to\nbecome a time machine. The argument, which we briefly mentioned in the last\nchapter, hinges on what Einstein dubbed the relativity of simultaneity.\nLoosely speaking, the idea is that once you travel faster than light, you are\nin fact traveling into the past relative to some observers. Once this is\naccomplished, you can change your speed in such a way as to end up in your own\npast. In other words, an FTL traveler can return from his trip before he\nleaves — and this is time travel.\n\nSince FTL travel leads to time travel, and time travel leads to logical\ncontradiction, many scientists feel it is also possible to rule out FTL travel\nby a priori reasoning.\n\nHow strong are these arguments, really? Returning to our “disproof” of time\ntravel, there seem to be three kinds of loopholes. (1) What if there were time\nmachines, but no one ever used them to produce contradictions? Perhaps some\nkind of “Time Police” might be recruited to prevent such experiments. Or maybe\nthe cosmos would, in the interest of self-preservation, strike dead anyone\nabout to perform a paradoxical time travel experiment! (2) Maybe there can\nactually be contradictions in the fabric of reality. It is, perhaps, not\n_completely_ impossible to think of an _M*_ that both appears and does not\nappear. Maybe contradictions are rare, but not totally ruled out. After all,\nthere is a sense in which the very existence of our world is a contradiction:\nfor how could something come from nothing? (3) Perhaps there is some more\nrefined sense of the word _exist_ under which something could manage both to\nexist and not exist. If there were many parallel universes, for instance, then\nwe could have _M*_ existing in some and not existing in others. The simplest\nsolution along these lines would be to postulate that a time machine always\ntravels to the past of some world other than the world it starts out in.\nParadoxes arise only if you go into your _own_ past and do something like\nsmothering your own grandfather in his cradle. If you kill some poor baby in a\nparallel world, no contradiction comes up.\n\n![img](Images/p172_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 171. “Time travel” to another universe_.\n\nIf we redraw our two-minute time machine paradox in terms of parallel worlds\nwe get figure 171. When the machine jumps back in time, it also jumps over to\na different sheet of spacetime, as indicated. In a situation like this, all\nyou would see would be the disappearance of your “time machine” at 12:01.\nYou’d probably never see the machine again — though if it was programmed to do\nfurther jumps it might conceivably reappear in your laboratory at some future\ntime. Most science fiction writers use this notion of parallel universes to\navoid the paradoxes of time travel. Strictly speaking, of course, travel to a\nparallel world is not time travel at all.\n\n![img](Images/p173_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 172. The three freedoms_.\n\nIt is interesting to put into one diagram the three kinds of “special travel”\nthat appear over and over in science fiction tales: time travel, travel to\nalternate worlds, and FTL travel. These correspond to three mutually\nperpendicular types of motion. The great popular appeal of these kinds of\ntravel is that they promise freedom from the fetters of the human condition.\nTime travel sets one free from the blind juggernaut of time, free from\nfruitless nostalgia. FTL travel frees one from the obstinate tyranny of\nphysical distance, from the dull necessities of actual travel. Travel to\nalternate worlds frees one from having to occupy any fixed position in\nsociety, and frees one from having to accept the world as it is. At the\ndeepest level there is really not that much psychological difference among the\nthree sorts of travel; each provides a magical escape from the here-and-now-\nand-how. Rationally, we all know that we can change our lives if we really\nwant to: you take a vacation, you find a new job, you sell your house and\nmove. But making a big change is so hard. How much easier it would be to just\nget in a machine and push some buttons!\n\nSo far we have discussed only one basic type of time travel paradox, the yes-\nand-no paradox. There is another, less vicious kind of time travel paradox,\nthe _closed causal loop_. Here are two examples.\n\n![img](Images/p173_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 173.

An inventor is in his laboratory, struggling to assemble a working time\nmachine. Suddenly there is a flash of light, and a man from the future\nappears, riding a lovely time machine. “I’m an historian,” says the man from\nthe future. “I want to interview you, as you are the inventor of the time\nmachine.” “But I don’t know how to build one yet,” replies the inventor. “I\ndon’t know if I’ll _ever_ get it right.” “Well, here,” says the helpful\nhistorian, “just look my time machine over, and build yourself a copy of it.”\n_Who invents the time machine_?\n\n2\\. In 1969 the childless yet kindly Goodcheese couple find a baby girl on\ntheir doorstep. They name her Cynthia and raise her like a daughter. Cynthia\nshows an incredible aptitude for physics and earns her Ph.D. from Cal Tech at\nage nineteen. She falls in love with Randy Crassman, a young biologist deeply\ninvolved with cloning research. Foundations shower money upon them. Cynthia\nconstructs the world’s first time machine, and Randy manages to get one of\nCynthia’s cells to grow into an exact copy of baby Cynthia herself. A\nconservative faction takes over the government and rules that the cloned baby\nmust be destroyed. Tearfully, Cynthia puts the baby into her time machine and\nsends it back to 1969. The baby, as chance would have it, lights on the\ndoorstep of the childless yet kindly Goodcheese couple. _Where did Cynthia\nreally come from_?\n\nA simple “laboratory” example of a closed causal loop would be the following.\nOne morning I come into my laboratory and putter around, cleaning off my\nworkbench. At 11:59, to my surprise, a small two-minute time machine appears\non the bench. To test if it really works, I set it to jump back two minutes at\n12:01. At 12:01 it disappears.\n\nIn figure 174 we can see the loop very clearly. There’s no actual\ncontradiction here, but it’s certainly a weird situation. At first one may be\ntempted to think of the little time machine as circling around and around the\nloop. This temptation should be resisted! If we stick to the spacetime\nviewpoint, we do not have to imagine that anything in figure 174 is actually\n_moving_. There is simply a circular loop here, a circle with no beginning and\nno end.\n\nSuch closed causal loops are not ruled out in modern physics. Far from it!\nAccording to quantum mechanics, empty space actually seethes with little\nmatter / antimatter loops. The idea is that energy, such as is carried by a\nphoton of light, can be briefly converted into mass, and then reconverted back\ninto energy. At a given point, one might have an electron and a positron\nemerging out of nothing, only to bump back into each other and disappear.\n\n![img](Images/p175_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 174. A closed causal loop_.\n\nThe reason we might think of this as a closed causal loop is that a positron\nis sometimes thought of as an electron that goes backward in time. A\n_positron_ , I should explain, is a particle with exactly the same mass, spin,\nsize, and so on, as an electron. The only difference between the two is that\nthe electron carries a charge of _minus_ one, and the positron carries a\ncharge of _plus_ one. These matched particles are said to be a matter /\nantimatter pair because whenever an electron and a positron get close to each\nother they disappear in a flash of light. This process is called _mutual\nannihilation_. The other side of the coin is that whenever you create an\nelectron out of nothing, you also have to create a positron at the same time.\nThis process is called _pair production_.\n\n![img](Images/p175_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 175. A pattern in the mass-energy dance_.\n\nThe kind of process illustrated in figure 175 is known to happen very\ncommonly. If we look at it in terms of the “moving Now” viewpoint, it seems a\nlittle surprising that the electron and positron manage so neatly to appear\nand disappear together. But according to physicist Richard Feynman, one can\ntake a spacetime viewpoint and regard the positron as an electron that is\ntraveling backward in time. From this standpoint we simply have a nice little\nclosed causal loop.\n\nThe notion of a particle “moving backward in time” is not really taken too\nseriously by the physicists. It is more a mathematical fiction than an actual\nphenomenon. No physicist, as far as I know, entertains hopes of using a beam\nof positrons to somehow send signals into the past. But once you start\nthinking in these terms it is hard to stop. What would it be like to actually\nlive part of one’s life backward in time? A few years ago I wrote a very short\nstory in which the heroine goes around a “corner in time.” Here it is,\ncomplete with Minkowski diagram:\n\n![img](Images/p176_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 176. Diagram for “A New Experiment with Time.”_\n\nA NEW EXPERIMENT WITH TIME\n\nThe first thing the citizens of Bata notice is a greasy place in the street. A\nfat man slips on it. Bill Stook comes down in the yellow pickup with the\nsmashed fender and throws on a bucket of sand.\n\nLet us imagine an Intelligence who would know at a given instant of time all\nforces acting in nature and the position of all things of which the world\nconsists; let us assume, further, that this Intelligence would be capable of\nsubjecting all these data to mathematical analysis. Then it could derive a\nresult that would embrace in one and the same formula the motion of the\nlargest bodies in the universe and of the lightest atoms. Nothing would be\nuncertain for this Intelligence. The past and the future would be present to\nits eyes.\n\nPIERRE-SIMON LAPLACE,\n\n_Theory of Probability_ , 1812\n\nA week later the patch begins to stink. The stuff has thickened and drawn\ntogether. There’s lots of flies that come and land on your face afterwards.\nThe kindergarten teacher twists her ankle. Black high-heels and a thin summer\ndress.\n\nStook comes back with a shovel, but he can’t get the stuff loose. A few idlers\n— day tripping feebs — give their advice, spit-talking about glare-ice and\nmineral oil. Finally Stook throws on some more sand and goes home.\n\nUnder the arc-lights the patch is elliptical, four by eight feet. It cuts\nacross the crosswalk and both lanes of traffic. The tire-marks on it extend\nout into straight smears in either direction. A dog has dropped a bone in the\nmiddle.\n\nMaisie Gleaves lives in a Buffalo rooming house. She is black and white, with\nred lipstick and a christmas-green raincoat. Every night she lies on her bed,\nlooking at her Bata High School yearbook. Two years now. Somehow she will go\nback.\n\nWorkmen are putting up a banner saying, BATA SIDEWALK SALE DAYS. Meanwhile a\ngroup of men, shopkeepers, inspect the stinking patch of pulp. One of them\ntries to pick up a bone. His fingers slide off it. It’s an outrage. Bill Stook\nis called and threatened with dismissal.\n\nHe covers the patch with sawdust and puts a refreshment stand around it.\nSIDEWALK SALE DAYS. In the hot sun, people order hot dogs, catch a whiff of\ndecay and put on more mustard. Stook mans the booth, nipping whiskey from a\npint bottle. The flattened lump underfoot feels springy.\n\nA white sunset slides under low clouds. They dismantle the booth and the\nsawdust blows away. Mashed arms and legs, tooth cracklings, scraps of green\ncloth. The tire tracks are gone from the flattened corpse. The state police\ntake Stook away.\n\nMaisie watches Buffalo TV in a silver diner. Trouble in Bata. She remembers\nall the lost faces. Ron. She pays for her tea. Back in her room she stares\ninto the mirror for two hours. Her image is moving closer.\n\nSleeping or waking, it’s all the same now. No more boundaries. Something is\ncoming nearer, growing to connect. She lives on air and thinks only of Bata.\nShe will return.\n\nBit by bit the corpse grows whole. Slowly the bones link up, imperceptibly the\nflesh crawls back. One night the face is finished. In the dark is begins to\ntwitch unseen.\n\nStook is out on bail. He is driving a stolen truck, the pickup they used to\nlet him use. All his rage and bitterness is focused on the corpse in the\nstreet. He speeds towards it, past the guards, through the sawhorses. A\nscreech of brakes, a thud. Suddenly his crumpled fender is smooth. The corpse\nwalks off backwards.\n\nStook runs after the skinny corpse, a woman. She minces backwards towards the\nbus stop, glaring at him. He catches up as she climbs into the bus to Buffalo.\nHe tries to grab her, but it’s impossible. He cannot alter her past.\n\nMaisie leaves her room and walks. A block ahead she sees a black and white\nwoman in a christmas-green coat climb off the bus from Bata. She is walking\nbackwards, this woman. Maisie hastens to meet her.\n\n![img](Images/p178_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 177. Maisie Gleaves_.\n\nThe two figures merge and are no more. A cabbie sees them disappear into each\nother. For Maisie it is different. She walks through the flash and down the\nstreet.\n\nEverything is running backwards. Maisie is going back through time, back to\nBata. The bus backs up to where she’d seen herself get out. Ticketless, she\nclimbs in the exit door and sits down. She is nervous. The bus is going forty\nmiles per hour in reverse.\n\nAs the bus backs out of Buffalo onto the Thruway, the man sitting next to\nMaisie begins staring at her. He says something backwards, a drooling gabble.\nShe answers anyway. He turns and stares out the dark window. She spoke because\nhe spoke; he spoke because she spoke. He picks off a wad of gum from under his\nseat and begins chewing it.\n\nWhen the bus leaves the Thruway and backs past the old filling-station, she\nwalks to the door. It opens, and she goes down the steps. Bata. She’s glad she\nwaited so long. She’ll get a room here, and in two years she’ll be back in\nhigh-school. Ron. This time it will work out right.\n\nA short, red-faced man is blocking her way. She sets her face and walks\ntowards him. He backs off, drawing farther and farther away. There are police\naround a pickup parked in the intersection. But there is no traffic.\n\nThe little man scuttles crablike into the cab of the pickup. Just to scare\nhim, she walks right up to it, right up to the fender. There is a sudden jolt.\nThe pickup squeals its brakes and backs away.\n\nThe story was designed as a sort of thought experiment. The idea is that a\nuniverse that has some spacetime patterns other than ordinary cause and effect\nis at least _conceivable_. We cannot very easily imagine a mechanism that\nwould actually make Maisie Gleaves turn a corner in time, but a spacetime that\nhas such a corner is still comprehensible to us. For the rest of this chapter\nI want to discuss the idea that our spacetime may actually have patterns other\nthan those introduced by simple cause and effect.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, people used sometimes to think of the universe as\nbeing like a big clock: _Many, many years ago, God the big watchmaker put the\nwhole thing together, wound it up, and walked off. Given full knowledge of the\nclockwork universe at any time, the whole past and future can be\nextrapolated_. This is really a very limiting and lifeless way of thinking of\nthe world. The one thing that may have made the clockwork universe attractive\nto people is that once God finishes putting it together, you don’t have to\nhave Him hanging around anymore, meddling with your affairs.\n\n![img](Images/p179_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 178. The clockwork universe_.\n\nA great weakness with the clockwork universe viewpoint is that the world does\nnot in fact seem to behave very deterministically. That is to say, a given\ncause does not always produce the same effects. Even if you pull the plunger\nback to the exact same point, two different balls are likely to produce\ntotally different scores on a pinball machine. For many years, advocates of\nthe clockwork universe ascribed such variations to invisibly small motions of\natoms. Underlying the world’s seeming disorder was supposed to be a completely\nlawlike mechanism of bouncing atoms. But with the introduction of quantum\nmechanics in the twentieth century, we have come to regard the behavior of\neven the simplest atom as essentially unpredictable.\n\n![img](Images/p180_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 179. Essentially unpredictable_.\n\nCause and effect still tie together many of the events in our world. But it is\nalso true that many events happen for no real reason at all. If there were a\nGod directing the world’s history, then it would not have been enough for him\nto set up the world billions of years ago and then walk off. He would have to\nwork over all of spacetime, weaving the random blips into a pleasing pattern.\n\nI certainly do not want to put myself in the position of arguing for the\nexistence of some giant humanoid God. The point I am really trying to get at\nis that since the process of cause and effect does not in fact account for all\nthe world’s structure, we might well look for other kinds of patterning. I am\nthinking specifically of the acausal connecting principle known as\n_synchronicity_. What is synchronicity?\n\n[PUZZLE 10.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa1)\n\n_If your were to have complete freedom in moving forward and backward in time,\nthen you could duplicate most of the feats of a hyperbeing who can move_ ana\n_and_ kata _at will. How could you use time travel to enter a sealed room? How\ncould you use it to remove someone’s dinner from his stomach without\ndisturbing him_?\n\n![img](Images/p181_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 180. Synchronicity_.\n\nSynchronicity is not a philosophical view but an empirical concept which\npostulates an intellectually necessary principle. This cannot be called either\nmaterialism or metaphysics …\n\nSynchronicity is no more baffling or mysterious than the discontinuities of\nphysics. It is only the ingrained belief in the sovereign power of causality\nthat creates intellectual difficulties and makes it appear unthinkable that\ncauseless events exist or could ever occur. But if they do, then we must\nregard them as _creative acts_ , as the continuous creation of a pattern that\nexists from all eternity, repeats itself sporadically, and is not derivable\nfrom any known antecedents …\n\nMeaningful coincidences are thinkable as pure chance. But the more they\nmultiply and the greater and more exact the correspondence is, the more their\nprobability sinks and their unthinkability increases, until they can no longer\nbe regarded as pure chance but, for a lack of causal explanation have to be\nthought of as meaningful arrangements.\n\nC. G. JUNG,\n\n_Synchronicity_ , 1952\n\nYou learn a new word, and during the next week you see it in three different\nplaces. You’re thinking of an old high school friend you haven’t seen in\nyears, the phone rings, and it’s your old friend on the line. You go to a\nconvention, hoping to have a discussion with a certain Dr. X … and who should\nbe sitting next to you on the bus in from the airport but Dr. X himself.\n\nMeaningful coincidences. Life is full of them. Where do they come from? What\ndo they mean? Can they be controlled?\n\nC. G. Jung, the great Swiss psychologist, began using the term _synchronicity_\nin 1920, to mean “acausal connection” or “meaningful coincidence.” His\nclearest statement of his ideas about synchronicity is to be found in his\nintroduction to the _I Ching_ , an ancient Chinese book of divination. To\nconsult the _I Ching_ , one flips a group of three coins a total of six times\nto generate a “hexagram,” a pattern of solid and broken lines. There are\nsixty-four possible hexagrams, each of which bears a corresponding name and\npage of advice. The really surprising thing about the / _Ching_ is how often\nthe advice it dispenses is precisely and unambiguously relevant to the\nquestioner’s actual situation.\n\n![img](Images/p182_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 181. The hexagram for “Increase.”_\n\nAn example: a young married couple of my acquaintance were expecting an\nunplanned third child. They decided they could not afford it, and scheduled an\nabortion. Doubts over this course of action set in, and they consulted the _I\nChing_. The reading? “Increase. It furthers one to undertake something. It\nfurthers one to cross the great water.” Heeding this advice, they braved the\nwaters of birth once again, and had their third baby. What made this story\ntruly striking to me was that shortly thereafter Alison Lurie’s novel _The War\nBetween the Tates_ appeared … and this novel contains a description of a\ncouple who go through the same sequence of events.\n\nStatistically, of course, one expects a certain number of remarkable\ncoincidences to occur. If you play roulette long enough, there will come an\nevening when your every bet wins. Usually when I think of someone, he does not\nin fact phone me up … So is the one time that the call _does_ come so very\nsurprising?\n\n![img](Images/p182_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 182. Not all premonitions are correct_.\n\nThere is also a certain amount of self-suggestion present in the observation\nof coincidences. If, for instance, my arm is in a cast, I will be very\nconscious of casts … I will see people in casts everywhere I go. Is this\nsynchronicity, or is it just a simple alteration in the way I am seeing the\nworld?\n\n![img](Images/p183_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 183. You notice people who look like you_.\n\nProbably there were always a lot of people in casts around, but I just didn’t\nnotice them.\n\nYet this last example does seem to contain the germ of an explanation of\nsynchronicity. According to quantum mechanics, reality as we know it is the\nproduct of a mutual interaction between the objective world and the subjective\nobservers. Jung views such interactions as fundamental to synchronicity:\n“Synchronicity takes the coincidence of events in space and time as meaning\nsomething more than mere chance, namely, a peculiar interdependence of\nobjective events among themselves as well as with the subjective (psychic)\nstates of the observer or observers.” Does an individual’s frame of mind\ndetermine what happens to him or her?\n\nThere is a very pretty illustration of synchronicity in Steven Spielberg’s\nfamous movie _E.T_. E.T. (for Extra-Terrestrial) is a pleasant, goblinlike\ncreature who is befriended by a ten-year-old boy named Elliot. E.T. seems to\nhave great psychic powers, and his mind becomes in some way linked to\nElliot’s. At one point, E.T. is watching a romantic adventure on television,\nwhile Elliot is at school fighting with a girl whom he admires. Suddenly the\ntwo images — Elliot-and-girl, hero-and-heroine — take on the same Gestalt, and\njust as the hero kisses the heroine on TV, Elliot kisses the girl in his\nclassroom. Is it that E.T.’s perception of the TV show alters Elliot’s\nreality? Or would it be better to say that Elliot and E.T. are part of a\nlinked system that manifests the same experience in different ways?\n\nThe first way of putting it suggests that E.T. has some sort of “mind ray,”\nwhich, by a chain of cause and effect, alters what is happening in Elliot’s\nclassroom. The second way of looking at the coincidence suggests, rather, that\nthere is some sort of noncausal harmony between the actions of Elliot and E.T.\n\nIn the case of this totally fictional movie, it is, of course, the second view\nthat is correct. The child actor portraying Elliot and the roboticized doll\nrepresenting E.T. have the same “experience” because Steven Spielberg, the\nmovie’s creator, intended them to. He _designed_ the movie so as to contain\nthis particular synchronicity.\n\nMovies and novels very commonly include large numbers of significant\ncoincidences. These synchronistic elements provide a sort of “horizontal”\nstructure complementary to the “vertical” development of the plot. By the same\ntoken, one might think of our world’s synchronicities as a sort of\n“horizontal” spacetime structuring, a structuring that is there for reasons\nthat might be thought of as artistic.\n\n![img](Images/p184_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 184. A common cause_.\n\nLet me make this “horizontal versus vertical” distinction a bit clearer by\nmeans of two spacetime diagrams. In figure 184, we have a spacetime diagram\nrepresenting an object _A_ , which yesterday split into two objects _B_ and\n_C_ , which are now drawing apart from each other. We might, for instance,\ntake _A_ to be an amoeba which splits into two identical amoebas _B_ and _C.\nB_ and _C_ are identical, but this is not an example of synchronicity. The\nsimilar features of _B_ and _C_ can be traced back to a common cause, their\nparent _A_.\n\nFigure 185 illustrates what might be a synchronistic event. Here we have the\ntwo distant objects _B_ and _C_ coincidentally splitting up at the exact same\ntime. _B’s_ split is not the cause of _C_ ’s, and _C_ ’s is not the cause of\n_B_ ’s. They just happen to occur at the same time.\n\n![img](Images/p185_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 185. A coincidence_.\n\nThe point is that cause and effect can be regarded as a sort of “vertical”\npatterning of spacetime, while synchronicity is a “horizontal” patterning of\nspacetime. Cause and effect set up certain branching patterns in time;\nsynchronicity arranges these patterns in step with each other. When both\npatternings are at work, one gets the kind of complex pattern of events\ncharacteristic of life as it is lived.\n\n![img](Images/p185_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 186. Cause-effect_ and _synchronicity_.\n\nIt seems evident that a really first-class universe must include a mixture of\nboth sorts of spacetime patterning. What I am suggesting, in short, is that\nour world contains synchronicity because it is a beautiful and interesting\nworld! But who put all that synchronicity there? Who built in all the deep\nmeaning?\n\nMany would answer that God did it. Indeed, one of the three traditional\ntheological proofs of the existence of God is the “argument from design,”\nwhich reasons that the universe, as a supreme work of art, must have been made\nby some great Artist. But this conclusion is not inescapable. According to the\nquantum-mechanical world view, it is we ourselves who create the world, event\nby event, instant by instant. The universe is, in a sense, a book written by\nits characters, a dream dreamed by its own phantoms.\n\nBut why, then, should the universe exhibit such overall coherence, such\nsynchronicity? Curiously enough, quantum mechanics not only allows for\nsynchronistic events … It _requires_ them. This result, established as\nrecently as the 1970s, has its original inspiration in the so-called Einstein-\nPodolsky-Rosen paradox of 1935.\n\nThe EPR paradox goes as follows. Quantum mechanics predicts that once two\nparticles have been near each other, they continue to instantaneously affect\neach other no matter how widely they may be separated. Now we know from\nEinsteinian relativity that no signals can travel faster than light. Returning\nto figure 185, we can see that there is no way a sudden change in _B_ can\n_cause_ a synchronized change in _C_ (or vice versa), since there is no way\nfor a signal to instantaneously zip from the one to the other. In Einstein’s\nview this was a paradox. _B_ and _C_ act in harmony, even though they cannot\nexchange signals fast enough to causally _organize_ their harmony.\n\nEinstein was, in some ways, a very deterministic thinker. He viewed\nsynchronicity as too miraculous a phenomenon to be built into our physics. He\nsought to escape the conclusions of the EPR paradox by postulating the\nexistence of “hidden variables,” tiny internal clocks, as it were, that would\nbe the hidden cause of _B_ and _C_ ’s simultaneous decay.\n\n[PUZZLE 10.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa2)\n\n_Special relativity says that it is impossible to permanently label any given\nspace location. “Right here last week,” in other words, has no absolute\nmeaning. How would the existence of a time machine go against this\nassumption_?\n\nNow, in the case where _A, B_ , and _C_ are _amoebas_ , such a view is\ncorrect. If _A_ has parented _B_ and _C_ , then the fact that _B_ and _C_\nmature simultaneously is not really synchronistic. Two flowers blooming at the\nsame time is not synchronicity; it is evidence, rather, of a common hidden\ncause: the plants’ common ancestor with its built-in biological clock. The\namoebas _B_ and _C_ mature in concert because they have the same DNA. Einstein\nproposed that even if _B_ and _C_ were things as simple as photons or\nelectrons, then there would still be some internal structure, some “hidden\nvariables,” to account for their synchronistic behavior.\n\n![img](Images/p187_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 187. A hidden common cause._\n\nThese hidden variables cannot be directly observed. But in 1964, physicist\nJohn S. Bell devised a type of experiment that could test for these hidden\nvariables in a statistical way. In the 1970s, physicists at Berkeley, Harvard,\nand other universities carried out a series of such experiments verifying what\nthe quantum physicists had said all along: there are no hidden variables, even\nthough it is true that distant particles can behave in a synchronized way.\n\n![img](Images/p187_2.jpg)\n\n_Faster than light, slower than time._\n\n[PUZZLE 10.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa3)\n\n_Here is a picture illustrating how FTL travel can lead to time travel to\none’s own past. The traveler goes from_ A _to_ B _to_ C, B _being an event on\nthe world line of a distant galaxy that is moving away from Earth at half the\nspeed of light. Explain how the paths_ AB _and_ BC _both can be regarded as\npure FTL trips._\n\nThis result rules out the existence of the sorts of hidden causes that\nEinstein desired. An electron is just what it seems: a completely simple\nparticle with no memory, no internal clock, no “hidden variables.” The fact\nthat two widely separated elementary particles _B_ and _C_ can act in concert\n_has no explanation._\n\nThis, finally, is the essence of synchronicity: the world we live in is filled\nwith harmonies and coincidences that have no explanation in terms of cause and\neffect. It is fruitless to seek after hidden forces and occult powers. The\nworld is a given — it is just as it is, full of cause and effect, full of\nsynchronicity.\n\nSome people have taken these new developments to mean that such psychic feats\nas telepathy and psychokinesis are now firmly established scientific\nrealities. This is not correct. To understand this point, we should make clear\nwhat is meant by telepathy and psychokinesis (PK for short).\n\nThe basic supposition behind these ideas is that if I am a psychic, then by\nthinking a certain way I can change the world around me. In the case of\ntelepathy, I am to transmit my thoughts to other people; in the case of PK, I\nam to make objects move.\n\nA very obvious fact — which is somehow overlooked in most discussions of\npsychic phenomena — is that, in a sense, we all have telepathy and PK. I have\nsome thoughts in my head, I go talk to you, and then you have the same\nthoughts! I want certain words to appear on my typing paper, I will my fingers\nto move, and the words appear! I want my body to move into the next room, I\nmove my legs, and my body is in the next room! There is a sense in which these\nare all rather amazing phenomena. Who needs telepathy when we have telephones?\nWhy wish for PK when you have hands? What makes teleportation so much better\nthan airplanes?\n\n[PUZZLE 10.4](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa4)\n\n_Not only does FTL travel lead to time travel; the converse is true as well.\nTime travel leads to FTL travel. Given a rocket and a time machine, how could\nyou send a probe all the way around the galaxy, yet have it get back the same\nday_?\n\nBut of course people would like to have more. A somewhat outdated paradigm for\npsychic phenomena is that our brains can generate some mysterious rays that go\nout and change the world around us. But even if there were such rays, would\nthey be so different from radio waves? Mind rays would, in the last analysis,\nstill be susceptible to classical scientific analysis — and the feeling is\nthat psychic phenomena, if they exist, should somehow lie outside normal\nscience.\n\n![img](Images/p189_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 188. The CIA has funded research for “psychotronic warfare.”_\n\nNo, I think that what people really expect from psychic phenomena is an\nability to instantaneously affect external objects without any kind of cause-\nand-effect mediation at all. The wizard clenches his face, and on the other\nside of the galaxy a star goes supernova. Psychic phenomena are supposed to\nact faster than light, horizontally across spacetime.\n\n[PUZZLE 10.5](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa5)\n\n_If time itself were bent into a vast circle, then one might hope to reach the\npast by traveling “around” time. But thinking about a universe in which time\nis a vast circle leads to some strange problems. Say, for instance, that you\nbuild a very durable radio beacon and set it afloat in space near the Earth.\nIs it possible that this beacon can last all the way around time? If it does,\nthen once you set one afloat, how many more should you be able to detect? What\nif you decide to set your beacon afloat if and only if you detect no beacons\nout there before the launch_?\n\nNow, the new quantum experiments have established that — at least at the level\nof individual particles — there are significant and acausal cross-correlations\nbetween certain sequences of events. A typical experiment of this kind might\nconsist of an energy source and two particle detectors at opposite ends of the\nlaboratory. Each of the detectors prints out a random sequence of “yes or no”\nmeasurements. Although each sequence, taken by itself, seems random and\nmeaningless, the experimenter finds that, taken together, the two sequences\nshow a remarkable degree of similarity.\n\nBut this does not mean that one set of measurements is determining the other\nset. Two disparate regions of the universe may sometimes be in a kind of\nfaster-than-light harmony, but it is meaningless to say that the events in one\nregion are _causing_ the events in the other region.\n\nThe great difference between synchronicity and telepathy is that we do not\nexpect to be able to _control_ synchronicity. The wizard’s face clench and the\nstar’s explosion may happen at the same time — but it is foolish to say the\nstar made the wizard grimace, as it would be to say that the wizard made the\nstar explode. Synchronicity just happens.\n\nLet’s imagine a synchronicity at the human level. Say that Bob and Donna are\nlovers driven apart by the decrees of fate. They think of each other often,\nand still exchange letters for the first month or two. One week Bob happens to\nget out his old copy of Tom Wolfe’s _Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_ While\nreading it, he happens to hear a radio playing “Magic Man,” by Heart. So far,\nso what. Bob is just randomly entertaining himself.\n\nThe next week Bob gets a letter from Donna: “ _By the way, have you ever heard\nof ‘Magic Man’ by Heart? You fit the bill. This week I read a book called\n‘Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.’ Do you know it? There’s a girl in there called\n‘Mountain Girl.’ Sometimes she and Kesey would talk for hours; he understood\nher better than anyone else; when I read that I thought of you & me.”_\n\n[PUZZLE 10.6](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch10pa6)\n\n_We discussed a number of paradoxes that arise from an ability to travel to\nthe past. But just being able to_ communicate _with the past leads to\nparadoxes as well. Suppose, for instance, that I have a magic telephone with\nthe following properties: Whenever I pick up the receiver and dial “1,” the\nmagic telephone rings an hour earlier. 1 am thus able to telephone my past\nself. If I happen to hear the phone ringing, and pick up the receiver, I can\nexpect to hear the voice of my future self. But now, what if at 9:00 I decide\nI will dial “1” at 11:00 unless I have received a call at 10:00_?\n\n![img](Images/p191_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 189. Bob and Donna._\n\nWhat is poor Bob to think? Is Donna reading his mind? Are his actions\ncontrolling Donna’s? No. Each of them is living out the random events of their\nlives. Yet these lives were once so close that there is still a degree of\ncorrelation between them.\n\nThis is a first-class universe we’re in. It’s loaded with symbolic events,\ndeep meanings, and heavy coincidences. There are events that, for want of a\nbetter word, some people call telepathy. But there _is_ a better word: the\nword is _synchronicity._ “Telepathy” suggests the idea of being able to exert\ncontrol over coincidences. But surely the rough and tumble of life has taught\nall of us that any hope of full control is chimerical. Telepathy is a paranoid\nfantasy; synchronicity is a fact of life. As one 1960s slogan put it: “We\ndon’t have to get it together. It _is_ together.”\n\n\n## 11\n\n## What Is Reality?\n\nSTARTING with no preconceptions at all, what is the most reasonable model of\nthe world that we can build up?\n\nOnly two things seem really certain: one exists, and one has perceptions. I\nmay be a meat machine, a soul, an eye of God, a collection of ideas, or who\nknows what — but I am certain that I exist. I am the thing that writes these\nwords. Of course, _you_ may doubt whether I am real — perhaps you are only\ndreaming that you read this book — but you do know for certain that you\nyourself exist.\n\nThe fact that one has experiences is equally certain; to put it more\nneutrally, one cannot doubt that perceptions occur. In classical physics, one\nassumes that the perceptions are caused by objects in three-dimensional space;\nbut, if you think about it, that is really quite an artificial assumption.\n\n![img](Images/p192_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 190. What is reality_?\n\nI do not perceive the world as stable objects, all equally present at all\ntimes. The world of immediate perceptions is all bits and pieces, rags and\ntags. The hiss of the radiator, a bad taste in my mouth, an ache in my hip,\nthe red color of my typewriter, the clack of typing, the sky’s pearl-gray\nglow, my glasses resting on my nose, rain dripping through the ceiling in the\nnext room, birds in the sky, a car’s tires on the street outside, the titles\non my bookcase — this and that, now and again, a stew of perceptions, and\nstable reality is a mere construct! Concentrating now on my line of reasoning,\nI lose all awareness of the sky, rain, and cars; is it not reasonable to say\nthat for this moment they cease to exist? Must an individual be like Atlas,\nwho carries the whole world on his back?\n\n![img](Images/p193_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 191. Immediate perceptions._\n\nThe Irish philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753) advocated an idealistic\nphilosophy called _immaterialism._ No one has written more eloquently on\nBerkeley than Borges does in his essay “A New Refutation of Time.”\n\nBerkeley denied the existence of matter. This does not mean, one should note,\nthat he denied the existence of colors, odors, tastes, sounds and tactile\nsensations; what he denied was that, aside from these perceptions, which make\nup the external world, there was anything invisible, intangible, called\nmatter. He denied that there were pains that no one feels, colors that no one\nsees, forms that no one touches. He reasoned that to add matter to our\nperceptions is to add an inconceivable, superfluous world to the world. He\nbelieved in the world of appearances woven by our senses, but understood that\nthe material world is an illusory duplication.\n\n![img](Images/p193_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 192. \"No elementary phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed\nphenomenon.”_\n\nIt is surprising to learn that such a seemingly perverse world view is\nembraced by modern physicists. In the words of John Wheeler, one of the grand\nold men of physics, “No elementary phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an\nobserved phenomenon.” By this, Wheeler means that the rise of quantum\nmechanics has demolished the view that the universe sits “out there” while we\nsit back and observe it. The kinds of questions one asks — and the order one\nasks them in — has a profound influence on the answers one gets, and on the\nworld view one builds up.\n\nWhat I would like to do now is build up a model of reality based on the notion\nthat all that exists is the perceptions of various observers. The “three space\nplus one time dimension” story is just one particular framework for organizing\nour sensations. We can — and do — equally well order our thoughts and\nimpressions according to many other systems. Thoughts and memories having to\ndo with “food” fall into one area, for instance, and these food thoughts are\nin turn organized according to various kinds of criteria. There are the good-\nfood/bad-food axis, the sweet/salty axis, the raw/cooked, mine/not-mine, home-\nmade/purchased, cold/hot, red/green, and endlessly many other axes.\n\nBut you say, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine trees, for\ninstance, in a park or books existing in a closet, and no body by to perceive\nthem. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: but what is all\nthis, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you\ncall _books_ and _trees_ and at the same time omitting to frame the idea of\nany one that may perceive them? But do you not you yourself perceive or think\nof them all the while? This therefore is nothing to the purpose: it only shows\nyou have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind; but it doth not\nshew that you can conceive it possible, the objects of your thought may exist\nwithout the mind …\n\nGEORGE BERKELEY,\n\n_A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,_ 1710\n\nWhat I am suggesting is that if we take sensations and thoughts as primary,\nthen there is no reason to limit the “dimensions” of the world to the space\nand time dimensions involved in the motions of inanimate objects. Part and\nparcel of every object you see is what the object reminds you of, how you feel\nabout it, what you know about its past, and so on. If we make an honest effort\nto describe the world as we actually live it, then the world grows endlessly\nmore complicated than any simple 3-D picture. There is a feeling that the more\nwe delve into the nature of reality, the more we will find. Far from being\nlimited, the world is inexhaustibly rich.\n\nWe are used to taking left/right, forward/backward, up/down, past/future, and\n— perhaps — _ana/kata_ to be the only possible dimensions. But why shouldn’t\ncold/hot, nice/nasty, pretty/ugly, and all other distinctions have equal claim\nto being dimensions of reality? It is, after all, not enough to just tell a\nperson where and when a given object is. One wants also to know if it is red,\nif it is good to eat, how much it costs, who else sees it, how much it weighs,\nand so on.\n\n![img](Images/p194_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 193. Patterns of atoms._\n\nThe traditional approach of science has been to explain sensory phenomena,\nsuch as color and warmth, in terms of the spacetime patterns of atoms. But who\nhas ever really seen an atom? At best one might see some kind of electron-\nmicroscope photograph of a grainy dot. And one’s _experience_ of seeing such a\nphotograph is in fact a collection of sensory phenomena, involving color,\nbrightness, and so on. Matter may explain our perceptions, but it is our\nperceptions that tell us about matter.\n\nI propose that we stop trying to explain our mental experiences in terms of\ninvisibly tiny objects arranged in patterns in 3-D space. Instead let us take\nour actual thoughts and sensations as the truly fundamental entities. Think of\na “dimension” as being any possible type of variation, category, or\ndistinction. For each question you might ask about an object, there is a range\nof possible answers; we take each of these ranges to be an axis in the _true_\n“space” underlying our perceptions.\n\nWhat shall we call this space? _Fact-space_ sounds good. An entity of any kind\nis a glob in fact-space. To the extent that an entity’s position on some axis\nis precisely given, the corresponding glob will have a narrow cross section in\nthe direction of that axis. If an entity’s properties are vague or\nindeterminate, then its glob will be hazy and spread-out. The world — the\ncollection of all thoughts and objects — is a pattern spread out through fact-\nspace.\n\n![img](Images/p195_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 194. One-dimensional fact-space._\n\nWhat is the pattern like? It will be helpful here to look at a lower-\ndimensional example. Imagine a Lineland inhabited by two Dots. Suppose for now\nthat the Dots are at rest on their line of space, and suppose that they are so\nsimple that all there is to know about any given Dot is its position. If we\nimagine looking at this Lineland from the outside, then it has a fact-space\nthat is simply a line with two Dots on it. If for some reason the exact\npositions of the Dots are uncertain, then the globs representing their\npositions will be smeared out. In thinking of the smeared images, it is\nhelpful to think of spots of light: take the smeared image to be a patch of\nlight that is brighter at the center and shaded off at the edges.\n\nThere are, in practice, no really distinct boundaries between things. In terms\nof our model, this can be represented by supposing that no point between _A_\nand _B_ is _totally_ dark: the whole line is slightly lit, but as it has two\nparticularly bright regions we say there are two distinct Dots.\n\nIf we suppose that the Dots have some properties other than position, then the\nfact-space takes on more dimensions. If we suppose, for instance, that the\nDots can be at different temperatures and in different moods, then we get\nsomething like figure 195. Looking at it, we see that _A_ is to the east of\n_B,_ and that _B,_ though colder than A, is in a better mood. Note also that\nthe uncertainty about the Dots’ exact mood is greater than the uncertainty\nabout their temperature. But hold it; _whose_ uncertainty am I talking about?\n\n![img](Images/p196_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 195. Three-dimensional fact-space._\n\nYou recall how it goes — one of the after-dinner party sent out of the living\nroom, the others agreeing on a word, the one fated to be questioner returning\nand starting his questions. “Is it a living object?” “No.” “Is it here on\nearth?” “Yes.” So the questions go from respondent to respondent around the\nroom until at length the word emerges: victory if in twenty tries or less;\notherwise, defeat.\n\nThen comes the moment when we are fourth to be sent from the room. We are\nlocked out unbelievably long. On finally being readmitted, we find a smile on\neveryone’s face, sign of a joke or a plot. We innocently start our questions.\nAt first the answers come quickly. Then each question begins to take longer in\nthe answering — strange when the answer itself is only a simple “Yes” or “No.”\nAt length, feeling hot on the trail, we ask, “Is the word ‘cloud’?” “Yes,”\ncomes the reply, and everyone bursts out laughing. When we were out of the\nroom, they explain, they had agreed not to agree in advance on any word at\nall. Each one around the circle could respond “yes” or “no” as he pleased to\nwhatever question we put to him. But however he replied he had to have a word\nin mind compatible with his own reply — and with all the replies that went\nbefore …\n\nIn the real world of quantum physics, _no elementary phenomenon is a\nphenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon._ In the surprise version of the\ngame no word is a word until that word is promoted to reality by the choice of\nquestions asked and answers given. “Cloud” sitting there waiting to be found\nas we entered the room? Pure delusion!\n\nJOHN A. WHEELER,\n\n“Frontiers of Time,” 1980\n\nThis is an important point. A fact-space like figure 195 is drawn as if some\nobserver is standing outside the Dots’ universe and measuring the Dots’\nproperties. But this kind of attitude is not going to work if we want to talk\nabout the actual world we live in. _We cannot observe our world from the\noutside._ If we take the “world” to be everything that exists, then there can\nbe no outside observer!\n\nSuppose we drop any notion of observing the Dots from the outside, and assume\nthat the only real facts in Lineland involve _what the Dots know._ Assume\nagain that the only property the Dots have is position. In this case the fact-\nspace will have two axes: one axis for where _A_ thinks the two Dots are, and\none axis for where _B_ thinks the two Dots are. If there were ten Dots, we\nwould need ten axes, one for each Dot’s opinion of the positions.\n\nIn figure 196 I have drawn the fact-space for two Dots, _A_ and _B,_ who\nnotice their mutual positions. The lower patch represents _A,_ and the other\npatch represents _B._ If we drop down vertically from the _A_ -patch we get a\nnarrowly defined location on the position-according-to-A axis. _A_ knows quite\nwell where _A_ is. Notice, however, that _A_ does not have a very good idea\nwhere _B_ is. Studying the diagram further, we can see that _B_ is a less\n“self-centered” Dot than _A_ is. That is to say, if we run across horizontally\nfrom the _A_ -patch and the _B_ -patch, we find that _B_ knows both Dots’\npositions with equal accuracy.\n\n![img](Images/p197_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 196. Self-generated fact-space._\n\nIt is interesting to note that the quality of A’s “self-centeredness” is not\nsomething to be found just by looking at the _A_ -patch. We notice this\nquality only by looking at the whole pattern in fact-space. What, by the way,\nshall we call a pattern in fact-space? Suppose we call it a _world state_ ,\n“state” being used here in the sense of “state of being” or “state of\nconsciousness.” Rephrasing the point just made, we might say that properties\nof an individual are bound up in the overall pattern of the world state.\n\n![img](Images/p197_2.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 197. A has no idea where_ B _is._\n\nThese ambiguities, redundancies, and deficiencies recall those attributed by\nDr. Franz Kuhn to a certain Chinese encyclopedia entitled _Celestial Emporium\nof Benevolent Knowledge._ On those remote pages it is written that animals are\ndivided into (a) those that belong to the emperor, (b) embalmed ones, (c)\nthose that are trained, (d) suckling pigs, (e) mermaids, (f) fabulous ones,\n(g) stray dogs, (h) those that are included in this classification, (i) those\nthat tremble as if they were mad, (j) innumerable ones, (k) those drawn with a\nvery fine camel’s hair brush, (1) others, (m) those that have just broken a\nflower vase, (n) those that resemble flies from a distance.\n\nJORGE LUIS BORGES,\n\n“The Analytical Language of John Wilkins,” 1941\n\nIf Dot _A_ were to focus so entirely on its own location as to lose all sight\nof _B,_ we would get a world state as shown in figure 197. For any individual\nat any given time, most of the world is going to be unknown or indeterminate,\nas _B_ is relative to _A_ here. Note, however, that the indeterminacy of _B_\nrelative to _A_ is still compatible with _B’s_ having a good knowledge of\nwhere _B_ and _A_ are.\n\nIt is worth noting here that this kind of model resolves one of the seeming\nparadoxes of immaterialism. Two people, let us say, are standing in a field. A\nrabbit runs past. One of the people sees the rabbit, the other doesn’t. For\nthe first person the rabbit has definite existence; for the second person the\nrabbit does not exist. How can one and the same rabbit both exist and not\nexist? In our fact-space model there is no problem. The glob representing the\nrabbit is shaped so as to have a sharp projection on one person’s axis, and a\nfuzzed-out projection on the other person’s axis.\n\nReturning to our Lineland fact-space, note that if we were to add the\nproperties of “temperature” and “mood” as before, then we would need a total\nof six axes: three axes for _A_ ’s ideas about position, temperature, and\nmood; and three axes for _B_ ’s opinions. In general, a world with _P_\ndistinct properties and _I_ distinct individuals will have _P_ -times-_I_ axes\nin its full fact-space. The state of the world can be thought of as a pattern\nof more or less distinct globs in a fact-space of very many dimensions.\n\n![img](Images/p198_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 198. A great number of individuals._\n\nAs the various individuals interact with each other, their knowledge about\neach other changes. The globs of light shift and merge, thicken and attenuate.\nWe can think of the pattern as changing with the passage of time —\nalternatively, we can take each individual’s time peception as an axis and\nhave time change frozen right into the world state.\n\nSo far I have not discussed the issue of what kinds of things in our world are\ngoing to count as individuals. Just people? People and animals? People,\nanimals, and plants? People, animals, plants, and robots? Should we include\ngalaxies and rocks? Since we’re going to get an unmanageably large collection\nanyway, my inclination is to be generous about this. I’m prepared to go ahead\nand let anything you like be an individual capable of certain kinds of\n“knowledge.” A rock in a field doesn’t know much, but it does know that\nthere’s something massive (the Earth) right under it. We can tell that it\n“knows” since if you lift it and let go, it falls right back down! Putting it\na little more seriously, any given object, animate or not, “knows” or embodies\ninformation about a number of other objects.\n\n[PUZZLE 11.1](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch11pa1)\n\n_Suppose that space and time are really just mental constructs. In general the\nonly reason we have for saying that one state of mind_ B _comes after another\nstate of mind_ A _is that_ B _includes a memory of state_ A, _but_ A _does not\ninclude a memory of state_ B. _Under this definition of “before and after,”\nwould a person’s perceptions necessarily fit into a linear time sequence_?\n\nThis viewpoint — that everything is in some sense alive or conscious — has\nhistorically been known as hylozoism, or panpsychism. It is, of course, a\nviewpoint that is easy to ridicule. Can a garbage can feel love? Does a shoe\nthink about mathematics? But the point is not that we are to think of objects\nas being “like people.” The point is only that we might perhaps think of\nobjects as integrative centers in fact-space, existing entities in the same\nsense that we are existing patterns ourselves.\n\nSo there are to be a great number of individuals in fact-space. And how many\npossible properties might there be? There really seems to be no end to the\nnumber of properties individuals might be sensitive to. If you start asking\nquestions about some individual object, it seems as though you might really\nkeep on asking questions forever. So if fact-space is to have as many\ndimensions as the number of individuals _times_ the number of properties, I\nthink we may as well go ahead and say that fact-space is probably infinite-\ndimensional. Our world is a pattern in an infinite-dimensional, or “∞-D,”\nspace.\n\n![img](Images/p199_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 199. The world is like a game of “Infinity Questions” — there’s no end\nto the number of questions you can ask._\n\nWe are equal beings and the universe is our relations with each other. The\nuniverse is made of one kind of entity: each one is alive, each determines the\ncourse of his own existence.\n\nThe universe is made of one kind of whatever-it-is, which cannot be defined.\nFor our purpose, it isn’t necessary to try to define it. All we need to do is\nassume that there is only _one kind_ of whatever-it-is, and see if it leads to\na reasonable explanation for the world as we know it.\n\nThe basic function of each being is expanding and contracting. Expanded beings\nare permeative; contracted beings are dense and impermeative. Therefore each\nof us, alone or in combination, may appear as space, energy, or mass,\ndepending on the ratio of expansion to contraction chosen, and what kind of\nvibrations each of us expresses by alternating expansion and contraction. Each\nbeing controls his own vibrations.\n\nA completely expanded being is space … When a being is totally contracted, he\nis a mass particle, completely imploded … When a being is alternating\nexpansion and contraction, he is energy … The universe is an infinite harmony\nof vibrating beings in an elaborate range of expansion-contraction ratios,\nfrequency modulations, and so forth.\n\nWhat we need to remember is that there is nobody here but us chickens. The\nentire universe is made up of beings just like ourselves.\n\nTHADDEUS GOLAS,\n\n_The Lazy Man’s Guide to Enlightenment,_ 1972\n\n![img](Images/p200_1.jpg)\n\n_Fig. 200. Turtles all the way down._\n\nThe notion of ∞-D space is not something I just made up. The hyperspace\nphilosophers of the late nineteenth century were well aware that the notion of\nhigher dimensions leads to an infinite regress: Earth’s 2-D surface is part of\nour 3-D universe. Our 3-D universe may well be the hypersurface of a 4-D\nhypersphere. Our 4-D hypersphere is a cross section of a 5-D curved spacetime\npattern. Our 5-D curved spacetime is perhaps only a layer in a 6-D stack of\nalternate space-times. The 6-D stack may itself be warped and twisted in 7-D\nspace; various versions of the stack may nestle together in 8-D space. Perhaps\nthe whole 8-D space can be thought of as evolving along a nine-dimensional\naxis of supertime. And so on. Where can it stop? Only at infinity.\n\nHinton compared this to the kind of regress that arises if someone says the\nworld rests on the back of a tortoise. What does the tortoise stand on?\nAnother tortoise, which stands on another, which stands on another, ad\ninfinitum. The theologian Arthur Willink found such an infinite regress of\nspaces exhilarating, and in his 1893 work _The World of the Unseen,_ he argues\nthat God lives in the ultimate ∞-D space:\n\nIt is necessary to go farther, and to recognize a very wide extension of the\nidea of Higher Space, which is by no means exhausted when we have reached the\nconception of Space of Four Dimensions … When we have recognized the existence\nof Space of Four Dimensions there is no greater strain called for in the\nrecognition of the existence of Space of Five Dimensions, and so on up to\nSpace of an infinite number of Dimensions.\n\n[PUZZLE 11.2](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch11pa2)\n\n_The British writer J. W. Dunne felt that our dreams are made up of\nimpressions taken equally from past and future. He claims in his 1927_ An\nExperiment with Time _that the dreaming mind is able to rise up out of\nspacetime and see what lies ahead. This seems to lead to a sort of paradox:\nSuppose that I am to catch a plane Tuesday, and that, unknown to me, the plane\nis going to crash. Monday night, my dreaming mind sees into the future, and I\nhave a horribly vivid dream of dying in a plane crash. Tuesday morning I am so\nbadly shaken that I decide to postpone the trip. Tuesday evening, I watch the\nnews and see that my intended plane did indeed crash, killing all aboard. The\nparadox is this: Since I did not in fact experience the plane crash, how could\nI have seen it as part of my future? Dunne’s way out of this hinges on his\nclaim that there is a_ second dimension of time. _Can you fill in the details\nof his argument_?\n\n… And though it is impossible even to begin to imagine what the appearance of\na material object in our Space may be to an observer in a much Higher Space,\nstill it is evident that to him is presented a still more infinitely perfect\nview of its constituents than to an observer in any Lower region of Space.\nWhile to an eye in the Highest Space of all, an infinitely perfect revealing\nof the most hidden and secret things is of necessity presented.\n\nThis emphasizes very strongly what has been said about the Omniscience of God.\nFor he, dwelling in the Highest Space of all, not only has this perfect view\nof all the constituents of our being, but also is most infinitely near to\nevery point and particle of our whole constitution. So that in the most\nstrictly physical sense it is true that in Him we live and move and have our\nbeing.\n\nThis is a very interesting passage, certainly one of the first philosophical\nuses of ∞-D space. A somewhat similar passage can be found in an 1886 essay,\n“On the Various Standpoints with Respect to Actual Infinity,” by the German\nmathematician Georg Cantor:\n\nThe fear of infinity is a form of myopia that destroys the possibility of\nseeing the actual infinite, even though it in its highest form has created and\nsustains us, and in its secondary transfinite forms occurs all around us and\neven inhabits our minds.\n\nIt was Georg Cantor who first developed a mathematically rigorous treatment of\ninfinity. Before Cantor, many mathematicians and philosophers had feared that\ninfinity is basically a contradictory notion — but after Cantor, scientists\nwere able to begin using infinities quite casually.\n\nEarly in the 1900s, mathematician David Hilbert drew on Cantor’s work to\ndevelop a theory of infinite-dimensional spaces — spaces like the fact-space\nwe have been talking about. Just as a point in a 3-D space can be\nmathematically represented by an ordered sequence of _three_ coordinate\nnumbers, a point in an ∞-D space is represented as an _infinite_ sequence of\nnumbers. There are various ways of going on to define things like angles and\ndistances in these ∞-D spaces; the most commonly used type of mathematical ∞-D\nspace is known as Hilbert space.\n\n[PUZZLE 11.3](22_PuzzleAnswers.html#ch11pa3)\n\n_According to quantum mechanics, if you don’t keep an eye on a person, he or\nshe soon becomes indeterminate for you: you no longer know what the other\nperson is like. Yet if you ask the person questions, you will find him or her\nto have definite characteristics. Is there a contradiction here_?\n\nHow can I express the final Teachings to which A Sphere led me? In my\nanguished fear of Death I begged him for some lasting Vision, some higher\nTruth to help me through the End.\n\nSPHERE: It is difficult, oh Square. Before the Absolute we are both as\nShadows.

The Sphere’s voice faded away,\nand all was confusion. I felt myself as but a Thought, a baseless fragment of\nsome recurrent Dream. All around me I sensed my Dreamer’s mind. Mustering my\ncourage I cried out my plaint.\n\nI: Can you hear me, my Lord?\n\nDREAMER: And how! What time is it?\n\nI: There is no Time — so says the Sphere.\n\nDREAMER: Well, yeah. Not for you, anyway.\n\nI: Return me to my fellows, oh my Author. Grant that the Hexagon forgives me.\n\nDREAMER: I can do that. And thanks, I’ve enjoyed being with you. I hate to say\ngood-bye.\n\nI: But surely you will always be with me? Is not my World a fragment of your\nMind?\n\nDREAMER: It’s not _my_ mind, really. I’m just filling in. Who knows who’ll\ndream you next. You’re the real immortal, Square, not me. You’re an eternal\nForm.\n\nFor an instant I could see it All: the boundless Truth, the many Dreamers, and\nmy own life’s passionate play. And then I woke.\n\nMy father and A Hexagon were there with a policeman. The situation was\ndangerous, but so filled was I with Truth and Love that all was soon resolved.\nThe four of us are fast friends to this day.\n\nA SQUARE,\n\n_The Further Adventures of A Square,_ 1984\n\nFor a decade or so, the work on Hilbert spaces seemed to be simply another\nexample of mathematicians pursuing abstraction for abstraction’s sake. But in\nthe 1920s, physicists Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger discovered that\nthe best way of interpreting quantum mechanics is to say that _particles are\npatterns in_ ∞ _-D Hilbert space._\n\nSince that time, mathematicians and physicists have developed an elaborate\nquantum-mechanical theory of the world as a pattern in an ∞-D Hilbert space.\nOne of the great problems with this theory has been to find some actual\nsignificance for the ∞-D space involved. When classical physics presents us\nwith equations involving four variables, we are able to understand these\nequations as being about the three space dimensions plus the one time\ndimension. But the mathematics of quantum mechanics seems somehow to have\ndeveloped in the absence of any good underlying picture. There is no doubt\nthat the quantum theory as it stands makes correct predictions about definite\nexperiments. But no one seems to have a good feeling for what Hilbert space\nreally means.\n\nIn describing our world of perceptions as a pattern in ∞-D fact-space, I have\nbeen trying to give the notion of ∞-D space some real content. The notion of\nfact-space is, in many ways, modeled on the quantum-mechanical Hilbert space.\nGiven the protean nature of infinity, I would not be surprised to learn that\nthe two spaces are really the same. It is important here to realize that the\nparticular axes one lays down in a given space are quite arbitrary. Although a\nCalifornian and a New Yorker live in the same space, the directions they call\n“up” are slightly different. Space is given in itself, and without axes. Once\nwe build up the world as a pattern in ∞-D fact-space, it could be that a\nsimple redrawing of the axes would lead to the Hilbert space model. The\nimportant thing to remember is that the axes have no objective existence at\nall.\n\nWhat is reality?\n\nTake all your perceptions and all of mine, take everyone’s thoughts and all\nthe visions. In an infinite-dimensional space there is room to fit them all\ntogether; each is a piece of the infinite-dimensional One, and this One is\nreality.\n\nReality is indescribably rich and complex. Sometimes I forget this, and life\ngoes gray. But the world is alive, and we are living parts of it. Thoughts are\nas real and important as objects. Every object is an endless source of wonder.\n\nWe don’t know why we’re here — we don’t even know what we _are._ But we exist,\nand the world is going on. Our ordinary notions of space and time are just a\nconvenient fiction. Higher dimensions are everywhere. There’s no need to work\nfor enlightenment; enlightenment is here and now, as close as the fourth\ndimension.\n\n\n## Puzzle Answers\n\n[ANSWER 1.1](09_Chapter1.html#ch_1pa_1)\n\nIf the two car shapes are of different _size,_ then they can move past each\nother.

Food is passed down along the\ngut in the fashion of a barge moving through locks in a canal, with one after\nanother of the barriers momentarily opening.\n\n[ANSWER 2.2](10_Chapter2.html#ch_2pa_2)\n\nWe would, in strict analogy to our world, expect two-dimensional creatures to\ncrawl around on the rim of a disk: their planet.\n\n[ANSWER 3.1](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_1)\n\nIf there were a 3-D space intersecting ours only in a plane, then we would see\nperhaps something like this: a plane of light slanting up from the ground into\nthe sky, with odd-shaped globs drifting around in the plane, sliding up and\ndown like holy Frisbees. The globs would be very thin and would feel solid to\nthe touch.\n\n[ANSWER 3.2](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_2)\n\n![img](Images/p205_1.jpg)\n\n_A Square scanning Flatland._\n\nA Square’s retina is a line segment designed to take in light from the plane\nof A Square’s body. Now it seems that, looking down at Flatland from the third\ndimension, A Square would really see just those objects of Flatland that\nintersect the plane of his vision. The situation would be exactly like that of\na Flatlander in a perpendicular world, as described in puzzle 3.1.\n\nNow if A Square rocks back and forth, he can scan the various cross sections\nof Flatland and then mentally combine these sections to get a full 2-D image.\nBy the same token, if you were in 4-D space looking at our world, you would\nsee various planar cross sections of our world. With some effort, you would be\nable to combine these sections into a full 3-D image of everything, inside and\nout.\n\n[ANSWER 3.3](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_3)\n\n![img](Images/p205_2.jpg)\n\nIt is pretty easy to see that the number of corners will double each time we\ngo up a dimension. But what about the other entries? How, without actually\ncounting the lines in figure 34, do we know that the hypercube has 32 edges?\nThe idea is that a hypercube is gotten by starting with a cube in initial\nposition, moving the cube one unit _ana,_ and then having the cube in final\nposition. The initial and final cube each contribute 12 edges, and the cube’s\neight corners each trace out an edge during the _ana_ motion. 12 + 8 + 12 =\n32. Similar reasoning will justify the remaining entries.\n\n[ANSWER 3.4](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_4)\n\nThe very bottom face must join up with the very top face, and the side faces\non the bottom cube connect to the four open faces of the main part. This is\neasy to see if we consider the analogous process of folding a crucifix up into\na cube.\n\n![img](Images/p206_1.jpg)\n\n_Crucifix into cube. (Answer 3.4)_\n\n[ANSWER 3.5](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_5)\n\nThe formula is S4, and the specific hypercube mentioned would have a\nhypervolume of 16 hypercubic feet.\n\nThe Greeks thought of numbers as specific geometrical magnitudes. For a given\nlength _S, S_ 2 stood for a certain square’s area, and _S_ 3 stood for the\nvolume of a certain cube. Since they had no notion of a fourth dimension, they\ndid almost no work with formulas or equations involving powers higher than 3.\nOnly after the Renaissance did mathematicians feel confident enough of their\nalgebra to work with higher-degree equations in a formal way.\n\n![img](Images/p206_2.jpg)\n\n_The pentahedroid. (From D. Hilbert and S. Cohn-Vossen,_ Geometry and the\nImagination.)\n\n[ANSWER 3.6](11_Chapter3.html#ch_3pa_6)\n\nIf we go into 4-D space, then it is possible to find a fifth point (by moving\n_an a_ from the tetrahedron’s center), so that now all five points are the\nsame distance from each other. These five points are the corners of a so-\ncalled pentahedroid.\n\nIn looking at this picture, we are to imagine that the central point is\nactually a bit further away in the fourth dimension, so that all the edges are\nreally of equal length.\n\nJust as a triangle is made up of three segments, and the tetrahedron is made\nof four triangles, the pentahedroid is made of five tetrahedra. Can you see\nall five?\n\n[ANSWER 4.1](12_Chapter4.html#ch_4pa_1)\n\nIn cross section, a cube can appear to be a square, a triangle, a rectangle,\nor a hexagon.

(From Claude Bragdon,_ A Primer of Higher Space.)\n\n[ANSWER 4.2](12_Chapter4.html#ch_4pa_2)\n\nThis illusion was sent to me by Orville L. Parrinello of Brazoria, Texas. At\nfirst it is a little hard to get, but the idea is that if you let the folded\n“staircase” reverse back and forth, the bug will alternate between being\nvisible on the floor in front of Kilroy, or being hidden on the ceiling of the\nspace behind Kilroy. The illusion is particularly interesting as it raises the\nidea that Kilroy’s objective reality is not fixed at all. What if seemingly\nconcrete facts about your life depended totally on how you look at things?\n\n[ANSWER 4.3](12_Chapter4.html#ch_4pa_3)\n\nIf A Square were transparent, then he could seem to reverse when seen edge-on,\njust as the transparent A Cube reverses in figure 51. The reversal would seem\nsort of as if the Square were “pulled through himself,” just as a left glove\ncan be turned into a right glove by turning it inside out.\n\n![img](Images/p207_1.jpg)\n\n_Is this A Square or_ ![img](Images/p207_3.jpg) (_Answer 4.3_)\n\n[ANSWER 5.1](13_Chapter5.html#ch_5pa_1)\n\n![img](Images/p207_2.jpg)\n\n_Trail of a line._\n\nA line can’t be knotted in 2-D space, because there’s no way to have a line in\nFlatland cross above itself. And a line won’t stay knotted in 4-D space\nbecause, as is discussed in [chapter 5](13_Chapter5.html), the extra degree of\nfreedom will cause any knot to slip through itself. Moving everything up a\ndimension, we expect that a plane can be knotted in 4-D space, but not in 3-D\nor in 5-D. How do you get a knotted plane? The idea is to start with a knotted\nline, and then imagine moving the knotted line _ana_ out of space. The trail\nthe line traces out will be a knotted plane. The plane, it is important to\nrealize, is knotted, _but does not intersect itself._ Of course, if we move\nthe knot in 3-D space, the trail does intersect itself, but since _ana_ is\nperpendicular to every space direction, the 4-D trail will not come back on\nitself anywhere.\n\n[ANSWER 6.1](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_1)\n\nThe turned-over Astrian would have his or her vibrator uselessly sticking up\naway from space. Such a person might seem to be without atmosphere or\nsensitivity, a zombie, a man without qualities, a burnt-out case. Is it\ninteresting here to recall that some early thinkers, including Rene Descartes,\nthought that the pineal gland, located in the brain’s center, might serve as a\nsort of third eye that perceives other people’s auras or astral vibrations.\n\n[ANSWER 6.2](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_2)\n\nIf an Astrian could dig his little 3-D thorn into underlying space hard\nenough, then he could oppose a force of gravity pulling him across space. In\nCharles H. Hinton’s 1907 novel, _An Episode of Flatland,_ this is exactly what\nthe Astrians do:\n\nJust as the captain of a ship has an activity independent of the ship, so our\nsouls have an activity independent of the body. Our souls can act on the\nalongside being [the aether] …\n\nIf, filling my mind with devotion, I think of myself as soaring, as rising\nlike an angel through the air, my soul does that which would make me rise,\naltering my direction by acting on the alongside being.\n\nIf all men were to have the same thoughts, then all of them would tend to\nrise, and the united force would be very great, enough to influence the course\nof the earth in its orbit.\n\n[ANSWER 6.3](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_3)\n\n![img](Images/p208_1.jpg)\n\n_A Square executes a dangerous maneuver._\n\nCube snipped the piece of space containing A Square and turned the piece over.\nNow you might worry about the space of Flatland “popping” from having a hole\nin it. Well, perhaps A Cube took care of that by using something like\nembroidery rings to clamp down around the edges of the hole and of the cut-out\npiece. Or maybe there just was a hole in space for a while. What would it be\nlike to have a hole in space? We’ll get back to the question in [chapter\n7](16_Chapter7.html).\n\n[ANSWER 6.4](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_4)\n\nNo, for we cannot tell whether the hole is moving through space. This is\nanalogous to the fact that a particular matter bump does not serve to mark out\nsome particular region of the fabric of space: as a wave moves across the\nwater, its component water bits are constantly changing. We might compare a\nmoving space hole to a bubble floating up through a liquid. Although the\nbubble’s shape and size stay the same, the bits of liquid that lie at the\nbubble’s boundary are changing as the bubble moves. An offbeat idea suggested\nby these considerations is that perhaps the smallest components of matter are\nnot vortices or space bumps but actual _holes in space._\n\n[ANSWER 6.5](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_5)\n\nThe idea is that the galaxy’s bump is on a line directly between us and the\nquasar. Light from the quasar to us can travel along two alternative shortest\npaths: one around either side of the galaxy’s big space bump. This splitting\nof a quasar’s image was definitely ob-served in 1979. (See Frederic Chaffee,\n“The Discovery of a Gravitational Lens,” _Scientific American,_ November\n1980.) The phrase “gravitational lens” is an exciting way of expressing the\nfact that space curvature can bend light. It is amusing to think of a vast\nsupertelescope based on gravitational lenses millions of miles across.\n\n![img](Images/p209_1.jpg)\n\n_Three bumps in a row, and two shortest paths._\n\n![img](Images/p209_2.jpg)\n\n_Top view of the two paths._\n\n![img](Images/p210_1.jpg)\n\n_Two kinds of singularity._\n\n[ANSWER 6.6](15_Chapter6.html#ch_6pa_6)\n\nA point-sized mass can be most simply represented as a sharp cusp in space.\nAlternatively, one might imagine this cusp to be pulled all the way out to\ninfinity.\n\n[ANSWER 7.1](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_1)\n\nA geodesic on a sphere is a so-called great circle, that is, a circle, such as\nthe equator, which is as big as possible. Relative to the sphere’s surface,\nthe equator is “straight” because it bends neither north nor south. A smaller\ncircle, such as the Arctic Circle, can be seen to bend on the surface of the\nsphere and is not regarded as a geodesic.\n\n[ANSWER 7.2](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_2)\n\n![img](Images/p210_2.jpg)\n\n_Virtual image of an antipodal star._\n\nOne natural explanation of a massless star would be to say that space is\nhyperspherical, and that the massless star is the virtual image of a real star\nat the opposite end of the universe. Unfortunately, even if space really is a\nhypersphere, we are not likely to actually observe any such “fake stars.” The\nproblem is that space is marred by medium-scale irregularities that will\nprevent the perfect focusing of the star’s light rays at the point furthest\naway from the star. Another difficulty is that space contains clouds of dust\nhere and there, dust which will absorb most of a star’s light long before the\nlight makes it halfway round the universe. Were it not for these two problems,\nwe would in general expect to find a virtual image of any observed star at a\ndiametrically opposite spot in the sky — provided, of course, that space\nreally is hyperspherical.\n\n[ANSWER 7.3](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_3)\n\n![img](Images/p211_1.jpg)\n\n_Finite universe with “central” mass._\n\nIt would look like a light bulb, or an ice cream cone: a ball with a big bulge\non it. It is conceivable that our space actually has such a lopsided\nstructure. If we were just about on the opposite side from the superstar that\nmakes the bulge, then we wouldn’t necessarily have to be able to see it\ndirectly. Space dust and intermediate space bumps could dissipate the\nmonster’s image. Such a model for our space is discussed in Paul Davies, _The\nEdge of Infinity,_ 1983.\n\n[ANSWER 7.4](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_4)\n\n![img](Images/p211_2.jpg)\n\n_A curved space with natural distances._\n\nWe would get something like this: a square surface with a peak in the middle.\nThe first and second pictures are two different ways of representing the same\nfact: there is more space toward the middle of this surface than one would\nordinarily expect to find.\n\n[ANSWER 7.5](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_5)\n\n![img](Images/p212_1.jpg)\n\n_Square goes around the Möbius strip_.\n\nHe turns into his own mirror image!\n\n[ANSWER 7.6](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_6)\n\n![img](Images/p212_2.jpg)\n\n_An infinitely distant hole in space._\n\nThe space near the hole is stretched up into an endless “chimney.” No\nFlatlander ever gets to the end of the chimney; no Flatlander ever slides into\nthe hole.\n\n[ANSWER 7.7](16_Chapter7.html#ch_7pa_7)\n\n![img](Images/p212_3.jpg)\n\n_A finite area with infinite length._\n\nThe idea is to use an endless halving procedure to cut the square into\ninfinitely many pieces: a piece of height 1/2, one of height 1/4, 1/8, 1/16,\nand so on. Zeno strikes again! If we line up the regions obtained, we get\nsomething that is infinitely long, but of unit area.\n\n[ANSWER 8.1](17_Chapter8.html#ch_8pa_1)\n\nThe two sheets of space might well snap apart. If the snap were too abrupt, it\nmight do some damage to the Globber in question.\n\n[ANSWER 8.2](17_Chapter8.html#ch_8pa_2)\n\nThis is the type of connection represented in figure 112, although the holes\nin the spaces could be eliminated. The image is of a strip of space joining\ntwo distinct spaces together. The strip could, of course, be made very short\nby bulging the spaces down to meet each other at the surface of the mirror.\n(Keep in mind here that just as a mirror in our space is a piece of a plane, a\nmirror in Flatland is a piece of a line.) This kind of link between spaces is\nexactly what Lewis Carroll deals with in _Through the Looking-Glass._ Marcel\nDuchamp was also obsessed with the notion of mirrors as doors to alternative\nuniverses. He was struck by the fact that a point approaching a mirror has the\nchoice, in principle, of either breaking through the mirror and continuing in\nnormal space, or of moving out of our space and into the alternate space we\nsee inside the mirror. Thus, for Duchamp, a mirror represented a sort of\nrailroad switch where one chooses between two spaces: real space and mirror\nspace. See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, _The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean\nGeometry in Modern Art,_ 1983.\n\n![img](Images/p213_1.jpg)\n\n_A link between two worlds._\n\nA very vivid way to enhance the illusion that a mirror is a door into another\nworld is to get a flashlight and go up to a mirror in a dark room. The laws of\noptics are such that if you shine the flashlight into the mirror, the image\nlooks exactly as if the flashlight beam goes through the mirror and into a\ndark room on the other side of the mirror.\n\n[ANSWER 8.3](17_Chapter8.html#ch_8pa_3)\n\nInstall an Einstein-Rosen bridge in the basement, and have this hyperspace\ntunnel lead to an infinite space empty except for the endless plane of\nFlatland.\n\n[ANSWER 9.1](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_1)\n\nTake a small spherical balloon. Blow it up and then let the air out. The\nentire spacetime trail of the balloon’s surface and inside is a solid\nhypersphere. The trail of the surface alone is the hypersurface of the\nhypersphere.\n\nThe speed with which the balloon should be inflated and deflated depends on\nwhat kind of conversion factor between space and time is adopted. In\nrelativity theory the speed of light is used as a conversion factor; that is,\na “meter of time” is taken to be the time it takes a light ray to travel one\nmeter — about three ten-millionths of a second.\n\nConstructing a hypercube in 4-D spacetime is even simpler. As Professor Tom\nBanchoff of Brown University puts it, “A hypercube in spacetime is just a\n_cube … for a while._ ”\n\n[ANSWER 9.2](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_2)\n\nThe “melting future” world view corresponds to the notion that future events\nexist, stored up and waiting for us. A uniform “now” moves forward with the\npassage of time, and instant after instant is permanently used up. In this\nviewpoint, past events are totally nonexistent. It is not uncommon for people\nto feel this way about their lives. Life here becomes a scarce resource that\nis consumed, and once something is over it doesn’t matter at all. This is\nprobably the least rewarding way possible to think about spacetime, as can be\nseen by thinking about the kind of personal philosophies inherent in the other\nthree world views shown in figure 146. Whenever you cut yourself off from your\npast, you’re in an extremely rootless and vulnerable position. But if you do\nthrow out the past, you might as well throw out the future, too, and get\ntotally into the “now.”\n\n[ANSWER 9.3](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_3)\n\nMr. Lee will put _X_ halfway between _A_ and C. The reason is that Lee will\nassume that it takes the light just as long to travel back from the other end\nof the platform as it took it to get there from his end. It is natural for him\nto think this, in view of the assumptions (1) and (2) mentioned in the puzzle.\nWe, of course, feel that it really takes the light longer to get from _A_ to\n_B_ than it takes it to get from _B_ to C … But Mr. Lee will say we just think\nthat because we’re racing past him at half the speed of light!\n\n![img](Images/p214_1.jpg)\n\n_A slanted time line causes a slanted space line._\n\nIf we draw a dotted line connecting _B_ with the event _X_ (which Mr. Lee says\nis simultaneous with _B_), then we get one of Lee’s _lines of simultaneity._\nThis line corresponds to the space axis in a Minkowski diagram that Lee might\ndraw; another way of putting it is that at the event _X,_ this line will\nrepresent Lee’s conception of “now” — just as his world line represents his\nconcept of “here.” It is possible to prove that in such a diagram, the\nobserver’s line of simultaneity will always tilt up by the same angle at which\nhis world line tilts over.\n\n[ANSWER 9.4](19_Chapter9.html#ch_9pa_4)\n\n![img](Images/p215_1.jpg)\n\n_An expanding finite space._\n\nThe picture would be a sort of “conical” spacetime, as drawn here. The\nstarting point is known as “the initial singularity,” or as the Big Bang.\nWhether or not our space will eventually contract back to a point is unknown\nat present. Apparently it depends on how much mass is actually in our\nuniverse: if there is enough mass, then the gravitational forces will pull\nthings back together.\n\n[ANSWER 10.1](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_1)\n\nTo get into the sealed room, travel far, far into the future until you reach a\ntime where the room’s walls have crumbled. Step into the room’s space and then\ntravel back in time. Note that this is exactly analogous to moving _ana,_ then\nmoving across the location where the wall would be, and then coming back\n_kata_ into the room’s space.\n\nGetting the food out of someone’s stomach is a little trickier, since you\nyourself won’t fit in the stomach. Let us imagine that the stomach in question\nbelongs to your uncle Embry, snoozing off his Christmas banquet on his bed\nupstairs. The thing to do is to go forward in time to later that afternoon\nwhen he’s back out of bed. Take a little scoop and set it right on the bed\nwhere his stomach was. Now send the scoop back a few hours, to when he was\nthere, and then bring it back to the empty bed. Do this a few times, and you\ncan get all the chewed food out of Uncle’s stomach. Hide it under his pillow\nso he has a nice surprise that night!\n\n[ANSWER 10.2](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_2)\n\nIf we assume that the time machine goes straight backward in time, then “right\nhere one week ago” is wherever the time machine appears when I send it one\nweek back. One would not expect the Earth to still be “right here” a week ago,\nso traveling backward in time might well land one in empty space. Science\nfiction writers usually deal with this problem by somehow setting their time\nmachine to track along the Earth’s spacetime path.\n\nIt is interesting to realize that even without the paradoxes, time machines\nare already ruled out by relativity’s basic assumption that there is no such\nthing as absolute rest or motion in space. Of course, if people somehow\n_could_ build time machines, then we would probably just add some “except by\nusing time machines” clause to the relativity principle. Or it might be that\none would have to “aim” the time machine at some definite past object.\n\nNote that just as a time machine can be used to define “right here,” a machine\nthat transmitted objects instantaneously could be used to define “right now.”\nOne could, for instance, spew out a whole lot of synchronized clocks all over\nspace at the same instant. This also, of course, would violate relativity.\n\n[ANSWER 10.3](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_3)\n\nThe point is that “instantaneous” is a relative concept. Relative to Earth,\n_B_ happens at the same time as _A,_ so one can travel instantaneously from\n_A_ to _B._ Relative to the distant galaxy that moves away from us, C is\nsimultaneous with _B,_ so one can travel instantaneously from _B_ to C.\nCombining the two trips takes one from _A_ to _C,_ and thus into one’s own\npast.\n\n[ANSWER 10.4](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_4)\n\nEquip the rocket with a good robot brain so that after its hundreds-of-\nthousands-of-years-long journey, it can use the time machine to jump hundreds\nof thousands of years back in time and find the Earth. Once it finds the Earth\nagain, it makes a small time jump to the right day (the day of launch) and\nlands.\n\n[ANSWER 10.5](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_5)\n\nThe idea of a beacon that lasts all the way around time would lead to\ndifficulties. If it drifted away from Earth never to return, then there would\nbe, it seems, endlessly many of them out there, as a consequence of the one\nlaunch! This seems nonsensical. The situation is particularly vicious if we\nsuppose that _B_ 1 sends out a signal that can inhibit the launch of _B_ 0. A\nyes-and-no paradox!\n\n![img](Images/p217_1.jpg)\n\nOne _becomes_ infinite?\n\nMore thought is required. Let us look at the individual particles that make up\nthe beacon. If the universe really repeats itself, then it must be that each\nparticle returns — at the end of each cycle — to its starting position. The\nworld lines of particles are thus like rubber bands looped around the\nspacetime cylinder.\n\nNow say that we are in such a circular-time universe, and say that we have\nbuilt a durable radio beacon. The beacon has the form of a thick tangle of\n“bands” reaching around spacetime. Now, since we assembled the beacon — as\nopposed to just _finding_ it — it must be that all of the beacon’s component\nparticles are going to end up back on Earth: as ore, as glass fragments, and\nso on. Therefore, we can logically conclude that in a circular-time universe,\nany ship we build and launch into space must eventually crash back onto Earth\n… so that its particles can be assembled back into the ship to be launched! It\nis, in other words, _impossible to build a truly indestructible object if time\nis circular!_ For anything you build must in time disintegrate into pieces so\nthat you can “again” build it.\n\n[ANSWER 10.6](20_Chapter10.html#ch_10pa_6)\n\nWe have a yes-and-no paradox here. I dial “1” at 11:00 if and only if I don’t\nget a call at 10:00, but I get a call at 10:00 if and only if I dial “1” at\n11:00. In other words, I get a call at 10:00 if and only if I don’t get a call\nat 10:00. This particular paradox was first raised in a paper by G. Benford,\nD. Book, and W. Newcomb, “The Tachyonic Antitelephone” (1970). Gregory Benford\nis, by the way, a science fiction writer, as well as being a physicist. The\n“tachyons” his paper refers to are hypothetical particles that, unlike\nordinary mass particles, _always_ go faster than light. Benford’s paper argues\nthat since tachyons could be used to send messages into one’s own past, it\nmust be, even in principle, impossible to detect them. If, then, tachyons are\nreal, they fill a sort of undetectable ghost universe whose time direction is\nin a sense perpendicular to our own time direction.\n\n![img](Images/p217_2.jpg)\n\n_Ships that pass in the night._\n\n[ANSWER 11.1](21_Chapter11.html#ch_11pa_1)\n\nNo. There are probably some sections of y our life that do not involve any\nthoughts at all about the other sections. In “A New Refutation of Time,”\nBorges argues that any state of mind that recurs in your life is _actually the\nsame event._\n\n[ANSWER 11.2](21_Chapter11.html#ch_11pa_2)\n\nDunne’s idea is that at any instant we have a fixed future along a familiar\ntime axis called _T_ 1; but that as a second, higher sort of time, _T_ 2,\nlapses, our future changes. Our actual time motion is a combination of _T_ 1\nmotion, which we might think of as _moving into the future,_ and _T2_ motion,\nwhich we might call _moving into alternate worlds._ When I see something\nunpleasant ahead in this Monday’s _T_ 1 future, I am able to move in the _T_ 2\ndirection into an alternate spacetime with a different _T_ 1 future.\n\n![img](Images/p218_1.jpg)\n\n_Saved by precognition!_\n\nDunne tended to think in terms of infinite regresses. His notion of time leads\nto a regress, for if the dreaming mind can see ahead into _T_ 1 future, it is\nnot unreasonable to suppose that it can also see into _T_ 2 future. And if you\ncan see _T_ 2 future, you can change it, which means that you are really\nmoving along, let us say, _T_ 3 time to a whole different _T_ 1-_T_ 2 plane!\nAnd, of course, there is no stop-ping at _T_ 3: the regress goes on forever.\n\nThe reason Dunne was willing to embrace such a crazy system is that he was so\ndissatisfied with a simple Minkowski diagram’s inability to depict our feeling\nthat _time really passes._ As we discuss in [chapter 11](21_Chapter11.html),\nany attempt to “animate” a Minkowski diagram by thinking of a “focus of\nconsciousness” moving up along one’s world line leads to the Dunne-style\nregress.\n\n![img](Images/p219_1.jpg)\n\n_“You’re going to do it till you get it right!”_\n\nIn his 1885 story “An Unfinished Communication,” Charles Howard Hinton\ndescribes a somewhat different sort of two-dimensional time. Hinton’s concept\nis that one’s life is repeated over and over, but with slight changes possible\neach time. After doing y our life often enough, you finally get it right.\n\n[ANSWER 11.3](21_Chapter11.html#ch_11pa_3)\n\nNo, this is just another example of a region of fact-space having a vague\nposition relative to one axis (your opinion), but a sharp posi-tion relative\nto another axis (the other person’s opinion). If you are close enough to a\nperson to be in some sense part of him (or her), then your opinion of him will\nevolve continuously with him. But if you are separated for a while and then\nbrought back together, the other person’s many possible states will seem to\ncollapse down to one or two definite facts. In quantum mechanics this abrupt\nchange is called “the collapse of the wave function.” It is worth noting that,\nin certain relaxed states, you are yourself spread out in fact-space, even\nrelative to your own axes. That is, if you are not presently asking yourself\nwhether you are happy, then there is, at present, no definite answer to the\nquestion. Sharp or hazy, reality is just what it seems.\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\nAbbott, Edwin Abbott. _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions._ 1884\\.\nReprint.
