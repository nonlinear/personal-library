Daily\nbooks of spells, goddesses, simple advice, daily living, sexual positions,\ncreativity guides, meditations, journaling suggestions, recipes, happiness\nboosters, motivations, and ideas ad infinitum for each day of the year.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to discover no tarot book for each day of the year\nexisted, especially since for many cartomancers (a fancy name for tarot\nlovers), tarot is a hallowed daily practice. Pulling daily cards is not only\nan excellent tarot learning tool but a ritual for what I’d imagine are\nhundreds of thousands of readers.\n\nEven my sister, director of a large drug addiction rehabilitation facility in\nthe healing airs of Malibu, California, pulls a card from her mermaid deck for\nguidance and inspiration before important meetings. She wouldn’t describe\nherself as a tarotist, but she understands the importance of a clear, concise\nmessage or theme when one is needed and the usefulness of a card as a focal\npoint when focus is called for.\n\nThis is the sublime nature of tarot: tarot pulls focus. It gives your\nattention a resting point. The dialogue a reader has with their cards is a\nrapid-fire, emotion-filled experience leading to informed decision-making and\nchange. Why? Because we tend to live in our heads and in the experience of our\nbrains. Tarot brings us out of ourselves. It moves our perception outwards and\nonto the cards before us. Rather than living with the possibility imagined in\nour mind’s eye, the possibility is spread on the table before us. This small\nbit of space—this foot or two of distance between reader and cards—allows us\nperspective. Like the value of age and wisdom, tarot spreads allow us to step\nback, reevaluate, and consider motives, actions, and outcomes from a different\nvantage point. In this space intuition leaps to life and we actively listen\nfor guidance.\n\nFor many of us, this is done on a daily basis. So why not create a tarot\nspread for each and every day of the year?\n\nOn Questioning\n\nThe root of a question is a quest—a journey, act, or instance of seeking or\npursuing something. A tarot reading is a search, a journey, a quest for truth.\nTarot decks lie in wait for your questions: “What do I want to know, see,\nmeditate on—?” The first thing a tarot reader asks the client is, “What do you\nwant to know?” To come to tarot is to come with a curious mind. A tarot spread\ncan alter the course of your life—or not; it is entirely up to you. Will you\nsit on the information gathered or will you act on it?\n\nAt some point in the process of writing this book, it occurred to me that\nthere must be a set number of questions someone could ask about themselves and\ntheir life. While each individual’s journey is infinite, the language\nsurrounding the journey, the articulation of those questions, must have a set\nlimit. The questions wouldn’t include the likes of “What makes volcanoes\nerupt?” though you can ask tarot anything you want. This book is concerned\nwith questions in regard to one’s life: “Does he love me? Am I making the\nright choice? What should I do?” There are small differences in how questions\nare phrased, but the essential quest, search, desire, and intended or hoped\nfor outcome is essentially a set number. This is why most tarot readings come\ndown to the same few subjects: love, money, career, and life path.\n\nInterestingly, the relatively small number of questions one could ask doesn’t\nmake the experience of life feel small; it’s quite the opposite. Magic and\nuniqueness occur in the way we color our existence. We are far from robots\noperating in a factory line of mindless repetition. A simple description of\nthe human body states two arms, two legs, one heart, one brain. On the\nsurface, this appears simple, set, and staid. But the way we inhabit our\nbodies is unique. Therein lies infinity. And if you don’t believe me, look at\nthe bodies ambling down Forty- Second Street in New York City. Gaze at ballet\ndancers leaping across the stage. Watch toddlers move. Infinity exists amidst\nessentials.\n\nSmall, finite sets of human existence are apparent everywhere. The twelve\nsigns of the zodiac cover the fundamental qualities indicative of the human\npsyche, thus millions of people look at the same horoscope and say, “Yes. This\nis me!” Shakespeare’s thirty-seven plays comprise the essential dramatic\nnarrative of human existence. He’s told all of our stories. The Hero’s Journey\nis apparent in cross-cultural mythology. Its narrative arc is rife through the\nmajor arcana and resonates with every person on earth. All religious dogma\nboils down to a handful of essential truths. Our life ultimately contains a\nfew vital themes, issues, and problems. We find ourselves continually working\nout these same issues over and over again. Even sacred geometry tells us\nnature is made of repetitive patterns. The tiny spiral of a black snail in\nmorning sunlight is the same shape of spiral galaxies light years away in\nouter space. Everything repeats.\n\nWith repetitiveness comes opportunity—a chance to do something again, to\ncultivate newness, to reach higher, to love deeper, to become smarter. And if\nwe are lucky—if we work hard, if we question well amidst the\nrepetition—something Charles Darwin referred to as “saltation” occurs: the\npattern changes.\n\nOn Being Human\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh is one of humanity’s earliest surviving works of\nliterature and the subject of a college lecture I think of often. “Why do we\ncare?” asks Ron Long, professor of religion at Hunter College. “Why bother to\nread this ancient story? Why does it matter?” Great question. Why consider an\nold story like Gilgamesh? Why study a 4,000-year-old adventure about two best\nfriends?\n\n“It matters,” Long explains, “because it is what makes us human.” The second\nhalf of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh’s heartbreak and distress when his best\nfriend is killed. Gilgamesh’s sorrow is excruciating and sends him off on a\nquest for immortality. Long’s point is that the sudden loss of a best friend\nfor a person living 4,000 years ago is as heartfelt, as tragic, as it is for\nus today. Four thousand years later we remain the same delicate, fragile, and\nemotional creatures we have always been. External circumstances may be\ndifferent—we may fly in airplanes rather than ride camels to traverse\ndeserts—but at our core, we are the same. We are human.\n\nApproaching 365 Tarot Spreads, I encountered, once again, that not much\nseparates us from our ancestors or our neighbors. The challenge was writing a\nbook where anyone, anywhere, could discover a set of questions applicable to\ntheir current situation, desires, and needs—to make it possible for anyone, in\nany situation, to find articulation for their quest.\n\nIt is the same goal a professional tarot reader faces: to offer insight and\ninformation to the people who come to them. People from all walks of life\ncross the path of the professional reader: young, old, wealthy, poor, bored,\nexcited, depressed, enthused. The professional tarot reader becomes an\ninadvertent sociologist. Within the intimate framework of a reading, be it a\nfive- or fifty- minute session, as complete strangers bare their hearts and\nsouls, a delicate lesson is learned and relearned. We are the same. We are\nhuman.\n\nFrom Superbowl athletes to Little League coaches, from movie starlets to\nhousekeepers, from the wealthy to the poor, it doesn’t matter; each person\nyearns for love and validation as much as you do. People’s questions are the\nsame. No matter class, color, or creed, everyone wants love, security, and\nacceptance from their peers. Everyone desires a sense of belonging and\npurpose. Our essential needs and desires remain the same.\n\nI get the feeling that if any of us sat in ancient Babylon in the corner of a\nbar, reading tarot for those Babylonians, the questions asked would be the\nsame questions people ask today because we are all human. We all feel scared,\nwe all feel rejection, we are all uncertain, we all have highs and lows. At\nour core we are all the same.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Because it means we are not alone.\n\nOn Time\n\nWriting a book for each day of the year, one begins to consider with greater\ninterest the nature of a calendar. What is it and why? Calendars exist to mark\nthe passage of time. Ancient people crawled out of caves, and as summer days\ngrew longer, they knew more sunlight meant greater safety from the hungry\nbeasts lurking in darkness. Our first calendars were the glittering\nconstellations, our night sky. In agricultural societies, calendars let us\nknow when to plant and harvest. Calendar knowledge equaled survival. The\nIndustrial Revolution brought calendars and clocks telling factory workers\nwhen to get up and go to work. We are not much different than our farming or\nfactory-working forebears. We use time to coordinate busy lives, careers,\nschedules, knowing when and where to be. At the movies, we calculate with\nprecision the time it takes to get our popcorn before the previews begin.\n\nBut time offers us something more on a profound level: security. Life’s true\nnature is terrifying; it is random. On a deep level we intellectually realize\nEarth is literally spinning beneath our feet, hurtling through space. We know,\non the other side of the world, people are literally upside down from us but\nfeel right-side up to themselves. We know from the painful lessons of tragedy\nthat life can change in the blink of an eye. But time is something we can\ndepend upon. Humanity’s agreement of time is regulated. If you buy a ticket to\nsee Bruno Mars next Saturday at 8 PM, 25,000 other people will show up right\nalongside you to hear the Mars man sing. The dependability and agreeability of\ntime makes it a comforting thing, so calendars prevail and a year is sliced\ninto 365 sunrises and sunsets.\n\nBut time is a slippery subject. None of us know how much time we have. When we\nfind out our time is up, it will be too late. Why, when we were ten years old,\ndid a summer last forever but fly in the blink of an eye at age thirty? Maybe\nbecause children live in terms of possibility, while adults tend to live in\nrelation to the past. We all fall prey to living in relation to the past. But\ntarot intercedes. Tarot contains a gift. Tarot, like childhood, presents us\nwith the possible. Each time we flip a card, we sense the possibility. This is\nwhy no matter how many years you’ve worked with tarot, every time you pull a\ncard feels like the first time you’ve ever done so; it’s why tarot never loses\nits excitement. Tarot makes virgins of all of us.\n\nAuthor Jeanette Winterson says time stops everything from happening at once.\nShe says there are two times: that time belonging to the outer world—to the\ncalendar, Earth’s revolutions around the sun—and time in our personal inner\nworld, our inner landscape. Inside ourselves, we experience events as if time\nwere happening simultaneously. To challenge linear time, realize that events\nseparated by years lie side by side imaginatively and emotionally inside of\nyou. She suggests an attempt to live in total time. While abiding by the time\non my computer, I simultaneously feel the warmth of my first real kiss, the\nthrill running down my spine, the smell of his skin, the song playing in the\nbackground. I am fourteen and I am forty-two, in two places at once. Can you\ndo this? Of course you can. You are a supernatural creature. You too can live\nin total time.\n\nIt is the province of the tarot reader to move backwards, forwards, even\nsideways in time. It is what we do best. Readers, our cards—our\nimaginations—lie outside of calendar time. These are the highways, landscapes,\nand environments visited by shamans, artists, seers, and mystics—the world of\nthe imagination. Story, essence, truth, gods, eternity, and symbols exist\nhere. This is why tarot is a gateway to worlds of esoteric study, why tarot is\nan entrance to the occult. Because what is hidden can only be revealed by\nexperience. Archetypes are experiential. Tarot is experiential.\n\nThis is what Greece’s ancient mystery schools offered. Their lessons could not\nbe taught, explained, or orated. The lessons had to be experienced. You can’t\nknow the mystery until you experience the mystery. A boy in a New Guinea tribe\ncannot be lectured on his initiatory experience. He is given tools for\nsurvival for his three-day initiation in the woods. He is equipped and taught\nto fend off wild beasts, but his experience occurs alone. He quests for\nhimself. He comes through the process changed. This is exactly what the Fool\ndoes. This is what tarot does. It is what you will do if you allow it. This\nquest occurs outside of calendar time. It is entirely internal. And 365 Tarot\nSpreads is here for you on the outside, provoking you with questions and ideas\nwhen you need them.\n\nI hope you enjoy this book—hope it aids you, no matter your quest. May the\nroads you choose be filled with magic and wonder, with galaxies of possibility\nand oceans of love. Hopefully you’ll never have to use the Divorce Spread, the\nRejection Spread, or the Letting Go Spread. But life is full of bumps and\nbruises just as it is full of soft baby kisses and snuggles, so the spreads\nare there in case you need them.\n\nI hope you find your truth and that when you do, you stand in the middle of it\nstrong, beautiful, and nimble like the World dancer. Because when the Fool\nfollowed her own path and trusted herself, she found herself in the World. And\nby the time she did, she was so high on the music—so enraptured by the\ndancing, so lost in the beauty, so in tune with herself, and so filled with\nmagic—she didn’t even realize that she’d arrived at her destination.\n\nSasha Graham\n\nnew york city, 2013\n\n[[contents]](index_split_005.html#filepos5909)\n\n\n> January • 1\n\n![](images/00223.jpg)\n\nVision Board Spread\n\nOn This Day\n\n> Julius Caesar established January 1 as the first day of the year in 46 BCE.\n> This was partly to honor the god Janus, for whom January is named.\n\nWelcome to the first day of the year!

Use the Vision Board Spread whenever you begin construction on\na new vision board.\n\nCast Your Cards\n\nThis spread lays out like a vision board.

Tarot teacher Ruth Ann Amberstone explains, “Simply trust\n> yourself. You will know when they are speaking. You will know when they have\n> left.”\n\nAncestors’ Day (Jour des Aieux) occurs today on the tropical island of Haiti.\nThe celebration rings in the new year while honoring the past. Haitians\nremember those who have died within the previous twelve months and pay homage\nto those who perished fighting for Haitian independence in the early\nnineteenth century.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00127.jpg)\n\n> The Ten of Pentacles represents pedigree, bloodlines, and the family tree.\n> Complete, strong, and resistant to the ravages of time, it is the card of\n> evolution and kindred connection. Drawing this card is a reminder we play\n> but a small role in the tapestry of a larger generational story.\n\nWould you like to speak to your ancestors? Communicate with the spirit world\nusing tarot. Conversations with guides, angels, and ancestors will spring\nforth between cards and candle. Use this spread to converse with souls of\nfamily members who have gone before you.\n\nCast Your Cards\n\nFamily magic and wisdom is collected by casting your cards in the shape of a\nfamily tree.\n\n![](images/00137.jpg)\n\n> 1\\.

People,\n> events, animals, and the natural world all affect how we feel.\n\nThe feast of Saint Genevieve, patron saint of Paris, is celebrated today.\nGenevieve reported frequent visions of heavenly saints and angels from a young\nage. Graced with clairvoyance and miracle working, it is said her prayers and\nfasting saved Paris from a harrowing attack from Attila the Hun in 451 CE.\nLegend also states when her relics (pieces of her body kept as objects of\nreverence) were carried through the streets during the Parisian plague in\n1129, she miraculously intervened to stop the spread of the plague as the\ndeath toll plummeted.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00337.jpg)\n\n> The Queen of Wands maintains the strongest energetic field in the deck\n> because she commands the element of fire, passion, and spirituality. If you\n> plan on reading tarot for others, energetic protection and grounding is\n> important. It is possible to unintentionally absorb the querent’s energies,\n> both positive and negative.\n\nChannel St. Genevieve’s good graces when you feel the need for extra strength\nand protection. The questions ponder from whom, how, and why you might need\nextra security and care.\n\nCast Your Cards\n\nWitches often raise cones of energy (recall the symbolism of a witch’s hat)\nwhen needing kinetic protection. Imagine a cone of protective white light\naround you while casting your cards.\n\n![](images/00405.jpg)\n\n> 1\\. Am I open to the influence of others?\n\n> 2\\. What energy surrounds me?\n\n> 3\\.

Quitting school at age\n> eleven, he started a ferry business shuttling passengers between Manhattan\n> and Staten Island. On his deathbed, he’d amassed a 100-million-dollar\n> fortune in shipping and railroads.\n\nIndustrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt, one of the wealthiest men of American\nhistory, died on this day in 1877. Leaving most of his fortune to his son\nHenry, who doubled it, this patriarch is ancestor to Gloria Vanderbilt and\nAnderson Cooper. The Vanderbilts created luxurious residences, many of which\nare open today for public touring, and left a legacy of philanthropy including\nVanderbilt University and the Medical School at Columbia University.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00279.jpg)\n\n> The Ace of Pentacles represents the revitalization of finance, new forms of\n> income, and the manifestation of a goal. The fertile garden indicates that\n> growth is essential. Money spent is returned twofold, and often it\n> represents a financial windfall or inheritance.\n\nAre you about to make a large purchase? The Big Purchase Spread uses captains\nof finance for inspiration when contemplating financial decisions. Summon a\nVanderbilt with your cards and invest wisely.\n\nCast Your Cards\n\nIs the item in question worth the money you are about to spend?

Dedicated to the admiration and\npreservation of birds, it also raises people’s awareness for birds held in\ncaptivity. Unbound by human laws of nature, birds often represent a link\nbetween conscious and subconscious, heaven and earth, groundedness and\npossibility. Birds are universally understood as a symbol for soul, anima,\nfreedom, or the world soul hidden in matter.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00389.jpg)\n\n> The Nine of Pentacles holds a fierce falcon on her delicately gloved hand.\n> This falcon represents loyalty. Bird images in tarot represent the highest\n> aspects of our being taking flight and the ability to reach beyond our\n> normal perceptions and boundaries.\n\nMuddled by decisions? Confused about your path? Taking a bird’s-eye view\noffers a unique way to evaluate your life and choices. This helpful strategy\nasks you to float up and look at your life from a bird’s perspective. This\nwide angle renders small things as they truly are—insignificant—and focuses on\nwhat is truly important in the grand scheme of life.\n\nCast Your Cards\n\nShuffle your cards while thinking about the question at hand. Eyes closed,\nstart throwing cards on the table in front of you. Look down like a god from\nabove to discover which cards land upright and face you. Read these cards left\nto right to answer the Bird’s-Eye View Spread’s questions.\n\n> 1\\. What is my situation?\n\n> 2\\. What didn’t I see before?\n\n> 3\\. How do I best see the overall view?\n\n> 4\\. What becomes apparent when looking down from above?\n\n> 5\\. Where am I heading?\n\n> 6\\. What is truly important?\n\n> 7\\.

Understanding cue, routine, and reward, simply change the\n> routine to something healthy and positive.\n\nToday, the twelfth day after Christmas, or Twelfth Night, is known as Little\nChristmas in Ireland. Older calendars that use the Julian calendar mark today\nas the traditional Christmas celebration. Modern practices dictate today as\nthe traditional end of the holiday season, when trimmings are removed and\nfestoons are swept away till next year.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00200.jpg)\n\n> Swords are the wickedly sharp suit of elimination. Swords can feel frightful\n> because they represent thoughts, calculation, and change. Embrace the\n> fierceness of a sword when slicing away a habit.\n\nWhy not rid a bad habit as you clean? Remove decorations and make this task a\nmagical metaphor. Decide a bad habit will be removed right along with holiday\nfrill. This spread helps you identify and remove pesky habits, and it’s best\ndone before decoration removal.\n\nCast Your Cards\n\nIn your mind’s eye, picture yourself free of the habit. Imagine yourself as\nyou’d like to be. In a calm and focused manner, cast the cards in the shape of\nthe holiday garland soon to be removed.\n\n![](images/00276.jpg)\n\n> 1\\. My habit.\n\n> 2\\.

Unable to walk, she took up\n> cooking, giving her mother’s boarding house a reputation for amazing meals.\n> Publishing cookbooks and opening a cooking school, her story reminds us that\n> our greatest tragedies often define who we are.\n\nThe Fannie Farmer Cookbook, a gastronomic classic, was published this day in\n1896. Its emphasis on good foods, fresh flavor, and variety is why it remains\na favorite to this day.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00341.jpg)\n\n> The Three of Pentacles depicts three figures in discussion about the\n> building of a sacred space. Often representing collaboration, you can also\n> understand this card as growing in healthy ways and the sacred space being\n> your body.\n\nThe consumption and preparation of food is a connection to the life force\nitself—an opportunity to indulge in pleasure and health simultaneously.

For instance,\nhearing a Beethoven concerto, you also taste chocolate. Upon hearing the\nconcerto, you would always experience the taste of chocolate.

Held in honor of the deity Saturn, who ruled over a\npreexisting Golden Age, the revelries of Saturnalia reflected a desire to\nreturn to that once mythical age.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00406.jpg)\n\n> The Four of Wands is the festival and celebration card.

Druids saw\n> mistletoe as a gift fallen from heaven. The earliest documented case of\n> mistletoe kissing was found in sixteenth-century England.\n\nPucker up: it is good luck to kiss under the mistletoe at this time of year.\nAlthough mistletoe is a parasitic plant that absorbs nutrients from tree\ntrunks, it has been inspiring romance for generations across cultures.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00242.jpg)\n\n> The Lovers card relates to kissing and all other acts of physical love.

New Orleans,\n> seeped in the lore of the old South, earns another top spot in the nation’s\n> most ghostly, haunted, and unsettled locations.\n\nOn this day in 1975, the Lutz family moved into 112 Ocean Avenue, aka the\nAmityville Horror house. The rest is history. The Amityville Horror book and\nfilm terrorized a generation.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00017.jpg)\n\n> In the Rider-Waite version of the Four of Cups, a hand appears like a\n> ghostly specter reaching out to an unsuspecting fellow.

Tarot can be a tool of communication, a\nsurvey of the circumstances surrounding the haunting, and can be used for\nsuggestions on how to clear a space. This spread, inspired by one of the worst\nhauntings ever, aims to do that.\n\nCast Your Cards\n\n![](images/00332.jpg)\n\nCast in the classic shape of protection, a cross:\n\n> 1\\.

During\nthese long, dark nights, it is the perfect time to contemplate a phenomenon\nyou may have experienced or heard about. Shadow people, otherwise known as\nshadow men or shadow folk, are seen in a person’s peripheral vision—sometimes\njust shadows quickly disappearing, some red eyed, and some report a man with a\nfedora-type hat.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00063.jpg)\n\n> In the Seven of Cups, dreams float in the air while the figure watching may\n> be in an altered state of consciousness.

Ashes and charred bits of wood were kept until the following year.\n\nYule, occurring between December 20 and 22, is a modern Wiccan sabbat falling\non the winter solstice and also an alternative way to celebrate Christmas by\nrecognizing its Pagan roots. It is also known as a Nordic Pagan festival.\n\nSummation of Spread\n\n> ![](images/00120.jpg)\n\n> The four cardinal directions are seen in both the Wheel of Fortune card and\n> the World card, where creatures are depicted in the four corners.\n\nMark today’s occasion by performing this special spread.

This book is divided into two sections; Part 1\nis a quick and easy guide to doing a basic reading, using a simple three card\nlayout; Past, Present and Future and using the basic interpretations for the\ncards.\n\nThis is a great way to familiarise yourself with the cards; later in part 2 we\nwill be learning to use the ‘Celtic Cross’ layout, which is probably the most\ncommonly used layout and a more in-depth explanation of the cards. This layout\nis used worldwide by professional and amateurs tarot readers alike. Remember,\nkeeping it simple is the key to successfully learning to read the tarot, so\nplease don’t try to remember the meanings of the cards. I want you to learn to\ntrust your feelings, intuition, because a card may trigger one set of feelings\nin one layout or reading and the same card trigger a completely different set\nof feelings in another layout or reading. The explanation given for each of\nthe cards is only a guide and not a hard and fast rule.\n\nGet used to handling and giving basic interpretations of the cards first. As\nyou become more proficient and have more experience reading the cards, you\nwill begin to develop your intuitive and psychic side, enabling you to give\nmore detailed readings. But all in good time, of course, it is only natural\nwhen you get your first Tarot deck, that you will want to get straight into\nreading the cards, but be patient - take it step by step and it will pay off\nin the long run. Learning the Tarot can be an enjoyable journey of self-\ndiscovery.\n\nDifferent readers have different ideas as to how Tarot works and many psychics\nbelieve the power is inherent within the reader to tap into universal\nunderstandings, and the cards are simply a medium to help trigger that\npersonal talent. Others may speak of tapping into a \"universal mind\" or\n\"universal consciousness.\" Still others credit the influence of gods or other\nsupernatural beings to place the cards in a meaningful order. I can’t tell you\nhow the Tarot works nor can I tell you how electricity works. I do know that\nif I press a switch on the wall the light will come on.\n\nI know that this happens and I also know that Tarot cards work. I believe we\nall have psychic abilities and that there is a higher wisdom or spiritual\nguidance system that we can tap into, once we have the correct tools. That’s\nwhat your Tarot deck is – a medium which allows you to open your mind and use\nyour psychic abilities to derive meanings from particular layouts for a\nparticular person or question.\n\nAt first glance the Tarot is very attractive and many are drawn to it. We\nspend a lot of money buying decks and instruction books, only to find a huge\ncomplexity of spiritual and psychological meanings. These interpretations are\nrelevant but not at the early stages as they often put people off learning the\nTarot. In this book, I have tried to keep the meanings and explanations as\nsimple as possible.\n\nTake plenty of time to familiarise yourself with the deck. By handling and\nusing it again and again before even attempting to do a full reading, you will\nbecome more comfortable with your deck and the various meanings of each card.\nThis will ensure that you will be more open to the intuitive guidance of the\ncards, and not just following the explanations given.\n\nTarot cards are commonly used to measure potential outcomes and evaluate\ninfluences surrounding a person, event, or both. The technical term for tarot\nreading is taromancy, divination through the use of tarot cards.\n\nI believe that the future is fluid and thus absolute predictions of future\nevents are not always possible, and predictions are not cast in stone as many\nreaders like to suggest. Instead, it’s better to focus on possible outcomes as\nwell as examining influences related to the issue at hand, influences the\nsubject might not even be aware of before the reading. I believe it’s like\nrolling a road into the future, based on where you are at the moment.\n\nAnd like on any road there will be a crossroads, an opportunity, a bad bend\nand it’s up to you whether you take the opportunity and slow down at the bad\nbend or choose to take a different route. So while the reading suggests or\npredicts what is most likely to happen, you have the free will to influence\nwhat happened, that’s your free will.\n\nTarot reading aids the subject with additional information, another\nperspective, so that he or she may make more informed choices, and should not\nbe seen as coming with any guarantee of ultimate outcomes.\n\nSpreads\n\nA spread is the arrangement of cards dealt in a reading. Each position in a\nspread is associated with a different aspect of the question posed. The two\nmost common layouts are probably the Three Card Reading and the Celtic Cross\nLayout, however there are many other layouts you can use and in time you may\nfind one more suitable for you to do readings reading’s with.\n\nA Reading\n\nWhile each card is interesting in its own right, on its own it is like a\nsingle piece of a jigsaw. It only gives you a part of the picture and its only\nwhen you put an individual card into its position within a structured layout,\nand look at not only the meaning of the card itself, but also at its position\nwithin the layout, and its relationship to the surrounding cards and their\nmeanings, that you begin to see a bigger picture.\n\nThere are two different approaches you can take to a Tarot reading. Firstly\nyou can do a reading related to a specific question. This is where a question\nis posed and you look at the issues the cards drawn in the reading suggest are\ndirectly related to and surrounding that question. Secondly you can do an open\nreading, which is more common, where querent sits for the reading, and no\nparticular question is posed at the beginning.\n\nThis reading tends to highlight important influences and issues in the\nclient’s life at that particular time, and as the reading continues\ninteraction usual opens between querent and the reader, with questions being\nposed from both sides to clarify things.\n\nThe Tarot Deck - Major and Minor Arcana\n\nThe standard tarot deck is actually made up of a combination of two separate\ntypes of cards: Major and Minor Arcana (Arcana meaning secret). The Minor\nArcana are similar to a deck of regular playing cards, except that each suit\nhas one extra card. In the court cards of the regular playing deck there is\nthe Jack, Queen and King (male, female and male) In the Tarot deck there is\none extra Court Card, the Page (female), which was introduced to balance up\nthe male-female imbalance of the regular deck.\n\nThe Minor Arcana is divided into four suits, with each suit having one card\nfor 1 to 10, plus the Court Cards, Page, Knight, Queen, King. The Minor Arcana\ncan be seen to represent the more day to day events, while the Major Arcana\nrepresent life changing events and stand-alone cards with their own unique\nmeanings. These include cards like the Devil, Strength, Temperance, the Hanged\nMan, the Fool, and Death.\n\n  \n\n# PART 1 \\- Practice with the Major Arcana\n\nThe Major Arcana\n\n0 |  The Fool |  11 |  Justice  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 |  The Magician |  12 |  The Hanged Man  \n2 |  The High Priestess |  13 |  Death  \n3 |  The Empress |  14 |  Temperance  \n4 |  The Emperor |  15 |  The Devil  \n5 |  The Hierophant |  16 |  The Tower  \n6 |  The Lovers |  17 |  The Star  \n7 |  The Chariot |  18 |  The Moon  \n8 |  Strength |  19 |  The Sun  \n9 |  The Hermit |  20 |  Judgement  \n10 |  The Wheel of Fortune |  21 |  The World  \n  \nUsing only the Major Arcana: Taking one card at a time, starting with the\n‘Fool’ read over the reference for that particular card in the book; then\nspend a little time studying the image on the card, and ask yourself the\nfollowing questions:\n\nHow do you initially feel about the card?\n\nWhat thoughts does this card bring to mind?\n\nTry to identify with the positive parts of the imagery that is the parts you\nfeel attracted to and then the negative parts of the imagery - the parts you\ndo not like. It is important that you see both the positive and the negative\nsides of each card. Make some short notes on your initial impressions and then\nrefer to the book again and see how the Key words relate to the images and to\nyour notes. See if you can relate the card and key words with a particular\nissue or time in your life. Try to remember how you felt both psychically and\nemotionally at that particular time.\n\nTake as much time as you need to become familiar with each card of the Major\nArcana.\n\nAt this stage, you are only scratching the surface, as learning the Tarot is a\ncontinual process. As you practice and read the cards, the deeper meanings\nbecome clearer. I can honestly say that now, after more than twenty years of\nstudying the Tarot, I still learn something new every day. Over the years, I\nhave re-evaluated my feelings and interpretation of each card many times.\n\n##### Now start to do simple 3 card practice readings for yourself and your\nfriends, only using the Major Arcana.\n\nPast – Present – Future\n\nShuffle the Major Arcana and draw three cards, without using the book, study\nthe cards in their positions, taking your time make notes on your thoughts on\neach card in its position and then refer to the book. Each time you do one of\nthese reading try to place it into an experience or a situation from your or\nin your own life. See too if you can find a friend or friends who are prepared\nto work with you.\n\nFor this example, let’s assume that you draw the following cards:\n\nThe Tower in the Past position\n\nThe Star in the Present position\n\nThe World in the Future position\n\nThe Tower (Key Words: Unexpected Change, Sudden Reversals)\n\nIn the Past position, the Tower indicates that unexpected changes have\nhappened, and that these changes were outside of your control. Plans that were\nbuilt on a false sense of security come falling down. It can also indicate\nthat change outside of your control brings freedom from negative influences,\npeople, places and environments.\n\nThe Star (Key Words: Sense of Purpose, Inspiring Wishes, Dreams)\n\nIn the Present position, the Star inspires you to reach for our highest\npotential. Even though negative changes may have happened as shown by the\nTower, the Star of hope inspires you to have faith in yourself.

There is a sense\nof completion. The lessons of the Tower have been learned.\n\nRepeat this layout drawing different from only the Major Arcana cards until\nyou feel comfortable with it and are ready to move on the next stage.\n\n  \n\n# PART 2 - Practice with the Minor Arcana\n\n#\n\nAs we saw in the last chapter that the Major Arcana gives us important\ninformation, but using the Major Arcana on its own does not give us a complete\npicture. The Minor Arcana helps us complete the picture by supplying the\nmissing detailed or everyday information. An easy way to learn the Minor\nArcana is to understand the meanings of the Suits and then blend them with the\nmeanings of the individual card numbers.\n\nWe start this section by looking at the meanings of each of the four suits and\nthen at the relevance of each of the numbers 1 – 10. We will look at the Court\ncards separately in the next chapter. Taking this format, when you draw a\nMinor Arcana card you only have to think of the meaning of the suit and then\nthe number, then by combining the two it gives you a point to work from. This\nformat certainly simplifies the meaning, but as I said earlier as you become\nmore proficient at understanding the basics you will naturally develop a\ndeeper understanding of the meanings.\n\nThe numbered cards of which there are ten in each suit.\n\nThe Court cards of which there are four in each suit.\n\nI would like you now to take time to familiarise yourself with all the cards\nof the Minor Arcana. As I mentioned earlier, the Major Arcana deals with major\ninfluences and the Minor Arcana deals with more mundane, everyday issues.\n\nWith the Minor Arcana, it is important to combine the influence of the nature\nof the suit with the number of the relevant card. You will see from the\nlisting below that Wands represents Fire, Creativity etc., and an Ace\nrepresents new beginnings. Combining these two, we can then see that the Ace\nof Wands would represent the start of a new creative phase.\n\nThe Suits are:\n\nWands |  Inspiration and creativity |  Fire  \n---|---|---  \nSwords |  Mental energy, strife and turmoil |  Air  \nPentacles |  Material and financial issues |  Earth  \nCups |  Emotions and affairs of the heart |  Water  \n  \nWands:\n\nThe suit of Wands represents inspiration and creativity, an awakening, the\nvital life force. New ideas, a new outlook, a new creative attitude. Imagine\nthere is a candle flickering away inside, and suddenly it becomes fuelled with\na new energy. There is a sense of physical energy and the motivation to\nachieve success.\n\nSwords:\n\nOften seen as the most painful and sorrowful suit of the Tarot. Yes – it’s\ntrue! They may indicate trouble, strife, and turmoil, but they also indicate\ncourage and mental energy, and the ability to instigate positive change.\n\nPentacles:\n\nHere we have the practical material Pentacles, indicating finance and money\nmatters. They represent physical and material goods and practical values; also\nphysical possessions, including relationships.\n\nCups:\n\nCups represent Water, the vital life fluid. Water in the Tarot represents\nemotions, and the importance of love in our daily lives. It is human nature to\ndesire nurturing and caring, we hurt when we lose some one we love, either\nthrough the break-up of a relationship or though death.\n\n  \n\n# The Numbered Cards:\n\nAces: New beginnings.\n\nTwo’s: Partnerships, duality.\n\nThree’s: Consolidation, the first stages of making new ideas work.\n\nFour’s: Foundation, stability.\n\nFive’s: Competition, instability.\n\nSix’s: Creative dreams at work. Success\n\nSeven’s: Success against opposition, unexpected change.\n\nEight’s: Positive or negative movement.\n\nNine’s: Contentment, fulfilment, great loss or anxiety.\n\nTen’s: Renewal, mastery.\n\nSo, only using the numbered cards of one suit, and without referring to the\ninstruction book, spend a little time studying the image on each card, keeping\nin mind the following questions:\n\nHow do you initially feel about the card?\n\nWhat thoughts does this card bring to mind?\n\nTry to identify with the positive parts of the imagery, that is the parts you\nfeel attracted too and then the negative parts of the imagery or the parts you\ndo not like, keeping in mind both the value and the suit of the card. Make\nsome short notes on your initial impressions and then refer to the book and\nsee how the Key words relate to the images and to your notes.\n\nThen see if you can relate the card and key words with a particular issue or\ntime in your life, trying to remember how you felt both psychically and\nemotionally at that particular time. Repeat with each of the other suits of\nthe Minor Arcana, and then you are ready to move onto the Court cards.\n\n# The Court Cards\n\nTraditionally in the Tarot, the Court Cards represent people rather than\nsituations or events. But this is not always true, so it is important that\nwhen reading Court cards that you look carefully at the surrounding cards,\nallowing them to guide you. If a Court card is placed in one of the main\npositions, it can indicate the personality of the person.\n\nOr it can indicate that a particular person is going to play an important part\nin influencing the outcome of the question or situation. This may be positive\nor negative, depending on the card itself and the surrounding cards. One other\nattribute of the lower Court cards i.e. the Knight and Page is that they can\nalso represent opportunities or news, again this may be positive or negative.\n\nBelow I have shown some of the values placed on the Court cards. Keep in mind,\nhowever, that a King does not necessarily mean a man or a Queen a woman.\nNowadays we see the cards in a more “asexual” way. For example we may see, in\ndoing a reading for a man, that there are a number of very strong Queen Cards.\n\nThis can indicate that this person has strong traditionally feminine\ncharacteristics e.g. a caring, nurturing temperament. Likewise for a woman, a\nvery strong King influence suggests that this woman may have strong\ntraditional male characteristics. For the sake of simplicity, below I refer to\nthe Court cards as they are depicted, rather than the characteristics they\nrepresent i.e. the Page and Queens are often referred to as “she” and the\nKnight and Kings as “he”.\n\nAgain, take as much time as is necessary to become completely familiar with\nthe court cards, as they are very important within a reading, particularly if\nthey are in an influential position.\n\nThe Page’s\n\nWands: Represents An enthusiastic woman who is dynamic and creative; She\nenjoys living for the moment, loves challenge and is often the bearer of good\nnews.\n\nMessage It may be time to use your creativity and start in a new direction, no\nmatter what your age. In a career reading it can indicate the offer of a job\nor a new opportunity to do with business.\n\nCups: Represents The opportunity to start a new relationship or partnership.\nIt can also suggest the redevelopment of an old relationship or development of\na present relationship to a deeper emotional level.\n\nMessage The arrival of good news or news to do with the birth of a child.\n\nSwords: Represents A mentally active and highly skilled woman who stimulates\nnew ideas and thoughts. Though not always grounded, the Page can act as a\ncatalyst and give inspiration to others who can take these ideas and develop\nthem in a more practical way. In a relationship reading it suggests that you\nhave a dreamy attitude to love and romance.\n\nMessage News that indicates complete change for the better or worse.\n\nPentacles: Represents A reliable young woman who will not be easily distracted\nfrom her course of action. A good time to start a new job or change direction.\nThe influence of someone who has good business senses or is financially sound.\n\nMessage Good news about a new job, money or signing a contract.\n\nThe Knight’s\n\nWands: Represents An enthusiastic man who is dynamic and creative. He enjoys\nliving in the moment, loves a challenge and is often the bearer of good news.\nIn a career reading it can indicate the offer of a job or a new opportunity to\ndo with business.\n\nMessage It’s time to use your creativity and start in a new direction, no\nmatter what your age.\n\nCups: Represents A man who is enthusiastic and open to new ideas. As with\nCups, this man has a good understanding of his emotions and is probably\noffering the opportunity of a new relationship, or wants to develop a\nrelationship to a deeper level.\n\nMessage Your present focus should be on creative, artistic abilities.\n\nSwords: Represents A man who is active and committed to developing his ideas\nto completion. It usually represents a young person with a quick mind, who has\ncome or is coming into your life to offer you something: it may be love, an\nidea or an offer of some kind.\n\nMessage: The arrival of someone who brings new ideas, one who would make a\ngood friend; and equally a good enemy.\n\nPentacles: Represents A practical man who would be a good provider and family\nman. It can also indicate a man who brings practical advice to do with\nfinancial or property matters.\n\nMessage Good news coming to do with financial matters.\n\nThe Queen’s\n\nWands: Represents A woman with a dynamic creative approach to life. She loves\nexcitement and challenges in love, and can be spontaneous and passionate in\nromantic situations. The Queen of Wands describes a woman over 22 years of\nage, with a vibrant, outgoing nature. She acts on her feelings, will be\nconfident and enjoys action. She attracts many friends and her enthusiastic\nenergy is a pleasure to be around.\n\nCups: Represents A woman with a loving and sensitive nature. She is gentle and\nkind and has a deep understanding of emotional issues. Guided by her feelings,\nshe gives good honest advice. However, you may not always like the advice she\ngives, perhaps because you know it to be the truth. Touch is an important part\nof her healing process and she loves to embrace. When in a crisis situation\nher healing energies are tangible, even at a\ndistance.![](../Images/image00171.jpeg)\n\nSwords: Represents A rational woman who is logical with a well functioning\nmind. She has definite ideas as to how thing should be done, and is shrewd and\nmentally agile. She also has a careful approach to relationships and will be\nattracted by mental agility rather that looks or emotions. She tends to\nisolates herself due to emotional disappointments in her past.\n\nPentacles: Represents a woman who enjoys being a socialite and loves\nentertaining. She likes to spend her money carefully, is reliable and down to\nearth by nature. Her caring nature extends to all; she enjoys making others\nhappy. Her advice is practical, and straight to the point. Because she is\nloyal and trusting, she will give you many opportunities to prove yourself,\nbut if you do anything to lose that trust, you may never gain it again.\n\nThe King’s\n\nWands: Represents A man of strong principles, he inspires confidence by his\nskilfulness and his ability to get things done. He is a man with a dynamic,\ncreative energy. His maturity and wisdom can be of great assistance to those\nunder his care. He has a great dislike for routine, loves constant challenge\nand is a great starter of new ideas.\n\nCups: Represents a wise and understanding man with a deep knowledge of the\nworld. He is a caring, sincere individual who responds to the need of others.\nOthers turn to him for advice because they know his intuition is second to\nnone. He is tolerant of views that are opposite to his own and will not be\neasily shocked.\n\nSwords: Represents A clear thinking man who uses his mental abilities to\npursue his goals. He is generally innovative in creating change, and is\ncapable of pursuing many different goals at one time. He is an achiever who\nlays careful plans and makes sure they are followed exactly according to his\nsystem.\n\nPentacles: Represents a man who combines knowledge and practicality to achieve\nhis objectives. He is the builder and manager, a man who has achieved success\nthrough practical effort. He is intelligent and enjoys earning money. Material\nwealth is important, yet he is caring and a good friend. Sometimes seen as the\nbanker.  \n\n  \n\n##\n\n# PART 3 - The Cards of the Major Arcana\n\n# The Fool\n\n“ Act now without concern for the risks “\n\nKey Number: 0\n\nKey Words\n\nAdventure - Excessive\n\nFreedom - Insecurity\n\nInnocence - Disregard\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Fool represents spontaneous action, unlimited potential; you are now ready\nfor change ‘Time to seize the day and enjoy it for what it is’ The Fool can\nappear when you are about to take a risk, and the world around warns caution.\nIt indicates the enthusiasm that accompanies the onset of a new project or\nidea. Unaware of the pitfalls, you wish to embrace the future with great\nenthusiasm. It symbolises the start of a new journey; you have to be prepared\nto take some risks to make big gains.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nIn the reversed position the Fool indicates the desire to be free of\nresponsibility. You are not prepared to take opportunities when they are there\nto be taken. The card suggests a foolishness in thoughts and actions, an\nunwillingness to take responsibility for the consequences of a particular\naction; an immature attitude to everything.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe card of the Fool represents a moment in your life when you meet someone\nnew and something special happens. A spark ignites within and your very life\nforce becomes alive, which can be so alluring that you are prepared go with\nit, despite the risks or consequences involved. In the reversed position, the\nFool suggests that you are misreading your feelings or the intentions of\nanother person. You may be looking at the other person through “rose tinted\nglasses” or that you are fooling yourself about the other person’s response in\na particular situation or circumstance.\n\n  \n\n# The Magician\n\n“I have the power to create”\n\nFirst card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nStrong-willed - Abuse of power\n\nPower to be original  - Hidden truths\n\nAbility to manifest your dreams - Cunning ways\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Magician has four tools available to manifest his will: The Sword of\nIntellect, the Wand of Inspiration, the Cup of Emotion, and the Pentacle of\nPracticality. This card suggests that it is time to approach your life or a\nsituation with a new creative and original approach or attitude. The Magician\ntells you that you have the ability to act not react, you have the will power\nto direct your energy in the direction you want to go. With self-confidence\nyou will gain the knowledge and the ability to tackle the important issues\nthat need to be dealt so that and success can be achieved.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Magician in the reversed position indicates a lack of confidence or loss\nof direction. In the reversed position it can also suggest that, up until now,\nyou have not been prepared to use everything available to find a solution to a\nproblem or issue. It can suggest the use of deception, or that you are using\nyour ability or situation to make profit, or are using others for the wrong\nreasons. In some way the flow of energy is disrupted or blocked.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading the Magician indicates that you have the courage and\nself-confidence to risk rejection and make yourself available and open to new\nrelationship opportunities. You can see the potential of a relationship and\nyou understand what need to done to make it successful. In reverse the\nMagician suggests that your lack of self-confidence and sense of value is\nblocking your ability to open up to new relationship opportunities.\n\n  \n\n# The High Priestess\n\n“I trust my inner feelings”\n\nThe second card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nIntuition - Shallowness\n\nHidden knowledge - Superficiality\n\nDepth and insight - Devious motives\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe High Priestess suggests the heightening of the powers of intuition, and\nthe ability to tap into psychic, intuitive levels, to be able to use this\nintuition as a means of guidance. You have a deeper understanding about a\nparticular situation, without necessarily being able to justify where this\nsense or feeling comes from. You understand the importance of dreams, their\ninterpretation and the messages they bring. It also indicates the growth of a\nrelationship on a spiritual level. This card also represents opposites; the\nopposites of reality, where, perhaps there is a strong psychical attraction\nbetween two people and yet you know intuitively that this relationship will\nnot work, without knowing how or why you know this.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe High Priestess reversed warns that you have not, or choose not to listen\nto your inner voice for guidance. You are ignoring your intuitive guidance\nsystem, which could be telling you that unconscious factors are clouding or\ndistorting the relationship. There is a sense of awareness, suggesting that\nyou should consider seeking the help of a professional counsellor to help\nuncover issues hidden from your conscious mind.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nGuidance and knowledge from a deeper spiritual level guide and inspires you in\nthe development of your relationships. You have good judgement based on your\npsychic ability and you tend to trust your instinct, because it’s usually\nright. You often understand, or are aware of a psychic connection with another\nperson, without necessarily having spent much time with them. In the reversed\nposition, it suggests that some issues are hidden from your view, or that\nthere is a feeling of deception – that someone is not telling you the whole\ntruth.\n\n  \n\n# The Empress\n\n“Nurturing and caring comes naturally”\n\nThird card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nGrowth - Despair\n\nProsperity - Failure\n\nFertility - Lack of productivity\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Empress card suggests nurturing, caring, maternal feelings and fertility.\nThere is a strong sense of being at home with your inner-self, in touch with\nwhat is going on around and at peace with the world. The Empress evokes peace,\nharmony - a woman who is not only in control of her femininity, but who is\nalso wise and decisive. She is a person who is prepared to make sacrifices at\nher own cost for the benefit of others; one who inspires us to look at the\ngreater good, and take all things into consideration when making decisions.\nWhen this card is drawn in a male reading, it indicates that this man is very\nmuch in touch with the feminine side of his nature.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Empress reversed indicates difficulties in the home environment or\ndifficulties within a relationship. It can suggest infertility or an unwanted\npregnancy. There is a sense of domestic turmoil, or a lack of fulfilment. You\ncan also be overly protective of family and friends, and are sometimes accused\nof female dominance in a relationship.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nYou have very strong maternal feelings, with the desire to nurture and care\nfor someone special, often with thoughts about pregnancy and children. It does\nnecessarily not suggest that these feelings are being reciprocated, but the\nsurrounding cards will give indications as to how the other person feels. In\nthe reversed position it can indicate that you are not willing or capable of\ngiving the support that a relationship requires; that you are lacking a level\nof self-sacrifice necessary to make this particular relationship work.\n\n  \n\n# The Emperor\n\n“Do I need to control as I do?”\n\nFourth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nStability - Instability\n\nSelf-discipline - Lack of discipline\n\nAuthority - Heavy burden\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Emperor is a card of courage and ambition, established authority, and\nsuccess through a self-disciplined and practical approach. A male/father\nfigure, the Emperor holds little time for emotions, but see himself more as\nthe provider of material things. This person enjoys both working hard, and the\nrewards that hard work brings. When this card relates to an environment or\nsituation, it indicates stability and a time of structure. This card suggests\nsuccess in the material, male dominated world.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nLack of self-discipline brings lack of success and too much control in a\nsituation can stifle growth and limit movement and success. It can also\nindicate that this person wants to ensure that things are done his or her way,\nwhether it is the correct way or not; and sometimes without regard for the\nfact that his is not the only way. He is sometimes accused of narrow-\nmindedness, being a “macho” man.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThere is a desire to take charge of a relationship, to establish rules and\nregulations within that relationship. The Emperor is not prepared to take no\nfor an answer, and sometimes sees a relationship as a challenge in which\nwinning is the only goal. In the reversed position, it suggests that you are\nnot prepared to make any real effort to expand a relationship beyond its\npresent boundaries.\n\n  \n\n# The Hierophant\n\n“Guidance comes from above”\n\nFifth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nSpiritual guidance - Blind obedience\n\nHigher truth - Bad advice\n\nRealisation - Error of judgement\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Hierophant can represent the need to conform to rules or fixed situations.\nGuidance comes in a more spiritual way; there is nothing greater than the\ntruth. There may be a need to seek spiritual guidance from one that is\nrespected, or from a way of thinking that conforms to a specific framework or\nstructure. On another level depending on the surrounding cards, it can\nindicate one is being guided by a Spirit guide or higher guidance system, or\nconforming strongly to parental beliefs.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nIn reverse, the Hierophant can suggest an error of judgement. Rigid thinking\nleaves no room for growth. It can also represent the rejection of orthodox\nideas and the formation of new beliefs. You maybe following a particular path\nthat others would not agree with, and may even try and talk you out of.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Hierophant represents a conservative and rigid approach to a relationship,\nor a relationship that must conform and be acceptable to a social or religious\nstandard. It can be a union based more on stability than emotions. In the\nreversed position it indicates the resistance to conform or commit to a\nconventional style relationship, or the refusal to fall in with social or\nreligious standards imposed on a relationship.\n\n  \n\n# The Lovers\n\n“The most attractive option is not always the right one”\n\nSixth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nDecision - Indecision\n\nTemptation - Lust\n\nMoral choice - Corruption\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe card of the Lovers urges caution: the most attractive option may not\nalways be the best option to take. The Lovers shows a man torn between two\nwomen, a virgin and a temptress. It stands for tough choices, where moral\nvalues are questioned. To follow your own path you may have to go against\nthose who are urging you otherwise; or go against conventional wisdom which\nsuggests that your actions may be unexpected or unacceptable. It offers the\noption to develop a relationship beyond the relationship itself, with the\npossibility of higher goals and aspirations that two people can work together\ntowards.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nIn reverse the Lovers indicates the end of a partnership or friendship, or a\nsituation that is destructive. You may be fooling or deluding yourself about\nyour own motives, or the motives of others. You may be hampered by failing to\nsee further than your own goals or desires, though this could be due to a fear\nof changing or going against the established order.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship question, this card can mean the process of having to decide\nbetween having to make a commitment to the relationship, or leaving it to\nfollow a different direction. In the reversed position, it suggests taking\nadvantage of someone for the wrong reasons, possibly for sexual fulfilment or\nself-gratification, perhaps due to a lack of self-esteem. It can also indicate\nthat sexual issues are a dominant factor in your relationships.\n\n  \n\n# The Chariot\n\n“Take control and move forward with care”\n\nSeventh card of the Major Arcana.\n\nKey Words:\n\nControlling a situation - Loss of focus\n\nStrength of one’s conviction - Loss of confidence\n\nDedicated to a cause - Wrong use of energies\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Chariot represents challenge. There is a need to remain focused and keeps\nemotions in check. You may find yourself being pulled in two different\ndirections when having to deal with a particular issue. You always try to\novercome obstacles through perseverance and strength of will. You need to take\ncontrol, harness your energy and apply it wisely. That combined with your\nusual search for excellence means that success can be achieved.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThe loss of confidence or indecision in dealing with a situation can mean that\nyou are stuck in a rut, or unable to move things forward. Remember that a lack\nof concern for others undermines leadership. You are sometimes guilty of\nallowing outside influences to dominate or control a situation, or failing to\nrespond to the challenges that are being presented at the present time.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, it suggests that there is some element of\ncompetition, or that competitive interaction plays a part in the relationship.\nStimulating differences of opinions and attitudes keep a relationship\nconstantly stimulated. In the reversed position, it indicates that one partner\nmay be trying to control the relationship or one partner may fear being\ndominated by the other.\n\n  \n\n# The Strength\n\n“I must overcome my fears”\n\nThe Eighth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nCourage - Loss of courage\n\nStrength - Intimidation\n\nStamina - Manipulation\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe card of Strength suggests that it is not brute strength that is now\nrequired. In fact, love and compassion are now required to bring about a\nsolution to a situation. It does not mean that you do not have fears; it means\nthat you are now ready to face up to them. It’s time to tame the “all-\nconsuming lion” that lies within and is ready to consume you if you are\nprepared to let it.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nAt this level it represents an abuse of power, if in a position of power or\ncontrol. It also indicates a loss of courage, or that you are giving in to\nyour fears, which may be completely unfounded. You may be afraid to stand up\nfor your rights or for what is rightfully yours. It can also indicate that you\nare giving in to your animal drives and are now becoming territorial. There is\na suggestion of succumbing to lust, or sexual attraction, without thinking of\nthe possible consequences.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, it suggests that you now can overcome the fear of\nletting real love enter your life, and are at a stage where you can now make a\ncommitment. A current relationship seems to be based on understanding, with\nboth partners being able to overlook the others’ faults. In the reversed\nposition, it suggests that one person is prepared to use the vulnerabilities\nof the other person for his or her own means.\n\n  \n\n# The Hermit\n\n“The answer is within”\n\nThe Ninth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nReflection - Loneliness\n\nTruth - Fear\n\nGuidance - Sadness\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThis card represents spiritual wisdom in the form of guidance from a higher\nplane. Some would describe the guidance as coming from a Spirit Guide or\nAngel, depending on your point of view. This card indicates its now time for\nimportant reflection, a time when you need to step back and to look for the\nanswers or truths within yourself, and not keeping trying to find them outside\nof yourself. It can also indicate that it is time to seek the help of a\ncounsellor to help unlock your hidden self.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThe Hermit reversed foretells loneliness, sadness, and delay. You may have a\nsense of being stuck in a rut, or perhaps you need to face up to the fact that\nchange needs to take place. You sometimes have a fear of looking within, and\ncan find yourself constantly seeking others who may have ‘the answers’ for\nyou. On a physical level, you may be working in an environment where there is\nno social interaction, or where you somehow feel isolated or cut off from\nothers.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, the Hermit can signify that you need, even\ntemporarily, to retreat from the relationship to see what you want and where\nyou are going. You need to take time out to step back and examine your closest\nrelationships with clarity and honesty. The Hermit in the reversed position\ncan suggest that you maybe misreading or choosing to misread the feelings and\nintentions of the other person in the relationship.\n\n  \n\n# The Wheel of Fortune\n\n“Opportunities are now waiting”\n\nThe Tenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nChange - Stagnation\n\nGood fortune - Misfortune\n\nOpportunities - The unexpected\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nYou now have the ability to see the opportunities that are all around if you\nare prepared to stop for a moment to look for them. Life is in constant\nmotion, and while you may or may not like where you are at present, you know\nthat soon it will pass. This card indicates that your present circumstances do\nnot have to be as they are. You have the potential to instigate changes now if\nyou are prepared to do so. This card suggests the healing process.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune in the reversed position indicates that some bad luck is\nabout to come your way. If, however, positive cards surround it, you can rest\nassured that this will only be a temporary set-back. In a business layout, the\nWheel of Fortune warns of failure or loss of finances. You may need to cut\nyour losses, and focus your energies in a new or different direction, where\nyou will have a greater chance of success.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, the Wheel suggests that your present emotional or\nrelationship situation blend with your current needs or the needs of others.\nIt also warns that you should not take for granted your present situation. If\nyou are not in a relationship and desire to be in one, the opportunity can\ncome at any moment. The same applies if you are in a relationship you should\nnot take it for granted. Things often change outside of our control.\n\n  \n\n# Justice\n\n“I seek balance and harmony in all that I do”\n\nThe Eleventh card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nMental clarity - Dishonest Dealings\n\nBalance - Prejudice\n\nPeace of Mind - Complex legal issues\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe card of Justice indicates that you are reaching a state of balance. You\nare coming to a stage in your life or career where you can call on your\nability to be able to see both sides of a situation, and make decisions taking\ninto consideration all the issues involved. Justice also suggests a legal\ndecision in your favour. You realise that it’s now time to be absolutely\nhonest and take responsibility for your actions. In a partnership or business\nreading it suggests a stabile and calm environment in which both people\nunderstand each other, and together make up a very efficient and balanced\nteam.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nYou must now pay for your past actions. This could be in the form of a legal\nissue that drags on and will probably not give you the result you wish for.\nYou are involved in an unbalanced situation, where there is a huge swing of\neither mood or attitude. There is deep conflict, disagreement or suspicions\nwithin a relationship.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe card of Justice suggests a calm and balanced relationship, which is\ngenerally free from conflict and disagreement. It also indicate that there is\na level of understanding and acceptance of things as they are, rather that\nshowing any desire to stimulate change. There is a sense of contentment. You\nmay be moving on from a point where you moved from one relationship to another\njust for the sake of change. Instead, you are comfortable and calm about your\npresent state. In the reversed position it suggests disagreements, quarrelling\nand a lack of communication. The Justice in the reversed position also\nindicates that there could be legal action over possessions or property.\n\n  \n\n# The Hanged Man\n\n“Rest now and let everything find its own balance”\n\nThe Twelfth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nFlexibility - Inner struggle\n\nChange - Ridged\n\nMeditation - Disorder\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nYou know that to struggle now would serve no purpose. Be still, because now\nit’s time to reflect on your past actions. The ability to adapt to changing\ncircumstances can bring inner peace. It is time to focus on your needs rather\nthan the needs of others. The secret of the meaning of your life lies within\nthe self, and it’s only through communication with the unconscious and\nfeminine intuitive self, that you can find the answers to your questions and\nprobably a lot more.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nYou find yourself submitting to the wishes of others, or being guided by what\nother people think rather than doing what is right for yourself. The Hanged\nMan can suggest a refusal to accept the reality of a situation, with a\ntendency to self-martyrdom on behalf of a lost cause. It can also suggest a\ndesire to keep somebody in a partnership or situation for self-gain.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Hanged Man in a relationship symbolises the self-sacrifice that is\nsometimes required to make a relationship work, the ability to give and not\nalways expect to receive. It implies the understanding that we sometimes need\nto put the greater good of the relationship before our own personal fulfilment\nor goals. In the reversed position, it suggests that one partner may be\nrefusing to believe that a relationship is over, when the other person has\nmade quite clear that it is. Or perhaps creating situations that force a\nrelationship to continue, when it would be better to stand back and allow it\nto end naturally.\n\n  \n\n# Death\n\n“It is time to let go of the old and look forward”\n\nThirteenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words:\n\nChange - Loss of faith\n\nEnd of a cycle - Lack of direction\n\nFear of loss - Inability to move on\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Death card represents the end of an era or phase in your life. It does not\nindicate psychical death. The Death card tells you that the end of a cycle is\nnow taking place. It may be a relationship, the end of a career position or an\nemotional cycle. It is time to mourn your losses, be happy with your memories,\nand allow yourself to move forward in peace. Change is often a blessing in\ndisguise.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThe Death card in reverse warns that to resist change will bring stagnation.\nYou may be feeling stifled by guilt. This could relate the death of someone\nclose, the end of a relationship or a way of life. In some cases it can\nsuggest the inability to let go and move on to develop a new relationship.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading the Death card indicates the end of an element of a\nrelationship. If either the Tower or the Ten of Swords is in an influential\nposition in the layout, the Death card can indicate the total end of a\nrelationship. In the reversed position, the Death card suggests that a\nrelationship has become stagnant or that one or both partners are resisting\nchanges that may be necessary for the survival of the relationship.\n\n  \n\n# Temperance\n\n“Open all doors of communication on a deeper level”\n\nFourteenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nInteraction - Unstable interaction\n\nCombination - Conflict\n\nFlow of Feelings - Lack of communication\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThis card suggests a spiritual relationship, a feeling of kinship with\nanother, that of being soul mates. Careful control will bring success. The\ncard of Temperance indicates that there is a situation that requires deep\ncommunication to allow progress to continue. There is a need for communication\non a deeper emotional level in a relationship. You must be prepared not only\nto talk but also to listen.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nIn the reversed position, Temperance suggests that you are not listening to\nwhat is been said. Not only are you ignoring what others are saying, but you\nare also ignoring the messages coming from your own inner self. You have\nalready decided on a particular path, or are in the middle of deciding\nsomething quite important, without reference to others involved or their\nopinion.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, the card of Temperance symbolises the mysterious\nchemistry of the interaction between two people. It can often represent two\nvery different people with very different personalities and perspectives\ncoming together to create a unique dynamic relationship. This connection\nblends the individual elements into a workable formula.\n\n  \n\n# The Devil\n\n“I can untie the binds and set myself free”\n\nFifteenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nNegative control - Struggle for self-control\n\nSelf-gratification - Indecision\n\nVulnerability - Stagnation\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Devil in this position suggests that you are being manipulated by negative\nhidden influences. These influences may be a person who in some way controls\nyour life. Or it may be that you feel that, in some way, you are being\ncontrolled by your environment or even your own attitudes. You have a fear of\ntaking your power back, and being responsible for yourself or your situation.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThe Devil reversed indicates that you are not prepared to stay within a\ncontrolling situation. You are now seeking change both emotionally and\nphysically. You are aware that you need to break free from the binds of the\npast and present, even though this may be difficult and painful to do. You are\nnow strong enough to face the possible pain that this break will bring, and\nare willing to accept responsibility for your own life and circumstances.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nWithin a relationship situation, the Devil can suggest jealousy or obsessive\nbehaviour on the part of your partner. There may be an inner struggle or a\nsense of distortion that is controlling the relationship or situation. This\ncard can also suggest that sexual attraction is the main factor in a\nrelationship, and might in fact be the only factor binding the two people\ninvolved. In the reversed position, the Devil can suggest that you may be\nbehaving obsessively towards another person in a sexual way; or that you are\ntrying to control the other person’s feelings and thoughts through your\nbehaviour.\n\n  \n\n# The Tower\n\n“Change brings freedom”\n\nSixteenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nInevitable Change - Oppressive Lifestyle\n\nFreedom - Disappointment\n\nEnlightenment - Obstructing beneficial change\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Tower depicts inevitable change outside of your control. Your present\nlifestyle, your attitudes, or people in your environment are changing.\nSometimes your subconscious creates change in order to free you from\nrestrictions around you. In a health reading, it can indicate a sudden illness\nor shock that presents you with an opportunity to start a new way of life. Any\nmajor change can bring with it the possibility of freedom and liberation from\nnegative influences, people, places and environments.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nIn the reversed position, the Tower augers an incident which brings feelings\nof shame or scandal, or the sudden collapse of a relationship, business or the\nloss of a job. It suggests unnecessary suffering or a disaster that may have\nbeen avoided. It can also indicate the reluctance to deal with or release\nyourself from negative influences, attitudes, or a restrictive or controlling\nrelationship.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Tower warns that even the most structured relationship must continue to\ngrow and change. They cannot remain within rigid forms or boundaries. The\nTower suggests a relationship that is under pressure and beginning to show\nstrain in order to accommodate the changing needs of one or other of the\npeople involved. However, dealing with these changing will make the\nrelationship stronger. In the reversed position, the Tower still indicates\nchange, but this change is being resisted. Perhaps one of the partners is\nrefusing to address the new requirements of the relationship, instead choosing\nto cling to the old ways.\n\n  \n\n# The Star\n\n“Inspiration is my guiding light”\n\nSeventeenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nFaith - Rigid Mind\n\nRenewed Hope - Self Doubt\n\nQuiet confidence - Lack of Confidence\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nYou have inner faith and the belief that you are following the right path. The\nStar represents the belief and hope that things will continue to improve. It\nshows that you are in a position where you are now able to give of yourself,\n“letting the light out” while being open to receive, allowing a flow of love\nand light to come to you as well as radiate from you.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nIn reverse, the Star suggests self-doubt and lack of faith in your abilities.\nThere is a physical or psychological block that prevents you from moving\nforward. You are locked in by your inability to move beyond your present\nboundaries. You may be fearful of developing a relationship because of past\ndisappointments or because of a lack of faith in people in general. Keep\nyourself well grounded and don’t get carried away in fantasy.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Star in a relationship reading can suggest that you may have over-\nexpectations of the potential of a relationship. It may be that you are\ndepending too much on your partner to fulfil all of your expectations or\nwishes, instead of relying on your own powers and abilities. If you are not in\na relationship, it can indicate that you have total belief that you will find\na person with whom you can share your life and dreams. In the reversed\nposition, it can suggest that you have doubts about the ability of a\nparticular person or relationship to fulfil your expectations. It can also\nindicate a lack of belief in your own ability to develop and become a valid\npartner within a relationship, and this feeling is probably based on past\nexperiences.\n\n  \n\n# The Moon\n\n“I can accept my deeper feelings”\n\nEighteenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nIntuition - Loss of nerve\n\nPowerful Dreams - Lack of confidence\n\nSubconscious messages - Vulnerability\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Moon is the card of nurturing. It represents strong dreams and powerful\nintuitive messages reaching your conscious mind. Now is the right time to\ntrust your intuition, even if it is in conflict with your common sense or with\nwhat those around you say. Some things are hidden from conscious view and it\nis often necessary to look well below the surface in order to find clarity and\ntruth.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nIn the reversed position, The Moon indicates that everything may look all\nright on the surface, but there are many issues beneath the surface that need\nto be discussed and resolved. Uncertainty, fear and recurring feelings of\nnegativity prevent you from dealing with issues that need to be faced now.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nStrong dreams and fantasies are indicated when the Moon card appears in a\nrelationship spread. Although you would like your current relationship to\nfulfil all your dreams and fantasies, there is no real indication that this\nparticular partnership can do so. It could also suggest that even though you\nare in a relationship, you might be prone to dreaming or fantasising about\nsomebody else. In the reversed position, The Moon suggests that you may be\nsubject to very strong mood or emotional swings. This lack of control over\nyour emotions can create unfounded fears and obstacles where there are none.\n\n  \n\n# The Sun\n\n“Optimism is a powerful energy”\n\nNineteenth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nOptimism - Proactive Attitude\n\nSuccess - Careful caution\n\nTriumph - Stop Daydreaming\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe card of the Sun represents energy, enthusiasm, taking care of the inner\nchild and allowing spontaneity and openness to be an integral part of your\nlife. The most optimistic card of the whole deck, the Sun offers contentment,\nhappiness and inner peace.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nIn reverse, the Sun is still a positive card. Optimism is offered with this\ncard, but there are doubts and a fear of being so optimistic, probably based\non the experience of past failures. You may have a tendency no to take\nhappiness at face value, and you don’t always allow yourself to believe that\ncircumstances are as good as they seem. You sometimes expect them to be mere\nillusions, and your contentment is sometimes overshadowed by the fear that the\n‘good times’ can’t last.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship layout, the Sun depicts a spontaneous loving relationship\nthat has balance, harmony and the potential for a successful future. There is\na general feeling of trust and openness that is reciprocal. In the reversed\nposition, it indicates that you are suffering from a lack of faith, either in\nyour partner or the possible outcome of your relationship, when there is\nreally no need for doubt.\n\n  \n\n# Judgement\n\n“Freedom from bondage awakens my soul”\n\nTwentieth card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nGood judgement - Loss\n\nAchievement - Failure\n\nAccomplishment - Recrimination\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nYou need to take an honest unbiased look at where you are at present. Where\nyou are at now is a result of you past actions. It is time to realise that you\nare responsible for your own actions, thought outside forces over which you\nhave no control have and will impact on your life. A fair and honest appraisal\nwill help you clearly define what it is you wish to achieve in the future, and\nthe actions you must take if you are have chance of succeeding. By defining\nyour goals and aspirations, you will able to see the people, places and\nenvironment that will support you on your journey. It will then also help you\nsee the people, places and environments that will hold you back, or will be a\nnegative influence on your journey.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThere is a lack of clarity, and a feeling of uncertainty about your goals. You\nsometimes have a tendency to waste opportunities, a sense of not able to see\nthe wood from the trees. You sometimes end up putting off making decisions or\nhave a fear of making decisions; and this very indecision usually leads to\nloss and missed opportunities.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Judgement card suggests that you have come to a point where you are\nprepared to take an honest look at your relationship for what it is; a time of\nevaluation in which you confront issues that need to be honestly looked at.\nThere is an opportunity to establish a relationship on a new footing. In the\nreversed position, it suggests that the partners in the relationship are\nrefusing to accept responsibility for what the relationship has become; and\nthere is a sense of denial or lack of commitment.\n\n  \n\n# The World\n\n“I am co-creator of my world and all I wish for I can have”\n\nTwenty first card of the Major Arcana\n\nKey Words\n\nCompletion - Unfinished\n\nAccomplishment - Frustration\n\nRealisation - Struggle\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe World indicates the final and successful completion of any issue or issues\nin hand. It generally indicates that you have arrived at your destination; or\nhave reached the culmination of a long series of events. It may also suggest\ntravel in the physical sense, and always means great happiness and success.\nThe World can also suggest that there is a dawning realisation and\nunderstanding within of where you are at, for the first time in a long time.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nIn the reversed position, The World suggests that the wonderful opportunities\nthat are there are not been harnessed and are likely to be lost. You feel\nunable to complete a project or are struggling to find a purpose in a\nrelationship. There may be a sense of denial – you refuse to accept that a\nrelationship is already over.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, it suggests that this relationship has now come to\na point of completion and fulfilment. The relationship contains the potential\nand the dynamic energy that both people wish for. There is a positive end of a\ncycle.\n\n  \n\n# Part 4 – The Cards of the Minor Arcana - Wands\n\n# The Ace of Wands\n\nKey Words\n\nNew beginnings - Impotence\n\nDynamic energy - Blocked creativity\n\nInspiration - Over-confidence\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Ace of Wands suggests a new beginning, a creative dynamic energy, and a\nspark of inspiration, which allows you create a whole new plan for the future.\nThe focus is on the potential of new ideas that are forming. You realise that\nyou may have several options to consider, all of which look promising.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThe Ace reversed suggests there is a block in developing a new idea or a new\npartnership. While you may want to move things on, you cannot find the\ninspiration or guidance to do so. You understand the need to harness and\ncomplete a project before moving it on to the next stage, but may be having a\nproblem achieving this. There is a possibility that over- confidence may bring\nfailure.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, the Ace of Wands indicates the start of a new\nrelationship, the development of communication between two people, or a strong\npsychical and sexual attraction which has the potential to develop. In the\nreversed position, the Ace suggests there is a lack of energy, passion or\ndesire to develop a new relationship opportunity, caused by a lack of\nconfidence.\n\n  \n\n# The Two of Wands\n\nKey Words\n\nEnterprise - Avoidance of responsibility\n\nPlanning - Procrastination\n\nThe urge to move on - Pessimism\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Two of Wands indicates that you have come to a time of decision – you must\ndecide whether you want to build on what you have or perhaps expand in a new\ndirection. One part of you is content to stay in your present job/way of life\nand another part wants a change, a new direction and career challenges. It can\nalso suggest that you may be in the planning stages of developing a new\nbusiness. In an established business, the Two of Wands may suggest that you\nare looking at ways of expanding the current structure of your business or in\nthe process of developing a new direction.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nReversed, the Two of Wands suggests that you are afraid to move things on to\nthe next stage. You would rather stay in a negative or unhappy situation or\nrelationship, rather than force yourself to make decisions or changes. You\nshould stop trying to justify why you should stay were you are, and put all\nyour energy in taking on new challenges and opportunities, and seeing them\nthrough to their final conclusion.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Two of Wands suggests the development of a relationship that is based on\nphysical attraction. This can often be a spontaneous interaction between two\npeople, very much of the moment. It is often a relationship based purely on\npleasure and passion. In the reversed position, it represents a relationship\nthat is empty of love where one partner has control over the other; or perhaps\na relationship that is driven purely by sexual desire and pleasure, rather\nthan by mutual respect.\n\n  \n\n# The Three of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nConsolidation - Wasting talents and skills\n\nCo-operation - Delays\n\nThe first stages of making new ideas work - Set backs\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThis card shows a creative blending of energy. It represents the movement of\nideas from their initial conception of the Ace, the planning stage of the Two,\nto the point where action is now beginning to take place. It shows that there\nis co-operation from others, or that others are willing to help you make\nthings happen.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Three of Wands in reverse suggests that your efforts are being stifled. It\nis imperative that you pull back from your situation and review your plans\nobjectively. You must get more information and not move things forward until\nyou have established a more solid foundation.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Three of Wands suggests excitement and passion between two people who are\nprepared to activity pursue similar goals in the development of a\nrelationship. A relationship that needs excitement and challenge to keep it\nstimulated. In the reversed position it suggests a relationship in which there\nis a conflict of interest, disagreements and probably lack of direction. It\ncan also suggest a partnership that is plagued with setbacks – perhaps a\nfeeling that one of the partners is not being fulfilled by the relationship.\n\n  \n\n# The Four of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nRecognising a success - Restriction  \nMilestone or special times - Lack-of-freedom  \nAccomplishment - Oppressive situation\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Four of Wands often represents a stage where the first tangible successes\nare being achieved, and you are beginning to realise your ambitions. This is a\ntime of negotiation, dealing with others and standing your ground. Your plans\nare beginning to come together. Numerous developments are occurring which will\nhave a very good effect on your long-term plans. Now that the first stage has\nbeen achieved you can now celebrate and move on to take up the next challenge.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nIn the reversed position, the Four of Wands suggests a sense of apathy - no\nmatter how hard you strive for a particular goal or success you are unsure\nwhether or not you are going to succeed, and sometimes find yourself unable to\nmove forward. In a particular direction success seems to be delayed – as if\nthere is a blockage preventing you from moving on to the next step. It is time\nto look at your overall attitude, or your attitude to a particular situation,\na change of attitude may help things turn in your favour.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Four of Wands suggests two people who are in a relaxed relationship,\ncommitted to each other and are working towards the same goals. Positive\ninteraction between these two people secures a solid foundation for the\nfuture. In the reversed position, it indicates a relationship based on low\nexpectations and an acceptance of the limitations of the relationship. There\nis a sense of a lack of freedom or being in an oppressive situation.\n\n  \n\n# The Five of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nCompetition  - Aggression\n\nIrritations - Unnecessary arguments\n\nMisunderstandings - Need for confrontation\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThis card represents competition, opposition, being against the odds. This\ncompetitiveness may be in a relationship where two people live separate lives\nand have limited time together. There is a need to gather your thoughts and\nhave a look at your plans before proceeding forward again. You are struggling\nto succeed in a competitive environment. You must persist until you succeed.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nIn the reversed position, it suggests that you are more open to compromise and\ndiscussion. You have the ability to pull back from a disagreement and be more\nopen to discussion, rather that argue just for the sake of it. However,\ndepending on the surrounding cards it can indicate aggression. You may be\nfocusing competitive energy in the wrong direction, wasting your valuable time\nand skills in unnecessary friction.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Five of Wands indicates difficulties in relationship because the people\ninvolved are pursuing different goals. These conflicts can often occur because\none or both partners want to establish the relationship based on his or her\nown rules and regulations without regard for the other person. In the reversed\nposition, it suggests that you may be giving in to avoid confrontation and\ndisagreement – and are unwilling to stand up for yourself or your beliefs.\n\n  \n\n# The Six of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nRecognition - False Courage\n\nAchievement - Short-term Success\n\nTriumph - Delay\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Six of Wands indicates success, achievement. Problems are overcome. There\nmay be recognition for this success from a greater spectrum of people than\nexpected. This recognition may be in the public arena, and this level of\nrecognition does not surprise you. However, a part of you may be wishing that\nthis success were a little less superficial. It can also suggest that you are\nworking in an area, where public recognition is part of the job description,\nsuch as acting.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Six of Wands reversed suggests that you may be giving up too soon. You\nfeel overburdened and think that you have lost direction and focus. It can\nalso indicate that you may be spending too much time focusing on your\ncompetitors agenda and feeling threatened, rather that making your own more\nefficient.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Six of Wands shows a well-structured relationship. There is further\ncommitment to long term plans, possibly a decision to marry or establish a\nhome. This card suggests a relationship based on a mutual understanding of\neach other’s needs. In the reversed position, the Six shows a lack of\ncommitment. No matter what the potential of the relationship, there is a fear\nthat the other person will not continue to work toward the common goals of the\nrelationship.\n\n  \n\n# The Seven of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nBeing aggressive - Confusion\n\nStanding up for your rights - Uncertainty\n\nGoing after what you want - Lack of commitment\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThere are many issues to be dealt with at this time. You must have the courage\nand not give up now as you have the ability to succeed if you are prepared to\nkeep trying. Ensure that you consolidate your present position, so that you\nhave both the courage and strength to succeed. From your perspective you\nsometimes see obstacles, however, in reality they are challenges that you are\ncapable of taking on board.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Seven of Wands reversed suggests that your energies are low and you cannot\nmeet the challenges you now face. Be careful as you may be listening to the\nnegative opinions of others and taking then as your own. You are letting them\nerode your confidence, instead of listening to your own instincts and finding\nyour own way.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nYou are presently overcoming the difficulties that the Six of Wands presented.\nThere is a sense of two people joining together to work out disagreements or\ndifferences of opinions. Both are committed to and prepared to work at making\nthe relationship a success. In the reversed position, it suggests that one or\nboth of the partners are letting the relationship slide: that there is a lack\nof commitment to overcoming the difficulties.\n\n  \n\n# The Eight of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nProgress - Delays\n\nMovement - Problems\n\nSatisfactory Conclusion - Insecurity\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Eight of Wands indicates a feeling of positive dynamic energy, which\npropels you forward. You may have sudden success or promotion to a new\nposition that you desire in your career. It can suggest travel overseas. Goal\ndirected action will bring its own rewards.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Eight in the reversed position suggests delays, hold ups. You are not\nachieving the success you crave. It can also indicate that a relationship has\nnot developed the way you would have wished. In a business reading, it\nindicates a partnership that lacks commitment from one or all parties\ninvolved.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nIn a relationship reading, the Eight of Wands describes passion and excitement\nin a happy relationship where you can enjoy life together without the need to\nstruggle. It can also indicate you are planning an exciting holiday. This card\noften indicates a change of direction and environment.\n\n  \n\n# The Nine of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nPreparation - Opposition\n\nForesight - Confusion\n\nCautious Attitude - Avoidable Loss\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe Nine of Wands suggests that now is a time to hold back or wait to consider\nand balance up the odds. You need to be careful as you proceed forward, its\ntime to think carefully before making your next move. Lessons from the past\nwill give you insight into dealing with an upcoming situation or conflict. In\na relationship reading it suggests that you need to examine your commitment,\nbased on issues that have recently come to light. You must learn from your\npast mistakes.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Nine of swords in the reversed position indicates an inability to deal\nwith issues that need to be confronted. There is a possibility, or you feel\nthat there is a possibility that you will lose your job or find yourself\ncaught up in a situation you cannot find your way out of. You are very\nfrightened of things happening beyond your control; or that you will not adapt\nto changing circumstances.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Nine of wands in a relationship spread suggests that this relationship has\ncome up against some difficulties. However, these difficulties can be overcome\nif both partners are prepared to make a joint effort. In reversed position,\nthe partners in the relationship are unable to deal their present difficulties\nand it seems that there is no clear solution. In this position the Nine\nreversed can suggest that the people in this relationship are no longer as\ncompatible as they were; that one or both of them have changed or grown out of\nthe relationship.\n\n  \n\n# The Ten of Wands\n\nKey Words:\n\nTime to re-balance - Manipulation\n\nBurdened by responsibility - Unreliable\n\nOverburdened by success - Immature\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nSuccess does not necessarily bring happiness. It’s time to look at how you are\nmanaging your time and energies. You may be trying too many things at once,\nwhen you should be delegating some of your responsibilities to others. You\nfeel overburdened by the responsibility of being in charge. You feel\nresponsible for your current relationship difficulties and you feel that only\nyour actions can rectify the situation.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nThe Ten of Wands in the reversed position suggests that you may be misusing\nyour power to manipulate those around you. Bad decisions lead to bad results,\nand it is now time to understand how and where you have gone wrong and take\nsteps to rectify matters. You are learning the hard way that there are no easy\nways to success.\n\nRelationship Meaning:\n\nThe Ten of Wands suggests that both people in the relationship are prepared to\naccept the responsibilities of their relationship and are working together to\nmake it successful. In the reversed position it indicates that one partner is\nnot accepting reliability for their actions within or outside of the\nrelationship and the other partner is feeling very overburdened by the lack of\ntrustworthiness.\n\n  \n\n# Page of Wands\n\nAstrological key:  Any combination of Fire elements\n\nAstrological signs: Aries Leo Sagittarius\n\nKey Words:\n\nEnthusiasm - Immaturity\n\nDynamism - Bad temper\n\nAmbition - Fickleness\n\nUpright Meaning:\n\nThe card of the Page of Wands represents an enthusiastic young person who is\ndynamic and creative. A person, who enjoys living for the moment, loves\nchallenge and is often the bearer of good news. It’s time to use your\ncreativity and start in a new direction, no matter what your age. Leave things\nto chance once in a while. Once you don’t take too many risks, everything\nshould be okay. In a career reading it can indicate the offer of a job or a\nnew opportunity to do with business.\n\nReversed Meaning:\n\nIn reverse, this card suggests someone who has sudden outbursts of bad temper,\nwhen they cannot get their own way. There is a sense of someone who has an\nimmature attitude. You may suffer from an inability to start new things or it\ncould be that you lack the enthusiasm and energy to follow things through. It\ncan suggest a passionate relationship that will soon burn itself out.\n\nIn a Relationship:\n\nThe Page of Wands is impulsive and passionate.

She sometimes\nlives in a world of romance and fantasy.

This\nperson moves forward carefully, considering each move he has to make.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThis King in the reversed position represents a man who is weak willed and\nwants to dominate relationships. Because of his lack of self-esteem, he may be\ninvolved in a number of relationships, constantly seeking assurance and\nacceptance from others, instead of seeking self-knowledge within. He is\nsometimes tortured by the pain of the failure of past relationships or from\nhis childhood.\n\nIn a Relationship:\n\nGenerous and attentive, the King of Cups feels happiest in a relationship when\nhe can be the benefactor and provide security.

Because she is loyal and trusting, she\nwill give you many opportunities to prove yourself, but if you do anything to\nlose that trust, you will probably never gain it again.\n\nReverse Meaning:\n\nThe Queen in reverse indicates a woman who is greedy for money and power. She\nlacks self-confidence, and is out of touch with what is going on in her\nenvironment and needs to become more grounded. She sometimes lacks the ability\nto work for what she wants.\n\nIn a Relationship:\n\nThe Queen of Pentacles fits comfortably into the relationship of her choice.\nShe is flexible and responds well to a partner who shares her sensible\napproach to life. She is cautious with money and an excellent businesswoman.\nUnder pressure she keeps herself well-grounded and level headed. She is loyal\nand generally emotionally well balanced. This card in the reversed position\nsuggests a woman who is too cautious and has an obsession with financial\nsecurity.\n\n  \n\n# The King of Pentacles\n\n  \nAstrological Sign:  Capricorn\n\nAstrological Influence:\n\nRuled by Saturn, the taskmaster. It is a negative, cardinal earth sign,\nsometimes frugal. Often contained, cautious, efficient and sensible.\n\n  \nKey Words:\n\nIntelligent - Corruption  \nSkilful - Dishonourable behaviour\n\nPatience - Dishonest businessperson\n\n  \nUpright Meaning:  \nThis card represents an individual who combines knowledge and practicality to\nachieve his objectives. He is a builder and manager, a person who has achieved\nsuccess through practical effort. The King is intelligent and enjoys earning\nmoney. Material wealth is important, yet he is caring and a good friend.\nHappiness for him is a comfortable lifestyle and possessions. He finds\nopportunity everywhere and succeeds in achieving anything he sets his mind\ntoo. Dependable and responsible, once he makes a commitment he will not let\npeople down. The King of Pentacles is sometimes seen as the banker.\n\n  \nReverse Meaning:  \nThe King reversed suggests someone who may take risks with money without\nweighing up the consequences. He tends to be inconsistent in his approach to\ndealing with money and may be dishonest. In a relationship reading, it can\nindicate a person who sees his partner as a possession rather than a person.\n\nIn a Relationship:\n\nThe King of Pentacles can be kind and generous. He looks to his relationship\nfor the warmth and fulfilment that is lacking in his daily business life. He\nis practical and cautious with money, generous with his time and advice, which\nwill be well founded and good to follow. The King of Pentacles will marry for\nsecurity and seldom make huge emotional demands on his partner. In reverse,\nhowever he tends to be frugal and mean with his own money, but free with\nyours.\n\n  \n\n# Part 7 - The Astrological influence of the Court Cards\n\nThis chapter looks at the influence of the astrological sun signs and the\nCourt Cards.\n\nThe four astrological elements of Fire, Earth, Water and Air relate very much\nto the four elements of the suits of the Tarot: Wands - Fire, Pentacles -\nEarth, Cups - Water and Swords - Air.\n\nThe Cards of the Page do not relate to a specific sun sign, they represent the\ninfluence of the element of the specific suit e.g. Page of Wands has the\ninfluence and qualities of the Fire signs in general. Another influence that\nhas to be taken into account is that represented by the Three Qualities or\nbasic principles of life: Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable.\n\nThe Cardinal Signs represent dynamic energy, creative ability and power. Hence\nwe associate the Kings with the Cardinal signs of Aries, Capricorn, Cancer and\nLibra.\n\nThe Fixed Signs represent stability, receptivity and containment. So we\nassociate the cards of the Knights with the fixed signs of Leo, Taurus,\nScorpio and Aquarius.\n\nThe Mutable Signs represent flexibility, adaptability and volatility,\nassociated with Queen cards of Sagittarius, Virgo, Pisces and Gemini.\n\nWhen reading a Court card try to identify if the card represents the querent,\na particular aspect of the querents personality or an attitude that will\ninfluence the querent in a positive or negative way. If it represents another\nperson, look carefully at the position in which it is placed, and then compare\nit with the surrounding cards. For example if the King of Swords is in the\nhopes and fears position, this may be an indication that the querent may fear\nthe influence of the person represented by the King of Swords.\n\nThe Court cards play an important part in a Tarot reading, because apart from\npersonal significance, they help identify people who have or will play an\nimportant part in the querent’s life or question. The influence of this person\nmay be positive or negative depending on the position of the Court card and\nthe other cards surrounding it. By including the astrological sign associated\nwith the card, we are open to a lot more information that can help us identify\nor be on the lookout for a particular person.\n\nPage of Wands - Fire sign influences\n\nPage of Cups - Water sign influences\n\nPage of Swords - Air sign influences\n\nPage of Pentacles - Earth sign influences\n\nKnight of Wands - Sagittarius - Mutable\n\nKnight of Cups - Pisces - Mutable\n\nKnight of Swords - Gemini - Mutable\n\nKnight of Pentacles - Virgo - Mutable\n\nQueen of Wands - Leo - Fixed\n\nQueen of Cups - Scorpio - Fixed\n\nQueen of Swords - Aquarius - Fixed\n\nQueen of Pentacles - Taurus - Fixed\n\nKing of Wands - Aries - Cardinal\n\nKing of Cups - Cancer - Cardinal\n\nKing of Swords - Libra - Cardinal\n\nKing of Pentacles - Capricorn - Cardinal\n\n  \n\n# Part 8 - What is a Tarot Reading / Layout / Spread?\n\nA Tarot spread/layout is a visual map that offers insights into personal\ncontribution, personal motives, conscious, sub-conscious and psychological\ninfluences of a particular situation or question. It is like taking a picture\nof a particular situation. When you take a little time to study the picture\nand peel away the different layers, you find that it gives you a multi-\ndimensional view, and many different perspectives. A layout in the hands of a\ncompetent reader can reveal an amazing amount of information. Much to the\nsurprise of the querent, a good reading will give information that even he or\nshe may not be consciously aware of.\n\nThe motivation of the querent plays an important part in obtaining a\nsuccessful outcome to a reading. You will find that there are as many\ndifferent reasons for readings as there are people. Some will come out of\ncuriosity, some for the fun of it, and others will come with specific\nquestions. Care must be taken that you do not let the querent take control of\nthe reading and then guide you to give them the answer they want. A reading\ncan be complex and cryptic in its guidance, and may take the querent some time\nto work through the massage given. Because of the nature of a Tarot reading,\nthere is a general misconception that you are there to give answers, but this\nis not the case. You must take great care that you don’t fall into the trap of\nbeing seen as the person who gives the answers.\n\nThe Layouts\n\nI have a preference for the Celtic Cross Layout. As you might expect,\ndifferent readers or teachers of Tarot often give different interpretations\nfor the meaning of each position. In the beginning when you start reading\nTarot, you should go with the meanings I give below. Then, when you have been\nreading for a while, if you intuitively feel that the meanings of the\npositions I give are different to the meaning I have given you, change to your\nown definition. As I said before, you must always trust your intuitive\nguidance.\n\nPreparation before a reading:\n\nIt is only natural that you will feel nervous when you start to do reading for\nsomeone else, particularly if it is for someone you don’t know. That is why\nyou should try to develop a system that helps you prepare for a reading. Your\nenvironment is very important - try to use a quiet room with relaxing\nbackground music, candles and low light. This always helps create the right\natmosphere. Buy or make a special tablecloth or piece of material to cover\nyour table, and only use this cloth when doing readings.\n\nFrom the moment you start to set up your room and prepare your space, you will\nautomatically begin to prepare mentally. I like to burn relaxing aromatherapy\noil, and clear the room of any negative energies by walking around the room\nwith a burning incense stick. Shuffle the cards yourself and take a little\ntime to reflect on some of the illustrations. And last but not least - relax.\n\nDoing a reading with the Celtic Cross Layout:\n\nThe Celtic Cross is probably the most popular layout used world-wide, though\nthere are many variations of interpretation of the different positions in this\nlayout. The version I give below is the one I have used for years.\n\nAsk the querent to shuffle the cards. Let the querent decide how long they\nshuffle for, as it is not important how they shuffle the cards but that they\nmake a solid contact with the cards. Fan the cards out in a semi-circle face\ndown.\n\nNow ask the querent to choose one card. This card is the Significator; put\nthis card to one side facing down. (This card will be placed in position 1 in\nthe layout plan).\n\nAsk the querent to choose nine more cards, placing them one on top of the\nother, facing down (these cards will be placed in turn in the positions 2-10).\n\nTurning the Significator face up and lay it in position 1. Then lay out the\nother cards in positions 2 to 10 as they were chosen.\n\nTake as much time as you need to study the cards in their positions, and how\nthey relate to each other.\n\nLet your intuition guide you. After a little while, a picture will start to\ndevelop in your mind. Don’t be afraid to trust your feelings. A good technique\nfor beginners is to start with the Significator and describe to the querent\nthe attributes of this card. And so on with each of the cards in turn. Also\ndescribe what you feel the significance is of the position of the card. Now\nyou are well on your way to completing a successful reading.\n\nYour role is to give a clear and honest interpretation NOT to make decisions\nfor the querent. The querent must be allowed do this for him or herself. A\nsuccessful reading is one that gives the querent a different perspective of an\nissue or situation. It should reveal or clarify opportunities, negative\ninfluences, sub-conscious blocks such as negative past experiences, or\nemotional pain from the past. It may also highlight the influences of another\nperson, people, or circumstances that are outside the querents control.\n\n# The Celtic Cross Layout\n\n![](../Images/image00172.jpeg)\n\n#\n\nPosition 1. The Significator\n\nPosition 2 The Covering Card\n\nThis card indicates the main positive forces in the querents favour. If this\ncard is a negative card, it indicates obstacles that hinder progress.\n\nPosition 3 The Base Card\n\nThis card indicates the general demeanour or experience of the querent and can\nindicate where the querent is at present. It highlights the underlying\ninfluences and emotional undercurrents in the querents life.\n\nPosition 4 The Crown\n\nThis card indicates the influences that affect the thought process. This card\ncan be viewed as messages from the “higher self”.\n\nPosition 5 The Past Influence\n\nThis card indicates the past issues or events that colour or influence the\nquerents present position.\n\nPosition 6 The Challenge/ Obstacle\n\nThis card indicates the main obstacles or challenges the querent has to\novercome on order to reach his or her goal.\n\nPosition 7 Psychological Influence\n\nThis position indicates the querents psychological state and attitude to the\npresent situation, which can affect the outcome of the matter.\n\nPosition 8 Present Environment\n\nThe card in this position represents the querents present environment or\nunforeseen issues that may affect the outcome of the matter.\n\nPosition 9 Hopes and Fears\n\nThis position indicates the hopes and fears of the querent.\n\nPosition 10  Summation/ Outcome\n\nThis is the position that represents the summation or outcome of the matter.\n\n  \n\n# Sample Celtic Cross Reading\n\nJohn came to me for a reading. He had a number of questions he wanted to ask.\nBefore letting John ask his questions, I decided to do a Celtic Cross layout.\nFrom a personal point of view, I prefer to do this layout before letting the\nclient ask any questions. This layout gives a good overview of what is\nhappening in John’s life at present. It also presents an insight into what is\ngoing on beneath the surface and helps open the psychic side of your nature,\nin this case allowing me gain that intuitive sense of what is happening in\nJohn’s life.\n\n1. Two of Swords: The Significator (Where you are at, at present)\n\nThe first card that John chooses is the Two of Swords, indicating that at the\ntime of the reading, John has an important decision or decisions to make. The\nTwo of Swords also shows that John feels uncertain and unsure of which\ndirection to take. I don’t know why he feels like this, until I see the other\ncards in the layout.\n\n2. Moon: (What influences you at present)\n\nThe Moon represents emotions that sometimes get blown out of proportion.\nDepending how they are handled, these emotions will have a major influence on\nthe outcome. Sub-conscious fears presented in the Moon have to be faced alone,\nand dreams may be heightened during this time, as the sub-conscious tries to\nmake you aware of influences hidden from the view in the conscious world.\n\n3. Three of Wands (Base of the matter)\n\nThe Three of Wands indicates it’s a time for John to consolidate his position,\na time to prepare to put his next set of plans into action. It’s time for John\nto look at his present situation, and bring together everything and everybody\nin his environment that is positive and use them to create a new future.\n\n4. Queen of Pentacles (Crown or head position)\n\nThe Queen of Pentacles in the Crown position shows us that John is thinking\nabout a woman. She is an earthy person and feels at home particularly in the\ncountryside. She will work hard to achieve her goals, can inspire and help\nthose around her and usually has good business sense.\n\n5. Ace of Pentacles (Major influence)\n\nThe Ace of Pentacles represents new beginnings, a new idea that inspires a new\nperspective. It tells us that there are new ideas coming to the surface in\nJohn’s mind. Aces represent new beginnings, a spark of inspiration that\ncreates a whole new plan for the future. In this position the Ace shows us\nthat John has new plans in his mind, a new perspective, these plans will\neffect his work and love life and if handled correctly will bring about a\npositive outcome.\n\n6. Five of Wands (Challenge position)\n\nThe challenge position highlights what John see as the issues or obstacles in\nhis present environment. The Five of Wands represents conflict, although this\nconflict is not serious enough to harm anyone. In this position, it tells us\nthat John has been resisting the idea of attempting to resolve the issues that\nhave to be sorted out one way or the other. This card in this position also\ntells us that John is well capable of facing up to the challenges of the\npresent moment and bringing about a successful outcome.\n\n7. The Sun (Psychological position)\n\nThe card of the Sun in the psychological position shows that it is time to\ntake on board a more optimistic attitude. It is a time to know the value\nfriendship in a relationship, and the potential of opportunities there to be\ntaken in the present moment. The Sun draws on the inner strength found in the\ncard of Strength, and the ability to surrender to the change indicated in the\nDeath card.\n\n8. Eight of Pentacles (Environment)\n\nThis card suggests a deeper commitment to a person or situation. In John’s\ncase it embraces both. It also is the card of learning new skills, the need\nand the ability to bring all the ingredients that are available in the present\ntime to create something new.\n\n9. Ten of Cups (Hopes and fears position)\n\nThis position has two very distinct sides to it, the positive and the\nnegative. Both are embraced in the one position. On the positive side, the Ten\nof Cups shown us that John wishes for a fulfilment in a relationship. On the\nother side, however, he also has the fear that if he commits himself it may\nnot work.\n\n10. Ten of Pentacles (Outcome)\n\nThe Ten of Pentacles depicts an excellent outcome for John. This card shows a\nsolid foundation and structure in his future life, financial security and a\nrelationship environment in balance and harmony. It also shows a relationship\nlinked to career, a dynamic combination that brings success in a relationship\nand business.\n\nJohn is thirty-one, self-employed and has worked for himself since he was\ntwenty. His business is successful, but not fulfilling for him anymore. John\nfeels that he has been stuck in a rut for some time. He has been in a\nrelationship with Elaine for the last two years and they love each other very\nmuch. John feels that recently Elaine has been making overtures about taking\ntheir relationship to the next stage.\n\nJohn would like to do that, but has had a fear of making a total commitment to\nthe relationship. In the recent past, new ideas for developing his business\nhave come to mind, and in discussing these ideas with Elaine, she surprised\nhim with her business acumen. John now wonders if it would be a good idea not\nonly to propose to Elaine, but also to invite her to join the business.\n\nLooking back over John’s layout, we can see clearly that the Two of Swords\nshows John uncertainty, covered by the Card of the Moon indicating a strong\nflow of emotions. The Ace and the Queen of Pentacles shows the positive\ninfluence of John’s new ideas, backed by Elaine’s clear and positive ability\nto see John’s situation from a different perspective. We also see that if John\nis prepared to follow his natural instincts, both he and Elaine have an\nexcellent future to look forward too.\n\n  \n\nKeeping Records\n\nIt will be well worth your while keeping records of your readings, both\npractice and actual ones. Try to enlist as many friends as possible to\nparticipate in your trials. You will need people who will come to you for a\nnumber of readings over a period of time. You will need people who will be\nopen and honest with you, and who will give you feed back as to how accurate\nyour reading are. I have kept records for many years now and find it very\nhelpful, most times I keep the name in code to ensure confidentiality An\nexample of my records would be as follows:\n\nName: Stephen\n\nPlace: Home\n\nUsed background music, candles, low lights\n\nType of Layout: Celtic Cross\n\nList of the cards:\n\nSignificator. Four of Wands.\n\nPosition: 2. Temperance.\n\nPosition 3. Knight of Cups.\n\nPosition 4. Four of Swords.\n\nPosition 5. Two of Cups.\n\nPosition 6. Ace of Wands.\n\nPosition 7. Ace of Cups.\n\nPosition 8. Queen of Pentacles.\n\nPosition 9. Ten of Pentacles.\n\nPosition 10. Six of Swords.\n\nInterpretation: The reading focused on two areas, The first suggestion is that\nthere was a career opportunity coming soon. Stephen was surprised by this\nobservation and said that he is happy in his present position and had not\napplied for any other positions within or outside his present company. He also\nsaid that he is not aware of any opportunities in his present company at the\nmoment.\n\nThe second suggested that Stephen would like to take his relationship with\nChantal to the next stage and make a greater commitment. Stephen agreed with\nthis interpretation, but he is uncertain about how Chantal feels. The Queen of\nPentacles drawn in the environment position, suggests to me that Chantal is\nmore settled in her relationship with Stephen than he realises, and that she\nin turn is probably being just as cautious as Stephen is being.\n\nFeed back: Shortly after his reading, Stephen found the courage to have a\nserious chat with Chantal, much to Stephen’s surprise Chantal agreed with\nStephen that they should make a more serious commitment. She said that she did\nnot want Stephen to feel pressurised within their relationship and wanted to\nfind out for himself how he felt and where he wanted the relationship to go.\nThey have recently decided to move into their own apartment. Two weeks ago\nStephen’s supervisor gave notice that he was offered a position with a\ndifferent company and Stephen has applied for the position of supervisor.\n\nThis is not the end of the book, just the beginning of your journey. Like the\nFool as he starts on his new journey, look forward with an open and optimistic\nattitude, embrace the Magician, listen to the High Priestess, and you will\nseldom go wrong\n\n",

Surely I have learned as much from teaching them as they have\nlearned from me. Those teaching experiences informed and enriched the material\nin Section 2: Preludes .\n\nFinally, I am eternally grateful to the innumerable Tarot friends and experts\nwho have contributed so much to my love, appreciation, and understanding of\nthe Tarot.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n#  Section 1:  \nIntroduction\n\n  \n\n“Ask KnightHawk” is an ongoing column featuring advice to characters you\nprobably recognize. These are actual readings. Only the questions themselves\nare made up.\n\nThe above quote introduced my first “Ask KnightHawk” column in an issue of the\nonline ATA (American Tarot Association) newsletter in October 1999.\nPreviously, I had been kicking around the idea of writing an ongoing Tarot\nadvice column, sort of like Dear Abby using Tarot readings, and I had just\nfinished writing an article about using Tarot readings to create fictional\ncharacters and stories. These factors stewed in my mind for a while until they\nfinally gelled, and I was struck with a flash of inspiration: Why not do\nthree-card readings to give advice to well-established fictional characters?\nWouldn’t a column based on that concept be both entertaining and educational?\n\nI realized there would be a whimsical aspect to the column—after all, would\nDr. Jekyll really consult a Tarot reader for advice on how to deal with the\ndespicable Mr. Hyde? —but I hoped it also would provide some insights into the\nmeanings of the cards, the use of simple spreads, and the art of doing Tarot\nreadings. And this aspect of putting it all together is generally neglected in\nthe existing Tarot literature.\n\nWhen I first started studying Tarot, I enjoyed reading the transcripts of\nactual Tarot readings in books, even if they were for people whose lives and\nproblems I knew nothing about. But I found them far too rarely, and they left\nmany of my questions unanswered. When you are doing a reading, how do you\nchoose the “right” meaning from the spectrum of meanings that you’ve learned\nfor each card? How does the question for the reading affect how you interpret\nthe individual card meanings? How does the card’s position in the spread\naffect how you read it? How do cards influence each other’s meanings in a\nreading? How does the reader build up a coherent “story” and message for the\nreading from the individual card meanings? These questions always begged for\nmore sample readings, which my column would provide.\n\nThe next consideration was how to handle the logistics of the column. I\nquickly decided that the format of a three-card reading seemed perfect. Three-\ncard spreads can illustrate positional interpretations and the way that cards\ninfluence each other in a reading, but they do not overwhelm the novice reader\nwith too much detail. This concern was important because the venues for these\ncolumns were ill suited to long, involved discourses. In addition, this\nprovided the supplemental benefit of illustrating the power of the oft-\noverlooked three-card spread, which works well for short readings.\n\nNext, I wondered for whom I should do these readings. I began by using famous\ncharacters from literature and quickly expanded my scope to include figures\nfrom mythology and folklore as well. Then a friend suggested I use historical\nfigures too, and I was off and running.\n\nAs soon as my column began appearing, suggestions poured in for readings,\noften for people currently in the news. (Numerous people suggested I do a\nreading for the Bill Clinton / Monica Lewinsky affair , which was in the\npublic eye at that time.) However, I did not want to do readings for living\npeople, both for the ethics of respecting their privacy and for the desire to\navoid any possibility of libel litigation. Besides, I figured that between\nclassic literature, mythology, and history, I had more than enough material\nwith which to work.\n\nHow to do these readings was almost a foregone conclusion as I started this\nendeavor. A lthough I suppose I could have faked the readings—deliberately\nselecting which cards would work best in the reading—I never seriously\nentertained that possibility. Instead, each of the readings was performed as\nthough I was doing it for someone sitting across the table from me. I\nconsidered the question, shuffled and cut the deck, and dealt three cards in\nthe layout I had chosen. Then I read the cards as they lay.\n\nSometimes the message came through loud and clear. At other times it took some\nwork to make sense of the reading, and I admit that once or twice I was\ntempted to scoop up the cards and re-deal them. I never did that though. I\nalways trusted the Tarot to speak to me, even if it spoke softly and in\nseeming riddles, and I was never disappointed. I always was able to find\nmeaning in these readings, to varying degrees of success.\n\nThe format of the column was my last consideration, and I decided to head each\ninstallment with a mock newspaper headline, both to attract my audience’s\nattention, and to keep the tone light. I wanted to make it clear that I was\nnot taking myself too seriously with these columns, although I do take Tarot\nitself seriously.\n\nMy initial idea for a KnightHawk book was merely to collect edited versions of\nsome of the best “Ask KnightHawk” readings into one book. Then I decided it\nwould be valuable to provide explanations and discussions of them as well and\nto include some information for beginning Tarot readers, such as supplemental\nchapters on a range of topics concerning the art of Tarot reading. I also felt\nthat it was necessary to discuss the meanings of the seventy-eight cards in a\nbook targeted mainly at beginning Tarot readers. Hence, the appendix includes\nmy thoughts on each of the cards.\n\nAnd so I created my first book, KnightHawk’s Tarot Readings , which is now out\nof print. The next edition of this book, which greatly expanded upon KHTR ,\nwas published by Llewellyn in 2003 and it was titled Tarot Tells the Tale .\nLlewellyn let that book go out of print in 2010, and so in 2011 I regained the\nrights to it and decided to publish a new edition. So here now is the third\niteration of this book.\n\nT he heart of this book remains the “Ask KnightHawk” readings themselves—from\nthe many three-card readings to the much more detailed Celtic Cross\nreading—and I hope they help you learn how to do Tarot readings. One\nsuggestion about using the readings in this book is to first just read the\nquestion along with the cards dealt for it, and try to do your own\ninterpretation of the reading prior to reading mine. Many readers of the prior\niterations of this book have told me that they find this exercise to be very\neducational. In any case, I trust that you will be entertained in the process\nof using this book, for the most valuable learning experiences are the ones we\nenjoy.\n\n  \n\n#  Section 2 :  \nPreludes\n\n  \n\nBefore presenting the various Tarot readings that are the heart of this book,\nthis section will explain the art of reading Tarot cards.\n\nThe chapters that follow discuss ways of discovering your own understanding of\neach of the cards, including suggested methods for dealing with the difficult\ntopics of Court Cards and reversed cards. There is a chapter on how to phrase\nthe question for a reading most effectively and one that presents an overview\nof three-card spreads, which are the basis of all but one of the readings in\nthis book. One chapter shows how to pull all of this information together to\ncreate a meaningful Tarot reading, and the final chapter covers ethical\nconsiderations of doing Tarot readings.\n\nThis material is aimed at preparing the novice Tarot reader for working with\nthe cards, but hopefully everyone, from beginner to adept, will find some\ninsights here. If, however, you already feel adept at doing Tarot readings,\nfeel free to skip ahead to section 3, Sample Three-card Readings , and feel\nfree to just use the material in this section as a resource to which you may\nrefer whenever necessary.\n\n  \n\nChapter 1\n\n##  Associations : Numbers and Elements\n\nA basic feature of Tarot cards is that each one is defined by its number and\nsuit. For example, the Ten of Cups is both a Ten and a Cups card. In addition,\neach suit can be associated with one of the classic elements: earth, air,\nwater, and fire, while the Major Arcana cards are related to the\nquintessential fifth element, Spirit. Thus, an examination of a card’s\nnumerological and elemental associations is a powerful way to explore its\nmeaning more deeply. In support of such a quest for understanding, this\nchapter will discuss various meanings for numbers and elements, and it will\nshow how to apply such interpretations to an understanding of the seventy-\neight Tarot cards.\n\n###  Numerological Associations\n\nThe following reflects my understanding and interpretation of numerological\nmeanings. There are many schools of thought about this, however, so take from\nit what you will.\n\nOne is the number we start with when we count, and so it represents\nbeginnings, the start of something new, and a seed taking root. It also\nindicates unity, as in the phrase, “all for one, and one for all.” But one is\nthe proverbial loneliest number, so it also stands for the self and the ego.\n\nTwo represents duality, such as hot and cold, in and out, above and below, pro\nand con. As a result of such dualities, we have a choice, so the number two is\nabout decisions as well. Two teams or armies can come into conflict, which\nimplies the meaning of conflict, but as we can see when we visualize a scale,\ntwo can represent balance as well. Thus, it may signify the resolution of\nconflict.\n\nWhen two things are joined together, their union creates something new, a\nthird entity. For example, two people may come together to form a relationship\nor a partnership, or even a child in a sexual union. Similarly, when we mix\ntwo colors we get a new color. Consequently, three represents creation,\nintegration, and reproduction. If we integrate our intention with action, we\nmake progress, which implies that this number also can be about growth and\nexpansion.\n\nWhen we think about what we have four of, the following examples come to mind:\ndirections on a map, seasons, walls of a typical room, and legs on a table or\nchair. This implies that four is the number of structure, stability, and\nboundaries. Since these qualities also allow us to rest and to secure the\ngrowth indicated by the number three, four can relate to rest, recuperation,\nand consolidation as well.\n\nAn inherent risk in the structure and stability symbolized by the number four\nis getting hide-bound, stodgy, or stuck in a rut. Thus, five represents the\nchange and conflict that can disrupt that complacency or that is necessary in\norder to grow beyond it. As a result, this number is about crisis, strife, and\nstruggle, especially when we consider that it is also the number that\nrepresents humanity, in that we have five-fingered hands, five senses, and\nfive extremities (one head, two arms, and two legs). Indeed, our lives are\ndefined by the challenges we face and by how we overcome them or succumb to\nthem, as the case may be. The number five therefore represents the learning\nopportunities inherent in difficult experiences. Also, since the fifth element\nis that of spirit, five is also the number associated with our soul. (Consider\nthat the Major Arcana card with this number is the Hierophant, or High\nPriest.) Consequently, this number represents the soulful work that is\npossible through our physical manifestation.\n\nAfter the disruption represented by the number five, a new balance is needed.\nThus, six indicates the choices we make as we search for such a readjustment.\nThese choices are not of the simple “this or that” type indicated by the\nnumber two, however. Rather, they are the difficult ones necessary to resolve\nthe strife of the number five. And the readjustments we thus make are often\nthe result of establishing reciprocal relationships with our environment or\nwith the people around us. We also gain a sense of appreciation, peace, and\nharmony when that new equilibrium has been struck.\n\nHowever, despite this new-found harmony, the number six is still far from the\ncompletion of the numerical sequence. The eternal ebb and flow of life shows\nup next in the tests that challenge us to prove what we have learned through\nthe chaos represented by the number five and the effort to resolve and\nrebalance that chaos, as seen in the number six. While the challenges of the\nnumber five may be called the homework assignments of life, the number seven\nrepresents life’s final exams, the tests wherein we either prove our level of\nmastery—and thereby attain victory—or we are forced to reassess how far we\nhave come, where we are, and how far we have yet to go.\n\nThe number eight follows these tests and challenges, and so it is concerned\nwith regeneration, progress, and moving on with our lives. Another path to\nunderstanding this number comes from considering how the pace of a movie\ngenerally accelerates dramatically as the climax approaches. Eight, which is\nthe second to last single-digit number, represents the acceleration that leads\nup to a finale as everything starts falling into place. Hence, this number is\nabout movement, strength, and power—or the need for those things.\n\nNine , the final single digit number, represents the end of a cycle and the\ncompletion of a task or project, for better or for worse. It is the climax,\nthe finale. The frenzied activity of the number eight has led to the\naccomplishments and consequences symbolized by nine.\n\nSo what comes after the completion of something? T he number ten represents\nthe result of that completion, i.e., an epilog to it. Ten also reduces to one\nwhen we add its digits (1 + 0 = 1), so it indicates the beginning of a new\ncycle, a rebirth. Also, being a transcendent version of the number one, which\nrepresents the individual self, ten represents community, the collective self.\nOn the other hand, coming after the completion indicated by the number nine,\nten can indicate going too far. In that case, it indicates overkill or the\nlast straw.\n\nAny number higher than t en can be interpreted using the preceding\nnumerological discussion in one of two ways: reduction or transcendence.\nReduction is the process of adding the digits of a number to arrive at a new\nnumber of fewer digits. Thus, for example, 19 reduces to 10 (1 + 9 = 10),\nwhich can be reduced further to 1 (1 + 0 = 1). Transcendence, on the other\nhand, is the interpretation of a two-digit number by considering it to be a\nhigher order—or transcendent value—of its final digit. As an example, 15 may\nbe considered a higher order of the number 5, consequently representing harder\nproblems than those indicated by the number 5, or signifying a crisis on a\nhigher (i.e., less mundane) level.\n\nWe now have covered every number with the exception of zero , which is\nassigned to only one card in the Tarot deck: the Fool. We never count with\nthis number, and indeed most ancient cultures did not use it at all, lacking\neven the concept of zero. Similarly, centuries ago the Fool was considered to\nbe in a class by itself, not really one of the Major Arcana cards at all.\n\nZero signifies null, nothing, a void. It is emptiness, and thus a longing for\nmanifestation. Just as most creation myths begin with a great cosmic void,\nzero represents a vast, unlimited potential for creativity. Similarly, the\nsymbol for this number, 0, is the eternal circle, which is without beginning\nand without end. Consequently, some people consider the Fool card to represent\nour divine nature.\n\nThe preceding discussion of numerological meanings can shed light on the\nnumbered Tarot cards, but what about the Court Cards, which have no numbers\nexplicitly assigned to them? We can consider these cards to be numbered\nimplicitly instead, and in one of several possible ways.\n\nIf we consider them to be an extension of the sequence running from the Ace\nthrough the Ten, then the Page can be assigned the number 11, the Knight would\nbe 12, the Queen 13, and the King 14. These two digit numbers then can be\ninterpreted using either reduction or transcendence. We also can think of the\nCourt Cards as being in a class of their own, in which case they may be\nnumbered one through four, either beginning with the Page or with the King,\ndepending upon what works best for you. Since these cards are not explicitly\nnumbered, their numerical associations are left up to us, and I have seen each\nof the preceding methods used reasonably and to good effect.\n[[1]](text00000.html#_edn1)\n\nAgain, the numerological meanings presented here are suggestions, not edicts.\nUse them as you will, taking whatever makes sense to you and ignoring the\nrest—at least for the time being. If you care to explore these numerological\nmeanings further in order to come to your own understanding of them,\nespecially as to how they may work best with your particular deck, try the\nfollowing exercise.\n\nStart by laying out all the Aces of your deck side by side in order to see\nwhat concepts relevant to the number one may be common to them. What keywords\nfor this number are suggested by your contemplation of these cards? Repeat\nthis process for the twos, and continue on up to the tens. If you want to add\neven more depth to this process, you can include the relevant Court Cards\n(however it is that you assign numbers to them) and Major Arcana cards as\nwell. Thus, for example, you might include the Pages and the Magician along\nwith the Aces in your consideration of the number one.\n\nBased on the preceding discussion of numerological meanings, the following is\na summarized list of suggested keywords for the numbers Zero through Ten.\n\nZERO . Void, emptiness, creative potential.\n\nONE . Beginnings, seeds, unity, self, ego.\n\nTWO . Choices, decisions, relationships, balance.\n\nTHREE . Creativity, integration, growth, expansion.\n\nFOUR . Structure, stability, boundaries, rest.\n\nFIVE . Conflict, strife, struggle, learning opportunities.\n\nSIX . Readjustment, reciprocal relationships, harmony, appreciation.\n\nSEVEN . Tests, mastery, success, reassessment.\n\nEIGHT . Acceleration, strength, power, progress.\n\nNINE . Endings, completion, climax, accomplishment.\n\nTEN . Epilog, rebirth, a new cycle, community, overkill, the last straw.\n\n###  Elemental Associations\n\nCenturies ago the world was considered to be composed of four elements: earth,\nair, water, and fire. [[2]](text00000.html#_edn2) Today, we categorize the\ncomponents of the physical world by atomic structure, classifying them into a\nmultitude of elements such as oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. Nevertheless, the\nancient concept is still useful in a philosophical and metaphysical sense, and\ncharacteristics that have been assigned to each of the four elements can, by\nextension, be associated with the four Tarot suits as well.\n[[3]](text00000.html#_edn3) Although some Tarot decks use different methods,\nthe most common way to associate these elements with the Tarot suits is as\nfollows:\n\nWands -- Fire\n\nCups -- Water\n\nSwords -- Air\n\nPentacles -- Earth\n\nThis scheme is quite widespread, and it is the one used with the almost\nubiquitous Rider Waite Smith (RWS) deck and with the many decks based on it.\nThus, this system is the one that will be discussed in this chapter.\n\nLet us now explore the characteristics of each suit using its elemental\nassociation to aid us in our understanding of it. Some of the meanings\nattributed to the suits will be intuitively obvious based on the suit’s emblem\nand on its elemental association, while others that may seem less obvious\narise from tradition and common convention. In either case, what follows are\nsuggestions for your consideration.\n\nWands are made of wood, and their suit is associated with fire. Thus, this\nsuit is characterized by growth and energy. As an aspect of our being, this\nsuit corresponds to the spark of life that burns within us, and consequently\nit also is associated with our will, passion, and libido. As an aspect of a\nproject or endeavor, the suit of Wands relates to the desire and inspiration\nthat initiated it and to the burning enthusiasm that drives it.\n\nCups are receptacles, and their suit is associated with water, which flows,\nnourishes, and refreshes. Also, water’s surface can be reflective like a\nmirror, and it can be profound and fathomless, like the depths of an ocean.\nThis suit, then, is associated with the mysterious unconscious mind and with\nthe ever-flowing feelings that both arise from and return to its depths. As an\naspect of our being, it corresponds to our emotions and our relationships, as\nwell as to our imagination. As an aspect of a project or endeavor, the suit of\nCups relates to an emotional or subconscious response or reaction to the\noriginal idea or impetus for the venture. Note, however, that it is our\nimagination that begins to give form to a project, just as a cup gives form to\nthe fluid poured into it.\n\nSwords, with their sharp edges, can be either a weapon or a useful tool, and\nthe element of their suit is air. A mind can be sharp as well, and it too can\nbe either a weapon or a tool, depending on how it is used. This suit typically\nis associated with mental activity such as logic, reason, and communication.\nConsidering some of the ways in which a sword can be used, this suit also is\nassociated with action, conflict, and cruelty. The airy aspect of the suit of\nSwords calls to mind volatility and stormy situations on the one hand and\nclarity of thought on the other. Thus, as an aspect of our being, this suit\ncorresponds to our thoughts, prejudices, and concepts. As an aspect of a\nproject or endeavor, it relates to the analysis, decision-making, planning,\nand call to action from which the undertaking is forged.\n\nPentacles, as generally depicted in Tarot decks, are the coins of wealth and\ncommerce, and this suit is associated with the element of earth. Thus, it is\nrelated to earthiness and being grounded, physical fitness and material\nresources, and money and prosperity. It also relates to security, value, and a\nsense of worth, as well as to generosity and charity. As an aspect of our\nbeing, it corresponds to the strength, health, and sensations of our physical\nbody. As an aspect of a project or endeavor, the suit of Pentacles relates to\nthe physical labor that executes the plan as well as to the tangible\nmanifestation of it.\n\nThere is, in addition, a deeply spiritual aspect to the suit of Pentacles. The\nact of simple labor can be intensely contemplative, even spiritually so, and\nit is through our acts of charity and generosity toward other people that we\ndraw near to our divine nature. Thus, the wheel has turned full circle. Myths,\nsuch as that of Prometheus, tell us that fire was a gift from the gods. The\nflame of life and the spark of inspiration that are associated with the suit\nof Wands come from a divine source, and we return to that aspect of\nspirituality with the suit of Pentacles when it manifests in its noblest form.\n\nFinally, the Major Arcana cards, which can be thought of as a fifth suit in\nthe deck, are associated with the quintessential element of the soul. This\nsuit is concerned with morality and spirituality, as well as the themes and\nphilosophical undertones of our lives. It also deals with the major milestones\nand archetypes of our lives.\n\nAs with the numerological discussion earlier in this chapter, keep in mind\nthat the interpretations given here for the Tarot suits are suggestions, not\nmandates. If you would like to delve further into the meanings of the suits,\nand thus arrive at a more personalized understanding of them, you may want to\ntry an exercise similar to the one suggested for numerological associations.\n\nFirst, lay out all of the cards in the suit of Wands: Ace through Ten, plus\nthe Court Cards if you want to include them too. Think about any phrases that\nuse this suit’s element, fire, and consider how they might comment on\ncharacteristics apparent in many of the cards in this suit. For example, what\ndo the phrases “all fired up” or “carrying a torch” suggest about the cards in\nthis suit? Consider also what implications this suit’s emblem, a wand, may\nhave on its meaning. Then contemplate the cards you have laid out before you,\npaying attention to your gut reactions to them. What patterns do you see as\nbeing predominant in this suit, and what concepts or themes seem to run\nthrough it? Is there a general, underlying feeling that you get from most of\nthe cards in this suit? What keywords for the suit of Wands do all of these\nthoughts and feelings recommend? Next, repeat this process for the other three\nsuits: Cups, Swords, and Pentacles. You may, of course, want to do this\nexercise with the Major Arcana cards as well.\n\nThe following is a summarized list of suggested keywords and phrases for the\nTarot suits:\n\nWANDS . Growth, energy, willpower, passion, libido, desire, inspiration,\nenthusiasm.\n\nCUPS . Receptivity, reflection, subconscious, imagination, emotions,\nrelationships.\n\nSWORDS . Thought, intellect, logic, reason, analysis, decision, communication,\nconflict.\n\nPENTACLES . Grounded, strength, resources, money, wealth, commerce, labor,\nprosperity, security, charity, generosity, body, materialism.\n\nMAJOR ARCANA . Spirituality, soul, morality, ethics, philosophy, karma,\narchetypes, milestones.\n\n###  Combining Associations\n\nHow, then, can you use these numerological and elemental associations to help\nyou understand Tarot cards?  First, figure out what, from the preceding\ndiscussions, works for you. Remember, of course, that you can (and probably\nwill) change your mind about numerological and elemental meanings as time goes\non and as you accumulate more experience using them. For now, however, a good\nstart is to decide on a few keywords or phrases for each suit and for the\nnumbers one through ten. Once you have these meanings in mind, you can use\nthem to question, validate, or expand upon your understanding of any Tarot\ncard.\n\nFirst, consider a particular card, thinking about what it means to you. Its\nmeaning may be the result of what you have learned from a book, from a\nteacher, from your prior experience in working with the cards, from the\nfeelings and ideas that the images and symbols on the card evoke, or from any\ncombination of these. Then think about the meanings you associate with the\ncard’s number and suit. How do these numerological and elemental meanings\nrelate to your understanding of this card? Are they in accord or do they\nclash? If there are conflicts, all the better, for it is in the resolution of\nsuch discord that we often gain the most profound insights.\n\n![HEART and 3 Swords GIF version 50pct.gif](Image00002.jpg)\n\nAs an example, let us work with the Three of Swords, which is often\nillustrated with a heart pierced by three swords. Typically, this card is seen\nas being indicative of sorrow and heartbreak, but such meanings have emotional\nconnotations, which are more typically in the realm of the suit of Cups. We\ncan use the fact that this card’s suit, Swords, is about thoughts and\ncommunication (among other things) in order to expand upon its meaning. Thus,\nthe Three of Swords may express a need to better understand your sorrow, or it\ncan indicate an opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation of the emotional\npain of others, perhaps as a result of your own experience with heartbreak.\n\nThe association of communication with the suit of Swords can lead to some\ninteresting reinterpretations of this card as well. In light of that, this\ncard may indicate a need to express your sorrow, perhaps through the cathartic\ncleansing of a good cry. Alternatively, this card can indicate pain that is\ncaused by caustic and hurtful words.\n\nThis card is also a Three, so there are elements of growth and integration in\nit as well. For example, an emotionally wrenching experience also may be a\nlearning experience that can impel you to mature and grow, helping you to\nbecome a better person.\n\nThere is an important point that needs to be made here. Just as there are no\ncompletely good or bad cards, numerological and elemental associations have a\nspectrum of meanings, ranging from positive, encouraging messages to the more\nnegative aspect of warnings and admonishments. For example, besides indicating\nreason and logic, the suit of Swords also can suggest a cold-hearted\nseparation from our emotions and spirituality. The love and compassion of the\nCups can degenerate into sentimentality and moodiness. A dark side of the\nself-reliance of the Ones is self-centered egotism, and the supportive\nstructure of the Fours can be stifling sometimes.\n\n![C Cups 10 33pct.jpg](Image00003.jpg)\n\nTo illustrate some negative aspects of numbers and suits, let us consider the\nTen of Cups. This card is generally seen in a positive light, often being\ninterpreted as an indication of a happy family or the realization of your\nhopes and dreams. However, besides relating to love and relationships, the\nsuit of Cups also can deal with our subconscious and our imagination, while\nthe Tens can mean overkill. Thus, this card may be saying that what seems like\na happy home is actually an illusion wrought from wishful thinking. Perhaps\nyou require that your relationships be perfect, so you ignore fundamental\nproblems and see everything as being all sweetness and light. Also, if we\ncombine the Ten’s meaning of “too much” with the Cups’ “emotions,” then this\ncard may be saying that you are too emotionally involved in a relationship to\nbe able to evaluate it objectively. Consequently, perhaps you see only what\nyou want to see.\n\nThis discussion shows how negative numerological and elemental meanings can\nreveal some of the shadow aspects of a Tarot card. It is important to be able\nto find these darker aspects of the cards because sometimes a card that is\nusually thought of as a “good card” can turn up in a problematic position of a\nspread. (Many beginning Tarot readers find it hard to see how the Ten of Cups,\nfor example, can be an obstacle.) On the other hand, the more positive aspects\nof a card’s numerological and elemental associations can reveal the brighter\nside of a card that is typically seen as negative, and it is important to be\nable to see this as well.\n\nThe point of all this is not that you should throw out your previous\nunderstanding of a card, but rather that sometimes you may want to alter or\nexpand upon it based on the meanings of its associated number and suit. Of\ncourse, if you are having difficulties understanding a card in the first\nplace, the use of numerological and elemental meanings can help you jumpstart\nyour discovery process.\n\n  \nChapter 2\n\n##  Court Cards\n\nThe Court Cards tend to be the most difficult ones for students to understand.\nThe Major Arcana cards exhibit a striking archetypal energy that elicits a\nvisceral reaction, and the numbered Minor Arcana cards exhibit a simple,\neveryday familiarity that is relatively easy to grasp. The Court Cards, on the\nother hand, depict psychological nuances that can be subtle and hard to\ncomprehend.\n\nThis chapter will suggest ways of finding meanings for Court Cards through\nconsideration of their suit and rank. The explanations here rely a lot on the\ntraditional hierarchical ordering of an actual royal court, which makes them\neasy to remember. [[4]](text00000.html#_edn4) Of course, further discussion of\nthese sixteen cards can be found in the Appendix of this book, where all of\nthe Tarot cards are discussed.\n\nThe two most common ways of interpreting Court Cards is to see them as people\nin the querent’s life or as attributes of the querent\n[[5]](text00000.html#_edn5) . If we see them as other people, then the\nelemental attributes of a Court Card’s suit can shed light on the personality\ntraits of whoever is indicated by the card. You will want to determine what\nassociations work best for you, but here are some suggestions.\n\nFirst, Wands can indicate people with a fiery, passionate disposition, Cups\nmay depict people who are emotional or temperamental, Swords can indicate\nthose who are aloof, analytical, or emotionally unavailable, and Pentacles may\nrefer to practical and down-to-earth people.\n\nThen the rank of the Court Card further defines the person, and there are\nvarious ways to assign meaning to each rank. The most common way is to say\nthat Pages are children or teenagers, Knights are young adults, Queens are\nmature women, and Kings are mature men. Thus, for example, the Page of Wands\nmight be a willful, unruly child that is prone to violent outbursts.\n\nA different way to use the rank of a Court Card is to say that a Page is\nsomeone younger than the querent, a Knight is one of the querent’s peers, and\na King or a Queen is a man or a woman (respectively) who is older than the\nquerent. Similarly, in a hierarchical environment, such as the querent’s\nworkplace or an organization to which she belongs, a Page may be someone\nsubordinate to her, a Knight may be a co-worker or peer, and a King or a Queen\nwould then be a man or a woman above the querent in the hierarchy.\n\nYet another associative method is to say that a Page is someone who helps the\nquerent learn things or who brings her a message, a Knight is someone who\nhelps the querent explore something, a Queen is one who supports or nurtures\nthe querent, and a King is an authority figure who directs the querent or\ncontrols her actions. In this case, the suit of the Court Card determines the\narea in which this person affects the querent’s life.\n\nFor example, if we assign desire and enthusiasm to Wands, the King of Wands\nmay be someone who controls the querent’s ability to satisfy some desire. If\nwe associate Cups with relationships, then the Queen of Cups may be someone\nwho supports a romantic affair. If Swords mean thoughts and ideas, then the\nKnight of Swords might be someone who is exploring new concepts with the\nquerent. And if Pentacles indicate work, then the Page of Pentacles might be\nsomeone who helps the querent learn a skill she needs for a job.\n\nSo far, this discussion has related Court Cards to someone other than the\nquerent, but a Court Card also can refer to aspects, roles, or traits of the\nquerent himself. The easiest way to understand such personality aspects of a\nCourt Card is to see it as representing a stage of maturity or as a level of\ninitiation relative to what its suit represents.\n\nWith that in mind, a Page can indicate that the querent is learning or\nbeginning something. Consequently, it can imply a questioning or searching\nattitude, a studious approach to something, beginner’s luck, or the sense of\nawe and wonder of a new initiate.\n\nA Knight, no longer a tentative Page but not yet having the maturity of a\nQueen or a King, can be the most volatile of the Court Cards. He has learned\nenough to exhibit confidence, although perhaps not enough to gain competence,\nand he tends to be cocky and self-assured. A Knight in a reading may indicate\nthat the querent is not afraid to charge ahead and explore something, even if\nhe may get his nose bloodied as a consequence. But if the querent can manifest\na Knight’s better nature, he will pick himself up when he falls, learn from\nhis mistakes, and continue to grow.\n\nAt the level indicated by a Queen, the querent has matured and become\ncompetent in what she does. Now she is expanding upon her skills and becoming\ncreative with them. As a Queen, she also tends to be supportive, nurturing,\nexpressive, and relationship-oriented.\n\nA King may indicate that the querent is an expert or authority in the arena\ngoverned by the card’s suit. Kings also can be directive, controlling, and\ncommanding. Whereas a Queen tends to deal more in the realm of interpersonal\nrelationships, the concerns of a King lean more toward civic duties and social\nresponsibilities.\n\nWhen using a Court Card to describe the querent, its rank does not indicate\nthe querent’s age. Sometimes a youth may act with the maturity of a Queen or\nKing, and some senior citizens can act with the immaturity of a Page. An\neighty-year-old man might take up a new hobby and manifest the exuberance and\nenthusiasm of a Page of Wands, and a girl can nurture a younger sibling like a\nQueen of Pentacles. Likewise, neither sex is limited to certain Court Card\nranks. A man can assume a Queen-like nurturing role, and a woman can be in a\nKing-like position of responsibility and leadership.\n\nThis chapter has presented several ways to come to an understanding of the\nsixteen Court Cards. It is up to you to choose which of these methods make\nsense to you, although you can use different ones for different readings,\ndepending on the circumstances. You also need to decide on what the four Court\nCard ranks and the four suits mean to you. Then you will be ready to use the\nmeanings of both the suit and rank of a Court Card to arrive at a workable\nmeaning for it.\n\nIn fact, it is a valuable exercise to do this for each of the sixteen Court\nCards. Record the various meanings that arise from this consideration in a\nsort of dictionary of Court Card meanings, then review and revise this\ndictionary from time to time. If you do this, you will find that when a Court\nCard comes up in a reading, it will make sense to you based on the meanings\nthat you, yourself, have created for it.\n\nAs a final note about using Court Cards, it is important to keep in mind that\nno one can be completely characterized by any one these cards. Each of us is a\ntapestry woven from all sixteen Court Card threads, although we may be made\nfrom more of one thread than another.\n\nDuring a reading, a Court Card may be indicative of a role that the querent\n(or someone in her life) is playing in the current circumstances, an aspect of\nher personality that she needs to examine, or a recommendation as to what\ncharacteristic or trait she would do well to cultivate in order to solve a\nproblem she is having. For example, the Queen of Cups may indicate that the\nquerent can heal a problematic relationship with loving support and\nunderstanding. Or the Knight of Wands may say that the querent is being too\nimpulsive and taking too many risks right now.\n\nIn short, remember that a Court Card does not encompass the totality of a\nperson’s psyche. Rather, it indicates something about that person that is\nimportant to understand in the context of the reading in which it appears.\n\n  \nChapter 3\n\n##  Finding Card Meanings\n\nSomething that Tarot teachers often have their students do is determine a\nkeyword or key phrase for each of the Tarot cards. This is an excellent\nstarting point, for that first keyword can be like a grain of sand in an\noyster, acting like a seed for the pearl of wisdom that your subsequent work\nand experience with that card will create.\n\nOne step in the process of finding keywords is to read what other people say\nabout the cards, but certainly that is only a small step along the path to\nunderstanding. The explanations given by other people may work for them, but\nthey may not work for you. And to complicate matters, every Tarot author or\nteacher has a different take on each card. Indeed, it can be quite distressing\nwhen you find a new meaning for a card that is diametrically opposed to other\ndefinitions for it, definitions presumably written by people with good\ncredentials in the field.\n\nThus, what someone else says about a card should not be the final destination.\nRather, finding out what others have to say about Tarot cards is merely a\nvehicle for taking you further down the path of understanding. This chapter\npresents some methods for finding your own way along that path, methods that\ncan help you resolve conflicts between varying definitions for a card.\n\nThe easiest case is when one of the explanations you have read seems to\nresonate with you, while the others fail to ring true. In that case you can\nchoose to use the one that seems right for you. I have to say, however, that I\nhave never felt comfortable doing that, mainly because I never seem to find\nthat one author’s insights hit the bull’s-eye while all the others’ completely\nmiss the mark. Thus I’ve generally used the following method.\n\nThere is usually at least a grain of truth in what every author says about\neach of the cards. So after reading what various authors say about a given\ncard, you can use those meanings that seem to make sense, and you can combine\nthe various authors’ insights in order to synthesize new meanings that work\nfor you. Those different meanings, then, will manifest in different contexts,\ndepending upon the nature of the question being asked, the card's location in\nthe spread, the other cards around it, etc.\n\nYou also can resolve conflicting definitions by exploring your own meanings\nfor it. In that case, you may want to check out Mary K. Greer's Tarot for Your\nSelf , which contains exercises to help you do just that. For a detailed\nexplanation of Greer’s methods, I refer you to this book, which is an\nexcellent resource for anyone interested in Tarot.\n\nHowever, when you come across a couple of definitions for a card that are so\nutterly opposed to each other that they are more confusing than illuminating,\nwhat can you do? Or what if even after synthesizing the various meanings you\nhave come across, you still do not feel you have an adequate understanding of\na particular card? What else might you do to deepen your relationship with\nthat card?\n\nA solution once suggested to me by John Ballantrae via the Tarot-L online\ndiscussion list was to do a Tarot reading to find out what a particular card\nshould mean to you. What a fascinating solution! For this sort of reading, the\nspread that has worked best for me is a basic three-card spread; any more\ncards than that gets more complicated than I find it needs to be. I do not\nassign specific meanings to the three locations, such as &quot;Past&quot;,\n&quot;Present&quot;, and &quot;Future&quot;. Instead, I read the three cards\nas a narrative answer to the question, “Who am I?” as posed by the card I am\ninterested in. You may find that you prefer a different spread, so use\nwhatever works best for you.\n\nA classic example of conflicting definitions is the Fool card. In her book,\nEasy Tarot Guide , Marcia Masino describes The Fool as the “God card” of the\nTarot and says that it symbolizes a universal and guiding “Creative Power.”\nShe also asserts that if an author claims that The Fool is a foolish or stupid\naction, then that author doesn’t really understand The Fool, doesn’t believe\nin such divine powers, or is not at liberty to disclose the Fool’s true\nmeaning due to an arcane oath of secrecy. [[6]](text00000.html#_edn6)\n\nOn the other hand, in Classic Tarot Spreads , Sandor Konraad attributes to The\nFool the meanings of confusion, simple-mindedness, and an ill-fated\nundertaking when it appears at the beginning of a reading. When it appears at\nthe end of a reading, he says it means a fool who has grown in wisdom and\nhumanity. [[7]](text00000.html#_edn7)\n\nGranted, Masino and Konraad were using different decks (the RWS deck vs. the\nOswald Wirth Tarot), but even so, I was baffled by this discrepancy when I\nfirst encountered it. In addition, other books provide still different\nmeanings for this card, generally lying somewhere between Masino's and\nKonraad's. Reconciling them all would have taken the wisdom of Solomon ... or\nof the Tarot. Since the Tarot was the more accessible of the two, I turned to\nit.\n\nFor my reading to explore the meaning of the Fool, I used the RWS deck, and\nthe three cards I drew were the Tower, Temperance, and the Two of Wands.\nFirst, let me note briefly what these three cards meant to me at the time that\nI did this reading.\n\nThe Tower can indicate a bolt of insight from our higher consciousness or from\nthe divine nature of the Universe. It may take the form of an unexpected\nexternal catastrophe, or it may be a gut-wrenching emotional experience. When\nit happens, it may be a blow to our ego or a shattering of our pride. It also\nshould be noted that lightning connects Heaven and Earth, and thus, in\naddition, the Tower can indicate a spiritual wakeup call inherent in this\ncrisis.\n\nThe Temperance card often indicates a state of being centered and balanced,\nand it is especially indicative of a balance between our spirituality and our\nphysical existence. In addition, the flow of liquid between the two cups held\nby the angel in many versions of this card can indicate a blending or fusion\nof two things of disparate natures, and thus it implies a transformative power\nas well.\n\nThe Two of Wands can mean boldness and audacity in planning or undertaking an\nadventure or enterprise of some sort. It also might indicate the beginning of\na new enterprise or the ability to manifest an idea concretely. Note also that\nthe figure in the RWS version of this card is both looking out at the real\nworld before him and holding the world (a globe) in his hands, thus reminding\nus of the inherent duality between our conceptual models and the reality they\nrepresent.\n\nThis discussion so far raises an interesting point. This procedure seems a bit\nlike pulling yourself up by the bootstraps. If you are a relative novice, you\nmay ask, “How do you learn to understand a Tarot card using a reading if you\ndon’t fully understand Tarot cards yet?” The answer is that understanding the\ncards is an evolving process. Certainly, before you try this technique you\nneed to have some concept of what the cards mean, or at least the patience to\nlook them up or to determine their meanings as best you can as you proceed.\nBut even so, when I did this reading for The Fool my understanding of the\ncards was still rather rudimentary, yet I was able to get a lot out of the\nprocess.\n\nWhat I saw in this reading was that the Fool starts off from a point of being\ncast down to nothing (or &quot;zero&quot;). In other words, he is a blank\nslate unencumbered by pride and attachments. Therefore he is pure potential,\nand he is ready for new beginnings. Being at that point, he has an innocent\nbalance and centered- ness that can transform him, giving him the boldness and\ncourage required to go forth and manifest his vision.\n\nThis reading also helped me reconcile the two seemingly disparate explanations\nof the Fool that had originally confused me, those being that either he is a\nbuffoon who is foolish in the literal sense of the word, or he is a recipient\nor embodiment of the divine power that guides the universe. What I saw is that\nthose of us who seem to be a &quot;buffoon&quot;, i.e. people freed of the\nconstraints of ego, are the ones who are able to receive and act upon divine\ninspiration.\n\nIf you are struggling with the meaning of any of the cards, you may want to\ntry this. Do your own reading to find out what that card means, and you will\nfind a definition that works for you. I want to emphasize that I am not\nsuggesting that you need to do seventy-eight different readings to find the\nmeanings of all seventy-eight cards in a Tarot deck. You can pick and choose\namong the various techniques mentioned in this article for each card. But you\nwill find that whenever you let a card be your querent, you will open up a\ndialogue with it that will inevitably reveal new meaning, both for it and for\nyour own life.\n\n  \nChapter 4\n\n##  Reversed Cards\n\n![A Major 12 Hanged Man 33pct.jpg](Image00004.jpg) ![A Major 12 Hanged Man\nRx.jpg](Image00005.jpg)\n\nWhen a Tarot card is oriented so that the image is upside down, the card is\nsaid to be reversed. There are many ways to interpret reversed cards, and\nbeing able to do so is a skill that can take a considerable amount of practice\nto learn. In fact, some Tarot readers decide not to use reversed cards at all.\nThey keep all the cards in their deck in an upright orientation, and if a card\nsomehow does turn up reversed, they turn it back upright and ignore its\ninitial reversed orientation. I, on the other hand, do use reversed cards in\nmy readings, and since reversals are used in this book, a few words on this\nsubject are in order.\n\nThis chapter presents a couple of ways of accounting for the effect that a\nreversal has on a card’s meaning. First, it describes a simple mnemonic method\nthat I call “The Five D’s of Reversed Cards.” Next it presents a more graphic\ndepiction, which I call “The Reversal Cube,” of the various effects that a\nreversal can have on a card’s meaning.\n\nThese are just two suggested ways of handling reversals, but there are many\nothers that people commonly use. Regardless of what method you ultimately\nchoose to employ, the crucial point is that for each reading you should\ncommunicate your specific intent to your unconscious mind, and then stick with\nthat method.\n\n###  The Five D’s of Reversed Cards\n\nIn confronting the issue of dealing with reversed cards, I came up with an\napproach based on a synthesis of the various methods I had been taught and had\nread about, and I then refined this technique based upon my experiences using\nit. In this system, I determine a reversed card’s meaning by considering that\nit may be affected by one of what I call the Five D’s of Reversed Cards ,\nwhich are:\n\nDiminution of the “original” effect or energy of the card.\n\nDelay of the “original” effect.\n\nDenial that something is going on or that it is a problem in your life. Note\nthat this denial may be active (i.e., lack of acceptance) or passive (i.e.,\nlack of awareness).\n\nDark Side of the “original” meaning. An example of considering the dark side\nof, say, the Knight of Pentacles might be to say that his prudence has become\na case of “all work and no play.”\n\nDirection of the “original” meaning is reversed. For example, the Hermit is\noften thought to mean going into seclusion, so reversed it may mean coming out\nof your shell and increasing your interaction with other people. Or this may\nmean that there is inner work to be done on the issue indicated by the card,\nor that the energy of the card is affecting you internally instead of visibly\nmanifesting in your life.\n\nWhich of the “Five D’s” I might use in a specific situation depends upon its\ncontext within the reading, such as its position in the spread, the question\nbeing asked, and the tone of the other cards in the spread. For example, I am\nmore apt to use “diminution” if the card is in a position that refers to the\npast, while I might be inclined to use “delay” when it is in the future. If it\nis in a position that deals with problems or obstacles, I may find either\n“denial” or “dark side” more appropriate. And if the card refers to the\nquerent, “denial” may be suitable again, or perhaps “direction reversed” may\nseem best.\n\nI try to use the “Five D’s” as a general guideline kept in the back of my\nmind, instead of slavishly picking over them, as in, “Hmm. Which ‘D’ should I\nuse for this reversed card? How about ... Diminution?” Rather than making this\na conscious choice, I have planted these five D’s into my unconscious mind.\nThen when I look at a reversed card I let an interpretation intuitively bubble\nup from those D’s floating around in the back of my mind.\n\nFor me, this mnemonic device seems to be a more flexible approach than\ncreating seventy-eight new keywords for the cards in reversed positions, which\nis what some people do. You, of course, may want to explore various ways that\na reversal can affect a card’s meaning, and then create your own mnemonic\ndevice to help you remember them. [[8]](text00000.html#_edn8)\n\n###  The Reversal Cube\n\nThe technique that I call “the Reversal Cube” takes into account varying\nobstructions or levels of expression of a card’s energy, using concepts\nsimilar to those employed in the preceding Five D’s of Reversed Cards method.\nBut instead of a mnemonic device, it uses a graphic illustration, which seems\neasier to use for people with spatially oriented minds.\n\nI began with the following chart, which has three axes that delineate a three-\ndimensional space. Each axis defines a possible “spectrum of modification” for\na card. The horizontal axis (left to right) moves from the past to the future.\nThe vertical axis (bottom to top) is psychological and moves from internal to\nexternal. And finally, the third axis (perpendicular to the page) deals with\npatterns of resistance, moving from internal resistances to external blocks.\n\n![Reversal Cube.gif](Image00006.jpg)\n\nWhen a card is reversed, its meaning is more likely to lie somewhere on the\noutskirts of this three-dimensional continuum, and so it is being modified in\none or more of the following ways.\n\nDiminution : The card may indicate something that was manifest in the past,\nbut is now fading. This can mean a problem that is being resolved, or it can\nindicate a capacity that the querent has discarded or neglected.\n\nDelay : The card’s energy may be embryonic. It could be an unrealized\npotential that may take some time to manifest, or it might be a warning of an\nundesirable development waiting in the wings.\n\nInternalization : The card may highlight some internal (i.e., psychological)\nwork that the querent needs to do, thus indicating qualities, abilities, or\ntraits that she needs to develop. Or it may indicate external problems for\nwhich the querent has erroneously taken blame or responsibility.\n\nProjection : The querent may be seeing the qualities of this card in other\npeople instead of realizing that they exist within him. This can manifest as\naccusing other people of flaws he does not want to acknowledge within himself.\nAlternatively, it can take the form of “living by proxy,” i.e., attaching to a\nperson who exhibits qualities he wishes he could realize in himself. (Court\nCards are more likely to exhibit this type of reversal effect than Pip cards\nor Major Arcana cards.)\n\nInternal Resistance : This can indicate a conscious or unconscious blockage of\nthe card’s energy, such as our resistance to learning the important lessons in\nlife.\n\nExternal Blocks : In our journey through life, we often encounter rough roads\nand roadblocks. This aspect of reversals may be a warning that it will be\ndifficult to attain the promise of this card, so the querent should prepare to\nmake a concerted effort in order to attain it.\n\nNote that a reversal may manifest anywhere within the space defined by this\ndiagram, and thus the factors modifying it may be blended. For example, we\nmight have a case where there are external blocks that will cause a delay . Or\nthe effects of the card may be diminishing , but there is still some internal\nresistance , so the querent has internal work to do in this area.\n\nIf this representation seems overly complex, you may decide to use just one\naxis (or perhaps two of them) and only consider the modifications defined by\nthat axis while doing a particular reading. Just be sure to remain true to\nyour intention while you do that reading.\n\nUpright cards also can manifest any of these modifications to their meanings,\nbut the probability of a card’s meaning being shifted very far from center on\nany of these axes is much higher if the card is reversed. It’s as if a\nreversed card is saying, “Hey, look here! My energy is being affected. I\nreally must insist that you try to see how.” But how do you do that? How do\nyou discern where a reversal lies on this graph of modification?\n\nWith experience your intuition will guide you, but in addition, an excellent\nguide is careful questioning of the querent and attentive listening to her\nanswers, which takes practice. Deep down, the querent usually does know how\nthe card’s energy is being affected in her life; she just may not be\nconsciously aware of it until you draw the answer out of her.\n\nThis method is merely another way of considering reversals. If you like it,\nyou may find it useful in your practice. If not, hopefully it has at least\ngiven you some food for thought.\n\n###  Alternatives\n\nOne last note about reversed cards concerns the many possible options\navailable for working with them. If you ask ten Tarot readers how to interpret\nreversed cards, you are liable to get at least eleven different answers. Some\npeople always read with them; some never do. Some will tell you that you must\nread with them, while I know of one Tarot teacher and author who insists that\nusing reversals is a bad habit that should be avoided at all costs. Some\npeople may look at a reversed card and interpret it based upon the upside-down\nimagery. Still others use seventy-eight separate keywords for the reversed\ncards, while some just say that the energy of the card is not yet manifest, or\nis blocked, or is delayed, or ...\n\nThe point is that there is no right or wrong way of using reversed cards. This\nchapter has presented some suggestions, and the sample readings in this book\nillustrate various ways of interpreting a reversed card. Ultimately, however,\nthe decision of whether or not to use reversed cards is up to you, as is the\ndecision of how to use them. Just be sure that you always make your intention\nclear to your unconscious mind before you start any reading.\n\n  \nChapter 5\n\n##  Rephrasing the Question\n\nShould a Tarot reader rephrase the querent’s question for a reading? This\napparently simple question is actually quite complex, and it is guaranteed to\nstir up more than a bit of controversy when raised among a group of Tarot\nreaders. Some people argue that the question that the querent brings to a\nreading is the question he wants answered, and so they always do a reading for\nexactly the question asked. Others feel that a vague or ill-formed question\nwill lead to a less-than-helpful answer. They maintain that the more focused\nthe question, the more relevant and precise the answer will be, and the more a\nquestion is based upon an assumption of empowerment, the more the answer will\nshow the querent how to take control of his life. In short, many Tarot readers\nfeel that the better a question is phrased, the more helpful the answer will\nbe.\n\nIndeed, every question has certain assumptions imbedded within it. For\nexample, some questions may assume that we are powerless to shape our destiny.\nOthers tend to presume guilt in another person, such as ones like, “How can I\nfind out what my girlfriend is doing behind my back?” We cannot eliminate all\nsuch assumptions from our questions, but at least we can try to be aware of\nwhat those assumptions are. Then we have a chance of rephrasing our questions\nin order to eliminate some of the assumptions or to incorporate others that\nare better.\n\nWhile there are no hard and fast rules, this chapter will suggest ways to\nhandle some of the thornier types of questions that come up. Ultimately, of\ncourse, it is up to you to decide for yourself how to handle this issue.\n\n###  Fortunetelling Questions\n\nOf the various types of questions that may need to be rephrased, perhaps the\nmost common is the type wherein the querent wants to know what will happen in\nthe future. On the surface, this sounds innocent enough. After all,\nfortunetelling is typically what the general public thinks of as the use of\nTarot cards. However, a major problem with these questions is their inherent\nassumption that anyone can tell the future with absolute certainty and that\nthe future is immutable.\n\nWhenever such questions come up, I begin by explaining my philosophy about\npredicting the future, which is that although a reading may indicate a\nprobable outcome, I don’t believe that it can tell the exact future, because\nthe future is not etched in stone. We make our own future—either by actively\nworking to shape it or by passively accepting whatever comes to pass. Because\nof this, the best purpose of a Tarot reading is to provide the querent with\ninsights about himself and about the world around him in order to show him how\nto create the future he wants.\n\nThis leads to another problem with such questions, which is the fact that they\nreflect a querent’s attitude that he is resigned to being a victim of fate,\ninstead of being determined to become the master of his own fate. Often a\nquerent wants to know the outcome of a course of action, or he may want to\nknow if a specified event will come to pass, whether that may be something he\ndesires or something he fears. In such cases, I try to work with the querent\nto rephrase the question to put it into a form that empowers him to create the\nfuture he wants. For example, “Will I get the promotion I want?” might be\nrephrased as: “What do I need to do to get the promotion I want?”\n\nA bit more difficult are questions like, “Will my boyfriend ask me to marry\nhim?” For relationship questions like that, we can’t, in essence, ask what the\nquerent can do to make her boyfriend propose to her. Instead, I try to refocus\nsuch questions on the querent. Perhaps, “What do I need to know about my\nrelationship with my boyfriend?” Or, “What do I need to do to improve my\nrelationship with my boyfriend?” At the very least, I would rephrase such a\nquestion to be, “Do things look favorable for my boyfriend to ask me to marry\nhim?” and then do the reading in such a way that we look at why this may or\nmay not be the case. A three-card spread that works well for this is the\nfollowing:\n\n1. Yes if...\n\n2. No if...\n\n3. Maybe if... [[9]](text00000.html#_edn9)\n\nOf course, all of this reflects my personal attitude toward doing readings\nthat can be called “fortunetelling.” To be quite fair, I grant that this is an\nattitude not shared by some Tarot readers, and I respect that. Some readers\nare very comfortable with doing readings for what will happen in the future,\nin which case they would not feel inclined to rephrase questions of the type\nwe have been discussing. However, if this is your position, you may want to\nconsider that doing such readings puts you in the realm of fortunetelling,\nwhich may be illegal in your city, county, or state. If, instead of saying,\n“This is what will happen,” you say, “This is the probable outcome,” then you\ncan argue that you are no more guilty of fortunetelling than is the\nweatherman. [[10]](text00000.html#_edn10)\n\n###  Timing Questions\n\nClosely related to questions of the form “Will this happen?” are ones like,\n“When will this happen?” Timing questions can be rephrased just like the more\ngeneral fortunetelling questions. Thus, for example, “When will I get a\npromotion” can be restated as “What can I do to get a promotion?” However, an\nalternative to rephrasing this question is to do a reading in such a way that\nit provides more guidance than deterministic answers. The following is an\neffective way to read for a timing question:\n\nAfter you have shuffled the deck, begin laying out cards, one at a time, until\nyou deal one that talks about the outcome about which the querent is asking.\nDeciding when you have come to the probable outcome card is, of course, an\nintuitive call for you to make.\n\nThe cards you laid out before the outcome card depict the sequence of events\nthat have to happen prior to the outcome. They can be considered to be advice\n(i.e., “This is what you have to do prior to attaining this outcome”), or they\nmay be interpreted as signs (i.e., events that will precede the outcome).\n\nAfter you have read these cards, interpret the outcome card. If the probable\noutcome is addressed in the very first card you laid down, this implies that\nit is either already here or quite imminent. Note, however, that the probable\noutcome card may say that the desired outcome seems unlikely. If, for example,\nthe question is one of love and romance, some encouraging probable outcome\ncards could be the Lovers, Ace of Cups, Two of Cups, Ten of Cups, or Four of\nWands. Some rather discouraging ones could be the Hermit, Five of Cups, or\nThree of Swords. In that case, the prior event cards may indicate why the\ndesired event is unlikely, or they may warn of actions that the querent should\navoid in order to manifest the desired event.\n\nIf you lay down quite a few cards and still do not get to a probable outcome\ncard, this may indicate that the outcome is unlikely or that it is too far in\nthe future for this reading to deal with. Of course, how many cards constitute\n“quite a few” is another intuitive call for you to make in the course of the\nreading.\n\n###  'Should' Questions\n\nNext, let’s consider how to handle “Should” questions. “Should I take the job\nthat I recently was offered?” “What should I do about my parents’ interference\nin my life?” “Should I buy this new home?”\n\nWhen the querent asks questions such as these, he may be asking the Tarot to\nmake his decisions for him in an attempt to avoid taking responsibility for\nhis life. I avoid using the tarot to make decisions for a querent, because\nthat will diminish his sense of personal power, which can cripple him.\nInstead, when questions of this sort arise, I work with the querent to put the\nquestion into a form that will shed some light on the situation at hand and\ngive him new perspectives to help him make his decision. So for the examples\ngiven above, I might seek to rephrase them as, “What do I need to know about\nthis job offer?” “What do I need to do to improve my relationship with my\nparents?” and “What are the pros and cons about buying this house?”\n\nRephrasing questions in this way will make them more empowering, but this is\nnot the only way to deal with them. How you choose the spread for a reading\nand how you conduct that reading can return responsibility and power to the\nquerent as well. For example, for a “Should I do A or B” type of question, I\nmight use the following three-card spread:\n\n1. Benefits of choice A\n\n2. A factor that can help you make this decision\n\n3. Benefits of choice B\n\nThis spread will not make the querent’s decision for him. Rather, it is\ndesigned to give him information to help him make this decision for himself.\n\n###  Third Party Questions\n\nAnother common difficulty arises when a querent asks what someone else\n(usually a spouse or boyfriend or girlfriend) is doing, feeling, or thinking.\nFor example, “Does John love me?” or “Is Jane cheating on me?” When that\nhappens, I tell the querent that I cannot do a reading to see what other\npeople are doing, mainly due to my ethics concerning privacy issues.\n[[11]](text00000.html#_edn11) I then tell him that I can, however, do a\nreading to see what he needs to know about his relationship with that other\nperson. For example, I may do a reading for a question like, “What do you need\nto know about your relationship with Jane?”\n\n###  'Yes or No' Questions\n\n“Yes or No” questions are a common problem too, since they usually reflect the\nquerent’s assumption that she has no control over her life. In addition, how\nvaluable is a yes or no answer going to be anyway? For example, consider the\nquestion, “Will I ever find true love?” A “Yes” answer might provide some\nsmall measure of comfort to the querent, but how helpful is it? She may find\nlove, but then will she recognize it, appreciate it, and hold on to it?\nRephrasing such a question to be something like, “What do I need to know about\nhow I handle my relationships?” can reveal the querent’s strengths and\nweaknesses regarding relationships so that she can work to improve her ability\nto find, nurture, and keep them.\n\n###  Professional Advice Questions\n\nOther difficult questions are the ones that ask for professional (i.e.,\nmedical, legal, financial, etc.) advice. When I am asked these questions, I\ntell people that their question is not within my professional expertise, and\nthat if they have specific questions about their health, legal issues,\nfinances, and so on, they should consult a professional in that field. Of all\nthe difficult questions, this type is the most problematic. If you do try to\nanswer a medical question, for example, and you are not a doctor, you could\nfind yourself in deep trouble for practicing medicine without a license.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, however, I may try to rephrase the question\ninto a form that I can answer. Perhaps the reading can probe the querent’s\nattitudes or motivations regarding her question. For example, a question that\nI have encountered more than once is, “Will I get pregnant soon?” The\ncircumstances behind this question could arise from a medical problem, in\nwhich case I would avoid it. But let’s say, for instance, that the querent has\nindicated that she just got married and she and her husband are looking\nforward to having a child. Perhaps she has concerns about being a mother or\nabout the responsibilities and difficulties of raising children. In that case,\nI might rephrase her question to be something like, “What do I need to know\nabout starting a family?”\n\nIt is always difficult to decide whether or not to handle questions that lurk\nin this gray area between what is appropriate to a Tarot reading and what is\nnot. You have to tread carefully over the thin ice of such questions, because\nanswering them can have dire legal ramifications, since you probably are not a\ndoctor, lawyer, accountant, etc. When such questions land in this gray area, I\nusually try to avoid them. Of course, much more problematic is any question\nthat directly asks for a professional diagnosis, such as “Do I have cancer?”\nThese should be avoided completely.\n\n###  Vague Questions\n\nVague questions, on the other hand, require a different type of consideration.\nThese are questions that sound something like this: “Oh ... I don’t know. Can\nyou just tell me what’s going to happen in the near future?” You can do a\ngeneral reading for such questions, and anything from a simple “Past, Present,\nFuture” spread to the more complex Celtic Cross spread may suit the querent’s\nneeds.\n\nHowever, when a question like this comes up, it can be helpful to ask the\nquerent some clarifying questions. You also might want to pull a card to see\nif the Tarot has a suggestion about what the focus of the reading should be.\n\nOften a little discussion with the querent can reveal that there is a specific\nissue with which she is dealing, and for which a reading would be helpful.\nMaybe she was unaware of the importance of this issue until you talked to her\nabout it. Or perhaps, for some reason, she was reluctant to bring up what was\nreally on her mind. Whatever the reason for the querent’s reticence, a simple\nand honest discussion with her can be quite valuable. Chat with her. Ask her\nquestions about herself and about her concerns, and sincerely listen to her\nanswers. This will go a long way toward making her comfortable enough to tell\nyou what is troubling her, and then to participate fully in the reading.\n\n###  Compound Questions\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum from vague questions are the more vexing\ncomplex and compound questions. These questions are loaded with specifics, and\nwith multiple sub-questions. The following is a fictional example of this\ntype, although it is strikingly typical of some questions that I have\nencountered.\n\n“My boyfriend and I are thinking of getting married, and I want to know if\nthat’s a good idea because he doesn’t have a job, and my mother doesn’t think\nit’s right for a wife to support her husband, but will that really be a\nproblem, because I think maybe my income can support us, can’t it?”\n\nThere is so much to work with here that it is hard to know where to start. Is\nthis a romance reading, such as “Should I get married?” Is it a financial one,\nsuch as, “Can my boyfriend and I make a marriage work on the income we have\navailable?” This even may be a request for a reading about this woman’s\nrelationship with her interfering mother.\n\nThe first step toward dealing with long-winded questions like this is to break\nthem down into components to get a list of the various questions that are\nbeing asked here. Then one way to proceed is to do a separate reading for each\ncomponent question. Alternatively, you can get the querent to prioritize these\ncomponent questions, and then decide which to have a reading for now and which\nto put off until a future reading. Or maybe you can do a multi-card reading\nusing one card for each of the component questions. You might even be able to\nrephrase this into one simple, overarching question, such as, “What do I need\nto know about marrying my boyfriend?”\n\nThere are a variety of options for handling complex questions, but if you ask\nthe Tarot a meandering and muddled question, it is most likely that you will\nget an equally meandering and muddled answer.\n\n###  Key Considerations\n\nThe types of questions discussed above are some of the most common ones that\nneed to be rephrased.  This process seems complicated, but just remember that\nthe key considerations for a properly phrased question are:\n\n1. Does it focus on the querent? \n\nIn addition to the fact that there are ethical problems with doing readings\nfor a third party, in the long run, a reading is most helpful when it focuses\non the querent, because the only person he can change is himself.\n\n2. Does it reflect the querent’s responsibility for her life? \n\n“Should I...” questions imply that the querent wants to avoid taking\nresponsibility for her decisions or actions. To help her make her own\ndecisions, a good reading will provide useful information rather than simple\nyes or no answers.\n\n3. Does it empower the querent to positively affect his future?\n\nFocusing on what a querent can do to create a desired outcome rather than\nforetelling the future, which is mutable anyway, will empower him to take\ncontrol of his destiny.\n\n4. Is it something that you, a Tarot reader, are qualified to answer?\n\nIf you’re not a doctor, for example, you should not try to give medical advice\nin a reading or you could wind up in legal trouble.\n\nA brief, sincere discussion with the querent prior to doing a reading will\nhelp the two of you find the best way to phrase the question. And if you can\nformulate the question so that it does the things noted above, then you will\nhave paved the way for a beneficial Tarot reading.\n\n  \nChapter 6\n\n##  Three-Card Spreads\n\nMany years ago when I volunteered to do online readings on a website that\nprovides free readings, I discovered that we were required to use three-card\nspreads for our readings. That sounded simple enough, but at first, the only\nthree-card spreads that came to mind were “Past, Present, Future” and “Body,\nMind, Spirit.” If I had to use three-card spreads, I certainly wanted more\noptions than that. With a little research, however, I eventually was able to\nfind or create dozens of three-card spreads.\n\nThe next thing I noticed was that there are similarities between many of the\nthree-card spreads, and with a little consideration, I was able to come up\nwith seven major categories for them. An examination of those categories\nhelped me understand each specific three-card spread better, and ultimately it\nhas helped me develop new three-card spreads as well.\n\nThis chapter explains those seven groupings, as well as some other spreads\nthat defy categorization. Since most of the readings in this book use three-\ncard spreads, this discussion will clarify such spreads in advance. More\nimportantly, it will help you better understand this type of spread for your\nown use.\n\n###  Temporal Spreads\n\nThe first type of three-card spread is the Temporal Spread. While the passage\nof time is an element of a great many three-card spreads, with this type it is\nthe essential feature. The three cards in this type of spread usually refer to\nthe past, present, and future, but sometimes the starting point is the\npresent, or even the near future.\n\nAn excellent expansion on this theme can be found in Mary Greer’s\nThesis/Antithesis/Synthesis spread, which she mentions in her book, Tarot for\nYour Self . The first card is the Thesis, or an idea that the querent may have\nhad (generally in the past). The next card is the Antithesis, or the reaction\nto that idea (generally going on right now). The last card is the Synthesis,\nor the action needed to implement the idea (in the future), keeping in mind\nthe reaction to it, i.e., the Antithesis. [[12]](text00000.html#_edn12)\n\nOne of my favorite Temporal Spreads is one that has a slightly different time\nframe, examining instead the present, near future, and farther future. The\nfirst card describes the current situation, the next card provides a\nrecommended action (for the near future), and the last card considers a likely\noutcome.\n\n###  Levels of Being\n\nNext there are the three-card spreads that discuss “ Levels of Being.” The\nmost common example is the Body, Mind, and Spirit spread, or the similar Body,\nMind, and Emotion spread. Closely related is a spread that addresses three\nlevels of consciousness: Unconscious, Conscious, and Super-Conscious (or\nHigher Self). In addition, there is the Home, Work, and Relationships spread\nthat covers what are probably the three most important aspects of life for\nmost people.\n\n###  Background, Problem, Advice\n\nSurprisingly, the type of spread for which I found the most examples was\nneither of the ones that first sprang to mind ( Temporal or Levels of Being ).\nInstead it was the “Background, Problem, Advice” type. Spreads of this kind\nfirst give an overview of the current situation, then they talk about the\nspecific challenge or problem the querent faces, and lastly they discuss how\nto address that challenge or problem.\n\nAn example of this type of spread is one for getting or improving a\nrelationship that was once described to me by Rev. Jennifer Elizabeth Moore\n[[13]](text00000.html#_edn13) . The first card addresses the underlying\ndynamics of the querent’s relationships. The next card talks about the\nquerent’s patterns of resistance to relationships. The last card presents the\nmost effective way to find a new relationship or to improve the querent’s\ncurrent relationship—whichever is the relevant area of concern.\n\n###  Progression Spreads\n\nAnother class of three-card spreads is the type that I call Progression\nSpreads. These start with a particular concept and either expand it or\ncontract it. Probably the most obvious example begins with the querent’s self\nand expands upon that. This spread describes the Personal (self),\nInterpersonal (relationships), and Transpersonal (humanity/moral) aspects of\nthe querent’s life. A variant of that is the Emotional, Social, Spiritual\nspread.\n\nMoving in the other direction (contracting) is the Life Purpose spread that I\nheard about from Sherryl Smith on an online Tarot discussion list. To use this\ninteresting spread you first divide the deck into three parts: Major Arcana\ncards, Court cards, and the numbered cards. The first card, drawn from the\nMajor Arcana, describes the soulful work the Universe wants the querent to do\nat this time. The next card, drawn from the Court cards, depicts the personal\nqualities needed for this work. The last card, a Pip card, shows what action\nis required to actualize the message of the Major Arcana card. Thus, in this\nspread the progression is from the general to the specific.\n\n###  Yes/No Spreads\n\nOne might think that Yes/No questions would lend themselves best to one or\ntwo-card readings. However, I’ve found several excellent three-card Yes/No\nspreads, which all incorporate some sort of a “maybe” option.\n\nMany of these spreads require you to count cards, usually either “positive”\nvs. “negative” cards or reversed vs. upright cards. For example, three upright\ncards means Yes, while three reversed cards means No. Two upright: Maybe Yes,\nand Two reversed: Maybe No.\n\nMy favorite of this sort, since it lends itself well to advice as well as to a\nYes/No answer, is based on one that I learned from John Gilbert, former\npresident of the American Tarot Association. For this one, the three cards\nsay, respectively, “Yes if...” “No if...” and “Maybe if...” In other words,\nthey indicate the conditions under which the answer would be Yes or No, while\nthe “Maybe” card can indicate a decision to be made or an action to be taken\nin order for the querent to get what she wants.\n\n###  Choice Spreads\n\nThere are various Choice Spreads that are effective for addressing questions\nlike, “Should I do this or that?” The most common of the three-card choice\nspreads relate the first card to “choice A,” assigning to it a meaning such as\nthe benefits, disadvantages, or potential outcome of that choice. The same\ngoes for the third card if “choice B” is picked. Then the middle card may\npresent a deciding factor, a compromise solution, or a third alternative.\n\nObviously, you can mix and match these assignments, thus creating several\ndifferent spreads. For example, you might create a spread in which you assign\n“potential outcome” to cards one and three, and “deciding factor” to the\nmiddle card. Or you can assign “benefits” to cards one and three, and\n“compromise solution” to the middle card.\n\n###  Sandwich Spreads\n\nThe last type, which I call (with a sly grin) Sandwich Spreads, relates the\nright and left cards to similar concepts while the middle card joins them\nsomehow. (Actually, you could consider the Choice Spreads mentioned above to\nbe a subtype of the Sandwich Spreads, but that group seemed important enough\nto merit its own category.)\n\nFor example, the outside cards (i.e., cards one and three) might indicate the\nquerent on one hand and someone of importance in his life (like a spouse,\nboyfriend, girlfriend, parent, child, etc.) on the other hand. Then the center\ncard could indicate their relationship. Another example is a spread that\ndiscusses where you are right now (card one) versus where you want to be (card\nthree). In that case, the center card might indicate what you need to do to\nget where you want to go or the obstacles that stand in your way.\n\n###  Miscellaneous Spreads\n\nThere are, of course, many three-card spreads that do not fit conveniently\ninto the categories described above. You will find some of these spreads as\nyou read the existing Tarot literature, and others you will discover from\nother Tarot readers. But perhaps the most memorable ones will be those that\nyou develop for a specific reading. Once you have created them, you will find\nthat they are perfect for many occasions.\n\nFor example, I created a spread once when asked to do a reading for a woman\nwhose life seemed bleak as her husband lay dying. She wondered if there were\nany good things coming into her life, so I came up with the following three-\ncard spread, which I thought would be helpful for her:\n\n1. The blessings you bring into your own life\n\n2. The blessings that others around you bring into your life\n\n3. Blessings that the Universe is bringing to you\n\nI have found that this spread can work well in situations where a querent\nneeds hope and encouragement in the midst of dire problems. A spread like this\ncan help because although the querent’s problem itself may be beyond her\ncontrol, she does have power over how she copes with those problems and how\nshe views herself and her circumstances. So this spread seeks to show how the\nquerent’s glass is half full rather than focusing on how it is half empty.\n\nAnother spread that I created, and which seems to defy categorization, is one\nthat works well for general “What does the future hold?” type of questions.\n\n1. Focusing card (What the reading is about)\n\n2. Where your current path is leading you\n\n3. An alternate course of action\n\nFinally, the Story Spread is a very different sort of three-card spread that I\nlearned from Robert Place. [[14]](text00000.html#_edn14) This spread uses the\nmetaphor that each card represents a word or phrase in the sentence created by\nthe three cards taken together. Thus the seventy-eight Tarot cards, when\ncombined in groups of three, can create almost half a million different\n“sentences.”\n\n![E Coins 12 Knight 33pct.jpg](Image00007.jpg)\n\nIn this spread, the middle card functions as the verb of the sentence, and as\nsuch, it establishes the direction in which to read the trio of cards. For\nexample, if the middle card is the Knight of Pentacles, you would read from\nleft to right because the Knight faces to the right in the card image. With\nother cards, such as the Wheel of Fortune, the flow seems to emanate from the\ncenter toward the flanking cards, and in other cases, the central card\nprovides advice about the cards to either side of it. The Magician is an\nexample of such an instructional card. (For more information about this\ncomplex and powerful spread, I refer you to Robert Place’s books noted above.)\n\nNote that this spread works well with decks that have pictorial images on all\nthe cards, such as the various RWS decks and variants of it. However, decks\nsuch as the Tarot de Marseilles, which have only suit symbols on the pip\ncards, are ill suited for storytelling. And with decks that use complex\nimages, such as the Voyager Deck, it would be hard to get a sense of flow from\nthe cards.\n\n###  Conclusions\n\nFinally, I realize that the categorizations presented in this chapter are\nsomewhat arbitrary. For example, Mary Greer’s Thesis/Antithesis/Synthesis\nspread, described as a “Temporal Spread,” might also fit into the “Background,\nProblem, Advice” category. However, as is the case with most classification\nsystems, this one attempts to provide insights and to facilitate\nunderstanding, not confine it.\n\nAlso, I have discovered and developed more three-card spreads than I have\ndiscussed here , but these examples should give you a fairly comprehensive\noverview. You can use the spreads presented here in your Tarot readings, or\nyou can use them as a springboard to create your own.\n\nAfter you have worked extensively with three-card spreads, what you have\nlearned from using them will make larger spreads easier to deal with as well.\nMost of the concepts you learn through using three-card spreads are applicable\nto larger spreads as well. Whatever the size of the spread—three cards or\nseventy-eight—you must apply the cards’ meanings in the context of their\npositions. You also will find that the cards will interact, i.e., affect and\ninfluence each other’s meanings, in spreads both large and small. This aspect\nof reading the cards is illustrated often in the readings in this book. And\nsignificantly, the reading of larger spreads, such as the ten-card Celtic\nCross, can be approached (at least to some extent) as the interpretation of\nseveral two or three card clusters or “sub-spreads.”\n\n  \nChapter 7\n\n##  Putting it All Together\n\nThe preceding chapters discussed a variety of fundamental skills, tools, and\ntechniques that can help a beginning Tarot student read Tarot cards. Various\nways of discovering meanings for each of the seventy-eight Tarot cards,\nwhether reversed or upright, were presented, along with suggestions as to how\nto phrase the question for a reading and a variety of three-card spreads.\nThese are all valuable pieces of the Tarot puzzle, but pulling them all\ntogether in order to arrive at a meaningful Tarot reading still can be a\ndaunting task.\n\nThis chapter will explain how to use these various skills, tools, and\ntechniques in order to do a Tarot reading. There is one important caveat about\nthe philosophy that underlies this explanation, however. The method I use for\ndoing Tarot readings depends upon there being interaction between the querent\nand me, the reader. Some Tarot readers have a style that minimizes or even\navoids such interaction. This, too, is a valid way to read Tarot cards, but it\nrelies upon a rare level of psychic ability that I cannot assume my audience\npossesses, and I leave it to other books and teachers to explain and present\nit.\n\n###  Listen to the Querent\n\nThe essential components of a Tarot reading are the cards, the reader, and the\nquerent. The importance of the first two, the cards and the reader, is\nobvious. What many people fail to appreciate is the value of the input of the\nthird component, the querent.\n\nThe first step in doing a meaningful Tarot reading is to listen to the\nquerent. Not only is she the reason for doing the reading, but also sometimes\nit can be her input that enables you, the reader, to make sense of the\nmessages in the cards. This is because she can provide the background for the\nreading and the context in which the cards can be best interpreted. This input\nis often the crucial element that sheds light on the meaning of a baffling\ncard or that ties together the meanings of several cards in order to bring\nunderstanding to a puzzling reading.\n\nThere are some who say that talking to the querent and asking her questions is\ncheating; that in so doing you aren’t really reading the cards. In truth,\nhowever, there is a lot more to reading Tarot cards than just relaying the\nmessages in them. The whole process is more complicated and involved than\nthat, and establishing a rapport with the querent is an important step in the\nprocess of doing a reading.\n\nThe first cooperative effort that you and the querent undertake is determining\nwhat the question for the reading should be. This topic was explored in depth\nin chapter 5, Rephrasing the Question , but in brief summary, the most helpful\ntype of questions are the ones that focus attention on the querent, assume\nthat she is responsible for her own decisions and actions, and seek to empower\nher to create the destiny she wants.\n\n###  Choose the Spread and the Deck\n\nNext, you need to determine what spread you want to use for the reading, and\none of the most important factors in making that decision is the type of\nquestion being asked.  Chapter 6, Three-Card Spreads , discusses what kinds of\nthree-card spreads are best suited to various types of questions, and similar\nconsiderations apply to any larger spreads that you may want to use.\n(Unfortunately, an extensive examination of larger spreads is beyond the scope\nof this book. [[15]](text00000.html#_edn15) ) Through your study of the wide\nvariety of spreads available and your subsequent experience with them, you\nwill come to a good understanding of the types of questions for which they are\nbest suited.\n\nHow much time you have for the reading is another consideration in selecting a\nspread. Even an experienced Tarot reader could be hard pressed to do justice\nto a reading using the ten-card Celtic Cross spread if he had only ten minutes\nfor the reading. On the other hand, if you have a lot of time (for example, an\nhour) and you are willing and able to go into a lot of depth in a reading, you\nwould probably prefer a spread like the Celtic Cross over one of the simpler\nthree-card spreads I described in Chapter 6.\n\nIn addition to choosing a spread, you also must pick which deck you want to\nuse. For those Tarot readers who have only one deck, this is an easy step,\nwhile for those who have quite a few decks it can be quite a dilemma.\nTypically, this is a very intuitive process, based upon what deck feels right\nfor the reading. However, experience will show you which decks seem best\nsuited to which types of questions and which kinds of querents.\n\n###  Shuffle and Deal the Cards\n\nNow that you have a question in mind, a deck in your hands, and are ready to\nuse a specific spread, the next step is to shuffle and deal the cards. There\nare a variety of ways to shuffle the cards and no hard-and-fast rules for\ndoing so. Whatever works for you is okay. You can even dump them out on the\ntable in a heap and swirl them around if you want to. I usually caution\nstudents against shuffling their cards in any way that bends them unduly,\nhowever, since that wears them out quickly. Even so, if you want to riffle\nyour deck like a Las Vegas card shark, that is entirely up to you.\n\nShould you cut the deck before dealing the cards? That is up to you as well.\nBut if you do so, it is advisable to cut with your non-dominant hand. In other\nwords, if you are right-handed, cut with your left hand.\n[[16]](text00000.html#_edn16)\n\nThere are a variety of ways of selecting cards for a reading, and it is a good\nidea to make this selection with your non-dominant hand as well. The most\ncommon way is to deal the cards, one after the other, off the top of the deck,\nbut when working with a three-card spread, I often cut the deck into three\npiles and turn over the top card of each stack to arrive at the three cards\nfor the reading. Another method is to fan the cards so that either you or the\nquerent can pick each card from the fanned deck. You also can shuffle, cut,\nand deal the top card once for each card in the spread.\n\nThis discussion of shuffling, cutting, and dealing begs a question that new\nstudents often ask: Should you ever let someone else touch your cards? It\nseems that every Tarot reader has her own definitive answer to this question.\nSome readers never let anyone else touch their cards, others insist that the\nquerent should shuffle, cut, and deal the cards, and a great many fall\nsomewhere in between.\n\nMy preference is to shuffle the cards myself, and then have the querent cut\nthe deck. If I decide to select the cards by picking them from a fanned deck,\nI usually let the querent pick the cards as well. The main reason I do not\nhave the querent shuffle the deck is that doing this makes some people\nnervous, and so they concentrate on shuffling when I would rather they focus\ntheir attention on their question. Cutting the deck, on the other hand, is a\ntask that is simple enough to require only a minimal amount of concentration,\nand I have never seen a querent fret about whether or not she was doing it\nright.\n\nOnce you have cards dealt into the assigned positions for the spread you are\nusing, the real work—and fun—begins. No matter how much a Tarot student has\nstudied the cards and learned their meanings, the art of applying that\nknowledge to an actual reading can be quite a test of her abilities, since\nevery querent is special, every question is distinct, and every reading is\nunique. This is the challenge, the beauty, and the excitement of reading Tarot\ncards. And this applies to novice and experienced reader alike. Even after\ndoing a thousand readings, a Tarot reader can find new insights into the cards\nand into the process itself as long as she keeps her heart and mind open.\n\nHow, then, does a Tarot reader blend the mainly rational process of learning\nabout the cards and how to use them with the more intuitive process of\napplying that knowledge in a specific reading? It is the primary intent of\nthis book to use sample readings in order to illustrate various ways to meet\nthis challenge. But before launching into those illustrations, this chapter\nwill discuss this process and present various ways in which card meanings\nspecific to an actual reading can be divined.\n\n###  Listen to the Cards\n\nFor each card in a spread, you must determine what it is saying to you in this\nparticular reading. You may have a keyword for it, you may have learned a\nbrief description of its meaning, or you may know a wide variety of possible\nmeanings for it. But whatever you consciously know about a card is only a\nfinger pointing toward its true meaning within a specific reading. Each card\nin a reading has a story to tell—one that it has never told before in exactly\nthe same way—and it is a delicately intuitive process to hear that tale and to\nunderstand what it means.\n\nIn order to hear a card with your intuitive ear, you can begin by observing\nand reacting to the illustration on the card. What does the image say to you\nin and of itself? What is your gut reaction to it? It also can help to recall\nits numerological and elemental meanings, but when you then combine those\nmeanings into a message, do it within the context of the reading.\n\n![C Cups 02 33pct.jpg](Image00008.jpg)\n\nFor example, consider a hypothetical reading wherein the querent has expressed\nuncertainty about where he thinks a troubled relationship is going. Let’s say\nthat the Two of Cups has come up in a position called, “The problem you face.”\nHow can we interpret this card in this position when reading for this\nquestion? After all, the Two of Cups is not usually considered to be a\nproblematic card.\n\nPerhaps our first impression when we see this card is that the man in it seems\nto be accepting a cup from the woman in a very tentative manner. Next we might\nthink about some numerological meanings for the number two and elemental\nmeanings for the suit of Cups, which is related to water.\n[[17]](text00000.html#_edn17) Twos can indicate duality, choices, union,\nbalance, or partnerships, and Cups can be associated with emotions, love,\nrelationships, imagination, empathy, compassion, and intuition.\n\nFrom our calm, receptive state of mind, we may see which of those meanings\nseem appropriate in this situation. Perhaps it feels right in this case to use\n“choice” for the number Two and “feelings and relationships” for Cups. If we\ncombine those meanings, while also keeping in mind our initial reaction to the\ncard, we might say that the querent has ambivalent feelings for his partner\nand is therefore being very tentative about making the choice to enter more\ndeeply into this relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe our initial reaction to the Two of Cups card is that\nthe man is reaching out to the woman, but she is holding the cup tightly,\nunwilling to relinquish it. Considering that Twos can mean balance and Cups\ncan indicate relationships, this card might be saying that the problem is that\nthe querent feels that there needs to be a better balance in this\nrelationship, that he seems to be putting more into it than is his partner,\nwho seems to be holding back a bit.\n\nAlthough the same process was used in both cases, this card ended up saying\ntwo very different things, depending on what our initial reaction to it was\nand what numerological and elemental keywords or meanings came to mind. As may\nbe surmised, this is an intuitive process.\n\nWhat was also important in finding the appropriate meaning for the Two of Cups\nwas the fact that we were trying to see how this card could be a problem in\nthe querent’s relationship. If this card had been in a position called, “What\ncan help you overcome your problem,” or if this had been a reading about the\nquerent’s career, our interpretation would have been very different.\n\nThere are many other ways besides the one described above that can help a\nreader sift through the wide range of meanings for each card in order to\narrive at an interpretation that suits the circumstances of the reading. If\nyou have accumulated several keywords or meanings for your cards, you can\nmentally thumb through them until one strikes a chord within you. This method\nis quick, easy, and surprisingly effective. In fact, it is one that I commonly\nuse when I am teaching new Tarot students. Often when I am helping a student\ndo a reading and a card comes up that seems puzzling, I start listing possible\nmeanings for it. Usually something I say clicks for the student, and her\neyebrows shoot up in recognition as she gets a vivid “Oh, now I get it!” look\non her face.\n\nYou also can consider what symbol on a card catches your eye when you first\nlook at it. Think about what that symbol means to you, then focus on how the\nmeaning of that symbol affects the message of the card, and vice versa.\n[[18]](text00000.html#_edn18) For example, returning to the Two of Cups, we\nmight focus initially on the winged heart rising above the two people. This\nsymbol may suggest that love lifts us up out of our petty egoistic concerns.\n\nAnother simple, but effective, method for hearing what a card has to say in\nthe particular circumstances of a reading is to pay attention to whatever\nmessage pops into your head when you look at a card. For example, if the Three\nof Swords turns up, the words “cut to the heart of the matter” may come to\nmind.\n\nPerhaps you will understand what that means within the context of this\nreading, but maybe you will not. It may ring a bell for the querent, and it\nmay not. It does not matter. If something jumps into your head, say it. Of\ncourse, you should express a card’s message as tactfully and with as much\nconsideration as possible, but the point is that you should not second guess\nyour intuition. The relevance of the message may become clear later on in the\nreading, or it may not mean anything to the querent until days later when its\nmeaning may dawn on her suddenly and unexpectedly. Of course, it could be a\nfalse alarm, but if you let your conscious mind censor the instinctive\nmessages you get, you will end up stifling your intuition. Thus, you will miss\nsome of the more valuable pearls of wisdom that a Tarot reading has to offer.\n\nSomething else to watch out for in a reading is a peculiar phenomenon that I\ncall a “literalism.” This is an image on a card that bears a strikingly\nliteral resemblance to something about the querent, his situation, or the\nquestion for the reading. (Examples of literalisms can be found in some of the\nreadings in this book, such as the reading for Cinderella.)\n\nAlthough at first glance it may seem that a literalism is merely a curiosity,\nI often find such an occurrence to be particularly useful in a reading. It can\nmake or illustrate an important point, and sometimes it may send a frisson of\nexcitement up the querent’s spine, which can help instill confidence in her.\nOr it simply may make the reading more stimulating, thereby enlivening it\nwhile the other, less flashy, aspects of the reading do the lion’s share of\nthe work. In any particular case let your intuition and experienced judgment\nshow you how useful a literalism is, and thus, whether or not you want to\npoint it out to the querent.\n\nFinally, never hesitate to interact with the querent as you do a reading, for\na discussion about the meaning of a perplexing card can often lead to valuable\ninsights about its message. After all, the querent is the one closest to the\nsubject of a reading, and while he may not be consciously aware of the answers\nto his questions, they usually are buried deep inside him, just waiting to be\nrevealed.\n\nOne way to allow such wisdom to reveal itself during a reading is to have the\nquerent describe a card. You can ask him to describe its physical details or\nexplain what the figures in the card are doing, thinking, or feeling. You may\nwant him to recount a history of how the situation depicted in the card came\nto be, or predict what will happen next to the characters in the card. In any\ncase, listen carefully to him relate what he sees happening in the card, and\npay close attention to anything that is relevant to the subject of the\nreading. In the seemingly innocuous process of talking about a Tarot card, a\nquerent will often reveal precious truths about himself, about his situation,\nand about the solution to his problems. Ironically, these usually are truths\nthat he did not realize he knew.\n\n###  Conclude and Summarize the Reading\n\nAt the end of a reading it is important to summarize its meaning and\nsignificance based upon the messages of each of the cards, and to bring it to\na satisfactory conclusion. Were there predictions, warnings, or advice that\nstood out powerfully as you read the cards? These highlights may bear\nrepeating. Was there a unified tale that the cards told when you considered\nthem all together? When you string together the messages from each of the\ncards, you’ll often find such an overarching message for the entire reading.\n\nSometimes a querent will nod politely all during a reading while you explain\nwhat you see in the cards, even though he has not understood all that you have\nsaid. He may not comprehend what some of the cards mean, or he may have\ntrouble seeing how they relate to his question. Knowing that this can be the\ncase, I conclude my Tarot readings by asking the querent if he has any\nquestions about the meaning of any of the cards or about the reading in\ngeneral. And I always ask if the reading has answered his question and if it\nhas helped him.\n\n###  Journal the Reading\n\nAfter you have completed a reading, you may want to record its highlights.\nIndeed, a good way to improve your ability to do Tarot readings is to keep a\njournal of the readings you do—or at least of the one you do for yourself. In\na journal like this, you will want to keep the following information:\n\n  1. The date of the reading\n  2. The question for which the reading was done\n  3. The spread that was used\n  4. The cards that were dealt for each position in the spread\n  5. Interpretations for each of the cards\n  6. A summary of the message of the reading\n\nIf you keep a journal like this, you can look back at these readings anywhere\nfrom a few months to a year or more later in order to see what you may have\nmissed or misinterpreted the first time around. With the benefit of hindsight,\nyou can discover a great deal about how you could have improved a reading,\nwhich can help you in future readings. If any guidance was provided in the\nreading, you may want to consider if it was appropriate and helpful.\nSimilarly, were warnings in the reading accurate? Also, can you now see better\ninterpretations for any of the cards?\n\n###  See the Magic\n\nThis chapter has outlined and explained the basic steps involved in doing a\nTarot reading. There is, however, an even more fundamental aspect of working\nwith Tarot cards that needs to be mentioned, something that goes beyond the\nmere procedural steps involved in doing a reading. This is something that I\ntry to impress upon students in my Tarot classes when they ask me questions\nlike, “I heard that I have to keep my cards wrapped in silk, is that true?”\n“Do I have to carry my cards around with me at all times?” “Do you ever let\nanyone else touch your cards?” Such questions are based on an assumption,\nwhether the students are conscious of it or not, that the cards are magical in\nand of themselves, and that they must be treated and cared for in specific,\narcane ways in order to access their magic. But how accurate is that\nassumption?\n\nTrue, you should treat your cards with respect, just as any artist or artisan\ntreats the tools of her trade with respect. Treating them with care and\nconsideration will protect them so that they can serve you well, and your\nrespect for them is a reflection of how much you value what you do with them.\nHowever, there is no “right” way to store your cards, except with care. There\nis no requirement to keep your cards with you at all times, except, perhaps,\nwithin your heart. And while I know of people who never let anyone else touch\ntheir Tarot cards, I have no problem letting someone else handle my cards, as\nlong as they too handle them carefully.\n\nAnd so the basic message that I try to convey to my students is that a deck of\nTarot cards is a tool that you should treat with respect. The real magic,\nhowever, lies within you.\n\n  \nChapter 8\n\n##  Ethical Considerations\n\nIf you plan to read Tarot cards for profit, it is important that you consider\nwriting up a code of ethics for your Tarot practice. But even if you do not\nintend to read for anyone other than friends and family, it is a good idea at\nleast to consider this topic, since doing so will impel you to think about\nethical issues related to doing Tarot readings.\n\nIf you never think about this subject, someday you will find yourself making\nethical decisions in the heat of the moment. Such snap decisions usually fall\nvictim to the petty dictates of expedience and short-term self-interest. They\nrarely reflect the values of your higher self or of an enlightened sense of\npurpose. But isn’t reading Tarot cards enough of a soulful practice that you\nshould give your decisions about it careful consideration?\n\nIf you spend a little time and effort writing up your code of Tarot ethics, it\nwill be written down for future reference, both on paper and in the back of\nyour mind. The act of writing it will embed it into your consciousness and\nenable you to refer back to it should ever you forget it. It will also make it\navailable to show anyone for whom you are doing a reading.\n\nAgain, if you do not plan to read professionally, this may not be such an\nimportant issue, but a written code of ethics will help you set boundaries as\nto what you will and will not do in a Tarot reading. While we may not be able\nto lay down universal rules applicable to everyone and every situation, what\nfollows are some ideas that you might want to consider in order to decide how\nyou feel about the ethics of your Tarot practice. These issues include such\nthings as privacy, accuracy, honesty, integrity, and responsibility.\n\nThe issue of privacy deals with both the querent’s confidentiality and the\nprivacy of anyone not present for the reading. The first issue is relatively\nstraightforward. Would you ever reveal what you have learned about someone in\nthe course of doing a reading for him? Under what circumstances would it be\nethical to do so? Idle gossip is obviously unethical, but what if the safety\nor well being of the querent or someone else is at stake? Would you then\nreveal what you learned during a Tarot reading?\n\nThe privacy of someone not present for a reading is a topic on which there are\nstrongly divergent opinions. The question of doing a reading to peer into the\nlife of someone else was touched upon in chapter 5, Rephrasing the Question ,\nbut further discussion on this ethical issue is in order here.\n\nSome Tarot readers feel that if we want to be helpful to a querent, we\nsometimes have to read for questions like, “Is my husband cheating on me?”\nWhile that position has merit, we should also consider where to draw the line\nwith questions that seek to examine the thoughts or actions of anyone not\npresent for the reading. How far into the business of others dare we try to\npeek? Is it always okay to try to ferret out someone else’s secrets? Is it\never okay? And are we wise enough to know when it is okay and when it is not?\nEach of us has to look deeply into our conscience to decide how to deal with\nthis issue.\n\nMy decision has been to avoid doing readings with the intention of finding out\nthe thoughts or actions of anyone who has not given their permission for such\nan examination, which typically is anyone not present for the reading. When I\ndo a reading that involves other people (such as relationship readings) I keep\nmy intention on finding higher truths about the relationship and on trying to\nhave the reading be a benefit and a blessing for everyone involved.\n\nThus, for example, if a querent asks what her boyfriend might be doing behind\nher back, I try to rephrase the question to focus it on what she needs to know\nabout her relationship with him. I may include in the spread a position such\nas, “What do you need to know about your boyfriend?” but I am leaving it up to\na higher source to bring us whatever answers may be fair for us to know.\n\nThe issue of accuracy is a bit less thorny. Do you feel you are 100 percent\naccurate in your readings? If so, would you feel comfortable telling people\nthat? If not, are you comfortable telling someone that you may be wrong? If\nyou cannot tell what one of the cards in a spread is saying, are you able to\nsay, “I don’t understand what this card means here.”\n\nWe allow almost everyone space to make mistakes. If the weatherman says it\nwill rain tomorrow, but it does not, do we call him a fraud and stop watching\nthe weather report? If our doctor says we need surgery, do we just assume she\nmust be right, or might we get a second opinion? And if that second opinion\ncontradicts the first one, do we assume that one of the doctors is a quack? No\none is perfect, but for some reason, there are quite a few people who feel\nthat if a Tarot reader is not 100 percent accurate, then he must be a fraud.\n\nEven though the Universe, speaking through the cards, never lies, we, being\nmere mortals, are not perfect, and we can make mistakes interpreting the\nmessages of the cards. If we won’t admit that, how can we expect anyone else\nto realize it? So giving ourselves permission to make mistakes or not to know\nsomething relieves us of the stress of having to be perfect, and without that\nstress we can relax and give a better reading.\n\nRealizing and admitting to your limitations is a rather straightforward aspect\nof honesty in a Tarot reading. A more complicated one lies in balancing\nhonesty versus compassion and understanding. In other words, does exercising\ntact compromise your honesty? For most of us, this is not a simple yes-or-no\nquestion. Rather, it tends to lie somewhere in a gray area in between. With a\nbit of soul searching we can find where that is, but we all have to make that\ndetermination for ourselves.\n\nProviding hope in a reading is another issue on which there is a divergence of\nopinions. Do you believe that in any situation there is always hope, even if\nonly a glimmer? If so, you may determine to try to find that ray of hope in\nevery reading, no matter how dire. Is that honest, or is it whitewashing the\ntruth? Some say that compassion requires severe honesty, while others feel\nthat it is quite ethical to find what hope there may be in a reading in order\nto provide it to those who need it the most. I do not, of course, advise lying\nto a querent or painting a rosy picture over a bleak outcome, but I do find it\nimportant to try to make a reading a blessing to whatever extent is possible.\nAgain, this is a difficult issue to pin down, and it bears careful\nconsideration.\n\nAnother issue to think about is that of responsibility. We have already talked\nabout the responsibility of the reader, but what about the querent? Should a\nTarot reader make the assumption that ultimately the querent is responsible\nfor her own decisions and her own life? If you assume this, it will affect the\nway you work with the querent to phrase the question for a reading, the way\nyou conduct the reading, and how you feel after it is over.\n\nA related question is how dependent upon your services are you willing to let\npeople become? Although it might improve my income to let people come for\nreadings as often as they want, I am opposed to having a querent become so\ndependent upon Tarot readings that he has to have one every time he faces a\nproblem or a decision. But how often is too often? Once a week? Once a month?\nOnce a year? Different Tarot readers set different standards, but I usually\ntell a querent that unless there has been a major change in his life, I would\nrather he not come for a reading more than once every few months.\n\nWhether or not you should charge for your Tarot readings is another topic that\ncan generate a lively debate. Some claim that being able to read Tarot cards\nis a gift, and as such should be given back to the universe, not sold. Others\nmaintain that any talent, such as singing, painting, or dancing, is a gift,\nand that reading Tarot cards, like any other gift, requires training to\ndevelop and takes effort to do, and consequently, it deserves compensation. A\ndetailed philosophical discourse on this subject is beyond the scope of this\nbook, so I will just suggest that if you do charge for your readings, be\nreasonable, honest, and scrupulous about what you can do and about how much\nyou charge for your services.\n\nThe final point I would urge you to consider is one that goes beyond ethics\nand into the realm of legalities. As noted in chapter 5, Rephrasing the\nQuestion , a Tarot reader has to be very careful to stick to her own area of\nexpertise (reading Tarot cards) and to avoid giving advice outside that realm.\nThis requires constant vigilance, because people often want a Tarot reading to\nanswer questions that are, by nature, medical, legal, financial, etc. Not only\nis it unethical to presume to answer such questions, but if you are reading\nfor the general public, it can be illegal as well.\n\nWhat follows is a statement of my Tarot Ethics. I share it here not only as a\ntemplate that others must use, but also as an example of how one person has\ndecided to deal with questions of ethical conduct in reading Tarot cards. Take\nfrom it what you will. It is not necessary that you agree with my code of\nethics, but it is important that you give careful consideration to your own.\n\n  \nMy Tarot Ethics\n\n1. Confidentiality:\n\nI will not reveal what a client tells me without his or her explicit approval.\nI will hold all written and verbal communication with a client in confidence,\nexcept in the event of a life-threatening situation.\n\n2. Honesty:\n\nI will interpret a reading to the best of my ability and will honestly admit\nwhen I can’t interpret something. I will always tell the truth, but will not\nimpose information on a client that they have clearly indicated that they do\nnot wish to discuss or explore in further detail.\n\n3. Consideration:\n\nI will always provide readings with compassion and in a considerate and\nnonjudgmental manner.\n\n4. Expertise:\n\nI will not give advice in areas for which I am not qualified. If the client\nneeds a physician, psychologist, lawyer, financial advisor, accountant, or any\nother professional service for which I am not qualified, I will encourage him\nor her to seek such service from someone who is qualified in that area, and I\nwill make appropriate referrals wherever possible.\n\n5. Responsibility:\n\nMy goal as a Tarot reader is to help my clients take responsibility for their\nown decisions and actions, and act according to their own conscience for the\ngreater good of all concerned.\n\n6. Empowerment:\n\nI will let my clients know that the future is never etched in stone and thus\nthat they always have the power to change their future. I will strive to help\nmy clients leave a reading feeling empowered to make practical, life-affirming\ndecisions.\n\n7. Healing:\n\nI will allow myself to be a conduit through which Divine Spirit heals my\nclients’ spirit, mind, body, and environment based upon insights gained from a\nreading.\n\n8. Uplifting:\n\nI will strive to make each reading a blessing for everyone involved. I will be\nencouraging and try to leave my clients with a sense of renewed strength and\nhope, and to conclude each reading, no matter how bad it might initially\nappear, on a positive, uplifting note.\n\n9. Independence:\n\nI will not let my clients become dependent upon my services, nor pressure them\nfor return visits.\n\n10. Payment:\n\nI will not accept payment unless my client is satisfied with the reading.  I\nreserve the right to refuse to read for any client, but I will return any\ncompensation for such a reading.\n\n11. Professional conduct:\n\nSince the future is always mutable, I will never scare a client by predicting\na physical death.\n\nI will not do a reading to see what someone other than my client is doing or\nfeeling.\n\nI will at all times maintain an ethical and professional relationship with my\nclients.\n\nI will not abuse a client's trust and vulnerability for my own personal\nbenefit.\n\nI will endeavor to study those subjects that will advance my own professional\ndevelopment and aid me in giving better readings.\n\nI will not refer clients to another professional reader in anticipation of\nacquiring kickbacks or other compensation.\n\nI will treat my professional colleagues with respect.\n\n  \n\n#  Section 3 :  \nSample Three-Card Readings\n\n  \n\nAs I tried to decide how many “Ask KnightHawk” readings to include in this\nbook, several numbers came to mind. Seventy-eight—one for each card in a Tarot\ndeck—was an obvious choice, but it would have made this book far too long for\npractical purposes. The next obvious choice was twenty-two, the number of\nMajor Arcana cards, and that is the number upon which I settled.\n\nFor the most part, I have ordered the three-card readings that appear in this\nbook based upon a Major Arcana card that appears in them. Readings that had\nmore than one Major Arcana card required that I choose one of them to serve as\nthe “placement” card. However, I did not have a viable reading for every one\nof the twenty-two Major Arcana cards. For each of those un-represented cards,\nI used a reading for someone who characterized in some way the missing card or\nfor which there was a thematic correspondence between the reading and the\ncard.\n\nFor the High Priestess, I used the reading I had done for Gertrude Stein, who\nI see as typifying the insight of that card. Since Aristotle is one of\nhistory’s best-known teachers, I used his reading for the Hierophant. In the\ncase of the Lovers card, I chose a reading for Dr. Jekyll. That card is\ncommonly associated with the astrological sign of Gemini, the Twins, and the\nstory of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde deals with the good and evil twins within us\nand with the archetypal choice we must make between them. Finally, Lady\nMacbeth is perhaps best known for her crazed “Out, damned spot!” soliloquy, so\nby virtue of her fabled lunacy, I chose to use her reading for the Moon.\n\nThus, this section is composed of twenty-two readings numbered 0 through 21,\njust as the Major Arcana cards are typically numbered. The chapter titles are\ngenerally the headlines I used for the “Ask KnightHawk” columns from which the\nrespective readings originally appeared. After each reading I have provided\ncomments about the challenges it presented, noteworthy observations about it,\nand things I learned in the process of doing it.\n\nI would like to make one final point before launching into these three-card\nreadings, and that concerns their brevity. These readings are intended to\ndemonstrate the art of doing Tarot readings, but they are not intended to\nconvince the reader to use three-card spreads exclusively. I generally use\nthem when I want to do a quick reading, such as when I do readings at a party.\nOtherwise I tend to use larger spreads, such as the Celtic Cross, which you\nwill see in the next section of this book, or one of the many spreads to be\nfound in my book Tarot: Get the Whole Story . That said, however, a three-card\nspread can result in a lengthy reading if it leads to a dialogue that delves\ndeeply into the nuances of the cards. Obviously, however, such a conversation\nwas not possible in the case of these readings with their imaginary querents.\n\n  \nReading 0\n\n##  Beauty Hopes to Find Mercy in the Beast\n\nDear Sir KnightHawk,\n\nMy beloved father chanced to offend a horrible beast that lives in an\nenchanted castle. The beast almost killed my father, but at the last minute it\nlet him escape with his life, but only on condition that he either return to\nmeet his fate or send one of his three daughters in his stead. Thus I have\nresolved myself to go in his place.\n\nMy question is this: What is to become of me there? Will I be killed and\ndevoured by this monster? Or will his heart belie his fierce appearance and\nguide him to be merciful to me?\n\nWith great affection,  \nBeauty\n\n***\n\nDear Beauty,\n\nI am honored that you have sought my counsel in this grim matter you face. But\nrather than just try to see what will happen to you—for you have within you\nthe power to affect your fate and change your future—I have asked the cards to\nshow us how you can best deal with your pending circumstances. Here is the\nthree-card spread I have dealt for your question:\n\n1. What you need to know about the situation you face:   \nSeven of Swords\n\n2. What you can do about it:   \nThe Fool\n\n3. The probable outcome:   \nSix of Wands reversed\n\n![D Swords 07 33pct.jpg](Image00009.jpg) ![A Major 00 Fool\n33pct.JPG](Image00010.jpg) ![B Wands 06 Rx.jpg](Image00011.jpg)\n\nThe Seven of Swords is a card that can indicate deception, and so it seems\nthat this beast is not what he appears to be. Also, for some reason, he is not\nwilling to reveal the truth about himself either. Perhaps he thinks that he\nneeds to trick you in order to get what he wants. Therefore, considering what\nyou have said about this situation, I doubt that he plans to kill you, for he\nwould hardly need guile to do that.\n\nThe Fool card urges you to take a leap of faith here. You have decided to\nundertake a course of action, the consequences of which you cannot know, and\nthis card advises you to go ahead with it. However, it urges you to do so with\ninnocence and with purity of heart.\n\nThe Six of Wands is a card of victory, but in the reversed position it\nindicates that your victory will not come quickly or easily. At this time, you\nmay not have the self-confidence depicted in this card, and understandably so.\nBut when you do find this quality within yourself, you will be able to find\nthe victory that this card promises.\n\nAgain, thank you for letting me read for you. I hope this helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nIn this reading, I have interpreted the Seven of Swords as meaning\n“deception,” both in form and action, but this card has other meanings besides\nthat one, meanings like treachery, mischief, and stealth. Indeed, the\nvariations and shades of meanings for all the Tarot cards could fill a book—in\nfact, I have a shelf filled with such books—and finding just the right meaning\nfor any given situation is perhaps the greatest challenge we face when doing a\nreading. So how should we sift through them all to find the right one? Our\nintuition, of course, should be our guiding light, but often the adjoining\ncards can point the way along this intuitive path.\n\nIn this case, the Seven of Swords sits next to the Fool, which often deals\nwith innocence and guilelessness. Consequently, I saw that trust was a big\nissue here, which led me to see deception in the Seven of Swords. Also,\nconsidering the word “fool” in the sense of “to fool someone” lent weight to\nthis choice.\n\nFor an interpretation of the Fool card itself, I began with a general meaning\nof “a leap of faith,” and also considered that this card implies innocence and\n“purity of heart” when seen as our essential soul being here on Earth to\nexperience life. Then, drawing upon the symbolism of the horse in the Six of\nWands, I deduced that the beast would most likely place himself in a\nsubservient position to Beauty instead of killing her.\n\nI would like to add an interesting observation here about the Fool card and\nhow I saw it relating to this story. There is a theory that the Greco-Roman\nmyth of Cupid and Psyche (which inspired Reading 3, The Ultimate Lost Love )\nevolved through the centuries into the folk tale we now call Beauty and the\nBeast, and indeed there are definitely striking similarities between the two.\n[[19]](text00000.html#_edn19) In that earlier myth, the way that Psyche was\ntransported to Eros’s enchanted mansion was by leaping off a cliff and being\ncarried away by Zephyrus, the West Wind. This was, in fact, a leap of faith\nsimilar to the one that the Fool himself is poised to make.\n\nLastly, you may wonder about the inconsistencies between the popular Disney\nversion of this tale and the story related here. For example, in Disney’s\nBeauty and the Beast , Beauty has no sisters. Also, in the version used for\nthis reading there was an apparent lack of singing and dancing house wares in\nthe beast’s castle. The explanation is that I have used as my source the\neighteenth century version of this story as told by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de\nBeaumont.\n\n  \nReading 1\n\n##  Looking for Mr. Right\n\nDear Sir KnightHawk,\n\nHow can I ever hope to find Mr. Right when I’m stuck here at home doing all\nthe chores? My stepsisters get to go to balls where they can meet eligible\nbachelors, but I am not allowed to go to such events. What am I to do?\n\nSincerely,  \nCinderella\n\n***\n\nDear Cinderella,\n\nThank you for asking me to read the cards for you. To see how you can bring\nMr. Right into your life, I dealt the following three-card spread:\n\n1. The condition of your love life right now:   \nQueen of Cups\n\n2. What you need to know about it:   \nThe Magician\n\n3. What you can do about it:   \nThree of Cups reversed\n\nFirst of all, this is a very auspicious spread in that it contains cards of\nbeauty, power, and joy.\n\n![C Cups 13 Queen 33pct.jpg](Image00012.jpg) ![A Major 01 Mage\n33pct.JPG](Image00013.jpg) ![C Cups 03 Rx.jpg](Image00014.jpg)\n\nAs for the specific messages of the individual cards, let’s begin with the\nQueen of Cups. This card indicates that there is a very wistful, introspective\nquality in your life right now. However, this card also points out that you\nare a loving person with a generous heart. There is a secret greatness in this\nthat may soon become apparent, for these qualities can ultimately help you\nfind your heart’s desire.\n\nOn a mundane level, the Magician card says that you have the skills and\nabilities that you will need to find your Mr. Right. (The previous card\nrevealed what those qualities are.) On a higher level, however, this card\nliterally indicates magic. Thus, it assures you that there will be magic\ncoming into your life, and it will enable you to go to a ball yourself, as\nindicated by the next card.\n\nThe Three of Cups shows you going out and enjoying a party. You may wonder how\nyou will get a chance to do that, but as I just noted, I see the Magician card\nas providing the means. The Three of Cups is reversed, however, and so it\ncautions you to take care not to overindulge when you do party. If you can\nkeep your head and your wits about you, though, you will do well.\n\nFinally, viewed together, these three cards seem to present an encouraging\nscenario for you. They indicate the possibility that a loving woman of grace\nand charm will help you find love by bringing magic into your life, which will\nallow you to enjoy an important social event. The only problem I see here is a\nwarning to be careful about your conduct at that event.\n\nAgain, thank you for letting me read for you, Cinderella. I hope this helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nHaving the Magician card turn up in the middle of a reading for Cinderella was\nquite remarkable. It is an example of the wonder and joy I have experienced\nmany times while doing these KnightHawk readings, which also reflects the\nwonder and joy of my work with Tarot cards in general.\n\nOn a purely visual level, this card is not quite a literalism\n[[20]](text00000.html#_edn20) , but considering the magical nature of\nCinderella’s Fairy Godmother, it does convey a very literal truth on a\nconceptual level. When I saw this card come up in this reading, it seemed as\nthough the Tarot had tossed it into the spread with an impish wink, as if it\nwere saying, “Ask a whimsical question, get a whimsical answer.”\n\nIn my interpretation of the Queen of Cups, I focused mainly on what that card\nhad to say about the querent herself. This card turned up in the position\nindicative of the querent’s current situation, but a person’s situation\nincludes her personality as well as her environment and that which is going on\naround her. So, since I generally see Court Cards as commenting on personality\nissues, I saw this card as an indication that the most important aspect of\nCinderella’s situation was what resided within her, not the conditions in\nwhich she resided. Indeed, it was her loving and supportive nature (i.e., the\nQueen of Cups inside of her) that ultimately determined her fate.\n\nIt was significant, therefore, that the card I dealt in this position was not\none depicting Cinderella’s dire circumstances, such as the Five of Coins or\nthe Eight of Swords, although either of those cards would have been an\nappropriate depiction of what was going on in her life at that time. Being a\nCourt Card instead, the Queen of Cups diverted attention from Cinderella’s\nexternal problems and focused it on what was important for her to consider:\nher emotional and personality strengths. This illustrates how the type of\ncard, in and of itself, can contribute a great deal toward both the card’s\nmessage and the meaning of the reading.\n\n![E Coins 05 33pct.jpg](Image00015.jpg) ![D Swords 08\n33pct.jpg](Image00016.jpg)\n\n  \nReading 2\n\n##  Woman Ponders Move to Paris\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nI am thinking about moving to Paris. Will that be a good move?\n\nSincerely,  \nGertrude Stein\n\n***\n\nDear Ms. Stein,\n\nI want to thank you for requesting this reading. It sounds as if you have not\nyet made up your mind whether or not to make this move. Consequently, I have\ndone a reading to help you understand the forces at work in your life that may\neither help or hinder the success of a move to Paris. Hopefully, this reading\nwill help you make this decision and then show you how to make the most of\nthis move if it is what you choose to do. With such considerations in mind, I\nhave dealt a three-card spread for your question as follows:\n\n  1. Yes if:   \nThe Emperor reversed\n\n  2. No if:   \nJudgment\n\n  3. Maybe if:   \nThe Fool\n\n![A Major 04 Emperor Rx.jpg](Image00017.jpg) ![A Major 20 Judgment\n33pct.jpg](Image00018.jpg) ![A Major 00 Fool 33pct.JPG](Image00010.jpg)\n\nThe first thing I note about this reading is that all three cards are Major\nArcana cards, which indicates that this is an extremely important decision for\nyou. You have reached a pivotal point in your life that will have a profound\neffect on its course and meaning.\n\nThe reversed Emperor says that this will be a good move for you if you need an\nenvironment freer from rigid constraints and with less structure than where\nyou are now. However, this card also indicates that in order to make this move\nwork to your benefit, you also should consider whether or not you can create a\nstable environment of your own there. It will take the inner power of self-\ndiscipline and self-control to do so. If you have these qualities, you will\nfind that this move will be a good one.\n\nThe Judgment card is about hearing a call to a new way of seeing things. It\nalso can be about finding a whole new way of life—a rebirth, so to speak. If\nsuch results are why you want to move to Paris, you may be disappointed. You\nwould do well to closely evaluate your expectations for this move to see if\nthey may be too high. Life in Paris may be a big change from American life,\nbut people are still people everywhere you go, so be sure you do not expect\nParisians to be unusually different or more enlightened than Americans.\n\nThe advice of the Fool card is to follow your instincts in making this\ndecision, for they are good and should be trusted. Also, this card says that\nthis move may be the beginning of a new phase of your life, but to make it so,\nyou need to be able to approach it with a sense of innocence and wonder. You\nneed to be able to trust that the purity of your spirit will be able to guide\nyou and lead you as you seek success and satisfaction in this move.\n\nFinally, I see the three cards in this spread as being representative of\nvarious aspects of yourself that can help you thrive and flourish wherever you\nare—Paris or elsewhere. The Emperor represents your forceful personality,\nJudgment indicates your ability to help people find their path, and the Fool\nis your intrepid sense of adventure. It will be up to you, however, to\ndetermine if Paris is the right place to make the best use of such talents.\n\nAgain, thank you for letting me read for you, Ms. Stein. I hope this reading\nis of assistance to you.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : In 1903 Gertrude Stein moved to Paris where she lived the rest of\nher life. Over the course of the next four decades, she wrote a variety of\nbooks and operas, but her influence on 20th-century culture was also the\nresult of her dynamic personality and her influence on, and encouragement of,\nother writers and artists, such as Ernest Hemingway, Thornton Wilder, Henri\nMatisse, and Pablo Picasso.\n\nComments\n\nStein’s question, “Will that be a good move?” seems to initiate this reading\nwith a call for both a decision and a prediction. However, often such\nquestions are posed casually, with little intent of making such a request. In\nthis case, Stein’s question seems to be more of an appeal for help in making\nher decision, so I did not explicitly rephrase it. Instead, I noted that this\nreading would help her make her own decision, and that it would help her forge\na beneficial future should she decide to make this move. Additionally, the\nspread that I chose is one that is well suited to such purposes.\n\nThe first two positions in the spread for this reading are rather\nstraightforward. The answer to the question for the reading may be either yes\nor no, depending on whether or not certain circumstances apply or if the\nquerent does what the cards indicate. The meaning of the third card, “Maybe\nif,” can be a bit harder to understand. The card in this position is more\nabout what the querent can do to manifest success than about the influences\nalready at work either for or against her success. In addition, it illustrates\nwhat the querent has control over, versus the determining circumstances, pro\nor con, depicted by the first two cards. Thus, the third card in this type of\nspread generally presents the bulk of the advice and guidance of the reading.\n\nAs for the other two positions, let us specifically consider what lessons the\ncards there have to offer. The Emperor illustrates a couple of ways of\ninterpreting reversed cards. Its reversal indicates a need to diminish the\nenergy of this card in the querent’s environment, and it also challenges her\ninternal ability to manifest the Emperor’s attributes.\n\nI generally see the Judgment card as exerting a positive influence in a\nreading, but finding it in the “No if” position presented a type of challenge\nthat often baffles Tarot students: how to interpret a “good” card that turns\nup in a “bad” position.\n\nOne way to deal with the apparent dichotomy of finding a “good” card in a\nproblematic position (or vice versa) is to realize that no card is entirely\ngood or bad; each has a spectrum of meaning.  Another approach, which is the\none used in this reading, is to be flexible as to how you apply the card’s\nmeaning to the reading. In this case, I noted that some highly positive\naspects of this card may indicate an overly optimistic view on the querent’s\npart: “If such results are why you want to move to Paris, you may be\ndisappointed.” This is, of course, a highly intuitive skill, but one that\npractice will hone.\n\nA notable feature of this reading is the fact that it concluded with a marked\nreinterpretation of the spread. In stating, “I see the three cards in this\nspread as being representative of various aspects of yourself that can help\nyou thrive and flourish wherever you are...” I have gone beyond the\nconstraints of the original positional meanings. I took this liberty because\nanother message seemed to leap forth from these three Major Arcana cards.\nIndeed, sometimes we have to trust our instincts when they ask us to step back\nand see the forest as well as the trees. [[21]](text00000.html#_edn21)\n\nHowever, this does not mean that it is okay to ignore or capriciously redefine\nthe positional meanings in a spread if they prove to be inconvenient. If it is\nhard to understand what a card means in the context of its position, let it\nsimmer in your consciousness until it does make sense. Eventually it will;\nthey always do. So, rather than being an excuse to ignore the initial\nparameters of the reading, this method of looking at the cards in a new light\nis a way of finding additional levels of meaning.\n\n  \nReading 3\n\n##  The Ultimate Lost Love\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nHow can I get my husband back? I listened to bad advice from my sisters, who,\nI now see, were jealous of my marriage and wanted to ruin it. Since my husband\nhad only ever come to me in the dark of night, they urged me to light a\nlantern while he slept to see if he was a monster. Well, it turns out he is no\nmonster at all.  In fact, he is Eros, the God of Love himself! When he saw\nwhat I was doing, he rebuked me for my lack of trust and left me. So now I am\ngrief-stricken, and I need to know how I can get him back. Please help me.\n\nLove ,  \nPsyche\n\n***\n\nDear Psyche,\n\nThank you for giving me this opportunity to do a reading for this interesting\nsituation. In order to help you discover what you may do to solve your\nproblem, I have dealt the following three-card spread:\n\n1. What you need to know about the problem you face:   \nWheel of Fortune reversed\n\n2. What you can do about it:   \nNine of Coins reversed\n\n3. Who or what can help you:   \nThe Empress\n\n![A Major 10 Wheel of Fortune Rx.jpg](Image00019.jpg) ![E Coins 09\nRx.jpg](Image00020.jpg) ![A Major 03 Empress 33pct.jpg](Image00021.jpg)\n\nMy first impression for this reading is that although the cards say that your\nroad to success will be difficult, they are very encouraging for your ultimate\nvictory. So now let’s look at the individual cards and what they say.\n\nThe reversed Wheel of Fortune echoes what you have said: your fortunes have\nindeed been reversed. However, remember that this wheel keeps turning. While\nyour sisters have won for now, they may soon suffer losses at least as great\nas yours, while you may yet regain what you have lost—and more—so have courage\nand do not despair.\n\nThe reversed Nine of Coins also acknowledges your loss of fortune, but it\ncounsels you not to focus on that. This card sometimes says that we deserve to\ntake some time to relax after a job well done, but being reversed as it is\nhere, it says that there is a lot of hard work ahead of you before you “relax\nafter a job well done.” Be prepared for that. However, this card also advises\nagainst becoming pessimistic or defeatist about your situation. It urges you\nto develop a &quot;prosperity consciousness,&quot; which will help you\nmanifest the solutions you need, so always remember that you are deserving of\nabundance and success.\n\nThe Empress card is often associated with Venus, which I point out because of\nwho your husband is. [[22]](text00000.html#_edn22) This card suggests that\nperhaps you can go to her for help. On the other hand, this card also refers\nto your own beauty and sensuality, advising you to trust that in the long run\nthose qualities also can help you win back your husband. Lastly, this card\nmakes me wonder if you might be pregnant—and if that fact may help you as\nwell.\n\nAgain, thank you for your question, Psyche. I hope this reading helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : For a beautifully written version of the oft-told tale of “Psyche\nand Eros,” I refer the reader to The First Love Stories , by Diane Wolkstein.\n\nComments\n\nThrough all her misfortunes, it was hope that sustained Psyche, and one might\nwonder where she found such a vast reservoir of hope. Perhaps it was from an\noracular experience like this Tarot reading. Often people come for a Tarot\nreading thinking they want information, but really it is hope they are\nseeking, and sometimes hope is the best part of what a reading has to offer\nthem.\n\nThe reversed Wheel of Fortune clearly reiterated the reversal of Psyche’s\nfortune that she indicated in her question. But every time a card indicates\nhardship and misfortune, there is advice, encouragement, or hope available\nthere too. This attitude may seem a bit Pollyannaish, but really it is a\nreflection of the balance of life, as well as a choice to find a meaningful\nlesson in any experience. In this case, the wheel really does keep turning,\nand today’s misfortune may be a necessary step on the way to tomorrow’s good\nfortune. Merely telling Psyche, “Yes, this card does show how badly your\nfortunes have fallen.” would have done her very little good. As evidenced by\nthe perseverance with which she faced her subsequent trials, it was hope, not\nan awareness of how abysmal her situation was, that sustained her and bore her\nto her eventual triumph.\n\nSimilarly, the reversed Nine of Coins also indicated a loss of fortune. But\nagain, each card has volumes to tell, and this one had advice that was\ndestined to hold Psyche in good stead. The calm attitude of the woman on this\ncard indicates grace and charm, but this card was reversed, so how does that\naffect the message of this card? Instead of indicating that a card’s qualities\nare missing in the querent’s life, a reversed card often says that such\nqualities need to be cultivated. Thus, the emphasis for this card was shifted\nfrom Psyche’s problems to advice on how to overcome those problems.\n\nThere is an interesting footnote that I would like to mention about this\nreading. While there are several cards that are popularly interpreted as\nimplying a pregnancy—such as the Sun or the Queen of Coins—the ultimate\npregnancy card is the Empress. In fact, in many decks the Empress is depicted\nas being in the family way. Of course, knowing this myth in advance, I was\nforearmed with the knowledge that Psyche was with child at the time that this\nreading would have taken place, which made this particular interpretation an\nobvious choice. Nevertheless, I was struck by how very appropriate this card\nwas here—both in its close association with Venus (Psyche’s mother-in-law) and\nin its implication of pregnancy.\n\n  \nReading 4\n\n##  Wayward Son Longs for Forsaken Home\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nA while back I asked my father for my share of my inheritance, and I struck\nout on my own. For a time I was able to live extravagantly, but misfortune has\ndissipated my wealth, and famine has impoverished the land where I now live. I\nam reduced to starvation and servitude, and I sorely miss my father’s land,\nwhere even his servants fare better than I do now. What am I to do? What shall\nbecome of me?\n\nI am,  \nThe Prodigal Son\n\n***\n\nDear Prodigal Son,\n\nThank you for asking me to read for you. T he future is not etched in stone,\nbut the cards can provide insights into your life that may help you see how to\ncreate the future you desire. With that in mind, I have dealt the following\ncards to find out what you need to know to improve your lot in life.\n\n1. Your current situation:   \nThe Emperor reversed\n\n2. Advice for improving it:   \nFour of Cups\n\n3. A probable outcome:   \nKing of Cups reversed\n\n![A Major 04 Emperor Rx.jpg](Image00017.jpg) ![C Cups 04\n33pct.jpg](Image00022.jpg) ![C Cups 14 King Rx.jpg](Image00023.jpg)\n\nThe reversed Emperor card indicates that your misfortunes are the result of\nignoring or rejecting your responsibility for your well being, and of failing\nto lay a solid foundation for your life or to plan well for your future. This\ncard is also indicative of a father figure, and being reversed, it depicts\nyour rejection of your father and your estrangement from him. This enumeration\nof your problems, however, also holds implicit advice for you. Your situation\ncan be turned around by righting the energy of this reversed card. In other\nwords, your condition may be made right again by assuming responsibility for\nboth your fortune and your future, and by a rapprochement with your father.\n\nFor more advice, let us look at the next card, the Four of Cups. This card\nconveys a feeling of ennui and melancholy, perhaps due to your having\nsquandered or dissipated the fortune that is implicitly indicated by the three\ncups in front of the figure in this card. However, another cup seems to be\noffered in this card, and we may well wonder where it is coming from. Consider\nwhere, symbolically, the first three came from: your father. Consequently,\nthis card suggests that you can turn to your father for his help.\n\nThe King of Cups can indicate tolerance, and being reversed, it seems to say\nthat you need to search inside yourself in order to find compassionate\nunderstanding and acceptance of your own problems and shortcomings. It also\nsays that in due course you will receive such comfort from your father,\nalthough this eventuality may be delayed—perhaps until you can find this\nunderstanding within yourself. In other words, this card indicates that your\nloving father has the tolerance and compassion you need, but finding it\nrequires you to make a long and potentially difficult inward search first.\n\nI hope this reading is of assistance to you.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nGenerally, a fortunetelling request like the one in this reading (“What shall\nbecome of me?”) is a cry for help and a plea for comfort and reassurance.\nSadly, this question is fairly representative of many that I get in my Tarot\npractice. Often the querent has gotten himself trapped in a difficult\nsituation and is confused and desperate. Ostensibly, he is seeking guidance,\nbut he also may be seeking assurances that everything will turn out okay, and\nthese may be assurances that I cannot give.\n\nBut while such comfort and reassurance may not be in the cards, it is helpful\nto let the querent know that he is empowered to shape his own future. We can\ndo this by illuminating the path he is on and the options he faces, which in\nturn enables him to make better decisions and to find his own way toward a\nbetter future. The layout used in this reading is effective in doing this.\n\nA remarkable feature of the cards laid out in this reading is the fact that\ntwo of them can indicate a father. The Emperor represents the archetypal\nfather image, and the King of Cups is more specific in its representation of a\nloving father.  In addition, these two cards are reversed (which, remarkably,\nmakes them both turn their gaze toward the world-weary figure in the Four of\nCups), and so this spread bears witness to the fact that the crux of the\nProdigal Son’s story lies in his problematic relationship with his father. As\na result, my interpretations in this reading tended to concentrate on the\nquerent’s relationship with his father, so let us focus our attention on these\ntwo paternal cards.\n\nInasmuch as a reversal can indicate problems or obstacles in the actualization\nof a card’s more positive attributes, it also provides advice on how to\novercome such difficulties. In the case of the Emperor, a couple of problem\nareas were considered. On the one hand, I used an abstract interpretation of\nthis card that includes things like careful planning and the creation of a\nsolid foundation for the future. On the other hand, I used the Emperor as a\nsymbol of the archetypal father figure. In both cases, a reversal of this card\nled to an explanation of how this querent got into his predicament, which\nyielded a somewhat disheartening enumeration of his errors and shortcomings. I\ncould not, however, leave it at that, so I went on to find helpful advice in\nthe card as well. This I did by considering the fact that embracing the\nhelpful characteristics of a card can go a long way toward solving whatever\nproblems may have been caused by the lack or rejection of such positive\naspects.\n\nIn the case of the reversed King of Cups, which lies in the position of\nProbable Outcome, we are again presented with guidance. Had this card not been\nreversed, a reasonable interpretation of it might have been that taking the\nadvice of the Four of Cups would easily lead the querent to his father’s\ncompassionate help. But results are not usually so easy when a card is\nreversed. In this case, I saw that the reversal of the King of Cups pointed\nout the necessity of an inward search for the superior qualities of the card,\nand it predicted a possible delay as well. These two ways of interpreting a\nreversal are, of course, related. Indeed, the difficulty of this querent’s\ninternal search for forgiveness and understanding inevitably delayed the\noutcome he desired, which was to be embraced again by his father.\n\nOften I have gained insights about the stories that have been the foundation\nfor the readings in this book, and this particular reading led me to see a new\nlayer of meaning for this parable. It showed me that this story illustrates\nthe fact that we must find compassion and forgiveness for ourselves before we\ncan accept such understanding from others.\n\n  \nReading 5\n\n##  Teacher Ponders New Position\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nTo escape a Persian invasion, I have fled to Pella, the capital of Macedonia,\nwhere the Macedonian King has asked me to tutor his young son, Alexander.\nHowever, I am uncertain if this new job will serve me well. What do I need to\nknow about this boy and about being his teacher?\n\nYours truly ,  \nAristotle\n\n***\n\nDear Aristotle,\n\nThank you for requesting this reading. For ethical reasons involving people’s\nright to privacy, I avoid doing readings to find out about a third party.\nHowever, I can do a reading to find out what you may need to know about being\nAlexander’s teacher, and we shall see if there is anything about the lad\nhimself that the cards themselves want to tell you in the process. With that\nin mind I have dealt the following three cards to shed light on your\nprospective position as tutor to the young prince of Macedonia.\n\n1. What you need to know about this job:   \nThe Magician reversed\n\n2. What you can do to maximize the value of this experience: Queen of Swords\n\n3. The probable outcome of taking this job:   \nJudgment reversed\n\n![A Major 01 Mage Rx.jpg](Image00024.jpg) ![D Swords 13 Queen\n33pct.jpg](Image00025.jpg) ![A Major 20 Judgment Rx.jpg](Image00026.jpg)\n\nFirst of all, I see a lot of energy in these cards, especially in the two\nouter ones, the Major Arcana cards. Thus, I see power and energy in this new\nemployment opportunity. However, both of the Major Arcana cards are reversed,\nwhich implies that this employment will not be easy, and the benefits of this\nwork will take time to manifest and become apparent.\n\nThe first card, the reversed Magician, shows that you will be entering a\nsituation of immense raw power, although it is still undeveloped. I see this\nas indicative of vast potential in your prospective student. This card also\nsays that you will need to use a great deal of creativity in teaching\nAlexander. You do have the skills and ability to do so, but you will need to\ndraw upon inner reserves of strength and will to use them effectively in\nworking with this student.\n\nAccording to the Queen of Swords, the best thing you can do to make the most\nof this experience is to offer the guidance of your considerable knowledge and\nthe wisdom of your experience. Note that I say, “offer.” Any forcing of\nlearning on this boy will not have the desired effect that offering it will.\nThis card also counsels you to keep your wits about you while teaching\nAlexander, and again, maintain your self-assurance. Besides this advice, the\nQueen of Swords also notes that knowledge inevitably changes a person, and the\neducation that you give this boy will profoundly transform him. This message\nis reinforced by the next card.\n\nThe reversed Judgment card predicts a major transformation of your pupil as a\nresult of your work with him. However, these changes may well take unexpected\nturns as the two of you walk a lengthy journey of discovery together, and in\ntime, your life too will be greatly changed as a result of this employment.\nAlso, this job has the potential to bring new life to something from your\npast. Is there an important experience, situation, or aspect of your life that\nyou think is gone for good? This card promises new life for it as a result of\nthis job.\n\nAgain, I thank you for asking me to read the cards for you, sir. I hope what I\nhave said is of help to you.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : Aristotle taught Alexander, the Macedonian prince, for a decade\nuntil the boy became King following the assassination of his father. Aristotle\nthen returned to Athens where, with Alexander’s financial backing, he opened a\nschool, the Lyceum, where he taught students as he had done years earlier at\nPlato's academy.\n\nAlexander, of course, was destined for fame and prominence of his own, and\ntoday we know him as Alexander the Great.\n\nComments\n\nThe question for this reading has the aspect of someone asking for help in\nmaking a decision. At first glance, then, this might suggest the use of a\nChoice Spread or a Yes/No Spread [[23]](text00000.html#_edn23) . However, I\nfelt that this wasn’t really a decision question but was more like a\ncombination of “How do I make this job successful?” and “What will come of\nit?” These two questions formed the basis of two of the positions in the\nspread that I created for this reading. This illustrates the value of\nlistening to the subtext of a querent’s question in order to find the most\nappropriate spread for it.\n\nOften a general impression of the cards in a spread can provide important\nclues as to the tone and overall meaning of a reading. This impression may be\nbased on things like a predominant color in the cards, symbols that repeat\nthroughout the spread, or images on some of the cards that are common to an\nunderlying theme. This can be a valuable process, but it is, of course, a\nhighly intuitive one that requires practice and a receptive state of mind.\n\nIn this spread, both of the Major Arcana cards are suffused with a warm glow,\nand they portray powerful, dynamic images. This visual impression led me to\npresent the opening comments of this reading: “... I see a lot of energy in\nthese cards, especially in ... the Major Arcana cards.” This observation set\nthe tone for Aristotle’s reading and influenced how I interpreted the\nindividual cards themselves.\n\nIn fact, such visual impressions are a common influence in readings. It is\nimportant to note, however, that this does not mean we should let the visual\nelements of the cards contradict or supersede our basic understanding of the\ncards. In this reading, they focused my attention on specific aspects of their\nmeanings, and they enhanced my understanding of the application of those\nmeanings to this particular reading.\n\nFor example, in most versions of the Magician card, an infinity sign floats\nabove the magician’s head. This implies an aspect of immense power that is\npotential in this card, although its reversed aspect in this reading indicated\nto me the undeveloped state of this power.\n\nFor the Queen of Swords, it helps to note the difference between this queen\nand her king. The King of Swords can be authoritarian, even dictatorial, but\nthe Tarot queens tend to be more supportive than their kings.\n\nFinally, as an interesting footnote to this reading, I offer the following\nquote from Aristotle: “In everything natural there is something marvelous.” I\nfound it remarkable how well this quote resonates with my understanding of the\nMagician Card.\n\n  \nReading 6\n\n##  Man Searches for Angel, Discovers Demon\n\nMy dear KnightHawk,\n\nWhat is a man to do when he seeks to find an angel, but discovers a demon\ninstead?\n\nThrough my experiments I sought to exorcise the shadows hiding in my soul, but\ninstead I accidentally unleashed them, and they turned me into something vile.\nThen I deluded myself into believing that I could control this thing I had\nbecome, and indeed, at first I could. But now I find that without the potion I\nneed to keep the beast in check, it controls me, and I run perilously low on\nthe rare ingredients I need for this potion. What am I to do?\n\nYours very truly ,  \nDr. Henry Jekyll\n\n***\n\nDear Dr. Jekyll,\n\nI want to thank you for asking me to read for you at this very difficult time\nin your life. I have done the following reading to see what advice the cards\ncan give you.\n\n  1. What helps you?   \nThree of Cups\n\n  2. What hinders you?   \nSeven of Coins reversed\n\n  3. Advice for the next step.   \nThe Empress\n\n![C Cups 03 33pct.jpg](Image00027.jpg) ![E Coins 07 Rx.jpg](Image00028.jpg)\n![A Major 03 Empress 33pct.jpg](Image00021.jpg)\n\nThe Three of Cups shows that the support of your friends can be of great\nassistance to you. Have you a friend or friends in whom you can confide? Will\nyou let them help you? Perhaps they can give you helpful suggestions or\nprovide perspectives that will enable you to evaluate your situation more\neffectively.\n\nThe reversed Seven of Coins indicates your resistance to reevaluating your\nsituation. It seems that you have decided what course of action you need to\ntake, and now your mind is made up. But that inflexibility can keep you from\nfinding the best solution, and this reinforces the message of the previous\ncard about seeking the counsel of your friends. Sometimes the Seven of Coins\nalso indicates reaping what you sow, but being reversed it indicates that the\nfruits of your labor are bitter, since it seems that your mistakes, more than\nyour good intentions, have determined your results.\n\nThe Empress is a card of love and nurturing. In this case, I see it as urging\nyou to love and nurture yourself more. You are being too hard on yourself,\nperhaps being overly self-critical for the mistakes that brought you to this\nstate of affairs, and that could be why you avoid seeking the help of your\nfriends. Maybe the beast within that seeks to control you is fed by your lack\nof self-love, or perhaps that beast is your own self-loathing. In any case,\nthis card says that the solution you seek lies less in potions, and more in\nyour heart and in your ability to love yourself.\n\nAgain, thank you for letting me read for you, Sir. I hope this helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nIn addition to providing insights and advice to a fictional querent, and in\naddition to offering another illustration of how to do a Tarot reading, the\nabove reading helped me find a deeper understanding of the story of Dr. Jekyll\nand Mr. Hyde. Ever since I first read this tale, I have wondered how the good\ndoctor’s experiment could have gone so terribly wrong, and now I think I\nunderstand.\n\nAs a result of this reading, I came to realize that the doctor’s potion\nseparated the good and evil halves of his psyche, which are inextricably\nintertwined in the rest of us. This was intended to give control of his life\nto his better half, i.e., the angel within him. The problem was that Dr.\nJekyll’s demons, such as his fear, greed, and self-hate, were too strong for\nhis better half, and so they ended up being what was manifested when he drank\nhis potion. Thus, the shadowy character of Mr. Hyde came to life. And although\nthis evil twin could not bring himself to kill Dr. Jekyll outright, his hate\nwas strong enough that he was able to overpower and shatter his alter ego.\n\nThe most important key to this understanding turned out to be the card that\nwas initially the hardest to interpret (the Empress), which is often the case.\nThe Three of Cups was somewhat of a literalism in this case, being a rather\nobvious reference to the fact that Dr. Jekyll had two very good friends who\nsought to help him. Unfortunately, he failed to accept their help. The\nreversed Seven of Coins clearly referred to the doctor’s resistance to\nreevaluating his situation, i.e., his insistence that his only salvation laid\nin creating the proper elixir. Those two cards were relatively easy to\nunderstand, but the advice of the Empress eluded me at first.\n\nIt took some time and a bit of meditative consideration, but the message of\nthis last card finally occurred to me. What I saw was that love (which is one\nof the more basic interpretations for the Empress card) held the key to\nunderstanding the advice that Dr. Jekyll needed. Moreover, the advice of this\ncard—that he needed to look within his own heart and find love for himself—was\nthe clue I needed in order to make sense of this tale.\n\nOnce I realized that love was the answer, I also understood that fear and\nself-loathing were the problem, which led me to the answer to a pivotal\nquestion regarding this tale: “What would compel a man to create a potion to\nturn himself into an angel?” The answer I found was that it was a deep fear of\nhis inner demons, and his hate of that part of himself, that drove Dr. Jekyll.\n\nConsidering that this tale deals with issues of facing one’s inner demons, I\nalso wondered why the Devil card had not come up in this reading. But that,\nperhaps, would have been too obvious, and the Tarot often works in more subtle\nways. In fact, the Devil might not have led me to the much-needed advice that\nthe Empress was able to provide. And so this reading was also a potent\nreminder of the Empress’s power, and the fact that her advice is always of\nvalue to any of us. But alas for poor Dr. Jekyll! If he did ever receive such\nadvice, he obviously ignored it.\n\n  \nReading 7\n\n##  Prime Minister Faces Difficult Decision\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRecently I was elected Prime Minister of Great Britain, and already I face a\ngrave choice as war has raged in Europe for months now. Hitler’s forces are\nmarching on France, but France, it seems, will not be able to withstand the\nassault. The French have requested the aid of English fighter squadrons, but I\nfear that even they may not be enough to save her. In addition, such a use of\nour limited resources could then cripple the Royal Air Force enough to leave\nEngland vulnerable to a German air assault. Shall I send France the support\nshe is asking for or not? What insights can you provide to help me make this\ndifficult decision?\n\nRespectfully yours,  \nPrime Minister Winston Churchill\n\n***\n\nDear Prime Minister,\n\nThank you for entrusting me with this vitally important question. I have done\na reading to provide you with insights into this situation to help you make\nyour decision. The cards I dealt are as follows:\n\n  1. The potential outcome if you provide France with English fighter squadrons:   \nJudgment\n\n  2. Deciding considerations:   \nThree of Cups reversed\n\n  3. The potential outcome if you hold back your English fighter squadrons:   \nThe Chariot\n\n![A Major 20 Judgment 33pct.jpg](Image00018.jpg) ![C Cups 03\nRx.jpg](Image00014.jpg) ![A Major 07 Chariot 33pct.JPG](Image00029.jpg)\n\nThe first thing I note about this spread is the fact that there are Major\nArcana cards in the positions for both alternatives you face—obviously, this\nis a major decision, but the results will be pivotal in either case.\n\nThe Judgment card acknowledges that this is a difficult judgment call for you.\nIt says that aiding France now will lend new life and renewed vigor to their\nstruggle, and it may be a turning point in the war. It also may serve as a\ncall to arms for other countries not yet committed to this struggle. On a\nhigher level, this card says that responding to France’s desperate need may\nsignal a dawning awareness of the importance of your connection with her,\nwhich may lead to new opportunities through a revitalization of your\nrelationship with her.\n\nOne the other hand, the Chariot is a card of victory. Therefore, it says that\nreserving English fighter squadrons will lead you to victory. However, I also\nsee that this triumph will require all of your will and determination. It will\nentail a great deal of effort to control opposing forces or factions within\nyour country or within your alliance. I also see that it will take\nconsiderable self-assurance and self-control to make this decision. In\ndeciding to reserve your English fighter squadrons, you are assuming an\nawesome responsibility, riding to the forefront of the resistance against\nGermany. Fortunately, this card also assures you that you can indeed stay the\ncourse and prevail.\n\nThe reversed Three of Cups says that although there are times when friendship\nshould be a consideration in making a decision, this may not be one of them.\nThus, this card asks you to carefully evaluate how much weight you should give\nto that emotional aspect of your decision. In other words, to what extent\nshould the nature and role of your friendship with France enter into your\ndecision? In addition, this card indicates that there is a potential here for\ngaining other allies, but it may take a while for them to come on board.\n\nAgain, thank you for requesting this reading. I hope it is of some help to\nyou.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : Churchill once noted that his decision to refuse France the\nEnglish air support they requested was one of the hardest he was ever called\nupon to make. He did, however, offer a plan to create a united France and\nEngland, under one government and with one united military force. France\nrejected his plan and within days fell to German invading forces. Germany then\nbegan a daunting air assault against England, an attack which inflicted heavy\nlosses on the Royal Air Force, but which the RAF ultimately resisted and\nblocked.\n\nComments\n\nDecision questions such as ones that ask, “Should I do this or should I do\nthat?” are served well by a spread like the one used in this reading. As\nillustrated here, the two flanking cards, Cards One and Three, provide a\nuseful comparison of the querent’s two alternatives. How easy the querent’s\ndecision becomes based on this comparison is, of course, dependent upon the\ncards dealt and the particular circumstances of the reading.\n\nBased on a comparison of the messages of these two cards, it sometimes is\nobvious which of the two choices is the more viable. At other times though,\nneither card seems significantly more favorable than the other, and such was\nthe case in this reading for Winston Churchill. In readings like this, the\nmiddle card, which addresses deciding considerations, can prove to be a\nvaluable tiebreaker.\n\nHistory tells us the actual outcome of the choice that Churchill ended up\nmaking, while we shall never know what might have happened had he chosen the\nother path. Might it have been the better choice? Perhaps, as the reversed\nThree of Cups noted, Churchill’s decision needed to be based upon cold, hard\nlogic and not swayed by sentiments of friendship. But the fact that both\ndecision cards, Judgment and the Chariot, have an auspicious feeling to them\n(to me, at least) may indicate that either alternative would have been viable.\n\nThis reading provided a rather ambiguous message. It is always comforting to\nsee a clear choice indicated by the cards, for that seems to be more helpful\nfor the querent. However, major life choices can be difficult precisely\nbecause the relative merits of the competing options are either uncertain or\nnearly equivalent. Indeed, if the choice were obvious, the querent probably\nwould not need a Tarot reading. So the best thing to do is interpret the cards\nand let the querent evaluate their message, draw his own conclusions, and make\nhis own decisions.\n\n  \nReading 8\n\n##  The Girl Just Wants to Have Fun\n\nDear Mr. Hawk,\n\nAre my little dog, Toto, and I ever going to get away from this God-forsaken\nfarm? My aunt and uncle are two of the most boring people on the face of the\nearth. They never let me have any fun. Why am I stuck here? All I want is a\nlittle excitement. Is that too much to ask?\n\nYours truly ,  \nDorothy\n\n***\n\nDear Dorothy,\n\nYour questions here indicate that there is a lot of unhappiness in your life\nand uncertainty about how to proceed with it, so I think the underlying issue\nyou are trying to address is how to find and actualize your life’s purpose.\nConsequently, I have decided to do a “Life Purpose” reading to see what the\ncards want to tell you. What follows is the three-card spread reading I have\ndone for you:\n\n  1. What does the universe want you to do or learn at this time?   \nStrength\n\n  2. What personal qualities do you need to accomplish this?   \nYouth of Coins\n\n  3. What specific action is needed to actualize the message of the first card?   \nEight of Wands reversed\n\n![A Major 08 Strength 33pct.JPG](Image00030.jpg) ![E Coins 11 Youth\n33pct.jpg](Image00031.jpg) ![B Wands 08 Rx.jpg](Image00032.jpg)\n\nThe Strength card says that at this time you need to learn fortitude. Face\nyour desires (which I see as referring to your thirst for fun and excitement),\ntry to understand them, and then master them instead of letting them control\nyou. There is much more in store for you than mere frivolous enjoyment,\nalthough it does seem that you may be headed for more than a little\nexcitement. In fact, great challenges await you, and through them you will\nhave the opportunity to discover vast inner reserves of strength, courage, and\npower that you never realized you had. I also see in this card that there may\nbe some frightening times ahead, as symbolized by the lion on this card, but\nyour compassionate nature can help you prevail, to soothe the savage beast, so\nto speak.\n\nThe Youth of Coins advises you to hold on to both your sense of wonder about\nnew things and your open, trusting nature. You also will need to maintain a\nsense of innocent generosity toward those with whom you come in contact. You\nstill have much to learn from the world around you, and if you give freely of\nyourself to others, they will give you much in return.\n\nThe Eight of Wands, which depicts eight wands flying through the air, often\nindicates a journey, which may answer your original question about getting\naway from the farm. But since it is reversed here, it indicates that you may\nbe going somewhere totally unexpected, your journey may be a difficult one, or\nperhaps it may even turn out to be an internal one, such as a dream. When this\nunexpected travel opportunity arises, it will take you where you need to go\nand show you what you need to learn.\n\nThanks for letting me read for you, Dorothy. I hope this helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nA student once asked me if one should always give the Major Arcana cards in a\nreading more weight than the Minor Arcana cards. I generally do, but this is\nnot a hard-and-fast rule. As another student pointed out in response, the\nMajor Arcana cards address spiritual issues, but sometimes all that we really\nwant to know right now is how to pay the bills and find a little happiness.\n\nThe key to understanding how the Major Arcana cards weigh in during a reading\nis the realization that these cards typically deal with archetypal energies,\nmajor life milestones, and concerns of the soul. Therefore, you should ask\nyourself, “Is this person asking for such messages? Are these the issues that\nshe wants or needs to deal with at this time?” If so, then certainly the Major\nArcana cards should be explored in as much depth as possible.\n\nHowever, the querent simply may want help with the mundane trials and\ntribulations of her everyday life. If the reading is focused in that\ndirection, the messages of the Minor Arcana cards may be what she most needs\nto hear. Of course, every Tarot card has many layers of meaning, and the Major\nArcana cards can address material concerns as well as spiritual ones, for the\nseparation between spiritual and earthly matters is a hazy one of perspective.\nThere is a spiritual aspect to everything we do as we go about the business of\nour workaday lives. On the other hand, since we are physical beings, it is on\nthe material plane that we must work out our spiritual issues.\n\nThe spread that I used for this particular reading was a special case insofar\nas the selection and use of the cards is concerned. When using the Life\nPurpose spread, I pull a Major Arcana card for the first position (the\nspiritual lesson), a Court Card for the second position (the personal\nqualities required), and a Pip Card for the final position (actions needed).\n[[24]](text00000.html#_edn24) Thus, it is assured that there will be one Major\nArcana card in the reading, and since the intent of the reading is to discover\nthe querent’s life purpose, an emphasis should be placed on delving into that\ncard.\n\nAs for the Major Arcana card in this particular reading, it had a couple of\ntangential meanings that went beyond the querent’s life lessons. Considering\nDorothy’s subsequent encounter with the Cowardly Lion, the feline aspect of\nthe Strength card represents an amusing literalism. I chose not to mention\nthis in the course of the reading, though, since it would have made no sense\nto someone actually doing a reading in these circumstances. Another\ninteresting literalism in this card is the fact that the illustration on the\nStrength card in my Tarot of the Masters deck is of the evil sorceress Circe,\nand Dorothy’s coming adventures in the Land of Oz were driven by a wicked\nwitch.\n\nAnother card in this reading that raises a notable point is the Eight of\nWands. There are several Tarot cards that traditionally may be interpreted in\nterms of travel, such as the Fool, the Chariot, the Eight of Cups, the Six of\nSwords, and this card. However, being both an Eight (which associates it with\npower and movement) and a Wands card (which associates it with energy), the\nEight of Wands indicates a journey very different from, say, the lonely vision\nquest of the Eight of Cups or the slow, introspective boat ride of the Six of\nSwords. Instead, when the Eight of Wands signifies a journey, it generally is\none of great power, speed, and energy. Surely Dorothy’s trip to Oz by way of\ntornado fits that description.\n\n![C Cups 08 33pct.jpg](Image00033.jpg) ![D Swords 06\n33pct.jpg](Image00034.jpg)\n\n  \nReading 9\n\n##  Scientist Fears Return Home\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nI am in England at present, but in my homeland, Germany, the Nazi party has\nseized power. Consequently, I fear for my safety should I return there, since\nI am a Jew. But if I do not return, the new government surely will confiscate\nall my property, and I will be left without home or country. What insights can\nyou provide regarding this dilemma?\n\nRespectfully yours ,  \nAlbert Einstein\n\n***\n\nDear Dr. Einstein,\n\nI want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to do a reading about such\nan important issue for you. You certainly face a difficult choice between two\nvery undesirable alternatives. I have dealt the following three-card spread to\nilluminate your situation.\n\n  1. Considerations regarding returning to Germany:   \nJustice\n\n  2. Additional factors to consider regarding both options:   \nKing of Cups reversed\n\n  3. Considerations regarding not returning to Germany:   \nThe Hermit\n\n![A Major 11 Justice 33pct.JPG](Image00035.jpg) ![C Cups 14 King\nRx.jpg](Image00023.jpg) ![A Major 09 Hermit 33pct.JPG](Image00036.jpg)\n\nWhile this is a decision that you must make with little foreknowledge of what\nthe consequences may be, the Justice card notes an important consideration\nabout the conditions in Germany to which you may be returning. Its message is\nthat human justice must be impartial, and it must be tempered by compassion\nand understanding in order to avoid becoming dictatorial. Do you feel that\nthis is the case, that the laws and system of justice in Germany are balanced\nlike that now? If not, beware the sword of “Justice” that will hang over you\nthere.\n\nSometimes the Hermit card is seen in terms of solitude, but this\ninterpretation can be overly simplistic. Therefore, it is important to realize\nthat a hermit leaves his home and community voluntarily and in the pursuit of\nknowledge and an understanding of higher truths. Thus, this card says that\nleaving your homeland behind will allow you to continue along a path toward\nfurther wisdom. And so the message I see here is that by not returning to\nGermany, you will be afforded the opportunity to search for truth and wisdom,\nand to continue that quest on your own terms and without interference.\n\nAn additional factor to consider, as indicated by the reversed King of Cups,\nis the weight you give your emotions in this situation. The King of Cups often\ncan imply or advocate having control of your emotions, but here that King is\nreversed. This says to me that you may be too in control of your emotional\nresponses, and perhaps you should pay closer attention to them, especially to\nyour fears about the current situation.\n\nAgain, thank you for asking me to read for you, Dr. Einstein. I hope this\nreading has helped.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nThe interpretation of the two Major Arcana cards in this reading demonstrates\nthe importance of looking beyond a card’s surface meaning so that we may delve\ninto the depth and breadth of all that it has to say. A rather superficial\nconsideration of the Justice and Hermit cards could have led to a reading that\nmight go something like this: “If you go back to Germany, you will find\njustice there; if you don’t, you will find yourself all alone.” But the\nnuances of the Justice card are deeper and subtler than that, and the\ndifference between loneliness and the reflective seclusion of the Hermit is\nprofound. This is not to say that cursory meanings such as those noted in the\nabove example should never be used, but rather that we would do well to avoid\nsettling for them without first making a deeper examination of what the cards\nare trying to tell us.\n\nIn the reading for Albert Einstein, the structure of the spread being used\nensured that the range of possible interpretations of these two cards was\nwider than is often the case. Typically, the definition of a position in a\nspread will focus attention on either the positive or the negative aspects of\nthe card occupying it. For example, a position called “Problems and\nChallenges” inevitably will lead to a different interpretation of a card than\nwill a position called “Advantages.”\n\nPart of the challenge, as well as the strength, of the spread used for this\nreading, lies in the fact that none of the three card positions explicitly\ncalls for either a positive or a negative interpretation. “Considerations” is\na much more open term than, say, “Advantages” would have been, and my\nexamination of the Justice and Hermit cards was affected by that fact. Even if\npositions One and Three had been defined as being the probable outcome of\nEinstein’s two alternatives, this reading may have conveyed a very different\nmeaning than what actually came up. But as the reading stood, I had to wonder\nwhat considerations the Justice card suggested regarding the option of\nreturning to Germany. The most important factor that I saw along these lines\nwas the necessity of questioning the likelihood that true justice would be\nfound in Nazi Germany.\n\nAs for the Hermit, its message about searching for truth and knowledge struck\nme as being much more relevant to this reading than was a simple message about\nbeing alone. Indeed, Albert Einstein once said that his “religion” was his\nquest for truth and his worship of pure knowledge. He has been quoted as\nsaying, “He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good\nas dead; his eyes are closed,” and this quote evokes an image reminiscent of\nthe Hermit. A return to Germany surely would have stifled, or even snuffed\nout, Einstein’s ability to wonder at the mysteries of the universe.\nFortunately, he chose the path that allowed him to continue to walk alone in\nhis Hermit-like quest for knowledge.\n\n  \nReading 10\n\n##  Golden Touch: Blessing or Curse?\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nThis is just too, too embarrassing. I’ve gotten myself into a bit of a fix\nhere, and I need your advice. You see, I did a favor for the wine god,\nDionysus, and in return he granted me a wish. I figured, you never can be too\nrich, right? So I wished that everything I touched should turn to gold, which\nwas quite a wonderful boon ... until I tried to eat. As you can imagine, a\ngolden touch makes eating and drinking quite impossible. So now I’m positively\nstarving to death! Whatever am I to do?\n\nKing Midas\n\n***\n\nMy dear King Midas,\n\nThis does sound like quite a dilemma, but let’s see what the cards can tell\nyou to help you handle this problem. A Tarot reading can give you insights\ninto your situation and suggestions about how to handle it, so with that in\nmind, I have done a reading to find out what you need to know in order to\nsurvive your gift of a golden touch, and I have dealt the following cards for\nyou.\n\n1. Your situation:   \nFive of Coins\n\n2. What you need to know about it:   \nKing of Wands reversed\n\n3. What you can do about it:   \nWheel of Fortune\n\n![E Coins 05 33pct.jpg](Image00015.jpg) ![B Wands 14 King\nRx.jpg](Image00037.jpg) ![A Major 10 Wheel of Fortune\n33pct.JPG](Image00038.jpg)\n\nThe Five of Coins indicates poverty (in its depiction of wretched people) that\nis suffered within sight of comfort and prosperity (depicted by the coins\noverhead). This represents your situation in that although you have an\nabundance of gold all around you, you lack the bare necessities of food and\ndrink. In fact, food and drink are tantalizingly at hand, but you cannot avail\nyourself of their nourishment. However, this card also provides some advice.\nThe top coin shown in this card has a godlike image engraved in it. You said\nthat a god gave you this golden touch. Have you, in your misery, overlooked\nthe option of asking that same god to help you now?\n\nThe reversed King of Wands indicates that you find yourself in this situation\nbecause you ignored your royal duties. A king rules over his people, but he\nalso has the responsibility to lead them well and wisely. It seems that the\nboon you chose was motivated by a desire for personal gain rather than by a\nsense of responsibility to your subjects. This card urges you to learn from\nthat mistake and to develop a bit of humility as well.\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune is an encouraging sign here, as it says that perhaps your\nluck has changed or soon will change. This card also indicates that your fate\nmay be out of your hands now, and in the hands of a higher power. This recalls\nthe advice of the first card in this reading, which was to seek out the help\nof the god that gave you this insidious blessing. Call upon Dionysus to see if\nhe can help you now.\n\nAgain, thank you for asking me read for you, Your Majesty. I hope this reading\nhelps you.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : King Midas did ask Dionysus to revoke his boon, and so he was\nsaved. However, he apparently failed to gain any appreciable amount of wisdom\nfrom this experience as evidenced by the fact that a later misadventure with\nApollo netted him ass’s ears.\n\nComments\n\nThis was a rather light-hearted reading that I enjoyed doing. I have always\nfound the story of the hapless King Midas to be both amusing and endearing, so\nI was eager to see what insights the cards might have for him. The first thing\nthat struck me was the remarkable aptness of the Five of Coins. The picture of\nwretched souls living in ruins while in close proximity to symbols of wealth\nseemed to be a perfect analogy for Midas’s starvation amid fabulous hoards of\ngold.\n\nThe next thing I noticed about this reading was how appropriate it was to have\nthe Wheel of Fortune turn up here. One of the more obvious aspects of this\ncard is the inevitable series of ups and downs that fate hands us. Some of\nthose cycles can take a long time—a lifetime even—to play out, but others run\ntheir course quickly. In the worlds of myth, such cycles often move swiftly,\nand it is common for some poor fool to get caught up in a volatile cycle that\nswings him from giddy heights to despairing lows in a veritable blink of an\neye. Midas is a prime example of this. To go from having unlimited wealth at\nyour fingertips one moment to facing starvation the next, certainly would be a\nbrutal lesson in the vagaries of the Wheel of Fortune.\n\nHowever, as I worked to interpret this card’s message in this reading, it at\nfirst seemed ironic that it should wind up in a position dedicated to advice,\nsince this card typically depicts fate’s inevitable tides against which we are\npowerless to resist. Of course, this card also provides encouragement that\nthings will change for the better as well, and I mentioned that in this\nreading (“... perhaps your luck has changed or soon will change.”), but I did\nnot think that this would serve as particularly helpful advice. I knew I\nneeded to dig deeper to find the guidance that King Midas desperately needed,\nso I decided to look for help in the other cards in this reading. Perhaps one\nof them could suggest something about the Wheel of Fortune that would lead me\nin the right direction.\n\nAfter a few minutes of contemplation, I saw a resonance between the Wheel of\nFortune’s message that Midas’s fate may be in the hands of a higher power and\nthe godlike face on the top coin in the first card. What I originally saw in\nthe Five of Coins was only the first half of what now appears in this reading,\nstopping short of the advice you see there now. Once I saw the connection\nbetween it and the Wheel of Fortune, I realized that both cards were offering\nKing Midas the same piece of advice, and the final version of this reading\nfell into place.\n\nThis example illustrates the benefit of comparing cards—their symbols, images,\nand messages—in order to discover a deeper understanding of them. While it is\ntrue that interpreting each card individually yields valuable insights, there\nis always more to be gained from a reading.  Our comprehension of what the\ncards are trying to tell us can be enriched by considering them together, for\neach card can shed light on the meaning of another, as this reading\ndemonstrates.\n\n  \nReading 11\n\n##  Writer of Declaration Ponders its Fate\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nArmed conflict between colonial and British forces has begun, and the\nContinental Congress has proposed that the American colonies should be free\nand independent states. I was asked to draft a declaration to that effect,\nwhich I have done as well as I can. Congress will now debate my document, and\nI pray that after whatever amendments they make to it, it will still hold true\nto my ideals.\n\nAs we draw near to adopting this Declaration of Independence, I would like to\nhave some indication of what its fate may be. Will it inspire the people of\nthese American colonies to fight against the British tyranny we face and to\ngain our freedom?\n\nSincerely,  \nThomas Jefferson\n\n***\n\nDear Mr. Jefferson,\n\nThank you for giving me this opportunity to read for you. Rather than try to\nforetell a future that is malleable, I have done the following reading to see\nwhat you can do to ensure the success of your declaration.\n\n1. The foundation of your situation:   \nTwo of Cups\n\n2. The challenges or problems that you face:   \nKnight of Swords reversed\n\n3. What you need to know or do about them:   \nJustice reversed\n\n![C Cups 02 33pct.jpg](Image00008.jpg) ![D Swords 12 Knight\nRx.jpg](Image00039.jpg) ![A Major 11 Justice Rx.jpg](Image00040.jpg)\n\nThe Two of Cups says that the impetus for the creation of the document you\nhave written is a desire for a partnership or union of the colonies. For this\nunion to succeed, your document will have to address the concerns of everyone\ninvolved, even though such concerns may seem to you to be emotional. This\ninterpretation is reinforced by the reversed Knight of Swords. That card is a\nwarning to you to control your insistence on the rightness of your own logic\nand reason. This does not mean you have to compromise your ideals, although\nsome amount of compromise will be necessary in the process of completing and\nratifying this declaration. It just means that you must realize you cannot\nalways press your ideals on others.\n\nThe reversed Justice card advises you to look inside yourself to find an\nunderstanding of things you do not comprehend about other people. Are you\ntrying to impose judgments on others that you have avoided for yourself? Are\nyou being fair in your condemnation of the flaws of others? Perhaps also, as\npreviously implied by the Two of Cups, there is some compromise needed here,\nand your document must reflect that. You see, it is just as important that the\nfigure in this card balances the scales she holds as it is that she takes\ncorrect action when wielding her sword. Thus, this card urges you to make\ncareful evaluations of the concerns of all involved and to find a balance\namong them in order to find your best course of action.\n\nIn summary, the basic message of this reading is that while there is a strong\ndesire for union among the colonies, this unity is threatened by a tendency\nfor the parties involved to try to dash off in all directions, convinced that\ntheir ideas, opinions, and solutions are the correct ones. What can help them\nsurmount those problems is for them to search their hearts to find a just\ncompromise among the needs of all involved. The advice to you, then, is to\nbalance the feelings and concerns of all of the colonies in order to ensure a\nunited effort. Also, try to reconsider and temper your idealism in order to\narrive at a just course of action of your own.\n\nAgain, thank you for asking me to read for you, Sir. I hope this reading is of\nbenefit to you.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : In the course of debating the declaration drafted by Thomas\nJefferson, the Continental Congress made several changes to it, including the\ndeletion of a paragraph that denounced the institution of slavery. Jefferson\nespecially lamented that particular modification to his work, but he relented\nin the interest of compromise. Had he not, it is likely that the southern\ncolonies would not have joined the northern ones, and the struggle for\nAmerican independence would have been lost. Of course, in light of the events\nthat tore apart the United States little more than fourscore years later, the\nultimate wisdom of that compromise may be questioned. As for the\ninterpretation of the Justice card, I must point out that although Thomas\nJefferson tried to include a condemnation of slavery in the Declaration of\nIndependence, he himself did not free his own slaves.\n\nComments\n\nAs I did this reading, I was intrigued by the recurrent dualities in it. The\nfirst two cards, which depict the central conflict (foundation: Two of Cups,\nand challenge: Knight of Swords reversed), reflect a fundamental human\ncontradiction: the yearning for union and the need to explore one’s\nindependence and individuality. They also signify the common clash between\nfeelings and emotions on the one hand, and ideas and reason on the other. Had\nthis been a relationship reading, the problem identified by these two cards\nwould have been quite obvious. Since it was a reading of a very different\nsort, however, a more flexible approach to interpreting these cards was\nrequired. The message of union expressed by the Two of Cups and the zealous\nidealism of the Knight of Swords both had to be applied in a general context\nrather than in terms of personal relationships.\n\nInterestingly, the Justice card reiterated and reinforced the points made by\nthe other two cards. The scales that Justice holds echo the meaning of balance\nand compromise that was implied by the numerological implications of the first\ncard, which was a Two. At the same time, her sword repeats the themes of\nclarity of thought and decisive action found in the Knight of Swords.\n\nBut the Justice card also reconciles these two seemingly disparate qualities.\nIt says that clarity of thought requires a balanced assessment of a situation,\nand that decisive action can only be fair when it accounts for the needs of\nall concerned. Consequently, this card, in concert with the other two cards,\nled me to the advice in this reading’s final paragraph, advice that\nincorporated the messages of all three cards.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect of the Justice card is the way in which its meaning\nwas affected by its reversed aspect. In this reading, I considered the\nreversal of this card to be an indication that much of its energy was being\ndirected inward. The justice required in this situation was not the type\nimposed externally by a governing body. Instead, it was the kind we each must\nfind in our hearts and souls when we look deeply into them to determine what\nactions are just. What was called for here was not a justice imposed, but one\nvolunteered willingly.\n\nFinally, in considering these two possible aspects of this card—justice\nimposed versus volunteered—it occurred to me that they suggest a reason why\nthis card may be placed where it is in the sequence of Major Arcana cards.\nPerhaps this card comes between the Wheel of Fortune (indicative of karma or\ncosmic justice, which is imposed upon us from outside) and the Hanged Man\n(symbolizing self-sacrifice) because it serves as a bridge between them, being\nable to reflect shades of both. [[25]](text00000.html#_edn25)\n\n  \nReading 12\n\n##  Man Yearns for a Wonderful Life\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nMy father, who was the head of the Building and Loan here in Bedford Falls,\ndied three months ago. Although I had planned to take a vacation in Europe, I\nstayed home instead in order to help set his business affairs in order. Now\nMr. Potter, who is president of the local bank and a member of the Building\nand Loan’s board of directors, wants to dissolve the Building and Loan. The\ncompany’s board voted him down, but on one condition: that I become Executive\nSecretary and run the business.\n\nThe problem is, I want to go to college. This is something I’ve wanted to do\nfor a very long time, but I have had to put it off. I’ve stuck around this\nsmall town long enough; it’s time I got the chance to do things, to go places\nand see the world. On the other hand, if I don’t stay, what will happen to the\npeople of this town with only Mr. Potter’s bank left? Cold-hearted Potter\nwon’t give anyone a break, and he won’t be happy until he has this whole town\nunder his thumb. Should I stay or should I set out to find the wonderful life\nI have always dreamed about?\n\nWhat advice can you give me to help me make this decision?\n\nSincerely,  \nGeorge Bailey\n\n***\n\nDear Mr. Bailey,\n\nThank you for this question. It is obvious that you have a genuine concern for\nyour fellow citizens that rivals your deep desire to seek your fortune, so I\ncan see how this situation must create quite a dilemma for you. I am happy to\ndo a reading to help you make this very difficult decision, and the following\nare the cards I have dealt:\n\n  1. Probable outcome if you stay in Bedford Falls:   \nThe Hanged Man reversed\n\n  2. A compromise alternative:   \nSix of Wands reversed\n\n  3. Probable outcome if you leave:   \nThe Sun reversed\n\n![A Major 12 Hanged Man Rx.jpg](Image00041.jpg) ![B Wands 06\nRx.jpg](Image00011.jpg) ![A Major 19 Sun Rx.jpg](Image00042.jpg)\n\nA quick look at the cards in this reading reveals a couple of things. First of\nall, the cards dealt for both alternatives are Major Arcana cards, which\nemphasizes what a major life decision it is that you now face. Secondly, all\nthree cards here are reversed, which indicates that there is a rough road\nahead for you, regardless of what choice you make.\n\nAs for the individual cards here, let us begin with the Hanged Man. This card\ncan indicate a sacrifice for the benefit of others or for a spiritual\nattainment that is more important than what you are giving up materially.\nSince it is reversed, I see its message from a somewhat different perspective\nthough. First of all, I see that the benefits accruing from your sacrifice\nwill be delayed, or at least it will take time for you to realize them. I also\nsee that other people will make sacrifices for you too, but again, it will\ntake time before you see that message come to completion.\n\nNext, let’s look at the Sun card. This card depicts you setting forth on your\nown, filled with joy and optimism for the future. But this card too is\nreversed, and as a consequence, my attention is drawn to the fact that the\ngray clouds thus become uppermost in this image, giving it a somewhat ominous\ncharacter. These clouds symbolize all that you will have turned your back on\nand all that you will have left behind. Thus, if you leave Bedford Falls,\nconcerns about what you have left there will weigh heavily upon you, and you\nwill feel guilty for not having made the sacrifice that has been asked of you.\nAs a result, your joy will be tainted by regret, and it will diminish in time.\n\nThe compromise card, the Six of Wands, shows you finding adventure and\nvictory. But reversed, it says that you would do well to seek those things\nsome way other than outwardly or in ways that defy your expectations. This\nsuggests that you might consider success in terms of who you are instead of in\nterms of the outward trappings of where you go and what adventures you may\nhave. And so it’s likely that the reversed Six of Wands means that there are\ngreat adventures and triumphs to be found close to home. Consequently, I see\nin this card encouragement to change your attitude toward staying in Bedford\nFalls. Rather than seeing it as a sacrifice, try to see it as a challenge and\nan adventure.\n\nFinally, let us consider these three cards together, working as a whole to\ngive us an overall message for this reading, while also keeping in mind the\nmessages they already provided individually. What I see, then, is that a\nseeming sacrifice will lead to unexpected victory and joy.\n\nAgain, thank you for requesting this reading. I hope that it is helpful for\nyou.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nThe fact that every Tarot card has a broad spectrum of meanings is one of the\ngreat strengths of this esoteric tool. However, it also is one of the greatest\nchallenges for new Tarot readers as they find themselves struggling to choose\nthe correct interpretation for a card from amongst the variety of meanings\npossible. Fortunately, there are several ways to meet that challenge, one of\nwhich was used repeatedly in the process of doing this reading.\n\n“Card interactions” is a term for the art of interpreting a card in light of\nthe sense and meaning of the other cards in the spread. This technique was\nespecially valuable in doing this reading for George Bailey, and in fact, it\nhelped me interpret all three of the cards here.\n\nFirst, my interpretation of the reversed Hanged Man was influenced by the\nadjacent Six of Wands, a card in which a crowd of people is seen supporting\nthe hero. Thus, I saw that the reversal of the Hanged Man could mean that\nother people would make sacrifices for George as well as he for them.\n\nThe way in which my interpretation of the reversed Sun card was influenced by\nthe Hanged Man was a bit more complicated. As I initially contemplated the\nreversed Sun card, my attention was focused on the gray clouds, which gained\nan unusual prominence with the card being upside down. This told me that\nGeorge’s joy at setting off into the world would be overshadowed by a sense of\ngloom. Since I generally see these dark clouds as hiding the sun, I began to\nwonder what it was about George’s life in Bedford Falls that would dampen the\njoy that he expected worldly adventures to bring him. That was when I looked\nto the other cards for help, especially the one that related to staying in\nBedford Falls. That card, the Hanged Man, suggested that the problem would be\nhis sense of guilt about not making the sacrifice he should have made.\n\nThe Six of Wands was influenced in this reading by both of the cards flanking\nit. At first I just saw the reversal of this card as turning its meaning\ninward (“... consider success in terms of who you are instead of in terms of\nthe outward trappings... ”). Then I saw another meaning for this card within\nthe context of George’s dilemma. Keeping in mind the interpretation of the\nclouds in the Sun card as meaning hidden or unrealized joys, I saw in the\nreversed Six of Wands the message that “there are great adventures and\ntriumphs to be found close to home.” And the Hanged Man also suggested that\nGeorge would do well to change his opinion that staying in Bedford Falls was a\nsacrifice.\n\nConsidering that I saw such a high level of interaction between these three\ncards, it was no surprise when I also saw them working in concert to convey a\nsummary statement for this reading. I found the image of these cards taken\ntogether to be rather striking, and as a result, I concluded this reading by\ninterpreting this spread in a way that transcended the use of its positional\nmeanings. Even so, however, I did not disregard the original message of the\nreading. Rather, I used this fresh view of the cards to get a message that\nworked well with the overall reading and that would supplement and augment it.\n\nFinally, there was one other notable feature of this reading that bears\nmentioning. While Tarot cards shed light on the situation for which a reading\nis being done, sometimes the reverse can be true as well. In the course of\ndoing a reading we can find a new layer of meaning for a card, and in this\nreading it was the Six of Wands that I learned a bit more about. There is a\nwell-known quote from the movie, “It’s a Wonderful Life,” that I found to be\ncuriously relevant to this card. At one point in the movie, the angel,\nClarence, said, “Dear George, remember, no man is a failure who has friends.”\nThus I saw that sometimes the victory of the Six of Wands might lie less in\nour achievements than in the merits and integrity of our relationships with\nthe people around us.\n\n  \n\nReading 13\n\n##  A Perilous Flight to Freedom\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nMy son, Icarus, and I have been falsely imprisoned by the King of Crete. In\nhopes of escaping, I have fashioned wings of wax and feathers for both of us.\nWill we be successful in our flight to freedom?\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nDaedalus\n\n***\n\nDear Daedalus,\n\nI want to thank you for entrusting me with this reading for you. While a\nreading can indicate a probable outcome, I don’t believe that it can tell the\nexact future, for our current actions are constantly reshaping our fate.\nHowever, I can do a reading to provide you with insights as to what you need\nto know to help you and your son make a successful escape. Thus, I have dealt\nthe following cards for your question:\n\n1. The problems you face:   \nFive of Swords reversed\n\n2. What you need to know about these problems:   \nJustice reversed\n\n3. What you can do about them:   \nDeath\n\n![D Swords 05 Rx.jpg](Image00043.jpg) ![A Major 11 Justice\nRx.jpg](Image00044.jpg) ![A Major 13 Death 33pct.JPG](Image00045.jpg)\n\nThe Five of Swords sometimes refers to betrayal or humiliation, and so, being\nreversed, it may indicate vindication or victory over that treachery. This is\nencouraging for your escape. However, it also is a warning that your success\nmay be costly, so be prepared for a perilous journey.\n\nThe Justice card often refers to the inescapable law of cause and effect.\nBeing reversed, I see it indicating that your difficulties in escaping may\nstem from you or your son ignoring that natural law. This card therefore\nadvises you both to take great care to keep in mind all of the factors and\nconstraints involved in your escape plan.\n\nLastly, the Death card advises you to let go of your bitterness about the\ninjustice you have suffered. It also says that in order to make good your\nescape, you will have to release something important in your life. This may be\npainful for you to do, but it also may be unavoidable.\n\nAgain, thank you for asking me to read for you, Daedalus. I hope this reading\nis helpful.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nThe fact that the Death card came up in this reading was quite remarkable. As\nmost people know, this tale’s ending was not a happy one.  Daedalus did indeed\nescape, but Icarus, ignoring his father’s advice (as youth so often does),\nflew too close to the sun and plunged to his death when his wings melted from\nthe solar heat. This raises some important ethical questions about predicting\ndeath in a Tarot reading. Does the Death card ever indicate an actual,\nphysical death? Is it ethical to predict physical death in a Tarot reading? Or\nis it ethical to avoid making such a prediction?\n\nWhen the Death card comes up in a reading I am quick to inform the querent\nthat it does not mean that someone is going to die. (This is to forestall the\ncommon panic that some people feel the minute they see this card turn up.) I\ntell them it usually means things like transitions, transformations, and\nletting go of something. In this particular reading it was true that Daedalus\nhad to “release something important,” although as it turns out, there was an\nactual death impending too since what he had to release was his son. On the\nother hand, this card came up in the position defined as “What you can do\nabout the problems you face,” and not in a “Probable Outcome” position, so I\nfelt that it was appropriate just to warn that extreme caution was required.\nOf course, I knew in advance what the outcome was going to be while in actual\nreadings we never have the benefit of such 20/20 hindsight; we can only rely\nupon the much hazier vision of foresight.\n\nAlthough I have, on rare occasion, had the Death card signify a physical\ndeath, in my readings it has always indicated either a death that has already\ntranspired (for example, in a reading for a recent widow) or one that is\nexpected, such as for a querent with a terminally ill loved one. In such\ncases, it addresses questions about how this person is dealing with death, or\nperhaps about what he believes about the afterlife.\n\nBut what if this card does seem to hint at an actual death? There is no\ndefinitive answer to this question, but a lot of people have very strong\nopinions about it, so a few years ago, I initiated an online discussion on\nthis topic to get other viewpoints about it. I had rarely heard of a Tarot\nreader accurately predicting a death that was not already foreseen by the\nquerent, so I was interested in the variety of responses I got.\n\nMany Tarot readers say that they would never predict a death during a reading.\nSince they don't presume to be 100% accurate, they are concerned about\npossibly causing undue stress, or even setting up a tragic self-fulfilling\nprophecy. Others say that if they get a strong sense of an actual death, they\nfeel obliged to tell the querent about it in order to provide an opportunity\nto prepare for it. Some give a very conditional yes to the question of\npredicting death in a reading. Most who said that they were willing to predict\nan actual death said that there would have to be other dire cards in the\nreading to support that interpretation, such as the Three or Ten of Swords,\nthe Tower card, or the Five of Cups. Many also advise trying to gauge in\nadvance a querent's ability to cope with grim news and his level of awareness\nthat something is wrong. But even then, almost all agree that we should try to\ncouch such a prediction in qualified terms. For example, we might say\nsomething like, &quot;You say your father is going in for surgery. I see some\nreal danger here, so perhaps you should be prepared for the possibility that\nhe may not make it.&quot;\n\nWhile I didn’t find total agreement on this topic, I did find a consensus that\neven if we sense death in the cards, we should tread very carefully, guided by\nour intuition and tempered by our empathic sense of how well the querent is\nequipped to deal with such information. So although I hesitate to say that one\nshould never predict a death in a Tarot reading, I do feel that the less\nexperienced you are at reading the cards, the more hesitant you should be\nabout predicting an actual death. For novices, I suggest that instead you\nmight warn that the Death card indicates great danger rather than say it\npredicts death.\n\n  \nReading 14\n\n##  Angels Tell Girl to Save France\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hear angels’ voices telling me that I must take up arms and fight to save\nFrance, but I am just a young peasant girl, and I am sorely afraid. Are these\nvoices tru ly those of angels from God? What am I to do?\n\nGod bless you ,  \nJoan\n\n***\n\nDear Joan,\n\nAlthough I am not in a position to tell you if the voices you hear are angels\nsent to you from God, I can ask the cards to tell us what you need to know\nabout them and about the course of action they have urged upon you. To address\nthat issue, I have dealt a three-card spread as follows:\n\n1. The situation you face:   \nTemperance reversed\n\n2. What you need to know or do about it:   \nThe Hierophant\n\n3. Where the situation is heading:   \nThe Fool\n\n![A Major 14 Temperance Rx.jpg](Image00046.jpg) ![A Major 05 High Priest\n33pct.JPG](Image00047.jpg) ![A Major 00 Fool 33pct.JPG](Image00010.jpg)\n\nFirst of all, the pivotal nature of your situation is emphasized by the fact\nthat all three of these cards are from the Major Arcana. This, in itself, is a\nstrong indication that you should pay attention to the message of these\nvoices.\n\nLooking at the specific cards, let’s start with the Temperance card, which\ntalks about gaining strength through trials and tribulations, but it is also a\ncard of healing. Being reversed, however, may affect its message as follows.\n\nFirst, the angelic voices you hear may be internal, meaning that they\nrepresent the divinity within you. Second, the trials you face may be delayed\nand will not come for some time yet. Last, the healing that this card talks\nabout, which may well refer to France itself, may be delayed as well.\n\nThe Hierophant can be indicative of a teacher, or it may be referring you to a\npriest. However, considering its context in this reading, I am inclined to see\nit as advocating that you listen to your conscience, or to the guidance of\nyour own Higher Self. In that case, perhaps your Higher Self is the source of\nthe angelic voices you hear.\n\nOn a mundane level, the Fool card refers to you going on a journey, even if\nyou don’t know exactly where it will take you, and doing what you feel called\nto do, even if everyone else thinks you are being foolish. On a psychological\nlevel, this card advises you to maintain your innocence; it will carry you\nfar. And finally, on a spiritual level, it reassures you that divinity is\nforever potential within you.\n\nThank you, Joan. It was an honor to read for you. I hope this reading helps\nyou.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nThe story of Joan of Arc is one of my favorites, [[26]](text00000.html#_edn26)\nand I approached this reading with a mixture of excitement and humble\ntrepidation. The centuries since her death have steeped Joan’s life in so much\nmyth and mystery that it is no longer possible to know how much of our\nknowledge of this remarkable girl’s life is fact and how much is fiction. So I\nwondered if this reading would reveal any hidden details about her life to me.\n\nThe first thing I noted as I began work on this reading was that I had to take\ninto consideration my own limitations. Would it be arrogant to think I could\ntell Joan of Arc whether or not she had been visited by angels?\n\nNext, I was struck by the fact that the sort of question posed in this reading\ncan sometimes cause us to seriously doubt where our querent is coming from. At\nsuch times we may be inclined to wonder if she is in need of professional help\nof a kind that we are not qualified to give. Or is she a crank? In this\nsituation—having several centuries’ worth of 20/20 hindsight—I knew that Joan\nwas very much in earnest about her question. But even when we do not know that\nsort of thing, it is generally wise to respect our querent enough to give her\nthe benefit of the doubt, do the reading to the best of our ability, and let\nthe cards tell us what we need to know.\n\nSometimes, as I did these “Ask KnightHawk” readings, it was hard to see how\nthe cards I dealt applied to the lives or stories for which I was reading. At\nother times, however, the cards’ meanings were strikingly clear, and their\nimplications hit me immediately. (The same, of course, can be said for doing\nreadings out there in the real world.) This reading was of the latter type,\nand everything fell quickly into place.\n\nAs noted in the reading for Dorothy (Reading 8), I generally give Major Arcana\ncards more weight than the Minor Arcana cards, although this is not a hard-\nand-fast rule. Another important consideration regarding the Major Arcana\ncards is the fact that they often relate to issues that are deeply spiritual,\ngoing beyond the immediate, mundane problems in our lives.\n\nIn this reading, all three cards were from the Major Arcana, which is not\nsurprising considering that this young peasant girl went on to rally a\ntottering nation to fight back and eventually save itself from being\nconquered, thus changing the course of the Hundred Years War. European history\ncould have been very different if not for her, and almost six centuries later\nshe is still world-famous, more famous in fact than any of the generals,\npopes, or kings of her day. Thus, the three cards in this reading are\nportentous indeed!\n\nAlthough all of the Major Arcana cards can have mundane meanings ascribed to\nthem sometimes (such as the Fool indicating a journey), I try to discuss\nmeanings for them that take place on “higher” levels also. For example, in\nthis reading I noted a mundane interpretation for the Fool, then went on to\ndiscuss its psychological implications, and finally interpreted it on a\nspiritual level: “... divinity is forever potential within you.”\n\nThis reading may have been helpful to young Joan as she struggled to find her\nway, but what about my hopes for finding details about her life hidden in it?\nNo cold, hard facts about Joan’s life were revealed to me while doing this\nreading. Without an intimate acquaintance with life in early fifteenth century\nFrance I had a very limited context in which to decipher the whispered truths\nof the Tarot. No ethereal visions visited me in the course of the reading\neither. (Alas, they almost never do; I do not read with that sort of gift.)\nHowever, there are universal truths about the human condition that grounded my\nunderstanding of this reading. I feel that it did reveal deeper truths about\nJoan of Arc, and ultimately those truths are more valuable than mere facts.\n\nThe heart of this reading involved the concept of the divinity within all of\nus, and I believe that Joan’s divine spirit was something with which she was\nprofoundly in touch, no matter how she conceptualized it. Were the angels she\nheard messengers from a divine source outside of her or from one within? At\nthe risk of sounding facetious, I would venture to say that the answer is\n“Yes.” In the final analysis, the crucial insight I gained from this reading\nis that the voices Joan heard were indeed from a divine source, but whether\nthey were from within her or from outside is a superficial distinction. What\nis important is the fact that this innocent young girl dared to live her life\naccording to the dictates of a higher source, regardless of how hard that may\nhave been and despite the price she had to pay for it. And so, for me the\ntruest angel in the story of Joan of Arc was Joan herself.\n\n  \nReading 15\n\n##  Man Falls in Love with Statue\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nDetesting the faults that nature has given to women, I had resolved never to\nmarry, finding my art to be sufficiently fulfilling. But now I’ve fallen in\nlove with a statue that I have sculpted—a most perfect and beautiful woman!\nWhat am I to do? Will I ever find a woman as wonderful as this one made of\nstone?\n\nSincerely,  \nPygmalion\n\n***\n\nDear Pygmalion,\n\nThank you for this interesting question. I have rephrased it slightly to focus\nit on providing insights that can empower you to create the future you want.\nThe question I have used is this: “What do you need to understand concerning\nyour love life?” With that question in mind, I dealt a three-card spread for\nyou as follows:\n\n1. What do you really want?   \nThe Devil reversed\n\n2. What do you need to face or overcome?   \nSeven of Wands\n\n3. What will help you meet this challenge?   \nTen of Coins reversed\n\n![A Major 15 Demons Rx.jpg](Image00048.jpg) ![B Wands 07\n33pct.jpg](Image00049.jpg) ![E Coins 10 Rx.jpg](Image00050.jpg)\n\nThe Devil card often refers to the demons within us, such as our fears,\naddictions, or prejudices. Reversed, this card indicates that you may be\nprojecting your own darker qualities onto others—in this case, women—which\nimplies that you want to blame them for the problems in your love life. This\nalso may mean that you have avoided making a commitment by attributing the\nundesirable qualities of some women to all women. So this card suggests that\nwhat you really want is to avoid the problems that come with having a\nrelationship, perhaps due to your past experiences in dysfunctional\nrelationships.\n\nThe advice of this card, then, is to confront your prejudices and try to\nunderstand them so that you can ultimately release yourself from their\ncontrol. It sounds like you may already be starting that process as you are\ndiscovering love. But you are still making a relationship unattainable—and\nthus, safe—by falling in love with a statue.\n\nThe Seven of Wands says that you are resisting the process of self-discovery\nand healing recommended by the previous card. It also indicates that you feel\noverwhelmed by your own passions and desires, which may be represented by the\nhydra that Hercules is battling in the image on this card. Try to re-evaluate\nyour feelings to find out why they seem to threaten you, and realize that\nsometimes what we block turns out to be the blessings of the world around us.\nSo you need to face whatever it is that makes you resist falling in love with\na real flesh-and-blood woman.\n\nThe ten upside-down pentacles on the final card, which is reversed, imply that\nyou have placed the material (the statue) above the spiritual (love). Perhaps\nyou can find some way to reverse this situation, maybe by putting your faith\nand trust in a higher power in order that you may find spirit restored to its\nproper ascendance over material concerns.\n\nIn addition, it sounds like you have isolated yourself from your community,\npartly due to your animosity toward women and also through your obsession with\nyour sculpture. This card says that you can reinvigorate your love life by\nrediscovering your connection to the community around you. Perhaps there is\nsome sort of festival where you can find enjoyment and a sense of connection.\n\nFinally, one piece of encouragement for you is that this last card depicts a\nhappy couple, which lends hope for you to eventually have a happy marriage,\ndespite what may seem to be insurmountable difficulties.\n\nI hope that this reading is helpful for you, Pygmalion.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : This tale turned out to have a happy ending for Pygmalion. He did\nindeed pray to a higher power, Venus, who answered his prayer by breathing\nlife (spirit) into the stone (material) statue, thus creating a flesh-and-\nblood woman, Galatea, who Pygmalion then married.\n\nComments\n\nPygmalion appears to have misogynistic tendencies and serious commitment\nissues. How tempting it would be to harshly judge a querent like this, but our\nprimary responsibility during a reading should be to interpret the cards with\nan open, non-judgmental mind. As mere mortals, however, we never are\ncompletely free from our observations, impressions, and conclusions about a\nquerent. And should we be?\n\nAlthough maintaining a non-judgmental stance is imperative, reading the cards\nis not something we do in isolation from our connection with the querent.\nUltimately, reading Tarot cards for someone is a conversation between our\nHigher Self, the querent’s Higher Self, and the Spirit of the Universe. The\ncards provide a very effective medium for tangibly revealing such an\nintercourse, but that does not mean we should ignore any other avenues of\ncommunication. Indeed, in order to hear the message of the cards clearly, it\nhelps to listen to the querent as well.\n\nIn this reading, the reversed Ten of Coins provided its first piece of advice\nvia the prominence of the ten inverted pentacles in the foreground. This\nbrought to mind the reversed pentacle on the Devil card, a symbol that\nindicates putting the material above the spiritual, thus leading me to the\nobservation about placing “the material (the statue) above the spiritual\n(love).”\n\nThe second piece of advice, however, came to me as a result of considering\nthis card in light of what the querent had already revealed about himself. The\nTen of Coins can indicate a substantial connection to one’s community, and it\nwas apparent from Pygmalion’s comments that he either lacked or had severed\nsuch a relationship. Thus, I saw that this card was urging him to rediscover\nhis connection to his community, and interestingly, it was at a festival that\nPygmalion eventually offered his fateful prayer to Venus.\n\nAnother interesting point about this reading concerns the meaning I saw for\nthe Seven of Wands. One of the messages of this card seemed to be that\nPygmalion was overwhelmed by his passions and desires, even though a more\ncommon way of interpreting this card is to see it as being indicative of\nstanding up for what you believe in. So how did I arrive at my interpretation?\n\nConsider the six wands that are attacking the seventh one at the bottom of\nthis card. (This feature of my Tarot of the Masters version of this card\nechoes the image on the RWS version of a man being attacked by six wands that\nare not visibly held by anyone.) Sometimes it strikes me as curious that no\none is holding those wands, and I have to wonder if the querent may be\nresisting something from within, such as his own desires. Alternatively, he\nmay be fending off something from the universe, whether that’s challenges he\nneeds to face, overcome, and learn from, or blessings that he has failed to\nrecognize as such.\n\nA general piece of advice that this discussion of the Seven of Wands points\nout is that we can find new layers of meaning in a card when we consider its\ndetails and try to see what they say to us. We can do this as we study the\ncards, interpreting their details in light of our existing understanding of\nthem, and we can do this during a reading, sensing the message of such details\nin the context of the reading itself.\n\n  \nReading 16\n\n##  Prince Finds Revenge Beyond His Ability\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nMy father’s ghost has revealed to me that he did not die of natural causes.\nRather, my treacherous uncle killed him in order to gain his throne and take\nmy mother for his wife. This most unfortunate ghost has urged me to avenge his\ndeath, yet I find that I cannot. Why can I not find the courage to kill my\nUncle Claudius?\n\nRespectfully,  \nHamlet, Prince of Denmark\n\n***\n\nMy dear Prince Hamlet,\n\nThank you for giving me this opportunity to read for you on this delicate\nsubject. Let us see what insights the cards can give us regarding your current\nstate of affairs. I have dealt a three-card spread for your question as\nfollows:\n\n1. Past:   \nSix of Cups\n\n2. Present:   \nThe Tower\n\n3. Future:   \nSeven of Swords\n\n![C Cups 06 33pct.jpg](Image00051.jpg) ![A Major 16 Tower\n33pct.jpg](Image00052.jpg) ![D Swords 07 33pct.jpg](Image00009.jpg)\n\nThe Six of Cups says that you were, until recently, living a sheltered life of\ninnocence. You were treated kindly, and you developed an open, generous heart.\nBut then, as indicated by the Tower, a catastrophe (your father’s death)\nchanged your life suddenly, surprisingly and irreversibly. This shocking\ncrisis shattered your innocence and challenged your youthful concepts, and you\nare still reeling from it.\n\nThe Seven of Swords warns that you will find deception and intrigue all around\nyou. It will be a struggle to find the truth in the m`idst of all that\nduplicity, and this card advises caution, stealth, and careful discernment\nthroughout the days to come.\n\nNow, to answer to your question explicitly, let us considered the three cards\nin this reading together as if they are telling a story. Together, they say\nthat a severe crisis (your father’s assassination) has yanked you forcibly\nfrom your youthful innocence and is compelling you to take action that will\nrequire sinister cunning—treachery even—before you are ready and sooner than\nyou would like.\n\nTo state this in more detail, the first card says that your lingering youthful\ninnocence inhibits you from taking the dire course of action your father’s\nghost has set upon you. The second card adds the message that the shock of\nthis situation has not yet worn off, and this has somewhat paralyzed you,\nagain keeping you from action. The final card, however, assures you that you\nwill find the psychological resources to do what you must. You just need time\nto adapt, learn, and grow, and then you will be able to act.\n\nAgain, thank you for letting me read the cards for you, Prince Hamlet. I hope\nthis helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : The question of why Hamlet hesitates to kill his uncle, who\nmurdered Hamlet’s father, is a celebrated and controversial topic of\ndiscussion among Shakespearean scholars. I simply could not pass up the chance\nto do a Tarot reading on the subject, letting the cards throw their two cents\nworth into the debate.\n\nComments\n\nThe meaning of the first two cards, especially when considered together, was\nrather obvious to me as I set about doing this reading. The children in the\nSix of Cups are standing in an enclosed garden, and it may be inferred from\nthis that the innocence depicted there is something that is or must be\nprotected. In this reading, it indicated to me both Hamlet’s innocent nature\nand the sheltered life he had lived previously.\n\nBut then that innocence and protection are shattered by the crisis of the\nTower. The catastrophe of his father’s murder would be difficult enough in any\ncase, but it seemed all the more sinister due to Hamlet’s gentle upbringing,\nwhich ill prepared him for such a crisis. In this reading, this card was also\na clear corroboration of the allegation of murder set forth by the ghost of\nHamlet’s father, and it would have served that valuable purpose in an actual\nreading. Sometimes querent’s need such corroboration of what they suspect as\nmuch as they need insights into things they don’t know.\n\nAs for the Seven of Swords, the image of someone sneaking away has obvious\nconnotations of theft, deceit, and subterfuge. The essential question in a\nreading, though, is who is this sly person, the querent or someone else? Here\nthe answer was both. Hamlet would discover that there was deceit and treachery\ngoing on around him, and he would have to find it within himself to do the\nthings he must, even if those actions ran counter to his established sense of\nmorality.\n\nThis reading ends with a wrap up summary, which is something I generally try\nto do in a reading for real people. I have not included such summaries for\nmost of the readings in this book because on the written page they can easily\nseem redundant instead of being a recap, which is their role in the dialogue\nof a face-to-face reading. However, the three cards in this reading worked\ntogether as a single tableau so well that I wanted to use this particular\nexample to illustrate this technique.\n\nAs a final note, I must point out that if this had been a reading for a real\nperson, I never would have helped him find the wherewithal to commit murder.\nEither I would have tried to redirect his question toward a more productive\nline of inquiry, or I would have urged him to seek psychiatric counseling.\n\n  \nReading 17\n\n##  Duckling Ridiculed by Peers\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nWhy does everyone laugh at me and pick on me? I may not be as adorable as my\nbrothers and sisters, but I can’t help what I look like, or who I am. What can\nI do?\n\nHumbly yours,  \nThe Ugly Duckling\n\n***\n\nDear Duckling,\n\nThank you for giving me this opportunity to read for you. I am sorry to hear\nthat you are having such difficulties. It doesn’t seem fair does it? I’ve done\nthe following reading to help you understand your situation better and see how\nbest to deal with it.\n\n1\\. The foundation or background of your situation:  \nThe Star\n\n2. What you need to know or do about your problem:   \nKing of Cups\n\n3. What may help you:   \nSeven of Wands reversed\n\n![A Major 17 Star 33pct.JPG](Image00053.jpg) ![C Cups 14 King\n33pct.jpg](Image00054.jpg) ![B Wands 07 Rx.jpg](Image00055.jpg)\n\nThe Star is a card of hope, and it is a beautiful card with which to start\nyour reading. It shows one large, brightly shining star in the heavens\nsurrounded by seven smaller, lesser stars. I see you as that lovely star. You\nare different, but this card promises a brighter future when your differences\nwill be seen as something splendid.\n\nThe King of Cups advises you to learn to control your emotions. Although you\nmay need to be wary of others around you, take care that you do not succumb to\nfear or anger. This card also urges tolerance of others, even when they are\nnot tolerant of you, and reminds you not to sink to their level. Try to ride\nabove the turmoil of derision in which you find yourself.\n\nThe reversed Seven of Wands suggests that maybe you are being too defensive,\nand that it may help to try to be less so. Others may call you ugly names, but\nis it worth fighting about? This may not be an issue you need to take a stand\non. Remember the promise of the Star card and let their taunts just roll off\nyour back. But if they become too physically abusive, you may want to yield\nyour ground and retreat for a while. Then later, when you are in a better\nposition, you can come back and confront them if you like.\n\nAgain, thanks for asking me to do this reading for you. I hope it helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nI have always had a special fondness for this charming folk tale. I believe\nthat it is such a popular and endearing story because so many of us have grown\nup feeling different and alienated, just like this duckling who turned out to\nbe a swan. Ironically, it is common to have been uncommon in our childhood.\nThis is because while there are only a few ways to conform to the social\nnorms, the eccentric paths of individualism are infinitely varied. Later in\nlife we may find our way, especially when we go out into the world and\ndiscover other people with whom we share a common bond, but in our youth we\nare stuck in the environment into which fate has thrust us.\n\nBesides physical differences—the extended metaphor that illustrates the theme\nof this tale—children and adolescents may be ridiculed or ostracized by their\npeers for being intellectual, shy, awkward, gay, introspective, sensitive, or\nempathic, or for having unconventional beliefs, attitudes, or interests. But\nwhatever our differences may be, we all hope to become swans once we leave the\nnest. I know I did, and so I was anxious to do a reading for this unfortunate\nduckling and thus, in a way, for myself.\n\nYou can imagine my joy, then, when one of my favorite cards, the Star, was the\nfirst card to turn up in this spread. This card of hope is a wonderful sign\nfor any ugly duckling. That large, bright star high in the sky is different\nfrom the other stars, but rather than being out of place, despicable, or\nridiculous, it is unique, beautiful, and exalted. What a perfect way for each\nof us to see ourselves. In fact, I have a friend who created a personal mantra\nof “I am a shining star.” She even framed this affirmation, written in silver\nletters set against a starry background, and hung it in a place of honor in\nher home. Indeed, this is an excellent affirmation to use with this card.\n\nNext there was the King of Cups. I see both the King and Queen of Cups as\nindicating emotional mastery, but the differences between the two, although\nsubtle, are important. One way of considering kings is to think of them as\ndealing with issues of control and as coping with the world (including\nsociety) around us. The queens, on the other hand, tend to deal with issues of\nsupport, understanding, and personal relationships. So the King of Cups can\nsignify being in control of our emotions (in this case, fear and anger),\nespecially in the midst of emotional turmoil. This message can be seen in the\nimage on this card, where this king sits confidently on his throne next to the\nturbulence of a waterfall. In fact, this image led me to the advice, “Try to\nride above the turmoil of derision...”\n\nThis card also can be about dealing with other people in a diplomatic way.\nThus, in this reading, the King of Cups advises “tolerance of others, even\nwhen they are not tolerant of you.” This is a warning against falling into an\nall-too easy trap. In emotionally charged situations such as the one in which\nthe Ugly Duckling found itself, it is tempting to reflect back the hate we get\nfrom other people—to exclaim, “ They are the ones who are wrong!”—but doing so\nplunges us into a dark side of the King of Cups, that of anger and prejudice.\n\nLastly, the Seven of Wands often indicates taking a stand and defending your\nposition, but reversed, I saw it as both a reduction and a delay of this\nmessage. The reversal of this card indicated a diminishment of its typical\nmeaning in that it advised not being so defensive and even suggested\nretreating from this conflict. It indicated delay in its message: “Then later,\nwhen you are in a better position, you can come back and confront them if you\nlike.” At the very least, a reversal can be a questioning of the typical\nmessage of a card, and in this case, I asked, “Others may call you ugly names,\nbut is it worth fighting about?” Asking questions like this can be effective\nin working with a reversed card.\n\nNote that the message of this last card (“you may want to yield your ground\nand retreat for a while”) works very well with what happened near the end of\nthe story of the Ugly Duckling. The young bird, not yet a beautiful swan, flew\noff to be alone until finally, full-grown, it chanced to see its own\nreflection in a pond and realized its own beauty for the first time. And so I\nsee a message in this reading for all of us. Perhaps at some point we all need\nto make a journey of self-discovery with hope in our hearts (the Star) and\nwith malice toward none (King of Cups), forgetting about our self-defensive\nstruggles (reversed Seven of Wands) so that we can just look inside ourselves\nand find the beautiful swan that we all have within.\n\n  \nReading 18\n\n##  Lady Wants to Help Husband Become King\n\nSir KnightHawk,\n\nI have just learned of a prophecy foretelling that my husband shall become\nKing of Scotland. Although I am thus encouraged for his fortune, I do fear his\nnature may be too full of the milk of human kindness to do what he must. He\nhas ambition, but has he the unscrupulous nature with which to attain his\npromise? Must the valor for this undertaking be mine? If so, how shall I\nproceed?\n\nSincerely ,  \nLady Macbeth\n\n***\n\nMy Dear Lady,\n\nThank you for requesting my help. You have asked several questions here, but\nthe one best suited to a Tarot reading is the one that seems to be the central\nissue with which you are concerned: what can you do to help your husband\nbecome king? To shed light on that subject, I have done the following reading,\nwhich considers several different aspects of your ambitions. The cards that I\nhave laid out for you are as follows:\n\n  1. What ideas and plans will help you attain your goal?   \nThree of Coins\n\n  2. What emotional aspects regarding your plans should you be aware of?   \nEight of Wands reversed\n\n  3. What are the important spiritual considerations regarding your ambitions?   \nKing of Cups\n\n![E Coins 03 33pct.jpg](Image00056.jpg) ![B Wands 08 Rx.jpg](Image00032.jpg)\n![C Cups 14 King 33pct.jpg](Image00054.jpg)\n\nFirst of all, I’m getting a unified impression from these three cards.\nOverall, they convey a need for caution against taking precipitous action.\nCareful action, patience, and discretion are advised. Avoid rushing into\nthings; take time to do this right. Now let’s look at the specific messages of\nthe individual cards.\n\nThe Three of Coins says that the prophecy to which you have referred can be\nmanifested, but it will take diligence, hard work, and a cooperative effort.\nDon’t try to take shortcuts. Carefully plan the steps that you and your\nhusband can take together to lay the proper foundation for him to become king.\nThen, remaining mindful of your goal, always pay attention to the details of\nthe task at hand. More than that, however, remember that if your husband is\nfated to be king, then fate, not you, will deliver him to his destiny, a\ndestiny that is bigger than the both of you. As an illustration of this,\nconsider the image on this card of people working on a larger-than-life\nstatue, and remember that just as a statue cannot be built quickly, your\nhusband’s ascension to the throne may take a long time as well.\n\nThe next card warns against getting swept away by your passions. The Eight of\nWands often indicates rushing into something, which is not always a problem.\nBut here, in its reversed aspect, I see this card as a warning about the\ndangerous aspects of acting too quickly. This card says that without the\ncareful planning and honest work in quest of your goal that was indicated by\nthe previous card, your efforts could come crashing down around you. In other\nwords, haste can lead to an emotional breakdown, either for you or for your\nhusband ... or both.\n\nThe King of Cups indicates that the spiritual lesson you face at this time is\nconcerned with how you deal with other people. This card says you need to\nlearn how to remain calm and in control when you find yourself confronted with\nturbulent emotions. It also notes that a successful kingship requires tact and\ndiplomacy, and thus, it advises you both to be cool-headed rather than hot-\nblooded in your pursuit of the crown. Finally, this card urges you to find a\ncalm centeredness in your heart.\n\nIn summary, this reading advises you to make a long-term plan and to work on\nit diligently, but without haste. Be patient, and you can safely attain your\nhusband’s royal destiny, which will be best achieved through tact and\ndiplomacy rather than precipitous action. And so this reading’s most important\nmessage is its advice to allow events to unfold in their own time.\n\nAgain, thank you for asking me to do this reading for you, My Lady. I hope it\nis of some help to you.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nI have always found Lady Macbeth to be a much more interesting character than\nher husband, so when I decided to do a reading based upon Shakespeare’s famous\nplay about ambition, I turned to the archetypal great woman behind the great\nman. Unfortunately, in this case, the great woman pushed her husband over the\nbrink and into the abyss, as she, herself, plunged into her own private\ndarkness.\n\nA question about this play that naturally comes to mind is, why did this\nhappen? Is ambition inherently wrong or bad, or was there some compounding\nflaw that condemned Lady Macbeth to her fate?\n\nEarly on in the play (in act I, scene v), when Lady Macbeth heard of the\nfateful prophecy regarding her husband, she immediately began to plot and\nscheme, determined to ensure the fulfillment of this prediction. Prior to\ndoing this reading, I had found it strange that she had not allowed fate to\ntake its promised course, which seemed more prudent than the hasty regicide\nshe chose instead. Presumably, if something is fated, it will come to pass\nwithout our intervention, right? So I decided to do a reading for her at that\npoint at which the spark of ambition, which ultimately consumed her soul, had\nignited.\n\nFor me, the key to this reading was the reversed Eight of Wands, for as I\ndealt these three cards, it was the one that first grabbed my attention. It\nset the tone for the whole reading, and its message influenced my\ninterpretation of the other two cards as well. Indeed, its advice against\nrushing into things seems highly appropriate in light of the dire consequences\nof the haste with which Lady Macbeth pursued her ambitions. Thus, an important\ninsight that I got from this reading was that it was not her ambition that\ndoomed Lady Macbeth so much as it was her impatience.\n\nThe Three of Coins provided valuable insights that complemented those of the\nreversed Eight of Wands. My Tarot of the Masters version of this card depicts\nartisans carving a statue. This image called to mind something that\nMichelangelo purportedly said about sculpting. He claimed that a statue is\nalready there in the stone, revealed to him by God, and that he merely chipped\naway everything that was not the statue. This led me to see that Lady Macbeth\nneeded to work with fate, to help it unfold, rather than to force her own plan\nupon it. Once again, patience was called for. In addition, this card stressed\nthe need to find a vision of what fate’s plan had in store for her husband.\nLady Macbeth, however, took no time for such careful reflection as she dashed\nrecklessly into action. It was as if upon being told that a beautiful statue\nlay hidden within a block of marble, she had smashed into it with hammer,\nchisel, and complete abandon.\n\nConsidering this theme of patience, it was significant that the final card was\nthe King of Cups, an excellent depiction of someone who is “cool-headed rather\nthan hot-blooded.” In addition, this card added another layer of meaning to\nthis reading through its advocacy of tact and diplomacy, qualities\nconspicuously missing from Lady Macbeth’s plans.\n\nThe preceding discussion illustrates how valuable first impressions can be\nwhen doing a reading, since they usually come from a source more profound than\nlogic and reason. In this case, I was struck initially by the warning against\nhaste indicated by the reversed Eight of Wands, and this impression set the\ntone for the whole reading. It guided me to the meanings most appropriate for\neach card, and it shaped the conclusion of the reading. All of this arose from\nthe general feeling I got as I initially laid out these cards. Paying\nattention to your first impressions is an intuitive process that requires a\nreceptive mind and an open heart. It is a process that is understood, learned,\nand perfected through practice and experience.\n\n  \nReading 19\n\n##  Will Health Problems Block Marriage Proposal?\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nMr. Joe Pittman has asked me to marry him, but I am barren due to wounds\nsuffered while I was a slave. I cannot marry him without telling him this, but\nI fear that if I do he will no longer want me to be his wife. This is a great\ndilemma for me, and I don’t know what to do. Please help me.\n\nRespectfully,  \nJane Brown\n\n***\n\nDear Miss Brown,\n\nThank you for asking me to read the cards for this difficult question for you.\nUsing the following three-card spread, I have done a reading to see what you\nneed to know about this marriage proposal and how to handle the problems you\nface regarding it.\n\n  1. What is working against you:   \nThree of Coins reversed\n\n  2. What is working in your favor:   \nKing of Coins\n\n  3. What you can do to cope with this situation:   \nThe Sun reversed\n\n![E Coins 03 Rx.jpg](Image00057.jpg) ![E Coins 14 King\n33pct.jpg](Image00058.jpg) ![A Major 19 Sun Rx.jpg](Image00042.jpg)\n\nConsidered in light of its numerological and elemental associations, the Three\nof Coins is about creativity on the physical plane. So on one level, the\nreversed Three of Coins indicates the obvious: that what is working against\nyou is your impaired ability to create physical life, i.e., to have a baby. On\na deeper level, however, this card says that you are allowing this problem to\ncloud your recognition of your creativity in general. You are losing sight of\nhow much you and Joe Pittman can create even without bringing children into\nthe world—including security and stability for each other. In addition, you\ncan contribute much to the world around you due to your generosity to others.\nYou have considerable skills and talents, but you are letting your inability\nto have children overshadow them, and that is what is truly working against\nyou.\n\nThe King of Coins says that what is working in your favor is Joe himself. He\nis solid, dependable, and down-to-earth. His great strength of character (as\nwell as your own) will see you both through this. You need not worry about how\nhe will react to this news, for he knows what is important in life, and he\nwill prove to be of considerable support to you.\n\nThe reversed Sun card urges you to look inside yourself to find the vitality,\njoy, and self-confidence that will see you through this. This card\nacknowledges that it is quite difficult for you to see that right now, but it\nguarantees that you do indeed have those qualities. Search inside for them,\nrecognize them as your own, and keep them in mind as you consider Joe\nPittman’s proposal. This will show you how to move beyond focusing on your\nphysical problem, and it will help you handle this dilemma.\n\nAgain, thank you for letting me read for you, Miss Brown. I hope this helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : As an interesting footnote to this reading, I would like to point\nout that in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman , Jane seeks the advice of\na psychic at one point, although on a very different matter than the subject\npresented here.\n\nComments\n\nThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman is a story about a bold woman with\ngreat strength of character who is inspiring in her ability to overcome\nadversity. This is reflected in the cards dealt for this reading. My first\nimpression when I considered these three cards was how well they depicted\nJane’s skill, strength, and general optimism. The fact that two of these cards\nwere reversed indicated that such traits and abilities were being overlooked\nor unacknowledged at the time that she was seeking this reading.\n\nFor someone lacking in formal education, Jane had considerable skill in\nadapting to the constantly changing conditions of her life, and she displayed\na great deal of talent for creating abundance out of adversity. However, when\nfaced with Joe Pittman’s marriage proposal, she balked due to the fact that\nshe was barren. Ostensibly, then, her infertility was the problem she faced,\nand when interpreting the reversed Three of Coins, it would have been easy to\njust see it in light of Jane’s fertility problem, but that would have been too\nsimplistic an answer. When I considered this card further, I saw that Jane’s\nreal obstacle was the fact that she was focusing on that fertility problem\ninstead of realizing how much more she had to offer. Consequently, it was with\nthat additional depth of meaning that I concluded my explanation about this\ncard.\n\nAt first glance, the King of Coins seems a perfect depiction of Joe\nPittman—someone who was “solid, dependable, and down-to-earth.” Certainly, his\nstrength of character was of great value to Jane as she struggled to cope with\nthis difficult problem. However, I generally find that a Court Card has\nsomething to say about the querent’s personality and character, even when it\nalso points toward another person. Thus, it was Jane’s strength as well that\nsaw her through her troubles.\n\nFinally, the Sun card has a lot of energy and vitality, and so did Jane. She\njust needed to be reminded of that in order to regain her self-confidence and\nsense of optimism. And in the final analysis, this was what carried her\nthrough the troubled times for which she may have sought a reading such as\nthis one.\n\n  \nReading 20\n\n##  Woman Seeks Success in New Location, Career\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nI am frustrated by the fact that since I am a woman, I cannot go to University\nhere in Poland. Instead, I must work as a governess. My sister lives in Paris,\nand she was able to study there to become a doctor. She and her husband want\nme to join them there, for she says I can study at the Sorbonne, and although\nI hate to leave my parents, I have decided to go. Will I be successful in my\nstudies and career in Paris?\n\nWith warm regards ,  \nMarja Sklodowska\n\n***\n\nDear Miss Sklodowska,\n\nThank you for giving me this opportunity to read for you. This sounds like a\nbig move for you; I see why you are wondering what will become of it. With\nthat in mind, I have done a reading to see what you can do to find success in\nyour studies and in your subsequent career. The spread I have dealt for you is\nthe following:\n\n1. The path you are on:   \nJudgment\n\n2. What you may encounter along that path:   \nQueen of Wands reversed\n\n3. The probable outcome of your journey:   \nThe Emperor\n\n![A Major 20 Judgment 33pct.jpg](Image00018.jpg) ![B Wands 13 Queen\nRx.jpg](Image00059.jpg) ![A Major 04 Emperor 33pct.jpg](Image00060.jpg)\n\nThe Judgment card says that yours is a great calling. You are clearly at a\ncrossroads in your life, and this is an encouraging card for this new\nbeginning of yours. Moving to Paris certainly will be the beginning of a new\nlife for you.\n\nMy first impression of the Queen of Wands is that it is a radiant card, but\nbeing reversed, it implies that radiance may be a challenge or problem for\nyou. I’m not sure right now what that means, but it occurred to me, so just\nkeep it in mind. I also see here that you will encounter some resistance from\npeople who are not used to strong women, but you should be able to overcome\nthat with your innate courage and determination. And so this card challenges\nyour energetic nature and self-assurance as you journey along the path you\nhave chosen. It assures you that you have those qualities, but it urges you to\nutilize them fully in order to achieve your full potential.\n\nThe Emperor card shows you systematically finding order, which perhaps refers\nto you doing research at the University. This is also a card of recognized\nauthority, which seems to be your destiny. All in all, this card bodes very\nwell for your success in your studies and career.\n\nAgain, thank you for asking me to do this reading for you, and I hope it helps\nyou.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nPostscript : Marja Sklodowska did indeed move to Paris, where she changed her\nfirst name to Marie, and in 1895 she married Pierre Curie. Marie Curie went on\nto win two Nobel Prizes: one in physics in 1903, and one in chemistry in 1911.\nThen by the late 1920s her health began to deteriorate as she developed\nleukemia due to the high-energy radiation to which her work had exposed her.\n\nComments\n\nThe first thing to note about this reading is the fact that I have implicitly\nrephrased Curie’s question to make it empowering for her. Generally, I try to\nchange “Will I be...” questions into a form like, “What can I do to be...”\nSuch readings do, however, often end up addressing the “Will I be...” question\ntoo—at least tangentially. But when they are rephrased this way, their focus\nis shifted from fortunetelling to providing insights that can help the querent\ncreate a desired future outcome. [[27]](text00000.html#_edn27)\n\nIn this reading I interpreted a reversal (the reversed Queen of Wands) to mean\nthat more of the quality of this card was needed (“...this card challenges\nyour energetic nature and self-assurance...”). However, in such cases I also\ntry to note when this quality is already present but just needs more attention\nor development. Often when a card comes up reversed, its qualities are present\nor potential but also delayed, diminishing, under-utilized, sublimated, or\nblocked. [[28]](text00000.html#_edn28)\n\nThere was something else interesting about the Queen of Wands in this reading.\nOne of my keywords for this card is “radiant,” which often means someone who\nhas a sunny disposition. But when I considered this card, reversed as it was,\nI said to myself, “problems with radiance,” and I felt a shiver run up my\nspine as I remembered what caused Marie Curie’s death—radiation exposure. Of\ncourse, I could not state this observation in those words and stay within the\nconstraints of my “Ask KnightHawk” readings. This reading had to sound like an\nactual reading for a young Marja Sklodowska, and at the time that such a\nreading would have taken place (the late nineteenth century), a Tarot reader\nwould not have known what high-energy radiation was. Hence the rather vague\nphrase, “radiance may be a challenge or problem for you.”\n\nI point this out because sometimes we get impressions that make no sense to us\nat the time because we may lack some required bit of background information.\nIf that happens, it is important for us to trust our intuition and say what\ncomes to mind anyway, as I did in this reading, because the querent may\nunderstand what our statement refers to, either during the reading or at some\nlater date.\n\n  \nReading 21\n\n##  Man Suspicious of Brother\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nMy brother, Cain, and I have always been close, but lately he’s been acting\nstrangely. He has been cold and withdrawn, and he won’t open up to me like he\nused to. I am afraid he may even be planning to do me harm. What’s wrong? Or\nam I just being paranoid?\n\nSincerely ,  \nAbel\n\n***\n\nDear Abel,\n\nI want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to read the cards for you.\nSince I am not a psychologist, I cannot really address your question as you\nhave stated it. A question better suited to a Tarot reading is: what do you\nneed to know about your relationship with your brother? With that in mind I\nhave done a reading using the following three-card spread to see what the\nTarot may have to say about this relationship.\n\n1. Your point of view:   \nThe World\n\n2. The problem itself:   \nThe Devil reversed\n\n3. Cain’s point of view:   \nAce of Cups reversed\n\n![A Major 21 World 33pct.jpg](Image00061.jpg) ![A Major 15 Demons\nRx.jpg](Image00048.jpg) ![C Cups 01 Ace Rx.jpg](Image00062.jpg)\n\nThe World card says that you want oneness and wholeness in your relationship\nwith your brother. It also indicates that you have a strong connection to a\nhigher source, and it may indicate the completion of an important phase of\nyour life.\n\nThe reversed Devil card indicates that the problem in your relationship stems\nfrom pride and materialism, both of which are hidden, i.e., they are\nunapparent or unacknowledged ... or both. Also, this card may be saying that\nthere is a dark, underlying influence affecting your relationship that neither\nof you perceives. I hesitate to say that the Devil himself is that hidden\ninfluence, because this card need not be interpreted so literally, but in\nthese unusual circumstances, that could be the case.\n\nThe reversed Ace of Cups indicates that for some reason your brother feels\nthat you have cut him off from love and grace—perhaps even from divine love.\nHowever, an underlying layer of meaning here is that his view of the situation\nis tainted by his own resistance to love. So the advice that I see in this\nreading is to try to help your brother find his own deep source of love before\nit is too late.\n\nAgain, thank you for letting me read for you, Abel. I hope this helps.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\nComments\n\nThe question for this reading was suggested by one of the readers of my “Ask\nKnightHawk” column. At first I hesitated to do a reading for a biblical\ncharacter, wondering if that would be opening a can of worms that I did not\nwant opened. I decided to try it anyway and trust that whatever message was\nneeded would come through. Well, wouldn’t you know, the Devil card came up in\nthe middle of the spread. How was I to handle that? It seemed too obvious, or\nwas the Tarot just expressing a sense of humor? As I thought about it though,\nI realized that this card did seem to be perfect in that position.\n\nHave you ever wondered what the heck could have driven Cain to the extreme\naction of killing his own brother? And since there were only a handful of\npeople around at the time, it was not like he going to be able to say,\n“What’re you looking at me for? It could have been anyone.” Well, okay.\nActually he did say something like that (“Am I my brother’s keeper?”), but you\ndid not have to be God to see through that transparent attempt at obfuscation.\n\nI suppose one could say that the Devil made him do it, and in the context of\nthis story, that could be a reasonable interpretation. But typically the Devil\ncard indicates the shadow aspects of our human nature—the demons, so to speak,\nthat we all carry inside of us. Things like pride and greed. Things that make\nus act in quite irrational ways. They are the deep, dark obsessions whose\nwhispered suggestions seduce us into actions that we find hard to resist, and\nthat we later regret. When they remain unacknowledged or denied, they become\nall the more unmanageable and insidious, and so it must have been for Cain.\n\nThe two flanking cards, which represent the two brothers’ opposing points of\nview of the situation, were also quite appropriate. The World card depicts\nthings like accomplishment, prosperity, peace and joy, and recognition of the\ndivinity of which we are a part. It indicates someone who is at one with\nhimself, and who feels whole and complete. All of these qualities can be\nascribed to the gentle, benign Abel.\n\nInterestingly, the meanings that I often ascribe to the Ace of Cups are quite\nsimilar to those for the World card. This Ace can indicate an understanding of\nand compassion for yourself and others, as well as a connection with other\npeople—presumably a benign connection, however. This corresponds to the\noneness and wholeness of the World card, and like that card, this Ace also\nimplies love, peace, and serenity. Even the World card’s connection with our\ndivine essence is reflected in my Tarot of the Masters version of this Ace,\nwhich was inspired by a painting titled, The Titan's Goblet . In other words,\nit is an immense chalice belonging to a god. In addition, this card can imply\nthe healing of rifts in relationships, but it is reversed in this reading,\nindicating that for Cain these warm and benevolent feelings were blocked,\ndenied, or repressed. The most obvious meaning for the Ace of Cups is “love,”\nbut where love is blocked, fear exists. And fear, even more than money, is the\nroot of all evil.\n\nAs a footnote to this reading, an argument can be made that the story of Cain\nand Abel is a cautionary tale of how unacknowledged and uncontrolled demons\nfrom the dark recesses of our minds (the reversed Devil card) can take joy and\na sense of oneness with the world (the World card) and corrupt it into fear\nand hate (the reversed Ace of Cups). And this is a message that remains\nrelevant for all of us, even to this day.\n\n  \n\n#  Section 4 :  \nA Sample Celtic Cross Reading\n\n  \n\nThis section presents a much longer and more complex Tarot reading than the\nones in the prior section through its use of the ten-card Celtic Cross spread.\nI have included a reading with this spread because it is referred to quite\noften in the Tarot literature and it is perhaps the spread most commonly used\nby Tarot readers.\n\nOne way in which the techniques learned in the prior section, with its twenty-\ntwo three-card readings, can be applied to the use of larger spreads is to\nconsider the smaller two to four card mini-spreads conceptually embedded\nwithin them. This technique is used in the Celtic Cross reading that follows,\nwhich demonstrates how learning to read with three-card spreads will help you\ngo on to do Tarot readings with any sized spread.\n\n  \nChapter 1\n\n##  The Celtic Cross Spread\n\nThe Celtic Cross spread, while commonly used, has a complicated structure that\nis subject to a wide variety of interpretations, which are often poorly\nunderstood. This chapter discusses some of the more common permutations of its\npositional meanings, and presents suggestions about how to use it. This will\nprepare you to understand the reading in the following chapter.\n\nIn this spread’s layout chart (see Figure 1), the card numbers indicate the\norder in which I lay out the cards, but this order is not sacrosanct by any\nmeans. In fact, you will find in the existing Tarot literature many different\nways to lay out these cards, especially cards Three through Six.\n\n![Celtic Cross spread 20pct and renamed cells.jpg](Image00063.jpg)\n\nFigure 1 Celtic Cross Spread\n\nPositional Meanings\n\nThere are various ways to interpret the ten positions of a Celtic Cross\nspread. The positional meanings presented here are ones that I prefer and that\nmake the most sense to me, although some common alternatives are mentioned as\nwell. You should, of course, evaluate these in light of whatever meanings you\nhave learned for these positions, and find what works best for you.\n\nPosition One: The central issue of the reading.\n\nThis card lies at the heart of the question and discusses what the querent\nneeds to consider about it. It can clarify aspects of the querent’s question,\nand it also may reveal unexpected details about it.\n\nPosition Two: Problems or obstacles.\n\nThe second card discusses what the querent needs to know about what is\nblocking her path with regards to the central issue of the reading. It also\nmay address other important considerations that are having an impact on this\nissue. But beyond its comments on the problems at hand, or perhaps because of\nthem, this card may also hold the seeds of advice about overcoming those\nobstacles.\n\nPosition Three: Unconscious factors.\n\nThe next card deals with issues relevant to this reading that may lie buried\nin the unconscious mind of the querent. It can be about her deep and often\nunrecognized or unacknowledged feelings and attitudes about the issue at hand,\nand as a result it can initiate discussions that may be quite delicate, so we\nshould tread softly while exploring its message. This card also may relate to\nfactors about which the querent is unaware.\n\nA common alternative meaning for this position is “Foundation.” In that case,\nthis card can illustrate factors that form the basis of the current situation.\n\nPosition Four: Past.\n\nThis card depicts influences that may be receding or that the querent needs to\nrelease. Usually this examination of what has led up to the current situation\nwill help the querent understand the central issue.\n\nPosition Five: Conscious factors.\n\nThe fifth card illustrates what the querent thinks about his situation. It\ncomments on the querent’s beliefs, preconceived notions, and attitudes\nregarding the issues of this reading, and thus it often points out the flaws\nin the querent’s thinking.\n\nSome people define this position as advice from your higher self, in which\ncase it could be called “Higher consciousness.”\n\nPosition Six: Near Future\n\nMy personal philosophy is that we always have free will and the freedom to\nmake our own choices (whether we exercise these options or not). We can choose\nthe direction in which we swim in the flow of time, even if the riptide of\nfate exerts a powerful pull in one direction. Thus, I see this card as a\ndepiction of the probable future, i.e., where things are headed if the querent\ncontinues on the path he is on now.\n\nThis card can also provide advice as to the next step that the querent needs\nto take to overcome the obstacles depicted in the second card. It can indicate\ntraits that it would behoove the querent to foster, especially if it is a\nCourt Card, and it can indicate influences that are now gaining ascendance\nthat the querent should carefully consider.\n\nPosition Seven: The querent.\n\nThe next card brings to light things about the querent that affect his\nsituation. These can be strengths he would do well to emphasize or weaknesses\nthat he needs to overcome.\n\nPosition Eight: The querent’s environment.\n\nThe eighth card may be about people in the querent’s life, or more generally,\nit can be about what is going on in the world around her, such as her physical\nenvironment or the social climate. These may be obstacles, or they might be\nthings that can help her.\n\nPosition Nine: Hopes and Fears / Guidance.\n\nHopes and fears are the expectations of the querent on either the\n&quot;good&quot; or the &quot;bad&quot; end of the spectrum. Ironically, our\nhopes and fears are often closely related even though they are opposing\naspects of the same issue. This card also may imply advice as to how the\nquerent can allay his fears or be more realistic about his hopes.\n\nPosition Ten: Probable outcome.\n\nThis card examines how the querent’s situation probably will end up, given the\ninfluences at work now and how the she is dealing with them. Of course, this\ncard also contains guidance as well. Insofar as its message may be dire, it\npresents advice for avoiding or changing the probable outcome, since\nforewarned is forearmed. On the other hand, the extent to which the message of\nthe card is favorable, it is encouragement for the querent to stay the course.\n\nReading a Celtic Cross spread\n\nThe following are suggested steps to take in doing a reading using this rather\ncomplicated spread. In general, though, they are relevant to any complex\nspread.\n\nStep One: Patterns\n\nFirst look for patterns in the cards and explain them to the querent. By this\nI mean, is there an unusual number of Major Arcana cards, Court Cards,\nreversed cards, or cards of any particular suit? What might this mean overall\nfor the reading? A high number Court Cards, for example, may indicate that\npersonality issues are important right now. A preponderance of Cups cards when\nthe question was about finances might mean that relationship issues are what\nthe querent really is concerned with or that the querent has emotional issues\nabout money. And an unusual number of reversed cards may indicate that there\nare a lot of obstacles relating to the question at hand.\n\nThis is a rather subjective and intuitive step, however, so it takes practice\nand patience to learn. But as you become better at listening to the quiet\nvoice of your intuitive mind, you will know when there is a trend worth noting\nshowing up in a spread. Also, such patterns do not always arise, so do not\nworry overmuch about looking for them. If they are there, they usually will\nfind you.\n\nStep Two: The individual cards\n\nAfter explaining any patterns I see in the spread, I generally explain the\nindividual cards, one at a time, in the order in which they were dealt. Cards\nThree through Six in the Celtic Cross, however, are an exception in that I\ngenerally explain them in a different sequence. Since Cards Three and Five\nboth deal with levels of consciousness, I discuss them together. Similarly, I\ndiscuss Cards Four and Six together since they are related chronologically.\n\nStep Three: Smaller spreads within the Celtic Cross\n\nIt is valuable to break the Celtic Cross up into a series of smaller readings\nthat can be discussed one by one with the querent. The following are a few\nsuggestions of subordinate spreads that can be used.\n\nTaken together, cards four, one, and six form a three-card “Past, Present,\nFuture” reading.\n\nCards three, one, and five can be seen as a spread that addresses different\nlevels of consciousness about a situation. This spread can be defined as\nfollows:\n\n  1. Things about your situation of which you are not aware. (Card three)\n  2. Your current situation. (Card one)\n  3. What you are conscious of and thinking about your situation. (Card five)\n\nThe central mini cross, cards one and two, may be read as a two card\n“Background, Problem” spread.\n\nA spread that expands upon this mini cross spread consists of cards one, two,\nnine, and ten. This spread can be defined as “Background, Problem, Advice, and\nProbable Outcome.” In this case, your hopes and fears (card nine) hold the\nseeds of advice that can carry you to the probable outcome. To understand why\nthat is so, consider the advice implied by the following questions: What are\nyou afraid of, and thus how can you overcome those fears? What are your hopes\nand are they reasonable? If so, how can you capitalize on them? If not, how\nshould you adjust them?\n\nFinally, considered together, cards seven and eight form a dualistic spread in\nthat they cover you and your environment, i.e., your inner reality and your\nouter reality, and the interaction between these two cards can be quite\nilluminating. Some people interpret these two cards as “How you see yourself”\nand “How other people see you,” in that order.\n\nThere are, of course, other such spreads embedded within the ten cards of the\nCeltic Cross. It can be interesting to compare cards whose positional meanings\nseem to resonate. For example, you might want to compare cards two and nine to\nsee how your obstacles relate to your hopes and fears. Or you might want to\ncompare card two to cards seven and eight to see to what extent your obstacles\ncome from inside of you (card seven) versus from your environment (card\neight).\n\nThere are a great number of permutations of these ten cards, and if you let\nyour intuition guide you, you can find clusters of cards that can help you\nfind additional meaning in the Celtic Cross spread. These smaller spreads can\nexpand upon the messages of the individual cards, and they can help you find\nan overarching message for the entire Celtic Cross spread.\n\nStep Four: Highlights and the Overall message\n\nFinally, consider all that you have covered so far. Are there any highlights\nfrom the preceding process that stand out and should be reiterated or\nreemphasized? Sometimes some of the cards seem to jump out at you either as\nyou look at the spread or in the course of discussing the cards. Similarly,\nduring some of the explanations of the smaller spreads you might feel a shiver\nof understanding run up your spine as you speak. Or you may have found that\nwhat you were saying about one particular card seemed to resonate with the\nquerent in a significant way.\n\nThen based on your overall impression from the reading, try to express what\nits basic message is and summarize the reading in terms of the question posed.\nFor example, you can restate the most noteworthy warnings that came up,\nreiterate important advice you saw in the cards, and note the general\ndirection in which the querent’s life seems to be moving.\n\n  \nChapter 2\n\n##  A Celtic Cross Reading\n\nFor my KnightHawk readings, I have tried to use people and characters that are\nreasonably familiar to the majority of my audience. Since history remembers\nwith great clarity the kings, queens, and conquerors of the past, it ensures\nthat we are familiar with the likes of Winston Churchill, Joan of Arc, and\nThomas Jefferson. As a result, historical figures such as these have been some\nof the more obvious choices for me to use.\n\nFor this Celtic Cross reading, however, I was determined to find a querent who\nhad not marched across the pages of history with such a heavy tread. I wanted\nsomeone whose influence had been subtler, because I thought a reading for such\na person would be more interesting and more personally touching. After all,\nhow many of us can identify with a question like, “Will I be successful in my\nattempt to lead my country to victory?”\n\nWith this in mind, I remembered the movie The King and I . I had assumed that\nthis tale was purely fictional, but then a nagging suspicion that this was not\nthe case prompted me to research the matter. I discovered that Anna Leonowens\nwas indeed a real person, and after I read her biography, written by Margaret\nLandon and titled Anna and the King of Siam , I knew I had found the querent\nfor my Celtic Cross reading.\n\nWhile charming and entertaining, the film versions of Anna’s life trivialized\nher experiences in the court of King Mongkut in the 1860’s, and they minimized\nher impact on the subsequent development of Siam (now called Thailand). Here\nwas a woman who changed a nation through her generosity of spirit and her\ninsightful teaching of the king’s scores of children and many of the members\nof his large harem. Especially significant was her impact on the heir\napparent, in whom Anna instilled a love of freedom and an appreciation for the\nrights of all.\n\nAs an interesting footnote, I would like to mention that in the course of\nreading her biography, I discovered that Anna had gone to an astrologer in\nIndia prior to her husband’s death. I was happy to find that there was a\nprecedent for her seeking divinatory assistance.\n\nAnd now, what follows is my reading for Anna Leonowens. Beyond its obvious\nintention of illustrating how to read a Celtic Cross spread, I hope that it\nconveys some of the greatness of this woman, and I pray that it does her\njustice.\n\n  \n\nW oman Ponders Proposal from King of Siam\n\nDear KnightHawk,\n\nSince my husband’s death two years ago, I have tried to make a living with my\nschool for British officers’ children here in Singapore. Unfortunately, my\nschool has not fared well financially, and I am concerned for the well being\nof my two children and myself.\n\nIt is under these adverse circumstances that I have been offered employment by\nthe King of Siam through one of his local agents. The King has asked me to\ncome to Siam to teach his children English, literature, and science.\n\nMy friends here in Singapore disapprove of this engagement and warn me against\nit, but I do need to make a living. I also have a sense of mission and destiny\nabout this opportunity. Siam is only now emerging from feudalism, and I feel\nthat I can make a difference in the struggle for freedom there through the\ninfluence I would have on the youth of the royal family.\n\nShall I stay here in Singapore, or should I go to work in Siam? I struggle\nwith this decision. Please, sir, what can you tell me to help me make this\ndifficult choice?\n\nWith warmest regards,  \nMrs. Anna Leonowens\n\n***\n\nDear Mrs. Leonowens,\n\nIt is an honor to do this reading for you at this difficult time in your life.\nI have dealt the following cards to see what the Tarot can tell us about your\nlife and the currents running through it in order to help you make this\nimportant decision. The following are the cards I have dealt for you:\n\n1. The central issue:    \nDeath reversed\n\n2. Problems, obstacles, and considerations:    \nJustice\n\n3. Unconscious influences:    \nSix of Coins reversed\n\n4. The past:    \nYouth of Cups reversed\n\n5. Conscious influences:    \nKnight of Swords\n\n6. The next step:    \nThe Hermit\n\n7. You:    \nTen of Cups\n\n8. Your environment:    \nKing of Wands reversed\n\n9. Hopes and fears:    \nThe Empress\n\n10. Probable outcome:    \nSix of Swords\n\n![Celtic Cross Reading.jpg](Image00064.jpg)\n\n![A Major 13 Death 33pct.JPG](Image00065.jpg)\n\nLet me start with a couple of general impressions about these cards. First, I\ndo not see anything here of dire portent. (I hasten to point out that the\nDeath card does not foretell a physical death.) Also, while the number of\nMajor Arcana cards in this reading does not seem very remarkable, the fact\nthat both cards in the inner cross (cards one and two) are from the Major\nArcana emphasizes that this is indeed a momentous decision for you.\n\nNow let’s consider the meanings of these cards individually. The Death card\nindicates a major transition for you, the death, so to speak, of one phase of\nyour life in order to make way for the birth of a new one. Being reversed,\nhowever, it acknowledges that you have some fears about making a big change\nlike this, and you face obstacles to doing so. Does it feel like you would be\ngiving up or leaving behind something precious, something that you are loath\nto release? It is important to know that this card is a promise that the new\nlife that awaits you will more than compensate for what you leave behind, just\nas the beauty of Spring compensates for the harsh difficulties of Winter.\n\nSo, what are you reluctant to leave behind? Although I said that the Death\ncard does not foretell an actual death, I see that it does, on one level,\nrefer to the death of your husband. This sad event is still affecting your\nlife and your decisions, even though its influence is waning. I see that since\nyou two had been living in t he Straits Settlements\n[[29]](text00000.html#_edn29) before your husband passed away, you are\nreluctant to leave now since it holds so many memories of him. Releasing the\npain of this loss may be something that you resist, but this card implies that\nit is time for you to do so.\n\n![A Major 11 Justice 33pct.JPG](Image00066.jpg)\n\nThe next card, Justice, comments on this issue in a variety of ways. First of\nall, there may be some legal issues that need to be resolved, and this may be\nwhat is holding you back. On a deeper level, however, this card says that\nright decisions and meaningful actions depend upon an understanding of\nourselves and of our lives. Why might that be an obstacle? Because such\nunderstanding is never easy. It calls for a careful balancing of the factors\ninvolved and for an impartial analysis of the situation at hand. Also, it is\nhard to know how long to deliberate and when to make a decision as to your\ncourse of action. In addition, I see here a recommendation to carefully\nevaluate the warnings of your friends. The Justice card urges a cautious and\nimpartial analysis of such advice, for you must be fair to yourself as well as\nto them.\n\nThere is one last, but very important, consideration about this card. You say\nthat you have a sense of destiny about this job opportunity, and one of the\nmeanings of this card is just that: Destiny. Some of us are destined to do\ngreat things, and a sense of that should never be dismissed lightly.\n\n![E Coins 06 33pct.jpg](Image00067.jpg)\n\nThe third card addresses your deep, unconscious feelings and attitudes about\nyour situation and the decision you face. The Six of Coins depicts “give and\ntake” relationships, especially those that entail or arise from qualities like\ngenerosity and charity. This card is reversed, however, which has a couple of\nimportant implications.\n\nThe illustration on this card depicts the story of St. Martin and the Beggar\nin which Martin of Tours cut his cloak in half to share with the wretched\nbeggar in order to save the life of the poor soul. This is, of course, an\nidealistic conception of such situations, and having taught British officers’\nchildren for a while now, you may have a similarly idealistic view of\nteaching, which you feel could be thrown into disarray if you teach the\nchildren of the Siamese royal family. And indeed, that teaching relationship\nmay not be nearly as orderly or as well appreciated as what you are used to.\n\nA less obvious aspect of this card is the reciprocity involved in\nrelationships of a give and take nature. You may have an unconscious\nassumption that in Siam you will teach and your students will learn, but this\nonly touches the surface of what that relationship would be like. What you may\nfind is that you will learn as much from them as they do from you.\n\nI also see in this card more than just its comments on your relationship with\nyour potential students. Something that you probably are unaware of (or\nperhaps you are subconsciously aware of it?) is that in Siam all sorts of\npeople may come to you for help and assistance. These people will be the poor,\nthe destitute, and the downtrodden, and since this card is reversed, I see\nthat helping them will be fraught with challenges for you.\n\n![D Swords 12 Knight 33pct.jpg](Image00068.jpg)\n\nCard five, the Knight of Swords, describes your conscious attitudes toward the\ndecision you are now facing. This card comments on your idealism, which\naffects your attitude toward working with the Siamese royal family. You think\nthat you can make a difference there, which is laudable, of course. However, I\nalso see in this card a cautionary note against rushing into situations there,\nimpelled by your idealism. You may dash heedlessly into a storm if you do, so\ntake care to avoid being quixotic in your endeavors. On the other hand, if you\ncan hold on to the better qualities of this knight, such as the ability to be\narticulate, incisive, and persuasive, you should do well, for these skills\nwill be able to rescue you from troubled circumstances.\n\n![C Cups 11 Youth 33pct.jpg](Image00069.jpg)\n\nLet’s now turn to the reversed Youth of Cups, which explains what has led up\nto your present circumstances and what you are moving away from. First of all,\nthis card is a depiction of young love that has been shattered unexpectedly.\nPerhaps, then, it is the suddenness with which your husband passed away that\nmakes it so hard for you to let go and move on.\n\nThis card also says that you will have to leave behind your innocence of heart\nin order to make the transition in your life that you now need to make. This\nis not to say that you should harden your heart. Rather, this card urges you\nto move forward on a path of emotional maturity along which it says you are\nmoving already. Indeed, establishing your school has helped you begin the\nprocess of healing and emotional growth, but this card asks if maybe more is\nstill needed.\n\nIn addition, this card indicates that an innocent love such as what you felt\nfor your late husband is now a thing of the past; you may never fall in love\nlike that again. But other kinds of love that are equally fulfilling certainly\nawait you to whatever extent you are open to them.\n\n![A Major 09 Hermit 33pct.JPG](Image00070.jpg)\n\nThe card on the opposite side of this cross, the Hermit, shows where you are\nheaded. Whereas the Youth of Cups is indicative of the innocent, romantic love\nof youth, the Hermit reflects a mature love of truth and spiritual\ndevelopment. In fact, compare the pictures on these two cards. The Youth gazes\nadoringly at a cup as if contemplating a new love, while the Hermit gazes\ntoward the heavens, as if contemplating enlightenment.\n\nThe Hermit indicates that to move forward in your life you would do well to\nfollow the guidance of your higher self. You face a decision that you need to\nmake alone; your friends cannot make it for you. The Hermit also shows that\nyou are moving beyond being just a teacher. You are ready now to become a\nmentor and a guide for both minds and souls, so you may want to ask yourself,\nwhich does that description fit best: your job teaching British officers’\nchildren in Singapore or a position teaching the royal family of Siam?\n\nA final message of this card is that there may be some loneliness ahead for\nyou, but you need not fear it, for it is not the type of loneliness that\nbrings sadness. Rather, it is a necessary element of your journey toward truth\nand accomplishment.\n\n![C Cups 10 33pct.jpg](Image00071.jpg)\n\nThe Ten of Cups depicts considerations about your life that are important and\nrelevant to your situation. I see that this card is closely related to the\ncentral issue of this reading as noted in the first two cards (i.e.,\ndifficulties in making a major transition). It says that you are holding on to\nthe life you used to have. You still see yourself in that phase of your life.\nThis interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the couple in this card are\nsleeping peacefully, dreaming perhaps of the ideal life that once was.\n\nAlso, I see the rainbow in this card as being a promise that new joy awaits\nyou, although at this point you may not be able to see what form it will take.\nLike the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the benefits of where you are\nheaded are still hidden from view. So this card says that it is hard for you\nto leave Singapore with its memories and ties to your past, but perhaps you\nneed to release it and move on so that you can find that pot of gold.\n\n![B Wands 14 King 33pct.jpg](Image00072.jpg)\n\nYour environment is depicted by the reversed King of Wands. This king is a\nbold leader, but when this card is reversed, he can be overly demanding or\neven rather despotic. This could relate to someone in your life in Singapore,\nor to the general political climate in the East, but I think it most likely\nthat it describes the King of Siam, especially since this card is a king. (I\nassume that the King of Siam is the only monarch having a direct impact on\nyour life at this time.)\n\nIn that case, this card says that the King of Siam is self-confident to an\nextreme level. He is overly sure of his rightness, brooking no contradiction,\nand he pushes himself and everyone around him to their limit. However, if you\ncan tolerate his insufferable ego, you will find him to be a dynamic and\nforceful leader as well. He can be a powerful friend and ally as long as you\nare careful to remain in his good graces.\n\n![A Major 03 Empress 33pct.jpg](Image00021.jpg)\n\nThe Empress, which we find in the position of your hopes and fears, is a card\nthat indicates nurturing and creativity, and it is a basic depiction of\nmotherhood as well. This card expresses your hope that you can nurture the\ngrowth and development of the Siamese royal children, and that you can foster\na new environment in Siam through that effort. Similarly, the title of this\ncard may suggest what you hope for in your role there, since teaching the\nKing’s children will make you almost a surrogate mother to them and thus lend\nyou some aspects of an Empress of the country.\n\nOn the other hand, this card suggests that you fear that this move may have an\nadverse impact on your children. Perhaps you are wondering if you can be a\ngood mother in that strange environment. This is a natural concern. However,\ngiven all that I have seen so far in this reading, I see in this card a vivid\ndepiction of you as a strong woman who is a caring, supportive, and nurturing\nmother as well, and this card should allay such fears.\n\n![D Swords 06 33pct.jpg](Image00073.jpg)\n\nThe final card, the Six of Swords, is the probable outcome of your current\nsituation. It depicts where the currents of your life are taking you at this\ntime. However, you should be aware that you can either resist or enhance your\nmovement in this direction through the exercise of your free will.\n\nOn a mundane level, this card indicates travel over water and a journey to a\nnew environment. There is, however, a very somber air to this card, which is\nindicative of your reluctance or lack of certainty about relocating to Siam.\nIt is important, then, to note that this card implies that there will be new\nopportunities at the end of this journey, and you can gain new perspectives\nfrom it.\n\nThe serene passage implied by this card is relevant on both a psychological\nand a spiritual level. Psychologically, it shows you passing through difficult\ntimes with serenity and a stoic calm. Thus, this is both advice and\nreassurance for you if you do face troubled times in Siam. On a spiritual\nlevel, the Six of Swords depicts a passage for you as well. The days and years\nahead have the potential to bring you experiences from which you may grow to\nfind a deep and abiding sense of peace.\n\nNow let us consider several important clusters of cards within this spread.\nThe interactions between the cards in these clusters will provide additional\ninsights into this reading.\n\nWe will begin with cards four (Youth of Cups reversed), one (Death reversed),\nand six (The Hermit). Taken together, these cards depict your Past, Present,\nand Future. Succinctly, these cards say that the loss of your young husband\nhas brought you to a major life transition that is difficult for you, from\ninnocence to maturity. Although this loss has left you alone, it also has led\nyou to some valuable soul searching that ultimately will bring you consolation\nas you find wisdom and a soulful strength within yourself.\n\nCards three, one, and five form a spread that deals with both the conscious\nand the unconscious aspects of your current situation. We can consider it like\nthis:\n\n1. Your unconscious motivations:    \nSix of Coins reversed\n\n2. Your current situation:    \nDeath reversed\n\n3. Your conscious motivations:    \nKnight of Swords\n\nThe reversed Six of Coins indicates what is causing you to resist making the\nimportant change indicated by the Death card. It says that you feel needed at\nyour current school, despite its lack of financial success, and you are\nreluctant to leave that. Running your school for British officers’ children\ngives you an easy sense of helping others that is hard to give up.\n\nOn the other hand, the Knight of Swords reiterates what you said about being\nconscious of a sense of mission and destiny in the opportunity to teach the\nKing of Siam’s family, and so you may feel an urge to rush in there, like a\ncrusader. Thus, you are experiencing a powerful internal conflict, and this\ntension between your conscious and unconscious motivations is making your\ndecision difficult.\n\nHowever, perhaps becoming more aware of your unconscious motivations and\nseeing the Knight of Swords’ clear depiction of your conscious motivations\nwill help you evaluate the major life transition you face. Also, can you see a\nsimilarity between this Knight and the Six of Coins? Both can be seen as\ndepicting someone trying to help others. So relating your sense of mission to\nthe Six of Coins indicates that your generosity can be valuable in Siam too,\nand you will feel needed there as well.\n\nNow let us consider cards seven (Ten of Cups) and eight (King of Wands\nreversed) as representing your inner reality versus your outer reality.\nInside, you hold on to the dream of a blissful family life, while the world\naround you has been shaped by the loss of a strong, charismatic man— your late\nhusband. Inside, you want the contentment of a happy home life, but the world\naround you demands boldness and assertiveness, qualities that you either are\nafraid to express or fear you lack.\n\nIn these two cards we see a stark contrast between your idealized view of\nrelationships and the harsh reality around you. The world around you in\ngeneral—and some people in particular—can be willful and capricious, and these\ntwo cards together urge you to temper your innocent way of dealing with others\nwith the best characteristics of the King of Wands. Stand up for what you need\nand for what you believe in, responsibly lead others with your strength of\nwill, and remain positive and confident in the face of adversity. If you can\nmanifest these positive qualities of the King of Wands, you will be able to\nwithstand the negative side of this card when you encounter it in people\naround you.\n\nFinally, let us consider four cards—cards one, two, nine, and ten—that we can\nconsider as making up the following spread:\n\n1. The background of your situation:    \nDeath reversed\n\n2. The problem you face:    \nJustice\n\n3. Advice regarding your problem:    \nThe Empress\n\n4. The probable outcome:    \nSix of Swords\n\nAgain, your recent loss has brought you to a difficult transition period, and\nyou must leave something behind in order to find something new and better.\nThis is very hard to do, and the Justice card says that in order to decide how\nto proceed, you should make a careful evaluation of the situation at hand. You\nare balancing the needs of others—such as your friends in Singapore and your\nchildren—against your own needs and your sense of what is right to do.\nUnfortunately, the scales have not yet tipped in either direction. Like Lady\nJustice pictured in this card, you are poised to act, but you remain seated,\nso to speak.\n\nConsider then that perhaps you are over-deliberating. To know how to make the\nright decision, you seek a rational, logical analysis that takes all factors\ninto consideration. In reality, however, you are at a point where, according\nto the Empress, you need to follow your heart. Indeed, the advice of the\nEmpress is to listen to your heart, for it will show you the way and guide you\n(metaphorically speaking) to the beautiful Spring that must follow the bleak\nWinter of the Death card.\n\nThe probable outcome (Six of Swords) shows a voyage of new beginnings. There\nis an almost bittersweet feeling to making this trip, but there is also a\npromise of a brighter future as you now have a chance to move forward with\nyour life. Also, when the image on the Six of Swords is considered in light of\nthe Death card, it seems to be a haunting allusion to Charon ferrying souls\nacross the mythical river Styx. Consequently, the implication is that going to\nSiam will bring you to completely unknown territory, in a psychological as\nwell as spiritual sense. It will mark a transition to an entirely new phase of\nyour life, and although there is a melancholy mood to this card, I see in it\nthat you have a chance here to leave behind the sorrow of your past losses.\n\nIn summary, let me reiterate some of the advice that came up in this reading.\n\nShould you decide to work with the King of Siam’s children, beware of having\nan idealistic view of teaching them, for this may prove to be a less orderly\nprocess than you expect. Beware also the challenges of being a benefactor to\nthe needy of Siam. Whenever someone appeals to you for aid, remember that an\nincisive evaluation and a persuasive argument will help you far more than\ndashing in on an idealistic crusade. But most of all, you must be cautious of\nthe King’s demanding and volatile nature and of his capricious whims. Your\nability to be nurturing and to find creative solutions should go far in\nhelping you deal with him, as will your strength of character and\nassertiveness.\n\nFinally, I want to close with some words about your specific question. You\nasked for help in deciding if you should stay in Singapore or go to Siam.\nWhile this is, of course, a decision that you must make for yourself, there\nare a few important points raised in this reading that can help you make your\ndecision. Your life is primed for a major transition right now, although it is\na difficult one and therefore one that you may fear or resist. Although the\ndecision you face requires careful evaluation, ultimately you must pay heed to\nthe guidance of your heart and soul. And consider well your sense of destiny\nregarding the King of Siam’s offer of employment.\n\nBest of luck to you,\n\nKnightHawk\n\n  \nChapter 3\n\n##  Comments on a Celtic Cross Reading\n\nThis chapter discusses the Celtic Cross reading for Anna Leonowens, offering a\nvariety of insights into the art of Tarot that this reading demonstrates.\n\n###  General notes\n\nAs mentioned in s ection 2, chapter 4, Rephrasing the Question , I avoid\ntelling people what to do in a reading, tempting though that may be when that\nis what has been requested. It was especially tempting to do so in this\nreading wherein obvious recommendations seemed to present themselves, but\ninstead options were explored and suggestions, but not directives, were made.\n\nThe reading for Anna Leonowens was replete with answers to the querent’s\nquestion about going to Siam, from the reversed Death card’s message about\nresisted transformation to the imagery of travel over water that was obvious\nin the Six of Swords, the probable outcome card. In addition, some cards, such\nas the Hermit and the King of Wands, seemed to discuss Anna’s employment in\nSiam as if going there was a foregone conclusion. Nevertheless, I tried to\nconvey these messages without hitting Anna over the head with the suggestion\nthat she should go to Siam.\n\nThis illustrates the fact that we have to allow a querent the freedom (and\nresponsibility) to make her own decisions, and we have to trust her to hear\nthe message of the reading and then act upon it appropriately.\n\nSometimes as the cards are laid out, patterns or trends show up that can lend\ndirection and insight to a reading from the start. Let’s say you notice that\nthere is a preponderance of one particular suit. This can indicate that maybe\nthe focus of the reading should be determined by the meaning of that suit.\nSimilarly, it can be noteworthy if there are a significant number of Court\nCards, or Major Arcana cards, or reversed cards. Of course, this begs the\nquestion, what is a “significant number” of these types of cards?\n\nThe quick and easy answer is that it is significant if it catches your\nattention. While this intuitive approach is satisfying for some Tarot readers,\nothers prefer a more scientific analysis. It is beyond the scope of this book\nto delve into an explanation of the statistics behind what constitutes a\nsignificant percentage of each type of card, but as a general rule of thumb,\nwe can compare the percentage of a specific type of card in the deck versus\nthe percentage in a reading.\n\nAs a specific example, approximately half of the cards in a Tarot deck are\n“pip cards” (Ace through Ten), yet in Anna’s reading only about thirty percent\nof the cards were pip cards. This might have implied that this reading was\nmore about personality issues (Court Cards) and spiritual or archetypal forces\n(Major Arcana cards) than about the mundane events of life (pip cards).\nHowever, the significance of thirty percent versus fifty percent did not seem\nremarkable enough to mention, although I did bear it in mind. In fact, though,\nthe details of this reading did end up reflecting the focus indicated by the\npaucity of pip cards. On the other hand, both of the cards in the inner cross\n(Cards One and Two) were Major Arcana cards, which did seem significant enough\nto mention.\n\n  \n\n###  The individual cards\n\nDeath reversed\n\nWhile I am extremely wary of seeing the Death card as a prediction of an\nactual death, it’s not rare to have this card comment on a death already noted\nby the querent. In this case, I saw this card as saying that Anna’s husband’s\ndeath still was affecting her, but with this card reversed, I saw that it was\na waning influence, although it remained troublesome.\n\nA couple other cards influenced my interpretation of the Death card. The\nreversed Youth of Cups reinforced the message of the loss of a loved one,\nwhile the Six of Swords, which can indicate a spiritual passage that takes us\nout of troubled waters, reinforced the Death card’s advice that it was time\nfor Anna to move on and release the pain of her loss.\n\nNote that the Death card often can indicate the pain of a loss (which can be\nany kind of loss, including that of a relationship, a home, a job, etc.), the\nneed for mourning it, and finally the need to move on and release that pain.\nAt some point, such pain can and should be released, but how to do that can be\nquite a difficult and complicated process, one that may be outside the scope\nof a Tarot reading. (In such cases, I try to refer the querent to professional\nhelp if it seems appropriate.)\n\nJustice\n\nThe Justice card was one of the more difficult cards in this spread to\ninterpret, being in the position of “Problems or Obstacles.” Legal\ncomplications can be one of the more obvious interpretations of this card, and\nthey could have been one of the obstacles standing in Anna’s way, although\nnone were mentioned in her biography. That does not mean there were none, of\ncourse, but it did keep me from expanding upon that line of inquiry.\n[[30]](text00000.html#_edn30)\n\nThe second card in the Celtic Cross is rather unique in that it is laid on its\nside, and as a result many Tarot readers do not consider it to be either\nreversed or upright. Consequently, I usually see more of the problematic\naspects of whatever card turns up in this position, just because of its\npositional meaning.\n\nIn my initial card-by-card pass through this spread, I said as much as I could\nabout what this card seemed to be saying. Then I trusted that if it had more\nto say, it would tell me later. This is often the best way to deal with cards\nthat do not say as much as we might want them to. Once we turn our conscious\nattention elsewhere, our intuitive mind will work on it for us. Sure enough,\nwhen I returned to this card while considering one of the imbedded mini-\nspreads (which are discussed below), I found further insights into its message\nfor this reading.\n\nSix of Coins reversed\n\nThe Six of Coins depicts a well-dressed figure benignly bestowing money upon a\nhumble and appreciative supplicant. Since it was reversed, I saw that its\nenergy was being distorted in a couple of ways. First of all, it depicted\nAnna’s unconscious assumption that being charitable would be well appreciated\nand that it would be an orderly process, which I saw could work to her\ndetriment. As it turned out, while in Siam, Anna often found herself in a\nposition to give alms to beggars. Once, however, when she generously gave alms\nto a man, she and her son were besieged by a mob of beggars and almost\ntrampled. Luckily, she and her son were saved at the last minute from the\navaricious crowd, but her unconscious assumption had almost led her to\ngrievous harm.\n\nI also told Anna, “These people will be the poor, the destitute, and the\ndowntrodden, and since this card is reversed, I see that helping them will be\nfraught with challenges for you,” and indeed, this was often the case. After\nAnna helped one poor woman receive justice—and did so against quite daunting\nodds—she was constantly inundated with supplicants begging her to champion\ntheir cause with the King, assuming her to have his ear, which sometimes she\ndid. However, King Mongkut tended to be quite capricious in his dispensation\nof justice, and her applications to him were just as likely to incur his wrath\nas they were to be met with the results she desired.\n\nThe give and take relationship indicated by the Six of Coins may include the\ndissemination of knowledge as well as of money, and in this reading the nearby\nHermit (which sometimes indicates a teacher) reinforced this interpretation.\nThen, since the Six of Coins was reversed, I stated, “Having taught British\nofficers’ children for a while now, you may have a similarly idealistic view\nof teaching...” In fact, the royal children of Siam were often a rowdy and\nunruly bunch, and again, as with her experience with the mob of beggars,\nAnna’s assumption of orderliness—this time with regards to her teaching—was\nturned upside down.\n\nYouth of Cups reversed\n\n“This card is a depiction of young love that has been shattered unexpectedly.”\nI realized that this statement would not be news to Anna Leonowens, but it was\nan important point to bring up in the discussion since the unexpected death of\nher husband had been such a pivotal event in her life. More than that, this\nreading indicated that it was continuing to play a crucial role in her current\ndecision process.\n\nBy definition, the card in this position in the Celtic Cross, the Past, has a\ntendency to depict events of which the querent is already aware. So what is\nits importance in a reading? Whatever this card depicts is an important clue\nas to how the querent got to where she is now, and it sheds light on what is\ncurrently affecting her life and on the central issue of the reading.\n\nThis particular card, the reversed Youth of Cups, sheds light on why Anna was\nreluctant to move from Singapore to Siam. Prior to this, she had moved often\nand to many an exotic locale, all apparently without the hesitation that now\nmarked her decision. This card said that the difference was that this time her\nlife and her decision were being affected profoundly by her husband’s untimely\ndeath.\n\nThe Youth of Cups also can depict a new love or an innocence of heart, but its\nreversal affected these meanings in a couple of ways: loss and decrease. As\nnoted above, this card signified the loss of a young love, but it also\nindicated that Anna’s innocence of heart was diminishing. Indeed, Anna’s\nemotional maturity grew and strengthened while she was in Siam as she learned\nto deal with the capricious and self-centered royalty on the one hand, and the\ndowntrodden masses on the other. Her heart remained open and generous, but it\nbecame wise, strong, and assertive as well.\n\nWith the Youth of Cups reversed, I also saw that Anna was already leaving this\nstage of her emotional development behind. She had begun to travel the long\npath from being a despairing widow toward becoming the strong, independent,\nand mature woman she was destined to be by the end of her tenure in Siam.\n\nKnight of Swords\n\nThere is a fine line between acting upon your ideals and being quixotic, and\nthe dashing and volatile Knight of Swords, who does not yet possess the\ndiscerning wisdom of a Queen or King, can end up on one side of that line as\neasily as on the other. Since he can be just as apt to display his negative\naspects as his positive ones, I often see both warnings and advice in this\ncard.\n\nThis variability was evident in Anna Leonowens as well. Even before going to\nSiam, she was conscious of, and dismayed by, the feudalism and slavery that\nexisted there. While living there, she frequently worked to secure fairness\nand justice for the oppressed commoners who sought her aid, and often she was\nable to do so. From time to time, however, she did err on the side of being\ntoo idealistic, at which times her efforts tended to be thwarted. But like a\nknight at his best, she was able to learn from her mistakes and to become a\nwiser person for having done so.\n\nThis, then, points out what may be the greatest strength of the four Knights\nof the Tarot deck: their courage to dare great deeds, their willingness to\nmake mistakes in doing them, and their eagerness and ability to learn from\nthose mistakes rather than dwelling on them and bemoaning them.\n\nThe Hermit\n\nThere is a marked difference between solitude and loneliness, but either may\nbe indicated by the Hermit card, depending on the circumstances of the reading\nin which it shows up. It is more common that I see solitude than loneliness in\nthis card, but in this reading, an interpretation of loneliness was reinforced\nby the melancholy mood of the Six of Swords, the probable outcome card. And in\nfact, Anna sometimes did feel lonely and despondent in Siam, although she\nnever let that defeat her. Instead, such feelings were just the darkness\nthrough which she had to travel in order to achieve greatness.\n\nThis discussion brings up an important point about cards Six and Ten of the\nCeltic Cross. These two card positions, the Probable Future and the Probable\nOutcome, are closely related, and it is often interesting to compare them. In\nthis case, these two cards considered together implied that Anna was headed\nfor a journey of soulful discovery that would be rewarding despite its\nloneliness.\n\nTen of Cups\n\nIn the course of explaining to Anna the significance of the Ten of Cups, I\nsaid, “... the couple in this card are sleeping peacefully, dreaming perhaps\nof the ideal life that once was.” But are they dreaming of what was or of what\nthey hope will be? Of course, it is all a matter of perspective, and this is\none of those wonderful ambiguities of the Tarot that allows our intuition to\npick the interpretation that fits the best. Another notable feature of this\ncard is its rainbow. Does a rainbow indicate illusion or promise ... or both?\nThis is a very subjective question, and again we have to let our intuition\ndecide.\n\nKing of Wands reversed\n\nI typically see the primary focus of the Court Cards as being on the\npersonality and characteristics of the querent. A significant exception to\nthat is when a Court Card comes up in the eighth position of the Celtic Cross,\nwhich relates to the querent’s environment and the people around her. In this\nparticular reading, I could hardly have drawn a more appropriate card for the\nKing of Siam. King Mongkut was a very dynamic and forceful leader, but he was\nimpulsive, as absolute monarchs often are, and he was egotistical to the point\nthat his inability to take criticism was legendary throughout the foreign\ncommunity in Siam. (Fortunately, Anna was forewarned of this fact upon her\narrival there.) He often drove those around him, including Anna, to\nexhaustion, although he expected no less of himself. The difference was that\nhis energy seemed limitless. All of these qualities seem to fit this card to\nperfection if we consider that being reversed, the characteristics of the King\nof Wands may tend toward absurd or problematic extremes.\n\nThe Empress\n\nWhen I first began using the Celtic Cross, I had the most trouble\nunderstanding position nine, Hopes and Fears. Was the card in this position to\nbe interpreted as both hopes and fears? Or might it be either one or the\nother? This card may address both issues—hopes and fears—or it may address one\nbut not the other. Let your intuition guide you. Usually, however, if I dig\ndeep enough, I can find both aspects, since typically our hopes and fears\nabout a given situation are inextricably bound together. In this reading, Anna\nhad both hopes and fears regarding the nurturing and mothering aspects of her\nprospective job, as indicated by the Empress.\n\nAs an alternative approach to interpreting this position, we can use the\ncard’s orientation to determine which aspect, hopes or fears, to give more\nweight in a reading. Thus, if the card is reversed, we may emphasize what it\nsays about the querent’s fears, otherwise, emphasize her hopes. This is,\nhowever, just a suggestion, but you might want to try it and see if it works\nfor you.\n\nSix of Swords\n\nThere are several cards that typically are seen as indicating travel, such as\nthe Fool, the Chariot, the Eight of Cups, the Eight of Wands, and this card,\nthe Six of Swords. Of course, I do not always see travel in such cards, but I\nam more likely to do so if that is the issue at hand, which was the case in\nthis reading. It’s particularly remarkable that of these “travel” cards, it\nwas the Six of Swords that came up since it is the one best suited to an ocean\nvoyage, and it was by ship that Anna traveled to Siam.\n\nOn a deeper level, this card showed Anna “passing through difficult times with\nserenity and a stoic calm.” Frequently Anna encountered resistance to her\nefforts to help the people of Siam, but calm diplomacy in the face of\nadversity got her through many a difficult situation. She probably would not\nhave lasted long in the royal Siamese court had she not cultivated that\ntalent.\n\n###  Embedded mini-spreads\n\nThe Past, Present, Future spread made up of cards four, one, and six is\nprobably the most obvious mini-spread embedded within the Celtic Cross, and in\nthis particular reading, the basic message it provided could well summarize\nthe entire reading. Another one illustrates how the consideration of such\nmini-spreads can bring to light an insightful card comparison. Consider cards\none, two, nine, and ten as follows:\n\n1. The background of your situation:    \nDeath reversed\n\n2. The problem you face:    \nJustice\n\n3. Advice regarding your problem:    \nThe Empress\n\n4. The probable outcome:    \nSix of Swords\n\nAs I read this spread, I was happily surprised to find an additional insight\ninto how the Justice card could be problematic here. This understanding came\nto me when I saw the advice of the Empress, which was that Anna should follow\nthe dictates of her heart (versus those of her mind). This reminded me that\nthe Justice card is astrologically related to Libra, and since I am a Libra I\nknow firsthand how a willingness to consider all sides of an argument can turn\nany decision into a difficult process if you are not careful.\n\n###  Conclusions\n\nMuch of what I see while doing my KnightHawk readings is relevant to what I\nalready know about the querent and the question for the reading, but I usually\nlearn something new and unexpected as well. Sometimes I gain new psychological\nor spiritual insights into life in general, while other times I find\nremarkable glimpses into the life of the querent.\n\nIn the case of this reading for Anna Leonowens, I came to realize the strong\ninfluence that her husband’s death still had on her when she was offered a job\nin the court of the King of Siam. In fact, this seemed to be a big reason for\nher reluctance to leave Singapore and move on to this amazing opportunity. I\nalso saw that her experiences in Siam were to bring her out of mourning and\ntransform her life. Indeed, she was a very different person after working in\nSiam for a few short years, as if a journey of awakening (as seen in the final\noutcome card, the Six of Swords) had finally come to completion. While in\nSiam, Anna helped transform a nation through her influence on the King and his\nchildren, and in return, Siam changed her as well.\n\n###  Postscript\n\nIn July of 1867, after working for about five years in the court of King\nMongkut, Anna Leonowens left Siam and returned to England. For health reasons,\nshe needed to spend time in a more temperate climate than that of Siam. In\naddition, she wanted to enroll her son in an English school, and she deeply\ndesired to see her daughter again. Although her leave of absence was\noriginally intended to be temporary, Anna never returned to Siam. She went on\nto write about her exotic experiences there, and enjoyed a long career as a\nteacher as well as a writer and lecturer.\n\n  \n\n#  Section 5 :  \nAfterword\n\n  \n\nAs I worked on the readings in this book, I often found that they addressed\nuniversal truths that transcended the specific question covered in the\nreading. Perhaps this was because these were hypothetical questions, but I\ndoubt it, for this happens in “real life” readings too. More likely it is\nbecause when we dig deeply enough, we find that at some level we are all one,\nand there are universal truths in each of our individual journeys.\n\nWe share the common heritage of our culture, the common nature of our species,\nand the common spirituality of life itself. And regardless of our disparate\nsocial backgrounds, our physical differences, or the unique journey of our\nindividual souls, we are bonded by our humanity and spirituality. We all\nsuffer pain and loss, we all enjoy love and laughter, we all have physical\nneeds and desires, and we all need to understand the meaning of our lives.\n\nThe threads running through the readings in this book are spun from specific\nsituations in various stories and biographies, yet these same threads can be\nfound woven into the tapestry of our own lives as well. We each may see a\nslightly different warp and weave in these readings, based upon our individual\npoints of view, but we can recognize in them similarities to the patterns in\nour lives as well. And thus we may find these readings relevant to our own\npersonal triumphs and tragedies.\n\nFor example, the advice for dealing with one specific instance of loss has an\nelement of universal appeal because at one time or another, we all have lost\nsomeone or something dear to us. Also, comments on the theme of love are as\nuniversal and timeless as they are ubiquitous in human history, art, and\nliterature.\n\nMy original intent in writing this book was merely to collect and comment on\nsome of the best of my “Ask KnightHawk” readings in hopes of providing a book\nthat was both entertaining and informative. But the gentle hand of fate often\nnudges us in directions of its own choosing, and this book has branched out in\nunexpected ways. I have learned much about myself and about my fellow human\nbeings through the process of writing this book. I can but hope and pray that\nthrough reading it, you have too.\n\n  \n\n#  Section 6:  \nAppendices\n\n  \n\nAppendix 1\n\n##  Comments on the Seventy-eight Tarot Cards\n\nPresented here are comments on the seventy-eight Tarot cards. Although I have\nincluded them in this book primarily for beginning Tarot students, hopefully\nthey will provide a new insight or two for more experienced Tarot readers as\nwell.\n\nNote that I am not claiming to have presented the meanings of the cards, for\nthere are no definitive meanings. Any book you read, any class you take, or\nany mentor you learn from can only give you someone else’s view of what the\ncards mean. Indeed, as you continue your exploration of the Tarot, you\ninevitably will find disagreement as to the interpretations of these cards.\n[[31]](text00000.html#_edn31) Ultimately, you will find that any authority you\nlisten to and any book you read—this one included—is merely a guide to finding\nthe truths that you will discover inside your own heart while using the cards\nthemselves.\n\nFor the Major Arcana cards, in addition to a general discussion of its\nmeaning, I have suggested keywords for it, and I have provided a quote that\nsheds light on the card’s meaning.\n\nFor all of the cards, I have included an example of an affirmation that you\nmay use with it [[32]](text00000.html#_edn32) and advice that it may offer in\na reading. These affirmations and pieces of advice arose from an exercise that\nI like to do whenever I get a new deck. I draw one card per day, and then in\nlight of what is going on in my life, I look for its message of the day.\n\nIn support of your own efforts with this type of exercise, the sample\naffirmations and advice that I have included should give you a taste of the\npossibilities available, but these suggestions are only a starting point.\nHopefully you will find them helpful, but discovering for yourself what\nguidance each card has to offer is a useful exercise in and of itself.\n\nAgain, the comments that I have provided for the cards are meant to be\nsignposts along the journey, not the destination itself. Use them to nourish\nyour own exploration of the cards, helping it to grow and blossom in its own\nunique way. This process of discovery is part of the excitement and gift of\nthe Tarot, and with any luck, it is a process that will continue for the rest\nof your life.\n\nFinally, a note on nomenclature and imagery. The names of the cards in the\nMajor Arcana, the suits in the Minor Arcana, and the hierarchy of the Court\nCards vary from deck to deck. What I have used here is the most common system,\nbut the meanings offered apply regardless of the naming convention. The\nimagery that I reference in these card discussions is generally that of either\nthe Rider Waite Smith (RWS) deck, which is currently the most ubiquitous deck,\nor my own Tarot of the Masters .\n\n  \n\n###  The Major Arcana\n\n0. The Fool\n\n“A ship is safe in harbor, but that is not what a ship is for.” — Thomas\nAquinas\n\nKeywords\n\nLeap of faith, taking risks, potential\n\nComments\n\nA leap of faith catapults the Fool into the unknown. This can be a bit\nfrightening, to be sure, but it also leads him to joy and adventure, and\neventually, if he sticks with it, to enlightenment and liberation. Such an\nundertaking also requires the Fool to trust his instincts, so this card can\nindicate a trusting nature and a sense of joyful wonder.\n\nPeople with a free spirit may seem like a fool to the rest of the world, yet\ntheir lack of inhibitions or their disregard for social norms are what empower\nthem to see the world with a fresh perspective and to discover its wondrous\nbeauty. W hen they take a chance, they may fall flat on their face as a\nresult, but they may succeed brilliantly, and that makes it all worthwhile.\nAfter all, if babies were afraid to fall, none of us would know how to walk.\n\nOn a more mundane level, this card can indicate a wanderer and a “rolling\nstone,” or an impending journey or adventure. However, considering the Fool as\na wanderer can lead us back to a more spiritual interpretation, since journeys\nin myths often symbolize a search for something such as the purpose or meaning\nlife.\n\nAdvice\n\nThink about something that you would love to do with your life, but that you\nare afraid of trying. What are you really afraid of? Consider what it will\ntake for you to trust your instincts and to believe in your dreams, and\nremember the saying, “When you leap, the net will appear.”\n\nAffirmation\n\nI’m willing to take a leap of faith for I know that m y life is a wonderful\nand divine adventure.\n\n1\\. The Magician\n\n“In everything natural there is something marvelous.” — Aristotle\n\nKeywords\n\nTalent, skill, creativity, consciousness, will-power\n\nComments\n\nThe Magician, as depicted in a great many decks, has the tools he needs in\nfront of him, and the implication is that he has the skill to use them. The\nMagician can have a bit of a trickster quality too, however, being sly and\ncunning as well as skillful. So we may wonder sometimes if his magic is just\nsleight of hand.\n\nThe position of the Magician’s hands, one held up toward the heavens and one\npointing down toward the earth, implies the ancient hermetic principle, “As\nabove, so below. ” This can refer to being inspired by, and a conduit for, the\ndivine energy of the universe (“as above…”) in order to actively manifest our\ndreams and aspirations on the physical plane (“… so below”).\n\nThe Magician card graphically depicts this ability to be a conduit for a\nhigher power and to channel such spiritual energy into the material world. In\naddition, it has an element of investing the material world with a spiritual\nessence, because it is not only what we do, but how we do it that counts. This\ncard says that if we treat our work—everything we do, in fact—with respect and\nreverence, and if we consider it to be a spiritual undertaking, we will imbue\nthe results with a touch of the Divine.\n\nSimilarly, an esoteric interpretation of this card is the power o f your\nattention. It says that whatever you pay attention to increases, so it urges\nus to focus our attention on the positive aspects of life.\n\nThe Magician seeks to fulfill his purpose through active involvement with\nlife, as opposed to the next figure we will meet, the High Priestess, who\nturns inward to find meaning.\n\nAdvice\n\nAlbert Einstein said, “There are two ways to live your life. One is as though\nnothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.” Look\nfor the miraculous in all that you experience, and invest everything you do\nwith a sense of the miraculous. In so doing, you can become a conduit for the\nmagical, creative energy of the Universe.\n\nAffirmation\n\nThe power of the Universe flows through me and into everything I do.\n\n2. The High Priestess\n\n“The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful\nservant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten\nthe gift.” — Albert Einstein\n\nKeywords\n\nMysteries of life, intuition, the unconscious\n\nComments\n\nThe High Priestess sits between temple pillars that have a dark/light,\nyin/yang aspect. Thus, she indicates finding a middle path between opposites\nor seeing through the illusion of duality. Existing in a state of inner peace\nand harmony, she turns inward in order to tap into an intuitive understanding\nof the ineffable mysteries of the human soul. Also, the lunar aspect of this\ncard indicates that she listens to her dreams and accepts the inevitability of\nnatural cycles.\n\nThis card is often compared to several other Major Arcana cards, and it is\ninstructive to consider such comparisons. The Magician indicates activity, but\npassive receptivity is used by the High Priestess. And while the Magician\ndepicts the conscious mind, the High Priestess refers to the subtle working of\nthe unconscious mind through which she makes decisions of the heart and soul.\nThe High Priestess is the embodiment of a personal discovery of the esoteric\naspects of spirituality, as opposed to learning from an external source the\nexoteric aspects of orthodox religion, which is the domain of the Hierophant.\nThe Hermit searches for meaning by a physical retreat from society, but the\nHigh Priestess’s retreat in search of understanding is psychological. Finally,\nthe Empress symbolizes the warm, sensual aspects of the feminine principle,\nwhile the High Priestess indicates the cool, intuitive mysteries of\nfemininity. And while the Empress is in touch with her sexuality, the High\nPriestess is more likely to represent virginity, or even repressed sexuality.\n\nAdvice\n\nThe Universe is eternally oracular, and all around us there are omens and\nportents giving advice about our spiritual journey. So be open to seeing the\ndeeper, soulful meaning of all that happens to you. This will bring you closer\nto understanding the hidden truths of the Universe and of your soul.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI can hear the whispered voice of my intuition.\n\n3\\. The Empress\n\n“Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.” – Lao Tzu\n\nKeywords\n\nFertility, fecundity, sensuality, motherhood, Nature\n\nComments\n\nThe Empress, often depicted as being pregnant, embodies creative energy,\nproductivity, and growth. She is the archetypal mother, and as such, she\nsymbolizes love, devotion, and nurturing. In her association with Venus, she\nrepresents romantic love. Even more generally, she can represent Mother Nature\nherself, in which case she is indicative of nature and the natural world, the\nunderlying principles of life, and the enjoyment of abundance and luxury.\n\nWhereas the High Priestess symbolizes the feminine mind and its intuitive\npowers, the Empress depicts the feminine body. She is seductress, wife, and\nmother, and hence she depicts sensuality, sexuality, and a passionate approach\nto life. She also tells us that we must nurture ourselves in order to be\nproductive.\n\nOn a more abstract level, the Empress represents the creative energy and\npotential of chaos, out of which the Emperor may bring order. But they must\nwork together in a marriage of equals, balancing each other to bring harmony.\nA situation in which chaos is unchecked may degenerate into destructive\nanarchy, but too much of the Emperor’s control can sap its vitality and\nfossilize it.\n\nAdvice\n\nTake a moment to think of something that you can do to nourish and nurture\nyour soul. It need not be anything big. For example, spending a few quiet\nminutes in your garden with a cup of your favorite herbal tea may do wonders\nto refresh your spirit.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI nurture my endeavors and create abundance in my life.\n\n4\\. The Emperor\n\nHe who cannot reason is a fool; he who will not is a bigot; he who dare not is\na slave. — William Drummond\n\nKeywords\n\nStructure, authority, fatherhood, society, reason, leadership\n\nComments\n\nJust as the Empress symbolizes the archetypal mother, the Emperor represents\nthe archetypal father. As such, he provides for the welfare of others and\ndictates the rules and regulations that govern their lives. In other words, he\nbears responsibility commensurate with his power.\n\nOn a more abstract level, the Emperor can indicate structure, stability, and\norder in our lives. He tells us that in order to have a measure of control\nover the world around us, we first must be able to control ourselves; we must\nlearn and practice self-discipline and self-control. His rational mind makes\nlogical decisions based on reason, and so he indicates the planning, analysis,\nmanagement, and administration of projects.\n\nThe Emperor is an authority figure whose domain encompasses secular issues,\nversus the religious matters about which the next card, the Hierophant, is\nconcerned. As such he is controlling, defining, and decision-making, generally\nexerting strong leadership. He can represent society in general, either the\nabstract concept of our social structure or a person who maintains that\nstructure. Thus, the Emperor deals with the laws of society and the\nenforcement of them.\n\nAlthough the Emperor is concerned with the rules and regulations that dictate\nhow things should be done, he can be pragmatic as well when he is functioning\nat his best. But a negative aspect of the Emperor can show up when he becomes\nrigid in his way of thinking. Worse yet, sometimes he can indicate an abuse of\npower and authority, being anything from a bully to a tyrant.\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider something in your life that seems disordered or unmanageable, and\nthen consider how this reflects a problematic aspect of yourself. It may be\nthat you need more self-discipline, better time management, or a more orderly\nthought process. Commit to making an effort toward such self-improvement.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI create structure and stability in my life that is positive and productive.\n\n5\\. The Hierophant\n\nOne should not think, ‘My religion alone is the right path and other religions\nare false.’ God can be realized by means of all paths. — Sri Ramakrishna\n\nKeywords\n\nReligion, tradition, education\n\nComments\n\nWhereas the Emperor represents secular power and authority, the Hierophant is\nresponsible for leadership in the realm of the ecclesiastical. He represents\northodox religion and all its teachings and blessings, rites and rituals, and\ncultural traditions and taboos. Thus, this card can indicate following the\nestablished teachings of a religion, perhaps even in blind faith. The flip\nside of this may be the need to see a fallacy in conventional wisdom and take\nan unorthodox approach. In its benign aspect, this card represents the\npositive side of having religion as a guide and anchor for your life. But when\nexpressed negatively, it can indicate religiosity and a sanctimonious self-\nrighteousness, which can lead to oppression and fanaticism.\n\nThe Hierophant can represent the customs of a culture, and thus he may\nindicate our conscience to the extent to which those mores have been\ninternalized. Consequently he may say , &quot;Let your conscience be your\nguide&quot; and thereby signify listening to the wisdom and guidance of our\nhigher self.\n\nAlthough the Hierophant is often seen in his role as a teacher of arcane\nsecrets, he also can represent teaching and education in general.\nTraditionally, however, besides being the teacher of arcane secrets (to a\nselect few) a hierophant also guards and keeps those secrets from improper\ndissemination. Therefore, this card can deal with the judicious keeping of\nsecrets or the jealous guarding of important information.\n\nIn a secular context, this card can deal with hierarchies and pecking orders,\nsuch as climbing the corporate ladder, especially when done in a conventional\nmanner. Also, as implied by the traditional imagery of the Hierophant sitting\nin front of two supplicants, this card can indicate mediation between two\nparties.\n\nSometimes the Hierophant refers to an initiation into a group, or simply\nbelonging to a group, such as a club, team, clique, or society. Consequently,\nhe may indicate peer pressure. Also in the arena of relationships, the\nHierophant may deal with the approval or disapproval of friends, family, or\nsociety regarding an unorthodox relationship.\n\nAs in the case of the High Priestess, the Hierophant can indicate a repression\nof sexuality. But while the High Priestess also may imply chastity or\nvirginity, the Hierophant tends more toward an indication of a platonic\nrelationship.\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider the traditional wisdom of your culture as you seek to learn from\nexperience, but remember that such wisdom is only an offering. Carefully\nevaluate it and take from it what you will, for you are not bound by it, only\nguided.\n\nAffirmation\n\nMy life is blessed and transformed when I follow the guidance of my Higher\nSelf.\n\n6\\. The Lovers\n\n“None love, but they who wish to love.” — Jean Baptiste Racine\n\nKeywords\n\nUnion, decision, rite of passage, romance, love\n\nComments\n\nAn obvious implication of this card is that of the union of two people,\nideally in a balanced relationship. This can relate specifically to love and\nsex, but it can have a more generalized implication as well. It can indicate\nan effort to attain a higher level of wholeness or consciousness through the\ninternal union of opposites, such as your masculine and feminine attributes,\nyour conscious and unconscious minds, or your mental and emotional aspects.\n[[33]](text00000.html#_edn33)\n\nOn another level, this card traditionally indicates important decisions such\nas when we find ourselves at a moral crossroads in life or facing an ethical\ndilemma. The RWS version does not depict this nuance quite as obviously as\nsome other, especially older, Tarot decks do. In some decks, a man seems to be\nchoosing between two women, often wherein one is a vamp (symbolically, the\n“wrong” choice, i.e., vice) and the other is a virgin (the “right” choice,\ni.e., virtue). [[34]](text00000.html#_edn34) However, the Garden of Eden\nsymbolism of the RWS card also points toward a significant choice, especially\nas it relates to how we respond to temptation. Generally the choices being\nweighed are seen to be between “good” and “bad” aspects of a situation.\n\nIf we combine these two interpretations—love and decisions—we can see this\ncard as saying that love is a choice we make every day of our lives. For\nexample, when someone close to us makes a mistake or does something hurtful,\nwe can choose love or we can choose anger and resentment. This card tells us\nthat for our relationships to succeed, we must choose love over and over\nagain, even though that’s not always easy to do.\n\nThe placement of this card between the Hierophant (the established and\northodox ways of doing things) and the Chariot (forging ahead on your own\npath) is significant. It says that the Lovers card can represent choosing\nbetween tradition and new ways of doing things. It indicates questioning\nestablished thinking and deciding which traditional ideas you want to keep\nversus which you need to discard as you choose your own path in life.\n\nLastly, considering the fact that the onset of sexuality and learning about\nromantic love are often the first acts of one’s adulthood, this card may be\nseen as indicating an adolescent rite of passage or initiation. And by\nextension, it can represent any important rite of passage.\n\nAdvice\n\nChoose to love others. This is relatively easy when we are talking about\npeople who are kind to you. It is much harder in the case of those who have\nwronged you, but it is also much more valuable then. Try to see your oneness\nwith those who have hurt you, and realize that they, like you, are wounded and\nin pain, struggling with life’s challenges. Your love can heal you, them, and\nyour relationship with them.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI choose love instead of fear and judgment.\n\n7\\. The Chariot\n\n“Valor lies just halfway between rashness and cowardice.” — Cervantes\n\nKeywords\n\nControl, force of will, progress, victory\n\nComments\n\nThe most overt archetypal symbols on this card are the charioteer (our\nessential, unchanging “Self”), the chariot (our changing and transient body),\nand the animals pulling the chariot (either our life force or the conflicting\naspects of our personality). These symbols, taken either individually or\ncollectively, can inform our interpretation of this card.\n\nIf the Lovers card indicates an adolescent rite of passage, then the next\ncard, the Chariot, deals with the subsequent emergence into adulthood. To\ncontrol his chariot, and the opposing forces of the black and white sphinxes\n(or horses, depending on the deck) that pull it, the charioteer needs to have\nself-assurance, self-control, and self-discipline. But although he may take\nresponsibility for his chosen path and have the tenacity to stay that course,\nhe also may run roughshod over whoever or whatever gets in his way. Draft\nanimals—especially when they are undomesticated as, presumably, sphinxes\nare—can represent our passions or desires pulling us along, and so this card\ncan be about striving to control those passions.\n\nThe charioteer also may be working to cope with a difficult situation by\ncontrolling two opposing forces, but although he is able to willfully control\nthose contradictory forces, perhaps they are not yet reconciled or integrated.\nA particularly problematic aspect of this card can arise when these two\nopposing forces are internal. The charioteer may be wearing two (or more)\n“masks” in his life—i.e., playing different roles—which he is struggling to\nreconcile. For example, the dictates of his career may be in conflict with the\nrequirements of being a husband and father. Or maybe he has a secret life that\nhe is trying to hide from the world at large. Whatever the case, this card can\nindicate that for now he can control the contradictory forces of these two\nroles, but they are not easily reconciled, and they threaten to pull him in\ntwo different directions if he is not careful.\n\nIn general, however, this card is traditionally considered a sign of victory.\nBut it also says that w hen you find yourself making little or no progress\ntoward your goals, perhaps the problem is that your ambitions lack focus and\ncommitment, or perhaps they are misdirected.\n\nAdvice\n\nJust do it! The time is past for imagining what you should do and for planning\nyour course. Now is the time to set forth on your chosen path with will power,\nconfidence, and determination.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am in control of my life, and I can accomplish anything I set my mind to.\n\n8\\. Strength\n\nThe only th ing worthy of you is compassion. Hatred will never let you face\nthe beast in man — Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nKeywords\n\nFortitude, i nner strength, courage\n\nComments\n\nTypically, the image on the Strength card is of a woman gently calming or\nsubduing a lion. It is inconceivable, however, that this gentle woman could\nsubdue a lion through physical prowess, so the strength indicated by this card\nis an inner one, such as fortitude, courage, patience, integrity, compassion,\nresolve, generosity, understanding, and composure. The lemniscate (the\ninfinity sign) above her head indicates that the source of this strength is\nher connection with the divine nature of the universe.\n\nIt is important to note that we all have aspects of both the lady and the\nlion. While the lady represents our connection to a Higher Power—our divine\nnature—the lion symbolizes our powerful weaknesses (such as anger, jealousy,\nand aggression) as well as our raw passions and desires, which we must face\nand then tame through love and understanding. As long as we fail to\nacknowledge their presence, though, we risk being mauled by them.\n\nThus, this card indicates compassionate self-examination in order to achieve\nself-awareness. It says that when we are confronted with aspects of ourselves\nthat we fear or loathe, we would do well to accept them and tame them.\nHowever, the intent should not be to control them, but to guide them and\nchannel them into productive avenues.\n\nAlternatively, the lion may symbolize difficult people and challenging\nsituations in the world around us. When someone angers us, the roar of their\nlion has called to our own inner one, which is roaring back. Of course, this\nworks in the other direction as well, which is why our anger usually elicits\nan angry response in other people. And so this card urges us to learn to deal\nwith difficult people with care and kindness, both for ourselves and for them.\nMore generally, it can indicate an ability to face life’s problems with\ncourage and compassion.\n\nFinally, this card reminds me of a Cherokee legend called Two Wolves in which\nan old man tells his grandson that there is a fight going on between two\nwolves inside every one of us. One wolf is evil (anger, greed, arrogance,\nfalse pride, ego, etc.) and the other one good (joy, peace, love, humility,\ngenerosity, compassion, etc.). When asked &quot;Which wolf will win?&quot; the\nwise old man replies, &quot;The one you feed.&quot;\n\nAdvice\n\nDuring the course of one day, be aware of situations where you react in anger,\nand then try to find a way to deal with these circumstances with understanding\nand compassion instead. See yourself as the woman in this card as you gently\nhandle both the lion within you and the lions in the people you encounter.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI guide my passions with love, courage, and soulful purpose.\n\n9\\. The Hermit\n\n“I'm not a teacher: only a fellow traveler of whom you asked the way. I\npointed ahead—ahead of myself as well as you.” — George Bernard Shaw\n\nKeywords\n\nVision quest, solitude, guru\n\nComments\n\nThe word “hermit” conjures up an image of a wise and learned old man who has\nretired from civilization in order to live in monastic seclusion in some\ndistant and isolated locale. Despite his remote habitat, however, people seek\nhim out for his sage advice and guidance. Such an image encapsulates many of\nthe meanings of this card.\n\nThe lantern that the Hermit holds in many versions of this card may indicate\nthat he is searching for the profound truths in life, or it can be interpreted\nas a beacon to others who are searching for those things. Thus, the Hermit may\nsignify searching for self-understanding, working on spiritual endeavors, or\nfinding purpose of meaning in our lives.\n\nAlternatively, the Hermit may be a guide who has found his own way and who can\nhelp us find ours. He should not, however, be confused with the Hierophant,\nwho is a conventional and orthodox teacher, while the Hermit is an\niconoclastic guru who represents a spiritual quest through personal experience\nrather than through religious dogma. This card thus suggests the saying, “When\nthe student is ready, the teacher will appear.”\n\nThis card also implies renunciation of, or withdrawal from, worldly concerns,\nor just a desire for the comfort of solitude. Sometimes we need to spend quiet\ntime alone—at a retreat perhaps—in order to search within for meaning and\nunderstanding. However, in any quest for solitude, it is valuable to consider\nif we are trying to find something or if we are trying to escape from\nsomething. The former is a journey of discovery; the latter is avoidance of\nit.\n\nAdvice\n\nSpend a few quiet minutes in contemplation of a question such as, “What is my\nsoulful purpose at this time?” Of course, this is a very big question, and a\nfew minutes probably will not answer it for you, but it will start you\nthinking about it, and it will help you along that path. At the very least,\ntry to spend some quality time alone with yourself and this question.\n\nAffirmation\n\nThe quiet time I choose to spend alone nourishes my soul.\n\n10\\. The Wheel of Fortune\n\n“For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven.”\n— Ecclesiastes 3:1\n\nKeywords\n\nCycles of life, change, fate\n\nComments\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune represents the endless cycles that make up the universe.\nEvery day, we wake up, take care of our daily business, go to sleep at night,\nand then wake up again the next day. Helpless babies are born and grow up to\nbecome adults, while vital men and women grow old, weaken, and die. Nations,\nempires, and civilizations rise, hold sway, and then fall, giving way to other\nnations, empires, and civilizations. There are cycles of life within greater\ncycles, and the only thing constant is change.\n\nThis card indicates the vagaries of fortune and the changes in circumstances\nthat are inevitable in life. It advises us to be aware that our trials and\ntribulations, as well as our boons and good fortune, are all part of a greater\ncycle of life, and it also counsels us to deal with change through\nunderstanding, equanimity, and adaptation. Viewed somewhat less\nfatalistically, this card may indicate things like the natural cycles of\ngrowth, alternating periods of activity and rest, or making a major change or\na new start in life.\n\nAlso, consider that the Wheel of Fortune is a turning wheel, and even when its\nrim seems to spin wildly, the hub turns at a relatively languid pace. Thus,\nwhen life seems to spin out of control, the advice of this card is to search\nfor the calm center within that connects us to what is eternal, for it is\nthere that we can find peace. Similarly, this card says that all things are\ntransitory, and since everything must come to an end, we should appreciate\nthings in the here and now, but not attach to them. Also, if we are\nexperiencing difficulties, it is important to remember that “this too shall\npass.”\n\nAdvice\n\nThink about several things in your life that you value. Note your appreciation\nfor what they are, here and now, but remind yourself that it is your sense of\nappreciation that is truly important, for that is something that comes from\nwithin.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI know that change is inevitable, and I view it with composure—calmly and\nobjectively.\n\n11\\. Justice\n\nLet us realize the arc of the moral universe is  \nlong but it bends toward justice. — Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nKeywords\n\nCause and effect, karma, responsibility\n\nComments\n\nWhile the Wheel of Fortune depicts the inevitable, and seemingly capricious,\nhand of fate, the Justice card indicates the blessings and misfortunes for\nwhich we, ourselves, are responsible. In other words, these two cards together\nsay that our current condition is the result of two agencies: the things that\nfate has brought us through the inevitability of change and the things that we\nhave brought upon ourselves through our past actions.\n\nOn one level, then, the Justice card deals with karma, or cosmic justice.\nAlthough it may seem that some people get away with evil, while the good work\nof others goes unrecognized and unrewarded, the message of this card is that\nultimately we all get what we deserve, whether that is good or bad. And so\nthis card advises us to take responsibility for our actions and for our lives\nsince our past actions have created the conditions in which we are now living.\nWhile this may sound like petty blaming, the message here is much richer than\nthat, for an inevitable corollary is that our present actions create our\nfuture. Once we understand that, we can atone for our past mistakes, and then,\nthrough right action in the present, we can create a better future for\nourselves.\n\nThe scales held by the figure on this card can indicate balance and harmony,\ndiscernment and wisdom, while the sword in her other hand represents just or\nrighteous action. Another way of looking at Justice’s scales and sword is to\nsee them as saying that proper action (the sword) depends on careful and wise\nevaluation (the scales) of our life. It’s also vital to realize that these two\nprominent symbols, which stress the importance of “right decision” and “right\naction,” are inextricably linked. A right decision without the corresponding\nright action suggests the proverbial good intentions that pave the road to\nhell. On the other hand, taking right action without a right decision is like\nwalking correctly down the wrong path, and where does that lead us?\n\nOn a more mundane level, this card sometimes depicts human justice, in which\ncase it is indicative of legal proceedings, settlements, contracts, or\npartnerships. In such cases, this card urges us to be honorable in legal\nproceedings and to honor our contracts. It also can indicate the need to\ntemper justice with mercy or to be fair—to ourselves as well as to others.\n\nAlso on the topic of human justice, this card tells us that there is an\nimportant difference between justice and revenge. Justice entails deserved\npunishment that is evaluated and administered through an impartial agency in\norder to right a wrong. Revenge, on the other hand, involves retribution\nadministered by someone who is neither impartial nor accountable, and who acts\nin a bitter and vindictive spirit. And so revenge perpetuates a vicious cycle\nand keeps the wounds of everyone involved open and festering. Also, in the\npursuit of vengeance, we become mean, belligerent, and violent people. We\nbecome that which we think we are chastising, and we corrupt rather than heal\nour own souls.\n\nAdvice\n\nTry to recognize how you have created your own karma. For example, if you have\nexperienced a string of bad relationships, think about what you have done to\ncontribute to the problems of those relationships. Based on that, consider\nwhat you can do to heal your current relationships and create healthy ones in\nthe future. Similarly, you can address financial difficulties, legal issues,\netc.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI take responsibility for my life and I atone for my mistakes.\n\n12\\. The Hanged Man\n\n“Self-sacrifice is the real miracle out of which all the reported miracles\ngrew.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nKeywords\n\nSacrifice, surrender, letting go, reversal\n\nComments\n\nHanging by his foot (versus his neck), and having a serene countenance and a\nglowing halo, the Hanged Man is a symbol of willing self-sacrifice in order to\nattain something of greater value. Like the god Odin of Norse lore who hung\nhimself from the great world-tree, Yggdrasil, in search of wisdom, the Hanged\nMan seeks to attain things like understanding, spiritual enlightenment, and\nthe good of others.\n\nWhile the Hermit searches for spiritual growth by retreating from society, the\nHanged Man does so by withdrawing from activity, and so this card can suggest\nmeditation. It also may indicate redemption or atonement through sacrifice and\nsuffering, or by transcending the self-centered dictates of the ego.\nConsidering this concept in a less positive aspect, the Hanged Man can\nindicate an involuntary sacrifice or someone who is being a martyr.\n\nThere is an aspect of surrender in this card, which may suggest the need to\nrelease our past patterns of behavior in order to continue our spiritual\ngrowth. Another aspect of surrender is the paradox of surrendering in order to\nwin, as stated by the Zen proverb: &quot;Nothing on earth can overcome an\nabsolutely nonresistant person.&quot; History shows us this in the examples of\nthe passive resistance of civil disobedience as advocated by Mahatma Gandhi\nand Martin Luther King, Jr. We also see this in the case of people overcoming\nsubstance abuse through a twelve-step program. [[35]](text00000.html#_edn35)\nIn a related sense, we sometimes have to suspend ourselves in a difficult\nsituation (“hang in there”) until we have learned enough from it to be able to\ngrow out of it and move on, and so this card can also advocate patience.\n\nThere also seems to be a lack of control in the image of this card, which may\nimply an analogous lack of control in our lives. This can be problematic,\nespecially when this card comes up in a reading about a relationship, or it\ncan indicate the serenity of releasing our need to control things.\n\nOne of the more spiritual implications of the Hanged Man card is that of a\nrenunciation of materialism. This scares a lot of people because they think\nthat means that they have to give away all their goodies. But renunciation is\na matter of releasing our attachment to material things, rather than releasing\nour actual possession of them, which is something we may or may not feel\ncalled to do.\n\nFinally, a message that stems from a literal interpretation of this card’s\nimage is a call for a reversal in our point of view or an upending of our\nassumptions and beliefs.\n\nAdvice\n\nHas your hectic pace kept you from examining deeper aspects of your life?\nPerhaps you need to stop what you are doing long enough to quietly ponder your\ncourse of action and to consider it from a new perspective.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI surrender control of my life to a Higher Power.\n\n13. Death\n\n&quot;Life is a great sunrise. I do not see why death should not be an even\ngreater one.&quot; — Vladimir Nabokov\n\nKeywords\n\nEndings, loss, transformation\n\nComments\n\nWe die and are reborn every time we leave behind old habits, gain a new\nperspective, take a new direction in life, buy a new home, move to a new city,\nquit a job, or end a relationship. There are a thousand different types of\ndeath, and this card can refer to any one of them, but rarely does it\nliterally mean physical death. In fact, some Tarot readers make it a rule\nnever to use this card as a prediction of an actual physical death.\n\nThe Death card often heralds a major change or transformation in our life, or\nit suggests the need for one. Therefore, it may advise us that we need to make\na change, or warn us that one is coming, like it or not.\n\nWhen we have suffered a loss, this card can indicate a requirement to mourn\nthat loss before we will be able to experience new growth. Although it is\ncommonly understood that we need to mourn the death of a loved one, it is also\nnecessary to mourn (to some extent) the loss of, say, a job or a relationship\nin order to recover, heal, and experience new growth.\n\nSometimes the Death card says that we need to leave the past behind, we need\nto realize that something is definitely over, so we should let it go and move\non. In fact, everything in the material world is transient, which is a basic\nmessage of this card. This may be why we needed to learn the lesson of non-\nattachment in the prior card, for that will help us avoid suffering when we\nexperience the inevitable losses of this worldly existence.\n\nFinally, this card may simply refer to the need to prune out some of life’s\ndead wood and cut back those things (including relationships, attitudes, or\nideas) that no longer serve us well—to clean out the closets and attics of our\nlives, so to speak. Just as predators thin a herd and gardeners prune their\ntrees, we need to do this every now and then in order to foster new growth.\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider an aspect of your life that has not fared well. What about it might\nyou want to change or give up?\n\nAffirmation\n\nI let go of things that no longer benefit me to allow better things to come\ninto my life.\n\n14\\. Temperance\n\n“Subdue your appetites, my dears, and you’ve conquered human nature.” —\nCharles Dickens\n\nKeywords\n\nHarmony, moderation, adjustment, tempering\n\nComments\n\nIn many versions of this card, we see an angel mixing liquids between two\ncups, with the obvious connotation of blending and balancing. It thus\nindicates moderation in either thought or deed, the fusion of opposites, and\nthe balancing of our spiritual and physical selves. It can advise us to meet\nsomeone halfway, and it can indicate making adjustments in life based upon\nwhat we learn from experience. And a very fundamental aspect of this card is\nits lesson that balance and harmony bring restorative and curative powers into\nour lives, as suggested by the well-known Serenity Prayer:\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to\nchange the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\n\nThere is another important facet of this card which can be explored by\nconsidering the verb “to temper.” While this word means adjustment by\ncounterbalancing—such as tempering justice with mercy—it also means making\nsomething stronger and more resilient through stress and hardship, such as\nsoldiers tempered in the heat of battle. This may help explain why the\nTemperance card comes between Death and the Devil. The challenges suggested by\nthe Death card can strengthen us and make us better able to endure the trials\nof facing our own demons, which are indicated by the Devil card. This is not\nan easy process, though. It is much akin to the way a sword’s steel is\ntempered, being repeatedly heated to a red-hot glow, pounded into shape, and\nthen plunged into water to cool. Consequently, this card suggests that we\nappreciate adversity for what it teaches us and how it helps us learn and\ngrow.\n\nAdvice\n\nSearch inside to see ways in which you have been emotionally wounded. Keeping\nthis in mind as you go about the daily activities of your life, see how these\nwounds affect your life, how they both help and hinder your journey along the\npath of your soul. Also, consider what you can learn from your wounds.\n\nAffirmation\n\nEverything that happens to me and everything I do, it’s all a part of my\nspiritual journey.\n\n15. The Devil\n\n&quot;The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a\nHell of Heaven.&quot; — John Milton\n\nKeywords\n\nShadow self, ego, demons, materialism, obsessions\n\nComments\n\nThe Devil (or demon) on this card can represent our demons or shadow issues\nthat we try to deny or repress, usually with little success. These are the\nhidden desires and obsessions that can drive us to ruin if we fail to face\nthem and cope with them. [[36]](text00000.html#_edn36) Often we deal with\nthese shadow issues by projecting them onto others, thus demonizing other\npeople, as illustrated in this quote from Herman Hesse: &quot;What we despise\nin others is that which reminds us of ourselves.&quot; This is why people who\neasily aggravate us can be our greatest teachers, for they show us where we\nneed to improve ourselves.\n\nAnother symbol well worth considering is the inverted pentagram over the\nDevil’s forehead. An upright pentagram indicates the transcendence of the\nspiritual (the fifth point of the star) over the material (the other four\npoints, which represent the four worldly elements). Thus, the inverted\npentagram indicates materialism (placing the material above the spiritual) or\nsetting our desires above what our higher self tells us is right to do.\n\nThis card also typically depicts people bound to the Devil by chains that they\ncould easily cast aside. Perhaps they fail to realize how loose the chains\nare, maybe they have grown accustomed to them, or possibly they no longer\nrealize the chains are there. In any case, these figures represent being bound\nto desire, lust, obsessions, and addictions. Also, they may indicate blind\nacceptance of an unhealthy, unproductive, or repressive situation—such as a\nrelationship that is co-dependent, obsessive, or abusive—which can bring us\ngreat suffering.\n\nThe dire circumstance illustrated in the Demons card is also reminiscent of\ntoxic relationships we sometimes have with negative people, &quot;psychic\nvampires&quot; who suck the joy out of everything. We may not be able to\neliminate our contact with such people, but we should at least limit our\nassociation with them as much as possible.\n\nThis card is also an obvious indication of succumbing to temptations. With\nthat in mind, it sometimes reminds me of a wonderful quote:\n\n&quot;Opportunity may only knock once, but temptation bangs on your front door\nforever.&quot; — Unknown\n\nA more positive view of this card is that it can represent a shedding of our\ninhibitions, for it is only when our desires and passions are uncontrolled and\nexcessive that they are dangerous. A problem arises when we buy into the shame\nand embarrassment that our society imposes on our enjoyment of sensual\npleasure. Whether it is from good food, a long hot bath, or loving sex,\nphysical pleasure experienced deeply but without shame, harm, or addiction is\na profound communion with life and a vital expression of our soul’s existence\nin the material plane. Of course, there is an important difference between\nenjoying sensual pleasures and being addicted to them, but we weren’t put here\nto eschew involvement with life; we’re here to live life fully and with\nenjoyment and appreciation.\n\nFinally, t his card can indicate an arrogant “pride before the fall,” which\nleads us to the next card, the Tower, which we may associate with the fall\nitself.\n\nAdvice\n\nThink of someone who annoys or angers you, and consider what is it about them\nthat really pushes your buttons. Objectively consider how their flaws may\nreflect your own shortcomings, and then acknowledge those problems in\nyourself, wherever appropriate. Strive to be aware of when they arise during\nthe day, and when they do, forgive yourself unconditionally.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI acknowledge my inner demons, and I confront them and defeat them.\n\n16\\. The Tower\n\n“Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.” —\nProverbs 16:18\n\nKeywords\n\nFalse security, s hattered pride, crisis, downfall, flash of insight,\nliberation\n\nComments\n\nA tower is generally considered to be a secure, well-fortified structure. Due\nto its height, it also can indicate a structure built in pride. However, in\nthe image of this card, the tower is being struck down, which serves as a\nwarning against having a false sense of security as well as an admonishment\nagainst pride. (The “Tower of Babel” allusion should be apparent.) Here pride\nmay be anything from smugness about a mundane possession to that greatest\nhubris of all which is to think we know the mind of God. So this card also may\npredict an ego-shattering experience in which that pride is laid low.\n\nMany people dwell on the catastrophe illustrated here when they see this card\ncome up in a reading, and so it can cause a bit of anxiety and distress.\nHowever, opportunity usually accompanies danger and upheaval. Abrupt and\nunexpected though it may be , the change in one’s life indicated by this card\nis often cleansing, cathartic, and liberating. It can be the proverbial kick\nin the butt we need to get us out of a bad or stagnant situation. It also can\nbe the humbling impetus we need in order to shed the masks that hide our true\nselves and to break down the barriers that separate us from other people.\n\nAlthough they shape the journey of our souls in revolutionary ways, major\nlife-challenging crises are rare. On the other hand, day after day we face\nlittle crises—annoying, exasperating, and maddening ones—and these shape our\nlives in gradual, evolutionary ways. As Anton Chekhov said, “Any idiot can\nface a crisis; it’s this day-to-day living that wears you out,” and sometimes\nthis is the message of the Tower card.\n\nThe lightning bolt, which connects heaven and earth, provides another possible\ninterpretation for this card. An abrupt crisis can bring a flash of insight\nthat leads us to a new understanding, and this new wisdom can help free us\nfrom the rigid confines of a Tower we have built around ourselves. For that\nreason, some people call this the “Aha!” card.\n\nAnother way of interpreting the Tower card is to see it as literally “blowing\nyour top.” There is so much energy in this card, but it is being expressed\ndestructively, not constructively. As Florida Scott-Maxwell said, &quot;Anger\nmust be the energy that has not yet found its right channel.&quot; When\nsomeone acts in anger, the real, underlying cause is more often their own\ninternal reservoir of anger rather than the object of their rage. Benjamin\nFranklin touched on this wisdom when he said, &quot;Anger is never without\nreason, but seldom with a good one.&quot;\n\nFinally, consider how most of us hate to leave the familiar comfort of the\ntowers we’ve built in our lives. We don’t grow while in them, though; we tend\nto stagnate instead. So a bit of advice in this card may be, as Neale Donald\nWalsch says, “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” Consequently, it\nrecommends doing new things or doing old things in a new way.\n\nAdvice\n\nWhen any sort of Tower experience strikes, remember the old saying, “Any\nlanding you can walk away from is a good one.” Learn what you can from it, and\nsee what order you can bring out of the resultant chaos. Hold on, persevere,\nand ride it out. Such experiences require faith and courage, but they can be\nvery rewarding if we let them be and if we learn something from them.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI recognize unhealthy situations when they imprison me, and I voluntarily\nleave them behind.\n\n17\\. The Star\n\n&quot;Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.&quot; — Martin Luther\nKing, Jr.\n\nKeywords\n\nInspiration, h ope, peace, light at the end of the tunnel\n\nComments\n\nThroughout history, the stars have awed and inspired mankind. Constant,\neternal, ethereal, and unattainable, they embody a primal concept of the\ndivinity of the universe and inspire a quiet and subtle reverence. Thus this\ncard can also refer to a search for an inner peace or calm, a renewal of the\nsoul, and meditation which leads to a higher level of consciousness.\n\nMeditation takes time and practice, but this card suggests a way to facilitate\nyour progress if a sense of serenity has been elusive. It’s quite simple,\nreally: step outside in the dark of night and quietly look up at the star-\nfilled sky. In doing this, you’ll get a taste of the peace and oneness that\nmeditation can bring, and with that awareness, you can more easily recreate\nand recognize it during meditation.\n\nThe idea of a guiding star is common in human folklore, and it lends various\nmeanings to this card such as inspiration, divine guidance, faith, and\noptimism. Such interpretations for the Star card are validated and reiterated\nby the fact that we have sayings like “reach for the stars” and “wish upon a\nstar.”\n\nThis card is also about the profound wisdom of hope, which can carry us\nthrough many a dark night. Hope should have some basis in reality, though, or\nit can degenerate into delusion, which is the providence of the next card, the\nMoon. Reasonable hopes are wise for they lift us up and strengthen us, but\neven when our hopes are reasonable, we must be careful with them. If we use\nthem as an excuse to avoid taking action to help ourselves, then even these\nhopes may be no more than an opiate. And so this card carries both the advice\nto hope and a warning not to get lost in dreams, for at some point we have to\ncome back down to earth and take action if we want to be able to manifest\nthose dreams.\n\nAdvice\n\nThink about a problem that you are having. It may be in a relationship, your\njob, or your home. Now consider a solution that you may reasonably hope for,\nand hold that hope dear to your heart. The Star card can be about divine\nguidance as well, so use some sort of prayer based upon this hope.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI never lose hope for a better future.\n\n18\\. The Moon\n\n&quot;Everyone is a moon and has a dark side which he never shows\nanybody.&quot; — Mark Twain\n\nKeywords\n\nDelusion, deception, dreams, mystical enchantment, lunacy\n\nComments\n\nIn the light of the moon, common landmarks take on a strange and mysterious\naspect, and the world is cloaked in a magical enchantment—or a shroud of\nfear—that it lacks in daylight. Soft moonlight is sufficient to show us shapes\nand outlines, but details are blurred in shadow, and our imagination is left\nfree to fill them in. And so this card indicates imagination and illusions,\nleading us to wonder if we are seeing beyond the forms of the world to its\nspirit or if we are deluding ourselves. This ability to see the world anew can\nbe the hallmark of genius or of madness, and often there is but a fine line\nbetween the two.\n\nSimilarly, t he Moon represents the terrible beauty of the mysteries of life.\nThese ineffable mysteries are frightening and challenging, but without them,\nlife would be dull and insipid, meaningless even.\n\nThe Moon card also says that there really are monsters under our bed at night,\njust as we suspected when we were children. Not literally, of course, but\nfiguratively speaking, there are monsters lurking in our unconscious. They are\nthe fears and desires we have banished to the deep, dark recesses of our\nminds. These monsters haunt us and they cause us to act irrationally at times,\nand the only way to conquer them is to have the courage to turn on the light\nand look for them. This can be a frightening prospect because it means\nadmitting that these monsters are a part of ourselves, but it is only when we\nfind the courage to face them that we can banish them. As horrible as they may\nseem, however, they cannot survive long in the light. As Carl Jung said,\n&quot;One does not become enlightened by naively 'imagining' images of light,\nbut by making the mind's darkness conscious.&quot;\n\nAs a symbol of the night, the Moon also represents our intuition and our\ndreams. A dream can inspire us, but we must remember that it is only a guide,\nnot reality itself. Similarly, this card represents our unconscious mind and\nthus can be an indication of unconscious behavior patterns.\n\nThe moon's dark realm of mystical possibilities and hidden dangers calls to\nmind the phrase &quot; the dark night of the soul.&quot; This term refers to a\nphase in a spiritual journey when one feels frightened, alone, and abandoned\nin the darkness. Thus, it can mean a test of faith, or it may indicate a time\nwhen we feel we have lost our way.\n\nFinally, a few basic astronomical observations about the moon can further\nilluminate the meaning of this card. First, whereas the Sun generates its own\nlight, the moon shines by reflected light. Thus, this card includes aspects of\nbeing reflective, passive, and receptive. Next, the fact that the moon always\nkeeps one face hidden from the earth can imply that this card indicates\ndeceptions, hidden agendas, or misunderstandings. Finally, in ancient times,\nan eclipse of the sun by the moon caused panic. So fear, especially fear of\nthe unknown, may be associated with this card too.\n\nAdvice\n\nAlthough there is danger in the wild side of your psyche, there is great power\nand opportunity there as well. For just a little while, then, use your\nimagination instead of your reason to find a solution to your problems. Do you\nsee new and wonderful possibilities that suggest surprising new ways of\ndealing with them? Remember, however, that this is your imagination. Use it,\nbut do not get swallowed up in it. Its suggestions must be tested by reason,\nwhich is the providence of the next card, the Sun.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am able to challenge and conquer my fear of the unknown.\n\n19\\. The Sun\n\n&quot;Turn your face to the sun and the shadows fall behind you.&quot; — Maori\nsaying\n\nKeywords\n\nVitality, joy, cheerful disposition, optimism, enlightenment\n\nComments\n\nIn a very literal sense, the life-giving light and warmth of the sun lend\nmeanings to this card such as vitality, activity, and energy. So this card\nportends growth, renewal, and regeneration, although we should also keep in\nmind that too much sun is dangerous, for it can burn.\n\nThe Sun card also can indicate the dawning of a new day and the revitalization\nof our hopes and dreams that a new day implies. The light of the sun also\nsymbolizes enlightenment and the reasoning intellect, and so these are aspects\nof this card also.\n\nWhile the optimism that we previously saw in the Star card is a quiet inner\nassurance that things will turn out well, the optimism of the Sun has a more\nboisterous quality. Here our optimism is so enthusiastic and energetic that we\nfeel compelled to ride forth and tell everyone else that things will turn out\ngreat. The naked child seen in the RWS Sun card depicts that joy and\ncheerfulness, as well as truth, trust, and openness. This child also can\nindicate getting in touch with our inner child. In a negative sense, however,\nit can depict someone who is obsessed with maintaining a youthful image, even\nwhen it becomes embarrassing compared to the reality of his or her years.\nThus, it also can indicate actions that are child-like or childish.\n\nThe sun is a common symbol of our spiritual center, the divine nature that\nlives within us, our &quot;inner light.&quot; And so this card sometimes urges\nus to consider what our &quot;soulful purpose&quot; may be. It also advises us\nto rise above the dark clouds of negativity in order to see the Light and to\nrealize that those clouds are our ego’s illusions about the world. Extending\nthat concept further, this card is also about seeing other people in light of\ntheir essential divine nature instead of their ego which obscures it. As Ralph\nWaldo Emerson said, “The measure of mental health is the disposition to find\ngood everywhere.”\n\nFinally, since the sun is the center of our solar system, this card can\nportray an egocentric attitude. The following quote expresses this in a\ndelightfully humorous way:\n\n“When science finally locates the center of the universe, some people will be\nsurprised to learn they’re not it.” — Bernard Bailey\n\nAdvice\n\nIn light of this card’s association with new beginnings, it suggests you make\na concerted effort to approach your life with a sense of joy and vigor, seeing\neverything in a new light.\n\nAffirmation\n\nJoy and fulfillment are my birthright, and I find satisfaction and delight in\neverything I do.\n\n20\\. Judgment\n\n“The practice of forgiveness is our most important contribution to the healing\nof the world.” — Marianne Williamson\n\nKeywords\n\nA calling, epiphany, rebirth, criticism, careful evaluation, forgiveness\n\nComments\n\nThis card may be calling us to make a significant change in our life, one that\nwill bring us to a higher purpose. Similarly, it can refer to redemption,\natonement, and rebirth. The trumpeting angel often depicted on this card may\nannounce a revelation or herald an awakening to a new perspective of the world\naround us or to our role within it. The people in this card, rising up as if\nfrom the dead, are reminiscent of butterflies emerging from their cocoons.\nConsequently, this card may indicate emerging from a stagnant situation, or it\ncan mean coming out of a transitional period into a new and better phase of\nour life.\n\nTaking this card’s name literally, it can indicate having good sense and the\nability to correctly evaluate a given situation, i.e., having good judgment.\nAdditionally, it can mean that we are dispensing (or enduring) critical\njudgment, or it may advise us to stop being judgmental toward other people.\n\nNumerologically, this card’s number, 20, reduces to 2, which implies a second\nchoice or a second chance. This symbolizes another, very important meaning for\nthe Judgment card, that being forgiveness. I've heard it said that holding on\nto a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. In\nother words, the anger that we feel about someone else’s actions harms only\nourselves, not the other person. So this card tells us that if we feel that\nsomeone has wronged us, forgiveness is the surest way to move beyond that\npain.\n\nAdvice\n\nListen closely to the music of the Universe; it calls upon you to rise up out\nof the darkness and into the light of your soul. See the brilliant soul in\neveryone else as well. Hear the music of love in the words and deeds of\nothers, and feel the pulse of life in all that you touch and experience.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI listen to the call from my Higher Self leading me to my soulful purpose.\n\n21\\. The World\n\n&quot;What good you do may be of little significance, but it is v ery\nimportant that you do it. Be the change you want to see in the world.&quot; —\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nKeywords\n\nAccomplishment, joie de vivre, prosperity, freedom, connection, completion,\nwholeness\n\nComments\n\nThe World card illustrates our world, our reality, which is that of a divine\nSoul (the central figure) existing within the confines of a physical body\n(suggested by the four peripheral figures, which can represent the four\nelements of the material world). With the Fool card, we set out on a journey\nimbued with divine potential that we were innocently unaware of. Now, with the\nfinal card of the Major Arcana, we are aware of that divinity within us, and\nwe dance to its rhythm and beat. And so this card is about knowing our true,\nauthentic selves, and it is about finding our connection with our soul and\nwith our life’s purpose.\n\nSimilarly, then t he World card is about universal love—the love of all\nhumankind and even of all living beings. Reaching this state of universal love\nboth comes from and results in a sense of our oneness with everything in the\nworld. As Rabindranath Tagore said, “The same stream of life that runs through\nthe world runs through my veins.” It also reflects the famous admonition to\nlive in the world but not be of the world. In other words, it illustrates the\ndiscovery that although we all have to live in the world, we don’t have to let\nworldliness attach itself to us.\n\nThe dancer depicted in the World card suggests freedom, while the figures in\nthe four corners of this card imply the four elements, the four seasons, or\nthe four directions (among other things), and so they can signify structure or\nlimitations as well as the totality of the world. Consequently, this card\nsymbolizes finding or exploring freedom within constraining boundaries, which\nmay be anything from the limitations of a given art form to those of the laws\nof physics. Every one of us is constrained by the physical limitations of our\nmaterial existence, but few of us are able to actualize our potential freely\nwithin those restrictions. This card assures us that this is possible for all\nof us.\n\nThis card also depicts the happy discovery of our place in the world or in our\ncommunity, however we may define that. In other words, it represents the\ndivine dance of life and finding our role in that dance.\n\nIn addition, this card can be about achieving a sense of unity. This means\nthings like merging our inner sense of awareness with our outer activities,\nuniting our conscious mind with our unconscious, or blending our spiritual\naspirations with our material endeavors. At a transpersonal level, it means\nuniting our personal sense of identity with our awareness of all humanity, as\nbeautifully illustrated by this quote from John Donne\n[[37]](text00000.html#_edn37) :\n\nN o man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent,\na part of the main. ... Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved\nin mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls\nfor thee.\n\nAs the final card in the Major Arcana, the World often represents completion,\nsuch as the conclusion of a major life cycle and the beginning of a new one.\nConsequently, it can mean accomplishment, achievement, triumph, fulfillment of\nour potential, prosperity, and deserved recognition. And it can mean peace and\nlasting joy, as in the fairytale ending, “... and they lived happily ever\nafter.” It also may represent working toward our purpose in life, the\nrealization of our divine nature.\n\nAdvice\n\nThis card advocates searching for meaning in life through seeing your\nconnection to everything else. So feel the energy of the universe flowing\nthrough you, energizing you, and becoming you as you also remember that\neveryone else is a part of that energy as well. Then spend a few minutes in\nquiet meditation, peacefully looking inside. There you will find your\nconnection to everything outside yourself.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am bringing my worldly activities into harmony with my true, authentic self.\n\n###  \nThe Minor Arcana\n\n####  Wands\n\nAce of Wands\n\nThe Ace of Wands can be seen as a torch burning in the night that heralds\ninspiration, excitement, and insight. It marks the beginning of an\nenthusiastic undertaking or enterprise, and it is a passionate effort that\nbrings growth and transformation. It is creative energy used with confidence,\na new enterprise launched with courage, and a journey begun with\ndetermination.\n\nThe way to get rid of the darkness is to light a candle, and as the Buddha\nsaid, “Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of\nthe candle will not be shortened.” So this card reminds us that even our\nsingle small candle can dispel the darkness around us.\n\nEvery Tarot card has both positive and negative meanings, however, and while\nthe Aces usually are seen as indicating the ideals of their suit, there may be\nnegative aspects to them as well. This Ace can indicate an overload of energy,\nsuch as hyperactivity or sexual compulsion, or it can reveal an extreme desire\nfor power that results in megalomania.\n\nAdvice\n\nPress forth in your work with drive and passion born of confidence that you\nare inspired by the creative energy of the Universe.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI have an endless supply of creativity and energy available for everything I\ndo.\n\nTwo of Wands\n\nIn the RWS Two of Wands, we see a man standing on a parapet, holding a globe\nin one hand as he surveys the landscape before him. Perhaps he is comparing\nhis model (the globe) with the reality he sees, or maybe he’s planning to mold\nreality to fit his model of it? This image evokes meanings such as planning a\ncourse of action with boldness and courage, experiencing personal power, and\nfeeling like we have the world in our hands. Taken to extremes, however, this\ncan indicate someone who is domineering.\n\nThe Two of Wands can also portend conflict, especially a conflict of will. In\nmy Tarot of the Masters deck, this card employs a dynamic image of two\nwrestlers in order to express the concept of dominion over others, which the\nmore static RWS version illustrates implicitly with the position and attitude\nof the man on a parapet. There is an illusion, however, in our desire for\npower which is succinctly expressed by Eckhart Tolle: “Power over others is\nweakness disguised as strength.” [[38]](text00000.html#_edn38)\n\nAdvice\n\nCompare your goals with reality, and decide which, if either, you need to\nadjust.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI avoid th e trap of seeking control over others.\n\nThree of Wands\n\nThe typical image on this card is that of a man looking out from a high\nvantage point. This indicates having foresight and patience, leading the way\ninto new ventures, and exploring the unknown for new possibilities. It deals\nwith expanding our horizons and foreseeing the results of our efforts and\ninvestments. It also may indicate waiting for our ship to come in.\n\nThe fact that the Three of Wands sequentially follows the struggle for\ndomination depicted in the Two of Wands leads to some advice about resolving\nour interpersonal conflicts. When we have a fight with someone, a healthy\nresolution depends upon rising above a “me versus you” attitude. When we do\nthat, we begin to see the big picture; we begin to see that we are all\nconnected.\n\nThis card also urges us to look beyond our current circumstances. When we feel\ntrapped in a bad situation, we should take time to pause, reflect, and see\nbeyond it. Do we really have it so bad? Can we envision a way to get out of\nit?\n\nAdvice\n\nHave patience and focus your attention and efforts on the long haul. You have\nlaid the groundwork, and now is the time to nurture your endeavor as you wait\nfor results.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am focused on achieving my goals.\n\nFour of Wands\n\nOn the Four of Wands, we typically see people engaging in a festival of some\nsort. Thus, this card implies a joyful celebration, perhaps of the completion\nof an important task or the attainment of an important milestone.  It may be a\nhomecoming, a reunion, a wedding, or a going away party. As such, this card\nmay urge us to make a commitment, and it can indicate a rite of passage.\n\nA celebration can honor an achievement, but we also celebrate as a way of\nhonoring who we are—as an individual and as a group. This card can convey that\nsense of honoring who we are, and it can indicate enjoying the support of our\ncommunity, especially in a shared sense of unity and harmony.\n\nThe Four of Wands also can indicate sacred space in our lives, which can\nfoster our personal growth and creativity. This sacred space, of course, may\nencompass emotional and psychological dimensions as well as physical ones.\n\nAdvice\n\nPlan a celebration—even if just a small one—of your life and the ways in which\nthe Universe has supported you. Celebration is very important, for it\nexpresses gratitude and appreciation, and it supports your sense of well\nbeing.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI create sacred space in my life for my creativity and personal growth.\n\nFive of Wands\n\nThis is a card of chaotic energy, which can entail anything from petty\nbickering to a barroom brawl. The figures in this card may be fighting or\nstruggling against one another, they may be engaged in a competitive sport, or\nthey may be working together to build something. These interpretations imply a\ngoal-oriented struggle, with the important difference between them being that\nit may be a cooperative endeavor or a competitive one. Other important issues\nto consider are whether that struggle is internal or external, friendly or\nantagonistic. This card urges us to consider that if there is negative strife\ngoing on in our lives, wouldn’t it be better to try to convert that energy\ninto a positive effort that works for the common good?\n\nAnother way to consider this card is to see it as an illustration of something\ncalled “Monkey Mind.” (This term comes from the way our minds jump from\nthought to thought like a monkey jumping from tree to tree.) It’s the constant\nchatter in our minds that obsesses about the past and worries about the\nfuture, all the while avoiding a meaningful engagement of the present. It\nkeeps us in chaos and confusion, which keeps us from finding peace.\n\nAdvice\n\nIn any conflict, try to find creative energy and common ground with your foes\nor competitors.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI can rise above the chaos around me and transform conflict into cooperation.\n\nSix of Wands\n\nThis card depicts conquest or triumph through hard won battles. It implies the\ncharisma of the victor, and it indicates praise and acclaim for his success.\nThe true measure of our success, however, lies not in our material\nachievements themselves, but in our connectedness with others through which we\nall work together to succeed. And so this card is also a reminder to the\nvictor to consider and appreciate those who have supported him and helped make\nthis triumph possible, for no one does it alone. It also urges us to be happy\nfor other people when they succeed.\n\nThe Six of Wands also warns of an addictive desire for recognition and an\narrogant pride that can arise from acclaim and glory.\n\nAdvice\n\nMake a list of things that you have done recently for which you deserve\npraise. Take joy in those accomplishments. However, a victor should not rest\non his laurels, so think of one thing you want to accomplish in the near\nfuture, and focus your will on attaining that new goal.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI appreciate the help and support that I get from others.\n\nSeven of Wands\n\nThe Seven of Wands can signify resolve and perseverance as well as taking a\nstand for our beliefs assertively, courageously, or defiantly. In many decks,\nits image is reminiscent of the children’s game, “King of the Hill” wherein\nthe person who has reached the top of the hill has to be constantly on guard\nagainst those who want to dethrone him. And so it illustrates the problematic\nside of the victory we saw in the previous card.\n\nA significant theme running through the sevens in the Minor Arcana is that of\ntests and trials, so this card also says that every time we feel criticized,\ninsulted, or abused we are facing a test of how we respond. Circumstances\noften arise where we feel attacked, and our first instinct may be to fight\nback, but do we really need to fight? Perhaps we're overreacting; perhaps we\nneed to set aside our ego reaction and take a measured response instead.\n\nIronically, this card also indicates blocking the blessings in life due to a\nfailure to see opportunities in our obstacles. Sometimes we would do well to\nconsider this advice from Julia Cameron:\n\n“Bless not only the road, but the bumps on the road. They are all part of the\nhigher journey.”\n\nThis card also is about having (or needing) great strength of character when\nbeleaguered or outnumbered. Or it can say that someone is being stubborn.\n\nAdvice\n\nStand up for your rights and defend your position assertively but not\naggressively, for you do not want to sink to the level of your adversaries.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI have the courage to stand my ground and fight for what I know is right.\n\nEight of Wands\n\nThe Eight of Wands says that the opposition seen in the previous card has been\novercome. Eight wands now fly through the air, depicting a unity of purpose\nand a “full steam ahead” attitude. We have the will to set things in motion\nand the freedom to move ahead. And so this card illustrates a surge of energy,\nsudden action, a rushing forth in consequence of our inspiration. Progress is\naccelerating. But there is also an implicit warning here to be careful not to\nlet things fly out of control.\n\nSimilarly, the Eight of Wands implies spontaneity, the ability to live in the\nmoment with enthusiasm and vitality. We are not meant to trudge through life;\nwe are here to live it fully, in joy and wonder, to engage in life with a\nsense of joie de vivre . So sometimes this card tells us “Carpe diem! Seize\nthe day.”\n\nThis card also represents the burst of passionate energy that comes from\nfalling in love, including the feeling of being swept off your feet, of being\nhelpless to resist love.\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider whether or not there is something you can do to make your life\nextraordinary—wonderfully your own—even if in only some small way. Think about\nit, and then carpe diem!\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am boldly pursuing my dreams.\n\nNine of Wands\n\nThe Nine of Wands suggests the old adage, &quot;That which doesn't kill us\nmakes us stronger.&quot; The man we often see on this card illustrates this.\nHe is battle-worn, battle-scarred, and battle-weary, but now he has experience\non his side, and he is ready to continue defending that which is important to\nhim. Consequently, he symbolizes someone whose strength has been forged like\ntempered steel. He has perseverance and persistence on his side, as well as\nthe deep, hidden reserves he needs in order to prevail. But he is wiser now\nand so he chooses his battles wisely. It’s also interesting to note that the\nwands standing behind him look like a fence, which implies that there may be\nboundary issues involved as well, or maybe he just needs to define his space.\n\nWe may also see this beleaguered figure as someone in the querent’s life. It’s\neasy to forget that we aren’t the only ones with challenges to deal with and\nwounds to heal. Other people have problems too. They need our understanding\nwhen they act badly because of their problems, and they need our compassion\nwhen their soul is damaged. Over two thousand years ago Plato said, &quot;Be\nkind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle,&quot; and this is just\nas true today as it was then.\n\nAdvice\n\nWe all have been wounded somehow and, as a consequence, have erected\nboundaries and barriers. But boundaries restrict as well as protect.  Consider\nwhat limitations you have put on yourself—things you think you are not able to\ndo—and reconsider them. Pick one and commit to doing something that\ndemonstrates that you are no longer confined by it.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI always persist despite any setbacks that may come my way.\n\nTen of Wands\n\nAlthough greatly burdened, the person depicted in the Ten of Wands card\nstruggles on. This card may be asking if we are overextended or pushing\nourselves too hard, in which case we may need to lighten the load for the sake\nof our health and well being. Have we taken on one too many obligations, the\none that is the last straw? Did we bite off more than you can chew, so to\nspeak? Perhaps we can let someone help, or is our pride keeping us from\nsharing the load? A similar insight is that it's important to remember that\neveryone is carrying their own burdens. They have their own set of problems\nand their own reasons for doing what they do and being who they are.\n\nThis card also may indicate the burdens of success. Maybe we have developed an\nattachment to our past accomplishments that hinders our progress in new\nendeavors, or maybe people around us have developed unrealistic expectations\nof what we can do. In that case, this may be considered the “should upon”\ncard. When we let ourselves become burdened by all the things other people\nfeel we should do, we have let ourselves be “should upon” and it is time to\nfind out what we want to do instead.\n\nAdvice\n\nThe accumulated responsibilities you have taken on can hold you down and keep\nyou from doing what you want or need to do. Prioritize your life. Concentrate\non what is truly important, and discard the rest—at least for now.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI release my attachment to my past successes so that I can move on to new\nhorizons.\n\nPage of Wands\n\nThis Page enters into new ventures or undertakings with daring and excitement.\nHe has the eagerness, enthusiasm, and confidence of a new initiate, and\nperhaps the beginner’s luck of one as well. Similarly, he may be preparing\nfor, or about to embark upon, a thrilling adventure, one in which he may be\nwilling to take great risks or in which he’s unaware of the risks. In\naddition, he is learning to exercise his willpower.\n\nConsidering the old saying, “You don’t stop playing because you get old; you\nget old because you stop playing,” we can interpret this card as being about\nhaving the playful enthusiasm of a child. It suggests that we should treat our\nlife experiences with a sense of play and engage in that play completely and\nwith a sense of joy.\n\nPages sometimes refer to messages, and this page might indicate one that is\ninspiring or encouraging.\n\nAdvice\n\nFind a renewed sense of initiative and vigor about your work or career. This\nis possible whenever you can view it with a sense of wonder.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am ready to set off on a new adventure with great passion and a sense of\nwonder.\n\nKnight of Wands\n\nThe Tarot’s knights are commonly associated with elemental Air, and the suit\nof Wands with Fire, which makes this knight “Air of Fire” and truly, he can be\na windblown wildfire that burns brightly, but that also burns out quickly.\nThis knight’s great energy and quick, decisive action can make him triumphant\nwhen he is able to remain focused, but otherwise it may render him\nunpredictable and undependable, like the proverbial “loose cannon.” He is\ndynamic but restive, enthusiastic but reckless. He is passionate about\nwhatever he does, but he is not yet in control of those passions. He will\nimpulsively commit to a project, but then something else may come along and\nsweep him away as he is caught up in the heat of the moment.\n\nThis card also illustrates the way that some people ride forth on their\npassions, forever looking to get somewhere other than where they are. But to\nquote Neil Gaiman, &quot;The price of getting what you want is getting what\nyou once wanted.&quot; The problem, though, is not that we ride our passions,\nit’s that we don’t realize that it’s the ride itself that’s important. So a\nbit of advice inherent in this card is to ride passionately toward the future,\nbut always enjoy the ride as it exists in this perfect moment of now.\n\nAdvice\n\nLook for a creative approach to a problem you are having, and then charge\nforth with passion.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI undertake new projects with boldness and courage.\n\nQueen of Wands\n\nThis queen is strong, capable, and forceful, but she is als o fun-loving,\nexuberant, and optimistic. The Tarot’s queens personify the feminine aspects\nof wisdom, which includes being supportive, and when we couple that with the\ncreativity that is a characteristic of the suit of Wands, we see that she is\nan inspiration to others and she supports the creative spark in everyone's\nlife. Thus, for example, this card may indicate someone who supports us in an\nadventure or enterprise. In a group setting, she is likely to be an\ninspirational cheerleader and morale booster. A side benefit of such\ncharacteristics is that they also bring more enthusiasm in our own life as\nwell. As Mark Twain once said, “The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to\ncheer somebody else up.”\n\nThe Queen of Wands looks on the bright side of things, but like the cat at her\nfeet on the RWS version of this card, she tends to be independent in her\nrelationships, wanting things on her own terms.\n\nAdvice\n\nConcentrate on being friendly and gregarious. Try to make the world a more\ncheerful place by smiling at the people you see on the street, at work, or in\nyour neighborhood.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI always use a positive approach to solve my problems.\n\nKing of Wands\n\nThis king follows the advice of Ralph Waldo Emerson: &quot;Do not go where the\npath may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.&quot; And\nso we see that the King of Wands is a bold, charismatic leader, a take-charge\nkind of guy. This leadership role suggests that he has the qualities of\ncourage, self-confidence, strength of character, a sense of purpose and\ndestiny, a desire to make a difference in the world, and dedication to a\ncause. Of course, these qualities would be for naught if he didn’t also take\naction based on them. One warning in this card, however, is that his\nindomitable spirit can degenerate into a prideful or domineering attitude if\nhe is not careful.\n\nUnlike the Knight of Wands, whose energy and enthusiasm tends to be reckless,\nthis king has learned to temper and control his passions, harnessing them to\nwork in his favor. He thus takes responsibility for his own life, realizing\nthat he is the master of his own fate. And his firm conviction that there is a\npurpose in his life—that it has meaning—helps him find fulfillment.\n\nAdvice\n\nAct with courage and conviction in order to take control of your destiny.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am the master of my own destiny, and I am making a difference in the world.\n\n  \n\n####  Cups\n\nAce of Cups\n\nThe Ace of Cups may signal the beginning of an emotional situation, such as a\nnew relationship, a wedding, or a birth, or the healing of an emotional rift\nbetween two people. It can indicate love, empathy, and compassion for others,\nand the peaceful serenity of such feelings. Indeed, it says that the truest\nblessings are those born of our loving relationships.\n\nThis card also teaches us that a pure heart sees beyond distinctions between\npeople, and so it is of unity, not separation. In fact, in most religions,\nthis feeling of universal love is a primary element of right living. Truly\nloving someone involves considering the other person to be an integral part of\nyourself, and in an even broader sense, love is the realization of our\nconnection and oneness with all humankind, as indicated in this quote from\nRumi:\n\nI always thought that I was me — but no, I was you and never knew it.\n\nThis ace also may advise us to trust our intuition and to follow the dictates\nof our heart. Similarly, it echoes the sentiment of this quote from Saint\nTeresa of Avila:\n\nThe important thing is not to think much, but to love much; and so, do that\nwhich best stirs you to love.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ace of Cups can warn of drowning ourselves in a\nrelationship, and consequently shutting out our friends or ignoring our\nresponsibilities. Also, it may warn against having an overly emotional\nresponse to a situation, which can wash us away in a torrent of feelings.\n\nAdvice\n\nStrive to see all your relationships anew through the eyes of love and\ncompassion. When you do so, you will find contentment and fulfillment in them.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am filled with love for everyone in my life.\n\nTwo of Cups\n\nThe image on the Two of Cups card indicates a personal union, the bonding of\ntwo people. It may signify making an emotional connection with someone,\nacknowledging such an attraction, or renewing an old relationship.\n\nThe number two is about choices (among other things), and since this\nparticular card is in the suit of Cups (emotions and relationships), its\nmessage is that love is a choice. While it’s true that we don't choose who we\nfall in love, we do make choices about love every day. For example, the\nquestion, “Do I treat others with love?” is relevant in all our interpersonal\nrelationships.\n\nAlso, this card may depict the healing power of love, and so it can be about\nmaking peace with someone or discovering that our relationships can heal our\nwounds. In fact, loving another person heals the soul, and when we truly love\nsomeone, we also love ourselves.\n\nAdvice\n\nThink of a relationship that is having problems right now, and open your heart\nto it. Transform it by sending it love and by seeing it from the other\nperson’s point of view.\n\nAffirmation\n\nThere is a sacred healing in my loving relationships.\n\nThree of Cups\n\nThe Three of Cups is often called the “friendship card.” We do things with\nfriends like going to movies and throwing parties, but perhaps the best times\nwe spend with our friends are quiet moments together, times when our hearts\nand souls are joined in play even if outwardly we aren’t doing anything\nspecial.\n\nThis card can be about community, camaraderie, and the emotional support and\ncomfort of good friends. It is also about getting along with other people, the\nstrength found in numbers, and a celebration of the old saying, “A joy shared\nis a joy multiplied.” It says that our friendships influence us and help shape\nwho we are. And on a more mundane level, it can indicate partying, but perhaps\nwith a warning against overindulgence.\n\nAn important implication of this card is that we should help a friend when she\nneeds assistance, but of course it goes deeper than that. It also gives us\nother friendship advice, as follows:\n\nListen with your complete attention when a friend needs to talk.\n\nGive advice when asked, but only then.\n\nShare a friend’s sorrows as well as joys.\n\nBelieve in your friends and see the best in them when they’ve lost faith in\nthemselves.\n\nAccept your friends when it would be easier to judge them; forgive them when\nit would be easier to hold a grudge.\n\nThe Three of Cups can also indicate the celebration of a successful platonic\nrelationship such as a business partnership.\n\nAdvice\n\nYour friendships are important, so celebrate them. Call a friend to plan to\nget together or just to tell her that she is important to you.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am blessed with many supportive friends.\n\nFour of Cups\n\nA common image on the Four of Cups is that of a man who is ignoring a cup that\nthe Divine is handing him. Thus it may depict self-absorption, emotional\nwithdrawal, melancholy, apathy, ennui, or perhaps (in a more positive vein) a\nrespite from emotional stress. It may indicate a weak foundation for our\nemotional well being, or it can say that we are stuck in an emotional rut and\nnot ready for something that the universe is offering us. Consequently, we may\nneed a bit of advice from this card, which is that although our emotions and\ncircumstances are constantly shifting, we can achieve stability by finding and\ncentering on our spiritual core.\n\nIf the Three of Cups is the “party card” then we may see the Four of Cups as\nthe “hangover card” — an indication of dissatisfaction which we might feel\nsubsequent to indulging too much in the more trivial pursuits of life.\nHowever, this melancholy aspect to the Four of Cups is tempered by the promise\nof healing in the offing, as indicated by the proffered cup.\n\nOn a deeper, more spiritual level, the Four of Cups can indicate a resistance\nto finding meaning in your life, as illustrated in the following quote from\nGary Zukav.\n\nBoredom is your ‘fuller life’ calling you, and your fear of hearing that call.\n[[39]](text00000.html#_edn39)\n\nAdvice\n\nExamine your relationships to see where they seem to be unfulfilling. Then\nrather than considering where they may be failing you, consider how they may\nbe an offering of Universal Love that you just don’t realize yet.\n\nAffirmation\n\nMy heart is open to new possibilities and new opportunities.\n\nFive of Cups\n\nThe Five of Cups can indicate mourning and bereavement, but it also may be a\nclassic depiction of “crying over spilt milk” or “water under the bridge.” It\nindicates an emotional loss, such as an unhappy ending to a relationship,\nsaying goodbye to someone or something we cherish, or not saying goodbye when\nwe need to do so. Thus, this card can portray the suffering we put ourselves\nthrough when we cling to someone or something after it is gone. So this card\nalso may be about empathy and consolation, advice to comfort someone, or a\nneed to be comforted. And it’s important to realize that for most of the\nsorrows we hold on to, we don’t need someone to solve or fix anything. It’s\nusually just enough to have a silent witness. Then, w hen we allow this\nprocess to bring us to a place of closure, we can let go and move on.\n\nOn the other hand, this card may indicate someone indulging in their own\nprivate “pity party.” When we’re on the outside looking in, it’s tempting to\njudge those people harshly, but when we’re the woe-begotten one, it’s easy to\njustify a morose celebration of all that has gone wrong. In either case,\nthough, it’s important to remember that we are all doing the best we can with\nwhat we’ve got.\n\nTypically two of the cups depicted on this card are not overturned, which can\nindicate advice to turn our attention toward what we still have or to find\nsomething positive in our current circumstance so we can learn and grow from\nthe experience. In other words, are you seeing the glass as half empty or as\nhalf full?\n\nAdvice\n\nSeek closure in a relationship that is over. It doesn’t matter if the other\nperson was a friend who moved away, a lover who rejected you, or a family\nmember who died. Whatever the case, bring that person into your mind and then\nconsider the joy and meaning that had been in this relationship. Finally, give\nsilent thanks to that person for being a part of your life, and then say\ngoodbye. This doesn’t mean throwing them out of your heart; it means accepting\nthat this phase of the relationship is over.\n\nAffirmation\n\nMy grief and sorrow are drifting away, leaving me in peace and serenity.\n\nSix of Cups\n\nThe Six of Cups typically shows two children interacting, and with that, it\nsymbolizes the innocent and unconditional love of a child, which we tend to\nlose when we grow up. To help us regain that, the Six of Cups advises trying\nto let our inner child share a loving connection with someone else’s inner\nchild. This can be a heartfelt sharing with another person through simple\nthings like playing games together, talking about our lives, or doing nothing\nmore than just hanging out together. It may apply to any sort of\nrelationship—romantic, familial, or friendly, or even just a casual\nacquaintance we may make while at work, at a party, or on vacation. It also\nincludes little things like giving a warm smile to a beggar on the street, for\nwe can express our love for other people with a smile or a sympathetic touch.\nAs Mother Teresa said, &quot;Every time you smile at someone, it is an action\nof love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.&quot;\n\nThe innocent charm of this card also may indicate the enjoyment of domestic\nbliss or the simple pleasures of life. It can indicate innocence, kindness, or\nforgiveness, and sometimes it can imply nostalgia and happy thoughts of better\ntimes. However, t he association that this card has with childhood issues also\nsuggests the problems we experience in adulthood as a result of childhood\ntraumas, or it may indicate a smothering relationship in which we feel as\nthough we are being treated like a child.\n\nAdvice\n\nShare your hopes and dreams with someone you love and trust.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI let my love circulate among the people in my life.\n\nSeven of Cups\n\nThe Seven of Cups depicts a person with many options, but who may be confused\nand unable to make a choice. Since this card is in the suit of Cups, which\ndeals with emotions, this indecision is generally on an emotional level.\nConsequently, the advice of this card may be to follow your bliss, i.e., to\ndiscover what it is that you really love and then focus on doing that. As Rumi\nsaid, &quot;Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you\nreally love. It will not lead you astray.&quot;\n\nThe Seven of Cups also has a very dream-like quality, which may indicate\nliving in a dream world, believing in illusions, suffering delusions, or\nindulging in escapism. Perhaps, for example, we have unrealistic illusions of\na relationship that we need to see clearly. Similarly, this card may warn of\ninaction due to daydreaming or wishful thinking. On the other hand, fantasy\ncan be inspirational in the right context, such as a creative or artistic\nendeavor.\n\nAdvice\n\nWhen you are confused, take a moment to clear your mind and ask, “What am I\nfeeling in this circumstance?” Consider how valid your emotional responses are\nand how they may be affecting your judgment. Then, in a state of calm and\ncenteredness, release these emotions and their control over you.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am opening my eyes to a higher truth about my relationships with other\npeople.\n\nEight of Cups\n\nThe Eight of Cups indicates dissatisfaction with old achievements or\nrelationships and a consequent withdrawal in search of new directions. Thus,\nit can mean letting go, leaving behind old attachments, and moving on with our\nlife. There is an element of sadness and regret here, but a certain amount of\nhope as well. Although there may be something missing in our life, in moving\non we have the chance to find more fulfillment and deeper meaning. Also, what\nwe really need to leave behind may be our emotional distress and anxiety about\na situation. Perhaps we don’t have to leave the situation itself, and\nsometimes it’s not possible to do that, but we can always change our\nperspective about it and our emotional reactions to it.\n\nSimilarly, this card can suggest those times when we begin to realize that our\npresent circumstances are unacceptable. It can be hard to arrive at that\nrealization, however, and we tend to stick with bad situations in the vain\nhope that they will improve. But this card can say that we need to realize\nthat it's time to move on.\n\nAdvice\n\nTake a journey into the realm of your heart. For just a while, leave behind\nthe obvious and the mundane, and search for that which is mysterious in your\nlife.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am leaving behind old attachments so that I can discover better things in my\nlife.\n\nNine of Cups\n\nTraditionally, the Nine of Cups is referred to as the Wish Card. It depicts\ncontentment and satisfaction as we bask in the glow of achievement. Of course,\nit's easy to appreciate success and good fortune when it befalls us, but it's\nthe much harder practice of appreciating the value of everything in our\nlives—including the intangibles like love, hope, and serenity, and even the\nchallenges that help us grow—that brings us deep and lasting joy. So a\nvaluable piece of advice in this card is to consider some of our smaller and\nless-obvious blessings and then acknowledge and give thanks for them too.\n\nWhile this card is about gratitude, its dark side is that sometimes we take\nsatisfaction to a negative extreme when we become self-satisfied or self-\nrighteous. This doesn’t just mean “Don’t brag,” it also warns us against\nfeeling superior to other people.\n\nAnother problem expressed by this card is that it can indicate enjoyment and\nsatisfaction that is without regard to the consequences, for the pleasures we\nexperience today may require payment tomorrow. Also, our immersion in pleasure\nmay be an attempt to hide a deeper sadness.\n\nFinally, this card sometimes reminds me of the ironic curse, “May all your\nwishes come true.” In that case, it can be an admonishment to be sure to know\nwhat we really want and to be prepared for it, since we may well get it.\n\nAdvice\n\nSpend some time counting your blessings (literally) and giving thanks for\nthem.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI constantly find reasons to be happy about my life and to find joy in it.\n\nTen of Cups\n\nThis card, with its typical image of a happy family under a rainbow, implies\nthe joy and serenity of having found our place in our community and of being\nat one with the world. It depicts emotional well being, as well as peace and\nharmony, especially in our close relationships. Similarly, it suggests that\nour true family is our community or a group we discover in our adulthood, as\nexpressed in the following quote.\n\n&quot;The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect\nand joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under\nthe same roof.&quot; — Richard Bach\n\nThe tens in the Tarot deck are often concerned with the results or\nconsequences of completing a cycle, which in the case of the Ten of Cups\nrefers to an emotional one. Consequently, this card implies the attainment of\npurity, innocence, and compassion through the integration of our emotional\nexperiences. However, it is not so much that we have learned to control our\nemotions as it is that we have learned to experience them, appreciate them,\nand then let them go of them when we need to move on. This indicates coming\nfull circle from the innocence of naiveté (the Ace of Cups) to that of\nmaturity.\n\nSo, for example, the self-satisfaction of having what we want, as seen in the\nNine of Cups, has matured with the Ten of Cups into the joy of being who we\nwant to be, and of being with people that we love. Thus, this card also\nindicates happy, stable relationships, especially long term ones. The rainbow\non this card, however, implies that we may have an idealized view of what a\nrelationship should be, or perhaps our joy in a relationship is illusory,\nelusive, or ephemeral.\n\nAdvice\n\nStrive to see your relationships realistically, knowing that they need not be\nperfect. An ideal of what a relationship should be is an admirable goal but\nnot an admirable expectation.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am complete and at peace in all my relationships.\n\nPage of Cups\n\nThe Page of Cups can indicate the start of a journey of discovery into the\nmysteries of love, romance, and relationships, and in the RWS version, the\nfish popping up from a cup is a vivid depiction of a surprising message from\nour unconscious mind or intuition. This unexpected fish may also symbolize an\nemerging spiritual awareness, psychic ability, or a budding imagination. And\nso this card tells us that when we are open to our imagination and intuition,\nwe receive surprising gifts that can help us comprehend the mysterious depths\nof our soul. It urges us to embrace the mysteries of life for they will\nenchant us, and our pursuit of them will lead us into amazing realms we never\neven dreamed of.\n\nThis card often signals a new love affair, perhaps even a first date, or it\nmay represent innocence or naiveté in a relationship. It also says that w hen\nwe learn to explore our relationships—the platonic as well as romantic—with\nthe unconditional love of a child, we will find them to be full of wonder and\ndelight. And as we become more emotionally open like a child, we will draw\nother people to us, and they will respond to us with their hearts opened more\nthan usual.\n\nAdvice\n\nGive your imagination free reign once and a while. Its playfulness can help\nyou explore your soulful depths and learn the lessons of your heart.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI have a wonderful and powerful imagination, and I use it to envision a better\nlife and a better world.\n\nKnight of Cups\n\nThe Knight of Cups is a visionary, and he tells us that w hen we are lost in\nthe forest of life’s problems, we can stop for a quiet moment of contemplation\nto listen to our heart, and it will show us the way. Similarly, this card may\nsymbolize acting upon our intuition and gut feelings.\n\nSince this is a Cups card, the volatility that is a hallmark of the knights is\ntypically in the domain of our emotions. So although the Knight of Cups can be\nromantic and sensitive, he may be temperamental and moody as well.\n\nAnother message of this card is, &quot;You can't swim wearing armor.&quot; The\nmeaning of this is that we can't have meaningful relationships with other\npeople if we insist on being guarded. if we want to experience deep\nrelationships we have to open up and allow ourselves to be vulnerable.\n\nThe Knight of Cups can also indicate a spiritual quest, which is explicitly\nillustrated in my Tarot of the Masters version of the card. There we see the\npure-of-heart Sir Galahad who achieved the Holy Grail, symbol of the desire\nfor spiritual perfection.\n\nAdvice\n\nPause to reflect upon the vision that you have for your life and meditate upon\nwhere it is taking you. Then act on the intuitive wisdom of your heart that\narises from this contemplation.\n\nAffirmation\n\nMy heart is pure, and it shows me the way toward true happiness and\nfulfillment.\n\nQueen of Cups\n\nThis queen is devoted to and emotionally supportive of her family and her\ncommunity. She seeks peace and harmony in her life, and love and friendships\nare very important to her. Those around her are nurtured and transformed by\nher love and compassion. She understands her emotions and is in touch with\nthem.\n\nIt is a truism that our relationship problems come from within ourselves as\nmuch as from other people. Many of us are emotionally insecure and grasping\nfor the love and approval of others. We need more of this queen's emotional\nself-confidence, and she suggests that we work on loving ourselves more so\nthat we can become emotionally secure. One way to do this is to stop judging\nourselves so much. Something else we can do is to recall that our true Self is\ndivine. The flaws and mistakes are not our real, essential Self. When we\nrealize that, we love ourselves and as a consequence are able to love other\npeople unconditionally.\n\nThis queen is also in touch with the mysterious unconscious and with her\nspirituality. She has a sensitive and empathic nature, and in extreme cases\nshe may be a mystic who is able to see clearly the mysteries of her higher\nself. In addition, she has learned how to focus and direct her imagination and\ncreativity to make her dreams come true.\n\nAdvice\n\nQuietly look inside your heart to find the loving, compassionate part of\nyourself. Accept it and embrace it, then exercise it in your relationships.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am gentle and compassionate in all my relationships.\n\nKing of Cups\n\nThe King of Cups is artistic, philosophical, diplomatic, and ministerial. He\nhas great dignity and sincerity, and can be kind, generous, and merciful.\n\nThe painting that inspired my Tarot of the Masters version of this card is a\nJapanese hanging scroll that depicts the Bodhisattva of Compassion and Mercy.\nHe was generally depicted in a meditative attitude, and his image has long\nbeen popular with Zen practitioners whose pursuit of enlightenment values\nmeditation and stillness of mind. Likewise, this card encourages us to\npractice meditation to train ourselves to remain serene in the midst of\nemotional turmoil. Another message of this card is that being at peace is the\nway to lead others to peace.\n\nThis ability to remain calm and composed amid stressful situations is\nvaluable, but when emotional control is mere sublimation of our feelings, we\nrisk becoming a prime candidate for an ulcer. Another warning of this card\ncomes from the fact that this king may be controlling in his relationships\ntoo.\n\nAdvice\n\nBe diplomatic and maintain control of your emotional responses in tumultuous\nsituations.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI handle my relationships with tact and diplomacy.\n\n  \n\n####  Swords\n\nAce of Swords\n\nThe sword of discernment that shines in this ace cuts through illusion and\nconfusion, and it indicates clarity of thought and a search for truth. It cuts\nthrough old ways of thinking to reveal fresh insights and to usher in powerful\nnew ideas. However, new ideas and attitudes are often born of struggle and\nstrife, but hopefully we can learn from experience and emerge from adversity a\nbit wiser.\n\nThe Ace of Swords also represents the gatekeeper of the mind. This card says\nthat our consciousness and perceptions of reality are determined by the\nthoughts we dwell on because they are like seeds that sprout and grow into the\ncircumstances of our lives. Thus, the people and experiences we attract are\ninfluenced by our predominant state of mind. In short, our thoughts create who\nwe are. As Marcus Aurelius said, “The soul becomes dyed with the color of its\nthoughts.”\n\nThis card also expresses the truisms that “Knowledge is power” and “The truth\nshall set you free” ... but it might hurt in the process. A negative aspect of\nthis Ace is an exclusive reliance upon reason and intellect, which can lead to\nheartless behavior.\n\nAdvice\n\nPerhaps the best path to wisdom is encapsulated in the Zen saying, “Don't seek\nthe truth; just stop cherishing your opinions.” So question your assumptions.\nChoose a concept or belief that you hold close to your heart and re-examine it\nwith a completely open mind. You may reaffirm it, refine it, or reject it.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am always open to new ideas and points of view.\n\nTwo of Swords\n\nThe Two of Swords recommends objectivity and equanimity, but it can also mean\nthat we are using rationalizations to block our emotions or to avoid\nacknowledging them.\n\nIn the RWS version of the Two of Swords, we see a woman wearing a blindfold,\nwhich indicates impartiality, but it also may be interpreted as having a\nquiet, undistracted mind. This suggests an association with this quote from\nRam Dass: “The quieter you become, the more you can hear,” which advocates a\nwillingness to listen to other people and to consider other points of view.\nSimilarly, this card often indicates that there are two sides to every story.\n\nI t may indicate a stalemate or a truce that brings temporary peace. Sometimes\nit depicts postponing a decision while attempting to regain balance in our\nlife, or it may recommend a compromise, perhaps arising from understanding\nboth sides of a disagreement. But while compromise is often healthy, sometimes\nit can indicate the avoidance of a necessary choice.\n\nThis card also warns against the common “us versus them” view of the world\nthat we tend to have. With that mindset, we look for conflict instead of\ncompromise, and so we end up creating results that are the polar opposite of\nwhat we intended. But when we withdraw from arguments instead and we try to\nfind ways for everyone to win, we stop life’s pendulums from swinging from\nextreme to extreme.\n\nAdvice\n\nImpartially consider both sides of every argument and seek compromise where it\nis reasonable.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI always consider both sides of every argument.\n\nThree of Swords\n\nThis card’s image of a heart pierced by three swords dates back to the Sola\nBusca Tarot deck from the fifteenth century, and it has been a common motif\nsince the RWS deck of 1910. This vivid imagery is commonly interpreted as\nsorrow or heartbreak, but since this card is in the suit of Swords, which\ndeals with thought and communication, it has deeper layers of meaning that\nshould be examined as well. For example, it is concerned with the pursuit of\ntruth, no matter how cruel it may be; a need to understand and work through\npainful learning experiences; and the healing of psychological wounds.\n\nWe often resist discussing the horrible wounds we have deep inside us,\npreferring instead to shut them up in a dark attic where we don’t have to look\nat them. But, as I once heard Alice Walker say in a Sacred Awakening podcast,\n[[40]](text00000.html#_edn40) “There is no way to get the healing without\nknowing what the wound is.” Thus the Three of Swords can indicate striving to\nunderstand our pain and suffering and that of others, or expressing our\nanguish in order to be healed.\n\nThis card also symbolizes words that hurt, such as those said in the heat of\nan argument. Indeed, tact is often the first casualty in an argument. In\ntrying to prove a point or justify our opinions, we forget that there are\nother things more important than mere facts. So the Three of Swords may urge\nus to be careful of what we say or to apologize for hurtful things we have\nalready said. As Henry David Thoreau said, “The only way to speak the truth is\nto speak lovingly.” Similarly, this card can indicate the insensitivity of an\noverly analytical mind.\n\nFinally, considering the heart in this card symbolically, it may advocate\ncutting to the heart of a matter.\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider a situation in which your heart was pierced by someone’s words or\ndeeds. Express your sorrow (whether privately, to a friend, or to the one who\nwounded you) so that you can release it and then find healing.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am letting go of painful experiences so that I can move on with my life.\n\nFour of Swords\n\nThere is a lovely air of serenity to this card, and it suggests meanings like\nrest, recuperation, retreat, meditation, introspection, and contemplation, and\nit may suggest meditation or reflection upon the past in order to prepare for\nthe future. It can also indicate the setting aside of conflicts or the mere\navoidance of arguments.\n\nThere are natural cycles of activity and rest in life, but in our fast paced\nmodern world we tend to see activity as worthwhile and to discount the value\nof rest. The Four of Swords advises us to give ourselves permission to rest,\nto disengage from life for a while, but it also warns against getting stuck in\na rut of inaction. The withdrawal it depicts also helps us gather up our\nresources before returning to a quest or conflict. For example, consider the\nfocused concentration of an athlete preparatory to entering into a\ncompetition.\n\nOn a very esoteric level, the Four of Swords may indicate the fourth level of\nconsciousness which transcends the three levels of waking, dreaming and deep\nsleep. This transcendental consciousness is our essential, divine Self, and\nthis card may urge us to seek that.\n\nOn a mundane level, it may just indicate the importance of getting the rest we\nneed.\n\nAdvice\n\nLet go of a difficult conflict, or at least reconsider your position on it, so\nthat you may rest and find peace. Perhaps if you sleep on it you can deal with\nit later with a fresh perspective.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am at peace with the world.\n\nFive of Swords\n\nThe Five of Swords can indicate discord, betrayal, humiliation, degradation,\ncruelty, or thoughtlessly selfish words or deed.  We may even see it as\nsomeone taking a &quot;scorched earth&quot; approach to an argument.\n\nLike the Five of Wands, this is a card of strife and conflict, but in this\ncase, it generally involves a conflict of ideas or words. It can mean winning\nan argument but losing friends in the process, or it can say that someone,\nwith gross insensitivity, has gone too far in an argument. So if this card\ncomes up in a relationship reading, it can say, “Do you want to be right or do\nyou want to be happy?”\n\nWhen someone disagrees with us, we may consider them to be an enemy (at least\nto some extent) because we take disagreements personally. They’re either with\nus or against us. (Never mind that this is a false dichotomy.) But what if we\nconsider them to be our teacher instead? If we can get our ego out of the way\nfor a while and listen to such “enemies” with an open mind, we just might\ndiscover some valuable truths about ourselves for there usually is something\nimportant to be learned from them. Unfortunately, an insistence that we are\nright usually means that we aren’t listening to the other person. But how can\nwe connect with them if we refuse to listen? Or we may view the other person\nas being foolish in order to give ourselves the ego-satisfying illusion that\nwe’re better than they are. In that case, instead of working on our own issues\nto pull ourselves up, we try to put them down to provide the illusion that\nwe’ve risen up.\n\nMore generally, the Five of Swords can depict a Pyrrhic victory or a no-win\nsituation wherein we may want to cut our losses and get out before it’s too\nlate.  Sometimes we stick around in a bad situation because it's all we know,\neven fooling ourselves into thinking that things will improve. This card urges\nus to recognize hopeless situations when they arise so we can avoid or escape\nthem.\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider an argument that you recently had with someone. Were there truths\ninvolved (such as love or friendship) that were more important than the petty\nones over which you fought? Think about how you could have handled this\nconflict better, and then replay it in your mind, but this time, see your\nactions and reactions transformed by a sense of grace.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am able to control my ego and my feelings of hostility.\n\nSix of Swords\n\nThere is a very somber quality to the image on the Six of Swords that is\nreminiscent of the mythical ferry that carried souls across the river Styx to\nHades. Consequently, it can symbolize a passage—spiritual or otherwise—from\nwhich there may be no turning back. In addition, since the boat in this card\nseems headed for calmer waters or friendlier shores, this card may imply going\non a retreat or leaving our problems behind.\n\nIn the RWS version of the Six of Swords, six swords are stuck point down in\nthe boat, reminding us that wherever we go, we take our thoughts and attitudes\nwith us. Thus, this card also advocates trying to leave negative thoughts or\nattitudes behind as we enter into a new situation or relationship since many\nof our recurring problems stem from taking them with us wherever we go.\n\nThis card can advise us to put some distance between ourselves and a\ntroublesome situation in order to gain objectivity, a healthier perspective,\nor a better frame of mind. As Marcel Proust said, “The real voyage of\ndiscovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.”\nSimilarly, this card urges us to remember that there is more to life than its\nproblems.\n\nThe shared boat ride depicted in this card can suggest a support group helping\nus traverse troubled waters. However, this interpretation also says that it is\nimportant to know enough to get off the boat once it reaches friendlier\nshores.\n\nAnother implication of this card can be summed up in the traditional quote,\n“We’re all in the same boat.” And on a mundane level, the Six of Swords can\nimply travel or a change of scenery.\n\nAdvice\n\nWhen in a difficult situation, take a moment to put some distance (either\nphysical or psychological) between it and yourself in order to gain a better\nperspective.\n\nAffirmation\n\nMy positive thoughts and optimistic attitude are leading me to a more peaceful\nlife.\n\nSeven of Swords\n\nWhile this card traditionally has a wealth of pejorative keywords associated\nwith it (such as sabotage, robbery, treachery, deceit, and dishonor) it is not\ntypically one that people hate to see in a reading. This may be because they\ntend to identify more with the thief than with the injured party, and the\nthief seems to be getting away with his mischief. Or at least he thinks he can\nget away with it, which suggests an association with a quote by T. B. Macaulay\n: &quot;The measure of a man’s real character is what he would do if he knew\nhe would never be found out.&quot;\n\nOther meanings for this card include taking the easy way out or running away\nfrom our responsibilities, although it also may indicate that there is a\njustified need for slyness, stealth, or cunning. Thus, it can signify\ndisarming an opponent, evening the odds in what may be an unfair situation, or\nusing our ingenuity to make the best of a bad situation. It may depict the\nrisky business of going it alone when the odds are stacked against us. Or it\nmay mean recovering or reclaiming something that originally belonged to us.\n\nAnother way of looking at the Seven of Swords is to see it as finding a new\nand original solution to a problem, which includes the aforementioned\ningenuity as well as guile and wit.\n\nFinally, I have heard it said that if a writer steals the work on one person,\nit’s plagiarism, but if he steals the work of many people it’s called\n“research.” Thus this card may suggest either one, depending on the context in\nthe reading.\n\nAdvice\n\nIs there a situation wherein you feel you are at an unfair disadvantage?\nStealth may be called for, so be sly as a fox. Rather than working harder,\nperhaps you need to work smarter.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI can always find an innovative alternative.\n\nEight of Swords\n\nThis card evokes an impression of being trapped, powerless, or victimized. It\nmay indicate someone whose personal power is hampered or restricted, or it\ncould indicate mental bondage, perhaps due to something like a psychologically\nabusive relationship or childhood. If we take the rigidity of the figure as\ncommonly depicted in this card somewhat literally, there is an implication of\n“the paralysis of analysis.” This means not getting around to doing something\ndue to a compulsive need to completely analyze everything before taking\naction.\n\nSometimes this card tells us that there is more to a given situation than what\nwe see of it and what we think about it. For example, when we are having\nrelationship problems, we should keep in mind that we can’t really know what\nthe other person’s life journey is all about, and we probably don’t know what\ns/he is going through right now, internally or externally. One obvious, but\nseldom used solution is simply to ask him or her.\n\nWhen this card comes up, it also may be reasonable to wonder if the problem at\nhand might have an aspect of self-imposed limitations. Very often it is our\nown thoughts and beliefs that blind us and bind us. As Thich Nhat Hanh says,\n“Freedom is, above all else, freedom from our own beliefs,” and Shoseki said,\n“Truth only reveals itself when one gives up all preconceived ideas.” Perhaps\nwe should also consider if we have a victim mentality.\n\nAdvice\n\nWhen faced with what seem to be obstacles, see opportunities to learn and grow\ninstead. You are not a victim; you have the power to understand your situation\nand to find solutions to it.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI see through the self-limiting beliefs that used to hold me back.\n\nNine of Swords\n\nThe Nine of Swords can indicate worry, and if that’s what it is indicating in\na reading, it’s helpful to remember this saying: “Worry does not empty\ntomorrow of its sorrow; it empties today of its strength.”\n\nThis card also means despair, the suffering we experience when we feel as\nthough life is hopeless. However, it also may indicate the tortures we put\nourselves through when we surrender to our unreasonable fears. This is the\nfeeling we get when we wake up in the middle of the night obsessing about\nworst case scenarios, even though things inevitably do not turn out to be that\nbad in the morning. So when this card turns up, remember that “the darkest\nhour is just before dawn,” and fear and worry are usually the biggest part of\nour problems.\n\nThis card also suggests the unacknowledged psychic wounds that linger in the\ndark recesses of our minds. We can tuck these wounds away in the attic of our\nunconscious minds, but they won’t stay locked up in there. They escape at\nnight and peek out at us in our nightmares where they are disguised in\nsymbolic costumes, which makes it hard for us to recognize them. They are\noften accompanied by shame (symbolically depicted in the RWS Nine of Swords by\nthe face-covering posture of the woman on this card), especially when we\nerroneously take responsibility for them. This helps them hide from the\nhealing light of our attention.\n\nOn a practical level, this card might indicate being under a lot of stress, or\nit literally may indicate being beset by nightmares or having a sleeping\ndisorder.\n\nAdvice\n\nInstead of focusing on your problems, concentrate on finding solutions to\nthem.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI face my troubles head on, calmly and fearlessly.\n\nTen of Swords\n\nWith its common depiction of a man stabbed with many swords, an apparent case\nof overkill, the Ten of Swords suggests that someone has taken draconian\nmeasures that may have been unwarranted. More generally, this image can be\ninterpreted as failure and defeat, with connotations ranging from plans going\nawry to being stabbed in the back. But even when this card indicates hitting\nan all-time low, the good news is that things have gotten about as bad as they\ncan get and are finally going to start getting better.\n\nThis card also says that we make things dull and lifeless when we force them\ninto tiny boxes of labels and explanations. Of course, in order to understand\nthings, our minds find it useful to box them into a framework, a conceptual\nmodel. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but a problem arises when\nwe think (as we typically do) that our concepts are the reality. As Shunryu\nSuzuki said, &quot;As soon as you intellectualize something, it is no longer\nwhat you saw.&quot;\n\nThe Ten of Swords may suggest analyzing something to death, sucking all the\njoy and excitement out of it. Exciting plans and ideas often seem to have a\nlife of their own, but when we examine and nit-pick every little detail about\nthem, we can destroy their vitality.\n\nAnother way to consider this card is to see that a course of action based\nsolely upon cold logic and analysis, and devoid of compassion or spiritual\ninsight, can be ruinous. Consider the way that people often justify inhumane\nactions based on soulless concepts of the world. For example, when taken to\ntask for not considering the suffering caused by cold-hearted business\ndecisions, businessmen sometimes say that they are businessmen first and their\nfirst responsibility is to their shareholders. In truth, however, the extent\nto which we have lost sight of our essential spiritual nature is the extent to\nwhich we have lost a part of our own humanity.\n\nFinally the Ten of Swords suggests the expression “death by a thousand cuts.”\nThis term comes from an ancient Chinese form of execution called Ling chi in\nwhich the victim is killed by a multitude of non-fatal cuts. Each cut is\nrelatively small, but the cumulative effect is deadly. This term sounds rather\ndreadful, and in the context of its origin it is, but in general it says that\na large number of small actions can have a great, cumulative effect. Something\nbig can be whittled away slowly, a bit at a time.\n\nAdvice\n\nIf you are in a situation, such as a relationship, that has stagnated or that\nseems to be dying, try to view it with your heart and soul for a while instead\nof with your mind. Experience it as it is rather than analyze and critique it.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am able to experience life without overanalyzing it.\n\nPage of Swords\n\nThis Page has an alert and inquiring mind, and he is always ready to learn new\nthings. His willingness to learn from his misfortunes contributes to his\nability to learn.\n\nW hen exploring this card’s message, we should consider a concept in Zen\nBuddhism called &quot;beginner's mind,&quot; which says that when we study a\nsubject we should strive to avoid approaching it with preconceptions.\nSimilarly, Byron Katie says in her book Who Would You Be Without Your Story? :\n\nThere’s a lot of freedom in “I don’t know.”\n\nThis mindset is a wonderful place to start a journey of discovery. Also, this\nmessage of “I don’t know” can indicate the humbling realization that we’ve\nassumed we know something that we actually only believe.\n\nThis card also tells us that when we feel insecure or defensive, we should\nconsider and decide what it is that we believe. Then, if we can hold fast to\nthose beliefs, we will progress to become the Knight of Swords.\n\nThe RWS portrayal of the Page of Swords as a youth holding a sword in\nreadiness implies vigilance, and traditionally this card has also been\nidentified with activities like eavesdropping and spying. Thus, this card\nadvocates mental preparation and may caution us to be on our guard.\n\nThe Page of Swords also indicates the vast power that can exist in ignorance\nwhen ignorance means not “knowing” that we can’t do something. In my Tarot of\nthe Masters deck, this card was inspired by a painting by Dante Gabriel\nRossetti called Joan of Arc Kisses the Sword of Liberation . One could say\nthat Joan of Arc's success depended to a great extent upon her naiveté and\ninnocence. Everyone else knew that this young girl could not possibly lead the\ndispirited French army to victory, but since Joan herself didn’t know that,\nshe went ahead and did it anyway.\n\nThis card also indicates the importance of visualizing the results we want to\nmanifest whenever we enter into a new endeavor. Finally, tradition holds that\nthis Page may represent a messenger of news that is challenging, thought-\nprovoking, or upsetting.\n\nAdvice\n\nThink about an idea or belief that you are unsure of. Investigate it to see if\nyou should discard it or if, instead, you should strengthen your conviction.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI have an open mind about everything.\n\nKnight of Swords\n\nThe activity and volatility of this Knight often lies in the domain of his\nintellect. He may have high-minded ideals upon which he feels compelled to act\n(sometimes to the point of being quixotic), or he may proceed out of a sense\nof self-righteousness. He may act decisively according to his convictions, or\nhe may be dogmatic and ruthless. He can be clever, quick-witted, perceptive,\npersuasive, and incisive, or he can be sarcastic, overbearing, and\nopinionated.\n\nIn addition to the preceding litany of traits that are characteristic of this\nknight, t his card also encourages us to go about our daily tasks mindfully,\nfully engaged in them. It assures us that when we are wholly present in our\nlives, our work is a joy, not a burden.\n\nThis knight also encourages us to seek new ways of considering our problems so\nthat we may come up with new solutions to them. In other words, he adheres to\nAlbert Einstein’s famous advice:\n\nNo problem can be solved from the same consciousness that created it. We must\nlearn to see the world anew.\n\nAdvice\n\nCarefully examine your ideals before acting upon them. E nsure that they\ntranscend mere dogma.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am always ready and willing to act on the side of justice.\n\nQueen of Swords\n\nThe Queen of Swords wields the sword of critical discernment. She is an astute\nobserver of human nature and is able to see clear through to the core of any\nsituation, cutting through the smokescreens that people often throw up to\nobscure their motives, feelings, or prejudices. She is also independent,\nhaving a great deal of self-reliance and self-control.\n\nOften, her wisdom is based upon experience, including sorrow or heartbreak,\nwhich can associate this card with such attributes as separation or widowhood.\nSo when faced with suffering, this queen reflects the wisdom in the following\nquote.\n\n“To live is to suffer; to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.” —\nFriedrich Nietzsche\n\nConsequently, she also exemplifies our innate ability to learn and grow from\nadversity. As Nietzsche also said, &quot;That which doesn’t kill us makes us\nstronger.&quot; But there is more hope and advice in that sentiment than\nuniversality or ubiquity. Hardship may encourage us to learn and to grow\nstronger, but it doesn’t ensure it. Growth is a choice, and the Queen of\nSwords urges us to make that choice.\n\nAnother problem with the learning opportunities of grief and sorrow is that\nthey often tempt us to protect ourselves from further vagaries of life by\nclinging to strict rules of what is &quot;right and wrong&quot; without\ntempering our judgment with compassion. This is a negative aspect of the Queen\nof Swords. Rigid dogma may seem to provide a safe haven from fate's slings and\narrows, but it also deadens us emotionally. And so this card serves as a\nwarning against becoming moralistic, sanctimonious, and self-righteous. But\nalthough compassion may not be this queen’s strong suit, at her best, she is\nhonest, fair, and willing to listen to both sides of an argument.\n\nAdvice\n\nBeware of being patronizing when you give advice to people, and remember that\nalthough guidance may be offered, it never should be imposed on others.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am able to tell it like it is, honestly but tactfully.\n\nKing of Swords\n\nThe King of Swords can be a wise, tough-minded thinker who plans carefully and\nacts with deliberation. W isdom and expertise are generally associated with\nthis king, but unfortunately he may also believe that he could never be wrong.\nBeing cool and logical, he generally makes fair decisions and renders wise\njudgments, but he risks being cold, harsh, and overly critical.\n\nThis king sometimes represents someone with a lot of book learning but who\nlives in an “ivory tower” and is preoccupied with intellectual considerations\nrather than those of everyday life. Consequently, he may be harsh or\nunrealistic in his evaluation of people and situations. The advice here is\nthat we have to live and experience what we learn. As Ram Dass says in Grist\nfor the Mill :\n\n“... to have what you seek, you have to go beyond knowing and become it.”\n[[41]](text00000.html#_edn41)\n\nIn the discussion of the Page of Swords, the Zen concept of beginner's mind\nwas noted, which is one end of a spectrum. The King of Swords lives at the\nother end of that spectrum, so the next quote exemplifies a warning inherent\nin this card:\n\n&quot;In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities . In the expert's\nmind there are few.&quot; — Shunryu Suzuki\n\nThus, h aving an &quot;expert's mind,&quot; this king may have closed his eyes\nto new possibilities and his mind to new ideas.\n\nThe King of Swords typically wields authority, seeking to maintain law and\norder and to uphold societal values.  Similarly, then, this card urges us to\nfind the King of Swords within us, to realize our own inner source of\nauthority. A problem to be aware of, though, is that sometimes we may lose\nsight of the spirit of the law in our zeal for upholding the letter of the\nlaw.\n\nFinally, when representing a boss or other authority figure, the King of\nSwords may be relied upon for wise counsel, but he also might be a\nmicromanager who nitpicks every detail of his subordinates’ work.\n\nAdvice\n\nMake careful plans and then adhere to a course of action based upon them.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI consider my path rationally, and I make wise decisions about it.\n\n  \n\n####  Pentacles\n\nAce of Pentacles\n\nThis Ace is about new growth and the promise of prosperity, perhaps signaling\na career or financial opportunity. But the Aces are like seeds, full of\npotential but needing to be nourished and tended in order to grow. Thus, when\nthis card comes up, it says that we must make the best of the opportunity that\nit presents in order to enjoy its promise. This may suggest the biblical\nParable of the Sower , in which case this Ace asks, &quot;Will the seeds you\nsow fall on fertile soil, or will they fall on rocky ground, a trampled path,\nor among weeds?&quot; Similarly, this Ace says that we create our own life,\nand it’s up to us to create a beautiful and meaningful one.\n\nThe Ace of Pentacles also represents gratitude, which is an attitude from\nwhich abundance arises. Consequently, it advises us to count our blessings,\nbecause without appreciation the well will run dry.  There are many ways to\ncultivate this sense of appreciation and gratitude. It can be as simple as\nsaying “Thank you” when something nice happens, or it can be as extensive as\nkeeping a “Gratitude Journal” which is a daily record of the things you are\nthankful for.\n\nThe flip side of gratitude is generosity, which is another important aspect of\nthis card.\n\nIn a negative context, this Ace can be a warning that wealth can spoil us or\nmake us dependent on the source of that wealth. It also can indicate being\n“born with a silver spoon in your mouth” or being fixated on the material\nthings in life.\n\nAdvice\n\nTrust that you have worth, that what you do has worth, and that the Universe\nsupports your efforts. Trusting that, let the wealth of the Universe flow\nthrough you and into all that you do.\n\nAffirmation\n\nThe Universe provides for me with its infinite grace and bounty.\n\nTwo of Pentacles\n\nThe Two of Pentacles is an atypical card in that it generally exhibits an air\nof fun and whimsy.  This suggests meanings that range from humor and laughter\nto fun and joy. This doesn’t mean we should fritter our life away, though. It\nmeans that we’re meant to enjoy life, and it also reminds us that laughter is\nthe best medicine. Similarly, this card advises us to be flexible and\nadaptive, but it also says, “Have some fun while you’re at it.”\n\nSometimes this card indicates juggling various projects or tasks, perhaps\nindicating that we have a lot going on but that we should be able to handle it\nall if we maintain our equilibrium. It also tells us that we need to make a\ndecision as to what is truly important in our life. Without that decision and\nits consequent elevated level of awareness, we are easily thrown off balance.\n\nFinally, this card is about change. It says that all things in our material\nworld are transitory, and as a consequence we must be ready to accept pain and\nfailure sometimes along with pleasure and success. This is the inevitable\nresult of living in this impermanent plane of existence with its continually\nshifting circumstances.\n\nAdvice\n\nBalance your needs against those of other people. Whenever you are competing\nwith someone else for resources, bring a sense of compromise into the\nsituation.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am flexible and adaptable in all situations.\n\nThree of Pentacles\n\nThe Three of Pentacles can signify creative endeavors, and it may urge us to\nexpress our creativity in every task we undertake in life. We need not build a\ncastle, compose a symphony, or discover a cure for cancer in order to express\nour creative potential or for our lives to have value. It is not the grandeur\nof what we do that defines us. Rather, it is the sincerity of our efforts and\nthe care we take in those efforts that demonstrates the worth of our work.\n\nThis card also suggests a cooperative venture wherein several people are\nworking as a team on a project too large for one person to do alone. My Tarot\nof the Masters version of this card shows three workmen carving a larger-than-\nlife human head out of stone, which illustrates skillful craftsmanship. On a\ndeeper level, this also indicates that we are all a part of something greater\nthan our individual selves.\n\nThis card also points out the spiritual aspects of ordinary labor. It says\nthat our unity with the Divine can be discovered in the process of our\neveryday work, and the spiritual universe manifests through our creative\nactions in the mundane world.\n\nAdvice\n\nStrive to work with grace and creativity, and with a sense that everything you\ndo is important.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am manifesting my highest potential in my work.\n\nFour of Pentacles\n\nThis card can signify anything from security to stinginess. It can indicate\nfinancial security in the sense of having what we need to support and maintain\nourselves, and it can indicate either protecting our resources or being\nprotected by them. But the Four of Pentacles also can imply an inability to\ngive, in which case it can mean being miserly or possessive. Also, a lack of\ngenerosity suggests an inability to receive, which seems paradoxical until we\nconsider that there is an important difference between receiving as an act of\nacceptance versus taking or grasping. The former is gracious and leads to an\nabundant life; the latter merely provides an abundance of possessions.\n\nNote that the figure in the RWS version of this card sits alone, set apart\nfrom the city in the background.  While the material success indicated here\nmay be well earned and supportive of the figure in this card, there is a dark\nside to it as well. The Four of Pentacles warns of becoming dependent upon\nmaterial things, hoarding them or clinging to them as though they, in and of\nthemselves, are what’s important.\n\nThe Four of Pentacles sometimes reminds me of Scrooge in A Christmas Carol .,\na man who was wealthy, safe, and secure, but sadly all alone. Thus this card\ncan suggest the fact that materialism weighs us down and obscures our vision\nof what is truly important in life. Similarly, materialism isn't about whether\nor not we make money, but how we make it and how we use it. And so this card\nsays that true wealth lies not in what we possess, but in our capacity to\ngive. As A Christmas Carol shows us, there is hope even for a miser like\nScrooge once he learns generosity.\n\nFinally, this card may advise us to be prudent with our resources, warning\nagainst extravagance, carelessness, or wastefulness.\n\nAdvice\n\nDon’t let your concerns about money and security obscure your concern for\nother people. Insofar as you have financial security, share it with others, or\nelse it has no real meaning.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI use the abundance in my life compassionately and wisely.\n\nFive of Pentacles\n\nThe Five of Pentacles sometimes makes people cringe when it comes up in a\nreading since it can mean misfortune, poverty, poor health, loneliness, and\nabandonment, and it can indicate doubting our own self-worth. There are,\nhowever, other ways to consider this card that are not so dismal.\n\nIn the RWS version, a brightly lit church window above two wretched souls\nindicates that comfort and support may be nearby, and perhaps these people\njust need to look up from their misery to find it. Also, if the previous card\nis associated with Scrooge, then this one could be called the “Tiny Tim” card,\nmeaning that poverty of the body need not create poverty of the soul.\n\nThis card also comments on the dual illusions of wealth and scarcity. When we\nbuy into the illusion that acquiring wealth is what’s important in life, we\nmay keep ourselves from being truly joyful and at peace. Sometimes we try so\nvery hard to fill the void in our lives with material possessions and physical\npleasures, which are neither fulfilling nor lasting. Having a life of love,\njoy, and fulfillment is what’s truly important.\n\nActually , abundance means having everything we need , not all that we want ,\nand so true wealth comes from the simplification of desires, not from the\nmultiplication of needs. Thus, this card sometimes advocates the benefits of a\nsimple life. Perhaps we should take a sober look at how we have encumbered\nourselves with so many things and then strive to un-clutter our homes and our\nlives.\n\nOn the other hand, having a scarcity consciousness— the idea that there isn't\nenough to go around—is an illusion too. So this card may say that either\ndoubting our own self-worth or lacking trust in the abundance of the Universe\nmay be at the root of our problems.\n\nThis card can also emphasize the importance of gratitude during hard\ntimes—those times when it is also most difficult to feel a sense of\ngratitude—since a grateful attitude leads to abundance. In addition, a sense\nof appreciation can lead to a realization of what is important in life, such\nas love and relationships.\n\nThe cards in the Minor Arcana that are numbered “Five” can reflect the\nHierophant (the Major Arcana card numbered V) in its aspect of a teacher. Thus\nthese cards may be considered the homework assignments of life, and so the\nFive of Pentacles urges us to learn from our misfortunes. Sometimes it is\nhelpful to remember that they are not here to cause us suffering; they are\nhere to help us learn lessons of appreciation and non-attachment.\n\nThis card also indicates the difficult abyss we may face when we oppose social\nconventions. For example, it may indicate ostracism. And finally, the paupers\nin this card might symbolize steadfast friends or lovers who have stuck\ntogether even through the worst of times.\n\nAdvice\n\nMake a list of possible sources of help in an area of your life where you feel\nthere is something lacking. Then consider how you might approach one of those\nsources for assistance.\n\nAffirmation\n\nMy heart and soul have wealth beyond that of silver and gold.\n\nSix of Pentacles\n\nThe Six of Pentacles is a card of generosity and charity, and it says that our\ngood fortune gains meaning and relevance when shared with others. However,\nthis card also says that sometimes our generosity must be carefully measured\nsince it is not only important that we give, but also how much and how wisely\nwe give. On the other hand, this sense of cautious measurement may indicate\nphilanthropy that is conditional or that has strings attached.\n\nA common misconception about charity is that it is something grand and\nseparate from our daily lives. Actually, charity does not require large,\nphilanthropic institutions or depend on grand gestures of munificence to\naffect the lives of other people. And through even simple, everyday acts of\ngenerosity—the proverbial &quot;random acts of kindness&quot;—we can elevate\nour spirits and find a renewed sense of purpose or meaning in our lives.\n\nAnother way of looking at this card is to consider it from the point of view\nof someone who is benefiting from the kindness of others. When we are in such\na position, it can be difficult to express our gratitude for this kindness\nbecause it's hard to acknowledge that we needed it. Nevertheless, it’s\nimportant that we do so.\n\nThe Six of Pentacles also indicates give-and-take relationships, such as\nemployer and employee, teacher and student, or doctor and patient. While there\nis a seeming dichotomy between the two parties, they are inextricably linked\nand defined by their relationship. They share a common fate for how can one\nexist without the other?\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider all you have gotten out of life, and then think of something you can\ngive back to the world. For example, if you know someone who is down and out,\nplan to do something helpful, be it ever so small, for that person.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am a clear conduit through which the abundance of the universe circulates.\n\nSeven of Pentacles\n\nIs the figure we see in the Seven of Pentacles resting from his labors,\nwatching and waiting for the fruits of them, contemplating his endeavors, or\nsadly reevaluating his efforts? The answer is that he may be doing any one of\nthese things and more.\n\nThe cards numbered “Seven” are about tests, and the Seven of Pentacles may\nindicate a test of our patience or a test of our sense of satisfaction with\nwhat we have. As any farmer can attest, to raise the crop you desire, you need\nto carefully plan for it, constantly evaluate its progress, adjusting your\ncare for it accordingly, and wait for it to grow. So this card can mean that\nwe must patiently wait for the seeds we have planted to come to fruition, or\nthat more work is required before we will be able to reap our just rewards.\n\nAlternatively, the Seven of Pentacles may be about evaluating (or\nreevaluating) the results of our endeavors. One cause for reassessment arises\nwhen we are not sure that the results of our efforts are what we really\nwanted, and so we may need to consider a change of direction. Also, it calls\nto mind the old saying that no one, at the end of his or her life, ever\nregrets not spending more time at the office. Every now and then we should\npause for a moment to reassess the path we have chosen and consider if we are\nspending enough time on the things that are truly important in our lives.\n\nFinally, this card suggests the question, “Have I done all the work, but\nsomeone else owns the results?” And so it may be about work that is\nunrewarding, unsatisfying, or mere drudgery.\n\nAdvice\n\nReevaluate something you have been working on, and reassess how you have\ninvested your efforts.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am making careful plans to create success in my life.\n\nEight of Pentacles\n\nThe Eight of Pentacles has connotations of competence, skill, hard work,\ndedication, diligence, productivity, and meticulousness.\n\nIt is about paying attention to small details in order to get big things done,\nand its message echoes the truism that practice makes perfect. Similarly, it\nserves as a reminder of what Aristotle said many centuries ago:\n\nWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not an act but a habit.\n\nThis card also says we should approach each task in our day-to-day life with\nfocused concentration, as in the saying “When there is a task to do, be the\ntask.” Similarly, this card tells us that in any activity, it is the journey\nthat is important, not the destination.\n\nThe Eight of Pentacles can indicate a need for industriousness, and so it may\nurge us to avoid procrastination and to press on with our work, putting our\nnose to the grindstone. However, as Henry David Thoreau said, “It is not\nenough to be industrious; so are the ants. What are you industrious about?” On\nthe other hand, with its indication of repetition, this card might suggest the\nworkers lament of “Same shit, different day.”\n\nFinally, this card may indicate working alone or being self-employed.\n\nAdvice\n\nThe time has come for diligence. Separate yourself from distractions as you\nwork to secure your fortune.\n\nAffirmation\n\nSuccess is coming to me, one step at a time.\n\nNine of Pentacles\n\nThe Nine of Pentacles typically depicts an affluent woman who has earned and\ndeserves the fruits of her labor, and she is now free to enjoy the finer\nthings in life. Sometimes we need to remember not only that we have created\nthe life we are living, but also that we have a right to enjoy that life.\n\nThe affluence of this card implies meanings such as rewards, abundance,\naccomplishment, satisfaction, and fulfillment. Another implication is that\nthis compensation is the result of hard work, discipline, prudence, self-\nreliance, and self-control, all of which are characteristics recommended by\nthis card.\n\nIn addition, the woman on this card appears to be an integral part of the\nenvironment she has created, and we may infer from this that we are empowered\nto create the life that we want. Similarly, this card advises us to develop a\nprosperity consciousness (as opposed to the poverty consciousness we may infer\nfrom the Five of Pentacles).\n\nThis card also advises us to live in harmony with nature and our environment,\nand it reminds us that our actions affect the world around us, and vice versa.\nThis observation overlaps with an interesting discovery that I have made about\nthis card recently. I have seen that it can suggest the use of feng shui, an\nancient Chinese system that tells us how altering our external conditions can\nsupport our life force and inner growth.\n\nFinally, the attitude and attire of the woman in this card implies the\nconsequent refinement, culture, self-esteem, and self-confidence that come\nwith achievements.\n\nAdvice\n\nConsider your accomplishments and how you achieved them in order to learn from\nyour past successes.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI enjoy the abundant life I have created for myself.\n\nTen of Pentacles\n\nThe Ten of Pentacles is sometimes called the Wealth Card, and it can refer to\nan inheritance or a windfall of some sort. I t also reminds us to be thankful\nfor our good fortune and to celebrate it and share it with family, friends, or\nour community. More generally, though, this card may refer to anything we\ninherit, which can range from artistic talent to a polluted environment.\n\nThis card may indicate feeling secure in our domestic situation and might even\nsay that we are headed for something better. On the other hand, it may\nindicate an excess of money. Thus, for example, it can refer to children who\nare spoiled or overprotected, and it can indicate situations where material\ngifts are lavished on someone to compensate for a lack of love and attention.\n\nThe scene on many versions of the Ten of Coins depicts a marketplace, thus\nassociating this card with business and commerce, and perhaps providing an\nauspicious sign with regards to a commercial venture. In addition, this card\nmay refer to concentrations of wealth, such as that of large corporations and\ninstitutions, the church, or the government. Or it can refer to the wealth of\na community in general.\n\nAdvice\n\nMuch of who and what we are comes from our parents. Consider their\ncontributions to your life—both the good and the bad—in order to understand\nbetter where you are today, and how you got here.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI thank the Universe for the abundance it provides , and I share it with\nothers.\n\nPage of Pentacles\n\nThe Page of Pentacles can herald an opportunity to make money or to excel in a\ncareer, but it may say that we may have to start at the bottom rung of the\ncorporate ladder and work our way up. While the Universe may give us the\nbreaks we need, we must learn the skills and do the work necessary to fulfill\nthose opportunity. The qualities of this Page that will help us go far in such\ncircumstances are studiousness, diligence, persistence, hard work, and\npatience... and humility. Thus, this card may relate to situations connected\nwith learning skills or a trade, and it advises us to approach them with an\nopen mind.\n\nThis card also indicates having a childlike sense of wonder and curiosity\nabout the world. When we see things through the inquisitive eyes of a child,\nwe rediscover the enjoyment of the wonders of the manifest world. As Walt\nStreightiff said, &quot;There are no seven wonders of the world in the eyes of\na child. There are seven million.&quot;\n\nIn its guise as a messenger, this Page might convey a message relating to a\nboon or financial good fortune.\n\nAdvice\n\nSee your work with a fresh perspective by explaining it to a child, paying\nclose attention to her questions and comments about it. If that is not\npossible, then step back and try to see your work through the eyes of a child.\nSee it without preconceived notions, see it with a sense of wonder and awe,\nand see new possibilities in it.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am finding new, innovative approaches to my business.\n\nKnight of Pentacles\n\nThe Knight of Pentacles is prudent and hardworking, he takes pride in his\ncraft and his accomplishments, and he is down-to-earth, practical,\nresponsible, and dependable. And so this card is a common indicator of making\na living and providing for the welfare of yourself and your family.\n\nAlthough the Tarot’s knights are generally volatile, this one is in the suit\nof Pentacles, so his active nature is restrained by the stability and\ngrounding of his suit. Indeed, in the RWS deck, this is the only knight who is\nmotionless, and so this card can advocate staying grounded in all that we do.\nIt recommends an attentive awareness of what we are doing, and it agrees with\nthe advice stated in the following quote.\n\n&quot;Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the\nsecret of success.&quot; — Swami Sivananda\n\nThe Knight of Pentacles is like the proverbial tortoise that won the race\nagainst a hare; he succeeds through slow, steady effort. So when we are\nworking hard on something but cannot see results yet, this knight tells us to\nstick with it and not get discouraged. He also reminds us that a journey of a\nthousand miles not only begins with one step but is also traveled one step at\na time.\n\nThis knight is dependable and loyal, but he also can be possessive and grimly\ndetermined to hold on to whatever he has acquired. He may be cautious about\nmaking a commitment, but when he does make one, he holds to it. Similarly, he\nadvises us to fulfill our obligations.\n\nFinally, a negative aspect of this knight is that he may be a stick-in-the-\nmud, an all-work-and-no-play kind of guy.\n\nAdvice\n\nEven when there is much yet to be done in your work, you can accomplish it all\nif you take things one step at a time, just as a journey of a thousand miles\nis traveled one step at a time.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am seeing tangible results from my efforts.\n\nQueen of Pentacles\n\nThis queen is strongly reminiscent of the Empress. She is nurturing,\npractical, and responsible, and she is devoted to caring for those around her,\nsuch as her family and her community. She is also supportive of the work and\nphysical well-being of other people.\n\nAn important point to remember about nurturing is that a profound sense of\ntrust is necessary in any sort of caring relationship in that we must trust\nthat the other person is growing even when we can’t see it. As an illustration\nof this, consider a gardener who has planted seeds. For a time, she won’t see\nanything happening, but she can’t dig up the seeds to check on them. She just\nhas to trust that they are growing.\n\nDue to her resourcefulness, the Queen of Pentacles typically has attained\nmaterial security, which enables her to be giving and to help others, for she\nknows that generosity does not deplete her. Actually, it makes way for the\nendless abundance of Mother Nature to flow through her. In this, she assures\nus that we have a place in the cycle of abundance that supports us all.\n\nIn addition, this queen is sensual and sensuous, in touch with her physicality\nand with the material world, and she is at one with nature. Thus, this card\ncan signify a mature experience of sensuality in that it counsels enjoyment\nwithout extravagance, and comfort without indolence.\n\nOn a more abstract level, this card can represent fertility, abundance, and\nprosperity.\n\nAdvice\n\nTake time to nurture your health and well being.\n\nAffirmation\n\nThe bounty of the Universe flows through me as I give of myself to others.\n\nKing of Pentacles\n\nThe King of Pentacles is the “salt of the earth.” He is robust, strong, solid,\nand dependable in his work. He is skillful and enterprising and a savvy\nbusinessman, and thus this card forecasts success in business ventures.\nHowever, it also notes that this success brings with it a responsibility to\nprovide for others.\n\nIn most depictions of this card, we see this king sitting comfortably amid\nabundance, but we might wonder where all this wealth came from. Did he create\nit all himself (scrupulously or otherwise) or did he have help? Sometimes what\nwe can get done personally may not be as important as how much we can ensure\ngets done through the efforts of others. Besides being productive, this king\nalso fosters a productive environment, being able to organize and delegate\nwork effectively.\n\nAs a father figure, this king is a good provider for his loved ones, being\ngenerous and reliable, but in return he expects their respect and devotion.\nHis home is his castle. He likes to be in control of what goes on there, and\nhe is ready, willing, and able to defend what is his.\n\nLike his queen, the King of Pentacles has an affinity with nature, although he\nprefers being in control of his environment over being in harmony with it as\nis the case with his queen.\n\nAdvice\n\nRealize that your worth goes far beyond what you possess. Be secure within\nyourself in order to be generous.\n\nAffirmation\n\nI am financially and materially successful, and I provide for those who depend\nupon me.\n\n  \nAppendix 2\n\n##  Bibliography\n\n###  Tarot\n\nBunning, Joan (1998).

For example, the suit of Pentacles may\nbe called Coins or Disks and the suit of Wands is sometimes renamed Staves,\nBatons, or Rods.\n\n[[4]](text00000.html#_ednref4) Beginning Tarot students should be aware that\nthe names of the Court Cards vary from deck to deck. The most common naming\nconvention is “Page, Knight, Queen, King” but this is far from universal. A\ncouple of examples are “Princess, Prince, Queen, King” and “Daughter, Son,\nMother, Father,” and in my Tarot of the Masters deck, which illustrates this\nbook, I have renamed the Page “Youth.”\n\n[[5]](text00000.html#_ednref5) The querent is the person for whom the reading\nis being performed.

Consequently, the use of your non-dominant hand allows\nyour intuition greater control in this process. This also sends a symbolic\nmessage that you are using your intuitive mind in this process.\n\n[[17]](text00000.html#_ednref17) For a more detailed discussion of\nnumerological and elemental meanings, see chapter 1, Associations: Numbers and\nElements .\n\n[[18]](text00000.html#_ednref18) If you are interested in learning more about\nsymbols, refer to the symbolism references in a ppendix 3, Bibliography .\n\n[[19]](text00000.html#_ednref19) See, for example, the analysis provided in\nThe Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales by Bruno\nBettelheim.\n\n[[20]](text00000.html#_ednref20) For an explanation of how I define a\nliteralism, see chapter 7, Pulling it all Together in section 2, Preludes .\n\n[[21]](text00000.html#_ednref21) This is similar to something that Mary Greer\ndoes in her book, Tarot For Your Self (pages 33 - 35). For example, in a\nprocess she calls “Reading for Depth,” she reinterprets a three-card “Body,\nMind, Spirit” spread by redefining it as a “Past, Present, Future” spread.\n\n[[22]](text00000.html#_ednref22) Venus (or Aphrodite) was, or course, Eros’s\nmother.\n\n[[23]](text00000.html#_ednref23) For a detailed description of these types of\nspreads, see chapter 6, Three-Card Spreads in section 2, Preludes .\n\n[[24]](text00000.html#_ednref24) For a more detailed explanation of the Life\nPurpose spread, see the discussion of Progression Spreads in Section 2:\nPreludes, Chapter 6: Three-Card Spreads.\n\n[[25]](text00000.html#_ednref25) A longstanding debate within the Tarot\ncommunity is whether Justice should be the eleventh card in the Major Arcana\nand Strength the eighth, or vice versa. Most modern decks put Justice as\nnumber eleven, but I am flexible on this issue. My comment about the placement\nof the Justice card between the Wheel of Fortune and the Hanged Man,\ntherefore, is intended to lend insights into the relationship between these\nthree cards, not to present a decisive argument that the Justice card should\nbe the eleventh Major Arcana card.\n\n[[26]](text00000.html#_ednref26) For an excellent recounting of the life of\nJoan of Arc, see Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc by Mark Twain\n\n[[27]](text00000.html#_ednref27) For a detailed discussion about rephrasing a\nquerent’s question, see c hapter 5:  Rephrasing the Question in section 2:\nPreludes.\n\n[[28]](text00000.html#_ednref28) For a detailed discussion about reversed\ncards, see chapter 4: Reversed Cards in section 2: Preludes.\n\n[[29]](text00000.html#_ednref29) A t the time of this reading, the Straits\nSettlements (roughly equivalent to modern day Malaysia) included both Penang,\nwhere Anna’s husband died, and Singapore.\n\n[[30]](text00000.html#_ednref30) A frustrating aspect of doing these\nKnightHawk readings is that I can’t explore unexpected tangents with an\n“absentee” querent.\n\n[[31]](text00000.html#_ednref31) See section 2, chapter 3, Finding Card\nMeanings\n\n[[32]](text00000.html#_ednref32) For more about using affirmations with the\ncards, see my book Tarot Affirmations .\n\n[[33]](text00000.html#_ednref33) This interpretation is based on the esoteric\nassignment of conscious or mental aspects to the male principle and\nunconscious or emotional aspects to the female principle where the terms\n“male” and “female” are considered symbolically.\n\n[[34]](text00000.html#_ednref34) Unfortunately, it is difficult to escape the\nsexist implications of a bygone era when discussing this card.\n\n[[35]](text00000.html#_ednref35) Is it a coincidence that this is the twelfth\nMajor Arcana card?\n\n[[36]](text00000.html#_ednref36) When this is the case in a reading, we need\nto tread softly, for the querent may be in denial about having problems like\nphysical abuse or addictions of some sort.\n\n[[37]](text00000.html#_ednref37) Ref: The Complete Poetry and Selected Prose\nof John Donne\n\n[[38]](text00000.html#_ednref38) Ref: The Power of Now .\n\n[[39]](text00000.html#_ednref39) This quote is from The Heart of the Soul:\nEmotional Awareness by Gary Zukav and Linda Francis\n\n[[40]](text00000.html#_ednref40) http://sacredawakeningseries.com/\n\n[[41]](text00000.html#_ednref41) Grist for the Mill by Ram Dass, page 9\n\n[[42]](text00000.html#_ednref42) The second edition of this book is published\nby New Page Books, Franklin Lakes, NJ\n\n",
